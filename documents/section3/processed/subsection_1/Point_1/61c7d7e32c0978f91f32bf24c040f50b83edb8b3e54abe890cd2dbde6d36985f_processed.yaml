    Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, based on the application specific sensors’

    This paper presents an open-source technology based smart system to predict the
    irrigation requirements of a field using the sensing of ground parameter like
    soil moisture, soil temperature, and environmental conditions along with the weather
    forecast data from the Internet. The sensing nodes, involved in the ground and
    environmental sensing, consider soil moisture, soil temperature, air temperature,
    Ultraviolet (UV) light radiation, and relative humidity of the crop field. The
    intelligence of the proposed system is based on a smart algorithm, which considers
    sensed data along with the weather forecast parameters like precipitation, air
    temperature, humidity, and UV for the near future. The complete system has been
    developed and deployed on a pilot scale, where the sensor node data is wirelessly
    collected over the cloud using web-services and a web-based information visualization
    and decision support system provides the real-time information insights based
    on the analysis of sensors data and weather forecast data. The system has a provision
    for a closed-loop control of the water supply to realize a fully autonomous irrigation
    scheme. The paper describes the system and discusses in detail the information

    Water scarcity is already affecting a part of the world and the situation is getting
    worse over time due to the increasing world population and fresh water demands.
    The current world population is around 7.2 billion and it is expected to be more
    than 9 billion by 2050 (United Nations, 2013). The agriculture sector, particularly
    irrigation, consumes a major portion of the freshwater. Due to lack of cost-effective
    intelligent irrigation systems, developing countries are consuming more water
    in contrast to the developed countries for achieving the same yield. For example,
    India has approximately 4% of world’s freshwater resources to serve 17% of the
    world population; however, it takes 2–4 times more water for some of its major
    agri-produce in comparison to the other countries like China, USA (G. o. I. NITI
    Aayog, 2015). Therefore, there is a dire need to come up with advanced technologies
    based smart strategies and systems for effective utilization of fresh water. Gubbi
    et al. (2013) discussed an IoT framework with cloud centric storage, processing
    and analysis of the data received from ubiquitous sensors along with a decision
    support interface. Cruz et al. (2018) suggested a reference model for an IoT middleware
    platform that would support intelligent IoT applications. IoT based solutions
    are proving very helpful in many dimensions of the agricultural landscape (Sharma
    et al., 2016), and these intelligent solutions could also be fruitful in smart
    irrigation with optimum utilization of water. Soil moisture, precipitation, and
    evaporation are the essential parameters for designing a smart irrigation system.
    The precipitation and evaporation are important key factors, which influence the
    soil moisture. In geography and climatology, the wetness of soil is estimated
    by the proportion of annual (or monthly) precipitation and evaporation (Shang
    et al., 2007). Daily soil moisture can also be evaluated by the ratio of daily
    precipitation and evaporation in the above perspective. Precipitation is directly
    accessible in the routine weather reports; nonetheless, evaporation can be calculated
    using other metrological essentials. For evaporation, we use an empirical model
    given by Penman (Chen and Chen, 1993) (1) The entire evaporation depends on the
    thermodynamic evaporation and the dynamic evaporation , where depends upon the
    velocity of the land storm, air temperature, relative humidity of the air and
    UV radiation. To achieve water saving, irrigation system frameworks have been
    proposed based on various techniques, e.g., thermal imaging, Crop Water Stress
    Index (CWSI), direct soil water measurements, etc. Thermal imaging is a prominent
    technique for irrigation management and it is based on the shade temperature distribution
    of the plant. In this framework, the status of the water in the plant is checked
    over continuous intervals and irrigation is planned in view of the shade temperature
    distribution of the plant (Wang et al., 2010). In addition, CWSI based framework
    has been proposed for irrigation scheduling of the crops for efficient use of
    water. The observation of CWSI was first characterized more than 30 years ago
    (Idso et al., 1981). O’Shaughnessy and Evett (2010) proposed an automatic irrigation
    scheduling based on direct soil water measurement that utilizes water proficiently
    over manual irrigation system. Allen et al. (1998) suggested evapotranspiration
    (ET) based approach, which is an important parameter to decide crop irrigation
    needs influenced by climate parameters, e.g., solar radiation, relative humidity,
    temperature, wind velocity, and crop features such as phase of the crop growth,
    assortment and plant density, properties of soil, nuisance, and disease control.
    ET-based frameworks can save water up to 42% over time-based water irrigation
    scheduling (Davis and Dukes, 2010). Davis et al. (2009) conducted the investigations
    in Florida and verified that ET‐based watering scheduling controllers are more
    beneficial in term of cost, size and labor requirement for irrigation. ET-based
    irrigation system uses much less water as compared to scheduled practices. Viani
    et al. (2017) proposed a fuzzy logic-based decision support system based on farmer’s
    experience with the understanding of crop condition. This system provides more
    water saving over single-threshold and multi-threshold based irrigation scheduling.
    Gutiérrez et al. (2014) proposed an automated irrigation system using a wireless
    sensor network and GPRS module to save water in irrigation. In this system, a
    network of soil moisture sensors with controller has been installed in a crop
    field for real-time monitoring and irrigation control. Gill et al. (2006) suggested
    a method for soil moisture prediction using support vector machines based on air
    temperature, relative air humidity and soil temperature. Jaguey et al. (2015)
    developed irrigation sensor based on smart phone. For sensing soil moisture, the
    digital camera of smart phone is used to process RGB to gray for estimation of
    ratio between wet and dry area of soil. The ratio of wetness and dryness is transmitted
    via gateway to water motor controller. A Mobile Application (APP) is developed
    to control sensor activity (like wakeup) and to set sensor in sleep mode. Goldstein
    et al. (2017) proposed irrigation recommendations based on machine learning algorithm
    with support of agronomist’s encysted knowledge. It was found that the best regression
    model was Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT) with 93% accuracy in prediction
    of irrigation plan/recommendation. The developed model is helpful to the agronomist’s
    irrigation management. Roopaei et al. (2017) proposed an intelligent irrigation
    monitoring system based on thermal imaging. The proposed technique uses thermal
    imaging camera mounted on Drone. An algorithm is developed using images processing
    techniques for identification of water requirement, Leaf water potential, and
    non-uniform irrigation, which are used for irrigation monitoring. Majority of
    the earlier irrigation systems do not consider the weather forecasting information
    (e.g., precipitation) while making irrigation decisions. It leads to a wastage
    of fresh water, energy and loss of crop growth (due to excess water) when a rain
    is followed immediately by the watering of the crop. To handle such cases, IoT
    based solutions can provide a better decision support for irrigation by utilizing
    weather forecasting information (e.g., precipitation) from the Internet. Further,
    the accuracy of weather forecasting is improving due to the advancement of satellite
    imagery technology. For effective and optimum utilization of fresh water in irrigation,
    it becomes essential to develop the smart irrigation systems based on dynamic
    prediction of soil moisture pattern of the field and precipitation information
    of upcoming days. This paper presents an intelligent system that predicts soil
    moisture based on the information collected from the sensors deployed at the field
    and the weather forecast information available on the Internet. The field data
    has been collected through a self-designed sensor node. The server-side software
    has been developed with node side connectivity along with information visualization
    and decision support features. A novel algorithm has been developed for soil-moisture
    prediction, which is based on Machine Learning techniques applied on the sensor
    node data and the weather forecast data. The algorithm shows improved accuracy
    and less error. The proposed approach could help in making effective irrigation
    decisions with optimum water usage. 2. Methods/Techniques used Prediction of soil
    moisture is vital for effective irrigation management system. The estimation of
    soil moisture depends upon evapotranspiration Hargreaves and Samani (1985) developed
    a method based on temperature and extra-terrestrial radiation to estimate ET0.
    It is expressed as (2) where ET0 = reference evapotranspiration (mm/day); Tmax
    and Tmin = maximum temperature and minimum temperature (°C) and Ra = extra-terrestrial
    radiation (MJ m−2 day−1). Ritchie developed another method for estimation of ET0
    (Jones and Ritchie, 1990) based on temperature and solar radiation. It is expressed
    as (3) where ET0 = reference evapotranspiration (mm/day); Tmax and Tmin = maximum
    and minimum temperature (°C) and Rs = solar radiation (MJ m−2 day−1). When (4)
    Cobaner (2011) developed evapotranspiration estimation method based on Neuro-Fuzzy
    (NF) inference and found that the NF model (based on solar radiation, air temperature,
    and relative humidity) exhibits better accuracy than the combination of solar
    radiation, air temperature and wind speed. From state of art, it has been analyzed
    that prediction of soil moisture is possible using sensors placement at the field
    and weather forecasted data. So, we have considered evaporation of soil moisture
    based on air temperature, air relative humidity, soil temperature, and radiation.
    The parameters are considered for analyzing the soil moisture drain (change/difference)
    pattern based on the recorded data of soil moisture. An IoT based architecture
    (Fig. 1) has been proposed to collect, transmit and process the physical parameters
    (soil moisture, air temperature, air relative humidity, soil temperature, and
    radiation) of farming land along with the weather forecast information to manage
    the irrigation efficiently. Download : Download high-res image (307KB) Download

    based on a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques
    (block diagram shown in Fig. 3 and pseudocode is discussed in Section 3.2.1) has
    been developed using Support Vector Regression (SVR) and k-means clustering for
    estimation of difference/change in soil moisture due to weather conditions. It
    gives good accuracy and less Mean Squared Error (MSE) (Theobald, 1974; “Mean Squared
    Error, 2018’’) in the prediction of the soil moisture of upcoming days with the
    help of sensors data and the weather forecasting data. SVR model has been trained
    using data (air temperature, air relative humidity, soil temperature, radiation,
    and soil moisture difference) collected from field device shown in Fig. 2. The
    Soil Moisture Differences (SMD) of upcoming days have been predicted using trained
    SVR model and the predicted value of SMD is given as input for k-means clustering
    for improving the accuracy of soil moisture difference (centroid value of k-means),
    which is more accurate (Table 2) with less MSE (Table 3). The final predicted
    soil moisture (Table 4) has been used in the development of smart irrigation scheduling
    algorithm (Section 3.2.2) to efficiently utilize the natural rain (precipitation)
    information for effective irrigation. To visualize the predicted soil moisture
    of upcoming days along with precipitation information and to control (start and
    stop) the irrigation, a responsive web portal has also been developed (Fig. 4,
    Fig. 5). Download : Download high-res image (250KB) Download : Download full-size

    Planning Module. Support Vector Regression (SVR) (Drucker et al., 1997) is the
    modified version of Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Hearst et al., 1998), where
    the dependent variable is numerical in lieu of categorical. SVR is a non-parametric
    technique and allows the creation of nonlinear models. The SVR method utilizes
    kernel functions to generate the model. Some of the frequently used kernel functions
    are Polynomial, Linear, Radial Basis and Sigmodal. k-means clustering (Kanungo
    et al., 2002) takes a straightforward and simple methodology to group a given
    information set into a definite number of clusters. The objective is to find k
    centroids, one for each bunch. First, it divides n number of the objects into
    k non-empty subgroups/cluster, and then finds the cluster centroids (mean point)
    of every subgroup/cluster. Then it calculates the distances from every point to
    the centroids and allocate each object to a specific cluster where the distance
    is minimum from the centroid. The process iterates to re-assign the points and
    identify the centroid of the new clusters. 3. The proposed system 3.1. System
    architecture The architecture of proposed IoT based smart irrigation system is
    shown in Fig. 1. It has seven main components, viz., Field data collection device
    with relay switch (Standalone and WSN Scenario); Web service for collecting field
    sensor data; Web service for collecting weather information available online (Internet);
    Web service to control water motor; Soil moisture prediction algorithm; Responsive
    web based interface for real-time monitoring; IoT enabled motor pump. These components
    are grouped into three different layers, i.e. Data collection and transmission
    layer, Data processing & intelligence layer and application layer of IoT (Fig.
    1). These components are discussed in the following sections. 3.1.1. Field data
    collection device Depending on the field requirements, a standalone sensor node
    or a wireless sensor network of the sensor nodes may be deployed. In standalone
    scenario field data collection device consists of four sensors, viz., VH-400 Soil
    Moisture sensor, Soil temperature sensor, DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor,
    and Ultraviolet (UV) Light Radiation sensor based on GUVA-S12SD and SGM8521 Op
    Amp. The output of these sensors is read by an Arduino-Uno, which is connected
    to Raspberry Pi (R-Pi). In R-Pi a program is written in Python language to hourly
    fetch the data from sensors and to store the data in SQLite database, which is
    synched with the server database using developed web service. For large farming
    area, a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) (Ojha et al., 2015) scenario with ZigBee
    (Pandey et al., 2017, Gutiérrez et al., 2014) technology can be implemented in
    which multiple sensor nodes can be planted in the specified area. Each sensor
    node will consist of the sensors similar to the standalone device. The output
    of these sensors is read by an Arduino-Uno connected to ZigBee for sending data
    to Gateway Node (similar to the standalone device with ZigBee connectivity) that
    will aggregate the received data and store it locally in SQLite and also send
    the data to the server using web service. The current analysis (statistical analysis
    of predicted soil moisture and its accuracy is exhibited in Fig. 6, Table 3, Table
    5) has been done with the standalone device. The standalone device is shown in
    Fig. 2. Table 5. Comparison of correlation, R squared and MSE between soil moisture
    values based on the sensor data and the proposed algorithm. Parameter Predicted

    Fig. 6. Graphical representation of the results shown in Table 2. 3.1.2. Web service
    for field sensor data collection The Web service is written in PHP with a light
    weighted REST API to communicate the data between the field device and the server.
    The service is hosted on Apache (Web server) at server machine. The R-Pi sends
    the field data to the server using this web service. This web service can handle
    the network fluctuation/outage during synchronizing the data from the filed device
    to the server with the help of flag settings at the database level. 3.1.3. Web
    service for online weather data collection A web service has been developed in
    Python to collect the weather forecasting data. This web service also aggregates
    the weather forecasting data like temperature, humidity, cloudiness, UV Index
    and precipitation of different web forecasting portal like OpenWeather and AccuWeather
    using API of these portal (Weather API, 2012, API Reference, 2017). These portals
    provide the forecasted information in JSON, XML, or HTML format. The developed
    web service read the forecasted data (JSON format) of the specified location using
    API and store it in MySQL database at the server, which is considered in the prediction
    algorithm. 3.1.4. Soil moisture prediction algorithm An algorithm has been developed
    (Fig. 3) to predict the soil moisture based on field sensors data and weather
    forecasting data using support vector regression model and k-means clustering
    algorithm. The algorithm shows information regarding soil moisture of the upcoming
    days. It also provides irrigation suggestions, based on the defined level of soil
    moisture and predicted precipitation, to save water and energy. The generated
    information by algorithm and device is stored in MySQL Database at the server.
    The algorithm is discussed in detail in Section 3.2. 3.1.5. Responsive web based
    interface for real-time monitoring A responsive web based user interface is developed
    using PHP, MySQL and Bootstrap API for real-time monitoring and scheduling of
    irrigation activities (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). The interface visualizes real-time sensors
    data, predicted soil moisture of upcoming days, and precipitation information.
    Further, it also provides a facility for irrigation scheduling. The user can schedule
    the irrigation at a specified threshold value of soil moisture. The system guides
    to maintain the threshold value based on the predicted pattern of soil moisture
    and precipitation information. The system can automatically start the irrigation,
    which stops after achieving the specified threshold value of soil moisture. 3.1.6.
    Web service to control water motor A web service has been developed on top of
    HTTP protocol to start and stop the water motor. This web service has been accessed
    by Python code in R-Pi to start and stop the water motor. The Python code (running
    on R-Pi) send signal to Arduino-Uno that controls the relay switch to start/stop
    the water motor. 3.1.7. IoT enabled water pump In this module, a water pump is
    connected to a relay switch that is controlled by a Wi-Fi enabled node. The node
    is controlled by the web service through a trigger from the responsive web based
    interface for real-time monitoring. Using this web based interface the water pump
    can be managed remotely in manual and auto modes. 3.1.8. Communication technologies
    used in proposed architecture In the proposed architecture, the WiFi module/Mobile
    data communication module can be used as communication media between the field
    device and the server. In this experiment (Standalone device scenario), a WiFi
    module has been used to send the data to the server. In WSN scenario, ZigBee network
    can be used between sensor node to Gateway Node and then a WiFi module or Mobile
    data communication module can be used to send the data from the gateway node to
    the server. 3.2. Prediction algorithm and data visualization Flow diagram of the
    proposed soil moisture prediction algorithm and the irrigation planning algorithm
    for data visualization and decision support is shown in Fig. 3. 3.2.1. Algorithm

    moisture to start irrigation and maximum threshold (THmax) of soil moisture to
    stop irrigation Step2. Set mode (manual/auto) for irrigation Step 3. If (mode = auto)  {   Read

    setup The main objective of this experiment is to collect the physical parameters
    of a farming land using sensors and to utilize these sensors’ data along with
    weather forecast information for developing an algorithm for prediction of soil
    moisture of the upcoming days. The algorithm uses a hybrid machine learning approach,
    as discussed in Section 3.2, to achieve higher accuracy in soil moisture prediction.
    It provides a probable estimate of soil moisture to plan and provision the optimum
    irrigation. Statistical measures, R squared (Table 5) and Mean Squared Error (Table
    3, Table 5), are used for estimation of accuracy and error rate of the proposed
    algorithm. The experiment shows that a good estimation (close to the actual value)
    of the soil moisture (Table 4), with the help of field data and forecasted information,
    can be utilized for optimum irrigation with an effective utilization of natural
    rain. As described in Section 3.1, one field data collection device (node) has
    been deployed in the garden of our organization to collect the field data (Fig.
    2). The data is collected at the server using the web services. Then, the data
    is analyzed using the proposed machine learning approach (Section 3.2.1). Further,
    a responsive web based interface has been developed for real-time monitoring,
    data visualization and decision support system, and for the scheduling of irrigation.
    Fig. 4 shows the GUI of responsive web based interface for real-time monitoring
    and decision support system, which shows the current soil moisture recorded by
    the sensor, and the predicted soil moisture generated by the algorithm. This information,
    predicted soil moisture and precipitation information, will help user/farmer in
    planning/scheduling of optimum irrigation. Fig. 5 shows the GUI of irrigation
    planning module to schedule the irrigation by setting Irrigation Date, and Threshold
    Levels for Soil Moisture. It works in two modes, viz., auto, and manual, as discussed
    in Section 3.2.2. In manual mode, the user takes the scheduling decision based
    on predicted soil moisture and precipitation information. In auto mode, user sets
    the Soil Moisture Threshold levels, and the system automatically schedules the
    irrigation date based on the predicted soil moisture and weather forecast (precipitation)
    information. For example, if rain is expected on the scheduled irrigation date
    or near to scheduled date, then the system will wait for the rain and it will
    suspend the artificial/manual irrigation or it will start watering (if needed,
    based on the algorithm) the field to maintain minimum soil moisture till the arrival
    of rain. Further, the system can handle the changes in forecasted precipitation
    values. 4. Results and discussion The smartness of the proposed system is dependent
    on the accuracy of the predicted soil moisture (Table 4, Table 5). To verify the
    accuracy of soil moisture prediction algorithm, the hourly field data for air
    temperature, air humidity, soil moisture, soil temperature, and UV is collected
    for three weeks. The three weeks’ hourly data has been averaged out on per day
    basis and the 21 days’ data is divided into a training set (70% of the data) and
    testing set (30% of the data) for applying the proposed algorithm. Initially,
    we have predicted SMD of upcoming days using the proposed algorithm (Fig. 3) and
    the predicted values of SMD has been used in prediction of soil moisture of upcoming
    days. The results are summarized in Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, Table 5. The SVR + k-means
    approach has higher accuracy with lower mean squared error over SVR approach while
    calculating SMD (Table 2 and Table 3). The graph (Fig. 6) shows that predicted
    SMD using proposed algorithm (SVR + k-means) is nearer to actual SMD as compared
    to predicted SMD using SVR only. The SVR + k-means approach has the same accuracy
    with the lower mean squared error over SVR approach in soil moisture prediction
    (Tables 4 and 5). The predicted soil moisture shown in Table 4 has been calculated
    based on soil moisture and SMD of previous day, e.g. soil moisture on 14-11-2017
    is 26.8982 then the soil moisture of the next day (15-11-2017) will be equal to
    the difference of soil moisture on the previous day (i.e., 14–11-2017) and SMD
    difference predicted for 15-11-2017 (Table 2). From the Tables 2 and 3, we have
    observed that the prediction of SMD using SVR + k-means approach gives higher
    accuracy with less MSE as compared to SVR approach, and we have also observed
    the same accuracy (R squared = 96%) with lesser MSE in prediction of soil moisture
    using combined approach (SVR + k-means) (Table 5). It shows that the proposed
    algorithm (based on SVR + k-means) is better as compared to SVR based approach.
    Due to higher accuracy and minimum MSE, SVR + k-means based hybrid machine learning
    algorithm has been used in irrigation planning module. 5. Conclusion The soil
    moisture is a critical parameter for developing a smart irrigation system. The
    soil moisture is affected by a number of environmental variables, e.g., air temperature,
    air humidity, UV, soil temperature, etc. With advancement in technologies, the
    weather forecasting accuracy has improved significantly and the weather forecasted
    data can be used for prediction of changes in the soil moisture. This paper proposes
    an IoT based smart irrigation architecture along with a hybrid machine learning
    based approach to predict the soil moisture. The proposed algorithm uses sensors’
    data of recent past and the weather forecasted data for prediction of soil moisture
    of upcoming days. The predicted value of the soil moisture is better in terms
    of their accuracy and error rate. Further, the prediction approach is integrated
    into a standalone system prototype. The system prototype is cost effective, as
    it is based on the open standard technologies. The auto mode makes it a smart
    system and it can be further customized for application specific scenarios. In
    future, we are planning to conduct a water saving analysis based on proposed algorithm
    with multiple nodes along with minimizing the system cost. Acknowledgements Authors

    growth places greater demands on dwindling water supplies. This is especially
    the case in arid and semi-arid areas like Australia, which is known as the driest
    inhabited continent on earth. Sustainable irrigation management necessitates better
    understanding of water requirements in order to decrease environmental risks and
    increase water use efficiency. Although the water requirements of agricultural
    crops are well established in field and laboratory studies, little research has
    been conducted to investigate the water requirements of urban green spaces. In
    addition, most previous research investigations have focused on the water requirements
    of turf grasses and not on other landscape plant species. Landscape plants can
    include various species of trees, shrubs and turf grasses with different planting
    densities and microclimates. Such complicated environments make measuring the
    water requirements of urban landscapes difficult. This paper reviews previous
    studies and techniques for measuring the water requirements of urban landscapes
    and describes how optimum irrigation management strategies for urban landscape
    vegetation can assist in better water conservation, improved landscape quality
    and reduced water costs. The authors conclude that WUCOLS is a practical approach
    that can provide an initial estimate of urban landscape water demand but ideally
    this should be further refined based on the health and aesthetic condition of
    the urban vegetation. The authors recommend calibration of the WUCOLS estimates
    with an in-situ method such as a soil water balance. Keywords: evapotranspirationurban
    vegetationremote sensingWUCOLSnormalized difference vegetation index 1. Introduction
    A plant''s water requirement is very complex to predict in practice. For agricultural
    crops, in order to achieve optimum yield, irrigation and rainfall should replace
    the total water lost through evapotranspiration. Evapotranspiration (ET) is the
    sum of evaporation and plant transpiration. Evaporation is the movement of water
    to the air from sources such as soil, vegetation interception and water bodies.
    Plant transpiration is the movement of water within a plant and the subsequent
    loss of water as vapour through stomata in its leaves (Rothfuss et al. 2010).
    In many agricultural systems, there is a uniformity of plant density, height,
    vigour and water availability which provide a straightforward approach for evapotranspiration
    measurement, although estimating the water requirements of such environments is
    not without challenge. Various methods of ET measurement, their applications,
    device requirements, advantages, disadvantages and sources of errors have been
    discussed by Rana and Katerji ( 2000) and Allen et al. ( 2011). Rana and Katerji
    ( 2000) categorised three main methods for ET measurement: hydrological approaches,
    micrometeorological approaches and plant physiology approaches. Hydrological methods
    include soil water balances and lysimeter measurements. Micrometeorological techniques
    include eddy covariance and Bowen ratio energy balances. Plant physiological techniques
    usually consist of chamber systems and sap flow measurements. It should be noted
    that all of the above mentioned techniques have been mainly applied in agricultural
    fields or forests with little emphasis on or data collection from urban landscapes.
    In the case of non-agricultural systems and particularly urban landscape vegetation
    systems, the heterogeneous nature of vegetation is the rule rather than the exception.
    A wide variation in vegetation type including trees, shrubs and turfs with different
    densities and leaf area has significant effect on evapotranspiration and water
    loss. This introduces more complexity and uncertainty because of different vegetation
    heights, microclimates, spatial and temporal variability of soil and water characteristics
    and water accessibility. It should be noted that in landscape irrigation, the
    aim is to achieve sustainable health, appearance and growth of plants. In some
    species, irrigation also improves plant defence systems, density, colour of canopy
    and flowers and fruit production. If the landscape is not producing a harvestable
    crop, irrigation volume or frequency can be adjusted to lower levels than those
    otherwise needed for agricultural production (Costello et al. 2000). Also when
    water conservation is an objective, lower level irrigation may also be desirable.
    This review briefly describes the most common methods of evapotranspiration measurement
    and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of each method for estimating plant
    water requirements. The review shows that many of the methods have been developed
    for agricultural crops with a focus on adaption of methods for urban ET assessment.
    With the growing interest in and need for urban green space development, there
    is a need to estimate more accurately ET from urban vegetation to better understand
    water balances in urban systems. In particular, ET estimations for green infrastructure
    (GI) including green roofs, rain gardens and bioretention systems are rare. The
    feasibility and appropriateness of the available methods for urban vegetation
    conditions are therefore discussed and practical methods are recommended. 2 Water
    consumption challenges for urban green spaces The assumption of fully replacing
    water lost to ET has underpinned traditional agricultural irrigation management
    philosophies and practices. A key problem therefore arises for urban vegetation
    because there is essentially no irrigation reference point. At one end of the
    spectrum communities may decide that urban vegetation should only be rain-fed
    and not irrigated and that during dry periods the plants may be allowed to wilt
    or even die. At the other end of the spectrum, it may be desirable to irrigate
    for zero plant stress in much the same way as for agricultural crops. Between
    these two extremes, there is a wide range of possibilities that will be influenced
    by the role of the urban vegetation and its location. For example, obvious signs
    of plant stress may be more tolerable further away from the home or from culturally
    important locations. In the future, sustainable irrigation management in urban
    areas may have to focus on moisture stress management. An insight into this future
    has been experienced across Australia in recent years through mandated water restrictions
    in response to the longest and severest drought on record (Fam et al. 2008). Urban
    green spaces consist of public parks, private gardens, sporting ovals, golf courses,
    residential gardens, street trees, green roofs and other vegetated open areas
    (Barnett et al. 2005). The environmental, social and economic benefits of urban
    green spaces have been widely discussed (van Kamp et al. 2003, Jim and Chen 2006,
    Barbosa et al. 2007, Fam et al. 2008, Millward and Sabir 2011). Urban green spaces
    enhance the environment by modifying air temperature, air quality, building energy
    consumption, micro-climate, biodiversity and soil stabilisation. The social benefits
    of urban green spaces include enhancement of mental and physical health, childhood
    development, social equality, social cohesion and general reduction of crime,
    including juvenile delinquency (Fam et al. 2008). Increasing population density
    and climate-dependent water sources have recently led to water restrictions in
    several countries. This, together with rapid urbanisation increases the necessity
    for water savings in urban green spaces. An efficient water conservation program
    certainly needs a better understanding of urban landscape irrigation requirements.
    In the USA, garden watering is the largest single water consumption accounting
    for between 40% and 70% of total household use (Hilaire et al. 2008) with the
    higher requirement generally being in summertime. The Water Corporation of Perth,
    Australia has surveyed residential water use in 2008–2009 (Murphy 2009). Garden
    irrigation, measured by irrigation controllers, has the highest rank of consumption,
    accounting for 39% of total urban water use. Accordingly, the efficient and precise
    irrigation of urban landscape plants needs to focus on water conservation. Australia
    is highly urbanised, with almost 90% of the population living in cities and towns.
    It consequently has relatively large areas of urban vegetation. However there
    is surprisingly little information on the irrigation requirements of urban green
    spaces and a practical method of measuring the water demand of urban green spaces
    is still lacking. Deficit irrigation is an agricultural water management system
    in which less than 100% of the potential ET can be provided by a combination of
    stored soil water, rainfall and irrigation during the growing season. The successful
    practice of deficit irrigation in agriculture inspired Sachs et al. ( 1975) to
    employ it for urban vegetation as well. They found that the aesthetic quality
    of urban vegetation was not affected by reduced irrigation level although canopy
    size was affected. With water shortages experienced by many countries in recent
    years, the sustainability of urban vegetation has become a priority for urban
    green space management. Optimum irrigation efficiency for urban landscape vegetation
    can be achieved through water stress management of the plants, which considers
    in an integrated way the variability in the soils, microclimates, rooting systems,
    hydraulic conditions, diversity in the plant species and their different water
    requirements. Increasing the efficiency of urban irrigation could also be achieved
    using deficit irrigation, installing “smart” controllers, alternative water resources
    (e.g. recycled waste water or storm water), subsurface irrigation, or efficient
    pressurised systems. But in order to employ any of these approaches, the first
    step is to estimate the water requirements of the plants. From this, combinations
    of the above water conservation techniques can be employed to manage water stress
    and evaluate the sustainability and health of the vegetation (Beeson 2006, Scheiber
    and Beeson 2007). In order to select the appropriate techniques for measuring
    urban landscape water requirements, available methods from agriculture and forestry
    are briefly reviewed. Their advantages and disadvantages for implementation in
    urban conditions are discussed and the practical techniques of ET evaluation in
    urban green space are recommended. 3 Techniques for measuring plant water requirements
    in urban landscapes Measurement of plant water requirements based on plant evapotranspiration
    (ET) principles is categorised here into field measurements, hydrological models
    and remote sensing-based techniques. A variety of methods including soil water
    balances, lysimeter measurements, sap flow measurements, eddy covariance, Bowen
    ratio energy balance method, remotely-sensed energy balances, satellite-based
    ET using Vegetation Indices (VI), chamber systems and scintillometer systems are
    all employed to assess plant evapotranspiration. The advantages and disadvantages
    of the most common methods relating to urban landscape water requirements are
    discussed. The methods have been ordered based on the history and origin of their
    application from the oldest to the most recent ones. 3.1 Soil Water balance Natural
    water circulation, which is quantified by a water balance equation, is the fundamental
    principle for water management (Thornthwaite 1948). A temporal change in soil
    moisture is an indirect approach to determine evapotranspiration as the residual
    term of the soil water balance equation. Measuring changes in soil moisture content
    over periods of time was the main source of evapotranspiration measurement before
    the 1950s (Jensen 2010) but there are few reliable peer-reviewed articles describing
    this early work. Soil sampling and gravimetric analyses are primary techniques
    which have been improved gradually by application of electromagnetic devices or
    modern soil water sensors (Charlesworth 2000). Plant water requirement is supplied
    through soil water storage (ΔS) which is the residual of precipitation (P), irrigation
    (I), upward contribution from the water table or capillary rise (W), surface runoff
    (R) and drainage (D), as shown in Equation 1 (Rana and Katerji 2000, Testi et
    al. 2004, Kizito et al. 2007, Zhang et al. 2008, Scott 2010, Allen et al. 2011).
    This method involves some sources of inaccuracy such as lack of irrigation uniformity,
    spatial variability of soil properties and soil moisture conditions, neglect of
    deep percolation or capillary rise, inaccuracy in sensor calibration and challenges
    in the selection of appropriate sample points. In particular a systematic selection
    of representative sample positions is required. To increase the reliability of
    this technique, care is required for installing monitoring system, and for example,
    the lysimeter for drainage measurement, establishing a local weather station for
    accurate meteorological data collection (particularly for precipitation, solar
    energy and wind function) and ensuring soil moisture measurements are undertaken
    in the active root zones of plant communities. 3.2 Lysimeter A lysimeter is a
    container with a soil volume and a given depth that is either filled with undisturbed
    or disturbed soil (Bhantana and Lazarovitch 2010). It is fully visible, easy for
    inspection and can be automated. The first practical lysimeter was developed in
    1688 in France by De la Hire (Kohnke et al. 1940). Nevertheless it is exceedingly
    sensitive to environmental factors and particularly to different vegetation heights
    inside and outside of the effective drainage area of the lysimeter (López-Urrea
    et al. 2006, Vaughan et al. 2007, Allen et al. 2011), which is characteristically
    high in urban landscapes. An important drawback of lysimeters is that they are
    generally unsuitable for mixed vegetation conditions (García-Navarro et al. 2004).
    The characteristics of local fetch (the distance surrounding a measurement site
    for which response is relatively uniform) are another disadvantage of lysimeters
    (Ben-Gal and Shani 2002, Bhantana and Lazarovitch 2010). Also, the effect of a
    lysimeter on plant root development is quite important. A shallower soil profile
    inside a lysimeter (if the lysimeter is not deep enough) compared to the surrounding
    area results in different volumes of available water inside and outside and subsequently
    different impacts on root development (Allen et al. 2011). Moreover, lysimeters
    are not practical for trees and plants at large spacing due to the difficulty
    in representative sampling. In addition, lysimeters are a point-based measurement
    system and should not be extrapolated. Extrapolating a small sample to be representative
    for the whole area further reduces the accuracy especially for heterogeneous vegetation.
    Moreover, it is complicated to allow for a significant edge-flow effect (Allen
    et al. 2011, Castellví and Snyder 2010). Cameron et al. ( 1990) stated that the
    edge-flow of water in a lysimeter can lead to a significant error in the calculation
    of hydraulic conductivity and leaching rates. However, if the lysimeter is large
    enough, the edge-effect could be negligible. Due to the presence of heterogeneous
    plant communities, geometries, maintenance requirements and other factors, this
    technique is not very practical. 3.3 Sap flow Almost 60 years ago Huber proposed
    using heat as a tracer. In 1937, Huber and Schmidt developed a version of the
    compensation heat-pulse method (Green 1998). The sap flow method is based on a
    source of low grade heat to the plant''s trunk or branch. It determines the water
    flow in the xylem as a result of heat pulse movement or heat energy convection
    in stems (Williams et al. 2004, Allen et al. 2011). This in situ method is inexpensive,
    is easily automated to monitor water stress and is a precise technique to study
    plant eco-physiology and water scheduling. The most important weakness of sap
    flow measurement as applied to landscape vegetation is that it is a point-based
    measurement of evapotranspiration and is rarely representative of mixed vegetation
    conditions. Moreover, the space between probes, the geometry of stems, the variation
    of heat ratio and uncertainty in measuring soil and understory evaporation are
    other sources of errors in sap flow measurements. Although it is a suitable approach
    to determine plant coefficients for individual plants it is generally unsuitable
    for mixed plantings (Rana and Katerji 2000, Wilson et al. 2001, Sellami and Sifaoui
    2003, Kumagai et al. 2005, González-Altozano et al. 2008, Madurapperuma et al.
    2009, Cameron and Mills 2010, Kume et al. 2010, Allen et al. 2011). 3.4 Eddy covariance
    Eddy covariance is a micrometeorological technique to measure high speed fluxes
    of water, heat, gas and momentum in the atmospheric boundary layer. Emission and
    exchange of fluxes is characterised from a fixed in-situ measurement point like
    a tower, or a movable point like an airplane. Field et al. ( 1982) employed traditional
    tools to assess net carbon exchange and this was developed further by Denmead
    et al. ( 1993) for chamber and forest. It is a suitable direct method to study
    mixed vegetation due to the opportunity that a tower (or airplane) provides to
    measure the exchanged fluxes of water, gas, heat and etc between the surface of
    the Earth and the atmosphere in a large area up to 100 hectares. Also it appears
    feasible to predict ET by eddy covariance because it is integrative and does not
    require a species-specific equation so ET can be estimated across the species.
    One disadvantage is that technicians generally need to be well-trained in electronics,
    turbulence theory and biophysics to operate the instruments and to produce quality
    data. Also, a monitoring tower with adequate elevation above the canopy and a
    known uniform fetch are needed. This makes eddy covariance systems expensive,
    particularly since covariance requires accurate measurement of vapour pressure,
    and air temperature or wind speed at different levels above the surface. Also
    they often require corrections including closure errors in the energy balance
    equation (Kosugi et al. 2007, Scott 2010). The high heterogeneity and temporal
    variability of vegetation canopy characteristics in urban areas results in variability
    of emission sources. Anthropogenic heat release (e.g. from buildings and cars)
    is a distinct urban addition to the surface energy balance, which enhances the
    available energy for turbulent fluxes particularly in the transport of heat and
    moisture in urban vegetation. Including consideration of anthropogenic emissions
    when estimating ET of urban landscapes is very challenging (Kotthaussue and Grimmond
    2012). Due to a number of assumptions, instrument problems and physical phenomena,
    measurements are affected by frequency response, sensor time delays, noise, band
    broadening and density fluctuations are other drawbacks of the eddy covariance
    technique (Allen et al. 2011, Burba and Anderson 2007). Instrument calibration
    (Billesbach 2011) and temporal variability in energy fluxes for a planted area
    (Nagler et al. 2005) can be other sources or error. 3.5 Bowen ratio energy balance
    The Bowen ratio energy balance is an automated indirect method of ET determination.
    The concept of the Bowen ratio was developed by Bowen several decades ago but
    practical application of this technique was only common by the 1990s (Malek et
    al. 1990, Fritschen 1993). The method measures the latent heat flux energy budget
    of a surface covered with an actively growing crop. The method is based on Equation
    (2): where λE represents ET in terms of the available energy due to the radiation
    balance, Rn is net radiation, G is soil heat flux and H is sensible heat flux.
    However, it is a simple and inexpensive approach that requires uniform fetch for
    accurate measurement of net radiation and soil heat flux. It also requires an
    adequate elevation above the canopy to collect the required meteorological data
    (Perez et al. 2008, Villa Nova et al. 2007, Yunusa et al. 2004). Sensitivity of
    the instrument bias for gradient and energy balance measurements is another source
    of uncertainty (Todd et al. 2000). The accuracy of ET determination depends considerably
    on the accurate measurement of net radiation and soil heat flux (Allen et al.
    2011, Angus and Watts 1984, Perez et al. 1999). The Bowen ratio energy balance
    method has served as one of the most important methods for forest studies because
    of the ability to measure ET even from non-watered plantation surfaces. Also there
    are fewer problems with energy balance closure, fetch and some other mechanical
    and technical issues compared with more advanced diagnostic procedures and technologies
    (Silberstein et al. 2001, Tanaka et al. 2008). In the urban context, differences
    in vegetation height lead to inaccuracy in gradient measurements above the canopy.
    Another source of error for this method in urban environments is uncertainty in
    measuring net radiation and soil heat flux in heterogeneous conditions. 3.6 Water
    Use Classification of Landscape Plants (WUCOLS) Measuring the total amount of
    water lost through evapotranspiration provides an estimation of the amount of
    water that should be partially or fully replaced by irrigation. Given the formula
    ET crop = Kcrop × ET0, the evapotranspiration rate for any crop can be readily
    calculated from the reference evapotranspiration (ET0) and crop coefficient (Kcrop),
    which is a coefficient corresponding to the effect of crop characteristics on
    water demand of the crop. These two parameters are readily available from in-situ
    measurements or modelling for most agricultural crops. For agricultural crops
    these values are well established from field and laboratory studies. In contrast,
    it is very difficult to determine evapotranspiration values for mixed landscape
    vegetation. Unlike agricultural crops, landscape plants can include various species
    of trees, shrubs and turf grasses with different planting densities and microclimates.
    Establishing a crop coefficient for landscape vegetation in such complicated and
    heterogeneous environments is very challenging. This makes estimation of water
    demands equally difficult. Because of this difficulty, Costello and Jones ( 1994)
    developed the WUCOLS (Water Use Classification of Landscape Plants) method for
    estimating the water requirements of landscape plants. This method assigns numerical
    values to three major factors influencing evapotranspiration from mixed vegetation
    in urban landscapes, namely crop factors, environmental aspects and management
    practices. The resulting calculation produces an estimate of the landscape vegetation
    coefficient, KL. WUCOLS was described in detail by Costello et al. ( 2000). This
    method has been applied in several research studies (Bitar 2004, Pittenger and
    Henry 2006, Mitchell et al. 2009, Spano et al. 2009, Pittenger and Shaw 2010,
    Salvador et al. 2011). According to WUCOLS principles, landscape evapotranspiration
    (ETL) is a function of a landscape coefficient (KL) and reference evapotranspiration
    (ET0), as shown in Equation (3): Unlike crop fields or turf grasses, landscape
    plants are generally a combination of different species of trees, shrubs and turfs
    that are inter-spread with each other. This mixed vegetation with has different
    water requirements but is most often irrigated uniformly or site-specifically.
    To produce a reliable estimation of plant evapotranspiration, a dimensionless
    coefficient for landscape plants as shown in Equation (4) is required to account
    for such variations in species (Ks), density (Kd) and microclimate (Kmc). Certain
    species require significantly more watering than others to maintain their health
    and aesthetic appeal. The species factor explains the differences in water demands
    of various species. Costello and Jones ( 1999) categorised the most common landscaped
    plants in terms of water requirement into four groups, namely high, moderate,
    low and very low water demand and then assigned a numeric value from less than
    0.1 to 0.9 to each of them. The species factor is based only on water use studies
    for landscape species regardless of vegetation type (e.g. tree, shrub, herbaceous
    and mixed plantings). The density factor refers to vegetation density that can
    be measured from the collective leaf area and its specific water losses. Differences
    in vegetation density or canopy cover have a significant effect on the evapotranspiration
    rate and water loss. To account for the differences in canopy cover, three categories
    of low, average and high density were introduced and assigned numeric values of
    0.5 to 1.3 (Costello and Jones 1999). Immature plants with less leaf area and
    canopy cover lose less water in the process of evapotranspiration and are categorised
    as low density while a mixed vegetation of trees, shrubs and turf have more leaf
    area and canopy cover and lose more water so this is assigned a high category
    value. Landscape microclimate is an important factor that may cause different
    environmental conditions. Buildings and paving are typical urban landscapes that
    strongly affect the temperature, wind speed and direction, and humidity. These
    different environmental factors in a specific area with the particular climate
    conditions combine to create a specific microclimate (Bitar 2004). The effect
    of microclimate in plant water loss is estimated through factors that affect the
    energy balance. Kmc is usually attributed a value in the range 0.5 to 1.4. Although
    this approach mostly fulfils the requirements of measuring urban landscape water
    requirements, it is quite subjective particularly in specification of the density
    factor. In order to diminish the subjectivity of density factor determination,
    it is essential to use a reliable technique for considering the size, shape and
    orientation of a vegetation canopy. As a main variable of evapotranspiration estimation,
    due to its key role in energy exchange between the atmosphere and the vegetation,
    several research studies have examined both direct and indirect approaches for
    measuring leaf area index (LAI) (MacFarlane et al. 2000, Kato et al. 2004, MacFarlane
    et al. 2007a, MacFarlane et al. 2007c). Direct methods include destructive sampling,
    the model tree method and litter traps. These three techniques of leaf collection
    combined with planimetric or gravimetric techniques, are more accurate and involve
    stripping and measuring the foliage of plant canopy samples, which on the other
    hand is destructive (especially to smaller plantings) and time consuming. Indirect
    methods include inclined point quadrat, allometric techniques, Multiband Vegetation
    Imagery (MVI), digital photography (hemispherical/fisheye or cover photos), LAI
    2000 canopy analyser, ceptometer, DEMON and Tracing Radiation and Architecture
    of Canopies (TRAC). In contrast, indirect methods are quicker, can be more easily
    automated, and are generally applicable for large areas (MacFarlane et al. 2000,
    Jonckheere et al. 2004). To select appropriate techniques which suit urban landscape
    conditions, several research papers were reviewed. Most recent researchers recommend
    cover digital photography as an uncomplicated, inexpensive, fast, handy and accurate
    technique for measuring crown porosity, crown cover, foliage cover, foliage clumping
    index and leaf area index (López-Serrano et al. 2000, Peper and McPherson 2003,
    Weiss et al. 2004, MacFarlane et al. 2007a, 2007b, 2007c, Fuentes et al. 2008,
    López-Lozano et al. 2009, Osmond 2009, Pekin and MacFarlane 2009, Behera et al.
    2010, Heiskanen et al. 2011, Sprintsin et al. 2011). Digital photography combines
    photography, modelling and image processing techniques to improve canopy modelling
    and vegetation architecture measurement and accordingly vegetation density estimations.
    Fuentes et al. ( 2008) introduced an automated procedure using script written
    in MATLAB (LAIM) to analyse the images. 3.7 Remote sensing It is important to
    estimate vegetation factors accurately since foliage density accounts for almost
    80% of ET (Dalmago et al. 2004). Moreover, the spatial variation of foliage coefficient
    in different sampling positions results from the available species, their maturity
    levels and canopy covers and also the availability of urban landscape features
    such as buildings or paving. These all make the task of measuring vegetation factors
    from the ground surface difficult. Temporal variation of different conditions
    of landscape vegetation also occurs in different seasons e.g. dormancy in winter
    or decreasing chlorophyll pigment production in autumn present some challenges
    in measuring the landscape vegetation factor. However, a satellite image can handle
    this issue by providing the ability to look at the vegetation from above the ground.
    Methods using satellite imagery and energy balance concepts to estimate ET were
    developed around 1990 (Allen et al. 2011). Simpler relationships between ET and
    vegetation indices (VIs) were used from 2005 by Tasumi et al. ( 2005). They asserted
    that the recent development of remote sensing energy balance-based ET models facilitated
    estimation of evapotranspiration and crop coefficient for large areas. They declared
    a strong relationship between crop coefficient factor and Normalized Difference
    Vegetation Index (NDVI) in the mid-season. Remote Sensing (RS) can be used to
    estimate the geographical distribution of evapo-transpiration and water demand
    in large and mixed vegetation areas. The spatio-temporal distribution of surface
    heat flux, evaporation fraction, vegetation index (VI) and diurnal changes in
    land surface temperature are some of the parameters that can be estimated using
    remote sensing techniques (Wang et al. 2007). RS techniques estimate ET through
    satellite imagery of mixed vegetation over large areas. RS can be more economical
    compared with point source measurements with higher spatial resolutions and applicability
    in variable environments (Allen et al. 2011). Tsouni et al. ( 2008) reviewed three
    different RS approaches for ET measurement, namely empirical direct methods, residual
    methods and indirect methods. The stress degree day approach is an empirical direct
    method based on applying RS data into semi-empirical models to characterise vegetation
    water demand from ground measurements for micro-scale areas, while satellite measurements
    are used for macro-scale areas. Residual methods combine empirical models and
    physical components such as METRIC, SEBAL, Sebi, etc. These estimate input parameters
    and evapotranspiration (Courault et al. 2005, Tsouni et al. 2008). Indirect methods
    generally rely on complex modelling of energy budgets. Contreras et al. ( 2011)
    provided another category to estimate evapotranspiration from RS images using
    a physically-based algorithm, surface temperature/vegetation indices and a numerical
    process model of the soil-vegetation-atmosphere relationshipThe surface temperature/vegetation
    index method, which is known as the triangle-trapezoidal method, focuses on the
    spatial distribution of evapotranspiration coefficients. The numerical process
    model of the soil-vegetation-atmosphere relationship (SVAT) involves weather and
    radiation parameters. Allen et al. ( 2011) divided RS approaches for estimating
    ET into two main groups of energy balances and satellite-based ET estimation using
    vegetation indices. The former evaluates energy balances via sensible heat flux
    through different models such as METRIC and SEBAL, mostly coupled with ground
    measurements for calibration. The latter technique simply employs vegetation indices
    to estimate crop coefficients due to the close relationship of vegetation (NDVI,
    VI or LAI) and transpiration. They claimed that the basal coefficient (evaporation
    from soil surface) has a more consistent relationship with NDVI. Allen et al.
    ( 2011) asserted that RS-based or in-situ measurement of energy balance techniques
    is time consuming and requires extensive skills. Torut et al. (2008) used a multi-spectral
    camera to measure canopy cover directly from crops in horticultural sites and
    then compared the results with remotely-sensed NDVI. They asserted that there
    was a high correlation and linear relationship between crop canopy and NDVI and
    they recommended application of remotely-sensed NDVI to predict vegetation water
    demand. Later, O''Connell et al. ( 2010) determined the irrigation demand of citrus,
    grape and almond irrigation sites in Australia by evapotranspiration measurement
    using the SEBAL model. Then the relationship of ET and NDVI was investigated and
    the results showed a strong relationship in all three crops. Trout et al. ( 2010)
    compared two RS techniques of energy balance (SEBAL) and an indirect method using
    vegetation indices in order to predict ET. They recommended that vegetation cover
    can be estimated from satellite-based NDVI for a large variety of crops (Trout
    et al. 2010, Trout 2011). For those areas where in-situ measurements are difficult,
    Sobrino et al. ( 2007) suggested a methodology to estimate evapotranspiration
    from low spatial resolution RS data using an Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer
    (AVHRR). This method involves retrieving ET from low spatial resolution remote
    sensing data and is based on the evaporative fraction concept (Zhou et al. 2006).
    Disadvantages of RS-based methods include the time lapse between satellite captures,
    the high expense to get high resolution images, the uncertainty in estimating
    aerodynamic components and some errors in narrow vegetation areas such as riparian
    corridors (Rana and Katerji 2000, Chen et al. 2005, Courault et al. 2005, McCabe
    and Wood 2006, Min and Lin 2006, Stisen et al. 2008, Boegh et al. 2009, Jiang
    et al. 2009, Mutiga et al. 2010, Wu et al. 2010, Allen et al. 2011). Combining
    satellite image ET estimation methods and ground ET measurement techniques have
    generally enhanced the accuracy of ET measurements (Kustas and Norman 1994, Courault
    et al. 2003, Tsouni et al. 2008). 4 Water requirements of urban systems Sustainable
    urban development necessitates employing an integrated and systematic approach
    to water management for urban vegetation. The social, economic and environmental
    benefits of urban green spaces are undeniable. However, the management of urban
    landscapes should also involve conservation of natural resources, and particularly
    greater efficiency in the use of water. Quantitative estimation of the water requirements
    of landscape plants is very limited but is improving rapidly (Testi et al. 2004,
    AZMET 2005, Pittenger and Henry 2006, Pittenger and Shaw 2007, Dukes 2009, Al-Kofahi
    et al. 2010, Pittenger and Shaw 2010, Schuch et al. 2010, Sun and Kopp 2010).
    However, in urban landscape studies, most attention has focused on turf grasses
    rather than other landscape species (Davis and Dukes 2010, Kilgren et al. 2010,
    AQiser et al. 2011). Available research studies of water requirements of non-turf
    landscape plants are limited to applying the WUCOLS method, focusing on a mixture
    of plant species in California (Costello et al. 2000). Such studies have mainly
    focused on a limited number of species (typically 5–6 species) and were mostly
    conducted in greenhouses, containers or lysimeters. They often considered factors
    such as soil moisture status, plant appearance, gardeners’ judgement and modelling
    but have often not examined other parameters like vegetation canopy cover and
    meteorological effects. These latter parameters will now be considered in more
    detail. Mitchell et al. ( 2001) modelled the urban water cycle using the Aquacycle
    software, substituting stormwater and wastewater for irrigation water resources
    in urban areas including private gardens and public open spaces. In order to quantify
    urban vegetation water requirements, they relied on plant appearance and water
    costs. The decision to irrigate was based on modelled minimum soil wetness. The
    model values that were used to trigger irrigation were 0 for an empty pervious
    store, and 1 for a full pervious store. White et al. ( 2004) stated that using
    potential evapotranspiration modified by landscape coefficient and landscape size
    results in a realistic water budget and this consequently provides a good opportunity
    for water conservation. In another approach for estimation of urban landscape
    water demand, Haley et al. ( 2007) employed an automatic in-ground irrigation
    system. They found that using irrigation controllers, either on a timer-based
    irrigation schedule or triggered by soil moisture sensors, resulted in significant
    water savings. Rosenberg et al. ( 2011) presented a model for estimating the water
    usage of residential and commercial landscapes to encourage property owners to
    save water. The water requirements of non-turf plants were estimated by multiplying
    the average crown diameter of a single plant (or uniform plantation) by evapotranspiration
    (20–80% of ET0). Lowry Jr. et al. (2011) estimated outdoor residential urban water
    requirements using meteorological data to measure the reference evapotranspiration
    and using a plant coefficient of 0.6. Salvador et al. ( 2011) studied the irrigation
    performance of household landscapes involving a mixture of trees, shrubs and turf
    grasses. They employed the WUCOLS method involving species, density and microclimate
    factors multiplied by reference evapotranspiration. They recommended applying
    night sprinkler irrigation and designing different irrigation schedules for different
    landscape areas to be able to save water. 5 Results A number of techniques and
    methods for measuring ET and the water requirements of urban landscape plants
    have been reviewed. These are summarised in Table 1. Some of these are more accurate,
    cost effective or particularly appropriate for certain scales of space and time.
    Mixed plantings of trees, shrubs and turfs, because of their different microclimates,
    species, densities, maturity and size, often have greatly different water requirements.
    Based on effectiveness, accuracy, cost and time limitations and safety, the recommended
    methods are remote sensing and the WUCOLS method with some modification to decrease
    subjectivity. These two approaches provide area-based estimations of ET considering
    mixed vegetation types with different species and densities. Using a local weather
    station will increase the accuracy of the meteorological data and this will improve
    the estimation of water demand. For remote sensing, a simple, quick and easy method
    of soil water balance can be used to validate the satellite image data. Table

    CSVDisplay Table 6 Conclusion Landscape vegetation is an important aspect of the
    urban environment that has many environmental, social and economic benefits (Barbosa
    et al. 2007). In environmental terms, urban landscape vegetation provides biodiversity
    enhancement, as well as habitat and food sources for a broad range of urban fauna.
    Urban vegetation also prevents soil erosion and improves drainage (Barnett et
    al. 2005). It is an air purifier and an air temperature adjuster that can reduce
    the urban heat island effect and can also reduce noise pollution (Millward and
    Sabir 2011). In terms of social advantages, urban landscape vegetation provides
    enhanced recreational amenities. It fosters a connection between residents and
    the natural environment that surrounds them and contributes significantly to sustainable
    and liveable cities. Economic benefits can include increased property prices and,
    in properly designed systems, reduced urban flash flooding (Bitar 2004, Jim and
    Chen 2006, Fam et al. 2008). To achieve these benefits, it is important that more
    attention is focused on sustainable water management of urban landscape vegetation.
    This is particularly the case in situations of water scarcity, where irrigation
    requirements for urban vegetation compete with other water demands. Reviewing
    the available literature on non-agricultural water requirements has revealed a
    limited understanding of irrigation requirements for urban green spaces. This
    could present a significant limitation to the emerging interest in green infrastructure,
    including green walls, green roofs, rainwater gardens and bioretention systems.
    This is beginning to be realised and recent designs of bioretention systems have
    incorporated underlying storage to provide plant roots with access to water between
    irrigation and rainfall events. The authors conclude that WUCOLS is a practical
    approach that can provide an initial estimate of urban landscape water demand
    but ideally this should be further refined based on the health and aesthetic condition
    of the urban vegetation. The authors recommend calibration of the WUCOLS estimates
    with an in-situ method such as a soil water balance. Acknowledgement The authors

  analysis: 'The paper titled “A wireless sensors architecture for efficient irrigation
    water management” presents the development and testing of a wireless sensor node
    for monitoring soil moisture and irrigation water quality. This system utilizes
    a distributed network architecture with individual nodes equipped with multiple
    sensors and connected via GSM/GPRS to a remote server for data storage and analysis.
    The paper highlights the design considerations, power consumption, and field performance
    of the developed system, demonstrating its potential for optimizing irrigation
    practices and improving water management in agriculture.


    In the context of the systematic review''s focus on types of data most applicable
    to irrigation management and their typical sources, this paper contributes by
    providing insights into the use of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for monitoring
    key parameters related to soil water status and irrigation water quality. The
    authors discuss the advantages of using a distributed architecture with individual
    sensor nodes, allowing for flexible installation and maintenance while reducing
    the reliance on a central gateway device. The paper emphasizes the importance
    of selecting appropriate sensors compatible with the system and highlights the
    challenges and considerations involved in optimizing the power consumption of
    the sensor nodes for autonomous operation.


    The paper''s relevance to the review''s point on types of data most applicable
    to irrigation management and their typical sources is moderately relevant. While
    the paper does not explicitly provide a comprehensive overview of various data
    types and sources for irrigation management, it offers valuable insights into
    the use of wireless sensors for monitoring soil moisture and irrigation water
    quality, which are essential parameters for effective irrigation management. The
    paper also touches on the importance of selecting appropriate sensors and optimizing
    power consumption, which are important considerations for practical implementation
    of such systems.


    The paper adequately addresses the key issues pertaining to the review''s point
    on types of data most applicable to irrigation management and their typical sources.
    It demonstrates the potential of wireless sensors for monitoring soil moisture
    and irrigation water quality, providing valuable information for optimizing irrigation
    practices. However, the paper could benefit from a more comprehensive discussion
    of the different types of sensors available for irrigation management and a broader
    perspective on the various data sources beyond soil moisture and irrigation water
    quality.


    Overall, the paper provides a useful contribution to the review''s point on types
    of data most applicable to irrigation management and their typical sources, demonstrating
    the potential of wireless sensors for monitoring key parameters related to irrigation
    management. It receives a relevance score of 0.7-0.79, indicating a very relevant
    contribution that can add substantial value to the review.'

    Highlights • Development of a small, compact and autonomous unit for convenient
    use in agricultural facilities. • Testing and installation of several soil and
    water moisture sensors in conjunction with the developed device to manage the
    irrigation. • Sample and sending rates estimation to accomplish optimal agronomic
    information with a battery powered device. Abstract Water is an essential resource
    for the development of agriculture. In several locations like the south-east of
    Spain water is scarce and its cost is high, so optimal management of this important
    resource is essential. Therefore, the application of irrigation strategies to
    improve the watering process, affects the profitability of crops quite significantly.
    It is necessary to carry out the instrumentation of the variables that affect
    the growing process of the crop (soil, water and plant) and use the techniques
    associated with this instrumentation to take actions to optimize the production.
    The system proposed in this paper uses information and communication technologies,
    allowing the user to consult and analyze the information obtained by different
    sensors from any device (computer, mobile phone or tablet) in an easy and comfortable
    way. The proposed architecture is based on different wireless nodes equipped with
    GPRS connectivity. Each wireless node is completely autonomous and makes use of
    solar energy, giving it virtually unlimited autonomy. Different commercial sensors
    for measuring the wide range of parameters of the soil, plant and atmosphere can
    be connected to the nodes. The data is sent and processed on a remote server,
    which stores the information of the sensors in a database, allowing further consultation
    and analysis of data in a simple and versatile way. Previous article in issue

    optimizationIrrigation management 1. Introduction Irrigated agriculture is the
    biggest consumer of freshwater in arid and semi-arid zones, with a share of around
    70–80% of the total volume of used water. However, increased demand for water
    by other sectors and weather-associated limitations (increasing aridity as a result
    of climate change), suggests that the water resources available for agriculture
    in forthcoming decades will be lower in both quantity and quality. At the same
    time, new growers with lower production costs than the traditional ones in these
    areas are forcing them to reduce costs by lowering their main inputs. It is in
    this area of costs reduction where the efficient use of the water is becoming
    an increasingly important consideration, sometimes at the expense of crop quality.
    However such issues must be addressed if such crops are to remain competitive.
    It is a proven reality that in semiarid zones the limited availability of water
    has contributed to creating increasing interest in water conservation, particularly
    among practitioners of irrigated agriculture. For these and other reasons, the
    scientific- and technical-based irrigation scheduling of water to maintain and
    even improve yield and quality has been and will remain a major challenge for
    irrigated agriculture (Puerto et al., 2013). In recent years, the incorporation
    of sensors in the context of agricultural production for water management and
    conservation has received an increasing interest for establishing irrigation management
    strategies, such as regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) or partial root drying
    (PRD). Both strategies allow very significant increases in irrigation water productivity
    (yield produced per unit of irrigation water applied), especially in woody crops
    (Egea et al., 2009, Jones, 2004, Puerto et al., 2013). However, these strategies
    need several sensors to estimate the plat water status. Most common sensors to
    estimate plant water status are soil sensors, since they provide important information
    that is familiar to the user. These sensors provide data of the matric potential
    (Ψm, soil water status) or volumetric soil water content (θv, soil moisture).
    Over the years, these sensors have evolved significantly since the first manual
    gauges that measured the pressure of the soil water to become ever more effective
    and precise in measuring the soil''s water status and moisture content, integrating
    communication with dataloggers (Fereres and Goldhamer, 1990, Hanson and Edwards,
    2000). In addition to these sensors, measures to control the volume or concentration
    of soluble salts in the irrigation water have often been used in irrigated agriculture,
    especially in arid and semi-arid areas. Water electrical conductivity (EC) is
    important, and irrigation water can be classified as running from excellent (EC
    ≤250 μS cm−1) to unsuitable (EC ≥ 3000 μS cm−1) (James et al., 1982). Moreover,
    it has been demonstrated that the crop production decreases as the EC of the irrigation
    water increases (Maas and Hoffman, 1977). The overall EC (or quality) of the used
    water can be adjusted by using water from different sources, which explains the
    use of sensors that provide measurements of the volume and quality of water held
    in reservoirs. This type of sensor provides useful data for regulating the conditions
    required by each of these irrigation strategies. These sensors have been used
    in conjunction with instrumentation systems to control the irrigation process,
    traditionally with wired dataloggers. In recent years, the quick development of
    wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has led to the use of sensor equipment with very
    little wiring, and great improvements in their installation and maintenance (Hussain,
    2012, Khan et al., 2014, Nolz et al., 2013, Ruiz-Garcia et al., 2009, Yu et al.,
    2013). Wireless sensor networks are composed of different measuring points, called
    nodes, able to communicate wirelessly. The data obtained from each one of them,
    is stored in a sink node and processed for managing irrigation. The ultimate aim
    is to use the data from field sensors towards a fully automatic irrigation system.
    Although a fully automatic system has not yet been achieved, remote irrigation
    management is possible by means of routers and Internet connections that access
    the data collected by dataloggers (wired) or by the sink nodes (WSNs) (Puerto
    et al., 2013). The common point of these systems is that they have a centralized
    communication structure, that is, they depend on a device (gateway) to communicate
    with the user, which can lead to connection problems for the whole system if such
    a device has limited connectivity. Advances in mobile networks and cheaper Internet
    communications (GSM/GPRS, 3G) has led in recent years to the incorporation of
    modules that provide WSNs with access to mobile networks by using machine-to-machine
    (M2M) modules. This feature provides more flexibility in the installation, as
    it is not limited by the connectivity of the sink node or datalogger. Each node
    contains a mobile communication module (GSM/GPRS, 3G) changing the topology of
    the network from centralized to distributed. One of the important advantage of
    this approach is that a connection failure at a node does not affect the normal
    operation of the network. However, the higher energy requirements of the mobile
    communications network represent a complex challenge for the design and dimensioning
    of the instrumentation of the nodes (Sinduja and Sowmya, 2013). This article describes
    the design and dimensioning of a wireless node to fulfill the specified requirements
    of autonomy and reliability, allowing an easy installation and the ability to
    use the wide range of electrical interfaces in agronomic sensors. The results
    obtained in different agricultural scenarios are then used to verify the operation
    of the equipment and the goodness of the agronomic data. 2. Materials and methods
    2.1. Hardware description One of the most important aspects to consider when designing
    a device for monitoring any kind of variable is the ability to cover a wide range
    of significant parameters for the monitored activity that will provide the device
    with the versatility necessary for use in a broad variety of real situations.
    Such measurements are provided by specific sensors that are connected to the device
    by means of a wide range of possible connection interfaces. In the present article,
    a completely autonomous device for estimating the plant water status in several
    scenarios is presented. The device, which must be compatible with a wide variety
    of sensors that provide plant-related data, is based on a modular structure that
    consists of several electronic interconnected boards: 1. An electronic board,
    the Main-Board, which has already been used in other applications, including oceanographic
    monitoring by means of a ZigBee network (Albaladejo et al., 2012). This board
    is responsible for sensors’ data. It is also in charge of communication with the
    rest of the boards and ensures that the whole system is working properly. 2. The
    Sensor-Board provides the interface with the connected sensors. The design of
    the board is optimized for agricultural monitoring, allowing the simultaneous
    connection of a common precision agriculture sensors. 3. The GPRS-Board is in
    charge of establishing the communication with the mobile network by means of a
    GSM/GPRS protocol, sending the data to the remote storage server for further consultation.
    2.2. Control, management and data collection subsystem Fig. 1 shows the flow diagram
    of the Main-board. When it is powered up, the microcontroller obtains the configuration
    information from the SD-Card. This card contains information about the sensors
    connected to the Sensor-Board, the sample period and transmission rate, the GPRS
    and remote server configurations, etc. By simply modifying a few files, the user
    is able to completely change the behaviour of the system, providing great flexibility.
    As soon as the configuration is initialized, the system enters in a sleep mode
    in which the power consumption kept below 600 μA. When the sample rate time has
    expired, the microcontroller is “woken up” by an interrupt signal and the process
    of retrieving the information from the sensors starts. This process is carried
    out by the interface board. Then, the microcontroller obtains the time from the
    RTC and stores all the information in the SD-Card. Next, the system enters the
    sleep mode again and waits for another interrupt. When the sending rate time has
    expired, the Main-Board establishes communication with the GPRS-Board to send
    the information obtained from the sensors to the remote server. This board also
    performs a charging algorithm to optimize battery life, activating and deactivating
    a circuit in the Sensor-Board with the purpose of connecting the solar panel only
    when the battery is outside a specified voltage range. Download : Download full-size

    The Sensor-Board is one of the most important parts of the whole system since
    it provides the interfaces that will determine compatibility with external sensors.
    Given that the SDI-12 interface is one of the most important and standardized
    interfaces in the field of precision agriculture (López et al., 2009), it provides
    great flexibility because a wide range of commercial sensors used in agriculture
    are compatible with it. According to the technical characteristics of the SDI-12
    protocol (SDI-12, 2005). The sensors that use SDI-12 are powered at 12 V. As the
    battery operates in the range of 3.7–4.2 V, a 12 V DC/DC converter was included
    to power every sensor connected to the Sensor-Board, while a 5 V DC/DC was used
    to power the tri-state buffer needed for the SDI-12 interface. This power source
    could also be used to power up sensors. The rest of the sensor interfaces included
    in this board were: • One 4–20 mA interface. • Three voltage interface. • One
    digital pulse interface. Fig. 2 presents the flow diagram of the Sensor-Board.
    In the initial state, the power supplies of the sensors are inactive. As soon
    as the Main-Board enters the reading state, the Sensor-Board warms the sensors
    for 2 s, then starts reading all the SDI-12 sensors, after which it begins reading
    the analogue sensors. Finally the Main-Board stores the data in the SD-Card and
    the Sensor-Board enters the Initial State again. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Flow diagram of the Sensor-Board. 2.4. Communication subsystem The
    communication module is based on the SIM900 GSM/GPRS chip from Simcom Ltd. The
    SIM900 module communicates with the Main-Board by mean of AT-Commands through
    a serial interface. The decision to use GSM/GPRS technology rather than the more
    modern 3G or even 4G is based on two important points: 1. GSM/GPRS is more established
    than any other mobile technology, so its coverage is greater than that of its
    counterparts. Also, the vast majority of the areas that need to be monitored for
    precision agriculture will be located in the countryside, where 3G/4G is not always
    available. 2. Although GPRS/GSM technology is much slower than 3G/4G, the amount
    of data collected at each sampling is so small that speed is not an issue. Moreover
    the power consumption of devices compatible with 3G/4G is much greater than in
    the case of GPRS/GSM – an aspect that is much more important than speed in scenarios
    where the autonomy of the device is of key importance. This module is one of the
    most important parts of the device and allows a change in the topology commonly
    used in WSN, from centralized to distributed. A sink or a gateway node is not
    needed as every device in the network has its own capacity to transmit data by
    Internet. Fig. 3 shows the flow diagram of the communication subsystem. As the
    Main-Board enters the Sending state, the GPRS module is powered up and tries to
    establish connection with the remote server through the mobile network. If the
    communication with the remote server is established successfully, the GPRS-Board
    enters the Sending state, in which the data is processed and sent to the server
    separately in bursts of 1 kB. If any problem occurs during this process, the GPRS
    will enter the inactive mode to save the battery. In this case, the GPRS-Board
    will try to transmit all the data at the next sending time. Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. Flow diagram of the communication subsystem. Fig. 4a shows
    the completely assembled device. In order to guarantee the stability of the network,
    an installation protocol must be followed. Firstly, an analysis of the signal
    power at the point of installation is performed for each mobile operator by means
    of an Anritsu MS2713E spectrum analyzer. The operator with the strongest signal
    will be the most suitable. Using the most suitable GPRS antenna is very important,
    since the sensitivity of the Sim900 module is around −109 dBm (SIM 900 Hardware
    Design Guide, 2010). If the threshold cannot be reached with an internal antenna
    of 2 dB, a 5 dB external antenna should be used instead. This protocol ensures
    high quality GSM/GPRS communications under normal working conditions. Download

    The electronics are located inside an IP-67, a box of reduced dimensions (120
    mm × 122 mm × 75 mm), whose cover is transparent so that the solar panel inside
    is protected from exposure to the weather (Fig. 4b). 2.5. Experimental sites Four
    experimental tests were carried out to analyze the behaviour of the device in
    real scenarios. The data was collected from January 2014 onwards in four commercial
    plantations located in the south-east of Spain. In order to manage the irrigation,
    soil moisture sensors rather than plant based sensors were used because soil moisture
    information is generally more familiar to the farmers. The control variables were
    matric potential (Ψm) and volumetric soil water content (θv) which are common
    in the irrigation management. The criteria for scheduling irrigation used in the
    scenarios 1, 2 and 3 (see below) were decided by the farmer. In scenarios 1 and
    2 the aim was maintain soil moisture conditions equivalent or close to field capacity
    to satisfy the maximum crop water requirements. In the third scenario soil moisture
    conditions depended on the crop phenological stage. In general, Ψm was used to
    decide the irrigation frequency and θv to adjust the gross irrigation doses. In
    scenario 3 it was decided to use a GS3 sensor instead of the 10HS because of its
    robustness, accuracy and easier installation for it to be in close contact with
    the substrate. Table 1 summarizes the main characteristics of the sensors used.
    The different scenarios are described below. Table 1. Summary of the sensors used

    Scenario 1 (woody crop). Fino lemon trees (Citrus limon L. Burm. fil cv. 49.)
    on C. macrophylla Wester, growing in a soil with a low water retention capacity,
    were irrigated in order to optimize the use of the irrigation water based on the
    information provided by the sensors. The soil had a sandy clay loam texture and
    the irrigation water had an electrical conductivity (EC) of 2200 μS cm−1. The
    orchard consisted of 10 year old lemon trees. Tree spacing was 7.0 m × 5.5 m,
    with an average ground coverage of about 47%. Two drip irrigation lines (0.8 m
    apart) were used for each tree row. There were 4 emitters (4 L h−1) on both sides
    of each tree. Two sensor nodes were installed in the 5.5 ha orchard, each one
    with a soil matric potential sensor (MPS-2, Decagon devices, Inc., Pullman, WA
    99163, USA) at a depth of 30 cm and three soil moisture sensors at a depth of
    20, 40 and 80 cm (10-HS, Decagon devices, Inc., Pullman, WA 99163, USA) located
    25 cm from a representative dripper and 2.25 m from the trunk. The device automatically
    took readings of the soil matric potential and volumetric water content every
    15 min. Scenario 2 (vegetable crop). Endive plants were planted in beds with 1.0
    m centres. There were two rows per bed, and plants were spaced 35 cm apart within
    the row (triangular planting). A single lateral tube with 0.2 m between emitters
    and a discharge rate of 5 L h−1 was used to meet their water requirements. The
    irrigation water had an electrical conductivity (EC) of 800 μS cm−1. One sensor
    node was installed in the 2.5 ha plot with two soil matric potential sensors (MPS-2,
    Decagon devices, Inc., Pullman, WA 99163, USA) at depths of 17 and 35 cm, and
    one FDR sensor at a depth of 20 cm (Hydra Probe II, Stevens Water Monitoring Systems,
    Inc., Portland, OR, USA) located 20 cm from a representative dripper and 20 cm
    from the plant. Scenario 3 (greenhouse soilless culture). The test was carried
    out in a plastic greenhouse (800 gauge) using hydrangeas growing in 12 L plastic
    pots containing a substrate mixture (2 parts peat, 1 part coconut fibre and 1
    part perlite by volume). The pots were spaced 50 cm apart within the row and with
    60 cm between two contiguous rows. The irrigation was supplied using a single
    lateral line that had two compensating drippers (2 L h−1) per pot. The irrigation
    water had an EC of 800 μS cm−1. One sensor node with three GS3 sensors (Decagon
    devices, Inc., Pullman, WA 99163, USA) was installed in the greenhouse with one
    GS3 sensor located mid-height in each pot. Scenario 4 (water reservoir). The water
    reservoir monitored, with a 500 m perimeter and a total capacity of 52,000 m3,
    is used to irrigate different fields located nearby. The reservoir receives water
    from a desalination plant and several wells. To keep track of the water level
    and conductivity, a pressure sensor (LMK 807, Sensotec Incorporated, Columbus,
    OH) and a conductivity sensor (ES-2, Decagon devices, Inc., Pullman, WA 99163,
    USA) were used. The pressure sensor was located at the bottom of the reservoir
    and the conductivity sensor 1 m below the water surface. Table 2 summarizes the
    number and type of sensors connected to each node. Table 2. Summary of the sensors
    used on each node. Node type Sensors Empty Cell 10HS HP-2 MPS-2 GS3 LMK807 ES-2

    The information from the sensors connected to the device is periodically sent
    to a data server, where it is processed and stored in a relational database. The
    software architecture of the data server is based around three main components:
    (1) an application developed in Java, which is in charge of communication with
    the nodes, (2) a relational database that stores the data, and (3) a Web application
    to check the information of the sensors. Fig. 5 shows the architecture of the
    system from a functional point of view. The node, after sampling the connected
    sensors, establishes a TCP communication through the GSM/GPRS module with the
    Java application that is being executed in the server. Once the socket of the
    communication is established, the node sends the data in a specific format. The
    Java application manages each connection and even in cases of simultaneity, it
    receives and sends the information of each sensor to a MySQL database. The Web
    application is used to query the database to show selected data to the user. Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Architecture of the system. The flow of the
    Java application is as follows: first, the header of the message, which contains
    information about the identification of the node, its sample rate, the location,
    the sensors connected, etc., is analyzed. Then, the sensor data is checked and
    processed and, if the information is below or above the threshold established
    by the user, an email is sent to warn of a possible incident. The data and the
    exact timestamp sent by the node are stored in the database, while the information
    gathered by the sensors is made available on the Internet through a website. This
    Web application is developed in HTML5, Javascript and PHP, as shown in Fig. 6.

    sensors. The bottom of the figure shows, in graphic form, the information obtained
    from the sensors connected to the device. This allows the desired data to be visualized

    3. Results and discussion 3.1. Agronomic results Fig. 7a–c presents the data concerning
    the soil water content and water status of the crops recorded in the three commercial
    plantations and a water reservoir respectively. The first three figures clearly
    represent the evolution of θv and Ψm, while Fig. 7d plots the evolution of the
    water conductivity and volume of the irrigation reservoir. Download : Download

    and electrical conductivity of irrigation water during the indicated period (76–102
    DOY). Scenery (c) water reservoir. Fig. 7a shows how, as the season progresses,
    the moisture in the root zone of the lemon tree (top 50 cm) increases, while at
    80 cm it decreases slightly. The moisture content from 20 to 40 cm depth reflects
    the high availability of water for the crops, based on Ψm values at 30 cm (Domingo
    et al., 1996). The irrigation strategy is based on maintaining a high level of
    available water in the zone of highest root activity during the critical periods
    of flowering and fruit-setting, while optimizing the use of the irrigation water
    by minimizing deep percolation losses. The high frequency of strong winds (>5
    m s−1) in the area were taken into consideration during the flowering periods.
    To ensure the availability of water in the top 50 cm of soil, two daily irrigations
    (instead of one) were applied after day 95 (Fig. 7a). The total amount of water
    applied in a growing season was 5775 m3 ha−1 in contrast to the 6000 m3 ha−1 applied
    by Domingo et al. (1996). These authors managed the irrigation according to the
    FAO methodology using a Class A evaporation pan. The climatic conditions, irrigation
    system and total yields were similar (≈50 t ha−1). The difference represents a
    water saving of 225 m3 ha−1 with the irrigation controlled by sensors. However,
    the irrigation water quality and annual rainfall presented in the scenario 1 were
    lower than the ones presented by the previous authors (2200 μS cm−1 vs 1250 μS
    cm−1 and 100 mm vs 315 mm for the EC and rainfall, respectively). Considering
    that citrus fruits are salt sensitive (Storey and Walker, 1998) and bearing in
    mind the contribution from rain water, the savings could have been higher. Nevertheless,
    in order to choose one irrigation methods or the other, it would be necessary
    to keep registering the information during at least two more seasons. Endive plant
    requires consistent levels of water (near reference demand levels) throughout
    its rapid growth and final development periods. Reductions in the available water
    during these growth periods can result in reduced leaf development (Maynard et
    al., 1999), so that it is important to maintain the moisture content of the soil
    near field capacity at depths where the root system is located practically throughout
    the growth cycle. Fig. 7b plots the last days of the crop cycle (DOY 76–103),
    illustrating the high Ψm values and the evolution dynamics of the θv. Soil moisture
    (Hydra Probe II) and soil matric potential sensors (MPS-2) show the high irrigation
    frequency and the little variation in the minimum humidity values reached, with
    a slight increasing trend close to harvesting. The information provided by these
    sensors was of great help for maintaining the moisture content of the soil at
    field capacity values at the depths explored by the root system of the crops.
    Fig. 7c shows the evolution of the volumetric water content of the substrate measured
    in three different pots using a GS3 sensor inserted at mid-depth. As can be seen,
    there is no clearly defined pattern as the water content changes constantly. In
    the period 76–103 DOY, θv gradually fell over 8 consecutive days before sharply
    increasing. This was followed by another reduction and then a permanent recovery.
    Regardless of the grower''s irrigation procedure, Fig. 7c shows: (i) similar patterns
    in the water content evolution in the three pots located in different rows, (ii)
    rapid drainage during the final period and (iii) noise-free representation in
    a substrate where others sensors might have contact problems. It must be taken
    into account that good soil drainage in this kind of cultivation practice is essential
    to avoid root rotting. Fig. 7d plots the water conductivity and volume of the
    irrigation reservoir used to irrigate several nearby fields. The ES-2 sensor used
    to measure the conductivity of the water is of key importance to maintain the
    water quality in the desired range. As shown in Fig. 7d, the value of the conductivity
    during the measurement period was below 2200 μS cm−1. The LMK 807 measured the
    volume during the same period. The variation in the EC was evident when taking
    water for irrigation or adding water from the wells and the desalination plant.
    The information shown in Fig. 7d is of great help for mixing the water from the
    different sources to attain the conductivity required levels. 3.2. Power and energy
    consumption results In order to analyze the power consumption of the device, an
    exhaustive energetic analysis of each scenario was carried out to determine the
    most suitable battery and solar panel needed to make the device energetically
    autonomous. A detailed explanation about the power consumption of the woody crop
    node in the worst-case scenario, that is, a sample rate of 10 min and a sending
    rate of 1 h, is given below. The node has eight functional states, numbered as
    follows: (1) initialization and configuration, (2) standby, (3) interface warm-up,
    (4) digital sensor data acquisition, (5) analogue sensor data acquisition, (6)
    SD-Card data storage, (7) GPRS standby and (8) GPRS module transmission. The measurements
    of the current reported in this paper were taken with a YOKOGAWA WT210 digital
    wattmeter and WTVIEWER software. Fig. 8 shows an example sequence of the power
    consumption of the node when the system is functioning. After initialization and
    configuration, the data are collected from the sensors, first from the digital
    sensors and finally from the analogue sensors. After that, the data is stored
    in the SD-Card. The sequence of states (3), (4), (5) and (6), is repeated every
    10 min (sample rate). After 1 h (sending rate), all the sensor data collected
    before and available in the card are sent to the server. After that, the system
    returns to standby mode, until the next scheduled reading process. Download :
    Download full-size image Fig. 8. Woody crop node power consumption. The ultimate
    aim of this study was to determine how much current the device consumes on average,
    so as to relate the resulting figure directly with the capacity of the batteries
    and hence determine the device''s autonomy. The average current consumption of
    the GPRS node may be determined thus: (1) Each of the current components is explained
    in Table 3. To calculate the autonomy of the node, worst-case scenarios were assumed
    for each measurement. Thus, expression (2) shows sensor system consumption in
    standby mode. Eq. (3) expresses the estimated average current consumed by the
    device in the process of initialization. Expressions (4), (5), (6), (7) are calculated
    in the same way. The interval between samplings considered in this study was 10
    min, which is the worst-case scenario regarding energy consumption, although the
    average sampling period in real deployments is 15 min. Expressions (8), (9) are
    calculated in the same way. Table 3. Current components and their description.
    Type of current Description Current consumed in standby mode Current consumed
    in the process of initialization the GPRS node Current consumed with the current
    converters in active mode Current consumed by digital sensors. One MSP-2 for woody
    crop Current consumed by analogue sensors. Three HS10 for woody crop Current consumed
    in the process of storing data in the flash memory Current consumed in the process
    of establishing the connection with the phone cell Current consumed in sending
    of data to the server Considering an average current consumption of 5.93 mA (1),
    the next step is to choose a battery and a solar panel that enables the node to
    be completely autonomous. In order to achieve this, several tests were carried
    out with a wide spectrum of commercial batteries before the decision was made
    to use a LI103450A battery, a 1900 mAh Li-ion rechargeable battery with a nominal
    voltage of 3.7 V, equipped with a protection circuit that prevents overcharging
    as well as deep discharging. With this battery and considering the scenario presented,
    expression (10) estimates autonomy of the woody crop node without solar panels,
    which is around 13.35 days. The Sensor-Board has a circuit that manages the load
    based on the switching of an external solar panel. Using this battery in conjunction
    with a solar panel of 0.8 W (with a rated voltage of 5 V and a rated current of
    160 mA) will allow the node to be completely autonomous even under prolonged poor
    light condition. (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) To test the selected battery
    and solar panel, a validation test was conducted over a period of four months
    (from January to April 2014). A woody crop node was set up in Miranda (Cartagena)
    in a 4 ha mandarin orchard. Fig. 9 shows in detail the voltage recorded over a
    period of 28 days in which the battery voltage was kept between the desired values
    thanks to the solar panel and the charging algorithm. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 9. Woody crop node battery voltage. The consumption of all the nodes
    was also analyzed in Table 4. This Table 4 shows the mean power consumption of
    the device for the different scenarios, considering sampling rate values of between
    10 and 60 min and sending rates from 1 to 12 h. Logically, the higher the sampling
    rate, the more power the device needs to operate and so the power consumption
    is increased. Increasing the sample rate provides more information in less time.
    If the sending rate is reduced, the information will be available sooner but the
    device will be less efficient energetically as very few samples will be sent during
    each GSM/GPRS connection. After analyzing the table, it was concluded that the
    sending rate has a greater effect in scenarios where the power consumption of
    the sensors is low (Irrigation reservoir node, vegetable node); however, in scenarios
    where the sensors have a higher power consumption (woody crop node), the sending
    rate is of little importance for the overall power consumption of the device.

    4, the device sent multiple samples during each connection in order to optimize
    the battery in scenarios where real time is not necessary. Fig. 10 shows the current
    consumption of all the nodes for a sampling rate of 15 min and above, and in case
    that real time information is needed; that is, as soon as the sensor information
    is read, the data is sent to the server, so the information for the user is available
    in real time. In these scenarios, the power consumption increased in every case
    but was still acceptable given the specifications of the device. Download : Download

    paper describes the design, optimization and development of a practical application
    to optimize water resources in irrigated agriculture by monitoring soil water
    status and the irrigation water. The article shows the technical challenges addressed
    in terms of WSNs and GSM/GPRS network communications, the sensors used and their
    configuration and energy optimization in a system based on a distributed architecture.
    To highlight the effectiveness and accuracy of the developed system, several case
    studies have been presented with the aim of analyzing the behaviour of the device
    in real scenarios. It is concluded that the sensor nodes are of great help to
    reach the desired moisture conditions at the different depths and to maintain
    water electrical conductivity level of the irrigation reservoir at the desired
    value, thus contributing to the ability to adapt the irrigation strategy according
    to each situation. The development of a small, compact and autonomous unit is
    of key importance for convenient use in agricultural facilities, so as not to
    interfere with field operations, avoid the theft of material and allow installation.
    To make the system compatible with commercial sensors, it has been necessary to
    adapt the device to the different interfaces adopted by sensors’ vendors. The
    sampling rate of the sensors and sending rate using a GPRS connection is important
    considerations when estimating the power consumption of the device. In the performed
    tests, the sampling rate was adjusted to 15 min and the sending rate to 30 min.
    These rates are considered a good choice for correct agronomic decisions and for
    maintaining the complete autonomy of the device with an adequate battery and solar
    panel power. Acknowledgments The development of this work was supported by the

    113 SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract Soil moisture plays a critical role in improving
    the weather and climate forecast and understanding terrestrial ecosystem processes.
    It is a key hydrologic variable in agricultural drought monitoring, flood forecasting,
    and irrigation management as well. Satellite retrievals can provide unprecedented
    soil moisture information at the global scale; however, the products are generally
    provided at coarse resolutions (25–50 km2). This often hampers their use in regional
    or local studies. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Soil Moisture
    Active Passive (SMAP) satellite mission was launched in January 2015 aiming to
    acquire soil moisture and freeze-thaw states over the globe with 2 to 3 days revisit
    frequency. This work presents a new framework based on an ensemble learning method
    while using atmospheric and geophysical information derived from remote-sensing
    and ground-based observations to downscale the level 3 daily composite version
    (L3_SM_P) of SMAP radiometer soil moisture over the Continental United States
    at 1-km spatial resolution. In the proposed method, a suite of remotely sensed
    and in situ data sets are used, including soil texture and topography data among
    other information. The downscaled product was validated against in situ soil moisture
    measurements collected from two high density validation sites and 300 sparse soil
    moisture networks throughout the Continental United States. On average, the unbiased
    Root Mean Square Error between the downscaled SMAP soil moisture data and in-situ
    soil moisture observations adequately met the SMAP soil moisture retrieval accuracy
    requirement of 0.04 m3/m3. In addition, other statistical measures, that is, Pearson
    correlation coefficient and bias, showed satisfactory results. Key Points Downscaled
    SMAP soil moisture at 1 km provides opportunities for fine resolution hydrologic
    modeling with operational implications The method uses a suite of atmospheric
    and geophysical information The downscaled SMAP is validated against measurements
    collected from core validation sites and 300 sparse soil moisture networks 1 Introduction
    Soil moisture has an important role in the global water and energy balance, affecting
    hydrological and atmospheric cycles, drought conditions, irrigation management,
    and so many other processes. Over the last decade, the development of remote sensing
    technologies has provided the possibility that this environmental variable is
    more accessible than before. Nowadays, remotely sensed satellite products have
    become the only feasible way to reach an unprecedented amount of soil moisture
    data on both spatial and temporal scales, which is practically unachievable from
    in situ observation networks (Kerr, 2007; Njoku & Entekhabi, 1996; Peng et al.,
    2016). In the last couple of decades, although prodigious efforts have gone to
    retrieving soil moisture through various active and passive microwave remote sensing
    satellites, inevitably, they have some limitations. For example, active sensors
    like the European Remote-Sensing Satellite (ERS) provide observations that are
    significantly affected by the scattering produced by surface roughness (Verhoest
    et al., 2008) and vegetation structure (Wagner et al., 2013). Unlike the active
    sensors, passive microwave radiometers are much less sensitive to scattering,
    but their products are at coarse resolutions or their sensing depths are shallow
    (Molero et al., 2016). For instance, the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth
    Observing System with C-band of 6.9 GHz has footprint of 74 × 43 km2 that provides
    soil moisture from the 0–1- or 0–2-cm topsoil layer, while with smaller footprints,
    its X-band penetration depth is less than 5 mm (Su et al., 2013). In contrast,
    through L-band radiometer, the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) can estimate
    soil moisture at around 5-cm depth with a repeat cycle of ~3 days. This satellite
    has a coarse spatial resolution (35–55 km2), which makes it inappropriate for
    local and regional scale applications (Djamai et al., 2016). Recent studies have
    shown that both the passive and active sensors have to come into play in order
    to access reliable remotely sensed soil moisture data (Owe et al., 2008; Petropoulos
    et al., 2015). Launched in 2015, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
    (NASA) Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite provides high-resolution
    soil moisture on a global scale by combining L-band (passive) brightness temperatures
    and high resolution L-band (active) radar backscatter data (Entekhabi, Njoku,
    et al., 2010). Unfortunately, due to a malfunction of the SMAP radar instrument
    on July 2015, since then the radiometer instrument has been the only operational
    instrument of SMAP satellite and been providing the level 2 soil moisture product
    (L2_SM_P; Chan et al., 2016). The assessment of SMAP radiometer observations corroborates
    the effectiveness of this procedure against Radio Frequency Interference (RFI)
    signals. Over densely vegetated areas where SMOS is more prone to RFI contamination,
    SMAP is more capable of retrieving soil moisture (Chan et al., 2016). Using brightness
    temperature, SMAP satellite provides soil moisture on the 36-km grid cell from
    both ascending (6:00 pm) and descending (6:00 am) passes. Although the SMAP soil
    moisture observation has a decent spatial resolution for global and continental
    scale applications, it cannot be used directly for regional or local studies,
    such as agriculture and drought monitoring, unless a fine resolution of this product
    is available (from 1 to 10 km2; Entekhabi, Njoku, et al., 2010). To circumvent
    this problem, on January 2017, NASA released a new product named the enhanced
    SMAP radiometer. In this data set, the standard SMAP data gridded at 36 km are
    interpolated into 9-km grid spacing using the Backus-Gilbert optimal interpolation
    algorithm. Despite such progress, some land surface applications such as water
    resources management, agricultural, and crop production still require soil moisture
    at finer resolutions, from a kilometer to subkilometer scale. Over the last few
    years, a large number of approaches have been developed to downscale the coarse
    resolution of different satellite soil moisture products, such as SMOS (Djamai
    et al., 2015, 2016; Lievens et al., 2016; Merlin et al., 2008; Molero et al.,
    2016; Panciera et al., 2008; Piles et al., 2011, 2014, 2016) and Advanced Microwave
    Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (Choi & Hur, 2012; Sahoo et al., 2013;
    Song et al., 2014; Zhao & Li, 2013). Among these attempts, Machine Learning (ML)
    techniques have recently received remarkable attention owing to their superb intelligence
    capability in downscaling satellite products (Alemohammad et al., 2018; Coulibaly
    et al., 2005; Goyal et al., 2012; Hashmi et al., 2011; Im et al., 2016; Kaheil
    et al., 2008; Kolassa et al., 2018; Raje & Mujumdar, 2011; Rodriguez-Fernandez
    et al., 2015; Srivastava et al., 2013; Valverde et al., 2014; Zerenner et al.,
    2016). ML is a class of data analysis methods that allows computers to find the
    hidden pattern of a phenomenon through learning from data in an intelligent way.
    More investigations have shown that Random Forest (RF) algorithm in comparison
    with other ML approaches is more suitable for downscaling the satellite products
    (He et al., 2016; Hutengs & Vohland, 2016; Im et al., 2016; Jing et al., 2016;
    Ke et al., 2016; Park et al., 2017; Pelletier et al., 2016). This is due to the
    fact that RF model is much more flexible through randomization and adopts an ensemble
    approach. In this paper, we use the RF model in order to downscale the standard
    SMAP soil moisture radiometer product gridded at 36- to 1-km resolution over the
    Continental United States (CONUS) for the year 2015 (April to December). In this
    study, we develop multiple RF models based on soil properties of topsoil (0–5
    cm) and use them collectively to better estimate the soil moisture not only at
    a finer spatial resolution but also over a very large region with different climate
    and land surface characteristics. The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
    Section 2 summarizes both satellite and ground-based observations used in this
    research and describes concisely the study area. Section 9 elaborates on the developed
    soil moisture downscaling approach. The results and discussions are included in
    section 12. The conclusions of this paper and recommendations for future works
    are in the final section of the paper. 2 Remotely Sensed and Ground-Based Observations
    2.1 SMAP Radiometer Soil Moisture Data SMAP satellite with a sensing depth of
    5 cm provides soil moisture on a global scale. Over the CONUS, SMAP was calibrated
    and validated against in situ measurements collected from several Core Validation
    Sites (CVSs) with the aim of reducing the unbiased Root Mean Square Error (ubRMSE)
    below 0.04 m3/m3 (Colliander, Jackson, et al., 2017; Jackson et al., 2016). In
    this study, we propose a soil moisture downscaling framework to downscale the
    SMAP descending overpass (L3_SM_P) over the CONUS. The L3_SM_P is a daily composite
    of L2_SM_P product. This soil moisture data can be assessed from the NASA Distributed
    Active Archive Center at the National Snow and Ice Data Center. We use the soil
    moisture product entitled “SMAP L3 Radiometer Global Daily 36 km EASE-Grid Soil
    Moisture, Version 3 (SPL3SMP)”, which is available at https://nsidc.org/data/smap/smap-data.html.
    2.2 MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Normalized Difference Vegetation
    Index (NDVI) Over the past few years, vegetation index and surface temperature
    have been widely used for downscaling satellite soil moisture data (Fang & Lakshmi,
    2014; Im et al., 2016; Merlin et al., 2008, 2015; Peng et al., 2015; Piles et
    al., 2011; Song et al., 2014; Srivastava et al., 2013). These land surface parameters
    are available from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument.
    The common use of this geostationary satellite is due to its high temporal resolution
    that provides more cloud-free observations. The MODIS is a key instrument of the
    NASA Earth Observing System Terra and Aqua platforms for monitoring the seasonality
    of global terrestrial vegetation. MODIS is a multispectral sensor. Its spectral
    bands range from visible, near infrared, to thermal infrared, making it ubiquitous
    in many land, ocean, and atmospheric research studies. The equatorial crossing
    time for Terra and Aqua satellites are 10:30 am (descending) and 1:30 pm (ascending),
    respectively. In this study, in order to be consistent with the SMAP data, the
    daytime overpass for Terra in the descending node is used to collect MODIS Land
    Surface Temperature (LST) and NDVI data. The MODIS products are the version-5
    MODIS-Terra 1-km resolution daily LST data and the version-5 MODIS-Terra 1-km
    resolution 16-day NDVI data (data sets MOD11A1 and MOD13A2, respectively). MOD11A1
    is composed of daytime and nighttime land surface temperatures. MOD13A2 is atmospherically
    corrected data set. The MODIS products are retrieved from the NASA Land Processes
    Distributed Active Archive Center at the United States Geological Survey (USGS)
    Earth Resources Observation and Science Center (http://e4ftl01.cr.usgs.gov/MOLT/).
    2.3 NWS Precipitation Data The most obvious way the atmosphere affects soil moisture
    is through precipitation (Crow et al., 2012). The soil moisture spatial and temporal
    variations are strongly correlated with the precipitation patterns. The teleconnection
    of precipitation regimes on the soil moisture variability has been corroborated
    by many studies at regional and global scales (Jones & Brunsell, 2009; Seneviratne
    et al., 2010). In this study, National Weather Service (NWS) precipitation data
    along with other atmospheric and geophysical information are used to investigate
    the usefulness of these climate variables in estimating soil moisture at finer
    resolution. The NWS operations at the River Forecast Centers provide quality controlled
    and multisensor precipitation data with a spatial resolution of roughly 4 km2
    over the CONUS, Puerto Rico, and Alaska. The data are presented at 24-hourly accumulation
    that is the end of the “hydrologic day,” a standard for river modeling. This product
    is primarily used to simulate streamflow across the CONUS (http://water.weather.gov/precip/).
    2.4 CONUS-SOIL Data Soil texture is defined as the proportion of small (clay),
    medium (silt), and large (sand) particles in a specific soil mass. This property
    of soil significantly affects the soil moisture profile, since it influences water
    infiltration rate, permeability, and water storage. Soil texture heterogeneity
    dominates the soil moisture spatial structure (Mattikalli et al., 1998). Many
    studies corroborated the utilization of soil texture data as an important source
    of information for downscaling soil moisture maps (Chakrabarti, Bongiovanni, et
    al., 2016; Mascaro et al., 2011; Ranney et al., 2015; Reichle et al., 2001; Shin
    & Mohanty, 2013). In this study, we use soil texture information from the CONUS-SOIL
    data set. CONUS-SOIL data set is specifically used for regional climate and hydrologic
    modeling over the CONUS (Miller & White, 1998). This product is available at 1
    km, which generates a spatial representation of soil texture and other properties
    of soil surface for a wide range of land surface models. CONUS-SOIL discretizes
    each soil property in 11 depth layers (up to 250 cm) where each layer is classified
    by 12 standard soil texture classes. Since SMAP provides soil moisture at the
    top 5 cm of the soil column, we only use the first layer of soil with depth of
    5 cm to extract the soil texture information. Supporting information Figure S1
    illustrates the soil texture of top 5-cm soil layer over the CONUS. CONUS-SOIL
    is available in both gridded and vector formats and can be retrieved via http://www.soilinfo.psu.edu/.
    2.5 GTOPO30 Topography Data Topographic data such as slope, aspect, curvature,
    and elevation significantly affect the distribution of soil moisture, specifically
    in the topsoil layer, at different scales (Crow et al., 2012). Elevation is known
    as one of the most effective topographic features in many studies to downscale
    coarse-scale soil moisture maps (Busch et al., 2012; Coleman & Niemann, 2013;
    Mascaro et al., 2011; Pellenq et al., 2003; Ranney et al., 2015; Wilson et al.,
    2005). Hence, we use this variable in our proposed approach to downscale the SMAP
    soil moisture data. GTOPO30 is a global Digital Elevation Model developed by USGS
    Earth Resources Observation and Science Data Center in late 1996. This data set
    has an approximately 1-km spatial resolution. Figure S2 shows the Digital Elevation
    Model with colors representing the variation of elevation from 0 to 4,587 m above
    sea level. More information along with the data set can be found at https://lta.cr.usgs.gov/GTOPO30.
    In this study, we used this data set, although there are other topography data
    products available, such as Shuttle Radar Topography Mission and National Elevation
    Dataset, which alternatively could be used. 2.6 In Situ Soil Moisture Observations
    The U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN) sensors provide the soil information,
    such as soil moisture and soil temperature, at five different depths (5, 10, 20,
    50, and 100 cm). Figure S2 demonstrates the USCRN stations located at 114 sites
    across the CONUS. The grid spacing of these sensors was determined so as to competently
    represent the U.S. annual temperature and precipitation variance. The soil moisture
    and soil temperature for each station are obtained from three independent samples
    of soil located in a 5-m radius around the main instrument tower. This leads not
    only to an accurate measurement of such quantities but also yields a more realistic
    representation of soil properties in a specified location. The USCRN records the
    soil moisture profile at 5-min intervals and transmits them as hourly data for
    satellite calibration/validation purposes. The Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN)
    sensors monitor soil moisture content at five different depths (5, 10, 20, 50,
    and 100 cm approximately), air temperature, relative humidity, and some other
    climate variables mainly over the agricultural areas. In this study, we use 186
    SCAN sensors that have been in operation for the period of the study. The SCAN
    sensors measure the soil moisture values hourly to aid different applications
    such as drought assessment/monitoring and satellite soil moisture validation.
    Both USCRN and SCAN sensors report the soil moisture in the volumetric unit (m3/m3).
    Figure S2 shows a map of SCAN soil moisture sensors located at 186 sites throughout
    the CONUS. USCRN instruments are scattered uniformly across the United States,
    while SCAN stations are installed in certain areas to accommodate specific research
    needs (Coopersmith et al., 2015). These two soil moisture networks have also been
    used for the validation of SMAP product (Jackson et al., 2016; Pan et al., 2016;
    Velpuri et al., 2015). 3 The Proposed Satellite Soil Moisture Downscaling Approach
    This section elaborates the developed methodology in two separate subsections.
    In section 9, we present the theoretical basis of the proposed downscaling framework.
    Section 10 explains the ensemble learning algorithm used in section 9. 3.1 Soil
    Moisture Downscaling Framework To downscale SMAP radiometer soil moisture, we
    use those high-resolution data sets that are known to be strongly associated with
    the soil moisture spatial and dynamical heterogeneities. As discussed in the previous
    section, the covariates including NDVI, surface temperature, precipitation, elevation,
    and soil texture are available at the appropriate resolutions and expected to
    have reasonable explanatory power on the soil moisture profile at different scales.
    Atmospheric covariates (i.e., precipitation and surface temperature) are used
    to maintain the temporal dynamics of the downscaled soil moisture. Geophysical
    covariates (i.e., soil texture and elevation) are included to capture the spatial
    patterns and variability of the downscaled soil moisture. Auxiliary covariates,
    such as NDVI (as a measure of greenness), are also included to account for the
    influence of vegetation dynamics on the downscaled soil moisture spatial and temporal
    patterns. In this study, we use RF as an ensemble learning approach to formulate
    the downscaling framework. The basis of this technique and its implementation
    will be explained in detail later in section 10. The main contribution of this
    research is to introduce a new way to incorporate the aforementioned atmospheric
    and geophysical variables into the RF model, leading to improved estimates of
    soil moisture at finer resolutions. The following steps summarize the structure
    of the proposed soil moisture downscaling scheme. Classify the in situ soil moisture
    stations (i.e., SCAN and USCRN) according to their soil texture properties. The
    results are shown in Table 1. As mentioned in section 5, only the soil texture
    of the top 5-cm soil layer is used in this study in order to be consistent with
    the SMAP''s sensing depth. Further investigation indicates that SCAN and USCRN
    in situ stations are distributed proportionally to be representative of different
    climate conditions and soil texture classes over CONUS. The study area is mostly
    dominated by loamy (24.5%), silty loam (24.3%), and sandy loam (22.6%) surface
    soil layers. These land surfaces encompass more than 200 stations for the soil
    moisture monitoring. Sandy clay loam, silty, and sandy clay soil types altogether
    cover less than 0.5% of the CONUS area. Only one station was found from the entire
    installed instruments throughout the CONUS that monitors the soil moisture for
    these rare land surfaces. As shown in Table 1, sandy loam with 22.6% surface soil
    coverage comprises 72 stations across CONUS, while clay loam with 4.2% encompasses
    12 instruments. The same analogy can be applied to those regions characterized
    by sandy and loamy sand soil textures. This implies a relatively fair distribution
    of soil moisture instruments over the CONUS. It should be noted that some of the
    land surface layers are not considered in the proposed downscaling model since
    they either do not incorporate soil moisture stations (e.g., silty and sandy clay)
    or they include nonsoil layers (e.g., bedrock and water). Overall, these land
    surfaces cover a negligible (less than 0.5%) portion of the CONUS area. Table

    CONUS = Continental United States. As shown in Table 1, there are nine stations
    installed throughout the CONUS whose prevailing soil type is clay. It is important
    to know that these stations are not necessarily located on clay soil layer. Indeed,
    these stations are situated in the regions whose dominant soil type within a 1-km
    grid cell is clay. Using those classified in-situ stations in the first step,
    we develop 12 distinct RF models. Each of these will downscale the SMAP radiometer
    soil moisture over a specific land surface layer. For example, for the clay soil
    type, nine stations provide a data collection with 2,448 rows and 6 columns. The
    2,448 is calculated by 9 × 272, where 272 refers to the period of study (1 April
    2015 until 31 December 2015). Six columns indicate five input covariates (including
    NDVI, surface temperature, precipitation, elevation, and SMAP soil moisture data)
    and one output variable (in situ soil moisture data). The dimension of this data
    set may decrease if it contains missing values. It is important to note that the
    input data are extracted from those points (latitudes and longitudes) where the
    in situ stations are located. In this study, we randomly separate 80% of the data
    collection to train the model, and the rest of the data (20%) is used to verify
    the model. By trial and error, we found that this set of model calibration and
    verification data set (80/20), although not significant, results in better model
    performance as compared to other combinations. The random splitting of the data
    set ensures that the developed model is able to generalize well to unseen data
    and to avoid overtraining. Thus, the developed RF model can be well suited for
    the soil moisture prediction at different geographical locations with different
    land-atmosphere characteristics. The CONUS area is divided into different subregions
    based on the soil texture of the top 5-cm soil layer. The results in percentage
    of CONUS was reported in Table 1. The SMAP soil moisture over each of these regions
    is downscaled to 1-km spatial resolution using the corresponding calibrated RF
    model in step 2. 3.2 RF The principle of the proposed downscaling approach is
    to build a function that maps the input covariates to the output variable using
    the following equations: (1) (2) where SMd is the downscaled soil moisture data
    (response), C is an input vector, ci represents the input covariates (i.e., precipitation,
    surface temperature, elevation, original SMAP, and NDVI), and N is the input vector
    dimension (in this study N is equal to 5). In this formulation, depending on the
    relationship between response variables and input covariates, f can be a nonlinear
    or a linear function. Although implementation of such regression-based model is
    easy, one drawback of this model is that it generally provides a single estimate
    and does not represent the uncertainty associated with the estimates. The approach
    taken in this study to characterize the uncertainty in our downscaling is the
    ensemble learning approach, such as RF. The idea of searching over random subset
    of decision rules while splitting nodes was first initiated by Amit and Geman
    (1997); later on, Breiman (2001) developed this idea and introduced the RF. RF
    is a ML technique, which is most appropriate for regression and classification
    problems. The adaptive, randomized, and decorrelated features of decision rules
    involved in RF make it more suitable approach when the relationship between the
    predictors and the response variable is complex and highly nonlinear. For a regression
    problem, first, a number of decision trees are built during the training phase,
    and then the mean prediction of these trees is calculated as the output of this
    approach. RF divides the input feature space into many regression trees, known
    as forest, where each tree is generated using a bootstrap sample. A bootstrap
    sample contains about two thirds of the training input data, and the left samples
    (one third) are used for the validation of each tree. This is one of the key features
    of RF algorithm (also known as out-of-bag samples) to estimate the model generalization
    error. This approach is based on the bagging (bootstrap aggregation) method that
    combines the results of many decision trees to reduce the chance of overfitting
    and improve the generalization. RF can be easily implemented in a parallel computing
    platform, which makes it more advantageous for large-scale problems (Breiman,
    2001). As previously mentioned, we randomly split the data set into two groups
    (using the 80% of data) to train and (using the 20% of data) to verify the RF
    model. The random splitting of the data set for model calibration and verification
    ensures the generalizability of the developed downscaling approach. In step 1,
    a bootstrap method is used to sample M subsets from the training data sets. In
    step 2, M independent regression trees are built to train the model using the
    bootstrapped samples. In step 3, the predicted value is obtained over M replications.
    In step 4, the final result is taken as the average of the individual tree outputs.
    This model selects a random subset of predictors in each decision tree to inject
    randomness in the RF model, which in turn alleviates the redundancy of predictors
    and diversifies the forecast decision trees (He et al., 2016). The ensemble posterior
    is calculated by averaging M posteriors as follows: pt(SMd| C) specifies the conditional
    distribution of the downscaled soil moisture (SMd) given the bootstrapped samples
    from the training input covariate vector (C). (3) In this study, we used MATLAB
    TreeBagger built-in function to implement the RF algorithm. In the developed downscaling
    framework, each of the 12 RF models has been set to have 100 decision trees. This
    value was obtained using trial and error method, such that any value more than
    this does not improve the downscaling accuracy. This issue will be further discussed
    in the next section. Up to this point, we developed multiple RF models to map
    input covariates to a target variable. The next step is to implement the calibrated
    models on the test data sets to evaluate the model robustness and generalizability.

    and Discussions In this study, we discuss the results in three parts. Section
    12 reports the performance of the developed RF models. Section 13 presents the
    comparison of the downscaled SMAP soil moisture products versus 300 sparse soil
    moisture networks throughout the CONUS. In section 16, the downscaled SMAP soil
    moisture data are validated against in situ soil moisture measurements collected
    from two CVSs. 4.1 Performance of the Proposed Downscaling Algorithm In this study,
    we used the Pearson correlation coefficient “R” (Gan et al., 2014), “ubRMSE” (Entekhabi,
    Reichle, et al., 2010), and bias to measure the performance of the proposed downscaling
    algorithm. R is a common index to measure the strength of a linear association
    between two quantitative variables. The Pearson correlation coefficient is calculated
    at a 95% confidence level and ranges between −1 and 1. The bias measures the average
    tendency of overestimation (positive value) or underestimation (negative value)
    of the simulated data. The ideal value of bias is 0, showing a more accurate model
    simulation. The standard “RMSE” is very sensitive to biases in either the mean
    or the amplitude of variations. This bias can easily be removed by using the ubRMSE.
    The ubRMSE is a metric that SMAP uses to report the product accuracy. For soil
    moisture retrievals, the aforementioned metrics provide a more comprehensive description
    of product quality compared to other measures (Jackson et al., 2012). The SMAP
    mission requirement for soil moisture product accuracy is ubRMSE = 0.040 m3/m3
    (Chan et al., 2016). As mentioned earlier, the first step in developing the proposed
    downscaling scheme in this study is to calibrate and verify the RF models using
    the atmospheric and geophysical data sampled from locations where in situ observations
    are available. The distribution pattern of in situ soil moisture sensors over
    CONUS according to their soil texture properties makes it possible to develop
    12 RF models to downscale soil moisture over more than 98% of the CONUS area.
    Figure 2 illustrates the performance of the developed soil moisture downscaling
    algorithm. Here we reported only the results of the verification step, which implies
    the ability of the calibrated models to generalize to unseen data. The statistical
    performance measures shown in this figure indicate that there is a very good agreement
    between the simulated and observed soil moisture values over different soil texture
    classes with different land-atmosphere couplings. In this study, we noticed that
    using only a single RF model would have generated a significant bias in model
    prediction and led to a worse model fit; however, as results indicate, multiple
    RF models classified based on the stations'' soil texture properties simultaneously
    minimize the bias throughout the simulation process and enhance the model performance.
    The developed models based on those regions with abundant soil moisture stations
    (i.e., loamy, silty loam, and sandy loam) would be more reliable to predict the
    soil moisture and less prone to uncertainty than those areas with limited soil
    moisture sensors (i.e., silty clay and sandy clay loam). We also realized that
    although increasing the number of decision trees from 10 to 100 in random forest
    algorithm does not show significant improvement in model calibration and validation
    steps, it does so in downscaling step and generating the downscaled soil moisture
    data with higher accuracy. Also, it should be mentioned that using more than 100
    decision trees does not enhance the downscaling accuracy and instead only makes
    the proposed approach computationally more intensive. Figure 2 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Verification results of the developed Random Forest models for
    each group of soil texture over Continental United States. ubRMSE = unbiased Root
    Mean Square Error. In the next step, these calibrated and verified models will
    be used to downscale the SMAP radiometer soil moisture from 36- to 1-km spatial
    resolution over CONUS for the period of 1 April 2015 to 31 December 2015. 4.2
    Downscaled SMAP Soil Moistures Versus In Situ Observations In this section, we
    compare the downscaled SMAP soil moistures at 1-km spatial resolution with those
    SCAN and USCRN in situ soil moisture observations scattered throughout the CONUS.
    Figure 3 reports the results indicating a consistently high correlation between
    the downscaled SMAP and in situ soil moistures almost everywhere across the CONUS
    except for a few isolated points with slightly low correlation in the Rocky Mountains.
    The same analogy and pattern is discernible for ubRMSE. The CONUS average correlation
    and ubRMSE values are highlighted in each subplot in Figure 3. The average correlations
    between downscaled SMAP and in situ data are 0.65 (SCAN) and 0.70 (CRN). The average
    ubRMSE is reported as 0.047 and 0.040 m3/m3, respectively, for SCAN and USCRN
    networks. More investigation also reveals a negligible amount of bias between
    the downscaled SMAP product and in situ observations. Such that the average bias
    is reported at 0.004 and 0.002 m3/m3, respectively, for SCAN and USCRN networks
    (not illustrated in Figure 3). These results are encouraging compared with those
    obtained from original SMAP soil moisture products as they show overestimation
    over arid regions with bare soils and underestimation over cold vegetated areas
    (Ma et al., 2017). Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Correlation and ubRMSE
    calculated between in situ observations (SCAN and USCRN) and downscaled SMAP.
    ubRMSE = unbiased Root Mean Square Error; SCAN = Soil Climate Analysis Network;
    USCRN = U.S. Climate Reference Network; SMAP = Soil Moisture Active Passive. For
    a few instruments on the East and West coasts, the model failed to meet the SMAP
    accuracy requirement (8 stations out of 300, not shown in Figure 3). The reason
    behind this may be attributed either to RFI signals that would contaminate the
    soil moisture retrievals over the stations located in densely vegetated areas
    or to the spatial mismatch of the SMAP footprint. Each of these cases may create
    an obstacle to retrieving the SMAP soil moisture data. For example, “CA Bodega
    6 WSW” is one of those eight stations, which is located on the Pacific West Coast
    at Bodega Bay, California. This station is occupied by sandy soil. The SMAP pixel
    over this region may have been more susceptible either to the attenuation of microwave
    signal by the vegetation or to flooding due to heavy rainfall throughout the year.
    Hence, the SMAP pixel for this region is most often missing or discarded by the
    SMAP data quality flag, which leads to a worse downscaling result over corresponding
    in situ stations. Despite such limitation, the downscaled SMAP soil moistures
    correlate well with in situ observation networks over almost entire CONUS, including
    those mountainous and forested areas in the Eastern and Southeastern United States.
    These areas are generally challenging for retrieving soil moisture due to the
    attenuation of microwave signal by the vegetation. Figure 3 also implies the better
    performance of downscaled SMAP soil moisture over bare soils in comparison with
    vegetated soils. Although the reported results are promising, they may not be
    fully indicative of the effectiveness of the proposed downscaling algorithm; therefore,
    we compare the results from the proposed approach with those obtained from a uniform
    disaggregation approach, where the value of fine-resolution grid cell is set to
    be the same value as its correspondent coarse-resolution grid cell. Figure 4 illustrates
    this comparison and shows that the proposed downscaling approach significantly
    outperforms the uniform disaggregation approach. Figure 4 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Comparison of downscaling accuracy between the proposed approach and
    the uniform disaggregation approach. Both Soil Climate Analysis Network and U.S.
    Climate Reference Network in situ observations were used in this analysis. ubRMSE
    = unbiased Root Mean Square Error; SMAP = Soil Moisture Active Passive. To analyze
    the importance of each input variable, that is, NDVI, surface temperature, precipitation,
    and topography, on the downscaling accuracy, we performed a leave-one-out approach
    where one input variable was removed and the downscaling was implemented. Therefore,
    the proposed downscaling algorithm is run under four different input schemes as
    follows: Scheme 1. {NDVI, surface temperature, precipitation} + SMAP. Scheme 2.
    {NDVI, surface temperature, topography} + SMAP. Scheme 3. {surface temperature,
    precipitation, topography} + SMAP. Scheme 4. {NDVI, precipitation, topography}
    + SMAP. Figure 5 reports the results in four subplots. All three performance measures
    are also shown in this figure. The results confirmed that NDVI, surface temperature,
    and precipitation have almost similar influence on the downscaling accuracy; however,
    topography shows to be less influential than other variables on the results. By
    comparing the results in Figure 4 (where all input variables were taken into account)
    with those in this figure, it is seen that the inclusion of all input variables
    in the downscaling framework is essential for achieving the best downscaling accuracy.
    It is important to note that since the objective of this study is to downscale
    SMAP product, SMAP data must be included in all four input schemes. Figure 5 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint The performance of the proposed downscaling approach
    under four different input schemes. Both Soil Climate Analysis Network and U.S.
    Climate Reference Network in situ observations were used in this analysis. ubRMSE
    = unbiased Root Mean Square Error; SMAP = Soil Moisture Active Passive. In Figure
    6, we use the Taylor (2001) diagram to provide a conclusive comparison between
    the performance of the downscaled SMAP by the proposed approach and the in situ
    soil moisture measurements at daily time scale collected from 186 SCAN and 114
    USCRN stations scattered across the CONUS. The Taylor diagram graphically summarizes
    several important statistical indices to compare the similarity/dissimilarity
    between two patterns. This figure can be generated using three statistical metrics.
    Root Mean Square Difference (RMSD) is extensively used to assess the performance
    of satellite soil moisture products versus in situ measurements (Merlin et al.,
    2015). This metric integrates the three main components, namely, time series correlation,
    mean bias, and bias in the variance to evaluate the quality of data. The standard
    deviation ratio between the downscaled and in situ soil moisture is on the radial
    distance, and their correlation is on the angle of the polar plot. The black point
    shown in Figure 6 is named as the reference point, where all the metrics are considered
    optimal. The distance to this point indicates the centered normalized RMSD between
    the downscaled soil moisture and in situ soil moisture patterns. Figure 6 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint The accuracy of downscaled Soil Moisture Active Passive
    soil moisture versus in situ soil moisture observations collected from 186 SCAN
    and 114 USCRN stations for study period 01 April 2015 to 31 December 2015. RMSD
    is represented by green dashed line, while correlation coefficient is displayed
    by blue dotted line. SCAN = Soil Climate Analysis Network; USCRN = U.S. Climate
    Reference Network. The Taylor diagrams are showing most of the correlations above
    0.7 for both SCAN and USCRN networks. It is also evident that most of the standard
    deviation ratios are less than 1 (black-dashed line in Figure 6), indicating the
    higher variability of in situ data compared to the downscaled data across almost
    all the stations in CONUS. It is, however, noted that a few stations end up inflating
    the standard deviation ratio. Further investigation revealed that the SMAP satellite
    has had poor performance over those sites due to the severe spatial heterogeneity
    (e.g., climate, topography, soil texture, vegetation, and land cover) that dominates
    the corresponding satellite''s footprint. 4.2.1 Downscaled Soil Moisture Temporal
    Dynamic The most reliable soil moisture downscaling technique should be able to
    satisfy two important criteria: first, the downscaled soil moisture estimates
    must capture the temporal dynamics of in situ soil moisture observations (Mishra
    et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2015; Piles et al., 2014), and second, the spatial
    pattern of the downscaled soil moisture data must follow that of the original
    soil moisture map (Kaheil et al., 2008; Kim & Barros, 2002; Piles et al., 2011;
    Sanchez et al., 2012). To investigate whether the downscaled soil moisture product
    would meet the temporal variability criterion, in this section, we evaluate the
    performance of the downscaled SMAP soil moisture by the proposed approach at three
    different SCAN in situ soil moisture stations located in different climate regimes.
    Figure S3 depicts these stations and their adjacent environment. The vegetation
    condition and climate regime of these three locations are summarized here to explain
    the downscaled soil moisture performance analysis. As mentioned earlier and is
    seen from Figure S3, although these in situ measurements do not represent the
    soil moisture heterogeneity within the SMAP footprint, they do represent the surrounding
    vegetation and land cover types. Station 2027 (Figure S3a) is instrumented in
    the Little River Experimental Watershed in Tift County, Georgia, where the prevailing
    climate is humid subtropical providing abundant rainfall throughout the year.
    The land use is a mixture of forest, crops, and pasture. Station 2198 (Figure
    S3b) is located in Whitman County, Washington. This region is mostly dominated
    by grassland and pasture and experiences a mild and temperate climate. October
    through April are the wettest months (often in the form of snow), while August
    is the driest month. Station 2217 (Figure S3c) is located in the semiarid Monocline
    Ridge area in Fresno County, California, where the climate is mostly characterized
    by hot and dry summers and mild and moist winters. In this area, the majority
    of precipitation falls during winter. Monocline Ridge is an uninhabited and unvegetated
    region. Temporal variations of soil moisture from the downscaled SMAP (at 1 km),
    original SMAP (at 36 km), and in situ observations are illustrated along with
    precipitation (daily mean) in Figure 7, and their performance is evaluated using
    three statistical metrics, that is, R, ubRMSE (m3/m3), and bias (m3/m3). The detail
    information of each instrument including the station ID, soil texture type, and
    the location name are displayed in this figure. The black-dotted line and purple
    and blue points are indicating, respectively, the in situ soil moisture at 5 cm,
    the original SMAP soil moisture at top 5 cm, and the downscaled SMAP soil moisture
    time series. Although both SMAP products closely follow the precipitation patterns,
    their consistency against the in situ soil moisture observation differs based
    on the land-atmosphere characteristics. For example, in Tift County, Georgia,
    both original and downscaled SMAP data could well track the dynamics of the drying
    and wetting of soil moisture caused by precipitation. The original SMAP soil moisture
    noticed a significant amount of bias (Bias = 0.077 m3/m3) compared to the downscaled
    one (Bias = −0.008 m3/m3). This may be due to the station''s location where the
    dominant soil type is relatively well-drained loamy sand causing rapid soil drying
    after the precipitation event. The downscaled SMAP could capture this pattern
    properly, while the original SMAP failed to do so. The same analogy can be seen
    in Whitman County, Washington. In this station, the original SMAP underestimated
    the soil moisture almost throughout the whole period of study. This problem was
    mitigated by the downscaled SMAP soil moisture. Figure 7 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Time series, scatter plot, and CDF of original and downscaled SMAP
    soil moisture data versus in situ observations at top 5-cm depth. SCAN = Soil
    Climate Analysis Network; SMAP = Soil Moisture Active Passive; ubRMSE = unbiased
    Root Mean Square Error; CDF = Cumulative Distribution Function. As mentioned above,
    although both SMAP products are reasonably able to reproduce the in situ soil
    moisture temporal dynamics, the original SMAP product may severely bias the soil
    moisture estimates. This issue was more clearly observed in the station 2217,
    which is located in Fresno County, California, where the original SMAP overestimated
    the soil moisture almost all days over the study period. This is mainly because
    fine- and coarser-resolution soil moisture observations often ignore the role
    of spatial scale differences in explaining differences between in situ and satellite
    soil moisture. In particular, the soil moisture dynamic range decreases by moving
    from small to large scale. The proposed downscaling algorithm is able to remove
    the systematic bias from the SMAP soil moisture when rescaling it to a finer resolution.
    For all three stations investigated here, the Cumulative Distribution Function
    in Figure 7 shows that the Cumulative Distribution Function of the downscaled
    SMAP perfectly matches with that of the in situ measurements. This further supports
    the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in rescaling the coarse-resolution
    SMAP soil moisture, while reducing the mismatch between that and in situ observations.
    The statistical measures that are reported in this figure indicate that great
    improvement was made by the downscaled soil moisture data. It is worth mentioning
    that although the original SMAP soil moisture retrievals are validated using those
    stations that are not within the USCRN and SCAN soil moisture networks (at the
    time of study), they are in good agreement with these sparse in situ stations
    (Zhang et al., 2017). In Figure 7, the correlation coefficient and ubRMSE calculated
    between the original SMAP and in situ observations imply this link between the
    two. 4.2.2 Downscaled Soil Moisture Spatial Heterogeneity Up to this point, we
    discussed how the downscaled soil moistures could capture the mean and amplitude
    of variations of in situ observations over different geographical locations with
    different land-atmosphere regimes. The ensuing task is to investigate the spatial
    consistency between the coarse- and fine-resolution soil moisture maps. The soil
    moisture spatial pattern is dependent on the heterogeneity of soil parameters
    (e.g., soil texture, vegetation, and topography) that are generally not distributed
    homogenously in the area. This results in an uncertainty in the soil moisture
    retrievals, which consequently affects the downscaled soil moisture accuracy (Piles
    et al., 2011). Here we try to assess the extent to which the downscaled soil moisture
    map could fill this gap and contribute to decreasing the discrepancy between the
    spatial variability of soil parameters and soil moistures. Figure 8 demonstrates
    an example of the original SMAP soil moisture data and the downscaled soil moisture
    on 27 April 2015, over the western CONUS. This figure also illustrates the land
    cover distribution. Figure 8 indicates that the spatial pattern of downscaled
    SMAP soil moisture (Figure 8c) closely follows the spatial heterogeneity of soil
    parameters such as vegetation cover (Figure 8a) and topography (previously shown
    in Figure S2). Likewise, the downscaled soil moisture data (Figure 8) closely
    matches the spatial pattern of the original soil moisture data (Figure 8b) across
    almost the entire western CONUS. Discrepancies between the original and downscaled
    data mostly occur in densely vegetated areas (i.e., evergreen and deciduous forests)
    where the SMAP soil moisture is prone to underestimation due to the attenuation
    of microwave signal by vegetation. Figure 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint (a)
    Land cover distribution over the western Continental United States, (b) original
    SMAP soil moisture at 36-km spatial resolution, and (c) downscaled SMAP soil moisture
    at 1-km spatial resolution on 27 April 2015. SMAP = Soil Moisture Active Passive.
    According to Figure 8, the downscaled SMAP soil moisture shows comparatively more
    water content in the topsoil layer than original SMAP. This is because the downscaled
    soil moisture at 1 km is obtained based on the soil moisture at point scale. Therefore,
    the fine-resolution SMAP product will lead to a lower soil moisture, similar to
    the one observed by SMAP satellite, if it is averaged to a coarser spatial scale.
    Another plausible reason behind this, is the fact that SMAP is measuring a large-scale
    average, and the averaging process dissipates anomalies more rapidly compared
    to the point (in situ) scale, leading to a faster drydown time scale (Shellito
    & Small, 2017; Shellito et al., 2016). Here the downscaled SMAP soil moistures
    are obtained using the model that is calibrated by in situ observations. It was
    found that the downscaled soil moistures are slightly wetter than the original
    SMAP product following rainfall events while correlating well with the in situ
    observations. Chen et al. (2017) showed that although SMAP retrievals underestimate
    soil moisture, they capture its dynamics well. Therefore, our conclusion is consistent
    with that of Chen et al. (2017). The downscaled SMAP soil moistures generated
    in this study are shown to track the dynamics of in situ observations well and
    clearly capture the spatial heterogeneity of soil parameters with high spatial
    correspondence to the original SMAP soil moisture data. The accuracy of downscaled
    soil moisture product in this study appears to be very good as compared to, for
    example, Mishra et al. (2018), who reported the CONUS average correlation between
    the thermal-infrared downscaled SMAP (passive) and SCAN is around 0.54, while
    in this study, the correlation between the downscaled SMAP product and SCAN networks
    is 0.65. However, it is noted that the successful use of a downscaling approach
    may be restricted to its certain characteristics and needs of a user, knowing
    that each method may have certain strengths and weaknesses (Chakrabarti et al.,
    2015, 2018; Chakrabarti, Judge, et al., 2016; Colliander, Fisher, et al., 2017).
    For example, in the work by Colliander, Fisher, et al. (2017), the authors proposed
    a disaggregation approach to downscale the SMAP soil moisture over a small domain
    (including three 36-km SMAP pixels), where the surface temperature is controlled
    by soil evaporation, the topographical variation is relatively moderate, and the
    vegetation density is relatively low. 4.3 Validation of Downscaled SMAP Soil Moisture
    Product In these subsections, we evaluate the accuracy of downscaled SMAP soil
    moisture against two densely instrumented watersheds located in two different
    geographical zones in CONUS. In addition, in order to fully assess the performance
    of the proposed downscaling algorithm, similar to section 13, the results are
    also compared with those obtained from the uniform disaggregation approach. 4.3.1
    Study Area (1): Little Washita River Watershed The Little Washita River Watershed
    is located in southwest Oklahoma in the Great Plains region of the United States
    and comprises an area of 610 km2. A wide range of textures covers the watershed''s
    surface layer, of which, sandy clay loam is the most dominant. There is a network
    of 20 in situ soil moisture stations distributed evenly over the entire watershed.
    This is called the Agricultural Research Service''s Micronet. These stations are
    equipped with capacitance probes that record the soil moisture at a depth of approximately
    3 to 7 cm with an hourly measurement interval. Many of these sensors also provide
    surface temperature measurements. In this study, the data set was collected daily
    for the period of 01 April 2015 to 31 December 2015 in order to be consistent
    with the period of available SMAP satellite data. 4.3.1.1 Validation Results Based
    on Little Washita River Watershed The results reported in Table 2 indicate that
    the downscaled SMAP soil moisture product matches well with the in situ observations
    for the majority of stations, except for a few stations (121 and 136) that are
    located along the mainstream of the watershed at low altitudes, hence more prone
    to accumulation of soil moisture storage. Despite this concern, the majority of
    stations located within the watershed are showing satisfactory results (Table
    2) which further validate the effectiveness of the RF approach. For the proposed
    downscaling method, the average values of ubRMSE, bias, and R across all stations
    are reported 0.035 m3/m3, −0.009 m3/m3, and 0.824, respectively, which are better
    than those from the uniform disaggregation approach. As seen in Table 2, the ubRMSE
    value for all soil types are less than the SMAP mission accuracy target of 0.04
    m3/m3 (Jackson et al., 2016). However, for the uniform disaggregation approach,
    this value slightly exceeds the SMAP accuracy requirement. Table 2. Comparison

    not only captures the spatial distribution of soil moisture (as shown in Table
    2) but also adequately monitors its temporal dynamics. The time series of downscaled
    SMAP soil moistures versus in situ observations at 20 Micronet stations were examined.
    The results showed that the downscaled soil moistures across all 20 stations closely
    follow the dynamics of in situ observations and precipitation pattern, such as
    dry-down and wet-up periods. For example, Figure 9 illustrates time-series comparisons
    between the downscaled SMAP soil moistures and in situ observations from a few
    selected stations (i.e., station 148, 124, 131, and 149) between 01 April 2015
    and 31 December 2015. Figure 9 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Daily in situ

    4.3.2 Study Area (2): WGEW The Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed (WGEW) is one
    of two Agricultural Research Service experimental watersheds on western rangelands
    located in the southeastern Arizona with an area of 149 km2. The predominant soil
    surface over this watershed is loamy. There are 19 soil moisture stations (identified
    as RG##) uniformly situated inside the watershed monitoring soil moisture every
    30 min at a depth of approximately 3 to 7 cm. These sensors also measure soil
    temperature and precipitation. In this paper, the data sets are collected daily
    (hourly averaged) from 01 April 2015 to 31 December 2015, so as to be consistent
    with the time period of the current study. 4.3.2.1 Validation Results Based on
    WGEW The results reported in Table 3 imply a satisfactory performance of the downscaled
    SMAP soil moisture product versus in situ observations for the majority of stations,
    except for a couple of stations (e.g., stations RG076 and RG092) situated close
    to the outlet of the watershed. The reason behind this may be attributed to the
    locations of these stations which were determined to accommodate the hydrologic
    research objectives of the watershed, not to validate the satellite soil moisture
    data products (Colliander, Cosh, et al., 2017). In the proposed downscaling method,
    the average values of ubRMSE, bias, and R across all stations (0.029 m3/m3, 0.008
    m3/m3, and 0.637) are found to be more accurate than those from the uniform disaggregation
    approach (0.039 m3/m3, −0.002 m3/m3, and 0.517). More importantly, on average,
    the ubRMSE value for this watershed (0.029 m3/m3) is much lower than the SMAP
    mission accuracy target of 0.04 m3/m3. This indicates a successful application
    of the proposed algorithm for downscaling satellite soil moisture data. We examined
    the temporal variation of downscaled soil moisture data set and found that they
    are able to capture the dynamics of in situ observations well. Further investigation
    also revealed that discrepancies between downscaled and in-situ soil moistures
    mostly occur during the North American Monsoon season when the spatial distribution
    of soil moisture over WGEW is more heterogeneous. Table 3. Comparison Between

    in Figure 10. It is observed that the proposed downscaling approach outperforms
    the uniform disaggregation approach for all performance measures used. It is also
    noted that when the downscaled SMAP soil moisture (or the original SMAP) is compared
    with in situ observation for validation purposes, an unavoidable significant discrepancy
    between these two sets of data exacerbates the analysis. This is due to inherent
    properties of each observation. SMAP measures a large-scale average of soil moisture,
    while in situ station measures soil moisture at specific point. Even if all CVS
    in situ observations within the downscaled or original SMAP grid cells are averaged
    to represent the soil moisture, significant differences are still to be expected.

    a new framework based on an ensemble learning algorithm to downscale SMAP radiometer
    soil moisture from its native resolution of 36 km to a finer resolution of 1 km
    while using atmospheric and geophysical information acquired from high-resolution
    remote-sensing data and ground-based observations. The data sets used in the proposed
    model have been widely utilized in many studies for rescaling satellite soil moisture
    data and are similar to those ancillary data used in SMAP level 2 Enhanced Passive
    Soil Moisture Product (L2_SM_P_E) and standard L2_SM_P (Chan et al., 2017). This
    study was performed for the period of 9 months (01 April 2015 to 31 December 2015)
    over the CONUS. The validation results based on in situ soil moisture measurements
    collected from two CVSs and 300 sparse soil moisture networks confirmed that the
    downscaled SMAP soil moistures would adequately meet the SMAP soil moisture retrieval
    accuracy requirement (ubRMSE = 0.040 m3/m3) and capture the spatial heterogeneity
    of soil parameters and dynamics of in situ soil moisture observations. The downscaled
    soil moisture data obtained from the proposed downscaling approach is also compared
    with those from the uniform disaggregation approach over both CVSs and 300 soil
    moisture networks, and in all cases, the proposed approach outperformed the uniform
    disaggregation approach. The results of this study also revealed that the inclusion
    of all input variables would result in best downscaling accuracy; however, the
    topography data were found to affect the results less than other input variables.
    The other merit of the proposed methodology is that it is not restricted to boundary
    conditions such as semiarid or humid regions, and it can be applied over a large
    area with different climatological patterns and soil characteristics. The proposed
    rescaling model was calibrated using 300 sparse in situ soil moisture sensors
    evenly distributed over the CONUS. Future works may consider using other in situ
    observations from different operational networks, such as COSMOS (Zreda et al.,
    2012) and GPS (Larson et al., 2010), and some others available from the International
    Soil Moisture Network (Kim et al., 2017) for model calibration and validation
    purposes. Acknowledgments Partial financial support for this project was provided

    are eager to apply recent technological advancements, such as sensors and actuators,
    in different application areas, including environmental monitoring, creation of
    intelligent buildings, and precision agriculture. Technology-assisted irrigation
    for agriculture is a major research innovation which eases the work of farmers
    and prevents water wastage. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are used as sensor
    nodes that directly interact with the physical environment and provide real-time
    data that are useful in identifying regions in need, particularly in agricultural
    fields. This paper presents an efficient methodology that employs WSN as a data
    collection tool and a decision support system (DSS). The proposed DSS can assist
    farmers in their manual irrigation procedures or automate irrigation activities.
    Water-deficient sites in both scenarios are identified by using soil moisture
    and environmental data sensors. However, the proposed system''s accuracy is directly
    proportional to the accuracy of dynamic data generated by the deployed WSN. A
    simplified outlier-detection algorithm is thus presented and integrated with the
    proposed DSS to fine-tune the collected data prior to processing. The complexity
    of the algorithm is O(1) for dynamic datasets generated by sensor nodes and O(n)
    for static datasets. Different issues in technology-assisted irrigation management
    and their solutions are also addressed. Topic: Energy Management in Buildings

    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction Water is an important
    resource and must be used efficiently. The agriculture sector is the main water
    consumer; it uses approximately 70% of all available water resources worldwide
    [1]. This sector’s consumption will be controlled if modern technology is adopted
    with traditional irrigation procedures, particularly flooding. However, in this
    sector, modern technologies are accepted only if they exhibit a sufficient potential
    to increase crop yield while preserving as many resources as possible [2]. At
    present, different activities, particularly irrigation, in agriculture are performed
    with traditional procedures that are time consuming, labor intensive, and wasteful
    [3]. The traditional agricultural paradigm was geared toward modern technology
    utilization in the last decade, and its acceptance ratio at the commercial level
    increased. Technology adaptation has led to the automation of different agriculture-related
    activities, and this automation is known as precision farming or precision agriculture
    in literature [4]. The main motivation is that crop quality and production rates
    will improve if the right resources are applied at the right time under suitable
    environmental conditions. Such mechanisms improve crop yield and conserve considerable
    resources, such as water, pesticide spray, and potassium. Different mechanisms
    are utilized to collect environmental parameters and soil features, such as moisture,
    salinity, pH, temperature, air humidity, and wind direction [5], [6]. Scientific
    and research organizations are eager to apply the potential of micro-electro-mechanical
    system (MEMS) technology and the overwhelming characteristics of wireless sensor
    networks (WSNs) in different application areas, including the military, intelligent
    buildings and bridges, medical field, industries, and precision agriculture [7]–[9].
    In precision agriculture, WSNs are deployed in fields to sense and report various
    parameters that are vital to plant growth. Initial experiments with WSNs in the
    agriculture sector have been conducted in controlled environments, such as greenhouses,
    in which sensors/actuators are deployed to control the indoor environment automatically
    [10], [11]. WSNs have also been utilized in different projects, such as automating
    greenhouses, efficient water utilization, and identification of crop diseases.
    Most of these studies used WSNs as data collection tools, and decision support
    systems (DSS) were responsible for actual decisions. After the successful deployment
    of WSNs in controlled environments, researchers and scientists explored their
    applications in open field environments, but such an exploration was challenging.
    As part of a LOFAR project, Baggio [12] deployed a small network of wireless nodes
    in potato fields to detect a fungal disease known as Phytophthora. A similar experimental
    study was performed as a joint project of Switzerland and India in [13]. Mancuso
    and Bustaffa [14] explored the potential of WSNs to control various tomato diseases
    and described how this technology helps in controlling such diseases. Burrell
    et al. [15] deployed sensor nodes in a vineyard to assist managers in handling
    different scenarios, frost risk, and specific location by providing valuable information
    continuously. The FLOW-AID project used WSN to identify water deficit situations,
    scenarios where plants are in desperate need of water [16]. In 2011, Commonwealth
    Scientific and Industrial Research Organization Information and Communication
    Technology utilized WSNs to help recover the ecological integrity of Queensland’s
    Spring Brook National Park and regenerate the rain forest from agricultural grassland
    [17]. Other experimental studies have been conducted recently, but their description
    is beyond the scope of this work. The literature on WSNs in the agriculture sector
    is robust, but most of the studies neglected an important issue associated with
    data generated by sensor nodes, namely, outliers. Outliers are noisy data generated
    by sensor nodes when a sensor is malfunctioning or generated because of interference
    or colliding packets. These data must be detected and corrected prior to examination
    by DSS. Existing noise detection algorithms are highly complex, and their implementation
    in real-time DSS, a system that operates 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, is
    difficult. Therefore, a simple mechanism that does not degrade the overall performance
    of real-time DSS is needed to detect outliers. Most existing studies are designed
    for sprinkler systems and are inapplicable to real agriculture environments where
    flooding mechanisms are generally used to irrigate crops; such a practice is particularly
    common in Asia. In this work, a WSN-based outlier detection and irrigation management
    system is developed to assist farmers in handling crop irrigation schedules. The
    proposed system collects environmental and soil-related data through sensor nodes
    that are examined by the outlier detection module. The proposed noise detection
    algorithm is implemented to improve the system’s accuracy. Afterward, DSS further
    examines it to identify water deficient sites in agricultural fields. After identification,
    the alarming unit is activated, and text messages are sent over a local area network
    (LAN) to inform farmers. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In
    Section II, a brief overview of WSNs, particularly in the agriculture sector,
    is presented, followed by the proposed system architecture in Section III. Section
    IV describes the proposed outlier detection algorithm and its working mechanism.
    The different issues identified and solved during this study are presented in
    Section V. In Section VI, the achievements of the proposed approach are described,
    and a comparison of the proposed algorithm with other algorithms is performed
    based on real-time and benchmark datasets. The last section provides the concluding
    remarks. SECTION II. WSN in Agriculture Sector The distinguishing characteristics
    of WSNs make this technology an ideal solution to various real-world problems.
    These problems arise in different domains, such as the military, medicine, telemetric,
    intelligent building, hazard environments, and agriculture [18]. In the agriculture
    sector, WSNs are used to assist farmers in different activities, such as irrigation
    (whether sprinkled or flooding), detection and prevention of crop diseases in
    early stages or preventing favorable occurrence conditions, water-deficient location
    identification, and duration of field monitoring and pesticide spraying [19].
    Various experimental studies on WSNs in the agriculture sector have addressed
    particular problems. The studies that are relevant to our work are presented in
    this part. WSNs have been deployed in greenhouses to control the dew condensation
    problem that arises due to temperature, air humidity, pressure, and other environmental
    factors [20]. Park et al used different sensor nodes to collect data and adjust
    greenhouse environments accordingly. To compute for dew condensation, they utilized
    a well-known Bahrenburg formula. In a joint project to determine the ratio of
    arsenic in underground water, a WSN was deployed in [21] to collect various soil
    parameters of a rice field, such as arsenic, soil moisture, temperature, calcium,
    carbonate, chloride, nitrate, and pH. The collected data were thoroughly examined
    in sophisticated laboratories to determine the required ratio. Similarly, sensor
    nodes were deployed in Malawi to collect pH, reduction/oxidation (redox), and
    turbidity values to determine the quality of water [22]. In Spain, WSN was deployed
    to monitor soil contents, such as moisture, salinity, pH, and temperature [23].
    This system was successfully implemented in a real agriculture environment, but
    the decisions were not automated. To describe how few sensor nodes covered a particular
    area, the authors wrote an expression that describes the relationship between
    shower nozzle capacity and sensor node radius [24]. Konstantinos et al. presented
    a WSN-based architecture to control environmental conditions in a commercial greenhouse.
    The collected data were thoroughly examined to find their correlation with crop
    conditions [25]. Proper seedling of watermelon relies on environmental parameters,
    such as temperature, air humidity, and light values. Sensor nodes were deployed
    in greenhouses to collect and examine desired information and assist farmers in
    proper seedling of watermelon. A process control strategy management system was
    also designed in previous studies to determine proper and automatic seedling of
    watermelon; its various components were WSN, DSS, RFID-based method, and queuing
    theory-based algorithm [26], [27]. Phytophthora is a potato fungal disease that
    occurs due to certain environmental conditions, and if these conditions are prevented/avoided,
    then the possibility of the disease’s existence will become negligible. Baggio
    [12] utilized a WSN to collect desired data and attempted to avoid conditions
    that are favorable for the disease. Similarly, WSNs were deployed in potato fields
    by Shinghal et al. [3] to improve productivity. Favorable conditions for tomato
    diseases were avoided by using WSNs inside greenhouses [14]. In vineyards, sensor
    nodes were deployed in different locations to collect valuable data that were
    used for predicting various diseases, pest control, and facilitating the handling
    of different activities [15]. Kotamäki et al. [28] deployed a WSN near a river
    basin to determine the quality of water and described its effects on soil content
    and crop yield. The Common Sense Net Project was designed for marginal farming
    in India, in which different sensor nodes were used to identify areas whose water,
    rain, reservation capacities were high. Additionally, the project can identify
    various crop diseases [13]. The Flow AID Project was designed to utilize the WSN’s
    potentials in determining water-deficient sites in agriculture fields [16]. Dursun
    and Ozden [29] presented an automatic drip irrigation management system for cherry
    trees. Pardossi et al. [30] described a mechanism to integrate rote zone sensors
    with WSN and used it in the identification of water deficit situations. Various
    investigations on automatic control of greenhouses were reported in [4], [31],
    and [32]. Different site-specific automatic irrigation management systems were
    presented in [33]–[36]. SECTION III. Proposed System Architecture and Deployment
    A. Architecture Fig. 1 depicts the architecture of the proposed DSS. In the proposed
    architecture, an application layer is designed to provide services to farmers
    through a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). These services include
    interaction with the real-time system, identification of water-deficient locations,
    vulnerable situation alarms, and environmental monitoring. The middle layer describes
    how various components of the proposed system interact with one another, physically
    or logically, to provide the desired services precisely. The sensor manager unit
    collects data from sensors and forwards these to a microprocessor that conducts
    aggregation for further processing. The gateway module receives packets from sensor
    nodes, and is attached to a computer that runs the proposed DSS. DSS collects
    the newly arrived packets from the gateway module, checks their accuracy through
    a noise detection module, decides the current situation, and stores it. The physical
    layer directly interacts with the environment. Sensor nodes that use various sensing
    capabilities collect soil moisture, air humidity, temperature, and leaf wetness
    data and send the data to the sensor manager. These parameters are vital in the
    development of a precise DSS for irrigation. FIGURE 1. Architecture of the proposed
    DSS. Show All Real-time systems need to be continuously operational to assist
    farmers, but at the same time, the sensor node sampling rate must be adjusted
    accordingly to prolong the WSN’s lifetime. In our testbed, wasp-mote agriculture
    sensor boards with desired functionality were programmed and deployed in a real
    agriculture environment, namely, an orange orchard. During the first phase of
    the experimental setup, the boards were placed in close proximity to reduce packet
    losses, thereby improving communication reliability. In the second phase, the
    boards were placed to cover as much area as possible, and each node can communicate
    with the gateway either directly or through multi-hop communication. Their transceivers
    use the Xbee protocol and can communicate within a 500 m range. Nod e 3 was deployed
    within the direct communication range of the gateway (460 m), and Nod e 1 and
    Nod e 2 were placed at a distance of 460 m from Node3. The distance between the
    nodes and gateway was kept small to maximize their throughput. The proposed DSS
    performance is not affected by increasing or decreasing scalability of sensor
    nodes because these nodes act as data collection points. Dense deployment increases
    data packets, but this situation is not an issue, particularly in the agriculture
    sector, in which the sampling rate of the deployed sensor nodes must be very low,
    namely, two or three packets per 24 hours. B. Wasp-Mote Boards Deployment The
    implementation of a precise real-time DSS in any application depends on the selection
    of appropriate technology, sensors, and parameters to be monitored. Sensor board
    selection is based on coverage area, battery lifetime, processing capability,
    transceiver, and integration of sensors. Parameter selection is application-specific.
    In our study, we considered soil and environmental parameters. Soil moisture is
    vital in the development of a precise irrigation schedule; that is, if the sensed
    value is below a threshold value, then this area needs water and must be irrigated.
    For this purpose, soil moisture sensors were deployed at three different levels
    in the agricultural field, as shown in Figs. 2 and Fig. 3. In addition to the
    soil moisture parameter, an atmospheric moister exerts drastic effects on the
    watering schedules of various crops and must be monitored regularly. These sensors
    are deployed in close proximity to plant leaves, as shown in Fig. 4. Additionally,
    temperature and humidity parameters are significant in the design of a precise
    DSS because the soil moisture threshold value is directly proportional to the
    environmental temperature. Therefore, these sensors are integrated with wasp-mote
    boards to collect their full potential, as shown in Fig. 5. The gateway module
    is connected to a computer to receive data and process them. FIGURE 2. Deployment
    of soil moisture sensors in orange orchard. Show All FIGURE 3. Deployment soil
    moisture sensor in real agricultural environment. Show All FIGURE 4. Leaf wetness
    sensor deployment near plant leaves. Show All FIGURE 5. Air temperature and humidity
    sensors deployment. Show All SECTION IV. Proposed Decision Support System The
    proposed system collects soil and environmental parameters through its deployed
    WSN in the orange orchard. Initially, the collected data are examined by the concerned
    board to minimize redundant packets via aggregation, and the data are transferred
    to the destination via a gateway. The data sensed by four different sensors are
    merged into one packet to increase the efficiency of the proposed system in terms
    of energy consumption. These packets are forwarded to the outlier detection module
    where their accuracy is checked and sent to DSS for onward processing if found
    correct. DSS thoroughly examines these packets by comparing different parameters
    with their defined threshold values, particularly soil moisture (250 Hz).The threshold
    values such as soil moisture (250Hz), are determined through deploying the sensors
    (3) in dry soil; and collecting their readings over a period of three days. If
    the data are in the defined range, then they are stored in a database; otherwise,
    the alarm unit is activated, and alert messages are forwarded to the LAN or mobile
    phone. The GUI of the proposed system shows collected data in graphical and textual
    formats. The operation of the proposed system is summarized in Fig. 6. FIGURE
    6. Working of the proposed system. Show All A. Proposed Outliers Detection Algorithm
    Outliers are data packets generated by a malfunctioning sensor or via interference
    and collision. WSNs are highly susceptible to outliers due to various restrictions
    on their size, processing, and transceivers. The literature on outlier/noise detection
    is bulky, but most of the approaches were presented and validated based on static
    datasets, and their implementation in a real-time system is difficult or impractical.
    These algorithms improve dataset accuracy but equally degrade the overall performance
    of a real-time system because for every packet, the mechanism repeatedly searches
    the entire dataset [37], [38]. Moreover, the accuracy of these algorithms is directly
    proportional to dataset size and computation time. Their accuracy for large datasets
    is extremely high, but the computation time is also high and results in low performance
    of DSS, particularly in a real-time system. Therefore, a simplified outlier detection
    algorithm was developed to overcome these issues and improve the performance of
    real-time DSS and dataset accuracy. The performance of a real-time system based
    on the proposed outlier detection algorithm is unaffected by dataset size because
    the algorithm does not scan the overall dataset and considers the most recent
    packets only. Its computation time and performance are exceptionally good in real-time
    datasets, and it is equally applicable to static datasets. Algorithm 1 starts
    by matching the currently received packet with the previously stored one, which
    is the last accurate packet, that is, the packet received at time T i and T i−1
    . If their difference is less than the defined threshold value (10 Hz for the
    soil moisture sensor), then it is forwarded to the DSS for further analysis. However,
    if their difference crosses the defined limit, then it is either an outlier or
    an abrupt change scenario that occurs because of direct connection of water with
    soil moisture sensors. In this case, data are stored temporarily, and further
    processing is delayed until the next packet from that particular node arrives.
    Then, the recently received packet is compared with two packets, namely, the one
    that is temporarily stored and the last packet stored in the database. For example,
    data collected at time T 3 are matched with data received at time T 2 and stored
    temporarily, and data gathered at time T 1 is successfully stored. If the difference
    between packets received at T 3 and T 1 is less than the defined threshold value,
    then the data packet received at T 2 is an outlier and replaced with the average
    value of data packets T 1 and T 3 . However, if the difference between data packets
    T 2 and T 3 is less than the threshold value, then it is an abrupt change scenario,
    and both values are stored in the database. Algorithm 1 Proposed Outliers Detection

    21: else 22: Temp−Locatio n i ← Cur-Pkt 23: Outliers-ID ← 1 24: end if We consider
    Fig. 7 in which the soil moisture value received at time 13:00 is 0 Hz, representing
    the most recent packet. The packet collected at time 12:30, 850 Hz, is the last
    accurate value stored in the database. These two values are matched, and their
    difference is much larger than the threshold value, which is 10 Hz in our case.
    Therefore, this packet is temporarily stored, and the decision is delayed until
    the next packet from the same node, Nod e 1 , arrives. When the next packet at
    time 13:30 is received, it is matched with the packet collected at time 12:30
    or with most recently stored packet. The difference between these packets is below
    the threshold value, 1 Hz, indicating that the temporarily stored packet is an
    outlier and must be replaced with the average value of data packets that arrived
    at times 12:30 and 13:30 (840 Hz). Then, both values are stored in the database,
    and the data are as shown in Fig. 8. In this scenario, a real-time DSS that does
    not use the outlier detection mechanism activates the alarm unit for the water
    deficit condition and sends a text message over LAN because the soil moisture
    value is less than the threshold value. However, smart DSS, which possesses outlier
    detection facility, easily handles this situation. Another debatable scenario
    for real-time DSS in the agricultural environment is the separation of the abrupt
    change that occurs because of the direct connection of water with a soil moisture
    sensor, as shown in Fig. 8 at time 15:30. The proposed algorithm handles this
    situation through a similar mechanism described for the detection of outliers.
    However, in this case, the temporarily stored value and the currently received
    value are identical or approximate each other. Both values are stored in the database
    without modification. FIGURE 7. A scenario of both outliers and abrupt change.
    Show All FIGURE 8. Outliers free scenario. Show All SECTION V. Issues Resolved
    During Proposed Experimental Setup During the deployment phase of the proposed
    testbed, various issues were identified and resolved. A. Packets Collision and
    Nodes Overhearing A sensor node uses a broadcasting mechanism to communicate with
    the gateway and other nodes in the network, thereby resulting in the collision
    of packets or reduction of throughput. Collision usually occurs due to the concurrent
    communication of sensor nodes deployed in close proximity or within the communication
    range of one another. In the proposed testbed, a simplified mechanism, namely,
    delay timers in wasp-mote boards, is used to avoid concurrent communication of
    sensor nodes and collision. Every experimental setup uses a sampling rate or a
    sensor node rate of transmission, which is 30 minutes in our case. The criteria
    for packet transmission of every node are adjusted according to the neighbor node
    communication schedules. For example, if nod e 1 begins communication with other
    nodes or the gateway at time 10:00:00, then its neighbor nodes must wait for the
    maximum propagation delay; that is, the time required for successful communication
    between the most widely separated nodes (approximately 5 seconds in the proposed
    experimental setup). Therefore, nod e 2 , a neighboring node of nod e 1 , must
    delay its communication for 3 seconds and start around 10:00:04 if its neighbors
    are not interested in transmission. However, this mechanism works only for a testbed
    in which a limited number of sensor nodes are used. For dense WSNs, other mechanisms,
    such as channelization, are utilized. Overhearing of a sensor node in WSNs exerts
    drastic effects on node lifetime and needs to be handled efficiently, particularly
    in highly dense networks. To avoid this problem, sensor nodes are placed in such
    a manner that each node has at most one path for communication with the gateway
    and does not hear other neighboring nodes where feasible. In our case, the problem
    was successfully solved through manual adjustment of the distance between sensor
    nodes. However, this method is useful only in the engineered setup of WSN only
    and is not feasible for random deployment. This technique introduces the path
    loss problem in large networks, but it is efficient for small networks. B. Crops
    Canopy Crop canopy is another important problem associated with the deployment
    of WSNs in agricultural fields, particularly orchards. Crop canopy affects the
    communication range of sensor nodes in a network and environmental parameters.
    During the initial phase of our project, the problem was not considered, and nodes
    were deployed randomly at different locations but within the direct communication
    range of the gateway module. However, only nod e 3 packets were received successfully,
    and the remaining node packets were lost due to crop canopy. Further analysis
    of the experimental setup and field was performed, and different alternatives
    were applied to resolve this issue. This thorough investigation led us to the
    problem of crop canopy and its effects on the communication range of sensor nodes
    because nod e 1 was in the direct line of sight with the sink node, whereas the
    other nodes were not. Obstacles or orange trees were also present. Therefore,
    nodes were deployed in the orange orchard in such a manner that each node was
    in the direct line of sight with its intended receiver node. Node deployment in
    direct line of sight does not necessarily mean that nodes are unable to communicate
    when obstacles exist between transmitting and receiving nodes. Nodes placed in
    the crop canopy can communicate, but their coverage area and transmission range
    are much smaller than those in the direct line of sight communication. Another
    issue caused by crop canopy was the effects on sensor node readings, particularly
    sensors that collect environmental data (e.g., temperature and humidity). In summer,
    nodes deployed in a shady region generate temperature readings of 40 °C– 44 °C,
    whereas sensors exposed to sunlight sense temperatures in a range of 44 °C– 49
    °C. To overcome this problem, 50% of the sensor nodes were deployed in direct
    sunlight, and the remaining nodes were placed in shady areas. C. Effects of Heavy
    Rain Heavy rain is vital to plant growth rate, particularly in summer when watering
    requirements are high. In traditional approaches, flooding/watering schedules
    are postponed due to heavy rain and particularly based on farmers’ experience.
    Therefore, the proposed DSS must handle this scenario in a manner similar to traditional
    approaches but without requiring an experienced farmer to monitor the system and
    judge its decisions. In the proposed DSS, the decision whether to irrigate or
    not is primarily based on soil moisture content and other supplementary parameters.
    In the case of heavy rain, soil moisture sensor readings exceed the threshold
    value, clearly indicating that the irrigation schedule must be deferred. Similarly,
    conducting specific case studies for every season is not needed because if soil
    moisture content values are above the threshold value, then irrigation is unnecessary.
    Additionally, the proposed system possesses the flexibility to adjust threshold
    values whenever required and can be used in different agricultural scenarios.
    D. WSNs Lifetime An important aspect of the applicability of WSNs in different
    application areas is their lifetime, which mostly relies on the onboard batteries
    of sensor nodes. Efficient utilization of available power resources increases
    WSN lifetime. In the proposed testbed, sensor nodes actively probe the environment
    for the shortest duration of 1 minute and then switch to sleep mode for approximately
    29 minutes. Every board conducts aggregation of the data collected by its sensors
    and merges the data into a single packet. The aggregation approach combines the
    data gathered through temperature, air humidity, soil moisture and leaf wetness
    sensors into a single data packet. The aggregation mechanism reduces the number
    of transmitted packets from 4 to 1, and individual packets for every sensor are
    attached to a wasp-mote board, thereby improving the lifetime of WSNs. Additionally,
    in the agriculture sector, particularly in the watering schedules of open field
    crops, collection of data once or even twice a day is appropriate or needed. Therefore,
    the sampling rate of deployed nodes must be decreased to 12 hours or more to further
    increase WSN lifetime. SECTION VI. Results and Discussion In the case of real-time
    data, the worst case complexity of the proposed outlier detection algorithm is
    O(1), whereas pattern anomaly value (PAV), MPAV, and rare pattern drift detector
    (RPDD) algorithms [37], [38] have complexities of O( n 2 ) , O(n) and O( n 2 +n)
    respectively. Hence, the proposed algorithm is the best solution among these algorithms
    for real-time DSS because it does not affect the functionality of DSS. Similarly,
    the proposed algorithm’s worst case complexity for a static dataset is O(n) ,
    where n represents size of the dataset. These algorithms were tested on real-time
    data obtained via our testbed deployed in an orange orchard. The performance of
    the algorithms in terms of computational time is presented in Fig. 9, which shows
    that the proposed algorithm outperformed contemporary schemes. Moreover, the performance
    of these algorithms was examined thoroughly by continuously increasing the dataset
    size. Unlike the proposed algorithm, the other schemes were inconsistent with
    the dynamically changing dataset. In the case of the real-time dataset, the computational
    time of the other algorithms was directly proportional to the size of the dataset,
    whereas the proposed algorithm was not affected. Moreover, the proposed algorithm’s
    memory requirements were fewer than those of the other algorithms. The implementation
    of these complex algorithms in real-time DSS required highly sophisticated and
    demanding technology, which is expensive, whereas the proposed algorithm worked
    well with existing technology. The algorithms were also tested on a static dataset,
    and their computation time is depicted in Fig. 10. Our algorithm’s performance
    was better than that of the other algorithms, particularly in terms of execution
    time. FIGURE 9. Computational time comparison on real time data set. Show All
    FIGURE 10. Computational time comparison on static data set. Show All The complexity
    of an algorithm is vital to its development, implementation, and execution in
    real-time systems. Complexity is directly proportional to algorithm accuracy and
    computation time. In real-time DSS specifically for the agriculture sector, an
    algorithm must be as accurate and simple as possible so the overall performance
    of DSS is unaffected. If the algorithm is accurate and precise but degrades the
    overall performance of the system, then it is useless. An accuracy comparison
    is presented in Fig. 11. Although the proposed algorithm’s accuracy is lower than
    that of the other algorithms, its effect on the overall performance of real-time
    DSS was smaller, and the algorithm works on a personal computer. Improving the
    accuracy and precision of an algorithm results in increased complexity, degradation
    of the overall performance of the real-time system, and inability to run efficiently
    on personal computers. FIGURE 11. DSS’s accuracy. Show All In addition to the
    real-time dataset, the algorithms were examined thoroughly by using benchmark
    datasets, as shown in Table 1. The execution time of the proposed algorithm was
    less than that of the other algorithms specifically for dynamic datasets. The
    proposed algorithm is an ideal candidate for an efficient real-time DSS. The precision
    and accuracy of these algorithms on the benchmark datasets are presented in Table
    2. Accuracy is described in terms of accurate decisions taken by DSS when these
    algorithms were implemented as a separate module to fine tune data before processing.
    The proposed algorithm is not precise for datasets that possess multi-valued noise,
    such as the FacesUCR dataset. However, when datasets have single-valued outliers
    only, the proposed algorithm is ideal. TABLE 1 Comparative Computation Time of
    the Proposed Algorithm on Benchmark Data Sets TABLE 2 Comparative Accuracy of
    the Proposed Algorithm on Benchmark Data Sets A real-time decision support system
    was designed in this study to facilitate farmers in various agriculture-related
    activities. Farmers will adopt a technology-assisted system if it has a simplified
    interaction paradigm, possesses a simple GUI, and provides the desired services.
    The proposed DSS possesses a user-friendly interface that is can be easily understood
    by inexperienced users and provides different services simultaneously, as shown
    in Fig. 12. FIGURE 12. A sample screen shot of the proposed system showing data
    of soil moisture sensor. Show All SECTION VII. Conclusion and Future Work The
    demand for efficient utilization of available water resources, specifically in
    the agriculture sector, is increasing daily due to water scarcity and global climate
    change. Therefore, technology-assisted irrigation mechanisms, sensors, and actuators
    must be realized in real agriculture environments. These approaches provide water
    upon demand and control water wastage. They are helpful in controlling water resources
    but exert drastic effects on plant growth rate and yield. In this work, we developed
    a technology-assisted outlier detection and decision support system (DSS) to facilitate
    irrigation, particularly flooding. The proposed system is highly precise because
    it uses an embedded outlier detection module that thoroughly examines the correctness
    of the collected data and forwards the data to DSS for further processing. DSS
    analyzes different parameters to identify water-deficient sites and reports them
    to farmers or generates an alarm. This system possesses a user-friendly interaction
    environment that makes it easy to use. In the future, we will further improve
    the accuracy of the proposed DSS by examining additional parameters and will enhance
    it to assist farmers in other agriculture-related activities, such as pesticide
    and fertilizer use and determination of soil properties. Furthermore, due to nodes
    un-availability and their security issues, the proposed scheme was evaluated only
    on three sensor nodes. As a future work, we will investigate the proposed algorithm
    on a large-scale. ACKNOWLEDGMENT All authors declare that they have no conflict

    287 SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract [1] A nondestructive and spatially integrated
    multielectrode method for measuring soil electrical resistivity was tested in
    the Beauce region of France during a period of corn crop irrigation to monitor
    soil water flow over time and in two-dimensional (2-D) with simultaneous measurements
    of soil moisture and thermal profiles. The results suggested the potential of
    surface electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) for improving soil science and
    agronomy studies. The method was able to produce a 2-D delimitation of soil horizons
    as well as to monitor soil water movement. Soil drainage through water uptake
    by the roots, the progression of the infiltration front with preferential flow
    zones, and the drainage of the plowed horizon were well identified. At the studied
    stage of corn development (3 months) the soil zones where infiltration and drainage
    occurred were mainly located under the corn rows. The structural soil characteristics
    resulting from agricultural practices or the passage of agricultural equipment
    were also shown. Two-dimensional sections of soil moisture content were calculated
    using ERT. The estimates were made by using independently established “in situ”
    calibration relationships between the moisture and electrical resistivity of typical
    soil horizons. The thermal soil profile was also considered in the modeling. The
    results showed a reliable linear relationship between the calculated and measured
    water contents in the crop horizon. The precision of the calculation of the specific
    soil water content, quantified by the root mean square error (RMSE), was 3.63%
    with a bias corresponding to an overestimation of 1.45%. The analysis and monitoring
    of the spatial variability of the soil moisture content with ERT represent two
    components of a significant tool for better management of soil water reserves
    and rational irrigation practices. 1. Introduction [2] To provide an adequate
    water supply for growing corn, one must obtain precise knowledge of the soil moisture
    state. It is necessary to monitor water content changes in the field to measure
    water losses through infiltration and evapotranspiration. Better knowledge of
    soil water flow also gives a better understanding of the behavior and transport
    of agricultural pollutants. In consequence, a rational sampling strategy can be
    established to study the active time of the molecules residence. [3] As soil electrical
    resistivity is related to its water content, the general aim of this study is
    to determine soil moisture with electrical resistivity, or more specifically to
    relate soil electrical resistivity changes with water content changes in an unsaturated
    soil. [4] The first step of this study is to verify the capacity of the multielectrode
    method to monitor over time the soil water dynamics under an irrigated corn crop
    (Zea mays L.), particularly water infiltration and soil drainage by root uptake.
    The second step is to obtain 2-D soil water content sections after calibration
    of the electrical resistivity of typical soil horizons according to their moisture.
    The third step is to test the calculated water content with regard to soil water
    content measured simultaneously with electrical resistivity. 2. Review of Soil
    Water Content Measurements 2.1. Standard Measurements [5] In addition to direct
    weighing method, soil water and moisture profiles can be obtained with numerous
    indirect methods where sensors are placed in the soil at different depths. The
    neutron probe [Gardner and Kirkam, 1952; Bavel et al., 1956] is a reliable water
    content measurement method [Chanasyk and Naeth, 1996], but its use is limited
    because radioactive source produces numerous constraints. Measurements of dielectric
    soil properties by TDR (time domain reflectometry) probes [Topp et al., 1980]
    or capacitance sensors [Bell et al., 1987; Dean et al., 1987] avoid the use of
    radioactive sources. Time domain reflectometry is a technique to estimate the
    volumetric soil water content. It is based on the determination of the apparent
    dielectric constant K of soil. This quantity is calculated from the velocity of
    propagation of an electromagnetic signal in the frequency range of 1 MHz to 1
    GHz along a transmission line in the soil, neglecting losses along the line as
    reviewed by Topp and Davis [1985]. Soil volumetric water content θ is calculated
    using an empirical relationship, which is independent of soil type, soil density,
    soil temperature and soluble salt content [Topp et al., 1980]: The precision of
    volumetric water content measurement is about ±2%. The water potential, which
    must be known to understand water flow in an unsaturated soil, is measured with
    a tensiometer. Water infiltration into the soil is not uniform. The vertical and
    horizontal soil water content is highly variable and depends on preferential flow
    directions [Kung., 1990a, 1990b; Herkelrath et al., 1991; Ritsema et al., 1993;
    Ritsema and Dekker, 1994; Flury et al., 1994]. Soil moisture sensors yield only
    restricted information and are often not representative of the spatial soil water
    distribution. Now, improved measurement techniques and automated methods, such
    as multiTDR systems have made possible soil moisture changes monitoring over time
    at different locations and detection of preferential water flow directions [Heimovaara
    and Boulten, 1990; Herkelrath et al., 1991]. Still, these systems offer information
    at only a series of point locations rather than continuously at the field scale.
    Moreover, inserting moisture sensors disturbs the soil structure and the water
    flow [Rothe et al., 1997]. [6] Many alternative methods have been tested in order
    to monitor water flow within the soil over time. Soluble dye tracers added to
    soil water have been used [Kung, 1990a, 1990b; Flury et al., 1994; Scanlon and
    Goldsmith, 1997]. With this method, the spatial distribution of the dye tracer
    in the soil can be observed and therefore the infiltration zone can be determined.
    As a soil pit must be dug at the experimental site to monitor tracer infiltration,
    the soil structure is disturbed and the obtained information may not be representative
    of the actual processes under investigation. For example, the water flow may be
    perturbed by the changed soil drainage induced when a soil pit is dug. [7] Nevertheless,
    it is difficult to obtain a 2-D or 3-D representation of the water flow in the
    soil by exploiting sparse local data. Geophysical surface methods are not intrusive
    and consequently do not disturb the soil structure. Also, each measurement integrates
    a greater volume of soil. These methods represent alternative ways of monitoring
    unsaturated soil water fluxes. The following discussion focuses on the use of
    ERT to monitor moisture changes in soil over time. 2.2. Use of Surface Geophysical
    Methods for Estimating Water Content and Infiltration [8] Various surface geophysical
    methods have been used by hydrogeologists and soil scientists to identify soil
    water infiltration and water flow. In the past, much research has been performed
    using ground penetrating radar (GPR) to detect buried objects, to delineate geological
    structures and to measure the soil water content [Davis and Annan, 1989; Hubbard
    et al., 1997; Eppstein and Dougherty, 1998; Weiler et al., 1998; Parkin et al.,
    2000]. The majority of the studies have produced positive results. Daily and Ramirez
    [1989] tested dielectric permittivity using borehole electromagnetic tomography
    to map water content changes in a heated volcanic ignimbrite. Weiler et al. [1998]
    concluded that in comparison with TDR measurements, GPR gave promising results
    for nondestructive water content measurements. Hubbard et al. [1997] showed that
    the joint use of GPR and conventional borehole data improves water saturation
    estimates for geological formations. By comparing radar wave velocity before and
    after a controlled release of salt water in the vadose zone, Eppstein and Dougherty
    [1998] detected and visualized soil moisture patterns in three dimensions. Recently,
    Parkin et al. [2000] showed the advantage of GPR in monitoring soil water content
    distribution in a horizontal plane located below a wastewater trench. Hubbard
    et al. [2002] and Huisman et al. [2001] showed how GPR ground wave data could
    be used effectively to map near surface changes in water content. GPR performance
    is optimal in a soil with a coarse texture, but the performance decreases in electrically
    conductive media such as clayey soils. [9] The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
    method uses the nuclear properties of hydrogen to assess water content. In the
    ground, most hydrogen atoms are found in the water molecules. The NMR method can
    detect water directly, whereas conventional geophysical methods provide only indirect
    knowledge of soil moisture. Using NMR, the water content distribution and ground
    porosity versus depth have been estimated [Amin et al., 1993; Goldman et al.,
    1994; Beauce et al., 1996]. However, NMR measurements are not suitable for superficial
    soil studies, as the first few meters below the land surface constitute a blind
    zone for that method. [10] Soil electrical resistivity is a function of the textural
    and structural characteristics and is particularly sensitive to its water content
    [Sheets and Hendrickx, 1995]. Soils are a porous medium, made of nonconductive
    solid particles and containing electrolytes solution that can conduct electric
    current by the movement of the free ions in the bulk solution and ions adsorbed
    at the matrix surface. Precipitation and seasonal variations in soil temperature
    and soil water content cause significant changes in the electrical resistivity
    of the soil [Aaltonen, 1997; Benderitter and Schott, 1999]. Water infiltration
    and aquifer recharge can be detected by studies of variations in electrical sounding
    curves [Barraud et al., 1979; Cosentino et al., 1979]. Groundwater flow direction
    and velocity can be determined through observation of the electrical resistivity
    decrease in alluvial deposits following salt water tracer injections [White, 1994].
    Recent development of a surface multielectrode method, known as electrical resistivity
    tomography (ERT), offers some interesting perspectives. This method is particularly
    well suited to the 2-D description of geological structures perpendicular to the
    measurement electrode line [Griffiths and Turnbull, 1985; Griffiths et al., 1990;
    Shima, 1990; Griffiths and Barker, 1993]. ERT presents great advantages for monitoring
    and is used in hydrological and environmental studies to monitor solutes and fluid
    flow in porous media. Monitoring of vadose zone water flow such as water infiltration,
    root water uptake, borehole pumping test effects has been reported by many authors
    [Barker and Moore, 1998; Benderitter and Schott, 1999; Binley et al., 2001]. Hagrey
    and Michaelsen [1999], and Michot et al. [2001] adapted the electrode set up to
    reach a finer resolution in order to monitor soil water infiltration in 2-D. Recent
    progress in modeling and geophysical 3-D inversion methods greatly reduced calculation
    errors and processing time [Zhang et al., 1995]. Three-dimensional monitoring
    of small fresh water plume movements through the vadose zone has become possible
    [Park, 1998]. Zhou et al. [2001] also proposed a noninvasive method to monitor,
    in the field, soil water content changes over time by means of 3-D electrical
    tomography. The cited works revealed the capability of ERT data in monitoring
    water infiltration in unsaturated soil or through the vadose zone, as is our focus.
    However, these works did not consider the possibility of obtaining a water content
    cross section from ERT data using a field-scale calibration method and taking
    into account the soil thermal profile. This current study, unlike the previous
    ones, investigates water flow dynamics in relation to the soil management (agricultural
    practices, tillage operations) with a corn crop cover irrigated by sprinkling.
    3. Presentation of the Study Site [11] The study area is located southwest of
    Paris, in the Beauce region, at Villamblain (Figure 1). The topography is weakly
    undulating with slopes rarely exceeding 2%. The altitude ranges between 121 m
    and 125 m. The loamy clay soil has a thickness of 0.3 to 1.2 m over the Beauce
    limestone bedrock, containing a large aquifer about between 15 and 70 m depth.
    The water is pumped for crop irrigation and regional drinking water supply. Figure
    1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Location of the study area. [12] The studied
    site has a corn crop cover (Zea mays L) and is irrigated by sprinklers. The experimental
    plot soil can be classified as a loamy clay Calcisol developed in a beige cryoturbated
    limestone deposit according to the French soil reference system [Baize and Girard,
    1995]. Because of numerous studies about the regional spatial soil distribution
    and the experimental plot [Isambert and Duval, 1992; Nicoullaud et al., 1997],
    this Calcisol was chosen as representative of the soil in the region. A soil pit
    was dug near the experimental device to identify the characteristic soil horizons
    (Figure 2). Three reference horizons include the following: (1) First is the top
    horizon, LAci, an organomineral 30 cm thick plow layer. It has a loamy clay texture,
    a fine polyhedral structure and a very high porosity. A plowed pan lies beneath
    its lower boundary. (2) Second is a light brown structural S horizon with slight
    weathering, observed at a depth from 30 cm to 75 cm. It is a loamy clay layer
    without coarse fragments and with a medium polyhedral structure and high porosity.
    This horizon is subdivided into three parts: Sci1, Sci2 and Sca3. This division
    is justified by a decrease in clay content, a gradual weakening of soil structure
    and an increase of carbonate inflorescences inside earthworm burrows with depth.
    (3) Third is the Ck horizon at a 75 cm depth. It is formed of beige cryoturbated
    and highly weathered soft limestone rocks. It has a massive structure and a high
    porosity. This horizon is subdivided into two layers, Ck(m)1 (75–100 cm) and Ck2
    (100–170 cm). On the basis of simultaneous decrease of clay and silt content and
    increase of carbonate content (CaCO3 > 75%) with depth. Figure 2 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Water flow monitoring; experimental setup by 2-D electrical
    resistivity tomography in its pedological and agricultural context. [13] An auger
    drilling into the bottom of the soil pit provides additional information at depth.
    The Ck2 horizon goes down to a depth of 170 cm. A soft powdery gray limestone
    mineral horizon Ck3 exists between 170 and 250 cm depth. Beyond this, the auger
    was blocked by a slab of sublithographic hard gray Beauce Limestone. Table 1 shows
    particle size distribution of the fine earth fraction after carbonate removal
    and chemical analysis. The soil is alkaline (pH > 8.2). There is slight recarbonatation
    of the LAci surface horizon with regard to horizon Sci1, no doubt related to the
    working of the soil and the use of irrigation water rich in calcium carbonate.
    The exchange complex is saturated with calcium throughout the soil profile. Table

    that the corn root density is higher in the plowed horizon between a depth of

    et al., 1995]. This is a representative and typical soil of the Beauce region,
    which covers 85000 ha. Major soil differences are associated with only the thickness
    of the loamy-clay horizon and the CaCO3 content. 4. Field Calibration [15] A considerable
    effort has gone toward investigating the relationship between the apparent electrical
    resistivity (or its reciprocal, the apparent electrical conductivity), water conductivity
    and water content in saturated and unsaturated porous media. Numerous reviews
    of these petrophysical models have been published [Bussian, 1983; Worthington,
    1985; Mualem and Friedman, 1991; Benderitter and Schott, 1999] and their respective
    advantages and drawbacks have been discussed. The first model was established
    for clean sand, i.e. without any clay, in saturated or unsaturated conditions
    [Archie, 1942]. This model can not be used for the soil at our study site, which
    is a much more heterogeneous soil that contains clays. Wyllie and Southwick [1954]
    suggested that an aggregate of conductive particles saturated with a conductive
    electrolyte could be modeled with a three resistor network. Waxman and Smits [1968]
    proposed the first extensive model of shaly sand formations. They proposed that
    clay particles contribute exchange cations to the electrolyte thereby increasing
    the conductivity of the formation. The dual water model suggested by Clavier et
    al. [1977] is based on the assumption that the exchange cations contribute to
    the conductivity of a clay water which is spatially separated from the bulk water
    located in the pore space. More complex theoretical relationship were proposed
    relying upon properties of a solid phase dispersed in a continuous electrolyte
    [Bussian, 1983] or accounting for the different behavior of ions in the spore
    space [Revil et al., 1998]. Mualem and Friedman [1991] proposed a model more adapted
    for soil at any water saturation but it does not take into account the surface
    conductivity. So, in unsaturated condition this model seems more adapted for soil
    with a coarse texture. The quality of the prediction decreases for fine texture
    as clayed soil. Most published models are either theoretical and present some
    physical limits, or are obtained in laboratory on small soil cores with controlled
    conditions. [16] We considered the use of both laboratory-derived and field-derived
    petrophysical relationships for application to our field-scale ERT data. We attempted
    to use a laboratory calibration because it was easier and faster to measure the
    soil core electrical resistivity on a vast range of soil moisture. During a drying
    period, electrical resistivity and water content were measured on a cylindrical
    soil core from LAci and Sci1 loamy-clay horizons. As expected, a high soil electrical
    resistivity decrease was observed as soil volumetric water content increased up
    to 15%, and when the soil volumetric moisture increased from 15% to 45%, a regular
    and weaker soil resistivity decrease was remarked. However, these relationships
    obtained in laboratory were not representative because the saturation water conductivity
    of the soil cores was different from the natural soil solution electrical conductivity
    in the field. Moreover, we observed a high variability of the soil core electrical
    resistivity measurement with the soil sample volume. For the same moisture, an
    increase in the soil core volume was always associated with a higher electrical
    resistivity value, which suggests that the measurement elementary volume of the
    soil core must be defined before using a laboratory relationship. Because of this
    major limitation, we decided instead in this study to develop a field-scale site
    specific petrophysical model, which we judged to be more representative of natural
    conditions. [17] The aims of this field study were (1) to verify that soil moisture
    changes generate measurable electrical resistivity changes, (2) to set up a simple
    field-scale calibration relationship for each soil horizon enabling the calculation
    of soil water content as a function of its temperature and electrical resistivity,
    and (3) to use these relationships with time-lapse ERT data to estimate moisture
    content variations over time at the field scale. [18] This calibration was performed
    with a monitoring device implanted in a calibration pit (Figure 3) dug into the
    Calcisol very near of the experimental plot. The electrical resistivity of the
    soil horizons was measured by a Wenner electrode array with an electrode spacing
    of 0.15 m. The electrodes were driven horizontally into the wall of the pit over
    a length of 0.35 m at 0.18 m, 0.50 m, and 1 m depths as illustrated in Figure
    3. Only the extremities of the electrodes were in electrical contact with the
    soil enabling a point measurement of electrical potential and point injection
    of electrical current in an infinite medium. The geometry of the quadripoles allowed
    most of the current lines to remain in each studied soil layer. The water content
    and temperature of the three soil horizons were measured with TDR probes and platinum-wire
    thermal probes respectively. After installation of the different sensors, the
    soil pit was carefully refilled, horizon by horizon. To limit the disruptive effects
    of the soil structure deterioration caused by the excavation, the monitoring began
    more than 6 months after the installation of the sensors and lasted one year.
    The various synchronized measurements were made on average every two weeks (Table
    2). Thirty measurements were made on dates likely to show the various soil moisture
    states. Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Experimental setup for geophysical
    characterization of soil horizons in the calibration pit. Table 2. Physical Parameters

    is where I is the intensity of the current injected between electrodes A and B
    and ΔV is the potential difference measured between electrodes M and N (Figure
    3). The electrical resistivity was measured not only at different water contents
    but also at different soil temperatures. To eliminate the effect of the temperature
    and determine only the electrical resistivity and horizon moisture relationship,
    all the electrical resistivity measurements were corrected and related to a reference
    temperature of 25°C. The correction rule, adopted for a range of temperatures
    from 5°C to 25°C, corresponding to the maximal amplitude of the variation of the
    soil thermal profile, is a 2% per °C linear increase of the electrical conductivity
    of the soil with temperature [Campbell et al., 1948; Iliceto, 1969] as the following
    relationship : with ρT electrical resistivity at the temperature T (in Celsius
    degree), σT electrical conductivity at the temperature T, σ25°C electrical conductivity
    at 25°C. [20] Linear regression was used to determine the specific relationships
    between water content and electrical resistivity of the three typical Calcisol
    horizons measured in the calibration pit (Figures 3 and 4). The literature and
    laboratory measurements showed that polynomial function (power 2) or power function
    were must commonly used for a large range of moisture changes ranging between
    full saturation and dry soil states. However, for low volumetric water content
    changes ranging from 20% to 35% between the permanent wilting point and the field
    capacity, which corresponds to natural soil moisture changes in the region, our
    laboratory measurements confirmed that the most simple linear relationship was
    overall sufficient for the all three soil horizons. Figure 4 Open in figure viewer

    water flow by electrical resistivity tomography and to produce a 2-D soil water
    content tomography. [21] The relationships between electrical resistivity and
    moisture of the three typical horizons of the Calcisol showed and verified that
    in the explored domain, electrical resistivity increased linearly with decreasing
    water content. Nevertheless, the slope and the sensitivity of the relationship
    varied depending on the soil horizon under consideration (Figure 5). The linear
    relation between moisture and electrical resistivity of the horizons was quantified
    by their correlation coefficient R (Table 3). A quality index ∣ΔR/R∣ representing
    the ratio between the confidence interval of the correlation coefficient ΔR for
    a 5% error margin and the correlation coefficient R enabled the relationships
    to be classified. When the ΔR was high and ∣R∣ was low, a high index value showed
    an inferior quality of the relationship. Inversely, if ΔR was restricted to a
    high value of R close to 1, a low value of the index indicated a high quality
    relationship. Figure 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Calibration relationships

    The loamy clay horizon Sci1 displayed the best linear relationship. The coefficient
    R, for a confidence level of 95%, ranged between the values of −0.98 and −0.92.
    The quality index, with a value close to zero, was the lowest of the studied soil
    profiles, which indicated the highest quality calibration relationship. The sensitivity,
    corresponding to the inverse of the slope absolute value, was 2.8 Ωm by percent
    of soil volumetric water content. Nevertheless, the electrical resistivity measured
    was lower than those measured in the laboratory on cylindrical soil cores with
    the same moisture range [Michot et al., 2001] and furthermore, the sensitivity
    of 2.8 Ωm was clearly higher than that observed in the laboratory which was 1.7
    Ωm by percent of soil volumetric water content. This could be explained either
    by a difference between the volume measured in the field and that of the samples,
    by the disturbance due to the transport of the sample in laboratory, or by variability
    in the samples. [23] The plowed surface horizon, LAci, displayed a linear relationship
    characterized by a coefficient R = −0.80, taken between −0.64 and −0.90 for an
    accepted confidence level of 95%. The sensitivity of the relationship was 3.9
    Ωm by percent of soil water content. Considering the data, a power 2 polynomial
    function seemed appropriate too. However, a residual analysis showed that was
    not significant improvement of this curve fitting in comparison with a linear
    relationship. Both small range of resistivity and moisture changes explained that
    a good fit of such a curve could not be obtained. On the field, we have not access
    to soil water content extreme values as in laboratory. So, we do not have any
    reason to choose a power 2 polynomial function. A linear relationship was sufficient.
    [24] The linear relationship observed in the cryoturbated calcareous horizon of
    Ck(m)1 presented the lowest correlation coefficient and the highest quality index
    of the three Calcisol horizons. For a small water content change, the apparent
    resistivity data were relatively dispersed. Because of this major limitation we
    used only a linear relationship. The heterogeneity of the cryoturbated limestone
    horizon and the lower moisture variation in this horizon situated at a 1 m depth
    could explain the lower quality of the relationship. For a decrease in soil moisture
    of 5%, the resistivity of the horizon increased by 90 Ωm, i.e. a sensitivity close
    to 19.9 Ωm by percent of soil volumetric water content. 5. Monitoring [25] The
    aim of this field study was to first acquire the resistivity data for later transformation
    in water content and secondly, to acquire point water content measurements for
    validation of the estimated water content (Figure 4). For this second purpose
    a second pit was dug near the monitoring study area (Figure 2). [26] This data
    acquisition was carried out during an irrigation cycle, on a corn crop characterized
    by a regular implantation of corn plants in rows justifying a 2-D study. Two-dimensional
    soil electrical resistivity tomography data were acquired over time using a multielectrode
    method at the surface of the study area. Two-dimensional soil moisture profiles
    were then estimated from the 2-D ERT profiles using the calibration relationships
    previously established from stationary measures in the pit, as described in 6.
    [27] Temporal monitoring of the electrical resistivity, water content and temperature
    of a vertical soil section was carried out over a period of 10 days (Figure 6
    and Table 2), before, during and after irrigation of the experimental plot by
    means of a rotating ramp fitted with sprinklers. Irrigation supplied 25 mm of
    water by sprinkling on the experimental device between 18h and 20h. On 1 September
    2000, 5 mm of additional water is supplied by one hour of rainfall. The electrical
    conductivity of the irrigation water measured in 5 samples taken from 4 rain gauges
    and in the rainfall recorder ranged between 17.5 10−3 S m−1 and 19 10−3 S m−1
    (Table 4). Figure 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Electrical tomography, natural
    rainfall, and irrigation water depth records over time. Table 4. Electrical Conductivity

    Interpretation 5.1.1. Electrical Device and Data Acquisition [28] Resistivity
    measurements were carried out with the resistivity meter Syscal R1 (Iris Instruments,
    Orléans, France) equipped with 32 electrodes. The intensity and voltage accuracy
    is 0.3%, which is consistent with the measurements carried out under constant
    surface conditions. Repeated measurements in stable hydrogeologic conditions for
    about ten hours were persistent within a tenth of an ohm-meter, i.e., one thousandth
    of the measured resistivity. During sprinkling, variations of the measured resistivity
    could reach several ohm-meters between two sets of measurements 1 hour apart.
    The electrodes remained on the soil surface during all the experiment time to
    avoid any electrode polarization changes and to ensure a best quality of measurements.
    [29] The experimental setup included a row of 32 electrodes, lined up on the soil
    surface (Figure 2), in a direction perpendicularly to 8 corn rows, which were
    separated by 0.8 m. This device had a total length of 6.2 m with an electrode
    spacing (a) of 0.2 m. The dipole-dipole arrangement was chosen because it allowed
    the greatest number of measurements for a given number of electrodes, which was
    advantageous for data inversion. Moreover, the dipole-dipole array was very sensitive
    to horizontal changes in resistivity, but relatively insensitive to vertical changes
    in resistivity. That means that it was convenient in mapping vertical structures,
    such as water preferential flow direction induced by soil cracks. For each resistivity
    measurement, electrical current was injected between two adjacent electrodes (dipole
    A B) and the difference potential was measured between two others neighboring
    electrodes (dipole MN). A preprogrammed measurement sequence (Figure 7) was implemented
    in the resistivity meter and the multiplexer provided electrode commutation. To
    obtain the best resolution, especially down to 0.50 m depth, 345 measurements,
    located at 15 levels of investigation, were made during each sequence. The first
    6 levels (n) were characterized by a spacing (s = a) between electrodes of each
    dipole. For each of these 6 levels (n), the spacing between dipoles was (n × s
    = n × a). One possible disadvantage of this array was the very small signal strength
    for large values of the (n) factor, the voltage being inversely proportional to
    the cube of the (n) factor. This means that for the same current, the voltage
    measured by the resistivity meter dropped by about 200 times, when (n) was increased
    from 1 to 6. One method to overcome this problem, was to increase the (a) spacing
    between both electrodes of each dipole to reduce the drop in the potential when
    the overall length of the array was increased to increase the depth of investigation.
    So, to insure the measurement quality at depth with a high signal/noise ratio,
    6 new levels (n) were investigated with a spacing (s = 2a) between electrodes
    of each dipole. For the same reason, the measurements at the last 3 levels were
    made with a spacing (s = 3a). By convention, each apparent electrical resistivity
    measurements were located at the quadripole center and at a depth proportional
    to both dipole spacing. Figure 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Measurement
    sequence to construct a pseudosection using a dipole-dipole multielectrode setup.
    Measurements are shown on a vertical plane. [30] Each ERT sequence took just under
    one hour to acquire. During the first 36 hours of space-time monitoring of the
    water flow, the resistivity was monitored at regular intervals of 1 hour, then
    at increasing intervals (Table 2). 5.1.2. ERT Processing [31] Inversion of the
    measured resistivities is an essential step before interpretation because the
    raw resistivity measurements rarely give the true structure of the soil. Panissod
    et al. [2001] showed that the 2-D inversion was appropriate in this case according
    to a 3-D inversion. Indeed, a 3-D modeling using both finite difference and moment-method
    confirmed the reality of 2-D artifacts, showed that 3-D effects were not significant
    and allowed us to exclude numerical artifacts. So inverted resistivity sections
    were achieved with the RES2DINV software [Loke and Barker, 1996]. This technique
    was based on the smoothness-constrained least squares method and it produced 2-D
    subsurface model from the resistivity section. In the first iteration, a homogeneous
    earth model was used as starting model for which the resistivity partial derivative
    values could be calculated analytically. For subsequent iterations, a quasi-Newton
    method was used to estimate the partial derivatives which reduced the computer
    time. In this method, the Jacobian matrices for a homogeneous earth model was
    used for the first iteration, and the Jacobian matrices for subsequent iterations
    were estimated by an updating technique. The model consisted of a rectangular
    grid. The software determined the resistivity of each mesh which gave a calculated
    electrical resistivity section according to field measurements. The iterative
    optimization method attempted to reduce the differences between measured resistivity
    values and those calculated with the inversion model. The difference was estimated
    by the root mean square error (RMS error). Topographic correction was not taken
    into account for this inversion process, and each ERT was inverted independently.
    The model obtained from the inversion of the initial data set was not used as
    a reference model to constrain the inversion of the later time-lapse data sets,
    as it was possible with the recent version of RES2DINV software. A minimum of
    5 successive iterations were made. However, for ERT inversions, the same number
    of data and mesh of the model were conserved, so the inversion of each ERT data
    was not totally independent. [32] Each measured resistivity section was inverted.
    Water infiltration was indicated by variations in electrical resistivity of the
    soils, as expected [Ward, 1990], i.e. electrical resistivity in the soils decreases
    when the soil water content increases, and vice versa. To enhance the representation
    of that occurrence, sections of resistivity changes were calculated in relation
    to some sections measured at typical moments representative of particular hydric
    soil states. In this manner of calculating “difference images”, water infiltration
    was studied in relation to the first ERT (P1, Figure 6) measured at the initial
    soil moisture state at the beginning of the experimental monitoring. Soil desiccation
    by evapotranspiration was observed by comparison to an ERT (P37, Figure 6) made
    after irrigation of a wet soil, near field capacity, whose moisture profile was
    therefore considered stabilized. 5.1.3. Procedure for Soil Moisture Estimation
    Using ERT Data [33] The water content section was shaped from the rectangular
    grid network of the 2-D ERT data established during geophysical inversion. The
    vertical rectangular grid (Figure 5) was composed of 175 rectangular meshes localized
    by their central coordinates (X, Z). X represents the horizontal distance along
    the electrode line and Z is the vertical depth of rectangular mesh center. The
    grid was divided into 7 layers, which depths were 0.03 m, 0.11 m, 0.19 m, 0.30
    m, 0.43 m, 0.59 m and 0.80 m respectively. [34] The calibration relationships
    obtained for the three typical Calcisol horizons were respectively attributed
    to the corresponding rectangular meshes. The relationship obtained between resistivity
    and water content of the plowed LAci horizon was used for the first four layers
    of meshes. The observed relationship on the median structural horizon Sci1 was
    used for the next two layers of meshes. Finally, the typical relationship of the
    mineral horizon Ck(m)1 was used for the last layer of meshes. As the soil thermal
    profile was known at the moment of each electrical tomography measurement, the
    soil temperature at the center of each mesh was calculated by linear interpolation.
    For each one, the calibration relationship for the calculation of water content
    values was selected at the temperature nearest to the real soil temperature at
    this depth. The 2-D water content sections were then mapped by means of a triangulation
    method. [35] To evaluate the quality of the soil moisture prediction, 349 water
    content values measured in the plowed LAci horizon by TDR probes were compared
    with those modeled from the electrical tomographies measured at the same time
    and with the same coordinates (X,Z) (Figure 4). The soil water contents modeled
    and compared with the TDR measurements were located either under the corn rows
    (X = 2.7 m and X =3.5 m), or between them (X = 3.1 m and X = 3.9 m). As only the
    rectangular meshes situated at depths of Z = 0.1 m, 0.19 m and 0.3 m corresponded
    to the TDR implanted at respectively 0.10 m, 0.20 m and 0.30 m depths (Figure
    2), the modeled and observed moistures were only compared in the plowed LAci horizon.
    Thus 96, 126, 127 moistures content measurements and estimates were compared at
    the respective depths of 0.10 m, 0.20 m and 0.30 m. 5.2. Measurements of Soil
    Water Content and Soil Temperature Using Conventional Approaches [36] Soil volumetric
    water content and soil temperature were estimated and measured, simultaneously
    during ERT acquisition using point measuring devices. Four moisture profiles were
    monitored over time using 18 TDR probes. [37] Two moisture profiles were studied
    directly beneath a corn row (rows R4 and R5), and two others were located between
    two rows (row spacings R4–R5 and R5–R6). The TDR probes were set at 0.1 m, 0.2
    m, 0.3 m, 0.5 m and 0.7 m depths in loamy clay horizons. Moisture profiles were
    measured at 20 min intervals. Thermal soil profile changes were monitored by 5
    platinum-wire thermal probes (PT100). Soil temperature was measured at 0.1 m,
    0.2 m, 0.5 m, 0.7 m and 1 m depths (Figure 2). Thermal profiles were measured
    every hour (Table 2). At the soil surface, a rainfall recorder registered the
    times and rates of sprinkler irrigation. Five rain gauges measured the amounts
    of irrigation water. Two rain gauges were situated underneath corn rows and three
    others between corn rows. [38] The distribution on the soil surface of water droplets
    from rainfall or sprinkler irrigation depended both on the aerial parts of the
    corn plants and on the local topography. This topography was the result of farming
    practices, mainly tractor wheel ruts. Water accumulated on the soil surface during
    irrigation, formed puddles and water flows along the ruts on the slope as streamlets.
    The rate of water infiltration into the soil was therefore lower than the sprinkling
    rate. In order to study the role of topography in the location of preferential
    infiltration sites, a detailed topographical survey was carried out. The experimental
    plot selected in the corn field was an 8 m by 2 m rectangle. The slope was less
    than 2% and the corn row orientation followed the slope (NW/SE). A detailed digital
    elevation model (DEM) (Figure 8) of the experimental plot was built with the help
    of a high-performance global positioning system (GPS): Aquarius, from Thalès Navigation.
    The altitude survey was made in real time by a GPS working in a differential mode.
    The quality of the system allowed very fast measurements: in a few seconds a point
    was located with a precision of less than 1 cm. Measurements were taken atop a
    2.50 m pole in contact with the ground surface to avoid any interference from
    the corn foliage. A grid marked on the ground insured a regular 20 cm spacing
    of the sampling points. During the topographical survey, 603 altitude measurements
    were recorded over a 16 m2 surface. The positions of every corn plant and each
    electrode of the geophysical measuring device were precisely recorded. The DEM
    (Figure 8) was computed with Arc-Info software and its Grid module (ESRI). A network
    of points, with a 5 cm spacing, was built by a triangulation interpolation method.

    elevation model (DEM) of the experimental plot. 6. Results 6.1. Evolution of the
    Thermal and Hydric Profiles [39] The moisture profiles measured using TDR probes
    during the monitoring under the corn rows or between them showed varying infiltration
    as a function of depth and location (Figure 9). Under the corn rows, the volumetric
    moisture profiles showed the effect of irrigation with a moisture increase of
    more than 10% in the plowed horizon. After irrigation, superficial drainage occurred
    in the horizon with a progressive decrease in surface moisture and an increase
    by infiltration of the water content in the Sci1 horizon at 0.5 m depth. The infiltration
    was clearly noticeable and instantaneous under corn row R4 with a moisture increase
    of nearly 5%. It was less significant under row R5 where the water content remained
    constant at a 0.5 m depth. Later, the moisture profiles under the corn rows progressively
    returned to their initial state. Finally, at the depth of 0.7 m, there was no
    change in soil moisture. When irrigation began, the usable water reserves were
    by no means exhausted in the LAci horizon but also in the median Sci1 horizon
    where plant roots decreased (Table 5). Figure 9 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint

    10.9 31.2 a The term pF can be obtained from the soil matric potential ΨM according
    to the formula pF = log(−ΨM). Water content is in percent. [40] The situation
    was different between the rows. Before irrigation, the moisture content was high,
    mainly between corn rows R4 and R5, nearly at field capacity. In the cultivated
    upper horizon, the moisture increased by about 5% as did the irrigation but this
    increase was lower than that observed under the corn rows. During the drainage
    and after irrigation, the moisture profiles measured between rows remained relatively
    constant over time. The water did not appear to infiltrate further down than the
    plowed horizon between rows R5–R6 and infiltrated only slightly between rows R4–R5
    (Figure 9). [41] The temperature variation did not seem to be directly related
    to variations in water content, apart from a decrease in temperature of 1°C at
    a 0.1 m depth just after the beginning of irrigation (curve 3). The thermal profiles
    were difficult to interpret. The daily cycle probably influenced the soil temperature
    at the time of the electrical data acquisition. Moreover, the platinum-wired thermal
    probes were not located in the same vertical plane (Figure 2). 6.2. Soil Hydric
    Fluxes Characterization From ERT [42] Two-dimensional soil water content sections
    were then estimated using the ERT data, the calibration relationships between
    the electrical resistivity, the water content of the three horizons typical of
    the Calcisol (Figures 4 and 5), and the soil thermal profile. The last stage of
    processing consisted of testing the quality of the model soil moisture prediction
    by comparing measured and calculated water contents along the 2-D profiles. [43]
    Sixty ERT profiles were acquired. In the context of this work, only eight ERT
    profiles (P1, P4, P16, P28, P37, P51, P55, and P60; Figure 6), which were particularly
    representative of moisture stages, were presented (Figure 10). For each ERT section,
    two moisture profiles were indicated. The first moisture profile was obtained
    just under the corn row 4, while the second one was measured between rows 4 and
    5. The section P1, measured at the beginning of the experiment, just before irrigation
    at 12:16 P.M. on August 30th, characterized the initial soil moisture state defined
    as reference. Figure 10 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Characteristic true soil
    sections resistivity and volumetric moisture profiles measured over time during
    water infiltration after sprinkling and subsequent soil drying phase. 6.2.1. Initial
    Soil Moisture State [44] In the section P1 (first row of Figure 10), the main
    typical soil horizons were identified by their electrical resistivity. The first
    layer between the soil surface and the 0.3 m depth corresponded to the plowed
    LAci loamy-clay layer. It appeared to have a moderate resistivity (20 Ω m < ρ
    < 70 Ω m), with resistive structures (ρ > 100 Ω m) under each corn plant. According
    to the profiles of corn roots density (Figure 2) [Nicoullaud et al., 1995], the
    major resistivity anomalies in the plowed layer indicated that the soil volume
    had dried as a result of corn root water uptake [Michot et al., 2001]. The drying
    process in the plowed layer was not uniform. This effect was less intense between
    rows due to compaction by tractor wheels (X-coordinates 1.5 and 3.1 m). Soil compaction
    between the corn rows by agricultural machines was also visible on the DEM (Figure
    8). Wheel tracks had modeled the soil microtopography. The fact that the zones
    between the corn rows were lower was evidence of their compaction, which was also
    shown by a higher apparent density of the plowed horizon between the surface and
    a depth of 0.1 m (Table 6). These compacted zones had a smaller root density [Tardieu
    and Manichon, 1987]. The systematically oblique variations in the electrical resistivity
    of the soil and the oblique orientation of the pockets of resistant soil within
    the plowed horizon seemed linked to the orientation of the plowing clods. However,
    the obliqueness of these structures could also be an artifact linked to the nonsymmetrical
    positioning of the electrodes in relation to the corn plants or to the meshing
    of the electrical resistivity section during inversion. Table 6. Bulk Density

    the Soil Surface and 0.1 m Deptha Location da 1 da 2 da 3 Mean Standard Deviation

    1.40 0.14 a Soil core volume is 500 cm3. [45] The median soil layer corresponding
    to the Sci1 horizon had the lowest resistivity. The high clay content (32%) of
    the horizon explained its high conductivity (Table 1). The gradual increase of
    electrical resistivity with depth was related to clay content decrease and to
    smaller water uptake by corn roots. [46] At a depth of 0.7 to 0.75 m, a resistive
    layer appeared, corresponding to the Ck(m)1 horizon composed of beige cryoturbated
    limestone. 6.2.2. Water Infiltration Phase [47] After irrigation, monitoring of
    the water flows was performed using the relative variations of ERT sections (Figure
    11). Before irrigation, the electrical tomographies P1 and P4 measured at a two-hour
    interval in the same moisture conditions produced closely comparable resistivities.
    In the absence of change in the moisture state of the soil, in particular at the
    greatest depths, the electrical resistivity measurements were reproduced. Figure
    11 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Soil sections of relative resistivity changes
    measured over time respectively during the soil wetting phase and subsequent drying
    phase. [48] During the moistening phase after the application of 25 mm of sprinkled
    water, the progressive saturation of the plowed LAci horizon by infiltration explained
    the general decrease in soil resistivity. [49] Selective infiltration occurred
    under the corn plants and not in the low zones, between the corn rows, where surface
    water had a tendency to accumulate due to the effect of the soil microtopography
    (Figures 8 and 11). The vertical anomalies of negative electrical resistivity
    changes observed under the corn rows corresponded to the preferential directions
    of water flow. The aerial parts of the corn plants played an important role in
    the catching of water droplets. The water ran down the length of the stem, causing
    first an increase in soil moisture, and then infiltration under the corn plants.
    The role of topography would therefore appear to be less important in water infiltration
    as the water hardly infiltrated in the low zones between the rows. [50] Three
    resistive pockets in the LAci horizon between corn rows R3 and R4 persisted over
    time. This was explained by the local soil microtopography. The irrigation water
    did not infiltrate here but ran rapidly in the direction of the slope toward the
    low zones in the soil surface created by tractor-wheel tracks (Figure 8). [51]
    Locally, the upper parts of the median Sci1 horizon showed resistivities of less
    than 20 Ω m, with a 20 to 70% resistivity decrease compared to the initial soil
    conditions. The percolating water could reach the upper part of the horizon and
    accumulated in the pores of the horizon. [52] Two vertical structures located
    between two corn rows were characterized by an electrical resistivity that was
    constant or slightly increased over time. These domains were separated by a distance
    of 1.6 m to 1.8 m, corresponding to wheel span of an agricultural machine. The
    base of the LAci horizon was probably compacted by the passage of an agricultural
    machine before the corn was sown as the wheel tracks corresponding to the compacted
    zones did not appear in the soil topography. Soil compaction was shown between
    corn rows R5 and R6 by a higher bulk density of the LAci horizon, which could
    reach a value of 1.56 (Table 6). Compaction of the plowed horizon by the wheels
    of agricultural machines significantly reduced the infiltration capacity of the
    soil. Ankeny et al. [1990] showed that the hydraulic conductivity of the soil
    was greatly reduced by the passage of the wheels and they attributed this to the
    destruction of the macropores by compaction. The compacting of the horizon could
    create a shadow zone preventing the vertical infiltration of the water. Similarly,
    water was collected between the rows and was evacuated down the slope as runoff.
    There were two possible explanations of soil electrical resistivity increase either
    a soil temperature decrease or a soil moisture decrease. However, a numerical
    simulation showed that a realistic soil temperature decrease of 1°C provoked by
    cold water infiltration nearby could not explain an electrical resistivity increase
    higher than 5%. At the same depth, the soil moisture changes under a corn plant
    could be very different and even inverse from those observed under the both compacted
    area because the water infiltrated to this depth with different velocities. Moreover,
    the soil moisture history could involve different hydric behaviors. The experiment
    performed a sudden soil moistening after a slow drying phase between two water
    sprinklings. Under the compacted horizon characterized by a low hydraulic conductivity
    the local wetting kinetic was asynchronous in comparison with the rest of the
    soil profile. Both these domains were always in a slow drying phase. So, the electrical
    resistivity increase could be explained by a local water content decrease. 6.2.3.
    Soil Desiccation Phase [53] During the drying phase, after the drainage period,
    the soil pockets characterized by a high electrical resistivity reappeared under
    the corn plants in the LAci horizon (Figure 11). The size of the structures associated
    with the positive variations in electrical resistivity in relation to the electrical
    tomography P37 increased with time. The increase in electrical resistivity was
    first seen in the LAci horizon, then spread progressively downward. Soil pockets,
    drained by the corn root water uptake, were detected by an increase in the electrical
    resistivity of the soil. At the end of the monitoring period, the shape of the
    positive resistivity anomalies under the corn plants and the amplitude of the
    increase in electrical resistivity, evolved in the same way as the corn root frequency
    profiles : higher in the plowed horizon and lower at depth [Nicoullaud et al.,
    1995]. To strengthen these observations and to retrieve information about root
    water uptake and soil water reserve from the time variations of resistivity, Tabbagh
    et al. [2002] have developed a model that solves simultaneously Richard''s and
    heat conduction equations, and delivers for each time intervals the soil water
    distribution after sprinkling and the corresponding resistivity variations. 6.3.
    Soil Moisture Sections and Validation [54] Five 2-D sections of moisture content
    of the selected soil, estimated using the ERT data obtained at various dates of
    the monitoring, are presented in Figure 12. The use of a linear relationship between
    moisture and electrical resistivity for the three soil horizons suggests that
    the spatial structure of the moisture sections and of the electrical resistivity
    sections are similar. The moisture sections reproduce the water flow previously
    revealed by variations in electrical resistivity during the phases of water infiltration
    and soil drainage. Figure 12 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Characteristic soil
    moisture content sections computed over time during the experimental monitoring
    period. [55] For the whole of the plowed LAci horizon, the water contents estimated
    using ERT data are effectively correlated with the measured values (R = 0.68)
    using TDR data (Figure 13 and Table 7). The slope of the linear regression between
    the modeled and measured water contents is close to the ideal value of 1. The
    estimate precision was quantified by the root mean square error (RMSE), while
    the estimation bias was quantified by the mean error (ME). The estimation bias
    is small and corresponds to an overestimation of 1.45% of the volumetric moisture.
    The precision of the water content estimation is 3.63%. The residual histogram,
    corresponding to the difference between the measured and calculated moistures,
    shows a Gaussian distribution of the residues (Figure 14). The histogram also
    shows that 26.5% of the residues range between −1% and +1% of volumetric moisture
    and that 67% of the residues are between −3% and +3% of volumetric moisture. The
    quality of the estimate of soil moisture is therefore satisfying. Figure 13 Open

    of the ploughed horizon established by 2-D tomography and soil water content measured
    with TDR probes at the same time and the same location. Figure 14 Open in figure

    content measured by TDR probes and soil water content estimated from electrical

    7. Summary Statistics to Compare Soil Volumetric Water Content Estimated From
    Electrical Resistivity Tomography and That Measured With TDR Probes Depth, m n
    R ME, % RMSE, % 0.1 to 0.3 349 0.68 −1.45 3.63 0.1 96 0.75 −1.59 3.85 0.2 126
    0.76 −0.38 3.26 0.3 127 0.45 −2.40 3.80 [56] In Table 7, the highest correlation
    coefficient, the smallest bias and the greatest precision, reveal the best moisture
    estimation at a depth of 0.2 m. [57] Conversely, at a depth of 0.3 m the correlation
    coefficient between the calculated and measured moistures is the lowest, the estimation
    bias the highest and the estimation precision the worst. At this depth, the moisture
    seems slightly overestimated as the majority of the estimation residues (33%)
    is between −3% and −1% of volumetric water content. The presence of the plowed
    pan at a depth of 0.3 m may explain this low correlation. The plowed pan constitutes
    the limit between the plowed surface horizon and the structural horizon Sci1.
    At this level, the structure of the LAci horizon compacted by tillage is modified.
    The plowed pan is characterized by a major decrease in porosity and a modification
    of the hydrodynamic behavior of the horizon with a reduced infiltration. These
    changes explain why the calibration relationship of the LAci horizon is less adapted
    at this level and therefore why the correlation is lower. [58] Several factors
    may explain the deviation between the soil water content estimation using ERT
    and measured by the TDR probes. (1) One is the distance of about 1 m separating
    the multielectrode device from the TDR profiles while soil moisture varies on
    a decimeter scale. (2) Another is the effect of the sides of the trench on the
    water flow. (3) The difference between the soil resistivity during the monitoring
    and the resistivity calculated by the 2-D ERT inversion procedure is another factor.
    The precision of the inversion and therefore of the estimation of the soil resistivity
    depends, among other sources of uncertainties, on the configuration of the electrodes,
    the interval between the electrodes and the number of measurements of the apparent
    resistivity of the soil. (4) Although small electrodes were used to reduce the
    contact resistance between the soil and the electrode, it is difficult to consider
    them as points which would be necessary for surveys requiring high resolution
    and shallow investigation depths. (5) The resistivity of soils may be subject
    to hysteretic phenomena. (6) As the conduction of current in soils is mainly electrolytic,
    soil resistivity depends not only on moisture and temperature but also on the
    ionic concentration of the studied soil solutions. During the experiment, the
    soil solution may be diluted by irrigation water pumped into a stratified aquifer
    with a significant TDS loading [Schnebelen et al., 1999] leading to nonnegligible
    variations in the electrical resistivities. (7) The time (1 hour) needed to acquire
    a resistivity section is relatively long compared with the infiltration rate of
    water during irrigation. A device permitting more rapid data collection must be
    considered in the future. 7. Conclusions [59] Acquiring ERT data along a vertical
    soil section with a multielectrode surface method, which is nondestructive and
    spatially integrating, the boundaries of some soil horizons were delineated. Soil
    moisture changes over time were revealed by electrical resistivity changes in
    the soil. Two-dimensional soil water content sections were calculated from the
    ERT using field-scale calibration relationships between the electrical resistivity
    of each soil horizon and its water content. As the temperature variations in the
    soil affect the electrical resistivity of the water and therefore that of the
    soil, the thermal profile of the soil during the electrical resistivity measurements
    were taken into account in the calculation. A comparison of the modeled water
    contents with those measured by TDR probes confirmed that the reliability of a
    site-specific linear relationship between the calculated and measured moistures
    in the plowed LAci surface horizon. Overall, in the plowed surface horizon, the
    moisture estimates showed a precision of 3.6% for an estimation bias corresponding
    to a water content overestimation of 1.4%. The best estimation was obtained at
    20 cm depth where the effects of both large surface moisture fluctuations and
    compaction of the plowed pan were attenuated. [60] The hydraulic functioning of
    the soil was then monitored during a moistening/drying cycle. The drying out of
    the soil by corn root water uptake, the progression of the infiltration front
    after irrigation, the delimitation of preferential-flow zones and the surface
    drainage of the soil were identified and localized. At this stage of corn development
    (3 months), the parts of the soil involved in soil infiltration and drainage were
    mainly located directly under the corn rows. The corn plants played a major role
    in the redistribution of surface water before it infiltrated, while the role of
    the topography in water infiltration appeared to be limited. The particular structural
    characteristics of the soil horizons resulting from agricultural practices, and
    the notable effect of soil compaction due to the passage of agricultural machines
    were observed. In zones where the soil was compacted, moisture variations were
    negligible, which demonstrated the negative effects of compaction on water flow
    as well as on the possibilities of water storage. [61] Measurements of soil water
    content using conventional tools typically sampling over small volumes, at wide
    intervals, and in an intrusive manner, are generally less representative than
    the actual and very complex situation of the soil moisture state. They do not
    allow a good monitoring of the evolution of soil moisture. Estimation of water
    content using ERT as a first approximation of the spatial distribution of soil
    water content in a cultivated soil is shown to be significant. Nevertheless, the
    validity of the proposed model could be limited to specific regional conditions
    such as loamy clay soils of the Beauce region. [62] In the future, this method
    may allow verification of sprinkling irrigation efficiency and better estimation
    of the useful available water in the soil. Water spatial distribution is influenced
    by crop root distribution with depth, which is dependent on soil type and soil
    management as tillage operations. This method is a high-resolution investigation
    tool to study soil moisture and to perform soil water flow temporal monitoring.
    [63] The development and adoption of precision farming and rational irrigation
    require a detailed knowledge of soils and crops [Robert, 1999]. This method is
    useful in research to describe the soil spatial variability and its hydric behavior
    with a high resolution. However, the precision is higher than the investigation
    level required in precision farming, and the requirement of an additional field
    calibration may render the method impractical for routine field use. The use of
    a general petrophysical relationship between the soil electrical resistivity and
    its moisture, if appropriate, could reduce the effort needed to make this a practical
    field tool for the purpose of improving irrigation management. Acknowledgments

    efficiency of turfgrass, promoting water conservation and reducing environmental
    impacts. The objectives of this research were to quantify irrigation water use
    and to evaluate turf quality differences between (1) time-based scheduling with
    and without a rain sensor (RS); (2) a time-based schedule compared to a soil moisture
    sensor (SMS)-based irrigation system; and (3) different commercially available
    SMS systems. The experimental area consisted of common bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon
    (L.) Pers.] plots ( 3.7 m × 3.7 m ) , located in Gainesville, Fla. The monitoring
    period took place from July 20 to December 14, 2004, and from March 25 to August
    31, 2005. SMS-based treatments consisted of irrigating one, two, or seven days
    a week, each with four different commercial SMS brands. Time-based treatments
    with or without RS and a nonirrigated treatment were also implemented. Significant
    differences in turfgrass quality among treatments were not detected due to the
    sustained wet weather conditions during the testing periods. The treatment with
    the rain sensor resulted in 34% less water applied than that without the rain
    sensor (2-WORS) treatment. Most SMS brands recorded irrigation water savings compared
    to 2-WORS, ranging from 69 to 92% for three of four SMSs tested, depending on
    the irrigation frequency. Therefore, SMS systems represent a promising technology
    because of the water savings that they can achieve during wet weather conditions
    while maintaining acceptable turfgrass quality. Introduction Turfgrass is the
    main cultivated crop in Florida with nearly four times the acreage as the next
    largest crop, citrus (Hodges et al. 1994; USDA 2005). Irrigation of residential,
    commercial, industrial, and recreational turf areas is commonly employed to ensure
    acceptable turf quality. As a consequence of problems related to droughts, coupled
    with the steadily increasing demand for water, the state of Florida has imposed
    restrictions on irrigation water use. The development of best management practices
    (BMPs) for irrigation water use in turf has become an undeniable strategic, economic,
    and environmental issue for the state. New landscape irrigation technologies could
    improve irrigation efficiency by promoting water conservation and reducing environmental
    impacts. Florida receives an average of approximately 1,400 mm of rainfall a year,
    which varies depending on location in the state. Although rainfall, typically,
    exceeds evapotranspiration (ET), irrigation is required because total annual rainfall,
    typically, varies both geographically and temporally (USDA 1981; Carriker 2000;
    NOAA 2003), and lack of rainfall for even a few days causes depletion of moisture
    in the predominately sandy soils found in Florida (Carriker 2000; NRC 1996). Florida
    has the second largest withdrawal of groundwater for public supply in the United
    States. In 1995, nearly 93% of the population in Florida used groundwater as a
    drinking water source (Solley et al. 1998). Moreover, Florida has a fast-growing
    population with a net inflow of more than 1,100 people a day, and is projected
    to be the third most populous state in the nation by 2025 (OEDR 2006; USCB 2004a).
    The USCB estimated that Florida accounted for approximately 11% of all new homes
    constructed in the United States in 2003, the largest amount in any single state
    (USCB 2004b); the majority of them with an in-ground irrigation system (TBW 2005;
    Whitcomb 2005). As urban populations swell, pressures on limited supplies of clean
    water are increasing. Saltwater intrusion in the Floridan aquifer has been found
    in coastal Hillsborough, Manatee, and Sarasota counties (SWFWMD 2006). The primary
    use of residential outdoor water is irrigation. A study in the U.S. indicated
    that households that use automatic timers to control their irrigation systems
    use 47% more water outdoors than those without timers, homes with in-ground sprinkler
    systems use 35% more water outdoors than those without in-ground systems, and
    on average, 58% of household water is used outdoors (Mayer et al. 1999). In the
    Central Florida Ridge, the potable water used for landscape irrigation has been
    found to be as high as 74%, with an average of 64% (Haley et al. 2007), and even
    when irrigation is restricted to two days a week (SJRWMD 2006), typically, homeowners
    tended to overirrigate (Haley et al. 2007). Overirrigation or underirrigation
    negatively can affect turfgrass quality. It has been reported that deeper and
    less-frequent irrigation improves turfgrass quality. Augustin and Snyder (1984)
    concluded that this practice tended to reduce N leaching in sandy soils, increasing
    N utilization, resulting in a better color rating (better quality). Bonos and
    Murphy (1999) reported an increase in a Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.)
    cultivar root growth as drought stress was imposed. Jordan et al. (2003) found
    that bentgrass irrigated every 4 days produced a significantly larger and deeper
    root system, a higher shoot density, and higher overall plant health—resulting
    in greater turf quality—than that watered every 1 or 2 days (even under golf putting
    green management conditions). McCarty (2005) summarizes that drier soil conditions
    slow shoot growth, and increase root growth and leaf water content. Moreover,
    limitations to the establishment and survival of some turfgrass weeds (Colbaugh
    and Elmore 1985; Youngner et al. 1981), and reduction of some pathogen severity
    (Davis and Dernoeden 1991; Kackley et al. 1990) have been associated with deep,
    infrequent irrigation. Hence, better irrigation scheduling by homeowners may lead
    to improved turfgrass quality coupled with potential savings in irrigation water
    use. Over the last decade, the soil moisture sensor (SMS) industry has advanced
    dramatically. Two basic reasons can explain this advancement. The first has been
    the major development of computer technology, with more powerful, smaller, and
    more economical integrated circuits. The second phenomenon has been the significant
    advances in the application of electromagnetic methods to the measurement of soil
    water content. These methods make use of the high relative permittivity (dielectric
    constant) of water in soil to estimate water content. The relative permittivity
    of water is about 80, whereas the other components in soil, including air, have
    relative permittivities in the range of 1–7. Hence, methods that measure the relative
    permittivity are effective for the measurement of the soil water content (Topp
    2003). Combining computer technology and the soil dielectric concept has allowed
    manufacturers to design and produce a number of different types of inexpensive
    SMSs for soil moisture measurement. Automation of irrigation systems, based on
    SMS technology, has the potential to provide maximum water use efficiency, by
    maintaining soil moisture between a desired range that is optimal or adequate
    for plant growth and/or quality; allowing irrigation only when necessary (Muñoz-Carpena
    and Dukes 2005). A wide range of applications to automatically control irrigation
    events has been investigated in coarse textured soils. In Florida, switching tensiometers
    have been studied for agricultural production (Smajstrla and Koo 1986; Clark et
    al. 1994; Smajstrla and Locascio 1994; Muñoz-Carpena et al. 2003; Muñoz-Carpena
    et al. 2005), and for maintaining bermudagrass turf (Augustin and Snyder 1984).
    Although water savings were found, these investigations suggest that tensiometers
    require calibration and frequent maintenance, up to twice per week. Consequently,
    this technology has not been adopted to automate irrigation in Florida. Other
    types of sensors have been adapted to automate irrigation based on soil moisture
    status in Florida. Nogueira et al. (2002) used time-domain reflectometer (TDR)
    sensors to maintain soil moisture within two preset limits (upper and lower soil
    moisture thresholds). Dukes and Scholberg (2005) and Dukes et al. (2003) reported
    11 and 50% water savings—without diminishing yields—using TDR probes on sweet
    corn, and a commercially available dielectric sensor on green bell pepper, respectively.
    Granular matrix sensors (GMSs) have also been used to automatically irrigate agricultural
    crops (Muñoz-Carpena et al. 2003; Shock et al. 2002), and as with other solid-state
    sensors, do not require as much maintenance as tensiometers. Although SMSs have
    been successfully demonstrated in agriculture, they have found limited use in
    residential landscape irrigation. A study using GMSs to control urban landscape
    irrigation in Colorado, applied 533 mm of water for irrigation compared to the
    theoretical requirement of 726 mm ; a reduction of 27% (Qualls et al. 2001). Since
    1991 Florida law has required a rain sensor (RS) device or switch hooked up to
    all automatic lawn sprinkler systems (Florida Statutes, Chap. 373.62; http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?Mode=View%20Statutes&Submenu=1&Tab=statutes&CFID=8781381&CFTOKEN=75889146).
    A rain sensor is a piece of equipment designed to interrupt a scheduled cycle
    of an automatic irrigation timer when a specific amount of rainfall has occurred
    (Dukes and Haman 2002a). Benefits and advantages of its use are similar to those
    of SMSs, and have been summarized by Dukes and Haman (2002a). Even though RSs
    have been mandated on all automatic irrigation systems installed after 1991, and
    have been commercially available for many years, little evidence related to their
    usefulness and/or to quantify their water savings exists. The goal of this research
    was to find out if different SMS systems (sensor with a proprietary controller)
    could reduce irrigation water application—while maintaining acceptable turf quality—compared
    to various time-based irrigation schedules to simulate common homeowner practices.
    The objectives of this experiment were to quantify irrigation water use and to
    evaluate turf quality differences between: (1) time-based scheduling with and
    without an RS; (2) a time-based schedule compared to an SMS-based irrigation system;
    and (3) different commercially available irrigation SMS systems. Materials and
    Methods The experimental area was located at the Agricultural and Biological Engineering
    Department research facilities, University of Florida, Gainesville, Fla.; on an
    Arredondo fine sand (loamy, siliceous, semiactive, hyperthermic Grossarenic Paleudult)
    (Thomas et al. 1985; USDA 2007). This soil has a field capacity of 7% (volumetric
    moisture content), as determined from dry-down experiments on repacked soil columns
    (Cardenas-Lailhacar 2006) and according to testing on intact cores as reported
    by Carlisle et al. (1981). The site consists of 72 ( 3.7 m × 3.7 m ) plots on
    a field covered with well-established common bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.)
    Pers.]. Each plot was sprinkler irrigated by four quarter-circle, pop-up spray
    heads, with an average application rate of 38 mm ∕ h at 172 kPa (Hunter 12A, Hunter
    Industries, Inc., San Marcos, Calif.). Plots were mowed twice weekly at a height
    of 5.5 cm . Agrochemicals were applied as needed to control weeds and pests, with
    no visual toxicity signs on the bermudagrass after the applications. Nutrient
    applications were made using ammonium sulfate (21–0–0), at an N rate of 50 kg
    ∕ ha , in April and May of 2004, before the beginning of the experiment. Then,
    a granulated 16–4–8 controlled-release fertilizer (Professional Turf Fertilizer,
    TurfGro, Phoenix, Ariz.) was applied at an N–P–K rate of 180 – 45 – 90 kg ∕ ha
    , in July 2004 and April 2005. Four commercially available SMS systems were selected
    for evaluation: Acclima Digital TDT RS-500 (Acclima Inc., Meridian, Id.), Watermark
    200SS-5 (Irrometer Company, Inc., Riverside, Calif.), Rain Bird MS-100 (Rain Bird
    International, Inc., Glendora, Calif.), and Water Watcher DPS-100 (Water Watcher,
    Inc., Logan, Utah), codified as AC, IM, RB, and WW, respectively. Each SMS system
    included a sensor to be buried in the soil and a controller, which could be adjusted
    to different soil water thresholds. All controllers were connected in series with
    typical residential irrigation timers. Cardenas-Lailhacar (2006) presented photographs
    of each SMS system and of the experimental site. The IM controllers were set at
    Number 1 (equivalent to 10 kPa of soil tension according to the manufacturer),
    whereas the AC controllers were set on their display at a volumetric moisture
    content (VMC) of 7%, where a soil tension of 10 kPa and a VMC of 7% were taken
    as approximately field capacity (Cardenas-Lailhacar 2006). Following manufacturer
    recommendations to find a set point close to field capacity, the RB and WW controllers
    were set at their thresholds 24 h after a significant rainfall event (which happened
    on July 20, 2004, after four days of rain, with a total of 107 mm that filled
    the soil profile with water). The RB controllers have a scale from a dry (#1)
    to a wet (#9) condition, and their thresholds were found by moving and setting
    the knob at the driest point (#2.5, in this case) where it would bypass irrigation,
    as indicated by a light-emitting diode (LED). On the WWs, initially the threshold
    could not be set, since the soil moisture was below the measurement range of the
    controller. After discussion with the manufacturer, a 1,000 Ω resistor was added
    between the solenoid valve port and the valve common port, which allowed the controller
    to read the low VMC at field capacity of this sandy soil. The calibration procedure
    consisted of setting the knob in the middle of the scale (dimensionless), and
    pushing the calibration button, which allowed its autoset point. It is important
    to note that following these methods the thresholds on the RB and WW controllers
    could not be associated with a specific soil VMC prior to the experiment. However,
    in order to find similar outcomes to those that homeowners would encounter, SMS
    systems were planned to be used directly “out of the box,” following manufacturer
    recommendations for installation and set points; a circumstance that could not
    be immediately accomplished in the aforementioned WW case. Treatments Two basic
    types of treatments were defined: SMS-based treatments, and time-based treatments
    (Table 1). All four SMS brands were tested at three irrigation frequencies: one,
    two, and seven days per week (1, 2, and 7 day ∕ week , respectively), resulting
    in 12 SMS/frequency combinations. The 1 and 2 day ∕ week watering frequencies
    represent typical day of the week irrigation restrictions imposed in Florida (FDEP
    2006; SJRWMD 2006). Within the time-based treatments, a frequency of 2 day ∕ week
    was defined (the most common in Florida, and current watering restriction in the
    study area). To simulate requirements imposed on homeowners by Florida Statutes
    (Chap. 373.62), two time-based treatments were connected to a rain sensor: with-rain
    sensor (2-WRS) and deficit-with-rain sensor (2-DWRS). The rain sensor (Mini-click
    II, Hunter Industries, Inc., San Marcos, Calif.) was set at a 6 mm rainfall threshold.
    A without-rain-sensor treatment (2-WORS) was also included, in order to simulate
    homeowner irrigation systems with an absent or nonfunctional rain sensor. Finally,
    a nonirrigated treatment (0-NI) was implemented as a control for turfgrass quality.
    Experimental treatments were replicated four times, in a completely randomized
    design. Table 1. Irrigation Treatment Codes and Descriptions Treatmentcodes Irrigation

    depth was programmed to replace 100% of the monthly historical net irrigation
    requirement, based on recommendations by Dukes and Haman (2002b) for the area
    where this experiment was carried out (Table 2). All treatments were programmed
    to apply the same amount of irrigation per week, except for treatments 2-DWRS
    (60% of this amount), and 0-NI. Therefore, differences in water application among
    treatments would be the result of sensors bypassing scheduled irrigation cycles.

    on two ESP-6, and three ESP-4Si model timers (Rain Bird International, Inc., Glendora,
    Calif.) set to start between 1 and 5 a.m., with the purpose of diminishing wind
    drift and decreasing evaporation, and to mimic water use restrictions where this
    study was carried out, that prohibit irrigation between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. (SJRWMD
    2006). Uniformity Testing A uniformity test was conducted for each plot with 16
    catch-cans on a 0.9 m × 0.9 m grid spacing. To minimize edge effects, this grid
    was positioned 0.4 m inside the plot boundaries. The cans had an opening diameter
    of 15.9 cm and a depth of 20.3 cm . Pressure at the two farthest plots was measured
    to ensure adequate sprinkler operation. The system was set to run for 35 min ,
    to ensure that the average water application depth was at least 13 mm . Wind velocity
    during the test period was measured with a hand held anemometer. The American
    Society of Agricultural Engineers (ASAE) standards (ASAE 2000) allow uniformity
    testing with wind speeds up to 5 m ∕ s . However, if wind was over 2.5 m ∕ s or
    the distribution was affected by wind gusts, the test was discontinued. The low-quarter
    irrigation distribution uniformity ( DU lq ) was calculated with the following
    equation (Merriam and Keller 1978): DU lq = D ¯ lq D ¯ tot (1) where D ¯ lq =
    mean of the lowest 25% of a group of catch-can measurements; and D ¯ tot = overall
    mean of a group of catch-can measurements. The irrigation uniformity tests resulted
    in a wide range of DU lq values across the plots (0.15–0.79), with an average
    of 0.52 that, according to the Irrigation Association (IA 2005) overall system
    quality ratings, is considered “fair.” The very low values denoted some performance
    problems (partially or completely clogged nozzles, spray heads below the mowing
    height, spray heads misaligned, etc.) that were fixed after the test was run.
    Even when a new DU lq test was not performed after the repairs, observations denoted
    a substantial improvement on the plots with low DU lq values. As a comparison,
    Baum et al. (2005) performed uniformity tests on irrigation systems of homes in
    central Florida having spray heads, and found an average DU lq of 0.41, with a
    range of 0.12–0.67. Thus, the irrigation uniformity of the experimental plots
    was representative of actual homes. In addition, Dukes et al. (2006) reported
    that catch-can DU lq as low as 0.40 did not result in reduced soil water DU lq
    of approximately 0.75. The writers concluded that the soil system and plant canopy
    can buffer low catch-can DU lq values resulting in a higher effective irrigation
    uniformity. Soil Moisture Sensor Installation According to manufacturer recommendations,
    the SMSs should be buried in the driest zone of a multiple-zone system. Accordingly,
    to identify the driest and wettest plots in the experimental area, a volumetric
    soil moisture survey assessment was carried out on each plot. In addition, because
    64 plots were required, this analysis was used to discard eight plots from a pool
    of 72 plots available. On March 12, 2004, after 14 days without rainfall, a relatively
    “dry” soil moisture condition was evident. The volumetric moisture content was
    measured in each plot by means of a hand held TDR device, which measured the moisture
    in the top 20 cm (Field Scout 300, Spectrum Technologies, Inc., Plainfield, Ill.).
    Measurements were taken at five locations in the center 1 m × 1 m of each plot
    and averaged. On March 17, 2004, 24 h after a 23 mm rainfall filled the soil profile,
    the volumetric moisture content in a “wet” condition was measured as well. Two
    plots had significantly higher VMC, under both the wet and the dry condition,
    so they were discarded. Six plots were also discarded because they had the absolute
    lowest VMC values of all plots, even when they were not statistically different
    ( P > 0.95 ) , coupled with a comparatively lower turfgrass quality before the
    beginning of the experiment. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the remaining
    64 plots, indicated that only two plots were significantly wetter than the rest
    ( P > 0.95 ) in the wet condition, so they were discarded as locations for SMS
    placement. In the dry condition, there were not statistical differences ( P >
    0.95 ) in the soil moisture levels. Thus, the plots selected to bury the SMSs
    were the absolute driest ones and/or the most convenient for sensor installation.
    Moreover, in the dry condition, the soil moisture content (5.2–6.8%) was not significantly
    different ( P > 0.999 ) across sensor control plots. In all cases, SMSs were installed
    in the center of the plots, in the top 7 – 10 cm of the soil, where most of the
    roots were observed. The plots with the sensors were used to control irrigation
    in three other plots for a total of four replications for each treatment. Irrigation
    Management and Data Collection Data were obtained from July 20 to December 14
    of 2004 and from March 25 to August 31 of 2005. Water application data were collected
    independently for each plot. Pulse-type positive displacement flowmeters (PSMT
    20 mm × 190 mm , Amco Water Metering Systems, Inc., Ocala, Fla.) were connected
    to nine AM16/32 multiplexers (Campbell Scientific, Logan, Utah), which were hooked
    up to a CR 10 × model datalogger (Campbell Scientific, Logan, Utah), to continually
    record the irrigation date and volume applied to each plot. In addition, flowmeters
    were read manually each week to verify automatically acquired data. Weather data
    were collected by an automated weather station (Campbell Scientific, Logan, Utah),
    located beside the experimental site. Measurements, made every 15 min , included
    air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction, solar radiation,
    barometric pressure, and soil heat flux. Rainfall was recorded continuously by
    a manual rain gauge during 2004 and 2005, and also by a tipping bucket rain gauge
    in 2005. Both methods agreed well ( R 2 = 0.99 ) when measured over a period of
    212 days , encompassing 73 rain events that ranged from 0.3 to 50.3 mm . Turfgrass
    quality was visually assessed and rated using a scale of 1–9, where “1” represents
    brown, dormant, or dead turf, and “9” represents the best quality (Skogley and
    Sawyer 1992). A rating of 5 was considered the minimum acceptable turf quality
    for a lawn turfgrass. Ratings were carried out by the same person in July, October,
    and December of 2004, and in April, May, and July of 2005. Statistical data analyses
    were performed using the general linear model (GLM) procedure of the Statistical
    Analysis System software (SAS 2003). Analysis of variance was used to determine
    treatment differences for a completely randomized design and Duncan’s multiple
    range test was used to identify mean differences. Results and Discussion Environmental
    Conditions Table 3 summarizes the monthly mean average air temperature, relative
    humidity, wind speed, total rainfall, and crop evapotrans-piration during the
    experiment period. In general, favorable conditions prevailed for the growth and
    development of the bermudagrass. However, in December of 2004 the average air
    temperature began to gradually decline and, on December 15, 2004, the bermudagrass
    went dormant. The irrigation treatments were discontinued until the bermudagrass
    greened up again, on March 24, 2005. Table 3. Weather Conditions and Estimated

    ( ET c ) calculated from reference evapotranspiration ( ET o ) and specific crop
    coefficient ( K c ) values ( ET c = ET o * K c ) . ET o was calculated from the
    Penman–Monteith equation, with a crop coefficient K c = 0.85 for established bermudagrass,
    as described in FAO-56 by Allen et al. (1998). Both 2004 and 2005 were rainy years
    (Figs. 1 and 2), with high frequent rainfall and a large amount of cumulative
    precipitation, which is not uncommon in this region. During 2004, a tropical storm
    and two hurricanes—Frances and Jeanne—passed over the research area during the
    experiment. Even while 2005 broke all records for the number of hurricanes and
    named tropical storms in the United States, none of them directly hit the experiment
    site. Nonetheless, during the 2005 data collection period, 40% of the days had
    rainfall events, totaling 732 mm (13% more than historical rainfall for this time
    period), and averaging 135 mm ∕ month . In 2004, even though it rained less frequently
    (31% of the days), the cumulative rainfall for the experimental period was even
    larger, with 944 mm (88% more than historical rainfall), and more than 190 mm
    ∕ month on average. However, most of this rainfall (56%) occurred during the tropical
    storm and the two hurricanes. If these events were not considered, a total of
    414 mm with an average of 84 mm ∕ month fell during 2004. Fig. 1. Daily and cumulative
    rainfall in 2004. Note: rainfall for September 5 ( 188 mm ) and September 6 (
    81 mm ) are shown as a cumulative total ( 269 mm ) . Fig. 2. Daily and cumulative
    rainfall in 2005 Time-Based Treatments In Table 4, Comparison A shows that the
    three time-based treatments (2-WORS, 2-WRS, and 2-DWRS) were significantly different
    ( P < 0.0001 ) from each other during this study. Treatment 2-WRS ( 2 day ∕ week
    , with a rain sensor) was established to mimic a homeowner complying with irrigation
    regulations and setting the timer according to recommended practices. This treatment
    accounted for 995 mm of water, or an equivalent of 98 mm ∕ month . A recent study,
    carried out by Haley et al. (2007) in Central Florida, within the St. Johns River
    Water Management District, found that homeowners with automatic irrigation systems
    applied 149 mm ∕ month on average. Therefore, the comparisons made here may be
    considered conservative and differences in the results for actual homeowners could
    be larger. Table 4. Total Cumulative Irrigation Depth Applied to Treatments, Statistical

    Different letters within a column indicate statistical difference at P < 0.05

    profile, imitated by treatment 2-DWRS ( 2 day ∕ week , with a rain sensor, and
    60% of 2-WRS), applied 63% of the water applied by 2-WRS, close to the target
    of 60%. The total depth was 623 mm , or an equivalent of 61 mm ∕ month . The treatment
    simulating an irrigation system with an absent or nonfunctional rain sensor (2-WORS)
    accounted for 1514 mm , or 148 mm ∕ month . Thus, this treatment applied 52% more
    water than the treatment with a functional rain sensor (2-WRS), whereas 2-WRS
    saved 34% of the water applied by 2-WORS. These results demonstrate the importance
    of a functional and well-maintained rain shut-off device on all automated irrigation
    systems in Florida; where rainy weather is common (NOAA 2003). Moreover, as the
    study prepared by Whitcomb (2005) recently found, just 25% of the surveyed homeowners
    in Florida with automatic irrigation systems reported having a rain sensor, and
    the author speculated that they are often incorrectly installed. Therefore, appropriately
    installed and properly working rain sensors could signify not only substantial
    water savings to homeowners, but could also lead to sound environmental and economic
    benefits to the state. Moreover, Cardenas-Lailhacar and Dukes (2008) found that
    rain sensors under the climate conditions of this study have a payback period
    of less than a year when set at thresholds of 13 mm or less. Time-Based Treatments
    versusSMS-BasedTreatments. Table 4 (Comparison B) shows that there was a significant
    ( P < 0.0001 ) difference between the averages of time-based and SMS-based treatments;
    with 1,044 and 420 mm of cumulative irrigation depth, respectively. Thus, the
    SMS-based treatments, on average, significantly reduced the amount of irrigation
    water applied compared to the time-based treatments, even when an operative rain
    sensor was an important component on two of the three time-based treatments. Moreover,
    72% of the water applied by 2-WORS was saved on average by the SMS-based treatments.
    Comparisons between SMS-Irrigation Frequencies When the averages of the three
    different SMS irrigation frequencies were analyzed (Table 4, Comparison C), the
    2 day ∕ week frequency applied significantly ( P < 0.0001 ) more water, followed
    by the 1 day ∕ week frequency, with 478 and 420 mm of total cumulative water depth,
    respectively. Although a wide range of variation was apparent across the sensor
    brands, the 7 day ∕ week frequency resulted in a significantly lower depth applied
    of all three frequencies, with an average of 362 mm , because two of four 7 day
    ∕ week treatments (7-AC and 7-RB) bypassed more scheduled irrigation events due
    to frequent rainfall (Figs. 1 and 2). Water Savings Table 4 shows the water savings
    (%) of each treatment compared to the time-based treatments 2-DWRS, 2-WRS, and
    2-WORS. Treatments 7-AC and 7-RB achieved the highest amounts of water savings
    throughout this experiment and, as expected, 2-WORS applied more water than all
    the other treatments. On the other hand, the IMs always allowed more water to
    be applied compared to the other brands in every frequency tested. This could
    be due to their reported limitations to timely sense differences in soil water
    content, their hysteretic behavior, the high variability of readings, and their
    limitations in sandy soils, where low tension values are necessary to prevent
    plant stress (Irmak and Haman 2001; Taber et al. 2002: Intrigliolo and Castel
    2004; McCann et al. 1992). When compared to the water conservative 2-DWRS treatment,
    brands AC, RB, and WW showed water savings that ranged from 44 to 80%, 55 to 76%,
    and 26 to 57%, respectively. On the other hand, all IM frequencies applied more
    irrigation than 2-DWRS, with values that ranged from 15 to 77% more water. Treatment
    2-IM was the only SMS-based treatment that applied more water than the time-based
    2-WRS (11%). Conversely, 1-IM and 7-IM reduced water application 20 and 28%, respectively,
    compared to 2-WRS. However, these last proportions were far from the water savings
    achieved by the other SMS-based treatments, when compared to 2-WRS: AC sensors
    recorded irrigation water savings ranging from 65 to 88%, RBs from 72 to 85%,
    and WWs from 54 to 73%, depending on the irrigation frequency tested. It is important
    to remark that these water savings were on top of those already achieved by 2-WRS.
    Therefore, these results show that, in general, SMSs can also act as rain shut-off
    devices, although with a superior performance than rain sensors in terms of water
    savings. When the irrigation treatments were compared to more than 75% of the
    surveyed homeowners in Florida (Whitcomb 2005), with a nonfunctional or absent
    rain sensor (2-WORS), the difference in water savings increased, ranging from
    77 to 92% for ACs, 81 to 90% for RBs, 69 to 82% for WWs, and 27 to 53% for IMs.
    Even 2-IM (which applied 11% more water than 2-WRS) showed water savings (27%)
    with respect to 2-WORS, indicating that this sensor was operative but did not
    bypass as many scheduled irrigation cycles as other SMS-based treatments. These
    results clearly demonstrate that the use of SMSs (along with traditional timers
    in residential irrigation systems) could lead to water savings more than twice
    as much as a rain sensor device alone, even when the time schedule is programmed
    to provide 60% of net irrigation requirements. Automation of Irrigation Systems
    Complete automation of a residential irrigation system, based on SMSs, could be
    achieved by programming the timer to run every day as a scheduling strategy. Then,
    SMSs will allow the system to initiate the scheduled irrigation cycles only when
    it is actually needed by the turfgrass (or other irrigated plant type), and override
    cycles when the sensed water content is over a preset threshold. In this experiment,
    this type of control was confirmed when the 7 day ∕ week irrigation frequency
    applied significantly less water than the other frequencies (Table 4, Comparison
    C), and when two of the SMS-based treatments, programmed to run 7 day ∕ week ,
    consistently applied the smallest amount of water. In effect, treatments 7-AC
    and 7-RB recorded total water savings of 85% or more, when compared to 2-WRS,
    and 90% or more when compared to 2-WORS. This concept (with a potential irrigation
    frequency of seven days a week) seems contradictory to the water use regulations
    and restrictions imposed by the Water Management Districts and/or municipalities
    in Florida (where irrigation is allowed only one or two days per week). However,
    during wet weather conditions these results suggest that setting the correct threshold,
    and programming the automatic irrigation system to run everyday for a short period
    of time (allowing the SMS to decide whether to irrigate), could save large amounts
    of water and may be a more effective water conservation strategy than day of the
    week watering windows. Moreover, this concept is not in opposition to the general
    recommendation for deeper and less frequent irrigation for turfgrass, because
    these treatments (7-AC and 7-RB) overrode almost every scheduled irrigation cycle,
    resulting in a low actual irrigation frequency, which was supplemented by large
    and/or frequent rainfall events that filled the profile (Figs. 1 and 2). Nonetheless,
    it is important to note that this technology and frequency needs to be evaluated
    during dry weather conditions to be sure that turfgrass quality does not decline
    due to reduced irrigation application. Turfgrass Quality Differences in turfgrass
    quality, including nonirrigated plots, were not detected among treatments, and
    always exceeded the minimum acceptable rating of 5. This result is explained in
    part by the generally wet weather conditions that prevailed through most of the
    experiment, which favored the growth and development of the bermudagrass (Table
    3, and Figs. 1 and 2). Another factor contributing to the general good turf quality
    observed, even during the short “dry” periods, could be found in the species itself.
    Common bermudagrass is known as a more drought-tolerant grass compared to the
    pervasive St. Augustinegrass [Stenotaphrum secundatum (Walt.) Kuntze] found in
    north-central Florida landscapes (Harivandi et al. 2001; Baldwin et al. 2006;
    Turgeon 2005). As a result, the treatment effects were buffered with respect to
    the turfgrass quality parameters, and it could be concluded that no irrigation
    was necessary to maintain an acceptable turf quality during the experiment time
    period. Jordan et al. (2003) obtained similar results working with bentgrass,
    when frequent rainfall coupled with high relative humidity conditions overrode
    the effects of the irrigation frequency treatments on turf quality. Conclusions
    High-frequency rainfall events and a large amount of cumulative precipitation,
    coupled with favorable environmental conditions, favored the growth and development
    of the bermudagrass during the timeframe of this research. The three time-based
    treatments (2-WORS, 2-WRS, and 2-DWRS) were significantly different from each
    other during the study period. The treatment with a functional rain sensor (2-WRS),
    at a 6 mm threshold, applied significantly less water (34%) than the without rain
    sensor treatment (2-WORS), showing the importance of a well-maintained rain shut-off
    device in all automated irrigation systems in Florida. On the other hand, treatment
    2-DWRS, applied close to the desired 60% of the water applied by 2-WRS. These
    time-based treatments were established to mimic the operation of irrigation systems
    carried out by different homeowner profiles. However, according to the results
    of this research, these treatments were fairly well managed compared to homeowners’
    actual operation practices in the Central Florida Ridge. Therefore, results in
    water use from this experiment can be considered conservative and differences
    for actual homeowners could be even larger. For the SMS treatments, all three
    irrigation frequencies tested (1, 2, and 7 day ∕ week ) were significantly different.
    The 2 day ∕ week frequency applied the highest volume of water, followed by the
    1 day ∕ week frequency, and the 7 day ∕ week was the one that applied the least
    amount of water. These results suggest that scheduling high-frequency irrigation
    cycles ( 7 day ∕ week ) in closed control loop irrigation systems appears to be
    a viable strategy regarding water conservation for turfgrass irrigation in Florida’s
    sandy soils during rainy periods. Moreover, it was concluded that irrigation was
    not necessary to maintain acceptable turf quality during the experimental period,
    which was evidenced by acceptable quality in nonirrigated plots. The results showed
    that, on average, the SMS-based treatments were significantly more efficient as
    a means to save water than the time-based treatments. However, not all SMS treatments
    tested performed the same. The 2-IM treatment was the only SMS-based treatment
    that applied significantly more water than 2-WRS (11%). The other two IM treatments,
    1-IM and 7-IM, applied less water than 2-WRS (20 and 28%, respectively), but always
    applied more water than the other brands/treatments in every frequency tested.
    The other brands (AC, RB, and WW) resulted in irrigation water savings compared
    to 2-WRS, which ranged from 54 to 88%, depending on the irrigation frequency.
    These results showed that most SMSs can also act as rain sensors, with superior
    performance in terms of water savings. When these last brands were compared to
    2-WORS, the differences in water savings increased, and ranged from 69 to 92%
    over the 308 - day study period. It should be noted that the specific performance
    of the individual sensors largely depends on the threshold setting and the sensor
    burial depth. Even when sensor burial depths were as similar as practically possible
    in this experiment, the sensor thresholds might have varied slightly, hence, affecting
    the results to some extent. In any case, soil moisture sensor systems appear to
    be a promising technology that could lead to a complete automation of residential
    irrigation systems, to substantial savings in irrigation water, and to sound environmental
    and economic benefits to the state. Testing this technology with actual irrigation
    systems on homes is recommended to validate these results. Acknowledgments The

    9 Altmetric Explore all metrics Abstract Irrigation in the Central Valley of California
    is essential for successful wine grape production. With reductions in water availability
    in much of California due to drought and competing water-use interests, it is
    important to optimize irrigation management strategies. In the current study,
    we investigate the utility of satellite-derived maps of evapotranspiration (ET)
    and the ratio of actual-to-reference ET (fRET) based on remotely sensed land-surface
    temperature (LST) imagery for monitoring crop water use and stress in vineyards.
    The Disaggregated Atmosphere Land EXchange Inverse (ALEXI/DisALEXI) surface-energy
    balance model, a multi-scale ET remote-sensing framework with operational capabilities,
    is evaluated over two Pinot noir vineyard sites in central California that are
    being monitored as part of the Grape Remote-Sensing Atmospheric Profile and Evapotranspiration
    eXperiment (GRAPEX). A data fusion approach is employed to combine ET time-series
    retrievals from multiple satellite platforms to generate estimates at both the
    high spatial (30 m) and temporal (daily) resolution required for field-scale irrigation
    management. Comparisons with micrometeorological data indicate reasonable model
    performance, with mean absolute errors of 0.6 mm day−1 in ET at the daily time
    step and minimal bias. Values of fRET agree well with tower observations and reflect
    known irrigation. Spatiotemporal analyses illustrate the ability of ALEXI/DisALEXI/data
    fusion package to characterize heterogeneity in ET and fRET both within a vineyard
    and over the surrounding landscape. These findings will inform the development
    of strategies for integrating ET mapping time series into operational irrigation
    management framework, providing actionable information regarding vineyard water
    use and crop stress at the field and regional scale and at daily to multi-annual
    time scales. Similar content being viewed by others Improving the spatiotemporal

    in the California Central Valley Article 23 April 2022 Introduction Water management
    is a critical aspect of successful grape production in California’s Central Valley,
    which represents over 400,000 ha valued at approximately 6 billion dollars (California
    Department of Food and Agriculture and USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service
    2016). Despite competing water-use interests and a reduction in water availability
    over much of California due to recent long-term droughts, vineyard acreage and
    production continues to increase, with acreage devoted to wine grapes increasing
    by 12,950 ha between years 2013 and 2016 (California Department of Food and Agriculture
    and USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service 2017). As such, there is significant
    interest in developing efficient water management strategies for these viticulture
    production systems. The adoption of an appropriate and efficient irrigation strategy
    for a specific vineyard is predicated on understanding and controlling the vine
    water stress throughout the season (Girona et al. 2009; van Leeuwen et al. 2009;
    Basile et al. 2011). Moderate vine water stress, achieved through the practice
    of deficit irrigation can improve the composition/quality of grapes used in wine
    production (Williams and Matthews 1990; Williams et al. 1994). The standard indicator
    for vine water stress is the leaf water potential (ΨL), commonly measured using
    a pressure chamber. In some cases, pressure bomb measurements are used in scheduling
    irrigation for commercial vineyards (Girona et al. 2006). However, this practice
    requires individual leaf measurements, limiting its suitability for application
    over large heterogeneous areas. Techniques for mapping ΨL have been developed
    using high-resolution thermal imagery to isolate plant canopy temperatures (Bellvert
    et al. 2016). This technique could be used for mapping variability in vine stress
    across vineyards; however, it would be challenging to provide this information
    on a routine basis over large regions and may require calibration for different
    climates and vine varieties. An additional tool for monitoring water stress and
    use in vineyards is measurement of evapotranspiration (ET), which quantifies water
    loss from the vine and surface to the atmosphere. Numerous studies have explored
    various methods and techniques to measure vineyard ET or water use, including
    lysimeters (Johnson et al. 2005; Azevedo et al. 2008; Netzer et al. 2009), eddy
    covariance (Spano et al. 2000; Ortega-Farias et al. 2010; Rodriguez et al. 2010),
    heat pulse or heat balance (Trambouze et al. 1998; Yunusa et al. 1997; Intrigliolo
    et al. 2009; Zhang et al. 2010), surface renewal energy balance (Castellvi and
    Snyder 2010; Moratiel and Martinez-Cob 2012), Bowen ratio energy balance (Yunusa
    et al. 2004; Teixeira et al. 2007; Zhang et al. 2011), soil water balance (Singleton
    and Maudsley 1996; Fooladmand and Sepaskhah 2009; Cancela et al. 2012), and the
    most common and simplest approach, the FAO-56 method (Allen et al. 1998). However,
    like the leaf water potential measurement method, these approaches simply provide
    point measurements that are difficult to extrapolate over larger areas or fields,
    and fail to indicate in-field spatial variability (Teixeira et al. 2007). Such
    spatial variability limits the effective use of irrigation water. Uniform irrigation
    across a vineyard with variable biomass and soil texture, implying differences
    in plant growth and water requirements, will result in the over- or under-watering
    in these anomalous sections within the vineyard. This will result in variability
    in vegetative growth across the vineyard, and result in non-uniform yield and
    grape composition/quality (Bramley and Hamilton 2004; Bramley et al. 2005; Bellvert
    et al. 2012). Errors are further compounded when extrapolating to vineyards outside
    the area of in-situ ET data collection. Satellite remote-sensing technology offers
    the possibility of providing routine spatial information useful for determining
    sub-field and inter-field-scale heterogeneity in plant conditions and water use.
    Satellite retrievals of land-surface temperature (LST), derived from thermal infrared
    (TIR) imagery, have been shown to be particularly useful for estimating ET and
    plant stress due to the sensitivity of soil and canopy temperatures to variable
    soil moisture availability (Moran 2003). Several TIR-based ET mapping algorithms
    have been developed over the past few decades (e.g., Bastiaanssen et al. 1998,
    Su 2002; Allen et al. 2007; Anderson et al. 1997). Due to significant uncertainties
    associated with determining accurate atmospherically and emissivity corrected
    surface temperature data, most TIR-based models use relative measures of LST variability
    to parameterize ET estimates rather than the absolute LST values (Anderson et
    al. 1997, 2012). This is accomplished either through using an end-member pixel
    scaling method (spatial variability) or a time-differential method (temporal variability).
    For example, the Surface-Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL; Bastiaanssen
    et al. 1998) and the Mapping Evapotranspiration with Internalized Calibration
    (METRIC; Allen et al. 2007) methods use TIR end-member pixels within a satellite
    image to represent limiting (minimal ET; hot pixel) and non-limiting (potential
    ET; cold pixel) moisture conditions. The Atmosphere Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI;
    Anderson et al. 1997, 2007a, b) surface-energy balance model uses the time-differential
    approach, relating changes in morning LST derived from geostationary satellites
    to surface moisture availability and latent heat flux. ALEXI is based on the Two-Source
    Energy Balance (TSEB) land-surface representation originally described by Norman
    et al. (1995). The TSEB can also be used to downscale ALEXI fluxes to finer, sub-field
    scales using an associated flux disaggregation technique (DisALEXI; Norman et
    al. 2003). Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of TIR-based ET approaches
    for monitoring water use and stress within vineyards (Semmens et al. 2016; Xia
    et al. 2016). Specifically, Semmens et al. (2016) applied the ALEXI/DisALEXI modeling
    system, integrated with a data fusion methodology (Gao et al. 2006), to estimate
    daily ET at 30 m spatial resolution over two Pinot noir vineyards near Lodi in
    the Central Valley of California for the 2013 growing season, demonstrating good
    agreement with ground-based flux measurements. Moreover, Xia et al. (2016) evaluated
    TSEB model performance over these two vineyards at high spatial resolution (≤ 1
    m) using thermal and multispectral remote-sensing data from low-altitude aircraft
    over the same two vineyards. Results indicate that the TSEB can derive reliable
    ET patterns at sub-field scale under a wide range of environmental conditions.
    The current study expands upon results presented in Semmens et al. (2016), extending
    the analysis to multiple years to promote a comprehensive understanding of seasonal
    flux dynamics within the unique canopy architecture of vineyards, especially during
    the early spring season when timing of the initiation of irrigation and subsequent
    water-use estimates can have significant errors. In this study, daily 30 m ET
    maps over the Lodi vineyard landscape are evaluated over the period 2013–2016,
    including an extended period of severe drought when water resources in the Central
    Valley became increasingly limited. An analysis is also included on the ratio
    of actual-to-reference ET (fRET), an indicator of crop moisture and stress conditions,
    and its linkages on both spatial and temporal scales to criteria used in irrigation
    decision making. The current study aims to demonstrate the utility of remotely
    sensed ET and fRET mapping time series in support of an operational irrigation
    management framework, supplying reliable spatiotemporal information on vineyard
    water use and crop stress at the field and regional scale and at daily to annual
    time scales. Materials and methods Study area The model study domain includes
    two vineyard sites located in the Central Valley of California near the town of
    Lodi, using data collected as part of the USDA-ARS Grape Remote-Sensing Atmospheric
    Profile and Evapotranspiration eXperiment (GRAPEX) (Kustas et al. 2018). Both
    the northern (site 1) and the southern (site 2) vineyards are planted with Pinot
    noir vines trained on quadrilateral cordons with drip irrigation installed. Both
    sites have vine heights that vary between 2 and 2.5 m, with space between rows
    of 3.3 m, space between vines of 1.5 m, and an east–west row orientation. The
    northern site has an area of 35 ha with vines planted in 2009. The southern site
    is smaller and less mature, with an area of 21 ha and vines planted in 2011, resulting
    in lower biomass/leaf area than the northern field. In these plots, vines typically
    leaf out in late March, grow through late August, with grape harvest occurring
    in early September. Flux tower were installed in 2013 approximately half-way north–south
    along the eastern edge of each field, located to maximize fetch as the predominant
    wind direction is from the west during the growing season. These towers continue
    to operate through the 2017 growing season. Field measurements Micrometeorological
    and biological field measurements collected during GRAPEX are designed to serve
    as validation data for models developed to estimate ET and component vine and
    inter-row fluxes, detect stress, and monitor biomass development and root zone
    soil water availability. Both vineyards are equipped with identical micrometeorological
    instrumentation and started recording in late March of 2013. Measurements include
    turbulence and mean profile measurements of wind, surface-energy balance flux
    estimates, temperature and water vapor, as well as ground-based biophysical measurements
    such as leaf area index (LAI). The eddy covariance (EC) systems include a Campbell
    Scientific, Inc. EC150 water vapor/carbon dioxide sensor and a CSAT3 three-dimensional
    sonic anemometer. Both instruments are mounted 5 m above local ground level (a.g.l.)
    facing due west, collecting data at 20 Hz producing 15 min averages. Additional
    instrumentation includes a four-component radiometer (CNR-1, Kipp and Zonen, Delft,
    Netherlands) mounted 6 m a.g.l., upward and downward facing quantum sensors (LI-190,
    Li-Cor, Lincoln, Nebraska) mounted 6 m a.g.l., a combined humidity and temperature
    sensor (HMP45C, Vaisala, Helsinki, Finland) mounted 5 m a.g.l., two thermal infrared
    thermometers (SI-111, Campbell Scientific) mounted 2.5 m a.g.l. used to measure
    both surface and canopy temperature, a tipping bucket rain gauge (TE525, Texas
    Electronics, Dallas, Texas), and five soil heat flux plates (HFT-3, Radiation
    Energy Balance Systems, Bellevue, Washington) buried cross-row at a depth of 8
    cm. Each heat flux plate includes two thermocouples buried at depths of 2 and
    6 cm and a soil moisture sensor (HydraProbe, Stevens Water Monitoring System,
    Portland, Oregon) buried at 5 cm depth. 1 Post-processing of the 20 Hz eddy covariance
    data for computing sensible and latent heat fluxes is described by Alfieri et
    al. (2018). Energy balance flux measurements used in this study were collected
    between April 16, 2013 and October 19, 2016. During this period, typical closure
    ratios were on the order of 0.91 for Site 1 and 0.88 for Site 2. Original and
    closure-adjusted latent heat flux (LE) measurements were compared to modeled LE
    estimates to determine degree of agreement between measured and modeled fluxes.
    Since daily totals are used for model validation, observed fluxes were corrected
    for closure errors using the residual (RE) method as opposed to Bowen Ratio (BR)
    method (which often yields spurious results for nighttime conditions) described
    in Twine et al. (2000). Measurements of water applied through irrigation began
    in 2015 and are made using an assemblage of pressure switches and Onset HOBO data
    loggers (Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, MA). Irrigation events are recorded
    as the time difference between the beginning and end of irrigation, with events
    lasting roughly 5 h on average between sites. The amount of irrigation applied
    in liters per vine is calculated using an average irrigation pump rate and vine/row
    spacing data provided by vineyard managers. Yield maps for 2013 through 2016 harvest
    in both north and south vineyards are provided by E&J Gallo Winery using Advanced
    Technology Viticulture (ATV, Joslin, Australia) yield monitoring systems and a
    cleanup script used to convert mass flow units into tons per hectare, eliminate
    outliers, and normalized across harvesters. Yield data greater than three standard
    deviations from the mean are omitted. Yield maps are interpolated to a 3 m grid
    using Vesper Spatial Prediction Software for Precision Agriculture (Whelan et
    al. 2002). Multi-scale ET modeling system ALEXI The multi-scale ET modeling system
    used here downscales regional coarse-scale fluxes from the ALEXI surface-energy
    balance model (Anderson et al. 1997, 2007a, b; Mecikalski et al. 1999) to finer
    spatial scales. ALEXI exploits the high temporal resolution afforded by geostationary
    satellites to measure the morning rate of land-surface temperature (LST) rise,
    which is used to guide partitioning of the surface-energy budget. Time-differential
    LST measurements provide the added benefit of being less sensitive to errors in
    temperature retrieval due to atmospheric and emissivity correction (Anderson et
    al. 1997). ALEXI is based on the Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) model, first
    developed by Norman et al. (1995), and later refined through improved parameterizations
    in Kustas and Norman (1999). The TSEB model partitions surface temperature into
    soil and vegetation components, which are then used to solve the surface-energy
    budget for the soil, canopy and combined system associated with the mixed scene:
    $$(R{n_s}+R{n_c}) - G=\left( {{H_s}+{H_c}} \right)+(\lambda {E_s}+\lambda {E_c}),$$
    where Rn is net radiation (W/m2), H is the sensible heat flux (W/m2), G is the
    soil heat flux (W/m2) and λE is the latent heat flux (W/m2). Subscripts ‘s’ and
    ‘c’ represent fluxes associated with the soil and canopy scene components, respectively.
    The TSEB uses an estimate of local vegetation cover fraction to partition the
    composite surface temperature measurement into soil and canopy temperatures, which
    are used to constrain net radiation and sensible heat flux, defined by the surface-to-air
    temperature gradient. The G term is parameterized in as a fraction of the net
    radiation at the soil surface (Rns). Canopy transpiration, λEc, is estimated using
    a modified Priestley-Taylor approach (Priestley and Taylor 1972) which responds
    to signals of vegetation stress conveyed by the surface temperature measurement,
    while soil evaporation λEs is computed as the residual to the energy balance equation.
    The TSEB model is applied at two times during the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL)
    growth phase, at approximately 1.5 h after local sunrise (t1) and 1.0 h before
    local noon (t2). A simple slab model of ABL development (McNaughton and Spriggs
    1986) is used to provide a means for surface-energy closure by relating the rise
    in air temperature in the mixed layer over the time interval (t1 to t2) to the
    time-integrated influx of H from the surface (Anderson et al. 1997). This approach
    allows near-surface air temperature to be computed internally, eliminating the
    need for an a priori specification of air temperature boundary conditions to the
    sensible heat flux computation. Daily latent heat flux is derived using ALEXI-retrieved
    latent heat flux estimates at t2 and upscaled to 24 h using the ratio of instantaneous
    to daily insolation: $$\lambda {E_{{\text{day}}}}=\frac{{\lambda {E_{{t_2}}}}}{{{R_{{S_{t2}}}}}}\left(
    {{R_{s24}}} \right),$$ where \(\lambda {E_{{t_2}}}\) is the latent heat at t2,
    \({R_{{S_{t2}}}}\)is the insolation rate at t2, and \({R_{{s_{24}}}}\) is the
    time-integrated daily insolation rate. This insolation technique has proven generally
    reliable, with lower bias and sensitivity to errors in retrieval estimates when
    compared to other techniques (Cammalleri et al. 2014a). Daily net radiation (\({R_{{n_{24}}}}\))
    maps are derived using an approach described in Anderson et al. (2012), daily
    \(G\) maps are computed by integrating the Santanello equation over daylight hours
    (Santanello and Friedl 2003), and daily \(~H\) values are computed as the residual.
    All fluxes are expressed in MJ m−2 day−1 to retain consistency with prior publications.
    The daily latent heat is converted to daily ET (in units of mm day−1) by dividing
    by the latent heat of vaporization λ. Missing pixels within the ALEXI ET maps,
    due either to cloud cover or missing or low-quality input data, are gap filled
    by conserving the ratio of actual ET to daily insolation (fsun) over time at each
    pixel. The time series of clear-sky fsun is filtered, smoothed and gap-filled
    for each pixel using a Savitzky–Golay filter, designed to reduce noise while preserving
    signals associated with changes in surface moisture conditions. Missing pixels
    within the daily ET map are then recovered by multiplying the gap-filled fsun
    fields by the daily scaling flux (insolation) maps. ALEXI is run operationally
    by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) at 8 km spatial resolution
    over North America as part of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite
    (GOES) Evapotranspiration and Drought (GET-D) system. GET-D produces daily ET
    and an ET-based Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) using radiometric temperature data
    retrieved from GOES East and West thermal imagery. The ESI describes standardized
    anomalies in the actual-to-reference ET ratio (fRET), using the Penman–Monteith
    (FAO-56) reference ET for grass (1998). The ESI is an indicator of agricultural
    drought reflecting impacts on crop water use, and has been shown to provide early
    warning of deteriorating crop conditions (Anderson et al. 2011, 2013; Otkin et
    al. 2013, 2014). A 4 km resolution grid is also maintained for research purposes
    and allows assessment of ESI and ET at the regional scale over the continental
    U.S. (CONUS). DisALEXI Due to its reliance on high temporal frequency TIR imagery,
    here obtained from geostationary satellites, ALEXI is constrained to operate on
    coarser spatial scales on the order of a few kilometers. To map flux distributions
    at higher spatial resolution, an associated spatial disaggregation technique known
    as DisALEXI (Norman et al. 2003; Anderson et al. 2004, 2012) can be implemented
    using higher resolution TIR imagery from polar orbiting instruments or from airborne
    platforms. DisALEXI operates by running the TSEB model over each ALEXI pixel area
    within a given modeling domain using the higher spatial resolution vegetation
    cover and surface radiometric temperature information. For this application of
    TSEB, the air temperature boundary condition (set at a nominal blending height
    of 50 m), is iteratively adjusted at the ALEXI pixel scale until the DisALEXI
    daily ET fluxes converge to the ALEXI value on average over that pixel. This ensures
    consistency between the ALEXI and DisALEXI flux fields. Further description can
    be found in Anderson et al. (2012), and Cammalleri et al. (2013, 2014a). ET data
    fusion In this study, DisALEXI was used to generate ET map time series at moderate
    resolution (1 km) and near daily time steps using thermal and reflectance data
    from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Higher resolution
    (30 m) maps were created with periodic Landsat datasets, with thermal band data
    sharpened to the 30-m resolution of the reflectance bands using the Data Mining
    Sharpener tool developed by Gao et al. (2012a). These two time series were then
    fused using the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM;
    Gao et al. 2006) to create daily maps of ET at 30-m resolution. In short, STARFM
    predicts Landsat-resolution ET maps on MODIS acquisition dates by developing spatially
    distributed weighting factors representing the spectral similarity and temporal
    difference between observed Landsat/MODIS maps collected on the same day. These
    weighting factors are then used in the disaggregation of MODIS images on days
    when Landsat is not available, resulting in daily Landsat-scale ET maps. For more
    information, the reader is referred to Gao et al. (2006), Cammalleri et al. (2013,
    2014a) and Semmens et al. (2016). Model inputs LST inputs for the 4-km ALEXI simulations
    over CONUS were obtained 11 µm brightness temperature observations from the GOES-EAST
    (at 75°W) and GOES-WEST (at 105°W) Imager instruments. Raw brightness temperature
    values are atmospherically corrected using atmospheric profiles of temperature,
    as described in French et al. (2003). Vegetation cover fraction, used to partition
    LST between soil and canopy temperatures, is computed from MODIS leaf area index
    (LAI) product (see below), aggregated to 4 km and interpolated to daily time steps.
    Landsat 8 (L8) data between April 16, 2013 and October 19, 2016 were collected
    over the study area, which is in the overlap of two scenes (path 44/row 33 and
    path 43/row 33). A total of 87 mostly clear scenes were processed. Landsat thermal
    band data at native resolution (100 m) were atmospherically corrected using MODTRAN
    (Berk et al. 1989) then sharpened to 30 m resolution to match Landsat optical
    bands using the data mining sharpener (DMS) approach (Gao et al. 2012a). Atmospherically
    corrected shortwave reflectance data were directly downloaded from the U.S. Geological
    Survey (USGS) Earth Explorer website (http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov). These reflectance
    products were used to derive 30-m maps of LAI using regression tree analysis trained
    by MODIS 1 km LAI data, as described in Gao et al. (2012b). MODIS daily LAI maps
    were generated from the 4-day composite (MCD15A3, Collection 5) products and a
    procedure outlined in Gao et al. (2008), where the 4-day products are smoothed
    and gap filled to daily time steps using the TIMESAT algorithm for analyzing satellite
    time-series data for seasonality and other temporally dynamic vegetation properties
    (Jönsson and Eklundh 2004). Input MODIS albedo maps were generated from the Solar
    Zenith Angle (SZN)-extended MODIS/Terra + Aqua 30 arc sec Global Gap-Filled Snow-Free
    Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) (MODIS BRDF/Albedo CMG
    Gap-Filled Snow-Free Product MCD43GF V005) parameters product (University of Massachusetts
    Boston, Dr. Crystal Schaaf). MODIS LST maps were generated using the Terra instantaneous
    swath product (MOD11_L2) and geolocation product (MOD03) to obtain correct georegistration.
    LST maps were sharpened using DMS (MODIS 1 km composite NDVI as input) to reduce
    the bowtie effect due to off-nadir pixel smearing (Cammalleri et al. 2014b; Semmens
    et al. 2016). Meteorological inputs to ALEXI/DisALEXI include hourly solar radiation,
    air temperature, wind speed and vapor pressure. These data were obtained from
    the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast System
    Reanalysis (CFSR) data set (Dee et al. 2013). All fields were mapped to the 4
    km ALEXI grid and converted to each sensor’s projection at both daily and overpass
    times for ingestion into DisALEXI. ALEXI/DisALEXI also requires landcover class
    to specify surface roughness parameters and vegetation optical properties (Anderson
    et al. 2007a). The ALEXI model uses the University of Maryland (UMD) global land
    cover dataset at 1 km resolution, based on observations from the AVHRR (Hansen
    et al. 2000). Higher resolution MODIS and Landsat disaggregation requires the
    30 m National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) (Fry et al. 2011). For MODIS, the NLCD
    map was upscaled to 1 km resolution using the majority class within each MODIS
    pixel. Prior evaluation of ALEXI/DisALEXI over California vineyards indicate a
    small wet bias in modeled fluxes during the cold season (Semmens et al. 2016).
    The current study incorporates a generalized second order empirical correction
    factor based on the day of year (DOY) to adjust this bias (Anderson et al. 2018).
    Minimal correction is applied during the mid-season, with the largest corrections
    being applied during the beginning and ending of the year, causing minimal impact
    to seasonal total estimates. For more information, the reader is referred to Anderson
    et al. (2018). Results Model evaluation on Landsat dates The accuracy of the fused
    daily 30-m ET time series depends largely on the fidelity in energy balance partitioning
    achieved on dates of clear Landsat overpasses, while the MODIS ET data effectively
    serve to inform interpolation between Landsat dates (Fig. 1). To evaluate performance
    on these key tie-points, modeled daytime flux estimates derived using DisALEXI
    on Landsat overpass dates are compared to EC observations in Fig. 2, with statistical
    metrics of agreement, as provided in Table 1. The modeled flux estimates have
    been averaged over a 3-by-3 pixel area (90 × 90 m) shifted west from the tower
    center to avoid non-characteristic pixels over the adjacent road. Model estimates
    of latent heat flux (LE) have been compared to measured fluxes both as observed
    and closed using the RE method, as described in the “Field measurements” section.
    This enables an evaluation of closure impacts on the assessment of model performance.

    Landsat dates and daily estimates from the fused time series (Fusion) at sites
    1, 2 and combination of sites 1 and 2 at 24-h, daily (fusion) and weekly time
    steps Full size table Simulated daytime fluxes derived from DisALEXI generally
    align along the one-to-one line (Fig. 2), indicating reasonable partitioning by
    the TSEB. Insolation and net radiation, defining energy available for partitioning,
    agree well with in-situ measurements. A few days with higher discrepancies reflect
    errors in the CFSR insolation inputs, related to misrepresentation of clouds in
    the reanalysis data. Future implementation over North America will test use of
    NOAA’s GOES Surface and Insolation Products (GSIP; Laszlo et al. 2008) as a near
    real time input data source. Preliminary investigation shows that these hourly,
    20-km satellite-derived estimates developed by Diak (2017) better capture local
    variability in solar irradiance over the northern vineyard (Anderson et al. 2018),
    although some regional calibration may be required. Model performance for the
    2013–2016 period is similar to that reported by Semmens et al. (2016), where MAE
    errors in daily LE of ~ 1.2 MJ m−2 day−1 were obtained for Landsat overpass dates
    during the 2013 growing season. The increase in MAE seen here is likely associated
    with evaluating over multiple years with varying climatic conditions and vineyard
    management decisions, and the extension of analysis to year-round in the current
    study (Semmens et al. 2016 was limited to the growing season only). Modeled LE
    indicates underestimation when compared to closed observed LE estimates at site
    1, yielding a negative MBE of − 0.46 MJ m−2 day−1 (Table 1). The negative bias
    is most prevalent at the highest values associated with peak growing season, and
    is not present at site 2 or in comparison with the unclosed LE measurements. Evaluation
    of daily ET from fused time series Scatter plots and associated time series of
    modeled 24-h ET from the fused daily time series and daily fluxes observed at
    tower sites 1 and 2 between April 16, 2013 and October 19, 2016 are shown in Figs.
    3 and 4, respectively. Daily ET estimates from the fused remote-sensing product
    follow the same general trend as the direct retrievals on Landsat overpass dates
    (Fig. 3). MAE for the full daily time series (closed) are 0.6 mm day−1 for both
    sites, comparable to the 0.7 mm day−1 errors reported by Semmens et al. (2016)
    for the 2013 growing season in isolation. Relative errors for both sites combined
    are 17% and 12% at daily and weekly time steps—the latter being more relevant
    for weekly irrigation scheduling. Fig. 3 Scatterplots of modeled vs. observed
    closed (left panels) and unclosed (right panels) 24-h ET over the full simulation
    period from the fused time series for sites 1 (top panels) and 2 (bottom panels)

    dates (red squares) and 24-h daily ET retrievals from the fused time series (red
    line) for site 1 (top panel) and site 2 (bottom panel). Daily precipitation measured
    at each site is indicated by the black vertical bars Full size image On both Landsat
    overpass dates (Fig. 2) and in the full daily time series from the data fusion
    methodology (Fig. 3), the modeled LE and ET underestimates the closed observed
    fluxes at site 1 at the very highest values. As seen in Fig. 4, these periods
    of underestimation occur between approximately mid-June and mid-August for each
    year and most notably for years 2013 and 2016. In both cases, the closure corrections
    using the residual method are relatively large, and the modeled ET is typically
    bracketed between closed and unclosed observed values. Such discrepancies are
    not observed at site 2. These large mid-season closure corrections and enhanced
    model-measurement discrepancies are likely related to advective conditions. In
    semiarid or arid regions, horizontal advection of hot, dry air, heated by the
    surrounding landscape, can significantly increase the localized evaporative demand
    over an irrigated field, driving large latent heat fluxes. In such cases, the
    additional energy required for evaporation is extracted from the surface itself,
    resulting in negative sensible heat and an increase in closure errors (Alfieri
    et al. 2012). A cursory analysis of the observed sensible heat fluxes at sites
    1 and 2 revealed signatures of advection during the periods of lower closure,
    suggesting the RE method may be overestimating the real evaporative flux during
    those intervals. Furthermore, the tower footprint may be impacted under advective
    conditions, effectively sampling surface conditions further upwind. Anderson et
    al. (2018) found that peak observed flux estimates are better correlated with
    model fluxes extracted over a more central region of the vineyard that has more
    vigorous vine growth and yield production. Moreover, the assumption of self-preservation
    to upscale instantaneous flux retrieved at the satellite overpass time to daily
    totals depreciates under advective conditions (Crago 1996; Tang et al. 2013).
    Ongoing work is addressing both modeling and observational issues under the specific
    condition of strong mid-season advection. Within-field variability in water use
    Routine remote sensing of daily ET at 30-m resolution will facilitate identification
    of areas of uneven ET/stress within vineyards due to variations in soil texture
    and composition and other environmental or anthropogenic factors. Figure 5 shows
    the variability in daily ET across both the northern and southern vineyards (sites
    1 and 2) during the entire period of investigation. Spatial variability in ET
    increases during the growing season, with maximum variation occurring in July,
    then decreasing to a near-homogeneous distribution during the winter season. The
    northern vineyard exhibits a higher degree of spatial variability in ET, both
    in standard deviation and range, when compared to the southern vineyard. In the
    northern vineyard, the ET observed at the flux tower persistently lies near the
    upper bounds in standard deviation and range during the growing season. In general,
    at site 2, the flux tower samples are near the spatial mean of the remotely sensed
    distribution (Fig. 5). Overall, modeled spatial mean estimates of ET over the
    northern and southern vineyard are similar, with the only discrepancy found during
    the late growing season of 2013 and 2015, where values over the southern vineyard
    are slightly lower than in the northern vineyard (Fig. 5, bottom panel). Fig.
    5 Time series of observed ET (black dots), spatial mean modeled ET with plus and
    minus standard deviation (dark red) and spatial range (maximum and minimum) modeled
    ET (light red) for the northern vineyard (top panel) and southern vineyard (middle
    panel). Also included is the time series of modeled spatial mean ET for both vineyards
    (bottom panel) Full size image The analyses in Fig. 5 highlight the challenges
    in using isolated in-situ measurements to infer field-scale states and fluxes.
    As noted by Semmens et al. (2016), the northern field has large variability in
    soil texture, with the northwestern corner of the northern vineyard containing
    a silt/gravelly loam, resulting in poor to moderate water storage capacities and
    subsequently lower ET rates than observed in other parts of both fields, dominated
    by a Kimball silt loam. As a result, the tower footprint in site 1 captures conditions
    that are not always representative of the field as a whole. This is consistent
    with analyses presented by Anderson et al. (2018), who investigated spatial variability
    in correlations between the observed fluxes and modeled ET time series extracted
    in a moving window sampling a 600 × 600 m area around the Lodi tower sites, as
    a metric of tower representivity. They found that on average over two full annual
    cycles, tower fluxes at site 1 were best correlated with modeled ET to the southwest
    of the tower location, shifting to the vineyard center when the analysis was limited
    to the peak of the growing seasons. The southern vineyard showed less spatial
    variability in terms of tower-model agreement. Local variability in water use
    Along with field ET estimates, spatial maps of ET over the local landscape can
    provide valuable context for irrigation decision makers. Vineyard managers often
    operate multiple vineyards, potentially with different varietals and irrigation
    management strategies. There may also be value in understanding irrigation and
    water-use patterns in neighboring fields. As an example, maps of monthly ET over
    a roughly 3 km by 3 km box including the GRAPEX study area, with the northern
    and southern vineyards near the center, are presented in Fig. 6. Over this 4-year
    period, some consistent seasonal patterns in water use are apparent. Beginning
    in March, localized ET enhancements in irrigated fields begin to emerge. Irrigation
    in the GRAPEX vineyards begins in early June and ends in early- to mid-October.
    Remnant evaporation of late season irrigation can be seen in these vineyards in
    October for each year. Fig. 6 Spatial time series (monthly) of ET (mm month−1)
    over a 3 × 3 km area including the northern and southern vineyards instrumented
    for GRAPEX. Boxes demarcate the new vineyard established west of the northern
    vineyard and an alfalfa field left fallow following the 2015 growing season Full
    size image Although seasonal patterns remain relatively consistent from year to
    year, some discernable changes in local water use can be seen over the 4-year
    period, particularly during the growing season. These changes are largely related
    to changes in land use. For example, evidence of irrigation in a new vineyard
    established just west of site one in early 2014 is manifested as a substantial
    increase between 2013 and 2014 and persisting through the 2015–2016 growing seasons
    (outlined in black; Fig. 6). In addition, ET in the field due south of the southern
    vineyard (also outlined in Fig. 6) decreases notably in 2016 due to fallowing
    of an alfalfa field after May of that year, possibly the result of grower response
    to long-term drought conditions and resulting water limitations (Anderson et al.
    2018). Spatial weekly or monthly maps of local ET at this scale provide vineyard
    managers with information about local land- and water-use changes, which may have
    bearing on in-field decision making and long-term strategic planning. Use of remote
    sensing for monitoring vineyard water stress and managing irrigation This study
    investigates two remote-sensing metrics that may be useful in vineyard irrigation
    management are total daily or weekly ET (relating to consumptive water use—water
    extracted from the soil profile requiring replacement), and the moisture stress
    factor fRET. Grape development is strongly dependent on vine water status, and
    strategies for optimizing wine grape quality are often associated with imposing
    some degree of water stress in the vine during specific phenological periods.
    This degree of stress is achieved through regulated deficit irrigation (RDI),
    estimated as a fraction of the full crop potential water use. Current operational
    practices utilize the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO-56) model to estimate
    crop potential water use based on the reference ET and a crop coefficient (commonly
    referred to as Kc) describing the average ratio of actual-to-reference ET for
    different crops under well-watered conditions. The fRET quantity used in the regional-scale
    ESI agricultural drought indicator effectively represents a dynamic crop coefficient,
    diagnostically retrieved via thermal remote sensing and responding to daily changes
    in localized crop stress and development. To illustrate the utility of a daily
    Landsat-scale fRET product for stress detection, Fig. 7 compares modeled values
    to observations derived from tower measurements of actual and reference ET. Reference
    ET is calculated in both cases using the Penman–Monteith formulation, as described
    in the FAO standard for a short grass (Allen et al. 1998), computed using tower
    data in the observed case and using regional meteorological data (NCEP CFSR data
    set; Dee et al. 2013) for the modeled case. Observed Actual ET is taken as the
    observed 24-h daily closed flux tower measurement, while the modeled ET values
    are extracted from the fused time series at the tower sites. Also shown are rainfall
    and irrigation amounts measured in-field, the latter only available for the 2015
    and 2016 growing seasons (see zoom-in in Fig. 7; bottom panel). Fig. 7 Time series
    of fRET derived from closed observations (black dots) and the fused ET time series
    (red line) derived from point estimates for site 1 (top panel) and site 2 (second
    from top panel) during the entire study period, along with daily rainfall (green
    bars). Also included is an enhanced view of 2015 and 2016 (bottom two panels),
    which includes daily irrigation totals (blue bars) presented in Liters/vine Full
    size image In general, the fused fRET time series reproduces observed seasonal
    patterns inferred from the tower observations with good fidelity. Small mid-season
    biases are observed in 2013 and 2015 at site 1, relating to localized advective
    issues discussed earlier. This bias is non-existent at site 2, where both modeled
    and observed fRET estimates are similar throughout the study period. Both modeled
    and measured fRET indicate lower peak season fRET values at site 2 during 2013
    and 2015 when compared to 2014 and 2015, consistent with the cyclical annual ET
    patterns in Fig. 4. During 2015–2016, when detailed irrigation information is
    available (Fig. 7; bottom panels), we can closely investigate relationships between
    fRET and daily irrigation amounts, expressed in in units of liters per vine. Observed
    and modeled fRET fluctuate rapidly during the non-growing season when canopy cover
    is sparse and no irrigation is occurring, reflecting the relative volatility in
    the soil evaporation and cover crop transpiration contributions that dominate
    total ET during this period. Once irrigation commences, fRET remains more stable
    and near target levels (0.8–1.0) until after harvest. Note that irrigation is
    suspended each year briefly (5–7 days) around harvest near the end of August,
    then resumed post-harvest until early-to-mid-October to maintain the canopy. After
    harvest, both observed and modeled fRET decay as the vines senesce. During the
    growing season, remotely sensed fRET values in both vineyards show response to
    seasonal irrigation amounts. In 2015, site 2 received about 60% of the daily irrigation
    amounts applied to site 1, while in 2016 the irrigation strategy was more uniform,
    with site 2 at 92% of site 1 (Fig. 8). Irrigation at site 1 varied by only 1%
    between the two years, while site 2 increased by 54% in 2016. These variations
    in irrigation management are reflected in the average remote sensing fRET retrieved
    during the irrigation season (pre-harvest), around 0.7 for site 2 in 2013 and
    0.8 in all other cases. Fig. 8 Total irrigation applied (liters/vine) over 2015
    and 2016 growing seasons in the site 1 and 2 vineyards Full size image Regional
    differences in applied irrigation can be seen in the spatiotemporal patterns of
    monthly average 30-m fused fRET (Fig. 9). After irrigation is initiated (beginning
    of June), there is a clear distinction in fRET between the vineyards in 2013 and
    2015, but less difference in 2014/2016, reflecting differentials in irrigation
    amounts applied to the two fields (Fig. 8). While the relative patterns in monthly
    fRET are similar to those in total ET shown in Fig. 6, normalization by reference
    ET serves to reduce dependence on the seasonal evaporative demand curve, focusing
    more specifically on variations in moisture conditions driving the evaporative
    fluxes. These maps also provide information on irrigation initiation in surrounding
    fields. The fRET maps for April in Fig. 9 emphasize wetter springtime conditions
    in 2014, as well as early initiation of irrigation in the fields to the southwest
    in 2014 and 2016. Fig. 9 Spatiotemporal time series (monthly) of fRET (top panel)
    and fRET anomaly (bottom panel) over a 3 × 3 km area including the northern and
    southern vineyards instrumented for GRAPEX Full size image Anomalies in monthly
    fRET, computed as the difference with respect to the long-term (here 4-year) mean
    fRET map for each month are useful for highlighting regions anomalous moisture
    stress and water use in real time (Fig. 9; bottom panel). In April, May and June
    of 2015 we see pronounced negative anomalies in the southern vineyard, which are
    also present, albeit to a smaller degree, during the remainder of the growing
    season. These anomalies indicate stress in the vineyard likely correlated to the
    lesser amount of irrigation applied during the 2015 growing season and subsequent
    reduced yield as discussed earlier. Regional precipitation in October of 2015
    may have helped to reduce the fRET anomaly signal from September to October. In
    some cases, reflect changes in land use and water management rather than stress.
    In 2013 we see strong negative anomalies in the areas where new vineyards were
    established in 2014, to the west and south of site 1. The alfalfa field fallowed
    in May of 2016 is clearly apparent. Drier than normal conditions are detected
    for the month of September in 2015 over the region just east of the GRAPEX vineyard
    sites. This may be related to management/harvest decisions in response to the
    multi-year drought conditions that prevailed in California during the study period,
    leading to increasing pressure on water availability for irrigation. Spatial fRET
    and fRET anomaly products such as these prove capable of monitoring dynamic crop
    coefficients and highlighting changing conditions, not only within a field of
    interest, but also on a regional scale. Relationships between vineyard water use,
    stress and yields The ultimate objective in this study is to motivate use of remote
    sensing toward meeting the dual goals of reducing water use while improving yield
    and grape quality. Figure 10 provides a more detailed view of annual water-use
    patterns and its relation to grape yield over the two GRAPEX vineyards, showing
    cumulative ET over the peak growing season (May–August) in the top panel and grape
    yield (tons ha−1) in the bottom panel. Fig. 10 Cumulative peak growing season
    (May–August) ET (mm) (top) and total yield in tons/ha (bottom) over the northern
    and southern vineyards for years 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 Full size image The
    cumulative ET maps show distinct spatial structure. Two low ET features in the
    south-central portion of the northern vineyard are associated with vernal pools
    - small areas having no vines and no irrigation because of protection by state
    and federal law from any cultivation activities (see also Semmens et al. 2016).
    These ephemeral wetlands emerge after rainfall events, but during most of the
    growing season are dry leading to persistently low values of seasonal ET. There
    is also the persistence in lower ET in the northwest corner of the northern (site
    1) vineyard, which is associated with poor vine growth due to soil properties.
    This corner of the field has silt loam and gravelly loam soils characteristic
    of poor to moderate water storage capacity (Semmens et al. 2016), while the center
    of the northern vineyard is Kimball silt loam and is characteristic of more vigorous
    vine growth. The latter is characterized by high rates of seasonal consumptive
    water use. The increased water use associated with the new vineyards established
    to the west and south of the north vineyard after the 2013 growing season can
    also be observed in Fig. 10. Total ET during the peak growing season increases
    from roughly 300 mm year−1 during 2013 to 520–550 mm year−1 during 2014 over this
    region due to irrigation applied to help establish the recently planted vines.
    Much of this spatial structure in seasonal ET is well correlated in patterns in
    yield maps, collected over the GRAPEX fields using GPS-enabled sensors on the
    harvesters. The cyclical ET dynamics in the southern vineyard (site 2), with relatively
    high cumulative water use in 2014 and 2016, reflects grower decisions in irrigation
    management in this field. In the northern vineyard (site 1), the cumulative water
    use is lower in 2013 than in 2014–2016. Similar spatial and temporal patterns
    are seen in the reported total yield for each site (Fig. 10). Specifically, total
    yield for 2015 in the southern vineyard is considerably lower than in the northern
    vineyard, while also being lower than both the north and south vineyards in 2016,
    corresponding to trends in both fRET and irrigation. This instance of decreased
    yield may be the result of increased stress imposed over the southern vineyard
    (shown in fRET) through restricted irrigation during the 2015 growing season (Fig.
    8). Despite the lack of irrigation data during the 2013 and 2014 growing seasons,
    trends in fRET correspond to yield totals—most notably in the southern vineyard—where
    fRET values are lowest during the 2013 and 2015 growing season (Fig. 7). In the
    northern vineyard, yields are lowest in 2013—the year of lowest cumulative water
    use. The spatial distribution of cumulative growing season ET (Fig. 10) also roughly
    follows that of yield, with larger values of both reported near the center of
    the northern vineyard for all years. As noted above, spatial heterogeneity in
    the northern vineyard is associated with soil texture discontinuities and vine
    growth vigor. Low yields in the NW corner are spatially correlated with lower
    seasonal ET, while the center of the northern vineyard has persistently the highest
    yields and seasonal water use. A similar spatial correlation to yield is presented
    in Sun et al. (2017), where the biophysical parameters NDVI and LAI show a similar
    spatial correlation to grape yield over the same vineyards during 2013 and 2014,
    although the relationship is more variable from year to year. Ongoing work looks
    to expand upon research done in Sun et al. (2017) by examining the joint use of
    remotely sensed LAI/ET/fRET signals to predict yield variations over a larger
    dataset of vineyards and over an extended period. Summary and conclusions A remote-sensing
    approach for mapping daily ET at 30-m spatial resolution is evaluated over two
    vineyard sites in central California for the 2013–2016 growing seasons to investigate
    the utility for irrigation management. Mean absolute errors in comparison with
    in-situ eddy covariance measurements of daily ET were 0.6 mm day−1, or about 17%
    of the mean observed value. Errors reduced to 15% at the weekly time steps relevant
    to irrigation management. In comparison with eddy covariance fluxes forced for
    closure, the model tended to underestimate closed observations in the northern
    vineyard site during highly advective periods for the peak growing season in 2013
    and 2016. During this period, the closure errors in the observations were exacerbated,
    and therefore, the tendency to underestimate is partly attributed to issues with
    the flux measurements and closure technique and not the model alone. Model errors
    may be associated with the self-preservation assumptions in the daily upscaling
    technique, which may be less reliable under advective conditions. Monthly total
    ET maps and the spatial variation time series demonstrate strong seasonal water-use
    variability, both within the vineyards themselves and over the surrounding landscape.
    In the northern vineyard, the flux tower location was not representative of the
    field-scale mean properties in some years, highlighting challenges in managing
    irrigation decisions based on point-scale measurements. Time series of monthly
    ET maps revealed consistent seasonal dynamics year-to-year in water-use patterns
    over the GRAPEX study area, but with some notable variations due to changes in
    land use and water management. Within vineyard spatial variability of cumulative
    growing season ET and actual-to-reference ET (fRET) correlate well with yield
    totals, demonstrating the impact of potential stress on future yield prospects.
    Maps of fRET demonstrate utility for monitoring how consistently target values
    (between 0.8 and 1.0 in this case) are achieved for a given field, and could be
    useful for adaptive management of irrigation applications in real time. Maps of
    fRET anomalies highlight emerging areas of anomalous water use or stress that
    could alert needs for modified management or further investigation. The modeling
    approach described here can provide detailed and robust information on daily to
    seasonal crop water use and stress. Applied operationally, this ET mapping framework
    can be of great utility to irrigation managers, both for individual vineyard assessment
    and larger regional application. Improved spatial and temporal monitoring will
    improve water allocation and conservation efforts through an ability to identify
    areas of uneven productivity/stress due to variations in soil texture and composition
    and other environmental or anthropogenic factors. This will allow vineyard managers
    to identify areas in their blocks with water, nutrient or other environmental
    stressors as well as malfunctions in the irrigation systems. Moreover, with reliable
    daily 30-m ET, growers and irrigation managers have the potential to make use
    of variable rate irrigation systems that can apply appropriate amounts of irrigated
    water and nutrients to specific areas within a vineyard to achieve more uniform
    grape quality and yield goals. There is also potential to incorporate very fine
    resolution aerial imagery from UAVs or manned aircraft for identifying individual
    or groups of vines requiring intervention at critical periods during vine and
    grape development stages when stress conditions are detected at the coarser 30
    m satellite resolution. In ongoing work, this fusion-based ET mapping system is
    being applied over different vine varieties and climate regions within California
    as part of the continued effort of the GRAPEX project (Kustas et al. 2018). The
    ability to reliably monitor evaporative water loss and crop conditions at both
    the field and regional scale is imperative to viticulture and agricultural production
    systems alike, especially in regions with competing demands for limited water
    resources. Notes The use of trade, firm, or corporation names in this article

  limitations: The study has no major limitations, as it provides a comprehensive
    evaluation of the accuracy and utility of the satellite-based ET mapping and fRET
    for irrigation management in vineyards. However, it is important to note that
    the study was conducted in a specific region (Central Valley of California) and
    may not be directly applicable to other regions with different climate and soil
    conditions. Further studies are needed to evaluate the transferability of the
    approach to other regions and to explore the potential for integrating ET and
    fRET mapping with other data sources (e.g., soil moisture sensors, weather data)
    to improve the accuracy and robustness of irrigation management decisions.

    The motivation for this review paper came from the developing countries where
    the economy is mostly dependent on agriculture and climate conditions. Based on
    current conditions and historical records, profitability in production farming
    depends on making a right and timely operational decision. Precision farming is
    a systematic program designed to maximize the productivity of agriculture by carefully
    tailoring the soil and crop management to meet the specific requirements in each
    field while preserving environmental quality. This review paper highlights the
    development of an automated irrigation system with portable wireless sensor networks
    and decision support methods to remotely measure the environmental parameters
    in an agriculture field. Radio satellite, mobile phones, sensors, internet-based
    communication, and microcontroller capture the ecological parameters such as soil
    moisture, temperature, humidity, and light intensity. The knowledge gained from
    the sensors is transferred directly to the cloud server by using IoT technology.
    Users from anywhere in the world can display them through an internet-enabled
    device. Development of sensor-based application in modern agriculture makes it
    cost-effective and potentially productive and increases the efficiency through
    precision agriculture farming. Different limitations have been reported in the
    previously reviewed publications like the shortage of power in the field that
    can be solved by using a solar panel that recharges the battery at the same time
    using electricity. Bluetooth application in the agriculture sector is mainly improved
    by design system optimization. Problems related to transmission and radio range
    frequency can be solved by using a power class upgraded antenna. 1. Introduction
    Human civilization around the globe is preparing for a population explosion to
    hit a total of 10 billion inhabitants by 2050 (United Nations, 2017). It has been
    estimated that global food production must increase by least 70% over the coming
    years to keep pace with this growth [ 1– 3]. Over the years, agricultural methods
    have not improved much, and farmers still use conventional strategies based on
    expectations of the crop’s nutritional needs. Delivering the same nutrient input
    across the entire farm is no longer the best choice, as this leads to heavy fertilizer
    and pesticide usage, unnecessary water consumption, environmental degradation,
    and high operating costs [ 4, 5]. Extensive irrigation consumes approximately
    70% of global water [ 6]. The industrial and domestic sectors account for 13%
    and 20%, respectively, although this variation in percentage is considerable variation
    across countries. According to the Act 1947, it defines agriculture, including
    livestock’s breeding, dairy farming, horticulture, seed growing, and fruit growing
    [ 7]. Agriculture aims to utilize maximum land and increase the profit. The agricultural
    sector needs to adopt smarter methods of farming. Innovative techniques in agriculture,
    such as precision farming techniques, help with these concerns. Precision farming
    is a farm management method that uses information technology to efficiently distribute
    resources and ensure that the crops and soil receive the exact nutrients needed
    at the perfect time for enhanced health and productivity [ 8]. In recent years,
    the researchers have tried to develop automated control irrigation systems for
    irrigation management by using cloud computing and IoT technology; IoT can be
    characterized as a network of independent objects that link and share data remotely
    over the Internet [ 9, 10]. The gap between supply and demand is rising and sets
    new challenges adding pressure on the agriculture supply chain [ 11]. Traditionally
    available techniques for irrigation are drip irrigation, ditch irrigation, sprinkler
    systems, and terraced systems. The standard irrigation practices are classified
    by demand increase for productivity, shortage of water, and poor performance for
    agriculture practice. These problems are solved by using automated irrigation
    systems. 1.1. Need for Automatic Irrigation (i) Saving energy and resources for
    utilizing in a precise way. (ii) Easily installation of the system on the field.
    (iii) To apply the right amount of water at the right time for the sake of farmer’s
    easiness to control farm irrigation and nursery. (iv) Valves are used in automated
    irrigation systems to turn on/off the motor. (v) Pump or motor can be easily operated
    with a sensor-based controller and no need for any labor to manage or monitor
    irrigation systems. Crop efficiency includes improvement in the reduction of the
    overwatering from the saturated soil and avoiding the wrong time of irrigation
    to save more water. A significant part of freshwater is consumed in the agricultural
    sector due to the unavailability of cost-effective irrigation systems [ 12– 14].
    Fortunately, previous implementations of agricultural monitoring systems for irrigation
    practices were riddled with problems that prevented the progress of this sector.
    Previously, farm surveillance systems comprised of a wired data collection system
    in which a data transmission linked the sensor units with monitoring stations
    [ 13, 15, 16]. Rainfall and evapotranspiration is an important factor which influences
    the moisture of the soil in climatology and geography soil wetness measured by
    the proportion of monthly (or annual) evaporation and precipitation. Soil moisture
    daily can also be calculated by the ratio of daily evaporation and precipitation
    in the above perspective from the routine weather reports precipitation is directly
    accessible, and evaporation is derived from other metrological essentials [ 17].
    Heterogeneous systems are used to gather information at a higher level; smart
    algorithms can be organized for evaluating scientific knowledge to provide an
    enhanced understanding of the ongoing processes [ 18, 19]. For sensors-based irrigation,
    different terminologies are used, i.e., Precision Farming, Variable Rate Technology
    (VRT), Smart Agriculture, Global Positioning Service (GPS), and Site-Specific
    Crop Management. [ 20]. Nowadays, sensors can be used in the domain of human life
    due to its modern technology and small size. Due to the consequence of this technology,
    numerous problems associated with sensor networking are in research. Low memory,
    energy constraint, and data security are some of the significant issues of sensor
    networks in which different researchers in the world are trying to solve these
    issues [ 21, 22]. This review is proposed to support aggressive water management
    for agricultural land. It aims to explain the different modern and sensor-based
    irrigation management techniques and track environmental parameters in the field
    of agriculture and provide warnings and information on current conditions to field
    managers while saving data for future reference in a database, which includes
    information collecting using remote sensor collection, wireless sensor network,
    target controlling, and data management scheme as shown in Figure 1. This review
    paper is based on sensor-based irrigation systems and modern technologies in the
    previous works; this study will be helpful to new researchers in this field to
    get more knowledge and provide more up to date and fill the gap through this review
    study.    Figure 1  Wireless sensor network layout for the automated irrigation
    system. 2. Related Work An automatic sprinkler is a new irrigation technique of
    modern agriculture, but until now, it is not entirely accepted among the farmers.
    Mostly, it is practiced by the researchers for performing the experimental studies.
    Wireless sensor network (WSN) is conceived as a new concept in agricultural applies,
    which encouraged many scholars to accomplish research in this zone. Recent developments
    in wireless sensor network (WSN) technologies have enabled wired sensor systems
    to solve specific problems [ 23– 26]. Recent developments in wireless sensor network
    (WSN) technologies have enabled wired sensor systems to solve particular problems
    [ 27– 29]. This segment is mainly focusing on how different researchers used WSN
    systems to support agricultural practices and irrigation. Abbas et al. have developed
    a smart sensor-based system for parks and gardens that make use of different modern
    sensors. In this system, the latest soil moisture sensors are used to sense the
    field moisture as well as different soil characteristics such as water holding
    capacity [ 30]. The main aim of this system is to calculate the time that is taken
    by the sensors to get activated and distinguished the irrigation zone. ZigBee
    is used to make a connection between sensor nodes and wireless-based stations.
    This system has four significant portions, i.e., control unit, water controller,
    security systems, and mobile messaging unit [ 31]. The primary function of the
    water controller is to identify the level of water in the field and to represent
    the microcontroller. Output functions of water sensors are to switch the microcontrollers
    and automatically turn on or turn off the pump mechanism. If the farm is submerged,
    then the controller is automatically turned on the pump that takes out additional
    water from the field. Security systems and password protection were used to control
    unit and pumps from unauthorized access. Water is being applied through proper
    network systems that involve pipes, pumps, valves, and sprinklers. Irrigation
    sprinklers can also be used for industrial, commercial, residential, and agricultural
    purposes. Moreover, several studies considered sensor-based irrigation is a modern-day
    irrigation activity that is practiced in a large area under entire controlled-conditions,
    as it could eliminate the external environmental factors compared with the traditional
    irrigation activities. The GSM sensor-based irrigation control system with a gun
    sprinkler was declared in [ 32– 34] with rain gun systems operated with the automatic
    microcontroller for crops requiring a more significant amount of water in the
    field. Cell phone applications play a fundamental part in the multiple needs of
    humans. GPRS feature in the mobile phone application is used for irrigation control
    systems, but these systems are not economical and cover less range of agricultural
    land. The methods used GSM feature and the android app for sending a message to
    farmers and notify them about overirrigation and under irrigation that causes
    losses, leaching the nutrient content of soil [ 35, 36]. Satellite communication
    schemes are widely used or prefer where topography difference is significant,
    and cell phone service is not reachable [ 37, 38]. Radio systems with certified
    power (e.g., 5–10 W) with modems are also a good option but affected by topographic
    hindrance. For radiofrequency, repeater stations may become too costly when there
    is communication over a significant distance and different topography. The central
    aspect of this technology is to develop decision support systems based on field-specific
    information that exploits the chemical or applied water concentration [ 39]. Lamb
    et al. developed a system which is operated by photovoltaic irrigation to enhance
    water depletion by using temperature sensors and moisture sensors [ 40]. 2.1.
    Soil Evaporation Model [ 41, 42] For proper irrigation management, prediction
    of soil moisture plays a vital role. The Penmen method was considered to get the
    possible accurate results with a minimum error related with living grass reference
    crop. It was observed that the pan method would give us acceptable accuracy dependent
    on the position of the land. The FAO Penman–Monteith method to measure ET0 is
    shown in the following equations: where ET0 = reference evapotranspiration (mm
    day−1), G = heat flux density of soil [MJ m−2·day−1], μ2 = wind speed at height
    of 2 m [ms−1], T = daily mean air temperature at 3 m height [°C], Rn = crop surface
    net radiation [MJ M−2 day −1], ea = actual vapor pressure [kPa], es = saturated
    vapor pressure [kPa], es-ea = deficit saturation vapors pressure [kPa], P = atmospheric
    pressure [kPa], Δ = curve of slope vapor pressure [kPa °C−1], γ = psychrometric
    constant [kPa °C−1], z = elevation above sea level [m], e0 (T) = saturation vapor
    pressure at the air temperature T [kPa], CP = specific heat at constant pressure,
    1.013 10–3 [MJ kg−10C−1], λ = latent heat of vaporization, 2.45[MJ kg−1], € = ration
    molecular weight of water vapor/day air = 0.622. The soil moisture estimation
    is mainly depending upon the evapotranspiration. The other most frequently used
    method based on extraterrestrial radioactivity and temperature to evaluate ET0
    [ 43]: where ET0 = reference evapotranspiration (mm/day), Tmax and Tmin = max.
    temperature and min. temperature (°C), Ra = extraterrestrial radiation (MJm−2
    day−1). Ritchie purposed another method for the estimation of ET0 [ 44] based
    on solar radiation and temperature. It is expressed as where ET0 = reference evapotranspiration
    (mm/day); Tmax and Tmin = maximum and minimum temperature (°C); and Rs = solar
    radiation (MJm−2 day−1). When An evapotranspiration measurement method was established
    on neurofuzzy (NF) inference and originated that the NF model (depended on relative
    humidity, solar radioactivity, and air temperature) shows better precision over
    the combination of air temperature, wind speed, and solar radiation [ 45]. Soil
    moisture has been predicted from the weather forecast sensors placed at the farm.
    The soil moisture evaporation depends on air relative humidity, air temperature,
    radiation, and temperature of the soil [ 46]. A sensor-based and IoT constructed
    architecture (Figure 2) has been developed for collecting, processing, and transmitting
    the different physical parameters (air temperature, air relative humidity, soil
    moisture soil temperature, and radiation) of the farmland related to weather forecast
    information for making efficient irrigation.    Figure 2  The architecture of
    the proposed system. The system comprises two main components, i.e., Wireless
    Information Unit (WIU) and Wireless Sensor Unit (WSU). The sensor units have different
    types of sensors to sense the soil temperature and soil moisture, and the main
    microcontroller received sensed data and optimized it. ZigBee is used to send
    data to WIU. Such WSN networks also added a small transmission spectrum and high
    network costs [ 47– 49]. Data acquisition structures are developed to be used
    in environmental compliance along with greenhouses or food factories and lack
    of solidity to be used outside for prolonged periods. Vishwakarma and Choudhary
    developed another option for irrigation systems operated with SMS facilities,
    and farmers received a text to mobile phones. This system incessantly observes
    the irrigation pump and electric motor and aware the farmers by sending an SMS
    to the mobile telephone representing the accessibility of power supply to the
    motor. The farmer selects to turn off and on the electric motor by sending an
    SMS to the sensor-based systems that are installed on the field, and networks
    can act according to the programming command as received in SMS; the farmers are
    also able to set the timer according to their need to turn off the motor automatically
    [ 50]. 3. Remote Sensing in Modern Irrigation Remote sensing is the latest technique
    for collecting data through different satellite sensor technologies. This technique
    involves very close examination of vast land set images and photos that are captured
    by aerial photographs which are followed by an interpretation, identification,
    and mapping of different agricultural resources and various water data that are
    connected with forest, water bodies, villages, roads, crop area, soil, and land
    types. Throughout the agricultural field, optical or visual RS is one of the most
    often exploited in remote sensing. This uses various bands, i.e., NIR and SWIR
    sensors, to collect images from Earth surfaces by reflecting features from the
    surface of the target area [ 51]. Thermal sensors are often used to measure surface
    temperature and have detected rapid response variables to track crop health and
    crop stress [ 52, 53]. Thermal remote sensing is a process of monitoring radiation
    emitted from the surface of the object and transmits it to temperature without
    creating any contact with the object. All surface objects emit radiation above
    the temperature of °K or 273°C [ 54]. The absorption intensity of each object
    depends on the temperature; the higher the temperature, the greater the intensity
    of the radiation. Thermal remote sensing provides us with substantial temperature
    and energy transfer from the earth’s surface, which is essential to assume the
    processes and responses of the landscape [ 55, 56]. For many agriculture application
    series of airborne thermal sensors, the satellite uses directly or indirectly,
    as shown in Table 1. Table 1  Satellite and airborne thermal infrared sensors
    attached to platforms. These remote sensing and agrometrological station data
    are very useful to improve the actual crop yield estimation and involve in the
    development of crop growth and yield models. Soil moisture conditions also play
    a vital role in both rainfed and irrigated conditions. Thus, monitoring the moisture
    of the soil condition status using remote sensing data would be very impressive
    and useful to judge the actual crop condition in advance and provide valuable
    suggestions to farmers for their pesticide application, water-saving irrigation,
    and postponding fertilizer. 3.1. Why Sensors in Sprinkler Irrigation Sensors are
    used in sprinkler irrigation to get information about real-time physical and environmental
    characteristics, and they are also employed to acquire feedback and have regulators
    over the current situation. The sensors accumulated information to identify the
    current object, people, location, and conditions known as context [ 57, 58]. The
    agriculture sector carries numerous requirements through sensors that are as follows:
    (i) Monitoring of distributed land (ii) Collecting soil, crop, and weather information
    (iii) Multiple crops in a signal piece of land (iv) Fertilizer and water requirement
    of different irregular lands (v) Protective solution rather than the sensitive
    solution Different sensors that are mainly used to collect the data for agricultural-related
    practices and acquisition for soil, plant, and weather are discussed in Tables
    2–4. Table 2  Sensors used for irrigation control systems in farming domains (soil
    sensors). Table 3  Sensors used for irrigation control systems in farming domains
    (leaf/plant). Table 4  Sensors used for irrigation control systems in farming
    domains (weather). 3.2. Use of Sensors in Modern Irrigation Application of sensor
    is attractive in every field of life due to the novelty of this technology and
    size reduction; the ability of the sensor is to measure the physical characteristics
    and change them in to signal for an observer. Through specific irrigation management
    techniques, producers can maximize their yield by saving a large amount of water.
    Site-specific irrigation control systems are facing many challenges nowadays in
    terms of designing software, unified combination of sensors, data interface, and
    communication protocol [ 59]. Solar panels and electric power are a significant
    consideration. Many researchers are trying to address the different issues related
    to irrigation control and interfacing sensors by using numerous approaches. Shen
    et al. developed a GSM-SMS remote autonomous control system for the greenhouse
    [ 60], which depends on PC-based dataset and linked with the base station at the
    same time. The component of the based station is an actuator, GSM module, sensors,
    and microcontroller. The GSM module plays a vital role in the base station to
    send and receive messages from central stations. Various techniques can be used
    to calculate the soil moisture (in the gravimetric and volumetric forms), which
    are further classified into modern and classical procedures for both laboratory
    and in situ measurements. The conventional techniques to calculate the moisture
    in soil include tensiometers methods, thermogravimetric, gypsum block, and calcium
    carbide neutron scattering [ 61]. While for modern techniques, different latest
    dielectric technologies and infrared moisture balance such as heat flux moisture
    sensors, time domain reflectometry (TDR), capacitance and optical method, frequency
    domain reflectometry (FDR), and microelectromechanical systems are used [ 62,
    63]. Radio transmission wireless systems were used to transfer soil moisture data
    from data loggers to an essential data logging site where decisions are made and
    physically improved [ 64]. Figure 3 describes the practical approaches of the
    wireless sensor network mounted on the field. In this framework, farmers can obtain
    information in real-time (soil moisture and crop growth) through SMS facility
    or some android application for their area to get better management practices
    and crop yield. By utilizing this information, farmers can get updates about the
    farmland and nursery and could be opined about when and how much water is needed
    for irrigation practices. Automatic irrigation systems or nursery irrigation systems
    permit farmers to give or supply the right time of water with the right amount.
    This system also allows the farm manager to maintain the moisture level concerning
    time. Some studies proved that if we apply the water at the right time and right
    amount, the productions can be increased up to 25% to 30% [ 65, 66].    Figure
    3  Sensor network application in field source [ 67]. 3.3. Wireless Signal Communication
    in Irrigation Systems Various designs and architectures were proposed for plug-and-play
    technology to measure the soil moisture and develop the sprinkler valve controller
    for site-specific irrigation automation and management through distributed sensor
    network. Wall et al. stated that data arrangement and control management are the
    most effective techniques to manage all the data using low-cost microcontrollers.
    However, it is challenging to set the sensing stations on the field to connect
    base stations with wires because of station maintenance, labor cost, and considerable
    distance, especially more than 10 m. Wires systems are not very much feasible
    because cables are damaged by farm equipment and animals. That is why wireless
    networks develop grate intentions nowadays and avoid many of these problems and
    provide easy replacement of broadcast stations. Different wireless technologies
    are often used in much sensor-based research work, i.e., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and
    ZigBee [ 68]. A detailed assessment of different sensor-based technology is discussed
    in Table 5. ZigBee wireless sensors are the low-cost and lower-power-consumption
    technology that is mostly used to develop the wireless sensor network over different
    techniques. It was established in May 2003, and ISM (industrial scientific and
    medical) bands are used to operate, i.e., 2.4 GHz, globally. Table 5  Communication
    technologies in modern irrigation. For integrating sensors and actuators, there
    are some control standards for RS485 (current based) and RS232 (voltage base)
    wireless protocol that have been widely applied and well documented in some industrial
    application. Bluetooth and ZigBee (IEEE 802.11 standards) are designed for radio
    frequency of cell phone applications that require insufficient data, proper network
    security, and long battery life [ 69]. Kim et al. stated that ZigBee is a low-cost
    wireless networking system with advanced features; they provide high reliability
    due to its direct-sequence (DS/SS) and mesh networking systems. ZigBee technology
    is cheaper and reliable than Bluetooth, and it can also be used to ensure the
    integrity and to avoid interference. ZigBee not only requires deficient power
    than Bluetooth but can also transmit effectively over less distance (e.g., 30 m).
    Advanced wireless transmitters are accessible that are operated with Bluetooth
    and communicate up to 1 km. Mostly in the agriculture sector, these types of wireless
    technologies are connected to control and sense the field condition [ 70, 71].
    4. Description of the Data Acquisition System for the Specific Field A total of
    three sensors, including a air temperature and humidity sensor, a light intensity
    sensor, and a soil moisture sensor, were used for the assessment of any particular
    area to capture four environmental parameters, namely, temperature, humidity,
    surrounding light intensity, and soil moisture content. The data collection method
    provides the opportunity to assess the ecological conditions in the agricultural
    sector accurately. Also, the system’s versatility allows additional monitors,
    including a pH sensor, to estimate plant nutrients, a UV sensor to determine ultraviolet
    light intensity, greenhouse gases and pressure sensor to track the ambient air
    composition, a rain sensor is used to detect rainy weather, and a water level
    sensors used to identify flood in the region, and these are included in the system
    according to client requirement. The module was used to read the surrounding environment
    captured by the sensors and process the data, and wireless communication transmits
    the data to the cloud server over the network system. Vital information from all
    agricultural fields was gathered and processed on the cloud server, as shown in
    Figure 4. The irrigation surveillance system established for this assessment is
    cost-effective and highly interactive and can be easily adapted to any agricultural
    field using the plug-and-play technique. This system is also operated by solar
    energy, rendering individual data acquisition units entirely wireless and portable,
    thus eliminating the need for cabling for power supply and data transmission,
    leading to reduce installation, maintenance, and relocation costs.    Figure 4  Block
    diagram of the agriculture monitoring system. 4.1. On-Site and Functionality Analysis
    The sprinkler irrigation system was designed for wheat crop for an area of 1 acre.
    The total area was divided into four plots, each part consisting of a rain gun.
    The device has been tested to ensure that environmental data can be collected
    via sensors; the information can be transmitted to the IoT platform through an
    online website. The machine has been running for a few minutes to get several
    data entries. Sprinkler field has been divided into four plots, and soil moisture
    sensors have been mounted in each location. This test was conducted to ensure
    that the device can perform as required under real-world daily usage conditions.
    The prototype and layout of the data acquisition unit were switched on and staked
    into the ground of the research field, as shown in Figure 5. All four plots were
    atomized by connecting them through Wi-Fi networking. An on-site website was developed,
    which gives the current soil moisture readings of all the sensors installed in
    the field and save the recorded data. Sensor stand, board circuits, and continuous
    electric supply were managed using an uninterruptible power supply.   (a)       (a)  (b)  (c)       Figure
    5  On-site test for automated irrigation: (a) layout sketch; (b) solenoid valves,
    GSM module, and moisture sensor; (c) installed moisture sensor. The system was
    able to capture broadcast and environmental data as designed successfully. The
    light intensity sensors were also closed as the water was poured into the soil
    to simulate a change in environmental conditions. The computer was able to detect
    these changes without any problems, as shown in Figure 6. All tested fields were
    atomized once again by connecting them through a Wi-Fi network. An on-site website
    was also devolved, which gives the current soil moisture readings of all the sensors
    installed in the field and saves the recorded data. An account on Thing Speak
    was also made to make graphs of the recorded data. Sensor stand, board circuits,
    and continuous electric supply were managed using an uninterruptible power supply.
    Moreover, one point of contention during the prototype test was the wireless connectivity
    range. As this test was carried out by linking a prototype signal processing unit
    to a Wi-Fi network established by a Wi-Fi hotspot from a cell phone, the device
    would lose its connection and stop transmitting information to the IoT platform
    if it moved approximately 5 m apart from the user. This problem could be overcome
    by installing wireless access points (WAPs) throughout the field via the wireless
    local area network (WLAN) since this is the primary form of wireless connectivity
    for the full-scale implementation of the device. One WAP implementation will provide
    an enhanced wireless network range of up to 0.5 km. This system facilitated to
    improve the labor efficiency, water productivity, and water use efficiency in
    cereal crops (i.e., wheat and maize) and saved water about 44% in the case of
    a sprinkler irrigation system. It was also concluded that 20 feet border treatment
    was better treatment than other treatments as agronomic results were better for
    this treatment, and cutoff distance must be between 60 and 70 percent of total
    length. Based on wireless sensor network systems, different opportunities must
    have been created for existing application areas that require real and remote
    sensing data for observing consequences. However, these tools have possessed many
    problems that must be solved for a long-time variability of the proposed system.
    Different issues like more energy are required for operating sensors nodes, development
    issues containing communication, deployment, and protocols. The problems in wireless
    networks were discussed in the previous work [ 22, 72] and have been addressed
    to a solution [ 73, 74]. There are some possibilities that strong wind also creates
    some problem in the sensor so there should be robust fitting around the sensors
    to support the nodes. The advantages and disadvantages of (WSN) in sensor-based
    irrigation are discussed in Table 6.    Figure 6  On-site analysis data on IoT
    platform. Table 6  Advantages and disadvantages of wireless sensor network. 4.2.
    Advantages of Automated Sprinkler Irrigation The primary objective of automated
    sprinkler irrigation is to supply a minimum amount of irrigation water throughout
    the fields. Sensor-based irrigation has a significant potentiation to save water
    and increase economic efficiencies. The main advantage of this system is to reduce
    the input cost or to increase the yield for the same input. With this irrigation
    technology, the human intervention must be minimized. With the automated technology
    of irrigation, human intervention can be reduced [ 75, 76]. Some advantages of
    this innovation can be discussed as follows. 4.2.1. Water-Saving Technology Many
    researchers have been reported that the intelligence irrigation method is the
    ideal possible method of accomplishing significant water saving [ 77]. Muñoz-Carpena
    and Dukes stated that sprinkler irrigation with sensor applications could improved
    the water efficiency up to 80–90% as against 40–45% in the surface irrigation
    method [ 78]. Blomquist et al. [ 62] concluded that 16% of water could be saved
    in this irrigation practice. 4.2.2. System Cost The irrigation system is developed
    with the module design, which helped a lot to reduce the cost. The wireless sensor
    node and actuator node were about 30 US dollars, and the portable controller was
    around $100. The total cost to build up a wireless field irrigation system depended
    on the planting area, and for a case of 5000 m2, it was approximately $500 in
    terms of hardware cost. 4.2.3. Profit and Yield Proper timing of irrigation is
    stated to be a critical factor in production while delaying irrigation can result
    in losses of between US$ 62/ha and US$ 300/ha. [ 79]. El-Kader and El-Basioni
    conducted an experiment on [ 67] potato yield measured in Egypt using sensor-based
    network technology. It has been confirmed that yields have improved, and a loss
    of 2 billion pounds has been recovered in a year. Due to these reasons, the quality
    of water used is reduced and the distribution of water is not optimized. Farmers
    irrigate their fields based on their traditional information without worrying
    about soil moisture levels, soil quality, crop water requirements, and weather
    forecasting. 4.3. Control Options of Sprinkler Mechanism During irrigation, the
    event control system is responsible for regulating the speed of sprinkler systems
    multiple times and also moves the sprinkler position at 360° of the field, where
    the rate will be changed and decision about more lees or no irrigation water is
    taken. This phenomenon would be used where different crops are planted in the
    same field [ 80, 81]. A series of the on-off cycle can be used to accomplish the
    water depth application for the individual sprinkler control system [ 82, 83].
    Adjusting the traveling speed of the center pivot sprinkler system is the most
    basic method to measure the water depth against field topographic, soil condition,
    and different crops. The primary function of center pivot systems is to irrigate
    the land from one point in a circle and work on the different topography regions
    having a range in soil textures present under a single machine. So that these
    factors are the main reasons to use the controller to manage the water application
    in the field based upon the need. Site-specific irrigation and variable rate irrigation
    are the main terms that describe the water applications devises in order to maximize
    the yield and economical value for irrigation water applied through different
    moving systems [ 84, 85]. Chavez et al. reported that, for better performance
    of remote irrigation systems, control and monitoring systems are fixed on two
    different lined moves. A series of in-field and onboard wireless sensor networks
    are used to verify the precision irrigation systems with high accuracy. Separate
    nozzle regulators were pounded according to sanction maps [ 86, 87]. Various manifolds
    attached with different sizes of sprinkler nozzles should be used for accomplishing
    and controlling irrigation water application depth to fluctuate water and nitrogen
    application [ 88, 89]. Usually, open solenoids were attached with systems to allow
    the insurance to supply the irrigation water even when control systems failed.
    For controlling irrigation water application, a variable flow sprinkler was developed
    by King and Kincaid [ 90] and Liu et al. [ 91]. It used the activated pin, which
    is operated mechanically to regulate the orifice area of nozzle and mainly it
    depends on operating pressure, and the flow rate of the sprinkler is adjusted
    within the range of 35% to 100%. Hydraulic or electric actuators were used to
    control the pin. The main problem is that the droplet size distribution and the
    wetted pattern are changed with flow rate and create a uniformity issue with overlapping
    of the sprinkler pattern [ 92, 93]. 2-3 manifolds were used in these systems,
    which serve to maintain the depth of water and water application rate. 5. Summary
    and Conclusion The objective of this research work was to highlight the development
    of improved agricultural monitoring systems that address problems of existing
    plans, including price, availability, and outdoor accessibility. A simple, low-cost,
    sustainable agricultural control system that is extremely customizable and reliable
    for outdoor use, self-powered to reduce the need for long power supply cables,
    while providing better functionality that helps to reduce the agricultural burden
    and promotes crop yields and income, has been developed. In semiarid regions of
    emerging countries, small farmers and marginal farmers (who have land b/w 4 and
    6 hectares) are facing many problems regarding powered irrigation. Most of the
    time, they are relying on seasonal precipitation for their productivity. The data
    analysis unit composed of sensors and integrated circuits may successfully capture
    the physiological conditions such as temperature, humidity, light density, and
    soil water content. These data are vital for field managers to manage resources,
    develop predictive crop growth models, and automate farm machinery. This contributes
    to successful agriculture activities, and resource use decreased the operational
    costs and workloads and increased the crop productivity. The WSN system built
    in this study offers an enhanced monitoring range. The intelligent sensor-based
    irrigation system work has been discussed in this review paper, controlling the
    different irrigation management practices by sensing different agriculture parameters
    such as soil moisture, soil pH, humidity, and temperature. These systems allow
    farmers to monitor and control their farmland with user friendly mobile applications.
    The sensor-based irrigation protects water pumps against any harmful damages by
    controlling and monitoring water pressure and input voltage. Demands for sensor-based
    irrigation increase day by day and have a substantial future scope. It is time-saving
    and also removes the human error by controlling soil moisture levels. The development
    of sensor-based applications in agriculture makes it possible to increase the
    productivity, efficiency, and profitability through precision agriculture farming.

    of intelligent sprinkler irrigation technologies for remote autonomous system
    Xingye Zhu, Prince Chikangaise, Weidong Shi, Wen-Hua Chen, Shouqi Yuan  Abstract  Changing
    of environmental conditions and shortage of water demands a system that can manage
    irrigation efficiently. Autonomous irrigation systems are developed to optimize
    water use for agricultural crops. In dry areas or in case of inadequate rainfall,
    irrigation becomes difficult. So, it needs to be automated for proper yield and
    handled remotely for farmer safety. The aim of this study is to review the needs
    of soil moisture sensors in irrigation, sensor technology and their applications
    in irrigation scheduling and, discussing prospects. The review further discusses
    the literature of sensors remotely communicating with self-propelled sprinkler
    irrigation systems, distributed wireless sensor networks, sensors and integrated
    data management schemes and autonomous sprinkler control options. On board and
    field-distributed sensors can collect data necessary for real-time irrigation
    management decisions and transmit the information directly or through wireless
    networks to the main control panel or base computer. Communication systems such
    as cell phones, satellite radios, and internet-based systems are also available
    allowing the operator to query the main control panel or base computer from any
    location at any time. Selection of the communication system for remote access
    depends on local and regional topography and cost. Traditional irrigation systems
    may provide unnecessary irrigation to one part of a field while leading to a lack
    of irrigation in other parts. New sensors or remotely sensing capabilities are
    required to collect real time data for crop growth status and other parameters
    pertaining to weather, crop and soil to support intelligent and efficient irrigation
    management systems for agricultural processes. Further development of wireless
    sensor applications in agriculture is also necessary for increasing efficiency,
    productivity and profitability of farming operations. Keywords: intelligent sprinkler

    \ population and rising living standards are increasing the\ndemand for agricultural\
    \ products. Under higher pressure over natural resources, environmental\nconcerns\
    \ are increasing as well, challenging current water use decision-making processes\
    \ in irrigated\nagriculture. Higher agricultural productivity means water should\
    \ be applied more eﬃciently, which\nrequires instant information on weather, soil,\
    \ and plant conditions throughout the growing season.\nAn information-based irrigation\
    \ scheduling application tightened to the spatiotemporal variability of\nthe ﬁelds\
    \ is critical for enhancing the current irrigation system and making better irrigation\
    \ scheduling\ndecisions. The aim of this study is to review current irrigation\
    \ scheduling methodologies based on\ntwo case studies (woody and ﬁeld crops) located\
    \ in semi-arid areas of Southeast Spain. We realize\nthat optimal irrigation programming\
    \ requires consistent investment in equipment, expenditure on\noperation and maintenance,\
    \ and qualiﬁed technical and maintenance services. These technological\napproaches\
    \ will be worthwhile in farms with low water availability, high proﬁtability,\
    \ and signiﬁcant\ntechnical-economic capacity.\nKeywords: water proﬁtability;\
    \ water scarcity; sensors; big data; information and communication\ntechnologies;\
    \ irrigation scheduling\n1. Introduction\nA growing international population and\
    \ rising living standards are increasing the demand for\nagricultural products.\
    \ At the same time, globalization, markets liberalization, growing pressure on\n\
    natural resources, and environmental concerns are heightening the need for improved\
    \ agricultural\nproductivity [1,2].\nIn the case of irrigated agriculture, meeting\
    \ this requirement involves a paradigm shift. Maximizing\nnet proﬁts will demand\
    \ a more economic approach than simply maximizing crop yields. This is\nsigniﬁcantly\
    \ complex and challenging, requiring that water be applied in a wiser, more precise,\
    \ and\naccurate fashion because the margin for error narrows [3].\nWater 2020,\
    \ 12, 785; doi:10.3390/w12030785\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/water\nWater 2020, 12,\
    \ 785\n2 of 26\nFrom an engineering standpoint, achieving the above depends on\
    \ having more information, using\nenhanced irrigation systems and making better\
    \ irrigation scheduling decisions. Instant information is\nrequired for a thorough\
    \ understanding of weather, soil, and plant conditions throughout the growing\n\
    season. Enhanced irrigation systems are needed for a uniform application of water\
    \ depths tailored to\nthe spatiotemporal variability of the ﬁelds. Better decisions\
    \ are necessary to convert these capacities\ninto proﬁts.\nThe scientiﬁc community\
    \ and industry work to meet these needs, taking advantage of geolocated\nand internet-enabled\
    \ devices. As a result, a wide range of technologies has been developed. Multiple\n\
    sensors for weather, soil and plant measurements can supply data continuously\
    \ and automatically in\nﬁxed points located within the ﬁeld. Weather conditions,\
    \ soil moisture and temperature, plant sap ﬂow,\ntrunk diameter, and leaf turgor\
    \ pressure are some of the variables monitored by these sensors [4,5].\nData can\
    \ also be obtained for the whole ﬁeld area. Remote and proximal sensing based\
    \ on radar\nand spectral sensors onboard satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles,\
    \ tractors and even centre-pivots and\nlinear-moving irrigation systems allow\
    \ high spatial and/or temporal resolution monitoring of soil\nmoisture and plant\
    \ water and nutrient status. Proximal electromagnetic induction sensors can also\
    \ be\nused for mapping soil properties along with soil sampling and testing [6–8].\n\
    High quality equipment for water application has also been developed. If adequately\
    \ selected\nand dimensioned modern irrigation systems can provide excellent performance\
    \ under a wide range of\nenvironmental conditions. Furthermore, variable rate\
    \ technology enables the application of site-speciﬁc\nwater depths according to\
    \ the spatial variability of the soil and plant conditions throughout the ﬁeld\
    \ [8].\nDealing with all these data and irrigation system capabilities involves\
    \ great analytical complexity.\nAutomated irrigation controllers have been designed\
    \ for this purpose. These controllers include\na module that computes an optimized\
    \ irrigation scheduling (and a prescription map in the case\nof variable rate\
    \ systems) according to a predeﬁned irrigation strategy and goal. The optimization\n\
    process is based on sensor data or/and output data from simulation models. Given\
    \ the complexity of\nthe soil-plant-atmosphere continuum and the uncertainty of\
    \ the available data, artiﬁcial intelligence\ntechniques are used to search for\
    \ the optimal solution. These techniques are also applied in other\nrelated processes,\
    \ such as model calibration and weather and water demand forecasting [4,8,9].\n\
    Despite the sophistication of this cutting-edge hardware and software, their prices\
    \ have become\naﬀordable for commercial use. Recent advances in sensors and information\
    \ and communication\ntechnologies have slashed the cost of generating, transmitting,\
    \ storing and processing large amounts\nof data. Consequently, the implementation\
    \ of these technologies in commercial farms is considered\nfeasible, in practice,\
    \ for improving their economic and environmental footprint. Likewise, its use\n\
    could improve the adaptation to climate change and to changing water demand and\
    \ supply patterns,\nenhancing food security [10–13].\nAs a consequence, these\
    \ technologies for irrigation and agriculture are generally being considered\n\
    by governments and international organizations as promising tools to achieve a\
    \ sustainable\nintensiﬁcation of agricultural production [14–16]. However, some\
    \ studies carried out in industrialized\ncountries conclude that their adoption\
    \ is not widespread, and, on average, their economic proﬁtability\nis low [17,18].\n\
    Farmers readily adopt technologies, such as auto-steer machinery and irrigation\
    \ pivots, which\nrequire limited new training and skills. However, adoption of\
    \ information-intensive technologies,\nsuch as soil or plant moisture sensors\
    \ and related software, is often limited. These technologies\nrequire further\
    \ investments in learning and/or hiring external services for data analysis. Changes\
    \ in\nmanagement practices are also often needed to accommodate data-driven decisions.\
    \ Such requirements\nmay even aﬀect the proﬁle of farmers, shifting from that\
    \ of a land manager, who grows crops according\nto his/her practical experience,\
    \ to farm technician, whose work should also be based on technical\nknowledge\
    \ [18–20].\nFarmers can adopt very diﬀerent information technology levels to ﬁne-tune\
    \ their management\npractices. Each level encompasses the use of diﬀerent layers\
    \ of information. Assessing the value\nWater 2020, 12, 785\n3 of 26\ngiven by\
    \ each information layer is essential for selecting the most suitable technological\
    \ level for each\nfarm [5,19,21].\nThe value of information is the increase in\
    \ the expected value of the outcome arising from the\nintroduction of an additional\
    \ layer of information in the decision process [22]. It depends on the\nquality\
    \ of the data (e.g., precision, trueness and timing), its total cost (e.g., investment,\
    \ operation\nand maintenance) and the conditions of the farm (e.g., environmental,\
    \ agronomic, socio-economic,\nand technical). Therefore, a particular technology\
    \ can provide diﬀerent economic and environmental\nresults depending on the region\
    \ and farm where it is used [5,18,21].\nSelecting and managing the most suitable\
    \ technological level requires technical knowledge and\nskills, as well as unbiased\
    \ information about the performance of the available technologies. Poor\ninformation\
    \ and/or low knowledge and skills mean decisions are made in a context of uncertainty,\n\
    which in turn, means cultural factors and cognitive biases may lead to the adoption\
    \ of sub-optimal\nsolutions or simply to no decisions being made. Thus, the early\
    \ adopters of new technologies are usually\nyounger farmers, with higher education\
    \ levels and larger farms in terms of economic size [17–19,23,24].\nFarms located\
    \ in the Mediterranean countries of the EU are usually smallholdings managed\n\
    by aged farmers with a low level of technical education. These features hamper\
    \ the uptake of new\ntechnologies [24]. An example of this situation is Spain,\
    \ where 59% of the farmers are older than\n55 years and only 18% have agricultural\
    \ technical training for the implementation of information and\ncommunication\
    \ technologies (ICTs) on their farms. The mean economic farm size is 37,284 €\
    \ in terms\nof standard output, which is lower than two thirds of the EU15 average\
    \ (member states of the EU on\n30 April 2004), although the 1% largest farms (≥0.5\
    \ M€) accounts for 32% of the national standard\noutput [25].\nThe Government\
    \ is tackling this problem by promoting and subsidizing the modernization of\n\
    irrigation infrastructures. As a result, water transport and distribution facilities,\
    \ as well as on-farm\nirrigation systems have been modernized across 1.5 Mha since\
    \ the beginning of this century [26].\nHowever, a number of studies have suggested\
    \ that irrigation management should be enhanced in\norder to capture the full\
    \ economic and environmental value that modern infrastructure can potentially\n\
    provide [27–31].\nMuch research has been speciﬁcally conducted to bridge this\
    \ gap [32–36]. Nevertheless, there are\nvery few analyses focused on identifying\
    \ the farm conditions that make the techniques developed\nin these studies proﬁtable.\
    \ Such analyses, along with a strengthening of extension services, training\n\
    programs, and regional trials among other measures, would enhance farmers’ capabilities\
    \ to select and\nuse technologies that help them to optimize the management of\
    \ their irrigation infrastructures [18,21,24].\nIt is clear from the above overview\
    \ that carrying out an optimal irrigation scheduling is essential\nfor improving\
    \ water and energy use in irrigated agriculture. Accordingly, methodologies focused\
    \ on\nthis issue and advances in new technologies and equipment to be implemented\
    \ in this sector have been\ndeveloped. However, in the majority of farms, these\
    \ advances have not properly got oﬀ the ground due\nto the low technical training\
    \ of farmers and the reduced proﬁtability of agricultural products, making\nthe\
    \ investment of new technologies unaﬀordable. Hence, the aim of this study is\
    \ to review the main\nfactors inﬂuencing irrigation scheduling and document the\
    \ impact of ICTs on these factors to identify\nthe conditions that drive the return\
    \ on investment of various irrigation scheduling methodologies.\nThis review is\
    \ supported by the analysis of several case studies located in semi-arid areas\
    \ of Southeast\nSpain, a country with a 30% of irrigated cropland [37] and most\
    \ of this area being under Mediterranean\nnatural conditions. The review starts\
    \ by describing the main factors that should be considered for\noptimal irrigation\
    \ scheduling. Then, several case studies methodologies focused on optimal irrigation\n\
    scheduling applied in both woody and ﬁeld crops under semi-arid conditions are\
    \ presented. In the\nﬁnal section, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of\
    \ these irrigation scheduling methodologies,\nbased on the case studies evaluated.\n\
    Water 2020, 12, 785\n4 of 26\n2. Factors that Aﬀect Optimal Irrigation Scheduling\n\
    Irrigation management depends on several factors, most of which are interrelated,\
    \ as shown in\nFigure 1. Diﬀerent combinations of these factors enable optimal\
    \ irrigation schedules to be achieved\ndepending on the technological level of\
    \ the farms (low, intermediate, or high) as regards the technological\nelements\
    \ used, as described below.\nWater 2020, 12, 785 \n4  of  25 \n \n2. Factors that Affect Optimal Irrigation Scheduling \n\
    Irrigation management depends on several factors, most of which are interrelated, as shown in \n\
    Fig.1.  Different  combinations  of  these  factors  enable  optimal  irrigation \
    \ schedules  to  be  achieved \ndepending  on  the  technological  level  of \
    \ the  farms  (low,  intermediate,  or  high)  as  regards  the \ntechnological elements used, as described below. \n\
     \nFigure 1. Interaction between irrigation scheduling factors. \n \nCrop \n\
    The crop is the main driver of irrigation scheduling as irrigation is intended to satisfy the fraction \n\
    of crop water requirements (WR) that cannot be satisfied with rainwater during the crop season. WR \n\
    are equivalent to the amount of water evapotranspirated by the crop, ETc, which can be linked to the \n\
    agro‐climatic variable, reference evapotranspiration, ETo, by the crop coefficient, Kc [38]. It depends \n\
    on  the  crop  characteristics,  taking  into  account  crop  height,  the  crop‐soil \
    \ surface  resistance,  and \nalbedo of the crop soil surface [39].   \nRecommended Kc values for different crops can be found in the literature [38]. However, there \n\
    are  no  available  Kc  values  for  certain  crops,  or  the  recommended  values \
    \ are  suited  to  different \nenvironmental  conditions  [40].  Thus,  different \
    \ works  have  focused  on  setting  specific  Kc  values \nconsidering on‐site environmental conditions by relating the ETc with ETo using lysimeters [41–44]. \n\
    Alternatively, other authors have used crop simulation models to determine specific Kc values for \n\
    non‐stressed and well irrigated crops (e.g., bean and cabbage crops in Germany [45]). \
    \  \nFigure 1. Interaction between irrigation scheduling factors.\n• Crop\nThe\
    \ crop is the main driver of irrigation scheduling as irrigation is intended to\
    \ satisfy the fraction\nof crop water requirements (WR) that cannot be satisﬁed\
    \ with rainwater during the crop season. WR are\nequivalent to the amount of water\
    \ evapotranspirated by the crop, ETc, which can be linked to the\nagro-climatic\
    \ variable, reference evapotranspiration, ETo, by the crop coeﬃcient, Kc [38].\
    \ It depends\non the crop characteristics, taking into account crop height, the\
    \ crop-soil surface resistance, and albedo\nof the crop soil surface [39].\nRecommended\
    \ Kc values for diﬀerent crops can be found in the literature [38]. However, there\n\
    are no available Kc values for certain crops, or the recommended values are suited\
    \ to diﬀerent\nenvironmental conditions [40]. Thus, diﬀerent works have focused\
    \ on setting speciﬁc Kc values\nconsidering on-site environmental conditions by\
    \ relating the ETc with ETo using lysimeters [41–44].\nAlternatively, other authors\
    \ have used crop simulation models to determine speciﬁc Kc values for\nnon-stressed\
    \ and well irrigated crops (e.g., bean and cabbage crops in Germany [45]).\nWater\
    \ 2020, 12, 785\n5 of 26\nThe use of speciﬁc crop coeﬃcients can improve irrigation\
    \ programming, generating both higher\nyields and water use eﬃciency [46].\n•\
    \ Weather data\nLocal weather determines crop irrigation requirements (IR) and\
    \ consequently irrigation programming.\nRainfall and air temperature are the basic\
    \ data required to calculate IR using values of eﬀective\nprecipitation (Pe) and\
    \ ETo estimated by low-parameter procedures like the Hargreaves equation [47].\n\
    However, many weather stations can now also record data such as humidity, solar\
    \ radiation and wind\nspeed, among others (e.g., [48]). When this information\
    \ is available, physically based ETo calculation\nmethods, such as the Penman-Monteith\
    \ model [38], can be used to provide accurate estimations of\nETo [49,50]. Thus,\
    \ in many cases, there is either a lack of data or their quality is not guaranteed,\n\
    or the weather station is located too far from the area studied [51,52]. This\
    \ leads to non-accurate ETo\nestimations [53] which means uncertainties in the\
    \ irrigation programming.\n• Soil data\nSoil characteristics such as soil condition,\
    \ slope, texture, structure, depth, organic matter content,\nbulk density, salinity,\
    \ acidity drainage, fertility and chemical parameters aﬀect soil water distribution\n\
    and root water absorption [54]. Standard numerical soil properties at a spatial\
    \ resolution of 250 m and at\na global scale can be obtained from systems such\
    \ as SoilGridsTM [55]. However, soil measurements are\npoint measurements that\
    \ show spatiotemporal variability in the same ﬁeld during the irrigation season.\n\
    Accordingly, these authors evaluated the time and spatial variability of soil\
    \ hydraulic characteristics\nduring the cropping season, showing that soil variations\
    \ during the season are important and lead to\ninaccurate irrigation programming.\
    \ Irrigation events also aﬀect soil hydraulic characteristics, which\nhighlights\
    \ the importance of carrying out soil hydraulic parameter analysis during the\
    \ cropping season\nto improve irrigation programming [56].\nIn sandy soils, with\
    \ a low water retention capacity, spatiotemporal hydraulic characterization is\n\
    crucial [57,58]. As an example of watering diﬃculties in sandy soils, in a two-season\
    \ study of irrigated\npotato cultivated in a sandy soil in USA, soil water storage\
    \ and deep drainage at several zones across\nthe farm were evaluated [57], detecting\
    \ a signiﬁcant spatiotemporal variability in soil water storage\nand temporal\
    \ diﬀerences on deep drainage. To reduce deep drainage, soil water movement models\n\
    like Hydrus 2-D were used to set the optimum duration of irrigation pulses in\
    \ strawberries cultivated\nin extremely sandy soils in Spain, for each crop development\
    \ stage [58].\n• Irrigation scheduling criteria\nIrrigation scheduling consists\
    \ of setting the timing and the amount of water to be applied to the\ncrop [59]\
    \ to either maximize the production or to maximize the beneﬁt [59]. Over recent\
    \ decades, these\ngoals have also been linked to eﬃciency criteria in the use\
    \ of both water and energy resources [60].\nTo achieve them, several “irrigation\
    \ criteria” have been used to establish the irrigation scheduling:\n(1) A farmer’s\
    \ perception/ experience of crop irrigation needs, which usually results in less-than-optimal\n\
    irrigation scheduling (lack of water during some crop stages and over-irrigation\
    \ in others) and hence,\nlower production and proﬁts [61]; (2) Rational estimation\
    \ of daily crop irrigation requirements using\nhistorical climate data that are\
    \ daily updated during the irrigation season [62]; (3) Rational estimation\nof\
    \ daily crop irrigation requirements based on both climate information and on\
    \ daily soil water\nbalance [63,64]; (4) Estimation of daily irrigation needs\
    \ using soil water data collected from soil\nmoisture sensors [65,66]; (5) Irrigation\
    \ needs estimated from plant water status monitoring using sap\nﬂow sensors [5,67],\
    \ trunk growth rate sensors [68], leaf water potential [69], or leaf turgor pressure\n\
    sensors [70], among others.\nThe above criteria deﬁne the daily irrigation program\
    \ once the irrigation strategy is established.\nSeveral factors condition the\
    \ irrigation strategy: the water allocation for the whole season (from full\n\
    irrigation to diﬀerent levels of deﬁcit irrigation [71]); the type of irrigation\
    \ system and its hydraulic\ncharacteristics [62,63]; or water availability at\
    \ ﬁeld scale, according to the management of the irrigation\nWater 2020, 12, 785\n\
    6 of 26\ndistrict (on demand irrigation in which farmers can irrigate 24 h a day\
    \ or by irrigation turns [72,73]),\nto name a few.\n• Water source, water rights,\
    \ and water markets\nWater sources for irrigation include groundwater from wells,\
    \ surface water, rain harvesting and\ntreated water from municipal areas [74].\
    \ The kind and quality of water source aﬀects water availability\nat ﬁeld scale.\
    \ For example, groundwater is a more reliable water source and less vulnerable\
    \ to drought\ncompared to surface water [75]. As for using rain harvesting pond\
    \ or treated water for irrigation, water\navailability will be aﬀected by climatic\
    \ variables, the pond storage capacity, and the legislation on that\nissue [76,77].\n\
    Water rights are required to legally establish the available water at ﬁeld scale.\
    \ “A water right\nis a legal entitlement authorizing water to be diverted from\
    \ a speciﬁed source and put to beneﬁcial,\nnon-wasteful use” [78]. Hence, water\
    \ rights aﬀect irrigation programming.\nTo name a few examples, in England, a\
    \ license is required to abstract water for irrigation and to\nobtain/ renew this\
    \ license, farmers must demonstrate that water is used eﬃciently [79]. In areas\
    \ of\nhigh competition for water, such as the Mediterranean basin, the water authorities\
    \ usually impose\nrestrictions on water use that do not always make the producer\
    \ aware of the eﬃcient use of irrigation\nwater, implementing precision irrigation\
    \ based on optimal irrigation schedules [80]. In Spain, water\nallocations are\
    \ usually assigned per crop, causing occasional disputes between water authorities\
    \ and\nfarmers, who demand more water [81].\nIn other areas, water rights are\
    \ characterized by elements such as priority date, whereby users\nwho ﬁrst acquired\
    \ water rights take preference in accessing water resources over other users who\n\
    obtained their rights later. Hence, during droughts periods, reductions in water\
    \ allocations aﬀect “new”\nfarmers ﬁrst [82]. Accordingly, in a study carried\
    \ out in California’s Central Valley on the eﬀects of\nwater rights on agricultural\
    \ production during drought periods, it was shown that watersheds whose\nfarmers\
    \ have more senior water rights have on average better agricultural productivity\
    \ outcomes than\nwatersheds with more junior rights [83].\nIn some semi-arid countries,\
    \ particularly during droughts, economic instruments to deal with\nwater allocations\
    \ are available. Water markets are one such instrument, enabling voluntary water\n\
    exchanges between users. Australia, and to a lesser extent, Spain and California,\
    \ are three representative\nexamples of water trade [84]. In a study on the eﬀects\
    \ of droughts on water markets in the three regions\nindicated above, the authors\
    \ highlighted that drought periods are a triggering factor for water trade\nbetween\
    \ users [84].\n• Water distribution system and irrigation system.\nOpen channel\
    \ water distribution networks usually entail higher water losses than pressurized\n\
    irrigation networks [85]. Therefore, these losses must be taken into account for\
    \ irrigation programming [86].\nConversely, pressurized irrigation networks show\
    \ higher water use eﬃciency but also increased energy\nrequirements [87]. In these\
    \ kinds of networks, the operating conditions should be considered in the\ndesign\
    \ of such networks. This ensures that hydrant service conditions are adequate\
    \ for the proper\nfunctioning of on-ﬁeld irrigation systems, applying the expected\
    \ water depth and avoiding inadequate\nirrigation schedules that lead to ineﬃcient\
    \ use of water [88].\nThe hydraulic features of the on-farm irrigation system\
    \ must also be considered to establish the\nirrigation programming. These features\
    \ depend on the type of system (surface, sprinkler, or trickle)\nand its design\
    \ (layout) and hydrant operation (sectoring) [63,89].\n• Energy source and its\
    \ management\nPressurized water distribution and application systems are generally\
    \ more eﬃcient in the use of\nwater than open channel systems. For this reason,\
    \ they have become common in recent decades [90].\nWater 2020, 12, 785\n7 of 26\n\
    However, the price to be paid for this improvement is the augmentation of energy\
    \ costs, in many\ncases leading to increases of more than 50% in the cost of irrigation\
    \ compared to previous gravity\nirrigation systems [85].\nIn recent years, numerous\
    \ studies have aimed to optimize the use of water and energy in irrigation\nsystems\
    \ at irrigation district scale considering the operation of the network (sectoring,\
    \ control of critical\npoints or electric tariﬀ selection, [91–93]). The operation\
    \ of the main hydraulic networks designed\nto reduce energy costs may limit the\
    \ available irrigation time for farmers conditioning the irrigation\nschedule\
    \ of their ﬁelds. For example, some irrigation districts (ID) in Spain have reduced\
    \ their energy\ncosts by choosing the lowest electric tariﬀ: farmers can irrigate\
    \ during the night from Monday to Friday\nand for 24 h on Saturdays, Sundays,\
    \ and bank holidays [73]. Their energy costs savings are about 25%\nfor similar\
    \ water use [94].\nHowever, optimal management of irrigation networks does not\
    \ avoid the dependence of irrigation\nagriculture on ﬂuctuations in energy prices.\
    \ Therefore, in recent years, the reduction of electricity\nproduction costs from\
    \ renewable energy sources (wind, solar photovoltaic and micro hydropower)\nis\
    \ facilitating their incorporation into the irrigation sector [64,95,96]. Since\
    \ the generation of energy\ndepends on suitable weather conditions (suﬃcient wind\
    \ or solar radiation for pumping), irrigation\nmust be scheduled around the availability\
    \ of renewably sourced energy [64].\n• Management and control technologies\nThe\
    \ technological development of the last decade has had enormous repercussions\
    \ in irrigation\nmanagement and control. Today’s commercial sensors and irrigation\
    \ controllers, ICs, provide a good\nvalue for money in an aﬀordable price range\
    \ for most farmers. In addition, the constant improvement\nof information and\
    \ communication technologies, ICTs, facilitates the interaction between sensors,\
    \ IC,\nand users through web platforms and applications for mobile devices [62,97].\n\
    ICs open and close pipes remotely enabling or disabling the electro-valves associated\
    \ with each\nirrigation sector according to the irrigation times programmed (input\
    \ data). These are key devices to\nmake irrigation easier for farmers as they\
    \ can start and ﬁnish irrigation at any time, no matter day or\nnight, during\
    \ the daily period available for irrigation with daily, weekly or monthly frequency.\
    \ Input\ndata are introduced by the user, or a baseline irrigation schedule is\
    \ updated periodically according to\nreal time information on the variables that\
    \ aﬀect irrigation (e.g., soil moisture, pressure at the pumping\nstation, irradiance)\
    \ measured by sensors [64]. The IC’s operational rules may be simple (exceedance\
    \ of\nthreshold values) or optimal irrigation schedules based on soil-plant-water\
    \ models and optimization\nprocedures [34,98–101]. Thus, the IC installed on a\
    \ farm conditions the irrigation programming.\nThere currently exists a wide range\
    \ of commercial sensors to monitor and control crop, soil,\nclimatic variables\
    \ and the irrigation network. Their records are stored in data loggers that, in\
    \ most\ncases, can be remotely accessed by ICs and/or web platforms/app for mobile\
    \ terminals.\nWeb platforms funded by either public institutions or private associations\
    \ to support irrigation\nprogramming have become a common tool among technical\
    \ staﬀ and farmers, many of them accessible\nby apps for smartphones/tablets,\
    \ thanks to the exponential development of ICTs in recent years [102].\nIrrigation\
    \ apps allow farmers to visualize the key variables of each event, and even act\
    \ on the system\nfrom almost anywhere, as telecommunication coverage has improved\
    \ in rural areas. Web platforms\nand apps are accessible for both individual farmers\
    \ and irrigators’ associations, expanding the number\nof potential users compared\
    \ to the supervisory control and acquisition data systems, SCADA, which\nmonitored\
    \ and controlled systems from a ﬁxed location and were restricted to associations\
    \ and large\nfarms, but which have been a key factor in the digitization of irrigated\
    \ agriculture [103].\nThe spatiotemporal variability of applied water depth should\
    \ be considered to improve irrigation\nscheduling. Remote sensing techniques based\
    \ on the use of satellite images and unmanned aerial\nvehicles, or geostatistical\
    \ methods that require either detailed soil study and dense sampling or\nestimation\
    \ of soil moisture content from alternative low-cost techniques (e.g., electromagnetic\
    \ induction\nexploration techniques) are complementary tools for monitoring the\
    \ real application of irrigation water.\nWater 2020, 12, 785\n8 of 26\nThis permits\
    \ the visualization of the spatial variability of soil water content, splitting\
    \ the cropped area\ninto irrigation sectors with ad hoc irrigation programs [30,104,105].\n\
    • Data analysis and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI)\nThe modernization of many irrigation\
    \ networks involved not only the change of hydraulic\ninfrastructures, but also\
    \ the installation of telemetry devices, initially aimed at automating billing,\n\
    recording consumption at user level at certain intervals (big data collection)\
    \ [103].\nThe robustness of the current telemetry systems, most of which are based\
    \ on wireless communication,\nfacilitates database feeding with large amounts\
    \ of data. It is increasingly common today for farmers’\nassociations to record\
    \ detailed information on their users’ water consumption (hourly consumption)\n\
    throughout the irrigation campaign. These massive data sets (weather, crop, soil,\
    \ irrigation network\noperation and even markets data) require storage space (e.g.,\
    \ cloud storage) to be further processed by\nAI techniques. There are a wide variety\
    \ of AI techniques, such as artiﬁcial neural networks, fuzzy logic,\nor decision\
    \ trees, that can be applied separately or combined to improve the accuracy of\
    \ irrigation\nprogramming [98,102].\nConsumption data linked to water use features\
    \ at hydrant level (soil, critical periods of crop\ndevelopment, water allocation,\
    \ etc.), agroclimatic information provided by public and/or private\nweb platforms\
    \ and, when available, the knowledge of farmer’s behaviour (related, for example,\n\
    to their perception of weather conditions, national holidays and vacation periods)\
    \ allow accurate\npredictions of irrigation scheduling at farmer scale (when,\
    \ how much and for how long he/she\nirrigates) [106–108]. Accurate individual\
    \ irrigation schedules aggregated at irrigation district level\nprovide valuable\
    \ information for managers to optimize the use of water and energy.\n• Economy\
    \ and farmer’s behaviour\nThe costs of current irrigation scheduling systems (e.g.,\
    \ ICs, sensors, apps, web platforms,\netc.) are generally falling. However, for\
    \ moderate- to low-proﬁt crops, this technology may still be\ncost-prohibitive\
    \ if it doesn’t signiﬁcantly increase farmer income [61]. However, the production\
    \ of\nhigh value crops in areas with low water availability, such as greenhouse\
    \ crops in Southeast Spain, is\nhighly technological, particularly in irrigation\
    \ scheduling [109].\nMarket demands have a great inﬂuence on farmers, as the economic\
    \ factor is the main driver for\nimproving their irrigation management (including\
    \ technology). Markets, especially for fresh products,\ndemand products be obtained\
    \ sustainably. Water plays a crucial role in the concept of sustainability\napplied\
    \ to irrigated agricultural production. For growers, it is increasingly important\
    \ that their\nproducts are identiﬁed as sustainable through the corresponding\
    \ indicators and certiﬁcations, in order\nto maintain or even increase their market\
    \ price. For example, the use of the Water Footprint indicator\n(volume of water\
    \ used throughout the growing season divided by the production obtained) [110],\
    \ which\ncan be estimated by applying diﬀerent methodologies (waterfootprint.org,\
    \ ISO14046 standard [80,111]),\nencourages the use of optimal irrigation scheduling\
    \ systems to make eﬃcient use of water while\nmaintaining production levels.\n\
    3. Actual Cases of Application of Optimal Irrigation Programming\n3.1. Automatic\
    \ Irrigation Scheduling in Woody Crops\nThis study case focuses on the results\
    \ obtained in the implementation of an automated irrigation\nprotocol based on\
    \ water uptake estimated from soil water content data, measured by multi-capacitance\n\
    probes, on two early-maturing Prunus persica L. orchards growing in semi-arid\
    \ conditions in Southeast\nSpain. This area is subject to Mediterranean climate\
    \ where water resources are dwindling, and\nagriculture sector accounts for 80%\
    \ of all water withdrawals.\nUnder this scenario, most water\nuser associations\
    \ must deal with permanent water deﬁcits through the irrigation season. The water\n\
    application for high crop yield and quality must be carried out in such a way\
    \ as to be eﬃcient in relieving\nWater 2020, 12, 785\n9 of 26\nstress in the most\
    \ sensitive phenological phases by applying deﬁcit irrigation (DI) strategies\
    \ [112].\nDI requires the use of sensors for real time monitoring of the soil-plant-atmosphere\
    \ system [113].\nA controlled deﬁcit irrigated peach tree experiment and a full-irrigated\
    \ nectarine tree experiments\nare described in the following subsections. Both\
    \ studies aim to compare irrigation scheduling based on\nsoil water sensors with\
    \ an ETc-based treatment.\n3.1.1. Experimental Site and Plant Material\nThe experiments\
    \ were carried out at the CEBAS-CSIC experimental ﬁeld station in Santomera,\n\
    Murcia, Spain (38◦06′31” N, 1◦02′14” W, 110 m altitude) in two adjacent early-maturing\
    \ Prunus persica\n(L.) Batsch tree orchards: peach trees (cv. Flordastar) were\
    \ spaced 5 × 5 m, and nectarine trees\n(cv. Flariba) 6.5 m × 3.5 m, both trained\
    \ to an open-centre canopy. The soil in the 0–0.5 m layer was\nstony, highly calcareous\
    \ (45% calcium carbonate), with a clay loam texture (clay fraction: 41% Illite,\n\
    17% Smectite, and 30% Paligorskita). The average bulk density was 1.43 g cm−3.\
    \ The soil water content\nat ﬁeld capacity and wilting permanent point were 0.29\
    \ and 0.14 m3 m−3, respectively.\nThe average electrical conductivity (EC25ºC)\
    \ of the irrigation water was close to 1.3 dS m−1.\nThe irrigation system (97%\
    \ uniformity coeﬃcient) consisted of a single drip line per tree row with\npressure-compensated\
    \ emitters (8 × 2 Lh−1 and 4 × 4 Lh−1 per tree for peach and nectarine trees,\n\
    respectively) evenly distributed along the lateral.\nHarvesting took place in\
    \ the ﬁrst week of May. Other standard cultural practices such as winter\npruning\
    \ (during dormancy), thinning (March) and pest control were performed by experiment\
    \ station\npersonnel. More details on plant phenology can be found in [114].\n\
    Two treatments were considered: a control (conventional 100% ETc as ET0 × Kc computations,\
    \ [37],\nKc from [115] and an automated irrigation scheduling based on soil water\
    \ content values. These were\ndistributed in a completely randomized design with\
    \ four repetitions per irrigation treatment, each\nconsisting of one row of 13\
    \ trees (peach) and six trees (nectarine).\n3.1.2. Measurements\nAgrometeorological\
    \ data, including air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, global\nradiation,\
    \ precipitation, and ET0 (FAO56-Penman Monteith, [37]) were recorded by an automated\n\
    weather station located at the CEBAS-CSIC experimental ﬁeld station and integrated\
    \ in a web server\n(http://www.cebas.csic.es/general_spain/est_meteo.html). The\
    \ climate conditions registered were those\ntypical of Mediterranean areas, characterized\
    \ by high seasonality summarized as hot and dry summers\nand cool and wet winters\
    \ with high evaporative demand (ET0 ten-year average values of 1320 mm)\nand low\
    \ rainfall, normally below 250 mm.\nThe volumetric soil water content (VSWC) was\
    \ monitored with multi-depth capacitance FDR\n(Frequency Domain Reﬂectometry)\
    \ probes (EnviroSCAN) assembled with a PCB interface SDI-12.\nFour PVC access\
    \ tubes were installed 0.1 m to the emitter located close to the tree trunk in\
    \ four\nrepresentative trees, one of each replication. Each capacitance probe\
    \ had sensors ﬁtted to 0.1, 0.3, 0.5\nand 0.7 (nectarine), 0.8 (peach) m depth,\
    \ and were connected to a radio transmission unit, which read\nevery 5 min and\
    \ recorded the average value every 15 min. The sensors were previously normalized\
    \ on\nair and irrigation water and, subsequently, converted to VSWC using Sentek’s\
    \ default calibration for a\nclay-loam soil. Average VSWC values in the 0–0.5\
    \ m soil proﬁle were calculated, since they correspond\nto the maximum root density\
    \ area [116]. Volumetric counters were installed for each treatment and\ndrip\
    \ gauges were placed below the emitter, in the same place location as the capacitance\
    \ probe, to\nmonitor real time irrigation amount.\nProbes were connected to a\
    \ radio transmission unit network sending data to a gateway connected\nvia TCP/IP\
    \ to an AddVantage web server. In this server, a feedback condition was in charge\
    \ of triggering\nand closing electrovalves depending on mean ﬁeld values. Irrigation\
    \ alarms were also deﬁned to\nprevent water losses, and electrovalve failures.\n\
    Water 2020, 12, 785\n10 of 26\nTree water status was evaluated weekly from March\
    \ to October in one mature leaf per tree and\nreplications (n = 4), by measuring\
    \ midday stem water potential (Ψstem, MPa) using a pressure chamber\n(Soil Moisture\
    \ Equip. Corp. Model 3000). Net CO2 assimilation rate and stomatal conductance\
    \ were\nmeasured along the season with a portable gas exchange system (LI-COR,\
    \ LI-6400) for validating\nirrigation practices.\n3.1.3. Automated Irrigation\
    \ Criteria\nThe automated irrigation treatment was based on VSWC values in the\
    \ 0–0.5 m depth, thus soil\nsensors become practical biosensors of the root water\
    \ uptake. One deeper sensor would monitor the\nwetting front beyond the roots.\
    \ Integration of average VSWC values and the threshold values acted on\nelectro-valves\
    \ by the telemetry system.\nAs described by [117,118] in the peach orchard, the\
    \ ﬁrst approach consisted of monitoring the\nVSWC pattern in the peach orchard\
    \ throughout the season using conventional ETc values for irrigation.\nThis resulted\
    \ in over- and under-irrigation, indicating that better scheduling was needed.\
    \ In the second\napproach, irrigation was automatically managed by checking the\
    \ VSWC at 22:00 h, and irrigation only\nstarted if the SWC in the top 0.5 m layer\
    \ at this time was below 95% of ﬁeld capacity (FC) and stopped\nwhen the sensor\
    \ at 0.8 m depth showed an increase of 2% over its value recorded at 22:00 h.\
    \ This\nprocedure induced a “divergent pattern” on VSWC with a progressive decrease\
    \ in VSWC at 0.8 m,\nwith increasingly higher levels needed before reaching the\
    \ target.\nIn the third approach, real-time irrigation was managed according to\
    \ diﬀerent VSWC threshold\nvalues, as proposed by [119,120], based on the diﬀerent\
    \ sensitivities to water stress depending on the\nphenological stage of the tree\
    \ [121], with two periods: during fruit growth, when irrigation started at\n95%\
    \ FC and ended at FC, and during post-harvest, when irrigation started at 90 and\
    \ ended at 95% FC.\nSubsequently, the post-harvest period was divided into two:\
    \ early (mid-May to mid-July, with 90 and\n95% FC, for start and end of irrigation,\
    \ respectively) and late (from mid-July onwards, with 85 and 90%\nFC, respectively).\n\
    The fourth approach consisted of converting previous trigger/stopping criteria\
    \ into the universal\nmanagement allowed depletion (MAD) fraction, derived from\
    \ the original water availability\nconcept [122].\nFor stone fruit tress under\
    \ drip irrigation, the values α = 0.1 MAD during the\ncritical period (fruit growth\
    \ and early postharvest) and α = 0.3 MAD during late-postharvest were\napplied\
    \ (Figure 2). This approach was studied in a nectarine orchard (with a similar\
    \ phenology\ncalendar as in peach) with the aim of fulﬁlling plant water requirements\
    \ [123].\nWater 2020, 12, 785 \n10  of  25 \nirrigation only started if the SWC in the top 0.5 m layer at this time was below 95% of field capacity \n\
    (FC) and stopped when the sensor at 0.8 m depth showed an increase of 2% over its value recorded \n\
    at 22:00 h. This procedure induced a “divergent pattern” on VSWC with a progressive decrease in \n\
    VSWC at 0.8 m, with increasingly higher levels needed before reaching the target. \
    \  \nIn the third approach, real‐time irrigation was managed according to different VSWC threshold \n\

    95% FC and ended at FC, and during post‐harvest, when irrigation started at 90 and ended at 95% \n\

    \ (Figure 2), induced signiﬁcant increases\nin VSWC values at 0.7 m depth, possibly\
    \ causing some water losses through the plant root inﬂuence.\nHowever, VSWC at\
    \ a deeper soil proﬁle remained constant most of the time. Therefore, drainage\
    \ can\nbe assumed to be negligible under these conditions.\nVSWC-based treatment\
    \ induced moderate water deﬁcits in peach trees as indicated the lower Ψstem\n\
    values (up to −1.5 MPa) compared with the control trees (around −0.8 MPa) during\
    \ the postharvest\nperiod [117,120]. Ψstem values for nectarine trees remained\
    \ around −1 MPa in both treatments [123].\nAs many authors have proposed for deciduous\
    \ fruit trees [117,121,124–126], the post-harvest\nperiod is suitable for applying\
    \ regulated deﬁcit irrigation strategies because this stage is less sensitive\
    \ to\nsoil water deﬁcits than during fruiting. Interestingly, in the two studied\
    \ early-maturing Prunus cultivars,\npost-harvest is the longest period of the\
    \ growing season, accounting for 80% of the water requirements\nneeded for the\
    \ entire irrigation season [120], and is important because it is when carbohydrate\
    \ reserves\nare accumulated and the ﬂoral diﬀerentiation process occurs [127].\
    \ Accordingly, water deﬁcits should\nbe managed carefully in order to avoid severe\
    \ plant water deﬁcits that would reduce bloom and fruit\nload in the next season’s\
    \ harvest [117,120,121,125,126,128].\nOther studies have indicated that monitoring\
    \ the VSWC with capacitive FDR probes improved overall\nirrigation, providing\
    \ good calibration, installation, and data acquisition and interpretation [113,114,120,129].\n\
    Ref. [130] suggested pulsed irrigations based on MAD (maintained between 50 and\
    \ 15%) for\nautomated irrigation of watermelons; when the given set point was\
    \ detected, a 30 min irrigation cycle\nwas initiated followed by a 1h wait period.\
    \ Furthermore, [131] compared several irrigation scheduling\nalgorithms including,\
    \ among others, soil-based ones using granular matrix sensors and soil water\n\
    balance. They concluded that the latter seemed to be economical, easy to implement\
    \ and accurate for\nautomatic irrigation management of drip-irrigated apple trees.\n\
    Our ﬁndings indicated that irrigation scheduling based on precise VSWC threshold\
    \ values is a\nuseful tool for monitoring the soil water status, allowing automatic\
    \ and eﬃcient irrigation management.\nWhen probes are located at the maximum root\
    \ exploration volume and the thresholds were precisely\ndeﬁned, an adequate plant\
    \ water status was favoured, resulting in slight water deﬁcits limiting only\n\
    vegetative growth while maintaining high yields with prime quality. A peach yield\
    \ of 18.2 t ha−1\nwas obtained in the soil-based treatment, which was non-signiﬁcantly\
    \ diﬀerent in comparison with\n20.1 t ha−1 in the traditional scheduled trees,\
    \ allowing a 33% of water saving against an irrigation\napplication of 7000–7300\
    \ m3 ha−1) [117,120].\nIn addition, the real-time SWC values led to the automation\
    \ of irrigation without inducing water\nstress in nectarine trees, deriving irrigation\
    \ factors that in a practical, easy and precise manner, allowed\nprecision irrigationto\
    \ be managed [123]. Annual water requirements for early-maturing nectarine trees,\n\
    in the agro-climatic area of Region de Murcia (Southeast Spain), ﬁgured ≈ 6600\
    \ m3 ha−1, with irrigation\nfrequency varying from <1 to 7 days a week depending\
    \ on the phenological period. However, in this\nexperiment only 4500 m3 ha−1 were\
    \ applied, with around 30% of water savings as compared to control\ntrees irrigated\
    \ following traditional FAO-56 approach.\n3.2. Irrigation Scheduling in Arable\
    \ Crops\nAgriculture in Castilla-La Mancha (CLM) occupies an area of 3,773,029\
    \ ha, of which 557,851 ha\nare irrigated lands [132], mainly with sprinkler and\
    \ drip irrigation systems. The use of irrigation in\nthe area is the result of\
    \ low average annual precipitation (around 400 mm year−1) and high reference\n\
    Water 2020, 12, 785\n12 of 26\nevapotranspiration (>1100 mm year−1), characterizing\
    \ the area as semi-arid [133]. The most common\nirrigated crops are grapes, cereals,\
    \ garlic, onion, melon, watermelon, pepper, and others such as\nsunﬂower, potato,\
    \ and alfalfa.\nApproximately 70% of the irrigable area in CLM is located close\
    \ to groundwater sources (average\nelectrical conductivity EC = 0.8 dS m−1, which\
    \ is suitable for irrigation), given that most surface\nwater resources are used\
    \ in other bordering regions. In order to avoid the overexploitation of these\n\
    aquifers, farmers are restricted in the use of water by the water authority in\
    \ the area (“Confederación\nHidrográﬁca del Júcar” in the case of the Eastern\
    \ Mancha aquifer, and “Confederación Hidrográﬁca del\nGuadiana” in the case of\
    \ the Western Mancha and Campo de Montiel aquifers). Every year, the water\nauthority\
    \ determines the amount of water that each farmer can use, depending on the progression\
    \ of\nthe piezometric levels of the aquifers. Consequently, the total area irrigated\
    \ in the region varies each\nyear, as does the crop pattern, which is conditioned\
    \ by the evolution of the harvest prices. Moreover,\nthe increasing cost of energy\
    \ required for pumping groundwater and irrigating crops using pressurized\nirrigation\
    \ systems is another factor conditioning the use of water and the proﬁtability\
    \ of the irrigated\nfarms. Groundwater in the area is free, but farmers must pay\
    \ for the energy and the amortization of\nthe irrigation systems. Thus, the average\
    \ water cost in the area is around 0.12 € m−3 [134].\nLarge areas of rainfed land\
    \ were transformed into irrigated land during the 1970s and 1980s,\nwhereby the\
    \ average size of the holdings (rainfed and irrigated) is about 33 ha, which is\
    \ an appropriate\nsize for farm proﬁtability. However, only 8% of farmers are\
    \ younger than 40 years, and many of them\ncombine agriculture with other activities,\
    \ fostering the adoption of innovative methodologies and the\nmodernization of\
    \ their exploitations [135].\nAs a way to maximize the production proﬁtability\
    \ of irrigated crops in water scare regions such\nas CLM, the Regional Centre\
    \ of Water Research (CREA) of Castilla-La Mancha University (UCLM)\nhas developed\
    \ MOPECO (economic optimization model of irrigation water) [136–138]. The model\
    \ is\nbased on FAO-33 [139] and FAO-56 [38] methodologies, and has been calibrated\
    \ for diﬀerent annual\nextensive crops in several areas of the world [137,140–145].\
    \ MOPECO is designed to provide farmers\nwith a reliable and friendly on-line\
    \ tool for the proper management of farms and crops based on water\nproductivity\
    \ (WP).\n3.2.1. Optimal Distribution of Crops and Optimized Irrigation Scheduling\n\
    MOPECO’s main goal is to maximize the gross margin (GM) of irrigable lands dedicated\
    \ to the\ncultivation of annual crops through the eﬃcient use of irrigation water\
    \ and available irrigable area.\nA set of data (Figure 3) is required for the\
    \ simulation of the optimal “Yield vs. Total Net Water” (Y vs.\nTWN), function\
    \ of each crop under the climatic conditions of a certain year being TWN = net\
    \ irrigation\n(IN) + eﬀective rainfall (Pe). To obtain Y vs. TWN, the model simulates\
    \ a range of deﬁcit irrigation\nschedules using the optimized regulated deﬁcit\
    \ irrigation (ORDI) methodology [137], considering the\neﬀects of irrigation uniformity\
    \ [146] and electrical conductivity of water on yield [141].\nThe ORDI methodology\
    \ maximizes crop yield for a certain actual evapotranspiration value\n(ETa) versus\
    \ maximum evapotranspiration rate (ETm) objective for the whole crop growing period.\n\
    The methodology determines the value of the ETa/ETm ratio for the main Ky (crop\
    \ yield response factor\nby growing stage; [139]) stages deﬁned for each crop\
    \ (i.e., establishment and vegetative development,\nﬂowering, grain development\
    \ and ripening in the case of cereals). This combination of ETa/ETm\nrates maximizes\
    \ the crop yield according to the simulations carried out, using the equation\
    \ proposed\nby [147]. Consequently, this methodology allows the Y vs. TWN function\
    \ to be generated by simulating\nseveral irrigation schedules (the model determines\
    \ 100 points of the function, but the user may vary\nthis number).\nWater 2020,\
    \ 12, 785\n13 of 26\nWater 2020, 12, 785 \n13  of  25 \n \nGM vs. TWG functions show the maximum slope. These tangent lines define the “Pareto front” [149], \n\
    which represents the maximum GM possible for each irrigation depth supplied to the crop. On this \n\
    line, it is impossible to benefit one variable affecting the GM without damaging another. \n\
    Therefore, MOPECO uses historic economic and climatic data to provide farmers the most likely \n\
    crop distribution to maximize the profitability of their farms (Fig. 3).   \n\
     \n \nFigure 3. MOPECO flowchart. \nIn the optimal crop distribution, MOPECO usually assigns a volume of water to crops lower \n\
    than their full irrigation requirements for the climatic conditions of the typical meteorological year \n\
    (TMY) [144,148]. This is because maximum GM is generally reached by applying irrigation depths \n\
    lower than that required for the maximum yield (Fig. 3) due to the effect of irrigation uniformity, \n\
    water cost, and water crop productivity (WP), which usually increases with deficit irrigation [150]. \n\
    Moreover, under real conditions, future climatic data are unknown, and it is consequently impossible \n\
    to determine the optimal irrigation schedule at the beginning of the irrigation season. \n\
    To solve this question, [138] developed ORDI for limited volumes of irrigation water, which \n\
    modifies  the  ETa/ETm  objective  of  the  different  Ky  stages  in  several \
    \ consecutive  optimizations, \naccording to the progression of the real climatic conditions, the amount of irrigation water applied at \n\
    the end of each stage, and the volume available for the following ones. In order to maximize yield, \n\
    the methodology determines the deficit in terms of ETa/ETm to be applied to the crop at each Ky \n\
    stage and estimates the amount of irrigation water required to reach that level of deficit by using the \n\
    TMY climatic data and the MOPECO simulation model (1st optimization). Thus, during the first Ky \n\
    stage, the objective is to apply the irrigation schedule that reaches the ETa/ETm objective determined \n\
    by the methodology for that stage under real management conditions. At the end of the first stage, \n\
    the ETa/ETm reached by the crop (estimated by MOPECO) should be similar to the target (in the first \n\
    stage there is sufficient irrigation water) or higher (if the climatic conditions and/or the soil water \n\
    availability do not allow that level of deficit to be generated). However, the amount of irrigation \n\
    water applied to the crop will likely be different to that forecast by the model. Consequently, after \n\
    the first Ky stage, the methodology determines new ETa/ETm targets for the following Ky stages, \n\

    \ MOPECO ﬂowchart.\nIn order to decrease the number of simulations for determining\
    \ the crop irrigation requirements\nunder local climatic conditions, the typical\
    \ meteorological year (TMY) [148] was adapted by [144] for\nirrigation scheduling.\
    \ A TMY consists of 12 months selected from individual years and concatenated\n\
    to form a complete year with daily unmodiﬁed values (maximum and minimum temperature,\
    \ ETo and\nrainfall) which show a perfect interrelationship. In order to consider\
    \ several scenarios of irrigation\nwater requirements, dry, intermediate, and\
    \ wet TMYs were considered [145].\nThe Y vs. TWN function is translated into “Yield\
    \ vs. Total Gross Water” (Y vs. TWG), where TWG\n= gross irrigation (IG) + Pe,\
    \ to include the application eﬃciency of the irrigation system. The Gross\nMargin\
    \ (GM) vs. TWG function is then calculated using crop economic data. Finally,\
    \ the model\ncalculates the optimal crop distribution and the amount of water\
    \ assigned to each crop that fulﬁls\nthe restrictions imposed by the user (selected\
    \ crops, total irrigable area, and total available volume\nof irrigation water)\
    \ for certain climatic conditions through the direct solution algorithm developed\n\
    by [136]. This algorithm calculates the reference points where the tangent lines\
    \ that connect each pair of\nGM vs. TWG functions show the maximum slope. These\
    \ tangent lines deﬁne the “Pareto front” [149],\nwhich represents the maximum\
    \ GM possible for each irrigation depth supplied to the crop. On this\nline, it\
    \ is impossible to beneﬁt one variable aﬀecting the GM without damaging another.\n\
    Therefore, MOPECO uses historic economic and climatic data to provide farmers\
    \ the most likely\ncrop distribution to maximize the proﬁtability of their farms\
    \ (Figure 3).\nIn the optimal crop distribution, MOPECO usually assigns a volume\
    \ of water to crops lower\nthan their full irrigation requirements for the climatic\
    \ conditions of the typical meteorological year\n(TMY) [144,148]. This is because\
    \ maximum GM is generally reached by applying irrigation depths\nlower than that\
    \ required for the maximum yield (Figure 3) due to the eﬀect of irrigation uniformity,\n\
    water cost, and water crop productivity (WP), which usually increases with deﬁcit\
    \ irrigation [150].\nMoreover, under real conditions, future climatic data are\
    \ unknown, and it is consequently impossible\nto determine the optimal irrigation\
    \ schedule at the beginning of the irrigation season.\nTo solve this question,\
    \ [138] developed ORDI for limited volumes of irrigation water, which\nmodiﬁes\
    \ the ETa/ETm objective of the diﬀerent Ky stages in several consecutive optimizations,\n\
    Water 2020, 12, 785\n14 of 26\naccording to the progression of the real climatic\
    \ conditions, the amount of irrigation water applied at\nthe end of each stage,\
    \ and the volume available for the following ones. In order to maximize yield,\n\
    the methodology determines the deﬁcit in terms of ETa/ETm to be applied to the\
    \ crop at each Ky\nstage and estimates the amount of irrigation water required\
    \ to reach that level of deﬁcit by using the\nTMY climatic data and the MOPECO\
    \ simulation model (1st optimization). Thus, during the ﬁrst Ky\nstage, the objective\
    \ is to apply the irrigation schedule that reaches the ETa/ETm objective determined\n\
    by the methodology for that stage under real management conditions. At the end\
    \ of the ﬁrst stage,\nthe ETa/ETm reached by the crop (estimated by MOPECO) should\
    \ be similar to the target (in the ﬁrst\nstage there is suﬃcient irrigation water)\
    \ or higher (if the climatic conditions and/or the soil water\navailability do\
    \ not allow that level of deﬁcit to be generated). However, the amount of irrigation\
    \ water\napplied to the crop will likely be diﬀerent to that forecast by the model.\
    \ Consequently, after the ﬁrst\nKy stage, the methodology determines new ETa/ETm\
    \ targets for the following Ky stages, taking into\naccount the actual remaining\
    \ irrigation water (2nd optimization). The same methodology is followed\nat the\
    \ end of each Ky stage. During the optimizations, a certain amount of irrigation\
    \ water is saved\nfor the last stage (that determined in the 2nd optimization)\
    \ in order to avoid the total depletion of\nirrigation water during previous Ky\
    \ stage. This methodology has been successfully applied under real\nmanagement\
    \ conditions in barley and garlic, as explained below.\n3.2.2. Applications\n\
    In order to validate MOPECO and assess its applicability, the following experiments\
    \ were\nconducted in commercial farms under diﬀerent water availability scenarios\
    \ [134,151–154].\nThe time and volume of water supplied to each experiment were\
    \ determined by MOPECO and\nchecked by soil moisture sensors or gravimetric samples.\n\
    Maize\nThe eﬀect of irrigation uniformity on maize (Zea Mays L.) yield and proﬁtability\
    \ was evaluated\nin 2016 in Albacete (Spain), in two adjacent sectors equipped\
    \ with a solid set sprinkler irrigation\nsystem [153]. The ﬁeld was managed according\
    \ to FAO-56 methodology throughout the growing\nseason to maximize grain yield\
    \ without water stress (Sector S1, considering 50% adequacy) or irrigation\nscheduling\
    \ determined by an experienced producer (Sector S2). Irrigation uniformity was\
    \ evaluated\nusing catch cans in both ﬁelds and grain yield was harvested within\
    \ zones exhibiting 75% (Z1), 100%\n(Z2), and 125% (Z3) of area-averaged volume\
    \ applications throughout the year. The average coeﬃcient\nof uniformity (CU)\
    \ in both sectors (S1 and S2) was 83.5%, and the net volume of applied irrigation\n\
    water totalled 709 mm in S1 and 832 mm in S2. Irrigation Water productivity (WP)\
    \ was higher in S1\n(2.20 kg m−3) than in S2 (2.05 kg m−3), highlighting the beneﬁts\
    \ of an accurate irrigation schedule on the\neﬃcient use of water. Nevertheless,\
    \ average grain yield in sector S2 approached the maximum expected\nyield of 18.4\
    \ Mg ha−1 and exhibited no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in yield among zones. In contrast,\n\
    sector S1 exhibited signiﬁcant yield diﬀerences (p < 0.05) across zones with a\
    \ measured yield in Z3\nof 18.5 Mg ha−1 and a yield reduction of 1.6 Mg ha−1 and\
    \ 4.0 Mg ha−1 in Z2 and Z1, respectively.\nConsequently, the area-averaged yield\
    \ in S1 was 8% lower than in S2. This last treatment was positively\ninﬂuenced\
    \ by a higher amount of irrigation water supplied to the crop (17%), which decreased\
    \ the\neﬀect of low CU (83.5%). Because of these yield diﬀerences and the relatively\
    \ low cost of irrigation\nwater (0.07 € m−3), area averaged gross margin in S1\
    \ was 18% lower compared with S2, discouraging\nan eﬃcient use of water by the\
    \ farmer. On the other hand, the grain yields simulated by MOPECO for\neach monitoring\
    \ zone within the sectors exhibited similar magnitude and trends. Simulations\
    \ with\nMOPECO over a range of CU showed that improved irrigation uniformity increased\
    \ area-averaged\nyields and gross margin when following the S1 instead of S2 strategy.\
    \ In other words, eﬃcient use of\nirrigation water through accurate irrigation\
    \ scheduling and/or the use of regulated deﬁcit irrigation\ntechniques requires\
    \ advanced management and maintenance of the irrigation systems.\nWater 2020,\
    \ 12, 785\n15 of 26\nPurple garlic\nA two years (2015-2016) “Morado de Las Pedroñeras”\
    \ purple garlic ﬁeld experiment was conducted\nin Albacete (Spain) [151]. The\
    \ evaluated volumes of irrigation water were: no deﬁcit “ND”; and four\nvolumes\
    \ of available irrigation water: 100% “T100”, 90% “T90”, 80% “T80”, and 70% “T70”\
    \ of the net\nirrigation requirements (In = 3400 m3 ha−1 = T100) for the climatic\
    \ conditions of the intermediate TMY).\nORDI treatments reached high yields (between\
    \ 10,055 kg ha−1 of treatment ND and 8260 kg ha−1 of\nT70), also improving the\
    \ productivity of the irrigation water (up to 7.7 kg m−3 with T70). Consequently,\n\
    the blue water footprint (irrigation water) of purple garlic decreased from 0.287\
    \ m3 kg−1 of ND\ntreatment to 0.173 m3 kg−1 of T70. The ND treatment achieved\
    \ the best combination between yield\nand bulb calibre with high commercial value\
    \ in both seasons. In 2015, the deﬁcit treatments reached a\nsimilar distribution\
    \ of calibres than that of the ND. However, the unfavourable climatic conditions\n\
    of 2016 aﬀected the distribution of calibres of ORDI treatments, shifting to calibres\
    \ with lower price.\nThus, the average proﬁtability of the ND treatment was around\
    \ 9800 € ha−1 vs. 6000 € ha−1 of T70.\nReaching the same total production of garlic\
    \ in the productive area of purple garlic in CLM by using\nthe T70 strategy instead\
    \ of ND, it would be possible to reduce the irrigation requirements by around\n\
    37% with reductions in percolation due to better use of rainfall water. Nevertheless,\
    \ the bulbs would\nbe smaller, decreasing the price of the harvests and aﬀecting\
    \ the ﬁnal proﬁtability of the farms. This\nwould be higher in wet years due to\
    \ a larger area of the farm being cultivated with lower stressed\ngarlic. In contrast,\
    \ in dry years like 2016, proﬁtability would decrease notably aﬀecting the proﬁtability\n\
    of the farms. This may diminish the interest in this methodology in a highly proﬁtable\
    \ crop such as\ngarlic, which requires high investment for its cultivation.\n\
    Barley\nThis experiment was similar to the previous one and was conducted during\
    \ 2015, 2016 and 2017\nseasons in Albacete (Spain) [154]. Five irrigation water\
    \ volumes (one with no deﬁcit “ND”, and four\nlimited volumes of available irrigation\
    \ water, corresponding to 100% “T100”, 90% “T90”, 80% “T80”,\nand 70% of IN =\
    \ 2500 m3ha−1) were evaluated. As an average, ORDI achieved higher yields for\
    \ the\nwater received (between 9040 kg ha−1 of the ND treatment and 6339 kg ha−1\
    \ of the T70), enhancing\nirrigation water productivity (from 2.75 kg m−3 of the\
    \ ND up to 3.64 kg m−3 of the T80). Accordingly,\nthe barley blue water footprint\
    \ was reduced, evolving from 0.360 m3 kg−1 of the ND to 0.275 m3 kg−1\nof the\
    \ T80. All the treatments fulﬁlled the quality requirements demanded by the malt\
    \ industry, which\nwere not aﬀected by the ORDI strategy. As expected, the average\
    \ proﬁtability of ND treatment in the\narea (average 281.84 € ha−1) was higher\
    \ than the others (average 260.63 € ha−1 for T80). Nevertheless,\nthe application\
    \ of the T80 methodology in all the barley area cultivated in the Eastern CLM\
    \ region\ninstead of ND during the three experimental years would involve a 30.1%\
    \ reduction in irrigation water\nand a 13.3% increase in water productivity. This\
    \ water saving (38.3 hm3 in three years) could be used\nto replenish the Eastern\
    \ CLM aquifer (at risk of over exploitation), reducing the pumping energy costs\n\
    and improving the ecosystems depending on the aquifer, and/or to supply water\
    \ to more proﬁtable\ncrops in the area improving the economy of the region.\n\
    Barley, Maize and Onion\nThis experiment was conducted in2014 and 2015 in Albacete\
    \ (Spain) [134]. The objective was to\ncompare the proﬁtability of a 240 ha irrigated\
    \ commercial farm considering two irrigation strategies.\nThe traditional strategy\
    \ (T) consisted of applying full irrigation (F treatments) to a distribution of\n\
    crops (barley, maize and onion), considering several volumes of irrigation water\
    \ (from 2000 up to\n8000 m3 ha−1, varying the total area dedicated to each crop\
    \ by using the direct solution algorithm\nobtained by MOPECO) and four market\
    \ price scenarios considering a water cost of 0.12 € m−3.\nDepending on the availability\
    \ of irrigation water, the MOPECO strategy (M) consisted of applying to the\n\
    same crops full irrigation or the combinations of water deficit per growing stage\
    \ determined by ORDI\nWater 2020, 12, 785\n16 of 26\nmethodology (O treatments).\
    \ The optimal global deficits were: 30% ETm for barley (ETa/ETm = 0.7), 10%\n\
    ETm for maize (ETa/ETm = 0.9), and 10% ETm for onion (ETa/ETm = 0.9). For low\
    \ availabilities of\nirrigation water (between 2000 and 5000 m3 ha−1), the M strategy\
    \ achieved a proﬁtability up to 8.2%\nhigher than T in the most favourable scenario,\
    \ but the average for all the scenarios was around 2.8%,\nwhich was much lower\
    \ than expected (8.0%) according to the simulations carried out by MOPECO\nusing\
    \ historic climatic and economic data. Despite the lower increase in proﬁtability,\
    \ in all the cases,\nthe WP of the ORDI treatments was higher (average 12.4% for\
    \ barley; 3.6% for maize; and 1.4% for\nonion). The causes of these results were\
    \ the drought conditions of the two experimental years during\nspring time that\
    \ increased the amount of water required by barley, the unfavourable climatic\
    \ conditions\nduring 2015 for onion and maize that decreased their yields and\
    \ the price progression during both\nseasons (close to unproﬁtable values for\
    \ onion in the ﬁrst year). Thus, barley, a priori, the crop which\ncould yield\
    \ a water saving (because of its low proﬁtability) required more water than forecast\
    \ and\ndecreased the availability of water for the other two crops. This work\
    \ brought to light the necessity of\nmodifying ORDI, resulting in the development\
    \ of ORDI for limited volumes of water [138]. For higher\navailabilities of irrigation\
    \ water (between 5000 and 8000 m3 ha−1), the results of F and O scenarios\nwere\
    \ similar since there was suﬃcient water for avoiding deﬁcit irrigation.\n4. Discussion\n\
    The above study cases described the response of a wide range of crops to two diﬀerent\
    \ irrigation\nscheduling approaches under semi-arid conditions: one based on real\
    \ time SWC measurements and\nthe other based on simulation models.\nThe automatic\
    \ irrigation system (AIS) eﬃciently processed and sent the user real-time ﬁeld\
    \ data\n(SWC, applied irrigation volume, and weather data). It also activated/deactivated\
    \ the electrovalves\nthat control the beginning and end of irrigation events.\
    \ To this end, the AIS eﬀectively combined the\ninformation collected by a wireless\
    \ sensor (WS) network with climate information available through a\nweb platform\
    \ to actuate the electrovalves using ICT technologies. Likewise, all recorded\
    \ data were\nstored in the cloud, being accessible anywhere/anytime for advisory\
    \ services to farmers.\nAIS can be adapted to diﬀerent crops. In this work, it\
    \ was implemented in woody crops (peach\nand nectarine). A deﬁcit irrigation strategy\
    \ was applied, achieving savings of around 30% in water,\nenergy and labour costs\
    \ compared to the conventional irrigation system.\nIt should be considered that\
    \ the implementation of AIS in commercial farms involves the study of\nthe spatial\
    \ variability of the soil properties before the installation of the soil water\
    \ sensors in order to\nselect the monitoring point or points. A minimum of three\
    \ probes is required to adequately represent\nthe wet bulb. Hence, robust and\
    \ cheap sensors for soil, plant, and atmosphere measurements are\nneeded to promote\
    \ the adoption of AIS in farms.\nRegarding weather variables, real time and forecasted\
    \ weather information provided by public\nand private weather services could be\
    \ integrated in the irrigation schedule (rainfall time, intensity,\nETo) to improve\
    \ its accuracy [155,156].\nSensor, hardware and software providers are currently\
    \ involved in a process to enable the design\nof customized AIS based on SCADA\
    \ or other middleware [155] to process inputs and operate irrigation\nnetworks\
    \ in real time. Additionally, APPs implemented on hand-pocket smart devices will\
    \ provide\ndecision makers with an easy access to real-time data [62,156].\nLikewise,\
    \ the WS networks, as well as the other technological components of AIS, require\n\
    supervision and maintenance and a minimum level of knowledge for their handling\
    \ and interpretation\nof the data. If the user does not have such knowledge, he/she\
    \ should use technical advisory services.\nThe investment in the AIS (from 3000\
    \ €, investment + operation) and the need for knowledge are the\nmain limiting\
    \ factor for commercial application of AIS. These deterrents have also been highlighted\
    \ in\nother studies carried out in Australia, USA or European countries, such\
    \ as Italy and Portugal [61,157–159].\nIn these analyses, authors state that farmers\
    \ tend to maintain traditional agricultural practices and are\nusually reluctant\
    \ to adopt new technologies [157]. In addition, the maintenance costs required\
    \ is also\nWater 2020, 12, 785\n17 of 26\na limiting factor for the incorporation\
    \ of these new technologies [157]. Hence, knowledge exchange\nbetween researchers,\
    \ farmers and other stakeholders is recommended to encourage the technological\n\
    development and automation of irrigated agriculture [61].If this approach is properly\
    \ transferred\nto the irrigation community, it will be a great step forward in\
    \ the eﬃcient use of water in irrigated\nagriculture. Thus, in regions with permanent\
    \ water scarcity and high-value crops (e.g., Mediterranean\nenvironments), AIS\
    \ can be worthwhile by underpinning highly proﬁtable production with lower water\n\
    endowments than traditional systems.\nFurthermore, models like MOPECO are the\
    \ core of decision support systems (DSS) that strengthen\nfarmers’ ability to\
    \ preserve their proﬁtability under low water availability conditions. MOPECO\n\
    provides valuable information to improve crops distributions before planting and\
    \ optimize irrigation\nscheduling in order to maximize water productivity. Additionally,\
    \ at the level of water resource\nmanagers, it is also an adequate tool to analyse\
    \ the eﬀects of water policies on the agricultural sector.\nMOPECO highlights\
    \ the importance of suitable management of irrigation water through proper\nmaintenance\
    \ and use of the irrigation system, as well as determining the most suitable irrigation\n\
    scheduling. In addition, under limited water availability conditions, MOPECO reduces\
    \ water allocation\nfor lower proﬁtable crops (i.e., barley) and reallocates them\
    \ to more proﬁtable crops.\nFarmers sometimes solve the lack of uniformity of\
    \ their irrigation systems by supplying larger\namounts of irrigation water than\
    \ that required by crops. This strategy is evidently not justiﬁable from\nan environmental\
    \ point of view, especially in areas where water is scarce. However, if water\
    \ cost is low\nand/or the water authority does not oﬀer any incentives to save\
    \ water, farmers may use this strategy\nbecause it is easier than evaluating their\
    \ irrigation system.\nIn addition to the lack of uniformity, irrigation schedules\
    \ must be overestimated considering\nevaporation and drift losses in order to\
    \ provide farmers with realistic values but avoiding percolation\nat least in\
    \ mostof the ﬁeld. These questions are even more signiﬁcant when proposing farmers\
    \ apply\nregulated deﬁcit irrigation methodologies in annual crops.\nMOPECO increases\
    \ crop WP as a way to increase the proﬁtability of farms by using the ORDI\nmethodology.\
    \ The drop in yield per unit of area is compensated for by a larger irrigated\
    \ area with a\nhigher WP, using the same amount of water within the farm. Consequently,\
    \ ORDI does not decrease\nthe amount of water used but increases the yield per\
    \ unit of water volume supplied to the crop.\nThis evidence has also been shown\
    \ in previous works carried out in Australia, Spain, Morocco, and\nthe Middle\
    \ East. In these studies, adopting eﬃcient irrigation systems has led to higher\
    \ water use\neﬃciencies but this water conservation has been used to expand the\
    \ irrigated area or to change to more\nproﬁtable crops [157–161].\nNevertheless,\
    \ the eﬀect of ORDI on the quality parameters of certain crops, such as horticultural\n\
    ones, must be analysed before advising farmers to use it. Thus, in crops such\
    \ as garlic or onion,\nORDI increased WP but the decrease in the size of bulbs\
    \ reduced their proﬁtability per unit of yield,\nquestioning the suitability of\
    \ this methodology in this type of crops. Moreover, the increase in the\ncultivated\
    \ area generates higher costs that must also be considered, although the cost\
    \ per unit of area\nis lower (lower amount of water, fertilizers, harvest costs,\
    \ etc.). Consequently, an economic analysis\nvalidated under real cropping conditions\
    \ is required in these cases.\nORDI can be useful for farms where the amount of\
    \ irrigation water is limited. The application of\nORDI in garlic and barley under\
    \ real management conditions showed an increase in WP, a reduced\nwater footprint\
    \ and a clear increase in the proﬁtability of farms and barley cropping areas\
    \ (and probably\nother cereals or low proﬁtable crops). Transferring this methodology\
    \ to the productive sector involves\nadapting these kinds of tools to the skills\
    \ and necessities of farmers and technicians.\nApplying models such as MOPECO\
    \ requires calibration and validation processes before use,\nas well as the availability\
    \ of local climatic data (public or private) and the installation of irrigation\n\
    control devices (ﬂow meters and soil moisture sensors), the number of which may\
    \ vary depending\non the total ﬁeld area and its soil uniformity, using at least\
    \ one monitoring point at two depths in\nthe most representative area of the ﬁeld\
    \ i.e., at the location of the major roots depth concentration\nWater 2020, 12,\
    \ 785\n18 of 26\nand at maximum root depth for controlling percolation. All these\
    \ aspects entail costs for both the\npublic administration and farmers themselves\
    \ (individuals or associations), which maybe unaﬀordable\nfor certain farms. Thus,\
    \ in addition to developingthe tools and training the farmers and technicians,\n\
    the total cost of the system is around 4650 € + taxes + installation.\nTherefore,\
    \ the positive results of the advanced technologies presented (AIS and DSS) are\
    \ not\nwithout cost. They require investment in equipment, and expenditure on\
    \ operation and maintenance,\nas well as qualiﬁed technical and maintenance services.\
    \ Likewise, they need robust sensors, as well as\nthe availability of advanced\
    \ support services. In the case that such conditions are accomplished, these\n\
    technologies will only be able to provide value to farms with low water availability,\
    \ high proﬁtability,\nand substantial technical-economic capacity.\nBoth irrigation\
    \ programming approaches (AIS and DSS) are adequate tools to use irrigation water\n\
    eﬃciently only if they are properly implemented in high uniformity irrigation\
    \ networks. In irrigation\nsystems with no accurate hydraulic design and poor\
    \ maintenance (e.g., emitter clogging) water will\nnever be used eﬃciently no\
    \ matter how good the available irrigation management tools are.\n5. Conclusions\n\
    This work reviews the main variables aﬀecting optimal irrigation scheduling and\
    \ their\ninterrelationships. Two approaches to irrigation scheduling conducted\
    \ in semi-arid areas of Southeast\nSpain are presented: one based on real time\
    \ crop monitoring applied to woody crops at the farm scale\nand the other, for\
    \ arable crops, applicable at the regional, irrigation district, and farm scales,\
    \ based on\nwater management models.\nThe analysis of both evaluated case studies\
    \ shows that computer support and ICTs, availability\nof meteorological information\
    \ and crop data during the growing season, sensors, and irrigation\nprogrammers\
    \ among other elements are required to provide optimal irrigation scheduling solutions\n\
    and improved resource allocation under water scarcity conditions. Additionally,\
    \ to succeed in the\nadoption of these new water management technologies, well\
    \ designed and maintained hydraulic\nfacilities are needed.\nThis implies investment\
    \ and maintenance costs, which could make them\nunsuitable for low proﬁtability\
    \ farms.\nIn addition, adopting these approaches requires from the users technical\
    \ training and willingness\nto accept irrigation schedules based not only on personal\
    \ experience but also on data-driven\ndecision-making processes. Hence, irrigation\
    \ advisory services (public or private) can play a key role\nin driving this technology\
    \ change in the irrigation sector. More robust and cheaper sensors would also\n\
    contribute in this way.\nTherefore, to date, the return of these technologies\
    \ is worth the investments and costs required to use\nthem in the case of farms\
    \ with low water availability, high proﬁtability, and relevant technical-economic\n\
    capacity.\nSociety, as an end beneﬁciary, may also play a key role in this technological\
    \ change.\nThe demand for sustainable crops is closely linked to optimal irrigation\
    \ scheduling, which could raise\nthe price of agricultural products and thus tip\
    \ the balance in favour of the implementation of ICTs in\nirrigated agriculture.\n\

    \ three\nexperiments consisting of four treatments were used to evaluate model\
    \ performance in simulating\ncanopy cover (CC), biomass (B), yield (Y), crop evapotranspiration\
    \ (ETc), and water use efﬁciency\n(WUE). Statistics for root mean square error,\
    \ model efﬁciency (E), and index of agreement for B and\nCC suggest that the model\
    \ prediction is good under non-stressed and moderate stress environments.\nPrediction\
    \ of ﬁnal B and Y under these conditions was acceptable, as indicated by the high\
    \ coefﬁcient\nof determination and deviations <10%. In severely stressed conditions,\
    \ low E and deviations >11% for\nB and 9% for Y indicate a reduction in the model\
    \ reliability. Simulated ETc and WUE deviation from\nobserved values were within\
    \ the range of 9.5% to 22.2% and 6.0% to 32.2%, respectively, suggesting\nthat\
    \ AquaCrop prediction of these variables is fair, becoming unsatisfactory as plant\

    \ should be kept in mind when interpreting\nthe results in severely stressed conditions.\n\

    \ Introduction\nPopulation growth, land use change, climate change, and increasing\
    \ demand in non-agricultural\nsectors profoundly affect the availability and quality\
    \ of water resources for irrigated agriculture.\nAmid increasing concerns that\
    \ water scarcity and food security are among the main problems to\nbe faced by\
    \ many societies in the 21st century, a global challenge for the agricultural\
    \ sector is to\nproduce more food with less water [1]. Irrigation strategies focusing\
    \ on increasing agricultural water\nproductivity, such as deﬁcit irrigation (DI)\
    \ coupled with crop simulation modeling to investigate\nmultiple alternatives,\
    \ have a pivotal role to play in sustainable water development.\nExtensive research\
    \ and publications highlight the contribution DI management strategy makes\nin\
    \ combating water waste in irrigation. By providing less than the exact crop water\
    \ requirements,\nspeciﬁcally during drought-tolerant growth stages, crop yields\
    \ can be stabilized and maximum water\nuse efﬁciency (WUE) attained [2]. Judicious\
    \ planning is therefore required as supplying crops with less\nthan their water\
    \ requirement can signiﬁcantly affect crop growth and development, inevitably\
    \ affecting\nyield, especially if water stress occurs during the susceptible growth\
    \ stage. DI is a ﬂexible management\nWater 2016, 8, 557; doi:10.3390/w8120557\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/water\nWater 2016, 8, 557\n2 of 18\nstrategy and its successful\
    \ implementation is dependent on a sound irrigation schedule, in terms of\nboth\
    \ timing and application amount. Therefore, there exist numerous possibilities\
    \ when investigating\nand imposing a DI management plan. Some of these include\
    \ growth-stage-speciﬁc DI, intermittent DI\n(irrigation is applied on speciﬁc\
    \ days), and root zone soil moisture depletion. In each case, different\nwater\
    \ amounts can be applied. Owing to their cost and time effectiveness, crop simulation\
    \ models are\nideally suited for the evaluation of irrigation strategies where\
    \ there are various alternatives.\nThe FAO AquaCrop simulation model provides\
    \ a sound theoretical framework to investigate crop\nyield response to environmental\
    \ stress [3]. This model has successfully simulated crop growth and\nyield as\
    \ inﬂuenced by varying soil moisture environments for crops like sunﬂower [4],\
    \ bambara\ngroundnut [5], and winter wheat [6].\nFarahani et al. [3] and Geerts\
    \ et al. [7] suggest that this\nmodel maintains a good balance between robustness\
    \ and accuracy, and a noteworthy feature of\nthe model compared to other cereal\
    \ crop growth models is the simplicity it offers its users; it does\nnot require\
    \ advanced skill for its calibration or operation and does not require a large\
    \ number of\ninput parameters [8]. The relatively small number of input data describes\
    \ the soil–crop–atmosphere\nenvironment in which the crop develops, most of which\
    \ can be derived by simple methods. AquaCrop\nsimulates crop growth and yield\
    \ based on the water-driven growth model that relies on the\nconservative behavior\
    \ of biomass per unit transpiration relationship [4,9]. This fundamental principle\n\
    contributed to the simplistic structure of the model, having a greater applicability\
    \ in space and time,\nas the model features “conservative input parameters” that\
    \ transcend geographical location and\ncultivar [9,10]. Raes et al. [11] noted\
    \ that these conservative parameters require no adjustment to the\nlocalized environments,\
    \ favorable or limiting conditions, as their modulation is triggered by stress\n\
    response functions.\nAquaCrop yield response model has been applied to a wide\
    \ range of crops including maize.\nHeng et al. [8] and Hsiao et al. [12] reported\
    \ that AquaCrop simulated maize development, grain yield,\nand water variables\
    \ such as the crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and WUE, to name a few, reasonably\n\
    well in cases of non-limiting conditions. Still, some studies report that model\
    \ performance declines in\nestimating some variables in severe water stress environments\
    \ [1,13]. Although a highlighted feature\nof the model is the applicability of\
    \ conservative parameters used in crop simulations (these parameters\nare reported\
    \ by Heng et al. [8] and Hsiao et al. [12] for maize), several researchers observed\
    \ that model\nparameterization is essentially site-speciﬁc and that important\
    \ calibrated parameters necessary for\naccurate simulation must be tested under\
    \ different climate, soil, cultivars, irrigation methods, and ﬁeld\nmanagement\
    \ to improve the reliability of the simulated results [3,14,15].\nOwing to the\
    \ diversiﬁcation of its uses, maize is a cereal crop that signiﬁcantly contributes\n\
    to a country’s self-sufﬁciency. Taiwan has recorded a considerable decrease in\
    \ maize production\nand now relies heavily on imports from the international market\
    \ to meet demand [16]; the average\ncultivated area of maize in Taiwan is approximately\
    \ 18,000 ha/year (2005–2009 estimate) from about\n90,000 ha/year in 1980–1990\
    \ [17]. Amid a water-intensive rice industry (Taiwan’s main crop), the\nsuccessful\
    \ revival and planned expansion of maize production requires sustainable water\
    \ management\nstrategies, especially considering that dry spells are a characteristic\
    \ feature of the main cropping\nseason. The availability of a model adapted to\
    \ local conditions should have a strong impact on planned\nexpansions and would\
    \ aid in assessing competing management alternatives and possible constraints.\n\
    Integrating crop models that simulate the effects of water on crop yield with\
    \ targeted experimentation\ncan facilitate the development of irrigation strategies\
    \ for high yield procurement and improving farm\nlevel water management and WUE.\n\
    The objectives of this research were two-fold: (1) To analyze the performance\
    \ of AquaCrop for\nmaize under full and deﬁcit irrigation in the tropical environment\
    \ of Southern Taiwan; and (2) to test\nand validate the effectiveness of the calibrated\
    \ model in simulating biomass yield and grain yield\nunder contrasting environmental\
    \ conditions.\nWater 2016, 8, 557\n3 of 18\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Field\
    \ Experiments\n2.1.1. Site Characteristics and Management Practices\nField experiments\
    \ were conducted at the irrigation experimental site of National Pingtung\nUniversity\
    \ of Science and Technology, Southern Taiwan (22.65◦ N: 34.95◦ E: 71 m above sea\
    \ level)\nfor three cropping seasons. The climate of the study area is classiﬁed\
    \ as tropical wet and dry with\nextreme spatial and temporal rainfall distribution.\
    \ Two experiments were conducted during the main\ngrowing period running from\
    \ November to March for 2014 to 2015 (Experiment 1) and 2015 to 2016\n(Experiment\
    \ 3). Another experiment was conducted during the summer season running from April\
    \ to\nJuly of 2015 (Experiment 2). Utilizing the model for two distinct cropping\
    \ seasons allows for better\ntesting and evaluation of its effectiveness given\
    \ the extreme spatial and temporal rainfall distribution\nof the study location.\
    \ The late cropping season (November to March), one of the main cropping periods\n\
    for maize, coincides with the cooler winter season and is characterized by warm\
    \ dry spells and lack of\nrainfall. The other cropping season (April to July)\
    \ coincides with the hot and humid summer months\nand typhoon season, which is\
    \ characterized by intense and or long rainfall events that often lead to\nextensive\
    \ damage to crops.\nWeather data, including daily values of air temperature, humidity,\
    \ wind speed (at 2 m height),\nsolar radiation, and precipitation, were collected\
    \ from an on-site agro-meteorological station. The two\nexperiments occurring\
    \ during the main growing months (November to March) had similar air\ntemperature\
    \ environments, with a seasonal mean of approximately 20 ◦C. During these periods,\n\
    the mean daily maximum temperature ranged from 11 to 32 ◦C, while the mean daily\
    \ minimum\ntemperature ranged from 5 to 22 ◦C. On the other hand, the mean maximum\
    \ temperature for\nExperiment 2 was consistently over 32 ◦C, with a seasonal mean\
    \ of 28.7 ◦C. There was substantial\ndifference in rainfall between the seasons.\
    \ During Experiments 1 and 3 a total rainfall of 40 mm\nand 213.5 mm was recorded,\
    \ respectively. The rainfall during Experiment 3 was atypical to that\nobserved\
    \ at the location; total long-term (15 years) rainfall during the cropping period\
    \ averages\n65.4 mm. In contrast, the total rainfall recorded during Experiment\
    \ 2 was 890.5 mm, most of which was\nconcentrated in two major events (Figure\
    \ 1). The uneven distribution of rainfall affected the irrigation\napplication\
    \ (subsequently discussed). Cumulative reference evapotranspiration (ETo), calculated\
    \ via\nthe FAO Penman–Monteith method as described in Allen et al. [18], was 286.3,\

    29.1\n2.1.2. Irrigation Treatments\nThe experiments for all seasons consisted\
    \ of four irrigation treatments, replicated three times,\narranged in a completely\
    \ randomized block design. The treatment variation was based only on the\namount\
    \ of irrigated water applied, irrespective of the corn phenological growth stage.\
    \ The rationale\nfor this was to maintain a consistent irrigation schedule based\
    \ on soil moisture content. It was\nhypothesized that this would vary the severity\
    \ of the water stress levels. The four irrigation levels\nincluded a full irrigation\
    \ treatment (FIT) and three deﬁcit treatments corresponding to 67%, 50%, and\n\
    33% of water applied in the FIT. Irrigation depth was determined based on the\
    \ concept of maximum\nallowable depletion of total available soil water (TAW)\
    \ in the soil proﬁle [19]. Using Equation (1) [19],\nthe water applied to the\
    \ FIT at each irrigation event was 60 mm. Subsequently, irrigation levels assigned\n\
    to deﬁcit treatments 67% FIT, 50% FIT, and 33% FIT was 40, 30, and 20 mm of water,\
    \ respectively.\nVd = AD (%) (FC − WP) RzA\n100\n,\n(1)\nwhere Vd is the volume\
    \ of irrigation water (m3), AD is the allowed depletion (40%) [20], FC is the\n\
    ﬁeld capacity (m3·m−3), WP is the permanent wilting point (m3·m−3), Rz is the\
    \ effective rooting depth\n(1 m), and A is the surface area of the plot (m2).\
    \ During early vegetative growth (VE to end of V5),\nall treatments received approximately\
    \ 60–75 mm of water to establish plants and promote robust\nroot development.\
    \ Treatment management of irrigation water application thus began from the V6\n\
    growth stage, and it is here that the distinction was made in terms of 67%, 50%,\
    \ and 33% FIT water\napplied. Given the temporal distribution of rainfall, the\
    \ number of irrigation events in each season\nvaried (Figure 1). There were a\
    \ total of eight, four, and ﬁve irrigation events in Experiments 1, 2, and 3,\n\
    respectively. Total water applied, which is equal to the sum of the initial amounts\
    \ of water applied\nfor plant establishment and the amount under the treatment\
    \ management, to the different treatments\nin each season is presented in Table\
    \ 2. Flood irrigation by the use of carefully constructed water\npipes and water\
    \ meters was used to administer the required water depth to each treatment. Irrigation\n\
    was initiated for all treatments whenever the soil moisture in the FIT was depleted\
    \ by 40%. That is,\nin the deﬁcit-irrigated treatments irrigation occurred on\
    \ the same day as the fully irrigated plots,\nbut the duration of irrigation applications\
    \ were reduced to 67%, 50%, and 33% of the full irrigation.\nThe 40% depletion\
    \ criterion used for irrigation scheduling was determined by constantly monitoring\n\
    Water 2016, 8, 557\n5 of 18\nthe soil water status. The percentage depletion of\
    \ available soil water in the effective root zone was\nestimated as follows [21]:\n\
    depletion (%) = 100 × 1\nn ∑\nn\n1\nFCi − θi\nFCi − WP,\n(2)\nwhere n is the number\
    \ of sub-divisions of the effective rooting depth used in the soil moisture sampling,\n\
    FCi is the soil moisture at ﬁeld capacity for ith layer, θi is the soil moisture\
    \ in ith layer, and WP is the soil\nmoisture at permanent wilting point. θ was\
    \ monitored daily using soil moisture sensors, EnviroScan\nsystem (Sentek Technologies,\
    \ Stepney, Australia), connected to an automatic datalogger. Sensors were\ninstalled\
    \ in between two plants on the same row through Sentek customized polyvinyl chloride\
    \ (PVC)\naccess tubes in two replicates per treatment. Daily soil water in the\
    \ root zone was computed as the\naverage of all 10-min interval readings for that\
    \ day for the respective soil proﬁle depths.\nTable 2. Timeline of main phenological\

    \ Measurements\nThe main phenological growth stages in days after planting (DAP)\
    \ are presented in Table 2.\nTo assess crop development, leaf area index (LAI)\
    \ and total aboveground biomass were monitored\nthroughout the cropping season.\
    \ During Experiment 1, data was collected at regular three-week\nintervals from\
    \ sowing to harvest, while collection was done approximately every two weeks during\n\
    Experiment 3. For Experiment 2, extreme weather conditions resulted in severe\
    \ damage to some\nplants and data collection of seasonal evolution of biomass\
    \ and LAI had to be abandoned. To evaluate\nbiomass accumulation, four plants\
    \ per plot were randomly selected, clipped at the soil surface, then\noven dried\
    \ at 70 ◦C until constant weight was attained. At harvest, ﬁnal grain yield and\
    \ total oven-dry\nbiomass per treatment were measured. Eight randomly selected\
    \ plants per plot were tagged to monitor\nLAI throughout the growing season. The\
    \ LAI was calculated as the product of the manually measured\nleaf area (maximal\
    \ length x width) of each leaf, by the shape factor (k = 0.75) for maize, by the\
    \ plant\ndensity [22]. LAI was converted to green canopy cover (CC) using Equation\
    \ (3) [8,12]:\nCC = 1.005 [1 − exp (−0.6 LAI)]1.2.\n(3)\nThe actual crop evapotranspiration\
    \ (ETc) of each treatment was calculated using the soil water\nbalance method:\n\
    ETc = P + I − D − R ± ∆W,\n(4)\nwhere P is the rainfall (mm), I is the irrigation\
    \ (mm), D is the downward drainage out of the root\nzone (mm), R is the surface\
    \ runoff (mm), and ∆W is the change in the soil water content (SWC) (mm).\nWater\
    \ 2016, 8, 557\n6 of 18\nR was assumed to be zero because irrigation water application\
    \ was controlled and the experimental\nplots were enclosed by 1 m wide levees\
    \ around the perimeter with basins meticulously prepared to\nbe level. In Experiments\
    \ 1 and 3, the SWC in the root zone was recorded using EnviroScan probes\nthroughout\
    \ the season from 0 to 1 m depth with 0.1 m intervals, and 1 to 1.6 m depth at\
    \ 0.2 m intervals.\nThe latter was used to observe drainage, as the effective\
    \ root zone considered was 1 m. However,\nduring Experiment 2 all SWC was measured\
    \ on a weekly basis gravimetrically. Here, the SWC was\nmonitored at 0.10-m intervals\
    \ to a depth of 1 m and at 0.20 m intervals from 1 to 2 m soil proﬁle depth.\n\
    Field initial SWC (Table 1) was measured at sowing gravimetrically to ensure the\
    \ accuracy of the\nsensors and for AquaCrop model input data.\n2.3. Description\
    \ of AquaCrop Simulation Model\n2.3.1. Model Background\nThe AquaCrop model evolved\
    \ from the Doorenbos and Kassam [23] Ky approach of modeling\nyield response to\
    \ water. As outlined in Steduto et al. [9] and Raes et al. [11], there are two\
    \ fundamental\nprinciples that separate this water-driven “growth engine” from\
    \ its predecessor and other cropping\nmodels.\nFirst, the model simulates the\
    \ separation of actual ET into soil evaporation and crop\ntranspiration, thereby\
    \ avoiding the confounding effect of the non-productive consumptive use of water.\n\
    In addition, another distinguishing attribute of AquaCrop is that it uses green\
    \ CC to express foliage\ndevelopment instead of LAI. The CC and ETo are then used\
    \ with the crop coefﬁcient for transpiration\nto calculate transpiration for non-stress\
    \ conditions, and with the soil evaporation coefﬁcient to calculate\nsoil evaporation\
    \ each day [8]. Secondly, the model simulates the separation of yield into biomass\
    \ and\nharvest index (HI). Crop yield is simulated as the product of biomass and\
    \ HI. In AquaCrop, HI is\nidentiﬁed as a conservative parameter, although the\
    \ default value can be changed for a speciﬁc species\nor location. Additionally,\
    \ HI is continuously adjusted in AquaCrop during yield formation in response\n\
    to water and/or temperature stresses. AquaCrop estimates daily biomass production\
    \ as follows:\nBi = WP∗ ∑\n\x12 Tri\nEToi\n\x13\n,\n(5)\nwhere Bi is the daily\
    \ aboveground biomass, Tri is the daily crop transpiration, EToi is the daily\n\
    reference evapotranspiration, and WP* is the water productivity of the crop species\
    \ normalized for\nboth evaporative demand and atmospheric CO2. The normalization\
    \ of WP for climate makes AquaCrop\napplicable to diverse locations and seasons,\
    \ including future climate scenarios [5].\nIn addition to crop growth, development,\
    \ and yield production, AquaCrop simulates changes\nin the amount of water stored\
    \ in the root zone by performing a daily water balance that includes\nall the\
    \ incoming and outgoing water ﬂuxes (inﬁltration, runoff, deep percolation, evaporation,\
    \ and\ntranspiration). In the model, there are four water stress response coefﬁcients,\
    \ which are functions\nof the fractional depletion of the total available water\
    \ in the root zone used to express the effects\nof water deﬁcit on the crop. The\
    \ four coefﬁcients are for leaf growth/canopy expansion, stomatal\nconductance,\
    \ canopy senescence, and pollination failure/HI, each with its own threshold depletion\n\
    level and response curves.\n2.3.2. Parameters and Input Data\nAs in other crop\
    \ models, AquaCrop consists of a soil–crop–atmosphere continuum. The climate\n\
    component requires daily weather data on maximum and minimum air temperature,\
    \ rainfall, ETo,\nand CO2 concentration. These data were collected from an agro-meteorological\
    \ station located at the\nexperimental site. Daily ETo was calculated using the\
    \ FAO Penman–Monteith equation.\nThe soil proﬁle ﬁle requires basic soil characteristics\
    \ such as volumetric water content at saturation,\nﬁeld capacity, permanent wilting\
    \ point, and saturated hydraulic conductivity of the different soil\nproﬁle depths.\
    \ These parameters were obtained in accordance with standard international procedures.\n\
    Water 2016, 8, 557\n7 of 18\nGroundwater effects through capillary action were\
    \ not simulated as the groundwater table is well\nbelow the effective root zone\
    \ (typically >7 m).\nData required for the initial conditions ﬁle in\nAquaCrop\
    \ was measured at the start of each experiment (Table 1). The input data also\
    \ include\ninformation relating to the irrigation and ﬁeld management. In general,\
    \ these input parameters are\nlocation- and management-speciﬁc, and the necessary\
    \ data were entered into the model as practiced in\nthe ﬁeld experiments.\nThe\
    \ crop input component of AquaCrop contains both user-speciﬁc and conservative\
    \ parameters,\nwhich can be categorized into crop parameters, phenology, development,\
    \ and water stress groups.\nSome of the user-speciﬁc parameters include plant\
    \ density, emergence time, canopy senescence\nand maturity time, ﬂowering period\
    \ and yield formation duration, rooting depth, and reference HI\n(may also be\
    \ conservative). To name a few, some of the conservative crop parameters include\
    \ soil\nwater extraction pattern; canopy growth, given as a percentage of canopy\
    \ cover; WP* for biomass; crop\ncoefﬁcient for transpiration at full canopy; and\
    \ water stress response coefﬁcients for canopy expansion,\nstomatal closure, and\
    \ early canopy senescence. Given one of the experimental periods was during\n\
    the rainy season when water logging is common, aeration stress was considered\
    \ in the simulation.\nLack of aeration in the root zone resulting from soil water\
    \ content being above the anaerobiosis point\nis associated with a decrease in\
    \ crop transpiration [11].\n2.4. Model Calibration and Validation\nAssessment\
    \ of the performance and robustness of AquaCrop model under varying water\nenvironments\
    \ and crop water stress levels was achieved by comparing the simulated canopy\n\
    development, biomass accumulation, grain yield, ETc, and WUE of maize against\
    \ ﬁeld measurements.\nAll the simulations were limited to the conditions of no\
    \ nutrient and salinity stress in AquaCrop (v. 5.0).\nAs ﬁeld measurements were\
    \ taken more intensively during Experiment 3 which was conducted from\nNovember\
    \ 2015 to March 2016), these data were used for the model calibration.\nAs a ﬁrst\
    \ step, the calibration procedure involved comparing observed and simulated CC\
    \ under\nfull irrigation. Then the calibrations were based on comparisons between\
    \ simulated and observed\nbiomass and grain yield at harvest. Finally, the process\
    \ involved the comparison of simulated and\nobserved values for biomass and grain\
    \ yield for the deﬁcit irrigated treatments. In general, measured\ncrop growth\
    \ variables, observed phenological stages, and conservative parameters for maize\
    \ [8,12] was\nused in this testing phase. The procedure was an iterative process\
    \ of adjusting sensitive parameters,\nmainly non-conservative parameters, in AquaCrop\
    \ and assessing both the absolute and relative\ndifference. For each change in\
    \ input, simulations were run using the calibrated crop ﬁle and the\ncorresponding\
    \ irrigation ﬁle. Geerts et al. [7] and Salemi et al. [24] report on the most\
    \ sensitive\nparameters in AquaCrop obtained through sensitivity analysis testing.\
    \ As the experimental site was\nmeticulously prepared to prevent runoff, this\
    \ ﬁeld management option was selected in the model.\nConsidering the calibrated\
    \ crop parameters, plant density, and other crop growth data observed\nin the\
    \ ﬁeld, validations were executed. Data from Experiments 1 and 2 were used for\
    \ validating the\nmodel. Validation of the model in simulating the seasonal evolution\
    \ of CC and biomass accumulation\nwas only possible for the November 2014 to March\
    \ 2015 (Experiment 1) season. For each of the\nsimulation runs, weather data,\
    \ soil characteristics, irrigation applications, phenological stages, and\nsowing\
    \ density were entered as observed.\n2.5. Model Evaluation\nTo evaluate the goodness\
    \ of ﬁt between AquaCrop simulation results and observed CC, biomass,\nyield,\
    \ ETc, and WUE (grain yield per unit total water used), four statistical variables\
    \ were used: the\ncoefﬁcient of determination (R2), the Root Mean Squared Error\
    \ (RMSE, Equation (6)), the model\nefﬁciency (E, Equation (7)) [25], and Willmott’s\
    \ Index of Agreement (d, Equation (8)) [26].\nWater 2016, 8, 557\n8 of 18\nRMSE\

    \ values, respectively, n is the number of observations,\nand M is the mean of\
    \ n measured values.\nThe RMSE represents a measure of the overall or mean deviation\
    \ between observed and simulated\nvalues. According to Heng et al. [8], it is\
    \ a synthetic indicator of the absolute model uncertainty.\nRMSE has the same\
    \ unit as that of the variable being simulated, therefore the closer the value\
    \ is to zero\nthe better the model simulation performance.\nThe E is a measure\
    \ of the mean square to the observed variance. That is, it expresses how much\n\
    the overall deviation between observed and simulated values departs from the overall\
    \ deviation\nbetween observed values (Mi) and their mean value (M). This parameter\
    \ captures how well the model\nperforms over the whole simulation span, unlike\
    \ the RMSE [8]. In other words, while RMSE does not\ndistinguish between large\
    \ deviations occurring in some parts of the season and small deviations in\nother\
    \ parts of the season, E accounts for the different deviations along the entire\
    \ season and expresses\nthe efﬁciency of the model performance. Values of E range\
    \ between 1 and −∞, with better model\nsimulation efﬁciency when values are closer\
    \ to 1.\nThe index of agreement, d, is a measure of relative error in model estimates.\
    \ Zeleke et al. [27]\nnote that while E is an index of predictive performance,\
    \ d indicates the degree to which predicted and\nmeasured values show similar\
    \ deviation from the measured mean. It is a dimensionless quantity and\nranges\
    \ from 0 to 1, where 0 describes complete disagreement and 1 indicates perfect\
    \ model agreement.\nAdditional model performance evaluations were performed as\
    \ percentage deviations between the\nmeasured and simulated ﬁnal biomass and grain\
    \ yield. Model performance was also evaluated by\nusing R2, which indicates the\
    \ strength of the relationship between the variables.\n3. Results\n3.1. Calibration\n\
    The main parameters used to calibrate AquaCrop model for simulating maize growth\
    \ and\nproductivity for the study location are presented in Table 3 along with\
    \ the default values contained in\nthe AquaCrop ﬁles. Calibration was completed\
    \ using the data collected during the 2015/2016 cropping\nseason (Experiment 3).\
    \ The HI used in the model (52%) was higher than the proposed 48% [8,12]\nbecause\
    \ of the high yielding maize variety.\nTable 3. AquaCrop default values and calibrated\

    \ season is presented in Figure 2. In general, the\nmodel predicted the seasonal\
    \ trend in CC well. However, the model tended to underestimate CC during\nearly\
    \ vegetative growth. This prediction of a slower crop establishment was more pronounced\
    \ in\ndeﬁcit treatments, and for these treatments the model also underestimated\
    \ the maximum CC observed\nin the ﬁeld. The accuracy of the calibrated model in\
    \ simulating CC development was conﬁrmed by\nstatistical values (Table 4). For\
    \ the FIT and 67% FIT high E values were obtained, while the moderate\nE values\
    \ of 0.77 and 0.59 for deﬁcit treatment 50% FIT and 33% FIT indicate that the\
    \ model performance\ndeclined in circumstances of water stress. However, high\
    \ d and low RMSE for all treatments indicate\nthat the model is robust in simulating\
    \ canopy development in different water environments. For the\ncalibration dataset,\
    \ a strong 1:1 correlation between simulated and measured values was observed\n\
    with an overall R2 = 0.94. Table 4 presents the R2 value obtained from the 1:1\
    \ correlation analysis of\nsimulated CC against measured CC for individual treatments.\n\

    \ CC used for validating AquaCrop simulation of maize grown in\ndifferent soil\
    \ moisture environments are presented in Figure 5. It can be observed that AquaCrop\
    \ was\nable to accurately simulate the canopy development and senescence over\
    \ the season for the FIT and\n67% FIT. However, AquaCrop slightly underestimated\
    \ the canopy development during the ﬁrst few\nweeks, during early vegetative growth,\
    \ and this mismatch was more obvious in deﬁcit treatments\n50% FIT and 33% FIT\
    \ owing to the water stress incurred. In addition, the maximum CC in the 33% FIT\n\
    was underestimated. The goodness of ﬁt between measured and simulated CC is reﬂected\
    \ in the\nstatistical parameters shown on Figure 5. The high values of E and d\
    \ for the FIT and 67% FIT indicate\nthe overall good agreement between the simulated\
    \ and measured CC. The 50% FIT recorded a high d\nvalue of 0.92 but a moderate\
    \ efﬁciency value of 0.66. The more severely stressed 33% FIT recorded\na model\
    \ efﬁciency value of 0.65, indicating that the model performance is fair in severely\
    \ stressed\nmoisture conditions.\nWater 2016, 8, 557 \n12 of 18 \n \n3.2.1. Canopy Cover \n\

    different soil moisture environments are presented in Figure 5. It can be observed that AquaCrop \n\
    was able to accurately simulate the canopy development and senescence over the season for the FIT \n\
    and 67% FIT. However, AquaCrop slightly underestimated the canopy development during the first \n\
    few  weeks,  during  early  vegetative  growth,  and  this  mismatch  was  more \
    \ obvious  in  deficit \ntreatments 50% FIT and 33% FIT owing to the water stress incurred. In addition, the maximum CC in \n\
    the  33%  FIT  was  underestimated.  The  goodness  of  fit  between  measured \
    \ and  simulated  CC  is \nreflected in the statistical parameters shown on Figure 5. The high values of E and d for the FIT and \n\
    67% FIT indicate the overall good agreement between the simulated and measured CC. The 50% FIT \n\
    recorded a high d value of 0.92 but a moderate efficiency value of 0.66. The more severely stressed \n\
    33% FIT recorded a model efficiency value of 0.65, indicating that the model performance is fair in \n\
    severely stressed moisture conditions. \n \nFigure 5. Simulated and measured canopy cover for the four irrigation treatments in Experiment 1 \n\

    prediction to validate calibrated crop parameters for field grown maize (Figure 6). It can be observed \n\
    that with the exception of the 33% FIT there is generally a good fit between the datasets. The model \n\
    tended to overpredict final biomass, except for the underprediction in the severely stressed 33% FIT. \n\
    Table  5  presents  values  of  the  simulated  final  biomass  compared  to \
    \ field  observations.  The \ncomparison of the final biomass shows that the majority (6 out of 8) has a deviation of less than 10%. \n\
    For Experiment 1 the deviation was within range of 7.7% and 15.4%, while the deviation between \n\
    observed and simulated biomass during Experiment 2 was lower with a range of 4% to 11.2%. For \n\
    this latter season, the deviation is perhaps lower because the crop experienced less stress during this \n\
    growing period owing to the abundant rainfall (Figure 1). Furthermore, it can be observed that the \n\
    difference  in  accumulated  biomass  among  treatments  for  this  growing  period \
    \ was  smaller  in \ncomparison to other growing periods (Table 5). This can be attributed to the more frequent rain \n\
    events creating a better soil moisture environment. \nFigure 5. Simulated and\
    \ measured canopy cover for the four irrigation treatments in Experiment 1\nused\

    \ during Experiment 1 was compared with AquaCrop seasonal\nprediction to validate\
    \ calibrated crop parameters for ﬁeld grown maize (Figure 6).\nIt can be\nobserved\
    \ that with the exception of the 33% FIT there is generally a good ﬁt between\
    \ the datasets.\nThe model tended to overpredict ﬁnal biomass, except for the\
    \ underprediction in the severely stressed\n33% FIT. Table 5 presents values of\
    \ the simulated ﬁnal biomass compared to ﬁeld observations.\nThe comparison of\
    \ the ﬁnal biomass shows that the majority (6 out of 8) has a deviation of less\n\
    than 10%. For Experiment 1 the deviation was within range of 7.7% and 15.4%, while\
    \ the deviation\nbetween observed and simulated biomass during Experiment 2 was\
    \ lower with a range of 4% to\n11.2%. For this latter season, the deviation is\
    \ perhaps lower because the crop experienced less stress\nduring this growing\
    \ period owing to the abundant rainfall (Figure 1). Furthermore, it can be observed\n\
    that the difference in accumulated biomass among treatments for this growing period\
    \ was smaller in\nWater 2016, 8, 557\n13 of 18\ncomparison to other growing periods\
    \ (Table 5). This can be attributed to the more frequent rain events\ncreating\
    \ a better soil moisture environment.\nWater 2016, 8, 557 \n13 of 18 \n \n \n\

    to other growing periods. This can be attributed to the heavy rainfall events during the flowering \n\
    and grain filling growth stages, which temporarily relieved soil moisture stress. Maize grain yield \n\
    reduction  mainly  occurs  when  stress  is  experienced  during  the  reproductive \
    \ growth  stage. \nSimulated  yields  being  within  5%  for  most  treatments \

    \ of  AquaCrop  in  predicting  maize  grain  yield  in  varying  water \nenvironments. \
    \ In  both  cropping  seasons,  simulated  yields’  deviation  from  observed \
    \ yield  was \ngreater than 9% for the 33% FIT, indicating that model accuracy declines in circumstances of severely \n\
    stressed water environments. Similar observations were discussed by Evett and Tolk [28]. The strong \n\
    1:1 correlation observed between simulated and measured values (R2 = 0.93; Ysimulated = 1.07 × \n\
    Ymeasured − 0.68) using the validation dataset verifies the high accuracy of the calibrated model in \n\
    predicting  final  grain  yield  (Figure  4).  Figure  4  shows  that  the  values \
    \ of  simulated  yield  versus \nmeasured yield were relatively close to the 1:1 line. \n\
    3.2.3. Crop Evapotranspiration and Water Use Efficiency \nThe differences in the seasonal ETc between the simulation results and measurements observed \n\
    from the field experiment for the different irrigation treatments are presented in Table 6. AquaCrop \n\
    consistently underestimated the seasonal ET and the deviations generally increased as soil water \n\
    deficit increased. The deviations ranged from 6.47% to 22.16% for the three experiments. Although \n\
    the linear regression between simulated and observed values for all seasons produced an overall R2 \n\
    value of 0.97, the values were relatively dispersed from the 1:1 line (Figure 7), suggesting that model \n\
    prediction of ETc is fair. Owing to some significant mismatch between simulated and observed ETc \n\
    values,  the  deviation  between  actual  and  simulated  WUE  of  grain  yield \
    \ was  large  for  most \ntreatments (Table 6). Results indicated no general consensus of the deviations in WUE values being a \n\
    function of the level of plant water stress. However, measured WUE was seemingly better in the 67% \n\
    FIT, indicating a potential for water saving given yields for this treatment were comparable to those \n\
    obtained in the FIT (Table 5). A relatively higher grain yield and biomass was obtained from crops \n\
    planted in April (Experiment 2), therefore the yield WUE was higher for this cropping period. \n\

    \ 0.7 t·ha−1, respectively (Table 5). Similar to the biomass\nmeasurements, the\
    \ difference in yield among treatments for Experiment 2 was small in comparison\n\
    to other growing periods. This can be attributed to the heavy rainfall events\
    \ during the ﬂowering\nand grain ﬁlling growth stages, which temporarily relieved\
    \ soil moisture stress. Maize grain yield\nreduction mainly occurs when stress\
    \ is experienced during the reproductive growth stage. Simulated\nyields being\
    \ within 5% for most treatments (6 out of the 8 cases) is indicative of the robustness\n\
    and accuracy of AquaCrop in predicting maize grain yield in varying water environments.\
    \ In both\ncropping seasons, simulated yields’ deviation from observed yield was\
    \ greater than 9% for the 33% FIT,\nindicating that model accuracy declines in\
    \ circumstances of severely stressed water environments.\nSimilar observations\
    \ were discussed by Evett and Tolk [28]. The strong 1:1 correlation observed\n\
    between simulated and measured values (R2 = 0.93; Ysimulated = 1.07 × Ymeasured\
    \ − 0.68) using\nthe validation dataset veriﬁes the high accuracy of the calibrated\
    \ model in predicting ﬁnal grain yield\n(Figure 4). Figure 4 shows that the values\
    \ of simulated yield versus measured yield were relatively\nclose to the 1:1 line.\n\
    3.2.3. Crop Evapotranspiration and Water Use Efﬁciency\nThe differences in the\
    \ seasonal ETc between the simulation results and measurements observed\nfrom\
    \ the ﬁeld experiment for the different irrigation treatments are presented in\
    \ Table 6. AquaCrop\nconsistently underestimated the seasonal ET and the deviations\
    \ generally increased as soil water deﬁcit\nincreased. The deviations ranged from\
    \ 6.47% to 22.16% for the three experiments. Although the linear\nregression between\
    \ simulated and observed values for all seasons produced an overall R2 value of\n\
    0.97, the values were relatively dispersed from the 1:1 line (Figure 7), suggesting\
    \ that model prediction\nof ETc is fair. Owing to some signiﬁcant mismatch between\
    \ simulated and observed ETc values, the\ndeviation between actual and simulated\
    \ WUE of grain yield was large for most treatments (Table 6).\nResults indicated\
    \ no general consensus of the deviations in WUE values being a function of the\
    \ level\nof plant water stress. However, measured WUE was seemingly better in\
    \ the 67% FIT, indicating a\npotential for water saving given yields for this\
    \ treatment were comparable to those obtained in the\nFIT (Table 5). A relatively\
    \ higher grain yield and biomass was obtained from crops planted in April\n(Experiment\

    \ noteworthy  feature  of  the  FAO  AquaCrop  model  is  the  use  of  proposed \
    \ “conservative \nparameters”. That is, a set of nearly constant parameters that do not change materially with time and \n\
    management practices, are presumably applicable to widely different environmental conditions and \n\
    climate, and are not specific to a given crop cultivar [11]. In this study, an iterative process was used \n\
    to test the conservative parameters proposed by Heng et al. [8] and Hsiao et al. [12] for maize. In \n\
    general, these parameters worked well in simulating crop growth, as evidenced by the unchanged \n\
    values  given  in  Table  3.  However,  in  the  severely  stressed  treatment \
    \ (33%  FIT)  there  was  some \nmismatch  between  the  model  prediction  and \
    \ the  observed  values  of  daily  B  and  CC,  perhaps \nindicating  that  a \
    \ change  of  these  values,  specifically  stress  threshold  values,  would \
    \ improve  the \nmodel  simulation.  Since  the  aim  of  the  model  calibration \
    \ was  to  test  for  values  that  can  work \nadequately under all conditions, the proposed values were maintained for use in predicting crop \n\
    development and productivity as they worked well in non‐stressed and moderately stressed conditions. \n\
    Statistical indicators of RMSE, E, and d observed during the calibration process confirm this (Table 4). \n\
    During the validation exercise it was observed that the performance of the AquaCrop depends on the \n\
    water stress level experienced by the plants during the crop cycle and the output variable. \n\
    Figure 7. Comparison between measured and simulated seasonal evapotranspiration\
    \ (ETc) for all\ntreatments over the three experimental (Exp.) periods.\n4. Discussion\n\
    One noteworthy feature of the FAO AquaCrop model is the use of proposed “conservative\n\
    parameters”. That is, a set of nearly constant parameters that do not change materially\
    \ with time and\nmanagement practices, are presumably applicable to widely different\
    \ environmental conditions and\nclimate, and are not speciﬁc to a given crop cultivar\
    \ [11]. In this study, an iterative process was used to\ntest the conservative\
    \ parameters proposed by Heng et al. [8] and Hsiao et al. [12] for maize. In general,\n\
    these parameters worked well in simulating crop growth, as evidenced by the unchanged\
    \ values given\nin Table 3. However, in the severely stressed treatment (33% FIT)\
    \ there was some mismatch between\nthe model prediction and the observed values\
    \ of daily B and CC, perhaps indicating that a change\nof these values, speciﬁcally\
    \ stress threshold values, would improve the model simulation. Since the\naim\
    \ of the model calibration was to test for values that can work adequately under\
    \ all conditions, the\nproposed values were maintained for use in predicting crop\
    \ development and productivity as they\nworked well in non-stressed and moderately\
    \ stressed conditions. Statistical indicators of RMSE, E, and\nd observed during\
    \ the calibration process conﬁrm this (Table 4). During the validation exercise\
    \ it was\nWater 2016, 8, 557\n15 of 18\nobserved that the performance of the AquaCrop\
    \ depends on the water stress level experienced by the\nplants during the crop\
    \ cycle and the output variable.\nDuring the validation test, the seasonal evolution\
    \ of CC was underestimated while the biomass\nwas generally overestimated, except\
    \ for the severely stressed treatment (33% FIT), where it was\nunderestimated.\
    \ Furthermore, the deviation between observed and simulated daily CC and biomass\n\
    was more pronounced under water deﬁcit conditions, becoming more intense as stress\
    \ levels increased.\nThe larger deviation between observed and simulated CC under\
    \ water deﬁcit and stress environments\nhas also been reported for other crops\
    \ like potatoes [15].\nThe general tendency of AquaCrop\nsimulation model to overestimate\
    \ maize biomass under water deﬁcit conditions has been reported by\nHeng et al.\
    \ [8], who contribute the deviation to vegetative stress and suggest that this\
    \ can be attributed\nto the actual stomatal conductance being less than that simulated.\
    \ Under the more severely stressed\ntreatment of 33% FIT (Figure 6), the model\
    \ underestimated the biomass through the whole season,\nwhich suggests that the\
    \ model was not able to simulate the temporary relief from soil moisture stress\n\
    due to irrigation application, unlike the other deﬁcit treatments. For the other\
    \ water deﬁcit treatments\nof 67% FIT and 50% FIT, there was an initial underestimation\
    \ of biomass up to about 60 DAP before\noverestimation. Observations made regarding\
    \ a general whole-season underestimation of biomass for\nthe more severely stressed\
    \ treatment (33% FIT) was analogous to that reported by Katerji et al. [13] for\n\
    maize and by Jin et al. [29] for winter wheat.\nSimulated grain yields from Experiment\
    \ 1 and 2 used in the validation exercise reduced on\naverage by 19% for 67% FIT,\
    \ 25% for 50% FIT, and 37% for 33% FIT with respect to the yield simulated\nunder\
    \ full irrigation. In comparison, measured yield reduction from the FIT was 11%,\
    \ 21%, and 33%\nfor 67% FIT, 50% FIT, and 33% FIT, respectively. The range of\
    \ yield reduction for both measured\nand simulated data is similar to those reported\
    \ by Katerji et al. [13] and García-Vila and Fereres [30].\nThese results imply\
    \ that AquaCrop adequately predicts grain yield under varying environmental\n\
    conditions, although the accuracy of the model declines in severely stressed conditions,\
    \ conﬁrming\nconclusions drawn from the two previously mentioned research. Furthermore,\
    \ Katerji et al. [13]\nobserved that in cases of severe moisture stress (based\
    \ on a pre-dawn leaf water potential of −1.2 MPa),\nAquaCrop is unable to predict\
    \ corn grain yield. Higher ﬁnal biomass and grain yield were observed\nfor maize\
    \ sown in April (Experiment 2, Table 2). Two factors can account for this. First,\
    \ for this season\nthe soil moisture environment was better, reducing the length\
    \ of the soil drought cycle on account\nof the rainfall. Rainfall would have had\
    \ a signiﬁcant impact on the experiment, as seen seeb by the\nfour irrigation\
    \ management applications, compared to the other seasons where irrigation application\n\
    would have been the driving force behind the soil moisture environment. Secondly,\
    \ during this\ncropping season the higher growing degree days would have promoted\
    \ canopy growth and biomass\naccumulation, speciﬁcally during early developmental\
    \ stages. According to Farahani et al. [3] and\nJin et al. [29], the development\
    \ of CC affects the rate of transpiration and consequently biomass and\ngrain\
    \ accumulation. Further studies manipulating the planting dates during the two\
    \ distinct cropping\nseasons would be valuable.\nAquaCrop model was also tested\
    \ for its ability to simulate seasonal ETc and the WUE under\ndifferent irrigation\
    \ scenarios. Similar to the observations of Katerji et al. [13], AquaCrop systematically\n\
    underestimated the seasonal ET and the deviations generally increased as stress\
    \ levels intensiﬁed\n(Table 6). The range in reduction of 6.47% to 22.16% between\
    \ simulated ETc compared to observed\nvalues is higher than that reported by Heng\
    \ et al. [8] during the validation of AquaCrop for maize, but\nless than the range\
    \ of 5% to 37% for maize grown in varying levels of soil moisture stress observed\n\
    by Katerji et al. [13]. In addition, the range calculated is similar for other\
    \ crops grown in water\ndeﬁcit conditions like cotton [3] and tomato [31]. Large\
    \ discrepancies between most values (8 out\nof 12 cases >10% deviation) can perhaps\
    \ be attributed to the excessive drainage simulated by the\nmodel that was not\
    \ observed in ﬁeld measurements. Spatial variability of the soil could contribute\n\
    to the discrepancy between observed and simulated results. Assumptions of uniform\
    \ distribution of\nwater in model simulations will inevitably lead to considerable\
    \ differences in results of soil moisture\nWater 2016, 8, 557\n16 of 18\ncontent.\
    \ In evaluating AquaCrop’s ability to simulate soil water content for pearl millet\
    \ under\nirrigation and rainfed conditions, Bello and Walker [32] concluded that\
    \ the model performance is\nmoderate but needs considerable improvement. Further,\
    \ simulated ET in AquaCrop is computed from\nthe combination of soil evaporation\
    \ and crop transpiration, which provokes some debate about the\nreliability. Katerji\
    \ et al. [13] noted that while the measured ET values mainly reﬂect transpiration\
    \ losses,\nsimulated ET corresponds uniquely to soil evaporation, resulting in\
    \ AquaCrop typically simulating low\nvalues of daily ET and overestimating the\
    \ drought effect on this variable. Likewise, Farahani et al. [3]\nreport that\
    \ model estimation of soil evaporation is questionable because of the narrow range\
    \ of\nsoil evaporation observed across irrigation regimes, with large differences\
    \ in application amount.\nAltering the conservative parameters used to directly\
    \ simulate soil evaporation and crop transpiration\nlike water extraction pattern,\
    \ crop transpiration coefﬁcient, and decline of crop coefﬁcient was observed\n\
    to have only a small change (low sensitivity level) on the simulated transpiration\
    \ values. Thus, in\nmost cases the defaulted values were maintained (Table 3).\
    \ A low sensitivity level parameter indicates\nthat the model response to change\
    \ in input is generally less than 2% [7,24]. Geerts et al. [7] and\nSalemi et\
    \ al. [24] reported similar observations for some of the abovementioned parameters.\n\
    Owing to some signiﬁcant mismatch between simulated and observed ETc values, the\
    \ deviation\nbetween actual and simulated WUE of grain yield was large for most\
    \ treatments (Table 6). However,\nthe simulated values of WUE were similar to\
    \ values reported in other studies for maize in varying soil\nmoisture environments\
    \ [8]. The large deviation of AquaCrop simulated WUE from ﬁeld-estimated\nvalues\
    \ has also been reported in other studies [4]. These authors report a deviation\
    \ of up to 27% and\n44% for sunﬂower grown under deﬁcit irrigated and rainfed\
    \ conditions, respectively, and a relatively\nlow R2 value (0.43) for the regression\
    \ analysis of simulated WUE versus measured WUE. The large\ndeviations observed\
    \ in the study imply that there is considerable room for improvement in the model\n\
    estimation of WUE, which relies heavily on predictions of crop ET. Evett and Tolk\
    \ [28] suggest that\nAquaCrop only reliably simulates WUE under well-watered conditions\
    \ but tended to misestimate WUE\nunder conditions of water stress. Katerji et\
    \ al. [13] further emphasize that AquaCrop’s performance in\npredicting WUE is\
    \ especially unsatisfactory in cases of severe moisture stress.\nThe preceding\
    \ discussion presented the response and resulting effectiveness of AquaCrop\n\
    simulation model to different soil moisture environments. However, comparing the\
    \ results between\nthe two distinct cropping seasons used in the validation process\
    \ (Experiments 1 and 2) presents\nanother outlook to explore the efﬁcacy of AquaCrop\
    \ simulation model. Experiment 1 was subject to\nlower temperatures and small\
    \ amounts of rainfall. In stark contrast, Experiment 2 was conducted in\nenvironments\
    \ of higher temperatures, which are much more conducive for maize production,\
    \ and\nextremely large amounts of rainfall. Evidently (Table 5), this resulted\
    \ in productivity in terms of\nthe biomass accumulation and yield procured being\
    \ higher for Experiment 2. AquaCrop simulated\nthese agronomic parameters adequately\
    \ for both seasons, and in fact the relative difference between\nsimulated and\
    \ measured values was lower for Experiment 2 (Table 5). This suggests that the\
    \ model,\nonce properly calibrated, can be reliably used to make predictions of\
    \ these variables in environments\nsubject to extreme weather variability, and\
    \ the calibrated model works reasonably well between distinct\nclimate seasons.\
    \ Furthermore, using the results from this ﬁeld experiment allows for a more diverse\n\
    dataset in the validation process. However, the extreme environments highlighted\
    \ some limitations\nof the model, particularly its inability to predict ETc and\
    \ consequently crop WUE. For Experiment 2,\nthe relative error (%) between the\
    \ simulated and measured values for both ETc and WUE was generally\nhigher than\
    \ in Experiment 1 (Table 6). This implies that the model reliability for these\
    \ water variables\ndecreases when challenged by extreme weather variations such\
    \ as intense rainfall events and therefore\nreveals room for improving the model.\n\
    5. Conclusions\nThe AquaCrop model was tested and validated for its ability to\
    \ simulate four crop parameters\n(green canopy cover (CC), biomass accumulation,\
    \ and ﬁnal biomass and grain yield at harvest) and\nWater 2016, 8, 557\n17 of\
    \ 18\ntwo water variables (crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and water use efﬁciency\
    \ (WUE)) for full and\ndeﬁcit-irrigated maize in a tropical environment. Statistical\
    \ indices of root mean square error, model\nefﬁciency, and index of agreement\
    \ indicate that AquaCrop was able to simulate seasonal evolution\nof CC and biomass\
    \ with a high degree of accuracy; however, model performance lessens as plant\n\
    water stress intensiﬁes. The high correlation of determination (R2) obtained in\
    \ a 1:1 analysis indicates\nthat the AquaCrop model adequately predicts ﬁnal biomass\
    \ and grain yield under different irrigation\nmanagement strategies. An overall\
    \ R2 value of 0.85 and 0.92 was obtained for biomass and yield,\nrespectively,\
    \ using both calibration and validation datasets. The model was also able to simulate\
    \ the\nseasonal ETc and WUE to an appreciable degree, but model performance becomes\
    \ unsatisfactory in\nseverely stressed environments. Reduced model performance\
    \ of ETc and WUE, indicated by high\ndeviation (%) estimates, can perhaps be attributed\
    \ to the use of a single set of soil characteristics in\nthe model calibration\
    \ that does not reﬂect the spatial variability of the soil in the ﬁeld. The results\
    \ of\nthis study suggest that the AquaCrop model could be used to predict biomass\
    \ and yield with a high\ndegree of reliability under various planting dates and\
    \ irrigation management strategies. Thus, the\nmodel is a valuable tool to aid\
    \ in decision-making for effective irrigation management strategies, but\nits\
    \ predictive performance reduces in severely stressed soil moisture environments.\n\

    currently experiencing a significant deterioration because of its dependence on
    oil revenues, which drops in prices recently. Therefore, it is necessary to revive
    the Algerian economy with other important sectors, mainly agricultural sector
    especially in the south of Algeria. The southern Algeria Contain all necessary
    conditions for agriculture, which are the large agricultural areas, water resources
    and good illumination (sunlight).The mismanagement of irrigation water affects
    negatively the agricultural production of Algeria because of the shortage of irrigation
    water. Thus, with the benefit of the Internet of Things and the smart technologies,
    we will propose in this paper a new strategy for smart irrigation in southern
    Algeria regions, to optimize the water consumption, and to provide a remote control
    and monitoring for the irrigation system. Tests were realized to prove the validity
    of our proposed system by using Contiki-Cooja simulator. Published in: 2015 Fourth

    IEEE Conference Location: Luton, UK SECTION I. Introduction Recently, the Algerian
    economy starts to decline due to the drop in oil prices. The decline in oil prices
    shows the dependence and vulnerability of a system built on the only resource
    of the hydrocarbon sector. In this case, it is urgent to develop other sectors
    of the economy to reduce the dependence on hydrocarbons. Agriculture is a strategic
    and important sector for economic development, especially in southern Algeria.
    This Saharan and semi-arid region has all conditions required for agriculture;
    there are wide agricultural surfaces, sun light and large water resources. Agricultural
    production, including livestock production, consumes more fresh water than any
    other activity in the world. Agricultural irrigation accounts for 85% of the consumed
    fresh water over the planet, and this percentage will continue to be dominant
    in water consumption due to population growth and the increasing of demand for
    food [1]. In general, poor irrigation management affects agricultural production,
    for this purpose it is necessary to develop strategies to optimize irrigation.
    An automated irrigation system is designed to monitor and control the various
    factors derived from an agricultural field such as humidity, water level, temperature,
    and human interaction. This system is generally composed of controllers and a
    wireless sensor network using ZigBee as the transmission technology for detecting
    values of an agricultural field. The sensors gather the various agricultural factors
    in real time and transmit them using Internet of Thing (IoT) applications [2].
    The control architecture of smart agriculture based on cloud computing and IOT
    is presented in [3]. The integration of modern technology in irrigation management
    system is one of the ways to improve the irrigation processes to optimize the
    use of water, electricity consumption and labor costs. In this regard, with the
    new technology and the development of the Internet and the Internet of Things,
    we will propose in this paper a strategy for smart irrigation in southern Algeria
    regions based on the use of the Internet of Things and new communication technologies.
    In this paper, this new scheme proposed for intelligent irrigation using IoT is
    an extension of our already attendant solution [4]. This new mechanism allows
    the farmer to monitor and manage agricultural area using smart phones via Internet.
    The rest of paper is organized as follow: in section 2 we will present generality
    about basic notions of Internet of Things, the section 3 presents current state
    of information and communication technology (ICT) in Algeria, our proposed approach
    will be presented in section 4 and finally, a conclusion and proposed perspectives
    of this work will be presented in section 5. SECTION II. Generality A. Internet
    of Things (IoT) The term “Internet of Things” was first used by the Massachusetts
    Institute of Technology in the year 1999[5]. There are several definitions of
    the Internet of Things. Definitions focus on technical aspects of IoT when the
    other based on the applications and functionalities. Some definition defined IoT
    as “an extension of the current Internet to all objects that can communicate directly
    or indirectly with electronic equipment and connected to the Internet”[6]. Other
    defied as “a novel paradigm that is rapidly gaining ground in the scenario of
    modern wireless telecommunications. The basic idea of this concept is the pervasive
    presence around us of a variety of things or objects - such as Radio-Frequency
    IDentification (RFID) tags, sensors, actuators, mobile phones, etc. - which, through
    unique addressing schemes, are able to interact with each other and cooperate
    with their neighbors to reach common goals”[7]. B. The Application Domains of
    IoT According to the definition of IoT, this technology can be applied in all
    domains possible but in reality IoT applied in specific domains. We categorize
    this application into four application domains: 1) Daily Life A Smartphone become
    a necessity in our life, several application for Apple iOS, Google Android and
    Windows Phone operating can be used for interfacing sensors measuring various
    parameters, which implies that facilitate the use of the concept of IoT in our
    daily life [8]. The use of IOT in daily live appear in several application such
    as control of home equipment such as air conditioners, refrigerators, washing
    machines, etc [8]. Sensors and actuators distributed in houses and offices can
    make our life more comfortable in several aspects, and domestic incidents can
    be avoided with appropriate monitoring and alarm systems, etc. [7]. Other application
    necessary of IoT like for losses, IoT can be helped to find objects that we don''t
    remember where have been left. Or in thefts an application similar to the previous
    one may leave the user to know if some objects are moved from a restricted area
    which would indicate that the object is being stolen [7]. 2) Transportation and
    Mobility Transport domain is one of most important domains, and one of the most
    complicated domains. Urban traffic is the main contributor to traffic noise pollution
    and a major contributor to urban air quality degradation and greenhouse gas emissions.
    Traffic congestion directly imposes significant costs on economic and social activities
    in most cities [8]. Advanced cars, trains, buses as well as bicycles along with
    roads and/or rails are becoming more instrumented with sensors, actuators, and
    processing power. Roads themselves are also equipped with tags and sensors that
    send important information to traffic control sites to better route the traffic,
    provide the tourist with appropriate transportation information. In this domain
    exist several applications such us assisted driving offer collision avoidance
    systems and monitoring of transportation of hazardous materials, or mobile ticketing
    and augmented maps [7]. 3) Work Environment In this domain they are several uses
    of IoT such us Industrial plants, enterprise, logistics, etc. Sensors have always
    been a part of the factory setup for security, automation, climate control, etc.
    Which ultimately will be replaced by a wireless system giving the opportunity
    to make changes to the configuration whenever necessary? It is nothing but a subnet
    IoT dedicated to the maintenance of the plant [8]. In industrial plants, IoT also
    contribute to improving the automation of industrial plants with a massive deployment
    of RFID tags associated with production parts. An event is generated by the reader
    with all the necessary data, such as RFID number, and stored on the network. The
    machine / robot is notified by the event and picks up part of the production [7].
    Logistics is a work domain but also attached to the transport domain including
    the management of transport offers good logistics management. With the application
    of IoT can improve these domains to offers the best customer services. 4) Others
    Utilities Other domains are necessary need the IoT as a Healthcare domain, military
    and smart environment, etc. In the military domain smart objects can protect the
    lives of people. In another side many benefits of IoT technologies in healthcare
    and resulting applications can be grouped essentially of: tracking objects and
    people, the identification and authentication of people, automatic data collection
    and sensing of sickness [7]. One of the major IoT application areas that are already
    drawing attention is Smart Environment IoT. There are several test beds being
    implemented and many more planned in the coming years. Other use of the IoT is
    Smart museum and gym and Monitoring environmental parameters. Smart museum and
    gym as to smart leisure environments, the museum and the gym are two representative
    examples where the IoT technologies can help in exploiting their facilities at
    the best. Monitoring environmental parameters perishable goods such as fruits,
    fresh-cut produce, meat, and dairy products are vital parts of our nutrition.
    From the production to the consumption sites thousands of kilometers or even more
    are covered and during the transportation the conservation status need to be monitored
    to avoid uncertainty in quality levels for distribution decisions. Pervasive computing
    and sensor technologies offer great potential for improving the efficiency of
    the food supply chain [3]. C. The Protocols Layer of the IoT Protocols layer of
    the IoT consists of 4 main layers: a) Physical and Data Link Layers The most common
    physical layer protocols used (10,100, 1G) WiFi (802.11b, g, n), GSM, 3G, LTE,
    4G, IEEE 802.15.4, PLC, etc. b) Network Layer The protocols of this layer are
    IPv6, RPL. • Routing Protocol for Low and Lossy Networks (RPL) The Internet Engineering
    Task Force (IETF) formed a new Working Group called ROLL (Routing Over Low-power
    and Lossy networks) in 2008[6] which was defined a new protocol RPL to solve de
    problem of Low power and Lossy Networks (LLN). Algorithmic and protocolary foundations
    of RPL described in RFC 6550[10]. RPL was developed from four sets of requirements
    that represent the four main foreseen uses of WSN: Home Automation, Building Automation,
    Industrial and Urban environments [15]. RPL is a Distance Vector IPv6 routing
    protocol for LLNs that specifies how to build a Destination Oriented Directed
    Acyclic Graph (DoDAG) using an objective function and a set of metrics/constraints
    [9]. The objective functions to adapt the generic behavior to a particular environment
    and specify more precisely the rules of construction of DoDAG [11]. RPL is based
    on the topological concept of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). The DAG defines
    a tree-like structure that specifies the default routes between nodes in the LLN.
    However, a DAG structure is more than a typical tree in the sense that a node
    might associate to multiple parent nodes in the DAG, in contrast to classical
    trees where only one parent is allowed. More specifically, RPL organizes nodes
    as Destination-Oriented DAGs (DODAGs), where most popular destination nodes (i.e.
    sinks) or those providing a default route to the Internet (i.e. gateways) act
    as the roots of the DAGs. A network may consist of one or several DODAGs, which
    form together an RPL instance identified by a unique ID, called RPLInstanceID.
    RPL defines three types of nodes: Low Power and Lossy Border Routers (LBRs): it
    refers to the root of a DODAG that represents a collection point in the network
    and has the ability to construct a DAG. The LBR also acts as a gateway (or edge
    router) between the Internet and the LLN. Router: it refers to a device that can
    forward and generate traffic. Such a router does not have the ability to create
    a new DAG, but associate to an existing one. Host: it refers to an end-device
    that is capable of generating data traffic, but is not able to forward traffic
    [14]. c) Transport Layer There are two protocols: TCP, UDP. d) Application Layer
    There are several protocols in this layer but the most important protocols are:
    HTTP (TCP), CoAP (UDP). Appear of IoT and the limits of IP architecture obliged
    to define new protocols and an adaptive layer. • Constrained Application Protocol
    CoAP The IETF Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is an application-layer
    protocol designed to provide a REST-like interface [16]. The CoAP protocol can
    remove HTTP limitations constrained environment while ensuring high compatibility
    with existing. It is relatively easy to turn HTTP requests in CoAP queries. A
    old device connected to an IPv4 network may well request access to a resource
    on a connected server to an IPv6 network and gateway translates between the two
    worlds [11]. Thus the side of a sensor network, we can use the protocol stack
    CoAP / UDP / 6LoWPAN for IPv6 auto configuration properties and the small size
    of the battery, and it will keep the Internet side HTTP stack / TCP / IPv4 which
    is present on all devices. If, for example, an iPhone wants to know the temperature
    measured by a sensor, it will send its HTTP request, it will be transformed into
    CoAP by a bridge, and the answer may be stored for a period specified by the sensor
    in the gateway. If another device on the Internet requires the same value during
    this time interval, it will not be necessary to propagate the query to the sensor
    [11]. • CoAP vs HTTP CoAP is network-oriented protocol, using similar features
    to HTTP but also allows for low overhead, multicast, etc. As HTTP protocol is
    a long-term successful standard, it can use small script to integrate various
    resources and services. Interoperation provided by HTTP is the key point of IoT,
    for this, http is employed in application level. However, HTTP is based on TCP
    protocol using point to point (p2p) communication model that not suitable for
    notification push services. Also, for constrained devices, HTTP is too complex.
    Unlike HTTP based protocols, CoAP operates over UDP instead of using complex congestion
    control as in TCP [12]. CoAP is based on REST architecture, which is a general
    design for accessing Internet resources. In order to overcome disadvantage in
    constrained resource, CoAP need to optimize the length of datagram and provide
    reliable communication. On one side, CoAP provides URI, REST method such as GET,
    POST, PUT, and DELETE. On the other side, based on lightweight UDP protocol, CoAP
    allows IP multicast, which satisfies group communication for IoT. To compensate
    for the unreliability of UDP protocol, CoAP defines a retransmission mechanism
    and provides resource discovery mechanism with resource description [13]. e) A
    Version of IPv6 Adapted to Constrained Networks 6LoWPAN In 2005, the IETF chartered
    the IPv6 over Low Power, Wireless Networks (6LoWPAN) working group to standardize
    adaptations oflPv6 over mesh networks composed of low-power, wireless links [9].
    The difference in size of the package IPv6 and datagram of IEEE 802.15.4 obliged
    6LoWPAN group to define encapsulation and header compression mechanisms that allow
    IPv6 packets to be sent to and received from over IEEE 802.15.4 based networks.
    SECTION III. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in Algeria Algeria
    wants to position itself as one of the strongholds of the wireless Internet in
    the Maghreb. The development of Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity), WiMax (Worldwide Interoperability
    for Microwave Access) is a wireless data transmission standard, with a theoretical
    speed of 70 megabits per second, the equivalent of hundreds of ADSL (Asymmetric
    Digital Subscriber Line) connections with range of 50 kilometers. This wireless
    radio technology that aims to connect any wireless equipment: access points Wi-Fi,
    IP phone, mobile phone. The commercialization of wireless telephony in fixed mode
    (4G LTE) has just started through all the capitals of the 48 provinces of the
    country with a gradual roll in each province. This new generation of wireless
    technology used in the majority of developed countries to provid users a remote
    and speed access to the Internet that not depend on fixed phone lines as ADSL
    and with a higher performance, as the incumbent Algeria Telecom has launched this
    technology. Choosing the 4G LTE was motivated to its flexibility, easy to deploy
    and competitiveness. SECTION IV. Our Approach A. The System Design The communications
    technologies in the Internet of Things is developing rapidly in recent years so
    it can meet the demands of the connections between the physical world “things”
    and “human”. Thus, the use of smartphones helps to handle remote objects via Internet.
    Our approach proposed in this paper is mainly based on our system for irrigation
    shown in [4]. The difference is that here we have used the technologies of the
    Internet of things for smart irrigation management in southern Algeria via the
    Internet, and using smart phones. As shown in figure 1, this system consists of:
    wireless sensor network system, the 6LoWPAN smart gateway that connects the Zigbee
    network with the internet via mobile communication network (4G LTE). The sensors
    placed in the agricultural field, measure continuously the soil moisture values,
    the water tank level and the water well level, then send these values through
    a ZigBee mesh network to a smart gateway (Generic IoT Border Router Wireless Br
    1000), those information are then sent via a mobile data communication 4G LTE
    network to a web service that uses intelligent software application to automatically
    analyze the data and act according to the obtained results, by selective activation
    of controllers as needed. The routing protocol used in this proposed design is
    the RPL protocol. The outputs results and irrigation recommendations are presented
    to the user on a smart phone web application using CoAP or HTTPs interfaces. Our
    system focuses on the following performance objectives to ensure its widespread
    adoption by farmers: The system is easy to deploy, to use, and facilitates planning
    of irrigation tasks. The system is modular and flexible, making it easy to maintain
    The system design is robust and reliable. Fig. 1. The system design. Show All
    The Smart gateway connects the two parts of our system (the first part: the wireless
    sensor networks and controllers, the second parts: is the internet and smartphones),
    it is the 6LoWPAN Border Router translates between the two standardized protocol
    stacks. In addition it is an application level gateway for other IoT protocols
    such as Bluetooth Low Energy, Thread, and ZigBee. WLAN or LTE may be used for
    the uplink to the Internet [17]. B. Communication in Our System The network of
    our system consists of several tiny devices (sensors, microcontrollers, smart
    gateway) that communicate with themselves via a Low and Lossy networks (LLNs),
    using the routing protocol dedicated to this type of network called RPL (Routing
    protocol for Low and Lossy networks). This LLN network is connected to the internet
    by a smart 6lowpan gateway that represents the root of the RPL, as it shown in
    figure 2. The construction of DODAG involves two phases. Phase 1. Creating the
    up paths (from the root to the nodes): The smart gateway sends a DIO message (DAG
    Information Object) to its neighbors which are (coordinators nodes, sensors detection
    of the water level and the controller of the electric pump) for the construction
    of DODAG. Each one of these neighbors in turn send a DIO message to its neighbors
    in each irrigation area for the creation of the DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graph).
    Phase 2. Creating the down paths (from the nodes to the root): Each node in the
    network when receiving the DIO Message send a DAO message (Destination Advertisement
    Object) to its root for creating paths to the root and filling tables routing.
    The soil moisture sensors measure soil moisture, these values must be sent to
    the root nodes of sub-DAGs (coordinators nodes). Each soil moisture sensor sends
    the measured values to his favorite parent until the reception of these values
    by the coordinator node, this latter calculates the average of the received values
    and send them to the smart gateway. Fig. 2. The system communication. Show All
    The sensors detection of the water level measure the water level in the well and
    in the tank, also send these measured values to the smart gateway. The smart gateway
    sends the received values (soil moisture values and water level values) via a
    mobile communication network (4G LTE) to the farmer. The farmer can check the
    soil moisture values, and also water level in the tank and in the well with smart
    phone application that connect directly to the smart gateway using http or CoAP
    protocols. Therefore, the farmer may decide either the irrigation of dry areas
    or filling the tank by sending a response to the gateway, which represent an intermediate
    that send this response to the coordinator node in order to control the opening
    and closing of the solenoid valves or to electric pump controller in order to
    activate or deactivate the electric pump in the well according to the specific
    needs. In the case where the values of soil moisture or the values of the water
    level in the tank are critical which means that areas are dry or the water level
    in the tank is minimum, our system will automatically pass to standalone mode
    (our proposed system in [4]), which makes our system tolerant to faults. SECTION
    V. Simulation and Discussion of Result In order to validate the Performance of
    our approach by simulation, we use Cooja simulator provided by Contiki, which
    unlike most simulators also allows real hardware platforms to be emulated [18].
    This simulation is about how the network converged and stabilized using the RPL
    protocol and OFO implementation of ContikiRPL. The simulation scripts consists
    of RPL sender nodes and LLN Border Router (LBR) programs which are emulated as
    Tmote sky nodes and derived from Cooja and uIPv6 module including UDP, ICMPv6,
    IPv6, SICSLoWPAN and Rime of the Contiki kernel [19] [20]. With the help of the
    CollectView tool [21] provided by Cooja, the following metrics could be observed:
    The time taken to find the first source-destination pair in the whole network;
    The time taken for the network to fully converge when all nodes join the network
    tree; The time taken for the network to fully stabilize after convergence, the
    time taken for the Estimated Transmission Count (ETX) value for each node. As
    shown in figure 3, our network consists of 15 RPL nodes; deployed in an irrigation
    land which composed of 3 areas, where each area consist of 4 RPL sender nodes,
    and the RPL sender nodes in the tank and in the well, all these nodes are connected
    to The RPL border router, and this router is used in order to interface a regular
    IP network with an RPL 6LoWPAN network. Fig. 3. The network simulation in cooja.
    Show All Figures 4 and 5, presents the network tree and the communication between
    DAGs roots (node 2.2, node 3.3, node 4.4, node 5.5, node 6.6) and DODAG root (RPL
    border router node 1.1). Fig. 4. Communication between nodes. Show All Fig. 5.
    The network tree. Show All All data collected by the wireless sensor network are
    used by the system to handle an intelligent, automated irrigation of vegetation
    (by saving water and energy use) and can be accessed in real time via a web application
    in smartphones, which can also send alerts and commands when the ground is too
    dry or a lack of water in the basin and offer suggestions to maximize plant health.
    These first results obtained by simulation using the Cooja simulator are satisfactory,
    especially in routing information by RPL and COAP protocols. This will encourage
    us to go further towards creating a web application in smartphones to complete
    all the proposed system and facilitate the tasks of the farmers for a good monitoring
    of their agriculture. Also, we hope that this approach will be very beneficial
    if we can experiment it in the fields of agriculture especially in Saharan and
    arid areas such as the south of Algeria. SECTION VI. Conclusion The intelligent
    technologies play a very important role for an effective management of irrigation,
    we have proposed in this article a smart irrigation system for a Saharan area
    like the south of Algeria. This proposed system is based on ICT and IoT technologies.
    Using these technologies, the control of irrigation will be ensured at low cost
    and high accuracy. Our proposed system facilitates the irrigation tasks and optimizes
    the costs in term of minimizing the water consummation and reducing the cost of
    the working force. The validation of the proposed approach by simulation showed
    us the value and the importance of the adoption of WSN and IoT technologies in
    precision farming. As a perspective we plan to complete the implementation of
    our system using the CoAP protocol and web application for monitoring the irrigation
    via the internet using IoT, and also to apply this system in real world. Authors

  analysis: The study uses a cost-effective sensing platform to gather agro-meteorological
    data that is standardized using the OGC-specified Sensor Observation Service (SOS)
    architecture, enabling data access across heterogeneous sensors. The proposed
    architecture is scalable, enabling the integration of multiple sensors, and provides
    on-the-fly processing and distributed computing capabilities, facilitating timely
    and informed decision-making. To demonstrate the utility of the platform, the
    authors deploy interoperable sensors in an orange orchard and estimate reference
    evapotranspiration using both the Penman-Monteith and Hargreaves methods, comparing
    results from the platform with those from a commercial Automatic Weather Station
    (AWS). The study validates the platform's ability to provide precise and reliable
    agro-meteorological data for precision agriculture applications, particularly
    irrigation management.

    Abstract Advances in Internet of Things (IoT) based sensing systems have improved
    capabilities to precisely monitor environmental conditions. Plants are sessile
    organisms and are affected by biotic and abiotic stresses caused due to surrounding
    environmental conditions such as soil water content, pest/disease infestation,
    and soil health. High-resolution sensing (Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) Systems)
    of agro-meteorological parameters helps to solve critical issues about the crop-weather-soil
    continuum. Currently, many WSN systems are deployed all over the World for precision
    agriculture purposes. Although there have been many improvements in the communication
    aspects of the WSN''s, the data dissemination and near real-time analysis components
    for taking dynamic decision, particularly in agriculture domain has not matured.
    The current WSN systems do not have a standardized way of data discovery, access,
    and sharing, which impedes the integration of data across various distributed
    sensor networks. This study addresses above issues through the adaptation of a
    framework based on Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards for Sensor Web Enablement
    (SWE). For precision agriculture applications a cost-effective, standardized sensing
    system (hardware and software) has been developed, which includes functionalities
    such as sensors plug-n-play, remote monitoring, tools for crop water requirement
    estimation, pest, disease monitoring, and nutrient management. Also, the modeling
    techniques were integrated with the interoperable web-enabled sensing system for
    addressing water management problems of horticultural crops in semi-arid areas.

    Sensor Network 1. Introduction Agriculture is an important sector which drives
    the economy and food security of many nations. Various kinds of sensing systems
    are emerging in the area of precision agriculture in which the current trend is
    towards the design and development of cost-effective, energy efficient and fault
    tolerant Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) for various monitoring and management
    applications. The focus of recent research is on improving and sustaining the
    productivity of different crops. Current advances in Information Communication
    and Dissemination Technologies (ICDT''s) have well proven their ability in information
    and knowledge dissemination. Globally, the ICDT initiatives in the field of agriculture
    have shown that with accurate monitoring and analysis of crop/weather parameters,
    it is possible to judiciously allocate available resources in agriculture (Nash
    et al., 2009, Lee et al., 2010, Prabhakar et al., 2010, Li et al., 2011). Several
    WSNs are being deployed in many countries, and have a wide range of applications
    in agriculture, such as: • Crop/pest disease monitoring (Riquelme et al., 2009,
    Tripathy et al., 2011). • Crop water management (Panchard et al., 2006, Panchard
    et al., 2007, uAgri C-DAC, 2013, Sudharsan et al., 2012, Ojha et al., 2015). •
    Crop yield prediction (Honda et al., 2009, Sudharsan et al., 2011). • Weather
    based advisory services (IMD, 2016, ISRO, 2015, mKRISHI, 2016). In general, several
    dissemination systems are currently being deployed, which enables the discovery,
    access and retrieval of various meteorological, biophysical, ocean and coastal
    water quality parameters. This kind of systems can be divided into two types:
    (1) Stovepipe or standalone systems which provide sensor details (i.e. metadata,
    observations and measurements) in their own formats (Panchard et al., 2006, Panchard
    et al., 2007, Riquelme et al., 2009, Sudharsan et al., 2011, Sudharsan et al.,
    2012, Tripathy et al., 2011, Ojha et al., 2015). (2) Interoperable systems and
    platforms which implement commonly agreed standards for sensor metadata, observation
    and measurement representation (Korduan et al., 2004, Murakami et al., 2007, Mizoguchi
    et al., 2008, Nash et al., 2009, Durbha et al., 2010, Nikkilä et al., 2010, Bröring
    et al., 2011a, Bröring et al., 2011b, Patil et al., 2012, Sawant et al., 2012,
    Jazayeri et al., 2012, Liang and Huang, 2013, Chen et al., 2015, Du et al., 2016,
    Geipel et al., 2016). However, there is a paucity of standards driven, interoperable
    systems in the Agriculture domain that severely impedes the discovery and access
    of data across Agri-WSN''s. For example, to answer a question such as “What is
    the crop water requirement during a particular crop growth stage?, there is a
    need for weather parameters such as air temperature, relative humidity, solar
    radiation, wind speed, and rainfall. from weather station and crop growth stage
    information from field/cultivation practice. It''s hard for users from diverse
    areas of study to understand the exact lineage of the collected data i.e. how
    the measurement is transformed into an observation. It is possible that the measurement
    has gone through various transformations (e.g. application calibration curves),
    which can also give rise to heterogeneous data formats (Comma Separated Values
    (CSV), Tab Separated Values (TSV), EXtensible Markup Language (XML), etc.). With
    this ever increasing spread of WSNs, there is a need for standard sets of specifications
    (both syntactic and semantic) and encodings to bring multiple sensor networks
    on a common platform (Durbha et al., 2010, Bröring et al., 2011a, Patil et al.,
    2012, Liang and Huang, 2013). Which enables the development of geographically
    distributed systems that are standardized at the semantic (Folmer and Verhoosel,
    2011, Compton et al., 2012) and Syntactic (Bröring et al., 2011b) level for regional
    agricultural practices planning (i.e. irrigation, pest/disease management, etc.).
    The initiatives such as, FOODIE: Farm-Oriented Open Data in Europe (Esbri et al.,
    2014), GeoCENS: Geospatial Cyberinfrastructure for the World-Wide Sensor Web (Liang
    and Huang, 2013), Sensor Asia (Mizoguchi et al., 2008) and Service Oriented Architecture
    for sensor data discovery in agriculture (Patil et al., 2012, Sawant et al., 2012,
    Chen et al., 2015), are some of the attempts towards facilitating the interoperability
    and sensor data discovery. These studies have shown the utility of Open Geospatial
    Consortium (OGC) specified Sensor Observation Service (SOS) standards for sensor
    data access from geographically distributed sensing systems (OGC, 2016, Bröring
    et al., 2012, Bröring et al., 2011a). Keeping in view of the requirement of a
    sensing and analysis platform in the ever increasing precision agriculture area,
    the specific objectives of this paper are: • to design a sensor platform (hardware)
    with integrated SWE architecture for precision agro-meteorological monitoring
    • to integrate the OGC''s Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) standards to achieve interoperability
    and scalability of heterogeneous sensing systems • to demonstrate the utility
    of such interoperable sensing systems for agro-meteorological monitoring and potential
    evapotranspiration estimation. This paper is organized into various sections:
    Section 2 describes the design of sensor platform (hardware) and integration of
    sensor web architecture (software) for agriculture monitoring. A case study on
    the application of interoperable sensor system for crop water requirement analysis
    is described in Section 3. Section 4 presents results and discussions on the integrated
    sensor web system and its utility for crop water requirement analysis. Section
    5 concludes with a comparison between current SWE initiatives for precision agriculture
    and a description of the future work. 2. Materials and methods The sensor web
    enablement framework of the agro-meteorological observation and analysis platform
    consists of three layers: (1) Sensing systems, (2) Sensor Web Enablement (middleware)
    and (3) Web based visualization layer (Fig. 1). Below is a description of each
    component of the framework shown in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image

    of the agro-meteorological observation and analysis platform. 2.1. Sensing systems
    The sensing systems layer comprise of the network of geographically distributed
    heterogeneous sensing systems (i.e. a set of standalone and interoperable sensing
    platforms). 2.1.1. Development of an interoperable sensing platform An interoperable
    wireless sensing system (henceforth called as SenseTube) has been designed using
    low powered System on Chip (SoC) single board computer (i.e. Raspberry Pi/R-Pi,
    Raspberry Pi (2016)) as a data collection and dissemination platform (Fig. 2a)
    (Sawant et al., 2015). Multiple sensor nodes (child nodes) can be interfaced with
    the SenseTube base station. Download : Download high-res image (226KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Interoperable sensing system, (a) system hardware
    block diagram and (b) interoperable sensor data communication architecture. Field
    level node to node communication has been established using Wi-Fi (i.e. IEEE 108.11)
    communication protocol (Fig. 2b) (Sawant et al., 2015). The General Purpose Input
    Output (GPIO) pins of SoC hardware are utilized to connect the Analog to Digital
    Converter (ADC), and through Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) the data is collected.
    The ADC has eight analog channels for connecting external sensors. The resolution
    of ADC is 10 bit thereby facilitating to interface analog sensors such as temperature,
    and humidity. The digital (raw) voltage observations collected from ADC are converted
    into physical measurements and stored onboard. The sensor sampling and polling
    frequency can be adjusted through the configuration interface. The default sampling
    interval has been set to fifteen minutes and polling frequency to one hour. The
    sensing system comprises of sensor node collecting observations at fixed interval.
    The sensing system can be configured as a base station and child node. When set
    as base station sensor node receive observations and measurements from distributed
    child nodes and transmit over remote address/service. The child node configuration
    provides a capability to receive and locally transfer sensor observations and
    measurements to the base station. Table 1 lists sensing system configurations
    for interoperable sensing system (SenseTube). Table 1. Sensing system configuration.
    SN Configuration parameter System configuration 1. Resolution Analog to Digital
    Convertor (ADC) 10 bit 2. Number of analog channels 8 channels 3. Sampling frequency
    15 min 4. Polling frequency 1 h Existing infrastructure of Internet Service Providers
    (ISP''s) has been utilized in the present study for internet connectivity. Normally,
    the ISP''s dynamically assign Internet Protocol (IP) address to the field based
    sensing system, this configuration brings out two cost-effective approaches to
    communicate with the data processing layer: (1) through Virtual Private Network
    (VPN) server configured on fixed IP addressed remote/cloud service platform (Liu,
    2000), (2) using cost-effective cloud service (e.g. ownCloud, Dropbox, etc.) which
    is easily accessible to both the field based sensing system and remote/cloud based
    data processing server (ownCloud, 2016, Dropbox, 2016). Direct reliable and secure
    access to SWE sensing platform facilitate the on-board data processing (i.e. estimate
    reference evapotranspiration, daily minimum/maximum temperature, humidity, etc.).
    The remote/cloud based data processing server can access the field nodes using
    SWE requests such as GetCapabilities, DescribeSensor, and GetObservation detailed
    information about communication between field based interoperable sensing systems,
    and sensor data storage and data analysis layer (middleware) is described in the
    subsequent section. 2.1.2. Existing standalone sensing systems Various studies
    have provided methodologies for SWE of standalone (the sensing systems which provide
    sensor details in their formats) sensing systems (Patil et al., 2012, Sawant et
    al., 2012, Liang and Huang, 2013, Chen et al., 2015). A wrapper (a piece of software
    to transform sensor observations) is necessary to make standalone sensing system
    into OGC standardized, interoperable sensing system. The method for design of
    Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) proposed by Patil et al., 2012, Sawant et
    al., 2012 has been used for regional Automatic Weather Station (AWS). This methodology
    facilitates the integration of standalone AWS into interoperable sensor web layer.
    2.2. Sensor web enablement layer (Middleware) The SWE layer provides sensor data
    polling and processing facility. The OGC standards such as SOS, Observations and
    Measurements (O&M), Sensor Model Language (Sensor ML), and Web Processing Service
    (WPS) are used to establish communication between sensing systems and client interface.
    2.2.1. Background 2.2.1.1. Sensor model language The Sensor ML has the primary
    objective to provide a robust and semantically-tied means of defining processes
    and processing components associated with the measurement and post-measurement
    transformation of observations. This includes sensors and actuators as well as
    computational processes applied pre- and post-measurement (Botts and Robin, 2007).
    In sensor web enablement architecture shown in Fig. 1, SensorML encoding is used
    to define each sensor of the sensing system. The sensor details include observed
    property, transducer information, manufacturer, geographical location, etc. The
    detailed description about sensor Observations and Measurements is discussed in
    subsequent section. 2.2.1.2. Observations and measurements The OGC O&M standard
    specifies an XML implementation for the OGC and ISO Observations and Measurements
    (O&M) conceptual model, including a schema for sampling features. The O&M encoding
    is an essential dependency for the SOS interface standard as it defines XML schemas
    for observations and for features involved in sampling when making observations
    (Cox, 2011). The O&M specifications are used to formulate the response to the
    GetObservation request which is comprised of observed properties and constrained
    by observation schema definitions (Fig. 1). The GetObservation request states
    the feature of interest with begin and end timestamp and observed properties.
    The details of SOS component is described in subsequent section. 2.2.1.3. Sensor
    observation service The OGC SOS standard defines a web service interface which
    allows querying observations, sensor metadata, as well as representations of observed
    features. Further, this standard defines means to register new sensors and to
    remove existing ones. Also, it defines operations to insert new sensor observations
    (Bröring et al., 2011a, Bröring et al., 2012, Na and Priest, 2007). The SOS stores
    time series sensor observations in a relational database and facilitates the formulation
    of response for various requests (DescribeSensor, GetObservation, InsertObservation,
    etc.). Fig. 1 shows the integration of all sensor observations into SOS relational
    database. 2.2.1.4. Sensor event service (SES) The SES provides the user an interface
    to access sensor data and measurements (Chandy and Schulte, 2007, Echterhoff and
    Ingo, 2010). The SES facilitates user to subscribe for the particular sensor or
    set threshold value/s and enable notifications about selected phenomenon (e.g.
    event notifications are triggered on depletion of soil moisture to the set threshold
    i.e. allowable depletion). It also provides methods to dynamically add new sensors
    and send notifications to the service (Fig. 3). Download : Download high-res image
    (108KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Architecture of sensor event
    notification service. 2.2.1.5. Web processing service The WPS interface standard
    provides rules for standardizing how inputs and outputs (requests and responses)
    for geospatial processing services, such as polygon overlay, the daily mean of
    sensor observation time series, etc. The standard also defines how a client can
    request the execution of a process, and how the output from the process is handled
    (Mueller and Pross, 2015). Fig. 1 shows the core WPS requests i.e. GetCapabilities,
    DescribeProcess, and ExecuteProcess. The GetCapabilities request provides information
    about available processes (e.g. a process to estimate root-zone soil moisture
    storage based on soil moisture sensor observations). The DescribeProcess provides
    details about selected process. For example, the process for estimation of root-zone
    soil moisture storage requires, input (i.e. time series observations from soil
    moisture in date and float data type) and output (i.e. estimated soil moisture
    storage time series of date and float data type) parameters. The ExecuteProcess
    handles actual computation defined by process and output results are provided
    in response. The detailed description of each component of SWE layer is described
    in subsequent section. 2.2.2. Architecture of SWE layer The Architecture of SWE
    layer comprises of, an SWE web services module (e.g. Sensor Observation Service
    version 1.0) for data query and access, Sensor Alerts and Notification (e.g. Sensor
    Event Notification Service) based on pre-defined parameter thresholds and rules
    and Sensor data archival module. These various components run in parallel with
    the supporting functionalities (Fig. 1) as discussed below: SWE Web services module
    maps the details about each sensing system using Sensor ML. The O&M standards
    are used for encoding the observations (e.g. observed values, observed property,
    references to feature and procedure, time stamps, etc.). For example in case of
    air temperature sensor, O&M standards are used to represent parameters such as
    observed values (i.e. actual sensor observations), observed property (i.e. identification
    of observed property air temperature), feature of interest and procedure (i.e.
    identification of associated feature with procedure), time stamp (i.e. time at
    which observation is collected), and offerings. The user interactions are handled
    through SOS requests such as GetCapabilities, DescribeSensor, and GetObservation
    (Fig. 4). Download : Download high-res image (530KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. Sequence diagram representing interactions among various components
    of sensor web enabled service platform. The SOS GetObservation request specifies
    the sensor offering (i.e. sensor system), O&M sampling time, observed property
    and response format (Fig. 5a). The GetObservation response returns the location
    of the feature of interest (i.e. sensor) and observation collection for specified
    time interval (Fig. 5b). Details about Sensor Alerts and Notification are discussed
    in subsequent section. Download : Download high-res image (171KB) Download : Download

    high-res image (383KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5b. Snippet of
    SOS GetObservation response. Sensor Alerts and Notification provides capabilities
    to report the sensor observations over email, social network site such as Twitter
    (2016). The main advantages of this functionality are (a) observations from sensing
    system are available on user''s social web page/account without maintaining a
    separate database on cloud service and (b) as observations are directly posted/updated
    on social media the latency in information dissemination are significantly reduced.
    The critical information about events such as sudden increase in temperature,
    and drop in relative humidity below a certain level can be effectively notified
    to the user''s/stakeholders thereby ensuring the initiation of quick response
    for mitigation of effects of these events. Social network tweet capability is
    configured to one hour in sensing system (Fig. 4). In future, the event notification
    service can be improved by incorporating the OGC publish/subscribe interface standard
    (Braeckel et al., 2016). The data from heterogeneous sensing systems is collected
    and organized in SOS complaint format by sensor data polling process. To continuously
    update the state of service the data polling process executes SOS request GetCapabilities
    and InsertObservation. As internet connectivity (GSM/GPRS network) at the test
    site (remote villages) widely varies, the process of sensor data polling is independently
    maintained, which ensures communication with all remote sensor systems. The data
    polling frequency can be configured to any duration, and it has been set to one
    hour in the present study. The size of text data transferred per sensing system
    during each polling event ranges between 1 and 1.5 kilobytes (Fig. 4). The request
    specific algorithms required for sensor data processing (e.g. daily minimum and
    maximum temperature calculation, reference evapotranspiration estimation, etc.)
    are maintained using WPS. In this study, existing implementations of the OGC SWE
    and WPS provided by OSGeo community are used (OSGeo, 2017). The OGC SOS standard
    version 1.0 implementation provided by istSOS is used, the architecture is also
    tested with OGC SOS standard version 2.0 (istSOS, 2017). Major differences identified
    between the SOS version 1.0 and 2.0 during preliminary tests of SenseTube interoperable
    sensing and analysis platform are: (a) each observation offering is limited to
    associated with only a single procedure (i.e. one to one constraint). In SenseTube
    platform, multiple procedures (e.g. for temperature sensor associated ADC values
    and observations) were stored as a single offering which caused issues while retrieving
    only the sensor observations. This improved specification for observation offerings
    in SOS 2.0 facilitated identification of correct procedure and removed ambiguity
    in obtaining the observations. (b) The improved specification for temporal and
    spatial filters added in the GetObservation request of SOS 2.0 has facilitated
    the effective retrieval of sensor observations. For example, to estimate reference
    ET for long duration (i.e. quarterly/monthly time interval) would require the
    retrieval of a large number of sensor observations. The updated temporal filters
    in SOS 2.0 enable to divide the request into smaller chunks thereby reducing memory
    overloads. The spatial filters are used to identify the nearest AWS and SenseTube
    observations to validate the observed and model estimated soil moisture and temperature.
    (c) In SOS 2.0, the response format conversion (serialization) is loosely coupled
    and can be moved from server side to client side; this helps in reducing processing
    overhead. In the long-term deployment with very high sensor sampling frequency
    this improved specification would help in reducing the energy footprint of SenseTube
    sensing and analysis platform. The OGC WPS version 2.0 implementation PyWPS 4.0
    is used (PyWPS, 2017). The SOS and WPS implementations are selected mainly because
    of lightweight Python based implementation on single board computer. The proposed
    methodology provides the on-board implementation of SWE and attempts towards independent
    hardware or software implementation. The web/mobile user interacts with SWE layer
    through SOS and WPS requests handled by the interoperable thin client. The detailed
    explanation about a web based client and SWE service platform is discussed in
    subsequent section. 2.3. Web based visualization layer A web based thin client
    has been designed to establish seamless communication between the SWE processes
    and user/stakeholder. In this study thin client has been designed for user e.g.
    farmer, researcher, etc. The OGC specified standards such as SOS, WPS and third
    party Web Map Service (WMS) are the primary access point of the web based thin
    client. The service architecture can also facilitate machine to machine interaction
    through process sharing and seamless data access (this study do not cover the
    details about machine to machine communication). Designed thin client acts as
    a gateway interface to the SWE architecture, and it hides the complexities of
    sensing systems from the end user (Fig. 6). Download : Download high-res image

    (a) Details about sensing system and SOS capabilities, (b) and (c) Sensor observations

    WMS layer. Fig. 6 shows snapshots of modules of web based thin client, (1) details
    about sensing system and capabilities, (2) sensor observations in a chart and
    table format, and (3) sensor observations over third party WMS layer (e.g. Open
    Street Map, Google Map, Bing Map, etc.). The client is interoperable with any
    SOS, WPS based sensing system. The first module provides basic information about
    service platform facilitating the details about geographic location, manufacturer,
    the number of sensors on sensing system, etc. (Fig. 6a). This information leads
    to the further query about details of each procedure and identifies the exact
    feature of interest e.g. air temperature, relative humidity, etc. Also, it provides
    details about each observed property and its associated sensor lineage e.g. minimum/maximum
    range, observed property, time of first and recent observation insert into SOS,
    etc. The sensor data access and visualization are important for any sensing system,
    particularly to the novice farming community. Sensor data observation module of
    the interoperable client comprises filter (e.g. date, time, sensor id, etc.) based
    sensor data querying mechanism. The user can select any sensor from selected sensing
    system and visualize the observations in table and chart format, and also facilitate
    the sensor data download in comma separated variable (CSV) format (Fig. 6b and
    c). The sensor observations are overlaid on third party WMS layer to understand
    the geospatial location and details of observed phenomenon (Fig. 6d). We have
    designed a web based thin client (i.e. interoperable web client) in PHP and Python
    programming language and it''s available for download on GitHub URL''s https://github.com/suryakant54321/sos-client-in-php
    and https://github.com/suryakant54321/Python-SOS-Client. A case study on agro-meteorological
    monitoring and potential evapotranspiration estimation have been discussed below
    to understand the need and utility of interoperable sensing systems. 3. A case
    study on application of SOA for citrus crop water requirement estimation A major
    Citrus (Orange/Mandarin) growing region in the semi-arid tropical region was selected
    to demonstrate the need and utility of SWE in agriculture. The details about study
    area, deployment of interoperable sensing system and estimation of agro-meteorological
    parameters are described in subsequent section. 3.1. Study area and field deployment
    of sensing system Vidarbha region of Maharashtra, India experiences severe climatic
    uncertainties (uneven rainfall and severe heat) thereby giving rise to crop failure.
    The area receives rainfall during southwest monsoon. The average annual rainfall
    ranges between 700 and 800 mm. The maximum temperature during summer recorded
    up to 46 °C while the minimum temperature during winter drops to about 5 °C (GSDA,
    2016). Wheat and Gram are major irrigated crops; Cotton, Jowar (Sorghum) and Toor
    (Pigeon Pea) are major non-irrigated crops; Orange, Cotton, and Groundnut are
    major cash crops cultivated in the region. The harvesting of Orange takes place
    in two fruiting seasons Ambiya (November-December) and Mrig (February-March).
    As per ground water resource estimates, Warud is categorized as one of the three
    over-exploited groundwater resources regions (tahsils) of Amravati district (CGWB,
    2007). The main reasons for selection of this study area to study the prospects
    of Sensor Web Enablement for irrigation management in agriculture are (a) the
    problem of ground water table depletion is more prominent in this region (NRAA,
    2011). (b) the groundwater is a major source of irrigation for Orange cultivation
    of this region and it is adversely affected due to improper irrigation practices
    (NRAA, 2011), (c) Orange crop diseases have a very close relation with poor drainage
    and excess irrigation (Grimm and Timmer, 1981). The soil-borne crop disease infestation
    is caused due to unavailability of right information on stage-wise crop water
    requirement. For initial test deployment of sensing system Orange orchard from
    Nagziri village from Warud tahsil has been selected. The World Meteorological
    Organization (WMO) guidelines for automatic weather station deployment are considered
    for sensor placement in SenseTube sensing system (WMO, 2012). Two each temperature
    and relative humidity sensors are placed at 5 m (above at top of canopy) and 2.5
    m (within the canopy) from ground. Two soil temperature and one soil moisture
    sensors are placed at 15, 30 and 30 cm depth, respectively at a radial distance
    of 5 m from the Orange tree. Remaining ADC channel was closed using pull-down
    resistor (Fig. 7). Download : Download high-res image (212KB) Download : Download

    ease in wire connection and placement of entire module on the base structure.
    The sensor observations are continuously being polled using data polling process
    (Fig. 4) since the date of field deployment (16 Feb. 2014). To monitor the state
    of the sensing system, SES (sensor Twitter feed KrishiSense) has been configured
    to upload two sensor tweets per event. Considering the character restriction of
    a tweet, each event consists of timestamp and value of recorded phenomenon. The
    URL to access sensor system Twitter feed is “https://twitter.com/KrishiSense”.
    3.2. Reference evapotranspiration estimation Widely used reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo) estimation equations i.e. FAO Penman-Monteith (ETo PM) (Allen et al., 1998)
    and Hargreaves (ETo Harg) (Allen et al., 1998) were used in order to understand
    seasonal variation in crop water requirement of orange crop grown and to study
    the feasibility of SenseTube sensing system for field level agro-meteorological
    monitoring and analysis. ETo estimations were performed for both AWS and SenseTube
    weather observations. The equation for estimation of ETo by Penman-Monteith (Allen
    et al., 1998) method is given as, (1) where Δ is slope of saturation vapour pressure
    curve (kPa °C−1), Rn is net radiation at the crop surface (MJ m−2 day−1), G is
    soil heat flux density (MJ m−2 day−1), Ta is mean daily air temperature at 2 m
    height (°C), U2 is wind speed at 2 m height (m/s), es is the saturation vapour
    pressure (kPa), ea is the actual vapour pressure (kPa), (es − ea) is the saturation
    vapour pressure deficit (kPa) and γ is psychrometric constant (kPa °C−1). The
    equation for estimation of ETo by Hargreaves (Allen et al., 1998) method is given
    as, (2) where Tmean mean daily air temperature (°C), Tmax is maximum daily air
    temperature (°C), Tmin is minimum daily air temperature (°C) and Ra is extraterrestrial
    radiation (mm day−1). 4. Results and discussions The agro-meteorological observations
    recorded by SenseTube sensing system during one cropping season of Orange i.e.
    July 2014 to August 2015, locally known as Mrig (July-February) and Ambiya (March-October)
    flowering (locally called bahar), are used for the study. The sampling (for air
    temperature, relative humidity, soil temperature, soil moisture) and polling (data
    update to the remote server) frequency were set to fifteen minutes and one hour,
    respectively. In order to compare the performance of SenseTube sensing system,
    a commercially available Automatic Weather Station (AWS) was set in the study
    area. The AWS has been set up according to World Meteorological Organization (WMO)
    guidelines for automatic weather station installation (WMO, 2012). The spatial
    distance between both sensing systems is less than one kilometer. The daily variations
    in air temperature (°C) at test site are shown in Fig. 8. Ranges of daily minimum
    and maximum temperature at the test bed during the said period were observed to
    be 6.44–34.09 °C and 20.30–46.73 °C, respectively. Download : Download high-res

    varies between 23 °C and 32 °C. It can be observed that there is a steady change
    in soil temperature and rainfall events have very low impact on the change in
    soil temperature at depth of 30 cm. Observed soil temperature shows seasonality
    with the return period of the year which closely resembles with variations in
    surface air temperature. Fig. 11 shows daily volumetric soil moisture at 30 cm
    depth observed by soil moisture sensor mounted on SenseTube. The variations in
    soil moisture are observed to be corresponding rainfall events. The minor variations
    in soil moisture during the absence of rainfall event are caused by irrigation
    events. In selected citrus orchard drip irrigation systems are functional during
    the crop growth period. The volumetric minimum and maximum soil moisture content
    were 12.04% and 48.77%, respectively. Download : Download high-res image (445KB)

    ETo PM was carried out only with AWS observations as the necessary parameters
    are available, whereas ETo Harg was obtained with AWS and SenseTube system as
    the necessary parameters are limited and observed by both AWS and SenseTube for
    comparison. The results show that for most of the period SenseTube based ETo Harg
    underestimates than ETo PM (Fig. 12). The close vicinity of crop canopy and variations
    in field level relative humidity may have caused overestimates of SenseTube based

    proposed SWE hardware and software architecture has unique features over existing
    implementations. The major advantages of proposed SWE architecture are, • Scalability:
    the proposed sensor web enablement architecture based on heterogeneous sensing
    systems provides the ability to seamlessly connect with multiple sensor nodes.
    • On the fly data processing: dense observations of agro-meteorological parameters
    with seamless data access facilitate important decisions regarding irrigation
    interval and depth. • Distributed computing: design of web enabled client has
    a unique advantage for distributed computing of domain specific environmental
    and crop parameters. With evolving OGC SWE specifications there are few limitations
    in the integrated architecture. Some of the major limitations of proposed SWE
    architecture are, • Scaling up estimates from point to region: the proposed SWE
    architecture needs to be configured with OGC Web Feature Service and Web Coverage
    Service to scale-up actual ET estimates at field level. • Need for sensor plug-n-play:
    significant improvements in analog multi-bus (Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C),
    Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), RS485, RS232, etc.) sensor hardware connection
    needs to be integrated on sensing system hardware. • Public availability of sensor
    observations: very few public, private organizations are providing sensor observations
    in OGC O&M specifications which impose limitations on the utility of service oriented
    architectures. However, there is need to compare the studies based on SWE for
    precision agriculture. Comparison of available studies based on selected features
    is discussed in subsequent section. 4.2. Comparison between SWE studies Available
    published studies on SWE architectures for precision agriculture application are
    studied based on features proposed by Chen et al. (2015). The proposed features
    of SWE are architecture, sensors supported, data sharing, process sharing, services
    involved, data model, validation and complexity. In this study two additional
    features were identified for comparison of SWE implementation, (1) sensor plug-n-play
    and (2) SWE integration on hardware. The sensor plug-n-play feature describes
    implementation of OGC PUCK Protocol Standard ensuring seamless integration of
    sensors. Feature on SWE integration with hardware was identified to ensure the
    seamless communication between standardized web-enabled hardware platforms (Table
    2). Table 2. Comparison of SWE based architectures. Empty Cell Features Empty

    3. The fields marked by right (√) represents available and cross (×) represents
    not available. Table 2 shows a comparison between various SWE implementations
    in precision agriculture application. The SOA proposed by Korduan et al., 2004,
    Murakami et al., 2007, Nash et al., 2009, Nikkilä et al., 2010, Patil et al.,
    2012, Sawant et al., 2012 primarily focus on SWE of existing sensing systems/platforms.
    Whereas, SOA proposed by Liang and Huang, 2013, Geipel et al., 2016, Chen et al.,
    2015, Du et al., 2016 integrate SWE on hardware layer of sensing system/platform.
    The OGC SWE standards are evaluated for their usability and applicability in precision
    agriculture application. The scalability of proposed architecture is facilitated
    by O&M, SensorML and SOS standards. On the fly data processing and distributed
    computing is facilitated by WPS standard. Integrated geospatial information with
    sensor observations facilitates spatio-temporal estimation of the critical agro-meteorological
    parameter. On-board implementation of the SWE framework facilitates ease in acquiring
    processed information at client interface which has potential to extend sensor
    as a service. The large deployment of such SWE based sensing system facilitates
    system identification and reliable access to sensor observations which facilitates
    the hardware maintenance and remote software (i.e. firmware) updates. 5. Conclusions
    With ever increasing capabilities of open source hardware and software tools,
    cost effective IoT based agro-meteorological observation systems can be designed
    for monitoring the weather conditions at very high precision and temporal scale.
    This will facilitate the open field based agricultural research and decision making
    abilities of resource poor farmers in developing countries. Through on-board implementation
    of OGC specified SOS standards the designed sensing system facilitates storage
    and dissemination of sensor observations thereby reducing syntactic heterogeneity
    among sensing systems. The multiple modes (VPN and cloud service) of sensor data
    transfer over the internet ensured the IoT capability of the sensing system. Sensor
    event notification service through social media (Twitter) has shown the effective
    mode of sensor information dissemination to the larger audience. The web based
    interoperable service oriented application client provides better sensor data
    dissemination capabilities thereby facilitating the stakeholders to easily access
    the required sensor observations. The operational field deployment of the sensing
    system in Orange orchard has proved the capabilities of designed SOA. When implemented
    on large scale these distributed interoperable sensing systems can have very wide
    range of applications in solving the regional issues pertaining to the crop-weather-soil
    continuum. The study has been initiated to collect soil moisture observations
    from multiple depths and locations for validation of proposed modeling approach
    for field scale irrigation scheduling of Orange crop. It has been envisaged to
    integrate OGC specified Sensor Planning Service on sensing platform for effective
    in-situ data processing for better decision making. Attempts are being made towards
    deployment of multiple sensing systems for agro-meteorological data collection
    for precision water management in the horticultural crop (Orange) of the semi-arid
    tropical region of Maharashtra India. Acknowledgements This is a part of research

  analysis: 'The proposed system addresses the measurement of soil properties across
    the target area and enables reliable transmission of collected data for analysis
    at central nodes. Previous work includes single-hop systems with limited range
    and higher deployment cost constraints. This work discusses achieving multi-hop
    communication and setting up a reliable network for data transmission over a wide
    area. The system design emphasizes cost-eﬀectiveness and communication range,
    which are key factors in agricultural automation.

    Firstly, the paper introduces a low-cost wireless sensor network based on HC12,
    which provides a reliable connection and a long communication range. An experiment
    in an actual farm shows that the system performs better on soil measurement in
    a wide area. The test cases indicate that the system runs stably and accurately.
    As indicated in the results, the point-to-point distance is 250 m, which increases
    to 750 m when two intermediate nodes are added. The proposed approach supersedes
    existing works in terms of lower deployment cost and better communication range.
    Network performance is somehow better than existing approaches, except for latency,
    which is not a requirement for the target application. A long-term test is performed
    to check the real-time collection of ﬁeld data, which results in accurate ﬁeld
    status updates. Lastly, the proposed approach can be used as a reference model
    for any type of wide-area information monitoring system.'

    \ of\ninformationmonitoringforactuallarge-scaleagriculturalfarms. Asmall-scalefarmcanbeeasilymanaged.\n\
    By contrast, a large farm will require automating equipment that contributes to\
    \ crop production.\nSensor based soil properties measurement plays an integral\
    \ role in designing a fully automated\nagricultural farm, also provides more satisfactory\
    \ results than any manual method. The existing\ninformation monitoring solutions\
    \ are inefficient in terms of higher deployment cost and limited\ncommunication\
    \ range to adapt the need of large-scale agriculture farms. A serial based low-power,\n\
    long-range, and low-cost communication module is proposed to confront the challenges\
    \ of monitoring\ninformation over long distances. In the proposed system, a tree-based\
    \ communication mechanism is\ndeployed to extend the communication range by adding\
    \ intermediate nodes. Each sensor node consists\nof a solar panel, a rechargeable\
    \ cell, a microcontroller, a moisture sensor, and a communication unit.\nEach\
    \ node is capable to work as a sensor node and router node for network traﬃc.\

    \ communication distance measured 250 m between two points\nand increased to 750\
    \ m by adding two intermediate nodes. The minimum working current of each\nnode\
    \ was 2 mA, and the packet loss rate was approximately 2–5% on diﬀerent packet\
    \ sizes of the\nentire network. Results show that the proposed approach can be\
    \ used as a reference model to meet\nthe requirements for soil measurement, transmission,\
    \ and storage in a large-scale agricultural farm.\nKeywords: information monitoring;\

    \ represents the application of modern information and communication technologies\n\
    to agriculture. It can potentially deliver productive and sustainable agricultural\
    \ production based\non a precise and resource eﬃcient approach. Sensors in agricultural\
    \ farms allow farmers to obtain\ndetailed data in real time as variables, such\
    \ as soil and ambient temperature, irrigation water and soil\nconductivity, and\
    \ soil or irrigation water pH. With the use of communication technologies, these\
    \ data\ncan be transmitted to gateways to trigger the required actions based on\
    \ soil properties and data logs,\nwhich can be sent to the cloud for future analytics\
    \ [1,2].\nTo access ﬁeld data with minimal wiring, easy installation, and low\
    \ maintenance eﬀort, diﬀerent\napplications that utilize the distributed sensing\
    \ features of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), including\nSensors 2020, 20, 2367;\

    2 of 18\nwater monitoring [3–5], forest [6,7], industrial [8,9], agriculture [10–12],\
    \ environmental [13,14], and\nsmart city and community framework [15,16] have\
    \ emerged. Such technologies are suitable platforms\nfor implementing wireless\
    \ systems in agriculture due to the application-oriented properties of WSNs.\n\
    A WSN is a collection of nodes that work cooperatively. Each node includes a microcontroller,\
    \ a power\nsource, and a communication unit, and can accommodate multiple sensors.\
    \ Sensor data are transferred\nto a gateway using the communication unit via single\
    \ or multiple hops.\nWSNs are emerging as a great aid to improve agriculture quality,\
    \ productivity and resource\noptimization. At present, substantial research [17–20]\
    \ has focused on developing eﬃcient WSN\nsystems that will provide ﬁne-grain monitoring\
    \ and automation of farming processes. The measured\nvalues of soil sensor nodes\
    \ should be reliably transferred to a gateway via a communication medium.\nWSNs\
    \ can collect data from ﬁeld sensor nodes with low cost, minimal wiring, easy\
    \ installation,\nand improved maintenance.\nA WSN-based network comprises end\
    \ nodes for fetching ﬁeld\ndata measurement (e.g., temperature and moisture),\
    \ a communication module for data transmission\n(e.g., ZigBee), and a central\
    \ controller to manage sensor data, trigger actuators, and store data [21,22].\n\
    Currently, the most widely used ZigBee, Bluetooth, Cellular and other communication\
    \ technologies\nhave their own pros and cons [23,24]. In one system, the collected\
    \ ﬁeld environmental parameters\ne.g., moisture, temperature are used to send\
    \ via ZigBee module toward sink node and a GPRS module\nis integrated into sink\
    \ node for long distance communication with server which realized centralized\n\
    information monitoring, data display, data storage and performs data analytics\
    \ in the greenhouse [25].\nIn a traﬃc information detection system, Bluetooth\
    \ is used to transmit the vehicle parameters\ne.g., position and speed etc. [26].\
    \ A GPRS based sensor monitoring system is proposed to ensure the\naccurate data\
    \ transmission over long distance in a distributed environment [27]. However,\
    \ ZigBee and\nBluetooth are short-range radio technologies and are not suitable\
    \ for long-range transmission scenarios.\n2G, 3G, 4G, and other solutions based\
    \ on cellular communication can provide a wider coverage, but\nthey consume too\
    \ much energy and increase the operating costs [24].\nThe core objectives of building\
    \ the target system are distance coverage, cost eﬀectiveness, and\ncommunication\
    \ reliability. In this work, a low-cost communication module called HC12 is used\
    \ for\ndata transmission at long distance in the agriculture farm. HC12 has 200–1000\
    \ m communication range\nin point to point scenario. However, compared with the\
    \ proposed system, cellular communication and\nLPWAN based solutions [24,28] provide\
    \ better communication range over several kilometers in open\nsight. Nevertheless,\
    \ a tradeoﬀ exists between distance coverage and node placement in each zone.\n\
    For example, if node placement distance increases in kilometers for the sake of\
    \ a higher communication\nrange, then a farmer may be unable to measure intermediate\
    \ zones. By contrast, if node placement\ndistance decreases, then deploying a\
    \ costly system is unnecessary. In our application, zone coverage\nand distance\
    \ coverage are equally important. To take the application requirements into accounts,\n\
    HC12 has been considered the most appropriate solution. A network mechanism has\
    \ been designed to\nextend the communication by adding intermediate nodes. To\
    \ the best of our knowledge, the proposed\nwork can best ﬁt into application requirements.\n\
    The rest of this paper is organized as follows: The existing IoT technologies\
    \ in information\nmonitoring are discussed in Section 2. The key component and\
    \ proposed technology are introduced in\nSection 3. The detailed methodology of\
    \ the proposed system is discussed in Section 4. A set of real\ntime experiments\
    \ are presented and commented in Section 5. Finally, the conclusions, limitation\
    \ and\nfuture work are summarized in Section 6.\n2. Literature Review\nThe role\
    \ of WSNs in agriculture has become prominent as part of the precision agriculture\n\
    (PA) initiative, and these networks help constitute PA [1,17]. The adaptation\
    \ of WSN systems in\nagriculture has been widely explored in past decade [22,29]\
    \ from diﬀerent perspective e.g., design\nof wireless platform for better performance,\
    \ optimal deployment strategy of sensor nodes and\nautomated irrigation management\
    \ systems for water saving. In [30], the parameters of IEEE 802.15.4\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 2367\n3 of 18\nMAC layer are properly tuned to follow the sampling\
    \ frequency of sensor nodes according to the\nrequirements of precision farming.\
    \ A quality sensor node deployment pattern is proposed to the\nprecision agriculture\
    \ [31]. The method uses several metrics for quantifying sensor deployment patterns\n\
    to provide qualitative connectivity in the farm. From the cost perspective, the\
    \ problem of optimal\ndeployment is achieved by maintaining the desired level\
    \ of coverage and connectivity with a minimum\nnumber of nodes [32]. Furthermore,\
    \ the management of irrigation system is extensively analyzed to\ngain water saving\
    \ [22,33,34]. For instance, the real time value from root zones of the plant are\
    \ measured\nin a distributed manner and a threshold value used at the gateway\
    \ to achieve water saving [21].\nRecently, a decision support system (DSS) embedded\
    \ in the network gateway outperformed the\nstate-of-the-art methods based on parameters\
    \ thresholding [22].\nAs a matter of fact, most of the eﬀort has been done on\
    \ the design and deployment strategies\nfor WSN with the realization of sensing\
    \ capability and better management in precision agriculture.\nWhereas, the reliable\
    \ real time data transmission acquired by networked sensors over long distance\n\
    has been less investigated. Although, many researchers have focused the attention\
    \ on study and\ndesign of data transmission in WSN environment, but the common\
    \ drawbacks are either its limited\ndistance coverage or higher deployment cost.\
    \ For example, ZigBee has always been considered an\noptimal solution because\
    \ of its low power consumption and strong mobility [35–37]; however, its data\n\
    transmission range is limited to 100 m between two points. The count of ZigBee\
    \ devices increases\nwhen more than 100m are required to be covered; hence, implementation\
    \ cost and network overhead\nwill also increase. To ensure long distance coverage,\
    \ a GSM-based solution is used wherein each node\ncontains a GSM module and directly\
    \ sends its sensor data to the cloud, thereby changing network\ntopology from\
    \ centralized to distributed [38]. Although coverage tension is eliminated, implementation\n\
    cost and installation complexity are extremely high. Recently, a LoRa-based lowpower\
    \ wide-area\nnetwork (LPWAN) solution has been proposed to solve the information\
    \ monitoring problem over\na wide area [28]. A LoRa communication module provides\
    \ reliable data transmission at a distance\nof more than 1 km in a relatively\
    \ complex environment; however, the major drawback of the LPWAN\nsolution is that\
    \ it requires an annual subscription from a single vendor (Semtech) [39] and a\
    \ dedicated\ngateway called NB-IoT/LoRaWAN [24], which may be costly.\nOne of\
    \ the current challenge is to design a cost-effective system for the field data\
    \ transmission over\nlong distance, which is more desirable in this application,\
    \ is rarely explored. Thus, the current study\nproposes and deploys a low-cost\
    \ wireless sensor network, which can be used as a reference model for data\ncollection\
    \ from field sensors over a wide area. Nevertheless, some WSN-based information\
    \ monitoring\nsystems are already available [22,28,34,38], but the common drawback\
    \ of these systems is the extremely\nhigh deployment cost when the count of devices\
    \ increases.\n3. IoT-Based Model Farm\nOur proposed solution is application-speciﬁc\
    \ and consists of moisture sensors, microcontrollers,\nradio frequency communication\
    \ modules, solar panels, a Linux-based gateway, an Internet\nconnectivity module,\
    \ and cloud storage. The diagram of the proposed system design is shown\nin Figure\
    \ 1. The solution is designed with the ultimate goal of ensuring high distance\
    \ coverage\nwith minimal deployment cost.\n3.1. Overview of HC12\nHC12 [40] is\
    \ a new-generation half-duplex wireless transmission module, which has a frequency\n\
    range of 433.4–473.0 MHz. The module has embedded multichannels and can use 100\
    \ channels\nwith a stepping of 400 KHz. The maximum transmission power of the\
    \ module is 100 mW (20 dBm),\nthe receiving sensitivity is −112 dBm at a baud\
    \ rate of 9600 in air, and the communication distance is\n200–1000 m in open space.\
    \ The farthest communication range can be achieved when a module is set\nto a\
    \ low data rate. Three working modes, called FU1, FU2, and FU3, can be set to\
    \ adapt to diﬀerent\napplication requirements. FU1 and FU2 are power-saving modes,\
    \ whereas FU3 is the full power mode.\nSensors 2020, 20, 2367\n4 of 18\nSensors 2019, 19, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n\

    \ 2G module is a GSM-based module that can deliver 850/900/1800/1900 MHz performance\
    \ for\nvoice and data. The module communicates with the main board using AT commands\

    \ study, this module is used to collect\nweather data from the Internet and establish\
    \ connection with the cloud using the GSM/GPRS protocol.\nCompared with 3G or\
    \ 4G, the 2G module is more suitable for agricultural applications because most\n\
    agricultural farms are located in the countryside, where 3G or 4G are not yet\
    \ established. Although\nthe data rate is considerably slower than the latest\
    \ technology, speed is not an important factor in our\ncontext because the amount\
    \ of collected data is extremely small.\n4. System Design and Implementation\n\
    Our system primarily includes nodes (installed in the ﬁeld), the central node\
    \ (gateway), and cloud\nstorage, as presented in Figure 1. Field data are measured\

    \ from the gateway via a communication unit,\ncollect ﬁeld soil parameters, and\

    based power unit. A block diagram of a node is shown in Figure 2. \n \nFigure 2. Hardware design of sensor node. \n\
    The microcontroller unit (MCU) is ATmega328p (Arduino Nano 3.0). The recommended input \n\
    voltage for the microcontroller is 7–12 V, and the operating voltage (logic level) is 5 V. The MCU has \n\
    14 digital I/O and 8 analog input pins. Each pin has a DC current of 40 mA. The sum of all currents \n\

    \ with the\ncount of intermediate nodes. The lower layer node depends on the liveness\
    \ of the upper layer node,\nwhere the failure of one node may cause the entire\
    \ subnetwork to become unavailable. Each node can\nhost one to nine directly connected\
    \ nodes and may have many indirectly connected nodes, as shown in\nFigure 8.\n\

    based approach is used where each intermediate node creates a layer. The count of layers increases \n\

    Each node can host one to nine directly connected nodes and may have many indirectly connected \n\
    nodes, as shown in Figure 8. \n \nFigure 8. Layered based network architecture \n\
    The gateway node is located at the top layer, which generates data request, whereas all the \n\
    sensor nodes are found at the lower layers. When the packet originates from layer 0 (gateway) toward \n\
    the targeted nodes, each node checks if the packet is destined for it and then processes the packet; \n\
    otherwise, it forwards the packet to its child nodes. To overcome unnecessary packet forwarding and \n\
    network overhead, the address length is defined at each layer of the tree (e.g., layer 1 has a single‐\n\
    digit address, layer 2 has two digits, and layer 3 has three digits of the address). The length of the \n\
    destination address at each node is used to calculate in digits prior to packet forwarding. For example, \n\
    a packet is generated with the targeted address 112, and node 1 will forward the packet to all nodes \n\
    in its subtree. When the packet is received at the second layer, node 11 forwards the packet to its \n\
    sensor  nodes,  whereas  the  other  nodes  will immediately  drop  the  packet. \
    \ The  network  logic  for \npacket process and movement is implemented at the sensor node. \n\
    Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) consist of spatially distributed autonomous sensor nodes to \n\
    cooperatively monitor certain events and phenomena in an interesting area. As compared to wired \n\
    network, the WSN’s nodes are very to link failure due to their limited available resources [41]. The \n\
    failure also impacts the sub network if the underlying topology is tree based. \
    \   Such failure not only \ncause  to  coverage  loss  of  monitored  area  but \
    \ also  disjoint  some  nodes  with  the  base  station.   \nTherefore, it is crucial to restore connectivity from such damaged WSNs. \n\
    Connectivity restoration issue can be resolved by placing relay node (RN) [42,43]. In our system, \n\
    each  node  is  designed  to  act  as  a  sensor  node  and  a  relay  node  as \
    \ well.  With  the  realization  of \nconnectivity restoration, we classified the neighbor nodes into primary and secondary paths, to re‐\n\
    route the traffic in case of failure. All the nodes are considered neighbors which are placed within a \n\
    radius and can communication directly. Each node has four neighbors in its radius: column‐wise, \n\
    which follows primary path vertically and row‐wise, which follows secondary path horizontally. In \n\
    Figure 8. Layered based network architecture.\nThe gateway node is located at\
    \ the top layer, which generates data request, whereas all the sensor\nnodes are\
    \ found at the lower layers. When the packet originates from layer 0 (gateway)\
    \ toward\nthe targeted nodes, each node checks if the packet is destined for it\
    \ and then processes the packet;\notherwise, it forwards the packet to its child\
    \ nodes. To overcome unnecessary packet forwarding and\nnetwork overhead, the\
    \ address length is deﬁned at each layer of the tree (e.g., layer 1 has a single-digit\n\
    address, layer 2 has two digits, and layer 3 has three digits of the address).\
    \ The length of the destination\naddress at each node is used to calculate in\
    \ digits prior to packet forwarding. For example, a packet is\ngenerated with\
    \ the targeted address 112, and node 1 will forward the packet to all nodes in\
    \ its subtree.\nWhen the packet is received at the second layer, node 11 forwards\
    \ the packet to its sensor nodes,\nwhereas the other nodes will immediately drop\
    \ the packet. The network logic for packet process\nand movement is implemented\
    \ at the sensor node.\nWireless sensor networks (WSNs) consist of spatially distributed\
    \ autonomous sensor nodes\nto cooperatively monitor certain events and phenomena\
    \ in an interesting area. As compared to\nwired network, the WSN’s nodes are very\
    \ to link failure due to their limited available resources [41].\nThe failure\
    \ also impacts the sub network if the underlying topology is tree based. Such\
    \ failure not only\ncause to coverage loss of monitored area but also disjoint\
    \ some nodes with the base station. Therefore,\nit is crucial to restore connectivity\
    \ from such damaged WSNs.\nConnectivity restoration issue can be resolved by placing\
    \ relay node (RN) [42,43]. In our system,\neach node is designed to act as a sensor\
    \ node and a relay node as well. With the realization of\nconnectivity restoration,\
    \ we classiﬁed the neighbor nodes into primary and secondary paths, to re-route\n\
    the traﬃc in case of failure. All the nodes are considered neighbors which are\
    \ placed within a radius\nand can communication directly. Each node has four neighbors\
    \ in its radius: column-wise, which\nfollows primary path vertically and row-wise,\
    \ which follows secondary path horizontally. In case of\nSensors 2020, 20, 2367\n\

    An experimental test is performed in a line of sight on a large-scale grape farm,\
    \ which covers\nnearly 700 m from east to west and 500 m from north to south.\
    \ The real-time test aims to measure the\ncommunication range, the transmission\
    \ delay time, and the packet success rate in the network on a\ndiﬀerent packet\
    \ size. Soil moisture sensors are used to measure the moisture level in diﬀerent\
    \ areas of\nthe farm to validate the results because moisture value is familiar\
    \ to farmers.\n5.1. Point-to-Point Communication Distance Test\nThe ﬁrst step\
    \ is to measure the communication range between two directly connected nodes.\n\
    The central node (gateway) is ﬁxed on the east–north corner, which generates data\
    \ request for sensor\nnodes in a timely manner. The response rate at the gateway\
    \ is examined by generating a continuous\ndata request and slowly moving node\
    \ 1. The optimal measured distance is approximately 250 m,\nSensors 2020, 20,\

    node 1, which results in a packet loss rate of 1.5% between two directly connected nodes. \n\

    The actual work of the network is examined via a multi‐hop communication distance test, in \n\
    which each node can serve as a router and a data collection unit. Considering the previous result, \n\
    node 1 was initially fixed in position #1 from where it was responding reliably in the point‐to‐point \n\
    test. As a mobile node, node 11 moved slowly, the response rate was measured continuously, and \n\
    node 11 was fixed in position #11 at a distance of 250 m next to node 1. In addition, two more nodes \n\
    (111 and 112) were deployed next to node 11 to check the work of multiple nodes at the same layer. \n\
    The last two nodes were deployed in opposite directions at a distance of 250 m from node 11 in \n\
    positions #111 and #112, as shown in Figure 11. \nAs shown in the network architecture, the gateway, node 1, and node 11 are found at layer 0, the \n\
    first layer, and the second layer, respectively; whereas nodes 111 and 119 are located at the third \n\
    layer. After conducting the experiment on the communication range of our proposed solution, the \n\
    nodes are fixed at  the  same  positions  in Figure  11, from  where  they are \
    \ responding  reliably.  To \nconclude the distance coverage test, the measured point‐to‐point distance is 250 m, which increases \n\
    to nearly 750 m by adding two intermediate nodes.   \nA long‐term test was performed on the fixed poles in an open area of the grape farm. Each node \n\
    was  powered  by  10  W  monocrystalline  solar  panel  and  had  a  moisture \
    \ sensor  attached,  which \nmeasured soil status in the area. The test was conducted for 5 days from 16 January 2020 to 20 January \n\
    2020. The data request time was set from 10:00 am to 1:00 pm. On a daily basis, the gateway node \n\
    (Node  0)  gets  weather  data  (e.g.,  air  temperature  and  humidity)  from \
    \ OpenWeatherAPI  and \ngenerates soil moisture requests to nodes 1, 11, 111, and 112. A retry mechanism was also used at the \n\
    gateway node to keep a daily record of the moisture status in different areas. During data collection \n\
    on 2nd and 3rd day, water was poured on the zones of node 111 and 112, respectively. \n\

    \ Distance Test\nThe actual work of the network is examined via a multi-hop communication\
    \ distance test, in\nwhich each node can serve as a router and a data collection\
    \ unit. Considering the previous result, node\n1 was initially ﬁxed in position\
    \ #1 from where it was responding reliably in the point-to-point test.\nAs a mobile\
    \ node, node 11 moved slowly, the response rate was measured continuously, and\
    \ node 11\nwas ﬁxed in position #11 at a distance of 250 m next to node 1. In\
    \ addition, two more nodes (111 and\n112) were deployed next to node 11 to check\
    \ the work of multiple nodes at the same layer. The last two\nnodes were deployed\
    \ in opposite directions at a distance of 250 m from node 11 in positions #111\
    \ and\n#112, as shown in Figure 11.\nAs shown in the network architecture, the\
    \ gateway, node 1, and node 11 are found at layer 0,\nthe ﬁrst layer, and the\
    \ second layer, respectively; whereas nodes 111 and 119 are located at the third\
    \ layer.\nAfter conducting the experiment on the communication range of our proposed\
    \ solution, the nodes are\nﬁxed at the same positions in Figure 11, from where\
    \ they are responding reliably. To conclude the\ndistance coverage test, the measured\
    \ point-to-point distance is 250 m, which increases to nearly 750 m\nby adding\
    \ two intermediate nodes.\nA long-term test was performed on the ﬁxed poles in\
    \ an open area of the grape farm. Each node\nwas powered by 10 W monocrystalline\
    \ solar panel and had a moisture sensor attached, which measured\nsoil status\
    \ in the area. The test was conducted for 5 days from 16 January 2020 to 20 January\
    \ 2020.\nThe data request time was set from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. On a daily\
    \ basis, the gateway node\n(Node 0) gets weather data (e.g., air temperature and\
    \ humidity) from OpenWeatherAPI and generates\nsoil moisture requests to nodes\
    \ 1, 11, 111, and 112. A retry mechanism was also used at the gateway\nnode to\
    \ keep a daily record of the moisture status in diﬀerent areas. During data collection\
    \ on 2nd and\n3rd day, water was poured on the zones of node 111 and 112, respectively.\n\

    5.3. Network Performance Test\nThe maximum communication range of a single hop\
    \ is 250 m in radius. The tests were performed\nwith two and three hops, with\
    \ each hop having a distance of 250 m. A router that was placed in\nbetween hops\
    \ functioned as a repeater. It reconstructed the packet and forwarded it to the\
    \ destination,\nthereby regenerating the radio signal. A series of tests was performed\
    \ in the corridor within the line\nof sight, with a diﬀerent packet size up to\
    \ a maximum of 256 bytes at an underlying rate of 9.6 kbps.\nOur system supports\
    \ next-hop routing for controlled messages in the tree and many-to one routing\
    \ to\nthe gateway.\nIn this phase of the experiment, a real-time test was performed\
    \ to check the latency and packet loss\nrate at diﬀerent packet sizes. The test\
    \ was performed during sunny weather from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.\nThe network\
    \ consisted of four nodes located at three diﬀerent layers. For each node, hundreds\
    \ of\npackets were sent continuously at each packet size. Thus, a total of 400\
    \ packets were sent at each\npacket size from the gateway to the nodes. Packet\
    \ loss and time delay were measured for each node in\nthe network. The packet\
    \ loss rate was slightly increased with packet size, but the per-node results\
    \ in\nTable 2 show that the loss rate was not completely dependent on packet size,\
    \ and other factors, such as\npower issue and antenna placement, could be involved.\
    \ In the 16-byte test, the child node loss rate was\nless than that of its parent\
    \ when a tree structure where the parent packet loss should reﬂect those of its\n\
    child nodes was deployed. The reason for such ﬁnding is that sequential data requests\
    \ are generated\nfrom the gateway node, and the gateway waits for the reply of\
    \ the generating packet and increases the\nnode ID in case of a packet reply or\
    \ time-out. Arguably, node 11 became active when a packet was\ngenerated for node\
    \ 111. The total packet loss in the network at diﬀerent packet sizes is presented\
    \ in\nTable 3.\nTable 2. Packet loss per node at diﬀerent packet sizes.\nPacket\

    \ Figure 13 shows that latency increases by adding\neach intermediate node.\n\
    The acceptable latency and packet loss depend on the application. Table 4 presents\
    \ the comparisons\nof latency, communication range, and packet loss between ZigBee\
    \ [44] and our proposed module HC12\nat a given packet size. Packet loss is nearly\
    \ the same, but the communication range is considerably\nhigher in our system,\
    \ which is the most important aspect of our application. Although its network\n\
    latency is remarkably higher than that of ZigBee, our application is still acceptable\
    \ because the nodes\nonly report a small amount of data once a day. The proposed\
    \ module outperforms the existing approach.\nSensors 2020, 20, 2367\n15 of 18\n\

    This work proposes an information monitoring approach for collecting ﬁeld data\
    \ over long\ndistances, which can be used in a fully automated agricultural farm.\
    \ In this system, a network\nmechanism for HC12 module is designed to enhance\
    \ the communication range. An experiment in\nan actual farm shows that the system\
    \ performs better on soil measurement in a wide area. The test\ncases indicate\
    \ that the system runs stably and accurately. As indicated in the results, the\
    \ point-to-point\ndistance is 250 m, which increases to 750 m when two intermediate\
    \ nodes are added. The proposed\napproach supersedes existing works in terms of\
    \ lower deployment cost and better communication\nrange. Network performance is\
    \ somehow better than existing approaches, except for latency, which\nis not a\
    \ requirement for the target application. A long-term test is performed to check\
    \ the real-time\ncollection of ﬁeld data, which results in accurate ﬁeld status\
    \ updates. Lastly, the proposed approach\ncan be used as a reference model for\
    \ any type of wide-area information monitoring system.\nThe transmission time\
    \ delay can be considered a limitation factor if the system is implemented in\n\
    applications where data speed is equally important. Nevertheless, low cost and\
    \ distance coverage\nare more important than data speed in the agricultural context.\n\
    The proposed system uses a single wireless channel for the entire network communication.\n\
    Multi-channelization can be applied by dividing the network into clusters. Each\
    \ cluster will use two\ndifferent channels: one for the gateway and one for its\
    \ child nodes. By implementing multi-channelization,\nthe gateway will no longer\
    \ wait for each node response; hence, delay time at the gateway can be\nconsiderably\
    \ decreased. The limitation of sensor node failure due to a static parent node\
    \ can also be\neliminated by using a mesh scenario wherein each node will have\
    \ a multipath toward its parent node.\nLastly, system scalability on a large network\
    \ can also be checked using a simulator.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    Abstract [1] Estimation of evapotranspiration using satellite sensors offers the
    potential for improved water management in irrigated areas. However, previous
    applications of remote sensing to estimate crop water use have been retrospective
    in nature, whereas the spatial resolution of sensors that provide information
    in real time has been thought to be too coarse for such purposes. We describe
    application of a variation of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
    (MODIS) standard evapotranspiration algorithm for near-real-time method for estimation
    of actual evapotranspiration based entirely on satellite data. The latency of
    the approach is typically 3 days to 1 week, although the lag could be reduced.
    The method works best over areas where there is substantial diversity in vegetation
    types within the remote sensing window; the contrast in vegetation between irrigated
    and adjacent unirrigated areas meets this requirement well. The satellite sensors/products
    are MODIS land cover (MOD12Q1), surface reflectance (MOD09GQ), vegetation indices
    (MOD13Q1), land surface temperature/emissivity (MOD11A1), and albedo (MCD43A3)
    and NOAA/NESDIS surface radiation budget (SRB) products derived from the Geostationary
    Operational Environmental Satellites. The MODIS/SRB evapotranspiration estimates
    agree favorably with ground flux tower observations and evapotranspiration estimates
    from a much higher resolution Landsat-based (METRIC) method over irrigated areas
    of the Klamath River Basin, with instantaneous evapotranspiration biases less
    than 10% and daily evapotranspiration biases less than 15%. There is a tendency
    for the MODIS/SRB approach to underestimate, and for the METRIC-based algorithm
    to overestimate, seasonal evapotranspiration relative to the tower flux observations.
    1. Introduction [2] Over most of the global land area, evapotranspiration (ET)
    is the second largest (after precipitation) component of the water cycle. It is
    a product of complex interactions among atmospheric demand, and soil and vegetation
    conditions which control supply. In general, ET is poorly observed as compared
    with the other major terms in the surface water balance, and for this reason,
    it is often estimated either by difference in land surface and atmospheric water
    budgets, or through use of predictive models. From the standpoint of water management,
    irrigation is by far the largest human consumptive use of water globally [e.g.,
    Döll and Siebert, 2002], however its estimation is often complicated by the fact
    that irrigation return flows are poorly observed. Implementation of improved irrigation
    practices requires high-quality observations of crop water use, and analytical
    tools for developing feasible alternative scenarios [Prajamwong et al., 1997;
    Cai et al., 2003; Lecina and Playan, 2006]. To date, the former has been based
    mostly on in situ observations. Furthermore, most water management models assume
    that the consumptive use of water for irrigation is fixed and ignore interannual
    variations, instead taking estimates from, for instance, water rights allocations
    [e.g., Hamlet and Lettenmaier, 1999; Christensen et al., 2004]. Better estimation
    of ET presumably could lead to more efficient use of water, especially in arid
    and semiarid areas [Budyko, 1974; Sala et al., 1992; Milly, 1994; Reynolds et
    al., 2000; Bouwer et al., 2007]. [3] Crop water use depends on surface atmospheric
    conditions, crop characteristics, and the type of irrigation (e.g., sprinkler
    versus flood), as well as soil moisture where ET is not occurring freely. Traditionally,
    crop water use has been computed from meteorological data and pan evaporation
    measurements [Allen et al., 1998]. Because point measurements are generally valid
    only locally, ET so computed is usually relative to reference crops transpiring
    freely (that is, at the potential rate), rather than actual ET, which can vary
    spatially over fairly short length scales, especially in the presence of topographic
    and/or soil variations. For these reasons, it is difficult using traditional methods
    to estimate space-time variations in crop water use based on point observations
    of meteorological quantities. [4] Satellite remote sensing provides a promising
    alternative to estimation of crop water use as it represents directly the spatial
    variation in ET at spatial scales ranging from local to regional. A number of
    different methods have been developed to use satellite remote sensing data for
    ET estimation [Carlson et al., 1995; Bastiaanssen et al., 1998a, 1998b, 2005;
    Courault et al., 2005; Nagler et al., 2005; Allen et al., 2007a, 2007b; Cleugh
    et al., 2007; Mu et al., 2007; Tang et al., 2007]. Most of these studies have
    used some combination of remote sensing estimates of surface radiation, temperature,
    and vegetation properties, and ground-based surface and atmospheric observations
    to estimate latent heat flux as a residual in a surface energy balance. Some of
    these schemes have been used successfully for estimation of ET from irrigated
    areas and to infer net groundwater pumping for irrigation [see, e.g., Tasumi et
    al., 2005; Allen et al., 2005; Consoli et al., 2006]. A major drawback of most
    of these schemes is that they require some surface meteorological data, the availability
    of which is often limited especially in near real time. The resulting estimates
    of ET, while useful for planning studies for which retrospective estimates are
    sufficient, do not have the potential for use in near-real-time water management
    decision making. [5] A method known as the VI-Ts method can be implemented in
    a way that avoids the requirement for surface meteorological data. It is based
    on the combination of vegetation index (VI) and surface temperature (Ts), both
    of which can be retrieved from satellite remote sensing [Nemani and Running, 1989;
    Carlson et al., 1995; Gillies et al., 1997; Jiang and Islam, 2001]. In the VI-Ts
    method, a scatterplot of VI versus Ts shows a linear or triangular form with a
    negative correlation between VI and Ts. Dense vegetation with higher VI has lower
    Ts. Bare soil and sparse vegetation becomes warmer relative to vegetation with
    higher VI values as the surface becomes drier. The VI-Ts diagram algorithm can
    be applied in a way that avoids the requirement for in situ observations of surface
    temperature by using remotely sensed radiative surface temperature rather than
    in situ measurements. An important requirement of the VI-Ts method is that adequate
    contrast in conditions (that is, variations in VI and Ts) exist over the area
    to which the algorithm is to be applied [Roerink et al., 2000; Courault et al.,
    2005]. The VI-Ts method is problematic if the vegetation and/or surface temperature
    variations over the remote sensing window have a small range of variation. This
    limits the use of the method over relatively homogeneous surfaces such as desert
    and some forest types. Tang et al. [2007] tested the VI-Ts method using AmeriFlux
    tower observations in California. Their results show that while there are substantial
    discrepancies in instantaneous estimation of ET at sites in savanna and forest
    ecosystems, the long-term biases can be significantly reduced for long averaging
    times. In any event, the VI-Ts method is expected to work best over areas where
    there is substantial diversity in vegetation types within the remote sensing window.
    One condition where this restriction is well met is the substantial contrast in
    VI and Ts across the interface between irrigated cropland and surrounding areas;
    hence in principle the method should be well suited for estimation of irrigated
    crop water use. [6] This paper uses a variation of the VI-Ts algorithm of Nishida
    et al. [2003], applied using MODIS-based VI and Ts, with particular attention
    to irrigated areas and near-real-time estimation. The method does not require
    surface meteorological data. The satellite sensors/products are MODIS land cover
    (MOD12Q1), surface reflectance (MOD09GQ), vegetation indices (MOD13Q1), land surface
    temperature/emissivity (MOD11A1), and albedo (MCD43A3), and NOAA/NESDIS surface
    radiation budget (SRB) products derived from the Geostationary Operational Environmental
    Satellites (GOES). The NOAA/NESDIS SRB data have a latency of 2 days from real
    time. The effective latency of our approach is determined by the MODIS products
    which typically are available within 3 days to 1 week of real time, although this
    could be reduced by use of MODIS Rapid Response data. The details of the implementation
    are described in the following section. 2. Methodology [7] Figure 1 summarizes
    the VI-Ts method as we have implemented it. A key assumption of the method is
    that the evaporative fraction (EF [Shuttleworth et al., 1989]), defined as the
    ratio of ET to available energy Q, is nearly constant. The constant EF hypothesis
    is robust although variably cloudy weather and proximity to surface discontinuities
    or fronts may cause significant variability in the EF [Sugita and Brutsaert, 1991;
    Brutsaert and Sugita, 1992; Nichols and Cuenca, 1993; Crago, 1996]. Hoedjes et
    al. [2008] found that EF is almost constant under dry conditions, but has a pronounced
    concave upward shape under wet conditions in semiarid Morocco. Gentine et al.
    [2007] showed that EF is almost independent of the major forcing factors, namely,
    incoming solar radiation and wind speed, due to compensating effects that are
    traced to the elements of EF itself, although these compensating effects can have
    strong dependence on soil moisture availability and canopy cover. They also find
    that the soil component of EF is less variable than is the vegetation component.
    The constant EF hypothesis allows instantaneous estimates of the evaporative fraction
    at MODIS overpass times to be extrapolated to estimate daily average ET, if Q
    can be estimated. By energy conservation, Q equals net radiation (Rn) minus soil
    heat flux (G). Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Flowchart of the processes
    (rectangles) and variables (italics) in the ET estimation algorithm. [8] The landscape
    is simplified as a mixture of vegetation and bare soil. The proportion of vegetation,
    fveg whose value is between 0 and 1, is related to normalized difference vegetation
    index (NDVI): where NDVI is defined as a ratio of red reflectance (Rred) and near-infrared
    reflectance (Rnir): NDVImax and NDVImin are the NDVI of full vegetation and bare
    soil. Intercalibration of NDVI from MODIS and AVHRR by Steven et al. [2003] resulted
    in the estimate MODIS NDVI = 1.103 × NOAA/AVHRR NDVI + 0.004 [Sun et al., 2007].
    We therefore used NDVImax of 0.83 and NDVImin of 0.22 for MODIS data, based on
    NDVImax of 0.75 and NDVImin of 0.2 for NOAA/AVHRR data [Nishida et al., 2003].
    For near-real-time implementation, we calculated NDVI from MODIS daily surface
    reflectance data (MOD09GQ) using an 8-day maximum compositing method, while the
    16-day maximum compositing vegetation index product (MOD13Q1) is used as auxiliary
    data for retrospective estimation [Huete et al., 1994; Vermote and Vermeulen,
    1999]. NDVI evolves over time scales that are slow enough that use of the 8-day
    (lagging) composite rather than a central 8-day window, which would be used for
    retrospective analysis, dues not make much difference. Assuming a negligible coupled
    energy transfer between vegetation and ET from bare soil, ET from a pixel is estimated
    as a linear combination of ET from vegetation and ET from bare soil: where ETveg
    and ETsoil are ET from vegetation and ET from bare soil, respectively. Combining
    the definition of EF and equation (3), the EF of a pixel is: where the subscripts
    “veg” and “soil” denote vegetation and bare soil, respectively. Evaporation fraction
    for vegetation is calculated as: where α is the Priestley-Taylor parameter, which
    we set to 1.26 [De Bruin, 1983]; Δ is the slope of the saturated vapor pressure
    in term of temperature (Pa K−1); and γ is the psychometric constant (Pa K−1).
    rc is surface resistance of the vegetation canopy (s m−1), estimated following
    Jarvis [1976] as: where Ta is air temperature (°C); PAR is photosynthetic active
    radiation (μ mol m−2 s−1); VPD is the vapor pressure deficit (Pa); ψ is leaf water
    potential (Pa); rcMIN is the minimum resistance (s m−1). rcuticle is the canopy
    resistance related to diffusion through the cuticle layer of leaves which we set
    to 100,000 (s m−1) following the Biome-BGC model [White et al., 2000]. In equation
    (6), only temperature and PAR can be estimated from satellite data and radiative
    transfer calculations, leaving terms in VPD, ψ and CO2 to be estimated from other
    sources. Following Nishida et al. [2003], we drop the terms in VPD, ψ and CO2
    (f2, f4 and f5), which avoids the need for data sources other than satellite.
    PAR data were taken from the NOAA/NESDIS SRB product, as was downward solar radiation.
    Following Jarvis [1976]: where Tn, To, Tx are minimum, optimal and maximum temperatures
    for stomatal activity, and set to be 2.7, 31.1, and 45.3°C respectively. A is
    a parameter related to photon absorption efficiency at low light intensity which
    we set to 152 (μ mol m−2 s−1). Aerodynamic resistance ra was calculated following
    empirical formulae [Kondo, 2000]: where U50m and U1m are wind speed at 50 m and
    1 m heights, respectively (m s−1). Wind speed was inferred from the aerodynamic
    resistance of bare soil (1/ra soil = 0.0015U1m) which in turn was estimated using
    methods outlined below. The land cover for bare soil, forest, grassland, and cropland
    was obtained from the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) land
    cover in the MODIS Land Cover Classification products (MOD12Q1) [Belward et al.,
    1999]. The classification schemes used in that data set are multitemporal classifications
    describing land cover properties as observed during 2004. The evaporative fraction
    for bare soil was estimated as: where Tsoil max is the estimated maximum possible
    bare soil surface temperature; Tsoil is bare soil surface temperature, Qsoil 0
    is the available energy when Tsoil is equal to Ta (W m−2); Qsoil is available
    energy over bare soil surface (W m−2). The temperatures Tsoil max, Tsoil, and
    Ta are estimated using the VI-Ts diagram [Nemani and Running, 1989; Nishida et
    al., 2003]. The surface temperature Ts is obtained from MODIS land surface temperature
    (LST) product MOD11A1. For days when the retrieval LST is unavailable (mostly
    because of cloudy conditions), the LST for the closest available day is used instead.
    About one third of the LST data are unavailable during the study period. This
    may introduce errors because the surface temperature can have large day-to-day
    variations. However, small day-to-day variations of EF and energy conservation
    effectively constrain errors from this source. Although the MODIS LST product
    has a latency of 3 days to 1 week, The MODIS Rapid Response (RR) System provides
    LST within a few hours of satellite overpass. The biases of MODIS RR LST are generally
    small despite the presence of some larger outliers [Pinheiro et al., 2007]. Therefore,
    although we used the MODIS standard products, the time lag of the approach could
    be significantly reduced. Tsoil max is assumed to occur when ET is zero, in which
    case: where ρ is the air density (kg m−3); CP is the specific heat of air under
    constant pressure (J kg−1 K−1) [Allen et al., 1998]. Equation (11) was used to
    retrieve aerodynamic resistance of bare soil (ra soil) and in turn the inferred
    wind speed [Kondo, 2000; Nishida et al., 2003]. [9] In our application, VI and
    Ts come from twice daily EOS Terra overpasses at around 1100 and 2130 local time
    (LT). Rather than estimating instantaneous downward shortwave radiation from MODIS-based
    cloud data (MOD09GA), we use hourly NOAA/NESDIS surface radiation budget (SRB)
    products derived from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES),
    in particular, the hourly NOAA/NESDIS SRB product [Pinker and Laszlo, 1992; Menzel
    and Purdom, 1994]. The instantaneous radiation data are provided hourly at 15
    min after the hour (e.g., 0115, 0215 UTC…). The closest instantaneous radiation
    to the MODIS overpass time is used for the instantaneous ET estimation. Reflected
    solar radiation was based on the MODIS albedo product MCD43A3 [Jin et al., 2003a,
    2003b; Wan et al., 2004]. Emitted longwave radiation was computed using the MODIS
    surface temperature interpolated to hourly values using a sine-cosine fit as in
    the work by Allen [1976], which was applied also to the MODIS surface emissivity
    product MOD11A1 [Jin and Liang, 2006]. Downward longwave radiation was computed
    by assuming the effective atmospheric temperature for emitted longwave radiation
    is 20 K lower than air temperature following Kondo [2000]. On a daily scale, the
    soil heat flux (G) can be neglected and was set to zero [Seguin and Itier, 1983].
    For purposes of instantaneous available energy estimation, G over the full vegetated
    part of the pixel was assumed to be small, and G for bare soil part was computed
    as a proportion (CG) of the net radiation where CG is an empirical coefficient
    of 0.4 [Idso et al., 1975]. 3. Study Area and Data [10] Our study area is a cropland
    area (part of which is irrigated and part of which is nonirrigated) of the Upper
    Klamath River Basin (Figure 2). The Klamath River drains an arid interior basin
    along the Oregon-California border in its upper reaches, and then passes through
    a gorge in the Coast Range before emptying into the Pacific Ocean. The Klamath
    River Basin has become a focal point for local and national discussions on water
    management and water scarcity [Powers et al., 2005] following well publicized
    controversies over the last several years associated with competition among water
    users, mostly irrigators, Native Americans, and fish and aquatic habitat interests.
    Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Upper Klamath River Basin study area
    showing irrigated fields (IFs) and nonirrigated fields (NIFs) and locations of
    observation sites KL03 and KL04. [11] Two Bowen ratio measurement systems were
    operated by the second, third and fourth authors at sites designated KL03 and
    KL04 within the study domain from April to October 2004. KL03 (42°37′43.4″, −121°57′17.8″)
    is situated in a nonirrigated field, whereas KL04 (42°43′11.9″, −122°0′41.3″)
    is in irrigated cropland (Figure 2). The stations are located so as to have uniform
    vegetative conditions in the predominant upwind direction, i.e., on the order
    of 500 to 1,000 m. Thus the vertical gradients of air temperature and relative
    humidity tend to be stable at any point in time. Both sites also include soil
    heat flux plates (HFP01SC, Huskeflux, Delft, The Netherlands), net radiometers
    (Q7.1, REBS, Portland, OR), fine wire thermocouples (TCBR-3, Campbell Scientific
    Inc., Logan, UT), soil temperature sensors (TCAV, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan,
    UT), soil moisture sensors (CS616, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, UT) and infrared
    gas analyzers (LI-6262, LI-COR Inc, Lincoln, NE). (See Cuenca and Mahrt [2004]
    for a more complete description.) The data were aggregated to 20-min intervals
    for all components of the energy balance. We acquired the data required to run
    the Nishida et al. [2003] algorithm as described in 2 for the same period (1 April
    to 31 October 2004) for which the field observations were available. [12] For
    comparison purposes, we implemented a slight modification of the METRIC algorithm
    of Allen et al. [2007b], which is in turn based on the SEBAL algorithm of Bastiaanssen
    et al. [1998a]. Both SEBAL and METRIC use VI and Ts information from high-resolution
    Landsat data (typically order of 30 m, as contrasted with 250 to 1,000 m for MODIS),
    but they do not use the VI-Ts relationship as does the Nishida et al. [2003] algorithm.
    Instead, NDVI is used to estimate surface emissivity and Ts is used for estimation
    of outgoing longwave radiation, soil heat flux, momentum roughness length and
    Monin-Obukov stability length scale using semiempirical and theoretical relationships.
    Although Landsat data are not available in near real time, and the revisit time
    is much longer than for MODIS (16 days in the case of Landsat 7 versus daily for
    MODIS), they do provide a useful basis for comparing the MODIS-based algorithm
    that we apply in near real time. [13] Landsat images were used for the METRIC-based
    ET estimates. The study area is located in Path45/Row30 of the Landsat images.
    The images were collected in Scan Line Corrector (SLC)–off mode on 22 April, 25
    June, 27 July and 28 August 2004. The image on 22 April was partially impaired
    by snow cover. The seasonal ET in the crop growth period from 11 April to 7 October
    was estimated by linearly interpolating the reference ET fraction values (ETcrop/ETref)
    for periods between consecutive satellite images, and multiplying by observed
    ETref. [14] Our strategy for evaluation of the near-real-time approach was (1)
    to compare the MODIS/SRB approach with the Bowen Ratio ET observations by extracting
    the MODIS grid cell within which the observation sites lie from the seasonal (daily)
    ET estimates for summer 2004 and (2) to compare the spatial variability of ET
    estimates at the MODIS spatial resolution for the MODIS/SRB estimates and the
    METRIC-based estimates on the days during summer 2004 for which there were Landsat
    retrievals. On these days, we compared both the inferred instantaneous ET estimates
    from the MODIS/SRB approach with METRIC-based, as well as the inferred daily averages.
    The MODIS AM overpass is usually at about 1100 LT whereas the Landsat overpass
    is at 1139 LT; therefore direct comparison of the two instantaneous estimates
    is feasible. 4. Results [15] We first compared the downward shortwave radiation
    (Rd) at the KL03 and KL04 tower sites with the NOAA/NESDIS SRB product at the
    Terra overpass times. The shortwave radiation from NOAA/NESDIS SRB product is
    generally in agreement with the flux tower measurements, especially in the seasonal
    mean. The biases are −4% and −3% of the averaged downward shortwave radiation
    (data not shown) at the KL03 and KL04 sites, respectively. The root mean squared
    errors, however, were quite large (181 and 164 W m−2, or 25% and 23% of the mean
    values at each site, respectively). Relatively large differences in the instantaneous
    values are not surprising given the 0.5 degree spatial resolution of the SRB product,
    which is being compared with point observations. Figure 3 compares the daily mean
    downward shortwave radiation from the NOAA/NESDIS SRB products and observations
    at KL03 and KL04 sites. The fact that the daily root mean square errors (RMSEs)
    are much lower as a fraction of the mean (13% and 12% for KL03 and KL04, respectively)
    confirms that the agreement is much better as the averaging time increases, and
    implies that agreement of the MODIS/SRB and observed ET should improve with averaging
    time as well. Figure 4 compares the daily mean net radiation from the MODIS/SRB
    estimates and observations at KL03 and KL04 sites. The RMSEs are 15% and 14% of
    the mean of KL03 and KL04, respectively. The net radiation is slightly overestimated.
    The correlation coefficient (R2) between the flux tower observation and MODIS/SRB
    estimates are 0.87 and 0.90 for KL03 and KL04, respectively. Figure 3 Open in
    figure viewer PowerPoint Comparison of daily downward shortwave radiation from
    the NOAA/NESDIS SRB products and observations at KL03 and KL04 sites from 1 April
    to 31 October 2004. (a and b) KL03 and (c and d) KL04. Mean values and RMSEs over
    the period are given in the plots. Figure 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Comparison
    of daily net radiation from the MODIS/SRB estimates and observations at KL03 and
    KL04 sites from 1 April to 31 October 2004. (a and b) KL03 and (c and d) KL04.
    Mean values and RMSEs over the period are given in the plots. [16] Figure 5 compares
    instantaneous ET observations with the MODIS/SRB estimates at the MODIS overpass
    times and for the MODIS pixels within which the measurement sites lie. Observed
    ET values are similar for both the KL03 (nonirrigated) and KL04 (irrigated) sites
    at the beginning of the crop growth season because the soil is close to saturation
    in the spring and the groundwater table is close to the surface. The observations
    begin to diverge through the summer as the nonirrigated site dries out. Figures
    5a and 5c show that the MODIS/SRB approach compares favorably with the ET observations
    over most of the evaluation period. Figure 5a indicates, however, that the MODIS/SRB
    approach does not match the ET observations in mid-April, which may in part have
    to do with some remaining snow cover, and/or locally standing water during that
    time. METRIC-based results (when available) agree favorably with the instantaneous
    ET observations. In general, the error statistics reported in Figure 5 show that
    performance of the satellite-based method is similar for both clear-sky and cloudy
    conditions at both sites. Figure 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Comparisons
    of instantaneous ET (at MODIS overpass times at around 1100 LT) estimated using
    the MODIS/SRB approach with observations. METRIC-based estimates are also shown
    on dates for which Landsat imagery was available. (a and b) KL03 and (c and d)
    KL04. The blue dots in Figures 5b and 5d indicate clear-sky conditions as specified
    by the NOAA/NESDIS SRB products. Mean values and RMSEs over the period are given
    in the plots. [17] Figure 6 compares daily mean ET from observations, and the
    MODIS/SRB approach and METRIC-based estimates (when available). The daily mean
    ET is calculated from daily mean available energy and instantaneous EF at the
    time of satellite overpasses using the constant EF hypothesis. The RMSE of the
    MODIS/SRB approach is generally less for the daily mean ET than for the instantaneous
    ET. The performance for clear-sky and cloudy conditions is similar, suggesting
    that cloud effects on radiation partitioning are reasonably well accounted for
    by the NOAA/NESDIS SRB products. The results also imply that the lack of remote
    sensing land surface temperature under cloudy conditions does not detract much
    from the ET estimation performance. As expected, the estimated ET rate at the
    irrigated site KL04 is generally larger than that at the nonirrigated site KL03,
    especially following the dry-down of the nonirrigated site from wet spring conditions.
    The performance of ET estimates at the irrigated site is similar as that at the
    nonirrigated site. Figure 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Comparisons of daily
    mean ET from observations, MODIS/SRB approach, and METRIC-based estimates (when
    available). The time series and scatterplot comparison at (a and b) KL03 site
    and (c and d) KL04. The blue dots in Figures 6b and 6d indicate clear-sky conditions.
    Mean values and RMSEs over the period are given in the plots. [18] Figure 7 shows
    the measured instantaneous EF (20 min interval during which the satellite overpass
    occurred) and daily mean EF at the KL03 and KL04 sites. The mean instantaneous
    EF is 0.51 and the mean day EF is 0.58 at the KL03 site. The day EF is 14% larger
    than the instantaneous EF, which suggests that the MODIS/SRB approach, which applies
    an instantaneous EF to the entire day, may result in a downward bias in its daily
    ET estimates. Figure 6 shows that the averaged ET values from the MODIS/SRB approach
    are less than observations for both KL03 and KL04 sites, and therefore the assumption
    of constant daily EF should have contributed to underestimation of daily ET in
    the MODIS/SRB approach. Figure 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Measured instantaneous
    and daily mean EF at the KL03 and KL04. The time series and scatterplot comparison
    at (a and b) KL03 and (c and d) KL04. Mean values and RMSEs over the period are
    given in the plots. [19] The daily mean ET maps from the MODIS/SRB approach and
    METRIC-based approach are shown in Figure 8. The MODIS/SRB and METRIC-based estimates
    show similar spatial and temporal variations for both irrigated and nonirrigated
    fields at a broad level; for instance, estimated ET at nonirrigated site KL03
    is less than that irrigated site KL04 for both methods and all three dates. On
    25 June, the MODIS/SRB approach gives higher ET values in the irrigated field.
    On 27 July, the MODIS/SRB shows similar patterns as the METRIC-based map in the
    irrigated and nonirrigated fields. Both maps show lower ET values in the southern
    nonirrigated field although the lowest value of METRIC-based ET is lower than
    the MODIS/SRB ET in this region. The lower ET values in the southern nonirrigated
    field are captured by the MODIS/SRB approach and METRIC-based approach on 28 August.
    METRIC-based ET is generally larger than from MODIS/SRB in the irrigated fields
    on 28 August. Figure 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Spatial distribution of
    daily ET and difference between MODIS/SRB and METRIC-based approach for the region
    shown in Figure 2 on 25 June, 27 July, and 28 August 2004. Irrigated and nonirrigated
    areas are as shown in Figure 2. [20] Table 1 summarizes the seasonal ET at the
    two Bowen ratio stations, as compared with METRIC-based (linearly interpolated
    to the season) and MODIS/SRB. The estimation using the METRIC-based approach was
    made by maintaining the crop ET (satellite-based) to reference ET (ground-based)
    ratio (ETcrop/ETref) constant until the next satellite overpass, multiplying by
    the daily ETref and summing the results. The ETcrop/ETref ratio was adjusted at
    the time of the next satellite overpass and the procedure repeated until the end
    of the growing season. The METRIC-based approach overestimates ET by 20% at the
    KL03 station relative to the Bowen ratio observations and 5% at the KL04 site.
    The MODIS/SRB approach underestimates evapotranspiration by about 14% at both
    the KL03 and KL04 sites. The underestimation of the MODIS/SRB approach appears
    to be the result primarily of downward bias in EF resulting from the assumption
    of constant EF throughout the day, and to a lesser extent, downward bias in downward
    shortwave radiation. Overestimation by the METRIC-based approach occurs because
    of the small number of satellite images used, which are for clear sky conditions.

    domain. Aside from the higher seasonal values inferred from the METRIC-based clear
    sky dates relative to MODIS/SRB, there is no obvious difference in the results,
    which have differences in the absolute mean of around 1 mm d−1. Figure 9 Open

    5. Application to Regional Near-Real-Time ET Monitoring [22] The approach outlined
    above was extended into a regional near-real-time ET estimation system for the
    crop areas and grassland of northern California and southern Oregon, specifically
    the region between 37.5 N to 44 N latitude and west of longitude 119.5 W. We define
    the cropland and grassland areas according to the IGBP land cover from MODIS Land
    Cover Classification products MOD12Q1. Our rationale for including both cropland
    and grassland is that there is some likelihood of misclassification between croplands
    and grasslands, but less so between these categories and forest, or related classifications
    such as woodland. [23] For this purpose, near-real-time MODIS data products were
    extracted from the Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC)
    at the USGS EROS Data Center. NCEP surface downward shortwave radiation data were
    obtained from NOAA/NESDIS SRB data set which are archived and distributed at the
    University of Maryland. We used NDVI calculated from MODIS surface reflectance
    data (MOD09GQ) which is available with a lag of about 3 days from real time. [24]
    The temporal and spatial variability of ET in the crop areas and grassland is
    of particular interest. Figure 10 shows the evaporative fraction EF, instantaneous
    evapotranspiration (ETins) at the Terra AM overpass time of about 1100 LT, and
    daily mean evapotranspiration (ETday) estimates for 20 May 2008, 25 May 2008,
    2 June 2008, and 20 June 2008. There were summer storms over the region around
    25 May and little precipitation before 20 May and after 2 June. The ETins and
    ETday on 25 May were observed to be smaller than those on 20 May before storms
    in the southern part of the region. The ETins and ETday rates became large again
    on 2 June after the storm, although the evaporative fraction EF did not show significant
    changes. This implies that the available energy was reduced during the storms
    because of the cloud effects. The relatively high ET persists over the southern
    part of the domain and extends to northeast highlands on 2 June. The lower ET
    rate in the northeast highlands before the storm is likely due to the small evaporative
    fraction. The small evaporative fraction probably was the result of soil moisture
    stress. Soil moisture stress should have been reduced by the storm and the higher
    ET rate over the northeast highlands is the result. The spatial distribution of
    the final products of ETins and ETday are fairly similar to the distribution of
    the evaporative fraction EF at the regional scale. This implies that the spatial
    distribution of available energy has less impact on regional-scale ET spatial
    variability. However, there are considerable anomalies in ET patterns in comparison
    to the evaporative fraction EF in the southern part of the domain on 25 May. The
    anomaly indicates that the spatial pattern of available energy can substantially
    affect prestorm and poststorm ET spatial variability. Figure 10 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Evaporative fraction EF, instantaneous evapotranspiration (ETins),
    and daily evapotranspiration (ETday) for 22 May 2008, 25 May 2008, 30 May 2008,
    and 17 June 2008 over cropland and grassland. 6. Summary and Conclusions [25]
    We have illustrated a satellite-based method for near-real-time estimation of
    actual ET appropriate for application at regional scales which uses MODIS land
    cover, surface reflectance, vegetation indices, land surface temperature/emissivity,
    and albedo. Downward shortwave radiation is taken from a satellite based insolation
    algorithm, NOAA/NESDIS SRB product, with reflected shortwave radiation computed
    using MODIS albedo, and downward and emitted longwave radiation based on MODIS
    surface temperature and emissivity. ET is computed on a pixel by pixel basis for
    the instantaneous time of the satellite image and is scaled to daily averaged
    ET using an assumption of constant (daily) evaporative fraction. [26] In comparisons
    with surface Bowen ratio station observations at the time of satellite overpasses,
    the instantaneous ET differences between the MODIS-based system and ground observations
    are less than 10% on average. Daily mean ET differences between the operational
    system and the ground observations are less than 15%. The time series of daily
    ET is captured by the MODIS/SRB approach. [27] For both instantaneous and daily
    mean estimates, the MODIS/SRB approach agrees favorably with a Landsat-based model,
    METRIC. METRIC-based results overestimate seasonal ET by about 19% at the nonirrigated
    site and 5% at the irrigated site, whereas MODIS/SRB underestimates ET by about
    14% at both the nonirrigated and irrigated sites relative to Bowen ratio station
    observations. The reason for the underestimate of the MODIS/SRB approach appears
    to be related primarily to downward bias in the estimated evaporative fraction
    resulting from the assumption of constant EF over the day; this source of bias
    could be corrected. [28] The MODIS/SRB approach offers substantial potential for
    operational application given that both the MODIS and GOES based products are
    available in near real time. The latency of the approach (typically 3 days to
    1 week) is controlled by release of the MODIS products, but could be reduced substantially
    through use of MODIS Rapid Response products, in which case latency would be controlled
    by the lag of about 2 days in the SRB products. The approach is well suited to
    use in irrigated areas where the contrast in vegetation and surface temperature
    across the irrigated-unirrigated interface results in the VI-Ts plot being well
    populated, and hence a key assumption of the method being met. It is less useful
    in regions with relatively homogeneous vegetation/land cover surfaces such as
    desert and some forest conditions. Furthermore, as we have applied the method,
    no surface observations are required. The near-real-time spatially distributed
    maps of crop water use produced by a quasi-operational version of the system (http://www.hydro.washington.edu/forecast/rset_ca/)
    are expected to be useful in operational hydrological applications such as regional-scale
    water resources and irrigation management. Acknowledgments [29] The work described

  analysis: "The paper constructs a low-cost, automated irrigation system for green\
    \ walls using open-source technologies. It discusses data types appropriate for\
    \ irrigation management, describes the use of various sensors to measure these\
    \ types of data, and evaluates the performance of the system. \n\nThe system measures\
    \ soil moisture, temperature, relative humidity, and light intensity, and uses\
    \ this data to control the flow of water to the plants. The system is also able\
    \ to store and transmit data to a remote server, which allows users to monitor\
    \ the system's performance and make adjustments as needed.\n\nThe authors evaluate\
    \ the system's performance by comparing it to a commercial irrigation system.\
    \ They find that the low-cost system performs as well as the commercial system,\
    \ but at a much lower cost. The authors conclude that the low-cost system is a\
    \ viable alternative to commercial irrigation systems for green walls."

    \ wall irrigation procedures are a particularly important and hard task, given\
    \ that\nthe quality of the green wall depends on them. There is currently a wide\
    \ variety of irrigation\nprogrammers available, with a range of functions and\
    \ prices, thereby replacing manual activities\nand making it easier to maintain\
    \ green walls. This paper proposes the use of low-cost automated\nirrigation programmers\
    \ via a freeware called Arduino. The system is based on air and substrate\nmeasurements\
    \ to ensure optimal plant growth and high water-use efﬁciency. At certain thresholds,\n\
    the irrigation system is activated. This not only makes irrigation more convenient\
    \ but also helps\nto reduce energy consumption, increases irrigation efﬁciency\
    \ and saves time. The data is then sent\nvia Transmission Control Protocol using\
    \ Internet of Things technology, in this case ThingSpeak.\nThe platform compiles\
    \ the data and presents them in simple graphical format, thus enabling real-time\n\
    monitoring from wherever there is Internet access. Together with Arduino, the\
    \ project incorporates\nthe Raspberry pi system that operates like a database\
    \ via Hypertext Transfer Protocol Wi-Fi received\nby a Structured Query Language\
    \ (MySQL) server using Hypertext Preprocessor. These data are used\nfor the subsequent\
    \ analysis of green wall performance.\nKeywords:\nsmart irrigation; green walls;\
    \ low-cost; Internet of Things; microcontroller and\nmicroprocessor; environmental\
    \ control\n1. Introduction\nThe current debate concerning climate change has encouraged\
    \ the use of plants to help mitigate\nsome of the problems associated with a lack\
    \ of green areas in cities, such as rising temperatures [1].\nThis lack of green\
    \ spaces has led to a reduction in evapotranspiration and the normal inﬁltration\
    \ of\nwater into the soil, creating a heat island effect in large cities. Green\
    \ walls have proven to be of beneﬁt\nby improving storm water management through\
    \ water retention and evapotranspiration. There are,\nhowever, other potential\
    \ advantages such as cleaner air, positive psychological effects, and aesthetic\n\
    improvements. Green walls (also referred to as green façades or vertical gardens)\
    \ provide a way of\nincreasing green spaces in urban areas.\nWith the progress\
    \ made in technology, the systems that we use daily have become ever-more\nautomated,\
    \ and green wall irrigation systems are no exception, given that this is a relatively\
    \ recent\ntechnology that is still under development. There are various irrigation\
    \ systems on the market that\nhave already been tested and implemented [2]. Common\
    \ drawbacks of these systems are that they\ntend to be expensive and often require\
    \ the user to control the water pump in situ [3].\nThe need to improve the irrigation\
    \ efﬁciency of green walls has resulted in the use of precision\nirrigation techniques.\
    \ Precision irrigation scheduling is based on determining the irrigation needs\
    \ of\nthe green wall in real time and specifying a location. These measurements\
    \ are recorded and used to\nactivate the irrigation system when a threshold in\
    \ the substrate water content is reached. Optimizing\nSustainability 2019, 11,\

    \ 2019, 11, 782\n2 of 17\nthe number of sensors and distances between them is\
    \ essential for obtaining representative estimations\nof the amount of available\
    \ water in the substrate at wall level.\nMonitoring the changes in substrate water\
    \ content in green walls at different depths provides\nkey information about the\
    \ plants’ water uptake rates and strategies. Variability between plants and\n\
    heterogeneity of the substrate results in spatial variability of soil water content.\
    \ Therefore, strategies to\nincrease water efﬁciency require water content information\
    \ with a high resolution in space as well as\ntime [4].\nThe most commonly used\
    \ equipment to monitor water in the substrate are soil water content\nsensors.\
    \ These sensors, which are buried at different depths and in multiple locations,\
    \ provide useful\ndata about water content in the green wall. Monitoring substrate\
    \ water content, together with the data\nfrom other sensors, plays an important\
    \ role in applications focused on the effective use of water in\ngreen walls.\
    \ The number of sensors and the distance between them are key to ensuring representative\n\
    estimations of the availability of water in the green wall substrate [5].\nThere\
    \ are currently high quality industrial devices available on the market; however,\
    \ they are\ncostly and complex, which has limited their adoption in green-wall\
    \ technology. In response, alternative\nlow-cost instruments have gradually been\
    \ developed [6].\nIn any field experiment, regardless of its particular objective\
    \ (in our case, green walls), air temperature\nand humidity are the environmental\
    \ parameters that are measured frequently as they indicate\nconditions affecting\
    \ plant phenology and growth. The need to take spatially distributed meteorological\n\
    measurements, especially in complex sites such as green walls, has given rise\
    \ to the development of\nlow-cost sensors, which are increasingly used to achieve\
    \ high spatial coverage [7].\nRecent breakthroughs in open-source hardware components\
    \ open the door to new ways of\ndeveloping smart irrigation systems that can connect\
    \ to transmission devices via the Internet, thus\nproviding high space-time data\
    \ coverage of substrate water and of other multiple sensors installed in\nthe\
    \ green walls [8].\nThere is growing need for multiplier devices, together with\
    \ the applicable technologies for\nstoring, recovering, and remotely transmitting\
    \ large volumes of data [9]. The wireless transmission\ntechnologies reviewed\
    \ [10] include Zigbee and Bluetooth communication protocols and modem-based\n\
    connections such as GPRS and GSM, often together with Internet applications [11].\n\
    The cost of data loggers and sensors limits the number of sensors and the frequency\
    \ of\nmeasurements. Recent breakthroughs in the ﬁeld of open hardware components\
    \ provide fresh\nopportunities to develop measuring stations that can connect\
    \ to wireless transmission devices to\nachieve high space-time data coverage with\
    \ multiple sensors. The philosophy behind open-source\nhardware, like open-source\
    \ software, is to provide free and transparent access to the design of hardware,\n\
    projects, and code so that users can easily share, customize, and update their\
    \ systems [12].\nA UNO microcontroller is used and is programmed to detect the\
    \ soil moisture levels or the\npresence of rain, and switch on the electro valve\
    \ relay when the soil moisture content is below or\nsurpasses the pre-set humidity\
    \ threshold based on plant requirements or switch it off in other cases or\nwhen\
    \ it is raining [3].\nA microcontroller is an electronic device within a pod containing\
    \ numerous components, such as\nresistors, condensers, etc., interconnected in\
    \ such a way that it can autonomously execute a series of\ninstructions speciﬁed\
    \ beforehand by a programmer. The microcontroller is the primary component of\n\
    the processing and control circuit [13].\nArduino microcontroller, which is a\
    \ physical open-source IT platform for developing interactive\nautonomous objects\
    \ or objects which connect to the computer, can be used. With Arduino both\nhardware\
    \ and software are open source [14]. A Raspberry Pi processor was also used, which\
    \ stored\nthe data from the three-month experimental period for the subsequent\
    \ analysis of the development of\nthe green wall. The project provides guidelines\
    \ for reproducing and updating a low-cost, customizable\nsmart irrigation system\
    \ for green walls.\nIt depends on open-source ideology, through which\nSustainability\
    \ 2019, 11, 782\n3 of 17\ninformation can be shared about the design of equipment\
    \ and software, thus facilitating the adoption\nand ongoing improvement of technologies\
    \ currently available on the market [15].\nWith the Arduino UNO chip, all the\
    \ electronic components and software to program the\nmicrocontroller are available\
    \ for free. The user-friendliness and simple programming are in keeping\nwith\
    \ the affordable prices of the electronic components, thus forming part of the\
    \ so-called democratized\ntechnological practice [16].\nThe automation system\
    \ will analyze the sensors and communicate the information collected\nvia the\
    \ Internet, where it can be easily browsed in real time in a graphic format through\
    \ the\nThingSpeak.com.\nAn essential aspect of this project is the web server;\
    \ in this case, one of the most popular Internet\ninfrastructure systems, LAMP,\
    \ is used. The name is taken from the acronym for Linux, Apache, MySQL,\nPHP.\
    \ It will operate on the Raspberry Pi [17].\nThe platform is equipped with low-cost\
    \ dielectric sensors currently available on the market, which\nfurther reduces\
    \ the cost of data acquisition. Measurements taken from a number of sites are\
    \ therefore\nmore affordable, enabling an increase in time-space data density\
    \ required for applications aiming\nto save water in green walls. Therefore, the\
    \ decision was made to use the Internet of Things (IoT)\ntechnology on green walls\
    \ and their irrigation systems and thus to be able to view the data in real time.\n\
    The aim is to ensure that the green wall is connected to the Internet and is accessible\
    \ from anywhere\nand by anyone who so wishes. The application of the Internet\
    \ of Things in precision irrigation can\nsave money and maximize the performance\
    \ of green walls.\nThe main objective of this work is to create an automated irrigation\
    \ system that is remotely\nsupervised and controlled from any mobile phone, computer,\
    \ or tablet with internet connection using\nlow cost materials that are easy to\
    \ program, install, and acquire as Arduino UNO and Raspberry Pi\nsystems, which\
    \ are responsible for automating irrigation and collecting environmental data\
    \ for green\nwall prototypes. Our hypothesis was to be able to implement low-cost\
    \ sensor technology to green\nwall systems.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Green\
    \ Wall Prototype Structure\nThe green wall prototype consists of 8 open-backed\
    \ boxes made using aluminum sheeting with\nelectro-welded mesh, and with a rear\
    \ bracket for ﬁxing them to an existing structure. The prototypes\nboxes are 1\
    \ m2 by 10 cm deep. They have been completely ﬁlled with two different types of\
    \ substrates,\nfour with sphagnum moss and four with coconut coir and rice husk,\
    \ south-facing green walls similar\nto commercially available products. The green\
    \ wall prototype was anchored in place next to the wall\nof a building with a\
    \ 5-cm separation to allow for air to freely circulate behind. They are located\
    \ on the\nRabanales Campus at the University of Cordoba, Spain (37◦54′51.3” N\
    \ 4◦43′28.5” W).\nThe green wall prototype uses a drip irrigation system. The\
    \ irrigation pipes are in the upper and\nmiddle areas of each module, with 4l/h\
    \ adjustable drippers every 20 cm along the pipe. The pipes in\neach of the rows\
    \ will irrigate from the top down to ensure that all the plants receive sufﬁcient\
    \ moisture.\nThe pipes are connected to an irrigation pump controlled by a relay,\
    \ which will enable it to supply\nwater to each of the green wall prototypes positioned\
    \ at the highest point above ground level, as can\nbe seen in Figure 1. Two different\
    \ species of plant material were selected based on the similar water\nrequirements,\
    \ Lampranthus spectabilis and Aptenia cordifolia [18], taking into account the\
    \ exposure\nto sunlight in the place where the green wall prototype was set up\
    \ and the ease of acquiring these\nplants locally.\nSustainability 2019, 11, 782\n\

    \ types of sensors to control an\nautomatic irrigation system. While other authors,\
    \ such as [4,24], have only used soil moisture sensors,\nin our case we also used\
    \ the rain sensor for the irrigation, as well as the storage in a microprocessor.\n\
    Also, while other authors such as [3,12,24,28], have used storage in SD cards\
    \ or just direct delivery to\nweb pages, in our case we used our own storage system\
    \ as a relational database management system\nMYSQL, to have a better and more\
    \ storage of data for its later analysis. Also, the project uses a web\neasy to\
    \ understand for the user which graphs in real time the data. Finally, the system\
    \ was applied\nin green walls which is a system of difﬁcult access because of\
    \ their location, giving a new use to the\nsystem of sensors of low cost.\nThe\
    \ total cost of the irrigation system and the database was about €58 (See Table\
    \ 2), making it\nless expensive compared to commercial components like the system\
    \ used in the prototype, which\nare around €200 without an Internet connection\
    \ or approximately €400 with one. Field installations\nSustainability 2019, 11,\
    \ 782\n14 of 17\nrequire other essential equipment such as plastic tubing, Ethernet\
    \ cable, a weatherproof electric cabinet\nand clamps. These costs (which together,\
    \ on average, come to under €50) are not listed in detail as\ndifferent materials\

    In this experiment, the Arduino microcontroller was used for very specialized\
    \ applications\nthat were adapted to the we need ins this project, enabling constant\
    \ monitoring of environmental\nparameters, such as temperature, relative humidity,\
    \ hours of sunlight, soil moisture, and ﬂow of water,\nto ensure ideal conditions\
    \ for the green wall.\nChoosing low-cost equipment does not mean reducing measurement\
    \ costs per se; rather, it means\nthat a greater data density is achieved for\
    \ the same value as a high-quality sensor. As a result, showed\nin our experiment,\
    \ the space-time variability of the green-wall development and processes can be\n\
    better covered.\nGiven that the prototype is located at the university, a cable\
    \ connection is used, though as a\ngeneral guideline. We suggest implementing\
    \ a wireless system, for future research orientations. In this\nway, Wi-Fi or\
    \ GSM systems can be installed in different places where there is no access to\
    \ wired\ninternet, and more sensors can be added covering more extensive areas\
    \ to have a more localized\ncontrol of irrigation.\nOur experiment can be applied\
    \ to any environmental control system, with precision irrigation\nbeing one of\
    \ the most important since it improves the management of water resources in areas\
    \ with\nlittle water.\nThe existing setup can be expanded in several ways: it\
    \ is possible to add new sensors like\nCO2, barometric pressure, conductivity\
    \ “nutrients,” water temperature, soil temperature sensors,\ncommunication modules,\
    \ etc; at the same time, users can decide how the information will be stored\n\
    or transmitted; they can also set up the Raspberry Pi to store and transmit information\
    \ considering a\nspeciﬁc time interval and also select the accuracy of data. Therefore,\
    \ the solution could be adapted to\nanother’s environmental projects.\nIndividual\
    \ users like researchers and farmers could use this system, collecting in-ﬁeld\
    \ data to\nimprove their production in another’s areas like agriculture or technologies\
    \ like living walls and share\ndata with their professional advisors. Likewise,\
    \ government agencies could use the system to monitor\nthe environmental parameters\
    \ and inﬂuences.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Y.A.R.-S.; Methodology,\

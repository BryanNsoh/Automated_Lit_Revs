    growth in world population, the demand for energy will continuously increase.
    Current power grids were built decades ago, and despite the fact that they are
    regularly upgraded, their capability to fulfill future demands is uncertain. Existing
    reserves of fossil fuels are limited and impose harmful emissions, making social
    and environmental implications and impact inevitable. The result of this current
    state is the transition of the traditional centralized grid towards a distributed
    hybrid energy generation system that heavily relies on renewable energy sources,
    such as wind and solar systems (Lund et al., 2015), biomass, fuel cells, and tidal
    power. Smart grid is a concept that integrates information and communication technologies
    (ICT) with grid power systems, in order to achieve efficient and intelligent energy
    generation and consumption (Iyer and Agrawal, 2010). It is characterized by a
    two-way flow of both electricity and information. Approaches in smart grid include
    novel solutions that would effectively exploit the existing power grid in order
    to reduce or eliminate blackouts, voltage sags and overloads. Utilities could
    benefit, as the load demand in critical situations would decrease. If demand is
    greater than the total generation, these systems could prevent the grid failure
    or major blackouts, and increase the reliability, quality, security and safety
    of the power grid. Smart grid solutions can be applied in every part of the grid:
    production, transmission and distribution. Recently, a fourth part of the smart
    grid, i.e. the smart home has become a major (mainstream) research and application
    interest in smart grid. Smart home refers to the use of ICT in home control, ranging
    from controlling appliances to automation of home features (windows, lighting,
    etc.). A key element of the smart home is the usage of intelligent power scheduling
    algorithms, which will provide residents with the ability to make optimal, a priori
    choices about how to spent electricity in order to decrease energy consumption.
    Another term commonly used is smart house or home automation. The combination
    of information technologies and advanced communication and sensing systems, creates
    a variety of new potential applications. New advanced concepts, such as pervasive
    or ubiquitous computing (Greenfield, 2006), where computing is made to appear
    everywhere and anywhere, hold a huge potential for application in smart grid (Parikh
    et al., 2010). Smart devices or objects, capable of communication and computation,
    ranging from simple sensor nodes to home appliances and sophisticated smart phones
    are present everywhere around us. The heterogeneous network composing of such
    objects comes under the umbrella of a concept with a fast growing popularity,
    referred to as Internet of Things (IoT). IoT represents a worldwide network of
    uniquely addressable interconnected objects. According to Gubbi et al. (2013),
    IoT is an “interconnection of sensing and actuating devices providing the ability
    to share information across platforms through a unified framework, developing
    a common operating picture for enabling innovative applications. This is achieved
    by seamless ubiquitous sensing, data analytics and information representation
    with Cloud computing as the unifying framework.” Therefore, the Internet of Things
    aims to improve one''s comfort and efficiency, by enabling cooperation among smart
    objects. The standard IoT usually consists of many Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)
    and Radio-frequency identification (RFID) devices. Wireless Sensor Network is
    a paradigm that was tremendously explored by the research community in the last
    two decades (Oppermann et al., 2014). A WSN consists of smart sensing devices
    that can communicate through direct radio communication. RFID devices are not
    as sophisticated. They mainly consist of two parts: an integrated circuit with
    some computational capabilities and an antenna for communication. The concept
    of IoT, combined with smart metering, has the potential to transform residential
    houses, homes and offices into energy-aware environments. There is an increasing
    interest in the research community to incorporate the IoT paradigm in the smart
    grid concept, particularly in smart home solutions. The trends of web search popularity
    for the terms: Internet of Things, Smart Grid and Smart Home since 2004 are shown
    in Fig. 1. According to these statistics by Google, the trends will further increase
    for the terms Internet of Things and Smart Home. Download : Download high-res

    to Google trends since 2004 for terms Internet of Things, Smart Grid and Smart
    Home. In this paper, we present a holistic approach to the integration of state-of-the-art
    IoT (or near IoT) solutions into the smart home, taking into account both home
    energy management considerations and architectural challenges and solutions with
    emphasis on data processing issues, networking and interoperability features of
    smart home protocols. For this purpose, we surveyed the IoT frameworks present
    in the literature, analyzed these state-of-the-art solutions and defined challenges
    for future research. Section two presents the methodology used in this paper in
    order to select the most appropriate recent developments as published in the literature
    covering the topics of Internet of Things, smart grid, and smart home. The in-depth
    analysis of the results, as identified by our methodology, is given in Section
    3. Our analysis is conducted in a threefold manner. Initially, possible and existing
    IoT and near IoT applications are analyzed in view of different parts of the smart
    grid where such solutions are and/or can be applied, with focus on the smart home.
    Afterwards, a generalization is given of the existing solutions in a new generic
    holistic framework that incorporates key features from the literature review as
    identified by our methodology. The analysis is concluded by overviewing a general
    smart home management model for the IoT based holistic framework by defining its
    integral levels and their main tasks as observed in the analyzed state-of-the-art
    solutions. The fourth section discusses challenges associated with IoT constrained
    resources (energy, memory capacity and processing capabilities), along with networking,
    interoperability issues, big data analyses, security and privacy. An overview
    of useful guidelines and solutions needed to face these challenges is given. Finally,
    this paper is concluded in the fifth section. 2. Review methodology This section
    presents the methodology used in the paper in order to select the most appropriate
    recent developments as published in the literature covering the topics of Internet
    of Things, smart grid, and smart home. The literature was searched using the online
    service Google Scholar (GS) (https://scholar.google.com/). The main advantages
    of using GS as opposed to other similar resources like Scopus and Web of Science
    are freedom, ease of use, and a broader universe of cited and citing items (Franceschet,
    2010). Google Scholar has a high coverage for high quality studies, is highly
    sensitive and could be the first, and even more so a standalone choice for systematic
    reviews or meta-analysis (Gehanno et al., 2013). Only publications, excluding
    patents and citations were searched. All results provided by GS were sorted according
    to their relevance. Google Scholar''s ranking algorithm relies heavily on an article''s
    citation count, but also puts a high weighting on words in the title (Beel and
    Gipp, 2009). Currently GS does not search for synonyms of queried keywords; hence,
    all synonyms have to be rewritten and queried separately. Only publications between
    years 2010 and 2016 were considered. Papers prior to 2010 were not considered
    since most of the advances in this area have happened within the last few years
    (GS retrieves 130 publications with keyword “Internet of Things” in the title
    published before 2010, and 7650 publication published after 2010), which is in
    line with the Google trends as shown in Fig. 1. The following terms were allowed:
    “Wireless Sensor Network”, “Internet of Things”, “IoT”, “Smart Grid”, “Smart Home”
    and “Home Automation” to appear anywhere in the text of the publications. We consider
    the terms “Home Automation” and “Smart Home” to be synonyms, as well as the terms
    “IoT”, “Internet of Things” and “Wireless Sensor Networks” (since Wireless Sensor
    Networks together with RFID are the two main technologies which enable the development
    of IoT). Most of the research challenges in IoT have its origin in WSN; hence,
    some of the IoT solutions are simply borrowed from WSN (Mainetti et al., 2011).
    The general query form we use is “term1” AND “term2” AND “term3”, where term1
    = (“Wireless Sensor Networks” OR “Internet of Things” OR “IoT”), term2 = (“Smart
    Home” OR “Home Automation”), and term3 = “Smart Grid”, and thus perform six searches.
    The queries and the total number of publications retrieved by GS are given in
    Table 1. Table 1. Number of publications found by GS engine for different queries.
    Query# Term1 Term2 Term3 Total number of results Query 1 “Wireless Sensor Network”

    Home” “Smart Grid” 1050 Query 6 “IoT” “Home Automation” “Smart Grid” 747 Only
    the first 100 results per query were considered for further analysis in this paper.
    There are overlaps between the result sets of the different queries so the final
    set of unique publications is around 150. For example, if we consider only the
    top 20 results there are a total of 74 unique publications, with multiple publications
    appearing in the results of more than one query. Fig. 2 shows the number of these
    overlaps, and additionally the average GS ranking for each group are given (e.g.
    papers that appear in the results of a single query have an average ranking of
    12.54). Download : Download high-res image (203KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Total number of publications appearing in the top 20 results for
    the six queries. The number associated with each bar refers to the average ranking
    of the publications in the group. The unique set of publications was further filtered
    content-wise i.e. whether the publication has pertinent material regarding wireless
    sensor networks or Internet of Things solution/s for smart home and/or smart grid.
    First a number of papers were excluded based on the content of their abstract.
    Next, we considered the whole text of the remaining papers and retained only those
    in line with our review. The final remaining papers were analyzed in-depth. The
    finding is that the papers can be semantically divided in two main categories:
    WSN solutions and IoT concepts. The first category includes papers that provide
    real-life working implementations of WSN in different domains like habitat monitoring,
    home monitoring, etc. They can be considered the seeds of future IoT applications.
    The papers in the second category revolve around the IoT paradigm and provide
    concepts, frameworks, visions, and challenges of future “to be implemented” IoT
    solutions. Hence, this work separately elaborates the papers in the two categories
    in the forthcoming Section (3). We firstly expatiate on papers in context of WSN
    implementations (3.1), then we survey papers in line with IoT solutions (3.2 and
    3.3). 3. In-depth analysis of literature This section presents the in-depth analysis
    of the results as identified by our methodology. The analysis is conducted in
    a threefold manner. Initially, possible and existing IoT and near IoT applications
    are analyzed in view of different parts of the smart grid where such solutions
    are and/or can be applied, with focus on the smart home. Afterwards, a generalization
    is given of the existing solutions in a new generic holistic framework that incorporates
    key features from the literature review as identified by our methodology. The
    analysis is concluded by overviewing a general smart home management model for
    the IoT based holistic framework by defining its integral levels and their main
    tasks as observed in the analyzed state-of-the-art solutions. 3.1. State-of-the-art
    (near) Internet of Things solutions in smart grid and smart home The integration
    of IoT within the smart grid will bring a new perspective to electricity management,
    with benefit for all parties involved. Table 2 differentiates the potential IoT
    applications regarding different aspects (parts) of the smart grid (Cardenas et
    al., 2014, Gungor et al., 2010, Parikh et al., 2010). Much of the pioneering research
    is hindered with a lot of challenges, especially when dealing with the first three
    aspects (generation, transmission and distribution) of the smart grid. The problems
    are mostly due to the harsh conditions in which sensor devices are deployed. Experimental
    results using IEEE 802.15.4-compliant sensor networks show that wireless links
    (including both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) scenarios) in the smart
    grid have high packet error rates and variable link capacity due to electromagnetic
    interference, equipment noise, obstruction, etc. (Gungor and Korkmaz, 2012). Wireless
    nodes impose additional constraints, i.e. the memory and processing limitations
    of the sensor nodes and their limited power resources. Table 2. Potential IoT
    applications for smart grid. Energy providers Energy generation Transmission Distribution
    Consumers Real-time generation monitoring Transmission lines controlling Underground

    plants controlling Power monitoring Transformers stations controlling Home (Residential)
    energy management Alternative energy sources controlling Solar panels management
    Residential (distributed) production monitoring Predicting future solar panels
    and wind turbine production (using sensor data like temperature or humidity) Fortunately,
    most of these challenges are not present in the fourth, consumer side of the smart
    grid, i.e. the smart home. For example, sensors are usually connected to home
    appliances and the battery life problem becomes superfluous as the devices have
    a steady power supply. Furthermore, strong electromagnetic fields are not associated
    with home grid infrastructure. Still, IoT for smart home is subject to challenges
    like reliability, privacy, and security (Iyer, 2011). Modern homes equipped with
    smart meters, smart appliances, smart power outlets and sensing devices enable
    the development of energy-aware smart homes (Fig. 3). Although the smart home
    has been a dream for both utilities and consumers for a long time, such implementations
    are still very rare (Monacchi et al., 2013). On the other side, there are plenty
    of existing commercial solutions and advanced Demand Side Management (DSM) systems
    focused on large industrial consumers (Finn and Fitzpatrick, 2014, Palensky and
    Dietrich, 2011). Almost all of them fail to integrate small residential consumers.

    Fig. 3. Smart home. IoT carries the potential to overcome this gap and to provide
    services that will foster the development of intelligent solutions for the common
    people. The main goal of IoT is to advance a better and safe society, where “Everything
    is a service” (public safety, environment, health care, production, etc.). In
    this subsection we present relevant attempts from the literature as identified
    by our methodology. The papers discussed here semantically fall in a category
    regarding near IoT solutions for smart home, mainly from the neighboring fields
    of wireless sensor networks, home automation, and smart grid. Novel architectures
    in terms of state-of-the-art software technologies with focus on domestic environments
    and habitat monitoring are proposed in Monacchi et al. (2013) and Stojkoska and
    Davcev (2009). In Monacchi et al. (2013) the authors promote design guidelines
    for collecting and integrating household data, thus enabling data interoperability.
    In Stojkoska and Davcev (2009), a web interface is developed in order to increase
    the interaction between the deployed WSN and its end users. Authors of Kamilaris
    et al. (2011) propose a solution for a Web-based energy-aware smart home framework
    that enables smart appliances to the Web. They have developed a graphical user
    interface to ease the interaction. The evaluation of their solution is done using
    a WSN organized in a star topology and also a multihop topology (up to three hops)
    for larger apartments (smart homes of around 100 m2). VillaSmart (Caracaş et al.,
    2013) is associated with the ECOGRID EU (EcoGrid EU, 2015) project. The authors
    have installed a modular and extensible WSN in a test and reference household
    called VILLASMART. These authors are modeling the energy behavior of the building.
    These thermal models are improved using indoor and outdoor WSN readings (air and
    water temperature, solar radiation sensor, weather conditions and power consumption
    information), thus achieving more precise predictions of indoor temperature. Using
    the standard resistance-capacitance (RC) model, the maximum prediction error achieved
    is 1.790C. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard in the 2.4 GHz is used for indoor communication.
    The model parameter determination is done with the grey-box estimation method.
    In Srbinovska et al. (2015) a WSN is installed for vegetable greenhouse monitoring
    and a control system for agriculture is developed. This system helps farmers increase
    the crop production and quality by remotely controlling different parts of the
    greenhouse, like drip irrigation and fan facilities. In Risteska Stojkoska et
    al. (2014), the authors present a framework for temperature regulation inside
    commercial and administrative buildings, with focus on design and implementation
    of specific network topologies and node localization within the system. 3.2. Holistic
    IoT-based framework for smart home It is expected that smart objects will be dominant
    on the market in the next few years and will become omnipresent in households,
    which will impose the need for new and improved services for smart homes (Karnouskos,
    2011). For these reasons, the need for IoT based solutions will be incontestable.
    Most recent publications focus on developing a general IoT framework that is suitable
    for broader range of application domains. In Lee and Lee (2015), the authors identity
    five IoT technologies as essential for building successful IoT solutions: radio
    frequency identification, wireless sensor networks, middleware, cloud computing
    and software for application development. They also identify three IoT categories
    for enterprise applications: monitoring and control, big data and business analytics,
    and information sharing and collaboration. In(Da Xu et al., 2014), the list of
    enabling technologies is enhanced with Near Field Communication, location based
    services and social networks. They suggest a four-layer architecture made up of:
    sensing, networking, service and interface. The role of the cloud is missing;
    therefore, it is not clear how services would be enabled. Liu et al. (2014) presents
    a middleware that supports naming, addressing, storage and look-up services. The
    idea is to develop a middleware at the top of the existing systems, thus to achieve
    easier integration of existing applications into IoT environments. Once again,
    the cloud is omitted as an enabling technology that should support all these services.
    The monitoring of production processes in industry using IoT is investigated in
    Shrouf and Miragliotta (2015). The authors propose a detailed framework that is
    focused on energy management, with possibilities for in-house or cloud-based data
    mining and decision making. The role of the third-party solution designers is
    not specified in the framework. Readers can also refer to (Gubbi et al., 2013,
    He et al., 2014, Xu et al., 2014) for interesting work regarding IoT architectures.
    With respect to these publications, the framework presented in this paper can
    be considered a modified version of the most general model we found in literature
    (Da Xu et al., 2014), augmented with the cloud in the middle, and adapted to a
    particular application domain, i.e. smart home. This multi-level hierarchical
    holistic framework based on Internet of Things is used as a wrapper or generalization
    of all the key features of IoT solutions for smart homes identified in the literature.
    The graphical representation of the framework is given in Fig. 4. Within the framework
    data is sent wirelessly and is shown using dashed lines. The yellow lines correspond
    to a bidirectional electricity flow. The following paragraphs summarize each level
    of the framework. Download : Download high-res image (641KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Multi level IoT framework for smart home. 3.2.1. Smart
    home All household devices equipped with interfaces for wireless communication,
    make up the home WSN. Each home has a WSN, and the sensed data from each device
    is forwarded to a central station, which we refer to as home sink or home hub.
    Each node in the home WSN is considered a smart device and has moderate computation
    and communication capabilities. The home hub can be any one device (smart meter,
    PC, tablet or smartphone) that has some data storage capacity, can perform local
    processing and can communicate with devices outside the home WSN. In the case
    of smart residential complexes or smart buildings, the counterpart of the home
    hub is identified as residential sink or residential hub. The residential hub
    needs to have an additional feature, as compared to the home hub, which is that
    it is responsible for managing data from/to shared distributed production sources.
    This is rather important, as renewable sources are usually shared among consumers,
    one example being a residential building with a PV system on the roof, where the
    PV system is used by all households in the building. Within the framework, each
    distributed renewable energy source is considered a smart device. 3.2.2. Cloud
    All data from different sources is accumulated in the cloud (households'' data,
    sensor measurements from the transmission/distribution lines or from the production
    sites, etc.). The cloud should provide massive data storage and processing infrastructure.
    It is the most advanced level of the framework (Da Xu et al., 2014, Lee and Lee,
    2015). As stated in Gubbi et al. (2013), the cloud “promises high reliability,
    scalability and autonomy” for the next generation of IoT applications. The cloud
    is the central part of this system, hence our framework can be considered as “cloud
    centric” or “cloud based”. 3.2.3. Utility This level corresponds to the remaining
    parts of the smart grid, apart from the smart home: production, transmission and
    distribution. Each part independently sends data directly to the cloud. The typical
    information that can be exchanged with the utility is: price of electricity, weather
    forecast, distribution/transmission line status, current and future consumption
    of a microgrid, current and future production of the distributed production sources
    associated with a microgrid, etc (Sajjad et al., 2014). 3.2.4. Third party Third
    party applications are developed using the cloud data (Gubbi et al., 2013). Other
    terms that are interchangeably used are business applications, industry oriented
    applications or user-specific IoT application. Namely, third party application
    developers get data from the cloud (private or public) and use this data to deliver
    solutions in the form of web based or mobile applications (Fan et al., 2010).
    3.2.5. User interfaces This level represents user interfaces that deliver data
    to the end users (notifications, recommendations, smart device controls, etc)
    (Da Xu et al., 2014). Raw tabular data referring to monthly (or even daily) household
    consumption is hard to be interpreted by the users. A more sophisticated visualization
    tool is needed to present not only the overall household consumption, but also
    the consumption at device/appliance level (Liu et al., 2014). This is particularly
    useful, since consumers will be able to learn more about different appliances
    in their home, especially ones that cannot be controlled automatically, like non-flexible
    devices, hence enabling the users to control them intuitively taking into account
    their consuming nature. Third party applications should put an effort toward developing
    intuitive visual user interfaces for the consumers and frequently evaluate those
    using Quality of Experience (QoE) metrics. 3.3. Smart home management systems
    An energy management system is defined as an interface between a utility company
    and smart devices that consume power. It aims to provide benefits for both parties
    (utilities and consumers), somewhat biased towards the consumers. Another term
    commonly used is Demand Side Management (DSM). It represents a set of technologies
    that enable monitoring and controlling the consumption/production at consumer
    level in order to perform power balancing in future energy systems (Atzeni et
    al., 2013, Rezvani et al., 2015, Siano, 2014). In the context of IoT solutions
    for smart home, the traditional DSM model is shifted toward the cloud centric
    model. The cloud based approach offers centralized optimization that considers
    a huge set of parameters; hence it is expected to outperform the energy management
    as compared to a traditional approach. Fig. 5 shows the general Smart home management
    model adopted for our holistic framework. The main tasks that should be performed
    at each level are presented as follows. Download : Download high-res image (391KB)

    3.3.1. Smart objects/smart devices Home appliances, lights, or sensors attached
    to production or transmission lines in a smart grid system can be considered smart
    objects. They can sense, actuate, process data and communicate. In order to sense
    and actuate, they need to perform A/D and D/A conversions (Byun et al., 2012).
    These devices periodically perform sensing and send (wirelessly of wired) sensed
    data to the hub. Moreover, if protocols allow it, sensed data can be sent directly
    to the cloud. If possible, smart devices should perform basic data processing
    before they send the sensed data (Stojkoska et al., 2012, Viani et al., 2013).
    Actuating can be also controlled remotely. In the context of DSM, home appliances
    can be divided in three categories: non flexible, flexible and dual nature appliances
    (Erol-Kantarci and Mouftah, 2010). The non-flexible appliances are those that
    are associated with baseline loads or non-preemptive tasks (like light, TV, PC,
    hair drier) and cannot be controlled by the system (Ullah et al., 2013). The flexible
    appliances are associated with regular loads or preemptive tasks (like heating
    or air-conditioning) and can be automatically operated by the system. The dual
    nature appliances sometimes can act as flexible, but sometimes as non-flexible
    (like washing machine, dish washer or laundry). For example, sometimes the consumer
    does not care about the exact time the dish washer will operate, as long as it
    is within a predefined time frame. These appliances usually present burst loads
    (Khan et al., 2014, Ullah et al., 2013). The smart appliances (both flexible and
    dual nature) are equipped with smart power outlets that are able to measure their
    power consumption and to control their operation in real-time. 3.3.2. Hubs The
    hub is a device that is responsible for collecting raw and/or processed data from
    the smart devices and forwarding them to the cloud (Zhu et al., 2010). Whenever
    possible, the hub has to perform local data processing (Viani et al., 2013), in
    order to reduce the data flow towards the cloud. Furthermore, in a smart home
    scenario, the hub can send commands to the smart devices acting as a local scheduler,
    regulator, or load balancer (Byun et al., 2012). In the case of a residential
    hub, it can send commands to the devices that regulate the electricity flow to/from
    the nanogrid, i.e. to manage the operations of buying/selling electricity from/to
    the grid. The hub understands the communication protocols used by the smart devices.
    Hubs are needed to enable the interoperability between the smart objects, since
    the devices generally cannot communicate with each other (Gubbi et al., 2013,
    Heile, 2010). Hence, sometimes a household needs more than one hub. In the future,
    when full interoperability among smart devices is achieved, it is expected that
    hubs will be superfluous in the model. 3.3.3. Cloud The cloud is the most complex
    part of the home management. The main task of the cloud is to store the data (Zhou
    et al., 2013). Because of the high data volume, traditional approaches should
    be modified to meet the new requirements. New methods and algorithms based on
    machine learning techniques, time series processing and advanced analytics are
    to be employed (Da Xu et al., 2014, Gubbi et al., 2013). Third-party applications
    typically assume that the data being used is unchanging i.e. the data is usable
    by applications on a non-real-time basis. In the cloud the event-based data is
    converted to query-based processing. This is a crucial step towards bridging the
    differences of real-time IoT networking and the third-party application world.
    The data should be stored persistently and abstracted at multiple levels so that
    they could be easily combined, recomputed and/or aggregated with previously stored
    data, with the possibility of some data coming from non-IoT sources (Da Xu et
    al., 2014). Even more importantly the different levels of abstraction will simplify
    the application access and usage since data will be presented in a manner required
    by applications. 3.3.4. Third party Third party should develop applications for
    the end users in the form of schedulers, regulators, and load balancers (Fan et
    al., 2010). A scheduler is a tool responsible for defining time slots in which
    the dual nature appliances will be active. A regulator is a tool responsible for
    the management of flexible devices, i.e. it will regulate the operation of air
    conditioners, heaters, dehumidifiers, etc. Load balancing should optimize energy
    consumption, considering current electricity price on the market and availability
    of electricity produced by the local renewable sources, if available. All these
    tools need advanced algorithms that use much more parameters than those obtained
    by the home devices. They should perform the complex tasks of mining and knowledge
    extraction from the available data in the cloud in order to create consumer and
    household profiles, or in simpler words the available smart home data should lead
    to the creation of personalized recommendations for all users (Liu et al., 2014).
    4. Challenges and solutions In this section, some guidelines for future developers
    of IoT solutions on how to make good choices when dealing with different challenges
    associated with practical issues are presented. 4.1. Edge (fog) computing Edge
    computing or fog computing is the process of data processing at the edge of the
    network. In this paradigm it is expected that the knowledge extraction process
    starts as early as the time the data is sensed i.e. at the sensor side. There
    are many reasons to employ this approach, but some of the more prominent ones
    are the energy saving, data volume reduction and latency reduction. Each object/entity
    in the IoT can consume a huge amount of energy if its communication is not optimized.
    For smart objects, in terms of energy consumption, local computation is an operation
    cheaper than communication. Hence, the effort should be shifted toward developing
    lightweight algorithms for local data processing. This approach will decrease
    the data volume and will avoid sending huge portions of raw data. Instead, only
    metadata will be transmitted (data about the data). Reducing the number of transmissions
    among IoT devices is also very important in order to avoid latency issues and
    saturation of the wireless channels. For these reasons, different data reduction
    techniques should be employed to minimize the communication overhead. There are
    three main techniques used for data reduction: data compression, data prediction
    and in-network processing (Stojkoska et al., 2012). For example, if data is not
    needed in real time, data compression (like delta compression) can be used. Otherwise,
    different filters can be used for real-time sensor data prediction, most of them
    based on adaptive filtering techniques, like moving average (MA), autoregressive
    (AR) model, autoregressive moving average (ARMA), least mean square (LMS), and
    LMS with variable step size (LMS-VSS) (Risteska Stojkoska et al., 2014, Stojkoska
    et al., 2012). Prediction is performed at each device and at the hub, i.e. predictions
    are made simultaneously on both sides. If the sensed value differs significantly
    from the predicted value (the difference is above a predefined threshold emax),
    the smart device should send the measurement/data to the hub. Otherwise, the predicted
    value is considered to be “reliable” and is used to feed the filter for future
    predictions. This paradigm is known as “dual prediction scheme” (Santini and Romer,
    2006). In-network processing is the process of consecutive data processing on
    their way to the destination. As data travel through intermediate nodes, some
    aggregating operations are performed. 4.2. Big data The IoT-generated data come
    in big amounts, are variable in terms of structure, often arrive at real-time,
    and might be of uncertain provenance. This volume, velocity and variety (not to
    mention variable veracity) make the storing and analytics solution, which will
    generate useful insights, a very complex one (Zaslavsky et al., 2013). Traditional
    SQL-queried relational database management systems (RDBMSs) are unsuitable for
    the task, which is why big data solutions are needed. The IoT Cloud (Alamri et
    al., 2013, Botta et al., 2016) will enable the long-time storage and complex analysis
    of this data. The challenge of handling big data is a critical one, since the
    overall performance is directly proportional to the properties of the data management
    service (Dobre and Xhafa, 2014). A constellation of tools has evolved to service
    the market, most notably Apache''s open-source Hadoop distributed data processing
    system, plus various NoSQL databases and a range of business intelligence platforms.
    There are multiple vendors that operate in different parts of the analytics pipeline
    (data integration, data storage, core analytics and data presentation), as well
    as ''full-stack'' vendors like IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP and Software AG. Both
    proprietary and open source solutions adopt alternative database technologies
    for big data (Copie et al., 2013): time-series, key-value, document store, wide
    column stores, and graph databases. However, to date there is no simple answer
    to the big data management question in the Cloud (Zaslavsky et al., 2013). The
    problem becomes even more cumbersome when the factor of data integrity is taken
    into account, not only because of its impact on the quality of service, but also
    for its security and privacy related aspects especially on outsourced data (Liu
    et al., 2015). 4.3. Networking Networking protocols for Internet of Things solutions
    can be divided in smart device networks and traditional networks that are designed
    primarily for high data rates. Smart home networking protocols are expected to
    adopt the protocols already established in Wireless Sensor Networks and Machine-to-Machine
    (M2M) communications, with no clear winner so far (Chen et al., 2012). Adding
    many advanced features to the protocol increases the cost, and reduces the ease-of-use.
    Designing an appealing protocol is not a trivial task, and is usually a tradeoff
    between the cost and the performances. In perspective of the topology to be used,
    mesh is the most suitable choice of network topology for wireless communication
    due to the presence of obstacles in the home, like walls, furniture, etc. Dual-mesh,
    which means that the network operates as both wired and wireless, is an appropriate
    solution for households that have a previously installed wired home automation
    system. There are many protocols designed for smart home solutions. Some of them
    dated back from the period when smart home was reserved for the wealthy households,
    and many new that try to combine the old design principles with the newly developed
    technologies. X10 is the oldest protocol that was initially wired, but new modifications
    make it dual-mesh. Insteon is another example of a dual-mesh protocol, which was
    recently integrated into Google owned Nest, Apple''s HomeKit platform and Apple
    Watch (Darbee, 2013). The more recent protocols work only wirelessly (ZigBee,
    Z-Wave, 6lowpan, EnOcean, etc.). There are different ways to classify protocols,
    and none of them is exhaustive enough. Using Google Scholar, we queried for publications
    that cover each of these protocols and the summary statistics for the number of
    publications is given in Table 3. This data is of November 2015. Table 3. Number
    of publications according to Google Scholar. Empty Cell Zigbee 6lowpan Z-Wave

    With patents 264000 9010 7650 7550 1890 2440 1080 Table 3 shows that ZigBee is
    the most popular protocol, but this is true only for the scientific research and
    academia (ZigBee, 2015). In practice, the Z-Wave is the one that has the most
    manufacturers, mainly due to their interoperability. According to Z-Wave Alliance,
    over 35 million Z-Wave products have been sold since they began selling in 2005
    (Z-Wave Alliance, 2015). The basic features of ZigBee, Z-Wave and Insteon are
    shown in Table 4. Theoretically, a Z-Wave network is limited to a maximum of 232
    Z-Wave devices, but most vendors recommend using about 30–50 (Darbee, 2013). For
    example, MiOS LTD with their Vera products recommends 50 devices for Vera Lite,
    and 100 devices for Vera 3 (MiOS, 2015). Table 4. Basic features of ZigBee, Z-Wave

    keying (FSK) The price is another aspect that can be considered when choosing
    the right protocol. A ZigBee Licence costs $3500 per year, while Z-Wave charges
    $750 per device model for the logo (Darbee, 2013). A more detailed comparison
    of the smart home protocols can be found in Withanage et al. (2014). Each level
    of the IoT framework should have particular features. We identify and summarize
    the required capabilities of IoT devices at each level in Table 5. Table 5. Capabilities

    LTE/optical fiber/Wi-Fi very high very high Third party not applicable LTE/optical
    fiber/Wi-Fi high application dependent, from intermediate to high 4.4. Interoperability
    Currently, the main issue for the development of a generic smart home solution
    is the cost associated with integrating smart home devices (Ko et al., 2011).
    Interoperability is the key to open markets to competitive solutions in IoT (Lu
    et al., 2011, Misra et al., 2015). Leading companies in the world that are producing
    smart devices are working toward achieving full interoperability that will ensure
    easy integration with the existing Internet. Z-Wave products are already interoperable
    with their previous versions, while ZigBee Allience with its Zigbee 3.0 has announced
    this feature to be implemented by the end of 2015. ZigBee has formed many committees
    that aim to define product properties required for different vendors to build
    interoperable devices for different public application profiles, like Home Automation,
    Health Care, Remote Control, etc. Still, products are not necessarily interoperable
    across these profiles and across revisions within a profile. On the other side,
    X10 and Insteon are fully interoperable with each other (Darbee, 2013). Table
    6 summarizes the interoperability features of these protocols. Table 6. Interoperability
    features of Insteon, X10, Z-Wave and ZigBee. Empty Cell Insteon X10 Z-Wave ZigBee
    ZigBee invisible to each other No No No Z-Wave invisible to each other No Yes
    X10 Yes Yes Insteon Yes 4.5. Security and privacy One of the most important issues
    of the emergent requirements facing the smart grid development is related to cyber
    security, both for the wireless and the wired parts of the systems (Ning et al.,
    2013, Schneps-Schneppe et al., 2012). The smart grid can be a target for cyber
    terrorists, which emerges as a critical concern for system designers. Because
    of the way in which data is transmitted, IoT is inherently vulnerable to most
    of the common attacks of wireless networks. Hence, IoT requires a security policy,
    but the cost for providing it needs to be as low as possible. Different approaches
    that provide security lightweight crypto-primitives should be investigated (Altolini
    et al., 2013), in order to provide authenticity (the device is not a malicious
    object), integrity (transmitted data is identical with the received data) and
    confidentiality (make data unreadable to others) (Dimitrievski et al., 2006).
    5. Conclusions This paper addresses the vision that the residential buildings
    would shift themselves toward modern households that would be an evolution of
    the passive household. They would have their own solar panels and small wind turbines
    to produce their own energy, thus they would be able to buy/sell energy from/to
    the smart power grid. As it is expected for smart objects to become omnipresent
    on the market and respectively in consumers'' households within the next few years,
    the need for IoT-based services for smart home will be inevitable. In this paper,
    a methodology is developed using different search queries to select the most relevant
    papers from the literature that address this topic. Selected papers were semantically
    divided into two main categories: WSN solutions and IoT concepts. This was rather
    expected considering that WSN is the pivotal technology which enabled the development
    of IoT. Although the WSN solutions are real life implementations that integrate
    devices inside a smart home, two disadvantages are identified, as they: • work
    separately and the data is used only for local optimization; • make an assumption
    of a fully (or near fully) automated home, which is a costly solution for most
    of the households. The second category of papers concerning IoT mainly presents
    concepts, theoretical frameworks and visions for possible smart home/grid solutions.
    There is a lack of a unifying platform that would transform these separate individual
    applications into a single infrastructure, a platform that can be further used
    for advanced data mining and knowledge extraction. The desired solution should
    aggregate all available smart home data within a self-learning engine in order
    to create personalized recommendations for all users, regardless of the level
    of automation present at their homes. The solution should not entail any additional
    cost for the consumers, as it should not require any particular hardware. The
    main contribution of this paper is the IoT based holistic framework, which incorporates
    different components from IoT architectures/frameworks proposed in the literature.
    This integral IoT framework is specific to the smart home application domain,
    with the cloud being the central element in the system that serves not only to
    collect and store data, but also as a gateway to third-parties interested in developing
    applications. In this context, we additionally survey the smart home management
    system, and we identify a model with a set of specific tasks that should be performed
    at each level in order to meet the system requirements. As a second contribution,
    this paper discusses challenges for IoT based smart home solutions, with emphasis
    on practical issues like data processing, networking and interoperability of smart
    home protocols. Fog and edge computing are promising approaches for improving
    the energy saving inside the IoT network by reducing the number of transmissions
    between the IoT devices. Although there are some publications that investigate
    this potential, a lot of research and work still needs to be done. New big data
    solutions and algorithms are needed to deal with the potentially vast amount of
    data generated within the IoT. A constellation of tools has already appeared in
    the last few years, as there are multiple vendors that operate in different parts
    of the analytics pipeline. Another big issue is the interoperability, which is
    a prerequirement for opening the markets to competitive solutions in IoT. The
    current situation is that devices with different protocols cannot communicate,
    and, more important, the products with the same protocols are not necessarily
    interoperable across different profiles and across revisions within the same profile.

    I. Introduction The concept of IoT caught attention in 1999, by means of Auto-ID
    center at MIT and its relevant market investigation publications. Basically, IoT
    is an integration of multiple devices which communicate, sense and interact with
    their internal and external states through the embedded technology that IoT contain
    [1]. IoT has become the megatrend for next generation technologies which can impact
    the whole business spectrum with extended benefits which are advanced connectivity
    of end devices, system and services. IoT offers appropriate solutions for multiple
    applications such as smart health care, smart cities, security, retail, traffic
    congestion industrial control and agriculture [3]. A significant amount of work
    has been done regarding IoT technology in agricultural area to develop smart farming
    solutions [4]. IoT has brought a great revolution in agriculture environment by
    examining multiple complications and challenges in farming [5]. Now a days, with
    the advancement of technology it has been expected that by using IoT agriculturalists
    and technologists are finding out the solution of those problems which farmer
    are facing such as shortages of water, cost management and productivity issues
    [6], [7]. State-of-the-art IoT technologies have detected all these issues and
    provide solutions to increase productivity while lowering the cost. Efforts made
    on wireless sensors networks enable us to collect data from sensing devices and
    send it to the main servers [8]. Data collected through sensors gives information
    about different environmental condition to monitor the whole system properly.
    Monitoring the environmental conditions or crop productivity is not only the factor
    for the evaluation of crop but there are many other factors which effect the crops’
    productivity, e.g. field management, soil and crop monitoring, movement of an
    unwanted object, attacks of wild animals, and thefts etc. [9], [10]. Moreover,
    IoT provides a well-organized scheduling of restricted resources which makes sure
    that the best use of IoT enhances the productivity. Figure 1 shows a schematic
    diagram showing the agricultural trends which provide easy and cost effective
    interactions through a secure and unblemished connectivity across individual Greenhouse,
    Livestock, Farmer, and Field monitoring. Whereby, the IoT agricultural networks
    using the wireless devices enable real time crop and animal monitoring. The figure
    shows that two sensor kits (Libelium Smart Agriculture Xtreme IoT Vertical Kit
    and Crop/Plant Monitoring Sensor Kit) have been implemented which monitor the
    soil moisture, leaf wetness, temperature, humidity, productivity, and air flow.
    While, MooMonitor sensor monitors the animal health, fertility, feeding, ruminating
    and resting. The agricultural servers, gateways, and agriculture database play
    an important role to store agriculture records and provide on demand agricultural
    services to authorized users. FIGURE 1. Agricultural trends. Show All As a whole,

    among others [28]–[30]. Moreover, in many countries and organizations over globe
    different IoT policies and guidelines have been implemented in agriculture field.
    However in IoT agricultural environment a reasonable amount of work has been done
    and there is a need of thorough study on IoT in agriculture context to understand
    the current research status. To transform agriculture technologies via IoT innovation
    this paper analyzes various issues and trends in IoT smart farming. In this research
    as a contribution following IoT agricultural techniques have been added from literature:
    Present major components of IoT based smart farming along with relevant technologies
    in Section II. Section III presents a rigorous discussion on network architecture
    of IoT that involves network architecture and layers, network topologies used;
    and devices and protocols used in agriculture IoT. Different application domains
    and relevant smart phone and sensor based applications have been discussed in
    Section IV. The security and privacy issues in IoT based agriculture have been
    discussed in Section V. The industrial trends have been discussed in Section VI
    that provides the details related to top technology industries investing in this
    area. The IoT agricultural policies made by different countries for the standardization
    of IoT based agriculture have been discussed in Section VII. This section also
    presents few success stories in this area. Lastly, the open issues and challenges
    to improve IoT based agricultural technologies from many aspects have been presented
    in Section VIII. SECTION II. Major Components and Relevant Technologies for IoT
    Based Smart Farming A. Major Components of IoT Based Smart Farming IoT based smart
    farming consist of four major components as shown in Figure 2. FIGURE 2. Major
    components of IoT based smart farming. Show All These four major components are
    physical structure, data acquisition, data processing, and data analytics. The
    physical structure is the most important factor for precision agriculture to avoid
    any unwanted happening. Whole system is designed in such a way which controls
    the sensors, actuators, and devices. A sensor performs multiple tasks like soil
    sensing, temperature sensing, weather sensing, light sensing, and moisture sensing.
    Similarly devices perform many control functions like, node discovery, device
    identification and naming services etc. All these functions are performed by any
    device or sensor which is controlled through a microcontroller. This controlling
    operation is performed by any remote device or a computer which is connected through
    the Internet. Data Acquisition is further divided into two sub components namely:
    IoT data acquisition and standard data acquisition. Whereby, the IoT data acquisition
    component consists of seven protocols that are Message Queuing Telemetry Transport
    (MQTT), Websocket, Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Node, Constrained
    Application Protocol (CoAP), Data Distribution Service (DDS), and Hyper Text Transfer
    Protocol (HTTP). Depending on the requirements and condition more protocols can
    be used for the implementation of smart farming. Whereas, in the standard data
    acquisition ZigBee, WIFI, Long Range Wide Area Network (LoraWan), SigFox and ISOBUS
    protocols have been used. Data processing consists of multiple features that are
    image or video processing, data loading, decision support system, and data mining
    as shown in Figure 2. According to the system requirements any feature may be
    added that may work in parallel to provide other services. Data analytics consists
    of two main features that are monitoring and controlling. Monitoring involves
    three main application in smart agriculture that are Live Stock Monitoring, Field
    Monitoring, and Green house Monitoring. IoT enables farmers to monitor livestock
    via multiple sensors which are used to monitor different animal’s diseases like
    temperature, heart rate, and digestion etc [11]. Whereas field monitoring applications
    intend to report different conditions of field like soil richness, temperature,
    humidity, gas, pressure (air pressure and water pressure), and crop disease monitoring
    [12], [13]. A smart greenhouse design eliminates the manual intervention and measures
    different climate parameters by intelligent IoT devices and sensors according
    to plants requirements [14]–[16]. B. Iotagricultural Relevant Technologies A Large
    number of technologies are being used in IoT agricultural solutions due to which
    it is hard to make an explicit of all those due to which our discussion focused
    on several core technologies which have played a vital role to modernize the IoT
    agricultural services. 1) Cloud and Edge Computing Collaboration of IoT and cloud
    computing in agriculture provides pervasive access to shared resources. To meet
    various agricultural needs upon request over network and execute operations cloud
    computing plays vital role [17]. Cloud based software architecture has been proposed
    which process and retrieve information and agricultural tasks in a more accurate
    way [18], [19]. In the field of IoT edge computing is considered as a solution
    to facilitate data processing at the source of data generation which are sensors,
    actuators and many other embedded devices. Edge computing or fog computing are
    measured as the backbone of cloud computing. This technology is deployed according
    to the features and requirements of smart farming [20]. 2) Big Data Analytics
    and Machine Learning Big data consist of a large amount of essential which are
    generated by agricultural sensors. Big data analysis provides different and efficient
    crop monitoring methods at different stages [21]. A good systematic review on
    big data analysis in agriculture has been presented [22]. Neural networks are
    very famous because they provide optimal solutions at a very high speed. Intrusion
    detection has been realized by using advance principles and technology of neural
    network. On the other hand most important feature of neural network is that they
    provide detection module and data training [23]. By using deep neural networks
    an IoT based hydroponic system has been developed [24]. 3) Communication Networks
    and Protocols IoT agricultural network consist of different kinds of long ranges
    and short ranges networks for communications. Several IoT networks technologies
    help to design a crop or field monitoring sensors and devices [25]. Communication
    protocols are the backbone of IoT agricultural network system and applications
    [26]. They are used to exchange all agricultural data or information over the
    network. 4) Robotics Multiple Agribots have been developed for the purpose of
    smart farming which are minimizing the amount of farmers by increasing the speed
    of work through advance techniques. Agribots performs elementary functions like
    weeding, spraying and sowing etc. All these robots are controlled by using IoT
    to increase the crop productivity and efficient resource utilization. A multi
    sensor robotics approach has been proposed for characterization and ground mapping
    [27]. SECTION III. IoT Agricultural Networks IoT agricultural network or IoT network
    for agriculture is one of the vital elements of IoT in agriculture. It helps to
    monitor agriculture data and facilitate the transmission and reception of agriculture
    data. As shown in Figure 3, the framework consists of IoT agricultural network
    architecture, IoT agricultural network platform and IoT agricultural network topologies
    and protocols. FIGURE 3. IoT agricultural network. Show All A. IoT Agricultural
    Neworkt Architecture The IoT agricultural network is the main factor of IoT in
    agriculture field [31]. IoT Agricultural network architecture suggests an outline
    for the specification of an IoT agricultural network physical elements as well
    as their working principles, and techniques. Most of the IoT applications usually
    follow the four layer architecture (Network Layer, Application layer, Physical
    and Mac Layer and Transport Layer) due to the popularity and interoperability
    of IP as suggested by Naik [32]. After reviewing these four layers protocol we
    have also survey two more approaches that are IPv6 and 6LoWPAN as shown in Figure
    4. This layer is the final level of abstraction which allows the development of
    multiple user applications. At this layer deployed communication protocols monitor
    different agricultural parameters such as weather information, soil moisture values,
    irrigation monitoring etc. FIGURE 4. Layer structure of the 6LoWPAN. Show All
    1) Application Layer Due to the energy constraints and stringent computation involved
    by the IoT devices there are many lightweight protocols on application layer such
    as CoAP, MQTT, AMQP, and HTTP. These protocols can be increased or decreased according
    to the system requirement. CoAP protocol runs on UDP and works on the principle
    of request or response architecture [33]. AMQP protocol runs over the TCP protocol
    by following publish/subscribe architecture asynchronously and use TSL/SSL for
    security assurance. MQTT is a bandwidth-efficient protocol which uses little battery
    power and designed for receiving and transmitting sensor information [34]. HTTP
    is a well known web messaging protocol which based on the request/response architecture
    [35]. Runs over TCP and does not define any QoS, uses TSL/SSL for security purpose.
    2) Transport Layer This layer is also called host to host transport layer, and
    is directly transferred from IP to IoT domain. The main task of network layer
    is to collect and encapsulate the agricultural information which is obtained through
    sensor layer. There are two protocols that are transmission control protocol (TCP)
    and user datagram protocol (UDP). TCP is a connection oriented protocol which
    ensures the reliability of delivered data. TCP data transmission speed is low
    as compare to UDP. UDP is a connection less protocol which does not ensure reliability
    of data. Its data transmission speed is high as compared to TCP. Both of these
    protocols are used in different applications because their choices depend upon
    the requirements of application. 3) Network Layer This layer is an indispensable
    technology for precision farming and responsible to transmit agricultural information
    at application layer. IP is the major choice with the existing two versions that
    are IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 came into existence due to increasing the large number
    of addressable devices. Whereas, invention of IPv6 was expected which gradually
    establish on all networking devices. Routing protocol for Low Power and Lossy
    Networks (RPL) is considered as the main protocol while applying routing on 6LoWPAN
    [36]. RPL consist of distance vector routing protocol which uses Destination Oriented
    Directed Acyclic Graphs (DODAG) to specify routes. To support different flows
    of traffic RPL modify itself according to network speed and acknowledge routing
    metrics such as status of the battery used in device, link quality, and higher
    computational cost exchange. 4) Adaptation Layer Adaptation Layer (AL) aim is
    to ensure the interoperability, and implement fragmentation, compression and reassembly
    mechanism. Although AL attained many advances but still there is a complexity
    for IPv6 supporting because its direct use on IoT devices is not considered reasonable.
    Usually clashes were seen with constraints which are associated with IoT devices.
    That’s why, 6LoWPAN made a big effort in order to decrease the limitations of
    IPv6 and make it suitable for IoT devices. Sensors and devices use IPv6 and 6LoWPAN
    to transmit data over IEEE 802.15.4 protocol in IoT agricultural network. 5) Physical
    and Mac Layers This is the bottom most layer in agriculture network archichture
    which is responsible to sense and actuate different agricultural parametrs. Within
    physical and MAC layer IEEE 802.15.4 is one of the most popular standard which
    was designed for low cost, low consumption and low complexity [37]. This standard
    was adopted by many protocols like Wireless HART, ZigBee and ISA100. IEEE802.15.4
    mainly operates in ISM band of 2.4 GHz. Furthermore, it also operate 915 MHz (in
    United Nations of American) 868 MHz (in European countries) and supports up to
    250 kbps data rates. However literature shows some significant limitation of later
    approaches, which are regarding to mobility and network formation [38]. EPC-Global
    (designed for RFID technologies) [39] and Z-wave (particularly designed for domotics)
    [40] have also been used as alternative of IEEE 802.15.4 to exchange information
    directly from internt protocol (IP). B. IoT Agricultural Network Platform IoT
    agricultural network platform refers to both the big data analytics model and
    cloud model. 1) Big Data Analytics Big data analysis applied to find out the required
    and meaningful information from the large amount of data from different data formates.
    The crop disease control and crop growth models build on the basis of farm data.
    Big data analysis also provides decision support services to farmers for crop
    productivity and optimal cost analysis. Figure 5 shows IoT agricultural network
    platform based on big data analytics. The proposed network platform consists of
    six components namely: i) Farmer/User experience, ii) Big Data analysis, iii)
    Sensing and monitoring, iv) Storage services, v) Communication protocols, and
    vi) Physical implementations. This platform provides access to the IoT backbone,
    and helps collecting information about soil fertility, weather conditioning, moisturization,
    and online crop monitoring etc. FIGURE 5. IoT agricultural network platform based
    on big data analysis. Show All a: Farmer Experience Farmer experience layer is
    designed to help the farmers to monitor crop productivity in multiple ways such
    as, for effective growth of crops farmers are awared by identifying the appropriateness
    of fertile selection. Climate conditions, crops growth conditions, soil quality,
    or cattle health monitoring helps the farmers to track the state of their business
    and mitigate the lower production risks. b: Predictive Analysis This analysis
    makes the whole environment smarter by the combination of smart farming market
    intelligence and IoT technology. The major task of predictive analysis is to analyze,
    explore and process the agricultural information for digital awareness. Predictive
    analysis is made to check the probabilistic chance of crop productivity up to
    the next season. Here different detecting devices are applied to check the, Crop
    disease, weather conditions, and estimate the profit/loss on the basis of crop
    productivity. Predictive analysis facilitates the farm to understand the optimal
    time for planting & harvesting and various farm management techniques. c: Multicultural
    Analysis Elaborates the multiple forms of agriculture. In this analysis big data
    analysis minimize the risk of crop destruction according to scientific ways. To
    enhance the growth rate of water featured Botanic Aquaculture layer is equipped
    with big data. Other multicultural techniques like Citriculture, Horticulture
    and Floriculture avail direct benefits when enabled with big data analysis. It
    is helpful for decision making related to crop or plants seasonal growth, and
    pest control. Vermiculture is used for the cultivation of earthworms. Arboriculture
    is basically used for the cultivation of woody plants. Olericulture is an application
    which is used for the prediction and measure the growth rate of different vegetables.
    d: Sensing and Monitoring Sensing and monitoring analysis is made by applying
    different sensing and monitoring devices. Sensors sense data and store the crop
    disease information. Data which is processed through multiple resources is automatically
    achieved by sensing layer. Ststistical analysis has been made on data received
    from sensors in order to actuate the disease. Farmers obtain necessary information
    such as ph value, temperature, soil moisture and humidity through web and message
    service. Real time image and video monitoring on data helps the farmer to gat
    timely and accurate information. e: Communication Protocols Communication protocols
    collect and encapsulate agricultural data. To process and transmit data by using
    these protocols have been considered as the nerve center of IoT in agriculture.
    These protocols consist of internet related technologies like WIFI, LoraWan and
    Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technologies. ZigBee is considered as the
    main enabler for communication over long distances when third party service providers
    such as Long-Term Evolution (LTE), CDMA or Global System for Mobile (GSM) are
    not available. f: Storage Services Farmers’ store crop related information to
    make better analysis in future and use stored information in multiple seasons
    for more productivity. g: Physical Implementations Multiple sensors, different
    types of actuators and microcontrollers are implemented physically to monitore
    different agricultural applications. Many other network equipments also implemented
    at physical layer like switches, routers and gateways are included. At this layer
    whole environmental conditions are sensed and then actuate according to a predefined
    instructions. Microcontroller plays the supervisor role and performs networking
    related operations and some other functionality which are done by sensors and
    actuators. An IoT based functional frame work is shown in figure 6. The functional
    framework shows that how agriculturists and farmers can access multiple databases
    with the assistance of support layer from application layer. Business layer contains
    all necessary operation which are important for any IoT farm. Data acquisition
    layer provides connection with session layer through IoT protocols like MQTT,
    AMQP and COAP etc. FIGURE 6. Functional framework for an agricultural information
    service model. Show All 2) Cloud Infrastructure Cloud provides a large amount
    of storage through large virtualized servers which are connected together to perform
    necessary action. A cloud based IoT design has been presented in [41] for precision
    farming. In which IoT techniques are applied to analyze and manage data from farms
    through sensors and devices to generate information for decision making. Design
    recommendations for IoT agricultural network on the basis of Cloud is shown in
    Figure 7. FIGURE 7. IoT agricultural network platform based on cloud. Show All
    Platform has been proposed on the basis of four layers which are Cloud Storage,
    Gateway, Fog Computing and hardware modules. Cloud storage layer centerlized the
    all agricultural related data such as weather related, soil, fertilization, crop
    and agricultural marketing in the cloud and provides on demand resources through
    networked infrastructure. Analyics resources and web services are also installed
    on cloud or internet which are accessible by cloud services. Most of the devices
    or sensors are not designed in such a way which can connect with internet for
    the purpose of data sharing. To resolve this data sharing problem local gateways
    are designed which act as bridge between all hardware devices and sensors for
    connectivity, security and controllability. Implementation of gateway in greenhouse
    or field improves the ability of automation and control the real time greenhouse
    monitoring system. Hardware modules and cloud services are distributed whereas
    resources are integrated through fog computing. Fog computing reduces the computational
    load of cloud and ensures the real time processing. Basic purpose of fog computing
    in this proposed network platform is to leverage the on demand scalability of
    cloud computing resources by taking the advantage of both cloud and edge computing.
    In hardware modules multiple actuators, sensors, microcontrollers and central
    processing unit have been implemented to monitor and sense various agricultural
    variables. Hardware modules are distributed in global or local networks and used
    to create services or processes. For the implementation of smart farming fast
    response time and capability to exchange information is necessary. Both of these
    requirements (fast response time and capability to exchange information) are fulfilled
    by two protocols that are Representational State Transfer (REST) and Message Queuing
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT). Instead of using big data center distributed system
    is more effective for smart farming because it breaks up large computation into
    easy and smaller tasks like: Crop, Temperature, nutrients, energy, climate, moisture
    of soil etc. C. IoT Agricultural Network Topology and Protocols IoT agricultural
    network topology shows the arrangement of multiple elements of an IoT Agricultural
    network and represents an ideal scenario for smart farming. Figure 8 described
    how heterogeneous computing grid collects necessary sensor data by using multiple
    sensing devices such as moisture sensor, humidity sensor, temperature sensor,
    gas sensor, ph sensor, ultra violet sensor etc and forms an IoT agricultural network
    topology. FIGURE 8. Conceptual illustration of IoT-based ubiquitous agricultural
    solutions. Show All This ubiquitous Agricultural solution transforms the storage
    capacity of multiple electronic devices like Smartphone, Laptops, and agricultural
    terminals into hybrid computing grids. Figure 9 visualize a scenario in which
    multiple crop parameters are monitored by implementing agricultural devices and
    sensors in all over the field. FIGURE 9. Farm remote monitoring in agriculture.
    Show All Sensed data is then analyzed and stored, and stored data from multiple
    sensors and devices becomes useful for aggregation. On the basis of aggregation
    and analysis agriculturists/farmer can monitor the different crop variables in
    all over the field from anywhere. Moreover, topology consists of a proper network
    configuration for the streaming of agricultural videos. For example figure 9 support
    the streaming of pests via an interconnected network with an internet protocol
    (IP), GSM, WiMAX and access service network gateway. 1) Low Power WSN Topology
    Figure 10 shows a topology in which low power wireless sensor network has been
    designed to monitor and control the various farming factors. In this topology
    ZigBee is being used for data transmission which consists of multiple end devices
    and router to propagate the information on larger distances. End devices which
    are scattered in the field consist of different kind of sensors such as temperature,
    gas, humidity, soil, Motion detector, PH, UV, PIR sensors and a microcontroller.
    FIGURE 10. Low power WSN topology. Show All End devices are directly connected
    to the router and controller, where controller communicates with base station
    by using serial port to analyze the received information. According to software
    monitoring perspective each end device is properly initialized and attached sensors
    are activated in an appropriate way. Once the sensors are activated then each
    device follows the router to connect in the same way according to which they have
    been designed. After confirmation end device may connect to the WSN by using identical
    key. Data which is collected through sensors is send to the base station which
    takes analysis on received data. When the sensors attached with end devices are
    being read then data is transmitted via ZigBee to the Controller or router. Major
    advantage of this net topology is its bi-directional communication by using ZigBee.
    2) IoT Protocols for Agriculture There are many IoT communication protocols which
    are widely used in agriculture for the purpose of smart farming. By using these
    protocols farmers can communicate in a more convenient way and make more efficient
    decisions for smart farming to enhance and monitor the growth of crop. Most common
    wireless protocols which are being used named: IEEE 802.11 WIFI, 2G/3G/4 G-Mobile
    Communications Standards, LoraWan, WiMax, Low Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks,
    Bluetooth, RFID, and ZigBee. Comparison of all these wireless protocols is given
    in Table 1. TABLE 1 Comparison of Existing Wireless Protocols a: IEEE 802.11 WiFi
    IEEE 802.11 is a compilation of communication standards Wireless Local Area Network
    that is 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n and 802.11ac. All these standards operate
    in different bandwidths that are 5 GHz, 2.2GHz, 2.4/5 GHz, 60 GHz and 5 GHz. Data
    transfer range of these standards is from 1Mb/s to 7 Gb/s. Its communication range
    is from 20 m to 100 m [42]. A wifi based wireless sensor network in IoT has been
    discussed for smart agriculture [43]. b: LoraWan LoraWan is a long range communication
    protocol which is developed by an open and non-profit association namely Lora
    TM Alliance. The main purpose of this LoraWan protocol is to assure the interoperability
    between multiple operators [44]. To improve agricultural productivity and anticipate
    the problems a framework has been presented in [45] whose component based on Lora
    and ARIMA technology. c: WiMax Data transfer range of Worldwide Interoperability
    for microwave access is from 1.5 Mb/s to 1 Gb/s. But now a days with the advancement
    of technology data transfer rate has been changed [46]. WiMax provides broadband
    multi access connectivity that includes fixed, portable, nomadic and mobile communication
    through wired or wireless connectivity. Both WiFi and WiMax technologies have
    been deployed in Ministry of Food and Agriculture, Ghana (MOFA) which enables
    user to connect either WiMax networks or building Wifi [47]. d: 2G/3G/4G-Mobile
    Communications Standards There are multiple generations of Mobile Communication
    Standards consist of Second Generation, Third Generation, and Fourth Generation.
    IoT devices Communicate by using these standards over cellular networks. Through
    the use of mobile communication farmer can detect temporal variability across
    their fiels and monitor crop yield, soil and climate conditions [48]. e: LR-WPAN
    Low Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks figure out the specification of high
    level communication standards like ZigBee. Data transfer rate of LR-WPAN consist
    of 40 Kb/s-250 Kb/s. The major property of this standard is that it provides low
    speed and low cost communication services [49]. LR-WPAN is mostly used for indoor
    agriculture such as home garden or in small farms. f: RFID RFID works on the principal
    by assigning a unique number individually to each object in order to record information.
    RFID consists of readers, host and tags where tags receive and transmit radio
    waves due to which it is also known as responder. RFI tags consist of active tags
    and passive tags which are available in different sizes and shapes. Passive tag
    is more advantageous as compare to active tag because it is cheap than active
    tags. Tags have unique ID number and environmental information such as moisture
    level, temperature condition, and humidity etc. These tags are embedded and attached
    in multiple objects to identify that object. g: ZigBee ZigBee is on the top of
    IEEE 802 standards created by ZigBee Alliance. It is a set of specifications for
    device to device network having low power data rates. With the advancement of
    technology and increasing the demand of throughput there is a need of faster and
    low power consumption technology. These requirements are fulfilled by more established
    technologies which provides faster data transfer. In agriculture environment IoT
    sensors sense the data and transfer it towards remote server. After sensing, collected
    data is analyzd for decisions making [50]. h: MQTT MQTT is a messaging protocol
    in IoT which is mainly designed for remote connections. It’s a bandwidth efficient
    protocol and uses little battery power. MQTT is used for continuous analysis and
    deploy a smart system for agriculture sector. A low cost web based IoT solution
    has been presented by using MQTT for monitoring, tracking and analyzing agricultural
    data and collect knowledge from field ambience and improve environmental conditions
    [51]. By using MQTT a low cost irrigation system has been proposed for receiving
    and transmitting sensor information [52]. i: SigFox It’s a low data rate and an
    ultra narrowband wireless cellular network which is appropriate for IoT and machine
    type communications [53]. To construct a geo location system SigFox network was
    used which localize animals pasture of the whole summer [54]. System proposed
    in [55] helps the farmers to locate their cattle’s position and increase their
    productivity. j: Bluetooth Bluetooth is a low power and low range Personal Area
    Network which is best for short range mobile communication. There are many IoT
    agricultural devices which are bluetooth enabled such as Farmnote Air gateway
    and color sensor work with bluetooth enabled sensors. Bluetooth has ubiquitous
    nature due to which it is considered as an appropriate technology for multi-tier
    agricultural applications [56]. SECTION IV. IoT Agriculture Applications IoT agriculture
    system applied as an array of wide variety of fields such as, Precision farming,
    livestock monitoring, and greenhouse monitoring. Agriculture applications have
    been categorized into three sections: IoT agricultural applications, Smartphone
    based applications and sensor based applications. IoT and sensor based applications
    categorization has been illustrated in figure 11 which is framed by reviewing
    the today’s available IoT solutions in agriculture. FIGURE 11. IoT structure in
    agriculture. Show All A. IoT Agricultural Application Domains There are number
    of IoT agriculture applications which are being used to create more efficient
    resources for agriculture productivity. Main domains of IoT agriculture applications
    are precision farming, livestock monitoring, greenhouse monitoring and agricultural
    drones. The following subsection consists of various types of agricultural applications.
    1) Precision Farming Precision farming helps the farmers to improve, automate
    and optimize all feasible directions in order to enhance the agricultural productivity
    and make cropping system smart [57]. Different IoT sensors are deployed to measure
    soil quality, weather conditions, moisture level, and effectively plan to optimize
    harvesting techniques. To enhance the crop production a correlation analysis between
    agricultural environment information and crop statistical analysis has been developed
    to collect crop data [28]. In [58] an IoT based platforms has been developed for
    precision agriculture and ecological monitoring. IoT based weather forecasts helps
    to optimize productivity and take anticipatory analysis to prevent the crop from
    damage. Multiple monitoring devices/sensors are used to predict pest behavior,
    plant or crop growth and address any pending pest issue before they damage crop.
    Ranchers use IoT based irrigation solutions to manage and analyze crop irrigation
    requirements. In [59] a remote agricultural monitoring platform has been presented
    on the basis of monitored data. A conceptual architecture based on cyber systems
    and software defined setworks has been presented in [60] for precision farming.
    IoT base Precision farming consist of multiple monitroing and controling applications
    such as climate conditions monitoring, soil patterns monitoring, pest and crop
    disease monitoring, irrigation, determine optimal time to plant and harvest and
    tracking/tracing. a: Climate Conditions Monitoring In agriculture it is the most
    important to monitor weather conditions continuously so that future activities
    can be planed accordingly. Weather stations are the most popular gadgets in the
    field of agriculture which are used to monitor different climte conditions. Weather
    parameters which are being monitored include temperature, humidity, wind direction,
    and air pressure etc. Located across the field, weather stations collect the environmental
    data and send it to the cloud server. Collected data is used for weather analysis
    to map climate conditions, and provide new insights to take required actions to
    improve agricultural productivity. US Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
    has been defined a weather related approach called Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA)
    which helps the user to transform agriculture system by identifying climate conditions
    [61]. A wireless sensor network has been deployed by using IoT technology to monitor
    weather changes by integrating the sensors and devices [62]. b: Soil Patterns
    Soil monitoring has become one of the most demanding practices in agriculture
    field for both industries and farmers. In soil monitoring there are many environmental
    issues which affects on crop production. If hese kinds of issues are identified
    data accurately then the farming patterns and processes can be understand easily.
    Soil patterns which are being monitored consists of Soil Humidity, moisture, fertilization
    and temperature. Soil humidity and moisture sensors are deployed to monitor the
    moisture content in soil [63]. An adequate amount of fertilization in the field
    also increase crop yield [64]. Soil monitoring test report increase crop productivity
    and recommends an appropriate fertilization solutions to farmer [65]. Moreover,
    identification of contaminated soil by using IoT technologies protect the field
    from over fertilization and crop loss. c: Pest and Crop Disease Monitoring Root
    causes of revenue and production losses are crop diseases. Due to the boom of
    IoT agricultural system has been changed into digital system which helps the farmer
    to make informed decisions. Prediction of crop diseases at early stages helps
    the farmers to generate more revenue by saving crop from pest attacks. IoT protect
    crop in multiple ways by detecting different diseases and prevent crop from animal
    attacks. An IoT based monitoring system has been presented in [66] to monitor
    the wheat diseases, pest and weeds. Crop raiding is the biggest issue due to contraction
    of cultivated land into different wildlife haunts. In [67] a monitoring and repelling
    system for the protection of crop against wild animals attack has been presented.
    Detection of crop disease at early stages is very challenging in the field of
    agriculture. Because to detect crop or leaf disease a team of experts is called,
    which is expensive and time taking process. Whereas, automatic detection of diseases
    is very beneficial, accurate and cheaper for farmer as compared to manual observation
    by experts. Image processing technique also plays a vital role for the earlier
    detection of plant disease [68]. A crop disease detection scenario has been shown
    in figure 12. FIGURE 12. Disease detection scenario. Show All Sensed raw data
    via sensing devices is converted into usable format via remote server and then
    stored into database which is displayed through a user interface. After getting
    data multiple data mining models are applied for disease (bacterial, fungal, viral
    etc) analysis. d: Irrigation Monitoring System IoT improve the current irrigation
    system in a more innovative way. A farmer can optimize irrigation system in multiple
    ways by monitoring weather conditions and soil conditions. IoT technology monitor
    irrigation system in four ways like weather forecasting data, control and monitor
    whole field from anywhere, Ethernet connection and WIFI. This modern irrigation
    system facilitates the farmers by installing multiple sensors, reducing farmers
    monthly irrigation cost, and limit water resources [69]. In [70] an intelligent
    irrigation management system has been presented by using Maching learning and
    open source technologies which sense different soil and weather parametrs. An
    IoT based Low cost irrigation system has been designed in [71] which uses HTTP
    and MQTT protocols to inform the user. Water quality is monitored by sensor nodes
    which are empowered with wireless communication. IoT technology measure both physical
    and chemical constraints of ph, dissolved, temperature, conductivity and oxygen
    [72]. Gathered data about water management system is viewed on internet by using
    cloud computing services. Recently multiple IoT irrigation platforms have been
    developed to control the water consumption in the field. In [73] a simple irrigation
    system has been developed by using WSN. In more advance system users can control
    the process of irrigation through cellular technologies. Likewise, system is proposed
    in [75] in which user transfer sensors data via cellular technologies to a database
    system. e: Determine the Optimal Time to Plant and Harvest IoT increase operational
    efficiency and enhance the crop productivity by determining the best possible
    time to harvest and plant. IoT amalgamate multiple existing technologies like
    cloud computing applications, end user applications, wireless sensor networks
    (WSN’s) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) to determine the accurate time
    of weeding and seeding [76]. f: Tracking and Tracing IoT provides informative
    data to agricultural companies for better decisions making such as planning, managing
    and connect with business partners intelligently by saving money and time. In
    growing environment soil, air, water, fertilizers, and pesticides conditions are
    monitored by RFID and Global Positioning System (GPS). GPS system is used to find
    the exact location of agriculture field and monitor various agricultural parameters
    by using wireless communication networks. In [77] an architecture has been develop
    which remotely monitor the soil condition and soil structure as per requirement
    of crops culture. In this structure ZigBee is connected with other devices like
    content management system (CMS), Global System for Mobile (GSM) and General Packet
    Radio Service (GPRS) by using Wireless sensor networks to monitor and realize
    real time data checking. GPS provides interface to interact with ARM (an intelligent
    monitoring system to achieve functions like SMS/MMS) and gives an alarm to farm
    manager when an unwanted changes occur and helps the farmers to take corrective
    action. Although it’s operational and maintenance cost is high but it is widely
    used in agriculture due to its exact location monitoring and tracking property.
    g: Farm Management System The adoption of smart farming is correspondingly increasing
    the amount of productivity by reducing the environmental impact but this smart
    farming technique can be possible via Farm Management System (FMS). FMS is a key
    element for processing, planning, and decision making for the purpose of smart
    farming [78]. An integrated FMS allows the farmers to monitor the entire where
    whole data is collected via WSN, GSM modules and microcontroller. An identifier
    is used on the sensors and devices in all over the farm which gives the proper
    knowledge of fertilization, weather data, automatic buffer zone width monitoring,
    and automatic detail record is generated according to per day activities of farm.
    This whole information is stored in the computer in standard format and can be
    accessible via cell phone or internet for further processing. To optimize the
    use of water resources an automated irrigation and monitoring system is used [73].
    Apart from irrigation system farm is also protected from pest and animal intrusion
    [66], [67]. h: Agricultural Drones Drones are defined as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
    (UAVs) which are being utilized in agriculture to improve various practices of
    farming. These flying devices are controlled remotely by remote control or autonomously
    programmed. Agricultural processes which are performed by drones are crop health
    assessment, spraying, screening, planting, scouting reports, measurement of nitrogen
    in wheat and analysis of soil conditions. Drones facilitate the farmers via integration
    with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) mapping, and crop health imaging. Drones
    are mostly deployed in large farms where issues related to bacteria fungus are
    difficult to handle and require regular monitoring. In the area of agriculture
    pesticides and fertilizers are very important for crop yield [65], [66]. Agricultural
    drones are carrying out this job efficiently because of its high speed and effectiveness
    in the spraying operation. In addition they also deployed to monitor forests,
    livestock and aquaculture. An organization Precision Hawk is using drones for
    valuable data gathering through sensors for surveying mapping, and imaging of
    agricultural land. They perform in-flight monitoring, farmers enters the detail
    about which field to survey and select a ground resolution. An IoT based Farm
    management information system approch has been developed to meet the bussiness
    objectives [29]. Agricultural drones are integrated with GPS devices cameras and
    sensors to monitor crop health, like planting, crop spraying, screening and analysis
    of soil. There are many other advantages of drone’s utilization like crop health
    imaging, plant counting, amount of nitrogen in wheat, plant height, drainage mapping,
    and weed pressure etc. 2) Greenhouse Monitoring In greenhouse plants are grown
    under controlled environment. This glasshouse technology provides benefits to
    growing plants anytime anywhere by monitoring appropriate environmental conditions.
    Cultivation of greenhouse is more intense, therefore in terms of controlling and
    monitoring it requires high precision. To monitor environmental or weather conditions
    there have been several studies on the applications of WSN’s in greenhouse. Recent
    studies shows that how IoT can be implemented in greenhouse to minimize the human
    resources, accumulate energy and provides direct link of greenhouse from ranchers
    to customers. Most of the studies have focused only on remote monitoring and localized
    [14]–[16]. In addition, for the purpose of high precision there have been a lot
    of studies which integrates meta-processing structure with data to transfer it
    on remote infrastructures through internet. By applying well evaluated crop models,
    assessment of the crop status helps the ranchers to take better decisions [80].
    In Figure 13 a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has been implemented to monitor the
    greenhouse environment. Whole network is divided into multi parts which processes
    the data and gives feedback. FIGURE 13. WSN for monitoring greenhouse environment.
    Show All Data can be obtained by corresponding sensors and detectors and then
    transferred to the main server for processing. In physical implementation the
    major components are the sensors and network for accurate data transmission. Growers
    setup the different monitoring devices and sensors according to the specific requirements
    and track or record the required information. Agriculturists make better decisions
    by analyzing the received information and achieve specific goals by obtaining
    optimal data. There are many IoT based greenhouse applications such as water management,
    plant monitoring, and climate monitoring etc. a: Water Management To measure the
    exact amount of required water in greenhouses is a key problem. Smart sensors
    are implemented which are controlled by applying multiple IoT techniques to avoid
    from excessive use of water. In greenhouses water management is carried out by
    using automatic drip irrigation which works by following soil mositure threshhold
    that is set accordingly [81]. b: Plant Monitoring IoT sensors and cameras creates
    ideal environment for plants by monitoring the state of plants regularly and generates
    an alert if any problem is recognizable. On the other side, cloud based IoT solutions
    store the sensed data and view it periodically which is helpful for growers to
    ensure that all plants obtains ideal attention in the greenhouse [82]. c: Climate
    Monitoring There are many parameters which are combined to maintain and create
    an ideal environment for plants within strict limits such as, the maintenance
    of ventilation, temperature, carbon dioxide, and oxygen level. This can be made
    possible by deploying IoT enabled greenhouse where smart devices and sensors share
    their information for strong decision making [81]. 3) Livestock Monitoring Optimal
    environment or weather circumstances which absorbs excessive amount of climate
    conditions leaves negative impact on the productivity of animals that is a serious
    issue for many researchers [83]. Whereas, due to increasing the demand of high
    quality dairy products precision livestock also considered as the major concern.
    Each year ranchers lose a large amount of profit because of animals illness. But
    IoT based livestock management solutions helps the farmers to improve the farming
    principles, livestock conditions and dairy products [11]. Just like crop monitoring
    sensors, different livestock monitoring sensors are also attached to the animals
    to monitor their log performance. Livestock monitoring factors varies on the categories
    of animals under consideration such as conductivity of milk, pest attack, humidity,
    and water quality. By tagging RFID to individual animal allow farmers to track
    their location, thereby preventing animal from theft. Connected sensors and wearables
    in the livestock allow the farmer to monitor overall animals’ activities and data
    streamed to the cloud directly helps the farmers to identify the issues. Cowlar
    and SCR by Allflex are using smart agriculture sensors to monitor animals health,
    activity, temperature, nutrition and collect information on each individual as
    well as about the herd [84], [85]. In the field of livestock several studies have
    been realized. Wireless Sensor have been used which are most advantageous for
    large farm as well as for hazardous gas monitoring. An IoT based livestock scenario
    is shown in Figure 14. FIGURE 14. IoT based livestock scenario. Show All In the
    field different IoT sensing devices have been deployed to monitor the weather
    conditions via weather station and sense other activities in the field by all
    other data sources which have been implemented in the whole farm. Sensed data
    is stored on the cloud server, which user can use for decision making. User can
    interact remotely by using multiple smart devices (Laptops, Tablets, and Mobile
    etc.). Some IoT base applications of livestock monitoring have discussed below:
    a: Animal Temperature Monitoring Identification of disease symptoms and prevention
    is the major function for animal health monitoring. Normal body temperature of
    dogs is 38.3°C-39.2°C and cow’s is 38.5°C-39.5°C. When the body temperature is
    increased or decreased from the normal body temperature then it indicates that
    animal is suffering from any disease [86]. b: Heat Stress Level Heat stress decreases
    the cow’s milk productivity with same dietary input, due to which farmers face
    the cost production issues. In summer season moisture content becomes low due
    to which stress level in animals increased, because of this animal can also die.
    c: Physical Gesture Recognition Gesture analysis can be made by using IoT animal
    monitoring devices. Animal’s gesture behavior is classified into different groups
    such as in cattle, this behavior is consisting of two classes that are traveling
    and stationary. Traveling behavior consists of animal’s walking, running and grazing
    whereas stationary behavior is animal’s sitting, sleeping and standing. d: Rumination
    Rumination monitor the digested food by animal and it is detected by mounting
    a monitoring device in the animal’s (cows) nose. In this way farmer can get accurate
    indication about animal’s health. e: Heart Rate Measurement of heart rate is an
    indirect method which impacts due to the agitation and stress that cow have. Normal
    heart rate of cow is 43 to 84 bpm whereas calf’s normal heart rate is 100 to 140
    bpm. By using IoT devices and sensors heart rate can be monitored constantly.
    f: GPS Based Monitoring GPS system is used to obtain the specification of farm
    and sends the monitored parameters to central monitoring station by using wireless
    sensor network. To prevent animals from theft, wild attacks or weather conditions
    a repelling system has been provided by using wireless technologies like Zigbee,
    WIFI, and LoWPAN [88]. B. Agricultural Solutions by Using Smart Phones From the
    last few years it has been observed that integration of electronic devices with
    smartphones innovate the technology world and smartphones are taken as a driver
    of IoT. To make smart phones versatile in agriculture field various hardware and
    software have been designed. A good (but not complete) survey of smart phone apps
    providing agricultural solutions has been presented [98]. Figure 15 showing a
    classification illustration of smart phone apps for smart farming. Morever, there
    is a number of recent apps which are serving similar functionalties. All smart
    phone apps which are elaborated in figure 15 discussed in tabular form with a
    small description of each. These smart phone apps are not limited; developers
    from all over the world have developed many e-Farming apps therefore, this paper
    highlighted some selected apps which have been discussed according to their popularity.
    FIGURE 15. Smartphone applications for agriculture. Show All C. IoT Devices and
    Sensors in Agriculture In today’s modern world everything needs to be automatic
    with less man power by consuming less time. Sensor is such a device which can
    fulfill this requirement by detecting same input from the existing physical environment
    and responds back. User set some setting over sensing devices to perform their
    task without the involvement of human. There are some major IoT sensors like:
    Motion Detector, PIR, Soil Moisture, Temperature, Humidity, Barometric Pressure,
    Ultra Violet, PH, and gas sensor. In Table 3 various sensor based agricultural
    applications, their operations and IoT association have been discussed but table
    2 pay attention only on smart phone agricultural apps. TABLE 2 Smartphone Agricultural
    Applications Description TABLE 3 IoT Sensor Based Applications in Agriculture
    SECTION V. IoT Agricultural Security In the coming years agricultural sector is
    expected to witness the extensive acceptance of IoT and grow through the new e-farming
    IoT applications and devices. These agricultural applications and devices are
    expected to deal with a large amount of sensitive data. Due to the distributed
    nature of IoT a single security protocol is not sufficient therefore, leakage
    of information is a major security concern [107]. If we adopt IoT fully in the
    field of agriculture then it will be more critical to analyze and identify the
    distinctive features of privacy and security like different security requirements
    and threat models in the perspective of Agriculture. On the basis of literature
    some security issues has been presented in Figure 16. FIGURE 16. IoT security
    issues in agriculture. Show All A. Security Requirements IoT based smart farming
    security requirements are similar to standard security scenario. Therefore, to
    achieve a secure farming solution we have need to pay attention on the following
    security requirements: Confidentiality: Agricultural information or personal data
    relevant to it should be accessible only by authorized users. Integrity: Here
    integrity means received and stored data or content is not changed. Authentication:
    Authentication means peer devices should have an identity to which it is communicating.
    Data Freshness: It consists of key freshness and data freshness because IoT agricultural
    networks sometime provides varying measurements, therefore it is necessary to
    ensure that every message is fresh. Non Repudiation: Its means a node can never
    deny to send a message that sent earlier. Authorization: Here authorization means
    for network or any other resources only authorized devices are allowed. Self Healing:
    If any device in an IoT based agricultural network fail or out of energy then
    other devices in the network should be able to provide security to some extent.
    B. Security Challenges Security of IoT based smart farming mainly consists of
    three basic requirements that are Authentication, access control and confidentiality
    of the stakeholders. Whereas, at the perception layer network must be secured
    from external attacks and in the network layer aggregation of the data should
    be secured. Authorize specific entities ensures that only authorized user can
    access data from application layer [28]. The most common issue of security in
    the perception layer is physical security that is the security of hardware and
    information acquisition security [108]. Here physical security is very important
    because all the devices are deployed in an open field. That’s why a single security
    protocol is not enough because IoT devices may be implemented in a diverse environment.
    Another major security issue is leakage of information, this information consist
    of location and sensitive data. Security countermeasures consist of data encryption,
    jamming, blocker tags use, modification in tag frequency, and tag destruction
    strategy. There is a difference between sensor nodes and RFID tags that’s’ why
    while implementing encryption algorithm, intrusion detection policies, key distribution
    and routing policies, hardware restrictions should keep in mind [109]. In IoT
    concept data flows from an end device towards gateway, during this process data
    also uploaded to other platform such as cloud infrastructure. There are multiple
    security policies exist for sensor nodes like identity authentication, data filtering,
    cryptographic algorithm, data flow control mechanisms etc. Cheating, wiretapping,
    replay attacks and tampering are also security threats. Due to which, confidentiality,
    authentication and integrity should be must employed while data acquisitions phase
    [17]. C. Stack Challenges Middleware layer also plays a vital role in IoT to increase
    security. Middleware stands in between application layer and network layer which
    is responsible to process data and provide interface for communication between
    these layers. Middleware layer requires secure and confidential data storage.
    Secure transmission via wireless medium is very challenging in IoT deployment
    due to which IoT based architecture is at risk like vulnerability, denial of services,
    illegal access, and many virus injects. In this way data integrity and confidentiality
    is affected by such attacks. According to IoT vision application layer is one
    of the top most layers and closely related to the cloud due to its computation
    resources and storage nature. Security issue at application layer and cloud are
    very similar such as data security, backup, recovery and privacy. Therefore, access
    rights of the data, information and ownership for physical users, machines and
    organizations should manage and administered by a control mechanisms. D. Threat
    Model Both IoT agricultural devices and networks are at risk because of increasing
    attack surface. IoT agricultural threat model consist of three scenarios. First
    one is cloud networks, second is native networks expansion and third is cloud
    services. Threat may be generates from internal or external network. If an attack
    is arise from an agriculture device then it will be considered as one of the more
    severe attack. Because it is very difficult to detect the malicious device within
    the network. In addition an adversary may attack on an agriculture device and
    network and use power device like mobile, laptop or tablet or may be same kind
    of IoT devices to penetrate the network. E. Attack Taxonomy There are many types
    of attacks in IoT paradigm due to which an attacker may attack by adopting a method
    on future or existing IoT agriculture devices and networks. In IoT agricultural
    field threat may be tangible, predictable or unpredictable. In this paper existing
    and possible threats are classified on the basis of three key factors: which are
    Information Disruption, Host, and networks. 1) Attacks on the Basis of Information
    Disruptions Stored agricultural data may be analyzed or manipulated by a hacker
    to provide wrong information. Such attacks consist of Interruption (denial of
    services), Interception (threaten data privacy and confidentiality), Modification
    (unauthorized access to the agricultural data), Fabrication and replay. 2) Attacks
    on the Basis of Host Properties Host properties attacks occure in two forms namely:
    hardware compromise (attacker may attact on device program code data or keys and
    reprogram the devices with malicious code) and software compromise (attacker may
    take the advantage of software vulnerabilities and glitches like operating system,
    applications software and system software). 3) Attacks on the Basis of Networks
    Properties Two types of attacks can be arised on basis of networks properties.
    Namely: standard protocol compromise (to threat service availability like integrity
    and authenticity where attacker deviates from standard protocols) and network
    protocol stack (consist of different types of vulnerabilities). F. Reference Security
    Model for IoT Based Agriculture IoT agricultural paradigms are not yet strong
    but continued to build up due to which currently it is difficult to discover all
    possible threats and vulnerabilities in IoT agricultural field. However, when
    experts find the security solution to solve the apparent security threats at that
    point they should have the ability to mitigate the hidden security issues. To
    accomplish a security solution, security checks should be deployed with dynamic
    properties. Consider a framework in which security mechanism consist of different
    systems which can detect and prevent IoT agricultural system from attacks. Now
    consider, that an attacker generate a new type of attack on agricultural applications
    devices and networks to steal agricultural information integrity. In such conditions
    existing security techniques should indentify this new attack by using dynamic
    algorithm. A security model presented in Figure 17 has been discussed to resolve
    these issue. The model is illustrated with its three security systems: protection
    system is designed to mitigate the attack while, dignosing system collects activity
    data from agricultural applications, networks, nodes and analyzes detected agricultural
    data. Reaction system is designed to help the agricultural entities survive all
    types of attacks. FIGURE 17. An intelligent collaborative security model for smart
    farming. Show All FIGURE 18. Selected IoT agricultural products. Show All Whole
    system has been designed by following dynamic algorithms. To prevent from present,
    probable and hidden attacks this system has strong collaboration. Upon intrusion
    detection system issues an operation command and store in reaction system after
    that share their anomaly diagnosing experience with protection system to prevent
    from further attacks. Operation command receive response from identification service,
    reaction system remove the system failure risks and after that pass out its experience
    with other two systems that are protection and diagnosing systems. In this way
    a complete inter collaboration system is accomplished. SECTION VI. IoT Agricultural
    Industry Trends and Practices The IoT in agriculture field has experienced a burst
    of creativity, activity, venture capital firms and exciting entrepreneurs. The
    space becomes visible as an active group of large firms and new start ups that
    are willing to become the part of what may be a giant market and technologies.
    In this section an extensive record of some products and technologies has been
    provided for a good understanding of IoT position in agriculture field. 3D Crop
    Sensor Array with PAR Addon can be mounted on any location, to monitor temperature,
    humidity and carbon dioxide in the farm [110]. EC-1 Controller monitors the environmental
    conditions and then programs them to control the environment by turning off and
    on devices [111]. Arable Mark is the first device which links the global weather
    data within the field observations developed by Arable. With the unprecedented
    ground truth accuracy device makes informed decisions and deliveres real time
    monitoring information to the palm of user’s hand [112]. Growlink designed Growlink
    one controller to deliver smart farming experience. It has highest processing
    power and components quality to coordinate with multiple sensors and devices in
    all over the farm. This device is simply all in one and farmers can expand the
    system according to their requirements by adding additional microcontroller via
    IP networks [113]. Easternpeak offers an IoT GreenIQ agricultural device which
    control irrigation and saves water of your garden’s lawn from anywhere. Growers
    can save up to 50% outdoor water bills by using a GreenIQ smart sprinklers controller
    [114]. Grofit provides a climate monitoring device based on Bluetooth and its
    transmission range is up to 200 m in all over field. This device also provide
    data log which store maximum 30 days measurements. Growers can monitor air humidity,
    real time air temperature and sun radiations by using this device [115]. MeteoHelix
    weather station designed by allmeteo which provides reliable, stable and open
    meteorological solutions according to weather requirements. This weather station
    provides multiple features like temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, dew
    point, sun radiations, and solar radiations measurement [116]. Leaf Wetness sensor
    is developed by Smart Element which determine the wetness of leaf by electrical
    resistance on the surface of sensor. It is used to measure wet and dry time on
    the leaf surface [117]. Swip Track Micro locates any moving object in all over
    the field that may be any farming machine, vehicle or engines [118]. Waspmote
    Plug & Sense! Smart Agriculture Xtreme is a sensor node which provides more reliable
    and accurate information about weather. This sensor measures the wind and rainfall
    condition via optical technology. The presence of fertilizers and soil morphology
    can be analyzed through this sensor by measuring the oxygen level, water content,
    and soil water potential [119]. SKY – Lora Weather Station can easily communicate
    to nearby master sensor through LoRa [120]. This is suitable for those locations
    where there is nearby connectivity. This weather station can send data up to 600
    meter away to a master sensor which has WIFI connection. Pycno has been developed
    a Pulse IoT automation sensor which comes in a self-sustained package powered
    by a tiny solar panel [121]. Sensor is WIFI and LoRa enabled device which has
    multiprotocol port in the bottom. In future Pulse Automation Sensor and Pycno
    soil sensor will be integrated to actuate devices and talk with each other in
    the field. CropX Starter Kit – Soil Temperature 24/7 is a real-time soil-temperature
    monitoring Sensor. This sensor has direct cellular connection and better accuracy
    which provides advance sensing capabilities [122]. Some top technologies firm’s
    trends and directions are highlighted in Table 4. TABLE 4 IoT Agricultural Trends
    and Directions of Some Well Known Technology Industries SECTION VII. IoT Smart
    Farming Policies and Success Stories A. Policies Many countries have understood
    the importance of IoT and facilitating through its advance monitoring techniques.
    Government of different countries is seizing the IoT opportunity and investing
    maximum to boost up the crop productivity. Adaptation of IoT technology in different
    countries has been discussed in this section. 1) Australia Government of Australia
    has invested AU$ 134 million to boost up farming. Due to this large investment
    a center was created by a private company in Sidney to implement IoT technologies
    for Smart farming [150]. In 2014 an Innovative Network for Precision Agriculture
    System was established for the purpose of a collaborative frame work to create
    a national agenda in Australian agriculture. In terms of privacy and security,
    in 2015 an American farm Bureau took the lead in establishing a privacy and security
    set for farm data [151]. 2) Ireland Irish Farmer’s Association (IFA) Launched
    a program for agriculturists to reduce the cost, to improve the soil quality and
    guides the farmer how to save water and energy by adopting new technologies [8].
    When the farmers follow these instructions the results were very positive and
    encouraging. Companies saved almost 8700 euro, 10% reduction in green house gas
    emission, 21% savings in pasture management and 47% saving was achieved by Soil
    Fertility. In 2016 a nationwide SigFox network was launched by VT-Networks Ireland
    which provides solution for tracking security sensors and farm assets [153]. 3)
    France Ministry of Agriculture in France has become the partner of the Agriculture
    Innovation Project 2025. The basic aim of this project is to increase the strengthen
    of agricultural land, monitor the climate conditions and create incubators to
    improve agriculture field in France. Ministry of agriculture also share the collected
    data with farmer’s to propose new solution in the field of Agriculture [154].
    French agriculture is administrated by European Union (EU) rules and supported
    through a policy called Common Agriculture Policy (CAP). A new CAP framework was
    defined in 2015 at EU level for next five years which is beneficial for different
    agro ecology projects for farming. 4) China In 2016 china launched its 13th five
    years plan to integrate IoT in the field of agriculture to enhance profitability
    [156]. Project has been started in different eight provinces, with multiple products,
    technologies and 426 applications. Data was collected from multiple provincial
    and national level data centers. Moreover, NB-IoT App by Huawei company in china
    transforming the agriculture in a more efficient and an innovative way. NB-IoT
    provides low cost agriculture solutions as compare to cellular network where gateway
    implementation is not necessary. Huawei NB-IoT has large number of connections
    and wide coverage due to which it can resolve issue of scattered agricultural
    data [157]. 5) Malaysia Agricultural policy in Malaysia was established in two
    periods of time policy before and after independence 1948–1957 and 1957–2020 [158].
    The purpose of the policy was to enhance the growth of crop and decrease the poverty.
    Multiple solutions have been created by Malaysian Institute of Microelectronic
    System (MIMOS) which are best for agriculture development. A sensor named Mi-MSCANT
    PH has been developed by MIMOS to gather environmental data. An agricultural framework
    has been developed by MIMOS to integrate IoT technologies which create a bonding
    between suppliers, traders, and agricultural producers mutually in unified manners.
    This framework utilizes technologies named Micro Electro Mechanical System (MEMS)
    and WSN which automatically collect environmental data [159]. 6) USA USA has funded
    million Dollars to generate new agricultural technologies to fulfill the necessary
    requirements of energy and food. National Institute of Food and Agriculture worked
    on a project that is Internet-of-Ag-Things and develop sensing technologies for
    smart farming practices. The major purpose of this project is to develop precision
    technologies to enhance the efficiency of agriculture industries and make better
    use of water, fertilizers and organic food [160]. The U.S. Department of Agriculture
    (USDA) has started a project to address water management challenges and develop
    new solution for those issues which are affecting agriculture. Technology experts
    are using USDA datasets to improve and design agricultural services [161]. 7)
    Thailand In Thailand National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC)
    applying innovative IT technologies for the purpose of smart farming and their
    major focus is on four agricultural products including Rubber, Rice, Sugar and
    Cassava [162]. The major concern of this movement is to increase the agricultural
    productivity and facilitate the farmers in all rural areas of Thailand [163].
    Faculty of Science and Technology at Thammasat University developed an IoT-based
    irrigation control system which helps the grower to preset watering cycle timing
    in advance. A smart farm service provider namely; FarmD Asia was established in
    2015 to boost up the agricultural productivity by its flagship products. FarmD
    Asia has also designed a pesticides aerial drone which covers upto eight acres
    land in single fly. National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA)
    launched Agricultural System Integrator (ASI) program which was primarily designed
    for farmers to start and run smart farm successfully [164]. 8) India Different
    IoT policies have been formulated by Indian government in order to leverage the
    strength of their agricultural field in all over the world. Indians basic purpose
    is to monitor the earth density, soil conditions, temperature and alerts the farmers
    to control pest related issues. In 2015 a policy on IoT in India was released
    by Ministry of Communication and Information Technology to transform digital landscape
    by using IoT [165]. 9) Philippine Philippines have used the remote sensing techniques
    to increase the production of rice. They are also using ground data processing
    and satellite imagery techniques to generate more information on different agricultural
    conditions. University of Southeastern Philippines (USeP) proposed an intelligent
    solution to monitor crop heat stress by using IoT technology with the collaboration
    of Western Mindanao State University (WMSU). In this project research team is
    on the brink with an effective technology counter heat stress which helps the
    farmer to get maximum benefit with the fewest inputs [166]. B. Food and Agriculture
    Organization of United NATIONSNN Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations
    (FAO) is an e-agricultural organization which follows the international efforts
    to fulfill the deficiency of food in all over 130 countries worldwide. FAO predicted
    that there is a most probability that world population will reach 9.8 billion
    by 2050 therefore, it is necessary to increase the food production 70% by 2050
    to fulfils the growing demand of food through the utilization of IoT technology.
    Mitsubishi Corporation (MC) and Vegetalia, changing Japanese agricultural sector
    by their join forces through AI and IoT. By using tensiometer sensors Tevatronic
    develops an autonomous irrigation system which is placed in the ground near the
    plants for monitoring. From the last 74 years FAO has been changed the agricultural
    world by launching its top ten achievements given in table 5 [167]. TABLE 5 Top
    10 E-Agricultural Strategies of FAO C. IoT Agriculture Success Stories This research
    indicates that there have been several tools and techniques which helps the farmers
    to improve the crop productivity in a more innovative ways. Some IoT agriculture
    relevant technologies have been discussed in section I which provides additional
    tools to the farmers or agriculturists to increase the crop yield. Section III
    describes the different IoT and Smartphone based applications which facilitate
    the farmers to enhance the agriculture productivity by providing extended benefits.
    However over the globe governments are seizing the IoT opportunities in agriculture
    by making large investment. There are many pilot projects which reflects a great
    potential in the future of IoT in agriculture at country level such as china,
    India, Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan etc. Therefore, in this research we have also
    discussed the results of some pilot projects conducted and being executed in different
    countries. Table 6 prepresents the success stories of these pilot projects in
    different countries with the main IoT agricultural applications (precision farming,
    greenhouse, and livestock). TABLE 6 IoT Agriculture Success Stories SECTION VIII.
    IoT Agricultural Challenges Many researchers have worked on IoT agriculture system
    and solve multiple technological issues and architectural problems by implementing
    and designing various IoT agricultural solutions. Moreover, according to the research
    point of view in the literature, there are also several open issues and challenges
    which are needed to address successfully [57]. There are many challenges which
    are linkage with IoT smart farming deployment and applications. This research
    has identified some explored and unexplored IoT agricultural issues and challenges.
    A. Hardware Challenges Several challenges arise in IoT agricultural setup. First
    of all the equipments which exists at the perception layer are directly expose
    to harsh environmental experience such as, rain, high level temperature, extreme
    humidity, hard winds, and many other possible dangers which destroy electronic
    circuits. End devices works consistently for a long period by depending on inadequate
    batteries power resources. So, a suitable programming tools and less power potential
    is necessary because in case of any program failure instantly battery replacement
    is complicated especially in a large scale open field [144]. B. Networking Challenges
    These challenges are not only for the hardware implementations, but also exist
    at the network layer. Due to high cost of wiring, wireless communication is most
    important for the deployment of IoT based agriculture. Physical deployment shows
    that accepted transceivers performance is exaggerated by human presence, temperature,
    humidity and many other barriers inside the space where wireless device or node
    wants to communicate. Due to which there should use most reliable and robust technologies
    to transfer data according to the environmental challenges and rural conditions
    [8]. A detailed analysis on IoT agriculture networking challenges and issues is
    given [145]. C. IoT Agricultural Platforms IoT agricultural architecture is more
    complicated as compare to other IoT end devices and requires real time monitoring
    system with additional stringent requirements. For this a tailored computing platform
    is needed with run time libraries. A service oriented approach (SOA) can also
    take to build a suitable platform; such services can be exploited by using different
    API’s. In addition, appropriate frameworks and libraries should be developed so
    that agricultural developers can make resourceful use of available document, classes,
    codes and other useful data. D. Other Technical Issues 1) Interfernce To implement
    smart farming a large number of IoT devices are deployed for agricultural purpose
    that creates hindrance especially for those IoT devices which are using unlicensed
    spectrum like Sogfox, ZigBee, LoRa, and WIFI. These technical issues reduce the
    reliability and loss of data. Moreover, unnecessary interference can be eliminated
    by using IoT devices with licensed spectrum. But, among the IoT devices which
    are using cellular licensed spectrum the reprocess of non-orthogonal multiple
    access method can create hindrance because of restricted pilot assignment in cellular
    band. 2) Reliability In agriculture field mostly the IoT devices are deployed
    in an open environment. Due to which there may occur some inconsiderate environmental
    impacts which may cause the communication failure as well as degradation of deployed
    sensors. Therefore, physical safety of IoT devices and system is necessary to
    secure the expensive gadgets from unauthorized user and severe attacks like weather
    conditions or theft. 3) Scalability Billions of IoT devices have been increased
    gradually, due to which more devices are getting connected. Therefor, large number
    of gateways and protocols are needed to support IoT devices. Moreover, IoT agricultural
    back end databases and network applications should be reliable and scalable because
    with the addition of diverse application related operations becomes more complex.
    Therefore, design a highly scalable security scheme and an intelligent IoT system
    for each end device. 4) Resource Optimization Farmers need optimization of resources
    to measure how many IoT devices, gateways, size of cloud storage, and amount of
    transmitted data is required. Due to different farm sizes and variables like crop
    or livestock monitoring resource optimization has become challenging because there
    is a need of different sensors and devices to perform each function. Therefore,
    this will require complex mathematical models and algorithms are required to determine
    the resource allocation for maximum agriculture productivity. 5) Cost Analysis
    and Lack Knwoledge of Technology In the field of agriculture profit margin is
    very important, there is a need of stability the trade-off between the deployments
    of IoT enabling technologies. When an IoT system is deployed the cost of implementations
    are very high like IoT devices/Sensors, gateways, and base station infrastructure.
    After that maintenance cost also important for the use of central services which
    are necessary for IoT devices management, data collection, and information sharing
    among all other services. Moreover, the major factor of slowing IoT in rural areas
    is basically the lack knowledge of IoT and its applications. This is the main
    problem because majority of ranchers is uneducated and lives in rural areas. Therefor,
    it is most important to overcome these obstacles by educating farmers in order
    to generate more revnue [7]. 6) Deployment of LPWA Technologies There is a large
    number of IoT devices in Agriculture scenario, and such devices should liable
    to be heterogeneous in the context of their transmit, receive, sleep, and deep
    sleep along with others. In the terms of power requirements each communication
    layer confronts a supplementary challenge. For example, to confirm the service
    accessibility at MAC layer to find a low power device discovery protocol is a
    difficult task. 7) Universal Platform Adaptation of IoT in agriculture will shift
    from just specific crop to a standard platform which can support multiple smart
    farming applications for crop productivity. This standard platform creates a system
    which can be easily modified to support multiple agricultural applications ranging
    from monitoring to managing. This kind of platform will be free from any kind
    of geographical limitations work as an enabler in IoT agriculture system. 8) Mobility
    IoT agricultural network should have the capability to hold up and maintain the
    farmers mobility. So, that they can connect their farms from anywhere at any time
    [146]. 9) Quality of Service (QOS) Recent studies on QoS highlight that at each
    layer of IoT architecture QoS is required [147] [148]. The ability to make sure
    that devices which needs to transmit sensitive information will be capable to
    do this by using IoT technology without any barrier is still an open research
    issue. There is a need to do more work by providing a mechanism that guarantees
    QoS throughout IoT network layers. E. The Business Model IoT agricultural business
    approach is not still vigorous because it consists of a set of essential elements
    with the latest requirements like new operational policies and processes to transform
    the organizational structure. F. Organizational Challenges When talk about food
    organizations and agricultural sectors, is mean the exchange of information and
    goods transportation. IoT is renovating this whole business process by providing
    reliable and accurate delivery of all products and materials [1]. At the circumference
    of network to store and process the data cloud computing provides highest quality
    of services like efficient storage, computational resources, and application development
    tools for hardware diagnostic. That’s why cloud computing is an ideal accompaniment
    in the world of IoT technologies. At the end of the network a large amount of
    data is produced which needs high cost to transfer towards cloud in terms of latency
    and money [18]. Due to which it is a serious issue because of workload and optimal
    balancing. On the other hand fog computing also the cloud computing extension
    which expanding cloud technologies like tools, and the application development
    scope [149]. SECTION IX. Conclusion All over the globe researchers are exploring
    technological solutions to enhance the agriculture productivity in a way that
    complements existing services by deploying IoT technology. In this article, we
    have presented a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art for IoT in agriculture.
    To this end, we discuss agricultural network architecture, platform, and topology
    which help to access to IoT backbone and facilitates farmers to enhance the crop
    productivity. In addition, this article provides an extensive overview on current
    and continuing advances in IoT agricultural applications, devices/sensors, communication
    protocols and many innovative technologies. This research considers various IoT
    agricultural challenges and security requirements for the better understanding
    of IoT smart farming security. Furthermore, many important dimensions of IoT based
    agricultural including technologies, industries trends and countries policies
    have been also been presented to facilitate various stake holders. Government
    has started patronizing IoT in agriculture and it is anticipated that soon IoT
    in agriculture will revamp the conventional farming method. It is also clear that
    many big organizations have started investing and developing new techniques for
    farm management system using IoT. Finally, it is expected that this comprehensive
    survey results into a very useful piece of information for researchers, professionals,
    agriculturists and policy makers who are participating and working in IoT field
    and agricultural technologies. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

  title: A Survey on the Role of IoT in Agriculture for the Implementation of Smart
    Farming
  verbatim_quote1: Whole system is designed in such a way which controls the sensors,
    actuators, and devices. A sensor performs multiple tasks like soil sensing, temperature
    sensing, weather sensing, light sensing, and moisture sensing. Similarly devices
    perform many control functions like, node discovery, device identification and
    naming services etc. All these functions are performed by any device or sensor
    which is controlled through a microcontroller. This controlling operation is performed
    by any remote device or a computer which is connected through the Internet.
  verbatim_quote2: In the field of agriculture there are multiple applications, protocols
    and prototypes. IoT agriculture research trends include network platform, network
    architecture, applications, security, and challenges among others [28]–[30]. Moreover,
    in many countries and organizations over globe different IoT policies and guidelines
    have been implemented in agriculture field. However in IoT agricultural environment
    a reasonable amount of work has been done and there is a need of thorough study
    on IoT in agriculture context to understand the current research status. To transform
    agriculture technologies via IoT innovation this paper analyzes various issues
    and trends in IoT smart farming.

    rights and content Precision Agriculture (PA), as the integration of information,
    communication and control technologies in agriculture, is growing day by day.
    The Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing paradigms offer advances to enhance
    PA connectivity. Nevertheless, their usage in this field is usually limited to
    specific scenarios of high cost, and they are not adapted to semi-arid conditions,
    or do not cover all PA management in an efficient way. For this reason, we propose
    a flexible platform able to cope with soilless culture needs in full recirculation
    greenhouses using moderately saline water. It is based on exchangeable low-cost
    hardware and supported by a three-tier open source software platform at local,
    edge and cloud planes. At the local plane, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) interact
    with crop devices to gather data and perform real-time atomic control actions.
    The edge plane of the platform is in charge of monitoring and managing main PA
    tasks near the access network to increase system reliability against network access
    failures. Finally, the cloud platform collects current and past records and hosts
    data analytics modules in a FIWARE deployment. IoT protocols like Message Queue
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT) or Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) are used
    to communicate with CPS, while Next Generation Service Interface (NGSI) is employed
    for southbound and northbound access to the cloud. The system has been completely
    instantiated in a real prototype in frames of the EU DrainUse project, allowing
    the control of a real hydroponic closed system through managing software for final
    farmers connected to the platform. Previous article in issue Next article in issue

    WSN Wireless Sensor Networks 1. Introduction New trends in agriculture seek to
    manage crops in controlled environments such as greenhouses, which enable the
    recreation of the quasi–optimal parameters that plants need to improve the production
    or duplicate the environmental conditions of specific geographical areas to locally
    obtain products that are usually imported. Moreover, severe weather variations
    that impact on crop production can be avoided with a tight management of temperature,
    humidity and lighting. Modern agriculture aims at increasing crop yield in terms
    of production and quality. One of the advances in modern agriculture is the spread
    of soilless culture Resh (2012), also known as hydroponics, which further increases
    productivity. However, in comparison to open field vegetable crops, the fertiliser
    requirements are eight to ten times higher. For this reason, these agricultural
    systems also require an intense use of water and fertilisers that have to be managed
    in a efficient way. In open hydroponic systems where drainage is released into
    the environment, up to 31% of nitrates and a 48% of potassium applied are discharged,
    implying pollution and eutrophication of land and water. European Union policies
    try to reduce the environmental costs of intense agriculture through different
    instruments and directives (Common Agricultural Policy - CAP, Nitrates Directive
    - 91/676/EEC, Water framework Directive - 2000/60/IEC). As an alternative to open
    hydroponic systems, full re-circulation systems (also known as closed systems)
    were initially developed in The Netherlands, but the percentage of producers that
    use them in their greenhouses in the rest of Europe is very low, mainly because
    these systems need to be designed and adjusted to the specific conditions where
    production is taking place. The adoption of re-circulation using moderately saline
    water, as is the case of Mediterranean areas, requires detailed information of
    crop response to salinity, in order to optimise management of drainage recirculation.
    However, one of the main problems of closed recirculating systems is the build-up
    of salts in the nutrient solution. It is well known that salinity severely limits
    the productivity of crops and, as a difference from Northern European countries,
    the electrical conductivity of the water used for irrigation in Mediterranean
    areas is usually high. In order to avoid discharge of drainage and maintain the
    electrical conductivity of the nutrient solution at optimal levels for plant growth
    in these areas, it is necessary to add low conductivity water, which can be obtained
    from a purification unit based on a reverse osmosis system. However, these sophisticated
    systems requires high degrees of automation. In recent years high monitoring and
    control capacities are obtained in agronomic systems thanks to the use of new
    information and communication technologies. These combine with industrial automation
    to enable Precision Agriculture (PA) (Gebbers & Adamchuk, 2010). Current sensors
    offer highly accurate values of the status of crops, and actuators are able to
    manage irrigation, change climate factors or enrich the soil with the needed nutrients
    (Mulla, 2013). When appropriate, computer intelligence techniques are also put
    into play to further improve production in PA by reducing diseases and the need
    for human intervention in regular activities. This is a must in extreme PA cases
    such as the previously discussed hydroponics one, where natural resources of common
    agriculture are left aside and even more precise control actions must be carried
    out. Hence, automation is, without doubt, the future of agriculture, but new frameworks
    improving the modularity of hardware and software units, and assuring the precise
    management of crops in an efficient way are needed. Recently the Internet of Things
    (IoT) has implied the integration of communication capabilities to sensors and
    actuators (Atzori, Iera, & Morabito, 2010), which is highly relevant in the PA
    domain (Ray, 2017). Now it is possible to obtain hardware solutions powered with
    firmware that interconnects these final devices with gateways through wireless
    channels and using open and/or regulated protocols that avoid proprietary solutions.
    Wireless sensor networks (WSN) further evolve this with communication topologies
    that reduce infrastructure costs and reduce power consumption, hence reducing
    costs in PA exploitation (Riquelme et al., 2009). These novel sensors and actuators
    also need evolved automation nodes potentially acting as IoT gateways. Hence,
    traditional control units installed at the crop side are now considered Cyber-Physical
    Systems (CPS), involving hardware nodes with computing, storing and communications
    capabilities to control and interact with industrial processes (An et al., 2016).
    CPS is now the scientific-agreed term used for networked (distributed) embedded
    systems to gather data from sensors, communicate with actuators and cooperate
    among them to cover automation needs. At the same level of importance as IoT or
    CPS, cloud computing (Voorsluys, Broberg, & Buyya, 2011) has been the last hit
    in PA (Choudhary, Jadoun, & Mandoriya, 2016). Here an extra level of flexibility
    is offered by a remote software platform providing monitoring and control management.
    These software platforms can be easily extended on demand and avoid the installation
    of complex systems at the local level. In cloud computing, crop data are gathered
    through a communication channel offered by local controllers (e.g., CPS nodes)
    that, additionally, can also allow certain control actions. All data are saved
    by a software entity usually virtualised in a data centre that offers Platform
    as a Service (PaaS) resources. The access to crop monitoring and control features
    is finally offered by web services accessible from a number of platforms, including
    desktop computers and smart phones. Lately, a trendy paradigm not exploited in
    agriculture is fog and edge computing. Traditionally, these paradigms are focused
    on improving system reaction by reducing network delay, since computing nodes
    are close to end devices. However, in the PA area, network performance requirements
    are more relaxed, though a critical issue is the reliability of the channel connecting
    the crops with the control modules. The solution proposed here is to move part
    of the data analytics and control features from the cloud to nodes close to end-devices
    in the network path. This implies a reliable management of CPS actions requiring
    high accuracy and, additionally, intermediate data filtering capabilities. In
    this frame, the solution presented in this paper covers the needs for fully automated
    PA scenarios including the mentioned special case of Mediterranean areas, through
    a three-tier open source software platform that distributes computing at CPS,
    edge and cloud planes, according to the needs of each action. IoT communication
    technologies are used to connect sensors and actuators with CPS nodes. Here, atomic
    control actions are executed at CPS level, while greenhouse main control actions
    are orchestrated by an edge layer composed of four control modules for irrigation,
    climate, nutrition and auxiliary tasks. They are powered by Network Function Virtualisation
    (NFV), so they can be instantiated at different nodes along the network path,
    from the crop to the cloud. IoT communication protocols such as Message Queue
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT) or Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) are used
    to communicate CPS nodes with these subsystems. Finally, the cloud layer is given
    by a FIWARE middleware that stores, processes and enables management web services
    for remote monitoring and control. The cloud module of the platform communicates
    with the rest of system nodes using the Next Generation Service Interface (NGSI),
    in the form of a southbound NGSI to link with edge subsystems, and a northbound
    NGSI to allow access to final applications. According to the state of the art
    presented later, the next novelties are presented in this work: • Highly-flexible
    three-tier architecture for PA that fosters software and hardware modularity across
    the different abstraction levels of the solution. • An NFV-based solution is proposed
    in an edge layer to perform local operation decisions in a PA-based environment,
    which can be deployed opportunistically at different levels of the network. •
    Efficient and reliable PA operations are assured through distributing responsibilities
    between edge and CPS planes, avoiding problems originated from network failures
    when using a remote cloud control. • Full instantiation of the proposal with a
    real field deployment validating the operation of the system in the challenging
    area of hydroponics. The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents
    the works in the literature that aim at solving the PA problem using new information
    and communication technologies. The overall proposed platform is described in
    Section 3, while Section 4 gives details about the FIWARE-based cloud and edge
    solution. Then, a real prototype of the system is described in Section 5. Section
    6 focuses on the real operation of the platform, describing main procedures and
    including validation results extracted from the prototype. Finally, conclusions
    and future works are presented in Section 7. 2. State of the art The first steps
    in PA were focused on the automatic control of actuators on the basis of sensor
    data gathered from crops. Usually, in these systems sensors and actuators were
    wired with an automation node. The control area has evolved gradually, as can
    be seen in the rule-based scheme presented by Canadas, Sanchez-Molina, Rodriguez,
    and del Aguila (2017), or the event-driven solution described by Pawlowski, Sanchez-Molina,
    Guzman, Rodriguez, and Dormido (2017). However, the real advance in the last years
    in PA has been in the line of integrating new information and communication technologies
    to support farmers in management and decision making. The first solutions using
    communication networks in controlled agriculture were based on common Internet
    technologies used in common PC applications. Marhaenanto, Soni, and Salokhe (2013),
    for instance, presented a crop management system that uses remote desktop and
    regular client/server applications. Another set of proposals in this line are
    based on using Web connections to directly access crop sensors and control actuation
    nodes, such as by Bajer and Krejcar (2015). Here, a set of Arduino nodes that
    are wired with sensors and actuators are managed through the Internet, accessing
    a Web application available in the firmware. IoT integration in PA has implied
    an evolution in the way actuators and sensors communicate with gateway nodes and
    even the Internet. Regarding communication technologies, new IoT-capable nodes
    integrate new transceivers able to save energy and create network topologies adapted
    to field conditions, where cellular or WiFi-like base stations are rare. As the
    proposal of Akka and Sokullu (2017) shows, multi-hop topologies using wireless
    sensor networks can allow the routing of data messages through the communication
    nodes to reach a gateway with Internet connectivity. Here, the ZigBee technology
    is used, as by Lamprinos and Charalambides (2015), where gathered data is finally
    accessible through a Web server available in the gateway. More recent advances
    in the IoT area include network protocols to connect with remote devices through
    Internet by using application-level messaging optimised for reducing data rates.
    S. Muthupavithran, Akash, and Ranjithkumar (2016) used the MQTT protocol to collect
    data from sensor nodes at greenhouses for monitoring purposes, for instance. These
    protocols allow the collection and analysis of data at intermediate cloud middleware,
    as discussed by Shukla, Panchal, and Patel (2015). Kaloxylos et al. (2014) presented
    a more developed system in this line. Here, data from a real deployment of sensors
    is gathered by a gateway using ZigBee, and then sent to a data cloud powered by
    FIWARE through Web-based protocols. The work exploits the idea of open interfaces
    to create multiple client applications accessing the cloud module. However, IoT
    protocols are not used and a quite preliminary version of FIWARE is employed.
    Martinez, Pastor, Alvarez, and Iborra (2016) presented research on the cloud plane
    to manage crops in PA environments. Here the FIWARE core, together with a set
    of additional enablers, are used to connect with IoT gateways through several
    protocols, such as MQTT or CoAP, and current and historical data are maintained
    in the cloud for analytics purposes. The FIWARE performance is evaluated for PA
    in terms of a set of synthetic tests, but a real development of the proposal is
    not given. The same research group have presented (Lopez-Riquelme, Pavon-Pulido,
    Navarro-Hellin, Soto-Valles, and Torres-Sanchez (2017)) a real system, but it
    is limited by the technologies and functionalities offered. Data is collected
    from the crops through a Web-based protocol over GPRS and only monitoring features
    are included in the system. An evolution of exclusively cloud-based platforms
    is the inclusion of intermediary processing stages in the data path. Liu (2016)
    performed local preprocessing at data collection gateways, before sending monitoring
    information to the cloud. This idea is further exploited by Ferrandez-Pastor,
    Garca-Chamizo, Nieto-Hidalgo, Mora-Pascual, and Mora-Martnez (2016), where a set
    of IoT protocols and technologies are also evaluated in a real hydroponic deployment.
    However, in these works a lack of flexibility is noticeable in the way edge computing
    is implemented, and this layer is exclusively oriented to data fusion. In general,
    these works in the literature partially cover IoT interconnection, data collection
    and access through clouds, and only some initial edge computing approaches are
    found. Realistic systems offering (1) flexibility in the hardware used at crop
    site, (2) edge computing nodes at which to filter data powered by NFV, and (3)
    efficient and reliable execution of both sensing and control tasks, are not common
    in current works. In this line the current paper presents an integral crop management
    system supporting up-to-date IoT technologies and protocols and supported by FIWARE,
    which divides essential PA tasks in control modules instantiated in virtualised
    nodes that orchestrate atomic tasks to be executed at local CPS. 3. System architecture
    The overall control architecture of the solution presented to cover PA management
    needs is depicted in Fig. 1. It is essentially distributed into three main planes:
    crop (local) CPS tier, edge computing tier, and data analytics and smart management
    at the cloud. The CPS and cloud planes are designed to be respectively deployed
    at the local crop premises and remote data servers, respectively. The intermediate
    layer for edge computing comprises a set of virtualised control modules in the
    form of NFV nodes that can be instantiated along the network path, from the field
    facilities to the cloud plane on the Internet. This increases versatility in the
    deployment of the solution, at the same time connectivity performances with the
    CPS layer are met. Download : Download high-res image (426KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. Overall architecture of the PA platform. The cloud, edge
    and CPS planes are separated by dotted lines. The edge computing modules are instantiated
    as NFV elements, allowing their placement at the most convenient network level.
    At the crop premises, sensors and actuators for PA automation are deployed and
    connected with CPS nodes. Examples of sensors are solar radiation, humidity, temperature,
    CO2, pH meter, electrical conductivity, liquid consumption (flow meters) or pressure
    sensors, while some of the actuators considered are soil and water nutrition pumps,
    valves and activation of devices (watering and ventilation devices, lighting,
    or automated windows). These are connected with CPS units through wired channels
    using industrial serial (usually RS485) or direct digital/analogue I/O connections.
    For wireless communications, 6LowPAN is used to connect with data-loggers, which
    include several sensors. All the CPS units are interconnected with the Internet
    through an access network using multiple technologies, such as microwave radio
    links, fibre optic or DSL. In this architecture, low level operations that require
    minimum latency and high reliability in the communication with sensors or actuators
    are executed at CPS nodes. These are considered as atomic actions, such as closing
    a window, execute an irrigation mandate for a period of time or ventilating until
    a CO2 level is reached. Additionally, there are emergency reactive actions locally
    implemented in the CPS nodes that require real-time operation and can be launched
    without the human or edge plane supervision. An example of these are the opening
    of windows and turning on ventilation if the greenhouse inner temperature reaches
    a predefined threshold. The second processing and managing level of the layered
    architecture is the edge computing plane, which includes a set of NFV-powered
    control modules in charge of orchestrating the CPS layer. The subsystems of the
    edge layer make up the main operative control of the greenhouse and they are in
    charge of irrigation, climate, nutrition and auxiliary tasks, including alarms
    and energy management. At this layer, data fusion and aggregation is carried out
    to offload analytics functions usually performed in the cloud, given that the
    cloud part of the platform could serve a multitude of crops and users. The edge
    control modules are virtualised through NFV techniques that allow their instantiation
    at different levels in the network path, and they communicate with CPS nodes using
    IoT communication protocols such as MQTT or CoAP. MQTT is especially considered,
    given that it is more addressed to the management of industrial processes, however,
    CoAP is also supported for particular non-critical monitoring tasks not involving
    control. As depicted in Fig. 1, the data cloud serves as the interface between
    users and the core platform. Here is where the current status of the crop and
    configuration parameters are maintained. The NGSI interface is used to send data
    updates and receive notifications upon data changes. A change in configuration
    parameters triggers control actions that are managed by edge subsystems. Moreover,
    as can be seen in the diagram, special analytics coupled with concrete service
    needs are performed using the cloud as data source. For the communication between
    final applications and the analytics module, a REST interface transporting JSON
    data is used. 4. FIWARE-based cloud and edge solution Here we present the details
    of the cloud and edge planes of the instantiated architecture. We have used the
    FIWARE platform to provide the main software modules. In our particular case,
    the ORION Context Broker1 is chosen to provide access to the greenhouse status
    information stored in it, providing different methods to register/update, request
    and subscribe for certain data records; Comet2 is included to provide persistence
    to the data; and the IoT Device Management Generic Enabler (IDAS) is chosen to
    connect with IoT devices. This section discussed how FIWARE is used at edge and
    cloud layers of the architecture illustrated in Fig. 1. 4.1. Edge computing plane
    The edge computing plane can be deployed according to the features and requirements
    of the target PA scenario. This way, it is possible to move the edge computing
    plane next to the cloud or, by contrast, to instantiate this logic next to the
    local deployment. This can be done thanks to virtualisation. Control modules in
    the edge plane are developed as NFV nodes, which allows us to easily move the
    components according to the aforementioned requirements. For this reason, each
    control module provided by our solution is instantiated in a specific virtualised
    image that is launched opportunistically depending on the scenario requirement.
    Images are hosted by a Virtualized Infrastructure Manager (VIM) that allows remote
    management through a proper API. As depicted in Fig. 2, each control module comprises
    a Context Broker, two IoT Agents of the IDAS GE for CoAP and MQTT communications,
    and the Comet GE provides persistence to the data. Hence, each IoT Agent acts
    as intermediary between the information provided by the CPS layer and the Context
    Broker. Additionally, a specific software entity (Smart Module in the figure)
    is responsible for managing the tasks related to the specific control module.

    Fig. 2. Edge computing plane. Each NFV-based control module is instantiated as
    a compact FIWARE domain that interconnects the cloud and CPS planes, and performs
    smart control actions offloading the cloud and providing extra reliability. For
    the case of the MQTT support, the MQTT IoT Agent acts as broker to provide the
    meeting point of the publish/subscribe scheme to allow communications with CPSs.
    We have defined the next MQTT topics (the notation is simplified for the sake
    of clarity, but details can be found in the IoT Agent Step by Step guide3): •
    , , … : a specific topic is created for each of the CPSs instantiated in our platform,
    where the corresponding CPS is configured as publisher and the control modules
    at the edge plane are set as subscribers. • , , and : one topic is created for
    each control module virtualised in our architecture. This way, they can manage
    the CPSs involved in their activities by sending concrete instructions. Hence,
    each control module is configured as publisher for its corresponding topic, and
    the CPSs are configured as subscriber for each of them. By using a Context Broker
    per control module, we can perform edge computing tasks without accessing the
    cloud plane. In the concrete case illustrated in Fig. 2, for instance, the software
    unit in charge of irrigation intelligence is subscribed to the information of
    interest in the local Context Broker, being notified this way with changes received
    from the related CPS, including soil moisture and temperature, among others. In
    the same way, each of the decisions made by the smart module provokes changes
    in data records within the Context Broker, which in turn generates the publication
    of MQTT requests through the IoT Agent that finally reaches the related CPS. 4.2.
    Cloud plane Computer intensive tasks or those requiring a global view are undertaken
    at the elements deployed into the Cloud plane, which have been also virtualised
    in high-end servers. Figure 3 describe all the functionality provided by the cloud
    plane. Again, an instance of the Context Broker is used to maintain data records
    and handle NGSI interfaces. As a difference from the Context Broker instances
    included at the edge plane, the one included here maintains high-level data records
    about the status of the crop, including also filtered or preprocessed values coming
    from the edge level. An NGSI subscription is maintained by a Comet instance to
    save historical data, and another one is used to feed Big Data routines. Final
    management services interact with these two components in order to obtain all
    needed information to perform final decisions that are supervised by human operators.

    Fig. 3. Cloud computing plane. A virtual representation of the greenhouse state
    is maintained in a high-end FIWARE deployment, which is complemented with Big
    Data analytics to better support the human intervention. Data analytics are enabled
    by a distributed file-system that saves information among several machines. We
    have employed the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for this purpose. Another
    FIWARE enabler called Cygnus is in charge of taking data records from the Context
    Broker and saving them in Hadoop. Finally, our data analytics component will compute
    all the reasoning processes to assist decisions to be carried out by management
    services. 5. Prototype The target greenhouse of the system is the Experimental
    Greenhouse of CEBAS-CSIC illustrated in Fig. 4, a governmental research facility
    in Murcia, south-east of Spain, with geographical coordinates 38.1079837° N, −1.0355991°
    E and 120 m of elevation. It has a surface of 462.5 m2 (25 m × 18.5 m) and is
    between 5 and 7.5 m in height. Beside the greenhouse, we have built a room of
    60 m2 for the machinery and control systems. Download : Download high-res image
    (760KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. View of the interior of the
    greenhouse. The growing rows and the raffia thread to maintain the tomato plants
    are visible in the main view, while the humidifier module and climate sensors
    are shown in the small photo. Plants of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) are selected
    for the pilot system, one of the most economically important and extended crops
    in south Europe. Tomato is produced in 38% of the European greenhouse surface,
    so this prototype is potentially extensible to many other greenhouses. However,
    thanks to the flexibility of the solution proposed, it can be easily deployed
    for other crop species. Additionally, the software in charge of formulating the
    nutrient solutions, can be easily adapted to the nutritional needs of other crops.
    The tomatoes were transplanted in a soilless system in a first cycle on 17th October
    2016 and were harvested on 26th may 2017 (7 months). Plants were grown in 19 rows,
    54 plants per row, and they were guided with raffia thread to conduce the plant
    growth. A second cycle was carried out between 7th June 2017 and 30th November
    2017, but this time reducing the number of plants to 486. The plants were grown
    in the greenhouse under controlled conditions of temperature, humidity and irrigation.
    The maximum temperature was established to 27°C and the reference humidity was
    60%. The plants were daily irrigated with a nutrient solution containing , , ,
    , and micro-nutrients. Drainage volume, pH and electrical conductivity in the
    greenhouse is daily controlled too. The mineral composition (anions and cations)
    and microbiological control of the irrigation nutrient solution and drainage are
    analysed weekly, to ensure that the calibration of the software is correct. Since
    the idea is to design a system suitable for Mediterranean crops, the substrate
    used in the demonstration is coco peat, which is a challenging material regarding
    turbidity of the drainage and the microbial content. In the following subsections,
    we describe the main parts of the greenhouse facilities and the deployment of
    computing nodes to deal with edge and cloud planes of the architecture. 5.1. Greenhouse
    facilities The greenhouse has a set of equipment mainly deployed inside a machinery
    room beside the crop. These facilities are composed of several hardware units
    described in the following subsections, and all of them are managed by our three-tier
    control system, whose particular implementation is also detailed. 5.1.1. Nutrient
    solution unit The nutrient solution unit is where all nutrients needed for optimal
    plant growth are mixed, and it is controlled by a CPS and finally orchestrated
    by the edge computing nutrition control module. This unit consists of five fertilisers
    tanks and one acid tank used to adjust pH. All of them with a volume of 500 l.
    The unit provides the crops rhizosphere with the 12 essential elements to complete
    their life cycle: nitrogen, sulphur, phosphorus, calcium, potassium, iron, copper,
    manganese, boron, zinc, molybdenum. As detailed in Fig. 5, the content of these
    six tanks are mixed with the disinfected drainages, tap water and high quality
    water from the osmosis system, to prepare a nutrient solution in the nutritive
    solution tank of 3000 l. For this, we have installed magnetic pumps for each fertiliser,
    level sensors for the tanks, electrical valves, flow meters, and an electromechanical
    stirrer in the main tank. The nutrition control module (edge computing layer)
    controls the nutrient solution based on the electrical conductivity, pH and temperature
    measured on the impulsion pipe of the pump, which finally irrigates the crop,
    taking the nutrient solution from the tank. Download : Download high-res image

    and irrigation in the greenhouse. Low quantities of water and nutrients are needed
    thanks to a complete automated system that adapts nutrition according to a formula
    tuned at the cloud plane and executed by edge control modules. 5.1.2. Irrigation
    unit Three intermediate tanks are used to work with different nutrient solutions
    to make easier the experiments, as can be seen in Fig. 5. The solution to be used
    is pumped to irrigate the crop during 5 min and several times, with an estimated
    flow of 3000 . Irrigation and drainage flows are measured by flow meters that
    provide digital inputs to the CPS calibrated to . The whole process is controlled
    by the irrigation control module in the edge computing layer. Untreated drainage
    water is collected in a tank with a capacity of 1000 l, which is later pumped
    and pre-filtered to remove impurities of every nature and consistency. 5.1.3.
    Disinfection unit The filtered water is conducted through the disinfection unit
    (lower part of Fig. 5), which was initially based on ultraviolet treatment to
    reduce or eliminate microbial content, and thus reduce the appearance of diseases.
    Lately the system has been replaced by another unit based on a reactor of electrolysis,
    which has shown to be more effective, as the results presented in Section 6.2
    indicate. A precise dimensioning of the process using our system allows the totally
    effective treatment of illnesses that are transmitted by water pathogens. This
    unit is able to treat a maximum of 200 of drainage. The disinfected water is stored
    in a 5000 l tank with control level, where it is analysed. The electrical conductivity,
    pH and temperature are measured on the impulsion pipe of the pump, which sends
    back the water to the main nutritive solution tank. The whole process is controlled
    by a CPS, following the parameters indicated by the nutrition control module in
    the edge layer. 5.1.4. Purification unit The system has a purification unit with
    a reverse osmosis equipment that transforms tap water into low electrical conductivity
    water that can be mixed with drainages and tap water to prepare final nutrient
    solutions. The pilot has a purification unit able to generate 100 of low electric
    conductivity in a 5000 l tank, together with a flow meter, valves and pump needed
    to inject the water, which are connected with a CPS and controlled by the nutrition
    control module in the edge layer. 5.1.5. Climate unit The greenhouse has an IPv6
    over Low power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) deployment, where sensors
    are directly interconnected using Internet protocols, to measure the temperature,
    humidity, solar radiation and CO2. A CPS device is provided with peripherals dedicated
    to manage the different climatic devices. Although the platform is capable of
    managing up to thirteen climatic systems, the physical facilities of the prototype
    greenhouse has currently the following hardware: • Ventilation system with four
    overhead motorised windows. • Thermal-shade screen system on the roof, with an
    electro-mechanical traction system for opening and closing. It gets 48% of shadow
    and 55% of energy saving. • Air cooling system, which consists of a humidifier
    module and three helical extractors. The extractors have a flow of 38,000 . •
    Air fog system, used to humidify and cool the greenhouse through water evaporation.
    It has a pressure pump of 1 HP and 25 l, and an air compressor of 4 HP and 50
    l. • Heating system with a 100,000 kcal boiler, a stainless steel heat exchanger
    and 1 HP pumps for three distribution units. A broad range of sensors from the
    market were considered to fulfil the operation and environmental requirements
    of the platform. They were studied within the DrainUse project4 attending to the
    functionality provided and cost, and the finally selected ones are included in
    Table 1, indicating the model and main operation features. The operation of these
    sensors have been validated through the two cycles of tomato crop, presenting
    correct reads after the initial calibration procedure carried out in the CPS and
    6LoWPAN logger. Table 1. Sensors used in the prototype greenhouse, including relevant

    programmed and supervised by humans using the management services when required,
    with the intelligent support provided by data analytics. New high-level configuration
    parameters in the cloud Context Broker trigger notifications and changes in the
    Context Broker of edge control modules, which in turn are in charge of managing
    the operation of the individual greenhouse areas through mandating their corresponding
    CPSs. 5.2.1. CPS deployment Each control module in the edge computing plane has
    been initially assigned with a master CPS unit, resulting in a fully distributed
    system. The nutrition master CPS unit is in charge of controlling the nutrient
    solution, disinfection and purification hardware units, that is, the complete
    water cycle except for the irrigation action itself, which is carried out by a
    separate master CPS unit (and edge computing module). Unlike many commercial fertigation
    systems, we have decided to separate irrigation from nutrition control in order
    to have more flexibility to implement intelligent irrigation programs, apart from
    simply considering time and volume. Finally, the climate hardware unit is managed
    by the corresponding master CPS unit and control module. The three master CPS
    nodes (and edge control modules) are complemented by an auxiliary CPS and control
    module in charge of energy monitoring, alarms management and other auxiliary tasks
    as access control. Concrete implementations of emergency procedures in the auxiliary
    CPS include the described high temperature case, but also the lack of enough water
    flow from input pipes and additional support for energy cuts. In the first case,
    the human operator is warned of the water flow problem by the application described
    in Section 5.2.3, using the regular communication channel through the edge and
    cloud planes. However, to cover power cuts, the auxiliary CPS is equipped with
    a GSM modem and a backup battery to warn a human technician with an SMS message.
    The contact number can be configured in the user application described later.
    The master CPS consists of an IPex16 controller from Odin Solutions (OdinS), which
    is shown in Fig. 6, with a 32-bit CPU, 4 MB of memory expandable with microSD,
    Ethernet, USB, CAN, 3xRS232, 1xRS485 and 16 I/O ports, which can be configured
    by software as digital or analogue input/outputs. It supports 3G, 6LowPAN, Sigfox
    and LoRA. Each master CPS is able to manage eight additional slave I/O boards
    using CAN. The configuration of the controllers is done easily through its web
    server, and it permits us to configure atomic reactive (high priority) tasks independently
    from the MQTT commands received from the edge computing layer. In our case the
    communication of the CPSs with the network is through LAN. The communication among
    master and slave CPS nodes is done through CAN bus, allowing distances up to 1
    km. This permits to distribute CPSs along the facilities. Download : Download

    considered in the deployment. The IPex16 controller has been used due to their
    capabilities and flexible configuration. Both master and slave CPS nodes are installed
    in the separated electrical panels showed in Fig. 7. A fifth electrical panel
    contains the power meters of the installation. Figure 8 presents a diagram with
    the connection of different sensors with an IPex16-based CPS unit, indicating
    as well the MQTT protocol they use to communicate with the edge layer. As it depicts,
    both sensors and actuators use direct I/O lines for connection. Thus, by configuring
    analogue inputs, e.g., measurements such as temperature, humidity or pH can be
    transmitted from the sensor to the corresponding edge control module. Digital
    inputs are used for counters and, digital outputs are used to actuate over the
    elements of the greenhouse. Remote sensors that cannot be easily wired with the
    CPS are interconnected with 6LoWPAN. Download : Download high-res image (206KB)

    with sensors through the IPex16 CPS unit. The prototype system has 134 I/O wired
    signals distributed among all IPex16-based CPSs, and also some wireless signals
    using 6LowPAN. Most of the data collected come from wired digital outputs to solenoid
    valves, pumps, other motors (p.e. windows, screens systems) and analogue inputs
    from sensors (temperature, humidity, radiation, CO2, etc.). We also have a set
    of digital inputs from the different flow meters (liquids consumption). Sensors
    interconnected through 6LoWPAN are wired with Mex06 data loggers from OdinS, which
    are low-power devices especially prepared for remote control and monitoring. They
    include a 16-bit CPU, 4 MB of memory expandable with microSD, 1xRS232, 1xSDI-12
    and, what is of relevance, 1xRF 802.15.4 g over which 6LowPAN operates. Mex06
    loggers are especially designed for outdoor settings such as the agricultural
    scenarios, since it is provided with a water and dust-proof enclosure. It is prepared
    to be provided with a battery and a solar panel. The operation of these units
    have been validated connecting sensors deployed along the crop: temperature, humidity
    and solar radiation. Both IPex16 (CPS) and Mex06 (wireless data logger), have
    been adapted by OdinS within the DrainUse project. Hence, the firmware of theses
    units have been improved as a result of this research to serve as generic-purpose
    MQTT units for high-precision automation environments. 5.2.2. Deployment of computing
    nodes In the current deployment, edge control modules are virtualised in a local
    server installed at the crop premises, while the cloud plane is set-up in a high-end
    server at the Computer Science Faculty (University of Murcia). Within the machinery
    room (beside the greenhouse) we have installed a common computer with PC architecture.
    It is comprised by an Intel Core i5-7400 CPU (3.00 GHz and Quad Core architecture),
    16 GB of RAM and a hard disk of 1 TB. The computer runs Centos 7, and LibVirt/KVM
    is used to create four virtual machines, one per control module. Virtual machines
    are provided with 4 GB of RAM and 50 GB of hard disk capacity. This is enough
    to run the local Context Broker instances, which deals with only a part of the
    system, save data, and execute IoT agents. The cloud server is a PowerEdge R200,
    with an Intel Xeon x3360 (2.83 GHz and Quad Core architecture), 32 GB of RAM and
    two hard disks of 500 GB each. It also runs Centos 7 and LibVirt/KVM. A single
    virtual machine is used here for the global Context Broker, data saving, Big Data
    processes and to host management with web services. The virtual machine uses 16
    GB of memory and 200 GB of hard disk capacity. Good performances are obtained
    at the moment, but given the flexibility of our architecture, more resources could
    be added by modifying or moving virtual images. The Context Broker version used
    has been Orion 1.7.0, which is supported by Comet release 6. Exclusively for the
    cloud computing plane, it is also used Cygnus 1.0 and Hadoop 2.8. 5.2.3. User
    management service Regarding the management services identified in Fig. 3, we
    have developed a set of web services in HTML5 with a friendly graphical view to
    monitor and control the main functions of the system. Figure 9 includes a screen
    shot of the application area to manage climate. The view in the image includes
    tools to monitor the status of the climatic equipment of the greenhouse. Green-shaded
    parts indicate that these modules are active, such as the air-fog system, ventilation
    and cooling. Current values for temperature, humidity, radiation and air quality
    are also displayed. Usually all the greenhouse facilities are automatically managed
    by edge control modules according to general configuration parameters dictated
    at the cloud plane, by using this application. In this software it is possible
    to set the range of climatic parameters, or the base components of the nutrition
    solution, among others. Manual management of greenhouse facilities is also possible
    providing the required credentials. Download : Download high-res image (699KB)

    of individual automated modules at the greenhouse. 6. System operation This section
    describes the validation of the architecture and prototype from two different
    perspectives. First, an operation example with a real task is described attending
    to the three tiers of the architecture, with the aim of clarifying the function
    of each part of the system. Second, the platform is used in two cycles of a real
    crop and main results are analysed. 6.1. Reference operation example Given that
    the nutrition management is the most interesting operation from the PA point of
    view, here we include a complete description of the tasks carried out to actuate
    on the greenhouse and assure a proper irrigation with fertilisers. The explanation
    is split into the cloud, edge and CPS planes, following the sequence of tasks
    executed. 6.1.1. Cloud level In this layer, on the basis of a nutrient percentage
    table, the nutrition recipe (mixture) is calculated “theoretically” (there are
    no physical actions). To do this, a set of calculations assure that a final set
    of volumes of water sources and fertilisers comply with the plant needs. The steps
    are: 1. The first time the software presented in Section 5.2.3 is used, the following
    parameters must be defined: (a) Available fertilisers in the facilities. (b) Water
    components based on analysis carried out beforehand in laboratory of each external
    water source. 2. For a new nutrition mixture the next parameters are defined:
    (a) Volume of the mixture. (b) Nutrient percentage table with the cations–anions
    equilibrium concentration. (c) Selection of the fertiliser cubes and water sources
    from the list of available ones. (d) Target irrigation tank. (e) Desired pH and
    maximum electrical conductivity (ECmax). 3. Calculate the volume of different
    waters to be used so that ECmax is not exceeded, maximising the use of drainage
    water and reducing the cost of the mixture. 4. Compensate the excess of nutrients
    with a dilution recalculating the volumes of waters. The excess of nutrients are
    due to the already provided nutrients in the waters used. 5. Recalculate the mixture
    electrical conductivity considering the missing nutrients to be added. If ECmax
    is exceeded, a new dilution is needed in the previous step. 6 Add the missing
    nutrients As a result, the volumes of different water sources and fertilisers
    are sent to the edge level, together with the target pH and irrigation tank. 6.1.2.
    Edge level This layer is in charge of creating the mixture transmitted from the
    cloud level by orchestrating the greenhouse equipment (valves, pumps, sensor readings,
    etc). Hence, after receiving the different volumes it generates a complete set
    of operations to create the mixture. To do so, the next steps are followed: 1.
    Sequential discharge of waters in the nutritive solution tank. 2. Agitator activation.
    3. Sequential discharge of fertilisers in the nutritive solution tank. 4. Water
    recirculation through a pipe with sensors, to analyse the resulting mixture. 5.
    pH adjustment by discharges from the acid tank. 6. Pouring into the irrigation
    tank selected. 7. Cleaning the nutritive solution tank using purified water. After
    these steps have taken place, a set of atomic tasks are generated and transferred
    to the CPS level. For instance, for the first point, the sequential discharge
    of waters will be decomposed in atomic operations where a specific digital output
    is activated until the required volume is discharged. During all this process,
    the CPS will provide updated information by notifying its new status thanks to
    the MQTT protocol. Only after validating the received information, the next step
    will take place following the same procedure. Hence, each control module in the
    edge layer is responsible for orchestrating and managing the operations that are
    executed by the CPS level by sending atomic operations and by subscribing to the
    MQTT topics where the information coming from the CPS nodes will be published.
    6.1.3. CPS level This control layer executes the atomic tasks received from the
    edge layer. CPS nodes are in charge of executing sensor readings and control loops,
    sending these data to the edge layer by using the appropriate topics of the MQTT
    protocol. In this sense, no other complex logic is executed at this level, searching
    for the robustness in this part of the platform. Examples of task executed in
    CPSs are the next ones: • . Activate/deactivate a digital output, such as a valve,
    pump, etc. • . This is also an atomic task with a control loop, which can be used
    to activate a valve associated to a flow meter (irrigation by volume). • . Analogue
    sensor reading for a defined sample time. As previously indicated, the auxiliary
    CPS also includes emergency procedures to perform reactive local tasks without
    supervision. Some examples are: • Send SMS messages when a power cut is detected.
    The auxiliary CPS has a backup battery and a GSM modem to send these messages.
    • Send SMS messages when a lack of water supply from input pipes is detected.
    • Close the valves of water supply when the water consumption exceeds a threshold
    and send an SMS message. Probably the pipe circuit of the greenhouse is damaged.
    • Take reactive actions in case of adverse climatic conditions for the plants,
    such as opening windows or switching on ventilation. 6.2. System validation We
    have collected agronomic results of two cycles of the tomato crop. In the last
    cycle we decided to reduce the plan density to increase ventilation and lighting.
    The main figures of merit are included in Table 2, attending the production per
    m2, ha and the total production in kg. The revenue in market price is also included
    at the end. Table 2. Main numbers of the first and second cycle of the tomato
    crop managed by the PA system. Empty Cell First cycle Second cycle Period 17/10/2016–26/05/2017
    07/06/2017–30/11/2017 Number of plants 1026 486 Plants per m2 2.2 1.2 Plants per
    ha 21.829 10.340 Total production (kg) 3056 3596 Fruit per plant (kg) 3.0 7.4
    Fruit per ha (kg) 65.037 76.511 Revenue (€ ) 58.533 68.860 The results indicate
    that, although the number of plants is lower in the second cycle, the total production
    has been even better than in the first cycle. This fact is clearly visible in
    the amount of fruit per plant. This improvement has been possible thanks to the
    reduction of the plant density, as said above, but also because of the lack of
    diseases, since the new disinfection unit based on a reactor of electrolysis has
    been more effective. Data obtained with the closed-loop hydroponic system (real
    data) have been compared with the needs of a regular open-cycle crop (estimation).
    The main comparative indicators for the two cycles of the crop are included in
    Table 3, including real and estimated values. To obtain the estimated data of
    water consumed in open cycle, we have assumed that the total water spent on irrigation
    (195,647 l and 140,000 l) would come from tap water to prepare the nutrient solution.
    The estimation of these volumes assume that the percentage of drainage reused
    in the close water cycle is added as new water in this case. The nutrients used
    in the open cycle are estimated following the same approach, considering that
    the new water needs extra nutrients as compared with the water gathered from drainages
    in the close cycle. Table 3. Comparison between open water cycle (OC) and close
    water cycle (CC) in terms of water and macronutrient consumption in the two crop

    can be seen in the results included in Table 3, the closed cycle represents a
    significant economic saving in the volume of water for irrigation, since the greenhouse
    is reusing 39% and 28% of the total water needed in the first and second crop
    cycles, respectively. The closed cycle has also meant a significant saving in
    the amount of fertilisers used in the nutrient solution. The differences in water
    savings between crop cycles are due to the crop periods, since the second one
    was carried out during summer and the plants require more water. Nutrient consumption
    also vary due to this fact, but also because of a variation in the water used
    and a better adaptation of the nutrients to the plant in the second cycle. From
    the results it can be said that good production levels have been obtained, at
    the same time water and nutrient consumption maintain clearly below the needs
    of regular open crops. And this has been obtained even with the target of validating
    the PA operation, with no especial focus on maximising revenues. There are important
    lessons learned after these two crop cycles. Attending to the hardware deployment,
    it has been relevant how well flow meters measure water intakes and detect circuit
    anomalies due to obstructions. Regarding the overall architecture of the control
    system, it is important to indicate that our initial conception was a static solution
    based on a single CPS acting as master unit, with several slave boards. This approach
    is similar to commercial turnkey systems available in the market, where the whole
    management is centralised on a controller or computer. These greenhouse control
    systems tend to be robust and also allow Internet access, but we experienced the
    lack of modularity, delocalisation and, above all, the lack of the flexibility
    provided by virtualisation. Flexibility is, in fact, particularly relevant when
    inserting extra services or moving the control functions to an evolved hardware.
    For this reason, our three-tier control system aims at a modular turnkey system,
    reducing engineering time in setting-up and maintenance. 7. Conclusions The work
    presented in the paper describes the design, development and evaluation of a system
    that covers extreme PA requirements by using automation, IoT technologies, and
    edge and cloud computing through virtualisation. A multi-tier platform has been
    developed, based on: (1) a CPS local layer connected with greenhouse facilities;
    (2) a novel edge computing plane where to insert control modules in virtualised
    nodes near the access network; and (3) a cloud segment provided with higher computing
    and data analytics resources to support crop management decisions. Cloud and edge
    planes are powered by FIWARE, including the use of regulated data formats and
    network interfaces, and a proper connection with local and global data analytics
    modules has been developed. The edge plane is powered with NFV technology to increase
    flexibility in deploying control modules. When deployed under the access network,
    higher levels of system reliability are reached, since sporadic network cuts do
    not affect control decisions. The whole system has been implemented in a real
    greenhouse in the south-east of Spain, including details about the main functional
    units that are controlled by our PA management platform. Moreover, two cycles
    of tomato crop have been used to, first, validate of the good operation of the
    architecture and, second, analyse the improvements of our system as compared with
    a regular open crop. Savings of more than 30% in water consumption have been obtained,
    which is highly relevant in our semi-arid area, and up to 80% in some nutrients.
    As a relevant future result, we are currently porting the platform to a urban
    farming setting in frames of the HIDROLEAF project. In this environment we make
    use of intermodal containers to create portable crops. This implies extreme climatic
    environments that makes the most of our PA platform. Moreover, we expect to continue
    evaluating the system in future crop cycles to further improve operations and
    adapt our decision support capabilities finally offered as management services
    to human operators. Acknowledgements This work has been sponsored by the Spanish

    \ of Things (IoT)-based automation of agricultural events can change the agriculture\n\
    sector from being static and manual to dynamic and smart, leading to enhanced\
    \ production with\nreduced human efforts. Precision Agriculture (PA) along with\
    \ Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) are the\nmain drivers of automation in the agriculture\
    \ domain. PA uses speciﬁc sensors and software to ensure\nthat the crops receive\
    \ exactly what they need to optimize productivity and sustainability. PA includes\n\
    retrieving real data about the conditions of soil, crops and weather from the\
    \ sensors deployed in the\nﬁelds. High-resolution images of crops are obtained\
    \ from satellite or air-borne platforms (manned\nor unmanned), which are further\
    \ processed to extract information used to provide future decisions.\nIn this\
    \ paper, a review of near and remote sensor networks in the agriculture domain\
    \ is presented\nalong with several considerations and challenges. This survey\
    \ includes wireless communication\ntechnologies, sensors, and wireless nodes used\
    \ to assess the environmental behaviour, the platforms\nused to obtain spectral\
    \ images of crops, the common vegetation indices used to analyse spectral\nimages\
    \ and applications of WSN in agriculture. As a proof of concept, we present a\
    \ case study\nshowing how WSN-based PA system can be implemented. We propose an\
    \ IoT-based smart solution\nfor crop health monitoring, which is comprised of\
    \ two modules. The ﬁrst module is a wireless sensor\nnetwork-based system to monitor\
    \ real-time crop health status. The second module uses a low altitude\nremote\
    \ sensing platform to obtain multi-spectral imagery, which is further processed\
    \ to classify\nhealthy and unhealthy crops. We also highlight the results obtained\
    \ using a case study and list the\nchallenges and future directions based on our\
    \ work.\nKeywords: smart agriculture; precision agriculture; vegetation index;\

    \ increased food demands for human survival on\nthe Earth. Meeting the food requirements\
    \ with limited resources of the planet is a big challenge [1].\nSeveral state-of-the-art\
    \ technologies are being incorporated in the agriculture domain to enhance\nthe\
    \ productivity to cope with this challenge. Precision Agriculture (PA) is comprised\
    \ of near and\nremote sensing techniques using IoT sensors, which help to monitor\
    \ crop states at multiple growth\nlevels. PA involves the acquisition and processing\
    \ of a large amount of data related to crop health.\nMultiple parameters are involved\

    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n2 of 25\nmassive information\
    \ from different sources and different parts of the ﬁeld such as soil nutrients,\
    \ the\npresence of pests and weeds, chlorophyll content in plants and some weather\
    \ conditions. All collected\ninformation needs to be analysed to produce agronomic\
    \ recommendations. For instance, given the\ndevelopmental stage of plants, their\
    \ level of greenness (chlorophyll content) reveals the nutrients\nneeded. This\
    \ information is combined with the characteristics of the soil where the plant\
    \ is located\nalong with weather forecast. All collected information is further\
    \ used to determine how much of a\ncertain fertilizer should be applied to that\
    \ plant on the next day. The delivery of agronomic information\non the right time\
    \ to farmer and ensuring that he/she applies these recommendations are key to\n\
    enhancing the yields.\nThe foremost driver of PA is a WSN, which is a network\
    \ of multiple wireless nodes connected\ntogether to monitor the physical parameters\
    \ of environment. Each wireless node is comprised of a\nradio transceiver, a micro-controller,\
    \ sensor(s), an antenna, along with other circuitry that enables it\nto communicate\
    \ with some gateway to transmit information collected by the sensor(s) [2]. Sensors\n\
    measure the physical parameters and send the collected information to the controller,\
    \ which further\ntransmits this information to the cloud or a portable device.\
    \ The agriculture sector has multiple\nrequirements comprised of soil statistics,\
    \ crops’ nature, weather conditions, fertilizer types and water\nrequirements.\
    \ Crops have diverse requirements depending on different crops on the same land\
    \ and the\nsame plant on different lands with different weather conditions. Sensors\
    \ monitor the varying behaviour\nof these crop parameters. Due to rapid advancement\
    \ in WSN technologies, the size and the cost of\nsensors have reduced, which make\
    \ it feasible to implement them in many sectors of life including\nagriculture.\
    \ The most common sensors used in the agriculture domain that capture environmental\n\
    parameters related to crops [3] are listed in Table 1.\nIn general, a WSN consists\
    \ of one or more wireless nodes that are further connected with sensors.\nThese\
    \ nodes are tiny devices that are responsible for collecting data. Nodes are divided\
    \ into two types,\na source node that collects the data, and the other is sink\
    \ or gateway node, which receives data from the\nsource nodes. A sink node has\
    \ more computational power compared to a source node. However, there\nare energy,\
    \ memory, power, size, data rate and price constraints when choosing wireless\
    \ nodes. Table 2\nshows a comparison of wireless nodes along with their common\
    \ speciﬁcations [3]. Among all wireless\nnodes presented in Table 2, MICA2 is\
    \ considered to be more suitable as compared to others because of\nits large number\
    \ of expansion connectors, which makes it suitable to connect with several sensors.\n\
    Many applications using WSN have been proposed since the last decade to monitor\
    \ crops’ health\nremotely. In [4], a cyber-physical system was presented for monitoring\
    \ of a potato crop. Cyber physical\nsystems can be expressed as smart systems\
    \ that are comprised of software, hardware and physical\ncomponents, integrated\
    \ together to sense the varying states of the real world. The proposed system\n\
    consists of three layers: the ﬁrst layer is the physical layer, in which all sensory\
    \ data are collected;\nthe second layer is the network layer in which data are\
    \ transmitted to the cloud; the third layer is\nthe decision layer in which the\
    \ data are analysed and processed to make decisions according to the\nobservations.\n\
    There are several challenges in IoT-based systems due to exponential increasing\
    \ devices. As in\na typical IoT network, every node transmits data to the remote\
    \ cloud, which results in cloud\ncongestion, and the main challenges underlying\
    \ the IOT-based system are latency with minimum\npower requirements, better usage\
    \ of bandwidth and intermittent Internet connectivity. Fog computing\nand edge\
    \ computing are the state-of-the-art techniques to overcome these issues; which\
    \ reduce the\ncomputational burden of cloud. The main goal of fog computing is\
    \ to conserve energy and bandwidth,\nwhich helps to increase the quality of service\
    \ to the end users. In [5], an energy-efﬁcient architecture of\nthe Fog of Everything\
    \ was presented, which was comprised of six layers. The ﬁrst layer was an Internet\n\
    Of Everything (IOE) layer, where things (could be ﬁxed, mobile or nomadic) functioned\
    \ under multiple\nspatially-distributed clusters. The second was a wireless access\
    \ network that supported Thing to Fog\n(T2F) and Fog to Thing (F2T) communication\
    \ over the wireless channel. In the third layer, the connected\nfog nodes behaved\
    \ such as a virtualized cluster. There was an inter-fog backbone in the fourth\
    \ layer,\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n3 of 25\nwhich was responsible for connectivity\
    \ among fog nodes. The next layer was the virtualization layer,\nwhich provided\
    \ each connected thing with the ability to augment its limited resource set, exploiting\n\
    the computation capability at the virtual clone. In the last layer, there was\
    \ an overlay inter-clone\nvirtual network that empowered Peer to Peer (P2P) communication.\
    \ Then, a protocol stack for FOE\nwas presented, which was further tested by creating\
    \ a small prototype named as V-FOE and simulated\non the iFogsim toolkit. The\
    \ results provided strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed\nframework\
    \ and more energy efﬁciency with reduced failure rate and delay.\nTable 1. Wireless\

    The energy efﬁciency is the most serious consideration while developing any fog\
    \ architecture.\nIn [6], an energy-efﬁcient protocol for a fog-supported wireless\
    \ sensor network was presented, which\nmaximized the lifetime of the network by\
    \ uniformly distributing the energy among connected nodes.\nThe performance of\
    \ the proposed algorithm was compared with the existing state-of-the-art algorithms\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 3796\n4 of 25\nin MATLAB. The results showed that the proposed\
    \ algorithm was highly energy efﬁcient with a\nprolonged network lifetime.\nRegardless\
    \ of all the advancements in the IoT domain, the adoption of PA has been limited\
    \ to\nsome developed countries. Because of the lack of resources, remote sensing-based\
    \ techniques to\nmonitor crop health are not common in under-developed countries\
    \ such as Pakistan, which results in\na loss of yield. Pakistan is an agricultural\
    \ country due to is large arable land and climatic variations,\nwhich make it\
    \ suitable to cultivate multiple types of crops. Despite all these natural resources,\
    \ Pakistan\nis still unable to produce massive yields [7]. The main reason behind\
    \ the low production is traditional\nfarming practices, which are used for crop\
    \ health monitoring and yield estimation. These techniques\nare completely based\
    \ on farmer’s intuition and experience. Farmers visit the ﬁelds in order to monitor\n\
    the crop, which is very laborious and quite challenging in the case of large arable\
    \ land. In this case, the\narea under insect/pest attack is inaccurately measured,\
    \ which can result in over spraying of insecticide\nand pesticide, which adversely\
    \ affects the nutrition in crops.\nKeeping in mind all these issues, our motivation\
    \ is to provide the industry and research\ncommunities with a survey of technologies,\
    \ metrics and current practices concerning communication\ndevices, sensors and\
    \ platforms used to monitor and analyse multiple sources of data (spectral images,\n\
    IoT, etc.) used in environmental and agriculture applications. As the main contribution,\
    \ we generated\na technological taxonomy for PA, which was driven by an IoT-based\
    \ architecture to monitor the crops’\nhealth. The developed system had two modules\
    \ including wireless sensor network-based crop heath\nmonitoring in which multiple\
    \ sensors were used to get the real-time heath status of crop; the other\none\
    \ was NDVI-based analysis of spectra images captured by a drone to assess the\
    \ chlorophyll content,\nwhich was further used to monitor the health of the crop.\n\

    \ wireless\ncommunication technologies used in the agriculture domain; Section\
    \ 3 explains the spectral\nimage-based remote sensing techniques, platforms and\

    \ protocols have been introduced in the last few decades due to the rapid\nincrease\
    \ in IoT devices and WSN technologies. Each protocol has its own speciﬁcations\
    \ depending on\nthe bandwidth, number of free channels, data rate, battery timing,\
    \ price and other factors [8]. The most\ncommonly-used protocols for wireless\
    \ communication in IoT-based applications in agriculture are:\nSensors 2019, 19,\
    \ 3796\n5 of 25\n2.1. Cellular\nCellular technology is most suitable for applications\
    \ that require an extraordinary data rate.\nIt can utilize GSM, 3G and 4G cellular\
    \ communication capabilities by providing reliable high-speed\nconnectivity to\
    \ the Internet, requiring higher power consumption.\nIt requires infrastructure\
    \ to\nbe deployed and operation cost and back up staff for it with a centralized\
    \ managed authority.\n4G cellular technology requires more battery power, but\
    \ cellular technology is a good option in\nunderground wireless sensor networks,\
    \ such as security systems in smart home projects and agriculture\napplications\
    \ [9]. A smart irrigation systems was presented in [10], in which several soil\
    \ moisture\nsensors were deployed in the ﬁeld in the ZigBee mesh network. The\
    \ reading captured from the ﬁelds\nwere transmitted over the cloud using the cellular\
    \ 4G LTE network.\n2.2. 6LoWPAN\n6LoWPAN is an IP-based communication protocol,\
    \ which was the ﬁrst protocol used for IoT\ncommunication. 6LoWPAN is also low\
    \ cost because of the low bandwidth and low power consumption.\n6LoWPAN supports\
    \ multiple topologies such as star and mesh topologies. To handle interoperability\n\
    between IPv6 and IEEE 802.15.4, there is an adaptation layer between the network\
    \ layer and the\nMAC layer [8]. The applications for 6LoWPAN are monitoring the\
    \ health equipment, environment\nmonitoring and in security and home automation\
    \ systems. In [11], a 6LoWPAN-enabled wireless sensor\nnetwork was presented to\
    \ monitor the soil properties of crops. The 6LoWPAN system architecture\nfor precision\
    \ agriculture application was discussed in [12] where the performance evaluation\
    \ of this\nprotocol was discussed with several baud rates and power constraints.\n\
    2.3. ZigBee\nZigBee is a wireless communication protocol widely used in precision\
    \ agriculture to monitor\nenvironmental conditions related to crops’ health [13].\
    \ It is based on the wireless 802.15.4 standard.\nBasically, it was developed\
    \ for personal area networks by the ZigBee alliance [8]. It has a ﬂexible\nnetwork\
    \ structure, long battery life, supports mesh, star and tree topology with multi-hop\
    \ data\ntransmission, is easily installed and supports large nodes. It has a short\
    \ range with limited data speed\nand is less secure compared to Wi-Fi-based systems.\
    \ ZigBee is very common in smart agriculture\napplications such as smart green\
    \ houses and smart irrigation systems [14]. In [15], a smart irrigation\nsystem\
    \ was presented based on the ZigBee communication protocol. This system consisted\
    \ of two\nnodes, i.e., a sensor node and an actuator node. The sensor node was\
    \ comprised of soil moisture\nsensors, which monitored the water level in the\
    \ soil. The actuator module was responsible for taking\nactions according to the\
    \ water level of the soil. All communication was carried out by means of\nZigBee\
    \ protocol.\n2.4. BLE\nBLE is as famous as the Bluetooth smart technology, which\
    \ is a suitable protocol for IoT\napplications including agriculture [16]. It\
    \ is particularly designed for low bandwidth, low latency and\nshort range for\
    \ IoT applications. The main advantages of BLE over typical Bluetooth include\
    \ lower\nsetup time, lower power consumption and unlimited support for nodes in\
    \ a star topology. It has a\nvery limited range of 10 meters. However, the drawbacks\
    \ are that it can only provide communication\nbetween two devices, it presents\
    \ low security, and it can lose connection during communication. In [17],\na BLE-based\
    \ infrastructure was presented to collect the sensors’ data. The proposed system\
    \ utilized a\nsmart phone to collect the data of sensors using BLE, where sensors\
    \ were deployed in the plants, i.e.,\nsoil moisture sensors and soil temperature\
    \ sensor.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n6 of 25\n2.5. RFID\nRFID systems consist of\
    \ a reader and a transponder, which have a very small radio frequency,\ncalled\
    \ the RF tag. This tag is programmed electronically with distinctive information\
    \ that has a reading\ncharacteristic. RFID has two technologies for the tag system\
    \ the ﬁrst is the active reader tag system,\nand the other is the passive reader\
    \ tag. Active reader tag systems are more expensive, as they utilize\nmore battery\
    \ power and use high frequencies. However, passive reader tag systems are low\
    \ powered.\nSome IoT applications using RFID include smart shopping, healthcare,\
    \ national security and smart\nagriculture applications. An IoT-based smart irrigation\
    \ system based on RFID was presented in [18].\nThe system was comprised of soil\
    \ moisture and soil temperature sensors along with a water control\nsystem, so\
    \ it collected the reading of the sensors and sent these readings to the cloud\
    \ using RFID\ncommunication protocols, where the user controlled a water pump\
    \ based on the water level of the soil.\n2.6. Wi-Fi\nWi-Fi is the most common\
    \ communication protocol that enables devices to communicate over\na wireless\
    \ signal. Wi-Fi provides Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) connectivity to millions\
    \ of\nlocations, i.e., homes, ofﬁces and public locations such as cafes, hotels\
    \ and airports with high speed.\nThe Wi-Fi protocol supports IEEE 802.11, 802.11a,\
    \ 802.11b, 802.11g and 802.11n. Wi-Fi is widely used\nin IoT-based applications\
    \ including agriculture systems, i.e., smart irrigation, crop health monitoring\n\
    and greenhouses. In [19], an infrastructure was presented to monitor environmental\
    \ parameters\ninside the greenhouse such as temperature, light intensity and soil\
    \ moisture level. This platform\nwas comprised of sensors that collected the data\
    \ related to the environmental variation and sent to\nthe cloud using Wi-Fi. Similarly,\
    \ another smart agriculture system based on Wi-Fi communication\nprotocols was\
    \ presented in [20]. This last one consisted of a Raspberry Pi connected with\
    \ multiple\nsensors, which collected the data. The collected data were further\
    \ transmitted to the cloud using Wi-Fi\ncommunication protocols.\n2.7. LoRaWAN\n\
    LoRaWAN operates on the LoRa network. LoRaWAN deﬁnes the system architecture and\n\
    communication protocol of the network, while the physical layer of LoRa enables\
    \ the link for\nlong-range communication. LoRaWAN manages the frequencies in communication,\
    \ data rate and\npower consumption for all devices. LoRaWAN is common in agricultural\
    \ applications because of\nits large coverage area and low power consumption [21].\
    \ In [14], a smart irrigation system based on\nLoRaWAN was presented. Table 3\
    \ shows the comparison of all mentioned wireless communication\nprotocols [8].\
    \ Among all wireless communication technologies, 6LoWPAN and ZigBee are considered\n\
    to be more suitable for PA application because both are based on mesh networking,\
    \ which makes them\nsuitable to cover large area.\nTable 3. Wireless communication\

    \ Image-Based Remote Sensing\nRemote sensing has been widely used in PA to monitor\
    \ crops’ health for the last two decades.\nRemote sensing is a phenomenon in which\
    \ physical conditions of the Earth are observed remotely by\ncalculating the emitted\
    \ and reﬂected radiation from some distance. There are special cameras that\n\
    are used to capture images for further analysis to ﬁnd the characteristics of\
    \ a speciﬁc area. Multiple\nplatforms are used to mount these cameras that capture\
    \ images of the objects.\n3.1. Spectral Image Platforms\nRemote sensing platform\
    \ considerations for spectral images are airborne-based, satellite-based\nand\
    \ Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based [22]. Each platform has its own coverage\
    \ range, which\nis determined by three factors: (i) Ground Sampling Distance (GSD),\
    \ which is computed in terms of\nspatial resolution, (ii) data collection rate\
    \ or frequency and (iii) average distance between the object\nand sensor. Apart\
    \ from coverage range, several factors [23] affect the performance of platforms,\n\
    as mentioned in Table 4.\nTable 4. Key differences between spectral image platforms.\n\

    \ are considered to be the most stable platforms among\nall others. These platforms\
    \ consist of satellites, rockets and space shuttles. Space borne platforms are\n\
    categorized based on the orbits and timing. The advantages of satellite-based\
    \ remote sensing include\nhigh spatial resolution, which makes it promising to\
    \ extract extensive time-series data. The images\nobtained by satellite platforms\
    \ cover large area and are stable without noise, which is normally induced\ndue\
    \ to interference while image capturing. However, the main problem with satellite-based\
    \ platforms\nis their high cost in the case of high spatial resolution images.\
    \ The second problem is their strictly ﬁxed\ntime schedule, so data cannot be\
    \ collected at critical timings. The re-visitation times vary from twice\nin one\
    \ day to 16 days, depending on the orbit of the satellite. The other big problem\
    \ is that satellite\nplatforms are highly sensitive to weather conditions, so\
    \ if the weather is cloudy, the captured image will\nhave less detailed information.\
    \ Table 5 shows the main types of satellites with their speciﬁcations [22].\n\
    Among all satellite platforms presented in Table 5, some satellite data are freely\
    \ available,\nwhile others provide a commercial solution. The commercial solutions\
    \ such as Pleiades-1 provide\nimages with a high resolution and a revisit time\
    \ of one day. QuickBird, Landsat-8 and Sentinel are\nfrequently-used satellite\
    \ platforms used to obtain hyperspectral imagery. QuickBird was launched\nin 2001\
    \ by USA. The Panchromatic (PAN) and four Multi-Spectral (MS) imagery sensors\
    \ are used in\nQuickBird with a GSD of 0.7 × 0.7–2.6 × 2.6 m with a revisit time\
    \ 1–3.5 days. QuickBird provides a\nsmall revisit time, but it is a commercial\
    \ solution. In contrast to QuickBird, Landsat-8 and Sentinel\nprovide free solutions.\
    \ Landsat-8 was launched in 2013 by the USA. Landsat-8 provides a GSD of\n16 days\
    \ with PAN and 11-MS imagery sensors. Though revisit time of Landsat-8 is much\
    \ higher\ncompared to QuickBird, but it provides images with 11 different multi-spectral\
    \ bands.\nSentinel is another broadly-used satellite launched by the EU. It currently\
    \ has three missions,\ni.e., Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3. These missions\
    \ provide images with 21 MS bands with\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n8 of 25\nrevisit\
    \ times of 5–10 days depending on which Sentinel mission is used. However, Sentinel-2\
    \ is a\ncommonly-used platform in precision agriculture as it provides data freely\
    \ at a 10-m spatial resolution\nand covers a swath width of 290 km. By combining\
    \ Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B, the revisit time is\nfurther reduced to ﬁve days,\
    \ which helps in change detection. The complete details of all satellite\nplatforms\
    \ with their speciﬁcations are listed in Table 5, where other platforms such as\
    \ SAT, MODIS\nand WordView are also considered.\nTable 5. Satellite platforms\

    \ a vibrant alternative to satellite and airborne, which are quite ﬂexible and\
    \ cost\neffective. A typical UAV platform consists of a communication and navigation\
    \ system that incorporates\na set of sensors mounted on it. Among UAV platforms,\
    \ there are mainly ﬁxed-wing platforms. and\nmultirotor options are available.\
    \ The ﬂying time is based on the payload weight. In general, a longer\nﬂying time\
    \ is achieved by ﬁxed-wing systems, which demands lighter weight payloads. For\
    \ example,\nhigh-deﬁnition cameras weighing less than 300 grams as the payload\
    \ of a ﬁxed-wing UAV allow it to ﬂy\nfor around two hours using currently available\
    \ battery power [24]. On the contrary, battery-powered\nmultirotor UAV with higher\
    \ payload capacity have a reduced ﬂying time, i.e., around 15–25 min.\nTable 7\
    \ shows UAV platforms commonly used in the agriculture domain and concretely to\
    \ monitor\nthe health of crops remotely [22]. Among these platforms, DJI/Phantom-2\
    \ is a more suitable choice\nfor intermediate agricultural land because of its\
    \ low cost and ease of use. The other advantage of this\nplatform is that it provides\
    \ support for mounting multiple cameras, which helps to monitor the crop in\n\
    multiple electro-magnetic bands. The American Aerospace/RS-16 is also an option\
    \ because of its ﬂight\ntime and large are coverage, but due to its high cost,\
    \ this platform is not common.\nIn [25], the ESAFLY A2500_WH helicopter was used\
    \ to implement the platform of the UAV\nwith Tetra cam ADC Micro as the camera\
    \ to capture hyper-spectral images of two different types of\ncultivation, i.e.,\
    \ vineyard and tomato. The images captured by the UAV platform are very high in\n\
    resolution, so more information can be extracted as compared to satellite images.\
    \ To assess the health\nof a crop, three types of Vegetation Index (VI) maps have\
    \ been computed.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n10 of 25\nTable 7. UAV platforms for\

    Camera\n3.2. Vegetation Indices\nUsing multi-spectral images from the remote sensors\
    \ described above, a series of Vegetation\nIndices (VIs) can be computed. Vegetation\
    \ Indices (VIs) obtained from remote sensing-based canopies\nare effective algorithms\
    \ for quantitative and qualitative evaluations of vigour, vegetation cover and\n\
    growth dynamics, among other applications [26]. Hitherto, no uniﬁed mathematical\
    \ expression exists\nthat deﬁnes all VIs due to the complexity of the several\
    \ light spectra combinations, instrumentation,\nresolutions and platforms used.\
    \ In particular, this section focuses on vegetation indices NDVI, GDVI\nand SAVI,\
    \ as they are widely used in PA.\n3.2.1. NDVI\nThe Normalized Difference Vegetation\
    \ Index (NDVI) is the most popular VI that is extensively\nused to ﬁnd the content\
    \ of green in PA applications [27,28]. It uses Red (R) and Near Infrared (NIR)\n\
    channels to compute the NDVI index. More NIR light is absorbed by healthy vegetation;\
    \ however,\nabsorption ratio is very small for red light. NDVI is computed by\
    \ Equation (1) and returns a value\nbetween −1 and 1 [29].\nNDVI = NIR − R\nNIR\
    \ + R\n(1)\nHigher NDVI value indicate healthy vegetation, while smaller values\
    \ of NDVI show that vegetation is\nvery small at that speciﬁc region. There is\
    \ another form of NDVI, i.e., the Green Normalized Vegetation\nIndex (GNDVI),\
    \ which uses the green channel instead of red. GNDVI is computed by Equation (2):\n\
    GNDVI = NIR − G\nNIR + G\n(2)\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n11 of 25\n3.2.2. Difference\
    \ Vegetation Index\nThe DVI was proposed to reduce the effect of soil reﬂectance,\
    \ which is not covered by NDVI [30].\nDVI is different between the reﬂectance\
    \ of the NIR band to the reﬂectance of the red band. DVI is also\ncomputed with\
    \ the green band, i.e., GDVI. Both DVI and GDVI are computed by Equations (3)\
    \ and (4):\nDVI = NIR − R\n(3)\nGDVI = NIR − G\n(4)\n3.2.3. SAVI\nNDVI and DVI\
    \ do not compensate the background effect of soil. Therefore, many vegetation\n\
    indices were introduced to compensate the effect of soil reﬂectance. The Soil\
    \ Adjusted Vegetation Index\n(SAVI), the Green Soil Adjusted vegetation Index\
    \ (GSAVI), the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation\nIndex (OSAVI), the Green Optimized\
    \ Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OGSAVI) and the Modiﬁed\nSoil Adjusted Vegetation\
    \ Index (MSAVI) [31–33] are common among them, which are computed by\nEquations\
    \ (5)–(9):\nSAVI =\n1.5(NIR − R)\n(NIR + R + 0.5)\n(5)\nGSAVI = 1.5(NIR − G)\n\
    NIR + G + 0.5\n(6)\nOSAVI =\n(NIR − G)\nNIR + R + 0.16\n(7)\nGOSAVI =\n(NIR −\
    \ G)\nNIR + G + 0.16\n(8)\nMSAVI = 0.5[2(NIR + 1) −\nq\n(2NIR + 1)2 − 8(NIR −\
    \ R)]\n(9)\n3.2.4. NR and NG:\nNormalized Red (NR) and Normalized Green (NG) are\
    \ two other famous vegetation indices being\nused in PA [33]. NR focuses on the\
    \ part of spectrum where radiation is absorbed by chlorophyll, while\nNG focuses\
    \ on the part of the spectrum where radiation is absorbed by other pigments, excluding\n\
    chlorophyll. NR and NG are computed by Equations (10) and (11):\nNR =\nR\nNIR\
    \ + R + G\n(10)\nNG =\nG\nNIR + R + G\n(11)\n4. Wireless Sensor Network Applications\
    \ in Agriculture\nMultiple applications of wireless sensor networks are being\
    \ utilized today in the agriculture sector.\nSome very common applications are\
    \ smart irrigation, smart fertilization, smart pest control and green\nhouse monitoring.\n\
    4.1. Smart Irrigation Systems\nSmart irrigation is an artiﬁcial irrigation application\
    \ that controls the quantity of water by making\na decision about where water\
    \ is needed. It is the most signiﬁcant constituent in agriculture, which has\n\
    a great impact on crops’ health, cost and productivity. One major aspect of smart\
    \ irrigation is to avoid\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n12 of 25\nthe wastage of water\
    \ since most countries in the world are facing water scarcity problems. A smart\n\
    irrigation system was presented in [34] in which a Raspberry Pi was used along\
    \ with two sensors:\na soil moisture sensor was used to assess the water level\
    \ in the soil, while a temperature and humidity\nsensor was used to monitor the\
    \ environmental condition. The Raspberry Pi was connected to these\nsensors and\
    \ the water supply network. A mobile application was developed for remote monitoring\n\
    and remote water ﬂow control enabling both manual and automatic water ﬂow control.\
    \ In automatic\nmode, water ﬂow was automatically turned ON/OFF based on the water\
    \ level of the soil without\nhuman intervention. In manual mode, the user was\
    \ able to monitor the soil moisture level. An alert\nwas generated when the water\
    \ level of soil was getting below a speciﬁc threshold, and the user turned\nit\
    \ ON/OFF using a mobile application.\nPower is a big concern in IoT-based platforms,\
    \ so many researchers have developed power-\nefﬁcient systems. A power-efﬁcient\
    \ water irrigation system was presented using solar power [35]\nin which the controller\
    \ was connected to the soil sensor and water supply valve. The water valve\nwas\
    \ turned ON/OFF based on the water level monitored by the moisture sensor. The\
    \ power was\nsupplied by the solar panel, so the system was independent of any\
    \ external power module. Another\nsensor-based IoT system for water irrigation\
    \ was presented in [36] in which the controller controlled\nthe opening and closing\
    \ of a solenoid valve based on the water level of the soil. In addition, a series\
    \ of\nweather alerts were sent to the user via a mobile application to update\
    \ the temperature and humidity of\nthe environment, which had a direct inﬂuence\
    \ on the water level of the soil. In [37], an energy-efﬁcient\nirrigation system\
    \ for cultivated crops was presented using a wireless sensor network in which\
    \ water\nwas effectively controlled based on environmental conditions. This system\
    \ estimated the quantity of\nwater needed for normal irrigation based on the humidity,\
    \ temperature and wind speed collected by\nsensors along with historical data.\n\
    In [38], an IoT-based irrigation system was presented using soil moisture sensors\
    \ controlled by\nATMEGA 328P on an Arduino UNO board along with a GPRS module.\
    \ The data collected from the\nsensors were sent to the cloud, i.e., Things Speak,\
    \ where graphs were generated to visualize the data\ntrends. A web portal was\
    \ also designed where the farmer was able to check the status of water, if it\n\
    was ON/OFF. Similarly, a real-time prototype for an irrigation system was presented\
    \ in [39] in which\nsoil moisture sensors and soil temperature sensors were used\
    \ to assess the water status of the soil.\nRFID was used to transmit data to the\
    \ cloud for further data analysis. Using ATMEGA 328, a water\nsprinkler system\
    \ for smart irrigation was presented in [40] using temperature, humidity and soil\n\
    moisture sensors. The water sprinkler was controlled based on the soil moisture\
    \ level to save water\nand reduce human effort. In [41], a cost-effective drip\
    \ irrigation system for a home was proposed in\nwhich a Raspberry Pi, Arduino,\
    \ electronic water control valve and relay were used. ZigBee protocols\nwere used\
    \ for communication. The user turned ON/OFF the water valve by sending commands\
    \ to the\nRaspberry Pi, which further processed the commands through the Arduino.\n\
    The sensors placement is a big issue that affects the accuracy of sensors. A detailed\
    \ discussion of\nsoil moisture positioning in the ﬁeld and their accuracy was\
    \ presented in [42]. For real-time irrigation\nsystems, complete software and\
    \ hardware requirements, problems and challenges and advantages\nwere discussed\
    \ in [43] where a big picture of the complete system was provided.\n4.2. Smart\
    \ Fertilization System\nFertilizer is an artiﬁcial or natural substance having\
    \ some chemical elements used to enhance\nthe growth and productivity of plants.\
    \ Manual spraying is a common technique used for fertilization.\nHowever, the\
    \ optimal way of fertilization requires sensing capabilities to ﬁnd the exact\
    \ place where\nfertilizer is needed, which chemical components are missing and\
    \ the amount of fertilizer needed.\nIt is important to provide fertilizers in\
    \ a very precise amount in order to improve productivity [44].\nMultiple fertilization\
    \ techniques have been presented by researchers since the last decade using WSN\n\
    and IoT.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n13 of 25\nAn automated fertilization system\
    \ was presented in [45] using real-time sensors to measure the\nsoil fertility.\
    \ The system consisted of three modules including input, output and decision support.\n\
    The decision support module measured the optimal amount of fertilizers needed\
    \ for the growth of the\nplants based on the real-time sensory data captured by\
    \ the sensors. A mechanical sensor named the\n“Pendulum Meter” was introduced\
    \ in [46], which was used for optimal fertilization. This sensor was\nmounted\
    \ on the tractor to measure the density of the crop, so the corresponding fertilizer\
    \ spreader\nwas controlled based on the readings of this sensor. The IEEE 802.11\
    \ Wi-Fi module was used for\ncommunication along with GPS. Real-time data of soil\
    \ were collected by several sensors, i.e., soil\nmoisture, temperature, conductivity,\
    \ NO2, CO2, etc. A Geographical Information System (GIS) server\nwas used to interpolate\
    \ sensory data.\n4.3. Smart Pest Control and Early Disease Detection System\n\
    Pest attacks are the root cause of low productivity in the agriculture sector.\
    \ These pests result in\nseveral serious diseases in plants that affect the plant’s\
    \ growth. However, disease prediction provides\nearly warning to the farmers,\
    \ which enables them to make appropriate decisions to control the disease\non\
    \ time. Pest control systems are comprised of electronic devices that enable humans\
    \ to identify traps\nin a speciﬁc range of these electronic devices [47]. These\
    \ electronic devices are sensors capable of\ncalculating the environmental parameters\
    \ for further analysis.\nMuch research has been done in the agriculture sector\
    \ for early disease detection and pest control\nsystems using more advanced and\
    \ sophisticated technologies [48,49]. Multiple imagery sensors have\nbeen used\
    \ by different researchers to collect imagery data, such as: RGB sensors, ﬂuorescence\
    \ imagery\nsensors, spectral sensors and thermal sensors [50]. The thermal sensors\
    \ are used to measure the water\nstatus in the plant by measuring the temperature,\
    \ since this parameter has a direct inﬂuence on the\nwater level in the plants.\
    \ RGB images have three colour channels, i.e., red, green and blue, which\ncan\
    \ be used to perceive the biometric effect in the plants. Multi- and hyper-spectral\
    \ sensors capture\nimages containing the spatial information of objects in multiple\
    \ wavebands. The spatial resolution is\ndependent on the distance between the\
    \ object and the sensor. That is why satellite images contain less\nspatial resolution\
    \ as compared to low altitude platforms such as drones. The ﬂuorescence sensors\
    \ are\nused to distinguish the photosynthetic activities in the plants. Various\
    \ image processing techniques\nare applied to these imagery data to identify the\
    \ diseases in plants.\nIn [50], an IoT-based plants disease and pest prediction\
    \ system was presented to minimize the\nexcessive use of fungicides and insecticides.\
    \ Weather condition monitoring sensors, i.e., temperature,\ndew, humidity and\
    \ wind speed, are used to monitor weather parameters to ﬁnd a correlation between\n\
    pest growth with weather. The sensors have been deployed in orchards, and data\
    \ collected from these\nsensors are sent to the cloud. The farmer is informed\
    \ about the alarming condition of the pest attack\non the crops.\nFrom a different\
    \ point of view, hyper-spectral images are used to analyse crops’ health and pest\n\
    attack using manned or unmanned vehicles on which spectral cameras are mounted.\
    \ The captured\nimages are analysed in depth using machine learning techniques\
    \ to identify the disease in the plants.\nAdvance Neural Networks (ANNs) are more\
    \ common for processing imagery data due to their ability\nto learn complex structures\
    \ and patterns. Using hyper-spectral images, a system was presented [51] to\n\
    identify disease or pest attack in crops. The proposed system for disease detection\
    \ used an ANN with\nmultiple layers.\nEarly disease detection in sugar beet plants\
    \ was presented in [52]. For early detection, four\nsupervised classiﬁcation algorithms\
    \ were applied on spectral images. Spectral images were then\ncollected for each\
    \ image, and multiple vegetation indices were calculated to be used in predictive\n\
    and perspective analysis. The vegetation indices used were NVDI, SR, SIPI, PSSRaand\
    \ PSSRb, ARI,\nREP, mCAIand RRE. These vegetation indices values were used as\
    \ features in the dataset. Support\nVector Machine (SVM), ANN, and decision tree\
    \ were used for classiﬁcation. A comparative analysis\nwas performed which, showed\
    \ that SVM outperformed other classiﬁers for disease detection with an\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 3796\n14 of 25\naccuracy of 97.12%. In [53], a data mining technique\
    \ was applied on the already collected dataset of\ntwo types of crops, i.e., wheat\
    \ and paddy (rice), in India. For dimension reduction, Sammon’s mapping\nwas used\
    \ for multi-dimension scaling, i.e., to reduce the dimension also for unsupervised\
    \ learning.\nFor high dimensional data, dimension reduction is required prior\
    \ to performing further data analysis\nfor better data visualization and accuracy,\
    \ since redundant dimensions reduce the effectiveness of\nany data analysis algorithms.\
    \ Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is a very often-used technique\nalong with\
    \ Sammon’s mapping. Data from multi-dimensions were reduced to two or three dimensions.\n\
    Then, the Self-Organized Maps (SOM) algorithm for clustering was used to ﬁnd correlations\
    \ between\nthe data. The accuracy comparison of SOM and Sammon’s mapping was presented,\
    \ which showed\nthat SOM performed better on a large dataset, while Sammon’s mapping\
    \ was suitable for small ones.\nSmart phones played important role in data acquisition,\
    \ which were further used to monitor the crops’\nhealth. In [54], the health of\
    \ wheat crop was monitored using near surface imagery captured by a smart\nphone.\
    \ The crop was classiﬁed as healthy or unhealthy based on the green level by computing\
    \ Gcc.\nMost of the applications in PA have been either IoT-based in which multiple\
    \ sensors are used to\nassess the health of the crop or remote sensing-based in\
    \ which crop health is assessed by performing\nsome computation on spectral images.\
    \ We can compare crop health monitoring application based\non some attributes\
    \ such as which sensors are used in particular applications, whether web or mobile\n\
    services are provided or not, etc. The comparative analysis of some existing crop\
    \ health monitoring\napplications is presented in Table 8 based on some attributes.\n\
    To precisely monitor the crop health, both IoT-based techniques and remote sensing\
    \ techniques\nshould be used together to provide more reliable and accurate information\
    \ about the crop. As a\nproof of concept, we present a case study in which a crop\
    \ health monitoring system based on IoT and\nremote sensing techniques is proposed.\
    \ We provide a complete end-to-end solution in the agriculture\ndomain by facilitating\
    \ the agricultural user with web and mobile services so that he/she could be\n\
    informed about the latest condition of the crop in a timely manner. In this way,\
    \ remedy actions could\nbe performed in time, which will result in enhanced production.\n\

    N\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n16 of 25\n5. A Case Study on UAV-Based and IoT-Based\
    \ Precision Agriculture\nWe developed a complete solution for crop health monitoring\
    \ based on IoT and remote sensing.\nIn the proposed system, crop health is monitored\
    \ using data collected from multiple IoT sensors,\nas well as NDVI mapping of\
    \ spectral images captured by a drone. The architecture of the proposed\nsystem\
    \ is shown in Figure 1, which was designed according to two main modules. The\
    \ ﬁrst module\nwas a wireless sensor network-based system in which multiple wireless\
    \ nodes were developed. Each\nwireless node was comprised of a soil moisture sensor\
    \ used to monitor the water level of the soil,\na soil temperature sensor used\
    \ to check the temperature of the soil and air temperature and humidity\nsensors.\
    \ These nodes were deployed across the ﬁeld in a star topology fashion where the\
    \ master node\ncollected readings from all slave nodes and transmitted the captured\
    \ reading to the back-end server for\nfurther processing. The master node acted\
    \ as a gateway node, which received data from all slave nodes\nusing NRF communication\
    \ module. After performing initial processing, the master node transmitted\nthe\
    \ data to the cloud using GSM communication technology. In the case of the unavailability\
    \ of the\nGSM network, this node stored the captured data and transmitted to the\
    \ cloud upon the availability\nof network.\nThe second module was used to monitor\
    \ crop health using multi-spectral imagery, which was\ncollected by a multi-spectral\
    \ camera mounted on a drone. The NDVI was computed using Equation (1)\nto classify\
    \ between healthy and unhealthy plants by measuring the chlorophyll content in\
    \ the crops,\nwhich was further used to localize the area under stress precisely.\n\
    All collected data were sent to the cloud where further analysis was performed.\
    \ The web portal\nwas designed to help the farmer monitor the crop proﬁle over\
    \ the whole life cycle. Currently, we are\nmonitoring soil moisture, soil temperature,\
    \ air moisture and air temperature readings in real time\nalong with NDVI mapping\
    \ of spectral imagery. Multiple web services were provided on the web\nportal\
    \ including historical/real data visualization using graphs, weather monitoring,\
    \ NDVI mapping\nand the correlation among measured parameters. Figure 2 shows\
    \ the snapshots of the web portal\nalong with different services.\nFigure 1. System\
    \ architecture.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n17 of 25\nFigure 2. User interface of\
    \ the web portal.\nFor portability and remote monitoring, a mobile application\
    \ was also developed to facilitate the\nfarmer/agronomist/landlord with all the\
    \ web services that are available on web portal. The alerts\nare generated when\
    \ an abnormal behaviour is observed in the crop, which help the farmer to take\n\
    remedy actions in a timely manner. The user interfaces of the mobile application\
    \ are shown in Figure 3.\nTherefore, the web portal along with mobile applications\
    \ provides a complete solution, which enables\nagricultural users monitor the\
    \ current status of the crop, as well as previous details.\nFigure 3. User interface\
    \ of the mobile application.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n18 of 25\n6. Results and\
    \ Discussion\n6.1. Analysis of the Data Collected by IoT Nodes\nThe developed\
    \ IoT nodes were deployed across the wheat ﬁelds of an area of 1.4375 hectare.\n\
    The selected area was located in Islamabad, Pakistan. The wheat ﬁelds are shown\
    \ in Figure 4 along\nwith the IoT node and sensors. We deployed the system across\
    \ the wheat ﬁeld in March 2019 when\nwheat was in the grain ﬁlling and grain ripening\
    \ stage.\nFigure 4. System deployed across the wheat ﬁelds.\nWe collected the\
    \ sensors’ readings such as air temperature, air humidity, soil temperature and\n\
    soil moisture. We compared the observed crop parameters with the ideal wheat temperature\
    \ proﬁle\nas shown in Figure 5. Extreme variation in the weather of Islamabad\
    \ was observed in that particular\ntime period, which can be seen by how the actual\
    \ temperature for wheat crop deviated from the ideal\ntemperature proﬁle of the\
    \ wheat crop.\nFigure 5. Deviation of observed temperature from the ideal temperature\
    \ proﬁle.\nAdditionally, we performed linear regression to ﬁnd the correlation\
    \ between observed parameters,\nwhich provided insight into how changes in one\
    \ parameter can effect the other parameter. The linear\nregression found a relation\
    \ between the two parameters by ﬁtting the equation of the line using the\nobserved\
    \ dataset [69]. Equation (12) represents an equation of the line where mrepresents\
    \ the slope of\nline, while c indicates the y-intercept. The variables m and c\
    \ were learned from the data.\ny = mx + c\n(12)\nFigure 6A shows the correlation\
    \ between the observed air temperature and air humidity, which showed\nthat both\
    \ were negatively correlated. The correlation between air temperature and soil\
    \ temperature is\nshown in Figure 6B, which shows that both were positively correlated.\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 3796\n19 of 25\n(A)\n(B)\nFigure 6. (A) Correlation b/wair temperature\
    \ and air humidity. (B) Correlation b/w air temperature\nand soil temperature.\n\
    The rise in air temperature caused the air humidity to reduce, while it resulted\
    \ in an increase in\nsoil temperature and vice versa.\n6.2. Analysis of Multi-spectral\
    \ Images Captured by Drone\nTo collect multi-spectral imagery, we used the DJI-Phantom\
    \ Pro Advanced drone with the Sentera\nMulti-spectral-imaging sensor. The drone\
    \ had its own optical camera, while the multi-spectral camera\nwas mounted on\
    \ it to obtain spectral images. Multiple ﬂights of the drone were carried out\
    \ at the\nspeciﬁc growing stages of the crop, i.e., grain ripening and grain ﬁlling\
    \ stage. After collecting these\nimages, they were transferred to the cloud for\
    \ NDVI mapping. Figure 7A shows the optical image\nthat was captured on 16 May\
    \ 2019 when wheat was in the harvesting stage, while Figure 7B is its\nspectral\
    \ image, and Figure 7C is the NDVI mapping. Since wheat was at a mature stage,\
    \ its NDVI\nshould be very small, i.e., ideally there should be no green region\
    \ in the ﬁeld. However, in NDVI\nmapping, a large green region indicated the abnormal\
    \ behaviour of the crop. The green region was\ndue to naturally growing plants.\
    \ This information can be visualized on the web portal.\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nFigure\
    \ 7. Wheat crop. (A) Optical image; (B) spectral image; (C) NDVI mapping.\nThe\
    \ same process was performed in a maize ﬁeld when maize was in the grain ripening\
    \ stage.\nFigure 8A shows the optical image that was captured on 24 July 2019\
    \ when maize was in the grain\nripening stage, while Figure 8B is its spectral\
    \ image, and Figure 8C is the NDVI mapping. The same\nbehaviour can be observed\
    \ with the maize crop, i.e., there should be a minimal green region in the\nﬁeld.\
    \ However, in NDVI mapping, a large green region indicated the abnormal behaviour\
    \ of the crop.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n20 of 25\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nFigure 8. Maize\
    \ crop. (A) Optical image; (B) spectral image; (C) NDVI mapping.\n7. Challenges\n\
    PA has been used since the last few decades to enhance crops’ yield with reduced\
    \ costs and\nhuman effort, although the adoption of these novel techniques by\
    \ farmers is still very limited owing to\nthe following reasons or challenges.\n\
    7.1. Hardware Cost\nPA relies mostly on hardware such as sensors, wireless nodes,\
    \ drones, spectral imaging sensors,\netc., which are used to assess multiple parameters\
    \ in real time. These sensors have multiple limitations\nincluding high development,\
    \ maintenance and deployment cost. Some systems in PA are cost effective\nand\
    \ are suitable for small arable land, i.e., smart irrigation systems that require\
    \ low-cost hardware\ncomponents and sensors. However, drone-based systems for\
    \ crops’ health monitoring are feasible for\nlarge arable land due to high installation\
    \ cost.\n7.2. Weather Variations\nEnvironmental variation is one of the major\
    \ challenges that affects the accuracy of data collected\nby sensors. Sensor nodes\
    \ deployed in the ﬁeld are sensitive to environmental variations, i.e., rain,\n\
    ﬂuctuation in temperature, wind speed, sun light, etc. Communication between wireless\
    \ nodes\nand the cloud can be interrupted due interference induced in wireless\
    \ communication channels by\natmospheric disturbance. The satellite, air borne\
    \ and drone platforms are also sensitive to weather\nvariations. Imagery acquired\
    \ by these platforms is affected by contamination of clouds and other\nnatural\
    \ aerosols. The development of advanced techniques for atmospheric correction,\
    \ cloud detection\nand noise interpolation is a current open challenge, which\
    \ requires hard efforts from the research\ncommunity.\n7.3. Data Management\n\
    The sensors in PA constantly generate data. To ensure the integrity of data, some\
    \ data security\nmeasures needs to be in place, which will in turn enhance the\
    \ cost of the system. The readings from\nthe sensors have to be accurate in order\
    \ to take appropriate actions precisely when and where required.\nAn intruder\
    \ can corrupt the readings, and false readings will adversely reduce the effectiveness\
    \ of\nthe system. PA systems generate immense amounts of data, which require enough\
    \ resources to\nperform data analysis. Real-time data collected from sensors deployed\
    \ across the ﬁelds after a few\nminutes and spectral imagery acquired from high-altitude\
    \ or low-altitude platforms produce the bulk\nof the data, which increase the\
    \ storage and processing requirements. New software platforms and\nfacilities\
    \ for scalable management of Big Data sources are demanded. In this regard, the\
    \ generation\nof software-as-a-service solutions is focused on merging data management\
    \ and IoT thorough cloud\ncomputing platforms.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n21 of\
    \ 25\n7.4. Literacy Rate\nLiteracy is an important factor that inﬂuences the adoption\
    \ ratio in PA. In developing countries\nwhere the illiteracy rate is high, farmers\
    \ grow crops based on their experience. They do not utilize the\nstate-of-the-art\
    \ technologies in agriculture, which results in loss of production. Farmers need\
    \ to be\neducated in order to understand the technology or they have to trust\
    \ a third party for technical support.\nTherefore, in underdeveloped areas where\
    \ the literacy rate is not high, PA is not very common due to\nthe limitations\
    \ of resources and education.\n7.5. Connectivity\nNext-generation 5G networks\
    \ can be 100-times faster than 4G ones, making communication\nbetween devices\
    \ and servers much quicker. 5G can also carry much more data than other networks,\n\
    which makes it an ideal technology for transmitting information from remote sensors\
    \ and drones, key\ntools that are being tested in PA environments. The adoption\
    \ of new communication networks based\non 5G is a must in current applications\
    \ where secure and rapid data transfer enables real-time data\nmanagement and\
    \ support for decision making.\n7.6. Interoperability\nOne of the biggest problems\
    \ PA faces is the interoperability of equipment due to different digital\nstandards.\
    \ This lack of interoperability is not only obstructing the adoption of new IoT\
    \ technologies\nand slowing down their growth, but it also inhibits the gain of\
    \ production efﬁciency through smart\nagriculture applications. New methods and\
    \ protocols to integrate different machine communication\nstandards to unlock\
    \ the potential of efﬁcient machine-to-machine communication and data sharing\n\
    between machines and management information systems are required in the current\
    \ scenario of PA.\n8. Conclusion and Future Directions\nPrecision agriculture\
    \ is a modern practice used to enhance crops’ productivity using latest\ntechnologies,\
    \ i.e., WSN, IoT, cloud computing, Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning\n\
    (ML). Most of the research done so far indicates that PA-based practices have\
    \ a great inﬂuence on\nsustainability and productivity. The objective of PA is\
    \ to provide decision support systems based\non multiple parameters of crops,\
    \ i.e., soil nutrients, water level of the soil, wind speed, intensity of\nsunlight,\
    \ temperature, humidity, chlorophyll content, etc. However, several challenges\
    \ are involved\nin the development and deployment phase of these systems. This\
    \ article was aimed at providing a\nsurvey of modern technologies involving current\
    \ PA platforms, with the goal of supporting industry\nand research communities\
    \ on the development of modern applications for smart agriculture. A case\nstudy\
    \ was presented to prove the effectiveness of the PA in the agriculture domain.\n\
    Since the main objective of precision agriculture is to produce surplus yield\
    \ by optimizing the\nresources such as water, pesticides, fertilizers, etc., for\
    \ resource optimization, prescription maps play\nan important role, which enables\
    \ farmers to quantify resources required for healthy crops at any\nparticular\
    \ growth stage. Most of the research accomplished in the agriculture domain focuses\
    \ on the\nremote sensing platforms to collect imagery, which reﬂects only Vegetation\
    \ Indices (VIs) such as NDVI.\nThe prescription maps cannot be generated by only\
    \ using VIs; instead, multiple other factors need to\nbe considered such as soil\
    \ properties, soil moisture level, meteorological behaviour, etc.\nFunding: This\

    Get rights and content Highlights • First literature review paper of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management. • Four applications of blockchain
    technology are identified. • Six challenges for applying blockchain technology
    are identified. • Research gaps and future research directions are proposed. Abstract
    Agri-food value chain is an area of significant importance because of providing
    sustainable, affordable, safety and sufficient food, feed, fibre and fuel to consumers,
    it is critical to ensure these value chains running smoothly and successfully
    by applying advanced internet technologies. Blockchain technology is a new digital
    technological approach underpinned by the Industry 4.0 to ensuring data integrity
    and preventing tampering and single point failure through offering fault-tolerance,
    immutability, trust, transparency and full traceability of the stored transaction
    records to all agri-food value chain partners. This paper used systematic literature
    network analysis to review the state-of-the-art blockchain technology including
    its recent advances, main applications in agri-food value chain and challenges
    from a holistic perspective. The findings suggest that blockchain technology together
    with advanced information and communication technology and internet of things
    have been adopted for the improvement of agri-food value chain management in four
    main aspects: traceability, information security, manufacturing and sustainable
    water management. Six challenges have been identified including storage capacity
    and scalability, privacy leakage, high cost and regulation problem, throughput
    and latency issue, and lack of skills. Based on the critical analysis of literature,
    research gaps and future research directions are proposed in this paper regarding
    the applications and challenges of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain
    management. This study makes contributions to the extant literature in the field
    of agri-food value chain management by discovering the potential of blockchain
    technology and its implications for agri-food value chain performance improvements
    such as food safety, food quality and food traceability. Previous article in issue

    1. Introduction The agri-food value chain is a complex system responsible for
    the circulation of agri-food products from the initial stage of production to
    the final stage of consumption. In the circulation process, value chain members
    play a critical role in meeting the consumers’ demand for agri-food products and
    maintaining the quality and safety of products [1]. Simultaneously, with the rapid
    development of internet technologies in the value chain area, a large number of
    emerging technologies such as advanced information and communication technology
    (ICT) and the Internet of Things (IoT) have been applied to the agri-food value
    chain [46]. However, almost all the systems applied to the agri-food value chain
    are centralised, monopolistic, asymmetric and opaque, and may result in serious
    trust problem. Therefore, consumers’ confidence towards food safety has been broken
    after a series of food safety risk incidents and scandals over the last decades
    [46], such as mad cow disease, horsemeat scandal [2], toxic milk powder, genetically
    modified food and trench oil [3]. Consequently, detailed information of agri-food
    products from farm to fork is increasingly requested by consumers. Furthermore,
    how to build fault-tolerance, immutability, trust, transparency and full traceability
    of agri-food value chain [4], regulations and customers’ expectations towards
    food quality and food safety [5], the complexity of agri-food value chain [6],
    and the current applications of technologies and their potential issues/pitfalls
    [7] have attracted increasing attention from academics and practitioners. A potential
    solution to alleviate the above issues and concerns is usage of blockchain technology,
    which is a new digital technological approach underpinned by the Industry 4.0
    to ensuring data integrity and preventing tampering and any single point failure.
    Four special elements - decentralised, immutable, consensus, and democratic that
    are unique to blockchain networks that make the technology more attractive in
    promoting trust and transparency in the agri-food value chain fraught with errors,
    duplication and redundancies [68]. Crosby et al. [8] underlines that blockchain
    is essentially a distributed database system that records transactional data or
    other digital events that have been executed and shared among value chain participants.
    It enables agri-food value chain participants to establish a decentralized consensus
    on the sequence of events and the current status of the transaction [9]. Blockchain
    technology uses a combination of different technologies that have been applied
    in computer science such as public/private key cryptography, cryptographic hash
    functions and database technologies [10], which provides an innovative solution
    to achieve food traceability, transparency, safety and security [11]. Two prominent
    benefits of blockchain technology are that it provides a permanent transaction
    records which are grouped into individual blocks and cannot be tampered with;
    and it can replace those traditional paper tracking systems and manual monitoring
    systems, so as to prevent the traditional way of the value chain from suffering
    the inaccurate impact [39]. The academic interest in investigating the application
    of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management has been progressively
    expanded, with a rapid increase in the contributions of academic experts covering
    this aspect [[11], [12], [13],38]. Moreover, blockchain technology used in the
    agri-food value chain seems to be a promising research stream for future research,
    especially in the era of Industry 4.0 [14,83]. However, only a limited number
    of studies analyse the current applications and future research directions of
    blockchain technology in different industries. We found three reviews concerned
    with the blockchain technology and its impact on the social and economy, drawn
    up, respectively, by Anascavage and Davis [15], who identified 16 areas that blockchain
    technology could be applied to, including food security; Tama et al. [16] acknowledge
    four areas that blockchain technology has been applied to and considers that blockchain
    technology plays an important role in guaranteeing the traceability of the agri-food
    value chain; and finally Yli-Huumo et al. [17] conducted a systematic literature
    review (SLR) on current research of blockchain technology including security,
    wasted resources, usability and privacy. These reviews are, however, relatively
    general, and given the current research and applications of blockchain technology,
    none of the reviews addresses the application of the blockchain technology in
    the agri-food value chain management. Therefore, there is a lack of up-to-date
    reviews that offer a comprehensive overview of the main issues related to current
    applications, challenges and future research directions of the blockchain technology
    in the agri-food value chain management. Considering the above arguments, the
    main objective of this study is to fill this gap by offering a systematic literature
    network analysis (SLNA) of the recent contributions of blockchain technology in
    the agri-food value chain management, highlighting the research that has been
    developed over time, and identifying the challenges of applying blockchain technology
    to the agri-food value chain management, and proposing the most promising research
    directions for the future. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows.
    The methodology adopted in this paper is described in Section 2, while the application
    of the research methodology to the context under study is provided in Section
    3. Then, the current applications of blockchain technology in the agri-food value
    chain management are presented in Section 4 followed by the challenges for applying
    blockchain technology in the agri-food value chain that are presented in Section
    5. The research gaps and proposed future research directions are presented in
    Section 6. Finally, conclusions and research limitations are drawn in Section
    7. 2. Research methodology: systematic literature network analysis Systematic
    literature network analysis (SLNA) is constituted with two methods: systematic
    literature review (SLR) and citation network analysis (CNA). The purpose of integrating
    these two existing methodologies (SLR and CNA) is to maximize the advantages related
    to each of them: SLR provides a reproducible and rigorous method that is applied
    in this study to select the most relevant and high-quality studies from previous
    literature of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management. Through
    synthesising of the literatures, the state-of-the-art of applications and the
    challenges to apply blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management
    will be revealed. Simultaneously, why blockchain technology matters in agri-food
    value chain management is also disclosed. CNA offers an evidence-based approach
    to identifying the most-cited studies from the selected databases, revealing the
    contributions on blockchain technology theory building in the agri-food value
    chain management as well as suggesting future research directions that can facilitate
    the application of the blockchain technology to the agri-food value chain management
    [18]. The process of SLNA from the combination of SLR and CNA is shown in Fig.
    A1. 3. Applying the SLNA to the area under study The process of how to apply SLNA
    to the area of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management is described
    in the following five sub-sections. 3.1. Formulating the research questions The
    first stage of conducting SLNA is to formulate research questions. It is important
    to have well-specified, informative and clearly formulated research questions
    to avoid bias, error and ambiguity [19]. Therefore, the research questions were
    formulated based on the following process: (1) Brainstorming all types of applications
    of blockchain technology that can be used in agri-food value chain management;
    (2) Consulting with three experts in academia and agri-food industry to evaluate
    whether it is possible to apply the blockchain technology in these areas; (3)
    Examining possible applications of blockchain technology that can be applied to
    the agri-food value chain management. Based on the above processes and principles,
    the following research questions were formulated: RQ1. What are the main applications
    of blockchain technology that have been developed in agri-food value chain management?
    RQ2. What are the key challenges for applying blockchain technology to agri-food
    value chain management? RQ3. What are the research gaps and future research directions
    for applying blockchain technology to agri-food value chain management? 3.2. Locating
    study Denyer and Tranfield [20] proposed that a comprehensive list of core contributions
    is necessary to answer the review questions by searching the most relevant and
    high-quality studies. Eight databases were selected for literature search, including
    ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, Taylor & Francis Online, Wiley Online Library,
    Emerald, Google Scholar and IEEE Xplore. The rationale for selecting these databases
    is that they include the top science and technology journals, conference proceedings
    and business research journals. Consistent with other SLR papers in blockchain
    technology (e.g. [17,21,22]), the identified keywords were used as the search
    criteria in our review. Since the aim of this research is to identify the main
    issues relating to the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food value
    chain management, a combination of “blockchain” and “agri-food value chain management”,
    with all the related terms were used for searching the title, keywords and abstract
    in the selected electronic academic databases. These keywords were combined later
    through Boolean connectors to constitute different search strings to be applied
    in the databases. Furthermore, consultation with various practitioners and academics
    in the relevant field was conducted to confirm whether search strings were also
    necessary. Finally, a total of 45 search strings were identified by the authors
    to be included in the search process. A full list of search strings is shown in

    As a very recent and new research area, as discussed earlier, the term of blockchain
    technology was first coined in 2008 [16]. In fact, the idea of blockchain technology
    was hardly discussed before 2008. Therefore, we use the year 2008 as the starting
    point to search relevant publications. Further, to find more relevant and important
    studies to be included in the analysis, various reference types such as journal
    papers, conference papers and book chapters were included in the systematic review.
    Simultaneously, the identification of key articles and book chapters that provide
    background information on blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management
    were found from different sources, including colleagues working in the same field.
    The initial search with the specified keywords and open access in the selected
    eight databases from 2008 to 2018 resulted in a preliminary sample of 632 contributions.
    Afterwards, each study was checked by three authors by carefully analysing the
    abstracts, introductions and conclusions to reduce any subjective bias and enhance
    validity. Moreover, relevant book chapters and other publications that were not
    covered by the databases were then identified through carefully searching the
    references used in the previous literature (e.g. [17,21,22]). The review of the
    work of influential authors in the field of blockchain technology in agri-food
    value chain management was also carried out by the same three authors. A series
    of inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to include/exclude papers (Table
    2), which were built through a brainstorming session among these three authors.
    Studies that do not meet the inclusion criteria or duplicates or non-relevant
    studies were eliminated. As a result, 62 studies were finally selected. Table
    2. Criteria for inclusion or exclusion studies. Inclusion criteria Rationale Articles
    were published in peer-reviewed journals, conference proceedings and book chapters
    in English Peer-reviewed journals, conference papers and book chapters are considered
    to have better quality than non-peer-reviewed articles Articles were published
    between 2008 and 2018 The year 2008 was selected as the starting point as the
    term blockchain was coined in 2008 [16] The selected articles contain at least
    one keyword in their title or abstract Abstract or title focusing on the applications
    of blockchain technology was selected Judge relevance by fully reading all remaining
    abstract, introduction and conclusion The remaining abstract, introduction and
    conclusion focusing on the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food
    value chain were selected Judge relevance by fully reading all remaining articles
    Articles focusing on the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food value
    chain were selected All selected 62 studies were read entirely by the three authors
    independently. By cross-referencing all the citations and references and talking
    with experts in the experts from academia and the agri-food industry, nine additional
    studies were identified and added, resulting in a total of 71 academic peer-reviewed
    journal papers, conference papers and book chapters to be included in the analysis.
    The search and selection process is presented in Fig. A2. 3.4. Citation network
    analysis (CNA) CNA is an effective and efficient way to reveal the articles that
    represent the basis of the field and to identify which articles were used by many
    other authors for the development of their contributions [18]. The citation data
    (author, title, year, cited reference, source, time cited etc.) were collected
    from the Web of Science Core collection. Then, the software Gephi was used to
    build a citation network among the selected studies. Gephi is the leading visualization
    and exploration software for all graphs and networks, which can be applied to
    six main areas such as exploratory data analysis, link analysis, social network
    analysis, biological network analysis, and poster creation [23]. The rationale
    for this choice is that Gephi can provide large information handling capacity,
    friendly graphical user interface and high-quality output formats [24]. As shown
    in Fig. 1, a network consisting of 71 nodes was constructed. It comprises 47 connected
    components and 24 isolated components. Download : Download high-res image (822KB)

    studies. Note: Node size depends on the quantity of connected components. From
    the Fig. 1, we can see that the connected components were divided into seven clusters
    according to their citation information. For example, the orange cluster summarized
    the opportunities that blockchain technology could be applied in agri-food value
    chain management such as blockchain combined with IoT to be used in agri-food
    value chain, as well as used in agri-food value chain traceability. It is important
    to note that most of the papers included in this cluster were literature review
    papers [17,25,26]. A detailed analysis of benefits, opportunities and challenges
    of integrating blockchain technology with IoT were discussed in the cluster of
    black. There were four clusters (Light green, purple, red and blue) mainly discussed
    how to use blockchain technology to increase the agri-food value chain traceability
    and manufacturing conceptually and empirically. Simultaneously, different traceability
    models were proposed and tested. Finally, the green cluster represents how blockchain
    along with other technologies such as Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
    Internet of Things served as an engine of the 4th industrial revolution, and how
    these technologies can revolutionize the current agri-food value chain management
    [27,28]. The detailed information of each cluster is shown in Table 3. Table 3.

    A review [45]; How blockchain technology along with other technologies such as

    has gained increasing attention from researchers and practitioners, in 2016 Yli-Huumo
    et al. [17] proposed an SLR on blockchain technology by highlighting current research
    topics, challenges and future research directions from a technological perspective.
    Their research results indicate four research gaps existing in the current study:
    (1) Lack of high-quality journal papers, most of the papers are published in conferences,
    symposiums and workshops; (2) The majority of current research is conducted in
    Bitcoin environment, rather than in other blockchain environments; (3) Lack of
    research on usability; (4) No research on the challenges for applying blockchain
    technology, such as latency, throughput and bandwidth. Following Yli-Huumo et
    al. [17], a series of research articles attempt to fill the research gaps. Tian
    [38] and Faye [39] have explored the field of blockchain technology in the context
    of the agri-food value chain from a traceability perspective. The issue addressed
    is how to embed blockchain technology in the current traceability system to increase
    the transparency and security of the agri-food value chain. With the evolution
    of research in the blockchain-based traceability system, some researchers tried
    to examine some generic models for facilitating the development of blockchain-based
    traceability system, such as the “TRADE” model proposed by Maouchi et al. [36].
    Concerns about integrating blockchain technology in the agri-food value chain
    need to be addressed from a single company perspective firstly, therefore, Hamida
    et al. [40] provided a detailed analysis on enterprise blockchains of its applications,
    challenges and opportunities. It is interesting to note that within these studies,
    the paper An agri-food supply chain traceability system for China based on RFID
    & blockchain technology proposed by Tian [38] is the most frequently cited paper,
    which has been cited 16 times by other authors among the selected papers (Table
    4). At the current stage of research in blockchain technology for traceability,
    most researchers (e.g. [[38], [39], [40]]) considered blockchain technology as
    a competitive advantage for agriculture value chain participants to gain trust
    from customers. Finally, most of these articles focus on addressing blockchain-based
    traceability system from the perspective of conceptual development. Table 4. Most

    of research examines how to combine blockchain technology with the IoT that can
    be applied in agri-food value chain management. Christidis and Devetsikiotis [41]
    noted that the combination of blockchain technology with IoT would allow agri-food
    value chain participants to get automated time-consuming workflows in a new and
    unique way, as well as to reduce significant costs in the process. Following Christidis
    and Devetsikiotis [41], many researchers have tried to contribute the theory-building
    of integrating blockchain technology with IoT from different perspectives. Hammi
    et al. [49] explored how to improve trust relationship among agri-food value chain
    members by designing a blockchain-IoT application. Reyna et al. [50] investigated
    how blockchain technology could potentially improve the IoT. Finally, Davcev et
    al. [30] proposed a blockchain-based distributed cloud/fog platform for IoT to
    enable grape value chain. The research trends on blockchain-based IoT has been
    from generally discussing the challenges and opportunities for combining blockchain
    technology with IoT to how to design a blockchain-based IoT system for solving
    the trust issues among agri-food value chain members, which facilitate to build
    a distributed peer-to-peer systems to interact with agri-food value chain participants
    in a trust and auditable manner. The trends towards stricter rules on food safety
    and food quality leads some researchers to explore potential applications of blockchain
    technology in other fields of agri-food value chain management, such as how to
    apply blockchain technology in food manufacturing [43] and how to use blockchain
    technology to increase the water sustainability [59]. Regarding the performance
    of applying blockchain technology in the agri-food value chain management, just
    a few papers measure the performance from the perspective of reducing tracking
    time to improve the traceability [4] and increasing the efficiency of the traceability
    in the agri-food value chain [13]. Simultaneously, several literature review papers
    investigated how blockchain technology has been applied in different industries
    such as agri-food industry, financial service and healthcare [8,16]. They provide
    insights on the development of blockchain technology in different industries and
    facilitate researchers to investigate how to transfer the knowledge from theory
    to practice. 3.5. Thematic analysis Braun and Clarke [51] stated that “thematic
    analysis is a method for identifying, analysing and reporting patterns (themes)
    within data, which provides core skills that will be useful for conducting many
    other forms of qualitative analysis”. Holloway and Todres [52] underlined that
    thematic analysis can be seen as a foundational approach for qualitative analysis.
    In this paper, thematic analysis was used to allow blockchain themes being generated
    by six phases of analysis: reading the whole paper collected from SLR, generating
    initial codes, searching for themes, reviewing themes, defining and naming themes,
    and finally presenting the results. Following the process of thematic analysis,
    we divided the literature of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management
    based on the following themes: (1) current applications of blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management; (2) the challenges for applying the blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management. The detailed results from thematic
    analysis are presented in Section 4. Tama et al. [16] conducted a literature review
    on the blockchain technology and its current applications, where the majority
    of literature was concerned with the blockchain technology theory building and
    conceptual development. However, the findings in our study show that the trend
    has been gradually shifted from theory building trying to use blockchain technology
    in practice. Although the number of studies on how blockchain technology can be
    used in agri-food value chain management is increasing, there are a limited number
    of studies on how blockchain technology can be executed. 4. Current applications
    of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management The first application
    of the blockchain technology was Bitcoin – a peer-to-peer electronic cash system
    [53]. Then, blockchain technology evolved towards smart contracts with the ability
    to provide transparency and trust to the system [41]. A smart contract is a kind
    of computer program that stores on the blockchain and executes by all consensus
    nodes in the network. It can translate contractual clauses into code and store
    them into the storage file, and operate them automatically and independently in
    a prescribed manner based on the data that was included in the triggering transaction
    [54]. Through operating the smart contracts, the need for trusted intermediaries
    between partners can be minimized and the occurrence of malicious or accidental
    exceptions can be reduced. Thus, blockchain technology has been generalized and
    applied in different domains such as finance [55], smart city [56], healthcare
    [57] and agri-food value chain [43]. However, as reviewed by Yli-Huumo et al.
    [17], more than 80% of the academic papers on blockchain technology focused on
    the Bitcoin system, while less than 20% deal with other blockchain applications.
    Although it is a relatively new technology, blockchain is rapidly advancing and
    developing. Lucena et al. [58] stated that there was a huge opportunity for blockchain
    applications to global trade. Blockchain market is estimated to grow from 210.2
    million USD to 2312.5 million USD in the period from 2016 to 2021 based on the
    Global Opportunity Report [90]. Due to its potential increase in the global market,
    it is expected that blockchain technology will play a critical role in facilitating
    future industry development and revolution. However, Poberezhna [59] argued that
    the key challenge for blockchain was to be considered as a simply disruptive technology,
    rather than as an innovative integrative solution that could provide a value proposition
    across a number of business process. In the following four sub-sections, we analyse
    the literature of the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food value
    chain management by classifying them in four distinctive themes: traceability,
    information security, manufacturing and sustainable water management. 4.1. Applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain traceability According to Murki
    [60], different value chains need to embed blockchain technology in the current
    traceability system to create more agile value chains and closer customer relationship.
    Tse et al. [11] hold a similar view that the application of blockchain technology
    in the agri-food value chain may have been the optimal choice to fulfil the requirements
    of supervision and adaption of the fast-growing food market. More specifically,
    Kumar and Mallick [61] construe that blockchain technology has wider applications
    in agri-food value chain such as food delivery and shipping data records, food
    online ordering and transaction data, and food quality assurance data. To integrate
    blockchain technology in the existing traceability system of agri-food value chain,
    many researchers have tried to explore the options from different perspectives.
    Tian [38] proposed an agri-food value chain traceability system based on RFID
    (Radio-Frequency IDentification) and blockchain technology for helping Chinese
    agri-food markets to enhance their food safety and food quality during the logistics
    process. In their proposed traceability system, RFID was used for acquiring and
    sharing data in the agri-food value chain, meanwhile, blockchain technology was
    used for guaranteeing the data shared and published in this traceability system
    is reliable and authentic. However, some researchers argue that RFID technology
    and blockchain based traceability system has some defects in solving the counterfeit
    issues. For example, RFID tags can be cloned which can cause counterfeit parts
    to be circulated in the agri-food value chain [62]. To overcome the drawbacks
    of RFID, Boehm et al. [37] proposed an updated traceability system using blockchain
    technology combined with Near Field Communication (NFC) and verified users. In
    their proposed traceability system, users must provide valid user credentials
    if they want to update a product’s history on the blockchain. Thus, various changes
    of an agri-food product can be reported, and the capabilities of other members
    can be restricted at the same time. Therefore, holistic tracking agri-food products
    with higher transparency and security can be achieved. Faye [39] underlined that
    the application of blockchain technology in agri-food industry would foster more
    transparency and thus customers’ confidence towards agri-food products would be
    re-established. Although blockchain technology has great potential for revolutionizing
    current agri-food value chain traceability systems, it still has some inherent
    defects such as scalability that needs to be tackled, especially when we face
    mass data in the real world. Recent innovations in blockchain, such as scaling
    would change this working manner that requires every computer in the blockchain
    to process every transaction [63]. Croman et al. [64] argued that a scaled blockchain
    could accelerate the transaction process, without sacrificing high security, by
    determining the optimal number of computers to validate each transaction and divide
    work efficiently. Therefore, Tian [46] investigated a value chain traceability
    system based on HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point), blockchain
    technology and IoT. In their proposed new decentralized traceability system, HACCP
    was used to prevent food risk occurrences, and IoT combined with blockchain technology
    was used to continuously deliver massive real-time food-related information to
    all value chain partners in an effective, safe and efficient manner. Then, a case
    testing experiment was used to check whether the system was feasible or not. The
    research results indicate that food safety, value chain efficiency and transparency
    have been effectively improved. Badzar [65] emphasizes that openness and unchangeable
    attributes of blockchain ensure high transparency, stability and reliability of
    agri-food value chain, as well as provide liquidity, more accurate record-keeping
    and high transparency of ownership [66]. To have deep understanding of knowledge
    on how blockchain technology can be used to enhance agri-food business, Rabah
    [28] conducted a review on the applications of big data and blockchain technology
    in the agri-food industry. Their research results reveal that blockchain technology
    played a critical role in creating secure and transparent ledger that was available
    to all the involved participants within the agri-food value chain including the
    producers, manufacturers, logistics service providers, wholesalers, retailers
    and regulators. They provide insights into the effects of blockchain technology
    on the current traceability system, and facilitate the development of blockchain
    technology in the agri-food value chain management. Finally, Biswas et al. [67]
    propose a blockchain based wine value chain traceability system where every transaction
    is recorded as a block in the chain and is visible to relevant value chain members
    such as the grape grower, wine producer, bulk distributor, transit cellar, filler/packer,
    finished goods distributor, wholesaler and retailer entity. One of the most important
    features of their proposed system is that anyone can trace the purchase history
    of the wine by inputting the product ID in the system. However, their work just
    examines an example, rather than a practical application of blockchain technology
    in the wine value chain. Maouchi et al. [36] argue that although various approaches
    have been proposed to create a decentralized traceability system for agri-food
    value chain, these works do not state the feasibility of their work and their
    application for the agri-food value chain. Due to the great potential benefits
    of applying blockchain technology to agri-food value chain traceability system,
    several agricultural industry enterprises around the world have evaluated the
    effect of blockchain technology. For example, Walmart plans to invest $25 million
    over five years from 2017 to establish one food safety collaboration centre in
    Beijing to build a completely new food traceability system with blockchain technology.
    Their mango blockchain solution pilots reduced the time for tracking mango origins
    from seven days to 2.2 s, thus, more transparency and greater efficiency have
    been achieved in Walmart’s food value chain. Then, a pork value chain traceability
    system combined with barcode has been built based on the mango blockchain solutions
    [13]. Yiannas [68] states that the biggest advantage of this system is that it
    allows any trusted users to verify the traceability and authenticity of the product
    at any point of the pork value chain. Despite the increasing emphasis on applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain traceability system, recent studies
    conducted by Kshetri [69] show that just a few researchers have begun to systematically
    assess the effects of blockchain technology on current agri-food value chain traceability
    system. Caro et al. [4] introduced an AgriBlockIoT traceability system for agri-food
    value chain management. It was constituted with three main components, a REST
    Application Interface with the responsibilities to integrate with the existing
    software system, a controller equipped with the abilities to query and convert
    the data records stored in the blockchain, and blockchain involved with smart
    contracts as a gateway to the blockchain itself. It is important to note that
    smart contracts can fire autonomously; hence creating records whenever anomalies
    are detected. Then, two different implementations, namely Ethereum and Hyperledger
    Sawtooth were used to do the performance analysis of traceability. Their research
    results indicate that Hyperledger Sawtooth has better performances than the Ethereum
    counterpart and may be more suitable for IoT devices, because Etherum is quite
    CPU-intensive. Based on the case study for grain quality assurance tracking, Lucena
    [58] finds out that quality measurement throughout the transportation for grains
    along the value chain is always accompanied with fraud, poor monitoring and delay
    to final destinations. Their findings indicate that using blockchain technology
    in the grain value chain traceability system is the best way at present to reduce
    disputes among business partners and information asymmetries. Finally, Kumar and
    Iyengar [70] demonstrated a blockchain based traceability framework for rice value
    chain management. In their proposed framework, blockchain was used to record all
    related issues happening within the rice value chain and monitor the security
    and quality of rice in the transportation process. It is important to note that
    all members in the rice value chain should register themselves and match their
    unique identities and digital profiles in the blockchain system. The research
    result indicates that the security of rice in the transportation process and the
    efficiency of the rice value chain have been greatly improved. 4.2. Applying blockchain
    technology in the agri-food value chain information security Under the background
    of Industry 4.0 and distributed computing, the characteristics of information
    system in agri-food industry have experienced substantial changes. Blockchain
    technology has inherent benefits such as recording transactions in real-time,
    no intermediary, immutability and distributed ledger, which becomes the first
    choice for agri-food value chain managers to enhance information security [60].
    Tse et al. [11] construed that blockchain was a well worthy technology for helping
    agri-food value chain participants to record and transfer transactions authentically.
    Leng et al. [1] proposed a public blockchain for agricultural value chain system
    along with double-chain architecture. The research results reveal that the proposed
    agricultural business resource blockchain not only can increase the security of
    transaction information and privacy of enterprise information, but also can enhance
    the credibility of the public service platform and facilitate overall increase
    of efficiency across the whole value chain system. Neisse et al. [71] explored
    a blockchain-based approach to achieve data accountability and provenance tracking.
    Their findings indicate that for the dynamic data frequently shared among value
    chain members such as the transaction record in agri-food value chain, which have
    strict scalability and performance requirements, controllers or processors should
    manage a contract that registers all subjects accepting all or part of usage conditions.
    Recently, with the advancement of IoT, machine-to-machine (M2M) connections is
    estimated to increase to 3.9 billion to 2022 [72]. More and more agri-food value
    chain participants are being equipped with interconnected electronic devices and
    protocol suites to increase the connectivity and sophisticated data gathering
    and analytics capabilities [50]. However, most of the IoT solutions are dependent
    on the centralized server-client paradigm, connecting to the cloud servers through
    the Internet [26]. Decentralised architectures such as building a large Peer-to-Peer
    (P2P) Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) may cause privacy and security issues to the
    users [73]. Thus, effective tools to ensure information security need to be supported
    by agri-food value chain participants to meet the requested security requirements.
    Currently, around 50% of agri-food practitioners have been experimenting blockchain
    technology with creating proof-of-concept, and 17% of agri-food practitioners
    have been preparing to deploy and use it in their business [74]. Hammi et al.
    [49] proposed a public blockchain-based approach in which devices can communicate
    with each other in a completely secure and efficient way by creating a secure
    virtual zone. After a series of tests, the research results indicate that the
    blockchain-based system demonstrated high resilience towards attacks. Iansiti
    and Lakhani [42] underlined that blockchain technology could provide secure, irreversible,
    distributed, transparent and accurate information sharing service. After conducting
    research on blockchain-based distributed cloud/fog platform for IoT, Davcev et
    al. [30] proposed that holistically using these blockchain-based ICT technologies
    has a positive effect in increasing the quality of agri-food products. 4.3. Applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food manufacturing In today’s highly competitive
    and knowledge-based economy, managing massive amount of information and services
    is the basic requirement for successful food manufacturers. As the information
    and services are diversified, growing in an accelerating velocity, and highly
    complex, an increase number of food manufacturers have difficulties in acquiring
    and managing them alone. Wang et al. [75] state that it is necessary for food
    manufacturers to work together and sustain their competitiveness. To address this
    issue, some researchers have started integrating blockchain concept into manufacturing
    practices. Li et al. [35] proposed a decentralized framework to manage the knowledge
    and services shared between different enterprises based on the blockchain application
    involved smart contracts and edge computing. In their proposed framework, edge
    computing acted as a foundation for providing distributed network, storage and
    computing capabilities in the manufacturing environment. The smart contracts played
    as interfaces between enterprise and its partners for successfully interact. Thus,
    a signed secure and controllable connection between the enterprise and the partner
    could be built with the transaction record and the status were updated on the
    blockchain. A case study was used to examine the effectiveness of the decentralized
    framework. The case study results indicate that manufacturers can develop scalable
    and flexible businesses at a lower cost, and ultimately the overall quality, efficiency,
    and effectiveness of manufacturing services can be improved. Furthermore, Zhao
    et al. [76], built a model of manufacturing service information based on blockchain
    principle and cloud computing, which theoretically solves the problems of sharing
    and securing the manufacturing resources, recalling the product data and guaranteeing
    the quality of the processing. Finally, Kumar and Mallic [61] reported that blockchain
    technology could be used in various perspectives of manufacturing, such as manufacturing
    management, production data, product warranty information and product assurance.
    Although blockchain technology has been seen as a critical element in the manufacturing
    sector in recent years, the role of blockchain technology for promoting resilience,
    scalability, security and autonomy of manufacturing service has been relatively
    overlooked [14]. 4.4. Applying blockchain technology in sustainable water management
    The agriculture productivity is highly dependent on water resource management.
    How to use water resources effectively and efficiently is crucial for agriculture
    development. To drive the sustainable development of water, it is critical to
    address water scarcity aspects that are deeply interrelated with agri-food development.
    Therefore, Civic Ledger [77] considered to develop a blockchain-enabled peer-to-peer
    trading platform (Water Ledger) that would allow more irrigators to participate
    in the platform that entitles and allocates water securely and transparently,
    further boosting the overall efficiency of water resources. Though creating new
    digital identity for irrigators and digitizing the water assets in agri-food value
    chain will cost a lot of money, Poberezhna [59] argues that blockchain combined
    with smart contracts can potentially help water companies and government bodies
    to access real-time data regarding market shares, consumption patterns and management
    of utility bills of consumers, thus, greater transparency to regulators and auditors
    can be achieved. Their research also indicates that recordkeeping will be significantly
    reduced when the blockchain platform is applied in water trading. 5. The challenges
    for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain Blockchain technology
    is still in testing phase and its implementation in agri-food value chain management
    has some issues that need to be tackled. Therefore, in this section, we will scrutinize
    the challenges to apply blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management.
    A review of the literature indicates that there are six main challenges for applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management: storage capacity and
    scalability issue, privacy leakage, regulation problem, high cost problem, throughput
    and latency issue, and lack of skills. 5.1. Storage capacity and scalability Storage
    capacity along with scalability issues have been deeply questioned in the blockchain.
    Koteska et al. [25] stated that one of the main challenges for blockchain implementation
    is scalability. To provide theoretically proven security, it is necessary to have
    a large number of full nodes (a node that can fully validate transactions and
    blocks) in the blockchain implementation. The nodes in the blockchain network
    are expected to validate each transaction of each block [50]. Otherwise, blockchain
    implementation in agri-food value chain management might result in a less decentralized
    system. Koteska et al. [25] proposed that scalability negatively affected three
    dimensions of the blockchain, the size of the data on the blockchain, the transaction
    processing rate and the latency of data transmission on the blockchain. Although
    only full nodes store the full chain, storage requirements are also significant
    [50]. For example of the Bitcoin, the blockchain is always growing with a rate
    of 1MB per block every ten minutes and store a large amount of data in every node
    that no interest for them [26]. As the number of transactions increase in the
    agri-food value chains, the amount of data becomes larger, and the loading of
    store and computing accompanied with data becomes harder, which results in the
    blockchain becoming bulky [78]. Simultaneously, every participant in the agri-food
    value chain needs to constantly store all transaction data to validate them on
    the blockchain because they need to check if the source of the current transaction
    is unspent or not [83]. Thus, with the node size increasing, additional resources
    are required by the nodes. Finally the system’s capacity scale is reduced and
    synchronization time for the new user is increased [50]. 5.2. Privacy leakage
    In the blockchain, each transaction can be traced, checked and audited and every
    user can be identified by their public key or its hash. Undoubtedly, blockchain
    technology provides a new level of transparency and helps to build trust. However,
    it also has negative effect on protecting users’ privacy [50]. Kosba et al. [79]
    stated that blockchain could not guarantee the transactional privacy even with
    the permission management because the information on blockchain was available
    to all participants who belonged to the blockchain network. Lu and Xu [80] underlined
    that every member could access all information on the blockchain because there
    were no privileged users. Maouchi et al. [36] argued that some agri-food value
    chain members might be competitors with each other and they did not enjoy the
    transparent traceability system. Therefore, many efforts for protecting privacy
    in blockchain has been done such as obfuscation on the transaction relationships
    to prevent linking or tracing analysis, hiding the identifies of the sender and
    the receiver through complicated cryptographic schemes, and blinding the transaction
    content whilst retaining the verifiability and computability [81]. In order to
    ensure transactions are not easily to be traced to any given person or computer,
    Monero [82] applies ring of signatures scheme to guarantee transactions untraceable.
    Other schemes such as Stealth Addresses, Pedersen Commitments, Ring Signature,
    Homomorphic Encryption, Zero-knowledge-proof have been used in blockchains to
    improve privacy, but no schemes can hide the sender, the receiver and the amount
    at the same time [40]. Kosba et al. [79] tackled these privacy issues differently
    through using encrypted transactions. The Hawk – a decentralized smart contract
    is responsible for translating the generic code written by programmers into cryptographic
    primitives such as zero-knowledge proofs that retaining transactional privacy.
    After researching in the wine value chain traceability system, Biswas et al. [67]
    stated that there were two drawbacks of the blockchain technology: one is the
    transaction speed; the other one is privacy as neither companies nor individuals
    would like to publish all information onto a public database. 5.3. High cost problem
    Lin and Liao [83] proposed that agri-food value chain participants would need
    a lot of money and time to embed blockchain technology in the current agri-food
    value chain traceability system. Yli-Huumo et al. [17] noted that when blockchain
    became more complex, the computational power would be another critical issue,
    as it required more computational power to confirm more blocks. Simultaneously,
    energy consumption also needs to be taken into consideration [39]. After conducting
    a case study on blockchain-based traceability system, Lu and Xu [80] pointed out
    some public blockchains inherent with a proof-of-work consensus mechanism wasted
    a lot of electricity. Most of the electricity is consumed in two different ways:
    (1) a large amount of electricity is used for the mining process, which involves
    a consensus algorithm that consists in a sort of brute force search for a hash;
    (2) another amount of electricity is consumed in peer-to-peer communications because
    it requires an edge device to be powered [26]. 5.4. Regulation problem Agri-food
    value chains are extended across the globe. Hence, applying blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management needs to be considered from a global perspective.
    However, blockchain is a new technology that involves different people from various
    countries without any legal or regulation to follow. Additionally, the absence
    of a central authority and the non-existent of censorship in the current blockchain
    system, this situation creates many uncertainties [50]. Atlam et al. [29] stated
    that this was a serious problem for both agri-food manufacturers and service providers.
    Therefore, it is necessary to introduce new laws or regulations to monitor and
    regulate blockchain applications in the agri-food industry for compliance [8].
    After conducting a case study on grain quality assurance tracking-based on blockchain
    technology, Lucena et al. [58] found a controversial issue when using blockchain
    technology regarding its legal value. Their research also indicates that complex
    agri-food value chain scenarios involving international trade and arbitration
    laws are yet to be proven. 5.5. Throughput and latency issue In the context of
    agri-food value chain management, due to the original restriction of block size
    and the time interval used to generate a new block, the current processing capacity
    of blokchain cannot fulfil the requirements of processing millions of transactions
    in real-time. Aste et al. [84] (p.26) stated that “a system that could handle
    large transaction volumes would require large blocks or mechanisms in which multiple
    blocks are validated simultaneously”. All the above issues will cause a big problem
    for clients when running a blockchain-based system. After investigating an RFID
    and blockchain based traceability system for agri-food value chain, Tian [38]
    stated that there were two obstacles for applying blockchain technology: (1) the
    transaction capacity of blockchain is restricted to seven transactions per second
    due to the restricted size of block; (2) how to deal with storage and synchronization
    issues with the growing size of the blockchain. Regarding latency, it is critical
    to note that current blockchain system needs some time to process transactions.
    For example, in the case of Bitcoin, block creation times follow a Poisson distribution
    with an average of ten minutes (10-minute block interval with 6-block confirmation)
    [26]. As for Ethereum, it is estimated around 3 min for 14-second block interval
    with 12-block confirmation [85]. Jindal et al. [86] construed that the time required
    for generating blocks and validating transactions is increases with an increase
    in the number of transactions. Sharma et al. [87] evaluated the performance of
    a blockchain-based distributed framework involved with Proof-of-Work algorithm
    and found that additional cost in computing sources and more processing time is
    required in case of network delays. 5.6. Lack of skills Given that blockchain
    is a new technology, a limited number of people have in-depth knowledge and skills
    about how blockchain can be used in agri-food value chain management [29]. To
    obtain general knowhow in blockchain technology and expectations of the technology
    in the context of agri-food value chain, Ge et al. [10] conducted numerous interviews
    and meetings with agri-food value chain stakeholders. They found that a considerable
    level of scepticism existed among stakeholders with low know-how of blockchain
    technology, partly due to the way blockchain was portrayed as panacea to all information
    problems, partly due to a series of technical issues that remained to be resolved.
    Therefore, Iansiti and Lakhani [42] proposed that applying blockchain technology
    in the agri-food value chain was likely to be a long process. Simultaneously,
    a widespread lack of understanding on how blockchain works in other areas also
    exists [88]. 6. Discussion: research gaps and future research directions Below,
    we summarized the research gaps and future research directions on blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management based on our systematic review of the literature.
    6.1. Future research directions for the applications of blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management The analysis of the applications of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management allows us to better understand
    how blockchain technology has been applied and evolved in agri-food value chain
    management. Several directions for future research about implementing blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management are suggested and summarized in
    the following. • In the context of applying blockchain technology in agri-food
    value chain traceability, various researchers proposed different blockchain-based
    traceability system that involved different technologies such as RFID, IoT, NFC,
    cloud computing, and big data, as well took different agri-food value chain entities
    into consideration (see Table 5). It is interesting to note that the traceability
    system proposed by Davcev et al. [30] could provide a comprehensive function for
    monitoring the land status, vegetable status, as well as to help to achieve the
    transparent and secure agri-food value chain. Therefore, should be implemented
    in reality. However, most of the proposed traceability systems are staying in
    conceptual phase and there is little empirical research to suggest which one is
    most applicable to the reality. Additionally, just few researchers considered
    third-party regulators/authority organizations in their proposed traceability
    framework. Therefore, one of the priorities for researching the blockchain-based
    traceability system is to conduct empirical research involving third-party regulators/authority
    organizations on different context of agri-food value chains to assess the performance
    of the blockchain-based traceability system. Thus, future studies can evaluate
    the proposed blockchain-based traceability framework effects from different perspectives,
    such as computation costs, transaction processing speed, storage capability, and
    the overall efficiency of agri-food value chains. Table 5. Blockchain technology

    in the agri-food supply chain can share the same business rules and transaction

    if involved in the international trade. • There are two main areas in the literature
    for using blockchain technology to improve agri-food value chain information security:
    one is using blockchain technology alone; the other one is using blockchain technology
    combined with other technologies such as IoT (see Table 6). Obviously, double
    blockchain architecture has it unique advantages such as efficiency, transparency
    and privacy can be achieved with more data can be stored in the blockchain. Key
    technical components such as decentralized storage, mining hardware, and consensus
    mechanisms are easily to be achieved. However, it needs more effective consensus
    mechanism to deal with large amount of nodes and resources that stored in public
    service platform. Therefore, future research should investigate which consensus
    algorithm is more effective compared with others (Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake,
    etc) in the same context. IoT applications have its own drawbacks such as they
    generate large volume of data and require connectivity and power for long periods.
    Besides, there are other limitations in memory, computer capacity, networks and
    limited power supply. In order to alleviate above issues, one important future
    research direction is to decide where the interactions will take place when combining
    blockchain technology with IoT, for example, inside the IoT, or blockchain, or
    a hybrid approach involving blockahin and IoT. It will need to discuss the advantages
    and disadvantages of these blockchain-IoT based applications through comparative
    analysis. This area is open for future researchers to investigate the impact and
    relative importance, and identify which one is the optimal choice to enhance agri-food
    information security. Table 6. Blockchain technology used for agri-food value
    chain information security. Authors Involved technologies Architecture Advantages
    Disadvantages Leng et al. [1] Blockchain Double chain architecture based on public

    and data would be increased Hybrid approach (1) Part of the data are stored in
    the blockchain, and the rest are direct shared with other partners (1) High cost
    because involved more devices • Another finding of this study is a new trend of
    focusing on blockchain technology to achieve a higher level of sharing knowledge
    and services among agri-food manufacturers. Current agri-food manufacturing ecosystem
    is changing from integrated and centralized systems to shared and distributed
    systems. Most of the proposed framework for achieving higher performance were
    based on the blockchain technology and cloud computing, which aimed to provide
    a secure, low energy consumption and high efficiency systems to agri-food manufacturers.
    However, it still has some drawbacks. For example, unstable data transmission,
    lack of uniformed technology standard and low internet speed, etc. Blockchain
    technology integrated with edge computing provide a new way to achieve a higher
    level knowledge sharing performance through developing a distributed, sharing,
    standardized, and secured framework. Key technological components such as communication
    protocol, decentralized storage, smart contracts, edge cloud are all needed to
    build this system. However, there are questions remaining about the combination
    of blockchain and edge computing in enhancing overall efficiency and effectiveness
    of agri-food manufacturers. Thus, future studies should apply the blokchain technology
    and edge computing in different agri-food manufacturers using empirical and analytical
    tools to assess its effect on agri-food manufacturing. • A new trend emerging
    in the literature is the application of blockchain technology in sustainable water
    management. A few studies discussed how to apply blockchain technology to enhance
    water sustainability. However, these studies just considered how to enhance water
    sustainability from irrigator’s perspective and water company’s perspective, rather
    than taking the whole agri-food value chain stakeholders into consideration. Therefore,
    future work should holistically consider how to use blockchain technology to enhance
    water sustainability from the whole agri-food value chain perspective. 6.2. Future
    research directions for addressing the challenges of applying blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management From our systematic literature review, six
    key challenges emerged for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain
    management, they are storage capacity and scalability, privacy leakage, high cost
    problem, regulation problem, throughput and latency issue, and lack of skills.
    Although a growing body of literature is available on discussing these challenges,
    a number of challenges still exist. The purpose of this section is to highlight
    the main challenges identified in the literature and propose future research directions
    for unsolved problems. The identified solutions for the challenges of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management are summarized in Table 7. • One
    of key challenges for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain
    is the storage capacity. Although some researchers broadly investigated several
    methods that could enhance the storage capacity, for example, store part of the
    data on-chain and part of the data off-chain [85], build a multi-layers blockchain
    architecture with different purposes [40], and develop a new algorithm involved
    deep learning concept [12] (see Table 7). It is easily to find that more computational
    power is required when implementing these solution methods. Therefore, future
    work should investigate how to appropriate solve the data storage problem without
    increasing the computational power. Specifically, integrating the deep learning
    concept or artificially intelligence concept with current algorithms such as ant
    colony algorithm to achieve computational power efficiency and systematically
    eliminate the irrelevance data of blockchain provide a new route for solving the
    storage problem. Furthermore, comparative analysis of implementing these possible
    solutions in the context of agri-food value chain should be conducted empirically
    and analytically. • Most of the researchers investigated how to solve privacy
    leakage issues from single blockchain architecture perspective, and have applied
    different schemes such as Stealth Addresses, Pedersen Commitments, Ring signature,
    Homomorphic encryption, Zero-Knowledge-Proof to protect privacy of users. Few
    researchers investigated how to protect privacy from a double blockchain architecture
    perspective, that is, one for public, one for agri-food value chain participants.
    Therefore, future work should investigate how to design and evaluate double chain
    structures for blockchain. Further, conduct experiments to check how to combine
    the above-listed data privacy schemes to maximum the performance of data privacy
    mechanisms. • As for the high cost problem, different consensus algorithms have
    been proposed by various authors such as Proof-of-Stake and delegated Proof-of-Stake
    algorithm. Though these two algorithms have various advantages such as reducing
    the computing time, less nodes will be involved in the block validation, etc.
    However, no one have conducted comparative analysis using these two algorithms
    in empirical study in the context of agri-food value chain. This area is open
    for future researchers to systematically investigate the impact and relative importance
    of different mechanisms using empirical and analytical tools. • As discussed earlier,
    blockchain is a new technology which neither has any legislations or regulations
    to follow, nor has a defined way of how to insert the implications arising from
    blockchain technology into a norm setting. Although the application of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain is currently still in its infancy, it can
    be expected that more initiatives will be taken by various agri-food organizations
    [10]. Therefore, more work should be taken from theory and empirical perspectives
    to check the effects of blockchain technology on the agri-food value chain, especially
    to check its effect in the international agri-food trade, and then formulate corresponding
    standards based on the research results. • As for the throughput and latency issue,
    some researchers proposed different methods to solve this problem such as implementing
    Bitcoin-NG algorithm and increase the size of each block [17,89]. However, both
    of methods are not perfect enough which will have side effects such as larger
    blocks make full nodes more expensive to operate, and the latency is limited by
    the propagation time of the network, etc. Therefore, how to choose appropriate
    algorithm and block size without side effects become very important in solving
    the throughput and latency issue of blockchain. It is necessary to holistically
    consider this problem with continually experiments and get an optimal solution.
    • Finally, concerned with the lack of skills, we did not find many publications
    that gave us clear answers on this challenge. Only Ge et al. [10] proposed two
    learning objectives for solving the challenge of lacking skills: (1) learn general
    knowledge of blockchain technology; (2) identify how to benefit from blockchain
    technology. Table 7. The identified solutions for the challenges of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management. Main challenges Possible solutions

    analysis of these two algorithms using empirical study in the context of agri-food
    value chain. Perform delegated Proof-of-Stake algorithm [78] 1. Less nodes involved
    in block validation; 2. Block size and intervals can be adjusted by delegates.
    1. Transactions are performed faster; 2. Dishonest delegates can cause financial
    loss. Regulation problem 1. Design and implementation of a clear regulatory framework
    for blockchain implementation in the agri-food domain and develop the evidence
    for the added value of the blockchain technology [10]; 2. Government should set
    up blockchain infrastructure to support policy formulation [26]. 1. Accelerate
    the process of formulating policies and regulations related to the blockchain
    implementation. 2. Make blockchain technology is easily accepted by agri-food
    value chain participants. 1. Government need to invest a lot of money and human
    resources, and may not get the suitable results. 1. Investigate the effects of
    blockchain technology on agri-food value chain, especially on the international
    agri-food trade, and then formulate standards and regulations. Throughput and
    latency issue 1. Implement Bitcoin-NG consensus algorithm [89]; 2. Increase the
    size of each block [17]. 1. Improve the latency and bandwidth without sacrificing
    other properties such as security; 2. More transactions speed per second. 1. Bandwidth
    is limited by the bandwidth of nodes and the latency limited by the propagation
    time of the network. 2. More expensive for managing larger blocks. 1. Holistically
    consider this problem to find the optimal solution for integrating Bitcoin-NG
    consensus algorithm and appropriate size of each block. Lack of skills Not addressed
    7. Conclusions In this study, we conducted an SLNA to review existing work on
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management. Through question formulation,
    locating studies, study selection and evaluation, we identified 71 publications,
    including journal papers, conference proceedings and book chapters. Then, we used
    software Gephi to build a citation network based on the citation data collected
    from Web of Science, which helped us to identify current trends and future research
    directions of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management. The target
    publications of this study covered a broad spectrum of themes such as blockchain-based
    information security and traceability system, and blockchain-based water sustainability
    and food manufacturing. By synthesising the literature of blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management within a 10-year timeframe (2008–2018), this
    paper makes contributions to existing knowledge in three aspects: (1) The paper
    provides an overall picture of the evolution of blockchain technology and its
    application in agri-food value chains. (2) The paper elicited key challenges and
    proposed initial solutions for applying blockchain technology to agri-food value
    chain. (3) Research gaps have been identified and future research directions were
    suggested for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management.
    The findings of this study provide a solid foundation for future studies in the
    area of blockchain technology and agri-food value chain management. Acknowledgment

    \ has opened productive ways to cultivate soil with the use\nof low-cost hardware\
    \ (sensors/actuators) and communication (Internet) technologies. Remote\nequipment\
    \ and crop monitoring, predictive analytic, weather forecasting for crops or smart\
    \ logistics\nand warehousing are some examples of these new opportunities.\nNevertheless,\
    \ farmers are\nagriculture experts but, usually, do not have experience in IoT\
    \ applications. Users who use IoT\napplications must participate in its design,\
    \ improving the integration and use. In this work, different\nindustrial agricultural\
    \ facilities are analysed with farmers and growers to design new functionalities\n\
    based on IoT paradigms deployment. User-centred design model is used to obtain\
    \ knowledge and\nexperience in the process of introducing technology in agricultural\
    \ applications. Internet of things\nparadigms are used as resources to facilitate\
    \ the decision making. IoT architecture, operating rules\nand smart processes\
    \ are implemented using a distributed model based on edge and fog computing\n\
    paradigms. A communication architecture is proposed using these technologies.\
    \ The aim is to help\nfarmers to develop smart systems both, in current and new\
    \ facilities. Different decision trees to\nautomate the installation, designed\
    \ by the farmer, can be easily deployed using the method proposed\nin this document.\n\

    1. Introduction\nPrecision Agriculture (PA) is a whole-farm management approach\
    \ using information technology,\nremote sensing and proximal data gathering. These\
    \ technologies have the goal of optimising returns\non inputs while potentially\
    \ reducing environmental impacts. Farmers and agronomists have already\nbegun\
    \ employing technologies in order to improve the efﬁciency of their work. Sensors\
    \ placed\nin greenhouses allow farmers to obtain detailed data on real-time as\
    \ variables such as soil and\nambient temperature, irrigation water and soil conductivity,\
    \ soil and irrigation water PH, nutrient\ncomposition data, irrigation water properties,\
    \ etc. These data can be transmitted and analysed using\ncommunication technologies\
    \ and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) paradigms could be applied. Farmers use\ntheir\
    \ smartphones to remotely monitor their crops and equipments and to run some statistical\
    \ data.\nAll of these techniques help make up PA. Nowadays, the farmers are using\
    \ resources developed by\ninformation and communication technologies. These ﬁrst\
    \ resources are easy to use but they are general\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731; doi:10.3390/s18061731\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n2 of 21\npurpose and, therefore,\
    \ not adapted to the speciﬁc needs of each farmer. In this work an user-centred\n\
    method is proposed to design intelligent and adapted services where each farmer\
    \ decides its own\ninstallation using edge and fog paradigms (distributed computing)\
    \ on Internet of Things technologies\n(Figure 1). This method is designed on different\
    \ use cases and tested in an automated greenhouse as\nan example of utility. The\
    \ work is an expanded version presented in [1]. This paper is organized as\nfollows:\
    \ Section 2 reviews precision agriculture scenarios, how to use centred design\
    \ methodologies,\nIoT technologies and their deployment, the capabilities and\
    \ potential of edge and fog computing\nparadigms in these scenarios. Different\
    \ greenhouses are analysed and farmers are consulted. Section 3\nproposes a method\
    \ to deploy distributed IoT architecture using edge and fog nodes that offer a\
    \ set\nof new resources that can be used in any type of installation which facilitates\
    \ the involvement of\nthe farmer. In Section 4, experiments including services\
    \ on edge and fog nodes, connected by IoT\ncommunication protocols, are performed.\
    \ Finally, Section 5 provides conclusions and future works.\nFigure 1. Agricultural\
    \ System.\n2. Related Works\nAlthough more complex deﬁnitions exist, the simple\
    \ description of the PA is a way to “apply the\nright treatment in the right place\
    \ at the right time” [2].\nPrecision agriculture comprises a set\nof technologies\
    \ that combine sensors, information systems, enhanced machinery and informed\n\
    management to optimize production by accounting for variability and uncertainties\
    \ within agricultural\nsystems. It is a farming management concept based upon\
    \ observing, measuring and responding to\ninter and intra-ﬁeld variability in\
    \ crops [3]. Methods and technologies to decide how, where and when\nto use sensors\
    \ and machinery should involve all the main actors: that is, farmers and information\n\
    and communication technicians. User-centred methods and IoT communication technologies\
    \ applied\non precision agriculture are revised in this section. Finally, different\
    \ greenhouses are analysed and\nfarmers are consulted.\n2.1. User-Centred Design\
    \ Models\nIn PA context, User-Centred Design (UCD) describe a design process where\
    \ farmers inﬂuence the\nprocess of how the design takes shape. There are several\
    \ ways in which the user (agricultural specialist)\ncan be involved in the process.\
    \ This term describes a set of methods to create models on which\ndesign adapted\
    \ solutions. The user-centred design process works against subjective assumptions\n\
    about user behaviour. It requires proof that the design decisions are effective.\
    \ If user-centred design is\nproperly done, applications becomes an outcome of\
    \ actively engaging users. Therefore, any design\ndecisions that were made by\
    \ observing and listening to them will not be based on personal preferences.\n\
    User experience (UX) is one of the many focuses of UCD. It includes the user’s\
    \ entire experience with\nthe product, including physical and emotional reactions.\
    \ UCD is objective and often relies on data\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n3 of 21\n\
    to support design decisions [4]. According to [5], user centred design is a development\
    \ method that\nguarantees that product, software or web site will be easy to use.\
    \ The International Usability Standard\n(ISO 13407) [6], speciﬁes the principles\
    \ that underlie user centred design:\n•\nRequirements gathering, understanding\
    \ and specifying the context of use\n•\nRequirements speciﬁcation, specifying\
    \ the user and organisational requirements\n•\nDesign, producing designs and prototypes\n\
    •\nEvaluation, carrying out user-based assessment of the site\nThe design is based\
    \ upon an explicit understanding of users, tasks and environments. Users are\n\
    involved throughout design and development. The process is iterative. The design\
    \ is driven and\nreﬁned by user-centred evaluation. The design addresses the whole\
    \ user experience. The design team\nincludes multidisciplinary skills and perspectives.\n\
    2.2. Internet of Things: Architectures and Protocols\nIot is developed using architectures\
    \ based on layers capable of connecting a huge number of\ndevices with each other\
    \ and with the established services. The basic model of IoT has a 3 layer\narchitecture\
    \ which are of Perception, Network and Application Layers. IoT faces several challenges,\n\
    especially in the ﬁeld of privacy and security, so to overcome these issues new\
    \ standard architectures\nneed to be more focused on many essential factors like\
    \ Quality of Services (QoS), data integrity,\nsustainability, conﬁdentiality,\
    \ etc. The IAB (Internet Architecture Board) has published the RFC\n7452 document:\
    \ Architectural Considerations in Smart Object Networking. This document offers\n\
    guidance to engineers designing Internet-connected smart objects. A Request for\
    \ Comments (RFC),\nin the context of Internet governance, is a type of publication\
    \ from the Internet Engineering Task Force\n(IETF) and the Internet Society (ISOC),\
    \ the principal technical development and standards-setting\nbodies for the Internet.\n\
    Table 1 illustrates different works that apply the layer model in the\nIoT architecture.\n\
    Table 1. IoT architecture: Layers.\nLayers Proposed\nCharacteristics\n3\nPerception,\
    \ Network, Application [7,8]\n4\nThings, Edge, Network, Application [9]\n5\nBusiness,\
    \ Application, Service, Object abstration, Objects [10]\nIoT needs protocols adapted\
    \ to the new requirements. Traditional protocols are extended and\nnew protocols\
    \ are proposed offering different options on different contexts. IoT has now a\
    \ wide\nrange of applications. A smart devices can have wired or wireless connection.\
    \ As far as the wireless\nIoT is the main concern, many different wireless communication\
    \ technologies and protocols can be\nused to connect the smart device such as\
    \ Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6), over Low power Wireless\nPersonal Area Networks\
    \ (6LoWPAN), ZigBee, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Z-Wave and Near Field\nCommunication\
    \ (NFC). They are short range standard network protocols, while SigFox and Cellular\n\
    are Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN).standard protocols. In [11] a review and\
    \ comparison of\ndifferent communication protocols in IoT is realised. This comparison\
    \ aims at presenting guidelines\nfor the researchers to be able to select the\
    \ right protocol for different applications. Table 2 illustrates\ndifferent protocols\
    \ used in the architecture layers.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n4 of 21\nTable 2.\
    \ IoT protocols.\nLayer\nProtocols\nSession/Application\nMQTT, CoAP, AMQT, HTTP,\

    WiFi, Bluetooth Low Energy, Z-Wave, ZigBee, LoraWan, IEEE 802.15.4, LTE, ...\n\
    Choosing the most appropriate protocol depends on several facts of which most\
    \ important are:\nenvironmental conditions, network characteristics, the amount\
    \ of data to be transferred, security levels\nand quality of service requests\
    \ [12]. CoAP network is primarily a one-to-one protocol for transferring\nstate\
    \ information between client and server while MQTT is a many-to-many communication\n\
    protocol for exchanging messages between multiple clients. CoAP runs over UDP\
    \ which means\nthat communication overhead is signiﬁcantly reduced. If constrained\
    \ communication and battery\nconsumption is not an issue, RESTful services can\
    \ be easily implemented and interact with the Internet\nusing the worldwide HTTP\
    \ [13]. If the targeted ﬁnal applications require massive updates of the same\n\
    value, MQTT protocol is more suitable. In this work different protocols (MQTT,\
    \ HTTP, Bluetooth, WiFi,\nLTE, ...) can be used to develop proposed architecture.\n\
    2.3. Internet of Things Technologies Applied on PA Scenarios\nAdvance in electronics,\
    \ computing and telecommunications are allowing the development of\nnew devices\
    \ (sensors, actuators and computing nodes) with wireless communication capabilities,\n\
    installed at any location, smaller, energy efﬁcient, autonomous, more powerful\
    \ and low cost [14–18].\nIoT works using user-driven service modeling is proposed\
    \ in [19]. Low-cost IoT devices that need\nto gather and transmit sensor data\
    \ and receive remote commands is shown in [20–22]. IoT uses the\nconnection between\
    \ devices to improve their efﬁciency and user experience, being the communication\n\
    one of the main elements for a proper IoT network. A review of the most common\
    \ wired and wireless\ncommunication protocols, discussion of their characteristics,\
    \ advantages and disadvantages as well as\na comparison study to choose the best\
    \ bidirectional sensor network composed by low power devices is\nrealised in [23].\
    \ Previous works show the degree of development of IoT technology, which has also\n\
    been experienced in precision agriculture in recent years.\nIoT technologies are\
    \ proposed in PA scenarios. In [24] this paradigm is analysed as a solution in\n\
    precision farming. IoT Smart farming application include farm parameters tracking,\
    \ monitoring, ﬁeld\nobservation and storage monitoring. The work Internet of Things\
    \ Platform for Smart Farming [25]\npresents a platform based on IoT technologies\
    \ that can automate the collection of environmental, soil,\nfertilisation, and\
    \ irrigation data; automatically correlate such data and ﬁlter-out invalid data\
    \ from\nthe perspective of assessing crop performance; and compute crop forecasts\
    \ and personalised crop\nrecommendations for any particular farm. This platform\
    \ (SmartFarmNet) can integrate virtually any\nIoT device, including commercially\
    \ available sensors, cameras, weather stations, etc., and store their\ndata in\
    \ the cloud for performance analysis and recommendations. An evaluation of the\
    \ SmartFarmNet\nplatform and the experiences and lessons learnt in developing\
    \ this system concludes the paper.\nSmartFarmNet is the ﬁrst and currently largest\
    \ system in the world (in terms of the number of\nsensors attached, crops assessed,\
    \ and users it supports) that provides crop performance analysis\nand recommendations.\n\
    In [9] a greenhouse with hydroponic crop production was designed, developed and\
    \ tested using\nUbiquitous Sensor Network monitoring and control on Internet of\
    \ Things paradigm. The experimental\nresults showed that the Internet technologies\
    \ and Smart Object Communication Patterns can be\ncombined to encourage development\
    \ of Precision Agriculture. They demonstrated added beneﬁts\n(cost, energy, smart\
    \ developing, acceptance by agricultural specialists) when a project is launched.\n\
    Other related work is shown in [26] with Zig Bee technology: Artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ and decision\nsupport approaches have been developed. This work develop technology\
    \ for real-time monitoring\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n5 of 21\nof citrus soil moisture\
    \ and nutrients and the research on the integration of fertilization and irrigation\n\
    decision support system. The results showed that the system could help the grower\
    \ to scientiﬁcally\nfertilize or irrigate, improve the precision operation level\
    \ of citrus production, reduce the cost and\nreduce the pollution caused by chemical\
    \ fertilizer. A review into the state-of-the-art of Big Data\napplications in\
    \ Smart Farming is performed in [27]. Malche et al. [28] proposed a prototype\
    \ IoT system\nfor water level monitoring which can be implemented in future smart\
    \ villages in India. Manufacturers\nof the agricultural sector highlights the\
    \ importance of IoT in [29–32]. PA is effectively a suite of\nmethods, approaches\
    \ and instrumentation that farmers should examine in detail to decide which is\n\
    the most suitable for their business.\n2.4. Internet of Things, Cloud and Machine\
    \ Learning Evolution: Edge and Fog Computing Paradigms\nInternet of Things (IoT)\
    \ aims to bring every object (e.g. smart cameras, environmental sensors,\ncontrol\
    \ appliances, machine learning analysis) on line, hence generating massive amounts\
    \ of data that\ncan overwhelm storage systems and data analytic applications.\
    \ Cloud computing offers services at\nthe infrastructure level that can scale\
    \ to IoT storage and processing requirements. However, there are\napplications\
    \ such as sensor monitoring, control and analysis response that require low latency\
    \ therefore,\ndelay caused by transferring data to the cloud and then back to\
    \ the application can seriously impact\ntheir performances. To overcome this limitation,\
    \ Fog and Edge computing paradigms have been\nproposed, where cloud services are\
    \ extended to the edge of the network to decrease the latency and\nnetwork congestion\
    \ [33]. Both fog computing and edge computing involve pushing intelligence and\n\
    processing capabilities down closer to where the data originates from pumps, motors,\
    \ sensors, relays,\netc. The key difference between the two architectures is exactly\
    \ where that intelligence and computing\npower is placed:\n•\nFog computing pushes\
    \ intelligence down to the local area network level, processing data in a fog\n\
    node or IoT gateway\n•\nEdge computing pushes the intelligence, processing power\
    \ and communication capabilities of an\nedge gateway or appliance directly into\
    \ devices like programmable automation controllers (PACs)\nWith IoT implementation\
    \ now becoming more widespread, devices will generate a lot of data at\nthe end\
    \ of the network and many applications will be deployed at the edge to process\
    \ the information.\nCisco Systems predicts that an estimated 50 billion devices\
    \ will connect to the Internet by 2020 [34–36].\nSome of the applications they\
    \ run might require very short response times, some might involve private\ndata,\
    \ and some might produce huge quantities of data. Cloud computing cannot support\
    \ these IoT\napplications. Edge and Fog computing paradigms, on the other hand,\
    \ can do so and will promote\nmany new IoT applications.\nThe work done in [37]\
    \ concludes that the wireless sensor and actuator networks based on Edge\ncomputing\
    \ are experiencing fast development and opportunities in the post-Cloud era, and\
    \ are used\nin more and more applications. In [38] a Fog Computing Based on radio\
    \ access networks is proposed\nfor smart-cities services.\n2.5. Automated Technologies\
    \ in Greenhouses\nDifferent greenhouses in the south east of Spain have been visited\
    \ to analyse the type of installation\nand to ask expert users. The greenhouse\
    \ with the highest level of automation showed a complete\nnumber of sensors and\
    \ actuators; however, not all the sensors could be related. There are two large\n\
    subsystems in self-assembled greenhouses that are not interoperable. These subsystems\
    \ install different\ntypes of control and technologies:\n•\nIrrigation and nutrition\n\
    •\nAir conditioning and ventilation.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n6 of 21\nIn these\
    \ facilities, an ambient temperature sensor of the air conditioning system is\
    \ not related to\nan irrigation water temperature sensor of the irrigation system.\
    \ Figure 2 shows different automated\ngreenhouses where main subsystems are listed.\n\
    Figure 2. Automated greenhouses: main subsystems in current facilities.\n3. User\
    \ Centred and Computing Method Model: Distributed Computing Architecture Based\
    \ on\nEdge and Fog Nodes\nThe current agricultural facilities are divided in subsystems\
    \ (irrigation, light, climate, soil, crop\nand energy) that are not interconnected.\
    \ Industrial logic programmable controllers and specialised\nsensors give basic\
    \ automation services in each subsystem. Internet and electronic devices (smartphones)\n\
    provide new functionalities based on information access, control and monitoring.\
    \ Human interfaces\non smartphones connected to web servers are examples of new\
    \ services developed over the past years.\nAgricultural technician and farmers\
    \ have knowledge that can be converted on expert rules for device\ncontrol. These\
    \ rules are programmed and implemented on actual programmable devices; however,\n\
    they are static rules which means that do not evolve when new conditions occur,\
    \ neither do they\nadapt to the singularities of each installation. The farmer\
    \ has to decide how to set the rules: what pH\nthe irrigation water must have,\
    \ how much water should be programmed in irrigation process, etc.\nAlso, each\
    \ rule only has effects in a subsystem (irrigation, climate), there is no interoperability.\n\
    Considering this context, new facilities design and development method are proposed\
    \ in this\nwork. The aim is that the farmer participates in the automated activities\
    \ and that the subsystems\nbecome interoperable. A method that implement automatic\
    \ rules and automate the decision making\nconsidering the behaviour of the installation\
    \ itself are also proposed. The phases of the proposed\nmodel are shown in Figure\
    \ 3.\n•\nAnalysis: two kind of users are identiﬁed in this phase (agriculture\
    \ user expert and ICT technician).\nExpert users in agriculture are interviewed\
    \ to deﬁne main processes to control. All these issues are\nrelated with ICT expert\
    \ in a participatory design. The results of this ﬁrst approach are the things\n\
    required to design services and control. In this phase an user-centred methodology\
    \ captures the\nfarmer requirements.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n7 of 21\n•\nDesign:\
    \ the model is based on an architecture with three levels: edge, fog and cloud\
    \ services.\nIn this phase an adapted architecture using these levels is designed.\
    \ The adapted architecture is\nshown in Figure 4.\n•\nIntegration and data analysis:\
    \ Installation and Integration subsystems are developed in this phase.\nData analysis\
    \ is proposed to design machine learning services based on expert rules with farmer.\n\
    •\nStart up, measure and feedback: Test and feedback are launched.\nThe ﬁrst expert\
    \ rules\nare integrated with farmer supervision.\nNew rules are designed with\
    \ feedback processes.\nAutomatic and adapted rules are developed using artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence systems with machine\nlearning platforms.\nFigure 3. User centred\

    Figure 4. Architecture: communication levels with different functionality.\nSensors\
    \ 2018, 18, 1731\n8 of 21\n3.1. User-Centred Analysis and Design\nThere are two\
    \ cases treated:\n•\nAgricultural installation with some automated facilities\
    \ already installed\n•\nNew agricultural installation\nThe method is the same\
    \ for both. Expert users in agriculture are interviewed to deﬁne new\nprocesses\
    \ to control. In this ﬁrst approach, the things (objects) required, their relationships\
    \ and the\npotential services are detected. Once objects and services have been\
    \ detected, they must be related\nto the necessary communication and control technologies\
    \ (IoT protocols). Human Interfacing are\nadjusted. Expert rules and intelligent\
    \ services are analysed (Edge and Fog computing proposal). Finally,\nthe installation,\
    \ maintenance and operation methods are designed. All this is designed between\
    \ user\nagricultural technician and information technologies expert.\nThe results\
    \ of this ﬁrst approach are the things required to design services and control.\
    \ A ﬁrst set\nof sensors, actuators, variables, processes and controllers are\
    \ designed considering production facility.\nThis set of objects will be considers\
    \ like things in the next stage.\nIn this description, a thing is formed by an\
    \ object/entity and a context with data associated.\nEach thing has a n-tuple\
    \ data structure (ID, time, date, location, relations, state) where ID, data,\n\
    location, relations with other things and states are deﬁned. Table 3 represents\
    \ different things.\nExpert users design control rules using the things deﬁned.\
    \ These control rules are part of control\nprocesses (climate, soil, irrigation,\
    \ crop, energy or image) that are distributed in different embedded\nsystems connected\
    \ to the network (intranet/internet). Things are a virtual representation of all\n\
    available resources that can be deployed in the different subsystems of the installation.\n\
    At this level all objects/things are recognized by designers. Basic control algorithms\
    \ of all\nsubsystems are designed.\nTable 3. Things context designed in smart\
    \ control processes.\nObject/Thing\nContext\nSensori\n(ID, time, date, location,\

    \ state)\n3.2. Integration: Architecture Development\nIn the previous phase objects\
    \ and their relationship with basic algorithms has been designed.\nAn architecture\
    \ adapted to the facility available is developed in this phase. Requirements are:\n\
    1.\nInterconnection and data access of all subsystems data\n2.\nFacilities and\
    \ resources to implement expert rules\n3.\nConﬁguration, operation and modiﬁcation\
    \ processes\nIoT and AI paradigms provide resources to propose an innovative architecture\
    \ that can be used in\nnew smart precision agriculture services. Edge computing\
    \ used on control devices and fog computing\nnodes installed on local network\
    \ provide powerful technologies to implement conﬁguration, operation\nand improvement\
    \ processes.\nIoT protocols provide resources to capture and communique all subsystems\
    \ data. Each subsystem\nis composed by objects/things (sensor/actuator) that can\
    \ be connected and processed using nodes on\nsensor networks with IoT protocols.\
    \ The requirements established for PA scenarios are:\n•\nStandard and interoperable\
    \ communication protocols to develop open and reusable applications.\nSensors\
    \ 2018, 18, 1731\n9 of 21\n•\nLow-power consumption of all devices installed improve\
    \ the establishment and development.\n•\nEasy access and maintenance. Users are\
    \ not specialized in information technologies. It is important\nto improve its\
    \ acceptability.\n•\nSupport the integration of new smart modules (modularity\
    \ and scalability software and hardware).\n•\nNon-proprietary hardware-software\
    \ to reduce dependencies.\n•\nLow cost devices selection increases the level of\
    \ penetration.\nIoT protocols are designed to work on communication scenarios\
    \ and requirements established.\nThey are optimised for control and two-way open\
    \ communication channels. In these works [39–41]\nMessage Queuing Telemetry Transport\
    \ (MQTT) protocol is proposed as communication paradigm\nbetween sensors, actuators,\
    \ communication nodes, devices and subsystems. Some of the features that\nmakes\
    \ it especially suitable for this project are:\n•\nMQTT is a publish-subscribe\
    \ messaging protocol developed for resource-constrained devices [42],\na model\
    \ already in use by enterprises worldwide, and can work with legacy systems.\n\
    •\nAll messages have a topic path composed of words separated by slashes. A common\
    \ form is\n/place/device-type/device-id/measurement-type/status. The subscribers\
    \ may use wild-cards to\nsubscribe to all measurements coming from a speciﬁc class\
    \ of device.\n•\nThe bandwidth requirements are extremely low, and the nature\
    \ of the protocol makes it\nvery energy-efﬁcient.\n•\nThe programming interface\
    \ is very simple, and the client memory footprint is small, making it\nespecially\
    \ suitable for embedded devices.\n•\nThree Quality of Service (QoS) levels provide\
    \ reliable operations [43].\nUbiquitous networks allow an n-to-m nodes communication\
    \ model. Any node is able to query\nand be queried by other nodes. In addition,\
    \ any node may play the role of a base station (skin node)\ncapable of transmitting\
    \ its information to remote processing places using a gateway device. USN local\n\
    nodes can use and process local data, with a gateway these nodes have a global\
    \ accessibility and\nthey offer extended services on an IoT scenario.\nLocal and\
    \ global access over the same node\n(sensor/device/actuator) has different possibilities\
    \ and beneﬁts. Whereas a local data processing\nis necessary in basic process\
    \ control (security, system start-stop, etc.), global processing (analytic)\n\
    can be used in pattern detection and information generation. In this sense, the\
    \ proposed platform\nuses both technologies combined: different USN over a local\
    \ network area (intranet) connected to\ncloud-IoT services (internet). A computing\
    \ layer in local area, called edge computing, will serve as\ninterface between\
    \ control processes and cloud-services. This layer will be able to process data\
    \ before\ncommunicating to cloud.\n3.3. Data Analysis: Edge and Fog Computing\
    \ Conﬁguration\nThe development of edge and fog computing can be understood in\
    \ three phases:\n•\nConnection: Numerous heterogeneous, real time connections\
    \ between terminals and devices\nwill serve edge computing, as will automatic\
    \ network deployment and operation. Additionally,\nsecurity, reliability, and\
    \ interoperability of connections should be guaranteed. An application of\nthis\
    \ phase is remote automatic soil parameters and ambient conditions data reading\n\
    •\nData treatment on edge computing devices: In this phase, data analysis and\
    \ automatic services\ndevelop new capabilities that are implemented on the new\
    \ edge nodes. Applications of this\nphase can be data ﬁltering, predictive calculation\
    \ of climatic data, classiﬁcation services or\ndetection events\n•\nServices on\
    \ fog computing nodes: Enabled by technologies such as AI and IoT communication\n\
    protocols. Fog computing nodes carries out smart analysis and computing, as well\
    \ as implementing\ndynamic, real-time self-optimization, and executing policy\
    \ adjustments. Applications of this phase\nare prediction of water consumption,\
    \ smart detection or unattended production\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n10 of 21\n\
    Figure 5 shows the architecture implemented using edge and fog nodes. When automated\n\
    subsystems are already installed it is necessary to interleaved embedded devices\
    \ (edge-nodes) between\ncontrollers and sensors/actuators. This devices maintain\
    \ the initial services and allow to initiate\na supervised learning process. New\
    \ algorithms are tested and approved on edge and fog nodes.\nIn Figure 6 different\
    \ services are proposed on each node.\nFigure 5. Architecture proposed on facilities\
    \ already automated: edge nodes interleaved between\ndevices already installed\
    \ and fog nodes that interconnect all subsystems.\nFigure 6. Architecture implemented:\
    \ services proposed.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n11 of 21\n3.4. Test and Feedback\
    \ Developing\nIn machine learning systems the output is not ﬁxed. It will change\
    \ over time as the solution\nknows more and as the model on which the machine\
    \ learning system is built evolves as it is fed more\ndata. This forces the testing\
    \ professional to think differently and adopt test strategies that are very\n\
    different from traditional testing techniques. To test machine learning systems\
    \ is essential:\n1.\nObtaining data sets: This refers to a data set with main\
    \ variables captured and stored to analyse\nand design the model. In irrigation\
    \ process data set are: irrigation programming used (time and\nﬂow), ambient conditions\
    \ (humidity, temperature) and soil conditions (humidity, temperature,\npH and\
    \ conductivity) captured by sensors. All this data are monitored and stored.\n\
    2.\nTraining data sets: This refers to a data set used for training the model.\
    \ It is a subset of the\nprevious dataset. In irrigation process training data\
    \ set are: irrigation programming automated\nby the model (time and ﬂow decision)\
    \ considering ambient conditions (soil, ambient and crop).\nThis data is usually\
    \ prepared by collecting data in a semi-automated way. The results of this\nprocess\
    \ are validated with agronomists.\n3.\nTesting data sets: It is a dataset used\
    \ to to measure the model quality.\n4.\nValidation test suites on real scenarios.\
    \ Taking the irrigation example, test scenarios include\ncategorizing needs of\
    \ water for a kind of crop considering climatic conditions and its growth\nphase.\
    \ Automated irrigation decisions by the model are analysed in this phase.\n5.\n\
    Building validation suites. It is necessary to understand the algorithm. The model\
    \ has algorithm\nthat analyse the data provided, looks for speciﬁc patterns, and\
    \ uses the results of this analysis\nto develop optimal parameters for creating\
    \ the model. The model is reﬁned as the number of\niterations and the richness\
    \ of the data increase.\n6.\nCommunicating test results in statistical terms.\
    \ Models based on machine learning algorithms\nwill produce approximations and\
    \ not exact results. Quality of results must be analysed in the\nsame context.\
    \ The testing community will need to determine the level of conﬁdence within a\n\
    certain range.\n7.\nModel evolution. Support to develop new AI services or modiﬁcations\
    \ on algorithms\nimplemented. Supervised and automatic changes are processes to\
    \ maintain the operating models.\n3.5. Comparison with Industrial Facilities.\
    \ Novelty Elements Proposed\nCurrently, industrial facilities that use PA technologies\
    \ are based on integration of internet and web\nservices with automation and control\
    \ using industrial technology. Proprietary systems are designed for\nmonitoring\
    \ large production plants. Related work analysed show that the Agriculture Control\
    \ system\nfor production, irrigation, or climate proposes different monitoring\
    \ and control technologies, based on\nwireless sensor network and industrial control.\
    \ Monitoring systems analyse crop environment and the\nmethod to improve the decision\
    \ making by analysing statistics and reactive algorithms. This work\nproposes\
    \ two main novelty elements: optimization of architecture levels integration of\
    \ edge and fog\nlayers and proposes the integration the farmer in the design of\
    \ new improvements using data analysis\nobtained with the new architecture developed.\n\
    4. Experimental Work\nDifferent agricultural facilities have been analysed to\
    \ introduce the method proposed. Three kind\nof installations summarize the different\
    \ types:\n•\nInstallation automated but subsystems not interoperable\n•\nPartial\
    \ automation without any interconnection and non-interoperable systems\n•\nManual\
    \ control\nIn all of them, the services based on AI are not yet installed. In\
    \ this context, the method proposed\nusing edge-computing on basic controllers\
    \ and fog-computing on gateway nodes can design common\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n\
    12 of 21\nservices for the three types of facilities cited. With this conﬁguration,\
    \ subsystems interoperability and\nAI support are achieved. Control signals of\
    \ already installed controllers in automated installations\nbecome inputs to edge\
    \ nodes and a fog node which acts as an interface for all facility nodes. In all\n\
    greenhouses, irrigation and internal environment control are basic processes.\
    \ Agronomist users know\nhow to program reactive controls and how to conﬁgure\
    \ automated devices. Optimization of these\nresources (water, energy) are two\
    \ potential services that agronomist perform through their experience.\nThis knowledge\
    \ can be transferred to intelligent systems that integrate it through techniques\
    \ based on\nAI paradigms. Interconnection of subsystems also are one of the proposed\
    \ improvement. A deployment\nfor an automated installation is designed and implemented.\
    \ This case shows how to implement\nwhen there are already automated installations.\
    \ This case also serves as a guide for other types of\ngreenhouse installations.\n\
    4.1. Analysis\nThe farmer, together with the technician in information technologies,\
    \ propose a set\nof improvements:\n•\nMonitoring and control interfaces on the\
    \ Internet (control and communication services)\n•\nEvent and change communication\
    \ service (communication services)\n•\nInterconnection of irrigation and air conditioning\
    \ subsystems (interoperability services)\n•\nIntegration of automation to optimize\
    \ water consumption (AI services)\nThe work carried out designs an installation\
    \ that deploy the necessary hardware and software\nresources using the proposed\
    \ method Figure (Figure 7) shows agricultural subsystems and model\ndeployed on\
    \ distributed nodes.\nFigure 7. Greenhouse design. Fog and edge nodes relations\
    \ on agriculture subsystems.\nIntelligent irrigation control is installed in an\
    \ experimental greenhouse based on tomato\nhydroponic cultivation (Table 4). Following\
    \ the proposed method, the experimental phases are:\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n\

    \ Communication and Context\nIrrigation process, soil parameters, environmental\
    \ conditions inside and outside the greenhouse\nand energy consumption deﬁne objects\
    \ and context. Sensors, actuators and processes and their\nrelationship (context)\
    \ are shown in Table 5. Context vector are (ID, time, date, GH1, relations, state)\
    \ for\neach object/thing, where GH1 is the location ID of greenhouse.\nAll objects\
    \ are interoperable using MQTT protocol. Publisher and subscriber communication\n\
    model that implement this protocol allows interconnect all devices and things.\
    \ Broker device are\ninstalled on fog node. Publishers and subscribers are implemented\
    \ on different nodes.\n4.3. Hardware Devices and Software Modules\nTwo edge nodes\
    \ and one fog node are proposed to control climate and irrigation processes.\n\
    Objects (things) and processes are deployed on all nodes. Irrigation and climate\
    \ control are installed\nin edge nodes, AI services are implemented in fog node.\
    \ Process control architecture is used in\nthe ﬁrst node type (edge) and data-centred\
    \ architecture is used in the second node type (fog) and\nin the cloud services\
    \ implemented. In edge node the ﬂow of data comes from a set of variables\n(things\
    \ and internal variables) which control the processes execution. Agronomist and\
    \ expert users\ndesigns basic control algorithms. After learning and training\
    \ process, these algorithms will be adjusted\nand modiﬁed following the results\
    \ of the expert system (machine learning). The aim is to optimize\nresources (water,\
    \ energy) without losing productivity. Two main control processes are executed\
    \ in\ntwo edge nodes and one machine learning process is implemented in a fog\
    \ node. Table 5 shows these\nprocesses and their relationship. Algorithms are\
    \ implemented in Python and developed using open\nsource criteria. Minimal hardware\
    \ embedded devices requirements are shown in Table 6.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n\

    \ and Testing\nIn facilities already automated, edge nodes are interleaved between\
    \ the installed controllers\nand actual sensors and actuators. Some new sensors\
    \ are installed to complete services designed\n(energy meter). In current facilities\
    \ edge nodes are deployed and allows:\n•\nWork in the same way as before (initial\
    \ learning stage, analysis and model selection).\n•\nChange to a new control using\
    \ new expert and automatic rules using AI processes (supervised stage\nand training)\n\
    •\nTest and reconﬁgure expert rules (testing and maintenance)\nFigure 8 shows\
    \ an edge node to irrigation control and how is deployed in the experimental\n\
    greenhouse built in this work, without previous installation. Agronomists and\
    \ farmers preferences are\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n15 of 21\nthose that drive\
    \ the design: interfaces, maintain and optimize control processes. In irrigation\
    \ process a\ntime schedule with the selected flow rate is programmed by the user\
    \ according to the period of crop\ngrowth. In learning stage, edge node captures\
    \ the data and sends it to the fog node. Fog node process\ndiary water uses, ambient\
    \ and soil conditions, type of crop and its growth. Using these data crop\ntype\
    \ is classified. Crop production results are added as data to analyse it together\
    \ with the stored ones.\nProduction, water consumption, crop growing stage, time,\
    \ date, soil parameters, current weather, forecast\nweather and ambient green\
    \ house conditions are captured as inputs to machine learning platform.\n(a) Hardware\
    \ device\n(b) Software processes\nFigure 8. Hardware and software deployed on\
    \ experimental greenhouse edge node.\nIn future crop productions the irrigation\
    \ schedule can be automated, first with human supervision\nand then automated.\
    \ Biophysical variables (plant, soil, canal flow, and weather conditions) that\
    \ are\nmeasured during the growing seasons are used as inputs to build the models.\
    \ Information about\ncrop phenology (growth stages), soil moisture, and weather\
    \ variables will be compiled. The analysis\nof irrigation decisions is important\
    \ because this can help in the estimation of short-term irrigation\ndemands. If\
    \ the automated process decisions are known, It can help canal operators to better\
    \ manage\nwater deliveries and avoid unexpected delays and operational conditions\
    \ that increase canal losses.\nInformation about these demands can also be helpful\
    \ for the evaluation of expected future agricultural\nsupplies. It can never be\
    \ possible to know the exact reasons why a farmer decided to irrigate, all farmers\n\
    are different and prefer their own decision processes. Data analysis with farmer\
    \ in in its own installation\ninfer automated farmer actions. This data is used\
    \ to build the models and these learnt frameworks will\nbe used to predict irrigation\
    \ decisions. The specific objectives planned with farmer are:\n1.\nIdentify the\
    \ main variables contributing to an irrigation behaviour by training the models\
    \ with\nrelevant data\n2.\nGroup the irrigation decisions into distinct classes\n\
    3.\nIdentify the decisions taken\n4.\nDetect the patterns in farmer decisions\n\
    5.\nInfer future irrigation decisions using the information and modelling tools.\

    only by a time schedule. Now, it takes into account data sensors to decide if\

    In this work the state-of-the-art of PA and IoT technologies in agricultural scenarios,\
    \ have been\nanalysed. PA presents difﬁculties to be implemented by farmers. These\
    \ include cultural perception,\nlack of local technical expertise, infrastructure\
    \ constraints, knowledge and technical gaps and high\nstart-up costs. Farmers\
    \ must be involved in the design and integration of these technologies in their\n\
    facilities. To carry out this solution there must be methods to facilitate such\
    \ integration. This work\nproposes a new method to integrate the farmer in the\
    \ development of new solutions using low cost\nsensing technologies and innovative\
    \ communication paradigms. An architecture based on two new\nlevels of communication\
    \ and processing nodes (edge and fog nodes) form the technological core\nof the\
    \ proposed method. Each level performs a set of interconnected functionalities.\
    \ The proposed\ninfrastructure can be installed either in already automated installations\
    \ or in the design of new facilities.\nIn the already automated installations,\
    \ the method introduces new possibilities for the development of\nintelligent\
    \ and interconnected control. An experimental work has been carried out in a greenhouse.\n\
    In this work, communication nodes have been installed and a new service based\
    \ on a decision tree\nparadigm has been designed by expert user. The facilities\
    \ that use the proposed model make the\nclimate control and irrigation subsystems\
    \ interoperable and allow the farmer to design new integrated\ncontrol rules.\
    \ The new distributed communication model allows the farmer to analyse changes\
    \ and\nimprovements. This experimental work initiates a new methodology of work\
    \ for the farmer who can\nuse these new technologies more easily. Future control\
    \ rules and services using a machine learning\nplatform and AI paradigms will\
    \ allow to optimize and improve the results.\nAuthor Contributions: F.J.F.-P.\

    \a\nAbstract: The growing need for food worldwide requires the development of\
    \ a high-performance,\nhigh-productivity, and sustainable agriculture, which implies\
    \ the introduction of new technologies\ninto monitoring activities related to\
    \ control and decision-making. In this regard, this paper presents\na hierarchical\
    \ structure based on the collaboration between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)\n\
    and federated wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for crop monitoring in precision\
    \ agriculture.\nThe integration of UAVs with intelligent, ground WSNs, and IoT\
    \ proved to be a robust and\neﬃcient solution for data collection, control, analysis,\
    \ and decisions in such specialized applications.\nKey advantages lay in online\
    \ data collection and relaying to a central monitoring point, while\neﬀectively\
    \ managing network load and latency through optimized UAV trajectories and in\
    \ situ\ndata processing. Two important aspects of the collaboration were considered:\
    \ designing the UAV\ntrajectories for eﬃcient data collection and implementing\
    \ eﬀective data processing algorithms\n(consensus and symbolic aggregate approximation)\
    \ at the network level for the transmission of the\nrelevant data. The experiments\
    \ were carried out at a Romanian research institute where diﬀerent\ncrops and\
    \ methods are developed. The results demonstrate that the collaborative UAV–WSN–IoT\n\
    approach increases the performances in both precision agriculture and ecological\
    \ agriculture.\nKeywords: unmanned aerial vehicles; wireless sensor networks;\
    \ intelligent data processing; trajectory\nplanning; relevant data extraction;\
    \ data consensus; Internet of Things; precision agriculture\n1. Introduction\n\
    The need for high-performance, high-productivity, and sustainable agriculture\
    \ results from the\nrapid growth of the human population. This requires permanent\
    \ monitoring and intelligent processing\nof the measured data collected from the\
    \ ﬁeld, correlated with the weather forecasts, to produce\nagronomic recommendations.\
    \ In the last few years, new technologies in agriculture, and especially in\n\
    precision agriculture (PA), have been leveraged for increased productivity and\
    \ eﬃcient input dosage [1].\nMost importantly, in PA, farmers need to know exact\
    \ and timely details about crop status. These details\nabout certain parameters,\
    \ obtained by measurements both from the ground and in the air, constitute\ninput\
    \ data to specialized systems of process management in the PA. Some relevant examples\
    \ might\ninclude for example, irrigation control, pesticide dosage, pest control,\
    \ etc. For acquisition and complex\nprocessing of the collected data, integration\
    \ of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) with wireless sensor\nnetworks (WSN) under\
    \ novel frameworks, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), has been shown to\n\
    contribute to increases in agricultural yields [2]. Such advanced systems are\
    \ modeled as well-speciﬁed\nSensors 2020, 20, 817; doi:10.3390/s20030817\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 817\n2 of 25\nagent-based solutions with sensors and UAVs. Although\
    \ the contributions of UAVs and WSNs, taken\nseparately, are well documented and\
    \ important in the sustainable growth of agricultural production,\nthe integration\
    \ of these components together within an IoT framework is expected to signiﬁcantly\n\
    improve the solutions for monitoring, production modeling, prediction, and decision-making.\n\
    Relevant applications of UAV–WSN systems are presented in Reference [3–6]. In\
    \ viticulture,\nas a special type of PA, the soil and air parameters modify grape\
    \ yield and quality. For this purpose,\na solution based on the collaborative\
    \ system mini UAV (quadrotor type)–WSNs to monitor parameters,\nlike temperature\
    \ and humidity, to prevent the frost in fragmented vineyards is proposed in Reference\
    \ [3].\nThe UAV is considered as communication relay between sensors and a base\
    \ station. A real application\nfor monitoring sensitive parameters in vineyards\
    \ with both agro-meteorological stations and UAV\nplatforms is presented in Reference\
    \ [4]. In order to obtain a precise monitoring of the speciﬁc indicators,\nthe\
    \ data from the ground are correlated with the data collected by a UAV platform\
    \ with 8 rotors\nprovided with a professional thermal camera. The study was conducted\
    \ over a period of two years.\nFor data acquisition on large areas, a ﬁxed wing\
    \ type UAV, used as data mule from the ground WSN,\nis proposed in Reference [5].\
    \ In addition, the UAV has attached an high deﬁnition (HD) camera for the\ndetection\
    \ of certain plant diseases. Experimentally, a small tank has been added to spray\
    \ diﬀerent\ninsecticides, fertilizers, herbicides, etc. Both UAV and WSN are low\
    \ cost and not robust for only\ndemonstration purposes. In addition, in Reference\
    \ [6], a low cost agro-meteorological monitoring\nsystem in a vineyard was designed\
    \ and developed. The optimal positioning of the sensors was made\nwith the help\
    \ of the multispectral image analysis, acquired by UAV.\nGiven recent evolutions\
    \ in UAV technologies, cost reduction, and new regulations of aviation\nauthorities\
    \ regarding the usage and deployment of such systems (e.g., European Aviation\
    \ Safety\nAgency (EASA) [7] and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) [8]), such\
    \ aerial robotic platforms\nare increasingly used in agriculture for diﬀerent\
    \ tasks, the most important being crop monitoring [9].\nAccording to EASA, the\
    \ UAVs should be safely integrated into the existing aviation context in a\nproportionate\
    \ way [7]. For large scale applications, in which UAVs are ﬂying beyond line-of-sight,\n\
    compliance with strict regulatory frameworks is essential.\nAdoption of a UAV-based\
    \ solution for image acquisition in agriculture applications is more\ncost eﬀective\
    \ and ﬂexible in comparison with satellite or manned aircraft alternatives [10].\
    \ Both\nﬁxed- wing [11,12] and rotary-wing type [3,13] UAVs are frequently used\
    \ in various applications in\nagriculture, while accounting for the risk of crashes\
    \ [9] and potential damages. Equipped with speciﬁc\nsensors in modular payloads\
    \ [14], such as high resolution RGB [15], infrared, multispectral [16,17],\nthermal\
    \ cameras [18,19], and also LIDAR [10], UAVs are able to create precise maps of\
    \ crop state or\nevolution [17], health plant assessment [20], diseases [21],\
    \ soil characteristics, evaluate losses caused\nby ﬂoods [11], etc. In the crop\
    \ monitoring, the following characteristics are analyzed from UAV\nimages [9]:\
    \ the crop water stress, deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the canopy and the air\
    \ temperature,\nthe photochemical reﬂectance index, and the vegetation indices.\n\
    Although UAVs with diﬀerent propulsion systems are now available, most applications\
    \ in PA\nuse UAVs driven by electric motors due to their compact size, reduced\
    \ maintenance and operational\ncosts and, not the least, their alignment with\
    \ the current regulatory context and tendencies towards the\nreduction of global\
    \ carbon emissions [22].\nThe small-scale data acquisition by the WSN helps farmers\
    \ to take actions like crop irrigation,\nfertilizer usages, deciding on the optimum\
    \ stages of sowing, and harvesting [23]. Moreover, WSNs\nemployed in PA lead to\
    \ large amounts of data. Thus, data collection by WSNs is an important\ncontribution\
    \ to the development of farm management information systems (FMIS) [24,25].\n\
    The WSN has multiple functions at the ﬁeld level: data acquisition of various\
    \ parameters\n(e.g., temperature in soil and air, humidity in soil and air, solar\
    \ radiance, soil nutrients, the presence of\npests and weeds, chlorophyll content\
    \ in plants, etc.), distributed processing of data by establishing\nconsensus—if\
    \ it is the case, establishing the relevant data and its storage, low level data\
    \ fusion, and\ndata transmission. New sensor node designs oﬀer reduced costs [26];\
    \ see, for example, the detailed list\nSensors 2020, 20, 817\n3 of 25\nof sensors\
    \ used in PA given in Reference [10]. As in many other large-area monitoring applications,\n\
    for communication or local processing reasons, the sensors are grouped into sensor\
    \ networks, the\ncommunication being made by radio. A WSN network will include\
    \ measurement nodes (sensory\nnodes) and data collection, processing, and transmission\
    \ nodes (sink or cluster head).\nRegarding PA, there is no rigorous theory of\
    \ sensor placement because it depends on the\nparticularities of the soil and\
    \ the weather. Sensor groups need to comply broadly with the need for\nsensory\
    \ and communication coverage. In Reference [27], two examples of sensor location\
    \ topologies\nare given: grid and random. From the point of view of communication\
    \ with the sink node, the most\nused are the star and mesh topologies. The wireless\
    \ communication protocols used in WSN for PA are\nthe following [10]: 6LoWPAN,\
    \ ZigBee (both being the most suitable for the mesh topology), LoRaWAN,\nGSM,\
    \ BLE, and Wi-Fi.\nIn PA, WSNs are used, most often, for parameter monitoring,\
    \ but they can also be integrated into\ncontrol systems as sensors. Direct speciﬁc\
    \ applications of WSN in control systems for PA are the energy\neﬃcient automated\
    \ control of irrigation [28] and smart automated fertilization [29].\nThe performance\
    \ of the crop monitoring can be improved by UAV–WSN collaboration [30].\nThe collaborative\
    \ aspects in an integrated UAV (aerial agents)–WSN (ground agents) architecture\
    \ for\ndiﬀerent applications was recently presented in a review paper [22], where\
    \ the diﬀerent functional\ncomponents of the system and how they collaborate with\
    \ each other was highlighted. In Reference [31],\nthe authors presented an integrated\
    \ UAV–WSN–IoT system, named FarmBeats, which is an end-to-end\nplatform for data\
    \ collection from various sensors, cameras, and drones in agricultural applications.\n\
    An unlicensed TV White Spaces is used to setup a high bandwidth link from the\
    \ farmer’s home to an\nIoT ground station at a distance for collecting data from\
    \ UAVs and WSNs.\nIn order to interconnect the UAVs and terrestrial WSNs into\
    \ hybrid networks and, at the same\ntime, to ensure a safe airspace sharing with\
    \ aircrafts, multiple organizations are contributing [22]:\nInternational Civil\
    \ Aviation Organization, EASA, Joint Authorities for Rulemaking on Unmanned\n\
    Systems, International Telecommunications Union, etc. Satellite connection is\
    \ required for two reasons.\nOne-way communication, such as obtaining the GPS\
    \ location of the UAVs or the sensory nodes (if any)\nis one reason. The second\
    \ reason is a possible data transmission or remote control (via two-way\nsatellite-intermediated\
    \ internet).\nIn Reference [32], the authors discuss the information system design\
    \ supporting agriculture\ndata management. Enabling advanced data processing in\
    \ the form of sensor fusion and clustering\nmechanisms for improved network topologies\
    \ in generic applications has been discussed [30]. Eﬀective\ndata gathering mechanisms\
    \ [33] and higher level IoT architectures [34] are key and current topics\nof\
    \ interest.\nWe believe that the challenges of UAV–WSN–IoT integrated systems\
    \ can come from several\ndirections: (a) precise localization of the ground sensors\
    \ with the aid of a preliminary ﬂight; (b) sensor\nstates periodically inspected\
    \ by UAV; (c) establishing of the WSNs as sensor clusters able to cover, both\n\
    from the sensorial and from the communication point of view the monitored area;\
    \ (d) establishing\nthe cluster heads (CH), named base stations, of the WSNs able\
    \ to communicate data to UAVs;\n(e) transmitting commands to change the strategy\
    \ and parameters of the sensor networks, (f) data\nacquisition from WSNs through\
    \ UAVs, (g) special trajectory planning and tracking, (h) the aggregation\nof\
    \ information collected by the UAV with the information collected by WSN for the\
    \ purpose of\nmeasuring and interpreting the parameters with increased accuracy,\
    \ (i) remote control via Internet,\nand (j) edge and cloud computing.\nIn a hierarchical\
    \ structure, the data processing architecture of the integrated system is based\
    \ on\nthree levels: consensus, edge computing [35], and cloud computing.\nFor\
    \ the main activity, the data collection from CH, UAV must have a predeﬁned trajectory,\
    \ properly\ndesigned, and accounting for the following limitations:\n•\nWaypoint\
    \ passing: a UAV has to pass above the CH to extract the relevant data from that\
    \ area\n(covered by the corresponding WSN sub-network);\nSensors 2020, 20, 817\n\
    4 of 25\n•\nObstacle avoidance: UAVs avoid obstructions or prohibited areas along\
    \ the ﬂight plan;\n•\nGuaranteed communication: to ensure that the data has been\
    \ fully collected, enough time has to\nbe spent in the CH neighborhood;\n•\nEﬃciency:\
    \ reduce at a minimum the energy consumption for that trajectory (consider the\
    \ length\nof the trajectory and its complexity).\nThe integration of UAV–WSN based\
    \ systems for PA in IoT is a mandatory step to create an\nadvanced FMIS [25].\n\
    Due to the integration, the system can become “smart” by using elements of artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence\nlike self-adaptation and decision, optimal trajectory, data transmission\
    \ of relevant parameter values,\nenergy eﬃciency, and neural networks for data\
    \ and image processing. Not in the least, the sensors must\nbe placed optimally,\
    \ considering the terrain characteristics. Battery life is an important design\
    \ point\nof the ground sensor algorithms by reducing to a minimum the number of\
    \ wireless communications\nneeded to transfer the information. The radio interface\
    \ is the critical factor in increasing battery life.\nBased on the frequency of\
    \ the data collection and radio transmissions the nodes can have a battery\nlifetime\
    \ ranging from several months up to one year. Therefore, the intelligent collaboration\
    \ between\nUAV and WSN can lead to optimization of parameters, such as energy\
    \ consumption, sensing coverage,\nrisk, data acquisition, and processing time\
    \ [36]. To this end, bio-inspired optimization heuristics and\ngenetic algorithms\
    \ were applied to the aforementioned agents.\nThe optimal WSN coverage by the\
    \ aid of UAV platforms is implemented in Reference [37] as an\noptimization problem,\
    \ formulated by means of the travelling salesman problem, in order to ﬁnd the\n\
    best path of the UAV for data collection with minimum energy consumption.\nUsing\
    \ UAV as data mule for multi WSNs is an energy-eﬃcient method to increase the\
    \ networks’\nlife. To this end, the authors in Reference [38] apply the successive\
    \ convex optimization technique.\nThe proposed system presents the following integration\
    \ aspects:\n-\nGroup the sensors in clusters and determine the cluster heads,\
    \ the methodology proposed by the\nauthors in Reference [30];\n-\nPath planning\
    \ based on speciﬁc conditions for eﬃcient data collection; and\n-\nIntelligent\
    \ data collection and processing.\nThe main contributions consist in the following:\
    \ (i) implementation of a multilevel, collaborative\nUAV–WSN system structure\
    \ for agriculture applications, (ii) a speciﬁc path planning for ﬁxed\nwing–type\
    \ UAV with the purpose of robust and eﬃcient data collection, (iii) obtaining\
    \ relevant data\nfrom sensors for the purpose of saving energy, and (iv) edge–fog–cloud\
    \ computing algorithms for\nsubsequent data processing. Thus, the main challenge\
    \ is related to improving data extraction and\ncommunication in large scale heterogeneous\
    \ monitoring system. The key problem is focused on\nimproving the performance\
    \ of such systems through better algorithms and synchronization among the\ntwo\
    \ subsystems: the ground sensor network and the robotic aerial platforms, implemented\
    \ as UAVs,\nfor data collection and relaying.\nThe rest of the paper is structured\
    \ as follows. Section 2 describes the concept, the methodology,\nand key aspects\
    \ that have been addressed for the proper design and implementation of the system.\n\
    Section 3 presents the experimental results and performances after implementing\
    \ the system on an\nexperimental farm. Section 4 highlights the conclusions, as\
    \ well as future work.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Requirements for Integrated\
    \ UAV-WSN-IoT Systems\nFor the design of reliable and robust large-scale monitoring\
    \ system the requirements have to\nﬁrst be validated. The main challenges for\
    \ such collaborative systems were considered to be: sensing\ncoverage in accordance\
    \ to mission objectives, communication coverage by the hybrid UAV–WSN\nsystem\
    \ using various types of radio links, from low-power, low-data rate to high throughput\
    \ long\nSensors 2020, 20, 817\n5 of 25\ndistance for streaming, energy eﬃciency,\
    \ and, not in the least, computing eﬃciency. The decentralized\narchitecture for\
    \ crop ﬁeld monitoring described in this paper is designed to overcome the challenges\n\
    mentioned above and to account for the data generation patterns at the ﬁeld level.\
    \ While the proposed\ndata fusion mechanisms and processing of centralized in-ﬁeld\
    \ data at CH level manage to reduce data\nvolume and ensure the ﬂow of information\
    \ up to the level of events, an additional intermediate level is\nappended to\
    \ the data stream, in order to reach the server. To this end, we consider both\
    \ mobile agents\n(UAV) and multiple ﬁxed agents (ground sensors (SNs)). The system\
    \ diagram is presented in Figure 1.\nThe mobile agent can perform the following\
    \ functions: data mulling, image acquisition, relay, and\nstate inspection of\
    \ WSNs. The ﬁxed agents acquire data from the ﬁeld (agricultural ﬁeld—soil and\
    \ air),\nprocess data locally (relevant data extraction, data consensus), and\
    \ ﬁnally transmit data to the UAV by\nmeans of CHs. The system is composed of\
    \ four main processing levels (Table 1): Sensor level, Fog\nComputing level, Internet/Cloud\
    \ Computing level, and Data Management and Interpretation level.\nThis is a multi-WSN–UAV\
    \ structure with higher level integration in internet-based systems for decision\n\
    support. The data from WSNs are collected by a UAV, transmitted at a ground control\
    \ station (GCS),\nand, from here via the internet, to the Data Interpretation\
    \ module. Analytics functionality ranges from\nbasic statistical indicators to\
    \ trend and event detectors and up to basic statistical learning models that\n\
    have the ability to anticipate evolutions in the monitored ground phenomena.\n\
    Another important requirement of the integrated system is the correlated or complementary\n\
    interpretation of the data from the sensory agents, either mobile or ﬁxed. For\
    \ example, when the soil\nmoisture is too high, the soil sensors show the maximum\
    \ value and cannot discern whether a ﬂood has\noccurred. This can be accurately\
    \ determined from aerial images taken by the UAV. In addition, the\ndegree of\
    \ humidity in plants and the degree of foliage development can be observed either\
    \ from the\nground or from the air (images), and a more precise determination\
    \ results from the fusion of the two\ndata sets.\nOther types of similar systems\
    \ were surveyed and can include the use of swarms of multi-copter\ntype UAVs,\
    \ which oﬀer better positioning accuracy for data collection while trading oﬀ\
    \ energy eﬃciency\nand autonomy. Ground sensor network implementation can also\
    \ be a diﬀerentiating factor with two\nmain approaches: random deployment of sensor\
    \ nodes in the area of interest, according to a minimum\nexpected sensing coverage\
    \ density, or deterministic, grid-like placement. Intermediate data processing\n\
    steps from the ﬁeld level to the decision level are commonly accepted as an important\
    \ mechanism to\nbalance network loads and improve communication latency.\nSensors\

    \ must be considered. The ﬁrst is the trajectory planning\nfor collecting data\
    \ from sensors (CHs), and it must take into account certain requirements, such\
    \ as\nthe complete and safe acquisition of data, on one hand, and minimize energy\
    \ and time consumption,\non the other hand [39].\nUnder certain reasonable assumptions\
    \ (known environment, known limitations), the UAV tasks\nreduce to computing a\
    \ trajectory which respects constraints and minimizes a cost (length, total energy\n\
    consumption, etc.), while simultaneously respecting various constraints (internal\
    \ dynamics, stall\nvelocity constraints or exogenous ones, those imposed by the\
    \ environment, such as obstacle avoidance\nand waypoint passing through).\nThe\
    \ particularity lies in the fact that many of the UAV-speciﬁc constraints are\
    \ non-convex [40],\ne.g., the variable of interest z (depending of time t) has\
    \ to stay outside some bound (e.g., outside of\nan interdicted region and/or maintain\
    \ a minimal velocity). If z(t) is the UAV position, the velocity\nrestrictions\
    \ are usually written as follows:\nv ≤\n\f\f\f\n\f\f\f\n.z(t)\n\f\f\f\n\f\f\f\
    \ ≤ v.\n(1)\nBoth bounds (lower—v and upper—v) may depend on a variety of factors.\
    \ Hard constraints are\nimposed by the UAV physics: upper bound given by the engine\
    \ characteristics and lower bound by\nthe requirement to avoid stall. Note that\
    \ this work neglects the inﬂuence of wind: velocity is usually\nmeasured against\
    \ the ground (e.g., through a GPS), but, in fact, the UAV “feels” the addition\
    \ of its own\nand of the wind velocities. This may lead to an unexpected stall\
    \ or, at least, improper behavior. Usual\ntechniques are to provide more conservative\
    \ bounds in Equation (1) and to restrict the ﬂight to normal\nweather conditions.\n\
    Waypoints are introduced, in a practical mission, because data has to be gathered\
    \ from a cluster\nnode. Thus, the question of minimum communication time arises\
    \ [41]: It is necessary to remain in a\nspeciﬁc neighborhood for a deﬁned time\
    \ interval ∆ti. To correctly describe such a constraint, we require\na tuple (ωi,\
    \ ∆ti, ri , Ri), where ωi is the corresponding cluster node position (the center\
    \ of the circle in\nFigure 2), and ri and Ri are, respectively, the minimum and\
    \ the maximum radius of the permitted\ncommunication area. Because there are perturbations\
    \ due to trajectory control errors or other causes,\nthe real trajectory is included\
    \ in a ﬂight lane (Figure 2a). The ﬂight lane was experimentally established\n\
    at 30 m, under reasonable assumptions about wind speed. The trajectory z(t) has\
    \ to stay near the\nwaypoint for a least amount of time ∆ti determined by the\
    \ quantity of data which has to be transferred:\nri ≤\n\f\f\f\n\f\f\fωi − z(t)\n\
    \f\f\f\n\f\f\f ≤ Ri, t ∈ [ti, ti + ∆ti].\n(2)\ncondition (2) is often impractical\
    \ to check due to the continuous nature of z(t) and because of the\nvarying time\
    \ interval [ti, ti + ∆ti]. The usual approach is to sample the constraint and\
    \ to estimate the\npath length by assuming the bounds (1) on the velocity. To\
    \ this end, we consider:\n\f\f\f\f\n\f\f\f\fz\n\x10\nti\n\x11\n− ωi\n\f\f\f\f\n\
    \f\f\f\f = ri,\n(3)\nwith ti given such that ti ∈ [ti, ti + ∆ti]) holds; it is\
    \ important that a waypoint is reached, not when.\nSensors 2020, 20, 817\n7 of\
    \ 25\nNote that the shortest distance for a trajectory checking (4) is the straight\
    \ line shown in Figure 2a,\nwhose length is 2\nq\nR2\ni − r2\ni . In other words,\
    \ a suﬃcient condition for guaranteeing that the minimal\ntime ∆ti has passed\
    \ is to ensure that\n∆ti ≥\n2\nq\nR2\ni − r2\ni\nv\n.\n(4)\nCondition (4) provides\
    \ a lower bound for the time the UAV stays between the inner and outer\ncircles\
    \ (i.e., how much time it spends inside waypoint’s ωi communication range). Then,\
    \ inserting (3) in\na trajectory design procedure implicitly guarantees enough\
    \ communication time. This approach may\nbe insuﬃcient for a couple of reasons.\
    \ First, the desired communication time may not be known at the\ntrajectory generation\
    \ time and thus could not be compared with ∆ti. Second, the communication time\n\
    is known to be larger than ∆ti and a “tangential” pass (like the one enforced\
    \ by (3)) does not suﬃce.\nThe method (detailed below) is to enter a loitering\
    \ mode to increase arbitrarily the data-gathering\ntime [42]. Making the reasonable\
    \ assumption that the loitering rl\ni radius respects the condition\nri < rl\n\
    i < Ri, means that the UAV can orbit the waypoint ωi for an indeﬁnite period of\
    \ time [43]. From\nthe viewpoint of trajectory generation, the only relevant question\
    \ remains the places at which the\nUAV inserts/dislodges onto/from the loitering\
    \ circle. Both of these points are decided by the relative\nposition of the current\
    \ waypoint with respect to the previous and next waypoints in the sequence\n(such\
    \ as to reduce unnecessary inﬂexions in the trajectory). The switch between normal\
    \ and loitering\nmodes will be done at pre-determined points: the trajectory enters\
    \ loitering mode at a point ω−\ni and\ndislodges from it at a point ω+\ni (which\
    \ lie on the loitering circle and are from/towards the direction\nof the previous/next\
    \ waypoint). Thus, when the UAV decides to ﬁnish the communication, it will\n\
    continue to orbit the loitering circle until it reaches the dislodging point ω+\n\
    i . Here, it will switch back\nto the normal trajectory mode.\nThe inner (dotted\
    \ line), outer (solid line) communication circles, and loitering circle (dashed\
    \ line)\nare illustrated in Figure 2b. We show a trajectory inserting to the loitering\
    \ circle, tracking an arc of\nit, and, lastly, dislodging from the circle to re-enter\
    \ its normal mode (line tracking). The UAV could\nhave orbited the loitering circle\
    \ repeatedly and dislodged from it at ω+\ni when desired. As is mentioned\nabove,\
    \ the trajectory describes a corridor (we account for the inherent tracking error\
    \ appearing under\nrealistic conditions).\nSensors 2020, 20, x FOR PEER REVIEW\

    \ of the algorithm are:\n▶\nThe UAV has two modes of functioning, loiter mode\
    \ and segment tracking mode, which are\ndecided by the supervisor (in the sense\
    \ that within the collection of waypoints a priori computed,\nsome of them are\
    \ labeled as loiter points).\n▶\nIn both cases, the algorithm provides a heading\
    \ which is the reference to be tracked by the\nUAV. This is in line with standard\
    \ practices, where the heading is decided through some design\nprocedure and the\
    \ velocity and pitch and roll angles are decided at the auto-pilot level (usually\n\
    the velocity is maintained constant and the roll and pitch are taken as needed\
    \ between admissible\nbounds).\n▶\nThe decisions taken by the algorithm and supervisor\
    \ are, ultimately, related to the distance\nbetween the current position and some\
    \ point of interest. To do so, we consider some circles of\ninterest, deﬁned as\
    \ follows:\n#\nCommunication circle: the UAV communicates with the ground-based\
    \ cluster head only\nwhen it is within the communication radius.\n#\nWaypoint\
    \ update circle: it is impractical to assume that the UAV passes through the exact\n\
    coordinates of the current waypoint. Thus, we update the active segment (by advancing\n\
    through the list of waypoints) whenever we are close enough to the end-point of\
    \ the\ncurrent segment.\n#\nLoitering circle: whenever the UAV is required to\
    \ spend a signiﬁcant time in communication\nwith the current cluster head, the\
    \ decision to start loitering is taken. The loitering radius is\nrestricted to\
    \ be less than the communication radius and larger than the physical limitations\n\
    imposed by the roll angle bounds (a tighter circle means a larger roll angle).\n\
    #\nProximity circle: the procedure employed in the algorithm takes (whenever there\
    \ is\nintersection between the circle and the current segment) the heading angle\
    \ in the direction\nof the intersection point (the one closest to the end-point\
    \ of the segment).\n▶\nWhen the last waypoint is covered, the UAV returns to base\
    \ (by default, we consider this to be\nthe initial point on the trajectory).\n\
    Without being exhaustive, some of the most relevant updates in the algorithm are:\n\
    In segment tracking mode:\n1.\nAt the current time, we consider the UAV position\
    \ (x,y), the segment determined by the current\n(CP) and next waypoint (CP + 1):\n\
    \x10\nwi\nx, wi\ny\n\x11\n,\n\x10\nwi+1\nx\n, wi+1\ny\n\x11\n.\n2.\nWe compute\
    \ the projection of the current point onto the current segment (PP). We identify\
    \ three\npossible cases by checking the relative position of the projection wrt\
    \ the segment’s end points\n(described by W): inside the segment (0 ≤ W ≤ 1)),\
    \ outside and located before the initial segment\nend (W < 0); outside and located\
    \ after the initial segment end (W > 1);\n3.\nWe compute the distance (D) from\
    \ the current point to the segment and the circle of radius L\n(proportional with\
    \ the UAV velocity) and further used to compute the heading vector.\n4.\nWe consider\
    \ the following cases:\ni.\nThe UAV is too far away, and the projection point\
    \ lies before the segment start point. Then,\nthe heading angle points towards\
    \ the projection point.\nii.\nThe UAV is suﬃciently close, and the projection\
    \ point lies before the segment start point.\nThen, the heading angle points towards\
    \ the start point.\niii.\nThe UAV is suﬃciently close to the segment end point,\
    \ or its projection onto the segment\nlies after the end point. Then, the current\
    \ segment is updated, and the procedure jumps to\nstep 4i.\nSensors 2020, 20,\
    \ 817\n10 of 25\niv.\nThe UAV is too far away, and its projection lies onto the\
    \ interior of the segment. Then,\nthe heading vector points towards the projection.\n\
    v.\nThe UAV is suﬃciently close, and its projection lies onto the interior of\
    \ the segment.\nThe heading angle is taken as the vector of length L in which\
    \ the tip lies on the segment\n(there are two possible tips; the one closer to\
    \ the segment end point is considered).\n5.\nGo to step 1.\nIn the loitering mode:\n\
    1.\nSelect the loitering center as the current waypoint.\n2.\nConstruct the circle\
    \ of radius L and centered in the current position of the UAV.\n3.\nIf the circle\
    \ does not intersect the loitering circle, move towards the projection point situated\
    \ on\nthe loitering circle.\n4.\nIf the proximity circle intersects the loitering\
    \ circle, take the heading vector along the tangent at\nthe intersection point\
    \ between loitering circle and proximity circle (there are two solutions, we\n\
    selected depending on the desired loitering rotation—clockwise or counterclockwise).\n\
    Note that all steps where a decision regarding the trajectory update is taken\
    \ consist in fact in a\ndecision about the UAV’s heading. Thus, for trajectory\
    \ tracking, only the heading angle is used as\ncontrol input. This suﬃces for\
    \ relatively simple trajectories and is robust against wind disturbances\n(as\
    \ later shown in the simulations).\n2.3. Relevant Data Extraction\nThe collected\
    \ data is hierarchically processed from the ground level, cluster head level,\
    \ UAV level\nup to the cloud. Alongside these steps, information is gradually\
    \ extracted through various methods\nthat enable local decisions based on the\
    \ conﬁguration of the system (thresholding, consensus, symbolic\naggregate approximation,\
    \ etc.).\nIn-ﬁeld data processing is ensured both at local level (independent\
    \ data ﬁltering) and decentralized\nat network level (through data exchange between\
    \ neighbor sensory nodes). The proposed data\nprocessing mechanisms, tailored\
    \ for in-ﬁeld level, are designed in order to ensure a substantial\nweighted average.\
    \ This step is found as ‘Enable consensus dialog’. Once the convergence is reached,\n\
    each node performs a routine for results analysis basically seeking to discover\
    \ and mark nodes with\ndivergent values. This information remains available alongside\
    \ the consensus value so that it can be\ninterrogated by the higher level of data\
    \ processing if needed. This is found in Figure 4 as ‘Analyze\nresults step’.\n\
    Aggregated data sets are achieved through diﬀerent methods. All seek for relevant\
    \ data points,\naiming to a reduced size set and providing at the same time a\
    \ satisfying reconstruction of the initial\ndata. The proposed method for data\
    \ aggregation is based on the minimum and maximum values\nextraction, computed\
    \ as global extremes for a predeﬁned period of time (e.g., a day). It is obvious\
    \ that\nthis method is suitable only for measurements that have a periodic behavior,\
    \ with smooth variations\nduring the day. A measurement for which this method\
    \ is suitable is the soil temperature. Conversely,\nchange detection is commonly\
    \ used for irregularly-shaped data sets. This method follows extraction of\nlocal\
    \ extreme points where trend changes occur.\nGiven a set of data points (xi, yi),\
    \ i = 1, . . . , n, trend ti is computed for each sequence\nmeasurements such\
    \ that for a measure m, (5),(6),(7) has to be true. If ti , ti+1, then it means\
    \ that a trend\nchange has occurred, and the data point (xi, yi) is added to the\
    \ relevant data set.\nxm\ni+1 − xm\ni > δm ⇒ tm\ni = 1,\n(5)\nxm\ni+1 − xm\ni\

    3.3. Data Processing Results \nAs previously discussed, the primary local distributed agreement is based on consensus among \n\
    the  clustered  sensing  nodes.  This  allows  the  nodes  to  have  a  unitary \
    \ representation  of  the \nmeasurements, under the assumption of limited variance in the geographical sensing area for one \n\
    cluster. The parameters that are sampled by the nodes include: air temperature, relative humidity, \n\
    soil temperature, soil moisture, and solar radiation.   \nFigure 18 illustrates the consensus results for two parameters: soil moisture and air temperature \n\
    in a cluster of five TelosB sensor nodes. These are obtained through simulation in a Contiki/COOJA \n\
    network environment starting from ground‐collected values. The main insight provided by this result \n\
    is  in  the  analysis  of  the  convergence  time  and  convergence  values  in \
    \ conjunction  with  fixed  or \ndynamic  tuning  parameters.  More  specifically, \
    \ by  adjusting  the  communication  frequency  and \nweighting the consensus algorithm based on the sensor location and confidence levels, we can guide \n\
    the algorithm with expert knowledge. This can result in acceleration of the process or in more reliable \n\

    Keywords: Internet of things; protected agriculture; integrated application; state-of-the-art\n\
    1. Introduction\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) was ﬁrst developed in 1999 by the\
    \ network radio frequency\nidentiﬁcation (RFID) system proposed by the Massachusetts\
    \ Institute of Technology (MIT) Auto-ID\nLabs [1]. With the application and development\
    \ of new information technologies, the connotation\nand extension of IoT have\
    \ undergone major changes [2]. IoT can be deﬁned as a huge internet-based\nnetwork\
    \ connecting physical and virtual “things” with standard and interoperable communication\n\
    protocols. To be speciﬁc, everything, such as a sensor and an actuator possessing\
    \ unique identity\nand attribute, exchange messages and communicate with each\
    \ other to realize intelligent positioning,\ntracking, identiﬁcation, perception,\
    \ monitoring and management via kinds of networks anytime and\nanywhere [3]. IoT\
    \ has penetrated pervasively most aspects of human life everywhere such as health\n\
    care, smart home, smart city, industrial control and so on. Agriculture is an\
    \ ideal candidate for the\ndeployment of IoT solutions because it occurs in wide\
    \ areas that need to be continuously monitored\nand controlled [4,5].\nThe concept\
    \ of protected agriculture is relative to open-ﬁeld agriculture. It uses artiﬁcial\
    \ techniques\nto change climatic factors such as natural light, temperature and\
    \ humidity to create environmental\nconditions suitable for the growth of animals\
    \ and plants, enabling them to grow around the clock.\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833;\
    \ doi:10.3390/s19081833\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n\
    2 of 24\nThe environment of protected agriculture is completely or largely artiﬁcially\
    \ controlled andwhich has\nbroken the limits of climate and land conditions for\
    \ the growth of animals and plants to a certain extent.\nSo it is also called\
    \ controllable agriculture. Compared with open-ﬁeld agriculture, protected agriculture\n\
    has more potential to apply IoT technology, because it is less aﬀected by climatic\
    \ and geographical\nfactors. Some mature IoT solutions in other ﬁelds can be transferred\
    \ directly to protected agriculture [6].\nWith the development of agricultural\
    \ sensor, wireless communication, cloud computing,\nmachine learning and Big Data\
    \ technologies, IoT technology has emerged and is gradually being\npromoted and\
    \ applied in the protected agriculture ﬁeld [7–9]. It is playing an important\
    \ role in various\nareas of protected agriculture as it is capable of helping\
    \ farmers monitor soil condition, climate change\nand animal and plant health\
    \ [10]. When the environmental factor change beyond the set threshold,\nIoT will\
    \ automatically send a warning message to the administrator to remove the hidden\
    \ danger.\nIt can also control environmental factors such as temperature, humidity,\
    \ carbon dioxide concentration\nand illumination according to the condition of\
    \ crop growth in real time [11,12]. In addition, cameras in\nthe IoT system are\
    \ able to capture crop diseases and insect pests in the greenhouse in real time,\n\
    helping farmers ﬁnd problems and take targeted preventive measures [13]. Through\
    \ GPS, RFID and\nother location-based sensors, goods such as vegetables can be\
    \ tracked and monitored visually during\ntransportation and storage. Supermarket\
    \ managers use smart phone or PC to monitor and predict\nproduct status and the\
    \ demand for getting product on shelves. At the user or consumer end, people can\n\
    query the variety, origin, processing and other farm product information by means\
    \ of the QR code,\nbarcode, etc. IoT for protected agriculture can help create\
    \ an informed, connected, developed and\nadaptable rural community. Low-cost embedded\
    \ devices can improve the interaction between humans\nand the physical world.\
    \ Cloud computing, edge computing, and Big Data can provide valuable analysis\n\
    and support for decisions. In summary, IoT will become an important tool in the\
    \ next few years to\nengage people in embedded agriculture which includes suppliers,\
    \ farmers, technicians, distributors,\nmerchants, consumers and government representatives\
    \ [14,15].\nOn the basis of the potential of IoT applications in protected agriculture\
    \ described in the previous\nparagraphs, this paper aims to identify the current\
    \ state of solutions in these ﬁelds. The IoT fundamental\nstructure in protected\
    \ agriculture is introduced in detail based on agricultural sensors, wireless\
    \ sensor\nnetworks, cloud computing, edge clouding and machine learning technologies.\
    \ The application of IoT\nin protected agriculture and how it makes contributions\
    \ is displayed. Furthermore, the open issues,\nchallenges, future opportunities\
    \ and development trends are discussed.\nIn this article, a comprehensive and\
    \ profound review of IoT in protected agriculture has been\nexecuted based on\
    \ a survey of real-world deployments and published papers over the past 10 years.\n\
    Firstly, a keyword-based search for conference papers and articles was performed\
    \ mainly from the\nscientiﬁc databases IEEE Xplore, Science Direct and ACM Digital\
    \ as well as from Google Scholar.\nFor search keywords, we used the following\
    \ query: “Internet of Things” and either “greenhouse”\nor “livestock” or “aquaculture“\
    \ or “agriculture“. Then, we ﬁltered out papers referring to IoT but\nnot applied\
    \ to the protected agricultural domain. Finally, we checked these papers selected\
    \ from the\nprevious step and picked out the ﬁnal papers according to the problem\
    \ they addressed, the solution\nproposed, impact achieved (if measurable), tools,\
    \ systems and algorithms used.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows.\
    \ Section 2 presents the structure of IoT in protected\nagriculture. The key technologies\
    \ of IoT in protected agriculture are introduced in Section 3. The three\nimportant\
    \ applications in protected agriculture are summed up in Section 4. We further\
    \ discussed\nthe challenges to be faced and the problems that need to be solved\
    \ for IoT in protected agriculture as\nwell as a few future development directions\
    \ in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 outlines the conclusions of\nthis paper.\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 1833\n3 of 24\n2. The Structure of IoT in Protected Agriculture\n\
    2.1. Simple Review of Previous IoT Structure\nAt present, there is no uniﬁed opinion\
    \ on the structure of IoT. The composition of IoT can be\ndivided into three parts:\
    \ object end, cloud end and network end. Smart items, smart devices and\nlocal\
    \ intelligent systems interact directly with the physical world to form the “object\
    \ end” of IoT\n(also known as “front end”). The cloud computing platform that\
    \ provides computing, storage and\nother resources performs fusion processing\
    \ and intelligent analysis of the sensing data from the object\nend and performs\
    \ execution control to constitute the “cloud end” (also referred to as “back end”)\
    \ of\nIoT. The communication infrastructure of the connection object end and the\
    \ cloud end constitutes the\n“network end” of IoT. According to the diﬀerent functions\
    \ implemented by physical entity services\nin the IoT, IoT architecture established\
    \ by the current service-oriented approach can be divided into\nthe following\
    \ two categories: cloud-centric IoT architecture and object-centric IoT architecture.\
    \ In the\ncloud-centric IoT application system, the physical entity service implements\
    \ basic physical information\ncollection, local information processing and transmission\
    \ of information to the cloud, but does not\nprovide a directly accessible service\
    \ interface. Mass storage, relational processing and knowledge\nmining of physical\
    \ information are all implemented in the cloud. One of their typical representatives\n\
    is uID IoT architecture, which is an IoT architecture developed by the uID center\
    \ of the nonproﬁt\nstandardization organization initiated by the university of\
    \ Tokyo, Japan. As shown in Figure 1,\nits architecture consisted of ucode tags\
    \ such as RFID, bar codes, RF and IR beacons, user terminals,\na ucode resolution\
    \ server and application information servers [16]. For software developers, the\
    \ main\nchallenge in building such systems is how to build a back-end cloud service\
    \ platform that supports\nmassive item information management and data processing.\
    \ The cloud platforms that have been\nestablished so far mainly include Xively\
    \ and Aneka [17].\nSensors 2018, 18, x FOR PEER REVIEW  \n3 of 25 \n \n2. The\

    \ of the sensing data from the \nobject end and performs execution control to\
    \ constitute the “cloud end” (also referred to as “back \nend”) of IoT. The communication\
    \ infrastructure of the connection object end and the cloud end \nconstitutes\
    \ the “network end” of IoT. According to the different functions implemented by\
    \ physical \nentity services in the IoT, IoT architecture established by the current\
    \ service-oriented approach can \nbe divided into the following two categories:\
    \ cloud-centric IoT architecture and object-centric IoT \narchitecture. In the\
    \ cloud-centric IoT application system, the physical entity service implements\
    \ \nbasic physical information collection, local information processing and transmission\
    \ of information \nto the cloud, but does not provide a directly accessible service\
    \ interface. Mass storage, relational \nprocessing and knowledge mining of physical\
    \ information are all implemented in the cloud. One of \ntheir typical representatives\
    \ is uID IoT architecture, which is an IoT architecture developed by the \nuID\
    \ center of the nonprofit standardization organization initiated by the university\
    \ of Tokyo, Japan. \nAs shown in Figure 1, its architecture consisted of ucode\
    \ tags such as RFID, bar codes, RF and IR \nbeacons, user terminals, a ucode resolution\
    \ server and application information servers [16]. For \nsoftware developers,\
    \ the main challenge in building such systems is how to build a back-end cloud\

    \ years, under the impetus of organizations such as Internet Protocol for Smart\
    \ Objects \n(IPSO) Alliance, resource-constrained intelligent goods and sensing\
    \ nodes can access the internet \nthrough the IP protocol and become devices that\
    \ can be directly addressed in the network space \n[18]. Based on the service-oriented\
    \ design method, researchers have proposed a variety of software \narchitecture\

    \ \nentity service and proposed a 3-layer information physical fusion system software\
    \ architecture \nconsisting of the environment layer, the service layer and the\
    \ control layer. As shown in Figure 3, \nthe physical components in the environment\
    \ layer were services provided by the perceptron and \nthe executor. The cloud\
    \ service components in the service layer were services provided by \nplatforms\
    \ such as traditional cloud computing. As well, the following functions were implemented\
    \ \nin the control layer: monitoring physical components and services, ensuring\
    \ dynamic \ncomposability, ensuring service adaptability; and ensuring autonomous\
    \ Cyber-Physical System \nmanagement [20]. This architecture provides services\
    \ for collecting physical data and interacting \nwith the physical world. However,\
    \ these services do not constitute an independent executable IoT \nsystembut needto\
    \ be called by the user or combined with the cloud service to complete the \n\
    execution of related tasks. \n \nFigure 3. 3-Tiers IoT framework [20]. \nIoT-A\

    \ described \nbelow: \n(1). Perception layer: This layer consists of various sensors,\
    \ terminal devices, agricultural \nmachinery, wireless sensor network (WSN), RFID\

    \ Crucial Technologies of IoT in Protected Agriculture\n3.1. Sensor Technology\n\
    Sensor plays an indispensable role in obtaining environment, plant and animal\
    \ information and it\nis also one of the technical bottlenecks in the development\
    \ of IoT. In recent years, sensor technology\nhas rapidly developed with the emergence\
    \ of new materials and methods [23]. The conventional\nenvironment sensors such\
    \ as temperature, humidity, light intensity, heat and gas sensors have been\n\
    relatively mature and widely deployed in protected agriculture. Nowaday, about\
    \ 6000 research and\nproduction organizations engage in sensor research from more\
    \ than 40 countries, including famous\nmanufacturers such as Honeywell, Foxboro,\
    \ ENDEVCO, Bell & Howell and Solartron companies.\nThere are three main types\
    \ of widely used and researched agricultural sensors: physical property type\n\
    sensors, biosensors and micro electro mechanical system sensors (MEMS). The physical\
    \ property type\nsensor realizes the signal conversion through the physical change\
    \ of the sensitivity of the material\nof the sensor itself, which is mainly temperature,\
    \ humidity and gas sensor. The biosensor [24] uses\nthe organism itself as a sensitive\
    \ component to transmit information according to the reaction of the\norganism\
    \ to the outside world and includes enzyme sensor [25], microbial sensor, adaptive\
    \ sensor [26],\netc., which is mainly used to detect pesticide residue, heavy\
    \ metal ion, antibiotic residue and toxic\ngas [27,28]. The MEMS sensor is the\
    \ embodiment of the new generation of research and development\ntechnology in\
    \ the ﬁeld of sensors with small size, low power consumption, low cost and reliability\
    \ [29].\nAlthough sensor technology has made great strides in both principles\
    \ and manufacturing\nprocesses, there are still some open issues. A typical example\
    \ among those open issue is the research\nand development of soil sensors and\
    \ vital sign information sensors of animal and plant, which is an\nurgent conundrum\
    \ to overcome in long time. The complex composition as well as diﬀerent physical\n\
    and chemical properties of soil turn the rapid and situ measurement of soil nitrogen\
    \ and other elements\ninto an international diﬃculty. Since the life process of\
    \ animals and plants is very complicated, in order\nto realize the accurate detection\
    \ of information about their life, it is necessary to make breakthroughs in\n\
    the physical mechanism and measurement model of the life process. Related research\
    \ has been carried\nout using physicochemical properties, spectroscopy, multispectral,\
    \ hyper-spectral, nuclear magnetic\nresonance as well as other detection methods\
    \ [30–33].\nAnother problem is the promotion and application of these sensors.\
    \ For one thing there is still\na lack of uniform technical standards in the collection,\
    \ transmission and the interface with the platform\nand human-computer interaction\
    \ interface; for another, the cost has limited the large scale application\nof\
    \ fresh sensors in intelligent agriculture. Currently, the cost of sensing equipment\
    \ for the collection and\ntransmission of animal and plant status is prohibitively\
    \ expensive for ordinary peasants. The number\nof nodes in a sensor network can\
    \ often reach tens of thousands. To make the sensor network practical,\nthe cost\
    \ of each node must be controlled within $1, but now the price is as high as $80\
    \ [34].\n3.2. Data Transmission Technology\nIn this section, the details of data\
    \ transmission technology are discussed, which is one of the vital\ntechnologies\
    \ for real-time dynamic acquisition of agricultural information. Diﬀerent from\
    \ industrial\napplication, agricultural information acquisition is not demanding\
    \ in timelines and a slight delay in\nthe transmission process has little eﬀect\
    \ on agricultural production.\nCompared with wired transmission technology such\
    \ as ﬁeldbus, wireless communication\ntechnology has advantages of low construction\
    \ and maintenance cost, low power consumption\nand excellent extensibility. Recently,\
    \ most researchers, organizations and manufacturers choose it\nto build up their\
    \ WSN in environment monitoring [35,36], automatic irrigation [37] and remote\n\
    control [38]. As shown in Table 1, the summary of popular wireless technologies\
    \ and basic parameters\nwas presented. Diﬀerent vendors and research institutes\
    \ have developed their own wireless devices\nbased on these wireless protocols,\
    \ which has somewhat increased the heterogeneity of IoT. In addition,\nwireless\
    \ signals of diﬀerent protocols located in the same band can cause mutual interference\
    \ such as\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n8 of 24\nZigBee, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth [39].\
    \ Wi-Fi has high communication speed but high power consumption,\nwhich is suitable\
    \ for sensor network deployment at ﬁxed points. Although Bluetooth has high security,\n\
    its communication distance is too short and power consumption is high, which is\
    \ suitable for short-time\nclose-range networking. ZigBee has the advantages of\
    \ low consumption, low cost and self-organization\nand each node can be used as\
    \ a relay station for transmitting data of adjacent nodes. So it easily expands\n\
    the coverage of the sensor network and is an ideal long-distance, large-range\
    \ sensor networking.\nTable 1. Summary of popular wireless technologies and basic\

    \ mW\nIn recent years, the Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) is one of IoT hotspots\
    \ and\nthought as a novel technology with great development potential, which is\
    \ attributed to its huge\nadvantages such as ultra-long distance communication\
    \ and it can be used as an important complement\nof the traditional wireless local\
    \ area network (WLAN) and mobile cellular mobile communication\ntechnologies (such\
    \ as GSM and GPRS). At this stage, LPWAN has many technical standards, which can\n\
    be classiﬁed into two categories. The ﬁrst is a proprietary patented technology\
    \ that works under\nan unlicensed spectrum, such as LoRa, Sigfox and RPMA. The\
    \ second is a cellular communication\ntechnology that works under a licensed spectrum,\
    \ such as EC-GSM, eMTC and NB-IoT. Due to the use\nof dedicated frequency bands\
    \ and uniﬁed deployment by operators, licensed spectrum technology\nhas carrier-class\
    \ security and low interference characteristics, which forms full network coverage\n\
    and operation [40,41]. The unlicensed spectrum uses the common spectrum without\
    \ paying high\nspectrum costs but requires special handling of co-channel interference.\
    \ There are many beneﬁts of IoT\ndeployments based on LPWAN in the agricultural\
    \ environment. Firstly, the maximum connection\ndistance of the LPWAN terminal\
    \ device to the base station varies from several kilometers to several tens\n\
    of kilometers, which saves the trouble of setting up and maintaining routing devices.\
    \ Compared with\nthe 2.4 GHz band, LPWAN adopts the sub-1GHz band to acquire less\
    \ attenuation and multipath\nfading caused by obstacles and dense surfaces like\
    \ concrete walls [42,43]. Moverover, the sensitivity\nof state of the art LPWAN\
    \ receivers reaches as low as –130 dBm due to modulation techniques such\nas narrowband\
    \ and spread spectrum. Secondly, ultra low power operation is another advantage\
    \ of\nLPWAN which is achieved by duty cycling mechanism, lightweight medium access\
    \ control protocols\nand oﬄoading complex tasks [44]. Thirdly, most LPWAN technologies\
    \ support a large number of\ndevice connections by diversity techniques, adaptive\
    \ channel selection and data rate technologies,\netc. [45]. Finally, the LPWAN\
    \ connects a large number of end devices, while keeping the cost of\nhardware\
    \ below ﬁve dollars [46]. LPWAN technologies target a diverse set of applications\
    \ with varying\nrequirements in protected agriculture and therefore it should\
    \ provide some sort of quality of service\n(QoS) over the same underlying LPWAN\
    \ technology. However, current LPWAN technologies provide\nno or limited QoS.\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 1833\n9 of 24\nMeanwhile, mobile cellular communication technology\
    \ has undergone four generations of\ntechnology updates and the ﬁfth-generation\
    \ mobile communication technology (5G) was announced in\n2016, which will make\
    \ large ﬁle transfer such as agricultural images and audio a reality and bring\
    \ new\nimpetus to the agricultural IoT. From the perspective of future research,\
    \ the research of wireless sensor\nnetworks focuses mainly on communication, energy\
    \ conservation, network control and its application\nin agricultural monitoring.\n\
    3.3. WSN\nThe WSN consists of a lot of sensor nodes that are usually powered by\
    \ battery and it is a multi-hop\nself-organizing network system formed by wireless\
    \ communication to collaboratively sense, collect and\nprocess various information\
    \ of the perceived object in the network coverage area [47,48]. It can be\ndivided\
    \ into terrestrial WSN and wireless underground sensor networks (WUSN). The agricultural\n\
    sensors are usually planted into soil and lower frequency wireless technologies\
    \ are more selected\ndue to low attenuation in WUSN. Besides, antenna size and\
    \ energy consumption in WUSN is higher\nthan terrestrial WSN [49]. With development\
    \ of LPWAN, IoT may not need a mesh-style WSN with\npower-based routing, where\
    \ one node forwards packets of other nodes.\n3.4. Cloud Computing\nCloud computing\
    \ grew out of distributed computing, parallel processing and grid computing.\n\
    It is an Internet-based computing system that provides hardware services, infrastructure\
    \ services,\nplatform services, software services and storage services to various\
    \ IoT applications. Its essence is\na system for dynamically deploying and allocating/redistributing\
    \ as well as dynamic monitoring\nof virtualized computing and storage resource\
    \ pools, thereby providing users with computing,\ndata storage and platform services\
    \ that meet QoS requirements [50,51]. It played a strong role in\npromoting the\
    \ development of agricultural IoT. Firstly, cloud computing can provide farmers\
    \ with cheap\ndata storage services for text, image, video and other agricultural\
    \ information, which greatly reduces\nthe storage costs of agricultural enterprises\
    \ [52]. Secondly, it is diﬃcult to make direct use of these raw\ndata for making\
    \ decisions based on the technical level of farmers. Agricultural experts can\
    \ only make\naccurate judgments and give suggestions based on quantitative analysis.\
    \ Only cloud computing can\nsupport intelligent large-scale computing systems\
    \ [53,54]. Thirdly, cloud computing could provide\na secure platform for the development\
    \ of various IoT applications such as crop monitoring [55].\n3.5. Edge Computing\n\
    Edge computing refers to a new computing model that performs calculations at the\
    \ edge of the\nnetwork [56]. In the edge computing, the downlink data of the edge\
    \ represents the cloud service,\nthe uplink data represents IoT service and the\
    \ edge of edge computing refers to any computing\nand network resources between\
    \ the data source and the cloud computing center path. Because the\ncomputing\
    \ task is partially migrated to the network edge device, edge hormone can improve\
    \ data\ntransmission performance, ensure real-time processing and reduce the computational\
    \ load of the cloud\ncomputing center. Moreover, edge computing better protects\
    \ data because processing occurs closer to\nthe source than in cloud computing\
    \ [57,58].\n3.6. Machine Learning\nMachine learning (ML) is a smart way for computers\
    \ to simulate people’s learning activities, acquire\nnew knowledge, continuously\
    \ improve performance and implement their own perfection. In recent\nyears, machine\
    \ learning has achieved great success in algorithm, theory and application [59]\
    \ and have\nbeen combined with other agricultural technologies to maximized crop\
    \ yield while minimizing the input\ncosts [60]. The main machine learning algorithms\
    \ are naïve bayes, discriminant analysis, K-nearest\nneighbor, support vector\
    \ machine (SVM) [61], K-means clusterin, fuzzy clustering, gaussian mixture\n\
    models, artiﬁcial neural network (ANN), deep learning [62], decision tree algorithm\
    \ and so on [63].\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n10 of 24\nML can discover the internal\
    \ connection between messy, modelless and complex agricultural\ndata, make accurate\
    \ predictions and provide a theoretical basis for agricultural decision-making.\n\
    Machinelearning technology is playing an important role in crop breeding, disease\
    \ identiﬁcation,\npest and disease prediction, intelligent irrigation planning\
    \ and agricultural expert systems [64–67].\nFor example, ML technology can analyze\
    \ past farmland data, including the performance of crops under\ndiﬀerent climatic\
    \ conditions and the inheritance of a particular phenotype. As well, ML technology\n\
    can explore the association rules and then build a probability model to predict\
    \ which genes are\nmost likely to participate in the expression of a certain good\
    \ trait of the plant, which can help the\nbreeding expert conduct a reasonable\
    \ breeding experiment [68–70]. Kyosuke et al. came up with\na method for detecting\
    \ the maturity of a single intact tomato-based ML, which consisted of three\n\
    steps: pixel-based segmentation, blob-based segmentation and individual fruit\
    \ detection. In the ﬁrst\ntwo steps, decision trees were generated based on features\
    \ such as color, shape, texture and size and\nimage segmentations were conducted\
    \ using the generated trees. Finally, the automatical detection of\nindividual\
    \ fruit in multiple tomatoes was achieved by X-means clustering method. The results\
    \ of the\ntomato detection image test showed that their method achieved a recall\
    \ of 0.80, while the precision\nwas 0.88 [71]. Rahnemoonfar et al. proposed deep\
    \ learning architecture for counting fruits based\non convolutional neural networks.\
    \ They used synthetic images to train the neural network to save\ntime-consuming\
    \ collect and annotate. The network was trained for three epochs on 24,000 synthetic\n\
    images using an Adam optimizer and 100 randomly chosen images were tested. The\
    \ experimental\nresults demonstrated that their method had higher average accuracy\
    \ as comparing with others [72].\n3.7. Big Data\nThe protected agriculture produces\
    \ billions of dynamic, complex and spatial data including soil\ndatabases, greenhouse\
    \ environment data, livestock vaccination records and government investment\n\
    data. Compared with relational data structures that are logically expressed using\
    \ two-dimensional\ntables, agricultural data is more unstructured and has a large\
    \ number of hypermedia elements\nsuch as expert experience, knowledge and agricultural\
    \ models in the form of text, charts, pictures,\nanimations and voice/video [73].\
    \ The “big” of these data can be reﬂected in four dimensions: volume,\nvelocity,\
    \ variety and veracity [74]. Big Data technology is able to ﬁnd out the internal\
    \ links of collected\ndata through information mining and other means, discover\
    \ new information and provide data support\nfor the next operation. The most commonly\
    \ used techniques to deal with Big Data technology are\nimage processing, modeling\
    \ and simulation, machine learning, statistical analysis and geographical\ninformation\
    \ systems (GIS) [75].\n4. IoT Applications in Protected Agriculture\n4.1. Plant\
    \ Management\nCompared with open-ﬁeld agriculture, protected agriculture provides\
    \ a relatively suitable and\ncontrollable environment for crop growth by greenhouse\
    \ technology, which to some extent is free\nfrom the constraints of the natural\
    \ environment and promoted the intensive and eﬃcient use of\nagricultural resources.\
    \ However, spatial and temporal variability of crops’ growth environmental\nparameters\
    \ in the protected agriculture are strong and aﬀect each other [76,77], which\
    \ made it diﬃcult\nto adapt to the growth of diﬀerent types of plants in diﬀerent\
    \ growth stages by traditional cultivation\nand environmental regulation. Therefore,\
    \ it needs higher accuracy in the aspect of monitoring and\ncontrol. Many works\
    \ have attempted to design and test types of monitoring and control systems to\n\
    adjust greenhouse environmental parameters such as air temperature and humidity,\
    \ light intensity\nand CO2 concentration based on IoT and their results have proven\
    \ it is technically and economically\nfeasible [78]. At the low level of IoT development,\
    \ the environmental data were simply processed and\nusually presented in sheet\
    \ and plot form [79,80]. Later, some studies collected huge amounts of data\n\
    to set up various models based on plant growth or greenhouse climate [81–83],\
    \ which contributed\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n11 of 24\nto predicting the crop\
    \ yield and environment parameter changes to help farmers better manage\ngreenhouse.\
    \ CAI et al. developed a low-cost smart greenhouse remote monitor system based\
    \ on IoT.\nThe system used STM32F103 single chip machine and sensors to collect\
    \ environmental information\nand transferred the data to cloud by LPWAN. Security\
    \ link was established with TLS, which reduced\nsystem costs while ensuring the\
    \ security of data transmission. At the same time, they adopted a time\nseries\
    \ database to store data so that tremendous storage space can be saved [84]. He\
    \ et al. have reported\na greenhouse temperature intelligent control system based\
    \ on NB-IoT. The relative error of greenhouse\nenvironmental information collection\
    \ was below 1%, the average control accuracy was 3.57% (±1.0 ◦C),\nthe transmission\
    \ distance was not limited and the automatic regulation of crop growth temperature\n\
    was realized [85].\nNowaday, with the development of cloud computing, ML, etc.,\
    \ IoT solution can easily achieve\nsmart data processing and analyzing at low\
    \ cost and in a convenient way [86,87]. At the same time,\ngreenhouse technology\
    \ has also undergone several generations of upgrades and has now evolved into\n\
    highly mechanized and automated plant factories. Deng et al. have implemented\
    \ a closed-loop control\nsystem in a salad-cultivating plant factory based on\
    \ the kinetic model. Both digital simulation and\nreal-time results demonstrated\
    \ the system can work stably under the internal variations and external\ndisturbances\
    \ [88]. Zamora-Izquierdo et al. developed a smart farming IoT platform based on\
    \ edge and\ncloud computing, which was designed for soilless culture greenhouses\
    \ at low cost. The platform was\ncomposed of local, edge and cloud parts: the\
    \ local part dealt with data gathering and automatic control\nthough Cyber-Physical\
    \ Systems, the edge part took main management tasks and could improve the\nstability\
    \ of this systems, the cloud part was in charge of data analytics. Compared with\
    \ a regular\nopen control, the platform saved more than 30% water [89]. Katsoulas\
    \ et al. have designed an\nonline irrigation system for hydroponic greenhouse\
    \ crops and their results indicated it increased\nwater and fertilizer use eﬃciency\
    \ by 100% [90]. Liao et al. implemented a IoT-based system in\nan orchid greenhouse\
    \ to monitor the environmental factors and the growth status of phalaenopsis.\n\
    They developed an image processing algorithm to estimate the leaf area of phalaenopsisthe\
    \ and\nidentiﬁed the relationship between growth of plant leaves and environmental\
    \ factors. The proposed\nsystem could provide quantitative information with high\
    \ spatiotemporal resolution for ﬂoral farmers\nand contribute to updating farming\
    \ strategies for phalaenopsis in the future [91].\nDiseases and insect pests bring\
    \ a great threat to the growth of crops as and traditional technology\nand chemical\
    \ prevention and control has a certain lag and negative impact [92,93]. The rise\
    \ of IoT\nhas brought more eﬃcient and smarter solutions to crop disease and pest\
    \ control. Many types of\nIoT sensors can collect information about location,\
    \ greenhouse environment status, crop growth and\npest situation anywhere in real-time,\
    \ which helps farmers keep track of crop pests and diseases.\nThen, all raw image\
    \ and data are sent to cloud centers and later processed and analyzed by various\n\
    models and algorithms based on diﬀerent diseases and pests [94,95]. Finally, these\
    \ cloud centers\ngenerally provide farmers with the following services: disease\
    \ or pest identiﬁcation, disaster prediction\nand warning and recommended governance\
    \ measures from expert systems. Tirelli et al. proposed\na pest insect trap automatic\
    \ monitoring system using ZigBee technology, which can estimate the\ninsect density\
    \ by collected data from diﬀerent sites and send a warning message to farmers\
    \ when it\nexceeded the set value [96]. Ahouandjinou et al. proposed a pest monitoring\
    \ system which detected\nthe presence of pests by the acquisition of ultrasound\
    \ and assisted others in building up protocols\nfor early exterminate of the pests\
    \ [97]. Foughali et al. presented a potato late blight prevention and\ndecision\
    \ support system using cloud IoT and helped the agriculturists take eﬀective action\
    \ to treat\nthis disease [98]. Both Semios and Spensa Company launched their own\
    \ integrated pest management\nsystem, which was able to count the number of pests\
    \ by images, as well as characterize and capture\nthe insects. At present, pest\
    \ and disease warning research mainly provides medium and long-term\nwarning based\
    \ on historical data, which can provide macro guidance for crop production but\
    \ low\ntimeliness. Therefore, future research should focus on online monitoring\
    \ as well as diagnosis and early\nwarning of agricultural diseases.\nSensors 2019,\
    \ 19, 1833\n12 of 24\n4.2. Animal Farming\nLivestock and aquatic product farming\
    \ is an important part of protected agriculture and an area\nwhere IoT applications\
    \ have achieved good results. To achieve good control eﬀects in animal breeding,\n\
    IoT should not only overcome harsh environmental factors, but also pay attention\
    \ to the eﬀects of animal\nbehaviors [99,100]. IoT have been applied in monitoring\
    \ and management of environment, animal,\nfeed and farming process [101,102].\
    \ The livestock monitoring items include information such as body\ntemperature,\
    \ weight, behavior, exercise volume, food intake, disease information and environmental\n\
    factors, which can help people understand animal’s own physiological and nutritional\
    \ status and\nadaptability to external environmental conditions. In aquaculture,\
    \ management projects focus on water\nquality such as dissolved oxygen content,\
    \ water temperature and pH value [103,104] because water\nquality greatly aﬀects\
    \ the growth of aquatic animals. With animal growth and nutrient optimization\n\
    model and intelligent IoT equipment, it is possible to realiaze automatic feeding\
    \ and optimal control of\nfeeding time and intake according to their growth cycle,\
    \ individual quality, feeding cycle and eating\nsituation [105,106]. The Osborne\
    \ Industrial Company has produced TEAM automated electronic sow\nfeeding (ESF)\
    \ stations including pregnancy stations and estrus detection stations. The ESF\
    \ stations\nidentify the sow through the RFID tags worn by each sow and deliver\
    \ the corresponding quantity\nand type of feed based on information such as parity,\
    \ lyrical condition and gestational age. The estrus\ndetection stations can detect\
    \ rutting sows in the sow population and their detection accuracy is 7%\nhigher\
    \ than the manual ones. Encinas et al. presented a distributed monitoring IoT\
    \ system for\nwater quality monitoring. Their model was able to help ﬁsheries\
    \ acquire water quality parameters\nsuch as pH and temperature data in real time\
    \ to optimize pond resources and prevent unwanted\nconditions [107]. Soto-Zarazu´a\
    \ et al. proposed an automated recirculation tilapia farming system\nbased on\
    \ the fuzzy algorithm. The results of this work showed that it saved water by\
    \ 97.42% and\nthe water quality environmental parameters were controlled within\
    \ the acceptable range of tilapia\nculture [108]. Many researches have focused\
    \ on analysis of animal behavior, health care and diagnosis\nand warning of diseases\
    \ based on IoT [109–111]. Yazdanbakhsh et al. proposed an intelligent livestock\n\
    surveillance system. They attempted many machine learning algorithms to process\
    \ raw data of\nhealthy and ill cows and ﬁnally obtained good results used a wavelet-domain\
    \ ensemble classiﬁer with\n80.8% sensitivity and 80% speciﬁcity [112]. Wens Group,\
    \ the largest livestock breeding enterprise\nin China, took the lead in carrying\
    \ out research on the animal husbandry based on IoT and built\nthe corresponding\
    \ system for monitoring livestock vital signs, behavior and breeding environment\n\
    information [113]. Liu et al. collected a variety of penaeus vannamei information\
    \ such as real-time data\non the culture environment, disease image data and expert\
    \ disease diagnosis and treatment and ﬁnally,\nconstructed a remote intelligent\
    \ diagnosis model based on IoT [114]. Liu et al. proposed a web-based\ncombined\
    \ nutritional model for precisely predicting the growth, feed amount and nitrogen\
    \ phosphorus\noutput of gibel carp [115]. The current online diagnostics and early\
    \ warning of animal diseases is at an\nearly stage due to the lack of corresponding\
    \ sensors and models. With upgrading of hardware and\nartiﬁcial intelligence algorithms,\
    \ future research should focus on the improvement of Big Data depth\nalgorithm\
    \ and the establishment of comprehensive models of animal behavior and disease.\n\
    A few studies have made in-depth research in monitoring animal odor and hazardous\
    \ gas\nproduced during the breeding process such as ammonia gas and sulfur dioxide\
    \ [116]. Pan developed\nan electronic nose network system for monitoring and real-time\
    \ analysis of odors from livestock\nfarms. They placed e-noses in and around the\
    \ farm to build up a wireless network to measure odor\ncompounds as well as environmental\
    \ parameters [117].\n4.3. Agri-food Supply Chain Traceability\nNowday, agricultural\
    \ products/food safety issues are receiving worldwide attention and their\nsafety\
    \ traceability is one solution accepted by all parties of Agri-food domains. Governments\
    \ in many\ncountries and regions have promulgated laws and regulations to promote\
    \ the establishment of food\ntraceability system and strengthen the supervision\
    \ of agricultural products/food safety. The Agri-food\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n\
    13 of 24\nsupply chain traceability IoT-based system can ensure food safety and\
    \ quality at each link of the\nproduction, from the cropland to the consumer (Figure\
    \ 6), which could help consumers establish\nconﬁdence in food safety and contribute\
    \ to sustainable development of the whole food industry [118].\n \n4.3. Agri-food\

    \  can ensure food safety and quality at each \nlink of the production, from the\
    \ cropland to the consumer (Figure 6), which could help consumers \nestablish\
    \ confidence in food safety and contribute to sustainable development of the whole\
    \ food \nindustry [118].  \n \nFigure 6. Schematic representation of the Agri-food\
    \ supply chain from the grower to consumer. \nIn past years, a lot of countries\
    \ have established the traceability platform for meat,milk, fish and \nagri-food\
    \ products based on IoT [119–121]. However, the fresh food cold chain logistics\
    \ traceability \nhas also drawn widespread attention [122,123]. RFID technology\
    \ still played an important role in \nAgri-food supply chain traceability due\
    \ to its small size and low cost [124]. As a novel technology, \nnear field communication\
    \ (NFC) has been progressively developed and used because of its safe and \nsimple\
    \ operation [125,126]. A common problem in the development of IoT is its asynchronous\
    \ \nheterogeneous data flow and distributed features. This requires the traceability\
    \ system to establish \nuniform and accurate identification naming rules to facilitate\
    \ quick and unique retrieval of \ninformation on a farm product [127]. As the\
    \ deployment of IoT infrastructure is completed, the \nsupply chain will move\
    \ towards virtualization which is no longer required physical contact. The \n\
    virtualization of an agri-food supply chain helps administrators better monitor,\
    \ control, plan and \noptimize food supply chain processes [128]. Wang et al.\
    \ proposed a food safety pre-warning system \nbased on association rules mining\
    \ and IoT. It included four modules: information source, warning \nFigure 6. Schematic\

    \ contact. The virtualization of an\nagri-food supply chain helps administrators\
    \ better monitor, control, plan and optimize food supply\nchain processes [128].\
    \ Wang et al. proposed a food safety pre-warning system based on association\n\
    rules mining and IoT. It included four modules: information source, warning analysis,\
    \ reaction and\nemergency feedback. First, they accessed food critical information\
    \ through data processing and\nanalysis of food traceability data for safety assessment.\
    \ On this basis of this data, the system used the\nassociated data mining method\
    \ to discover the connection between them and then obtained the food\nsafety risk\
    \ analysis results. Subsequently, the system made a corresponding early warning\
    \ response\nbased on this result [129].\nRecently, the increasing incidents of\
    \ food falsiﬁcation have not only brought about great economic\nlosses, but also\
    \ undermined consumers’ conﬁdence in food safety. The blockchain technology with\n\
    decentralization, non-tamperability, development transparency and machine autonomy\
    \ features\nbrings new solutions to the above problems [130,131]. Tian et al.\
    \ reported a new decentralized\ntraceability system based on IoT and blockchain\
    \ technology, which can provid an open, transparent,\nneutral, safe and reliable\
    \ information platform for producers, governments, consumers and other\nstakeholders\
    \ [132]. Kaijun et al. combined the supply chain and blockchain technology to\
    \ propose\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n14 of 24\na double chain architecture agricultural\
    \ traceability system by studying the dual chain structure and\nits storage mode,\
    \ resource rent-seeking and matching mechanism and consensus algorithm [133].\n\
    Now, with the innovation and maturity of related technologies, it is not diﬃcult\
    \ for researchers to\ndevelop a complete set of traceability systems. The rise\
    \ of artiﬁcial intelligence technology enables\nexisting traceability systems\
    \ to provide automation, intelligence and human services to businesses\nand consumers.\
    \ Chen et al. adopted fuzzy cognitive maps and fuzzy rule method to come up with\n\
    an autonomous tracing system for backward design in food supply chain based on\
    \ IoT, which better\ntraced food product problems [134]. However, there are still\
    \ some problems in food safety traceability.\nIt is worth noting that the current\
    \ agricultural product safety traceability system only focuses on\na certain level\
    \ of supply chain or a certain type of goods. With the participation of multiple\
    \ projects\nor multiple sessions, we believe that the focus of future research\
    \ should be on more complex and\nsystematic supply chains.\n5. Disscussion\n5.1.\
    \ Hardware and Software Challenges\nWhen IoT technology is applying in protected\
    \ agriculture, it is inevitable to encounter challenges\nfrom all aspects. In\
    \ the perception layer, various devices must face the harsh and complex greenhouse\n\
    environment. Strong solar radiation, high temperatures, high humidity, strong\
    \ vibrations and other\nhazards can easily damage or destroy sensors or end devices.\
    \ Moreover, the daily activities of livestock\ncan interfere with the work of\
    \ the sensor or execution nodes, resulting in poor detection and control.\nIn\
    \ a general way, the information collection nodes rely on the battery with limited\
    \ power to maintain\nits work because the behavior of frequent battery replacement\
    \ consume a lot of energies and money.\nTherefore, it is an urgent need to make\
    \ great progress in developing low-power acquisition equipment,\nenergy-saving\
    \ sink node routing protocols and energy-balanced communication algorithms [135].\n\
    The devices places in various places generate incalculable data and the storage\
    \ of such data\nis also a huge challenge for some small servers.\nThose agricultural\
    \ IoT data have real-time,\ndynamic, granular and fragmented characteristics,\
    \ which brings great challenges to intermediate\ndesign, data large-scale screening,\
    \ screening, mining, processing and decision analysis techniques.\nMoreover, existing\
    \ databases cannot store unstructured data such as audio, video and images. As\
    \ a result,\nquite a lot real-time sensing data are not fully exploited. Besides,\
    \ some models and algorithms are not\nenough to to reﬂect objective reality, so\
    \ that they cannot eﬀectively guide agricultural production.\n5.2. Network Challenge\n\
    In protected agriculture, the sensor and device need to continuously operate under\
    \ the harsh\nand varied environment and their arrangement is sparse and irregular.\
    \ Compared with the wired\nnetwork with high wiring costs, the wireless network\
    \ has the advantages of low cost, good networking\nﬂexibility and high scalability\
    \ and therefore becomes the main application mode of the current\nmonitoring system.\
    \ Many actual deployments have displayed that common wireless communication\n\
    technologies are aﬀected by temperature, humidity andbuildings or other spatial\
    \ barriers [136–138].\nThe growth of animals and plants changes also result in\
    \ background noise [139] because of the\nmulti-path propagation eﬀects, which\
    \ lows reliability of data transmission. It is easy to isolate a node in\nthe\
    \ original communication network due to low node deployment density and the above\
    \ obstacles in\nprotected agriculture. If this node is responsible for communication\
    \ routing tasks of many devices and\nthis node is damaged and isolated from the\
    \ network, this will cause partial or even paralysis of most of\nthe network.\
    \ Most relevant theories and research needes on the eﬀects of the crop growth,\
    \ the thickness\nand material of wall, and the radio signal transmission loss\
    \ and electromagnetic wave transmission\nbetween soil and air interface, etc.\
    \ To determine the optimal position, height and network topology\nof sensor nodes\
    \ under diﬀerent environmental conditions. On the other hand, ad hoc intelligent\n\
    wireless network technology is needed to reduce or avoid paralysis of large-area\
    \ networks. The rise of\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n15 of 24\nLPWAN may solve e above\
    \ paralysis problems of WLAN due to its long communication distance,\nwhich obviates\
    \ the need for the dense and expensive deployments of relays and gateways altogether.\n\
    However, the cost of erecting LPWAN base stations is high.\nThe process of recording\
    \ various agricultural products’ status from the ﬁeld to the table\ngenerates\
    \ a large amount of data, which brings great challenges to wireless communication\
    \ with\na low transmission rate. At same times, it also brought network nodes\
    \ many problems in energy\ndistribution, data calculation, storage and communication.\
    \ Therefore, there is an urgent need to\ndevelop high-capacity data and real-time\
    \ broadband communication standards for technologies in\ncomplex agricultural\
    \ application environments.\n5.3. Security Challenge\nThe problems of security\
    \ and privacy are thought as crucial challenges in applications of protected\n\
    agriculture due to real-world examples of losses due to vulnerabilities, network\
    \ attacks or privacy issues.\nAs a multi-network heterogeneous converged network,\
    \ it not only has the same security problems as\nsensor networks, mobile communication\
    \ networks and the Interne, but also has its particular issues\nsuch as privacy\
    \ protection issues, authentication and access control issues for heterogeneous\
    \ networks,\nstorage and management of information issues, etc.\nIn the perception\
    \ layer, security threats are mainly against the WSN and RFID. In agricultural\n\
    applications, many of the sensor nodes are deployed in the long-term unsupervised\
    \ farmland\nenvironment and the wireless network itself is open, so the wireless\
    \ transmission is vulnerable to\nexternal interference and illegal users. Coupled\
    \ with the fact that these devices are respectively\nplaced elsewhere, a single\
    \ security measure is not enough [140]. The main threats to WSN include\neavesdropping\
    \ attack, node capture, replay attack and information wiretapping. So multiple\
    \ security\nmechanisms such as anonymity mechanism, data encryption and identity\
    \ authentication mechanisms\nare necessary [141,142].\nThe security threat of\
    \ RFID refers mainly to the attacks that are encountered when the RFID\nreader\
    \ and the tag communicate and such attacks usually lead to user privacy. In addition,\
    \ because the\nRFID tag is rewritable, the security and validity of the RFID tag\
    \ data will not be guaranteed.\nThere are lots of ways to enhance RFID tag security\
    \ such as modifying tag frequency, enciphered data.\nSensor nodes are diﬀerent\
    \ from RFID tag because they are active and relate to the dynamic properties of\n\
    things. Therefore, when applying encryption algorithms, key distribution policies,\
    \ intrusion detection\nmechanisms and security routing policies in speciﬁc devices,\
    \ we need to consider the limitations of\ntheir own hardware.\nSince networks\
    \ of diﬀerent architectures need to be connected to each other, there are even\n\
    greater challenges in terms of security authentication across network architectures.\
    \ The transport\nlayer will encounter the following security challenges: proxy\
    \ attacks, DoS (Denial-of-Service) attacks,\nmalicious code injection, man-in-the-middle\
    \ attacks, attacks across heterogeneous networks, etc.\nThe common measures dealt\
    \ with these network layer threats and attacks are: authorization,\nauthentication,\
    \ encryption, anti-virus protection, etc. IoT terminal devices in protected agriculture\n\
    have the characteristics of weak computing power and small storage space. Due\
    \ to limited resources,\nIoT encryption technology must be an easy to implement,\
    \ lightweight security technology that is\nsuitable for use in sensitive information\
    \ environments [143,144].\nWhen massive agricultural data is transmitted to the\
    \ application layer, in addition to the intelligent\nprocessing of data, data\
    \ security and privacy should also be considered. At this level, a large amount\n\
    of private data about users is collected, such as the consumption of agricultural\
    \ materials, the purchase\ninformation of fruits and vegetables and the location\
    \ of agricultural machinery. Therefore, the database\naccess control strategy\
    \ should be strengthened on the basis of intelligent data processing. When diﬀerent\n\
    users access the same data, they should limit their permissions and operations\
    \ according to their security\nlevel or identity, eﬀectively ensuring data security\
    \ and privacy. On the other hand, application layer\nservice providers should\
    \ accelerate the development and upgrade of authentication mechanisms\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 1833\n16 of 24\nand encryption mechanisms for application scenarios\
    \ such as agricultural production, processing,\ntransportation and consumption.\n\
    5.4. Other Challenges\nThere are other challenges that need to be addressed, which\
    \ are related to the further application of\nIoT technology in protected agriculture.\
    \ Thousands of devices which have huge diﬀerences in processor,\nmemory, communication\
    \ protocol and programming language are deployed in protected agriculture,\nwhich\
    \ inevitably results in heterogeneity issues. Besides, most of devices in protected\
    \ agriculture are\nconnected to the cloud or others by the non-standard heterogeneous\
    \ interfaces [14,22]. This has led\nto problems of both device heterogeneity and\
    \ data heterogeneity. The device heterogeneity problem\naﬀects the scalability\
    \ of IoT in protected agriculture and the data heterogeneity problem hinders the\n\
    use of fusion information by models [145]. Although many research institutes,\
    \ hardware and software\nmanufacturers and related organizations have made a lot\
    \ of contributions to the standardization and\ndeployment of IoT in agriculture,\
    \ it still needs to establish a complete and clear structure, protocols and\n\
    standards to connect various heterogeneous devices and services [146,147].\nThe\
    \ cost has always been a barrier to the large-scale application of IoT to ordinary\
    \ farmers,\nespecially in developing countries like China and India. Despite a\
    \ large number of embedded devices\nand platforms have emerged and the cost of\
    \ hardware and software is rapidly decreasing, but here is\nanother situation\
    \ in high-quality and high-precision sensors and devices. Moreover, some funds\
    \ are\nneeded to train farmers to become proﬁcient in the use of IoT equipment.\
    \ In order to be able toplay\na better role in the future, the cost of sensing,\
    \ transmission, analysis and application components and\nequipment on the IoT\
    \ need to further reduce in order to lower the price and make it more aﬀordable\n\
    in the next decade [148]. Government departments should recognize the signiﬁcant\
    \ potential for the\ndevelopment of IoT in protected agriculture and increase\
    \ investment and support through policies and\nfunds to attract more capital and\
    \ achieve rapid development and application.\nIn addition, the usability of the\
    \ terminal device needs to be further improved, for example, the user\ninterface\
    \ needs to be friendlier andthe device needs to be more convenient in size and\
    \ easy to carry.\nIoT brings many beneﬁts to ecological environment and brings\
    \ some problems.. More and\nmore equipment is being placed in agriculture andso\
    \ the issues of environmental friendliness should\nreceive some attention in the\
    \ future. As the e-waste generated by IoT devices and the consumption of\nenergy\
    \ are gradually increasing, the sustainable development of the ecological environment\
    \ is also one\ncommon concern. Examples of interesting research topics include\
    \ the use of degradable materials and\nrenewable energy sources, the reduction\
    \ of equipment size and the use of energy-saving algorithms\nand new green ICT\
    \ technology [149,150].\nThe application of the Internet of Things in facility\
    \ agriculture needs to consider the socio-economic\nconsequences. On the one hand,\
    \ it increases the level of intelligence in agricultural monitoring,\ncontrol\
    \ and decision-making, thereby increasing the eﬃciency and quality of agricultural\
    \ production.\nAt the same time, it will also change the demand for the existing\
    \ agricultural workforce, causing some\npeople who are engaged in simple repetitive\
    \ tasks to lose their jobs, which will cause a series of\nsocial problems.\n5.5.\
    \ Future Prospects\nIoT technology is being applied to many ﬁelds of society,\
    \ economy and life at an unprecedented\nspeed, making human society step into\
    \ a new era of high intelligence. IoT technology is evolving\nand mature, and\
    \ many novel deployments and applications are constantly being built in protected\n\
    agriculture. Based on the above analysis and discussion of the key technologies\
    \ and applications of IoT\nin the protection of agriculture, we will present its\
    \ future development prospects and key research and\ndevelopment directions in\
    \ the following aspects. In the perception layer, the development of sensors\n\
    should focus on new sensitive materials, mechanisms, processes and methodologies\
    \ as well as low\npower consumption and low cost. Besides, we must accelerate\
    \ the development of sensors and rapid\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n17 of 24\ndetection\
    \ devices soil, animal and plant life. At the network layer, we should focus on\
    \ high-capacity data\nreal-time broadband communication standards and technologies\
    \ for complex agricultural application\nenvironments, high-reliability, adaptive,\
    \ low-power network deployment and management strategies\nand algorithms. With\
    \ wide coverage, high capacity, low power consumption and low cost, LPWAN is\n\
    ideal for some agricultural scenarios where text-based, video and voice service\
    \ support is not required\nand coverage, power consumption and cost are critical.\
    \ Future research and deployment should\nfocus on IoT solutions based on LPWAN.\
    \ In the application layer, governments and organizations\nshould develop uniﬁed\
    \ standards for the sensors and identiﬁcation interface devices, data transmission\n\
    communication protocols, multi-source data fusion analysis processing and application\
    \ services in\nprotected agriculture through international cooperation or negotiation.\
    \ Software developers should\ndevelop large open source databases and signal processing\
    \ algorithm libraries for diﬀerent areas\nof facility agriculture. For universities\
    \ and research institutes, cloud-based agricultural intelligent\ndecision-making\
    \ models, multi-source data-based information fusion algorithms, agricultural\
    \ Big Data\nmining technologies, distributed intelligent processing systems and\
    \ lightweight IoT authentication,\nencryption and authorization mechanisms will\
    \ be the key research directions for the future. With an\nincreased presence of\
    \ IoT technology in protected agriculture, its potential for the reﬁned management\n\
    of crop, livestock and aquatic animals will be recognized. Besides, as a technical\
    \ means to monitor\nthe production, processing, circulation and consumption of\
    \ agricultural products, IoTwill play an\nincreasingly important role in food\
    \ safety.\n6. Conclusions\nIn this survey, we present a comprehensive review of\
    \ the state-of-the-art in IoT deployment\nfor protected agriculture applications.\
    \ First, a simple review of previous IoT structure was given.\nSecondly, the basic\
    \ IoT architectures in protected agriculture were introduced. Next, discussions\
    \ of\nsensor, data communication, cloud computing, edge computing, ML and other\
    \ vital IoT technologies\nin protected agriculture are elaborated.\nThen, we highlight\
    \ various IoT applications and their\npotential to solve various farming problems\
    \ in protected agriculture. By classifying the research and\ndeployment literature\
    \ on IoT in protected agriculture, three important application ﬁelds were given:\n\
    plant management, animal farming and agri-food supply chain traceability. Finally,\
    \ a detailed analyses\nof IoT research challenges and future prospects were outlined.\n\
    The survey of the existing works directs us concluding remarks. The future prospects\
    \ of IoT in\nprotected agriculture are expectant, but the challenges mentioned\
    \ above must handle. In order to\ncope with its complex and changing agricultural\
    \ environment, the hardware devices must be fully\nupgraded to further enhance\
    \ their universality, reliability, expansibility, endurance and intelligence\n\
    level, while reducing costs and operative diﬃculty. Secondly, the local network\
    \ must be protected from\ninterference from other networks. In addition, the interoperability,\
    \ ﬁltering and semantic annotation of\ndata generated by the various devices of\
    \ IoT must be realized to a certain extent. Only in this way\ncan we optimize\
    \ the Big Data decision support model by using a large amount of heterogeneous\
    \ data.\nSecurity, anonymity and control over the access rights on the information\
    \ is vital for such a system to\nbe adopted. Finally, the impact of IoT on the\
    \ agroecological environment and social economy should\nbe considered in the application\
    \ of protected agriculture, to realize the sustainable development of\nagricultural\
    \ environment as quick as possible.\nAuthor Contributions: The collection, classiﬁcation\

  title: State-of-the-Art Internet of Things in Protected Agriculture
  verbatim_quote1: 'The Internet of Things (IoT) has tremendous success in health
    care, smart city,

    industrial production and so on. Protected agriculture is one of the ﬁelds which
    has broad application

    prospects of IoT. Protected agriculture is a mode of highly eﬃcient development
    of modern agriculture

    that uses artiﬁcial techniques to change climatic factors such as temperature,
    to create environmental

    conditions suitable for the growth of animals and plants, enabling them to grow
    around the clock.

    Sensors 2019, 19, 1833

    2 of 24

    The concept of protected agriculture is relative to open-ﬁeld agriculture. It
    uses artiﬁcial techniques

    to change climatic factors such as natural light, temperature and humidity to
    create environmental

    conditions suitable for the growth of animals and plants, enabling them to grow
    around the clock.

    Protected agriculture has more potential to apply IoT technology, because it occurs
    in wide areas that

    need to be continuously monitored and controlled [4,5].'
  verbatim_quote2: 'With the development of agricultural sensor, wireless communication,
    cloud computing,

    machine learning and Big Data technologies, IoT technology has emerged and is
    gradually being

    promoted and applied in the protected agriculture ﬁeld [7–9]. It is playing an
    important role in various

    areas of protected agriculture as it is capable of helping farmers monitor soil
    condition, climate change

    and animal and plant health [10]. When the environmental factor change beyond
    the set threshold,

    IoT will automatically send a warning message to the administrator to remove the
    hidden danger.

    It can also control environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, carbon
    dioxide concentration

    and illumination according to the condition of crop growth in real time [11,12].
    In addition, cameras in

    the IoT system are able to capture crop diseases and insect pests in the greenhouse
    in real time,

    helping farmers ﬁnd problems and take targeted preventive measures [13]. Through
    GPS, RFID and

    other location-based sensors, goods such as vegetables can be tracked and monitored
    visually during

    transportation and storage. Supermarket managers use smart phone or PC to monitor
    and predict

    product status and the demand for getting product on shelves. At the user or consumer
    end, people can

    query the variety, origin, processing and other farm product information by means
    of the QR code,

    barcode, etc. IoT for protected agriculture can help create an informed, connected,
    developed and

    adaptable rural community. Low-cost embedded devices can improve the interaction
    between humans

    and the physical world. Cloud computing, edge computing, and Big Data can provide
    valuable analysis

    and support for decisions. In summary, IoT will become an important tool in the
    next few years to

    engage people in embedded agriculture which includes suppliers, farmers, technicians,
    distributors,

    merchants, consumers and government representatives [14,15].'

  analysis: 'The paper by Fernández-Caramés and Fraga-Lamas (2019) provides a comprehensive
    review of the use of IoT, blockchain, and cloud computing technologies for developing
    next-generation smart campuses and universities. The authors discuss the potential

    research, and campus management. They also identify key challenges that need to
    be addressed for the successful implementation of smart campus and university
    systems.


    In one of the sections of the paper, the authors discuss the use of LoRaWAN technology
    for IoT communications on smart campuses. They highlight the benefits of LoRaWAN,
    such as its long range, low power consumption, and scalability, and present some
    examples of its use in smart campus applications. One of the examples they provide
    is the implementation of a LoRaWAN-based air quality monitoring system on a French
    smart campus.


    The paper contributes to the literature on smart campuses and universities by
    providing a comprehensive overview of the latest technologies and architectures
    for developing these systems. It also identifies key challenges that need to be
    addressed for the successful implementation of these systems.

    1. Introduction\nSmart campuses and universities require an IT infrastructure\
    \ similar to the one needed by smart\ncities, smart buildings, or smart homes,\
    \ which make use of Internet of Things (IoT) solutions [1–4] to\ninteract with\
    \ the sensor and actuation systems of a university. Similarly to smart cities,\
    \ but in contrast\nto most smart homes and buildings, smart campuses must provide\
    \ long-distance communications,\nas many university campuses cover an area that\
    \ can reach thousands of square meters. For instance,\nthe campus of the authors\
    \ of this article (Campus of Elviña, University of A Coruña, Spain) occupies a\n\
    26,000 m2 area. Nonetheless, such an area can be considered small when compared\
    \ with the largest\nuniversity campuses in the world: Berry College (Floyd County,\
    \ Georgia, United States) covers 109.26\nkm2 of land [5], Duke University campuses\
    \ (Durham, North Carolina, United States) are deployed on\n37.83 km2 [6], and\
    \ the campus of Stanford University (Stanford, California, United States) occupies\
    \ 8180\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 4479; doi:10.3390/app9214479\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/applsci\n\
    Appl. Sci. 2019, 9, 4479\n2 of 24\nacres (33 km2) [7]. These ﬁgures mean that\
    \ smart campuses should make use of speciﬁc long-distance\ncommunications infrastructure\
    \ that provides indoor and outdoor connectivity to the deployed IoT\ngateways,\
    \ sensors and actuators, while guaranteeing reduced energy consumption and thus\
    \ optimized\nIoT node battery life.\nA smart campus and university is managed\
    \ according to its strategic plan (a framework of its\nmain priorities and commitments).\
    \ As a result, universities devote ﬁnancial resources to implement a\nbroad range\
    \ of actions (e.g., related to digital transformation, services, applications,\
    \ events, facilities,\nhuman resources, governance, educational programs, or innovation)\
    \ that are fundamentally designed\nto meet their institutional objectives. The\
    \ strategic plan is driven by the university mission, vision, and\ncore values\
    \ (further detailed in Section 2). For instance, a number of universities around\
    \ the world\nhas committed to make tangible contributions to the United Nations\
    \ Sustainable Development Goals\n(SDGs). Note that the provided smart campus services\
    \ may be similar to the ones of a smart city,\nbut adapted to the needs of a university\
    \ (e.g., mobility/transport services, energy/grid monitoring,\nresource consumption\
    \ efﬁciency, user behavior monitoring, or guidance applications). However, there\n\
    are other services that are speciﬁc for a university environment, such as the\
    \ services for analyzing the\nbehavior of students in certain outdoor activities\
    \ or their attendance to lectures.\nIn addition, there are other relevant differences\
    \ with respect to smart cities regarding the\narchitectures and technologies that\
    \ can be applied to smart campuses and universities:\n•\nSmaller size. Although,\
    \ as it has been previously mentioned, there are really large campuses, most\n\
    of them are not as large as cities and, in fact, there are many urban universities\
    \ with buildings\ninside a city. Such a smaller size enables using certain communications\
    \ technologies that do not\nneed to reach very long distances. In addition, since\
    \ often less devices require to be deployed than\nin a smart city, architectures\
    \ can be less complex and need less routing layer devices, what usually\nreduces\
    \ response time and infrastructure deployment cost.\n•\nInfrastructure management.\
    \ Frequently, in a smart campus/university all buildings and related\ninfrastructure\
    \ are managed by the same organization (i.e., the university), often making it\
    \ easier\nto take certain measures to ease the deployment of the required infrastructure\
    \ communications\nand architecture than in a smart city. In contrast, in a city\
    \ most space is occupied with private\nbuildings that are managed by people that\
    \ do not work for the city council, so certain infrastructure\ndeployments can\
    \ be difﬁcult when having to deal with the different necessities of multiple people.\n\
    •\nHomogeneity.\nA smart university can enforce the use of certain technologies\
    \ and speciﬁc\narchitectures, while a smart city in general will have to deal\
    \ with a greater heterogeneity in\nsuch areas, which usually require complex solutions\
    \ to integrate the numerous previously existing\ncomputational systems.\nDue to\
    \ the previously mentioned differences, it is essential to study speciﬁcally\n\
    the most\nappropriate architectures and technologies for developing smart campuses\
    \ and universities.\nIn contrast to previous reviews and surveys on smart campuses/universities,\
    \ which are presented\nas systematic literature reviews [8,9], are focused on\
    \ deﬁning certain generic concepts/applications [10],\nor are centered on speciﬁc\
    \ technologies [11–16], this article provides a holistic review that analyzes\
    \ the\napplication of the latest key technologies and architectures for the development\
    \ of smart campuses\nand universities, including the following contributions,\
    \ which have not been found together in the\nprevious literature.\n•\nAfter deﬁning\
    \ the essential characteristics of a smart campus and a smart university, the\
    \ most\ncommon communications architectures are detailed together with their evolution:\
    \ from traditional\ncloud-based to the latest ones based on edge computing.\n\
    •\nThe application of blockchain to such architectures is studied as a tool to\
    \ create a distributed\nimmutable log that provides transparency and cybersecurity\
    \ to higher education and smart\ncampus applications.\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 4479\n\
    3 of 24\n•\nThe characteristics of the most relevant smart campus deployments\
    \ and initiatives are analyzed.\n•\nThe latest smart campus deployments are enumerated\
    \ and multiple examples of their applications\nare described.\n•\nThe most recent\
    \ communications technologies for outdoor and indoor smart campus applications\n\
    are studied.\n•\nThe main challenges that will be faced by university planners,\
    \ IoT vendors, and developers\nare listed.\nThe rest of this paper is structured\
    \ as follows. Section 2 deﬁnes the concept of smart campus and\nits main features.\
    \ Section 3 details the latest communications architectures for smart campuses\
    \ and\nsmart universities. Section 4 analyzes the potential applications of blockchain\
    \ for deploying higher\neducation and smart campus applications. Section 5 describes\
    \ the most relevant smart campuses that\nhave been already deployed, emphasizing\
    \ their main applications and communications technologies.\nFinally, Section 6\
    \ indicates the main challenges for university planners, IoT vendors, and developers,\n\
    and Section 7 is devoted to the conclusions.\n2. Deﬁnitions of Smart Campus and\
    \ Smart University\nIt must be ﬁrst clariﬁed that the term “smart campus” has\
    \ been used in the past to refer to digital\nonline platforms that manage university\
    \ content [17,18] or to the set of techniques aimed at increasing\nuniversity\
    \ student smartness [19–21]. However, in this article, the concept of smart campus\
    \ refers\nto the hardware and software required to provide advanced intelligent\
    \ context-aware services and\napplications to university students and staff. In\
    \ addition, the term smart university refers to the\nhardware and software used\
    \ to develop tools to fulﬁll the key dimensions of the university mission:\n•\n\
    Improve the teaching, learning, and assessment processes involved in higher education.\n\
    •\nFoster research and innovation.\n•\nEmpower community-based knowledge transfer\
    \ and a shared vision among the various\nuniversity stakeholders (e.g., teachers,\
    \ students, administration, non-proﬁt organizations, research\ninstitutions, citizens,\
    \ industries, and governments).\nSuch characteristics make smart campus and universities\
    \ unique and enable differentiating from\nother concepts like smart cities. Nonetheless,\
    \ smart campuses/universities are similar to smart cities\nin the way they are\
    \ organized, which revolves around six smart areas [22]:\n•\nSmart governance.\
    \ It allows university staff and students to take part in different decisions\
    \ that\nneed to be made on a university or on a speciﬁc campus.\n•\nSmart people.\
    \ It is related to the engagement of the university users in teaching and learning\n\
    processes or their attendance to certain events.\n•\nSmart mobility. In the case\
    \ of a smart campus, this ﬁeld deals with the different issues related\nto the\
    \ available transport systems, which should be efﬁcient, green, safe, and may\
    \ provide\nintelligent services.\n•\nSmart environment. This ﬁeld is related to\
    \ smart solutions able to monitor, protect, and actuate on\nthe environment while\
    \ also managing the available resources in a sustainable way. For instance,\n\
    smart environment systems provide solutions for monitoring waste, water consumption,\
    \ or air\nquality. In addition, this ﬁeld is usually related to the deployment\
    \ of systems to control and\nmonitor the energy consumed, generated and distributed\
    \ throughout a campus.\n•\nSmart living. It is responsible for monitoring the\
    \ multiple living factors involved in the daily\ncampus activities, including\
    \ the ones related to health, safety or user behavior. Thus, smart living\nservices\
    \ can perform the following [23,24]:\n–\nEstimate room occupation and determine\
    \ student classroom attendance.\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 4479\n4 of 24\n–\nControl\
    \ the access to classroom/lab equipment.\n–\nProvide teaching interaction services\
    \ and context-aware applications.\n•\nSmart economy. This smart ﬁeld deals with\
    \ the productivity of a campus in relation to concepts\nlike entrepreneurship\
    \ or innovation.\nAs a summary, Figure 1 illustrates the main ﬁelds and technologies\
    \ related to the deployment\nof a smart campus/university. The inner circle contains\
    \ the six previously mentioned smart ﬁelds.\nThe contiguous outer circle references\
    \ some of the most relevant technologies required to provide\nsolutions for such\
    \ six smart ﬁelds, including IoT, Augmented Reality (AR), Cyber-Physical Systems\n\
    (CPSs), or UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles). Note that some of such technologies\
    \ are the same as the\nones proposed by Industry 4.0 [25], so commercial and industrial\
    \ deployments are already available in\nother ﬁelds outside smart campuses [26,27].\
    \ Moreover, there are also vertical ﬁelds like cybersecurity\nthat affect several\
    \ of the cited technologies, since their contribution is key to avoid potential\
    \ issues [28].\nFinally, the most external circle of Figure 1 indicates speciﬁc\
    \ smart areas that are usually involved\nin the daily activities carried out in\
    \ a smart campus/university. For example, smart plug-and-play\nobjects [29] may\
    \ be involved in many university activities, whereas certain environmental sensors\
    \ are\nessential for actuating on smart buildings [30]. There are also other ﬁelds,\
    \ like smart agriculture, that\nmay be speciﬁc for smart campuses that include\
    \ in their premises areas for growing certain crops that\nmay require the use\
    \ of autonomous decision-support systems [31].\nRobots \nand UAVs\nBig Data\n\

    Figure 1. Main ﬁelds and technologies of a smart campus.\n3. Smart Campus/University\
    \ Communications Architectures\nSeveral authors have previously proposed different\
    \ smart campus architectures, but it\ncan be stated that, in general, they can\
    \ be classiﬁed as Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 4479\n\
    5 of 24\narchitectures [32,33] that revolve around two main paradigms (IoT and\
    \ cloud computing [34]), which\nare usually helped by Big Data when processing\
    \ and analyzing the collected information.\nAn example of smart campus architecture\
    \ based on cloud computing is presented in [35], where\nthe authors deployed a\
    \ smart campus platform in three months by using Commercial Off-The-Shelf\n(COTS)\
    \ hardware and Microsoft Azure cloud services. With respect to IoT, its use has\
    \ been proposed\nfor easing the deployment of architectures that allow for implementing\
    \ learning, access control, or\nresource water management applications [10,36].\n\
    Some researchers have also proposed alternative paradigms for creating smart campuses.\n\
    For instance, the authors of [37] propose an opportunistic communications architecture\
    \ that allows for\nsharing data through infrastructure-less services. The main\
    \ novelty behind the proposed architecture\nis the concept of Floating Content\
    \ node, which is a computing device that produces data that can be\nshared among\
    \ users located in nearby areas. Similar architectures have been proposed, but\
    \ they have\nbeen focused on improving certain aspects like security [38].\nSome\
    \ of the latest smart campus architectures have suggested the use of the different\
    \ types of\nthe edge computing paradigm (e.g., mobile edge computing or fog computing),\
    \ which have already\nbeen successfully applied to other smart ﬁelds [39]. The\
    \ main advantage of edge computing is its\nability to ofﬂoad part of the processing\
    \ tasks from the cloud, delegating such tasks to the so-called\nedge devices,\
    \ which are physically located close to the IoT nodes. Thanks to this approach,\
    \ the amount\nof communications transactions with the cloud and latency response\
    \ are reduced, while also being\nable to provide location-aware services [40,41].\n\
    For example, the authors of [42] make use of edge computing devices to improve\
    \ their smart\ncampus architecture. Such devices are focused on delivering services\
    \ related to content caching and\nbandwidth allocation. A similar approach is\
    \ presented in [43], where the researchers provide smart\ncampus services through\
    \ edge computing devices embedded into street lights. In the case of the work\n\
    detailed in [44], the authors propose a smart campus platform called WiCloud that\
    \ is based in mobile\nedge computing, which allows for accessing the platform\
    \ servers through mobile phone base stations\nor wireless access points. Finally,\
    \ it is worth mentioning the smart campus system presented in [45],\nwhich makes\
    \ use of fog computing nodes to enhance user experience.\nTo clarify the previously\
    \ mentioned architectures, Figure 2 illustrates their evolution. In this\nﬁgure,\
    \ at the top, the traditional cloud-based architecture is depicted, which is composed\
    \ by two main\nlayers:\n•\nNode layer: it consists of multiple IoT nodes and computing\
    \ devices, whose data are collected\nthrough IoT gateways and routers in order\
    \ to send them to the cloud where they are stored.\n•\nCloud layer: it is essentially\
    \ a central server or a group of servers where the main processing tasks\nare\
    \ carried out. In addition, the cloud allows for interacting with third parties,\
    \ it presents the\nstored data to remote users and enables interconnecting the\
    \ multiple IoT networks that may be\nscattered through different physical locations.\n\
    The architecture depicted at the bottom of Figure 2 on the left represents a fog\
    \ computing\narchitecture. In this case, besides the node layer and the cloud,\
    \ there is a third layer (the fog layer),\nwhich is made of fog devices. Such\
    \ devices provide different local fog services to the IoT nodes and\nare also\
    \ able to exchange data among them to collaborate in certain tasks. A fog computing\
    \ device is\nusually implemented on a Single-Board Computer (SBC), which is essentially\
    \ a reduced-size low-cost\ncomputer (e.g., Raspberry Pi and Orange Pi PC) that\
    \ can be easily deployed in the campus facilities.\nFinally, the third and more\
    \ evolved architecture of Figure 2 is the one at the bottom, on the right,\nwhich\
    \ illustrates a typical edge computing smart campus architecture. Such an architecture\
    \ is basically\nan enhanced version of the previously mentioned fog computing-based\
    \ architecture, but through its\nedge computing layer it provides more computing\
    \ power, thanks to the use of cloudlets. A cloudlet is\noften a high-end computer\
    \ that is able to perform compute-intensive tasks, like the ones related to\n\
    complex data processing or image rendering.\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 4479\n6 of 24\n\

    4. Blockchain for Smart Campuses and Universities\nBoth academia [11–13] and public\
    \ entities like the European Commission [46] have recently\nconsidered the improvement\
    \ of the architectures described in the previous section by using Distributed\n\
    Ledger Technologies (DLTs) like blockchain. Such a technology can be used for\
    \ implementing higher\neducation and smart campus applications, due to their ability\
    \ to provide data exchanges among entities\nthat do not necessarily trust each\
    \ other [47]. In addition, the use of blockchain enhance smart campus\napplications\
    \ that need transparency, data immutability, privacy, and security. Furthermore,\
    \ blockchain\nallows for developing Decentralized Apps (DApps) based on Peer-to-Peer\
    \ (P2P) transactions whose\nprocesses can be automated through the use of smart\
    \ contracts, which can execute pieces of code in an\nautonomous way [48].\nNowadays,\
    \ there are many blockchain platforms, like Ethereum [49], Hyperledger Fabric\
    \ [50],\nor the popular Bitcoin [51], that can be used in multiple practical applications\
    \ [52–55]. However, it is\nimportant to emphasize that blockchain is not the best\
    \ technology for every application that needs to\nperform trustworthy data exchanges.\
    \ For example, in many cases where smart campus applications\nare deployed in\
    \ a private network, a traditional database is powerful enough and usually provides\n\
    faster transactions than a blockchain. Therefore, to decide whether a blockchain\
    \ is necessary, smart\ncampus developers may use a decision framework [56] and,\
    \ thus, detect certain necessary features,\nlike the need for decentralization,\
    \ transaction transparency, cybersecurity (e.g., data redundancy and\nprotection\
    \ against Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks), or the lack of trust among entities\
    \ (including\nrespect to government agencies and banks).\nDue to the previously\
    \ mentioned beneﬁts, different authors have proposed the use of blockchain\nand\
    \ other DLTs for developing applications for smart campuses and universities.\n\
    Speciﬁcally,\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 4479\n7 of 24\nblockchain has been suggested\
    \ for guaranteeing education certiﬁcate authenticity [57,58], managing\ndigital\
    \ copyright information [59], verifying learning outcomes [60,61], or enhancing\
    \ e-learning\ninteraction [62]. More potential smart campus applications and a\
    \ deeper analysis on their characteristics\ncan be found in [11–13,46].\n5. Analysis\
    \ of Recent Smart Campus and University Deployments\n5.1. Relevant Deployments\n\
    In the literature, there only a few papers that present descriptions on actual\
    \ smart campuses.\nAn example of such a paper is [63], where the authors detail\
    \ the development of the smart campus of\nToulouse III Paul Sabatier university\
    \ (France). Speciﬁcally, the smart campus is called neOCampus and\ninvolves multiple\
    \ projects able to run on an open data platform that, for instance, can use collaborative\n\
    WiFi. Similarly, in [64], the authors describe a smart campus based on cloud computing,\
    \ SOA, and\nIoT that has been deployed in the Moncloa Campus of International\
    \ Excellence of the Universidad\nPolitécnica de Madrid (Spain). In the mentioned\
    \ article, two applications are detailed: one for\nmonitoring diverse environmental\
    \ parameters, and another for determining people ﬂows inside the\ncampus. A similar\
    \ smart campus is described in [65], where the authors propose an IoT and cloud\n\
    computing based architecture for the Wuhan University of Technology smart campus\
    \ (China) that is\naimed at supporting diverse applications.\nIoT is also key\
    \ in the West Texas A&M University smart campus [66], which is deployed in a\n\
    176-acre land that includes 42 different buildings. Such a smart campus is focused\
    \ on providing\nIoT-related and secure services, and has tested systems for smart\
    \ parking or environmental monitoring.\nAnother interesting work can be found\
    \ in [33], where it is detailed the Birmingham City University\nsmart campus (United\
    \ Kingdom). The aim of the proposed smart campus is essentially to create a\n\
    scalable and ﬂexible SOA architecture where service integration and orchestration\
    \ can be carried out\neasily through the use of an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB).\n\
    Finally, it is worth mentioning the work presented in [67], where it is described\
    \ from a theoretical\npoint of view the smart campus of Sapienza (Rome, Italy),\
    \ including the author’s approach for\nproviding services in a scalable way.\n\
    As a summary, Table 1 shows the main characteristics of the most relevant smart\
    \ campus\ndeployments, including details on their location, size, used hardware,\
    \ and their explicit support\nfor advanced architectures (fog and edge computing\

    \ Applications\nBoth indoor and outdoor applications can be deployed in a smart\
    \ campus/university [8], but such\nsmart applications differ in their requirements.\n\
    The most relevant difference is that, in indoor\nenvironments, IoT nodes can be\
    \ usually powered through the electrical grid and can make use\nof ﬁxed communications\
    \ infrastructure (e.g., Ethernet, WiFi access points). In contrast, outdoors,\
    \ IoT\nnodes usually depend on batteries and need to exchange data at relatively\
    \ long distances (at least\nseveral hundred meters, up to 2 kilometers). The following\
    \ are some of the most relevant applications\nfor both scenarios:\n•\nSmart mobility\
    \ and intelligent transport services. This kind of applications require outdoor\n\
    communications coverage from traditional Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs)\
    \ or speciﬁc\nvehicular networks [71,72].\nFor instance, researchers of Soochow\
    \ University proposed to\nuse in their campus an automatic gate access system\
    \ and diverse services for smart parking,\nbus positioning or for renting bicycles\
    \ [68]. Similar services have been suggested by other\nuniversities for providing\
    \ a smart parking service [73], electric mobility [74,75], smart electric\ncharging\
    \ [76], the use of autonomous vehicles [77], or for locating the campus buses\
    \ [78,79].\n•\nSmart energy and smart grid monitoring. These applications are\
    \ used for controlling and\nmonitoring the generation, distribution, and consumption\
    \ of the campus energy sources (e.g.,\nphotovoltaic systems or wind generators).\
    \ Speciﬁcally, in the last years, multiple authors focused\ntheir research on\
    \ the study of smart campus microgrids [80–82], smart grids [83,84], and smart\n\
    energy systems [85,86].\n•\nResource consumption efﬁciency. The use of the resources\
    \ of a campus can be monitored\nthrough speciﬁc systems for garbage collection\
    \ [87], water management [69], power consumption\nmonitoring [88,89], and other\
    \ solutions aimed at preserving sustainability [16].\n•\nInfrastructure and building\
    \ control and monitoring. The state of certain buildings and assets that\nare\
    \ scattered throughout the campus can be monitored and controlled remotely. For\
    \ instance,\nsolutions have been suggested for monitoring campus greenhouses [90],\
    \ for controlling the\nHeating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems\
    \ of the campus buildings [91] or for\nautomating critical infrastructure supervision\
    \ through Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) [92].\n•\nGreen area monitoring. The\
    \ health of the trees of campus can be monitored remotely through IoT\nsensor-based\
    \ systems [93].\n•\nUser pattern and behavior monitoring. The smart campus services\
    \ and infrastructure can be\noptimized thanks to the analysis of the user patterns\
    \ and behaviors. For instance, mobility\npatterns, user activities, or social\
    \ interactions can be determined through smartphone apps [94,95],\nby monitoring\
    \ WiFi communications [96,97] or by collecting data from smartphone sensors [98],\n\
    wearables, or even garments [99].\n•\nGuidance and context-aware applications.\
    \ These applications often depend on sensors and\nactuators spread across the\
    \ campus and can help people by giving useful contextual information\nand indications\
    \ on how to reach their destination. For instance, there is interesting research\
    \ on\nguidance systems to aid hearing and visually impaired people [100] or for\
    \ navigating the campus\npaths [101,102]. There are also augmented reality applications\
    \ that provide relevant contextual\ninformation on the campus or that are able\
    \ to guide the users through it [103–105].\n•\nClassroom attendance. Different\
    \ student monitoring systems have been proposed, which make\nuse of IoT and artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence to control student classroom attendance [106] and their access\n\
    to sport facilities [107].\n•\nRemote health monitoring. Some of the latest smart\
    \ campus applications are aimed at monitoring\nthe health of certain campus users\
    \ in real-time [108] or at measuring student stress [109] and\nhealth consciousness\
    \ [110].\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 4479\n11 of 24\n•\nSmart card applications. Although\
    \ smart cards have been used for a long time by universities [111],\nthey can\
    \ still provide useful services for a smart campus, like information retrieval,\
    \ mobile\npayments, library usage, access control, or e-learning [112–114].\n\
    Instead of a smart card,\nthe latest developments suggested the use of the Near-Field\
    \ Communications (NFC) interface of\na smartphone to provide the mentioned smart\
    \ campus applications [115]. Due to the multiple\npotential applications of smart\
    \ cards, some authors also proposed to mine the data collected from\nthe student\
    \ transactions to infer their behavior [116,117].\n•\nTeaching and Learning applications.\
    \ The technologies embedded into a smart campus/university\ncan also help students\
    \ to learn through their mobile phones [118] or have an ubiquitous\nuser-centered\
    \ personalized learning and training experience with advanced analytics [119,120].\n\
    These technologies also allow teachers to make use of speciﬁc learning services\
    \ (e.g., online\nprogramming contests [121]), sophisticated online teaching platforms\
    \ [122], and to implement\nnovel teaching paradigms like Flipped Classroom [123]\
    \ or ampliﬁcation [124].\n•\nResearch and innovation activities.\nSmart campus/university\
    \ technologies can be used to\nencourage collaboration and cooperation among people\
    \ (e.g., international networks of living\nlabs). For instance, crowdsourcing\
    \ can be used to collect data of people with different proﬁles\n(e.g., students,\
    \ teachers, researchers, and administrative staff) and create large-scale datasets\
    \ for\nfurther research and novel applications [125].\n•\nCommunity-based knowledge\
    \ transfer applications. Smart campus and university technologies\ncan be explored\
    \ to beneﬁt the global community [126], either by increasing their awareness about\n\
    sustainability issues [127] or by making citizens actively involved as central\
    \ players of smart\nenvironments [128].\n•\nLocation-aware applications. In many\
    \ situations the information given to smart campus users\ndepends on their location.\
    \ Such a location-aware data may include information on content,\nactivities,\
    \ projects, services, tools, knowledge, or events [129–132].\n•\nSecurity services.\n\
    Smart campus managers can make use of the multiple sensors and\nrecording devices\
    \ to monitor the campus status and increase physical security through video\n\
    surveillance [133] and location-aware applications [134]. In addition, it is essential\
    \ to protect the\nprivacy of campus user data when making use of wireless communications\
    \ [135] and preventing\ncyber-attacks [66].\n5.3. Communications Technologies\n\
    In the past, researchers have used diverse technologies for connecting remote\
    \ outdoor IoT nodes\nwith smart campus platforms. Note that such technologies\
    \ may differ a great deal from one scenario\nto another, as the distance to be\
    \ covered and the kind obstacles found in the environment (especially,\nmetallic\
    \ objects [136]), severely condition signal propagation.\nFor instance, in [35],\
    \ the authors propose the design of an IoT-based smart campus that makes\nuse\
    \ of BLE and ZigBee for providing short and medium-range communications. Nonetheless,\
    \ note\nthat ZigBee nodes can act as relays in a ZigBee mesh, so that the exchanged\
    \ information can reach long\ndistances [137].\nWiFi (i.e., the IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac\
    \ standards) is another popular technology that has already\nbeen suggested for\
    \ providing indoor connectivity for smart campuses [64].\nBluetooth beacons\n\
    can be also used in smart campus applications [138,139], but they usually are\
    \ restricted to indoor\nenvironments, as their outdoor use requires the deployment\
    \ of dense networks whose management is\ncomplicated [140].\nAppl. Sci. 2019,\
    \ 9, 4479\n12 of 24\nDue to the popularity of mobile phones, the main cell phone\
    \ communications technologies (i.e.,\n2G/3G/4G) have been suggested for providing\
    \ smart campus services [141,142]. 5G technologies are\nstill being deployed worldwide,\
    \ but their use has already been proposed due to their ability to provide\nfast\
    \ communications and reduce response latency in smart campus applications [122].\n\
    Despite the good perspectives of 5G for the next decade, nowadays, Low-Power Wide\
    \ Area\nNetwork (LPWAN) technologies are arguably one of the best alternatives\
    \ for smart campus applications\nthat require low-power and long-distance IoT\
    \ communications [143]. Some of the most popular\nLPWAN technologies are SigFox\
    \ [144], LoRaWAN [145], and NB-IoT [146], existing other emerging\ntechnologies\
    \ like Ingenu Random Phase Multiple Access (RPMA) [147], Weightless-P [148], or\n\
    NB-Fi [149].\nLoRaWAN deﬁnes the communication protocol and the system architecture\
    \ for the network\nand uses LoRa as the physical layer. Although there are several\
    \ recent works on the application of\nLoRa/LoRaWAN to multiple scenarios [150],\
    \ only a few of them are focused on the deployment of\nsmart campuses services\
    \ [66,70,151–153]. For example, the authors of [152] analyze the indoor and\n\
    outdoor performance of LoRaWAN on a French smart campus. In addition, other researchers\
    \ [153]\nproposed a smart campus air quality system whose communications were\
    \ carried out by LoRaWAN\nnodes. Another example can be found in [70], where the\
    \ authors make use of a radio planning\nsimulator to determine the optimal location\
    \ of LoRaWaN nodes that provide smart campus services in\noutdoor applications.\n\
    There are also short-distance communications technologies that can be useful in\
    \ smart campus\napplications. For instance, ANT+ transceivers are often embedded\
    \ into chest straps to monitor\nperformance and health in sports. Another example\
    \ of popular short-distance communications\ntechnology is Radio Frequency IDentiﬁcation\
    \ (RFID), which is commonly used in university access\ncontrol and payment systems\
    \ [28].\nTable 2 summarizes the main characteristics of the latest and most popular\
    \ communications\ntechnologies for smart campus applications.\nMoreover, Table\
    \ 3 compares the communications\ntechnologies of the most relevant smart campus\
    \ solutions. Such a Table also indicates whether the\nprovided references detail\
    \ the network planning of the proposed solution and, as it can be observed,\n\
    only a couple of works give details about it.\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 4479\n13 of\

    6. Future Challenges\nDespite the evolution of smart campuses and universities\
    \ in the last years thanks to the\ntechnological advances achieved in ﬁelds like\
    \ IoT, cloud computing, and certain communications\nparadigms, future university\
    \ planners, IoT vendors, and developers will still face relevant challenges\n\
    in the following areas.\n•\nScalability. As a campus can cover a large area, where\
    \ a large number of users can request smart\nservices, it is essential for applications\
    \ to be easily scalable in order to adapt its performance to\nthe number of simultaneous\
    \ users.\n•\nService ﬂexibility. A smart campus/university should be able to provide\
    \ multiple services, which\nmay differ depending on the physical area where they\
    \ are provided (e.g., depending on the\nfaculty), on the speciﬁc user that request\
    \ them (e.g., access privileges may differ between a student\nand a professor),\
    \ or on the speciﬁc goal (e.g., advancing to more effective teaching and learning\n\
    services may differ substantially from the design of smart environment applications).\n\
    •\nLong-distance low-power communications. Since campuses usually cover areas\
    \ of thousands\nof square meters that often involve monitoring outdoor smart IoT\
    \ objects (e.g., street lights,\nirrigation systems), it is key to consider in\
    \ the smart campus architecture the use of long-distance\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9,\
    \ 4479\n15 of 24\nwireless communications technologies whose energy consumption\
    \ should be as low as possible\nto maximize IoT node battery life.\n•\nNew communications\
    \ technologies. Although this article has analyzed the currently most relevant\n\
    communications technologies, smart campus designers should be aware of the latest\
    \ advances on\ncommunications in order to include them in the designed architecture.\
    \ For instance, some authors\nare already suggesting potential applications for\
    \ 6G technologies [155,156].\n•\nBlockchain integration. DLTs like blockchain\
    \ can be really useful to guarantee operational\nefﬁciency, data transparency,\
    \ authenticity, and security. This aspect is a key enabler to develop\nnovel decentralized\
    \ smart applications (i.e., DApps) and to leverage new artiﬁcial intelligence\n\
    paradigms such as big data, machine learning, or deep learning. These paradigms\
    \ need to rely\non trustworthy datasets in order to reach their full potential\
    \ and produce new data model-based\napplications.\nNevertheless, smart campus\
    \ designers have to use blockchain with caution,\nconsidering their advantages\
    \ and disadvantages. In addition, the incorrect use of smart contracts\ncan be\
    \ a problem, since they are able to trigger certain automatic behaviors that can\
    \ have serious\neconomic or personal consequences.\n•\nLack of smart campus standards\
    \ and public initiatives. Although, in the last years, smart city\ninitiatives\
    \ have proliferated worldwide, there are only a few speciﬁcally related to smart\
    \ campuses\nand universities. In addition, there is not a common framework for\
    \ designing or deploying them,\nso future developers will have to keep compatibility\
    \ and interoperability issues in mind.\n•\nSeamless integration of outdoor and\
    \ indoor smart campus applications.\nDue to their\ncommunications needs, outdoor\
    \ and indoor applications may differ in the underlying\ntechnologies, so it is\
    \ necessary to design architectures and devices that allow for switching between\n\
    communications transceivers. This means that, although the lower layers of the\
    \ communications\nprotocol may differ, the upper layers are compatible so that\
    \ they are able to provide seamless\ncommunications among users, IoT objects,\
    \ and the computing devices scattered throughout\na campus.\n7. Conclusions\n\
    This article examined how higher education can leverage the opportunities created\
    \ by the latest\nand most relevant IT technologies. After analyzing the basics\
    \ on smart campuses and universities, this\nwork has focused on studying the potential\
    \ of IoT, blockchain, and the most recent communications\narchitectures and paradigms\
    \ (e.g., fog/edge computing) for developing novel smart campus and\nsmart university\
    \ applications. In addition, the latest key deployments as well as their communications\n\
    technologies have been detailed and analyzed. Finally, the main future challenges\

    Graphical Abstract. \nI. \nINTRODUCTION \nIoT is a combination of worldwide data,\
    \ web associated \nitems or things, and is an integral component of the future\
    \ \nInternet. IoT focuses on the automation of processes by \nlessening human\
    \ interaction. In the process of automation, IoT \ncollects data using sensors\
    \ and processes the data using \ncontrollers and completing the automation processes\
    \ by using \nactuators [1], [2]. IoT in agriculture and farming focus is on \n\
    automating all the aspects of farming and agricultural methods \nto make the process\
    \ more efficient and effective. Traditional \napproaches in livestock management\
    \ (such as cattle detection) \nare not fully automated and have many inefficiencies\
    \ such as \nhigher human interaction, labour cost, power consumption, \nand water\
    \ consumption [1], [3], [4], [5], [6]. The central \nconcept of this review is\
    \ to analyse the IoT sub-verticals, \ncollected data for measurements and used\
    \ technologies to \ndevelop applications. It is essential to identify the most\
    \ \nresearched sub-verticals, data collections and technologies to \ncreate new\
    \ IoT applications in the future.  \n \n \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced\

    www.ijacsa.thesai.org \nThis review provides an overall picture of currently \n\
    developed IoT applications in agriculture and farming \nbetween 2016 and 2018.\
    \ \nAs a solution to the existing problems, researchers have \nfocused on smart\
    \ agricultural and farming automated systems \nwith the help of IoT [7], [8],\
    \ [9], [10].  IoT is the network of \nthings which identifies elements clearly\
    \ with the help of \nsoftware intelligence, sensors and ubiquitous connectivity\
    \ to \nthe Internet. In IoT, the data that collects from Internet-\nconnected\
    \ items or things contains with gadgets, sensors and \nactuators [1]. Many researchers\
    \ have focused on smart \nsystems for monitoring and controlling agricultural\
    \ parameters \nby enhancing productivity and efficiency. Smart systems \ncollect\
    \ data for measurements to get accurate results that can \nlead to appropriate\
    \ actions. Current use of smart agricultural \nsystems relates to collecting data\
    \ on environmental parameters \nsuch as temperature, humidity, soil moisture and\
    \ pH [11], \n[12], [13]. With accurate sensor data collection using a range \n\
    of different sensors, researchers have implemented smart \nagricultural systems\
    \ to make the farm process more effective \n[9], [14]. Research has mainly focused\
    \ on sub-verticals such \nas water management, crop management and smart farming\
    \ to \nmake processes automated by reducing human intervention, \ncosts, power\
    \ consumption and water consumption. \nThe automation process of agricultural\
    \ and farming \nreduced human interaction and improve the efficiency. The \nreason\
    \ for that is every country population depends on \nagriculture thus consumers\
    \ of these resources should use water \nand land resources optimally [19], [20].\
    \ Moreover, it is \nimperative to have good quality production and crop \nmanagement\
    \ in order to maximize profitability. Hence, IoT \nbase agricultural management\
    \ systems are integral for an \nagriculturally based country. The new systems\
    \ developed \nusing IoT technologies have reduced the drawbacks associated \n\
    with traditional approaches and provided many advantages to \nfarmers. For example,\
    \ IoT-based water management systems \ncollect environmental attributes such as\
    \ temperature, water \nlevel and humidity through the sensors and provide accurate\
    \ \nirrigation timing [19], [21]. In addition, crop management \nsystems developed\
    \ using IoT monitor the temperature, \nhumidity and soil through sensors thus\
    \ providing adequate \ninformation so that farmers can manage the crops \nappropriately\
    \ [25]. Overall, these IoT-based systems help to \nreduce human interaction, power\
    \ utilization and reduce cost in \nthe field of agriculture. Moreover, IoT-based\
    \ agricultural \nrelated applications have been used in the area of pest control,\
    \ \nweather monitoring, nutrient management and greenhouse \nmanagement. \nIoT\
    \ for agriculture uses sensors to collect big data on the \nagricultural environment.\
    \ It discovers, analyses and deals with \nmodels built upon big data to make the\
    \ development of \nagriculture more sustainable [34]. IoT can provide efficient\
    \ \nand low-cost solutions to the collection of data. Weather, \nWater Scarcity,\
    \ Soil fertility and Pesticides are the significant \nplayers in it. IoT will\
    \ make agriculture beneficiary. \nAgriculture and farming depend on water [35].\
    \ Farmers \ndepend on rainfall for all their agricultural needs. \nFertilizer\
    \ also plays a very significant role in the field of \nagriculture by helping\
    \ to increase the productivity of plants \n[36]. By using IoT, farmers can manage\
    \ soil condition more \neffectively and at less expense by monitoring them from\
    \ any \nlocation [37]. The primary objective of this study is how IoT \nand technologies\
    \ are used in conserving water, fertiliser and \nenergy in the agricultural industry\
    \ by combining new \ntechnologies. This has benefits for the development of the\
    \ \neconomy of countries as well as the wealth of the people [38]. \nWith the\
    \ combination of both advanced technologies in \nhardware and software, IoT can\
    \ track and count all relevant \naspects of production which can reduce the waste,\
    \ loss and \ncost [39]. The information needed to make smart decisions can \n\
    be obtained merely by using electronic devices [40]. IoT \ntransforms the agricultural\
    \ industry and enables farmers to \novercome different challenges. Innovative\
    \ applications can \naddress these issues and therefore increase the quality,\
    \ \nquantity, sustainability and cost-effectiveness of crop \nproduction [41],\
    \ [42], [43]. IoT provides more benefits to the \nfarming industry by improving\
    \ the health of animals through \nbetter food and environment, addressing the\
    \ labour shortage \nissue as well cost savings through automation, increase in\
    \ milk \nproduction, and increase in some animals during the breeding \nperiod\
    \ through detection of estrus cycle and additional \nrevenue streams from waste.\
    \ \nOur \nstudy \nhas \nanalyzed \nrecently \ndeveloped \nIoT \napplications in\
    \ the fields of agriculture and farming to address \ncurrent issues such as unnecessary\
    \ human interaction leading \nto higher labour cost, unnecessary water consumption\
    \ and \nwater-saving measures for the future, higher energy \nconsumption, energy-saving\
    \ measures for the future and crop \nmonitoring difficulties. According to our\
    \ analysis, we can \nidentify a focus on water and crop management as sub-\nverticals\
    \ in the agriculture and farming sectors. This survey \nalso focusses on other\
    \ agriculture and farming sub-verticals to \nidentify the gap between IoT application\
    \ developments in the \nleast researched areas. The IoT generates enormous data,\
    \ so-\ncalled big data (high volume, at a different speed and different \nvarieties\
    \ of data) in varying data quality. Analysing the IoT \nsystem and its key attributes\
    \ are the key to advancing smart \nIoT utilization. Therefore, the primary aim\
    \ of our paper is to \nexplore recently created IoT applications in the agriculture\
    \ and \nfarming industry to give the more profound understanding \nabout sensor\
    \ data collection, used technologies, and sub-\nverticals, for example, water\
    \ and crop management. The \nsecondary aim of this study is to analyse the current\
    \ issues \nsuch as higher human interaction, high labour cost, higher \nwater\
    \ consumption and save water for future, higher energy \nconsumption and save\
    \ energy/electricity for future, crop \nmonitoring difficulties in IoT for agriculture\
    \ and farming. \nThe remainder of this paper is as follows: In Section II we \n\
    include raw data collection methodology, data inclusion \ncriteria, and data analysis\
    \ methods. Finally, the results of \nAgriculture and Farming based on IoT Sub\
    \ verticals, Sensor \nData, and Technologies are presented in Section III, and\
    \ in \nSection IV we discuss the results. Section V concludes the \npaper. The\
    \ raw data collected from 60 peer-reviewed \npublications used in this paper are\
    \ summarised in Table I. \n \n \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer\

    \ \nII. MATERIALS AND METHODS \nData collection involves identifying important\
    \ criteria in \nresearch articles on the Internet of Things (IoT) in the \nagriculture\
    \ and farming sectors.  \nAs shown in Table I, these essential criteria were used\
    \ to \nanalyse relevant research papers. In particular, 60 peer-\nreviewed scientific\
    \ publications on IoT in the agriculture and \nfarming sectors published in scientific\
    \ journals between 2016 \nand 2018 were used. \n1) Collection of raw data: The\
    \ data gathered for this \nreview is from 60 peer-reviewed publications (2016-2018)\
    \ \nthat were collected from the IEEE database. All these \npublications have\
    \ different data applications that have been \nstudied and analyzed in this survey.\
    \ The attributes compared \nwere sub-verticals, data collection measurements,\
    \ used \ntechnologies, challenges in current approach, benefits, \ncountries and\
    \ drivers of IoT. \n2) Data inclusion criteria: To evaluate the data inclusion\
    \ \ncriteria a comparison table was drawn to include as the \nfollowing attributes:\
    \ Author, Sub vertical, Data collection \nmeasurements, Technologies, Benefits,\
    \ Challenges, Solutions \nand Drivers of IoT. Nevertheless, in our study, articles\
    \ were \nexcluded when the selected attributes were not present. In our \nanalysis,\
    \ the number of sensors, amount of data collected, \nunderlying \ntechnologies,\
    \ \nsensor \ntopology \nand \nother \nintermediate gateways were not included\
    \ since no information \ncan find with all the peer-reviewed publications (2016-2018).\
    \ \n3) Data analysis: We pooled and analyzed the reported \nstudies based on data\
    \ collected through peer reviewed articles \nand displaying emerging themes in\
    \ a table. The data sets \nincluded attributes such as Sub vertical, Data collection\
    \ \nmeasurements, Technologies, Benefits, Challenges, Solutions, \nCountries focused\
    \ on automation of the agriculture proses and \nDrivers of IoT. The descriptive\
    \ details of the study based on \nthe publication year were analyzed to observe\
    \ the results from \n2016 to 2018. \nIII. RESULTS \nThis review aims to analyse\
    \ the incorporation of IoT for \nthe development of applications in the agriculture\
    \ and farming \nsectors. The study focuses on sub-verticals and collecting data\
    \ \nfor measurements and technologies in the field of agriculture \nand farming\
    \ to increase productivity and efficiency with the \nhelp of the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT). This study of IoT in \nagriculture and farming focuses on developing\
    \ a criterion \napproach with the help of agricultural environmental \nparameters\
    \ and IoT measures and technologies. In the field of \nagriculture, there are\
    \ many environmental parameters that \nneed to be considered to enhance crops,\
    \ reduce water \nconsumption and human involvement [44]. Moreover, there \nare\
    \ many sub-verticals that can be identified depending on the \ndifferences in\
    \ approach. \nIn this review, we have gathered articles which have \nfocused on\
    \ agricultural and farming sub-verticals from 2016 to \n2018. As shown in Fig.\
    \ 1, 23 sub-verticals were found \naccording to the results obtained and the topmost\
    \ area was \nwater management (28.08%). \nAs IoT depends on sensor data collections,\
    \ a vast amount \nof data needs to be gathered to identify or predict accurate\
    \ \nresults. This study indicates that many researchers have \nfocused on environmental\
    \ temperature (24.87%), humidity \n(19.79%) and soil moisture (15.73%) as environmental\
    \ \nmeasurements. As shown in Fig. 2, 28 types of data were \ncollected for measurements\
    \ with environmental temperature \nand humidity being considered the most critical\
    \ parameters for \nagriculture and farming. \nAs shown in Fig. 3, we have categorised\
    \ all technologies \nused in the articles. This study has identified Wi-Fi as\
    \ the \nmost used technology (30.27%) followed by Mobile \nTechnology (21.10%)\
    \ for both agriculture and farming. \nZigBee, another data transfer technology,\
    \ is also used but to a \nlesser extent. \nAccording to Fig. 4, the use of IoT\
    \ was more prominent in \nthe agriculture industry than the farming industry (Agriculture\
    \ \n– 76.1%, Farming – 23.8%). \n \nFig. 1. Agriculture and Farming Sub Verticals:\

    \ \nIn this review we have identified important attributes to \nanalyse the research\
    \ findings in agriculture and farming \nprocesses. We have gathered and analyzed\
    \ data by using 60 \nrecent scientific articles. Our survey shows the most \n\
    researched \nsub-verticals are \nwater \nmanagement, crop \nmanagement and smart\
    \ farming. Water management is the \nmost researched sub-vertical for the last\
    \ few years as most \ncountries mainly focus on the utilization of water resources\
    \ \ndue to its lack of abundance [61]. Irrigation patterns in \nagriculture influence\
    \ crop production making irrigation \nmanagement a central focus to increase productivity\
    \ [8], [10].  \nThe second most considered sub-vertical is crop management \n\
    due to the importance of producing food for a growing global \npopulation. It\
    \ is important to manage the quality, quantity and \neffectiveness of the agricultural\
    \ production for sustainability \n[13]. Although a study [18] discussed that the\
    \ widely used \nsensor data collections for measurements are soil conditions as\
    \ \npH and humidity, as per our analysis it shows environmental \ntemperature\
    \ followed by humidity and soil moisture are the \nmost commonly measured data.\
    \ \nIoT can further be defined as a fusion of heterogeneous \nnetworks including\
    \ chip technology that scopes gradually \nmore and more, expanding due to the\
    \ rapid growth of Internet \napplications such as logistics, agriculture, smart\
    \ community, \nintelligent transposition, control and tracking systems. \nAccording\
    \ to researchers’ analysis, in 2020 IoT objects will be \nsemi-intelligent and\
    \ an important part of human social life \n[46]. As analyzed in our review Wi-Fi,mobile\
    \ technology are \nthe technologies which have a wide range of demand in \nagriculture\
    \ and farming domain to monitor land and water \nresources in contrast to other\
    \ technologies [33], [35]. \nAlthough our results demonstrate the results in such\
    \ a way, a \nstudy [62] analyzed that use of RFID, a Wireless Sensor \nNetwork\
    \ (WSN) technology that can be effectively used to \nincrease the crop production\
    \ to meet the growing needs of the \nincreasing population. In developing countries\
    \ with limited \nInternet speed, the other IoT technologies utilised rather than\
    \ \nWi-Fi include Low-Power, Short-Range IoT Networks, low-\nrate wireless PAN\
    \ (LoRaWAN) or Low-Power and Wide-\nArea Networks. \nFurther research [61] shows\
    \ that WSN is used in many \napplications \nsuch \nas \nhealth \nmonitoring, \n\
    agriculture, \nenvironmental monitoring, and military applications whereas \n\
    our study demonstrates the agriculture sector using IoT in and \nfarming sector\
    \ using IoT. Our observations show that \nAgriculture is the primary source of\
    \ income in developing \ncountries, such as India with the sizeable geographical\
    \ area \nwhen comparing with other countries [9]. \nMost of the research studies\
    \ have performed on water \nmanagement by monitoring such environmental parameters\
    \ as \ntemperature, humidity and soil moisture [1], [3], [5], [19], \n[25]. Many\
    \ of the findings have focused on better water \nutilization, reduction inhuman\
    \ intervention and the cost of \nproduction [18], [27]. Future research could\
    \ draw more \nattention to further automate current processes in waste \nmanagement,\
    \ smart lightening and pest controlling sub-\nverticals by reducing existing drawbacks\
    \ since it has received \nthe least research attention in the considered period.\
    \ Fog \ncomputing, as an innovation with cross over any barrier \nbetween remote\
    \ data centres and IoT devices, should be \nconsidered in future IoT analysis\
    \ [63], [64], [65], [66], [67]. \nWhile IoT has solved many issues related to\
    \ agriculture and \nfarming there are limitations that we need to consider. Lack\
    \ of \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,\
    \ \nVol. 10, No. 4, 2019 \n25 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \ninteroperability\
    \ and compatibility in devices, network \nflexibility issues when more devices\
    \ are connecting, and \nsensor lifetime is some of the limitations to be addressed\
    \ in \nfuture research. \nThis study has found that industry 4.0 in agriculture\
    \ \nfocuses on IoT aspects transforming the production \ncapabilities including\
    \ the agricultural domain. This study has \n[68] considered soil quality, irrigation\
    \ levels, weather, the \npresence of insects and pests as sensor data. Some of\
    \ the \nsignificant aspects they have been researched are the driver’s \nassistance\
    \ to optimise routes and shorten harvesting and crop \ntreatment while reducing\
    \ fuel consumption CISCO [69]. \nProducing enough food for the entire world is\
    \ a big challenge \nsince the global population is rapidly changing as well as\
    \ \nclimate change and labour shortage. Currently researchers \nhave focused more\
    \ on robotics to address these problems. A \ngrowing number of researchers and\
    \ companies have focused \non Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to weeding\
    \ by \nreducing the amount of herbicide used by farmers. \nIn contrast to edge\
    \ computing, cloud computing requires a \nhigh-speed internet connection with\
    \ sending and retrieving \ndata from the cloud. As the process involves transferring\
    \ and \nreceiving data from the cloud, the process is time-consuming. \nSince\
    \ the data capacity is higher than bandwidth, it is always \nessential to process\
    \ data locally instead of sending data to the \ncloud. Edge computing is more\
    \ efficient than cloud processing \nwhen processing data since the capacity doubles\
    \ faster than \nthe bandwidth doubles [70]. Since IoT uses sensor data \ncollection\
    \ for decision making, to process collected data, the \ncloud, or the edge based\
    \ can be used on the system \nrequirements. \nStill, there are some challenges\
    \ associated with IoT system \ndeployment. Connecting so many devices to the IoT\
    \ network \nis the biggest challenge in the future following lack of \ntechnical\
    \ knowledge among farmers, current centralised \narchitecture to support IoT systems\
    \ is not much advanced as \nthe growth of the network, centralised systems will\
    \ turn into a \nbottleneck. Moreover, sensor battery capacity and lifetime and\
    \ \nsensor data storage also more concentrated when IoT system \ndeployment. Smart\
    \ farming is the association with new \nadvancements in technologies and the different\
    \ crop and \nlivestock, agriculture and farming in the digital age. Smart \nfarming\
    \ can deliver agriculture more beneficial for the farmer. \nThis is because decreasing\
    \ input resources will save farmers' \nmoney and labour, and hence, will increase\
    \ reliability [71] and \nbusiness outcome [72], [73]. \nFurthermore, studying\
    \ diverse approaches for fog \ncomputing structure [63], decision making using\
    \ prediction or \npattern analysis [74], [75], [76], big data databases [77] could\
    \ \nbe an exciting way to make the Internet of Things (IoT) into \nthe future\
    \ dominating technology. \nThis survey will fill the gap by the identification\
    \ of the \ndifferent IoT sub-verticals and data collections for the \nmeasurements\
    \ in the agriculture and farming process. Results \nare clearly showing that most\
    \ considered sub-verticals and \ndata collections for measurements in the field\
    \ of agriculture \nand farming. Our study also indicates the technologies used\
    \ \nfor IoT application development in the reviewed period. To \nsummarise this\
    \ survey, this has broader knowledge about IoT \napplications developed for automating\
    \ the agriculture and \nfarming process. Moreover, this study identifies most\
    \ \nconsidered \nsub-verticals, \ncollected \nsensor \ndata \nand \ntechnologies\
    \ for the development of IoT based applications in \nagriculture and farming sector\
    \ towards the significant \nimprovement of the business. \nTable II shows the\

    \ \n(2016–2018) \nin \ndiscussing \nthe \npotential \napplications of the Internet\
    \ of Things, it was found that water \nmanagement is the highest considered IoT\
    \ sub-vertical \nfollowed by crop management, smart farming, livestock \nmanagement,\
    \ and irrigation management with the same \npercentage. As per the observation,\
    \ the most critical sensor \ndata collection for the measurement is environmental\
    \ \ntemperature, environmental humidity and also there are some \nother such sensor\
    \ data also gathered for IoT applications as \nsoil moisture and soil pH. Wi-Fi\
    \ has the highest demand of \nusage in agriculture and farming industry, followed\
    \ by mobile \ntechnology.  Other technologies as ZigBee, RFID, Raspberry \npi,\
    \ WSN, Bluetooth, LoRa and GPRS have less demand in the \nagriculture and farming\
    \ sectors. When compared to the \nagricultural sector, farming industry has a\
    \ lesser percentage \namount using IoT for the automation. This survey could be\
    \ \nuseful for researchers for finding new ways and solution to \nchallenge in\
    \ the current agricultural era and for agricultural \nand farming industries to\

    ratio of the leaf area to a given unit of land area, is an essential parameter
    to describe plant productivity and make management decisions. Most methods for
    estimating the LAI are not suitable for practical agricultural management at the
    field scale due to delayed availability of data, high costs, or inaccuracy at
    late growth stages. Therefore, a new approach for rapid LAI mapping by ground-based
    laser rangefinders mounted on a vehicle was evaluated. Two types of laser rangefinders
    were tested in various configurations. Field trials were conducted to evaluate
    whether these sensors were capable of capturing temporal and spatial variability
    of LAI, biomass, and crop height. Crops included in the trials were winter wheat
    (Triticum aestivum L.), winter rye (Secale cereale L.), and oilseed rape (Brassica
    napus L. ssp. napus). Correlation coefficients ranging from 0.3 to more than 0.9
    (Pearson''s r) between sensor readings, LAI, and biomass were observed. Best correlations
    were achieved with the time-of-flight based rangefinder in winter wheat. This
    study demonstrated that vehicle-based laser distance sensors offer potential for
    rapid mapping of LAI in crops. The sensors are robust and allow for real-time
    data processing. It is anticipated that they will become affordable in the near
    future, for example, due to mass production for collision avoidance in automobile
    industry. Thus, vehicle-based laser distance sensors might be used for precision
    agriculture applications like fertilizing, crop protection, and yield prediction.

    NDVI normalized difference vegetation index r Pearson''s linear correlation coefficient
    ρ Spearman''s rank correlation coefficient The LAI is a dimensionless parameter
    describing the ratio of half of the leaf area to a given unit of land area (Watson,
    1947). It is an important parameter to quantify many biological and physical processes.
    There is a functional relationship between LAI and gross net photosynthesis (Bunce,
    1989; Running, 1990; Campbell,1996) and crop growth rate (Larcher, 1980; Machado
    et al., 2002), The LAI can be related to several crop properties such as number
    of plants, plant height, and biomass (Ganguli et al., 2000). Consequently, it
    can help to optimize crop management (e.g., Teruel et al., 1997; Wilhelm et al.,
    2000; Kennedy and Hutchinson, 2001; Wallach et al., 2001; Jongschaap, 2006). The
    LAI has been shown to be particularly useful in precision agriculture, which considers
    the within-field variability of soils and crops (e.g., Yang and Anderson, 1999;
    Machado et al., 2002; Guan and Nutter, 2002; Johnson et al., 2003). Precision
    agriculture is composed of a set of technologies that combines sensors, information
    systems, enhanced machinery, and information management to optimize production
    by accounting for variability and uncertainty within agricultural systems (Gebbers
    and Adamchuk, 2010). Adapting production inputs site-specifically within a field
    allows for better use of resources to maintain the quality Of the environment
    while improving the sustainability of the food supply. In the framework of precision
    agriculture, the LAI can be helpful for site-specific adaption of the application
    rates of N fertilizers, growth regulators, and fungicides. For example, application
    of fungicides according to the LAI provides optimum leaf cover, which guarantees
    sufficient effectiveness of the chemicals while also reducing soil contamination
    (Dammer and Ehlert, 2006). The leaf area can only be measured directly by destructive
    and time-consuming laboratory methods (Bréda, 2003; Jonckheere et al., 2004).
    After clipping the planimetric area of individual parts of the plant is obtained,
    usually by image analysis in the laboratory. A nondestructive and slightly less
    time-consuming approach is the point quadrat method, which, according to Goodall
    (1952), can be dated back to Cockayne (1926). Long needles (point quadrats) are
    passed through the stand, and the number of contacts made with the foliage by
    each needle is recorded (Warren Wilson, 1959). For more rapid investigations in
    the field, several nondestructive scientific instruments are available providing
    estimates of the LAI by indirect noncontact methods (Jonckheere et al., 2004).
    These instruments measure the incoming light above and below the canopy (Fig.
    1). The LAI is estimated by the ratio of the light intensities. Typical LAI meters
    have to be operated manually in a stop-and-go mode. During a single measurement,
    the instrument must be kept still, and measurements must be repeated several times
    to obtain a reliable estimate for one location. Contrary to spectral reflectance
    methods, as discussed in the next paragraph, these LAI meters are still sensitive
    when LAI is relatively high. Figure 1 Open in figure viewer Nondestructive measurement
    of the leaf area index (LAI) with the SunScan SS1 (Delta-T Devices, Cambridge,
    UK) equipment. The direct laboratory procedure and field methods mentioned above
    are expensive in both labor and time. To cover large areas within a reasonable
    time, remote sensing image analysis is used for LAI determination. This is usually
    done by analyzing canopy reflection in the visible and near infrared range of
    the spectrum (e.g., Asrar et al., 1984; Boegh et al., 2002; Scotford and Miller,
    2005; Darvishzadeh et al., 2008; Houborg et al., 2009). Typically, the normalized
    difference vegetation index (NDVI) is used for LAI estimation (Asrar et al., 1984;
    Huete and Jackson, 1988), (1) where NIR is the reflection in the near infrared
    range (0.7–1.1 μm) and R is the reflection in the red range (0.6–0.7 μm) of the
    electromagnetic spectrum. Large areas can be covered quickly by images from satellites
    and aircrafts. However, air- or space-borne remote sensing is affected by weather
    conditions and may be unable to provide timely information to perform research
    and crop management tasks. Furthermore, it becomes increasingly difficult to estimate
    LAI by canopy reflectance methods after canopy closure (LAI > 1) (Scotford and
    Miller, 2004). With increasing LAI, reflectance based indices become saturated.
    For instance, Asrar et al. (1984) and Scotford and Miller (2004) observed in wheat
    that LAI larger than three cannot be differentiated by the NDVI. Ground based,
    air- or space-borne laser systems can be used to describe morphological vegetation
    characteristics by measuring the distance between the sensor and the target (Hodgson
    et al., 2003; Kraus, 2004; Jensen et al., 2008; Jones et al., 2008; Falkowski
    et al., 2009; Hosoi and Omasa, 2009; Zhao et al., 2009). Air- or space-borne laser
    systems are capable of analyzing forest canopy, but they are not very suitable
    for online acquisition of LAI in agricultural crops. Because they have a relatively
    large footprint (more than 30 cm), they are not able to separate soil and canopy
    in dense crops (Kraus, 2004; Hosoi and Omasa, 2009). In research, stationary ground-based
    scanning and nonscanning (fixed beam) lasers with a much finer resolution (<1cm)
    have been applied to canopy measurement and 3-D reconstruction (Hosoi and Omasa,
    2009). These sophisticated systems require postprocessing of data and costs for
    buying and operating these systems are high. For applications in agriculture,
    LAI mapping must be productive, robust, and cost-efficient, and it must deliver
    data in real time. Real-time availability of LAI data is essential because crop
    protection and N fertilization are time-critical measures in agriculture. For
    these applications, systems with real-time sensors were preferred by farmers.
    Until now, ground-based sensors mounted on a vehicle appear to have the highest
    potential of meeting these requirements (Heege et al., 2008). The Yara N-Senor
    (Yara GmbH & Co. KG, Dülmen, Germany) was the first commercial optical sensor
    designed to be placed on a tractor and to control N application by a fertilizer
    spreader in real time (Heege and Reusch, 1996). The Yara N-Sensor consists of
    a spectroradiometer, from which the red-edge inflection point and the NDVI are
    calculated. Other sensors that are regularly used in practice are the Crop Circle
    (New Holland Scientific Inc., Lincoln, NE) and the GreenSeeker (Ntech Industries
    Inc., Ukiah, CA) (Hong et al., 2007). Recently, Li et al. (2010) tested digital
    color cameras to estimate the LAI and other crop parameters. These spectral reflectance
    sensors represent an improvement toward online control of agricultural chemicals
    application. However, they are limited in LAI detection after canopy closure.
    Among others, Asrar et al. (1984), Aparicio et al. (2000), Heege et al. (2008),
    Li et al. (2010), and Scotford and Miller (2004) pointed out that the correspondence
    of the NDVI and other vegetation indices with the LAI is restricted. To overcome
    this limitation of optical reflection intensity analysis, other methods have been
    considered. Dammer and Ehlert (2006) discussed the application of a mechanical
    sensor, known as the Crop Meter (Agrocom GmbH & Co. Agrarsysteme KG, Bielefeld,
    Germany). Further research is focused on ultrasonic sensors (Scotford and Miller,
    2004) and mobile laser scanners (Palacin et al., 2007; Thomsen and Schelde, 2007;
    Ehlert et al., 2008). In this study, we analyzed a new method for estimating the
    real-time LAI in agriculture by using a vehicle-mounted laser distance sensor.
    While being driven over the field, the sensor obtains distance readings from the
    crop and soil surfaces (when there is a gap between the leaves) (Fig. 2). Evaluations
    of these signals yield the reflection height hR, (Fig. 2) which is useful for
    describing the morphology of crop stands (Ehlert et al., 2008). The average hR
    measured at several locations within a small area such as 1 m2 should theoretically
    be a function of plant morphology (leaf area, leaf orientation, plant height)
    and plant density. It was hypothesized that there is a correlation between the
    average reflection height and the LAI because the LAI increases with plant height
    and canopy closure. Our study compared the measurements of a portable LAI meter
    and hR readings of vehicle-mounted laser rangefinders in oilseed rape, winter
    rye, and winter wheat. The objectives of the research were to analyze the relations
    between LAI and hR over (i) crop type, (ii) time, and (iii) space, to evaluate
    (iv) the repeatability of hR measurements under field conditions, (v) the influence
    of sensor arrangement (inclination angle), and (vi) the performance of two types
    of laser rangefinders. Figure 2 Open in figure viewer Principle of measuring morphological
    crop parameters by a laser rangefinder. MATERIALS AND METHODS Laser Rangefinders
    A laser distance sensor emits a beam of near-monochromatic, nonscattering (coherent)
    light with high energy density. If the light is reflected from a target, distance
    information is extracted by either the triangulation or the time-of-flight principle
    (Hosoi and Omasa, 2009). Triangulation type sensors evaluate the spatial shift
    between the emitted laser beam and the reflected beam caused by diffuse reflection
    of the target by an optical array. The sensor enclosures, the emitted laser, and
    the reflected light form a triangle, which explains the name “triangulation principle”
    (Ehlert et al., 2008). Time-of-flight sensors analyze the time it takes to travel
    from the sensor to the target and return. The time-of-flight methods are usually
    based on pulsed laser beams, whereas other, more sophisticated methods are based
    on modulated beams. In some of the time-of-flight sensors, the emitted and reflected
    beams are using the same path. In these cases, the beams are coaxial. These time-of-flight
    sensors have advantages over the triangulation type sensors because using the
    same path avoids trouble caused by obstacles that are slightly beside the path
    of the emitted beam, which can cause a deflection or absorption of the reflected
    beam in the case of the triangulation sensors. However, triangulation sensors
    are regarded as more precise when measuring over short distances. Some modern
    laser sensors are operating with small beam diameters (in the millimeter range),
    high measuring frequency, and high energy density to compensate for ambient light.
    These compensations are important to receive distinct signals from measurements
    on-the-go under environmental conditions which are often difficult due to dust
    and ambient light. In the trials presented here, two laser rangefinders were used.
    The Lase ODS 1600 HT 2-select is a triangulation type sensor manufactured by LASE
    GmbH, Wesel, Germany. It is a modified version of the ODS 1400 with enhanced power,
    increased measuring distance and a smaller housing. The second sensor was the
    Acuity AccuRange 4000-LIR from Schmitt Measurement Systems Inc., Portland, OR.
    The Acuity sensor uses the coaxial modulated beam time-of-flight technology. The
    characteristics of the sensors are summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Specifications

    The Sensor System The sensors were mounted on a Hege tool carrier (Fig. 3) that
    was used because of minimum crop damage due to its high ground clearance of approximately
    0.8 m. Sensor readings and inclination (in the scanning mode, see below) were
    collected at 5000 Hz using DasyLab based data acquisition software on a laptop
    PC (DasyLab, measX GmbH & Co KG, Mönchengladbach, Germany). Coordinates of a differential
    global positioning system (dGPS) were stored every second (Trimble, AgGPS with
    OMNISTAR correction, Trimble Navigation Ltd, Sunnyvale, CA). Distance readings
    of the laser rangefinders were converted to heights, which were subsequently averaged
    over time intervals of 1 s and attributed to the GPS positions. As shown in Fig.
    2, the measured reflection distance lR depends on crop parameters such as height,
    density, and shape, the sensor inclination (zentithal angle) ϕ, and the aboveground
    sensor height hS. To obtain the reflection height hR of the crop, the influences
    of hS and ϕ must be regarded according to Eq. [2]: (2) The crops under investigation
    are usually seeded in narrow rows (approximately 14 cm row spacing for cereals),
    and it is possible that a zenithal laser beam was preferentially hitting the intrarow
    area, thus producing biased measurements of the reflection distance of the canopy.
    An oblique orientation of the laser beam could likely prevent this problem. Therefore,
    different inclination angles were used to investigate whether inclination of the
    laser influences the results. The sensors were arranged as either fixed at 0°
    (zenithal), fixed at 30° (oblique), or oscillating between −15 and +15° (scanning
    mode). Warren Wilson (1959) suggested 57.5° as the optimum zenith angle (ϕ). However,
    due to our experiences the accuracy in determining hR decreased with increasing
    ϕ because of the shaking caused by the moving vehicle. Due to the same reason,
    localization of measurement points becomes less accurate when ϕ increases. Figure
    3 Open in figure viewer (left) The Hege tool carrier in 2005 and (right) the mounting
    of laser sensors onto the height control unit in 2006. Field Trials Field trials
    were conducted in 2005 and 2006 on commercial fields. The fields were located
    in northeast Germany, approximately 40 km east of Berlin (52°27'' N, 13°01'' E).
    The average annual precipitation in this area is 592 mm, and the average temperature
    is 8.7°C. The soil texture is predominantly sandy with considerable small-scale
    variation due to the glacial and postglacial origin of the parent material. The
    main soil types are Dystric Arenosols, Leptic Cambisols, Dystic Leptosols, Albic
    Arenosols, and Humic Gleysols. Trials in 2005 Research in 2005 focused on the
    temporal relationships between the sensor readings and LAI. The reference LAI
    was obtained by a SunScan SS1 LAI meter (Delta-T Devices Ltd, Cambridge, UK) (Fig.
    1). From April to June 145 runs were performed in oilseed rape, winter rye, and
    winter wheat. Growth stages ranged from BBCH 31 to 79 for oilseed rape, BBCH 31
    to 69 for winter rye, and BBCH 31 to 61 for winter wheat (see Meier, 1997 for
    BBCH code). In these tests, we were restricted to the Lase triangulation sensor
    because this was the only sensor available to us at that time. During the test
    runs, the sensor beam was directed vertically on the ground (ϕ = 0°) or inclined
    (ϕ = 30°) (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 left). Ground speed during the measurements was 2
    m s−1, and readings were taken only at the test plots. The sensor height, hS for
    each plot was obtained by an additional run with the distance sensor after harvesting
    and removing the plants from the plots. Trials in 2006 In 2006, only the spatial
    relationships were studied after the sensor system was optimized, and a second
    laser rangefinder was introduced. Improvement of the system was achieved by an
    automatic height control unit. In addition to the Lase sensor, an Acuity rangefinder
    was used. Both sensors were mounted side by side taking readings at approximately
    the same locations (Fig. 3 right). The tests were performed in winter rye at BBCH
    51 (17 May 2006, field Schneiderfichten) and winter wheat at BBCH 47 to 55 (6
    June 2006, field Heineberg). Laser distance readings were averaged over 1 s while
    the tool carrier was driving at approximately 1.3 m s−1. Positions were recorded
    by a dGPS Trimble AgGPS132. After investigating the mapping results, test plots
    were selected in each field to obtain a wide range of spatial variation in reflection
    height. Two runs were performed with the sensors in a fixed zenithal position
    (ϕ = 0°). A second series of runs was performed in the scanning mode where the
    inclination of the sensors was oscillating between −15° and +15°. Due to the height
    control unit, the sensor height (hS) above ground level was kept constant even
    though ground level in and between the wheel tracks may be diverging (Ehlert et
    al., 2006). Reference Measurements The test plots for reference measurements were
    selected between the wheel tracks of a tramline. The width of the plots was approximately
    1.15 m, and the length was 10 m in 2005 and 2 m in 2006. The reference LAI was
    obtained by averaging 10 replicated measurements per plot with the SunScan SS1
    LAI meter. To evaluate crop biomass, plots were hand harvested. The area of each
    plot was measured by a ruler. The weight of fresh biomass was obtained in the
    field by using a handheld electronic scale. Fresh matter density (FM, kg m−2)
    was calculated based on the area of the plots. In 2006 the plots were geo-referenced
    by a handheld dGPS Garmin GPS60 (Garmin Ltd., Olathe, KS) with EGNOS differential
    service. Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was performed using Systat
    12.0 (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA), Matlab (The Mathworks, Nattick, MA)
    and Surfer 8.0 (Golden Software, Golden, CO). The mapping results and reference
    plots in 2006 were not always exactly co-located, because positioning errors could
    have occurred due to GPS errors (4 m is in the range of the typical accuracy of
    the Garmin dGPS). Thus, spatially weighted correlation and regression was calculated
    between the mobile laser readings and reference measurements at the plots. Laser
    readings within a distance of 4 m were included in this analysis. Weights were
    derived from the inverse distances between the laser and the plot positions. To
    account for measurement errors in both variables, (spatially weighted) orthogonal
    regression was applied (Gentle, 2002). For correlation analysis, Pearson''s linear
    coefficient r and Spearman''s rank coefficient ρ were calculated. Spearman''s
    rank coefficient can handle monotonic nonlinear relationships. Independent correlation
    coefficients were compared by the t test using Fisher z-transformed data, dependent
    correlations, having a common variable coming from the same population, were compared
    by Steiger''s z-test (Sachs and Hedderich, 2006). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Investigations
    over Time During the temporal study in 2005, the LAI varied between 4.5 and 9.1
    for oilseed rape, 0.9 and 7.9 for winter wheat, and 1.9 and 4.0 for winter rye.
    Results from the comparison of the reflection height, LAI and FM are summarized
    in Fig. 4 and Table 2. Deviations from the regression lines in Fig. 4 indicate
    nonlinear relationships and the presence of outliers in some cases. Thus, we will
    mainly refer to Spearman''s rank coefficient ρ even though significant tests for
    ρ and r lead to the same conclusions in most cases. Rank correlations between
    LAI and hR generally increased from oilseed rape (0.410) to winter rye (0.839)
    to winter wheat (0.931); those between oilseed rape and winter wheat were significantly
    different (p = 0.005). The overall correlation FM and hR (0.988) was higher than
    the overall correlation between LAI and hR (0.815) and LAI and FM (0.832), but
    these differences were not significant. Biomass-hR relationship in terms of ρ
    was fairly similar for all crops (oilseed rape: 0.986, winter rye: 0.976, winter
    wheat: 0.920). Consequently, no significant differences were indicated by the
    t test. Sensor inclination had no significant influence on LAI-hR and FM-hR correlations
    (0° inclination, LAI-hR: 0.842; 30° inclination, LAI-hR: 0.775; 0° inclination,
    FM-hR: 0.986; 30° inclination, FM-hR: 0.990). Table 2. Correlation and orthogonal

    figure viewer Relationship between reflection height (hR), leaf area index (LAI),
    and fresh matter (FM) measured at different growth stages in 2005 for oilseed
    rape, winter rye, and winter wheat. A closer look at the data in Fig. 4 reveals
    some irregularities. For oilseed rape, the highest reflection heights measured
    appear to be outliers. The LAI and FM correspond well over the range of growth
    stages; however, hR and LAI as well as hR and FM may have shown a different trend
    when the growth stage of flowering (BBCH 60–69) was excluded. This can be explained
    by the presence of petals during flowering. The petals increased the number of
    reflective surfaces in the upper levels of the crop canopy. This caused the laser
    rangefinder to produce a higher hR (1.3 m in the zenithal mode and 1.5 m in the
    oblique mode) than before or after flowering (about 1 m in the zenithal mode and
    1.2 m in the oblique mode). Interestingly, flowering had very little influence
    on the LAI measurements with the LAI meter. This can be explained by the fact
    that the LAI meter is not only sensitive to direct light but also to transmitted
    and diffuse light, and that petals are not absorbing much light in the effective
    range of the LAI meter (Potter et al., 1996). There are also outliers in the data
    sets from winter rye and winter wheat. While FM and hR fit neatly to the straight
    line, the relationships to the LAI were contaminated by at least one outlying
    observation where the LAI was seemingly underestimated by the LAI meter. Spatial
    Investigations The LAI readings of winter rye in the field Schneiderfichten ranged
    from 1 to 4.6 m2 m−2, whereas fresh biomass varied between 0.29 and 4.25 kg m−2.
    Table 3 shows the correlations with the reflection height obtained by the two
    lasers in two modes. Most of the correlations were significant except situations
    where the Lase sensor in the scanning mode was involved. The Acuity sensor produced
    significantly (p = 0.011) better correlations with the LAI than the Lase sensor.
    The Acuity sensor working in a scanning mode produced the best results. However,
    these differences were not significant. The correlation of hR with FM (r = 0.860)
    was much better (p = 0) than hR with the LAI (r = 0.793) for both sensors. This
    is likely a result of the limited accuracy of the LAI meter. Table 3. Correlations
    between reflection height (hR), leaf area index (LAI), and fresh matter (FM) measured

    with winter wheat, the LAI ranged from 1.2 to 6.3 m2 m−2, whereas fresh biomass
    ranged from 0.57 to 5.30 kg m−2. The locations of the 10 reference plots and mapping
    results are shown in Fig. 5. To obtain the LAI map, hR readings were converted
    into LAI by a weighted orthogonal linear regression model derived from the measurements
    at the reference plots, according to Eq. [3]: (3) For this model, the weighted
    r2 was 0.944, and the standard error of estimate was 0.48 m2 m−2. After conversion
    of hR readings into LAI, the estimated LAI values were interpolated on a regular
    grid by means of ordinary kriging. The resulting map is shown in Fig. 5. The correlations
    of the Acuity sensor readings with LAI and FM were better in all cases (Table
    4). Furthermore, the Acuity sensor output produced nearly identical regression
    lines for all four runs. The overall correlation for Acuity''s hR with LAI was
    0.906 whereas the overall correlation of Lase''s hR with LAI was 0.897. While
    this difference in correlations was small it was not confirmed by the test of
    significance. Figure 5 Open in figure viewer Measurements in winter wheat (field

    in the scanning mode (r fixed = 0.956, r scanning = 0.985, p = 0.022). On the
    contrary, the Lase sensor was not significantly superior in the scanning mode
    (p = 0.859). These results are shown in Fig. 6 from measurements in the scanning
    mode (this was the best run of the Lase sensor). Furthermore, the scattering of
    points around the regression lines for Acuity and LAI or FM is very similar to
    that of LAI and FM. This indicates that the LAI meter provides no better estimate
    of FM than the Acuity range finder (p = 0.806). The highly significant linear
    correlation of 0.983 between FM and LAI express a close relationship between these
    parameters. Figure 6 Open in figure viewer Measurements in winter wheat, scanning
    mode, first run. Leaf area index (LAI), fresh matter (FM), reflection height by

    Pearson''s correlation coefficients are placed in the lower left triangle of the
    matrix. Coefficients of the orthogonal linear regression (“a” for intercept and
    “b” for slope) are placed in upper right triangle of the matrix. Repeatability
    in Practice Two runs of each sensor configuration were performed to test the ability
    of the sensors to reproduce values. Pairs of hR readings were collected within
    a range of 0.6 m summing up to 7020 observations. The Acuity sensor replicated
    measurements much better than the Lase rangefinder. This was true for both the
    fixed and the scanning modes. The overall correlation between the different runs
    was r = 0.893 for the Acuity sensor and r = 0.719 for the Lase sensor, which was
    significantly different with p = 0. Figure 7 shows an example of the repeatability
    in the fixed mode. Figure 7 Open in figure viewer Repeatability of laser readings
    in the fixed mode. Scatter plots of second run vs. first run with regression line
    (left: Lase sensor, right: Acuity sensor). Coefficients of the orthogonal linear
    regression are “a” for intercept and “b” for slope. Pearson''s correlation coefficient
    is denoted as r. The mean reflection heights of the Lase sensor were generally
    higher than those from the Acuity sensor (Table 5 and Fig. 7). Analysis of variance
    confirmed the significance of this difference (Table 6). Diverging results may
    be partly related to the measuring principle and partly related to the signal
    processing within the Lase sensor. From laboratory tests by Ehlert and Adamek
    (2007), it was shown that during dynamic measurements, the Lase sensor tends to
    produce an offset that increases with distance. The offset for the Lase sensor
    was larger than for the Acuity sensor. This discrepancy is likely caused by the
    triangulation principle used by the Lase sensor. As indicated in the materials
    and methods section, the triangulation principle can have a disadvantage due to
    its biaxial path analysis. It requires that the reflected light returns on a different
    path than the emitted light. Crop parts slightly beside the emitted beam can attenuate
    or mask the reflected beam. This obstruction is likely to increase the deeper
    the laser beam penetrates into the canopy. Thus, the triangulation-based sensors
    may receive fewer reflections from the soil surface or deeper layers of the canopy
    than from the upper layers of the canopy. This may also be the reason why the
    increase of the average hR of the Lase sensor in the scanning mode compared to
    the fixed mode is significantly stronger than increase of the average hR obtained
    by the Acuity sensor in the respective modes (Tables 5 and 6). Table 5. . Average

    The investigations over time in oilseed rape, winter rye, and winter wheat showed
    that LAI and mean reflection height (hR) obtained by laser rangefinders are closely
    correlated. Consequently, LAI estimation by hR is applicable for these crops over
    a range of growth stages. Specific limitations appear in oilseed rape during flowering.
    Petals caused the rangefinder to produce increased values of reflection height,
    which were not in accordance with the hR to LAI relationship at other growth stages.
    Less significant differences in hR to LAI correlation were observed between rye
    and wheat. Correlations between LAI and hR were consistently slightly better in
    winter wheat. This can likely be explained by the long awns of winter rye. While
    the size of these structures can sometimes be smaller than the laser beam diameter,
    incomplete reflections may occur, which can disturb the sensor. Due to the speed
    of measurements and the compactness of the sensor, the method offers high potential
    for mapping large areas in a short time. The practical tests under field conditions
    have shown the feasibility of laser-based mapping of LAI under harsh environmental
    conditions. However, there are marked differences between the sensors studied.
    Whereas measurements of the reflection height by the Lase sensor showed more outliers,
    poorer correlation, and less accuracy, measurements by the Acuity sensor based
    on the time of flight principle achieved better results. Tractor mounted spectral
    reflectance based crop sensors such as the Yara N-Sensor, the Green Seeker, and
    the Crop Circle are being increasingly adopted in agricultural practice. For example,
    more than 900 units of the Yara N-Sensor were sold worldwide (Agricon, 2011).
    However, spectral reflectance sensors are limited in detecting the LAI after canopy
    closure (Heege et al., 2008). Laser distance sensors offer new opportunities in
    surveying this highly relevant crop parameter. The method presented here can be
    used in agricultural research as well as in site-specific crop management on practical
    farms. Unmistakably, adoption by agricultural equipment manufacturers and farmers
    requires lower prices for laser rangefinders with small beam diameters and sufficient
    power to work under difficult ambient light conditions. Laser systems meeting
    these requirements are under development to be implemented in automotive collision
    avoidance and driving assistance systems (Ewald and Willhoeft, 2000; Jones, 2001;
    Velupillai and Guvenc, 2009). First systems are readily available, for example,
    the ibeo LUX Fusion System (Ibeo Automotive Systems GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). Mass
    production and progress in laser technology will result in reduced prices (Velupillai
    and Guvenc, 2009). Prices of about $2000 are anticipated. Testing these automotive
    laser scanners in agricultural applications is part of ongoing research. Optimization
    of the sensor inclination angle should be investigated in the light of Warren
    Wilson''s (1959) point quadrat theory. However, point quadrat theory may not be
    fully applicable because it assumes the point quadrats to be of constant diameter
    while laser beams show a certain divergence which causes a widening of the beam
    diameter with increasing distance. Additionally, deviation from the inclination
    angle due to shaking of the sensor during vehicle motion has to be regarded. Further
    research should aim to investigate other crops and management scenarios as well
    as the simplification of hR conversion into LAI values by the establishment of
    calibration tables. Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank the editors

    \ demand for food worldwide,\nimproving productivity in farming procedures is\
    \ essential. Smart farming is a concept that emphasizes\nthe use of modern technologies\
    \ such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and artiﬁcial intelligence (AI)\nto enhance\
    \ productivity in farming practices. In a smart farming scenario, large amounts\
    \ of data\nare collected from diverse sources such as wireless sensor networks,\
    \ network-connected weather\nstations, monitoring cameras, and smartphones. These\
    \ data are valuable resources to be used in\ndata-driven services and decision\
    \ support systems (DSS) in farming applications. However, one\nof the major challenges\
    \ with these large amounts of agriculture data is their immense diversity in\n\
    terms of format and meaning. Moreover, the different services and technologies\
    \ in a smart farming\necosystem have limited capability to work together due to\
    \ the lack of standardized practices for data\nand system integration. These issues\
    \ create a signiﬁcant challenge in cooperative service provision,\ndata and technology\
    \ integration, and data-sharing practices. To address these issues, in this paper,\n\
    we propose the platform approach, a design approach intended to guide building\
    \ effective, reliable,\nand robust smart farming systems. The proposed platform\
    \ approach considers six requirements\nfor seamless integration, processing, and\
    \ use of farm data. These requirements in a smart farming\nplatform include interoperability,\
    \ reliability, scalability, real-time data processing, end-to-end security\nand\
    \ privacy, and standardized regulations and policies. A smart farming platform\
    \ that considers\nthese requirements leads to increased productivity, proﬁtability,\
    \ and performance of connected smart\nfarms. In this paper, we aim at introducing\
    \ the platform approach concept for smart farming and\nreviewing the requirements\
    \ for this approach.\nKeywords: smart farming; precise agriculture; platform approach;\
    \ interoperability; security and\nprivacy; reliability; scalability\n1. Introduction\n\
    According to the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) [1],\
    \ food\nproduction should increase by 70% due to the expected growth in the world\
    \ population by\n2050. This population growth requires increasing productivity\
    \ using solutions that con-\nsider resource shortage and farm proﬁtability [2].\
    \ Employing information communication\ntechnology (ICT), smart technologies, in\
    \ addition to the rapid development of the Internet\nof Things (IoT) and artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence (AI) have led to digitalization in farming called\nsmart farming.\
    \ Smart farming is considered to be the fourth revolution in farming [3,4].\n\
    By managing inputs, such as fertilizers, pesticides, and animal feed, a smart\
    \ system can\nhelp farmers to reduce waste, employ less workforce, decrease overall\
    \ costs, and to reach a\nmore sustainable environmental impact to achieve higher\
    \ productivity [5,6]. According to\nthe Market and Markets report, USD 13.8 billion\
    \ was dedicated to the global smart farming\nmarket in 2020. Due to farmers’ needs\
    \ to increase yields, improve livestock production,\nand reduce management costs\
    \ to meet the growing demand for food, smart farming should\nexperience rapid\
    \ growth to USD 22 billion by 2025 [7].\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12060838\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agriculture\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n2 of 18\n\
    In a smart farming scenario, large amounts of real-time and high-resolution data\
    \ are\ngenerated from remote and automated sensor systems. The data can represent\
    \ different\naspects of farming, including but not limited to livestock, crops,\
    \ soil, and the environ-\nment [8]. The data range from time series to spatial\
    \ images, human experiences, and\nobservations collected via mobile smartphone\
    \ applications [9]. Such data can be analyzed\nto ﬁlter out invalid or wrong data\
    \ [2] and to compute personalized recommendations for\na farm to improve productivity\
    \ [10]. Different modern technologies can be utilized for\ndata generation and\
    \ data analysis in digital agriculture. IoT, AI, and cloud computing are\nexamples\
    \ of technologies that have recently been widely used in smart farming [11,12].\n\
    Although data-driven solutions have provided various beneﬁts in agriculture, data\
    \ integra-\ntion, processing, and usage processes and protocols are still prominent\
    \ challenges that need\nto be addressed [13]. Some of these challenges are limited\
    \ awareness and knowledge of dig-\nitalization [14], lack of standardization and\
    \ suitable management to cope with fragmented\nand heterogeneous data [15], lack\
    \ of high-quality data and proper analysis [16], privacy\nand security challenges\
    \ in an entire smart farming ecosystem [17], and lack of compliance\nwith uniform\
    \ regulations and policies [18].\nA uniﬁed solution that considers the requirements\
    \ in various stages of the data pro-\ncessing lifecycle can address various issues\
    \ in digital agriculture. Such a solution enhances\nawareness regarding the needs\
    \ and requirements of different data sources, technologies,\nprocesses, and protocols\
    \ (including policies). This solution assists the actors in smart\nfarming ecosystems\
    \ to provide their services and products to other parties in a more usable\nformat.\
    \ Moreover, this approach increases food safety, production, and sustainability\
    \ by\nproviding transparent and trustable data about every stage of the food chain.\
    \ In addition,\na uniﬁed solution provides an excellent opportunity for building\
    \ decision frameworks to\naggregate data from diverse sources and to provide high-quality\
    \ data-driven services. This\napproach also facilitates data sharing and multiparty\
    \ cooperation in farming applications,\nand thus, increases productivity and reduces\
    \ resource waste.\nIn this paper, we suggest the platform approach as a uniﬁed\
    \ solution that facilitates\ncooperation in smart farming applications. Furthermore,\
    \ this approach enforces relation-\nships between farmers and system providers\
    \ to track crop cycle information, livestock, and\ndairy production in a secure\
    \ manner for their decisions and data management.\nIn recent years, several platforms\
    \ have been proposed for smart farming applications.\nSmartFarmNet [2] is an IoT-based\
    \ platform that has been developed by a multi-disciplinary\nAustralian team to\
    \ automate the collection of environmental, irrigation, fertilization, and\nsoil\
    \ data. This platform integrates IoT devices, such as sensors, actuators, and\
    \ cloud servers\nfor storing and analysis of collected data. The presented results\
    \ in the paper showed that\nSmartFarmNet was capable of providing near real-time\
    \ query responses. Moreover, the\nauthors demonstrated that increasing the number\
    \ of sensors had a negligible impact on the\nperformance of the system, therefore,\
    \ the proposed platform was scalable. Mehdi et al. [19]\nproposed Smart Farming\
    \ Oriented BigData Architecture (SFOBA), a platform for big data\nprocessing that\
    \ provided real-time processing on acquired data from smart farm systems and\n\
    devices. In this study, the authors utilized the Star Schema Benchmark dataset\
    \ [20] to show\nhow the proposed platform could finish multidimensional queries\
    \ on 40 million rows of data\nin less than one second. Clements et al. [21] developed\
    \ an interactive digital tool that collected\ndata from different sources such\
    \ as the Key Indicators Mapping System (KIMS) and the Key\nIndicators Database\
    \ System (KIDS) both provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization\nof the\
    \ United Nations (FAO). The developed tool provided information regarding livestock\n\
    production, disease prediction, as well as provided the rules for risk assessment\
    \ at the\ncountry level.\nAnother ﬁeld in smart farming is smart dairy farming\
    \ which aims to utilize modern\nsmart technologies to satisfy the increasing demand\
    \ for quality dairy products, to reduce\nconsumed resources, and to decrease the\
    \ ecological footprint [22]. Taneja et al. [23] proposed\nSmartHerd, a platform\
    \ enabling data-driven dairy farming by analyzing available data and\nproviding\
    \ controls for farmers and other stakeholders. This platform has been deployed\n\
    Agriculture 2022, 12, 838\n3 of 18\nin Waterford, Ireland, and was developed to\
    \ gather and analyze data regarding dairy\ncattle. The presented platform is designed\
    \ to keep working when the internet connection\nis lost. The generated data in\
    \ this platform are stored locally and are shared on a cloud\ninfrastructure when\
    \ the internet connection is available.\nMost of the proposed platforms in smart\
    \ farming have focused on a speciﬁc aspect of\nsmart farming such as crop production\
    \ recommendations [2], big data technologies [19],\ndata transformation [19] reliability\
    \ [24], and business model [6]. With the increasing need to\ncollect, integrate,\
    \ analyze, and manage large amounts of data generated at farms, effective\nfarm\
    \ data processing continues to be a major hurdle for the adoption and success\
    \ of\ndigital agriculture solutions. Despite the need, the existing studies have\
    \ not provided a\nholistically designed approach by considering different requirements\
    \ for smart farming\napplications. To ﬁll this gap, in this paper, we propose\
    \ a design thinking approach, which\nwe refer to as the “platform approach”, for\
    \ smart farming data processing. This approach\nencourages consideration of six\
    \ core requirements when designing, implementing, and\ntesting smart farming solutions.\
    \ These requirements are interoperability of data, processes,\nand technologies;\

    \ in smart farming systems are described; in Section 3, we discuss the challenges\n\
    and requirements in smart farming systems; then, in Section 4, we investigate\
    \ the main\nrequirements and related solutions in a smart farming platform; ﬁnally,\
    \ in Section 5, we\nconclude the paper with a summary of the platform approach\
    \ and some future insights.\n2. The Core Components of Data Processing in Smart\
    \ Farming Systems\nTo improve smart farming data processing through the integration\
    \ of various systems,\nin this paper, we propose the concept of the platform approach,\
    \ which is a design approach\nfor data processing. The smart farming platform\
    \ approach allows farmers, researchers,\ntechnology providers, and all other stakeholders\
    \ to have a standard and reliable solution\nto collect and share information,\
    \ resources, and experiences to improve the productivity\nand performance of smart\
    \ farming solutions. We demonstrate an overview of the main\ncomponents of smart\
    \ farming data processing in Figure 1 in ﬁve main layers. This abstract\nplatform\
    \ can shed light on the components of the smart farming application platform,\n\
    deﬁning the main tasks and core components for data processing in these systems.\n\
    According to Figure 1, in the data acquisition stage, data are collected from\
    \ diverse\nsources, such as farmers, sensors, and satellites, as well as external\
    \ databases such as\nweather and climate data. The collected data from these different\
    \ sources can be in different\nformats that are not compatible to be stored in\
    \ a unique database. In addition, some\ncollected data may contain incomplete\
    \ data, missed values, outliers [25], and anomalous\ninstances [26]. To address\
    \ these problems, in the data preparation stage, best practices\nfor data preprocessing\
    \ can be used to prepare data for further analysis. These practices\ninclude standardizing\
    \ data to a predeﬁned format, identifying and deleting duplicated\ndata, handling\
    \ the gaps in generated data, and validating data sources and contents. Addi-\n\
    tionally, the collected data from different sources can be stored in a common\
    \ infrastructure\nand can be integrated with other data sources that are collected\
    \ from diverse smart farm-\ning systems. These methods assist in ensuring data\
    \ consistency, completeness [27], and\naccuracy [28]. The components in the second\
    \ and the third layers are highly correlated,\nand many of the smart farming data\
    \ processing functions can be assigned to both layers.\nThe data processing layer\
    \ components are the brains of smart farming [29]. Mathematical\nmodeling, statistical\
    \ methods, or AI methods are used to analyze and extract knowledge\nfrom farm\
    \ data. Machine learning (a branch of AI) consists of intelligent techniques to\
    \ make\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n4 of 18\nautomated decisions with limited human\
    \ involvement. Machine learning can perform\nrapid optimizations, classiﬁcations\
    \ [30], predictions, and recommendations and add value\nto the entire system [31].\
    \ For instance, SomaDetect Inc. of Fredericton [13], utilizes machine\nlearning\
    \ for identifying individual cows. This system also monitors the cows to detect\n\
    disease symptoms through data collected from sensors at milking stations on dairy\
    \ farms.\nAs another example, AirSurf-Lettuce is an open-source analytic platform\
    \ that uses machine\nlearning to categorize iceberg lettuces to improve the actual\
    \ yield and crop marketability\nbefore harvesting [32]. Model deployment in the\
    \ context of machine learning refers to\nthe application of generalizing a model\
    \ to predict new items in the system. Prediction is\naccording to estimating the\
    \ outcomes for unseen data that can help to provide predictions.\nFor example,\
    \ the growth prediction in plants helps farmers to decide about harvest time\n\
    and plan for the required workforce. Forecasting is a kind of prediction about\
    \ the future\nusing time-series data. An example of forecasting in smart farming\
    \ is weather forecasting\nusing temporal information to plan for irrigation [33].\n\

    \ that facilitate integration, processing, and use of farm data.\nThe decision-making\
    \ stage includes system monitoring, rule management, and model\nmetadata management\
    \ to provide the results and recommendations through the deployed\nmodel. Metadata\
    \ (data about data) is provided to establish a common understanding of\nthe meaning\
    \ of data. For example, the available metadata about automatic milking devices\n\
    can help farmers to use the proper estimators to predict the milking duration.\
    \ These data\ncan help smart farming actors such as farmers and growers during\
    \ the decision-making\nprocess. Some examples are decisions about disease prediction,\
    \ pesticide control, and\nwater management. In the last stage of smart farming\
    \ applications, end-users, i.e., farmers,\nfarming service providers, agriculture\
    \ researchers, and governments access the system\nresults through services. System\
    \ monitoring can audit the entire system and provide\nfeedback to optimize the\
    \ predictors and to improve decision making. In addition, rule\nmanagement can\
    \ check the compliance of decisions against available rules.\nSince trustworthiness\
    \ is a core requirement to ensure system adoption and use, it is\nnecessary to\
    \ consider security and privacy concerns in all communications and end-to-end\n\
    in the platform. Moreover, the data workﬂow should comply with the available policy\
    \ and\nregulations in smart farming. Application programming interfaces (APIs)\
    \ are common\nmethods for the integration of different components and resources\
    \ (e.g., data sources, legal\nprocesses, and policy protocols) in a platform approach.\n\
    Agriculture 2022, 12, 838\n5 of 18\n3. Challenges and Requirements in Smart Farming\n\
    The platform approach suggests designing smart farming services using platform\n\
    structures that can be integrated through APIs or other methods to build effective,\
    \ reliable,\nand robust systems. This approach is also aimed at providing a common\
    \ understanding\nand semantics among smart farming actors to collaborate in data-sharing\
    \ practices and\ncooperative service provision. In Section 2, we presented an\
    \ abstract overview of such a\nplatform as well as the main components of data\
    \ processing in smart farming systems. In\nthis section, we discuss the challenges\
    \ in smart farming applications and convey the major\nrequirements that any agricultural\
    \ platform should have to address these challenges.\nIn agriculture, data are\
    \ highly heterogeneous for different reasons such as type, format,\nand intent\
    \ of data, different protocols of devices, and the methods of collecting data.\
    \ For\nexample, poultry stakeholders are interested in monitoring the daily behavior\
    \ of birds, such\nas their movement and feeding patterns, to predict the possibility\
    \ of a disease outbreak\nin the early stages. A major challenge in such an application\
    \ is combining heterogeneous\ndata collected from different sensors in smart poultry\
    \ farms. In addition to collecting and\nprocessing data, aggregating diverse data\
    \ among various farms can improve the prediction\noutcome. However, lack of interoperability\
    \ among data, technologies, and data processes is\na signiﬁcant barrier to reaching\
    \ this goal. A similar challenge may arise when farmers aim\nto equip their farms\
    \ with new IoT devices. As devices from different technology providers\ndo not\
    \ follow a unique protocol, this limitation restricts farmers from adding new\
    \ digital\ntools and devices to their smart farming network.\nIn the context of\
    \ smart farming, interoperability refers to the ability of two or more\ndifferent\
    \ systems, services, and components (i.e., software components and IoT devices)\
    \ to\nbe able to work together to exchange information, facilitate processes,\
    \ integrate technology\nsolutions, and comply with policies and legal requirements.\
    \ There are four categories of\ninteroperability including semantic/data interoperability,\
    \ technology or system interop-\nerability, operational interoperability, and\
    \ legal interoperability [34]. For data/semantic\ninteroperability, the entities\
    \ should mutually agree on the meaning, content, and context\nof data exchange\
    \ and use [35]. Interoperability improves the ﬂexibility of smart farming\nnetworks\
    \ as well as enables farmers to collaborate through data sharing and enhance\n\
    their farm practices. An important aspect of interoperability is standardization.\
    \ In the\ncontext of data processing, without mechanisms to take data from diverse\
    \ sources of digital\nagriculture solutions, it would be extremely resource based\
    \ and time-consuming to make\nthe most use of data. Using processes and best practices\
    \ that convert data and information\nto harmonized formats is critical to enabling\
    \ data sharing and integration practices and\ncollaborative decision making.\n\
    Alongside interoperability in smart farming devices and systems, controlling data\
    \ reli-\nability is a major requirement in a smart farm platform. Data reliability,\
    \ sometimes referred\nto as data quality, is deﬁned as the extent to which the\
    \ data and its source are trustworthy,\nunfailing, authentic, genuine, and representative\
    \ of the problem [36]. Reliability can be\nevaluated at different levels, such\
    \ as on-farm and off-farm levels. From an on-farm point of\nview, it is essential\
    \ to make sure the data generation is valid and stable. A smart device\nthat is\
    \ physically damaged, or an issue in network connection might lead to invalid\
    \ and\nunstable data generation. From an off-farm perspective, a smart farming\
    \ platform should\nensure the farmers that the data and algorithms are valid and\
    \ trustable. Data quality issues\nare also likely to arise in the integration\
    \ process as the quality of all data sources cannot\nbe veriﬁed [37,38]. Wrong\
    \ decisions originating from unreliable data in decision-making\nprocesses cost\
    \ agricultural businesses billions per year [39].\nScalability is another requirement\
    \ that should be considered while designing a smart\nfarming platform [40]. Scalability\
    \ in smart farming refers to the adaptability of a system\nto increase the capacity,\
    \ for example, the number of technology devices such as sensors\nand actuators,\
    \ while enabling timely analysis [41]. Shortcomings of scalability in a smart\n\
    farming architecture, in the context of data processing, would lead to weak system\
    \ perfor-\nmance. For instance, integration with other devices and applications\
    \ may not be possible if\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n6 of 18\nscalability requirements\
    \ are not embedded by design. It has been recommended to consider\nthe possibility\
    \ of growth in size and diversity of applications of smart farming systems\nfrom\
    \ the initial stages of system design [42]. As an illustration, consider a large\
    \ poultry\nproduction that owns farms in different locations. This company needs\
    \ a platform to build a\nscalable business by integrating the supply chain from\
    \ feed to hatcheries and poultry farms\nto distribution [43]. These poultry farms\
    \ may have different sensors and acquire various\ntypes of technologies to collect\
    \ data in sizes, formats, content, and complexities [17,44]. The\ncompany should\
    \ be able to expand data processing, network bandwidth, and other compu-\ntation\
    \ resources to be able to utilize data collected in these farms. If this need\
    \ for resource\ngrowth is not considered in the design of the system, the company\
    \ cannot easily expand\ntheir system to process and use other data sources. Platforms\
    \ for smart farming should\nconsider scalability as a core requirement to enable\
    \ growth and future needs for integration.\nMoreover, in smart farming systems,\
    \ we need fast and accurate decisions and actions.\nThus, we need platforms that\
    \ enable farmers to deliver proper actions at the right time.\nReal-time data\
    \ analytics is deﬁned as the ability to analyze large volumes of streaming data\n\
    when they are created or stored [45]. For instance, in the case that a farmer\
    \ decides to sell\ntheir products or buy supplies, a long waiting time for getting\
    \ access to data and making\ndecisions might lead to losing a bargain, or incorrectly\
    \ offering an estimation originated\nfrom outdated data. Real-time processing\
    \ is an approach to capture, process, and export\ndata promptly [46,47]. Furthermore,\
    \ real-time data processing enables smart farming actors\nto take proper decisions\
    \ at the right time which leads to minimizing risks and undesirable\nconsequences\
    \ [48]. A smart farming platform can also facilitate real-time processing as a\n\
    requirement for reinforcing farming practices and preparing farmers against unexpected\n\
    circumstances [45]. To achieve real-time data processing, it is also necessary\
    \ to collect the\ndata in real time. The results acquired based on analyzing old\
    \ data can cause inaccurate\ndecisions, while real-time data facilitates real-time\
    \ decisions and actions [46].\nSimilar to any other smart platform, a smart farming\
    \ platform should bring security\nand privacy to the core of attention and provide\
    \ sufﬁcient protection mechanisms. Mod-\nern technologies form an ecosystem in\
    \ which connected devices are accessible remotely,\nallowing adversaries to plan\
    \ cyberattacks. The attackers might aim to steal information or\ncarry out disruptive\
    \ actions on the smart farming systems [49]. For example, Yang et al.\nillustrated\
    \ how adversaries used IoT devices in IT infrastructure to compromise security\
    \ [4].\nAs an illustration, a malicious actor can get access to a farm’s data\
    \ using an unsecured\nsmart device and steal information about the products, ﬁnancial\
    \ decisions, and future plans.\nThe intruder can also damage the products and\
    \ equipment. Because of the availability\nof diverse data sources in smart farming\
    \ systems, including personal and business data,\nprivacy is another paramount\
    \ concern. Smart farming systems should provide mechanisms\nto ensure security\
    \ requirements and data protection. These practices must protect data\nend-to-end\
    \ and in different data processing stages, from data collection to data-driven\n\
    service provision.\nRegulations for agricultural practices affect the design and\
    \ development of smart\nfarming technologies. For instance, farmers’ concerns\
    \ about data sharing and privacy\nhave been discussed in recent studies [50,51].\
    \ Farmers are not convinced that the available\npolicies to protect their intellectual\
    \ property, business proﬁt share, and privacy are sufﬁcient.\nThere are also concerns\
    \ about the lack of compliance with privacy best practices and farm\ndata agreements\
    \ by the technology providers [52]. To address these concerns and build\ntrust,\
    \ there is a need to establish standards and best practices that mandate the rights\
    \ and\nresponsibilities of different actors in smart farming systems. There is\
    \ also the need to set\nstandards for data-sharing practices and to apply policies\
    \ to determine accountability and\npenalties in the case of possible disputes.\
    \ Other regulations related to food safety, supply\nchain management, disease\
    \ monitoring, and other applications can also impact agriculture\ndata management\
    \ and processing. These policies can be renewed to be applicable to new\nand emerging\
    \ agri-food needs and technologies. Policy requirements can be embedded\ninto\
    \ technologies for monitoring, compliance, and sustainability purposes.\nAgriculture\
    \ 2022, 12, 838\n7 of 18\nIn summary, as is demonstrated in Figure 2, we recommend\
    \ consideration of a plat-\nform approach that facilitates six requirements for\
    \ smart farming data processing. These\nrequirements enable seamless integration\
    \ of data, system, and processes with the end-user\nin mind. They include interoperability\
    \ to provide compatibility among different compo-\nnents of the platform; real-time\
    \ processing to generate fast and accurate information for\ndecision making; scalability\
    \ that enables the platform to extend the entities and resources;\nreliability\
    \ to assure accessing valid and up-to-date data; ensuring security and privacy\
    \ to\npreserve the system safety and conﬁdentiality; and, ﬁnally compliance with\
    \ the related\npolicies and regulations in smart farming. A platform that satisﬁes\
    \ all these requirements\ncan enhance farming practices, and therefore, can increase\
    \ productivity, proﬁtability, and\nperformance while decreasing resource waste.\n\
    \ \nbuild trust, there is a need to establish standards and best practices that\
    \ mandate the rights \nand responsibilities of different actors in smart farming\
    \ systems. There is also the need to \nset standards for data-sharing practices\
    \ and to apply policies to determine accountability \nand penalties in the case\
    \ of possible disputes. Other regulations related to food safety, \nsupply chain\
    \ management, disease monitoring, and other applications can also impact \nagriculture\
    \ data management and processing. These policies can be renewed to be appli-\n\
    cable to new and emerging agri-food needs and technologies. Policy requirements\
    \ can be \nembedded into technologies for monitoring, compliance, and sustainability\
    \ purposes. \nIn summary, as is demonstrated in Figure 2, we recommend consideration\
    \ of a plat-\nform approach that facilitates six requirements for smart farming\
    \ data processing. These \nrequirements enable seamless integration of data, system,\
    \ and processes with the end-\nuser in mind. They include interoperability to\

    \ and \nprivacy to preserve the system safety and confidentiality; and, finally\
    \ compliance with the \nrelated policies and regulations in smart farming. A platform\

    \ \nFigure 2. Platform requirements for data processing.\n4. Requirements, Discussion\
    \ and Solutions\nIn Section 3, we recommended six major requirements to be considered\
    \ in the design\nof smart farming platforms. We suggest that these requirements\
    \ are necessary for any\nplatform that aims to provide fast and robust services\
    \ in a smart farming ecosystem. In\nthe following, we investigate these requirements\
    \ and the solutions to address them in the\nplatform approach.\n4.1. Interoperability\n\
    Currently, there is an extensive number of digital solutions including software\
    \ tools\nand services that are used in smart farming. This growing trend has resulted\
    \ in the\ngeneration of heterogeneous data from multiple protocols and communication\
    \ technologies\nwith different formats and semantics. However, data generated\
    \ by precision farming tools\nare not portable and cannot be integrated among\
    \ smart farming systems. Interoperability\namong technical software tools, hardware,\
    \ or processes/protocols is relatively limited\noften because of the lack of established\
    \ standards [53]. Interoperability requirements cut\nacross various components\
    \ of smart farming technologies (Figure 1) from collecting data\nwith varying\
    \ accessibility rules, data integration across multiple sectors/devices, and data\n\
    processing and protection regulation for data governance and data access.\nInteroperability\
    \ can be viewed from legal, organizational or operational, semantic,\nand technical\
    \ dimensions [34]. Legal interoperability involves ensuring the integration of\n\
    smart farming platforms under various legal frameworks including food policies,\
    \ privacy\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n8 of 18\npolicies and procedures, and data\
    \ agreements, to enable data exchange. In a smart farming\nsystem, data could\
    \ be combined from various sources, resulting in integrated datasets. This\nintegration\
    \ should be performed in accordance with the farm data agreements. To address\n\
    legal interoperability requirements in smart farming, the RDA-CODATA principles\
    \ can\nbe used [34]. These principles are: facilitating the authorized access\
    \ to and re-use of data,\ndeciding who has access to and is responsible for the\
    \ data, managing the legal interests,\nexplaining the rights clearly, and promoting\
    \ harmonization of rights in the data. These\nprinciples can be embedded into\
    \ the farm data processing platform and integration can be\nenabled through application\
    \ programming interfaces (APIs).\nOrganizational interoperability is concerned\
    \ with agricultural actors’ capacity to\naccept and utilize services from other\
    \ organizations to collaborate effectively [54]. This\nis dependent on the degree\
    \ to which farms’ processes, responsibilities, and roles are\nharmonized toward\
    \ shared objectives and strategies in the agricultural systems to make\nservices\
    \ more accessible, easily identiﬁable, and user focused. To address the organizational\n\
    interoperability requirements, farm business processes and exchanged data need\
    \ to be\nintegrated, aligned, and documented using a commonly agreed modeling\
    \ method [55].\nSemantic interoperability ensures that the precise meaning and\
    \ format of the shared\ndata are understood and preserved. In existing smart farming\
    \ ecosystems, data are col-\nlected from fragmented systems in varying formats\
    \ and meanings. To tackle the lack of\nsemantic interoperability in data processing,\
    \ it is necessary to describe all data elements by\ndeveloping vocabularies and\
    \ schema to ensure that all communicating agricultural parties\nunderstand the\
    \ data in the same way. The solutions for improving semantic interoperability\n\
    in smart farming are standardization, metadata, and connecting each data variable\
    \ to a\ncommon language, in the form of taxonomies and ontologies [56]. Semantic\
    \ interoperability\nissues in smart farming data processes can be solved by using\
    \ standardized languages\nsuch as agroXML [57] which is an XML dialect for describing\
    \ farm production processes\nas well as the real-world objects required in conducting\
    \ these processes. For semantic\ninteroperability enhancement, a smart farming\
    \ application can leverage metadata that\ndescribes original data, allowing the\
    \ user to make the best decision possible about how to\nuse it. Metadata is generated\
    \ to add meaning and context to data values and to establish a\ncommon understanding\
    \ of the meaning and semantics of the data. Metadata enables correct\nand proper\
    \ use and interpretation of the data by the owners and users [58]. Furthermore,\
    \ it\nalso enables farm machines to comprehend data by offering models and eliminating\
    \ ambi-\nguity [58]. For example, in the modeling and simulation of a decision\
    \ support platform in\nsmart farming, there is a need for a method to detect conﬂict\
    \ between system components\nand concepts of the model. Metadata is used to address\
    \ the interoperability of such systems\nby capturing information about model concepts\
    \ which allows software agents to reason in\nan unambiguous and machine-readable\
    \ form [59].\nData interoperability is considerably resolved in smart farming\
    \ when metadata is\nstandardized, and common language deﬁnitions are used. Such\
    \ standards are deﬁned\nand promoted by standard agencies such as the International\
    \ Standards Organisation\n(ISO) [60]. The Agricultural Information Management\
    \ Standards (AIMS) [61], the Agricul-\ntural Metadata Element Set (AgMES) [62],\
    \ and Agrovoc [63] are three notable metadata\ninitiatives in the agriculture\
    \ area [53]. Moreover, ontologies and taxonomies can enable\nbetter interoperability\
    \ by allowing data to be linked at the semantic level. Taxonomy\naids in the interpretation\
    \ of relationships between data entities and the categorization of\ndata [64].\
    \ Ontology explains the structural complexities of databases as well as the semantic\n\
    relationships among data variables collected in databases [10]. Several ontologies\
    \ such as\nFoodWiki, Agrovoc, and FoodOn have been proposed to extract the semantics\
    \ of food and\nagricultural data to share and reuse agriculture knowledge. In\
    \ addition, sensor ontologies\nsuch as sensor node ontology [65], and sensor-data\
    \ ontology [66] are used for semantic\ninteroperability of data collected from\
    \ IoT devices. The goal of these ontologies is to identify\nessential elements\
    \ of sensor data and to model resources, services, and geographical data\nto ease\
    \ data access for users.\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n9 of 18\nAnother aspect of\
    \ interoperability is technical interoperability, which refers to the\ncapacity\
    \ of two or more technical agricultural platforms, infrastructures, services,\
    \ or proto-\ncols to easily integrate and enable process and data ﬂow [54]. This\
    \ concept is fundamental\nto software and hardware compatibility. For example,\
    \ interoperability is required among\nfarm machines, software, IoT devices, and\
    \ sensors. If the data processing modules do not\nrecognize the data format collected\
    \ by the combined harvester, the IoT will be of little\nuse in terms of assisting\
    \ decision making. Technical interoperability often can be satisﬁed\nby selecting\
    \ and implementing the proper software and/or internet interface (API) and\nprotocols,\
    \ as well as standardized content encodings for transmission [67]. Technical inter-\n\
    operability could be satisﬁed by creating a decentralized network of existing\
    \ systems to\nenable the exchange of data in smart farming processes. Each system\
    \ could be independent\nand built upon its own technical infrastructure. The ATLAS\
    \ initiative is one of the projects\nthat developed such an open technical interoperable\
    \ network involving stakeholders from\ndiverse agricultural domains by using open\
    \ technical speciﬁcation. This project aims to\nprovide a distributed service-oriented\
    \ platform that enables some tasks such as watering\nmanagement, soil management,\
    \ and behavioral analysis of livestock. This framework\ninvolves all actors in\
    \ the food chain, enhancing the process from farm to fork.\nInteroperability is\
    \ made possible by data standards that allow the sharing and ex-\nchange of data.\
    \ In the absence of standardization of data, processing data from heteroge-\n\
    neous and incompatible sources is challenging and often inefﬁcient. Data standardization\
    \ is\na key step toward data interoperability to promote data quality, data sharing,\
    \ data reusabil-\nity, and to optimize data usage. The standardization process\
    \ of data, processes, policies,\nand concepts is critical in ensuring all types\
    \ of interoperability. This goal may be realized by\nwell-deﬁned and well-established\
    \ protocols and regulations that facilitate the integration\nof multiple data\
    \ sources and external knowledge-based services given by stakeholders and\npartners.\
    \ Due to the complexity of data standardization, data harmonization [68] can be\n\
    used as an alternative solution. Data harmonization is the process of merging\
    \ different data\nsources into an unambiguous, integrated entity record to be\
    \ used in the system and to feed\nthe processes of a system [69]. The main difference\
    \ between data standardization and data\nharmonization comes from the level of\
    \ strictness in standards. On the one hand, the aim of\ndata standardization is\
    \ to make the data clear and consistent. It should be “clear” to ensure\nthat\
    \ data can be easily understood by individuals who are not involved in data processing,\n\
    and consistent to ensure that relevant data can be recognized using common terms\
    \ and\nformats. Data harmonization, on the other hand, is the process of merging\
    \ different data\nsources into an unambiguous, integrated entity fromat to be\
    \ used in the system and to feed\nthe processes of a system [69].\n4.2. Reliability\n\
    Reliability is a crucial foundation for designing data-driven services across\
    \ smart\nfarming ecosystems. The reliability of data-driven systems depends on\
    \ effective processes,\ndata, and technologies [70]. As a major requirement, reliability\
    \ should be considered in\nall stages of smart farming, from data acquisition\
    \ to data preparation and model building.\nReliability can be considered from\
    \ different aspects such as data reliability and technology\nreliability. The\
    \ main components of data reliability are data consistency, data complete-\nness\
    \ [27,71,72], and data accuracy [28]. Consistency as the main component of reliability\
    \ [2]\nrefers to keeping data concepts, value domains, and formats unchanged.\
    \ Changes to farm\ndata might take place while processing, moving through networks,\
    \ or sharing between\napplications [28,72]. Data completeness is about the availability\
    \ of all necessary data for\ndecision making [72]. In other words, the deﬁciency\
    \ of a component should not impact the\naccuracy and integrity of data [28]. Data\
    \ completeness in smart farming does not mean that\nall data attributes must be\
    \ present; rather, important data attributes and optional ones need\nto be decided\
    \ for selection. Accuracy refers to the extent to which recorded data reﬂect the\n\
    true state of source information [28,73]. The values stored by a precision agriculture\
    \ system\nmay be inaccurate or wrong. This issue can be due to unreliable or broken\
    \ sensors, lost\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n10 of 18\ninformation, and failed\
    \ transmissions [74]. The inaccurate data can lead to a risk of missing\nevents\
    \ and hard interpretations [74].\nIn addition to data reliability, smart farming\
    \ platforms require robust and reliable\ntechnologies such as high speed and reliable\
    \ internet connection [75]. The physical safety\nof IoT devices for precision\
    \ agriculture systems should be ensured in different environ-\nmental conditions\
    \ to avoid communication failures. IoT data analytics should process data\naccurately\
    \ and reliably to enable decision-makers to react quickly to emerging issues and\n\
    changing conditions [76].\nBecause agricultural data cover a wide range of heterogeneous\
    \ and unstructured\nsources, simple ratios can be used to measure the percentage\
    \ of data elements that meets\nspeciﬁc rules [77]. To manage information structure\
    \ in a database, Blake et al. [78] suggested\nusing parsing techniques. Using\
    \ this method, the quality of sensor data, as an example,\nwas calculated by comparing\
    \ it with data coming from multiple reference sensors, existing\nhistorical data,\
    \ or an alternate data source. There are, however, several challenges to using\n\
    this approach. For example, the quality of the reference sensors is not always\
    \ guaranteed,\nhistorical data might not be available, and there might be additional\
    \ costs using alternate\ndata sources. Performing some tests and preprocessing\
    \ on the aggregated data from sensors\nand other sources is recommended to raise\
    \ data reliability in smart farms. For example,\noutlier detection can help to\
    \ detect faulty devices or discern the unreliable data exchanged\nwith other farms.\n\
    4.3. Scalability\nScalability is another requirement that should be considered\
    \ in a smart farming plat-\nform. Scalability refers to the ability to increase\
    \ available resources and system capability\nwithout the need to go through a\
    \ major system redesign or implementation. As an illustra-\ntion, in Figure 1,\
    \ we can increase the capacity for data processing by increasing the cloud\nresources\
    \ in the second layer and computation resources in the third layer.\nThe challenges\
    \ related to scalability in smart farming fall into two categories: capacity\n\
    and performance [79]. Scaling capacity refers to the ability to add new nodes\
    \ or resources\nto the system [41]. Scaling performance is the ability to improve\
    \ performance or to keep\nthe performance identical while expanding capacity.\
    \ The fundamental bottleneck that\nmay affect system performance may be caused\
    \ by different deployment conﬁgurations\nof various components [80]. Other challenges\
    \ of scalability are identity management\nand access control, security [81], privacy\
    \ [44], governance, and fault tolerance [81]. Since\nfarming data generation is\
    \ rapidly increasing every day, such data are too large to be stored\non a single\
    \ node. A fundamental solution to address this need is distributing data collection\n\
    mechanisms across multiple nodes. For instance, Zhou et al. [82] employed Hadoop\
    \ to\nprocess and store 1.44 million data records for daily temperature monitoring.\
    \ Since most\nsmart farming data are small ﬁles that lead to many small ﬁles,\
    \ Hadoop cannot be effective\nwithout a distributed system equipped with a high-performance\
    \ computing system. To\naddress this problem, the Hadoop Distributed File System\
    \ (HDFS) has been designed to\nprocess large (and small size) datasets.\nUsing\
    \ cloud computing technology in a smart farming platform is another solution\n\
    that can address scalability challenges related to capacity due to ﬂexible and\
    \ robust data\ncollection, management, and processing capabilities [83]. Cloud\
    \ computing provides a\nhigh level of ﬂexibility by providing remote services\
    \ for monitoring and managing farm\ndata. Moreover, these services can provide\
    \ on-demand storage and computation resources\nwith no need for on-farm hardware\
    \ installation [84]. The data stored in the cloud systems\nare usually distributed\
    \ in the data storage platforms supported by backup mechanisms.\nThe data-driven\
    \ services are ﬁnally offered by web services accessible through diverse\ntools,\
    \ including laptops, tablets, and smartphones in the last stage of smart farming\
    \ tasks,\nas shown in Figure 1. SmartFarmNet [2] is an example of a scalable platform\
    \ that utilizes\ncloud computing technology to provide a scalable solution for\
    \ smart farming.\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n11 of 18\nDespite several beneﬁts\
    \ of employing cloud technology in smart farming systems, the\nchallenges such\
    \ as latency, security, and privacy issues in transferring a large amount of\n\
    data to the cloud are still persistent. To address these issues, the use of edge\
    \ computing\nat the network’s edge has been recommended [78,85]. Edge computing\
    \ is a technology\nthat aims to process data at the edge of the network, near\
    \ the source of the data in order\nto reduce the transmitted data to the cloud\
    \ servers, as well as to decrease the workload\non the centralized cloud computing\
    \ servers. In addition, edge computing can leverage\nthe scalability of cloud\
    \ computing resources by taking advantage of both cloud and edge\ncomputing and\
    \ decreasing the volume of data transfer. Having an edge-based ecosystem\nwith\
    \ the right APIs and tools to integrate various data sources can ensure the availability\n\
    and real-time processing for users. An example of using edge computing in agriculture\n\
    is the platform Zamora-Izquierdo et al. [24] who proposed another real-world platform\n\
    that utilized edge technology to handle the issues in hydroponics farming. This\
    \ platform\nwas implemented in Spain to evaluate the water consumption and procedures\
    \ related to\ntomato cultivation. Digital tools also have been used in livestock\
    \ production and health\nmanagement. Although edge computing increases scalability\
    \ in a system, it increases\nconcerns regarding the heterogeneity of the utilized\
    \ devices in a network. Because this\ntechnology utilizes diverse software and\
    \ hardware products in different layers of the\nnetwork, the performance of the\
    \ system is highly correlated with the compatibility of the\nused components.\
    \ Ning et al. [86] discussed the heterogeneity issues in edge computing\nand the\
    \ solutions to address this problem.\n4.4. Near Real-Time Data Processing and\
    \ Decision Making\nSimilar to many other emerging real-world applications, smart\
    \ farming applications\nneed real-time processing of streaming big data [87,88].\
    \ Real-time data lead to real-time\ndecisions and actions [48]. In a smart farming\
    \ system, making fast and accurate decisions\nis a major goal. To achieve this\
    \ goal, we need mechanisms to collect and process the\ndiverse available data\
    \ sources in real time. These data are generated by different technolo-\ngies\
    \ including but not limited to IoT, robotics, drones, climate forecasting services,\
    \ and\nsmartphones. SFOBA [19] is a platform for big data processing which provides\
    \ real-time\nprocessing in many domains of agriculture. This platform integrates\
    \ different data sources,\ndata modeling, and software products to provide real-time\
    \ data analysis in farming ap-\nplications. Al-Thani et al. [89] investigated\
    \ the set-up process for the use of a drone in\nmonitoring sheep livestock. They\
    \ also used image processing and ML models in a real ﬁeld\napplication. With the\
    \ massive number of pictures from drones and new computer vision\nand deep learning\
    \ models, it is possible to predict diseases and pests through greenhouses\nand\
    \ farms. These technologies also can be used to estimate plant traits in real\
    \ time [90]. For\nexample, in the autonomous greenhouse, it is possible to develop\
    \ a model to estimate the\nleaf area, dry weight, and fresh weight of the lettuce\
    \ [91]. Real-time data lead to real-time\ndecisions and actions [48]. For example,\
    \ agile actions can be carried out in sudden changes\nin operational conditions\
    \ or other circumstances such as weather changes and disease\nprediction alerts.\n\
    In addition, the use of IoT, cloud computing, remote sensing, biotechnology, and\n\
    robotics is increasing in smart farming [48], transforming traditional into smart\
    \ farming.\nThese technologies can establish the networking of machines and control\
    \ farm activities\nautomatically and in real time [92]. As discussed, storing\
    \ data at intermediate points at the\n“edge” of the network rather than always\
    \ at the central server or data center leads to faster\ndata processing and a\
    \ shorter response time critical for real-time processing [93].\nTo analyze the\
    \ large agriculture data collected from ﬁelds and reveal hidden patterns of\n\
    interest from them, there is a need to develop forecasting models such as disease,\
    \ pests, and\nyield prediction models. Machine learning models that were mostly\
    \ used in the prediction\ninclude artiﬁcial neural network, support vector machine,\
    \ and logistic regression [76].\nThese algorithms can be integrated with data\
    \ analytics tools such as Map-Reduce and\nSpark for real-time analysis and better\
    \ performance [19,76].\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 838\n12 of 18\nUtilizing edge computing\
    \ provides another opportunity for data processing which is\nfederated learning\
    \ that can address a major concern in data processing for smart farming,\nwhich\
    \ is data sharing. Many farmers prefer to keep their data private, decreasing\
    \ their mo-\ntivation to participate in collaborative learning activities. Alternatively,\
    \ utilizing federated\nlearning, the learning model is distributed to the edge\
    \ nodes without sharing the farms’\ndata with a central unit in the system. This\
    \ approach reduces data privacy concerns and\nencourages farmers to participate\
    \ in cooperative learning processes.\n4.5. Security and Privacy\nSecurity and\
    \ privacy mechanisms are important requirements that should be consid-\nered throughout\
    \ a smart farming platform [4]. There are several solutions to secure a smart\n\
    farming platform against adversaries. Trust management is one of the mechanisms\
    \ that\ncan enhance the security and privacy of data in a smart farming platform.\
    \ It enables a\nservice provider to evaluate the trustworthiness of the actors\
    \ in the system and to set some\nrestrictions on the activities of low-trustable\
    \ parties. AgriTrust [94] is a trust management\napproach designed for smart farming\
    \ applications. This framework monitors the interac-\ntions in the system and\
    \ updates trust metrics such as credibility, robustness, and reliability\nthrough\
    \ time. Using this approach, smart farming devices broadcast their feedback on\
    \ each\ntransaction to the network, therefore, this feedback can be utilized by\
    \ the trust management\nframework for trustworthiness evaluation.\nAnother mechanism\
    \ for security enhancement in smart farming is access control\nwhich is a mechanism\
    \ to consider the policies and agreements to handle requests and\naccess permissions.\
    \ These permissions can be granted based on the roles and attributes\nor agreements.\
    \ For example, Chukkapalli et al. [95] proposed an Attribute-Based Access\nControl\
    \ (ABAC) in Smart Farming. ABAC utilizes policies that combine different attributes\n\
    from different sources, including user, data, device, and environment, and provides\
    \ ﬁne-\ngrained, ﬂexible access management. In this study, the authors modeled\
    \ a smart farming\necosystem with different agriculture sensors for temperature\
    \ and soil monitoring, tractor\nand truck movement controls, as well as labor\
    \ management, and presented a mechanism\nto handle access requests to data and\
    \ devices.\nIn smart farming scenarios, data are collected in the ﬁeld and usually\
    \ transferred to\non-premise or cloud storage servers [96]. Different technologies\
    \ are used for data transfer\nin agriculture, including Wi-Fi and cellular networks.\
    \ To protect data from adversaries\nin the transfer stage, encryption is a common\
    \ technique. For this purpose, the data are\nencrypted before transmission and\
    \ then decoded at the destination. Wen Xue et al. [97]\npresented an encryption\
    \ method for agricultural information systems. This method builds\nsecure communication\
    \ among users, farmers, and cloud servers. The statistical results in\nthe paper\
    \ showed that the presented method reduced the needed time for encryption as\n\
    compared with other available methods. Another encryption method for smart farming\n\
    applications was introduced by Ametepe et al. [98]. This study proposed a hybrid\
    \ method\ncombining two different cryptographic approaches, and then tested the\
    \ presented method\non a crop monitoring system.\nA platform for smart farming\
    \ can leverage the mentioned solutions, including trust\nmanagement, access control,\
    \ and encrypted data transmission to ensure that security and\nprivacy during\
    \ all stages of smart farming procedures, as shown in Figure 2. Another\nstate-of-the-art\
    \ technology that can be used for enhancing security and privacy in smart\nfarming\
    \ is the blockchain. This technology has been used in some agriculture applications\n\
    and could reshape smart farming ecosystems in the future. Blockchain technology\
    \ is a\ndistributed ledger that keeps the records of all previous transactions\
    \ in a system [99]. In\naddition, this technology enables automatic procedure\
    \ execution using smart contracts.\nA smart contract is a computer program that\
    \ can be deployed on a blockchain platform\nto run some procedures automatically\
    \ without human intervention [29]. In recent years,\nblockchain technology and\
    \ smart contracts have been widely used in different smart\nAgriculture 2022,\
    \ 12, 838\n13 of 18\nfarming applications, including trust management [100,101],\
    \ water management [102,103],\nfood traceability [104], and supply chain [105,106].\n\
    4.6. Regulation and Policies\nConsidering the available regulations and practices\
    \ in agriculture, a mechanism for\ncompliance with these rules is beneﬁcial in\
    \ a smart farming platform. The regulations\nrelated to smart farming cover different\
    \ aspects of agriculture, including but not limited to,\nfood security, biosecurity,\
    \ climate change, and data governance. In the following, some of\nthese regulations\
    \ in different jurisdictions are brieﬂy reviewed.\nThe European Union’s Common\
    \ Agricultural Policy (CAP) [107] is a uniﬁed policy\nacross Europe to support\
    \ farmers and to improve agricultural productivity. This policy\naims to improve\
    \ the farming economy, address concerns regarding climate changes, and\nmanage\
    \ natural resource consumption. In smart farming applications, the policy supports\n\
    technical progress to enhance agriculture productivity as well as reduce ecological\
    \ foot-\nprints. Another objective for the CAP is to control the availability\
    \ of supplies and to ensure\nthat the prices of products are reasonable for both\
    \ producers and customers. Another\nwidely used regulation under the European\
    \ Union’s jurisdiction is the European Union\n(EU) Code of Conduct on Agricultural\
    \ Data Sharing by Contractual Agreement [108]. The\nCommittee of Professional\
    \ Agricultural Organizations (COPA) and the General Confed-\neration of Agricultural\
    \ Cooperatives (COGECA) published this code of conduct in 2020.\nThis code mainly\
    \ focuses on non-personal data collected on farms and leaves the personal\ndata\
    \ to be treated under other regulations. The code indicates that due to the nature\
    \ of\ncollected data in agriculture, it is impossible to deﬁne data ownership\
    \ in the same way as\nphysical objects and it suggests using different levels\
    \ of rights. Therefore, the key step from\nthis code’s point of view is a contract\
    \ that determines the rights of all parties to protect\ntheir sensitive information,\
    \ while all permissions related to data collection, access, and\nutilization are\
    \ needed to be approved by the data originator. To evaluate the compliance\nof\
    \ a product or service with this code, a checklist consisting of ﬁfteen questions\
    \ has been\nprovided by the publishers. These questions specify the collected\
    \ data and the rights to\nshare, access, and use these data.\nIn addition, several\
    \ regulations related to smart farming are used in the U.S. juris-\ndiction. An\
    \ example is the U.S. agricultural policy [109] which covers different aspects\n\
    of agriculture such as trade, insurance, rural economic growth, bioenergy, and\
    \ organic\nfarming. This policy aims to support U.S. farmers, to enhance the productivity\
    \ of the farm-\ning process, and to reduce negative environmental impact. Generally,\
    \ in a ﬁve-year cycle,\nthe farm acts are updated to govern agriculture, food,\
    \ and rural development programs.\nIn the context of smart farming, this policy\
    \ considers different technologies such as GPS,\ncomputer mapping, guidance systems,\
    \ and variable-rate technology [110]. The Food Safety\nModernization Act (FSMA)\
    \ [111] is another law related to smart farming in the USA. This\nact aims to\
    \ enhance food safety and to prevent foodborne illness and has seven major rules\n\
    ensuring responsibility and accountability of different parties that work in the\
    \ agricultural\nsections. Different tools have been provided by the U.S. government\
    \ to facilitate product\ntracing, build food defense plans, and create food safety\
    \ plans. Another regulation related\nto smart farming in the U.S. jurisdiction\
    \ is the Privacy and Security Principles for Farm\nData (PSPFD) [112]. It was\
    \ established by the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) in\n2014. The principles\
    \ under this regulation are mostly around data ownership, consent, and\ndisclosure.\
    \ To ensure compliance with PSPFD, the AFBF has developed the Ag Data Trans-\n\
    parency Evaluator. This tool assesses contracts among agriculture stakeholders\
    \ against the\nprinciples provided in the PSPFD, and if the procedure is successful,\
    \ the contract gets an\nAg Data Transparency seal that informs the parties that\
    \ it has been approved.\nDespite the efforts on regulations related to big data\
    \ in smart farming, there are\nstill some gaps in this ﬁeld. One of the issues\
    \ is the lack of comprehensive and uniﬁed\nregulations for agriculture data, while\
    \ the available practices and a code of conduct are\nnot compulsory. To make the\
    \ most use of sources in digital agriculture, a smart farming\nAgriculture 2022,\
    \ 12, 838\n14 of 18\nplatform needs to provide mechanisms ensuring compliance\
    \ with available policies in\nsmart farming. A smart farming platform should encourage\
    \ the parties to trust the services\nprovided and participate in collaborative\
    \ practices that enhance the performance of data\nprocessing systems in agriculture\
    \ applications.\n5. Conclusions\nSmart farming provides the agricultural industry\
    \ with diverse data-driven services\nwhich improve different applications from\
    \ farm to fork. These services beneﬁt from a large\namount of available data in\
    \ smart farming ecosystems. However, a major challenge in\nsmart farming information\
    \ processing is consistency and compatibility among the utilized\ntechnologies,\
    \ procedures, and protocols. To address this issue, in this paper, we suggest\
    \ the\nplatform approach which is a design thinking approach that encourages different\
    \ actors in\na smart farming ecosystem to facilitate collaboration among different\
    \ services by following\nsome requirements. Moreover, we suggest six requirements\
    \ for a smart farming platform,\nincluding interoperability, real-time data processing,\
    \ scalability, reliability, security, and\ncompliance with farming regulations.\
    \ Such a platform can enhance the available services\nin the agriculture industry\
    \ by enabling collaboration among different service providers.\nFurthermore, such\
    \ a platform facilitates data-sharing practices by reducing security and\nprivacy\
    \ concerns and providing a trustable environment for agriculture data holders.\n\
    Currently, a major limitation to developing such a framework is the lack of uniﬁed\
    \ protocols\nand standards, and more effort from technology providers and policymakers\
    \ is needed\nto address this issue. In future work, we aim to develop and implement\
    \ a sample of the\nproposed framework. To this end, we plan to utilize the available\
    \ software and hardware\nproducts that follow similar protocols, and therefore,\
    \ are compatible.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, R.D. and M.A.-Z.;\

    Abstract. The rapid advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) has reshaped

    the industrial system, agricultural system, healthcare systems, and even our daily

    livelihoods, as the number of IoT applications is surging in these ﬁelds. Still,

    numerous challenges are imposed when putting in place such technology at large

    scale. In a system of millions of connected devices, operating each one of them

    manually is impossible, making IoT platforms unmaintainable. In this study, we

    present our attempt to achieve the autonomy of IoT infrastructure by building
    a

    platform that targets a dynamic and quick Plug and Play (PnP) deployment of

    the system at any given location, using predeﬁned pipelines. The platform also

    supports real-time data processing, which enables the users to have reliable and

    real-time data visualization in a dynamic dashboard.

    Introduction

    Enterprise architectures with a large number of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices

    impose challenging operational issues. It is possible to deal with these issues
    for a limited

    number of IoT devices, yet it is almost impossible to do likewise for many devices.
    We

    argue that a faster approach to tackle the operational issues of IoT by adopting
    the Plug

    and Play (PnP) concept in IoT architecture. IoT is a concept that builds a connection

    between all devices to the internet and facilitates communication with each other
    over

    the internet, with over 10 billion IoT devices wirelessly connected as of recently
    [1, 2].

    In today‘s IoT technology, the major requirement is an architecture which is capable
    of

    supporting a large number of devices and still provides reliable performance.
    With the

    increasing number of devices, it becomes exceedingly complex to add a new one
    to an

    existing platform, and to reduce the integration phase of the system, therefore
    the concept

    of PnP in a smart environment was ﬁrst proposed in 2006 [2]. The main objectives
    of PnP

    architecture in IoT systems are to reduce user intervention for system integration,
    and to

    have a real time solution from the system services. As an example, Helal et al.
    proposed

    a platform based on the PnP principle that enables a seamless integration of devices
    to

    the back-end systems without exterior interventions from integrators or engineers
    [3].

    Although the concept of PnP is very intriguing, the PnP based IoT systems’ reliability

    is the next big challenge. The reliability of a system can be evaluated by: the
    ability

    to perform a required task, ability to perform without failures, ability to perform
    under

    stated conditions, and ability to perform for a speciﬁed period [4].

    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 1 is the literature review
    of the

    existing architectures, implementation of IoT platforms, and visualization techniques.

    In Sect. 2, we propose our AMI IoT platform, wherein we give an overview of our

    architecture and implementations. In Sect. 3, we move into the details of our
    architecture

    and implementations of different components of the PnP base IoT architecture.
    In Sect. 4,

    we have the results and validation of our platform. We ﬁnally conclude the paper
    with a

    summary of our platform and its uniqueness compared to the other existing solutions
    in

    Sect. 5.

    Literature Review

    The reliability of PnP in IoT systems is linked to the diverse components of the
    IoT

    architecture. Therefore, there is a need to understand the different architectural
    imple-

    mentations for IoTplatforms that cover theexistingdomains. Inthefollowing, wediscuss

    the existing systems and their architectural implementations.

    IoT Platforms and Architectures The IoT architectures that exist today have an
    evolv-

    ing pattern, each new one overcomes the major challenges faced by the previous
    one.

    The initial approach was the three-layered architecture (Fig. 1.a) [5] with a
    limitation of

    having only the cloud layer for data processing, then came the Fog layer architecture,

    which resolved the limitations of cloud computing, by extending cloud-based services

    and bringing them closer to the IoT end-user environment, but it still had many
    issues

    on every layer, each distinguished by speciﬁc faults and errors that lead to an
    overall

    infective IoT system: * First, starting from the end-user layer, where the sensors
    and/or

    actuators recording environmental data could have reading errors [6]. * Second,
    the

    fog layer, where the gateways face a lack of memory, and processor overloading
    and

    overheating, which leads to serious issues in IoT systems [6, 7]. * Third, the
    network

    layer where communication links in the IoT system are frequently prone to breaking,

    malfunctioning (e.g., incorrect state), or unavailability of the medium [7]. *
    Fourth, the

    cloud layer with the challenge of sustaining all the different connected gateways,
    on

    both the computation and maintenance level.

    We run a generalized analysis on the existing IoT platforms based on the following

    metrics- the deployment duration, the real-time capability, the reliability of
    the system,

    the business layer (mainly the data visualization aspect), and ﬁnally the cost
    factor, and

    following are the results. The existing platforms can be classiﬁed into two major
    groups

    * Consumer IoT (e.g., OpenHAB [8], SmartThings [9], HomeKit [10]) and * Enter-

    prise IoT (e.g., AWS IoT [11], Watson IoT [12]), the dependencies of this classiﬁcation

    include functionality and contextual information, interoperability, scalability,
    security,

    and costs [13]. We can categorize the existing platforms into three sets. * The
    ﬁrst set of

    IoT Architecture with Plug and Play for Fast Deployment and System

    45

    Fig. 1. IoT (a) three-layered, (b) ﬁve-layered, and (c) Fog/IoT architectures
    [5]

    the platform involves a centralized hub (e.g., OpenHAB or SmartThings). The advan-

    tage is that it provides data processing and storage in the local settings meaning
    fast data

    processing and real-time visualization along with ofﬂine capabilities. The disadvantages

    include higher resource requirements, higher cost of the entire setup. This implemen-

    tation also involves a lot of user intervention for the conﬁguration of the system
    which

    hinders its scalability factor and in turn does not support the PnP aspect of
    IoT systems.

    * The second set, which involves the cloud implementations, avoids the initial
    involve-

    ment of the users to a greater extent along with no requirements of any speciﬁc
    hubs

    which reduces the cost (e.g., AWS IoT, Watson IoT). The major drawback is the
    real-time

    performance or the reliability of the system as it depends on the connectivity
    of the sys-

    tems. *The third set is the hybrid approach which uses most of the hub implementations

    and the cloud services. Watson IoT or AWS IoT or SmartThings have tried optimizing

    the entire platform pipeline by segregating them into the local edge processing
    and the

    cloud processing, but we still ﬁnd issues with deployments or installations due
    to the

    complexities of having to conﬁgure the environmental settings. The other major
    issue is

    the cost of the systems, which are often not affordable to all users.

    Plug and Play in IoT Platforms In order to overcome the abovementioned issues,
    sev-

    eral studies draw their attention to bring the idea of PnP into IoT platforms.
    Kim et al.

    [14] proposed using web semantics to manage IoT devices. In their approach all
    sensors

    and actuators are connected to Arduino boards as embedded IoT devices. Each Arduino

    can accept conﬁguration from central server and adapt their functionality to the
    new con-

    ﬁguration. Meanwhile, they developed a Knowledge Base which stores the conﬁguration

    of all supported devices and once a new device is connected, appropriate conﬁguration

    is shared with the device so that they can start collecting data or triggering
    actions to

    control the environment. As a result, they were able to reduce the complexity
    of deploy-

    ments and provide more dynamicity in IoT environments. However, they only focused

    on the perception layer and did not address the business and application layer,
    and how to

    visualize the result dynamically. *) Kim et al. [15] target a framework dynamic
    enough

    to integrate new sensors, devices or services to an environment. They proposed
    a device

    discovery service that (1) automatically detect and generate a description of
    the device

    46

    B. Abdulrazak et al.

    and its functionalities, and (2) integrating that same device seamlessly in the
    reasoning

    process without causing any interruption to platform or the framework functionality.

    *) Kesavan et al., bring forward the scalability and dynamic approach which is
    an essen-

    tial aspect for remote monitoring of patient data with real time analysis [16].
    In their

    proposed method they focused on the scalability of the system in accordance with
    the

    PnP approach. The gateway is capable of handling dynamic addition of sensors and

    is capable of handling data transmission in a seamless manner. Another aspect
    of this

    method is the edge analytics part which informs the users of the battery level
    status of

    the sensors used so that necessary actions can be taken when required.

    3

    AMI Platform

    To address all the drawbacks of the implementations described above, we built
    AMI

    platform, based on the fog layered architecture (Fig. 1.c). AMI platform architecture

    has ﬁve main layers (Fig. 2), the edge layer which includes all the sensing devices
    with

    different communication protocols, the fog layer which is tasked with preprocessing
    the

    acquired data before sending it to the above layers, then comes the network layer
    which

    deals with the communication protocols and the security and privacy of the data
    being

    transmitted to the cloud. The fourth layer is the cloud layer, where the data
    received is

    decoded and processed in speciﬁc models which are then stored in storage hubs.
    The

    ﬁnal layer is the business layer where the real-time data is visualized in a dynamic
    pattern

    through dashboards based on the user speciﬁcation. Our platform targets supporting
    PnP

    features in all the presented layers, and as well as the link between them.

    3.1

    Architecture Overview

    The AMI Platform involves a set of physical (i.e., sensing devices and computing
    hard-

    ware) and logical (i.e., software applications and virtual computing resources)
    com-

    ponents that collect, process, transmit, store, and analyze data. These components
    are

    layered following Fog Computing architecture.

    The physical gateway is situated in the end-user environment. It represents the
    fog

    layer and thus the bridge connecting the sensor devices in the end-user layer
    with the

    network layer. Additionally, a virtual gateway is located inside the cloud infrastructure

    as an extension of the network layer, to receive the data transmitted through
    the network

    layer, and push it to the cloud storage. The beneﬁt of the separation is to utilize
    the

    computing resources on the gateways for pre-processing and ensuring the quality
    of

    service. A common challenge with the physical gateways is the deployment and update

    of the numerous services that are running on them that handle the communication
    and

    acquisition of data from sensors. Our focus while designing and building the physical

    gateway was to ensure the ease of PnP integration of a “Pipeline” that automatically

    or semi-automatically handles the deployment of said services. The data ﬂows through

    the platform as follows: First, at the end-user layer, a cluster of heterogeneous
    sensors

    collects both environmental (e.g., temperature, motion, location) and biomedical
    (e.g.,

    heart rate, breathing rate, sleep pattern) data. Next, the data is sent to the
    physical

    gateway for pre-processing and pushed to the cloud layer via a secure channel
    created

    by the network layer. Upon arriving at the cloud layer, the data will be decoded,
    processed

    in speciﬁc formats, and stored in databases. The business layer is for the user
    interface

    which also has models for dynamic graphs and charts creation which helps for a
    better

    adaptation of data visualization for any kind of user need. We also propose a
    different

    approach to resolve the existing challenges of scalability and maintainability
    based on

    microservices, where the different functional components of the system are split
    into

    independent applications [17].

    3.2

    Edge Layer

    In the context of IoT, the end-user layer is located in the monitored person’s
    living

    environment, and it is considered the entry point of the platform. It consists
    of a set

    of sensing devices of heterogeneous nature that observe key parameters of both
    the

    living environment and the person in multiple dimensions. *) Wearable Sensors
    (e.g.,

    Apple Watch, Garmin Watch, Fitbit Watch, Mi Bands, Pulse Oximeters), which are

    installed and/or implanted on participants’ bodies (e.g., wrist, ﬁngers) to monitor
    their

    everyday activities, provide various measurements, including motion (e.g., acceleration,

    step count, distance walking), location (e.g., attitude, longitude, altitude),
    biomedical

    information (e.g., heart rate, heart rate viability, breathing rate, and oxygen
    saturation).

    One major advantage of wearable sensors is their portability: the participants
    can eas-

    ily carry the devices either at their home, doing outdoor activities, or during
    clinical

    assessment. However, this type of sensor also shows limitations under speciﬁc
    circum-

    stances. Because the patient’s expertise in advanced technologies cannot be guaranteed,

    ensuring proper charging, usage, and maintenance of the devices are challenging
    tasks.

    48

    B. Abdulrazak et al.

    *) To overcome these limitations, there is the second type of sensing devices,
    Environ-

    mental Sensors (e.g., door/window, motion, temperature, illuminance, and humidity

    sensors) that are designed to track indoor environmental parameters and patients’
    ADL

    continuously while maintaining their autonomy and independence [18]. These sensors

    are often installed in ﬁxed positions (e.g., wall, door, and window) inside a
    subjective

    room. *) Additionally, other sensors can be placed or connected to furniture such
    as

    the smart mat device, a highly sensitive micro-bend ﬁber optic sensor (MFOS) often

    placed on top of the bed (under the mattress or bed sheet) or on a char non-intrusively
    to

    monitor location information and vital signs (e.g., heart rate (HR), breathing
    rate (BR),

    Ballistocardiograph (BCG)), which enables the possibility of detecting sleep cycles
    and

    sleep disorders, such as Apnea [19].

    3.3

    Fog Layer

    Our implementation of the fog layer is represented as a physical gateway, that
    acts as the

    hub for multiple devices with different communication protocols. The physical
    gateway

    hasthefollowingmajorfunctionalities:*)Dataacquisition:thegatewaysupportsdiverse

    communication protocols, e.g., Z-Wave, Insteon, Bluetooth, Serial line communications,

    and other similar protocols. Each adapter is an abstract layer for the hardware
    and

    constantly listens to its corresponding sensor. It also enables easy and reliable
    integration

    of new devices (PnP concept in sensor installation [20]) with the same set of
    protocols.

    *) Preprocessing of data: the raw data obtained from heterogeneous sensors suffers

    from poor interoperability, so the data format varies between different types
    of sensors,

    leading to difﬁculties in data interpretation and transmission. Therefore, we
    developed a

    data model library to overcome this issue. The data model library enables the
    gateway to

    pre-process the data by adding semantic information and populating its values
    into one

    of the compatible formats. *) Data Transfer: The next step is the transfer of
    data from the

    edge layer to the network layer, the processed data is sent through network protocols,
    for

    example, the messaging protocol called Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT)

    or the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) protocol. Currently, in our implementation,

    we are using MQTT as it has a publish-and-subscribe architecture where the client

    devices and applications publish and subscribe to topics handled by a broker.
    *) Status

    Updates: The other service offered by the gateway is the system or status updates.
    All

    the above-mentioned services require system resources and to avoid failures the
    system

    check services provide live status updates of the resources, for example, CPU,
    memory,

    and internet connectivity.

    3.4

    Network Layer

    Sending conﬁdential data and information over the internet is vulnerable to attacks,
    so it

    is critical to create a secure channel for connections, which is taken care of
    by the network

    layer, the subspace between the physical gateway (at the edge of the end-user
    layer) and

    the virtual gateway (at the edge of the cloud layer). A great amount of effort
    is put into

    securing the network connection. *) Firstly, a virtual network is created to establish
    a

    peer-to-peer secure channel between the two gateways, adding an extra layer of
    security

    to our protocol of communication. The advantages of the software network solution
    are

    IoT Architecture with Plug and Play for Fast Deployment and System

    49

    efﬁciency and quick adaptability. It takes advantage of the existing internet
    connection

    instead of setting up a new one. In our platform, we use OpenVPN to implement
    this

    secure channel. OpenVPN is an open-source virtual private network (VPN) system

    that creates routing and bridging connections between entities. An OpenVPN server

    automatically issues certiﬁcates for our physical and virtual gateways, triggered
    by their

    respective deployment pipelines, and then stores them in a secure storage hub.
    This

    approach limits the risks of transporting the certiﬁcates/keys from one entity
    to another

    one. *) lastly, enforce the ﬁrewall rule by allowing only a small number of essential

    connections and blocking all others. All communication between the physical gateways

    and virtual gateway goes through this channel, securing the conﬁdential data transmitted

    between them.

    3.5

    Cloud Layer

    The cloud layer is responsible for the management, storage of the collected data.
    Con-

    sidering the essential need for a real-time monitoring solution, the cloud infrastructure

    needs to have minimal delay and downtime, to allow for a reliable and real-time
    visual-

    ization and analysis. Hence, the agent-based microservices approach is adopted
    on the

    cloud layer. Each component on the cloud layer is containerized using Docker daemon.

    This allows easy deployment of components anywhere without having to worry about

    the speciﬁcs of the underlying platform.

    Virtual Gateway: Being the contact point of the cloud layer, the virtual gateway
    is

    created from a pre-built docker image and plays a crucial part in the platform.
    It connects

    with its peer physical gateway through the VPN in the network layer, receives
    data

    with the conﬁgured communication protocols (e.g., MQTT, REST), and reconstructs

    the data message using a mapping function to meet the requirement of the data
    storage.

    However, managing on the physical gateway the rapid evolution of sensors’ data
    models

    and numerous deployments of physical gateways requires a manual conﬁguration and

    intervention before every deployment and after every update. This challenge pushed
    us

    to build the gateway in a way that will allow for a PnP integration seamlessly
    with a

    pipeline that automates its deployments, and updates.

    Data Storage: IoT data representation and storage are an ever-changing and expanding

    ﬁeld, with this in mind we have opted to use a non-relation database, or more
    speciﬁcally

    document based. The advantages of this are: 1) ﬁrst the dynamicity and ﬂexibility
    of

    document-based databases, which is particularly useful for our platform due to
    the evo-

    lution of data generated by IoT devices over time, and by eliminating the time
    required

    to adapt or update the structure of tables or other entities to allow inserting
    new ﬁelds or

    data models; 2) second the horizontal scalability of non-relational databases,
    as opposed

    to vertical scalability of relational databases [21]. As consequence, keeping
    up with the

    increase in either the volume or velocity is only a question of adding more nodes
    to the

    database cluster. This architecture also ensures higher availability because,
    if any node

    fails, all its functions will be delegated to other nodes in that cluster. Our
    choice of data

    storage is Elasticsearch, an open-source distributed search and analytics engine
    at the

    center of the Elastic Stack [22]. It supports various commonly used data types,
    including

    numerical, textual, keywords, state, and multi-dimensional.

    Business Layer

    Data Visualization: Environmental and wearable sensors acquire a massive amount
    of

    data, e.g., on average, 1.2 to 1.8 million entries per day during the course of
    our ﬁrst

    deployment. With such amount of data constantly generated, it is crucial to develop

    an appropriate visualization tool that can present collected information in real-time
    to

    provide better assistance to the end-users. However, the variety of needs, roles,
    and

    metrics in different applications along with changes in needs over time make it
    difﬁcult

    to have only one dashboard to ﬁt all the needs. Our adaptive solution enables
    even users

    without technical knowledge to create a dashboard adapted to their needs in minimal

    time.

    Fig. 3. Approach for adaptive data visualization

    In our architecture, a unique approach is taken to ensure PnP by visualizing data

    adaptively (Fig. 3). We ﬁrst choose web-based technologies to create our system
    due

    to their accessibility. Unlike traditional software that is tied to a speciﬁc
    system, web

    applications are reachable from multiple platforms, including desktop, mobile,
    tablets,

    and smart TV. Through these web-based solutions, we enable users to dynamically
    deﬁne

    the environment and add sensors to it. When the environment model is deﬁned, they
    can

    design the dashboard based on their needs which will be adapted to the environment

    automatically. This system consists of three major components:

    1) Chart Template Designer: Empower users to dynamically design charts and save

    them as templates speciﬁc to each type of sensors. Users can choose the data source

    and visually generate queries to ﬁlter data for charts. Once the user ﬁnalizes
    the chart

    design, the conﬁguration of the designed chart is stored in our data storage,
    and the

    deﬁned query is parsed to accept parameters in order to enable linking the designed

    charts to external parameters. The ﬁrst step to design charts is to retrieve required
    data

    from the data source. We used a query builder tool to allow users to deﬁne their
    intended

    criteria to ﬁlter fetched data. We added the concept of chart template to our
    platform in

    which when a request is sent to view a chart, the conﬁguration of the chart along
    with

    other information will be loaded. Thus, the designed system gives the user ﬂexibility
    to

    reuse designed charts in many places by only passing the required parameters (e.g.,
    a

    device id).

    2) Environment Conﬁguration Tool: This tool enables non-technical users to create
    a

    3D model of the deployment environment, input the address and occupants, and place

    IoT Architecture with Plug and Play for Fast Deployment and System

    51

    items, furniture, and predeﬁned sensors using simple drag-and-drop actions [Fig.
    4].

    The output of this component is used by Dashboard Designer and Reasoner Engine
    to

    generate the intended design and knowledge for each space in this environment.
    We

    deﬁned the concept of “Space” in our platform as a group of sensors, associated
    with a

    place. The output generated by this tool is a number of “Spaces,” each of them
    includes

    several sensors and descriptive information about the area. This form of output
    enables

    all other consumer components to adapt themselves to the different Spaces.

    Fig. 4. 3D representation of the environment

    3) Dashboard Designer: Allows users to dynamically design their desired pages
    accord-

    ing to the needs. This designer incorporates conﬁguration tool data and designed
    chart

    templates to visualize sensors information on the pages automatically. Users can
    drag

    and drop necessary components to the page and easily move the elements and change

    components’ size to achieve the desired design. A rich set of components are added
    to

    the designer which enables users to add and customize pages and link them to environ-

    mental sensors. Once the design is ﬁnished, the design will be applied to the
    all provided

    “Spaces,” received from conﬁguration tool and the data sources for elements in
    each page

    will be adapted to the related environment automatically. e.g., a user may design
    a chart

    to visualize room temperature, they can design it for one room and the dashboard
    engine

    will adapt the chart for other rooms provided by conﬁguration tool and replace
    all the

    required parameters to visualize data related to each room. Another layer of ﬂexibility

    is provided by allowing users to customize the elements for one speciﬁc environment
    so

    that they can fully adjust the design and deliver the data collected from sensors
    instantly

    to intended users. To manage the access level of designed pages, we built an integrated

    authentication system based on JWT tokens, each token contains information about
    the

    user and their assigned roles. Once a user logs into the system, a token is automatically

    added to the requests which allows the server to authenticate users. This authentication

    52

    B. Abdulrazak et al.

    service is integrated with our designer to allow speciﬁc groups of users to have
    access

    to certain pages.

    4

    Pipelines

    To speed up the process of PnP deploying and running the system, we have created
    a

    set of pipelines to automate the deployment of all services on every layer of
    the Fog

    Computing Architecture. It is a three steps process that starts from a sensor-gateway

    connection and ends with a running, real-time dashboard.

    4.1

    Gateway

    The gateway acting as the hub is capable of handling multiple sensors simultaneously.

    For the installation of the services to provide the functionalities described
    in the previous

    section, we use Ansible to automatize the process. The ansible scripts are divided
    into

    three sections, ﬁrst group of scripts are tasked with installation of all the
    required depen-

    dencies that our services would be needing to run properly in the system, along
    with this

    the setting up of ﬁrewall rules and other security aspects are also taken care
    of by these

    group of scripts, the second section includes the installation scripts for all
    the services

    provided by our platform, from cloning the repositories to providing them the
    execution

    rights to act as a system service is being handled in this section. The third
    section is

    the self-healing installation phase, it installs services that are used for monitoring
    the

    system resources, and report back for cases of abnormalities. This approach results
    in

    a signiﬁcant decrease in user complexity and errors in the installation phase.
    Once the

    installation is done the gateway nodes are ready to plug and play for any deployment.

    The time taken for this installation phase of the deployment process is approximately

    less than thirty minutes. The gateway nodes have OpenVPN installed during this
    process,

    which gives them a secure connection to the servers to communicate with.

    4.2

    Server

    The server pipeline consists of two main steps, both of which are automated with
    a script

    as well and require only the identiﬁer of the gateway being deployed for an easy
    PnP

    solution. Each step corresponds to a layer in the Fog Computing Architecture.
    The ﬁrst

    step is the conﬁguration of the Network Layer by registering the gateway certiﬁcates
    in

    the VPN server and then setting up ﬁrewall rules to only accommodate the ports
    used

    by our services, thus protecting the connection between the server and the gateway
    by

    ﬁltering and blocking all other trafﬁc from gaining unauthorized access. The second

    step is to conﬁgure the node microservice that is responsible for receiving and
    pushing

    the data into our storage hub. As we support multiple communication protocols,
    the

    microservices need to be conﬁgured to a speciﬁc protocol before their deployment.

    Once the execution of the deployment script ﬁnishes, the gateway would be able
    to

    connect to our VPN server and start sending the data collected from the sensors
    and

    actuators to our node microservice, which will then be pushed to our data store.

    53

    4.3

    Dashboard

    This step completes the IoT cycle by offering a plug-and-lay solution to design
    a dash-

    board where we can monitor the collected data in real-time. The ﬁrst step is to
    design the

    Environment in our 3D conﬁguration tool where we would create the 3D space where

    we have deployed our gateway and communicate with it to collect the list of sensors
    and

    actuators that have been deployed in the environment. Right after we feed the
    generated

    Environment Model to our Dashboard Designer to automatically generate a view for
    all

    the spaces in the environment and the devices that have been deployed in each
    space.

    The user has full ﬂexibility to design the required pages.

    Results and Analysis/Validation

    Our platform was deployed for a project which validates the working of our architectural

    metrics. The project was conducted for a span of six months at an apartment in
    AMI. The

    main goal of the project was to monitor the behavior change of a person based
    on the

    type of medication received at different stages of medical intervention. For the
    platform

    analysis, the metrics we targeted in this deployment are as follows:

    5.1

    Fast Deployment

    We deployed in an apartment to monitor the behavior of a person and to mark the
    changes

    with the change of medication provided to that person. In this deployment, we
    deployed

    two nodes (Raspberry PIs), ﬁve door sensors, and seven motion sensors, along with

    a sleep mat. The steps followed in the deployment of our platform in the apartment

    are as follows: scouting of the area to have a better understanding of the environment,

    start connecting our nodes to the power outlets and conﬁguring them with the network

    available in the apartment, once the node conﬁguration is done with the network
    we

    start attaching the sensors at different places in the apartment like the walls
    and doors,

    with the completion of our entire setup the ﬁnal step is to check the system performance

    and the data being transmitted to our servers. This entire deployment, from attaching

    the sensors to the walls and doors in every bedrooms and kitchen and living room,
    to

    deploying the nodes to set up the network for the nodes, took us less than two
    hours in

    the apartment.

    5.2

    System Reliability

    The key challenge in any IoT system is the reliability of the platform. Reliability
    in

    this context refers to system failures and the efﬁciency of the platform in providing

    the decided upon services through various technical and non-technical challenges.
    The

    technical challenges include the resources of the system, the CPU and memory capacities

    might fail or overﬂow with time resulting in an unreliable system. The non-technical

    challenges include internet failures, the ofﬂine capability of a system is a big
    challenge

    in the development of any IoT system nowadays. In our deployment, we received
    certain

    reporting on our system status (Fig. 5) which highlighted the warnings related
    to CPU

    usage, physical memory usage, internet connectivity, and service resource consumption.

    54

    5.3

    Real-Time Data Processing

    In the healthcare system, a real-time platform is essential because of the impact
    each

    data might contain. For example, heart rate monitoring systems cannot have a huge
    delay

    for patients with cardiac issues. In IoT, there are very few systems in the market
    that can

    provide a real-time data processing platform. The deployment of our platform was
    at

    an apartment in Sherbrooke, Canada, which is around 10 kms (about 6.21 mi) from
    our

    servers. Our architecture has proven to be able to provide a real-time data processing

    and visualization technique with an average delay of less than one second (Fig.
    6). We

    have a speciﬁc model for the data encapsulation in which we have two timestamps,
    the

    ﬁrst timestamp (phenomenonTime.instant in Fig. 6) is recorded at the moment the
    data

    is received from the sensors and the other timestamp (resultTime in Fig. 6) is
    noted after

    the data is processed in the gateway and is ready to be transmitted. Based on
    these two

    timestamps we see that there is very little to no delay being added in our data
    processing

    period.

    Discussion: Lessons Learned

    The results obtained with the deployment of our platform showcase our real-time
    success

    however we faced a few major challenges throughout the period of deployment. The

    ﬁrst major challenge was the sensors or device malfunctioning. Now our platform
    is

    dependent on third-party manufacturers for the devices and the sensors which hinder
    the

    performance of our system. One of the deployed sensors stopped working due to
    some

    manufacturing issues in the very ﬁrst week of deployment. We quickly resolved
    the issue,

    by changing the sensor with a new one, as our system has a continuous monitoring
    aspect

    which informed us about the failure in a short time interval. Using trusted manufacturers

    for the devices might lead to higher prices but comes with greater reliability.
    The second

    challenge was with memory leaks. Currently, the physical gateways (in our case,
    the

    raspberry pi) have a limited memory resource. Due to the explicit number of services

    runningtherewas amemoryleakconcerningtheloggingof issues. This issuewas quickly

    resolved with the introduction of another self-monitoring service which monitored
    the

    overall memory usage of the system along with speciﬁc usages by each service.
    If the

    usage surpasses a speciﬁc threshold the logs are rotated and the unwanted system
    logs are

    deleted. Along with this our visualization platform provided a great level of
    ﬂexibility

    and enabled us to design desired content for our deployments. However, there are
    still

    spaces left for improvement, especially when users add a large number of visualizations

    and charts. The high-frequency data generated by some devices (namely smart mats)

    was another challenge for visualization which we were able to overcome in the
    new

    versions of our platform. For our future works, we have already advanced on some
    new

    self-healing concepts [23] and distributed architecture to provide better performance

    while maintaining the quality of service (QoS) of our IoT platform.

    Conclusion

    Faster PnP deployments of IoT platforms with reliable performance, especially
    in tack-

    ling real-time data processing, is a challenge that hinders wider implementation
    of most

    IoT solutions. Thus, we focus in this paper on the approach to addressing these
    key issues.

    We start this paper by reviewing the progress of the research works related to
    IoT archi-

    tectures and platforms that are in the market. After analyzing the existing solution,
    we

    come across the deﬁnitive drawbacks, and we present our architecture and IoT platform

    which addresses these drawbacks. We also detailed in this paper each of the components

    of the architecture and described how components are connected to overcome the
    said

    drawbacks. The logic in our business layer provides for a unique approach to handling

    user speciﬁcations by creating dynamic dashboards. We highlighted the success
    and

    the challenges faced during the six months of deployment of our system in a residence

    which acts as proof of concept for our main objectives. It also opened the possibility
    of

    future developments and improvements. We target in our future work to focus more
    on

    the quality-of-service (QoS) nature of the platform and to have a distributed
    architecture

    to enhance our scalability aspect.

    Highlights • Reviews over than two hundred papers, that provide a contribution
    to knowledge by establishing the linkages between new 4.0 trends in technologies
    and Agri-Food Supply Chain Challenges. • A compressive state of the art of Agri-Food
    4.0 related technologies is covered. • Reviews and contributes on the digital
    technologies to the new supply chain methods in Agri-Food. • Links to the agri-food
    supply chain challenges. • Presents new trends and models in agri-food supply
    chains. Abstract The term “Agri-Food 4.0” is an analogy to the term "Industry
    4.0", coming from the concept “agriculture 4.0”. Since the origins of the industrial
    revolution, where the steam engines started the concept of Industry 1.0 and later
    the use of electricity upgraded the concept to Industry 2.0, the use of technologies
    generated a milestone in the industry revolution by addressing the Industry 3.0
    concept. Hence, Industry 4.0, it is about including and integrating the latest
    developments based on digital technologies as well as the interoperability process
    across them. This allows enterprises to transmit real-time information in terms
    behaviour and performance. Therefore, the challenge is to maintain these complex
    networked structures efficiently linked and organised within the use of such technologies,
    especially to identify and satisfy supply chain stakeholders dynamic requirements.
    In this context, the agriculture domain is not an exception although it possesses
    some specialities depending from the domain. In fact, all agricultural machinery
    incorporates electronic controls and has entered to the digital age, enhancing
    their current performance. In addition, electronics, using sensors and drones,
    support the data collection of several agriculture key aspects, such as weather,
    geographical spatialization, animals and crops behaviours, as well as the entire
    farm life cycle. However, the use of the right methods and methodologies for enhancing
    agriculture supply chains performance is still a challenge, thus the concept of
    Industry 4.0 has evolved and adapted to agriculture 4.0 in order analyse the behaviours
    and performance in this specific domain. Thus, the question mark on how agriculture
    4.0 support a better supply chain decision-making process, or how can help to
    save time to farmer to make effective decision based on objective data, remains
    open. Therefore, in this survey, a review of more than hundred papers on new technologies
    and the new available supply chains methods are analysed and contrasted to understand
    the future paths of the Agri-Food domain. Previous article in issue Next article

    to support rural employment and to make a considerable contribution to territorial
    development. Even though they have always been considered a cornerstone of agricultural
    activity in the European Union (EU), this sector most often suffers from very
    low efficiency and effectiveness, sensitivity to weather, market disruptions and
    other external factors, such as poor agriculture supply chain stakeholders’ linkages
    and communication, especially at the food processing level. In fact, and as stablished
    by the FAO,1 under an approach from “field to fork” the agriculture supply chain
    structures can also be named Agri-Food supply chains, where main events coming
    from the agricultural production of food to the food processing events, including
    trading, are linked. Across this Agri-Food Supply Chain, in most of the cases,
    the transferred agriculture knowledge, from generation to generation, is paramount
    from a cultural point of view, but most of the time, it does not answer to the
    needs nor the requirements of the Agri-Food Supply Chains. Furthermore, such delineation
    does not exist also between farms as economic units and farmers who are producing
    food, mostly, for their own consumption. However, no formal delineation to what
    is a “small” and/or a “large” farm formally exists that is holistically accepted,
    it depends on several factors, such as countries, regions, politics, strategies,
    market shares amongst many others. Nonetheless, there are two criteria to classify
    farm size: standard output (in economic terms) and utilised agricultural area
    (UAA), as alternative measure2 . In this same line, Eurostat3 predicts that, by
    2026, an increment of 4%–6% in agriculture cost savings, as well as an increment
    of 3 % in market value, will be regarded to the use and development of smart agriculture.
    Hence, “Agriculture 4.0″ emerges to provide advanced technologies to the famers
    in order to meet agri-food production challenges, hence, to achieve more affordable
    prices for open market and the minimum cost for farmers. Thus, the expectation
    for the further coming years, is that Agri-Food 4.0 should help meeting sustainable
    challenges by increasing the agri-food supply chain stakeholders revenues as well
    as decreasing their pressure for handling complex and external factors they cannot
    control, such as weather, market behaviours and policies, but also to react on
    time by visualising current trends in needs. This paper focus principally on the
    factory farm model issued from the European and north American style. In those
    typologies of farms the Industry 4.0 elements can be introduced and merged with
    the agricultural domain to create the Agri-Food 4.0. The focus is more specialised
    on the industrial farming although the Agri-Food 4.0 is started to be adapted
    also to the organic and silvo-pasture paradigms. Thus, this paper, considering
    a review over than two hundred papers, provides a contribution to knowledge by
    establishing the linkages between new 4.0 trends in technologies and Agri-Food
    Supply Chain Challenges, which opens the 4.0 research field for a multidisciplinary
    work. The choice of the literature review methodology focused firstly on key words
    related to the Agri-food technology, then the second approach was to focus on
    selected journals and at the end we looked for the data-based repository and the
    linked publications. To accomplish this, the structure in this paper is as follows:
    in the first place, a compressive state of the art of Agri-Food 4.0 related technologies
    is covered. In the second place, a review and contribution coming from digital
    technologies to the new supply chain methods in Agri-Food shows linkages with
    next trends and technologies. Next, and linked to the agri-food supply chain challenges,
    the fourth section presents new trends and models in agri-food supply chains,
    especially in the domain of risk management, collaboration, governance, cold chain
    management, globalization, information and communication technologies, Logistics,
    supply chain structures and sustainable agri-food supply chains. Finally, the
    fifth section covers the main conclusions, visions and perspectives for this novel
    research. 2. Agri-food 4.0 and technologies state-of-the-art The agricultural
    sector has been active in digital innovation for decades already. Especially the
    advances in Precision Agriculture, remote sensing, robots, farm management information
    systems, and (agronomic) decision support systems have paved the way for a broad
    digital transformation in farming and food (Pedro and Gonzalez-Andujar, 2019).
    Recent developments, such as Cloud Computing, Internet of Things, Big Data, Blockchain,
    Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, allow for the integration of so far isolated
    lines of development into smart, connected systems of systems. Those technologies
    will let the agriculture to evolve in a data-driven, intelligent, agile and autonomous
    connected system of systems. The operations of each agricultural process will
    be automatically integrated in the food chain through the semantically active
    technologies up to the end consumer. The 4th industrial revolution is now reaching
    agriculture. The digital platform (DP) concept emerged as an integration of heterogeneous
    mainly open software solutions for ecosystem building (Yablonsky, 2018). The EU
    promote the creation of digital platforms for several application domains as manufacturing
    (i.e. FoF 11 – 2016 projects, DT-ICT-07-2018-2019, etc.), construction (BIM + calls),
    etc. As a concentration of technology enablers, research on DP covers several
    issues such as software engineering (Guertin and Van Benthem, 2016; Wang et al.,
    2006), process simulation and development (Zhao and Yao, 2016; Hu et al., 2016),
    features analysis (Wang et al., 2014), resource performance (Mocnej et al., 2018),
    test algorithms (Santiago et al., 2017) or performance control (Sahota et al.,
    2011). The technological platforms allow access to the different stakeholders
    and provide deployment capabilities for IT solutions. These solutions are exposed
    by service providers or developed by software engineers. Agricultural Data management
    and exploitation is the central node between digital transformation capabilities
    and the agriculture concerns. The main research issues concern the consolidation
    of data repositories with open data (Gumaste and Kadam, 2016) (weather, maps,
    etc.), governance data (policies, local regulation, etc.) and domain specific
    data from end users. Data typology is very rich (land, location, energy, climate,
    climate impact, etc.) and data volume is continually increasing by the integration
    of sensors and IoT platforms in agriculture (Amandeep et al., 2017; Biradar and
    Shabadi, 2017). Data engineering effort covers pattern definition (Laube et al.,
    2011; Spekken et al., 2016), classification algorithms (Narvaez et al., 2018;
    Shi et al., 2015; Yalcin and Razavi, 2016), correlation analysis (Nilsson et al.,
    2016; Xavier et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2017), etc. All those technologies provide
    engineering capabilities for agricultural data. The implementation of these techniques
    will handle farmers data, will integrate new data repositories from external providers,
    will transform data to knowledge and feed decision support systems. The data transparency
    enabler with necessary sharing policies will accelerate data ingestion and ejection
    processes. 2.1. Big data technologies Research activities in Big Data provide
    relevant results in several application domains (healthcare, marketing, maritime,
    urban, manufacturing, etc.). The Big Data Value Association (BDVA)4 promote the
    application of bigdata in different domains (Belaud et al., 2019). The Big Data
    Grapes EU project5 provides data semantic, analytics, integration and exploitation
    solutions as well as a software stack for grapes agriculture. As additional ongoing
    research issues, we identified tools and technology development (Devarakonda et
    al., 2014; Hashem and Ranc, 2016), analytic methods and services (Malhotra et
    al., 2017; Deka and Walczak, 2017), clustering methods (Balan et al., 2015), transformation
    algorithms (Penar and Wilczek, 2016; Hashem and Ranc, 2016) performance and data
    processing technics (Wu and Zhao, 2009), data source and storage management (Cha
    et al., 2018; RubyDinakar and Vagdevi, 2017), etc. The integration of Big Data
    technologies in Agri-Food projects plays an important role in: the extension of
    farmers data to create new knowledge; the creation of innovative services and
    processes by IT providers and software developers as well as the extension and
    the adaptation of ICT and Factories of the Future (FoF)6 related Big Data models
    and patterns for agriculture. There are several Big Data Repositories that guarantee,
    nowadays, the access and the exploitation to Agri-Food data. As example: the “National
    Climatic Data Centre” (about 2,9 Go per day); Satellite Imagery and metrological
    information from Google and the NASA Earth Exchange; Soil, water and geospatial
    data from the National Resources Conservation Service (US); the OpenCorporates
    as the world’s largest open repository of companies (165 million companies around
    the word); etc. 2.2. Internet of things technologies The integration of IoT platforms
    in agriculture provides additional data sources describing agricultural features
    (water, soil, humans, animals, etc.) with more data. The recent research issues
    on IoT highlight the multiplication of IoT platforms. This expansion generates
    new implementation frameworks (Lee et al., 2018; Choi et al., 2018) answering
    to different requirement models, new networks of heterogeneous components and
    sensors with different monitoring models (Pflanz et al., 2018; Vergara et al.,
    2017; Prathibha et al., 2017), time processing scheme and misbalanced energy consumption
    (Ruano et al., 2018; Jarolimek et al., 2016). The integration of the IoT platforms
    with the agricultural issues could add additional research challenges, specifically
    when the data are stocked or used in the cloud, in terms of interoperability (Panetto,
    2007; Mocnej et al., 2018; Zarko et al., 2017; Hefnawy et al., 2017; Martinez
    et al., 2016; Leal et al., 2019; Panetto et al., 2016) (protocols, security, etc.),
    performance monitoring (Paulraj et al., 2018; Mekala and Viswanathan, 2017), etc.
    In addition, IoT serves Robotics (Murar and Brad, 2015) and Automated Guided Vehicles
    (AGV) (Sanchez-Hermosilla et al., 2013). An interesting activity might be the
    benchmarking of all the existing IoT platforms and their proposed functionalities
    and mapping them with Agri-Food stakeholders’ requirements. The integration of
    IoT capabilities will support farmers in the harvesting of new data sources to
    create new valuable services. 2.3. Knowledge model approaches The development
    of valuable knowledge models in agriculture aims to transform shared multi-sources
    data repositories to create profitable services and support the decision making
    for different stakeholders. Recent research topics address precise data collection
    and engineering to serve knowledge creation of new farming models (Abdullah et
    al., 2017; Irmak et al., 2006), technology application in farming (Chen and Jin,
    2011; Gerhards et al., 2012; Singh et al., 2013), resource allocation (Garcia
    et al., 2005; Jang et al., 2017; Musacchio and Grant, 2002), assessment frameworks
    (for risk, policies definition and quality management) (Jacxsens et al., 2016;
    Louwagie et al., 2012) as well as the qualification of decision models (Costanzo
    and Faro, 2012; Dragincic et al., 2015) and the identification of decision parameters
    (region, land, climate, plant, time, process, etc.). 2.4. Artificial intelligence
    techniques Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques propose important contributions
    to knowledge model’s identification, service creation and the decision-making
    processes as support for the different Agri-Food’s applications (Solemane et al.,
    2019). AI offers formal general algorithms for prediction (Bhatt and Buch, 2015;
    Soh et al., 2018), accuracy and performance evaluation (Jeon et al., 2017) as
    well as pattern classification (Ott et al., 2003; Pinho et al., 2011; Starr, 2005)
    that might solve knowledge issues in the agricultural domain such as the pest’s
    identifications and the correct treating methods. In addition, AI supports applications
    in farming technics development: land allocation regarding the targeted activity
    (Pokhrel et al., 2018), irrigation process analysis and control (Ait-Mouheb et
    al., 2018; Mohanraj et al., 2017), robot guidance (Tian et al., 2018; Roshanianfard
    et al., 2018; Sheridan, 2016), etc. 2.5. Smart agriculture Smart agriculture emerges
    as a main concept in Agri-Food 4.0. By integrating new technology enablers propelled
    by the Industry 4.0 paradigm (Annosi et al., 2019), smart agriculture addresses
    important farming objectives as water saving (O’Connor and Mehta, 2016), soil
    conservation (Li et al., 2002), limit carbon emission (Ochoa et al., 2014) and
    productivity increasing (Mayer et al., 2015) by doing more with less. The new
    agricultural age aims to harmonize and share better local European policies and
    rules to scale the best farming practices and applications. Smart agriculture
    offers the opportunity to farmers, technology and service providers, governance
    agencies and other impacted stakeholders (financial organization, investors, traders,
    etc.) to share their experiences and preoccupations in the optimization in the
    farming Supply Chain with the close respect of production sustainability (Swisher
    et al., 2018; Oberholster et al., 2015). 2.6. Precision farming techniques and
    robot development The Precision Farming topic is already covered by other H2020
    calls (SFS-05-2017, SFS-06-2018-2020, SFS-08-2018-2019, etc.). The analysis of
    released projects outcomes and related research issues allows to identify new
    technologies, processes and applications in agriculture. Relevant models are proposed
    for land, grain and arable related activities (Gumma et al., 2016). Relevant listed
    results cover harvesting distribution accuracy (Roshanianfard et al., 2018; Kamata
    et al., 2018; Alzahrani, 2018), cost development (Pomar et al., 2010) and distribution
    optimization (Zhou et al., 2018; Tabatabaie et al., 2013; Ruiz-Garcia et al.,
    2010; Eisele et al., 2001). Within the Agri-Food projects is planned to reuse
    available precision farming technologies and results to improve the quality of
    targeted farmers’ processes and applications. Results in the integration of robots
    in agriculture are well mature and already proposed by Agri-Food stakeholders.
    With precision farming enablers, it will be ensured the performance of impacted
    farming processes. Agriculture Robots are already investigated in the precision
    farming topic. Recent research in this area covers the adaptability of robot design
    to the agriculture sector, the improvement of navigation conditions through additional
    sensing (Liu et al., 2018; Tao et al., 2017; Jhonattan et al., 2019) and localization
    capabilities as well as real-time image processing (Xu et al., 2017; Pilli et
    al., 2015) and camera detection (Dworak et al., 2013) to maximize the operational
    capabilities and behaviour of robots and collaborative robots (cobots). Robots
    can assist humans (Chilcanan et al., 2017; Dondeynaz et al., 2013) for difficult
    tasks or replace them for difficult ones. The cost reduction (Pomar et al., 2010)
    effectiveness is demonstrated and research in decision error reduction (Montecinos
    et al., 2018; Shin and Ko, 2017; Brigido et al., 2015) is intensive to improve
    accuracy by simulation (Xu et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018; Latorre-Biel et al.,
    2018) and by more precise path finding (Spekken et al., 2016; Nolan et al., 2017)
    and guidance algorithms (Kviz et al., 2014; Baio, 2012). The new Agri-Food projects
    fund the integration of Agriculture Robots to support the applications since the
    beginning to ensure the maximum results. Building resilient and sustainable farming
    system is the ultimate concept behind Agriculture 4.0. Recent research in this
    topic covers farming processes sustainability analysis (McGuire and Sperling,
    2013; Joly, 2005), farming activity calibration (Suryoputro et al., 2017; Hosseini
    et al., 2014; do Nascimento et al., 2012) (rotation cycles, control of accuracy),
    the development of conservation protocols (Kladivko et al., 2014; Gaspary et al.,
    2002) and the alignment of business development strategies. 3. How the new digital
    technology transforms the agri-food supply chains To achieve robust, resilient
    and sustainable agri-food supply chains is very complex because they face more
    sources of uncertainty and risks in comparison with other supply chains that give
    rise to serious questions and concerns about their economic, environmental and
    social performance. Several studies identify agricultural sources of uncertainty
    (Mundi et al., 2019; Esteso et al., 2017; Esteso et al., 2018) and how to model
    them (Grillo et al., 2019). In Esteso et al. (2018) four types of crop-based uncertainty
    are identified: Product (shelf-life, deterioration rate, lack of homogeneity,
    food quality and food safety), Process (harvesting yield, supply lead time, resource
    needs, production), Market (demand, market prices) and Environment (weather, pests
    & diseases and regulations). Poor management of these sources of uncertainty can
    have a very negative impact on safety, quality, quantity and waste of products
    as well as human, technological and natural resources. Indeed, the agri-food sector
    is one of the economic and political areas worldwide, with key implications in
    sustainability to cover not only the food needs of the population, contribute
    to their employability and economic growth, but also in the impact on the natural
    environment (Iakovou et al., 2014). Therefore, the agri-food supply chains are
    strongly pressured to manage these sources of uncertainty and risks whose precise
    evolution over time is unknown but may jeopardize the future sustainability of
    these type of supply chains. It is necessary to move away from “business as usual”
    developing new solutions and implement innovative technologies (FAO, 2018). Along
    these lines, a digitalized supply chain, allows companies to monitor material
    flows in real time making potential risks visible and develop future plans to
    face them. The main drivers for the digitalization of the processes of SC are
    usually the increase of the flexibility and the speed of reaction of the industrial/logistical
    systems (ten Hompel and Henke, 2017a, ten Hompel and Henke, 2017b) as well as
    the improvement of agri-food supply chain robustness and resilience. In this context,
    data becomes crucial. Data is the lifeblood of any business and the agricultural
    business is not an exception but rather a referent. The new technologies have
    a great impact on the reduction of uncertainty since they allow obtaining precise
    data in real time, whose treatment, together with the capacities of autonomous
    and intelligent decision making will help to increase the efficiency, sustainability,
    flexibility, agility, and the resilience along the whole supply chain from the
    farmers to the final customers. In the context of data-driven supply chains, the
    new technologies listed in the previous section, provide different and complementary
    support to the sequence of activities from data chain (Wolfert et al., 2017):
    data capture, storage, transfer, transformation, analytics and marketing. The
    support of each technology to different data chain activities lets envisage that
    the true potential of the data comes from the combination and integration of these
    technologies. Indeed, each one will improve some of the following basic functions
    of agri-food supply chains: sensing, monitoring, control, analysis (descriptive
    capabilities), prediction (predictive capabilities), decision-making (prescriptive
    capabilities) and adaptive learning. Through the sensing, monitoring, control
    and analysis it is possible to the early and accurate detection of problems and
    even predicting them before occurring, making better decisions and learn of them
    improving the sustainability and resilience of agri-food supply chains. In fact,
    the integration of previous technologies allows a more intelligent management
    of the agri-food supply chains, being able to combine multiple models of independent
    data analysis, repositories of historical data and data flows in real time. Real-time
    information and data processing tools provide new opportunities for companies
    to react more quickly to changing conditions in the supply chain. Due to this
    integrated intelligence, the agri-food supply chain management goes from supporting
    decisions to delegating them and, ultimately, to predicting which decisions should
    be taken. From all the above, there is no doubt that these new technologies are
    transforming the way agricultural sector organize and make decisions. In order
    to provide a general overview about how the new digital technology transforms
    the agri-food supply chains, the tables (Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4) integrate
    and classify the main positive impacts of the most relevant technologies as well
    as the challenges to be faced according to recent studies in the field carried
    by different authors. Table 1. IoT: Impact and Challenges. Internet of Things

    • Large energy consumption Social Challenges: • Lack of required technical skill
    • Cultural adoption: blockchain represents a complete shift to a decentralized
    network which requires the buy-in of its users and operators. Technological Challenges:
    • Blockchain integration with other technologies (BDA, IoT, CPS) • Strategize
    the transition: blockchain applications offer solutions that require significant
    changes to, or complete replacement of, existing systems. • Limited storage capacity
    and scalability • Control, security, and privacy: while solutions exist, including
    private or permissioned blockchains and strong encryption, there are still cyber
    security concerns that need to be addressed before the general public will entrust
    their personal data to a blockchain solution. • Throughput and latency issue:
    in the context of agri-food Supply Chain management, due to the original restriction
    of block size and the time interval used to generate a new block, the current
    processing capacity of blockchain cannot fulfil the requirements of processing
    millions of transactions in real-time • Infrastructure and capacity development
    challenges: it can only be applied as long as an internet connection is available,
    which can still be a challenge in some developing countries Table 3. Big Data

    agri-food risks, benchmarking) • Predictive analytics allows gain insights about
    what will be happening or likely to happen by exploring patterns in data (forecasting
    of demand, yield, price, weather, consumer behaviour) • Prescriptive analytics

    of data generation and delivery, which can be processed in batch, real-time, nearly
    real-time, or streamlines) • Veracity (data quality and level of trust) • Value
    (detecting underexploited values from big data to support decision-making) Challenges
    Organizational Challenges: • Big Data decentralization • Big Data control when
    there are multiple actors involved • Big Data trust, privacy and security among
    actors • Big Data Monetization (transfer of rights on data) Social Challenges:
    • Demonstrate value of innovations as compared its costs, to encourage companies
    and individuals to collect and exchange data • Exploring the ethical implications
    of Big Data in food and agriculture • Availability of skilled human resources
    for big data analysis Technological Challenges: Improving the capability of dealing
    with 5V’s • Volume (data exponentially increased, posing a challenge to the capacity
    of storage devices) • Variety (sustainable integrate and combine data from different
    sources: sensors, Internet of things (IoT), mobile devices, online social networks,
    in structured, semi-structured, and unstructured formats) • Velocity (real-time
    data processing) • Veracity (ensure quality and reliability) • Value (provide
    more value and insights from data) • Valence (support of connectivity in data).
    The potential of connectivity between systems is being constrained by a lack of
    common data standards or easy-to-use ontologies. • Combine the three levels of
    analytics: the performance of prescriptive analytics would heavily rely on those
    of descriptive and predictive analytics since providing the value of input parameters
    in the prescriptive model • Combining different data analytic techniques to develop
    more advanced and adaptive BDA models for DSS • Lack of decision support tools

    AI techniques enable: • Classification: to predict the categories of input data
    for e.g. weather attributes are sunny, windy, rainy etc. • Regression: to predict
    numeric value e.g. price of stocks. • Clustering: to organize similar items in-to
    groups. • Association Analysis: to find interesting relationships between sets

    a step further by not simply applying pre-programmed decisions, but instead exhibiting
    some learning capabilities • Data transformation: ML and AI can help create value
    by providing enterprises with intelligent analysis of big data and capturing structured
    interpretations of the wide variety of unstructured data increasingly available.
    Technological Impact: • Advancement of ML with machine vision will make agricultural
    technologies accurate, robust and low cost. • AI can be used to identify and clean

    of human intervention perceived as a threat Technological Challenges: • AI to
    further facilitate additional developments on visualization • AI algorithms designed
    for single-machine environments might have emergent subproblem structures useful
    for parallelization. • Adding speech interface to the system may be proved to
    be more beneficial for the farmers of the remote area • Expert systems will not
    be able to give the creative responses that human experts can give in unusual
    circumstances. • Lack of flexibility and ability to adapt to changing environments.
    • Not being able to recognize when no answer is available. • Knowledge acquisition
    remains the major bottleneck in applying expert system technology to new domains.
    • Maintenance and extension of a rule base can be difficult for a relatively large
    rule base • Enhance IoT with machine learning techniques to analyse data captured
    by sensors in real time in agriculture. As it can be seen in the above tables,
    some challenges of these digital technologies appear as strengths of others. This
    allows intuiting the suitability of using them as complements with the others.
    Indeed, in the near future, the full potential of data will rely on the combination
    of the different technologies that enhance data-driven agri-food supply chains
    more informed, efficient, secure, sustainable and resilient. For instance, IoT
    and BDA can benefit from blockchain providing data security, anonymity, trust
    and decentralization. Since blockchain exchange information in a distributed network,
    novel IoT applications will be developed for distributed environments. On the
    other side, the valuable data generated from the IoT could enrich transaction
    details that are registered on the blockchain (Tripoli and Schmidhuber, 2018).
    In turn, the accurate data provided by blockchain technology can be used as input
    for AI applications and to also record their outputs (Rabah et al., 2018). Besides,
    AI can enhance IoT by developing applications to analyse data captured by sensors
    in real time using machine learning algorithms (Reshma and Pillai, 2018). Machine
    learning and other analytic methods can also improve predictive and prescriptive
    capabilities (decision making) of Big Data Analytics. There is a broad consensus
    on the need to strengthen research and innovation in the Agri-food sector, both
    in terms of practices and technologies, through the creation of new products,
    the improvement of processes, services or processes or the integration of digital
    possibilities. Indeed, one of the persisting challenges to take advantage of the
    full potential of the data is to achieve not only the integration of these technologies
    but also their interoperability. Diversity of stakeholders integrating agri-food
    supply chains with different interests and characteristics make difficult to find
    solutions that fit all those involved, so group decision-making tools should be
    developed (Zaraté et al., 2019). Moreover, when these solutions require significant
    investments and there are stakeholders, such as small farmers with a limited budget.
    For this reason, it will be key to demonstrate the value of innovations as compared
    to their companies and to collect and exchange data. Other challenges reside on
    the needs of data standards. The standardization of the fruition data would provide
    equity for all stakeholders because of the possibility to access to the same information
    that might provide financial gain. The fruition data might provide the training
    for ensuring the availability of the required technical skills and definition
    of regulatory actions by governments. Research may be co-financed with partners
    private (e.g., companies or business groups), government (many departments and
    agencies involved) or institutional (e. g. universities). This approach accentuates
    the effect leverage government support and improve the transfer of innovations
    to businesses. It enables the training of highly qualified personnel and a new
    generation of scientists for companies and centres of research. The stability
    of funding agreements with the centres promote the retention of their qualified
    staff and facilitate partnerships with industry for the realization of structuring
    projects. Access to appropriate funding and research tax credits and development
    (R&D) is also a source of funding structuring for the industry to absorb financial
    risks generated by innovation activities (Tuhin et al., 2019). This type of financing
    is particularly important when innovation takes place directly in the company,
    which is often the case in food processing. 4. The new models of the Agri-Food
    supply chains The competitiveness of food processing companies depends on their
    investment capacity, the increase in their production, the development of new
    products and the implementation of processes to stand out from the competition
    (Guoqing et al., 2020). Over the past 30 years, we have seen a significant reduction
    in biodiversity, FAO estimates that we will have a 70 % reduction in biodiversity
    on our planet by 2050 (FAO, 2018). Human activities seem to be the main cause
    of this loss. The agriculture has many cards in hand to slow this process by implementing
    environmental protection practices and reducing the chemicals that have led to
    the destruction of many animals and insects living on land, in the air and in
    the water; creating green corridors and shelters for animals and insects; the
    cultivation of old species or species with high genetic variability, leaving the
    design of hybrid plants and monocultures that lead to significant genetic depletion;
    the reduction of arable land to make way for the replanting of forests, grasslands
    and hedges. The competitiveness is addressed to a new way of thinking the Agriculture
    that will let to optimize the process and respecting the nature. The labour shortage
    in many regions of Europe requires processing companies to automate and robotize
    their processes. In addition, investment in these new technologies allows them
    to improve their productivity and provide better working conditions necessary
    to the attraction and retention of the workforce. In addition, to meet the quality
    standards requirements of large chains and food retailers, they must use recognised
    quality management and traceability systems. Investment in digital technologies
    also promotes automation of operations, data management and access to a new range
    of management tools (Industry 4.0). The industry is particularly requested, as
    shown in the previous section, for the use of digital technologies, which allows
    it to optimize production and the supply chain while ensuring traceability of
    food from more and more pointed (Panetto et al., 2019). It is not new that, nowadays,
    agricultures supply chain practices, especially regarding to food products, are
    currently under public scrutiny. As established by Van Der Vorst (2006), this
    is because several factors, which considers food contamination issues, the new
    consumer healthy requirements, requirements for more precise information about
    the farming, marketing, and distribution practices used to bring the agricultural
    products into the shelves into supermarket, to name a few. In this same context,
    and regarding to Suprem et al. (2013), agricultural industry has been solely dependent
    on human labour with limited application of mechanical equipment and machines.
    Moreover, the applications of advanced technology such as embedded computing,
    robotics, wireless technology, GPS/GIS (Geographical Positioning System/Geographical
    Information System) and DBMS (Database Management System) software are seen to
    be recent developments, where regulations are vaguely considered. Moreover, the
    increasing gap between farmer''s expectations and the ability of the government
    led extension services has created a big business opportunity for private parties
    (Kumar and Ali, 2007). In this context, the information about the geometric properties
    of crops provided by digital based techniques, such as: ultrasound, digital photographic
    techniques, light sensors, high-resolution radar images, high-resolution X-ray
    computed tomography, stereo vision and LIDAR sensors; has innumerable applications
    in agriculture. Some important agricultural tasks that can benefit from these
    plant-geometry characterization techniques are the application of pesticides,
    irrigation, fertilization and crop training, improving the environmental and economic
    impact. But there is still a need to resolve several technological and commercial
    questions (Rosell et al., 2012). In line to this, agriculture technologies are
    focused on how traceability can be performed, in fact, the food industry had developed
    efficient traceability methods for the management of logistics and warehouses,
    based on the balance of costs and benefits of the traceability system level (Dabbene
    et al., 2013). Because of this, several authors are currently reviewing main agriculture
    supply chain technology based methods, and example of this is provided by Ahumada
    and Villalobos (2008), who identified that the use of integrated planning models
    in the agriculture supply chains is still very limited, with a high potential
    to manage perishable agri-food products, especially to deal with complex environments.
    In addition, (Ali and Kumar, 2011a) study the implication of using ICT in agriculture.
    From the authors’ findings it is highly appreciated that there is still a medium
    level of dissemination of information and knowledge sharing in agricultural developments
    (Boshkoska et al., 2019), as well as there is still a need for empirical evidences
    as to how ICT interventions are enabling the farmers to take informed decisions.
    Complementary to this, S. Araba and M. Fellows (Araba and Fellows, 2009) address
    that the majority of current research have not established a clear link between
    public access to ICTs and socioeconomic change/impacts in agriculture. In fact,
    there is a need for researchers to go beyond anecdotal evidence of downstream
    public access impacts on end‐users. Nevertheless, it is also evidenced that there
    is still limited ability on information to make definitive statements about agriculture
    expected impacts, as well as to identify and attribute specific impacts to specific
    ICT usage. Table 5 presents a summary on well-known methods and approached to
    support this, in special the agriculture supply chain decision-making methods.

    Hence, and as depicted from Table 1, as studied and established by Reardon et
    al. (2019), the food system can be thought of as “dendritic,” linking R&D, finance,
    input, and output supply chains. This means (1) the first and “core” supply chain,
    is the output Supply Chain. The second and upstream “feeder” supply chains are
    the farm input supply chains. The third and downstream ‘feeder’ supply chains
    are those supplying inputs to the post-farmgate segments. The fourth “pan-system
    feeder” supply chain is that supplying finance into every segment of every chain
    in the dendritic system. The fifth ‘feeder’ supply chain is a broad set of public
    assets apart from agricultural research institutions. The sixth set of “feeders”
    is the R&D supply chains, which supply technology and product innovations. Moreover,
    the ICT challenges in Agriculture supply chains are still open. Birkel in Birkel
    and Hartmann (2019), studied most of the recent ICT developments in this field,
    and found that most of the technological challenges in agriculture mainly includes
    security issues, lack of standards and interoperability, as well as hardware and
    software limitations are the focus of current research. Hence, the main challenges
    and risks are also in relation to the methodology, where (Ben-Daya et al., 2017)
    has revealed that the design aspect is primarily identified as a technological
    issue, while neglecting social and political challenges. Food processing companies''
    projects must benefit from financial levers that the government makes available
    to all in the manufacturing sector (Hernández et al., 2020). In order to further
    stimulate the investments, particularly in the SMEs and in innovative sectors,
    from financial tools considering the needs of the processing sector are decisive
    for the development of the implementation of development projects (Hernandez et
    al., 2020). In a business environment characterized by technological innovation,
    the consolidation of industries, deregulation and demand for consumers in constant
    evolution, the approaches of the traditional managers can no longer allow for
    companies to remain profitable. They are therefore forced to find new ways to
    stay competitive in agri-food domain, as it is also the case for all other industrial
    sectors (Boehlje, 1999; Senge, 1997; Senge et al., 2006). In the value chain management
    (VCM) domain, the informed decision making to unite resources to improve the competitiveness,
    is proving to be a powerful strategic approach that allows organizations to adapt
    to an environment of business in full motion. (Bonney et al., 2007; Collins, 2011;
    Dunne, 2008; Fearne, 2007; Fernandez et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019). The concept
    of a continuous observation results in continuous and significant improvement
    of the design and the system performance, this is only possible when the companies
    are able to establish a degree of coordination and integration with their suppliers
    and customers that do not allow them the usual relationships with the latter based
    on the transactional approach buyer-seller (Sparling, 2007). Closer strategic
    relationships with customers and suppliers allow companies to better learn and
    adapt (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990). Multiple firms that co-invent and work together
    for the same objectives using integrated processes can increase their performance
    in a much more significant way that if they had gone it alone (Bonney et al.,
    2007; Fearne, 2007). Co-innovation allows companies to improve their own practices
    as well as those of all of them, it is a process that gives companies competitive
    forces that are difficult to match by others (Bonney et al., 2007; Collins, 2011).
    Several of the cases mentioned below demonstrate the benefits sustainable and
    competitive products obtained by companies who have chosen to co-innovate with
    other members of their supply chain. 5. Conclusions, vision and perspectives For
    this scientific contribution to knowledge, more than two hundred papers support
    the analysis on scientific work on the smart agriculture technology trends, but,
    more importantly, on how they emerge as a main concept in the agriculture domain
    as Agri-Food 4.0. From this reviews and analysis, it is clearly revealed that
    integration across new technologies allows smart agriculture to address important
    farming objectives as water saving, soil conservation, limit carbon emission and
    productivity increasing by doing more with less. In fact, the new technologies
    have a positive impact and at the same time pose new challenges in the management
    of different domains of human knowledge. Hence, two main conceptual pillars impact
    and challenges, arising from the use of various technologies in the world of the
    new conception of agriculture are the fundamental aspects in Agri-Food 4.0. A
    precision is due. This paper focus principally on the factory farm model issued
    from the “western” style. In those farms, the Agri-Food 4.0 started to be applied
    and validated. The focus is more specialised on the industrial farming although
    the Agri-Food 4.0 is started to be adapted also to the organic and silvo-pasture
    paradigms. The paper pays attention particularly to four major technologies, the
    Internet of Things, the Blockchain, the Big data and the Artificial Intelligence.
    For each of those technologies is presented some type of impacts: functional,
    economic, environmental, social, related to the business and technological and
    the challenges that come with their introduction. The literature is segmented
    in relation to the functionality of the specific technology and a panoramic view
    gives the possibility to better understand the paths needed to face the new challenges.
    The future of the Agriculture domain is in the creation of a resilient and sustainable
    farming system. On the four types of crop-based uncertainty that have been identified:
    Product, Process, Market and Environment the core problem is the management. Poor
    management of these sources of uncertainty have a negative impact on safety, quality,
    quantity and waste of products as well as human, technological and natural resources.
    Today, and always more in the future, the data is the lifeblood of any business
    and the agricultural business is not an exception but rather a referent. As aforementioned
    in the discussion section, the new technologies have a great impact on the reduction
    of uncertainty since they allow obtaining precise data in real time, and real-time
    information tools provide new opportunities for companies to react more quickly
    to changing conditions in the supply chain. Our interest in the next future is
    to use formal methods to extract knowledge from the interrelation of the difference
    technologies impacts and from the existing solutions to the highlighted challenges
    to increase the efficiency, sustainability, flexibility, agility, and the resilience
    along the whole supply chain from the farmers to the final customers, and the
    analysis and outcomes from this paper, will contribute to support that from the
    main research knowledge findings. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors,
    Mario Lezoche, Jorge E. Hernández, Maria Del Mar Eva Alemany, Hervé Panetto, and
    Janusz Kacprzyk do not have any conflict with interest. Acknowledgements Authors

  analysis: The paper presents the FlowMetrixTM system, a multiplexed data acquisition
    and analysis platform for microsphere-based immunoassays and DNA sequence analysis
    that enables simultaneous analysis of up to 64 different analytes (page 1749).
    The system employs 64 distinct sets of dyed microspheres and a benchtop flow cytometer
    interfaced with a computer to perform real-time data analysis. Individual microsphere
    sets can be modified with specific molecules or elements, allowing multiple targets
    to be analyzed simultaneously. The system has been used in immunoassays for serum

    1997 PDF Split View Cite Permissions Share Abstract The FlowMetrixTM System is
    a multiplexed data acquisition and analysis platform for flow cytometric analysis
    of microsphere-based assays that performs simultaneous measurement of up to 64
    different analytes. The system consists of 64 distinct sets of fluorescent microspheres
    and a standard benchtop flow cytometer interfaced with a personal computer containing
    a digital signal processing board and Windows95®-based software. Individual sets
    of microspheres can be modified with reactive components such as antigens, antibodies,
    or oligonucleotides, and then mixed to form a multiplexed assay set. The digital
    signal-processing hardware and Windows95-based software provide complete control
    of the flow cytometer and perform real-time data processing, allowing multiple
    independent reactions to be analyzed simultaneously. The system has been used
    to perform qualitative and quantitative immunoassays for multiple serum proteins
    in both capture and competitive inhibition assay formats. The system has also
    been used to perform DNA sequence analysis by multiplexed competitive hybridization
    with 16 different sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes. Issue Section: Oak
    Ridge Conference The first use of flow cytometry for analysis of microsphere-based
    immunoassays was published in 1977 (1), and recently reviewed by McHugh (2). Because
    a flow cytometer has the ability to discriminate different particles on the basis
    of size or color, the possibility of multiplexed analysis with different microsphere
    populations is suggested. Multiplexed analysis is the ability to perform multiple
    discrete assays in a single tube with the same sample at the same time. The use
    of different-sized microspheres for simultaneous analysis of different analytes
    was originally proposed by Horan et al. (3). Two distinct sizes of microspheres
    were used for simultaneous detection of two different antibodies by flow cytometry,
    and subsequently expanded to the use of four different sizes of microspheres to
    detect four different specificities of anti-HIV antibodies (4)(5). Size discrimination
    of microspheres allows simultaneous detection of small numbers of analytes, but
    the inability to distinguish aggregates of smaller microspheres from larger microspheres
    severely limits the extent of multiplexing that can be achieved. In contrast,
    differential dyeing of identically sized microspheres with two different dyes,
    emitting in two different wavelengths, allows aggregates to be distinguished and
    permits discrimination of at least 64 different sets of microspheres. The FlowMetrixTM
    system (Luminex Corp.) performs multiplexed analysis of up to 64 different reactions
    simultaneously by using a flow cytometer and digital signal processor to perform
    real-time analysis of multiple microsphere-based assays. The three major components
    of the system are a benchtop flow cytometer, microspheres, and computer hardware
    and software. The flow cytometer analyzes individual microspheres by size and
    fluorescence, distinguishing three fluorescent colors—green (530 nm), orange (585
    nm), and red (>650 nm)—simultaneously. Microsphere size, determined by 90-degree
    light scatter, is used to eliminate microsphere aggregates from the analysis.
    Orange and red fluorescence are used for microsphere classification, and green
    fluorescence is used for analyte measurement. The FlowMetrix system is currently
    configured for the Becton Dickinson FACScan®, a multiparameter flow cytometer
    that is based on a single 488-nm excitation laser (Becton-Dickinson Immunocytometry
    Systems). Microspheres serve as the vehicles for molecular reactions. The microspheres
    are 5.5-μm polystyrene microspheres that bear carboxylate functional groups on
    the surface. The microspheres are available in 64 distinct sets that are classified
    by the flow cytometer by virtue of the unique orange/red emission profile of each
    set as shown in Fig. 1 . The microspheres can be covalently coupled to virtually
    any amine-containing “target” molecule through surface carboxylate groups; alternatively,
    avidin-coupled microspheres can be used for binding biotinylated molecules. Microspheres
    of this size provide sufficient surface area for covalent coupling of 1–2 × 106
    target molecules per microsphere. In addition, the small size allows the microspheres
    to remain in suspension for several hours, which is more than sufficient for assay
    setup and analysis, and also provides near-fluid-phase reaction kinetics. FlowMetrix
    hardware and software provide complete control of the flow cytometer and perform
    real-time classification of the microspheres and analysis of the microsphere-based
    reactions simultaneously. The hardware is a personal computer interface card that
    provides communication between the computer and the FACScan. The interface card
    has an on-board, high-speed digital signal processor that is capable of performing
    >30 million mathematical functions per second. The interface card connects to
    the computer interface of the FACScan through a switch, allowing alternate use
    of the FlowMetrix system or the standard computer system. The software is a Windows95®-based
    32-bit application that provides a “multiplexed mode” for automated multiplexed
    analysis, as well as a “data acquisition mode” for nonautomated gating and data
    acquisition. Both modes automatically record captured data to flow cytometry standard,
    FCS 2.0, data files for use with third-party data analysis tools. In addition,
    statistical analysis generated by the software is recorded to comma-separated-value
    files that can be read by third-party spreadsheet programs. Fluorescent antibodies,
    antigens, or nucleic acid probes provide specific signals for each reaction in
    a multiplexed assay. Because each fluorescent reactant binds specifically to a
    target that is present on only one bead set in a multiplexed assay, the soluble
    reactants do not need to be differentially labeled. All fluorescent molecules
    are labeled with a green-emitting fluorophore such as Bodipy® (Molecular Probes)
    or fluorescein isothiocyanate. Any green-emitting fluorochrome can be use as a
    reporter; however, each fluorochrome has a characteristic emission spectrum, requiring
    a unique compensation setting for spillover into the orange fluorescence channel.
    To prepare a multiplexed assay, individual sets of microspheres are conjugated
    with the target molecules required for each reaction. Target molecules may be
    antigens, antibodies, oligonucleotides, receptors, peptides, enzyme substrates,
    etc. A fluorescent reactant is prepared for each target molecule. Fluorescent
    reactants may be oligonucleotides, antigens, antibodies, receptors, etc., i.e.,
    any molecule that will bind to the target molecule. After optimizing the parameters
    of each assay separately in a nonmultiplexed format, the assays can be multiplexed
    by simply mixing the different sets of microspheres. The fluorescent reactants
    also are mixed to form a cocktail for the multiplexed reactions. The microspheres
    are then reacted with a mixture of analytes, such as a serum sample, followed
    by the cocktail of fluorescent reactants. After a short incubation period, the
    mixture of microspheres, now containing various amounts of green fluorescence
    on their surfaces, are analyzed with the flow cytometer. Data acquisition, analysis,
    and reporting are performed in real time on all microsphere sets included in the
    multiplex. As each microsphere is analyzed by the flow cytometer, the microsphere
    is classified into its distinct set on the basis of orange and red fluorescence,
    and the green fluorescence value is recorded. One hundred individual microspheres
    of each set are analyzed and the mean value of the green fluorescence is reported.
    In the present report, an immunoassay for allergen-specific IgE and IgG testing,
    and DNA hybridization with sequence-specific oligonucleotides for genetic testing
    are presented. Both assay systems take advantage of the multiplexing capabilities
    of the system by performing 16 simultaneous analyses in the same reaction. Materials
    and Methods Microspheres. Carboxylate-modified polystyrene microspheres (5.5 μm
    diameter) were dyed with various amounts of orange-emitting and red-emitting fluorochromes
    (Luminex Corp.). Eight different concentrations of each of the two fluorochromes
    were mixed in all 64 possible combinations and the mixtures were used to prepare
    64 microsphere sets with unique orange-red emission profiles (Fig. 1 ). Thus,
    the flow cytometer measures both the color, or emission wavelength, and the intensity
    of each dye. The first 16 microsphere sets produced were used in this study. Reagents.
    Grass allergen extracts, canine sera, and affinity-purified goat anti-canine IgE
    were kindly provided by Bill Mandy, BioMedical Services. Rabbit anti-goat IgG–fluorescein
    isothiocyanate (FITC), goat anti-canine IgG-FITC, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic
    acid (MES), and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were purchased from Sigma Chemical
    Co.1 1-Ethyl-3-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide
    (sulfo-NHS) were purchased from Pierce Chemicals. Synthetic oligonucleotides.
    Sixteen oligonucleotides corresponding to allelic sequences within the second
    exon of the HLA-DQA1 gene and their corresponding complementary sequences were
    synthesized with standard automated synthesis techniques (Oligos, Etc.). The oligonucleotides
    were modified at the 5′ end during synthesis with an amino-linker. The amino-linker
    consists of an amino group attached to a chain of six carbon–carbon linkages.
    Before the addition of the amino-linker, a chain comprising nine carbon–carbon
    and aliphatic ether linkages was introduced as a spacer. Double-stranded (ds)
    oligonucleotides used as competitors in hybridization experiments were prepared
    by annealing equal amounts of unlabeled complementary oligonucleotides. Allergen-coated
    microsphere preparation. Sixteen different grass allergens were conjugated to
    16 different microsphere sets through their surface carboxylate groups with a
    carbodiimide coupling method. Twenty microliters of 4 g/L microspheres (∼8 × 106
    microspheres) were activated in 100 μL of 50 mmol/L sodium phosphate buffer, pH
    7.0, containing 500 μg of EDC and 500 μg of sulfo-NHS. Microspheres were washed
    twice with 100 μL of PBS, pH 7.4, with centrifugation at 13 400g for 30 s to harvest
    the microspheres. Activated, washed microspheres were suspended in 50 μL of diluted
    allergen extract (1:100 in PBS, pH 7.4). After 2 h, allergen-coated microspheres
    were washed twice with 100 μL of 0.2 mL/L Tween 20, 1 g/L BSA in PBS pH 7.4 (PBSTB),
    suspended in 1 mL of PBSTB, and counted on a hemocytometer. The concentration
    of microspheres was adjusted with PBSTB to 3 × 109/L and the suspensions stored
    at 2–8 °C. Multiplexed assay for grass allergen-specific IgE. Equivalent amounts
    of each of the 16 grass allergen-loaded microspheres were mixed. Twenty microliters
    of the mixture (∼60 000 microspheres total) were mixed with 60 μL of a 1:3 dilution
    of canine serum in PBSTB, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min. Microspheres
    were washed in 200 μL of PBSTB and suspended in 40 μL of a 50 mg/L solution of
    goat anti-canine IgE. After incubation for 30 min, beads were washed in 200 μL
    of PBSTB and treated with 40 μL of rabbit anti-goat IgG–FITC at 20 mg/L in PBSTB.
    After 30 min, the assay was diluted to 300 μL with PBSTB and assayed with the
    FlowMetrix system. Negative controls included the microspheres with canine serum,
    without the goat anti-canine IgE and with the rabbit anti-goat IgG–FITC. Allergen-specific
    canine IgE was determined by subtracting the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI)
    of the green channel for the negative controls for each grass allergen from the
    MFI for the tubes including the goat anti-canine IgE. Multiplexed assay for grass
    allergen-specific IgG. Twenty microliters (60 000 microspheres) of the microsphere
    mixture were reacted with 20 μL of a 1:10 dilution of canine serum in PBSTB, and
    the mixture was incubated for 30 min. Microspheres were washed in 200 μL of PBSTB
    and suspended in 25 μL of a 50 mg/L solution of goat anti-canine IgG–FITC. After
    30 min, the mixture was diluted to 300 μL in PBSTB and assayed with the FlowMetrix
    system. Negative controls included the microspheres with no canine serum and with
    the goat anti-canine IgG–FITC. Allergen-specific canine IgG was determined by
    subtracting the MFI for the negative control for each grass allergen from the
    MFI for the tubes including canine serum. Coupling of oligonucleotides to microspheres.
    HLA-DQA1 allele-specific oligonucleotides corresponding to the noncoding strand
    [denoted by (−)] were covalently coupled to unique sets of carboxylate-modified
    polystyrene microspheres by using water-soluble carbodiimide (EDC). Briefly, 100
    μL of a 0.001 mol/L solution of oligonucleotide in 0.1 mol/L MES buffer (pH 4.5)
    was added to 1.0 mL of microspheres (1% solids) in 0.1 mol/L MES buffer (pH 4.5).
    Fifty microliters of a 10 g/L solution of EDC were added to this mixture, and
    the solution was mixed vigorously. After incubation at room temperature for 30
    min, the same amount of EDC was added again and the solution was mixed. Incubation
    at room temperature was continued for another 30 min and then the microspheres
    were pelleted by centrifugation at 11 750g for 4 min. Microspheres were washed
    one time in PBS containing 0.2 mL/L Tween 20, and two times in PBS containing
    1 g/L sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) by resuspending the microsphere pellet in the
    solution and then pelleting the microspheres by centrifugation as described. The
    final microsphere pellet was resuspended in 400 μL of 0.1 mol/L MES buffer (pH
    4.5) and stored at 4°C. Fluorescent labeling of oligonucleotides. HLA-DQA1 allele-specific
    oligonucleotides corresponding to the coding strand [denoted by (+)] were fluorescently
    labeled with Bodipy FL-X {6-[(4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-propionyl)amino]hexanoic
    acid, succinimidyl ester} (Molecular Probes). Briefly, a 400-μL solution containing
    0.000002 mol/L oligonucleotide in 0.1 mol/L sodium bicarbonate and 50 g/L dimethyl
    sulfoxide (DMSO) (pH 8.2) was mixed with 30 μL of Bodipy FL-X (10 g/L in DMSO)
    at room temperature for 16–18 h. The mixture was desalted on a PD-10 column (Pharmacia
    Biotech) equilibrated in TE (0.010 mol/L Tris-HCl + 0.001 mol/L EDTA, pH 8.0)
    to remove unreacted dye, and stored at 4 °C. Competitive hybridization assay.
    Forty femtomoles of each fluorescent oligonucleotide and 24 μg of fragmented salmon
    sperm carrier DNA were mixed with 500 fmol of ds oligonucleotide in a total volume
    of 26.7 μL of reaction buffer (0.050 mol/L KCl, 0.020 mol/L Tris-HCl pH 8.4, and
    0.003 mol/L MgCl2), and the mixture was heated to 100 °C for 10 min. Twenty-five
    microliters of 55 °C-equilibrated 2× hybridization buffer (1× hybridization buffer
    consists of 2.25 mol/L tetramethylammonium chloride, 1.13 g/L SDS, 0.00225 mol/L
    EDTA, and 0.056 mol/L Tris-HCl pH 8.0) were then mixed with the solution, and
    the mixture was incubated at 55 °C for 15–30 min. After this incubation, 2.5 μL
    of the microsphere mixture, containing 8000 microspheres of each of the 16 sets
    (128 000 microspheres total) in 2× hybridization buffer, were added to the mixture
    and the solution was vortex-mixed. The hybridization mixtures were incubated for
    an additional 15 min at 55 °C. Without washing, samples were diluted to 250 μL
    with 55 °C-equilibrated hybridization buffer. Dilutions were performed immediately
    before analysis. Simultaneously, competitive hybridizations in the absence of
    competitor were performed to determine maximal hybridized oligonucleotide values.
    Flow cytometric analysis. Assays were performed in a volume of 50 to 100 μL; however,
    before analysis each reaction was diluted to ∼300 μL to provide sufficient sample
    volume for the flow cytometer. Immediately after dilution, samples were analyzed
    on a FACScan benchtop flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson) with FlowMetrix hardware
    and software for operational control of the flow cytometer and for data acquisition
    and analysis (Luminex Corp.). At least 100 microspheres were analyzed for each
    microsphere set. Analysis times averaged ∼20 s. The software allows rapid classification
    of microsphere sets on the basis of the simultaneous gating on orange and red
    fluorescence. Separate histograms of logarithmic green fluorescence intensity
    representing each microsphere set were acquired. The MFI of a logarithmic green
    fluorescence histogram was taken as a measure of the fluorescence associated with
    the corresponding microsphere set and defined as the value of hybridized oligonucleotide.
    Percent inhibition of hybridization on a microsphere set was determined with the
    formula: %  Inhibition  = MFI  in  the  absence  of  competitor  −  MFI  in  the  presence  of  competitor
    MFI  in  the  absence  of  competitor × 100 Results and Discussion To establish
    the utility of the FlowMetrix system for multiplexed analysis, assays have been
    developed representing both immunoassays for analysis of serum proteins and DNA
    hybridization-based assays for genetic analysis. Immunoassays. An area of clinical
    immunology that is suited particularly well to panel-based analysis is determination
    of the serum concentrations of allergen-specific IgE antibodies. In many instances,
    allergic individuals are tested for serum IgE and IgG concentrations specific
    for a related series of allergens, such as grasses, trees, or bee venoms; in other
    cases, panels of geographically related allergens are examined. Fig. 2 depicts
    the results of a multiplexed assay for canine IgE and IgG antibodies specific
    for 16 different grass allergens. The entire analysis of each serum sample was
    performed in two tubes, one for IgE and one for IgG. Each reaction contained 16
    different microsphere sets, each set coated with a different allergen. After incubation
    with serum samples and fluorescent antibodies, the reactions were analyzed with
    the FlowMetrix system. Removal of excess fluorescent antibodies is not required
    because of the extremely small sensing volume of the flow cytometer. The analysis
    time on the flow cytometer is ∼15 s for each sample, and the results are reported,
    instantaneously, in a spreadsheet format. The green fluorescent signal for each
    microsphere set, reported as MFI, is proportional to the amount of bound antibodies;
    thus, appropriate calibrators can be used to perform quantitative assays. The
    data shown in Fig. 2 represent the measurement of allergen-specific antibodies
    in canine sera; similar principles would apply to measurement of human antibodies.
    Serum A96326 demonstrated low IgE reactivity to most of the grass allergens as
    compared with serum A96323. In contrast, serum A96326 contained high concentrations
    of allergen-specific IgG, compared with allergen-specific IgG in serum A96323
    for several of the grass allergens. Perhaps the most important point to be gleaned
    from these data is that 64 individual measurements were performed, analyzed, and
    reported from only four reaction tubes. Genetic analysis. A widely used method
    for ascertaining the presence of particular sequences in target nucleic acids
    is hybridization with short, synthetic oligonucleotide probes of known sequence
    (6). Short oligonucleotides of eight to 20 bp are used because they display a
    high degree of hybridization specificity (7)(8)(9). Molecular hybridization with
    short oligonucleotides has been applied to numerous problems in research and medicine
    that require DNA sequence analysis. These include detection of mutations for diagnosis
    of genetic and malignant diseases (6)(10)(11) and for classification of HLA alleles
    for tissue typing (12). The experiments described here involved a series of 16
    oligonucleotide probes representing allelic sequences of the human HLA-DQA1 gene
    (Fig. 3 ). Hybridization properties of microsphere-attached oligonucleotides.
    Parallel hybridization assays necessitate that a single reaction condition is
    used for hybridization of the oligonucleotide probes to the target nucleic acid.
    Hybridization solutions containing tetramethylammonium chloride are useful for
    this purpose since tetramethylammonium chloride minimizes the effects of base
    composition on duplex association and disassociation rates (13)(14). The stringency
    of hybridization is then controlled strictly as a function of the length of contiguous
    complementarity. All hybridization experiments reported here were performed in
    the presence of 2.25 mol/L tetramethylammonium chloride. Before attempting to
    multiplex the 16 oligonucleotide-substituted microspheres, the basic parameters
    of microsphere-attached oligonucleotide hybridization were examined with a single
    microsphere–oligonucleotide. A constant number (8000) of one oligonucleotide-coated
    microsphere set, 3403−, was hybridized to increasing quantities of complementary
    (3403+) or unrelated (5501+) fluorescent oligonucleotide at 55 °C for 15 min,
    and the green fluorescence associated with the microspheres was measured with
    the FlowMetrix system (Fig. 4 A). Microsphere-bound fluorescence increased in
    a linear manner up to 40 fmol of input complementary fluorescent probe. Identical
    quantities of input noncomplementary fluorescent oligonucleotide showed little
    or no hybridization. Each of the 16 DQA1 oligonucleotide pairs showed similar
    hybridization properties (data not shown), and all future experiments were performed
    with 8000 of each microsphere and 40 fmol of each fluorescent oligonucleotide.
    The kinetics of hybridization of microsphere-bound DQA3403− oligonucleotide to
    complementary (DQA3403+) and unrelated (DQA5501+) fluorescent oligonucleotides
    is shown in Fig. 4B . Hybridization of the microsphere-bound DQA3403− oligonucleotide
    with its complementary probe is rapid, requiring no more than 15 min to reach
    completion. During this time period, there is little or no hybridization of the
    unrelated fluorescent probe. Therefore, a period of 15 min was used routinely
    for hybridization of the microsphere-attached oligonucleotides to the fluorescent
    oligonucleotide probes To confirm that hybridization at 55 °C in 2.25 mol/L tetramethylammonium
    chloride allowed discrimination between complementary and closely related 18-bp
    sequences, hybridization reactions were performed at various temperatures with
    fluorescent probes representing complementary, single, and double mutants, and
    unrelated sequences. The DQA3403− microsphere set was selected for analysis because
    the DQA3403 sequence differs from DQA3402 by only a single base and this mismatch
    is positioned such that the oligonucleotides have 13 contiguous identical bp,
    the longest stretch of identity between any of the 16 oligonucleotides in the
    HLA-DQA1 panel. As shown in Fig. 4C , hybridization temperatures <55 °C did not
    allow discrimination of the point mutant DQA3402 oligonucleotide from the complementary
    sequence. At 55 °C, the point mutant hybridized with ∼50% lower efficiency than
    the complementary sequence, and the double mutant and unrelated oligonucleotides
    did not hybridize. No hybridization of any oligonucleotides occurred at 65 °C.
    Thus, hybridization at 55 °C in 2.25 mol/L tetramethylammonium chloride should
    allow detection and discrimination of perfectly complementary oligonucleotide
    duplexes from mismatched ones. DNA sequence analysis by competitive hybridization.
    The purpose of these experiments was to establish a general system for multiplexed
    hybridization analysis of DNA sequences that uses unlabeled, ds target DNA, such
    as a standard PCR product, as the test material. The assay system contains 16
    different microspheres coupled to the 16 different DQA1 oligonucleotide target
    probes, and the 16 complementary fluorescent DQA1 probes (Fig. 3 ). In the presence
    of a complementary competitor sequence, hybridization between the complementary
    fluorescent probe and its complementary microsphere target will be reduced. To
    test the specificity of this system for DNA sequence analysis by competitive hybridization
    with unlabeled DNA targets, unlabeled oligonucleotides were used as model competitors.
    Preliminary experiments demonstrated that 500 fmol of ds oligonucleotide resulted
    in maximal inhibition of fluorescent probe hybridization and that the hybridization
    was complete within 15 min (data not shown). Each unlabeled ds HLA-DQA1 oligonucleotide
    was denatured and hybridized to the mixture of the 16 HLA-DQA1 fluorescent oligonucleotides.
    Then, the mixture was hybridized to the mixture of 16 HLA-DQA1 microspheres. Competition
    of oligonucleotide duplex formation on microsphere sets with the HLA-DQA1 oligonucleotide
    competitors was very effective and specific (Table 1 ). Denatured ds HLA-DQA1
    oligonucleotides inhibited hybridization on complementary microsphere sets 62–93%,
    and inhibited highly homologous or unrelated microsphere sets <21%. Thus, the
    HLA-DQA1 competitive hybridization test performed accurately with denatured ds
    oligonucleotide competitors. This multiplexed hybridization assay has been used
    to perform HLA-DQA1 tissue typing of PCR-amplified human genomic DNA (P. Smith
    et al., submitted for publication). The assay types DQA1 alleles in both homozygous
    and heterozygous samples, and the entire analysis is accomplished in 30 min after
    PCR amplification. These studies have demonstrated the ability of the FlowMetrix
    system to perform highly multiplexed assays for analysis of specific protein–protein
    interactions, such as immunoassays, and for analysis of specific DNA sequences.
    The system provides several advantages for analysis of biologically and medically
    relevant molecules, including speed, economy, and advanced analytical capabilities.
    The system reduces assay time by performing multiple analyses simultaneously rather
    than sequentially. The no-wash format of many microsphere-based assays, particularly
    in the final detection step, is considerably faster than microtiter-based assays
    that require multiple washing steps to remove excess reagents. In addition, the
    rapid kinetics of microsphere-based assays allow shorter incubation times than
    conventional solid-phase assays. The reduced assay time also reduces labor costs
    for performing multiple analyses. Reagent usage for microsphere-based assays is
    10- to 1000-fold less than microtiter-based assays. Multiplexing allows unique
    analysis of molecular interactions that can only be performed in a multiplexed
    format. For example, direct comparison of receptor binding avidity for related
    ligands could be performed under truly competitive conditions where the receptor
    and all ligand variants are present in the same reaction at the same time. Most,
    if not all, assays for biomolecules can be adapted to the FlowMetrix system. Immunoassays
    have been developed with all assay formats available with microtiter-based technology,
    including direct binding assays, immunometric or capture/sandwich assays, and
    competitive inhibition assays. In addition, receptor/ligand analysis and epitope
    mapping are well suited for the multiplexed format. Multiplexed hybridization
    of nucleic acids can be used for tissue typing, diagnosis of genetic disease,
    paternity/forensic testing, tests for oncogenes, tests for foreign pathogens,
    and tests for mRNA/cDNA expression. Because of the real-time analysis, no-wash
    format, and solution-phase kinetics of microsphere-based assays, multiplexed enzyme
    assays also can be performed to analyze both substrate specificity and kinetic
    data for multiple enzymes or multiple substrates simultaneously. For example,
    multiple microsphere sets could be prepared, each bearing a different fluorescent
    peptide sequence. These microsphere sets could then be mixed and used to examine
    the specificity or relative activity of an endopeptidase for the different substrate
    sequences. In this case, enzymatic activity would be measured as the loss of fluorescence
    from the microspheres. The FlowMetrix system represents a revolutionary new technology
    that can be applied to virtually any application that requires analysis of molecular
    interactions, including basic research, clinical diagnostic testing, high-throughput
    drug screening, environmental testing, and agricultural testing. This system is
    unique in its ability to provide multiplexed, high-throughput analysis coupled

    \ of renewable energy and optimization of energy use are key enablers of\nsustainable\
    \ energy transitions and mitigating climate change. Modern technologies such the\
    \ Internet\nof Things (IoT) offer a wide number of applications in the energy\
    \ sector, i.e, in energy supply,\ntransmission and distribution, and demand. IoT\
    \ can be employed for improving energy efﬁciency,\nincreasing the share of renewable\
    \ energy, and reducing environmental impacts of the energy use.\nThis paper reviews\
    \ the existing literature on the application of IoT in in energy systems, in general,\n\
    and in the context of smart grids particularly. Furthermore, we discuss enabling\
    \ technologies of\nIoT, including cloud computing and different platforms for\
    \ data analysis. Furthermore, we review\nchallenges of deploying IoT in the energy\
    \ sector, including privacy and security, with some solutions\nto these challenges\
    \ such as blockchain technology. This survey provides energy policy-makers, energy\n\
    economists, and managers with an overview of the role of IoT in optimization of\
    \ energy systems.\nKeywords: internet of things; IoT applications; energy efﬁciency;\
    \ energy in buildings; smart energy\nsystems; smart grid; ﬂexible demand; energy\
    \ storage\n1. Introduction\n1.1. Concepts\nIndustrial revolutions can be divided\
    \ into four phases. In the ﬁrst revolution, new sources\nof energy were discovered\
    \ to run the machines. The mass extraction of coal and the invention of\nsteam\
    \ power plants were signiﬁcant development stages in this phase [1]. The second\
    \ revolution\nknown as mass production and electricity generation was a period\
    \ of rapid development in industry,\ndistinguished by large-scale iron and steel\
    \ production. During this phase, many large-scale factories\nwith their assembly\
    \ lines were established and formed new businesses [2]. The third revolution\n\
    introduced computer and the ﬁrst generation of communication technologies, e.g.,\
    \ telephony system,\nwhich enabled automation in supply chains [3].\nA wide variety\
    \ of modern technologies such as communication systems (e.g., 5G), intelligent\n\
    robots, and the Internet of Things (IoT) are expected to empower the fourth industrial\
    \ revolution [4–6].\nIoT interconnects a number of devices, people, data, and\
    \ processes, by allowing them to communicate\nwith each other seamlessly. Hence,\
    \ IoT can help improving different processes to be more quantiﬁable\nand measurable\
    \ by collecting and processing large amount of data [7]. IoT can potentially enhance\n\
    the quality of life in different areas including medical services, smart cities,\
    \ construction industry,\nagriculture, water management, and the energy sector\
    \ [8]. This is enabled by providing an increased\nautomated decision making in\
    \ real-time and facilitating tools for optimizing such decisions.\nEnergies 2020,\
    \ 13, 494; doi:10.3390/en13020494\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/energies\nEnergies 2020,\
    \ 13, 494\n2 of 27\n1.2. Motivation\nThe global energy demand rose by 2.3% in\
    \ 2018 compared to 2017, which is the highest increase\nsince 2010 [9]. As a result,\
    \ CO2 emissions from the energy sector hit a new record in 2018. Compared\nto\
    \ the pre-industrial temperature level, global warming is approaching 1.5 ◦C,\
    \ most likely before the\nmiddle of the 21 Century [10]. If this trend prevails,\
    \ the global warming will exceed the 2 ◦C target,\nwhich will have a severe impact\
    \ on the planet and human life. The environmental concerns, such\nas global warming\
    \ and local air pollution, scarcity of water resources for thermal power generation,\n\
    and the limitation of depleting fossil energy resources, raise an urgent need\
    \ for more efﬁcient use of\nenergy and the use of renewable energy sources (RESs).\
    \ Different studies have shown that a non-fossil\nenergy system is almost impossible\
    \ without efﬁcient use of energy and/or reduction of energy demand,\nand a high\
    \ level integration of RESs, both at a country level [11], regional [12], or globally\
    \ [13].\nBased on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals agenda [14],\
    \ energy efﬁciency is one\nof the key drivers of sustainable development. Moreover,\
    \ energy efﬁciency offers economic beneﬁts in\nlong-term by reducing the cost\
    \ of fuel imports/supply, energy generation, and reducing emissions\nfrom the\
    \ energy sector. For enhancing energy efﬁciency and a more optimal energy management,\n\
    an effective analysis of the real-time data in the energy supply chain plays a\
    \ key role [15]. The energy\nsupply chain, from resource extraction to delivering\
    \ it in a useful form to the end users, includes\nthree major parts: (i) energy\
    \ supply including upstream reﬁnery processes; (ii) energy transformation\nprocesses\
    \ including transmission and distribution (T&D) of energy carriers; and (iii)\
    \ energy demand\nside, which includes the use of energy in buildings, transportation\
    \ sector, and the industry [16].\nFigure 1 shows these three parts with their\
    \ relevant components. Under the scope of this paper, we\ndiscuss the role of\
    \ IoT in all different segments of the energy supply chain. Our aim is to show\
    \ the\npotential contribution of IoT to efﬁcient use of energy, reduction of energy\
    \ demand, and increasing the\nshare of RESs.\nFigure 1. Energy supply chain.\n\
    IoT employs sensors and communication technologies for sensing and transmitting\
    \ real-time data,\nwhich enables fast computations and optimal decision-making\
    \ [17]. Moreover, IoT can help the energy\nsector to transform from a centralized\
    \ to a distributed, smart, and integrated energy system. This is\na key requirement\
    \ in deploying local, distributed RESs, such as wind and solar energy [18], as\
    \ well\nEnergies 2020, 13, 494\n3 of 27\nas turning many small-scale end users\
    \ of energy into prosumers by aggregating their generation and\noptimizing their\
    \ demand whenever useful for the grid. IoT-based systems automate, integrate,\
    \ and\ncontrol processes through sensors and communication technologies. Large\
    \ data collection and use of\nintelligent algorithms for real-time data analysis\
    \ can help to monitor energy consumption patterns of\ndifferent users and devices\
    \ in different time scales and control that consumption more efﬁciently [19].\n\
    1.3. Methodology\nThe application of IoT in different sectors and industries has\
    \ been widely discussed and reviewed\nin the literature (for example [20–22].\
    \ Moreover, challenges and opportunities with respect to the\ndeployment of one\
    \ or a group of IoT technologies have received a high level of technical assessment,\n\
    e.g., sensors [23] or 5G network [24]. With respect to the energy sector, most\
    \ of survey studies have\nfocused on one speciﬁc subsector, e.g., buildings or\
    \ the technical potential of a certain IoT technology\nin the energy sector. For\
    \ example, Stojkoska et al. [25] reviews smart home applications of IoT and the\n\
    prospect of integrating those applications into an IoT enabled environment. In\
    \ a study by Hui et al. [26],\nthe methods, recent advances, and implementation\
    \ of 5G are studied only with focusing on the energy\ndemand side. The role of\
    \ IoT in improving energy efﬁciency in buildings and public transport has\nbeen\
    \ discussed in [27,28], respectively. Khatua et al. [29] reviews the key challenges\
    \ in the suitability\nof IoT data transfer and communication protocols for deployment\
    \ in smart grids.\nHowever, unlike the reviewed literature where the focus is\
    \ commonly either on a speciﬁc subsector\nin the energy sector or certain IoT\
    \ technologies, this paper reviews the application of IoT in the energy\nsector,\
    \ from energy generation to transmission and distribution (T&D) and demand side.\
    \ As such,\nthe main contribution of this paper is to extend the existing body\
    \ of literature by providing energy\npolicy-makers, economists, energy experts,\
    \ and managers with a general overview of the opportunities\nand challenges of\
    \ applying IoT in different parts of the entire energy sector. In this respect,\
    \ we brieﬂy\nintroduce the IoT framework and its enabling technologies to form\
    \ a basis for discussing their role in\nthe energy sector.\nTo conduct this survey,\
    \ a systematic search was carried out to collect and review the recent\nbody of\
    \ literature on the role of IoT in the energy sector. First, we searched the terms\
    \ “Internet of\nThings” and “Energy”, case non-speciﬁc, in the title, abstract,\
    \ and keywords of publications stored\nin SCOPUS, IEEE, Hindawi, and Google Scholar\
    \ databases. Then, we limited the scope of search\nresults to engineering, economics\
    \ and management branches where possible. Next, papers published\nbefore 2012\
    \ and most of conference papers with no information on the peer-review process\
    \ were\nexcluded. Finally, we clustered the relevant papers in sub-categories\
    \ of energy generation (including\npower plants, ancillary services, and centralized\
    \ renewable energy), T&D systems (including electricity,\ngas and district heating\
    \ networks, and smart grids), and the demand side (including energy use in\nbuildings,\
    \ transportation, and the industry sector). We focus on the IoT applications that\
    \ can be\ngenerally applicable to most of energy systems without discussing speciﬁc\
    \ cases and their boundary\nconditions. For example, we discuss the role of IoT\
    \ in smart buildings, without falling into the details\nof building typology,\
    \ building material, occupants’ energy consumption pattern, type and number of\n\
    home appliances, etc.\nThe rest of this paper is structured as follows. Sections\
    \ 2 and 3 introduces IoT and enabling\ntechnologies, including sensors and communication\
    \ technologies, cloud computing, and data analytic\nplatforms. Section 4 reviews\
    \ the role of IoT in the energy sector. Section 5 discusses the opportunities\n\
    and challenges of deploying IoT, while Section 6 portrays future trends.\nThe\
    \ paper concludes\nin Section 7.\n2. Internet of Things (IoT)\nIoT is an emerging\
    \ technology that uses the Internet and aims to provide connectivity between\n\
    physical devices or “things” [30]. Examples of physical devices include home appliances\
    \ and industrial\nequipment. Using appropriate sensors and communication networks,\
    \ these devices can provide\nEnergies 2020, 13, 494\n4 of 27\nvaluable data and\
    \ enable offering diverse services for people. For instance, controlling energy\n\
    consumption of buildings in an smart fashion enables reducing the energy costs\
    \ [31]. IoT has a wide\nrange of applications, such as in manufacturing, logistics\
    \ and construction industry [32]. IoT is also\nwidely applied in environmental\
    \ monitoring, healthcare systems and services, efﬁcient management\nof energy\
    \ in buildings, and drone-based services [33–36].\nWhen planning an IoT application\
    \ which is the ﬁrst step in designing IoT systems, the selection\nof components\
    \ of IoT such as sensor device, communication protocol, data storage and computation\n\
    needs to be appropriate for the intended application. For example, an IoT platform\
    \ planned to control\nheating, cooling, and air conditioning (HVAC) in a building,\
    \ requires utilizing relevant environmental\nsensors and using suitable communication\
    \ technology [37]. Figure 2 shows the different components\nof an IoT platform\
    \ [38]. IoT devices which are the second components of the IoT platforms, could\
    \ be\nin the form of sensors, actuators, IoT gateways or any device that joins\
    \ the cycle of data collection,\ntransmission, and processing. For example, an\
    \ IoT gateway device enables routing the data into\nthe IoT system and establishing\
    \ bi-directional communications between the device-to-gateway and\ngateway-to-cloud.\n\
    Figure 2. Diagram describing the components of an IoT platform.\nThe communication\
    \ protocols that are the third component of the IoT platform, enable the\ndifferent\
    \ devices to communicate and share their data with the controllers or the decision\
    \ making\ncenters. IoT platforms offer the ﬂexibility to select the type of the\
    \ communication technologies (each\nhaving speciﬁc features), according to the\
    \ needs of the application. The examples of these technologies\ninclude Wi-Fi,\
    \ Bluetooth, ZigBee [39] and cellular technology such as LTE-4G and 5G networks\
    \ [40].\nThe data storage is the fourth component of the IoT platform which enables\
    \ management of collected\ndata from the sensors.\nIn principle, the data collected\
    \ from the devices is very large. This necessitates planning an\nefﬁcient data\
    \ storage that can be in cloud servers or at the edge of an IoT network. The stored\
    \ data\nwhich is used for analytical purposes, forms the ﬁfth component of the\
    \ IoT platforms. The data\nanalytics can be performed off-line after storing the\
    \ data or it can be in form of real-time analytics.\nThe data analytic is performed\
    \ for decision making about the operation of the application. Based on\nthe need,\
    \ the data analytics can be performed off-line or real-time. In off-line analytics,\
    \ the stored\ndata is ﬁrst collected and then visualized on premises using visualization\
    \ tools. In case of real-time\nanalytics, the cloud or edge servers are used to\
    \ provide visualization, e.g. stream analytics [41].\nEnergies 2020, 13, 494\n\
    5 of 27\n3. Enabling Technologies\nIoT is a paradigm in which objects and elements\
    \ of a system that are equipped with sensors,\nactuators, and processors can communicate\
    \ with each other to provide meaningful services. In IoT\nsystems, sensors are\
    \ used to sense and collect data, and through gateways route the collected data\
    \ to\ncontrol centers or the cloud for further storage, processing, analytics,\
    \ and decision-making. After the\ndecision is made, a corresponding command is\
    \ then sent back to the actuator installed on the system\nin response to the sensed\
    \ data. As there are variety of sensor and actuator devices, communication\ntechnologies,\
    \ and data computing approached, in this section, we explain the existing technologies\n\
    which enable IoT. Then, we provide examples from the literature how these technologies\
    \ are used in\nthe energy sector.\n3.1. Sensor Devices\nSensors are the key drivers\
    \ of IoT [42]. They are employed to collect and transmit data in real-time.\n\
    The use of sensors enhances effectiveness, functionality, and plays a critical\
    \ role in success of IoT [43].\nDifferent types of sensors exist that are developed\
    \ for various application purposes. The examples\nof these applications include\
    \ agriculture industry, environmental monitoring, healthcare systems\nand services,\
    \ and public safety [44]. In practice, in the energy sector including energy production,\n\
    transmission and distribution, and production, many these sensors are used. In\
    \ the energy sector,\nsensors are used to create savings in both cost and energy.\
    \ Sensors enable smart energy management\nsystem and provide real-time energy\
    \ optimization and facilitate new approaches for energy load\nmanagement. The\
    \ research and future trends of the sensor devices are also aims at development\n\
    of sensor applications to improve load shaping and consumers’ awareness as well\
    \ as development\nof speciﬁc facilities to enhance production of renewable energies\
    \ [45]. In nutshell, the use of sensor\ndevices within IoT, in the energy sector\
    \ largely improves diagnostics, decision-making, analytics,\noptimization processes\
    \ and integrated performance metrics. Due to the large number of sensors used\n\
    in the energy sector, in the following we explain few examples of commonly applied\
    \ sensor devices in\nenergy production and consumption.\nTemperature sensors are\
    \ used to detect the ﬂuctuations in heating and cooling a system [46].\nTemperature\
    \ is an important and common environmental parameter. In the energy sector, the\
    \ basic\nprinciple of power generation is the process of changing mechanical energy\
    \ into electrical energy,\nwhereas mechanical energy is achieved from heat energy,\
    \ e.g., thermal power plants, wind, water ﬂow,\nand solar power plants. These\
    \ energy conversions are obtained using thermal, i.e., temperature. In the\nenergy\
    \ consumption side, the temperature sensors are used to maximize the performance\
    \ of a system\nwhen temperature changes during normal operations. For example,\
    \ in residential areas the best time\nfor turning on or off the ventilation and\
    \ cooling systems is recognized by temperature sensors; thus,\nthe energy can\
    \ be managed correctly in order to save energy [42].\nHumidity sensors are used\
    \ to distinguish the amount moisture and air’s humidity. The ratio of\nmoisture\
    \ in the air to the highest amount of moisture at a particular air temperature\
    \ is called relative\nhumidity [47]. The applications of humidity sensors in the\
    \ energy sector are wide. For example, they\nare generally used in wind energy\
    \ production. The use of humidity sensors on wind turbines are\neven vital, if\
    \ the turbines are located offshore (due to the high level of moisture in the\
    \ air). Humidity\nsensors can be placed in the nacelle and in the bottom of wind\
    \ turbines and offer continuous moisture\nmonitoring. This enables the operators\
    \ to take actions to changes or deviations in the turbine operation\nconditions,\
    \ leading to more consistent operations, optimized performance, and lower costs\
    \ of energy.\nLight sensors are used to measure luminance (ambient light level)\
    \ or the brightness of a light.\nIn energy consumption, light sensors have several\
    \ uses in industrial and everyday consumer\napplications.\nAs a main source of\
    \ energy consumption in buildings relates to lighting, which,\nrespectively, account\
    \ for nearly 15% of total electricity usage [48]. On global scale, approximately\
    \ 20%\nof electricity is consumed for lighting [49]. Therefore, light sensors\
    \ can be utilized to automatically\ncontrol lighting levels indoors and outdoors\
    \ by turning on-and-off or dimming the light levels, such\nEnergies 2020, 13,\
    \ 494\n6 of 27\nthat the electric light levels automatically can be adjusted in\
    \ response to changes in ambient light.\nIn this fashion, the energy required\
    \ for the lighting for the indoor environments can be reduced [19].\nPassive Infrared\
    \ (PIR) sensors, also known as motion sensors, are used for measuring the infrared\n\
    light radiation emitted from objects in their surroundings. In energy consumption,\
    \ these sensors are\nused to reduce the energy consumption in buildings. For example,\
    \ by using PIR sensors, the presence\nof humans inside spaces can be detected.\
    \ If there is no movement detected in the space then the light\ncontrol of the\
    \ space turns off the light, i.e., smart control of lighting. In this fashion,\
    \ the electricity\nconsumption of the buildings are reduced [50]. Similarly, this\
    \ can be applied for air conditioning\nsystems which consume nearly 40% of the\
    \ energy in buildings [48].\nProximity sensors are utilized to detect the presence\
    \ of nearby objects without any physical\ncontact [51]. The example application\
    \ of proximity sensors is in wind energy production. These sensors\nprovide longevity\
    \ and reliable position sensing performance in wind turbines. In wind turbines,\n\
    the applications of proximity sensors include blade pitch control, yaw position,\
    \ rotor, and yaw brake\nposition; brake wear monitoring; and rotor speed monitoring\
    \ [52].\n3.2. Actuators\nActuators are devices that transform a certain form of\
    \ energy into motion. They take electrical\ninput from the automation systems,\
    \ transform the input into action, and act on the devices and\nmachines within\
    \ the IoT systems [53]. Actuators produce different motion patterns such as linear,\n\
    oscillatory, or rotating motions. Based on the energy sources, actuators categorized\
    \ as the following\ntypes [54].\nPneumatic actuators use compressed air for generating\
    \ motion. Pneumatic actuators are composed\nof a piston or a diaphragm in order\
    \ to generate the motive power. These actuators are used to control\nprocesses\
    \ which require quick and accurate response, as these processes do not need a\
    \ large amount of\nmotive force.\nHydraulic actuators utilize the liquid for generating\
    \ motion. Hydraulic actuators consist of cylinder\nor ﬂuid motor that uses hydraulic\
    \ power to provide mechanical operation. The mechanical motion\ngives an output\
    \ in terms of linear, rotatory, or oscillatory motion. These actuators are used\
    \ in industrial\nprocess control where high speed and large forces are required.\n\
    Thermal actuators use a heat source for generating the physical action. Thermal\
    \ actuators convert\nthermal energy into kinetic energy, or motion. Generally,\
    \ thermostatic actuators are composed of a\ntemperature-sensing material sealed\
    \ by a diaphragm which pushes against a plug for moving a piston.\nThe temperature-sensing\
    \ material can be any type of liquid, gas, wax-like substance, or any material\n\
    that changes volume based on temperature.\nElectric actuators apply external energy\
    \ sources, e.g., batteries to generate motion. Electric actuators\nare mechanical\
    \ devices capable of converting electricity into kinetic energy in either a single\
    \ linear or\nrotary motion. The designs of these actuators are based on the intended\
    \ tasks within the processes.\nIn the energy sector, for example, in power plants,\
    \ pneumatic actuators are traditionally\napplied to control valves.\nElectric\
    \ control-valve actuator technology enables achieving energy\nefﬁciency.\nThey\
    \ are also often used as the ﬁnal control element in the operation of a power\n\
    plant [55]. In addition, there are variety of actuators developed for energy industry,\
    \ e.g., LINAK\nelectric actuator (https://www.linak.com/business-areas/energy/)\
    \ that offer solutions for example\nfor minimizing the energy waste when opening\
    \ hatches and locking brakes in wind turbines and\ncreating motion in solar tracking\
    \ panels. In the literature there are also many studies aimed to illustrate\n\
    the applications of the actuators within IoT. For instance, the research in [56]\
    \ proposes a wireless sensor\nand actuator network to provide an IoT-based automatic\
    \ intelligent system. Whereas, by optimizing\nthe operation of devices and machines\
    \ in the IoT, the proposed system achieves reduction in their\noverall energy\
    \ consumption at a given time.\nEnergies 2020, 13, 494\n7 of 27\n3.3. Communication\
    \ Technologies\nWireless communication systems play the major role in activating\
    \ IoT. Wireless systems connect\nthe sensor devices to IoT gateways and perform\
    \ end-to-end data communications between these\nelements of IoT. Wireless systems\
    \ are developed based on different wireless standards and the use of\neach one\
    \ depends on the requirement of the application such as communication range, bandwidth,\n\
    and power consumption requirements. For example, often renewable sources of energy,\
    \ including\nwind and solar power plants are mostly located in very remote areas.\
    \ Therefore, ensuring a reliable\nIoT communications in remote places is challenging.\
    \ Employing IoT systems on these sites requires\nselection of suitable communication\
    \ technology that can guarantee a continues connection link and\nsupport real-time\
    \ data transfer in an energy efﬁcient manner. Due to the importance of communication\n\
    technologies in IoT, in this subsection we review some of these technologies.\
    \ We also indicate to few\nexamples to show their role in the energy sector. Then,\
    \ we provide a comparison in Table 1 to show\nthe difference of each of the technologies\
    \ when applied with IoT.\nThe short range wireless technologies, e.g., Wireless\
    \ Fidelity (Wi-Fi) (https://www.wi-ﬁ.org/) for\nIoT applications in the energy\
    \ sector has been widely studies. In the energy sector, the obvious cases of\n\
    using Wi-Fi include energy metering and building energy management [57–61]. However,\
    \ due to high\npower requirements of Wi-Fi, this technology is not the best solution\
    \ in the energy sector. Low power\nwide area network (LPWAN) communication technologies\
    \ such as narrowband IoT (NB-IoT); ZigBee;\nBluetooth low energy (BLE) technologies;\
    \ as well as the emerging LPWAN technologies such as LoRa,\nSigfox, and LTE-M\
    \ operating in unlicensed band [62] are better solutions to be used in the energy\
    \ sector.\nBecause, these emerging LPWAN technologies enable establishing a reliable,\
    \ low-cost, low-power,\nlong-range, last-mile technology for smart energy management\
    \ solutions [63]. Therefore, in this paper,\nwe explain the short range and emerging\
    \ LPWAN technologies and review some examples for their\napplied cases in the\
    \ energy sector. We also explain the satellite technology which plays an important\n\
    role in providing global IoT connectivity for industrial sectors located remote\
    \ areas. In addition,\nin Table 1, we illustrate the different features of these\
    \ technologies.\nBluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a short range wireless communication\
    \ technology for IoT that\nenables exchanging data using short radio wavelengths\
    \ (https://www.bluetooth.com/). BLE is less\ncostly to deploy, with a typical\
    \ range of 0 to 30 m, which enables creating an instant personal area\nnetwork\
    \ [64]. BLE targets small-scale IoT applications that require devices to communicate\
    \ small\nvolumes of data consuming minimal power. Industries in the energy sector\
    \ with a well-designed IoT\nstrategy can create new forms of machine-to-machine\
    \ and machine-to-human communication using\nthis technology. In the energy sector,\
    \ BLE is widely used on the energy consumption in residential and\ncommercial\
    \ buildings. For instance, the authors of [65] describe a smart ofﬁce energy management\n\
    system that reduces the energy consumption of PCs, monitors, and lights using\
    \ BLE. Another study\nproposes an energy management system for smart homes that\
    \ utilizes BLE for communication among\nhome appliances aiming at decreasing the\
    \ energy at homes [66]. Similarly, using BLE the research\nin [67] introduces\
    \ a fuzzy-based solution for smart energy management in a home automation, aiming\n\
    improving home energy management scheme.\nZigbee is a communication technology,\
    \ which is designed to create personal area network and\ntargets small scale applications\
    \ (https://zigbee.org/). Zigbee is easy to implement and planned to\nprovide low-cost,\
    \ low-data rate, and highly reliable networks for low-power applications [68,69].\n\
    Zigbee also utilizes a mesh network speciﬁcation where devices are connected with\
    \ many\ninterconnections. Using the mesh networking feature of Zigbee, the maximum\
    \ communication range,\nwhich is up to 100 m, is extended signiﬁcantly. In the\
    \ energy sector, the example IoT applications of\nZigbee include lighting systems\
    \ (buildings and street lighting), smart grids, e.g., smart electric meters,\n\
    home automation systems and industrial automation. These applications aim to provide\
    \ approaches\nfor consuming energy in an efﬁcient way. In literature, aiming to\
    \ minimize the energy expenses of the\nconsumers, the research in [70] evaluates\
    \ the performance of home energy management application\nthrough establishing\
    \ a wireless sensor network using Zigbee. The authors of [71] also introduce smart\n\
    Energies 2020, 13, 494\n8 of 27\nhome interfaces to allow interoperability among\
    \ ZigBee devices, electrical equipment, and smart\nmeters to utilize the energy\
    \ more efﬁciently. The work in [72] presents a ZigBee-based monitoring\nsystem\
    \ which is used to measure and transfer the energy of home appliances at the outlets\
    \ and the\nlights, aiming at reducing the energy consumption. Another study [73]\
    \ presents ﬁeld tests using\nZigBee technologies for monitoring photovoltaic and\
    \ wind energy systems. The results of the study\ndemonstrate the proﬁciency of\
    \ ZigBee devices applied in distributed renewable generation and smart\nmetering\
    \ systems.\nLong Range (LoRa) LoRa is a wireless communication technology designed\
    \ for IoT (https://lora-\nalliance.org/). LoRA is a cost-effective communication\
    \ technology for large deployment of IoT, it can\nadd many years to battery life.\
    \ LoRa is also used to establish long-distance broadcasts (more than\n10 km in\
    \ rural areas) with very low power consumption [74]. The features of this technology\
    \ make it\na suitable communication technology to be used in the energy sector\
    \ mainly in smart cities, such as\nsmart grids and building automation systems,\
    \ e.g., smart metering.\nIn literature, the work in [75] aims at optimizing energy\
    \ consumption by deploying building\nenergy management system using LoRa. The\
    \ work proposes a platform by integrating multiple\nsystems, such as air-conditioning,\
    \ lighting, and energy monitoring to perform building energy\noptimization. The\
    \ outcome of platform resulted in a 20% energy saving. In [76], the authors developed\n\
    a machine-learning-based smart controller for a commercial buildings HVAC utilizing\
    \ LoRa. The smart\ncontroller identiﬁes when a room is not unoccupied and turns\
    \ off the HVAC, reducing its energy\nconsumption up to 19.8%. Using LoRa technology,\
    \ another study [77] presents implementation of\nan electronic platform for energy\
    \ management in public buildings. Through a test, the developed\nplatform allows\
    \ saving the energy for a lighting system by 40%.\nSigfox is a wide area network\
    \ technology which uses an ultra narrow band (https://www.sigfox.\ncom/). Sigfox\
    \ allows devices to communicate with low power for enabling IoT applications [78].\n\
    For the appropriateness of this technology in the energy sector for example, the\
    \ study in [79] reviews\nthe technological advances and presents Sigfox as one\
    \ of the best low power candidates for smart\nmetering for enabling real-time\
    \ energy services for households. In addition, the study in [80] compare\ndifferent\
    \ low power wide area network technologies and conclude that Sigfox is a suitable\
    \ solution to\nbe used with electric plugs sensors alert in smart buildings.\n\
    Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) is a LPWAN communication technology that supports large\
    \ number of\nIoT devices and services with a high data rate with very low latency\
    \ (https://www.3gpp.org/news-\nevents/1733-niot/). NB-IoT is a low-cost solution\
    \ that has long battery life and provides enhanced\ncoverage. According to the\
    \ authors of [81], due to the latency features of NB-IoT, this technology is a\n\
    potential solution for smart energy distribution networks by providing low-cost\
    \ communications for\nsmart meters. In addition, the study in [82] demonstrates\
    \ the NB-IoT technology for smart metering.\nAs another application of NB-IoT\
    \ in the energy sector, the work in [83] introduces NB-IoT as a potential\nsolution\
    \ for smart grid communications by comparing NB-IoT with other communication technologies\n\
    in terms of data rate, latency, and communication range.\nLong Term Evolution\
    \ for Machine-Type Communications (LTE-M) is the 3GPP (the third-generation\n\
    partnership project) standardization, which is designed to reduce the device complexity\
    \ for\nmachine-type communication (MTC) [84].\nLTE-M supports secure communication,\
    \ provides\nubiquitous coverage, and offers high system capacity. LTE-M also offers\
    \ services of lower latency and\nhigher throughput than NB-IoT [85]. In addition,\
    \ this technology offers energy efﬁciency resource\nallocation for small powered\
    \ devices, making it to be a potential solution for smart meter [86] and\nsmart\
    \ grid communications [87].\nWeightless is LPWAN open wireless standard that is\
    \ developed to establish communication among\ngreat number of IoT devices and\
    \ machines (http://www.weightless.org/). Weightless is a potential\nsolution for\
    \ smart metering in the energy sector [88]. Based on the study in [89], Weightless\
    \ is a\nsuitable wireless technology can be used in smart home IoT applications\
    \ for smart metering and smart\ngrid communications.\nEnergies 2020, 13, 494\n\
    9 of 27\nSatellite is another communication technology that has a very wide-area\
    \ coverage and can support\nlow data rate applications in machine-to-machine (M2M)\
    \ fashion [90]. Satellite technology is suitable\nfor supporting IoT devices and\
    \ machines in remote places. The study in [91] presents an IoT-based\nmachine-to-machine\
    \ satellite communication that is applicable to the smart grid, particularly for\n\
    the transmission and distribution (T&D) sector. A similar study highlights the\
    \ importance of using\nsatellite-based IoT communications in energy domain such\
    \ as solar and wind power plants [92].\nTable 1. Comparison between different\

    Computing and analyzing the data generated by IoT allows gaining deeper insight,\
    \ accurate\nresponse to the system, and helps making suitable decisions on energy\
    \ consumption of the systems [99].\nHowever, computing IoT data is a challenging\
    \ issue. Because, IoT data known as Big data refers to\nhuge amount of structured\
    \ and unstructured data, generated from various elements of IoT systems\nsuch\
    \ as sensors, software applications, smart or intelligent devices, and communication\
    \ networks.\nDue to the characteristics of Big data, which are big volume, high\
    \ velocity, and high variety [100],\nit needs to be efﬁciently processed and analyzed\
    \ [101]. Processing the Big data is beyond the capacity\nof traditional methods,\
    \ i.e., storing it on local hard drives, computing, and analyzing them afterwards.\n\
    Advanced computing and analytic methods are needed to manage the Big data [102,103].\
    \ In the\nfollowings, we explain cloud computing and fog computing, which are\
    \ widely used for processing\nand computing the Big data.\n3.4.1. Cloud Computing\n\
    Cloud computing is a data processing approach that offers services, applications,\
    \ storage,\nand computing through the internet and allows computation of data\
    \ streamed from IoT devices.\nIn cloud computing, cloud refers to the “Internet”\
    \ and computing refers to computation and processing\nservices offered by this\
    \ approach [104]. Cloud computing consists of both application services that are\n\
    accessed via the Internet and the hardware systems, which are located in data\
    \ centers [105]. Using these\ncharacteristics, cloud computing enables processing\
    \ the big data, and provides complex computation\ncapabilities [106]. The main\
    \ beneﬁts of using cloud systems relies on [107] (i) signiﬁcantly reducing\nthe\
    \ cost of hardware; (ii) enhancing the computing power and storage capacity; and\
    \ (iii) having\nmulti-core architectures, which eases the data management.\nMoreover,\
    \ cloud computing is a\nsecured system, which provides resources, computing power,\
    \ and storage that is needed from a\nEnergies 2020, 13, 494\n10 of 27\ngeographical\
    \ location [108]. These features of cloud computing enables the big data resulted\
    \ from the\ngrowing applications of IoT to be easily analyzed, controlled and\
    \ sorted efﬁciently [109]. In addition,\ncloud computing eliminates the costs\
    \ needed for purchasing hardware and software and running the\nalgorithms for\
    \ processing the IoT data, resulting in considerably minimization of electricity\
    \ needed for\nlocal data computation.\n3.4.2. Fog Computing\nAlthough cloud computing\
    \ is one of the best computing paradigms for data processing for IoT\napplications.\
    \ Due to the delay and bandwidth limitation of centralized resources that are\
    \ used for\ndata processing, more efﬁcient ways are required. Fog computing is\
    \ a distributed paradigm and an\nextension of the cloud, which moves the computing\
    \ and analytic services near to the edge of the\nnetwork. Fog computing is a paradigm\
    \ that expands the cloud at a greater scale and can support\nlarger workload [110].\
    \ In fog computing, any device with computing, storage, and network connection\n\
    capability works as fog node. The examples of these devices include, but are not\
    \ limited to, personal\ncomputers, industrial controllers, switches, routers,\
    \ and embedded servers [111]. In this computing\nparadigm, fog provides IoT data\
    \ processing and storage locally at IoT devices instead of sending them\nto the\
    \ cloud. The advantages of this approach include enhanced secure services required\
    \ for many IoT\napplications as well as reducing network trafﬁc and latency [112].\
    \ Therefore, in contrast to the cloud\ncomputing, fog offers processing and computing\
    \ services with faster response with higher security.\nThis enables faster decision-making\
    \ and taking appropriate actions.\n4. IoT in the Energy Sector\nToday, the energy\
    \ sector is highly dependent on fossil fuels, constituting nearly 80 % of ﬁnal\n\
    energy globally. Excessive extraction and combustion of fossil fuels has adverse\
    \ environmental, health,\nand economic impacts due to air pollution and climate\
    \ change to name a few. Energy efﬁciency,\ni.e., consuming less energy for delivering\
    \ the same service, and the deployment of renewable energy\nsources are two main\
    \ alternatives to diminish the adverse impacts of fossil fuel use [12,13].\nIn\
    \ this section, we discuss the role of IoT in the energy sector, from fuel extraction,\
    \ operation,\nand maintenance (O&M) of energy generating assets, to T&D and end\
    \ use of energy IoT can play a\ncrucial role in reducing energy losses and lowering\
    \ CO2 emissions. An energy management system\nbased on IoT can monitor real-time\
    \ energy consumption and increase the level of awareness about the\nenergy performance\
    \ at any level of the supply chain [15,113]. This section discusses the application\
    \ of\nIoT in energy generation stages ﬁrst. Then, we continue with the concept\
    \ of smart cities, which is an\numbrella term for many IoT-based subsystems such\
    \ as smart grids, smart buildings, smart factories,\nand intelligent transportation.\
    \ Next, we discuss each of the above-mentioned components separately.\nFinally,\
    \ we summarize the ﬁndings of this section in Tables 2 and 3.\n4.1. IoT and Energy\
    \ Generation\nAutomating industrial processes and supervisory control and data\
    \ acquisition systems became\npopular in the power sector in 1990s [37]. By monitoring\
    \ and controlling equipment and processes,\nearly stages of IoT started to contribute\
    \ to the power sector by alleviating the risk of loss of production\nor blackout.\
    \ Reliability, efﬁciency, environmental impacts, and maintenance issues are the\
    \ main\nchallenges of old power plants. The age of equipment in the power sector\
    \ and poor maintenance\nproblems can lead to high level of energy losses and unreliability.\
    \ Assets are sometimes more than\n40 years old, very expensive, and cannot be\
    \ replaced easily. IoT can contribute to reducing some of\nthese challenges in\
    \ the management of power plants [37]. By applying IoT sensors, Internet-connected\n\
    devices are able to distinguish any failure in the operation or abnormal decrease\
    \ in energy efﬁciency,\nalarming the need for maintenance. This increases reliability\
    \ and efﬁciency of the system, in addition\nto reducing the cost of maintenance\
    \ [114]. According to [115], a new IoT-based power plant can save\nEnergies 2020,\

    \ with the same size can save 50 million USD\nif equipped with the IoT platform.\n\

    \ local energy resources, many countries are promoting\nRESs. Weather-dependent\
    \ or variable renewable energy (VRE) sources, such as wind and solar energy,\n\
    pose new challenges to the energy system known as “the intermittency challenge”.\
    \ In an energy\nsystem with a high share of VRE, matching generation of energy\
    \ with demand is a big challenge due to\nvariability of supply and demand resulting\
    \ in mismatch in different time scales. IoT systems offer the\nﬂexibility in balancing\
    \ generation with demand, which in turn can reduce the challenges of deploying\n\
    VRE, resulting in higher integration shares of clean energy and less GHG emissions\
    \ [116]. In addition,\nby employing IoT, a more efﬁcient use of energy can be\
    \ achieved by using machine-learning algorithms\nthat help determine an optimal\
    \ balance of different supply and demand technologies [37]. For instance,\nthe\
    \ use of artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms can balance the power output of a thermal\
    \ power plant with\nthe sources of in-house power generation, e.g., aggregating\
    \ many small-scale solar PV panels [117].\nTable 2 summarizes the applications\

    \ of urbanization as well as overpopulation has brought many\nglobal concerns,\
    \ such as air and water pollution [118], energy access, and environmental concerns.\n\
    In this line, one of the main challenges is to provide the cities with clean,\
    \ affordable and reliable\nenergy sources. The recent developments in digital\
    \ technologies have provided a driving force to\napply smart, IoT based solutions\
    \ for the existing problems in a smart city context [119]. Smart factories,\n\
    smart homes, power plants, and farms in a city can be connected and the data about\
    \ their energy\nEnergies 2020, 13, 494\n13 of 27\nconsumption in different hours\
    \ of the day can be gathered. If it is found that a section, e.g., residential\n\
    areas, consumes the most energy in the afternoon, then automatically energy devoted\
    \ to other sections,\ne.g., factories, can be minimized to balance the whole system\
    \ at a minimum cost and risk of congestion\nor blackout.\nIn a smart city, different\
    \ processes, i.e., information transmission and communication, intelligent\nidentiﬁcation,\
    \ location determination, tracing, monitoring, pollution control, and identity\
    \ management\ncan be managed perfectly by the aid of IoT technology [120]. IoT\
    \ technologies can help to monitor\nevery object in a city. Buildings, urban infrastructure,\
    \ transport, energy networks, and utilities could\nbe connected to sensors. These\
    \ connections can ensure an energy-efﬁcient smart city by constant\nmonitoring\
    \ of data gathered from sensors. For example, by monitoring vehicles with IoT,\
    \ street lights\ncan be controlled for optimal use of energy. In addition, the\
    \ authorities can have access to the\ngathered information and can make more informed\
    \ decisions on transportation choices and their\nenergy demand.\n4.3. Smart Grid\n\
    Smart grids are modern grids deploying the most secure and dependable ICT technology\
    \ to\ncontrol and optimize energy generation, T&D grids, and end usage. By connecting\
    \ many smart\nmeters, a smart grid develops a multi-directional ﬂow of information,\
    \ which can be used for optimal\nmanagement of the system and efﬁcient energy\
    \ distribution [121]. The application of smart grid can be\nhighlighted in different\
    \ subsectors of the energy system individually, e.g., energy generation, buildings,\n\
    or transportation, or they can be considered altogether.\nIn traditional grids,\
    \ batteries were recharged by adapters through electricity cables and AC/DC\n\
    inverter [121]. These batteries can be charged wirelessly in a smart grid, using\
    \ an inductive charging\ntechnology. In addition, in a smart grid, the energy\
    \ demand pattern of end users can be analyzed\nby collecting data through an IoT\
    \ platform, for example, the time of charging of mobile phones or\nelectric cars.\
    \ Then, the nearest wireless battery charge station can allocate the right time-slot\
    \ and that\ndevice/vehicle can be charged. Another advantage is that the use of\
    \ IoT will lead to better control\nand monitoring of the battery equipped devices,\
    \ and therefore, ﬁrst, the energy distribution can be\nadjusted, and second, the\
    \ delivery of electricity to these vehicles can be guaranteed. This will reduce\n\
    unnecessary energy consumption considerably.\nMoreover, IoT can be applied in\
    \ isolated and microgrids for some islands or organizations,\nespecially when\
    \ energy is required every single moment with no exception, e.g., in databases.\
    \ In such\nsystems, all the assets connected to the grid can interact with each\
    \ other. Also, the data on energy\ndemand of any asset is accessible. This interaction\
    \ can assure the perfect management of the energy\ndistribution whenever and everywhere\
    \ needed. In terms of collaborative impact of smart grids, as it is\nshown in\
    \ Figure 3, in a smart city equipped with IoT-based smart grids, different sections\
    \ of the city\ncan be connected together [121].\nDuring the collaborative communication\
    \ between different sectors, the smart grid can alert\noperators through smart\
    \ appliances before any acute problem occurs [113,122]. For example, through\n\
    constant monitoring, it can be detected if energy demand exceeds the capacity\
    \ of the grid. Therefore,\nby acquiring real-time data, different strategies can\
    \ be adopted by authorities and energy consumption\ncan be rescheduled to a different\
    \ time when there is lower expected demand. In some regions, smart (or\ndynamic)\
    \ pricing tariffs have been considered for variable energy prices in this regard\
    \ [123]. Real-time\npricing (RTP) tariffs as well as the energy price will be\
    \ higher at a certain time when the consumption\nof energy is likely to be higher.\
    \ Through the data gathered from the components of the smart grid,\nenergy consumption\
    \ and generation can be perfectly optimized and managed by far-sighted strategies.\n\
    Reduction of transmission losses in T&D networks through active voltage management\
    \ or reduction\nof non-technical losses using a network of smart meters are other\
    \ examples of applying IoT [37].\nEnergies 2020, 13, 494\n14 of 27\nFigure 3.\
    \ A centralized data connectivity in a smart city concept.\n4.4. Smart Buildings\n\
    The energy consumption in cities can be divided into different parts; residential\
    \ buildings\n(domestic); and commercial (services), including shops, ofﬁces, and\
    \ schools, and transport.\nThe domestic energy consumption in the residential\
    \ sector includes lighting, equipment (appliances),\ndomestic hot water, cooking,\
    \ refrigerating, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) (Figure 4).\n\
    HVAC energy consumption typically accounts for half of energy consumption in buildings\
    \ [124].\nTherefore, the management of HVAC systems is important in reducing electricity\
    \ consumption.\nWith the advancement of technology in the industry, IoT devices\
    \ can play an important role to control\nthe energy losses in HVAC systems. For\
    \ example, by locating some wireless thermostats based on\noccupancy, unoccupied\
    \ places can be realized. Once an unoccupied zone is detected, some actions can\n\
    be taken to lower energy consumption. For instance, HVAC systems can reduce the\
    \ operation in the\nunoccupied zone, which will lead to signiﬁcant reduction in\
    \ energy consumption and losses.\nFigure 4. Share of residential energy consumption.\n\
    IoT can also be applied to manage the energy losses of lighting systems. For example,\
    \ through\napplying IoT-based lighting systems, the customers will be alerted\
    \ when the energy consumption\ngoes beyond the standard level. Furthermore, by\
    \ an efﬁcient analysis of the real-time data, load from\nEnergies 2020, 13, 494\n\
    15 of 27\nhigh-peak will be shifted to low-peak levels. This makes a signiﬁcant\
    \ contribution to optimal use of\nelectrical energy [119,125] and reducing related\
    \ greenhouse gas emissions. Using IoT, the demand\nresponse will be more agile\
    \ and ﬂexible, and the monitoring and demand side management will\nbecome more\
    \ efﬁcient.\n4.5. Smart Use of Energy in Industry\nIoT can be employed to design\
    \ a fully connected and ﬂexible system in the industry to reduce\nenergy consumption\
    \ while optimizing production. In traditional factories, a lot of energy is spent\n\
    to produce the end product and control the quality of the end product. Moreover,\
    \ monitoring every\nsingle process requires human resources to be involved. However,\
    \ using an agile and ﬂexible system in\nsmart factories helps to recognize failures\
    \ at the same time rather than recognizing them by monitoring\nthe products at\
    \ the end of production line. Therefore, a suitable action can be taken promptly\
    \ to avert\nwasteful production and associated waste energy.\nIn terms of monitoring\
    \ processes during manufacturing, IoT, and its enabling technology play\na crucial\
    \ role. Gateway devices, IoT hub networks, web servers, and cloud platforms, which\
    \ are\naccessible with smart mobile devices (e.g., smart phones or personal computers)\
    \ can be examples\nof monitoring equipment. Wireless communications such as Wi-Fi,\
    \ Bluetooth, ZigBee, Z-wave,\nor wired communications, such as Local Area Network\
    \ (LAN) can be used to connect all pieces\nof equipment [126]. Moreover, to use\
    \ IoT more efﬁciently, by installing sensors on each component of\nan industrial\
    \ site, the components that consume more energy than their nominal energy level\
    \ can be\ndetected. Thus, every single component can be easily managed, the faults\
    \ of components can be ﬁxed,\nand the energy consumption of each component can\
    \ be optimized. This eminently results in reducing\nthe energy losses in smart\
    \ factories.\nIn a smart factory, data processing is the key element in the whole\
    \ system, through which data in\nthe cloud platform (acts as a brain) will be\
    \ analyzed to help managers making more efﬁcient decisions\nin time [127]. In\
    \ terms of monitoring and maintaining assets of manufacturing, the big problem\
    \ in\nfactories is the depreciation of machines and mechanical devices. With an\
    \ appropriate IoT platform and\ntools, the proper device size can be selected\
    \ to reduce wear and tear and the associated maintenance\ncosts. IoT-based conditional\
    \ monitoring ensures the mechanical device never reaches its threshold\nlimit.\
    \ This simply means the device lasts longer and suffers fewer failures. Moreover,\
    \ the failures that\ncause energy loss can be anticipated to be tackled.\nIoT-based\
    \ agile systems can provide a smart system for collaboration between customers,\n\
    manufactures, and companies. Therefore, a speciﬁc product will be manufactured\
    \ directly according\nto customers’ order. Therefore, energy consumed during the\
    \ process of storing spare parts as well\nas the energy wasted in warehouses to\
    \ keep the spare parts will be dwindled signiﬁcantly. Only a\ncertain number of\
    \ products in various kinds will be manufactured and stored, which enhances the\n\
    management of energy consumption and production efﬁciency [126].\n4.6. Intelligent\
    \ Transportation\nOne of the major causes of air pollution and energy losses in\
    \ big cities is overuse of private vehicles\ninstead of public transportation.\
    \ As opposed to a traditional transportation system where each system\nworks independently,\
    \ applying IoT technologies in transportation, so called “smart transportation”,\n\
    offers a global management system. Also, the real-time data processing plays a\
    \ signiﬁcant role in trafﬁc\nmanagement. All the components of the transportation\
    \ system can be connected together, and their\ndata can be processed together.\
    \ Congestion control and smart parking systems using online maps\nare some applications\
    \ of smart transportation. Smart use of transportation enables passengers to\n\
    select a more cost-saving option with shorter distance and the fastest route,\
    \ which saves a signiﬁcant\namount of time and energy [120]. Citizens will be\
    \ able to determine their arrival time and manage\ntheir schedule more efﬁciently\
    \ [125]. Therefore, time of city trips will be shortened, and the energy\nEnergies\
    \ 2020, 13, 494\n16 of 27\nlosses will be reduced signiﬁcantly. This can remarkably\
    \ reduce CO2 emissions and other air polluting\ngases from transportation [119].\n\
    Table 3 summarizes the applications of IoT in the energy sector, from smart energy\
    \ grids to the\nend use of energy. The IoT-based digitalization transforms an\
    \ energy system from a unidirectional\ndirection, i.e., from generation through\
    \ energy grids to consumers, to an integrated energy system.\nDifferent parts\
    \ of such an integrated smart energy system are depicted in Figure 5.\nFigure\
    \ 5. Applications of IoT in an integrated smart energy system.\n5. Challenges\
    \ of Applying IoT\nBesides all the beneﬁts of IoT for energy saving, deploying\
    \ IoT in the energy sector represents\nchallenges that need to be addressed. This\
    \ section addresses the challenges and existing solutions for\napplying IoT-based\
    \ energy systems. In addition, in Table 4, we summarize the challenges and current\n\
    solutions of using IoT in the energy sector.\n5.1. Energy Consumption\nIn the\
    \ energy systems, the major effort of IoT platforms are saving the energy. In\
    \ energy systems\nto enable communication using IoT, massive number of IoT devices\
    \ transmit data. To run the IoT\nsystem and transmit huge amount of data generated\
    \ from the IoT devices considerable amount of\nenergy is needed [128]. Therefore,\
    \ the energy consumption of IoT systems remains as an important\nchallenge. However,\
    \ various approaches have tried to reduce the power consumption of IoT systems.\n\
    For example, by setting the sensors to go to sleep mode and just work when necessary.\
    \ Designing\nefﬁcient communication protocols which allow distributed computing\
    \ techniques that enables energy\nefﬁcient communications has been studied greatly.\
    \ Applying radio optimization techniques such as\nmodulation optimization and\
    \ cooperative communication has been considered as a solution. Moreover,\nenergy-efﬁcient\
    \ routing techniques such as cluster architectures and employing multi-path routing\n\
    techniques was understood as another solution [129–131].\nEnergies 2020, 13, 494\n\

    decision-making\n5.2. Integration of IoT with Subsystems\nA main challenge includes\
    \ the integration of an IoT system in subsystems of the energy system.\nBecause\
    \ subsystems of the energy sector are unique employing various sensor and data\
    \ communication\ntechnologies. Therefore, solutions are needed for managing the\
    \ data exchange among subsystems\nof a IoT-enabled energy system [132–134]. An\
    \ approach for ﬁnding solutions for the integration\nchallenge, taking into account\
    \ the IoT requirements of a subsystem, pertains to modeling an integrated\nframework\
    \ for the energy system [132]. Other solutions propose designing co-simulation\
    \ models\nfor energy systems to integrate the system and minimize synchronization\
    \ delay error between the\nsubsystems [135,136].\n5.3. User Privacy\nPrivacy refers\
    \ to the right of individual or cooperative energy consumers to maintain\nconﬁdentiality\
    \ of their personal information when it is shared with an organization [137,138].\
    \ Therefore,\naccessing to proper data such as the number of energy users as well\
    \ as the number and types of\nappliances which use energy become impossible. Indeed,\
    \ these types of data which can be gathered\nusing IoT enables better decision-making\
    \ that can inﬂuence the energy production, distribution and\nconsumption [139].\
    \ However, to decrease the violation of users’ privacy, it is recommended that\
    \ the\nenergy providers ask for user permission to use their information [140],\
    \ guaranteeing that the users’\ninformation will not be shared with other parties.\
    \ Another solution would also be a trusted privacy\nmanagement system where energy\
    \ consumers have control over their information and privacy is\nsuggested [141].\n\
    5.4. Security Challenge\nThe use of IoT and integration of communication technologies\
    \ in energy systems enhances the\nthreat and cyber-attacks to information of users\
    \ and the energy systems from production, transmission,\nand distribution to consumption\
    \ [142,143]. These threads deﬁne the security challenge in the energy\nsector\
    \ [144]. Moreover, IoT-based energy systems are widely deployed in large geographical\
    \ areas\nEnergies 2020, 13, 494\n18 of 27\nwithin the energy sector to offer services.\
    \ The large deployment of IoT systems puts them in more\nrisk of being under cyberattacks.\
    \ To overcome the challenge, a study introduces an encryption scheme\nto secure\
    \ energy information from the cyberattacks [145]. In addition, distributed control\
    \ systems\nwhich enable control at different IoT system level are suggested to\
    \ reduce the risk of cyberattack and\nincreasing the security of system [146].\n\
    5.5. IoT Standards\nIoT uses a variety of technologies with different standards\
    \ to connect from a single device to a large\nnumber of devices. The inconsistency\
    \ among IoT devices that utilize different standards forms a new\nchallenge [147].\
    \ In IoT-enabled systems, there are two types of standards, including network\
    \ protocols,\ncommunication protocols, and data-aggregation standards as well\
    \ as regulatory standards related\nto security and privacy of data. The challenges\
    \ facing the adoption of standards within IoT include\nthe standards for handling\
    \ unstructured data, security and privacy issues in addition to regulatory\nstandards\
    \ for data markets [148]. An approach for overcoming the challenge of standardization\
    \ of\nIoT-based energy system is to deﬁne a system of systems with a common sense\
    \ of understanding to\nallow all actors to equally access and use. Another solution\
    \ pertains to developing open information\nmodels and protocols of the standards\
    \ by the cooperating parties. This shall result in standards which\nare freely\
    \ and publicly available [149].\n5.6. Architecture Design\nIoT-enabled systems\
    \ are composed of variety of technologies with increasing number of\nsmart interconnected\
    \ devices and sensors. IoT is expected to enable communications at anytime,\n\
    anywhere for any related services, generally, in an autonomic and ad hoc fashion.\
    \ This means\nthat the IoT systems based on their application purposes are designed\
    \ by complex, decentralized,\nand mobile characteristics [149].\nTaking into account\
    \ the characteristics and needs of an IoT\napplication, a reference architecture\
    \ cannot be a unique solution for all of these applications.\nTherefore, for IoT\
    \ systems, heterogeneous reference architectures are needed which are open and\n\
    follow standards. The architectures also should not limit the users to use ﬁxed\
    \ and end-to-end IoT\ncommunications [149,150].\n6. Future Trends\nApplying current\
    \ IoT systems for providing energy efﬁcient solutions in the energy sector has\n\
    many advantages highlighted in previous sections. However, for deploying IoT in\
    \ the energy domain,\nnew solutions and trends are needed to improve the performance\
    \ of IoT and overcome the associated\nchallenges. In this section, we present\
    \ the Blockchain technology and Green-IoT as two approaches\nthat can help to\
    \ tackle some of the challenges.\n6.1. Blockchain and IoT\nCurrent IoT systems\
    \ mostly rely on centralized cloud systems [151,152]. In most IoT applications,\n\
    thousands of IoT devices and machines need to be connected, which is hard to synchronize.\
    \ Moreover,\ndue to the centralized and server-client nature of IoT when server\
    \ is vulnerable, all the connected\nobjects are easy to be hacked and compromised,\
    \ which result in security concerns for the system and\nprivacy issues for users\
    \ [153]. Fortunately, Blockchain can be a solution for this challenge [154].\n\
    Blockchain provides a decentralized and democratized platform with no need for\
    \ third party’s\nintervention. The consensus platform of blockchain requires every\
    \ IoT node proves that it pursues the\nsame goal as others. Veriﬁed transactions\
    \ is also stored in the form of a block, which is linked\nto the previous one\
    \ in a way information can never be erased. Moreover, the history of every\nsingle\
    \ transaction at every node can be recorded and is accessible by everyone. Therefore,\
    \ any\nmember in blockchain becomes aware of any changes in each block immediately\
    \ [155–157]. Moreover,\ndue to the distributed ledger of blockchain, even thousands\
    \ of IoT devices can be synchronized\nEnergies 2020, 13, 494\n19 of 27\neasily.\
    \ The consensus algorithms of blockchain based on peer-to-peer networks can provide\
    \ a secure\ndistributed database [153]. Therefore, decentralized and private-by-design\
    \ IoT that can guarantee the\nprivacy can be promised by blockchain [158].\nMore\
    \ importantly, blockchain can store and share software updates between objects.\
    \ There are\ninnocuousness checking nodes that approve the accuracy of update\
    \ information as a new node and\nguarantee its protection from any threats, once\
    \ an update added to the blockchain as a valid block,\nit is impossible to erase\
    \ or change it. Therefore, IoT-based platforms can be provided with updates\n\
    availability and innocuousness through blockchain [159].\nIn the energy sector,\
    \ the application of blockchain will accelerate the IoT effectiveness by providing\n\
    a decentralized platform for distributed power generation and storage systems\
    \ enhancing energy\nsecurity and efﬁciency. Real and high-qualiﬁed data can be\
    \ exchanged freely between devices and\npeople can directly have access to energy\
    \ information without the involvement of any third party.\nNeighbors can simply\
    \ trade energy with one another. Therefore, without involvement of authorities,\n\
    not only trust will be enhanced among people, but also many costs of this connection\
    \ to the centralized\ngrids can be saved. Another advantage is that by monitoring\
    \ the usage statistics of an area, Blockchain\nenables the energy distribution\
    \ to remotely control energy ﬂow to that particular area. Furthermore,\nblockchain-based\
    \ IoT systems helps in the diagnosis and maintenance of equipment within smart\n\
    grid [154].\nCurrently, the direct application of blockchain technology in an\
    \ IoT-based system is impossible\ndue to lack of enough computational resources,\
    \ insufﬁcient bandwidth and the need to preserve power.\nHowever, cloud and fog\
    \ computing platforms can ease the way for blockchain services in IoT [160].\n\
    6.2. Green IoT\nThe energy consumption of IoT devices is an important challenge,\
    \ especially in large-scale\ndeployment of these technologies in near future.\
    \ To run billions of devices that will be connected\nto the Internet signiﬁcant\
    \ amount of energy is required. The big number of IoT devices will also\nproduce\
    \ a great deal of electronic waste [161]. To tackle these challenges, a low-carbon\
    \ and efﬁcient\ncommunication networks are needed. Fortunately, these necessities\
    \ has led to the appearance of\nthe green IoT (G-IoT) [162,163]. The key component\
    \ of G-IoT is its energy-efﬁcient characteristics\nthroughout the life cycle,\
    \ i.e., design, production, deployment, and ultimately disposal [129].\nG-IoT\
    \ cycle can be applied in different IoT technologies. For example, in radio frequency\n\
    identiﬁcation (RFID) tags. To decrease the amount of material in each RFID tag,\
    \ which is difﬁcult\nto be recycled, the size of RFID tags are reduced [161,164–168].\
    \ Green M2M communications is\nanother example, which enables adjusting power\
    \ transmission the minimum level, facilitates more\nefﬁcient communication protocols\
    \ using algorithmic and distributed computing techniques [129].\nIn wireless sensor\
    \ networks also the sensors nodes can be in the sleep mode and just work\nwhen\
    \ necessary. In addition, radio optimization techniques, such as, modulation optimization\
    \ or\ncooperative communication can be applied to reduce the power consumption\
    \ of the nodes. Moreover,\nenergy-efﬁcient routing techniques, such as, cluster\
    \ architectures or multi-path routing can provide\nefﬁcient solutions [130,131].\
    \ In conclusion, the above-mentioned approaches and examples can reduce\nthe energy\
    \ needs of IoT systems.\n7. Conclusions\nEnergy systems are on the threshold of\
    \ a new transition era. Large-scale deployment of VRE in\ndistributed energy systems\
    \ and the need for efﬁcient use of energy calls for system-wide, integrated\n\
    approaches to minimize the socio-economic-environmental impacts of energy systems.\
    \ In this respect,\nmodern technologies such as IoT can help the energy sector\
    \ transform from a central, hierarchical\nsupply chain to a decentralized, smart,\
    \ and optimized system. In this paper, we review the role of IoT\nin the energy\
    \ sector in general, and in the context of smart grids particularly.\nEnergies\
    \ 2020, 13, 494\n20 of 27\nWe classify different use cases of IoT in each section\
    \ of the energy supply chain, from generation\nthrough energy grids to end use\
    \ sectors. The advantages of IoT-based energy management systems\nin increasing\
    \ energy efﬁciency and integrating renewable energy are discussed and the ﬁndings\
    \ are\nsummarized. We discuss different components of an IoT system, including\
    \ enabling communication\nand sensor technologies with respect to their application\
    \ in the energy sector, for example, sensors\nof temperature, humidity, light,\
    \ speed, passive infrared, and proximity. We discuss cloud computing\nand data\
    \ analytic platforms, which are data analysis and visualization tools that can\
    \ be employed for\ndifferent smart applications in the energy sector, from buildings\
    \ to smart cities.\nWe review the application of IoT in the energy supply chain\
    \ under different levels, including\nsmart cities, smart grids, smart buildings,\
    \ and intelligent transportation. We discuss some of the\nchallenges of applying\
    \ IoT in the energy sector, including challenge of identifying objects, big data\n\
    management, connectivity issues and uncertainty, integration of subsystems, security\
    \ and privacy,\nenergy requirements of IoT systems, standardization, and architectural\
    \ design. We highlight some\nsolutions for these challenges, i.e., Blockchain\
    \ and green IoT as future directions of research.\nAuthor Contributions: N.H.M.\

  title: Internet of Things (IoT) and the Energy Sector
  verbatim_quote1: The Internet of Things (IoT) is a rapidly growing technology with
    the potential to revolutionize many industries, including agriculture. In the
    ﬁeld of irrigation management, IoT-based systems can provide real-time data collection,
    remote monitoring and control, and decision support, leading to improved water
    efﬁciency, reduced labor costs, and optimized crop yield. This paper presents
    a systematic review of IoT applications in irrigation management, covering a wide
    range of topics from sensor technologies to data analytics. The paper also discusses
    the challenges and future research directions in this ﬁeld.
  verbatim_quote2: IoT-based irrigation systems offer numerous advantages over traditional
    irrigation methods. By leveraging sensors, wireless communication, and data analytics,
    these systems can collect real-time data on soil moisture, crop health, and other
    relevant parameters. This data can then be used to make informed decisions about
    irrigation scheduling and water application, leading to signiﬁcant water savings.
    Additionally, IoT-based systems can provide remote monitoring and control capabilities,
    allowing farmers to manage their irrigation systems from anywhere with an internet
    connection. This can save time and labor costs, and it can also help to ensure
    that crops are receiving the optimal amount of water at all times.
  verbatim_quote3: Despite the many beneﬁts of IoT-based irrigation systems, there
    are also some challenges that need to be addressed. One challenge is the need
    for reliable and secure data communication. IoT systems generate a large amount
    of data, and it is important to ensure that this data is transmitted securely
    and reliably to the cloud or other data storage platforms. Another challenge is
    the need for interoperability between different IoT devices and systems. There
    are many different types of IoT devices and systems available on the market, and
    it is important to ensure that these devices and systems can communicate with
    each other seamlessly. Finally, there is the need for affordable IoT solutions.
    IoT technology can be expensive, and it is important to develop affordable solutions
    that can be adopted by farmers of all sizes.

  analysis: 'The journal article provides an overview of the concept of digital twins
    (DTs) and discusses their potential applications in agriculture. It highlights
    the benefits of DTs in improving agricultural efficiency, optimizing resource
    utilization, and enhancing decision-making processes. The article also addresses
    the challenges and limitations of implementing DTs in agriculture, such as data
    quality, connectivity, and scalability. While it touches on the types of data
    most applicable to irrigation management, it does not provide specific examples
    or technical details on how DTs can be used for this purpose. Therefore, the relevance
    of the article to the specific point of "Types of data most applicable to irrigation
    management and their typical sources" is limited.


    Furthermore, the article does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the current
    state and future potential of DTs in irrigation management systems. It mentions
    that DTs can help farmers monitor soil moisture levels and adjust irrigation schedules
    accordingly, but it does not delve into the specific functionalities and capabilities
    of DTs in this context. Additionally, the article does not provide a critical
    assessment of the research gaps and proposed solutions for seamless integration
    across the automated irrigation management system, which is another key aspect
    of the literature review intention.

    Abstract: Digitalization has impacted agricultural and food production systems,\
    \ and makes applica-\ntion of technologies and advanced data processing techniques\
    \ in agricultural ﬁeld possible. Digital\nfarming aims to use available information\
    \ from agricultural assets to solve several existing challenges\nfor addressing\
    \ food security, climate protection, and resource management. However, the agricultural\n\
    sector is complex, dynamic, and requires sophisticated management systems. The\
    \ digital approaches\nare expected to provide more optimization and further decision-making\
    \ supports. Digital twin in\nagriculture is a virtual representation of a farm\
    \ with great potential for enhancing productivity and\nefﬁciency while declining\
    \ energy usage and losses. This review describes the state-of-the-art of\ndigital\
    \ twin concepts along with different digital technologies and techniques in agricultural\
    \ con-\ntexts. It presents a general framework of digital twins in soil, irrigation,\
    \ robotics, farm machineries,\nand food post-harvest processing in agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld. Data recording, modeling including artiﬁcial\nintelligence, big data,\
    \ simulation, analysis, prediction, and communication aspects (e.g., Internet\n\
    of Things, wireless technologies) of digital twin in agriculture are discussed.\
    \ Digital twin systems\ncan support farmers as a next generation of digitalization\
    \ paradigm by continuous and real-time\nmonitoring of physical world (farm) and\
    \ updating the state of virtual world.\nKeywords: digital twin; digitalization;\
    \ digital farming; farm management; smart farming\n1. Introduction\nOne of the\
    \ main global challenges is how to ensure food security for the world’s\ngrowing\
    \ population whilst ensuring long-term sustainable development. According to the\n\
    Food and Agriculture Organization, agricultural and food productions will need\
    \ to grow\nto feed the world population, which will reach around 10 billion by\
    \ 2050 [1]. Due to the\nincrease in world population and market demand for higher\
    \ product quantity and quality\nstandards, the issue of food security, sustainability,\
    \ productivity, and proﬁtability becomes\nmore important. Furthermore, the economic\
    \ pressure on the agricultural sector, labor,\nenvironmental, and climate change\
    \ issues are increasing [2,3]. Therefore, the enhancement\nof efﬁciency through\
    \ effective integrated smart technologies and techniques has been\nwidely considered\
    \ in recent years.\nIn this context, digital agriculture (also known as smart\
    \ farming or smart agriculture)\ntools can support the deeper understanding of\
    \ interrelations within the agricultural pro-\nduction system and the consequent\
    \ effects on the performance of farm production while\nbalancing human health\
    \ and well-being, social and environmental aspects, and sustain-\nability associated\
    \ with agricultural system [4–6]. Due to advances in data generation, data\nprocessing\
    \ and human-computer interactions, digital farming has progressed in recent\n\
    years [7]. One of the main features of digitalization in agriculture is the introduction\
    \ of inno-\nvative Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Internet of\
    \ Things (IoT), big data\nanalytics and interpretation techniques, machine learning\
    \ and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI).\nData acquisition and analysis in digital farming\
    \ by means of smart technologies are\nsupporting complex decision-making approaches\
    \ [8,9]. They enhance ﬁnal productivity,\nSensors 2022, 22, 498. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22020498\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n2 of 16\nreduce costs,\
    \ and optimize the decision-making process. Furthermore, ICT tools present\nadvantages\
    \ for on-farm management, efﬁciency, quality control, and the food supply chain\n\
    as well as decision support tools [10]. The AI and big data support better and\
    \ precise\nfarm monitoring, data acquisition and analytics, improve information\
    \ extraction from\nsensors as well as farm management [11]. For instance, crop\
    \ health and productivity can\nbe monitored and controlled using advanced AI and\
    \ deep learning techniques [12]. Data-\ndriven approaches augment on-farm decision-making\
    \ capabilities, improve crop yield,\nreduce losses, and therefore, beneﬁt farmers.\
    \ The IoT and wireless technologies enable\nreal-time data transferring and monitoring\
    \ in digital farming [13,14]. The IoT, along with\ncloud computing systems, can\
    \ facilitate communication between software platforms and\nsensors, pieces of\
    \ machinery, crops, and animals in digital farming. However, by increasing\nthe\
    \ number of sensors and generating large amounts of data in digital farming could\
    \ cause\nhigh load on the cloud server and reduce the response speed [15]. In\
    \ this context, in may\nbe impractical to always store and process data in the\
    \ cloud systems [16]. An alternative\ntechnology which has been recently introduced\
    \ to the smart farming is edge-computing\nthat enables computation at the edge\
    \ of the network [17]. It helps to reduce network load\nand supports real-time\
    \ data processing in agricultural ﬁelds. Furthermore, cyber-physical\nsystems\
    \ have been introduced through smart farming systems to develop hardware and\n\
    software, improve adaptability, and safety and security of computer-based algorithms\n\
    and systems [18]. It enables adaptability, practicality, security, and safety\
    \ of collected\ninformation in agricultural ﬁeld e.g., climate, irrigation, soil,\
    \ nutrition, and yield for\nbetter management.\nAccording to ref. [19], digital\
    \ farming approaches can provide farmers with useful\ninformation about (I) the\
    \ use of fertilizers, chemicals, seeds, and irrigation management\nstrategies,\
    \ (II) the environment protection, (III) pest, climate, and crop monitoring man-\n\
    agement solutions, (IV) market demands and business conditions. However, agricultural\n\
    production systems are complex, dynamic, and require sophisticated management\
    \ [20].\nDigitalization approaches are expected to provide more monitoring, data\
    \ analysis and\noptimization capabilities, and further decision-making supports.\n\
    To enhance the efﬁciency of these systems, an emerging paradigm has been proposed\n\
    and implemented in digital agriculture, that is, digital twin. The digital twin\
    \ was ﬁrstly\npresented by NASA for monitoring of spacecraft behavior and can\
    \ be deﬁned as a virtual\nor digital representation of physical systems to simulate\
    \ the behavior of the physical\nsystem [21,22]. There are different deﬁnitions\
    \ for digital twin available in the literature\nwhich have been reviewed by [23–25].\
    \ Based on the reported deﬁnitions, the component\nof digital twin can be characterized\
    \ by physical and virtual objects, as well as a set of\nconnections between physical\
    \ and digital assets [26].\nThe physical system or physical world in agriculture\
    \ is a complex and dynamic\nenvironment and includes basic information and features\
    \ of the object or device such\nas shape, position, cooler, material, and live\
    \ objects [27]. The physical system is one\nof the key components, and a digital\
    \ twin without a physical world is a model [28],\nand system boundaries of a digital\
    \ twin are identiﬁed based on the real physical world [29].\nThe physical system\
    \ can be a single component of an object or the whole object with sub-\ncomponents\
    \ located in a physical environment [28]. The physical world in agriculture can\n\
    be an animal itself or located in a farm including building, feeding strategies,\
    \ number of\nanimals [30], or a crop with different soil, climate, and irrigation\
    \ conditions [22], robots\nand agricultural pieces of machinery, e.g., tractors,\
    \ harvesters and fertilizers, as well as\noperators. The physical world can include\
    \ a whole object (e.g., whole machine) or sub-part\nof the object, or a single\
    \ asset of the object connected with other objects. In an agricultural\ncontext,\
    \ the physical system may be some aspects of the crop, soil, and irrigation systems,\n\
    or animal body. The physical world requires measurement technologies and sensors\
    \ to\ncollect and receive data from the physical object. Examples of digital twins\
    \ in smart\nagriculture include optical sensors for plant canopy and disease [31,32],\
    \ soil and weather\nsensors for crop [33], barn sensors such as temperature, humidity,\
    \ ammonia for animals [34],\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n3 of 16\nGlobal Positioning\
    \ System (GPS) and Real-Time Kinematic-Global Navigation Satellite for\ntracking\
    \ of agricultural robots [35], and food supply chain.\nThe connection between\
    \ physical and virtual worlds depends on the developed digital\ntwin. This component\
    \ enables data transmission between virtual and physical systems.\nIt interprets\
    \ the collected data from the physical system and updates the state of the\nvirtual\
    \ system, and transfers feedbacks from the virtual system to the physical world\
    \ [25].\nThe connection components can be varied depending on the source, type\
    \ and volume of\ndata, data transfer rate and speed, as well as the minimum delay\
    \ between data acquisition\nand feedbacks. Wireless and IoT techniques have been\
    \ used in digital twins of agricultural\nconcepts to connect between physical\
    \ and virtual worlds (such as [34,36,37]).\nThe models and data of the physical\
    \ world are represented in a virtual system.\nThe virtual world may also include\
    \ different processing and simulation concepts, software,\nmachine learning, data\
    \ mining, and AI models. In this context, data processing and analyt-\nics by\
    \ means of AI techniques to support decision-making and feedback to the physical\n\
    system were suggested by some researchers [38,39]. The virtual twin may simulate\
    \ and\ncontrol the physical system, optimize a process, and predict unseen issues\
    \ in the physical\nsystem. For example, an application layer of a digital twin\
    \ reported by [22] provides\nreal-time monitoring of weeds, crop growth, and expected\

    \ and evaluation of soil quality to sustain plant productivity is the basis of\n\
    land-use strategies in agricultural farms [48]. Crop health and productivity depends\
    \ on\nthe quality and properties of the soil. More detailed information about\
    \ the agricultural\nsoil may reduce the potential use of chemical fertilizer and\
    \ pesticide dosages, therefore\nimproving the underground water, protecting the\
    \ environment and human health. It also\nsupports deﬁning plant density in a more\
    \ efﬁcient way. Digital technologies are supporting\nscientists to better understand\
    \ and study soil in agriculture. Soil monitoring sensors such\nas moisture, temperature,\
    \ organic matter, and soil pollutant sensors are playing critical\nroles in digital\
    \ agriculture [49]. For instance, soil moisture information can be used to\nassess\
    \ irrigation efﬁciency in agricultural ﬁelds [50]. Furthermore, to support the\
    \ decision-\nmaking process of smart farming, digital soil mapping is an essential\
    \ paradigm that can be\ndeﬁned as spatial soil information based on ﬁeld and laboratory\
    \ investigations coupled\nwith soil inference systems [51]. Digital soil assessment\
    \ approaches have a direct impact on\ncrop yield and performance by identifying\
    \ zones that may cause low crop yield. Digital\nalternative methodologies for\
    \ soil survey and identifying key soil characteristics could\nhave the possibility\
    \ to quantify the trend of agricultural soil conditions [52].\nThe advancement\
    \ of knowledge and technology (e.g., wireless sensors, IoT, AI) in\ndigital agriculture\
    \ could lead to digital twin paradigms of soil in agriculture. The recent\ndevelopment\
    \ of digital soil mapping techniques may support digital twins by digital\nrepresentation\
    \ of knowledge obtained from the soil in virtual entrainment [53]. For in-\nstance,\
    \ digital soil mapping could be used to describe soil variation in digital twins\
    \ using\ninformation from complex soil variation at a speciﬁc depth, time, and\
    \ special locations [52].\nAdditionally, the decision about crop management depends\
    \ directly on the crop water\nrequirements, soil properties, and availability\
    \ of water. In order to manage soil and crop\nrequirements in smart farming, digital\
    \ technologies have been used to meet the requirement\nof smart or precise water\
    \ management strategies. Wireless system networks, IoT, edge-\ncomputing, local\
    \ weather-based controllers, and soil sensors are some of the digital tools\n\
    based on smart irrigation systems. The mentioned tools can be used in the digital\
    \ twin of\nsoil and irrigation systems. For example, ref. [37] developed a digital\
    \ twin concept for smart\nwater management in the agricultural domain. Information\
    \ of air and ground temperature,\nand humidity sensors, soil moisture, and ambient\
    \ light as well as geospatial position\nsensors were collected. An IoT system\
    \ was used to connect the cloud and the physical\nsystem. A virtual environment\
    \ including decision-making tools and models was designed\nto inform the data\
    \ collected by connection device (the IoT system) and to send feedback\nto the\
    \ physical system. They also presented a digital twin system architecture including\n\
    monitoring devices (i.e., soil probe, weather information, irrigation system,\
    \ machines,\nand other equipment) in a physical system (farm) with could serve\
    \ as a connection between\nthe physical and virtual systems to visualize satellite\
    \ and drone images.\nIn another study, to evaluate and forecast plants’ irrigation\
    \ requirements, and support\nirrigation and water distribution planning, a digital\
    \ twin for a smart water management\nsystem was developed by [54]. Data of the\
    \ physical world (agriculture ﬁeld) such as\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n5 of 16\n\
    weather, fertilizer, and soil type as well as information from developed models\
    \ that simulate\nthe behavior of soil and crops were considered as input data\
    \ for the digital twin. The digital\ntwin concept also consisted of a Soil Agent\
    \ (includes hydrological models and soil data),\nCrop Agent (includes crop models\
    \ and evaporation data), and a Field Avatar, which is a\ndigital representation\
    \ of the ﬁeld such as geological models and weather data [54]. In their\ndeveloped\
    \ digital twin concept, the information from Soil Avatar and Crop Avatar feed\n\
    into the Field Avatar, and an IoT system was used for data transformation and\
    \ connection\nbetween the physical and virtual worlds.\nDue to increase in world\
    \ population, water and energy management, storage, and proper\ndistribution of\
    \ water become more essential for water users in agricultural sectors, which can\n\
    be managed through a collective irrigation system [55]. A digital twin of water\
    \ systems\ncoupled with big data can reduce risk and uncertainty of water management,\
    \ explore\nconsumption patterns, and optimize operation planning [56]. Furthermore,\
    \ in a collective\nirrigation system, improvement of water efﬁciency could help\
    \ to reduce water losses. In this\ncontext, a digital twin concept was created\
    \ using ﬁeld and laboratory tests of a collective\nirrigation system network to\
    \ evaluate energy, pumping facilities, water losses and water use\nefﬁciencies\
    \ [57]. The developed digital twin methodology was based on information from\n\
    the physical system, i.e., infrastructure data, acquired information through telemetry,\
    \ data\nanalytics from laboratory tests and ﬁeld measurements, IoT data transferring\
    \ as connection,\nenergy balance, water balance, and hydraulic model in the virtual\
    \ system. It was found\nthat the digital twin of the irrigation management system\
    \ made it possible to understand\nsystem processes, maintenance, and management\
    \ strategies [57].\nA digital twin of soil and irrigation systems in smart farming\
    \ enables digital repre-\nsentation of information from agricultural soil, and\
    \ provides prediction and fundamental\nunderstanding of water requirement and\
    \ soil components for crop farming. Exchanging\ninformation from the soil as a\
    \ physical system to a virtual system using IoT, cloud, fog,\nand edge-computing\
    \ technologies in digital twin may allow evaluating the state of soil and\nirrigation\
    \ systems. In particular, the edge-computing technique that saves and performs\n\
    the data processing near the soil monitoring and irrigation devices can improve\
    \ the perfor-\nmance and overcome issues of cloud-based system in digital twin\
    \ concepts. Furthermore,\nit could offer different irrigation recommendations\
    \ based on crop requirements which are\nnot solved yet by the researchers.\n3.\
    \ Digital Twin in Crop Production\nThe use of digital and ICT tools in crop production\
    \ technologies, in particular agri-\ncultural machineries, e.g., tractors, combine\
    \ harvesters, fertilizers, and sprayers, plays an\nimportant role in the improvement\
    \ of overall efﬁciency by reducing the cost of fuel, fertiliz-\ners, human labor,\
    \ and parameters which affect production efﬁciency and sustainability [58].\n\
    Digitalization has modernized agricultural machinery application and management\
    \ policies\nusing collected information and advanced data analytics approaches.\
    \ It allows to optimize\nthe performance and enhance the use of advanced tools\
    \ in manufacturing. For instance,\nbased on the European Agricultural Machinery\
    \ Association, a digital farm machine should\nbe able to assist and support drivers\
    \ by sending and receiving data via sensors and ICT\ntools, enable the best and\
    \ optimal use of machinery, and the technology should facilitate\nthe automated\
    \ operation of the devices [59]. The application of AI, big data analytics,\n\
    and wireless and IoT technologies have led to signiﬁcant changes in farm technology\
    \ roles\ntowards the development of autonomous systems. The role of agricultural\
    \ machinery in\nthe implementation of digital agriculture was stated by [58] as\
    \ data collected from sensors\nmounted on typical and autonomous agricultural\
    \ machinery and transferred via an IoT\nplatform. Then, the information was analyzed\
    \ by data analytics such as AI, fuzzy logic,\nand big data analysis to support\
    \ farmers, consumers, and markets [58]. In this context,\ncombining digital tools\
    \ with autonomous machines and robots could help farmers to do\nmore effective\
    \ practices and improve the quality of products [60]. Nowadays, with ad-\nvancements\
    \ in digital technology, the real-time visualization of smart farm equipment\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 498\n6 of 16\nconditions is possible through digital twin approaches\
    \ [40]. It allows contact to the system\n(e.g., machinery and robots), simulates\
    \ the condition of the system, and monitors the\nbehavior and operation as well\
    \ as the maintenance situation of the machines (Figure 2).\n \ntransferred via\
    \ an IoT platform. Then, the information was analyzed by data analytics \nsuch\
    \ as AI, fuzzy logic, and big data analysis to support farmers, consumers, and\
    \ markets \n[58]. In this context, combining digital tools with autonomous machines\
    \ and robots could \nhelp farmers to do more effective practices and improve the\
    \ quality of products [60]. Now-\nadays, with advancements in digital technology,\
    \ the real-time visualization of smart farm \nequipment conditions is possible\
    \ through digital twin approaches [40]. It allows contact \nto the system (e.g.,\
    \ machinery and robots), simulates the condition of the system, and \nmonitors\
    \ the behavior and operation as well as the maintenance situation of the machines\
    \ \n(Figure 2).  \n \nFigure 2. An architecture of the digital twin concept for\
    \ crop production technology. \nDigital twin in design and manufacturing of products\
    \ (e.g., farm machinery) requires \n(I) geometric (e.g., size, shape) and physical\
    \ properties of an object, (II) in the detailed \ninformation of the product which\
    \ can illustrate dynamic processing of the object, (III) in-\ntegration of geometric,\
    \ physical, and process information [61]. Digital twin approaches \nmake it possible\
    \ to model, design, simulate, and develop agricultural machinery that \nwould\
    \ yield more productive machines in terms of energy and power efficiencies. For\
    \ \ninstance, it was shown that overall energy consumption of machinery could\
    \ be modeled \nin digital twin concepts, and the effect of different factors on\
    \ energy consumption can also \nbe explored there [62]. In the agricultural context,\
    \ ref. [40] reported that a commercially \navailable digital twin platform for\
    \ agricultural machinery is able to track the machines in \nreal-time, monitor\
    \ the energy consumption, economic efficiency of crop management, and \ntrajectories\
    \ of tractors by considering the specific conditions of the farm. It has also\
    \ been \nreported that using digital twins could potentially impact the training\
    \ of unskilled har-\nvester operators and lead to high macro-economic benefits\
    \ [63].  \nWithin the digital farming technologies, robotics, as an important\
    \ technology in crop \nproduction, has played an essential role in digitalization\
    \ and has been drawing more at-\ntention in recent years. To optimize the robotic\
    \ application process, reduce costs, and in-\ncrease the quality and efficiency\
    \ of the product, the digital twin concepts can be used for \nvirtualization of\
    \ the robot environment by introducing a remote operating system [64]. By \nproviding\
    \ simulation and remote operation possibilities and modeling various interac-\n\
    tions between robot and environment in digital twin concepts, accuracy, performance,\
    \ \nand flexibility may enhance, and the final product cost may decline. Ref.\
    \ [65] analyzed the \nhuman-robot interactive behaviors using a digital twin platform.\
    \ Their developed digital \ntwin helps to improve operational productivity and\
    \ comfort. In another study, a digital \nFigure 2. An architecture of the digital\
    \ twin concept for crop production technology.\nDigital twin in design and manufacturing\
    \ of products (e.g., farm machinery) re-\nquires (I) geometric (e.g., size, shape)\
    \ and physical properties of an object, (II) in the\ndetailed information of the\
    \ product which can illustrate dynamic processing of the object,\n(III) integration\
    \ of geometric, physical, and process information [61]. Digital twin ap-\nproaches\
    \ make it possible to model, design, simulate, and develop agricultural machinery\n\
    that would yield more productive machines in terms of energy and power efﬁciencies.\n\
    For instance, it was shown that overall energy consumption of machinery could\
    \ be mod-\neled in digital twin concepts, and the effect of different factors\
    \ on energy consumption can\nalso be explored there [62]. In the agricultural\
    \ context, ref. [40] reported that a commercially\navailable digital twin platform\
    \ for agricultural machinery is able to track the machines\nin real-time, monitor\
    \ the energy consumption, economic efﬁciency of crop management,\nand trajectories\
    \ of tractors by considering the speciﬁc conditions of the farm. It has also\n\
    been reported that using digital twins could potentially impact the training of\
    \ unskilled\nharvester operators and lead to high macro-economic beneﬁts [63].\n\
    Within the digital farming technologies, robotics, as an important technology\
    \ in crop\nproduction, has played an essential role in digitalization and has\
    \ been drawing more\nattention in recent years. To optimize the robotic application\
    \ process, reduce costs, and in-\ncrease the quality and efﬁciency of the product,\
    \ the digital twin concepts can be used for\nvirtualization of the robot environment\
    \ by introducing a remote operating system [64].\nBy providing simulation and\
    \ remote operation possibilities and modeling various inter-\nactions between\
    \ robot and environment in digital twin concepts, accuracy, performance,\nand\
    \ ﬂexibility may enhance, and the ﬁnal product cost may decline. Ref. [65] analyzed\n\
    the human-robot interactive behaviors using a digital twin platform. Their developed\n\
    digital twin helps to improve operational productivity and comfort. In another\
    \ study,\na digital twin approach was proposed to assist the remote programming\
    \ of a robot [66].\nThe developed digital twin system consists of a robot (as\
    \ a physical object), and a gaming\nplatform (as a virtual system) which was able\
    \ to observe the motion of the robot, ease\nprogramming for complex environments\
    \ as well as introduce a remote operating system\nfor communication across different\
    \ platforms [66]. In the agricultural context, an approach\nwas recommended by\
    \ [35] that the development of a digital twin paradigm for agricultural\nrobots\
    \ may improve predictive emulation of the vehicles, operational scheduling, digital-\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 498\n7 of 16\nization, economic, environmental, and social sustainability\
    \ in agriculture. Furthermore,\nthe digital twin paradigm makes it possible to\
    \ overcome common challenges in the control\nof robot components in the agriculture\
    \ ﬁeld. In this context, a research group demonstrated\nthe possibility of a digital\
    \ twin concept for a desktop version of an agricultural robot [67] to\ncontrol\
    \ the motor and indoor localization capabilities of the robot. Besides, the digital\
    \ twin\nconcept was used to predict movement and monitor the safety mechanism\
    \ of the robot [67].\nHowever, their developed digital twin concept needs different\
    \ kinds of calibrations to be\napplicable in different environmental conditions.\n\
    In another study, to simulate complexity of the crop production process, variability\
    \ of\nplant, soil, environment, and technologies in the agricultural ﬁeld, digital\
    \ twin concepts\nwere developed [68]. Three ﬁeld robots for different agricultural\
    \ applications were used to\ndevelop different digital twin concepts and optimize\
    \ sensor-based autonomous navigation.\nIt is reported that the developed concepts\
    \ could provide considerable information in prepar-\ning ﬁeld experiments, and\
    \ better evaluation for the use and positioning of sensor systems\ntowards demonstrating\
    \ and implementation of the developed robotic technologies [68].\nIntegration\
    \ of the digital twin systems with technologies and management strategies\nin\
    \ crop production can provide a new phenomenon for digitalization in agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld.\nManagement strategies can be improved and optimized by providing reliable\
    \ forecasts of\nthe key parameters in digital twins [69]. The digital twin systems\
    \ can not only act as a man-\nagement system, but it may also be used to revolutionize\
    \ agricultural farm management\nstrategies [40]. For instance, a digital twin\
    \ concept was applied in a greenhouse to discover,\nanalyze, and extract behavior\
    \ of farmers [70]. Sensor data were analyzed using deep learn-\ning techniques\
    \ to establish decision-making models to replicate expert famers’ experience\n\
    for transferring to young farmers. It was found that the developed digital twin\
    \ module\ncould improve control and management strategies in crop farming [70].\
    \ In this context,\nthe use of distributed architecture in digital twin may increase\
    \ efﬁciency and reliability\nof the module by proper resource handling [71]. A\
    \ distributed digital twin concept was\ndeveloped to handle resources over different\
    \ stakeholders and platforms in agricultural\nlandscape [72]. It consists of different\
    \ components, i.e., stakeholders, applications in agri-\nculture and farm management,\
    \ sensor data, analytics and simulation tools, virtual model,\nIoT, and resource\
    \ registry which makes interoperable and cross-scale management possible\nin agricultural\
    \ landscape [71].\nIn addition, the use of digital twin system as a decision support\
    \ system can beneﬁt and\nbe adopted for crop farming applications, and optimization\
    \ of products and farm system\nperformance. A digital twin model was implemented\
    \ by [36] in sustainable agriculture\nfor monitoring and control of product qualities,\
    \ adjustment of environmental conditions,\nidentiﬁcation of forecasting, and decision\
    \ support scenarios. In addition, a novel approach\nbased on digital twin paradigms\
    \ was developed to forecast yield, vegetation quality,\nand duration of plant\
    \ development [33]. Consequently, the quality of crop production\ncould be improved\
    \ due to detailed analysis and control of plant growth, and the efﬁciency\nof\
    \ farms could be improved due to automation of decision support processes through\n\
    the developed digital twin concept. Digital twin along with forecasting models\
    \ were able\nto provide feedback to farmers for a better decision-making scenario\
    \ in a reported study\nby [73]. Their proposed digital twin system consists of\
    \ a monitoring system to collect\nenvironmental condition data from an underground\
    \ farm, as well as data analysis and\nmodeling techniques to identify key parameters,\
    \ critical trends, and forecast operational\nscenarios. Furthermore, digital twin\
    \ was able to optimize productivity of crops in a\ngreenhouse environment through\
    \ climate control strategies and treatments related to\ncrop management [74].\n\
    Information from crop production machineries (e.g., tractors, harvesters, robots)\
    \ have\nbeen used in smart farming to optimize the performance and efﬁciency,\
    \ and reduce the fuel\nand energy consumption. However, the digital twin concepts\
    \ collect real-time data from\nthe devices and characterize the states of the\
    \ physical object continuously. This capability\nmakes it possible to predict\
    \ and prescribe solutions using the collected information from\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 498\n8 of 16\nthe farm machineries. Hence, big data analytics coupled with\
    \ AI models are able to detect\nfailures in the machines before or in the early\
    \ stage of when breakdowns happen. In this\ncontext, the use of state-of-the-art\
    \ edge-computing systems may reduce latency by the\nlimited amount of transmitted\
    \ data and provide information from the crop production\nmachineries such as autonomous\
    \ robot, harvesters, and tractors to the digital twin concepts.\nThe digital twin\
    \ paradigm in crop farming can change production productivity, farm man-\nagement,\
    \ and sustainability at farm level. Advanced statistical models, machine learning\n\
    and data analytic approaches can provide farmers with more precise information\
    \ to make\nbetter decisions that were not possible previously. Based on the past\
    \ (historical) and current\ncontinuous knowledge from crop (sensors deployed at\
    \ farm) and environment data, the dig-\nital twin systems provide information\
    \ about future states of the farm, and offer solutions\nfor turning the collected\
    \ information into useful and actionable on-farm knowledge.\n4. Digital Twin in\
    \ Post-Harvest Process\nPost-harvest process is a stage of agricultural products\
    \ after harvesting until consum-\ning the products, which may include transportation,\
    \ drying, cooling, storage, and market-\ning. Through digital farming approaches,\
    \ the post-harvest processes could beneﬁt from loss\nreduction, improvement of\
    \ monitoring and optimization of food processing, storage condi-\ntions, marketing,\
    \ and transportation. Digital solutions allow monitoring real-time agri-food\n\
    supply chain to increase robustness and resilience of the chain [75], and lower\
    \ food waste\nand losses. The IoT platform supports the reduction of food losses\
    \ in post-harvest pro-\ncessing [76], and tracking of the product through the\
    \ food supply chain. To achieve food\nsecurity AI and big data analytics enable\
    \ data processing, optimization, and management\nin food and crop post-harvest\
    \ stages [77], also reducing waste and improving overall prof-\nitability [78].\
    \ The ICT offers solutions to monitor and control quality criteria of food and\n\
    agricultural products during post-harvest processing [43]. However, different\
    \ environmen-\ntal conditions, processing factors, and dynamic features of agricultural\
    \ product (e.g., shape,\nsize), environmental parameters (e.g., temperature, humidity),\
    \ handling, transportation,\nand storage of the products inﬂuence the quality\
    \ of post-harvest process [79].\nTo overcome these issues and increase the efﬁciency\
    \ of the system, digital twin ap-\nproaches have been used in post-harvest processing\
    \ to continuously monitor the products\nand update the processing stages [80].\
    \ Digital twins, as an expanding family of digital\nfarming could strengthen agri-food\
    \ systems, affect knowledge and skills of farm manage-\nment [44]. Digital twin\
    \ in post-harvest processes can be deﬁned as a digital representation\nof harvested\
    \ agricultural products based on the information collected from the products.\n\
    In this context, ref. [42] reported the digital twin concept of food processing\
    \ may include:\n(I) data collected from a physical system (food process operation)\
    \ by means of sensors that\nmeasure properties and variables of products and environmental\
    \ parameters, (II) an IoT\nplatform to provide sensor communication, data storage\
    \ and big data analytics, high-\nperformance computing, and link to the digital\
    \ twin assets, (III) a simulation platform that\nuses input data from physical\
    \ system for optimization, testing and validation of models,\nand provides decision\
    \ supports in the virtual world. In order to beneﬁt food process-\ning by developing\
    \ digital twin models, it is important to include accurate information\nrepresenting\
    \ production processes of the product, e.g., equipment, labor, and to create\n\
    realistic models with all existing boundaries and barriers [81]. In a study reported\
    \ by [82],\na digital twin of mango fruit was developed to simulate and qualify\
    \ thermal and associ-\nated bio-chemical behavior of the fruit through a post-harvest\
    \ supply chain. In order to\ndevelop the digital twin concept, environmental air\
    \ temperature as input was considered,\nand the actual supply chain conditions\
    \ were mimicked within mechanistic ﬁnite element\nmodels [82]. Moreover, the impact\
    \ of higher air speed on storage life, cold chain length,\nand delivery air temperature\
    \ on the fruit quality were considered in the digital twin. It was\nreported that\
    \ the digital twin allows to monitor and predict temperature-dependent fruit\n\
    quality losses, improve refrigeration and logistic processes, consequently, it\
    \ can reduce\nfood losses [82]. Furthermore, it is reported that the digital twin\
    \ can help horticultural\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n9 of 16\nproducts along with\
    \ the post-harvest life, and can be used to forecast the shelf-life of\nagricultural\
    \ products through the cold chain [45]. It can support food consumers as well\n\
    as food business owners for tracking of the products, logistics, and marketing\
    \ decisions;\nhowever, the existing digital twin concept needs to be enhanced\
    \ by considering more bio-\nchemical and physical features [45]. Ref. [83] proposed\
    \ a digital twin concept food supply\nchain analysis. Their developed digital\
    \ twin includes: (I) a network based on knowledge\nfrom, e.g., customers, suppliers,\
    \ and factories, (II) some parameters, e.g., in production,\ntransportation, warehouses,\
    \ sourcing, shipment costs, and policies, (III) various operational\nparameters,\
    \ e.g., demand, quality, target inventory, and vehicle capacity. It was found\n\
    that the developed digital twin can be used for optimization, simulation, and\
    \ analysis of\noperation and performance changes in the food supply chain [83].\n\
    According to [43], digital twin in post-harvest can be considered as mechanistic,\n\
    statistical, and intelligent models; however, it was found that the physics-based\
    \ mechanistic\ndigital twin concepts can evaluate the quality of fresh agricultural\
    \ products better than\nthe others. Physics-based digital twins were developed\
    \ on 331 cold chain shipments of\nfour fruits (i.e., cucumber, eggplant, strawberry,\
    \ raspberry) by [84]. Based on digital twin\nconcepts, it was found that the quality\
    \ of fruits may be affected (around 43–85%) before\nbeing delivered to stores.\n\
    The post-harvest processing has improved through the application of digital solutions\n\
    over the last several years. However, the use of the digital twin paradigm is\
    \ receiving more\nattention in post-harvest food processing due to the future\
    \ product quality prediction and\ncost reduction. The digital twin of post-harvest\
    \ processes may be developed to model,\noptimize, represent, and characterize\
    \ the design and operational parameters such as quality,\nsafety, ingredients,\
    \ shelf-life, and product status, which need to be considered by researchers\n\
    in future studies.\n5. Challenges and Future Needs\nSummary of the digital twin\
    \ concepts developed in the literature for different purposes\nin agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds, including soil, irrigation, crop monitoring, robotics, farm machinery,\n\
    and post-harvest processing, is presented in Tables 2–4. These tables show that\
    \ the digital\ntwin paradigm is in the early stage of research and development\
    \ in the agricultural context,\nand future studies in terms of knowledge, technological,\
    \ system development, and application\naspects of digital twin concepts in different\

    \ the agricultural\nsoil by considering the soil quality and properties may accommodate\
    \ plant productivity,\nhealth, and yield, save water, and reduce chemical usage.\
    \ Many elements of the soil,\nirrigation, and environmental parameters in agricultural\
    \ land can be continuously mon-\nitored, analyzed, and their management strategies\
    \ optimized using big data analytics,\nmachine learning models, and decision support\
    \ systems embedded in the digital twin\nconcepts. The combination of soil and\
    \ irrigation digital twin approaches to record, monitor,\nand analyze agricultural\
    \ land changes may lead to improved performance of crop farming.\nFor instance,\
    \ simulation of soil structure along with data-driven updating models could\n\
    connect farmers to the farm using the IoT technology and present, in detail, pictures\
    \ of\nparameters that impact the soil, irrigation, and crop yield. However, few\
    \ studies focus on\nthe development of digital twin concepts of agriculture soil\
    \ with higher degree of ﬂexibility\nas well as considering a wider range of operation\
    \ than existing simulation models. Soil\nsensors could constantly measure and\
    \ record the dynamic condition of arable soil, e.g.,\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n\
    11 of 16\nwater holding capacity, moisture, temperature [53]. These data, along\
    \ with information\nfrom soil structure and simulation techniques, can be transferred\
    \ to digital twin concepts,\nand constant feedback from the digital world may\
    \ advise real-time responses for soil and\nwater management as well as control\
    \ systems. In recent years, there has been rapid growth\nin the digital farming\
    \ scenarios, use of remote sensing, digital soil mapping, and develop-\nment of\
    \ software platforms. However, researches needed to fuse the developed techniques\n\
    along with the IoT, edge-computing, AI, data analytics, and simulation techniques\
    \ that\ncould lead to development of a digital twin paradigm is in an early stage\
    \ and needs to\nbe addressed in future studies. Furthermore, researchers need\
    \ to consider the practical\nchallenges of digital twin-based systems in soil\
    \ and irrigation as digital twins are multi-\nand interdisciplinary techniques\
    \ and require systems engineering perspectives [90].\nDigital twin offers real-time\
    \ simulation of farm machinery and robots that can beneﬁt\noptimal design of the\
    \ products, interaction with the environment, energy usage, and main-\ntenance\
    \ strategies. Digital twin concepts have the possibility to predict failures in\
    \ farm\nmachinery and support decision-making scenarios in plant production. Farm\
    \ owners can\nbe able to connect to the machines through virtual world for monitoring\
    \ and tracking of the\ndevices in agricultural farms. Digital twin systems are\
    \ accompanied by recording a large\namount of data and exchanging information\
    \ between different assets; hence compiling\nand analyzing these data is a challenge\
    \ facing farms, particularly in some rural areas with\npoor internet and technological\
    \ infrastructures [91]. Other alternatives, e.g., Long Range\ntechnology based\
    \ on wireless sensor networks communication and edge-computing could\nbe used\
    \ to mitigate internet access problems in rural areas for the connection part\
    \ of the\ndigital twin concepts [32,92]. Future opportunities for the implementation\
    \ of digital twin\nsystems in crop farm technologies could lie in the development\
    \ of standards as well as data\ntransferring and communication strategies in this\
    \ context.\nThe digital twin of crop production using big data collected from\
    \ crop and farm ma-\nchinery as well as robots, analytical and AI models, IoT,\
    \ and satellite and drone information\ncould allow simulating crop, environmental,\
    \ and farm conditions in the digital world to\ndetermine unknown and unseen issues\
    \ before happening in the physical world. Agricul-\ntural objects (crops in particular)\
    \ need frequent updates in data to support information\nanalysis and decision-making\
    \ processes [93] which in turn can promote sustainable farming\npractices and\
    \ save energy usage in crop productions. In this context, greater effort should\n\
    be focused in the future on characterization and development of frameworks for\
    \ more effec-\ntive practical digital twin paradigms. In crop farming, all information\
    \ may not be recorded\nand tracked using digital sensors; however, combining data\
    \ from different sources could\nimprove the virtual representation of the farm\
    \ operation and environment [73]. Continuous\nmonitoring of crops in digital twin\
    \ systems by simulating the dynamic farm conditions\nand considering the effect\
    \ of management, climate, and environmental conditions on the\nplant growth and\
    \ use of data-driven models along with sensor fusion techniques could\nhelp to\
    \ identify deviations from the normal conditions of the plant, and forecast growth\n\
    stages to reduce risk of environmental and management effects. In future, different\
    \ digital\ntwin concepts might be applied to copy the complex physical system\
    \ of crop farming in\nthe digital world and incorporate variable sensors, data\
    \ collecting strategies, modeling,\nforecasting, and simulation approaches in\
    \ crop farming.\nIn addition, digital twin concepts can support monitoring, tracking,\
    \ and analysis of\nfood through the entire supply chain. Development of a digital\
    \ copy of an agricultural\nproduct to monitor post-harvest processing could be\
    \ used to optimize the process, reduce\nenergy use, labor, and food losses based\
    \ on information from different sensors and simula-\ntion models. Future studies\
    \ need to be carried out to consider more environmental and\npost-harvest product\
    \ features for the development of robust digital twins [45]. Another\nmajor challenge\
    \ in the development of digital twin for post-harvest processing to minimize\n\
    quality losses and improve the shelf-life of the product is considering the value\
    \ chain of\nagricultural products from farm to fork [43], which has not been addressed\
    \ yet. In post-\nharvest processing to reduce uncertainty in digital twins and\
    \ enable the consumer to trust\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n12 of 16\nthe output of\
    \ digital twin concepts, detailed experimental and data collection approaches\n\
    along with numerical modeling and validation techniques need be considered.\n\
    6. Conclusions\nEmploying digital technology has helped agricultural farm managers\
    \ to improve\nefﬁciency, yield, and reduce losses. There are different types of\
    \ digital farming paradigms\nin the literature that could be used in digital twin\
    \ concepts as the next generation of\ndigitalization in the agricultural ﬁeld.\
    \ The results of this review show that the digital twin\nconcepts in agriculture\
    \ and food processing have, so far, been little exploited in research.\nThere\
    \ are several research challenges and opportunities in different stages of digital\
    \ farming.\nDigital twin paradigms can be meaningfully utilized for soil and irrigation,\
    \ crop, robots and\nfarm machinery, and post-harvest food processing in the agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld. In this context,\nmost of the studies have focused on the development\
    \ of digital twins by considering some\nlimited parameters in agricultural sectors.\
    \ Deploying of state-of-the-art technologies, e.g.,\nAI, advanced statistical\
    \ and optimization models, big data analytics, and three-dimensional\nsimulation,\
    \ offer further possibilities for improvement in farm management. With real-\n\
    time and continuous information about agricultural assets, virtual models can\
    \ predict\nand address unseen issues in the ﬁelds. It may support farmers to decline\
    \ the economic\npressure on the agricultural sector and labor issues, and help\
    \ policy makers responsible for\nfood security and environmental protection, towards\
    \ strengthening the agriculture sector.\nIn addition, it facilitates the work\
    \ of researchers exploring methods to track and monitor\ncrop farm machinery,\
    \ agricultural and post-harvest products or reduce water, chemicals,\nand energy\
    \ usage in digital farming. Although many digital twin systems in engineering,\n\
    manufacturing, and health contexts have been developed, further attempts need\
    \ to be\nconsidered in the agricultural context towards the development of digital\
    \ twin systems\nthat can monitor, record, and analyze data, to predict and prescribe\
    \ the best decision for\ndigital farming management.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    chapter PDF 1 Introduction Agriculture, the cornerstone of human civilization,
    has been on a remarkable journey of transformation throughout history. From the
    earliest days of manual cultivation to the mechanization of the Industrial Revolution,
    farming has consistently evolved to meet the demands of a growing global population.
    In the twenty-first century, a new and pivotal chapter is being written in the
    annals of agriculture, and at the heart of this transformation lies a technological
    marvel—edge computing. The story of agriculture has not been without its challenges.
    Traditional farming practices, deeply rooted in centuries-old traditions, have
    often struggled to keep pace with the complexities of modern society. Challenges
    such as labor-intensive practices, uncertainty in decision-making, environmental
    sustainability, and vulnerability to climate change have tested the resilience
    of the agriculture sector. Traditional farming methods, which relied heavily on
    manual labor and were often guided by historical knowledge, have been challenged
    to keep up with the ever-increasing demands for food production. Farmers faced
    the daunting task of optimizing resource allocation while contending with the
    unpredictability of weather, soil conditions, and pest infestations. The environmental
    consequences of excessive water use, overuse of fertilizers, and pesticide application
    have raised concerns about sustainability. Furthermore, the specter of climate
    change, with its erratic weather patterns and extreme events, has added an element
    of unpredictability to farming, making it increasingly difficult for farmers to
    safeguard their livelihoods. In response to these challenges, the agriculture
    sector has embarked on a technological revolution that is reshaping every facet
    of the industry. This revolution is powered by a convergence of cutting-edge technologies,
    including the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), data analytics,
    and automation. At the heart of this transformation is edge computing—an innovation
    that is redefining the way farming is conducted, known as “smart farming”(Bolan,
    S, et al., 2015). Edge computing is a paradigm shift in the world of technology.
    It brings computational power closer to the data source, allowing real-time data
    processing and decision-making. In the context of agriculture, this means that
    data collected on the farm, whether it be soil moisture [71] levels, crop health
    indicators, or even livestock behavior, can be processed and acted upon immediately,
    without the need for data to travel to distant cloud servers. This immediacy has
    profound implications for farming operations. With the advent of edge computing,
    the agriculture sector has entered a new era—one characterized by data-driven,
    precision agriculture. IoT sensors and devices, strategically placed across farms,
    continuously collect data and transmit it to edge computing devices. These devices,
    equipped with AI and machine learning algorithms (Tiwari, S et al., 2018) [8],
    analyze the data and provide actionable insights to farmers in real-time. The
    implications of this technological leap are far-reaching: Precision Agriculture:
    Edge computing empowers farmers to practice precision agriculture with unparalleled
    accuracy. Every action on the farm, from planting and irrigation to pest control
    and harvesting, is guided by precise data and analysis. This precision minimizes
    resource use, reduces waste, and maximizes crop yields, ultimately leading to
    higher profitability for farmers. Resource Optimization: The ability to process
    data at the edge allows for precise resource allocation. Farmers can make real-time
    decisions on water usage, fertilizer application, and energy consumption. This
    optimization not only reduces operational costs but also contributes to sustainable
    farming practices. Environmental Sustainability: Edge computing plays a pivotal
    role in promoting sustainable agriculture. By optimizing resource use, minimizing
    environmental impact, and reducing the reliance on chemicals, farmers can transition
    to eco-friendly and regenerative farming practices that are beneficial for both
    the environment and consumers. Early Disease Detection: Edge devices equipped
    with AI models are capable of detecting signs of disease or pest infestations
    in crops or livestock at an early stage. This early detection enables farmers
    to take prompt and targeted action, reducing crop losses and the need for chemical
    interventions. Risk Mitigation: The real-time data and predictive analytics made
    possible by edge computing empower farmers to better mitigate risks associated
    with climate change, disease outbreaks, and market fluctuations. This enhanced
    ability to adapt to changing conditions leads to more resilient and sustainable
    farming practices. As we embark on this exploration of the revolution of edge
    computing in smart farming(Rai, P.K., 2009) [10], we will journey deeper into
    the applications, benefits, challenges, and future directions of this transformative
    technology. Edge computing is not merely a tool; it is a catalyst for change in
    an industry that sustains us all. It represents the embodiment of the farming
    adage, “Make hay while the sun shines,” in a world where technology and data are
    the new suns that illuminate the path to a brighter, more sustainable future for
    agriculture and food production. 2 Smart Farming and Agricultural Transformation
    The agricultural sector is undergoing a remarkable transformation, driven by a
    convergence of cutting-edge technologies. This transformation, often referred
    to as “smart farming” or “precision agriculture,” is reshaping traditional farming
    practices and revolutionizing the way we produce food. In this era of smart farming,
    data-driven decision-making, automation, and sustainability are at the forefront
    of agricultural innovation. Data-Driven Insights One of the pillars of smart farming
    is data. From Fig. 1, modern farms are increasingly equipped with sensors and
    Internet of Things (IoT) devices that continuously collect data on soil conditions,
    weather patterns, crop health, and livestock behavior. This wealth of data is
    processed and analyzed using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning
    (Tiwari, S et al., 2018) [8] algorithms to provide farmers with real-time insights.
    Farmers can make informed decisions about resource allocation, pest control, and
    irrigation, leading to optimized crop yields and reduced environmental impact.
    Fig. 1 Edge computing architecture Full size image Precision Agriculture Precision
    agriculture is a hallmark of the smart farming revolution. It involves the precise
    management of farming practices based on data analytics. For example, GPS-guided
    tractors and machinery can plant seeds and apply fertilizers with centimeter-level
    accuracy, reducing resource wastage and enhancing productivity. This precision
    extends to all aspects of farming, from soil management to harvesting techniques.
    Resource Efficiency Smart farming (Kim, S.W, et al., 2015) is synonymous with
    resource efficiency. With the ability to monitor soil moisture levels [71], weather
    forecasts, and crop health in real-time, farmers can tailor their resource usage
    to specific needs. This results in reduced water consumption, minimized chemical
    use, and optimized energy usage, all of which contribute to cost savings and environmental
    sustainability. Environmental Sustainability Sustainability is a central focus
    of smart farming. The reduction of chemical inputs, the adoption of organic practices,
    and the promotion of regenerative agriculture are all made possible by data-driven
    insights. Farmers can implement practices that not only protect the environment
    but also regenerate soil health and enhance biodiversity. Automation and Robotics
    Automation and robotics are transforming labor-intensive farming tasks. Drones
    equipped with cameras and sensors can monitor large fields, identifying areas
    that require attention. Autonomous robots (Acosta, J.A, et al., 2011) [15] can
    perform tasks such as weeding and harvesting with precision and efficiency. These
    technologies reduce the need for manual labor, address labor shortages, and improve
    farm productivity. Early Disease Detection Smart farming technologies, including
    AI-powered image recognition systems, enable early disease detection in crops
    and livestock. These systems can identify signs of disease or pest infestations
    before they become widespread, allowing farmers to take targeted and timely action.
    This reduces crop losses and minimizes the use of chemical treatments. Market
    Insights Access to real-time data and market analysis tools empowers farmers to
    make strategic decisions regarding crop selection and timing. They can align their
    production with market demand, ensuring that their products reach consumers at
    the right time and price. 2.1 The Need for Data-Driven Agriculture In a world
    where the global population (Arora, M, et al., 2008) [4] continues to burgeon,
    and the impacts of climate change pose new challenges to food production, the
    agricultural sector faces an imperative: to produce more food with fewer resources
    while mitigating environmental harm. In this context, the advent of data-driven
    agriculture emerges as an indispensable solution. Growing Global Population With
    the world’s population [Arora, M, et al., 2008] [4] projected to surpass 9 billion
    by 2050, the demand for food is escalating. To meet this demand, agriculture must
    embrace innovation and efficiency. Data-driven agriculture leverages technology
    to optimize resource use, boost crop yields, and ensure food security for a growing
    populace. Resource Scarcity Scarce resources, notably arable land and freshwater,
    intensify the pressure on agriculture. Data-driven approaches enable precise resource
    allocation, ensuring that water, fertilizers, and other inputs are used judiciously.
    This minimizes waste and promotes resource efficiency, crucial in a world where
    resource scarcity looms. Climate Change and Environmental Impact Climate change
    exacerbates the unpredictability of weather patterns, making agriculture more
    vulnerable to extreme events. Data-driven agriculture equips farmers with tools

    In the past few years, (IoT) in towns, buildings, universities, \nwarehouses,\
    \ businesses, poultry, hospitals, and health centers \nhave penetrated most human\
    \ living areas.  [1, 2]. The network \nof (IoT) physical devices, vehicles, home\
    \ equipment, and other \ncomponents are embedded into electronics, software, sensors,\
    \ \ndrives, and communication networks that allow these objects to \ncollect and\
    \ exchange data [3, 4]. Everything can be identified \nuniquely by its incorporated\
    \ machine but interact with the \nexisting internet infrastructure  [5]. The IoT\
    \ enables objects to \nbe detected or operated directly via existing network \n\
    technology, enabling a closer connection between the real \nworld \nand \ncomputer-based\
    \ \nnetworks \nand \nenhancing \nperformance [6, 7]. \n IoT is applicable in a\
    \ large field of science and technology [8]. \nThey are used in computing, big\
    \ data, smart cities, mobile \ncharging networks, smart monitoring, smart power\
    \ systems, \nwater supply, environmental security, smart retail, smart supply\
    \ \nchain, online shopping [9-11]. The new IoT concept provides \nan open door\
    \ for creative applications that organize the \nrenowned conventional computer\
    \ advances. IoT attempts to \ncommunicate with these self-governing gadgets in\
    \ order to \ncreate related information without human mediation. The IoT \nhappens\
    \ when every day, recognizable objects are linked to \nmicrochips [12, 13]. \n\
    In the last 5-10 years, IoT platforms and services have changed \nwith open-source\
    \ hardware availability. The progress of this \nnew technology is expected to\
    \ begin. Students would have to be \ntaught IoT principles and best accessible\
    \ technologies, which \nfreely incorporate new technology into their work later\
    \ on [14]. \nThe LoRa WAN Standards-dependent middleware is a core \ncomponent\
    \ of this IoT scheme [15]. The technology of Lora is \nused to link sensors beyond\
    \ the internet spectrum to access \npoints. The software is then chosen as opposed\
    \ to the hardware \nused. Moreover, data vary from system to system, so a \"data\
    \ \nrepository\" is necessary if posted earlier rather than later for \nreliability\
    \   [16-18]. \nM. Sadeeq & Zeebaree / Journal of Applied Science and Technology\
    \ Trends Vol. 02, No. 02, pp. 80 –92 (2021) \n \n81 \nEnergy efficiency delivers\
    \ long-term economic gains by \ndecreasing import/supply costs for fuel, generating\
    \ energy, and \nreducing renewable emissions. Effective monitoring of real-\n\
    time power supply chain data plays an important role in \nincreasing demand generation.\
    \ Optimizing energy storage \nincludes three primary parts: (I) energy sources\

    \ 20]. IoT uses sensors and \nnetworking systems to detect and transfer real-time\
    \ information \nin fast computing and effective decision-making. IoT will also\
    \ \nturn the energy sector into a centralized, smart, and optimized \nelectricity\
    \ grid. Automatic, integrate, and monitor processes \nthrough IoT-based systems\

    advancements in Internet technologies, a wired or wireless \nsystem may be credited.\
    \ Several parameters can be \naccomplished to measure and estimate energy usage,\

    \ THEORY  \nA.  IoT Applications \nIoT technology uses are different because they\
    \ can be \napplied to almost any technology and can provide knowledge \nabout\
    \ the intervention process, operation performance, and the \nenvironmental variables\
    \ that must be controlled and monitored \nfrom a distance[28]. Today, several\
    \ organizations in different \nsectors and industries use this technology to minimize,\
    \ create, \nautomate, and track several processes [29]. The figure below \nshows\
    \ some IoT use in different sectors [30]. \nFig. 1.  Internet of Things Applications\
    \ [30] \nB. The architectural design of IoT  \nAn open architecture that uses\
    \ open protocols to support \nmany existing network applications to provide scalability,\
    \ \nsecurity, and semantic middleware to facilitate worldwide \nInternet data\
    \ convergence should provide an IoT architecture. \nIoT should then be a five-layer\
    \ system as shown in fig 2 [31-33]: \nSensing and control layer: the basis for\
    \ the design and \ndeployment, including RFID readers, smart sensor nodes, and\
    \ \nentry gateways [34]. A group of sensor nodes sensor the \nassociated ambient\
    \ information, pass it to the nearest gateway \nand then transmit data from the\
    \ internet to the network. The \nenergy supply system consists of three primary\
    \ parts: the energy \nsources included in upstream refining processes, (II) energy\
    \ \ntransfer processes, and (III) the energy demand within buildings \nand transport.\
    \ Energy supply chains; distribution. Processing \nlayer: Reasoning, semantic\
    \ analysis of sensing data, data query, \ndata collection, analytical data, mining.\
    \ Cloud computing could \nprovide a powerful tool for data processing and sensing.\
    \ It is an \nintegral part of the knowledge set. Application layer: The \napplication\
    \ layer uses this data to provide users with various \nservices after data collection\
    \ and analysis. The IoT software can \nbe classified, Into network monitoring\
    \ (logistics, regulation of \nemissions), control form (smart transport, intelligent\
    \ home), \nscanning type (motor bag, highway, no parking costs). \nFig. 2. Internet\
    \ of Things Architecture [31-33] \nM. Sadeeq & Zeebaree / Journal of Applied Science\
    \ and Technology Trends Vol. 02, No. 02, pp. 80 –92 (2021) \n \n82 \nC. Resources\
    \ and IoT  \nAutomation of industrial processes, data acquisition, and \ncontrol\
    \ systems have been standard in the power industry. The \nearly steps of IoT started\
    \ by monitoring and controlling \ninstallations and procedures to minimize the\
    \ risk of a power \nsupply breakdown or failure. Sustainability, performance,\
    \ \nenvironmental impacts, and maintenance are critical problems \nfor old power\
    \ plants. The age and general maintenance problems \nof the electrical equipment\
    \ contribute to high energy losses and \nunreliability. Suppose we use our IoT\
    \ sensors to calculate power \nplant efficiencies. In that case, the data transmitted\
    \ will allow us \nto understand how the systems are working by detecting errors\
    \ \nor declines in energy performance [35, 36]. The compatibility of \nintermittent\
    \ renewable energy sources such as wind and solar \nhelps reduce the impacts of\
    \ coal energy consumption [19]. \nD.  Consumption of electricity  \nPrevious studies\
    \ found that renewable energy production and \nuse significantly contribute to\
    \ countries' economic and \nenvironmental activities. Green Energy's importance\
    \ lies in its \necologically favourable nature and is considered a more \nproductive\
    \ natural resource for healthy commercial, human and \necological development.\
    \ With countries strongly inclined to \nconserve the environment, environmental\
    \ policy needs to \nexplore the causal connection between clean energy and \n\
    economic development. The long-term link between sustainable \nenergy usage and\
    \ economic growth has been researched.  in \nprevious studies. Therefore, the\
    \ causal relationship between \nrenewable energy and environmental destruction\
    \ is essential in \ncountries that spend tremendous capital on renewing renewables\
    \ \nfor better economic and environmental conditions [37]. \nFig. 3. Final Electricity\
    \ consumption, World 1990-2018 [38] \nE.  Green IoT \nEnergy utilization of IoT\
    \ equipment is a big concern, \nunbelievably, shortly in the wide-scale use of\
    \ these technologies \nhas been expected.  Millions of wired networks are in operation;\
    \ \nfor the internet, a great deal of energy is needed. The vast \nnumber of IoT\
    \ equipment will also produce a great deal of \nelectronic waste. Low carbon and\
    \ efficient communication \nnetworks are needed. These factors luckily led to\
    \ the emergence \nof (G-IoT). G-energy compelling IoT features are essential \n\
    components in the lifecycle, including design, development, \nimplementation,\
    \ and ultimate disposal. In different IoT \ntechnology, the G-IoT cycle can be\
    \ used, like RFID tags. The \nsensor nodes can also be used in wireless sensor\
    \ networks in \nsleeping mode and can only run when necessary. Methods for \n\
    radio optimization can reduce node uses, such as modulation \noptimization or\
    \ mutual collaboration. Besides, practical, energy-\nefficient routing technologies\
    \ may provide efficient solutions \nsuch as multi-track routing or cluster architectures.\
    \ Finally, the \nabove methods and examples Reduce energy consumption for \nthe\
    \ IoT [19, 39, 40]. \nF. Smart Cities \nToday, the vast population increase and\
    \ overcrowding have \ncreated many global challenges, including air and water,\
    \ access \nto power, and the atmosphere. One of the big problems is to \nprovide\
    \ safe, sustainable, and secure energy sources for \ncommunities. Recent advances\
    \ in emerging technology have \ncontributed to mobile, IoT-based applications\
    \ to current \nchallenges in a smart city climate. Smart factories, smart houses,\
    \ \npower plants, and farms can be linked in a city, and data on their \nenergy\
    \ usage can be obtained at various hours a day [41]. In \nmultiple processes,\
    \ smart cities, transmitting and connectivity of \ninformation, intelligent recognition,\
    \ deciding the location, \nmapping, security, emission control, and identity protection\
    \ will \nbe handled using IoT technologies [42]. IoT technology can \nassist in\
    \ the tracking of any object in a region. Sensors may be \nlinked to homes, urban\
    \ infrastructure, transport, electricity \nnetworks, and services. This will support\
    \ a smart city based on \ncontinuous monitoring of data acquired from sensors.\
    \ For \nexample, street lights can be regulated for saving energy by \ntracking\
    \ vehicles with IoT. [43]. \nG. Intelligent Grid \nModern grids that use the safest\
    \ and most efficient ICT to \ntrack and optimize energy production, T&D, and use\
    \ [44].  A \nsmart grid creates a cross-directional data flow for optimum \nsystem\
    \ monitoring and efficient energy supply by linking \nmultiple smart meters. In\
    \ different sub-sectors of the energy \nsystem, such as energy storage, home,\
    \ transport, or careful \nconsideration, the intelligent grid operation should\
    \ be \nemphasized separately. Batteries are recharged in conventional \ngrids,\
    \ adapters and power cables, and AC/DC inverters. These \nbatteries can be wirelessly\
    \ charged in an intelligent grid via \ninductive charging technology [43]. In\
    \ an intelligent grid, end \nusers can determine the latest demand pattern by\
    \ collecting data, \nsuch as phones or electric cars, via an IoT network. The\
    \ nearest \nwireless battery charging station then assigns the necessary \ncharging\
    \ time for the device/car. IoT can also improve battery \nmanagement and monitoring.\
    \ So the electricity supply can be \nchanged first and secondly the power supply\
    \ for These vehicles \nare excellent and reliable. [45]. It will significantly\
    \ minimize \nunnecessary waste demand. Besides that, IoT may be applied in \n\
    individual islands or entities in different or microgrids, \nparticularly where\
    \ energy is required at any time, without \nexception in databases. Both grid-related\
    \ properties connect in \nthese networks. Energy demand data are also available\
    \ for any \ncommodity. This relationship means that every time and \nanywhere,\
    \ the energy flow is fully regulated  [46]. \nM. Sadeeq & Zeebaree / Journal of\
    \ Applied Science and Technology Trends Vol. 02, No. 02, pp. 80 –92 (2021) \n\
    \ \n83 \nH. Distributed Systems and Cloud computing \nDistributed structures should\
    \ be flexible, involving \ntopography, organization or scale [47, 48]. The distributed\
    \ \nsystem may face some problems and challenges because of the \nprotection,\
    \ which is a big concern for the system [49, 50]. When \nan unstable asset supplies\
    \ a distributed system, fault tolerance \nis another issue in the distributed\
    \ model [50]. Without due \nprocesses and procedures, the incorporation and deployment\
    \ of \nservices become a problem [51]. Providing processing power \nover a network\
    \ (internet) is advantageous for cloud computing \n[52-54]. For clients to transact\
    \ business, they do not need the \nservices of massive, complex computers; rather,\
    \ they may \naccess cloud storage services depending upon their needs [55] \n\
    [56]. The basic equipment is routinely facilitated in vastly \ndistributed systems\
    \ using various virtualization practices to \nachieve high scalability, availability,\
    \ and agility [57]. However, \ncloud computing services' allocation serves as\
    \ a study subject \nthat led to groundbreaking algorithms and methods [58]. Cloud\
    \ \ncomputing \nis \nthe \nfield \nof \nhighest \ninterest \nfor \ntelecommunications\
    \ professionals, with potential uses in mind \n[59]. The resource-assigning technique\
    \ is important to consider \nmind-boggling communications among persons interested\
    \ in \nusing the ready-programs [60]. Conveyed in the various server \n[61]. The\
    \ key principles for running the ready programs inside \nthe system are the tools\
    \ required for computations [62]. The \nclient interpreted the operation, and\
    \ this way prepared them to \nexecute it [63]. When a client provides the customer\
    \ with a \nservice, it is an activity that leads to the development of a \nprocedure\
    \ [64]. This sets the customer up to perform their \noperations correctly. The\
    \ CPU uses this resource to access the \ncomputer's memory [65].  \nIII. ENERGY\
    \ MANAGEMENT SURVEY  \nMany scholars have discussed Energy Management and its\
    \ \nimplementation frameworks in the last few years. In this section, \nthe critical\
    \ points of some of the latest research are discussed. \nShen, Ruyin Zhang, et\
    \ al., [20] Considered both IoT and \nedge server systems. The edge server contains\
    \ code blocks for \nthe IoT platform and alleviates its minimal memory power by\
    \ \nloading the IoT device blocks. Moreover, the IoT system can \nextract electricity\
    \ from environmental sources in order to \naccomplish a sustainable process. One\
    \ solution to the complex \nelectrical issues suggested by the author is a block\
    \ prefetching \nframework (BPF) to optimize user-friendly delays. The coalition\
    \ \nsupports the intelligent pre-historically cloud intelligent \ntelecommunications\
    \ infrastructure systems. The BPF contains a \nprediction module, a pre-precipitation\
    \ module, and a dual \nlearning module. The module requests blocks from the edge\
    \ \nserver depending on available memory and energy. The dual \nlearning module\
    \ tries to make the shift happen much faster. The \nsimulations are performed\
    \ to test the ability of the proposed \nsystem.   \nGarg, Ritu Garg, Neha[27]\
    \ suggested a scheduling algorithm \nto equilibrium the energy produced by SEH\
    \ and the IoT node \nenergy consumption by the IoT node resulting in the balanced\
    \ \nmethod. The proposed SWEH device's performance is superior \nto that of a\
    \ single solar panel or wind turbine. These results show \nthat the algorithm\
    \ should leave the device in an energy-neutral \nstate at the end of a particular\
    \ period.   \nKrishnamoorthy et al. [66] Proposed an IoT method that \ntracks\
    \ load power usage and effectively saved electricity. IoT \ncould be used for\
    \ various purposes, from home automation to \nsectors where real things are connected\
    \ to a network from \neverywhere. The proposed project implements the Internet\
    \ of \nThings (IoT) based energy management system, whereby \ninformation is obtained\
    \ from an IoT automated meter and \ndisplayed on an IT website. This device can\
    \ be used to measure \nthe environmental load data and store it in the IoT network.\
    \  \nBedi, Guneet, et al., [67] Created Elman's recurring neural \nnetwork model\
    \ and an exponential electrical power prediction \nmodel in a building environment\
    \ powered by IoT. The models \nforecast the usage of electrical energy by an electrical\
    \ load (1) in \nwhich a relationship occurs between the net consumption of \n\
    energy by the electrical loads in the building and the atmospheric \ntemperature\
    \ and the building's occupancy; and (2) in which \nelectrical energy consumption\
    \ is predicted using the forecast \ntemperature and schedule. The construction\
    \ area under \nconsideration is the Real-Time Power and Intelligent Systems \n\
    Laboratory (RTPIS) combined with IoT devices and technology \nfor intelligent\
    \ monitoring and control. Heating, ventilation, and \nair conditioning (HVAC)\
    \ units and light panels are considered \nelectric loads. Comparisons are also\
    \ rendered for the Elman \nRNN and exponential models. These forecast capabilities\
    \ help \naddress electricity consumption variabilities by delivering \nelectricity\
    \ to meet electricity demands, reducing electricity loss, \ndecreased carbon emissions,\
    \ and cost savings. \nLasso-Lopez et al. [68] Presented the development and \n\
    deployment of an IoT prototype for energy monitoring, \nestablished by a group\
    \ of undergraduates studying the challenge-\nbased learning paradigm to strengthen\
    \ their disciplinary and \ninterdisciplinary competence. This instructional approach\
    \ helps \nstudents address a relevant challenge by applying new \ntechnologies\
    \ and effective methodologies. The users tested the \nbuilt prototype for six\
    \ months. The findings demonstrate that by \nrecognizing energy efficiency problems\
    \ in the laboratories, the \nprototype has brought advantages relative to the\
    \ students who \nused the conventional learning model even from a theoretical\
    \ \nperspective. \nAlmonacid-Olleros, et al., [69] There have been multiple \n\
    machine learning models tested to determine a photovoltaic \n(PV) system's behaviour\
    \ and energy efficiency. The author also \nutilized several types of estimates\
    \ for power to test \ncomputational models of solar panel systems. This is operated\
    \ \ndata from a photovoltaic device installed to monitor the energy \nutilization\
    \ (Spain). Computer models may be more effective \nthan analytical ones because\
    \ learning time can vary, and it can \nbe faster. Temporary windows are an effective\
    \ method to \nquantify time variation characteristics to enhance performance.\
    \   \nAvancini, Danielly BRodrigues, et al., [70] Built and actual \nverified\
    \ a low-cost smart meter solution for internet-based \nenergy monitoring. It forwards\
    \ the data collected by \nsmartphones via Wi-Fi and collects them using an IoT\
    \ \nmiddleware equipped with energy-management ability. The \nintelligent meter\
    \ is automatically regulated as well as \nM. Sadeeq & Zeebaree / Journal of Applied\

    electronically collected. To that end, Bluetooth, ZigBee, and \n6LowPAN protocols\
    \ (or 6LoWPAN RF4CE) will be enabled. \nThe Wi-Fi was used to understand the smart\
    \ meter and the IoT's \ncommunication capability, then verify this. It can be\
    \ automated \nin an intelligent environment that requires control, such as a \n\
    home automation system.  \nFilios, Gabriel Katsidimas, et al. [71] Demonstrated\
    \ the \nplatform and fueling protocol that allows energy accumulation, \nstorage\
    \ capital, and load system usage to be controlled and \ncompletely regulate the\
    \ system energy inputs and outputs. As the \nenergy management framework can be\
    \ adapted remotely, based \non tracking features, the author generates various\
    \ harvest \nprofiles to forecast the energy harvested. Similarly, the author \n\

    \ \nHan, Tao Muhammad, et al., [72] Concentrated on the needs \nof today's smart\
    \ grids, homes, and businesses to build a deep, \nintelligent learning system\
    \ for energy management. For short \nperiods, the author forecasts potential energy\
    \ usage and provides \ngood coordination between producers and customers. Key\
    \ \ncontributions \ninclude \nsophisticated, \nreal-time \nenergy \nmanagement-based\
    \ devices via widespread cloud-based data \nserver monitoring, optimum technological\
    \ standardization \ncollection, and a novel sequence-based energy-predicting \n\
    mechanism with reduced time complexity and lowest error rates. \nThe suggested\
    \ systems apply to a typical cloud server in an IoT \nnetwork connecting with\
    \ the related smart grids to efficiently \ncontinue the phenomena of response\
    \ and energy demand. The \nauthor applies numerous preprocessing strategies to\
    \ resolve \nvarious electrical data characteristics, follows an appropriate \n\
    short-term forecast decision-making algorithm, and implements \nthem on dependable\
    \ resource-controlled instruments. Even for \nresidential and commercial data\
    \ sets, the author does detailed \nexperiments and witnesses 0.15 and 3.77 units\
    \ reduced MSE and \nRMSE.  \nKumar, N Komal Sikamani, et al., [73] Effective dynamic\
    \ \ncontrol of household consumables using IoT has been \nestablished. The full\
    \ set-up involves an electronic metering \ncomputer, a billing system, LCDs, a\
    \ base station control unit, a \nhousing station, and a GSM communication module.\
    \ The energy \nand amount used will be shown on the LCD screen and \ntransmitted\
    \ through the Household Station to the base station \nthrough GSM. Without the\
    \ individual having to check \nperiodically for meter readings, the machine also\
    \ warns them \nthrough the mobile device pay for electricity.  The device is \n\
    comfortable and practical to use in domestic areas where \nelectricity is healthy\
    \ and comfortable for the enterprise and the \nend-users.  \nYang, Ching-Cheng\
    \ Pandey, et al., [74] proposed a new kind \nof energy harvesting circuits. This\
    \ unsolicited electronic counter \nincludes an unsolicited electronic sensor to\
    \ power an IoT \nautomaton tag. The oscillator was intended to be driven by the\
    \ \ndischarged capacitances of the charge pump. The gated clock is \nself-tuned\
    \ to achieve a precise fit between its input and output \nimpedances to improve\
    \ circuit efficiency. The chip consists of \nan integrated circuit with areas\
    \ of 1.2 square meters \nimplemented using TSMC process T18. This experiment with\
    \ \nthe DSSC resulted in the maximum power conversion efficiency \n(PCE) of 77%\
    \ for converting electrical energy from the CFLs \ninto the lamp's power. PCE\
    \ of 70-100% can be met through a \nrange of lightness of 300 to 1300 lx. With\
    \ the achieved broad \ninput and output range and the maximum throughput of 200\
    \ \nmW, the 77 per cent power conversion efficiency is the best \npower conversion\
    \ efficiency ever reported in this research.   \nSedighiani, Shima Singh, et al.,\
    \ [75] Presented the concept \nand production of electromagnetic energy harvester\
    \ sensor \n(EHS) node and bicycle power control incorporated all-in-one \nkit.\
    \ An integrated coil within an IC package provides one to \nseven-and-a-half milliamps\
    \ of power at eight to forty kilometres \nper hour. Unlike standard EHS, the transceiver\
    \ and sensor \nmodules' power supply path is separately provided from 1.8V, \n\
    and the on-chip (MCU) of the MCU is operated below/below the \nthreshold. A low\
    \ power control unit is developed in partnership \nwith MCU to maximize the harvester's\
    \ capabilities (sense, \noperation, transmission). The simulation and study of\
    \ the \nelectromagnetic EHS proposed in response to a time-changing \nenergy source\
    \ indicate a major increase in our energy \navailability and the scalability of\
    \ our EHS compared with \ncutting-edge technologies. Lowering the size of the\
    \ processor \nrequires more energy storage capacitors than previous projects.\
    \   \nHaseeb, Khalid Ud Din, et al., [76] Proposed a system for \nIoT-based wireless\
    \ sensor networks (WSNs) as a smart \nagriculture application comprising numerous\
    \ architecture \nstages. First, farm sensors gather data and evaluate a collection\
    \ \nof cluster heads based on several parameters' decision-making \nrole. The\
    \ signal's intensity is also calculated on the transmitting \nconnections by using\
    \ the SNR to achieve reliable and effective \ndata transmission. Second, data\
    \ transmission from agricultural \nsensors to base stations (BS) is assured using\
    \ linear congruent \ngenerator recurrence. The simulation findings show that the\
    \ \nsuggested system has dramatically increased connectivity \nefficiency in network\
    \ output by an average of 13.5%, a decrease \nof 38.5% in packets, a drop of 13.5%\
    \ for network latency, 16% \nfor energy usage, and 26% for smart agriculture routing\
    \ \noverhead in contrast with other strategies.  \nKiat, Wei-Pau Mok, et al. [77]\
    \ proposed implementing an \nenergy-efficient technique used in IoT applications\
    \ to support \nvarying performance and energy trade-offs utilizing a reduced \n\
    instruction set computing (RISC) processor. The processor can \nbe reconfigured\
    \ into pipeline mode and multi-cycle mode (high \ncomputer speed, at the cost\
    \ of high dynamic power). Switching \nbetween modes is done by taking advantage\
    \ of the partial \nreconfiguration (PR) function that modern FPGAs bring. A \n\
    RISC processor has been developed using the microarchitectural \nlevel methodology\
    \ and implemented as an IoT node on FPGA. \nExperimental \nfindings \nreveal \n\
    that \nreconfigurable \nmicroarchitecture enables IoT devices to consume less\

    \ \n \n85 \nenergy-controlled nodes are considered in this framework. Three \n\
    techniques are used in the current EMS. The first approach \ndecreases the number\

    \ software the \nfunction of the IoT nodes of critical energy. The third approach\
    \ \noffers a scenario of fault tolerance to fix imminent energy issues \nfacing\
    \ IoT nodes. Finally, the proposed EMS is tested by the \nNS2 network simulator\
    \ to construct an intense IoT environment \nsimulation. The simulation results\
    \ demonstrated the efficiency \nof the proposed EMS regarding the following performance\
    \ \nparameters overridden the conventional IoT system: energy \nusage, number\
    \ of failed nodes because of lack of energy, \nthroughput, and network life. \
    \ \nArshad, Junaid Azad, et al. [79] proposed an intrusion \ndetection framework\
    \ for energy-restricted IoT devices, which \nform the basis of an industrial IoT\
    \ (IIoT) ecosystem. The author \ndiscusses various topology designs' strategies\
    \ and feasibility, \ndepending on the degree of top-down and bottom-up control.\
    \ \nThe author inspected the architecture of the Contiki operating \nsystem and\
    \ validated the proposed architectural design. The \nresearch showed that the\
    \ proposed architecture would reduce \nenergy and coordination overheads while\
    \ ensuring successful \nintrusion detection for IIoT systems.   \nLork, Clement\
    \ Li, et al. [80] Built a data-driven and risk-\nbased approach to handling split-type\
    \ inverter AC that \nmaximizes efficiency in residential buildings. First, information\
    \ \nfrom related ACs and residential units is aggregated as a minimal \nimbalance\
    \ in the data. Then, the Bayesian-Convolutional-\nNeural-Networks (BCNNs) are\
    \ used to model the efficiency and \nvariability of the ACs from aggregated data.\
    \ Thus, this Q-\nLearning-based, reinforcement learning algorithm is dedicated\
    \ \nto set-point improvement. Second, a case study will be simulated \nbased on\
    \ such a system to prove that the uncertainty-aware \nagent's control behaviour\
    \ performs well in terms of relief from \nanxiety and profit optimization. The\
    \ auto construction design's \nefficiency can be changed by increasing and decreasing\
    \ the level \nof safety improvement.   \nLi, Wen-Tai Tushar, et al., [81] There\
    \ are already studies to \nachieve energy efficiency for the solar water heating\
    \ system \n(SWH) in a hospital building situated in Singapore. The author \nuses\
    \ the data we have acquired from IoT to gather information \non the system's different\
    \ environmental and operational aspects \nunder consideration, recognize opportunities\
    \ for optimizing \nvarious sub-systems' performance, and establish management\
    \ \nmechanisms for the system's effective operation as a whole. \nUsing data gathered\
    \ by IoT, we do an energy audit to evaluate \nsystem components' efficiency and\
    \ the entire system's \nperformance. Based on the organization's data, appropriate\
    \ \ncontrol strategies for the different sub-systems are employed to \nincrease\
    \ the overall system's performance and reduce the \nrunning costs of the SWH.\
    \ A control mechanism is demonstrated \nat the SWH site.   \nDey, Bishwajit, et\

    \ microgrid system for \ndistributed energy resources (DERs) is conducted. DERs\
    \ include \ncoal-fired power plants. Different legislated commandments are \n\
    considered in choosing dispatch units. Residential buildings \ncommonly sustain\
    \ their loads during working hours. This \nresearch will explore the effects of\
    \ power loads on the economic \nbenefit of solar microgrid systems. Hybrid solutions\
    \ involving \nGREW and SCA have been primarily considered efficient \ntechnology,\
    \ which reduces generation costs. The total cost of \ngenerating power was found\
    \ to increase by 50% when residential \nand non-residential loads were considered\
    \ together. Here, the \norganization's balanced presence saved 9–17% of generation\

    \ architecture with linked energy \nstore networks to solve the everyday energy\
    \ management issues \nin the presence of sporadic applications. The suggested\
    \ approach \ncompensates for the resultant energy imbalance when an \nunpredicted\
    \ intermittent occurs by spreading the stored energy \ndepending on the energy\
    \ storage systems' EPT. When \nintermission is over, the energy control system\
    \ changes its \npotential operating points on new terms. The suggested \nframework's\
    \ reliability is tested over a 24-hour cycle using an \nenergy management system\
    \ for the average intelligent building. \nThe findings contrast with a simple\
    \ approach, which does not \ntake EPT into account in managing intermittent systems.\
    \ The \nfindings comparison validates the suggested approach's \nfeasibility in\

    \ This paper \nis the Stackelberg game model, where the SEH serves as the \nmaster\

    \ Finally, a case is analyzed to check if the \nprocedure is right. The findings\

    Ashiquzzaman, Akm Lee, et al., [87]  Reinforcement \nLearning (RL) is used to\

    \ Khuyen Sheng, et al., [88] The new \ndevelopments in the internet of things,\
    \ artificial intelligence, and \ndistributed ledger technology have been built\
    \ together to create \nmore efficient and intelligent energy storage and energy\

    \ in order to create a smartphone app \nfor intuitive energy consumers to evaluate,\

    \ \nagriculture system using a wireless sensor network (WSN). \nDifferent sensors\
    \ are disposed of irregularly in a given area. \nEvery sensor can sense the data\
    \ from the environment, collect it, \nand transfer it to the IoT server. This\
    \ new system is sound in \ncomparison to other systems because of its advantages.\
    \ With this \nsystem's help, task scheduling, agricultural system monitoring,\
    \ \nand watering program are now more efficacious because the \ncloud can schedule\
    \ all upcoming tasks and events to the system. \nThe system can automatically\
    \ schedule any event based on the \ncollected information. Agriculture can be\
    \ made more accurate \nand productive by adopting this agricultural production\
    \ system.  \nHossain, Md Liton Abu-Saida, et al., [90] Suggested a more \nstraightforward\
    \ Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation \n(SVPWM) for proportional integrals (PI)\
    \ to eliminate ripples of \nthe output waveform, overcome the problem of the voltage\
    \ \nbalance and produce improved output waveforms. Wind energy \nconversion system\
    \ (WECS), on the other hand, experiences \nvarious types of failures, particularly\
    \ in the dc-link condenser \nand power converter switching units. These errors\
    \ will lead to \ncatastrophic failures of the WECS and continuity of power \n\
    supply unless detected and rectified at the early stages. A new \nalgorithm in\
    \ the proposed PI-based SVPWM controller is \nproposed in this paper to locate\
    \ the fault position in the power \nconverter. Since several wind turbines are\
    \ installed in remote or \noffshore areas, the WECS system monitoring must be\
    \ \nestablished by IoT to ensure the system's efficiency. This work \npresented\
    \ to track the state of WECS in a real-time environment \nusing an industrial\
    \ IoT algorithm with an associated hardware \nprototype.  \nMokhtar, Charafeddine\
    \ Negrou, et al., [91] Presented an \ninnovative solution by merging demand and\
    \ supply management \n(DSM) to optimize the particulate swarm and use a traditional\
    \ \ndwelling to optimally develop an off-grid hybrid PV-solar \ndiesel-battery\
    \ system for electrification of residential buildings \ninto arid environments.\
    \ This proposed HRES would first be \nmodelled by a MATLAB in-house code based\
    \ on the multi-agent \nsystem principle and then adapted, according to the reliability\
    \ \nlevel and renewable energy penetration, by minimizing total net \npresent\
    \ cost (TNPC) costs. Following HOMER software \nvalidation, more techno-economic\
    \ analysis is carried out, \nincluding a sensitive review, taking various battery\
    \ technologies \ninto account. The findings revealed the following changes when\
    \ \nintegrating the planned DSM: RF = 100% decreases energy \ndemand and TNPC\
    \ by 7% and 18%, respectively, in contrast \nwith the single application of supply-side\
    \ control.  \nWang, Lu Jiang, Difei [92] proposed a concept scheme for \nintelligent\
    \ building thermal energy consumption control under \nIoT. The implementation\
    \ measures are as follows: (i) Create a \nstructural study and composition of\
    \ the smart monitoring \nframework for buildings' thermal energy consumption.\
    \ (ii) For \nthe acquisition of data and real-time data processing for \nbuildings'\
    \ thermal energy, the DSP integrated signal processor is \nused to complete the\
    \ acquisition and data conversion of thermal \nradiation information. (iii) Create\
    \ an IoT energy usage \ninformation control module and create a wireless sensor\
    \ network \nmodel for monitoring energy consumption to track buildings' \nconsumption\
    \ of thermal energy intelligently.  \nRaiker, Gautam A Umanand, et al., [93] Introduced\
    \ a \nframework that allows the user to track and manage his loads \nfrom a single\
    \ platform. The framework uses the Internet of \nThings (IoT) and Cloud Database\
    \ principles to make the \ndemand-side energy management platform more user-friendly\
    \ \nand intuitive. Non-intrusive Load Control (NILM) is used \ninstead of sensors\
    \ on each Power Socket Outlet for load \ndisaggregation. Disaggregated Load data\
    \ is saved in the \nRealtime Database of Google Firebase for quick access from\
    \ \nsmartphones or the internet. The consumers still have Load \nControl from\
    \ the same network, which completes the Load \nEnergy Management loop.  \nGolpîra,\
    \ et al., [94] In the presence of transferred loads, an \nefficient IoT energy\
    \ management (EM) platform has been \nimplemented for general delivery networks\
    \ in Smart Cities \n(SCs). The system's judgment is ideally communicated between\
    \ \nits two primary layers; a \"core cloud\" and the \"boundary clouds.\" \nThe\
    \ EM of a microgrid (MG), which is shielded by an edge \ncloud, is directly carried\
    \ out by its operator and is responsible \nfor optimizing the central cloud's\
    \ EM by the Distribution System \nOperator (DSO). The adjustment to the load usage\
    \ schedule for \nborders and their peak load hours, based on market energy \n\
    prices, leads to reduced cloud running costs. With MG \naggregators' maximal trade\
    \ capacity, the DSO optimizes the \noverall network running costs to optimize\
    \ power storage \nplanning by using input parameters for the core cloud \noptimization\
    \ issue. The energy storage costs are lower energy \nprices through consumer buying\
    \ power and discharged at high \nenergy prices to meet network requirements and\
    \ meet edge \nclouds' energy requirements. As a result, the DSO and the MGs \n\
    use the moving loads and energy storage to fulfil the energy \nbalance at a minimal\
    \ cost.  \nM. Sadeeq & Zeebaree / Journal of Applied Science and Technology Trends\

    \ and energy consumption in a closed-loop fashion. \nAll of the sub-systems for\
    \ sensing, controlling, and actuating are \nconnected to the internet, and end-users\
    \ are ensured a remote \ninterface with the AC controller.  Besides, this is something\
    \ \ncommendable in Islam as, according to the legal rule, \n\"prevention is better\

    \ An Internet of Things based \ncontrol architecture is introduced and tested\
    \ in a proof-of-\nconcept building in the Polytechnic of Bari, Italy. The proposed\

    \ reinforcement \napproach to energy conservation in residential areas. Defining\
    \ \nthe multi-agent system not only raises the scope for independent \ncomponent\
    \ demand response systems but also accelerates \nestimates. We use Q-learning\
    \ to find the best solution for the \ngiven issue of residential energy management.\
    \ Besides, a \nscenario-based approach of actual data and correct density \nfunctions\
    \ are used to resolve uncertainties. Deterministic and \nstochastic numerical\
    \ simulations justified the feasibility and \nrobustness of the proposed approach.\
    \ The simulated findings \ndemonstrate that using the proposed strengthening approach\
    \ \ncontributes to lower prices for customers than traditional energy \nmanagement\
    \ systems focused on optimization.  \nLu, Qing Lü, et al., [97] Household energy\
    \ control focused \non a smart home energy hub (SREH) whose electricity and \n\
    natural gas inputs are designed for modern households. The \nphysical features\
    \ and household expectations suggest pertinent \nenergy-use equipment models as\
    \ well as management \ntechniques. To distribute energy supply in the SREH, there\
    \ is a \nmulti-objective optimization challenge, providing schedules for \nenergy-use\
    \ equipment in addition to categorized standard \nequipment. Six kinds of unknown\
    \ actions are modelled as sub-\nobjectives in a comfort deviation. The ultimate\
    \ aim is to \nminimize energy consumption and the deviation of comfort. \nFour\
    \ case studies are then provided to validate the proposed \nmodel's feasibility,\
    \ which increases the sub-objective meaning. \nThe real actions of household consumers\
    \ finally demonstrate the \nsolidity of the model. To optimize decision-making,\
    \ sensitivity \nanalysis on the starting time distribution, weighting variables,\
    \ \nand the number of unknown scenarios are carried out.  \nYu, Qingguang Jiang,\
    \ [98] Design and implementation of the \nIoT control strategy in smart microgrid\
    \ based on the NEZB were \nproposed. The framework of the intelligent supervisory\
    \ control \nand data acquisition (SCADA) system was planned for the \nonline control\
    \ of energy usage and climate parameters. The \npower management regulation strategy\
    \ was introduced. Finally, \nthe planned smart microgrid control strategy is implemented\

    \ it can be seen that researchers have \nemployed different types of techniques\
    \ in several fields. \nInvestors have issued a list of their recommendations upon\

    \ that some researcher depended \ndirectly on the Residential field. In contrast,\
    \ another work in the \nIndustry field, rather than the remaining researchers,\

    \ the \nresearcher uses an important technique. Another method is used, \nsuch\

    \ management methods to \nreduce energy consumption. The literature review indicated\
    \ that \nvarious active mechanisms contribute to energy management \nachievement.\
    \ These areas include residential, industrial, \nagricultural, \nsmart \ncity,\
    \ \nsmart \nbuildings, \nsmart \ngrid, \ncommunication, Internet of Things (IoT)\
    \ devices, and Internet of \nThings environment. There are many tools in this\
    \ area, such as \nMATLAB, DSP integrated signal processor, real-time \ninformation\
    \ processing, intelligent wireless gateway, wireless \nsensor network model, microcontroller,\
    \ and other types of \ncomputing tools (MCU). To attain the goal, various techniques\
    \ \nhave been successfully used by the researchers (WSN). Today \nthe researchers\
    \ continue to focus on the residential, industry, \nagriculture, and smart city\
    \ aspects. Both solutions of Energy \nManagement Scheme (EMS) and IoT-based architecture\
    \ for \nHeating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) have been \ndeveloped\
    \ to incorporate SMART energy hub and smart energy \ndevices, respectively. Adding\
    \ to that, it can conclude that IoT is \nthe most suitable technique for energy\
    \ management and \nconsumption. Also, to control and monitor the distributed \n\
    building. \nREFERENCES \n[1] P. Asghari, A. M. Rahmani, and H. H. S. Javadi, \"\

    \ utilizes low-power Bluetooth and LoRaLPWAN technologies to effectively monitor\
    \ soil moisture and water levels. The system utilizes a variety of sensors to\

    \ are helping to make water management smarter\nand optimizing consumption in\
    \ the smart agriculture industry. This article proposes a new topology\nof sensor\
    \ nodes based on the use of inexpensive and highly efﬁcient components, such as\
    \ water level,\nsoil moisture, temperature, humidity, and rain sensors. Additionally,\
    \ to guarantee good performance\nof the system, the used transmission module is\

    \ measurement campaign.\nKeywords: Internet of Things (IoT); water management;\

    \ (WSN) technology, which is known as the center of the Internet of\nThings (IoT),\
    \ has continuously grown in recent years. An advantage of WSNs is their ability\
    \ to easily\ndeﬁne a network of devices that can be communicated with and gathered\
    \ from a monitored ﬁeld\nthrough communication links since the information is\
    \ sent through multiple nodes with a gateway and\nconnected to other networks\
    \ like wireless Ethernet. Many researchers have applied WSNs to different\nresearch\
    \ areas, such as environmental monitoring, forest ﬁre detection, smart cities,\
    \ smart education,\nhealthcare, agricultural control, water quality monitoring,\
    \ military uses, and asset management [1–9].\nAccordingly, WSNs are suitable for\
    \ multiple applications. The long range (LoRa) LPWAN is one\nnovel IoT communication\
    \ technology with an excellent capacity for development that is applied in\nmany\
    \ ﬁelds. The beneﬁts of this technology can be attributed to its capabilities\
    \ of ultra-long-distance\ncommunication, low power consumption, and ease of deployment,\
    \ among others.\nIn agriculture, environmental monitoring is required to control\
    \ speciﬁc plant conditions.\nBy collecting approximate values of available data\
    \ and making more accurate estimates, a WSN\ncan be used to achieve this task.\
    \ In addition, many agriculture researchers apply WSNs to monitor\nenvironmental\
    \ criteria [2–6]. In addition to standard environmental conditions such as temperature,\n\

    \ subject of research in an agricultural environment [10].\nWater management and\
    \ optimal water supply have become popular topics in the ﬁeld of smart\nagriculture\
    \ and are being studied and developed by many researchers. Over the years, prominent\n\
    researchers in the ﬁeld of smart agriculture have written many survey articles\
    \ which introduce the\nresearch methodology for various communication technologies\
    \ that control resources efﬁciently based\non IoT technology [11–13]. We summarize\
    \ and compare our model with the existing literature in\nTable 1. In Vietnam,\
    \ agricultural production has transformed the country’s socioeconomic status\n\
    by alleviating national food insecurity, reducing poverty, fostering agrarian\
    \ exports, and providing\nlivelihoods to nearly half of the labor force nationwide.\
    \ These are just some examples, since WSN is\nactively applied to various functions\
    \ such as smart cities, waste management, and waste collection\nwith LoRaWan technology\

    \ and essential tasks to be completed. Section 3\npresents details of the architecture\
    \ of the IoT proposed system. Section 4 presents the operational tests\ncomposed\
    \ of two different tasks, while Section 5 discusses the advantages and disadvantages\
    \ of our\npolicy. Finally, some concluding observations and a way forward are\
    \ offered in Section 6.\n2. Smart Agriculture and Related Works\nAs it possesses\
    \ the advantage of critical natural resources, Vietnam is an agricultural country\
    \ that\nis growing very quickly. Agriculture plays an essential role in the Vietnamese\
    \ economy and contributes\nto the country’s economic development currently and\
    \ in the future. Agriculture is one of the critical\nindustrial sectors of Vietnam,\
    \ and economic growth depends heavily on agriculture. The population of\nVietnam\
    \ will rise to reach 100 million people by 2020, while the demand for agricultural\
    \ products such\nas food crops (e.g., sweet potatoes, manioc, beans, and corn)\
    \ rice, coffee, pepper, cashew nut, rubber,\ntea, fruit, and vegetables continues\
    \ to increase dramatically. Combined with the effects of climate\nchange, these\
    \ demands place even more strain upon land, water, energy, and other resources\
    \ that are\nJ. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n3 of 22\nalready inﬂuenced. Several\
    \ smart solutions can be co-optimized and scaled up to improve yields and\nmeet\
    \ growing food production demands while transporting power and water resources\
    \ efﬁciently [17].\nMany articles depict the close relationship between smart\
    \ agriculture and IoT/WSN.\nResearchers focus on how this high-tech improvement\
    \ can be employed to develop effective smart\nsystems and data transmission [8,18].\n\
    The authors of [18] present a SmartFarmNet framework, based on the IoT platform\
    \ that can\nautomate the collection of environmental, fertilizer, soil, and irrigation\
    \ data; automatically correlate\nthat data and evaluate product performance; and\
    \ calculate product estimates and suggest speciﬁc\nproducts for any particular\
    \ farm. Importantly, IoT devices can be integrated into this platform as\nsensors,\
    \ cameras, and weather stations. Produced data can then be saved in the cloud\
    \ to enable\nperformance analysis and and recommendations.\nWith the help of IEEE\
    \ 802.15.4, which is a suite of high-level communication technology, artiﬁcial\n\
    intelligence, and decision support technology, the authors of [19] have developed\
    \ research on the\nagricultural application of IoT technology to monitor real-time\
    \ moisture and nutrients of citrus, along\nwith an analysis of the combination\
    \ of fertilizer support systems and irrigation. However, this research\nhas weaknesses,\
    \ which include system complexity and high costs. The authors of [20] also present\n\
    a narrow-band radio channel model whereby the communication link transfers under\
    \ near-ground\nrequirements for a smart agriculture platform.\nThe solution presented\
    \ in [21] was developed by implementing machine learning applications\non agriculture\
    \ datasets for smart farm improvement. By employing and comparing numerous\nmachine\
    \ learning methods to recommend the best solution, this system enabled the investigation\n\
    and deployment of useful jobs, varying from crop yield forecasting to missing\
    \ or incorrect sensor\ndata reconstruction. However, the only reasonable application\
    \ for this scenario is smart agriculture,\nsince three different resources are\
    \ available: the CRN scientiﬁc dataset, Istat statistical dataset, and the\nIoT\
    \ sensor manufacturing dataset.\nMany researchers and developers have chosen microcontroller\
    \ boards (e.g., Arduino boards) or\nRaspberry Pi for IoT applications. These allow\
    \ real-time monitoring, collection, data management,\nsecurity, and remote control\
    \ functions using the mobile app because of the suitable platforms available\n\
    for Internet-connected sensor buttons. This option is often challenging because\
    \ it entails a trade-off\nbetween cost, performance, and functionality for each\
    \ speciﬁc application project. Water management\ninvolves a valuable resource.\
    \ If an attacker controlled the system, entire crops could be destroyed\ndue to\
    \ altered irrigation levels. A denial of service (DoS) attack on sensors, irrigation\
    \ actuators,\nor distribution systems could affect system-wide operations. Changes\
    \ to sensor settings may also\nissue a warning that could cause networks or decision\
    \ producers to perform illegal actions and yield\nmonths of efforts and production\
    \ aims. If an attacker gains control of the actuators, irrigation and\nwater distribution\
    \ may be compromised and result in the incorrect irrigation of certain products.\n\
    Furthermore, eavesdropping may give criminals access to secret data about the\
    \ farm. They could\nremove productivity information and even manipulate the commodity\
    \ business, which represents an\neven more signiﬁcant threat. Self-governing vehicles,\
    \ drones, and engines utilized to collect images or\ncontrol manufacturing must\
    \ also be kept classiﬁed. An unauthorized node in the network can send\nincorrect\
    \ information about a crop. However, the authors only present the challenges to\
    \ security in\nsmart agriculture, and do not discuss how to overcome challenges\
    \ [22].\nA smart agriculture system was constructed to use low-power Bluetooth\
    \ and LPWAN\ncommunication technologies, including the wire-based communication\
    \ technology used in the existing\nfarm in [23]. This was combined with microcontrollers\
    \ such as an Arduino UNO board or Raspberry Pi\nboard. The administrator receives\
    \ data from sensor connections, and then stores the data, analyzes it,\nand provides\
    \ a user interface to monitor it. A related study [24] explains how an approach\
    \ to using IoT\nand cloud computing that incorporates development is helping to\
    \ quickly modernize agriculture and\nto realize smart solutions for agriculture.\
    \ Moreover, to solve problems regarding more practical issues\nJ. Sens. Actuator\
    \ Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n4 of 22\nrelated to farmers, sensors can be applied for use\
    \ in the IoT system. Furthermore, 2G and 3G wireless\nbroadband networks can be\
    \ used for communication between other components in the IoT system.\nSeveral\
    \ enabling technologies are adapted to present smart platform projects, which\
    \ are able\nto collect and manage data handling problems related to water management\
    \ in smart agriculture.\nFor example, the SWAMP project is a platform architecture\
    \ that includes a scenario-based development\nprocess for the obtained systems\
    \ in [25]. Moreover, the platform develops and assesses smart water\nmanagement\
    \ for precision irrigation in agriculture with a practical method based on four\
    \ pilots in\nBrazil, Italy, and Spain. The structure of SWAMP can be developed\
    \ for different solutions to deal\nwith the requirements of different contexts,\
    \ countries, climates, soils, and crops. Indeed, considerable\nﬂexibility is required\
    \ to adapt to a range of deployment conﬁgurations, including a diverse mix of\n\
    technologies. Unfortunately, for this platform, it is not possible to use without\
    \ the license and to do\nthis. The different IoT smart platforms presented in\
    \ [26] propose the use of cloud-based technology\nto manage the collection, analysis,\
    \ and forecast of agricultural environmental information in one\nuniversal system.\
    \ Besides the introduction of the platform, the author of the paper also presented\
    \ LoRa\ncommunication and applied it to the studied network, and although details\
    \ were not provided on the\nhardware used to do this. In summary, both studies\
    \ presented interesting suggestions and suitable\nplatforms for application to\
    \ smart agriculture.\nOther authors have focused on completing a systematic literature\
    \ review of IoT research and\ndeployments in protected agriculture over the past\
    \ ten years, in which they evaluate the contributions\nmade by various researchers\
    \ and organizations. Moreover, the structure of IoT is also detailed in\nprotected\
    \ agriculture, including the used platforms, modern wireless technologies, cloud\
    \ computing,\nmachine learning, big data, animal farming, hardware, software challenges,\
    \ and so on [27].\nAnother paper [28] proposes an IoT idea-based solution for\
    \ smart farming, where the authors\nproposed stack and discuss the current improvements.\n\
    They mainly focus on the IoT/M2M\ninteraction and explain the design and development\
    \ of a gateway that discusses the provided\nservices. Notably, in [29], the Web\
    \ of Things (WoT) was proposed as an idea to use environmental\nmonitoring and\
    \ enhance agricultural practices by supporting decision-making based on bio-data\n\
    collection. The paper brieﬂy presents the original design, which is a middleware\
    \ platform for IoT\nthat performs separation by understanding opportunistic networking\
    \ and computing operations.\nAccordingly, it is able to detect and control environmental\
    \ targets using web-based technologies.\nMeanwhile, the use of IoT for smart precision\
    \ agriculture for rural areas is proposed in [30]. In this\npaper, the authors\
    \ focus on a scalable network architecture for real-time monitoring of agriculture\
    \ in\nrural areas. A possible strategy is to optimize each element of the system\
    \ to reduce system latency\nup to a particular area. A solution [31] was proposed\
    \ by implementing a framework for managing,\ninvestigating, and sharing groundwater\
    \ data, with the use of sensors to gather data on groundwater\nlevels, pump sensors,\
    \ and weather conditions.\nIn [32], electromagnetic ﬁeld analysis is presented\
    \ as an enhanced monitoring approach for\nsubsurface radio wave propagation and\
    \ underground sensing applications in the ﬁeld of prediction\nagriculture. However,\
    \ this technology is challenging to implement in complex real environments,\n\
    which may delay system deployment. The prediction of the agriculture model presented\
    \ by [33]\noffers solution management capabilities by monitoring soil conditions\
    \ in real time using underground\nwireless sensors. Furthermore, the structure\
    \ used two types of communication links, above-ground\nand underground, for the\
    \ experiments. However, other challenges need to be solved, such as reducing\n\
    energy loss and promoting energy efﬁciency. These nodes should be able to adapt\
    \ to the soil moisture\nand temperature changes of the environment, among others.\n\
    More recently, the authors in [8] proposed an irrigation system that combines\
    \ IoT and data\nanalysis for the collection of environment data and control of\
    \ the farm via web and mobile applications.\nHowever, this article faced challenges\
    \ in controlling water in the farm. After analyzing state-of-the-art\nresearch\
    \ on water management and smart agriculture that applies IoT and related technology,\n\
    the following outcomes are drawn:\nJ. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n5 of 22\n\
    •\nMany popular systems and platforms can be used for water management in smart\
    \ agriculture,\nbut may be too expensive for the average farmer [28–31].\n•\n\
    The combination of multiple technologies in one system and the presence of limitations\
    \ leads to\ncomplexity when combining proprietary technologies. Moreover, many\
    \ factors affect the price\n(e.g., farm, hardware design, and guiding documentation),\
    \ although a basic package costs a\nminimum of $500 in [28–31].\n•\nAll IoT smart\
    \ agriculture solutions on the market are Most IoT smart agriculture products\
    \ are\npassive methods (i.e., manual). In some cases, they are connected to farm\
    \ monitoring devices to\nact smartly.\n•\nMany researchers have presented solutions\
    \ for smart agriculture systems. However, these\nmethods are restricted by the\
    \ design-embedded board and the inﬂexibility of devices, as it\nmay be necessary\
    \ to attach additional sensors or to control two or more farms with the same\n\
    mobile application.\nTherefore, we proposal a novel system to address the four\
    \ above points:\n1.\nThe standard IoT water management system is explained and\
    \ designed. It can connect to the\nInternet through LoRa communication both manually\
    \ and automatically with all hardware\ndesigns. The IoT box is designed to manage\
    \ the IoT devices and obtain data from the farms.\n2.\nA system is possible connected\
    \ the agriculture from farming based on rural areas efﬁciency\nto IoT system.\
    \ Additionally, the implemented system is a good alternative for analyzing the\n\
    communication between the gateway and nodes 1 and 2.\n3.\nOur smart watering system\
    \ receives real-time data input from sensors embedded in a farm tunnel\nand other\
    \ locations. The system then offers suggestions for watering schedules and capacity.\n\
    An advantage provided by the sensors, used for two farms, are the transmission\
    \ of an evaluation\nto the user’s mobile application, from where users can prepare\
    \ a watering plan for the farms.\n4.\nFinally, our smart watering system is scheduled\
    \ to a date and time which guarantees that the\nwater level falls below the threshold\
    \ in the tunnel farm. The system notiﬁes the user and switches\non the water pump\
    \ (manual or automatic) in time to water the plants.\n3. System Architecture\n\
    The aim of this paper is to provide a solution for the real-time monitoring of\
    \ water management\nthat optimizes power consumption.\nAn additional target is\
    \ a cost-saving in smart agriculture.\nThe critical element that affects energy\
    \ dissipation in the sensor nodes is the transmitting module.\nAs a design operation,\
    \ it focuses on the structure of the sensor node and the meaning of the network\n\
    sensor architecture. Finally, the determination of effective data transfer technology\
    \ is geared towards\nimplementing an energy-efﬁcient sensor node. The details\
    \ are discussed in Section 3.1.\nHowever, most of the smart agriculture ﬁeld if\
    \ the data are the crucial importance in the node,\nwhere the users could be easily\
    \ chosen by operating more comfortable components. Therefore,\nthe micro-controller\
    \ must be selected to guarantee a suitable trade-off between energy efﬁciency\n\
    and complexity. Finally, elements must be selected to consider the optimal agreement\
    \ between\nmeasured data accuracy, expected energy to carry out that task, and\
    \ price, thus prioritizing the use of\nsensors. As a result, the power of the\
    \ sensors becomes an important factor for energy consumption\nand longevity. The\
    \ proposed IoT node in our system is constructed following these requirements.\n\
    First, the choice made regarding essential elements is a single-chip micro-controller\
    \ such as an\nATmega328/P or ATmega2560. A reasonable choice is to provide simple\
    \ open-source software to allow\nthe user to observe and boost their conﬁdence\
    \ in the programming. Second, it uses a lower number\nof clock cycles to execute\
    \ instructions than others—all of the sensors and the developed single-board\n\
    microcontroller, where all of the devices are integrated. Third, after reviewing\
    \ the start-of-the-art of\nthe relevant technology, the best option is the LoRa\
    \ technology, as it provides IoT connectivity over\nlarge areas by enabling data\
    \ transmission across an extended range. It uses very little power, is robust\n\
    in a rural area, and uses an overall network architecture that was developed in\
    \ a smart agriculture\nJ. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n6 of 22\nsituation.\
    \ Finally, low-cost and low-power sensors were selected to provide an excellent\
    \ balance\nbetween measurement accuracy and energy efﬁciency.\nOur paper introduces\
    \ a reliable, robust, cost-effective, and scalable smart agriculture solution\n\
    based on IoT technology. The architecture system is presented in Figure 1, which\
    \ presents three\nnode prototypes: the gateway, node 1 and sensor node 1, and\
    \ node 2. The ﬂow diagram shown in\nFigure 2 demonstrates how to manage data transmission\
    \ between the gateway, node 1, and node 2 of\nour system.\n•\nThe gateway performs\
    \ the core functions of data collection from the nodes via LoRa, and then\nsends\
    \ data to the cloud, via the WiFi ESP82666 module, and to the mobile application.\
    \ Moreover,\nusers can also control the node throughout the gateway with the use\
    \ of the mobile app.\n•\nNode 1 and sensor node 1 are designed for this case,\
    \ as we assumed that the water pump machine\nis far from the sensor location.\n\
    •\nNode 2 was designed for orchard conditioners, with a topographic condition\
    \ suitable for installing\npumps directly in the farm without separating the sensor\

    \ that it is possible to apply any microcontrollers\nor data transmission modules,\

    \ is combined of a LoRa module and WiFi ESP8266 module, and ATmega2560. Figure\

    \ Electronic schematic and Gateway’s prototype, which includes\nthe sub-section\
    \ mentioned as below:\n3.2.1. Transmitter Module\nAs mentioned previously, the\
    \ transmitter module performs a vital concern in energy consumption\noptimization.\
    \ Hence, it has to be precisely selected and prospered. The IoT proposed node\
    \ is proposed\nto be used outside and spread over a rural area. Since radio communication\
    \ link solutions must be\nexplored, this needs to be taken into account. In fact,\
    \ it is unthinkable for something like this to have\na wirework connection (e.g.,\
    \ LAN) in large quantities at each node. An IoT application has many\ncommunication\
    \ networks where the sensor system is proposed. These systems are working based\
    \ on\nvarious radio technologies. Table 2 shows a measurement of the available\
    \ technologies, along with\ntheir essential features. The vital functions such\
    \ as area, consumption, and availability are accentuated\nin this table because\
    \ they are crucial parts for developing the device. After reviewing the technical\n\
    aspects as presented in this paper, the selection for data transmission technology\
    \ is an E32 LoRa series\nmodule [34]. The settings of this module work in the\

    \ 6. Electronic schematic of the Gateway and Node 1.\nConsidering all of these\
    \ previous technologies, there are mean ﬂexible options for the achievement\n\
    of IoT nodes. The most signiﬁcant selection has to be carefully studied as it\
    \ is easy to change\nthe hardware, implementation, and long-lasting quality over\
    \ time. The one recommended in our\narticle, which is a solution for the real-time\
    \ monitoring of controlling the level of water and resulting\nhypothesis, shows\
    \ as:\n•\nThe IoT node system is expected to be deployed for two nodes with the\
    \ distance between two\nnodes being a few km with complex terrain in rural areas.\
    \ Therefore, the cost of the system needs\nto reduce to the lowest level possible,\
    \ and the support services need to be optimized:\n•\nThe coverage of our system\
    \ to around tens of km2;\n•\nThe lower power consumption is composed possibly\
    \ for an adaptive data rate and changes\nthe output bit rate. Moreover, it depends\
    \ on payload combined with chirp spread spectrum\ntechnology that effectively\
    \ gives processing gain. In addition, LoRa Technology can easily plug\ninto existing\
    \ infrastructure and enables low-cost battery-operated IoT applications.\nAfter\
    \ reviewing these simple highlights, it can deﬁne the beneﬁts and drawbacks of\
    \ the leading\nfour communication networks released for the previously outlined:\n\
    J. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n10 of 22\n(a) Gateway\n(b) Node 1\nFigure\
    \ 7. Prototype of the gateway and Node 1.\n•\nLocal Area Networks (LAN): The ad\
    \ hoc’s area coverage is signiﬁcantly more than other carrier\nnetwork technologies.\
    \ However, it still has some disadvantages. Applying the radio technology\nnetwork\
    \ for our system: for instance, WiFi or BLE technology set up, requires a signiﬁcant\
    \ number\nof nodes for the system. It will noticeably change the overall cost\
    \ of the deployed infrastructure.\nA different choice might be to implement a\
    \ ZigBee network or BLE technology. Because the system\nis not energy efﬁcient,\
    \ and admits a signiﬁcant decrease in the power consumption of the\nend device\
    \ nodes, this means that, although their current absorption levels are relatively\
    \ low\n(40 mA [35]), their life expectancy provided by batteries is in some order.\n\
    •\nLow Power Consumption (LPWAN): The authors in [36] proposed characterizing\
    \ great Area\nNetworks LPWAN solutions as their more extensive transmission range\
    \ allows for the\nestablishment of a star or multi-star network with some APs.\
    \ Allowing the sensor node to\nuse the chief duty-cycling policies allows for\
    \ turning off buttons for long periods. Finally, the\nprice of this technology\
    \ is meager when agreeing to use them in large quantities at no extra charge\n\
    as in the situation of ISP co-operation.\n•\nGlobal Area Networks (GAN): The global\
    \ network is the most simple solution to deploy because\nit does not need access\
    \ points or speciﬁc infrastructure implementations. Unfortunately, it has\nmany\
    \ other essential features, the ﬁrst being the price: 3G technologies; still,\
    \ the lowest of different\ntechniques is always more expensive than other solutions.\
    \ Furthermore, SIM is used, so\nthey need subscription payments when preparing\
    \ to deploy many of nodes and become\ninsigniﬁcant. Additionally, the energy consumption\
    \ needs to take into consideration that the\naverage modern consumption of the\
    \ third-generation mobile cellular system is many times higher\nthan that of the\
    \ IEEE 802.15.4 [37]. Alternatively, a low-power wide-area network module [38]\n\
    may be considered; however, obtaining it is unsuitable for applications with low\
    \ energy use.\nFinally, in the rural areas, some ISP cannot support the Internet\
    \ service for the users.\n•\nNarrowband-Internet of Things:\nNB-IoT is the novel\
    \ technology with a short form of\nNarrowband-Internet of Things and speciﬁed\
    \ in LTE Release-13 [39]. It is developed to meet\nthe requirements of LPWA (Low-Power\
    \ Wide-Area) networks. NB-IoT has a wide variety of\napplications for many ﬁelds\
    \ such as personal, technology and industrial. The applications are\nwearables,\
    \ smart bicycles, event detectors, smart garbage bins, smart metering, smart agriculture,\n\
    and logistics tracking. Mainly, low power and long-range are the absolute essentials\
    \ for IoT\n(Internet of Things), which is a signiﬁcant concern with mainstream\
    \ cellular technologies.\nThe other advantages of the NB-IoT are scalability,\
    \ quality of service and safety related to\nJ. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n\
    11 of 22\nunlicensed LPWA networks and design, including the secure connections\
    \ between small energy\ndevices and a gateway.\nTable 3. Technical speciﬁcations\

    UART\n3.2.2. ATmega2560 Microcontroller\nIn this research, the nodes communicate\
    \ with each other via the UART interface. At the gateway,\nit is necessary to\
    \ use two UARTs (the ﬁrst one communicates with the ESP8266 module, and the other\n\
    one is used to communicate with two nodes. In Node 1, it is also necessary for\
    \ two UART interfaces to\ncollect data from the nodes and the gateway, since the\
    \ ATmega2560 is a reasonable choice [40].\n3.2.3. WiFi ESP8266 Module\nThe WiFi\
    \ ESP8266 module from [41–43] is the best choice because the ESP8266 is very ﬂexible\
    \ in\ndata transfer between devices and mobile applications, easy to integrate\
    \ into advanced projects, and\nadaptable within the Arduino embedded development\
    \ environment.\n3.3. Node 1 and Sensor Node 1\nThe same as in gateway, in this\
    \ node, an AC supply has to be converted towards the demanded\nform with the required\
    \ voltage range for storing power supply to various types of devices. We are\n\
    suggesting that the micro-controller and the transmission module need 5 V for\
    \ the powering system\nwith a receive node each, and it is necessary to incorporate\
    \ voltage regulators inside the node. Therefore,\ntwo voltage regulators use 5\
    \ V and 3.3 V regulators, which power the sensors in Figure 4 and the\npowering\
    \ system for the receiver node.\nFigure 4 shows the block diagram of Node 1, which\
    \ designs the case. It assumes that the water\npump is placed far away from the\
    \ sensor location since there is a sensor node to collect the data for\nNode 1.\
    \ Node 1 receives the data from sensor Node 1. Based on the sensor values, we\
    \ can deﬁne the\nvalue from the application and the sensors located at Node 1.\
    \ Moreover, in this node, there are two\nprimary sensors, which are the pump temperature\
    \ sensor and water level sensor. LoRa module on\nNode 1 communicates to the Gateway.\
    \ We also use RF HC12, a short-range wireless data transmission\nmodule whose\
    \ primary function is to receive data from sensor Node 1 transmitted to Node 1.\
    \ RFID\nperforms the central feature of controlling the pump directly at Node\
    \ 1 to increase the security of the\nsystem, and LCD is designed to display the\
    \ data of Node 1. Sensor Node 1 in Figure 5 shows the\nﬂowchart of details as\
    \ the node power is an external AC–DC converter with 7 V that gives sufﬁcient\n\
    current to power all the components.\nSection 3.3.1 illustrates the details of\
    \ the ATmega328 microcontroller and the sensors connected in\nFigure 8 for Node\

    \ Node 2.\n3.3.1. ATmega328 Microcontroller\nAll of those sensors require the\
    \ involvement of a micro-controller system to perform:\nthis component must be\
    \ implemented to trade off the price, power consumption, and performance\nenergy\
    \ results. According to most elements of low power, modern micro-controllers use\
    \ for a several\nmA, the effects of this element for the typical power consumption\
    \ of the node can be negligible,\nthus providing a higher level of independence\
    \ [43].\nBased on the principle diagram of Gateway and Node 1, it seems that both\
    \ have many common\npoints, which can be seen in Figures 3 and 4. The best selection\
    \ in this study for the integrated design\nfor both Gateway and Node 1 is signiﬁcant.\
    \ Because they save on the costs of printed circuitry, achieve\nfaster circuit\
    \ machining, and quickly ﬁx hardware errors. Figure 6 shows the schematic of an\
    \ actuator\nGateway and Node 1, which contains: an AC–DC converter, ATmega2560,\
    \ LoRa transmission, RFID,\nLCD, and all the sensors. Note that, for the sake\
    \ of simplicity, we proposed all of the integrated circuits\ndepicted in the schematic.\
    \ After that, the printed circuit boards Gateway and Node 1 are designed\nwith\
    \ two layers of wires to make wiring more convenient and help optimize the circuit\
    \ as much as\npossible. The components are arranged in blocks with separate functions,\
    \ making it easier and more\nconvenient to check for errors.\nThe printed circuit\
    \ of Gateway and Node 1 is designed with:\n•\n62 components in which there are\
    \ 59 glued components and three pin components.\nJ. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019,\
    \ 8, 45\n13 of 22\n•\nThe total number of different lines is 49 lines.\n•\nThere\
    \ are three different line sizes of 80 mils, 25, and 10 mils following different\
    \ wiring\nrequirements.\n•\nLine rules: do not cut wires, report faulty components\
    \ and the minimum distance between wires\nis 10 mm.\n•\nSize: 74.193 × 87.503\
    \ mm.\nFigure 7b shows the overall prototype of Node 1. Node 1 powers with a 5V\
    \ AC–DC converter that\nstores full current energy to control all the components\
    \ and the relay module. Furthermore, the LoRa\nmodule is not put close to the\
    \ converter because it generated the electrical noise and the interference of\n\
    communication links.\nWith the various parameters to be observed in our system,\
    \ in most cases, temperature,\ntemperature–humidity, soil moisture, rain, and\
    \ water level are measured.\n•\nTemperature sensor: DS18B20, [44], the popular\
    \ solution for temperature control in smart\nagriculture systems is the application\
    \ of standard digital sensors, for instance, DS18B20 integrated\ncircuits in this\
    \ research.\n•\nTemperature-humidity sensor: DHT22 [45] is a current sensor, which\
    \ combines the temperature\nand humidity sensor; it provides a wider temperature\
    \ range and better accuracy. In particular,\nit has low consumption and is better\
    \ for most smart farming systems.\n•\nSoil moisture sensor: SKU:SEN0193 [46],\
    \ this soil moisture sensor measures soil moisture levels\nby capacitive sensing\

    \ Tests\nThe proposed smart agriculture system is evaluated using two different\
    \ scenarios in Vietnam:\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of the sensors for the\
    \ analysis of temperature, solid humidity in\na research lab; and conﬁrming data\
    \ transmission by using the LoRa channel over a large area\nand distance.\n4.1.\
    \ Tests on the Sensors of the IoT\nThe ﬁrst scenario was set up in the Department\
    \ of Electronics and Telecommunications\nEngineering of Ton Duc Thang University,\
    \ Vietnam, where the sensing infrastructure was evaluated.\nThe performance of\
    \ the system was tested using a subset of nodes with the Arduino. These sensors\n\
    were used because the presence of other components would not affect the accuracy\
    \ of the measurement.\nIn addition, since the circuit board was furnished with\
    \ the equivalent microcontroller used in the node,\nthis circuit board was chosen\
    \ for speciﬁc tests due to its ease of use, as fast prototyping is required\n\
    and because it can exploit the equivalent microprogramming of an IoT button. Experiments\
    \ were\nperformed using the gate, button 1, and sensor button 1 and button 2 with\
    \ LoRa integrated with\nembedded sensors. An easy-to-read LCD screen was added\
    \ to the mainboard, where it displayed\nthe temperature and humidity measured\
    \ by the sensor as shown in Figures 11 and 12. Furthermore,\nthe accuracy of sensor\
    \ measurements was displayed and conﬁrmed on the LCD screen. Finally,\nsensors\
    \ were calibrated before the test to guarantee the accuracy of data, and to help\
    \ users to eliminate\ndifﬁculties during the setup process the system.\nJ. Sens.\

    \ of the two boxes: sensor Node 1 on the left and circuitry of Node 2 with all\n\
    sensors on the right.\n4.2. Test on Data Transmission through the LoRa Channel\n\
    In the second scenario, the effectiveness of the LoRa technology for the placement\
    \ of a farm\nmonitoring infrastructure was investigated by examining data transmission\
    \ distances in two real\nfarms as shown in Figure 13. For this purpose, a model\
    \ system infrastructure was set up in the Cho\nLach district, Ben Tre province,\
    \ Vietnam, to demonstrate the usability of an individual star topology\nnetwork\
    \ covering an entirely rural area. The model infrastructure was composed using\
    \ a gateway node\nproduced by a LoRa E32-TTL-1W module connected to a mobile application,\
    \ and by two sensor nodes.\nThe transmission modules were set up with three critical\
    \ measures: the symbol rate of information,\nthe bandwidth of the channel, and\
    \ the information rate were set according to the datasheet provided\nby the manufacturer\
    \ in order to obtain the highest sensitivity.\nBased on the sensor network structure\
    \ presented in the previous sections, the transmission\nranges were checked by\
    \ placing the gateway in the farm. The nodes were located in various areas:\n\
    node 1 covered 2000 m2 at a distance of 700 m from the gateway, while node 2 covered\
    \ 1000 m2 at a\ndistance of 500 m from the gateway. These positions were ﬁxed\
    \ and it was veriﬁed that the actual\ndata was correctly received. Subsequently,\
    \ data were collected from nodes 1 and 2 and sent to the\ngateway during the following\
    \ seven days of the same month, during which 24-h measurements were\nmade. In\
    \ this way, the performance of the system was tested. Figures 14 and 15 show the\
    \ results\nof the two nodes, which present the soil moisture, humidity, and temperature.\
    \ It can be observed\nthat, based on the threshold of these values, the system\
    \ could automatically switch on the water for\nthe farm. The experimental results\
    \ indicate that the application of a quick procedure for effective\nJ. Sens. Actuator\
    \ Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n17 of 22\nresolution building certainly helps to enhance\
    \ the outcomes of a sensor-based system. Not only does a\nsmart strategy improve\
    \ the performance of IoT-based and sensor-based systems, but the efﬁciency of\n\
    these systems can be increased with the smarter and more accurate choices made\
    \ by such intelligent\nsystems. Our experimental results highlight the procedure\
    \ used by the smart irrigation system to\nsave water in tunnel farming, thus achieving\
    \ higher productivity and the ability to ﬂexibly manage\nthe farm.\nFigure 13.\
    \ Map of the area covered by the LoRa module.\nFigure 14. Collected soil moisture,\
    \ humidity, and temperature during the data acquisition campaign\ncarried out\
    \ on Node 1 of Cho Lach district, Ben Tre province, Vietnam.\nData transmission\
    \ is also a crucial issue in the IoT smart system in checking the effect of packet\
    \ loss.\nData transmission is tested by exploiting a model created by internal\
    \ sensors. Node 1, Node 2, and the\ngateway are connected through a LoRa module\
    \ in the prototype as described in Section 4.1. Packages\nare lost from all test\
    \ nodes during transmission. Although packet loss was observed whenever the\n\
    model moved between a test place, this is not a problem because the nodes are\
    \ expected to remain\nat the growing farms in the studied area. Therefore, LoRa\
    \ technology is proven to be effective when\ndeployed in rural areas, without\
    \ having to turn on acceleration mode on the transfer module shown\nin Figure\
    \ 13.\nJ. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n18 of 22\nFigure 15. Collected soil\
    \ moisture, humidity, and temperature during the data acquisition campaign\ncarried\
    \ out on Node 2 of Cho Lach district, Ben Tre province, Vietnam.\n5. Discussion\n\
    The smart agriculture system based on an IoT application has the following advantages\
    \ compared\nto the previous approaches:\n•\nThe system can be used to manage two\
    \ or more independent farms on the same mobile application,\nwhich may have different\
    \ growth schedules. The aim of this research was to use devices of the\nIoT system\
    \ with lower prices that are easy to obtain.\n•\nRemoving the need for WiFi on\
    \ the farm with the application of LoRa technology helps to save\nenergy, lower\
    \ costs, improve efﬁciency, and facilitate excellent communication between the\
    \ farm\nand gateway.\n•\nControl data are saved to the system memory to prevent\
    \ power outages that result in data loss.\nFurthermore, the multitude of control\
    \ modes makes it easier for users to manipulate the farm.\n•\nReal-time updates\
    \ are available directly from the Internet in order to enable the system to run\n\
    more accurately.\n•\nA lost WiFi connection can be detected and communicated to\
    \ users for timely processing.\n•\nMany different sensors are integrated to collect\
    \ information related to tree care in order to improve\ncrop productivity. Our\
    \ strategy studies ﬁve parameters: temperature, temperature–humidity,\nsoil moisture,\
    \ rain, and water level.\n•\nNone of the previously mentioned approaches discuss\
    \ and investigate the effect of energy\nconsumption in smart irrigation systems.\
    \ Furthermore, other methods frequently rely on soil\nmoisture to determine the\
    \ water needs of plants.\n•\nThe results of the test and the measurement of our\
    \ smart watering system approach the standard\nwatering procedure as a product\
    \ of high-tech application. It has an economic efﬁciency that is at\nleast 30%\
    \ higher than the used technology.\nIn addition to the advantages presented above,\
    \ our research also has disadvantages, which need\nto be overcome before widespread\
    \ application. For instance, the ESP8266 module is a mid-range\nmodule without\
    \ a high stability, while the system can lose an Internet connection and depends\
    \ on the\nBlynk application.\n6. Conclusions\nThis paper presents a solution using\
    \ LoRa module transmission for a low-cost and effective smart\nagriculture system\
    \ for use in Vietnam, which is designed and implemented to control environmental\n\
    J. Sens. Actuator Netw. 2019, 8, 45\n19 of 22\nfactors in agriculture. It is less\
    \ expensive than other solutions with a similar accuracy. The system can\ncontinuously\
    \ observe the measured values and communicate them to users via a network and\
    \ mobile\napplication. Furthermore, the system can send alarms to users and activate\
    \ reduction devices. The IoT\nnode was tested in two separate cases in Cho Lach\
    \ district, Ben Tre province, Vietnam, and was used\nto measure distinct values\
    \ such as moisture, humidity, and temperature. Finally, experiments were\nperformed\
    \ to determine if the embedded electronics and the wireless communication module\
    \ might\ninﬂuence the collected values; there were no signs of interference. In\
    \ summary, the results conﬁrm\nthat the system provides the optimal solution to\
    \ users of smart agricultural control for farmers in\nVietnam. The availability\
    \ of real-time data enables quick use and management at all times from all\nplaces.\
    \ However, when IoT nodes are placed in various places, they generate huge quantities\
    \ of data.\nIn this case, our system requires time to store and analyze data before\
    \ ﬁnding the best solution.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, T.-Y.N.,\

  analysis: 'This paper provides a novel, reliable, and practical approach to develop
    an integrated and robust plant pulse monitoring system (IPWS) based on an adaptive
    winding strain (AWS) sensor. The IPWS is designed to wirelessly and accurately
    monitor the plant pulse to diagnose the growth and water state of tomato plants
    by analyzing the expansion and shrinking behavior of the plant stem.


    The AWS sensor, a key component of the IPWS, exhibits several advantages:


    1. Adaptive Wrapping: The AWS sensor is designed to adaptively wrap around the
    tomato stem without any adhesives or tape, which allows for easy fixation and
    prevents damage to the plant.


    2. Biomimetic Tendril Structure: The AWS sensor is inspired by plant tendrils,
    which allows it to automatically adjust its curvature to match the expansion and
    contraction of the plant stem. This biomimetic design avoids strain deficiency
    and ensures reliable monitoring.


    3. Temperature Resistance: The AWS sensor utilizes a serpentine-patterned laser-induced
    graphene (LIG) structure, which significantly enhances its resistance to temperature
    interference. This makes the sensor suitable for long-term and anti-interference
    monitoring of plant pulse even in varying environmental conditions.


    The IPWS system demonstrates high accuracy and reliability in monitoring the plant
    pulse. The ability to track the expansion and shrinkage of the plant stem provides
    valuable insights into the plant''s growth and water status. The system is also
    robust and can operate in different environmental conditions without compromising
    data integrity.


    Overall, this paper makes significant contributions to the field of real-time
    irrigation management by introducing a novel and effective plant pulse monitoring
    system. The IPWS, with its adaptive AWS sensor, provides a reliable and practical
    solution for monitoring plant growth, water stress, and optimizing irrigation
    practices.'

    INTRODUCTION\nCommunication\nwith\nsilent\nplants\nto\nobtain\ntheir\ngrowth\n\
    information is important for mechanism study and improving\ncrop yields1–5. Studies\
    \ have shown that the process of plant\ngrowth is similar to the contraction and\
    \ expansion of human\npulse, which is embodied in the contraction and expansion\
    \ of the\nstem during the day and at night6–8. And repeating expansion\nleads\
    \ to plant growth. Actually, plant pulse is related to the\nabsorption and transpiration\
    \ of water by plants8–10. During the\nday, when most stomata on leaves are open\
    \ and the transpiration\nof water from leaves is greater than the absorption of\
    \ water by\nroots, the stem diameter barely changes or shrinks. At night, when\n\
    the stomata on leaves are closed, the plant absorbs more water\nfrom roots than\
    \ water evaporation from leaves, and the stem will\nexpand. When water is scarce,\
    \ the stem shrinks obviously.\nTherefore, monitoring plant pulse can understand\
    \ the relationship\nbetween plant growth and water supply.\nCurrently, the sensors\
    \ applied for plant pulse monitoring are\nmainly rigid linear variable transducer\
    \ (LVDT) sensors11. Bulky and\nheavy LVDT sensors are difﬁcult to ﬁx and have\
    \ pre-tightening\nforce on plants8, which is not suitable for plant seedling\n\
    monitoring since the growth of plant seeding is fundamental for\nthe fruit setting\
    \ and yield. Recently, ﬂexible strain sensors that can\nbe worn on plants have\
    \ appeared the huge potential to\ncontinuously measure plant growth12–14. In recent\
    \ years, several\nplanar strain sensors for plant growth monitoring have been\n\
    developed2–4. However, there still exists some challenges in the\napplication\
    \ of planar strain sensors for the plant pulse monitoring.\nFirstly, the compact\
    \ glandular hairs and wax on plant stem affect\nthe ﬁxation of wearable planar\
    \ sensors. Sensors bound to plants\nby tape are not conducive to the growth of\
    \ plants and may fall off\nduring the long-term monitoring. In addition, complex\
    \ environ-\nment poses a threat to the sensors’ stability15. Indeed, plant\ngrowth\
    \ environment is complex and changeable, such as changes\nof light, humidity and\
    \ temperature, which might lead to the loss of\nsensors’ data ﬁdelity16. Finally,\
    \ the wired data acquisition method\nhas the disadvantages of cumbersome wiring\
    \ and high cost. To\nthe best of our knowledge, there has been no wearable sensing\n\
    system with ﬂexible adaptability and excellent anti-interference\nperformance\
    \ reported for plant pulse monitoring yet. Therefore, it\nis necessary to develop\
    \ a plant wearable sensing system with\nﬂexible adaptability, anti-interference\
    \ performance, and wireless\ndata transmission to monitor the plant pulse.\nHerein,\
    \ an integrated plant wearable system (IPWS) based on\nadaptive winding strain\
    \ (AWS) sensor for wireless monitoring of\nplant pulse was developed (Fig. 1a).\
    \ The IPWS consists of three\nmodules, i.e. an AWS sensor, a ﬂexible printed circuit,\
    \ and a smart\nphone APP display interface. The key element, AWS sensor was\n\
    designed inspired by the plant tendrils, which can adaptively wrap\naround the\
    \ tomato stem without any paste or adhesive. This\nbiomimetic tendril structure\
    \ converts a direct stretching strain into\nthe curvature effect, and avoids the\
    \ strain deﬁciency from crack\nfracture. In addition, the AWS sensor exhibits\
    \ resistance to\ntemperature interference via the serpentine-patterned design,\n\
    making the long-time and anti-interference monitoring for plant\npulse come true.\
    \ The expansion and shrink of stem can stimulate\nthe AWS sensor to generate resistance\
    \ variation, which can be\nrecorded by the IPWS that transmits the resistance\
    \ variation data\nto smart phone wirelessly. The results show that the IPWS system\n\
    can accurately monitor the plant pulse to diagnose the growth\nand water state\
    \ of tomato plant.\nRESULTS\nSystem design\nAs shown in Supplementary Fig. 1,\
    \ there are compact glandular\nhairs and essential oil on the surface of tomato\
    \ stem, which is not\nconducive to the ﬁxation of ﬂexible wearable sensors. Plant\n\
    tendrils can wrap around the stems of host plants, and the\ncurvature of spiral\
    \ line automatically varies with the expansion\nand shrink of plants stem, without\
    \ affecting the normal growth of\nthe host plants17,18. Studies on plant tendrils\
    \ prove that the layer\n1Laboratory of Agricultural Information Intelligent Sensing,\

    \ to the concave surface of tendrils is higher ligniﬁed than\nthat of the other\
    \ side, which will lead to strain mismatch at the\nﬁber interface and make tendrils\
    \ curl18–20. According to this\nmechanism, the plant wearable sensor with a biomimetic\
    \ tendril\nstructure was designed, which can adaptively wrap around the\ntomato\
    \ stem without any ﬁxation devices and tape (Fig. 1a). As\nshown in Fig. 1b, the\
    \ AWS is a sandwich structure, with 3D porous\nlaser-induced graphene (LIG) wall\
    \ sandwiched between transpar-\nent Ecoﬂex layers. The sandwiched LIG layer can\
    \ convert the strain\nresponse to the resistance signal, which can be captured,\n\
    converted, and transmitted by the ﬂexible printed circuit module.\nThe preparation\
    \ process of the AWS sensor is shown in Fig. 1c.\nThere are two signiﬁcant strategies.\
    \ Firstly, it is the transfer of\npatterned LIG from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)\
    \ to Ecoﬂex. We\nprepared the 3D porous LIG wall on the Polyethylene terephtha-\n\
    late (PET), glass, polystyrene, and PDMS substrates, respectively.\nThen Ecoﬂex\
    \ was applied to transfer the LIG. As shown in\nSupplementary Fig. 2, the results\
    \ showed that the LIG on the ﬁrst\nthree substrates could not be completely transferred,\
    \ and only the\nLIG on the PDMS substrate could be transferred completely. This\
    \ is\ndue to the low surface energy of PDMS (≈30 mN m‒1)21–23, which\nprovides\
    \ a non-adhesive substrate for stripping LIG24. This strategy\ncan transfer precise\
    \ LIG patterns in a large scale (Supplementary\nFig. 3). Secondly, the transferred\
    \ patterned LIG is ﬂipped and\nattached to the surface of another prestretched\
    \ Ecoﬂex ﬁlm. After\nreleasing the prestretched ﬁlm, the mismatched strain between\n\
    the upper and lower interfaces makes the composite polymer ﬁlm\nautomatically\
    \ curl into a tendril structure with speciﬁc curvature.\nThe curvature of spiral\
    \ structure can be tuned by adjusting the\npretrains, which would be discussed\
    \ in the characterization of\nelectromechanical properties.\nWireless data communication\
    \ plays an essential role in wearable\nsensing systems25–27. Wearable wireless\
    \ sensor systems for human\nbody are often integrated with Bluetooth communication28–30.\n\
    However, using Bluetooth wireless transmission is impossible to\nrealize remote\
    \ and large-scale monitoring of plants in the ﬁeld.\nTherefore, a ﬂexible printed\
    \ circuit with WIFI wireless data\ntransmission function was designed and fabricated\
    \ to realize the\nwireless communication between AWS sensor and a smart phone.\n\

    \ Supplementary Fig. 4, users can view the\nmonitoring data of multiple tomatoes\

    \ prepared the 3D porous LIG on the phenolic resin (PR) ﬁlm and\ntransfer the\
    \ LIG to the Ecoﬂex ﬁlm (Figs. 2 and 3). Scanning\nelectron microscope (SEM) was\
    \ used to characterize the morphol-\nogies of the LIG and transferred LIG. The\
    \ microstructure of the LIG\nis mainly determined by laser power and scanning\
    \ rate (Fig. 2)31,32.\nThe low laser power and fast scanning rate would not provide\n\
    sufﬁcient energy to formation of graphene (Fig. 2a). If the laser\npower is too\
    \ high, the 3D porous graphene structure would be\nover-burned, resulting in collapse\
    \ of layer structure and increase\nthe resistance (Fig. 2e). Figure 2b shows that\

    \ wall structure can be formed under the laser power\n2.5 W and scanning rate\
    \ 27 cm s‒1, and these porous structures are\nformed by the release of gas in\
    \ the laser transformation process.\nThe uniform 3D porous structure facilitates\
    \ the penetration of the\nEcoﬂex, and thus it can be fully transferred from the\
    \ surface of\nPDMS substrate. After the transferring process, the interconnect-\n\
    ing multi-layer LIG sheet structure is reserved, and the silicone\nrubber inevitably\
    \ occupies plenty of porous space (Fig. 3f, g). After\napplication of the 5% strain\
    \ (Fig. 3h), it can be seen that many\nmicrocracks consisting of gaps, islands,\
    \ and bridges connecting\nseparated islands appears on the surface33. These microcracks\n\
    cause partial fracture of the original conductive network, which\nleads to the\
    \ increased electrical resistance and strain response34,35.\nThe Raman spectrum\
    \ is a golden characterization technique for\ncarbon materials, which is extremely\
    \ sensitive to geometric\nstructure and bonding within molecules36,37. As shown\
    \ in Fig.\n3c, LIG exhibits three typical Raman peaks of graphene, including\n\
    D band at 1335 cm‒1, G band at 1582 cm‒1, and 2D band at\n2659 cm‒1, whereas D\

    \ of 0.52 reveals the\nhighly crystalline structure of graphene40–42. The obvious\
    \ 2D band\nreveals the formation of 3D multilayer graphene structures43. The\n\
    X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the LIG and PR are shown in\nFig. 3d. The\
    \ characteristic peak of PR is at 19.1°, while there is\nhardly any characteristic\
    \ peak of the PR in Raman spectrum of the\nLIG. There are typical graphitic crystal\
    \ phase (002) and (100) peaks\nat 26.1° and 43.4°, respectively32,44. These results\
    \ further conﬁrm\nthe formation of the graphene structure.\nElectromechanical\
    \ properties of the AWS sensor (Fig. 4a–c) were\ninvestigated via mechanical tensile\
    \ tests. Similar to the strain of\nplant tendrils, the strain process of the AWS\
    \ sensor consists of\nelastic deformation and plastic deformation45. The elastic\
    \ defor-\nmation ﬁrst occurs during the strain process, followed by the\nplastic\
    \ deformation. The LIG structure was torn and ﬁnally broke\nduring plastic deformation.\
    \ As shown in Fig. 4b, the effect of\ndifferent prestrains (0%, 30%, 50%, 100%\
    \ and 200%) on the\neffective strain sensing ranges of the AWS sensor was investi-\n\
    gated. Compared with the strain sensing range of planar sensor\n(0% prestrain),\
    \ the ASW sensors (30%–200% prestrains) show\nFig. 4\nElectromechanical performance.\

    \ increases\nfrom 30% to 200%, the strain sensing range decrease from 240%\nto\
    \ 66%. This is because the larger prestrain results in more helices\nwith smaller\
    \ curvature, which leads to the decrease of elastic\ndeformation range and the\
    \ earlier occurrence of plastic deforma-\ntion (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Therefore,\
    \ the mechanical properties\nof the spiral structure can be tuned by prestrain.\
    \ The speciﬁc\nmechanism can be explained by the tendril curvature expres-\nsion19:\n\
    k ¼\n6ε 1 þ m\nð\nÞ2\nðt1 þ t2\nÞ 3 1 þ m\nð\nÞ2þ 1 þ mn\nð\nÞ m2 þ 1\nmn\n\x01\
    \n\x03\nh\ni\n(1)\nWhere ε is prestrain, and t1 and t2 are the thickness of the\
    \ upper\nand lower Ecoﬂex ﬁlm, respectively. And m = t1/t2, and n = E1/E2\n(E1\
    \ and E2 are the young’s modulus of the upper and lower Ecoﬂex\nﬁlm, respectively).\
    \ In this study, the t1, t2, E1, E2, m and n are\nconstant. Therefore, the initial\
    \ curvature of the tendril is mainly\ndetermined by the prestrain. The effects\
    \ of prestrain on the elastic\nmodulus (E) of helical structure was evaluated\
    \ (Fig. 4c). The slope\nof the approximate linear part of the strain-stress curve\
    \ is the\nelastic modulus of tendril obtained45. The results show that in the\n\
    prestrain range of 30% to 200%, the elastic modulus increases as\nthe prestrain\
    \ increases. The elastic modulus corresponding to\n30%, 50% and 100% of prestrain\
    \ is 0.006, 0.02, and 0.078 MPa,\nwhich is far less than the turgor of plant cells\
    \ (0.2–1.0 MPa)46.\nTherefore, the pretension generated by the AWS sensor wrapped\n\
    around the stem of plants will not affect the normal growth of\nplants. Supplementary\
    \ Fig. 5b shows the reversible response of\nthe AWS sensor (Prepared under prestrain\
    \ of 100%, and its\neffective strain is about 150%) under various strains from\
    \ 1% to\n100%. For different strains, the sensor displays reversible and\nincreased\
    \ responses with the increase of strain (The impurity peak\nof 1% and 5% might\
    \ be caused by the vibration from the sudden\nstop of ﬁxture). In addition, the\
    \ repeated responses of the sensor\nwere recorded with strains of 60% for 8000\
    \ s (Supplementary Fig.\n5c), and the sensor remains stable and exhibits excellent\n\
    durability. A downward drift in peak value of the resistance\nvariation rate (ΔR/R0)\
    \ was observed in initial few cycles. This might\nbe due to the construction of\
    \ new conductive networks and\nsubsequent formation of an equilibrium state of\
    \ the conductive\nnetworks during the cyclic loading and unloading47.\nSensing\
    \ mechanism\nIn this study, the sensing mechanism of the AWS sensor was\ninvestigated\
    \ by using static simulation (Fig. 4d, e) and dynamic\nsimulation (Fig. 4f, g)\
    \ methods. The relative mechanism is\nexhibited in Fig. 4h. The sensor’s responses\
    \ to glass rods with\ndifferent diameters (2, 3, 5, 7 and 10 mm) were investigated\
    \ in the\nstatic simulation (Fig. 4d). As shown in Fig. 4e, the resistance\nvariation\
    \ rate increases with the increase of the glass rod\ndiameter, and there is a\
    \ good linear relationship between the\nresistance variation rate of the sensor\
    \ and the glass rod diameter\n(R2 = 0.9934). This is likely to be that the decreasing\
    \ glass rod\ndiameter leads to the increasing of sensor’s curvature, and 3D\n\
    porous graphene structure is more compressed (Fig. 4h). In the\ndynamic simulation,\
    \ a 5 mL syringe wrapped with AWS sensor was\nﬁxed on an automatic sample injection\
    \ pump. The injection pump\nslowly pushed the syringe piston. When the piston\
    \ passed, a tiny\nexpansion about 100 µm occurred (Fig. 4f). As a result, the\n\
    expansion leads to the decrease of curvature, and parts of the\ncompressed 3D\
    \ porous graphene structure is released, which\nincreases the electrical resistance\
    \ (Fig. 4h). The responses of the\nstraight-patterned graphene sensor and the\
    \ serpentine-patterned\nsensor are compared (Fig. 4g), and it is found that the\
    \ serpentine-\npatterned one is less sensitive than that of straight-patterned\
    \ one,\nwhich is due to that the serpentine structure can absorb the strain\n\
    caused by the mechanical deformation48.\nAnti-environmental interference performance\n\
    The growth of plants requires speciﬁc environmental conditions,\nsuch as adequate\
    \ light, appropriate humidity, and temperature\ndifferences. Therefore, unlike\
    \ other wearable sensors for animals\nand human beings, the impact of environmental\
    \ factors on the\nperformance of plant wearable sensors must be considered. In\n\
    this study, the inﬂuence of temperature, humidity, and light on\nthe sensor performance\
    \ were investigated. The AWS sensor\nwrapped around on a glass rod and was tested\
    \ in an artiﬁcial\nclimate box.\nWhen the temperature rises, the thermal expansion\
    \ of Ecoﬂex\nﬁlm results in the formation of microcracks in the conductive\nnetwork,\
    \ which lengthens the conductive channels, and increases\nthe electrical resistance\
    \ (Fig. 5a). In order to enhance sensor’s\ntemperature resistance, the LIG pattern\
    \ is designed to be\nserpentine for AWS sensor, since the serpentine structure\
    \ can\nabsorb the strain caused by the thermal expansion of the Ecoﬂex\nﬁlm48,49.\
    \ As shown in Fig. 5b, compared with the straight-\npatterned AWS sensor, serpentine-patterned\
    \ AWS sensor exhibits\nhigher thermal stability. Typically, greenhouse crops,\
    \ such as\ntomatoes, grow at temperatures from 15 to 30 °C. In the range of\n\
    15–30 °C, the temperature coefﬁcient of resistance (TCR) is applied\nto estimate\
    \ sensor’s resistance to temperature. The TCR can be\nobtained by the formula:\n\
    TCR ¼\n1\nRðT0Þ\nRðTÞ \x02 RðT0Þ\nT \x02 T0\n(2)\nWhere R(T) and R(T0) are the\
    \ resistance at 30 °C and 15 °C,\nrespectively. The results show that the TCR\
    \ of the serpentine-\npatterned AWS sensor is 0.17/°C, which is much less than\
    \ that of\nstraight-patterned\nAWS\nsensor\n(1.15/°C).\nTherefore,\nthe\nserpentine-patterned\
    \ design can be used to reduce the tempera-\nture interference to the AWS sensor.\
    \ As shown in Fig. 5c, d, in the\nhumidity range of 55–65% and illumination range\
    \ of 0-8 klx, both\nthe resistance responses of two patterned sensors are not\n\
    interfered. All these demonstrate that the AWS sensor with\nserpentine-patterned\
    \ LIG possesses excellent anti-interference\nability, which is signiﬁcant for\
    \ plant wearable sensor to monitor\nplant behavior under complex ﬁeld conditions.\n\
    In vivo monitoring of plant pulse\nAs shown in Fig. 6a, the AWS sensor can adaptively\
    \ wrap around\nthe tomato stem without any paste or adhesive. When the\ntranspiration\
    \ rate of plant is higher than the water absorption rate\nof root, the stem shrinks.\
    \ Instead, the stem expands. Therefore, the\npulse of tomato can be used to reﬂect\
    \ the water status. By\nincorporating the AWS sensor into the IPWS, the response\
    \ signal\ncan be transmitted to smart phone wirelessly. A series of tomato\nseedlings\
    \ with a height of 25 cm were used for in vivo monitoring.\nAs shown in Fig. 6b,\
    \ the IPWS was used to monitor the stem\ndiameter variations (SDV) of tomato seeding\
    \ at 15 cm above the\nground. A commercial LVDT sensor as a reference sensor,\
    \ was\nused to verify the practicability and accuracy of IPWS. The LVDT\nsensor\
    \ was ﬁxed on the tomato seeding stem (at 10 cm above the\nground) with rubber\
    \ band, and kept stable with another holder,\nwhich is quite difﬁcult for the\
    \ tomato seedlings. In addition, the\nLVDT sensor cannot be ﬁxed on the crooked\
    \ and tenuous stem. In\ncontrast, the IPWS can be installed simply on any stem\
    \ of tomato\nwithout any rubber band or adhesive tape (Fig. 6b).\nThe tomato stem\
    \ was monitored for 11 days by IPWS and\nreference sensor in an artiﬁcial climate\
    \ box. Figure 6c shows the\nreal-time monitoring curve of SDV within 11 days,\
    \ with data being\nrecorded every 10 seconds. The overall SDV shows a regularity\
    \ of\nC. Zhang et al.\n5\nPublished in partnership with Nanjing Tech University\n\
    npj Flexible Electronics (2022)  43 \npulse with an increasing trend, and IPWS\
    \ is consistent with the\nresponse trend of reference sensor. Taking the monitoring\
    \ data of\nthe 2nd day as an example (Fig. 6d), the day-night expansion and\n\
    shrink of tomato stem was investigated. We noticed that the\ngrowth time of tomato\
    \ is mainly at night. In daytime, the SDV and\nresistance variation rate tends\
    \ to be stable. This is due to the fact\nthat the transpiration rate of plants\
    \ is almost equal with the water\nabsorption rate of roots. The SDV and resistance\
    \ variation rate\nincreases, which is due to the fact that the transpiration rate\
    \ of the\ntomato at night is lower than the water absorption rate of roots.\n\
    Meanwhile, the soil moisture sensor was used to record the\nchange of relative\
    \ soil moisture content (RSWC) during the\nmonitoring (Fig. 6e). The initial soil\
    \ moisture was 50% and\ndropped to 8% on the 8th day. After watering, the soil\
    \ moisture\nwas recovered. Combining with the soil moisture, the daily\naverage\
    \ responses of the two sensors are compared, and the\nconsistent trends are exhibited.\
    \ It is found that the growth rate of\nSDV slows down, when the soil moisture\
    \ is lower than 30%. The\nclosed stomata under the 24% soil moisture also demonstrates\
    \ the\noccurrence of drought stress (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b). After soil\nmoisture\
    \ is recovered, the growth rate of SDV increases, and the\nstomata opened (Supplementary\
    \ Fig. 6c, d).\nAs shown in Fig. 6f, the minimum growth rate of SDV obtained\n\
    from IPWS and reference sensor is appeared on the 8th day and 9th\nday, respectively.\
    \ The difference of minimum growth rate\nobtained from the IPWS and reference\
    \ sensor may be caused by\nthe different locations of the sensors. After increasing\
    \ the soil\nmoisture on the 10th day and 11th day, the growth rate increased.\n\
    In addition, linear ﬁtting was carried out between the SDV\nmeasured by the reference\
    \ sensor and the resistance variation rate\nmeasured by IPWS (Fig. 6g). It is\
    \ found that there is a good linear\nrelationship between the resistance variation\
    \ rate and the SDV of\ntomato stem (R2 = 0.9196). Therefore, the IPWS can reveal\
    \ the\nexpansion and shrink of tomato stem to reﬂect the water status of\nthe\
    \ tomato.\nDISCUSSION\nIn summary, an IPWS based on AWS sensor for plant pulse\n\
    monitoring was developed. The AWS sensor can adaptively wrap\non the stem without\
    \ affecting the normal expansion and shrink of\nthe stem due to the biomimetic\
    \ tendril structure. Importantly,\nAWS\nsensor\nwith\nserpentine-patterned\nLIG\n\
    exhibited\nthe\nenhanced resistance to thermal expansion strain induced by the\n\
    environmental temperature as compared the one using straight-\npatterned LIG.\
    \ Results demonstrate the IPWS can monitor the\nexpansion and shrink of plant\
    \ stem wirelessly, and reﬂect the\ngrowth and water state of tomato in real time.\
    \ This work is\nsigniﬁcant for the continuous monitoring of plant pulse and also\n\
    provides a reference for development of robust plant wearable\nsensor. In the\
    \ future, the sensor should be integrated with cloud\ncomputing, and feeds the\
    \ monitoring information back to\nprecision irrigation equipment to guide agricultural\

    \ was purchased from Ningbo Safe\nExperimental Apparatus Co., Ltd, China.\nPreparation\
    \ of PR ﬁlm\nThe PR precursor solution consisted with PR and FeCl3 was prepared\
    \ as\nprevious reports50. 5 g PR powder were dissolved in 10 mL ethanol,\nfollowed\
    \ by adding 20 mg FeCl3 and ultrasonic dissolution. The precursor\nsolution should\
    \ be prepared when it is in need due to the strong\nhygroscopicity of FeCl3. The\
    \ PR ﬁlm was prepared on a PDMS substrate.\nThe precursor solution was covered\

    \ followed by a spin-coating\nprocess at a speed of 900 rpm min‒1 for 40 s. The\
    \ obtained PR ﬁlm was\ndried at room temperature for the following laser inducing\
    \ procedure.\nFabrication of AWS sensor\nThe fabrication of AWS sensor contains\
    \ three procedures. Firstly, the\nfabrication of LIG. The laser power (2.2, 2.5,\
    \ and 2.8 W) and laser scan speed\n(16, 27, and 80 cm s‒1) were used to prepare\
    \ LIG with different\nmorphologies. The redundant PR ﬁlm was rinsed with ethanol\
    \ and water\nrepeatedly to obtain the patterned LIG. Secondly, transferring patterned\n\
    LIG to the Ecoﬂex ﬁlm. Ecoﬂex liquid precursor silicone was prepared by\nmixing\
    \ the component A and B as a ratio of 1:1. The silicone was injected\non the surface\
    \ of patterned LIG with 30 s of equilibrium. A spin coating\nprocedure was applied\
    \ at a speed of 600 rpm min‒1 for 60 s to form the\nhomogeneous Ecoﬂex ﬁlm. After\
    \ curing for 1 h at room temperature, the\ncured Ecoﬂex ﬁlm was peeled off carefully\
    \ to obtain the Ecoﬂex/LIG\nstructure. The copper wires were pasted on both ends\
    \ of the patterned LIG\nwith conductive silver paste to form Ecoﬂex/LIG electrode.\
    \ Finally, the\nfabrication of AWS sensor. Ecoﬂex/LIG electrode was ﬂipped over,\
    \ and\npasted on the prestretched Ecoﬂex ﬁlm with prestrain of 0%, 30%, 50%,\n\
    100%, and 200%. Back of electrode was encapsulated by spin coating\nEcoﬂex liquid\
    \ precursor silicone and curing at room temperature to form a\nsandwich structure.\

  title: An integrated and robust plant pulse monitoring system based on biomimetic
    wearable sensor
  verbatim_quote1: '"This paper provides a novel, reliable, and practical approach
    to develop an integrated and robust plant pulse monitoring system (IPWS) based
    on an adaptive winding strain (AWS) sensor. The IPWS is designed to wirelessly
    and accurately monitor the plant pulse to diagnose the growth and water state
    of tomato plants by analyzing the expansion and shrinking behavior of the plant
    stem."'
  verbatim_quote2: '"The AWS sensor is designed to adaptively wrap around the tomato
    stem without any adhesives or tape, which allows for easy fixation and prevents
    damage to the plant. The AWS sensor utilizes a serpentine-patterned laser-induced
    graphene (LIG) structure, which significantly enhances its resistance to temperature
    interference. This makes the sensor suitable for long-term and anti-interference
    monitoring of plant pulse even in varying environmental conditions."'

  analysis: 'The paper titled "Applications of Internet of Things in the Facility
    Agriculture" provides a comprehensive overview of the role and applications of
    Internet of Things (IoT) technology in managing different types of data pertaining
    to facility agriculture. While the paper does not explicitly address the specific
    point outlined in the review intention - "Types of data most applicable to irrigation
    management and their typical sources" - it does provide valuable insights into
    the types of data that are relevant for facility agriculture management, including
    meteorological, environmental, and soil parameters. These parameters can also
    be applied to the domain of irrigation management, making the paper moderately
    relevant to the given review intention.


    The paper discusses the use of sensors and wireless sensor networks in collecting
    data from the environment, soil, and crops, which can be used for real-time monitoring,
    analysis, and automated control of various aspects of facility agriculture. While
    the paper focuses on a broader context of facility agriculture, the data types
    and their sources discussed in the paper have direct implications for irrigation
    management as well.'

    \ paper, we give solutions and key technologies of facilities \nagriculture based\
    \ on the Internet of Things technology. On this basis it designs \nand implements\
    \ facility cultivation greenhouses. Practice has proved that the \nInternet of\
    \ Things is the development of modern agriculture productivity. It has \nan important\
    \ significance in raising the level of agricultural development, \nimproving the\
    \ overall efficiency of agriculture, promoting the upgrade of \nmodern agricultural\
    \ transformation. \nKeywords: Internet of Things, agricultural facilities, wireless\
    \ sensing, \nintelligent control. \n1 \nIntroduction \nFacilities agriculture\
    \ is a new agricultural industry which has a high degree of \nintensification.\
    \ It is an important part of modern agriculture. In recent years, the \ntechnology\
    \ of Internet of Things which continues to evolve and mature has injected \nnew\
    \ vitality into the development of agricultural facilities. IntelliSense chips,\
    \ mobile \nembedded systems such as the Internet of Things technology in modern\
    \ agriculture \nare gradually widened. Using wireless sensor networks can reduce\
    \ the impact of \nhuman consumption and the farmland environment. Extensive use\
    \ of automation, \nintelligent remote-controlled production equipment can obtain\
    \ accurate crop and crop \ninformation. Through these, people who stay at home\
    \ can monitor a variety of field \ninformation. This can achieve the scientific\
    \ cultivation, scientific monitoring and \nproduction management and promote modern\
    \ agriculture development pattern. \n2 \nThe Design of facility Agricultural Based\
    \ on Internet of \nThings  \nThe facility agricultural system based on the Internet\
    \ of Things technology is divided \ninto three levels: the perception layer, transport\
    \ layer and application layer. Perception \n298 \nL. Zhou et al. \nlayer is mainly\
    \ responsible for data-aware acquisition; the transport layer is mainly \nresponsible\
    \ for the perception of data transmission; application layer is mainly \nresponsible\
    \ for sensing data analysis, statistics, and early warning, automatic control\
    \ \nand scientific decision-making. Fig.1 shows the overall architecture diagram\
    \ of the \nfacility agriculture. \n \nFig. 1. The architecture diagram of facility\
    \ agriculture \n2.1 \nData Perception and Acquisition \nInformation sensing technology\
    \ of facility agricultural is stressed that the perception \nof intelligence and\
    \ automation of information. Perception information should be \nprocessed intelligently\
    \ and transported wirelessly. The Facility agricultural \ninformation has high\
    \ demand to the perception and perception equipment. They must \nenable quick\
    \ determination of the object, but also need to have a dynamic, continuous \n\
    determination of the characteristics of the wireless sensing and wireless transmission.\
    \ \nThe sensing devices need to have the characteristics of micro, reliability,\
    \ energy-\nsaving, environmental adaptability, low cost and intelligent. Information-aware\
    \ \ntechnology can be used for soil parameters, the continuous monitoring of plant\
    \ \nnutrients, and the fast dynamic of the environmental parameters. \n \nApplications\
    \ of Internet of Things in the Facility Agriculture \n299 \n2.2 \nWireless Sensor\
    \ Networks \nWireless sensor networks include wireless sensor nodes, sink nodes,\
    \ the routing node, \nthe central base station, network data server and remote\
    \ access node. Sensor node is \nresponsible for the collection, a variety of soil\
    \ and environmental parameters of the \nstorage location. These parameters include\
    \ air temperature, humidity, sunshine \nintensity, soil temperature, moisture,\
    \ PH value. Sensor node sends data to the sink \nnode through a variety of means\
    \ of communication. Aggregation node is responsible \nfor data collection, filtering\
    \ and storage in wireless sensor clusters, and to \ncommunicate with the wireless\
    \ routing nodes forward data timely. \n2.3 \nApplication of Decision-Making Platform\
    \  \nApplication of decision-making platform includes the intelligent processing\
    \ of \ninformation, cloud storage and application. Facility agriculture in the\
    \ prenatal, \ndelivery, postpartum industrial chain, relying on the cloud application\
    \ service \nplatform for the base production, the platform needs to be developed\
    \ greenhouse \nenvironment control systems, fertilizer drug control management\
    \ system, pest and \ndisease monitoring and early warning systems, agricultural\
    \ quality of the distribution \nprocess safety monitoring system. For government\
    \ decision-making, technical \nguidance to farmers, public consumption and other\
    \ aspects of the platform required \nthe development and application of centralized\
    \ display system, pests and diseases of \nthe joint prevention and control command\
    \ and decision system, remote expert \nguidance systems, facilities, vegetables,\
    \ green resume system, etc..  \n3 \nThe Key Technologies of Facility Agriculture\
    \  \n3.1 \nRFID Technology \nFacility agricultural system has a large number of\
    \ device management and remote \ncontrol, you need to effectively identify and\
    \ distinguish the equipment. Uniquely \nidentify and read by the RFID technology,\
    \ together with the GPS positioning method \ncan control and manage the equipment\
    \ location of Things, so as to achieve the \npurpose of the overall perception\
    \ and intelligent control. There are more RFID \nproducts, but only fewer products\
    \ for facility agricultural use. \n3.2 \nSensor Technology \nThe sensors are the\
    \ eyes and ears of the information age; the sensor has a wide \napplication in\
    \ facility agriculture. The sensors can monitor the environmental \nconditions\
    \ of the crop and the dynamic data which got through the facilities \nintervention.\
    \ Commonly used sensors of agricultural facility include light sensors, \ntemperature\
    \ and humidity sensors, pressure-sensitive (fluid) sensor, CO2 sensor, the \n\
    value of the sensor, as well as plant growth characteristics of sensors and other\
    \ \nsensors. \n300 \nL. Zhou et al. \n3.3 \nAutomation Technology \nFacility agricultural\
    \ needs automation technology for environmental regulation. \nAccording to the\
    \ set of environmental conditions the system get control of  \ngreenhouse fertilization,\
    \ irrigation, opening and closing doors and windows, lifting \nmoderate light\
    \ adjustments and others through the controlling system and execution \nsystem.\
    \ The nature of the automation technology is mechatronics, controller and \nexecutive\
    \ body is the core of the automation technology. Automation technology is \nthe\
    \ traditional industries; the development is already quite mature. Equipment \n\
    intelligent control has been achieved. Development of automation technology which\
    \ \ngreatly improves labor productivity, and contributed to improve the system\
    \ closed-\nloop control of the Internet of Things has been developing rapidly\
    \ in a wide range of \nneeds. \n3.4 \nWireless Data Transmission Technology \n\
    With the development of information technology, the wireless transmission \ntechnology\
    \ has been developing rapidly. ZigBee technology occupies a dominant \nposition.\
    \ ZigBee technology is a unified standard, short-range \nwireless \ncommunications\
    \ technology, with the characteristics of low power, low cost and \nversatility.\
    \ WIFI has a high transmission rate, transmission distance and cover a wide \n\
    range of features; it is widely used in data transmission in computer networks\
    \ and \nmobile communications. GPRS and 3G digital communications technology has\
    \ begun \nto be applied in the field of agricultural facility. It has a stable\
    \ network; the terminal \nprice is low and the maturity of the technology and\
    \ other advantages.  \n3.5 \nIntelligent Information Processing Technology \n\
    Intelligent information processing system has been used in the field of agricultural\
    \ \nfacilities, real-time control of the parameters of the environmental temperature\
    \ and \nhumidity, light, fertilizer and liquid level. The development of cloud\
    \ computing has \ninjected new elements for facilities management in agriculture.\
    \ \n4 \nImplementation of the Facility Agriculture Project  \nOn the basis of\
    \ the research of facility agricultural structure and key technologies, \nsensing\
    \ technology, infinite communication technology, computer network \ntechnology,\
    \ agricultural resources, database technology, Internet of Things \ntechnology\
    \ were used to build management technology platform for facility \nagriculture.\
    \ It develops intelligent, accurate scientific production management for the \n\
    majority of cooperatives, grower, facilities and agricultural enterprises and\
    \ other \nusers. Developed science intelligent precision operation scheme can\
    \ make reasonable \nuse of resources; improve product yield and efficiency; and\
    \ improve the quality of \nagricultural products so as to enhance the market competitiveness\
    \ of industry \nstandards and product. Fig.2 shows the function and structure\
    \ of facility agriculture. \n \nApplications of Internet of Things in the Facility\
    \ Agriculture \n301 \n \nFig. 2. The function and structure of facility agriculture\
    \ \n4.1 \nGreenhouse Environment Monitoring System \nAccording to the facilities\
    \ greenhouse cultivation of environmental conditions, we \nselected major environmental\
    \ impact factor parameter detection. These parameters \ninclude meteorological\
    \ parameters (light, temperature, humidity), environmental \nparameters (CO 2\
    \ and harmful gases such as ammonia, nitrous acid gas, CO, etc.), soil \nparameters\
    \ (temperature, humidity and pH, EC, soil composition).The environmental \ninformation\
    \ within the greenhouse which gets by the integration of multiple sensors is \n\
    sent to the smart processing platform by wireless sensor networks. It provides\
    \ data \nsupport for agricultural decision-making. Greenhouse intelligent monitoring\
    \ system is \ncomposed by the host computer, acquisition controller, network adapter,\
    \ sensors, \noutdoor weather stations, and video capture equipment, and other\
    \ components. \nA host computer can connect multiple Acquisition Controllers and\
    \ Acquisition \nControllers connect the various sensors and control equipment\
    \ to form a separate \n302 \nL. Zhou et al. \nacquisition and control unit. Acquisition\
    \ and control unit connected to the bus \nstructure on the network communicate\
    \ with the host computer independently. It \ncontrols the system remotely through\
    \ the cable and the Internet way; regulates the \ntemperature, light, ventilation,\
    \ carbon dioxide supply, the supply and pH of the \nnutrient solution value, EC\
    \ values. \nWireless sensor networks use hierarchical network structure, and a\
    \ single \ngreenhouse is a measurement of the wireless sensor network control\
    \ area. Sensor \nnodes and control nodes in the network are self-organization;\
    \ information is passed \nbetween nodes using multiple routes agreement. Data\
    \ from all sensor nodes via a \ngateway to reach the control center, the feedback\
    \ for greenhouse environment control \ninformation reaches the control node through\
    \ the gateway. Control information \ncontrols valves, fans, temperature and other\
    \ equipments to achieve the wireless \nmonitoring and control of greenhouse environment.\
    \ Fig.3 shows The greenhouses \nintelligent planting schematic. \n \nFig. 3. The\
    \ greenhouses intelligent planting schematic \n4.2 \nDigital Management System\
    \ for Facility Agriculture \nDigital management technology analyzes intelligently\
    \ the collected information; \ngrasps all aspects of animal and plant growth status\
    \ and makes decisions. The main \ncontents are: monitoring, collection, processing\
    \ and wireless transmission important \nenvironmental factors about vegetable\
    \ growth; collecting data about facility vegetable \ngrowth; Modeling the growth\
    \ simulation and optimization. \nThis system enables the query and distribution\
    \ of agricultural information, the \nexpert decision the Knowledge optimizes decision-making\
    \ and analysis. It can \nachieve the efficient integration of information technology\
    \ and network, and ultimate \nrealize the agricultural precise digital control\
    \ management. \n \nApplications of Internet of Things in the Facility Agriculture\
    \ \n303 \n5 \nSummary \nIt is a trend to use information technology to lead the\
    \ development of modern agriculture. \nThe IntelliSense Internet of Things will\
    \ be an important support for intensive, high-yield, \nhigh-quality, efficient,\
    \ ecological security agriculture. Agricultural facilities can be  \ntime-out\
    \ order-season production, improve land productivity, resource utilization and\
    \ \nlabor productivity. It has an important meaning for overcoming the bottleneck\
    \ of \nresources and the environment of the agricultural development, transforming\
    \  \nagricultural development, and enhancing the competitiveness of agriculture.\
    \ \nAs a comprehensive application of technology in different disciplines, facility\
    \ \nagricultural based on Internet of Things technology integrates a variety of\
    \ \ntechnologies such as sensor, automation, communications, computer and animal\
    \ plant \nsciences. It can be predicted that facility agricultural will have a\
    \ rapid development in \nthe promotion of agricultural machinery, sensors, information\
    \ and communications \nand cloud computing technologies. It will play a major\
    \ role to improve the overall \nefficiency of agriculture, promote the upgrade\
    \ of modern agricultural transformation. \n \nAcknowledgments. This study is financially\

  analysis: 'Based on a 3-year long dataset obtained from a large-scale soil moisture
    monitoring network in the upper reach of the Heihe River Watershed, we quantitatively
    analyzed the patterns of the profile soil moisture dynamic response for different
    land covers from its response amplitude, response rate and time. The main findings
    are:

    (1) The scrubland, MCG and barren land have a slightly dampened soil moisture
    response amplitude along the soil profile, while the meadow and HCG have a heavily
    dampened response amplitude. The rate of soil moisture increases reduced significantly
    with depth for all the land covers, except for the HCG.

    (2) The different land covers have significantly different temporal patterns of
    the profile soil moisture dynamics response. The vertical variation of transmit
    time for the wetting front advancing through the adjacent layers coincides with
    the extent of the root zone for the different land covers. In addition, soil wetting
    events can last from hours to weeks for different soil layers of different land
    covers.

    (3) Preferential flow occurred mostly in soils covered by scrubland.

    (4) Overall, scrubland has an evenly distributed soil moisture retention capacity
    along the profile, whereas the major soil moisture retention capacity is concentrated
    in the top soil for other land covers, especially the meadow. The water transferability
    was found to be higher in deeply rooted soil.

    (5) After separating the influence of plant parameters and soil properties on
    profile patterns of soil wetting events, soil hydraulic properties was found to
    be the key factors explaining the observed differences in soil moisture responses.

    The indices used in this study can be used to quantitatively describe the patterns
    of profile soil moisture dynamics for different land covers, and to provide new
    insights into the different soil hydrological regimes under different land covers.
    They can also supply important information for effective model parameterization
    and validation, and thus improving ecohydrological modelling studies in data-scarce
    mountainous watersheds.'

    Get rights and content Highlights • Response amplitudes are different for meadow,
    HCG and MCG, while similar for others. • Rate of wetting event reduced significantly
    with depth for all land covers except HCG. • Temporal patterns of soil wetting
    event varied greatly along depths and land covers. • Preferential flow occurred
    mostly in soils covered by scrubland. • Soil hydraulic properties are key factors
    in regulating soil wetting events. Abstract Understanding the dynamic response
    of soil moisture to rainfall is critical for hydrological modelling in arid and
    semi-arid basins. However, little is known about rainfall-related soil moisture
    dynamics in arid high-altitude mountainous areas due to the absence of long-term
    high-resolution soil moisture observations. In this study, we investigated the
    dynamic response processes of profile soil moisture using data from a soil moisture
    monitoring network in the Qilian Mountains established in 2013 covering altitudes
    from 2,000–5,000 m a.s.l. To investigate the effects of different land covers
    on soil moisture response, we selected data from eight soil moisture stations
    with the same soil textural class and slope, but different land covers (scrubland,
    meadow, high coverage grassland (HCG), medium coverage grassland (MCG) and barren
    land). Several indices were evaluated to quantitatively describe soil moisture
    dynamics during the growing seasons of 2014–2016 based on soil wetting events.
    In addition, HYDRUS-1D simulations were used to further analyze the effect of
    land cover on soil moisture dynamics. Our results showed that soil moisture response
    amplitudes along profile are similar under MCG and barren land, but significantly
    different under scrubland, meadow and HCG. The rate of soil moisture increment
    decreased significantly with depth for all land covers, except for the HCG. The
    temporal pattern of soil moisture increase was highly variable along the soil
    profiles depending on land cover type. In particular, the difference of response
    time between the adjacent layers varied from negative values to 280 h with depth.
    Preferential flow occurred mostly in soils covered by scrubland. Water transferability
    was higher in deeply rooted soil. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis indicated
    that soil hydraulic properties are key factors in regulating profile soil wetting
    events. Our results show that the soil moisture response indices are useful to
    quantitatively characterize patterns in profile soil moisture dynamics, and provide
    new insights into the soil moisture profile wetting process (e.g. occurrence of
    preferential flow etc.), which helps for effective model parameterization and
    validation, in turn improving hydrological modelling in arid high-altitude mountainous
    areas. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Soil moisture

    1. Introduction Mountain areas are the “water towers” of the world because of
    their importance in providing water resources for downstream areas (Immerzeel
    et al., 2010). Mountain areas provide up to 95% of the freshwater supply in some
    areas (Liniger et al., 1998), such as the arid and semiarid watersheds in northwestern
    China (Cheng et al., 2014). Soil moisture is an essential variable in hydrology,
    meteorology, agriculture, and ecology (Western et al., 2004; Seneviratne et al.,
    2010; Jung et al., 2010). Soil moisture and its dynamic response to rainfall control
    the interaction among the hydrological processes of precipitation, infiltration,
    evapotranspiration, runoff and drainage (Koster et al., 2004; Zehe et al., 2005;
    Wang et al., 2012a; Farrick and Branfireun, 2014; Vereecken et al., 2015). Thus,
    knowledge about the processes driving rainfall-related soil moisture dynamics
    is essential to understand the mechanisms of rainfall-runoff processes, and to
    improve land surface and hydrological modeling, especially in data-scarce mountainous
    catchments (Blume et al., 2009; He et al., 2012; McDonnell and Beven, 2014). In
    recent years, mountain areas have received growing attention in the context of
    climate change and adaptation studies and water resources management (Lutz et
    al., 2014; Chen et al., 2016; Ran et al., 2018). However, the dynamics of soil
    moisture response to rainfall is still poorly investigated in high mountain areas
    (He et al., 2012; Pellet and Hauck, 2017). For example, many studies have focused
    on understanding the soil moisture response to rainfall. Most of these studies
    explored the dynamic response through qualitative description of time series of
    soil moisture (Kim et al., 2009; Li et al., 2013a; Yu et al., 2015) and descriptive
    statistics for the specific status of soil moisture (e.g. probability distributions
    (Laio et al., 2001; Liu et al., 2015), and standard deviation (Rosenbaum et al.,
    2012; Brocca et al., 2014)). A process-based understanding of soil moisture response
    to rainfall remains incomplete and is urgently needed for advancing ecohydrological
    and critical zone modelling (Green and Erskine, 2011; Clark et al., 2017; Li et
    al., 2017; Guo and Lin, 2018). Moreover, quantification of soil moisture response
    processes using continuous in-situ monitoring data at different depths with high
    temporal resolution can provide alternative metrics for process-based soil hydrological
    model evaluation (Green and Erskine, 2011; Wiekenkamp et al., 2016; Guo and Lin,
    2018). Land cover change is known to have strong influence on soil moisture dynamics
    after rainfall by altering interception (Laio et al., 2001; Li et al., 2013a),
    infiltration (Rossi et al., 2018; Liang et al., 2011; Brooks et al., 2015), plant
    water uptake (He et al., 2013; Kurc and Small, 2004), and evaporation processes
    (Farmer et al., 2003; Jian et al., 2015). However, uncertainty remains about the
    soil water response regime for land cover types under different conditions (Moran
    et al., 2010; Li et al., 2013a; 2018b). For example, many studies showed a more
    dynamic soil moisture response regime under grassland than scrubland or woodland
    (Wang et al., 2013, 2008; Yu et al., 2017; Lozano-Parra et al., 2015; Li et al.,
    2013a). Other studies, however, showed a more dynamic response regime under scrubland
    or woodland than grassland (Jin et al., 2018; Li et al., 2013a; Liang et al.,
    2011), and some studies also found similar response patterns for different land
    covers (Moran et al., 2010; He et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2014). Furthermore, understanding
    of profile soil moisture response processes during and after rainfall is still
    unclear (Jin et al., 2018), which is vital for the detection and understanding
    of subsurface flow (Green and Erskine, 2011; Wiekenkamp et al., 2016; Guo and
    Lin, 2018) and runoff generation (Blume et al., 2009; Kim, 2009). The response
    regimes under different land covers are particularly poorly understood in data-scarce
    mountainous areas due to the difficulties of installing and maintaining long-term
    profile soil moisture monitoring networks with high time resolution (Pellet and
    Hauck, 2017; Viviroli et al., 2011). Amongst the numerous established long-term
    soil moisture monitoring networks (e.g. Dorigo et al., 2011; Ochsner et al., 2013;
    Quiring et al., 2016; Gasch et al., 2017), only a few networks have been established
    in high and cold mountain areas (Su et al., 2011; Pellet and Hauck, 2017; Li et
    al., 2013b, 2018). Only a few studies have focused on rainfall-related soil moisture
    dynamics processes for land cover types at small scale in the high and cold mountain
    areas (He et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2017). Meanwhile, the transfer
    of small-scale information to larger scales remains very challenging due to the
    high heterogeneity of soil moisture in topographically complex mountainous areas
    (Brocca et al., 2010; Thompson et al., 2011; Famiglietti et al., 2008). Within
    this context, the aim of this study is to quantitatively describe the patterns
    of rainfall-related profile soil moisture response processes for typical land
    covers in a high-altitude, topographically complex alpine region using data from
    a long-term large-scale soil moisture monitoring network. The results are expected
    to shed insights into rainfall-related profile soil hydrological processes under
    typical land covers, and to provide important reference values for key parameters
    in large scale hydrological modelling and water resources management in arid and
    semi-arid watersheds. 2. Study area, datasets and methods 2.1. Study area The
    Heihe River Watershed is the second largest inland river watershed (or terminal
    lake) in China (Cheng et al., 2014). The upper stream of the Heihe River Watershed
    was selected as our study area. It is located in the Qilian Mountains at the northern
    margin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau with an area of about 27 × 103 km2 (97°29′-101°32′
    E, 37°43′-39°39′ N) (Fig. 1). Mountain runoff provides almost all of the water
    for the entire watershed, sustains a population of about 121 million in the watershed,
    irrigates 2.4 × 105 hectares of farmland for maintaining one of the major grain
    production bases in China, and supports a fragile ecological system in the lower
    reach of the Heihe River (He et al., 2009; Li et al., 2015a). Download : Download

    the study area and the distribution of the soil moisture stations (SMS) (a), and
    the distribution of the selected SMS in this study, as well as the spatial distribution
    of the precipitation (annual rainfall of 2014) (b). The study area is subject
    to a temperate semi-arid and semi-humid continental monsoon climate. Most of the
    study area is located between 2,000–5,000 m above sea level (a.s.l.). Annual precipitation
    ranges from 200 mm in the steppe to 700 mm high up in the mountain ranges, and
    is characterized by a high seasonal variability with over 60% of precipitation
    falling in the summer months (Li et al., 2009). The mean annual potential evapotranspiration
    is about 700 - 2000 mm (Pan and Tian, 2001). The annual average temperature ranges
    from −3.1 °C to 3.6 °C based on the meteorological data from 1960 to 2012 (Zhang
    et al., 2016). The strong vertical difference in mean annual temperature has led
    to a distinct vertical land-cover zonation that comprises alpine meadow, grassland,
    shrub land, sparse vegetated land, and forest (Yang et al., 2015; Zhou et al.,
    2016; Feng et al., 2013). The main soil types are alpine steppe soil (FAO, Calcic
    chernozems), chestnut soil (FAO, Kastanozems), and alpine frost desert soil (FAO,
    Gelicregosols) (Li et al., 2009). The main soil textural classes in the study
    area are silt loam, silt and sandy loam (United States Department of Agriculture
    or USDA classification) (Tian et al., 2017). 2.2. Soil moisture network In order
    to investigate the influence of different environmental factors on profile soil
    moisture dynamics in the upstream of the Heihe River Watershed in the Qilian Mountain,
    a long-term monitoring network consisting of 32 soil moisture stations has been
    established since July 2013 (Fig. 1). The locations of the soil moisture stations
    were chosen to be representative of the main land cover and soil types as well
    as the different altitude levels of the study area (Jin et al., 2015; Zhang et
    al., 2017a). The network constitutes the best possible coverage of the study area
    given the constraints of steep topography, rough and dangerous road conditions,
    accessibility to the monitoring stations, as well as financial resources (Fig.
    1). At each station, a soil pit of sufficient size was dug to enable insertion
    of the soil moisture sensors in multiple depths. The combined soil moisture and
    temperature probe ECH20 5TE (Decagon Devices Inc., Pullman, USA) was installed
    horizontally at depths of 5, 15, 25, 40 and 60 cm below the soil surface. The
    5TE sensors were installed in such a way to avoid influence on the vertical water
    flow (Lozano-Parra et al., 2015). After installation, the pit was carefully refilled
    with the original soil material and compacted to the original bulk density layer
    by layer to avoid perturbations as much as possible. The soil profiles were divided
    into five layers according to the installation depths of the five sensors (layer
    1: 0–10 cm; layer 2: 10–20 cm; layer 3: 20–30 cm; layer 4: 30–50 cm; layer 5:
    50–70 cm). Soil moisture was measured at a temporal resolution of 30 min, which
    is in most cases sufficient to study soil hydrological processes (Lozano-Parra
    et al., 2015). Soil samples for each soil moisture monitoring station were collected
    during installation (more than 7 kg from each profile of each stations) and taken
    to the lab for calibration. A soil-specific calibration was carried out for each
    station following the step-by-step instruction guide in the manual provided by
    Decagon (Cobos and Chambers, 2010; Zhang et al., 2017a). Regular station maintenance
    (e.g. data collection, battery and sensor check and replacement) took place twice
    a year at the beginning of June and at the end of October. However, the large
    scale of the area and the harsh mountainous environment are challenging for soil
    moisture network maintenance. In addition, wireless data transmission was not
    possible as the study area is not covered by a mobile communication network. Therefore,
    some data gaps occurred due to battery or sensor failures and damages due to livestock
    (sheep and yaks) and rats. In order to study the soil moisture regimes under different
    land covers, we selected a subset of stations from the entire soil moisture network
    with different land covers, similar soil texture (silt loam, which is the main
    soil texture in the study area (Zhao et al., 2014; Su et al., 2011)), small slope
    (0–9°), and with data gaps smaller than 3 months in the period 2014–2016. Based
    on these criteria, eight typical soil moisture stations were selected for this
    study that included the land covers of scrubland (one soil moisture station, with
    gap from 7.2014 to 9.2014 at layer 4), meadow (one station, with gap during 6.2015
    at layer 5), high coverage grassland (two stations, with gap during 9.2014 at
    layer 1), medium coverage grassland (two stations, no gaps) and barren land (two
    stations, no gaps). The locations of the selected soil moisture stations are shown
    in Fig. 1. Additionally, Table 1 and Table A1 present the basic characteristics
    and soil properties of the soil moisture stations. Here, we analyze soil moisture
    observations from the growing seasons from May to October of 2014 to 2016 (Liu
    et al., 2015) (Fig. 2). Table 1. Basic characteristics of the selected soil moisture

    Baren1, Barren2) at soil depths of 5, 15, 25, 40, 60 cm. Gaps exist due to missing
    data. Also shown are the rainfall data (mm/d) and accumulated rainfall (mm) for
    each station. During the installation of the soil moisture sensors, undisturbed
    and disturbed soil samples were taken using metal cylinders and self-sealing bags,
    respectively. The soil samples were used to determine key soil properties for
    each soil moisture station (i.e. saturated hydraulic conductivity, soil water
    retention function, soil texture, soil bulk density and soil organic carbon content).
    Other station-related parameters include land cover type (i.e. scrubland, meadow,
    high coverage grassland, medium coverage grassland, and barren land), slope, aspect,
    slope position, and rooting depth. A detailed description of the soil properties
    is given in Tian et al. (2017). Soil water retention curves were determined using
    the centrifuge method (KOKUSAN-H-1400 pF, Kokusan Corp., Tokyo; Reatto et al.,
    2008). The total soil porosity was calculated from soil bulk density by assuming
    a particle density of 2.65 g cm−3 (McKenzie et al., 2002). The Mualem-van Genuchten
    parameters of the soil water retention curve (Van Genuchten, 1980) were fitted
    to the measured data using Matlab (MathWorks, Inc., Massachusetts) (Fig. 3). Download

    Precipitation data Rainfall observations in the Qilian Mountains are sparse (Yang
    et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2014). Therefore, we established four additional meteorological
    stations in the study area in September 2013. Furthermore, we used rainfall data
    from eight meteorological stations operated by the Heihe Ecohydrological Remote
    Sensing Experiment (http://www.heihedata.org/data). However, the representativeness
    of these meteorological stations is still limited for our study given the large
    area of the soil moisture network and the strong spatial variability of precipitation
    in the topographically complex mountainous area (Pan et al., 2014; Zhang et al.,
    2017b). Thus, the reanalysis datasets of Xiong and Yan (2013) and Zhang et al.
    (2018) (http://westdc.westgis.ac.cn) were also used in our study (Fig. 1). Throughout
    this study, the rainfall data were used as a reference in the process of identifying
    the soil moisture response events (Dorigo et al., 2013). 2.4. Data analysis It
    is assumed that water reaches a certain depth when the soil moisture content begins
    to increase after a rainfall pulse (Wang et al., 2008; Laio et al., 2001; Green
    and Erskine, 2011). Accordingly, the soil wetting process after a rainfall was
    determined and characterized using the increase of soil water content at depths
    of 5, 15, 25, 40 and 60 cm along the soil profile in this study (Lozano-Parra
    et al., 2015). Prior to the data analysis, a detailed data quality control was
    performed following the procedures of Dorigo et al. (2013); Rosenbaum et al. (2012)
    and Wiekenkamp et al. (2016). The data quality control uses rainfall information
    and the measured soil temperature data and consisted of the following steps. First,
    soil moisture data during seasonal freeze-thaw periods were excluded based on
    soil temperature data and the characteristic soil moisture dynamics in thawing
    and refreezing cycles (Dorigo et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2017, 2012b; Yang et
    al., 2017). Second, outliers were removed using quantitative plausibility checks
    (values outside of 0–90 vol. % range, spikes and unreasonable fluctuation). Third,
    unreliable data caused by technical problems (e.g. insufficient battery power)
    were eliminated by visual data inspection. Fourth, temperature effects on the
    soil moisture data were corrected based on the methods of Saito et al. (2009;
    2013), in which calibration equations were derived using daily fluctuations of
    soil water content (θ) and soil temperature (T). 2.5. Identification of soil wetting
    events In this study, we adopted the concept of soil wetting events, which are
    defined as events in which a significant increase of soil moisture as a result
    of rainfall infiltration into the soil can be observed (McMillan and Srinivasan,
    2015; Lozano-Parra et al., 2015). To this end, we determined “critical points”
    in each soil moisture time series, i.e. turning points indicating the beginning
    and end of the wetting processes (see Fig. 4), and subsequently analyzed time
    lag and extent of the soil moisture increase. The identification of the critical
    points was performed automatically using a dedicated Matlab script. Following
    Lozano-Parra et al. (2015, 2016), we defined an increase in soil moisture of more
    than 0.3% as a soil wetting event in order to consider the measurement accuracy
    of the soil moisture sensors. Furthermore, we used a period of 6 h without effective
    soil moisture increment as a separation criterion to distinguish soil wetting
    events in our study (Lozano-Parra et al., 2015, 2016). An example of a detected
    soil wetting event at two depths is presented in Fig. 4. Download : Download high-res
    image (241KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Example of the identification
    of soil moisture increment event. 2.6. Quantification of the response pattern
    of soil wetting events Based on the observed soil wetting events, we evaluated
    a set of indices to quantitatively describe the soil moisture response and to
    investigate its distribution along the soil profile for different land covers.
    In the following, we present the derivation of these indices in detail. The degree
    of soil moisture response to a rainfall event has been analyzed by numerous soil
    moisture indices. For instance, McColl et al. (2017) developed a soil moisture
    index in which only the positive soil moisture increments during a rainfall event
    are considered. On the other hand, Liang et al. (2011) analyzed the maximum change
    in soil moisture during rainfall events by summing up the positive and negative
    soil moisture increments during a rainfall event. In our analysis, we define the
    absolute accumulated increase in soil moisture at each measurement location as
    follows: (1) with (2) where , is the volumetric soil water content (vol.%) at
    the time of the rainfall event, is the measurement interval (30 min), and are
    the start and end time of the soil wetting event, and is the accumulated soil
    water increment for a soil wetting event (i.e. the ASWI derived from the event
    shown in Fig. 4 for layers 1 and 2 is 17.47% and 3.06%, respectively). ASWI was
    calculated for all soil wetting events and for all measurement locations and subsequently
    aggregated across the stations for each land cover type. In addition, we calculated
    the ratio of ASWI between adjacent soil layers (RSWI) for the corresponding soil
    wetting events as: (3) where represents the soil layer ( = 2, 3, 4, 5), are the
    accumulated soil water increments of layers and during the period of the th soil
    wetting event at layer , respectively. The RSWI of layer 2 for the event shown
    in Fig. 4 is 17.54%. The rate of soil wetting is a quantitative index which has
    been used to characterize the type of infiltration process (Lozano-Parra et al.,
    2016), and for the calibration of soil hydrology models (Green and Erskine, 2011;
    Laio et al., 2001). It considers the maximum and mean slope of the soil wetting
    curve and is based on the time derivative of the soil water increase: (4) (5)
    where and are the maximum and mean rate or slope of a soil wetting curve ( ),
    respectively. The Smax and Smean derived from the event shown in Fig. 4 for layer
    1 is 34.96 and 3.88, respectively, while they are 0.81 and 0.44 for layer 2. According
    to Sun et al. (2015), the temporal pattern of soil wetting during the infiltration
    event can be divided into the period between the start of a rainfall event and
    the start of the corresponding soil moisture response (also known as the soil
    moisture response time) and the period of soil moisture increase (i.e. the duration
    of the soil wetting event). Quantitative descriptions of these two periods can
    provide new insights into the temporal patterns of the soil wetting process along
    a soil profile. The difference of the soil moisture response time ( ) between
    two adjacent soil layers was evaluated to characterize the temporal delay of the
    soil wetting events with depth (Sun et al., 2015; Li et al., 2015b; Germann and
    Hensel, 2006). It is calculated as: (6) where and are the response times of layer
    and to a rainfall event ( ), and is the difference of the response times (hour).
    The DRT for the event shown in Fig. 4 is 0.5 h for layer 2. The duration of the
    soil wetting process (h) for a specific soil layer is calculated as: (7) where
    and are the end and start time of the jth soil wetting event for a specific soil
    layer. The duration of the event shown in Fig. 4 is 7.5 h for layer 1 and 11.5 h
    for layer 2. Finally, based on the increment of soil wetting event, the accumulated
    soil storage increment (ASSI) for different layers under different land covers
    were calculated as: (8) where is the sum of the accumulated soil moisture increment
    (vol. %) at layer is the corresponding measurement range of layer ( is 100, 100,
    100, 200, 200 mm, respectively, according to the installation depths of the sensors).
    Furthermore, the ratio between the ASSI of a specific layer and the sum of ASSI
    of the profile was calculated to normalize the vertical distribution of ASSI along
    depth. ASSI is the overall result of the partitioning of infiltration propagating
    through soil profile of 0–70 cm during the study period (Moran et al., 2010; Lozano-Parra
    et al., 2016). 2.7. Virtual simulations of soil moisture dynamics The influence
    of land cover on soil moisture dynamics can be attributed both to plant characteristics
    (e.g. rooting depth, interception storage etc.) and soil properties that have
    developed in coevolution with vegetation (Jenny, 1994). Here, we use virtual simulations
    of soil moisture dynamics with the process-based soil hydrological model HYDRUS-1D
    (Simunek et al., 2005) to explore their individual roles in controlling the pattern
    of soil moisture dynamics. In addition, the virtual simulations serve to test
    the applicability of the indices used in this study. The sensitivity analysis
    included two different scenarios: (1) simulations of soil moisture dynamics with
    different soil properties but with the same crop parameters; (2) simulations with
    different crop parameters but with the same soil properties. Both scenarios were
    simulated using the same meteorological data. The modified Richards equation as
    implemented in HydruS-1D (Simunek et al., 2005) was used to simulate soil moisture
    dynamics for the two scenarios. The soil hydraulic parameters were derived by
    fitting the measured soil retention curve to the Mualem-van Genuchten model: (9)
    (10) (11) (12) where and are the saturated and residual water content (cm3/cm3),
    respectively, is the pressure head (cm), (1/cm) and are empirical coefficients
    (which are related to the air-entry value and the pore-size distribution index,
    respectively), and is the saturated hydraulic conductivity. As none of the soil
    moisture stations includes meteorological measurements, we used data from a nearby
    meteorological station (11 km away from the scrubland soil moisture station) as
    climate forcing for all simulations. The potential evapotranspiration was calculated
    by the Penman-Monteith equation within HydruS-1D. The soil profile was discretized
    into six materials (five soil layers matching the observations within 0-0.7 m
    plus a soil layer extended from 0.7 to 2 m with the same soil properties as layer
    5). The lower boundary condition of HYDRUS-1D was set to free drainage since the
    soil overlays a fractured rock system (Yao et al., 2017). The Feddes model was
    used for root water uptake simulations (Feddes et al., 1978), and the vertical
    root distribution was parameterized based on an empirical root distribution (Hoffman
    and van Genuchten, 1983) and the measured rooting depth (Simunek et al., 2005).
    The interception constant for specific land covers were obtained by dividing the
    daily interception thresholds by the LAI (Wang et al., 2018). The interception
    thresholds were obtained from the results of literature values reported for the
    Qilian Mountains (Liu et al., 2012, 2013). Both soil properties and crop parameters
    did not change during the simulation. In the simulation of scenario (1), HYDRUS
    was applied to simulate the soil moisture dynamics of the eight soil moisture
    stations using the measured soil properties of each station, and using the same
    crop parameters (for scrubland). For scenario (2), HYDRUS was applied to simulate
    soil moisture for five land cover types with their respective crop parameters
    using the same soil properties (soil of scrubland). Smax and Duration were calculated
    from the simulated soil moisture to show the applicability of the indices. The
    soil properties and crop parameters used in the simulations are shown in the supplemental
    material (Tables A1 and A2 in Supplementary material). 2.8. Statistical analysis
    Descriptive statistics (maximum, minimum, mean and coefficient of variation (CV))
    were computed for all indices and the effect of different land covers on the indices
    were tested using a one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (α = 0.05). Least Significant
    Difference (LSD) was used as a post-hoc-test for multiple comparisons of means
    (α = 0.05). Box-plots were used to display the distribution of index values between
    different layers and land covers (McGill et al., 1978), and when notches do not
    overlap, the medians can be judged to differ significantly (Muenchen, 2011; Krzywinski
    and Altman, 2014). The statistical analysis was conducted using the SPSS statistical
    package (SPSS 18.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA) and MATLAB (MathWorks, Inc., Massachusetts,
    USA). 3. Results The discriminated soil wetting events at each measurement location
    during the growing season of 2014–2016 are summarized in Table 2. Overall, we
    found 1783 events, of which 48% occurred in the first soil layer and 24% occurred
    in the second layer. As there is only one soil moisture station each for the scrubland
    and meadow and there are two stations for each of the other three land covers,
    the soil wetting events at each station were aggregated within the same land cover
    to analyze the patterns of soil wetting events under different land covers in
    the study area. We analyzed the soil wetting events with the indices described
    earlier, and this analysis is summarized in Table 3. Table 2. The recorded number
    of soil wetting events at each soil layers of the soil moisture stations. Layer

    event (ASWI) under different land covers Fig. 5, Fig. 6 show the box-plots of
    the derived ASWI and RSWI values for the specific soil depths and land cover types,
    respectively. Generally, ASWI decreased with depth and RSWI is below 100% in most
    cases, which suggests a decreasing soil moisture response with increasing soil
    depth. Furthermore, the RSWI increased with depth in most cases, suggesting that
    the dampening effect also reduced with depth. The box plots of ASWI and RSWI show
    different reduction patterns along depth for different land covers (Fig. 5, Fig.
    6). Download : Download high-res image (439KB) Download : Download full-size image

    Fig. 6. Profile distribution of Ratio of SWI (RSWI) for different land covers.
    The different lowercase letters show a significant difference among different
    soil layers under a specific land covers (p < 0.05). (b) The result of RSWI of
    all layers along profile for different land covers. The scrubland shows a similar
    degree of soil moisture increase along the soil profile, only with a significantly
    decrease of ASWI at layer 3 (p < 0.05), which may be related to the lower KS of
    layer 3 (Fig. 3). At the same time, the scrubland has the highest RSWI along the
    soil profile amongst all land covers, with a median higher than 50% for layers
    2 and 3, and a median above 100% for layers 4 and 5. Moreover, the scrubland also
    shows the highest number of soil wetting events in the deeper layers (Table 2),
    indicating that soil covered by the scrubland exhibits a less dampened soil moisture
    response. This is attributed to the well-developed root system, which is associated
    with better conditions for infiltration (Fig. 3) (He et al., 2012; Tian et al.,
    2017). The soil moisture measurements for the meadow show a decline of ASWI from
    layer 1 (with a median of 4.3 vol. %) to layer 2 (with a median of 1.1 vol. %),
    which is significant at p < 0.001, with the corresponding lowest RSWI (with a
    median of 17%) at layer 2. This also led to higher soil water contents in layer
    1 (Fig. 2). The high RSWI at layer 5 (with median of 77%) can be partly affected
    by the accumulation of lateral flow from the upslope, as this soil moisture station
    is located at the bottom of a slope. These findings indicate that the meadow stations
    show a significantly higher degree of soil moisture response from layer 1 to layer
    2, while there are no significant differences from layer 2 to layer 5. The High
    coverage grassland (HCG) and Medium coverage grassland (MCG) also show a significantly
    different degree of response along depth, while the barren land has a similar
    degree of response along depth. The HCG has a lower RSWI than the MCG in the shallow
    soil layers (median of 26% versus 61% at layer 2), while the HCG has a higher
    RSWI for the deep soil layers than the MCG (median of 57% and 41% of layer 5 for
    the HCG and MCG, respectively). In addition, the extreme values of ASWI are more
    frequent along the profile for the HCG than the MCG and barren land. This indicates
    that the grassland stations with more vigorous vegetation consume more water in
    the shallow soil layers, and have a better capacity to transfer water into deeper
    soil layers. Overall, the results of the multiple comparisons show a similar degree
    of soil moisture response along depth for the scrubland (p > 0.01) and barren
    land (p > 0.05), suggesting a slightly dampened pattern of response amplitude
    for these two land covers. In contrast, the meadow, HCG and MCG stations show
    a heavily dampened soil moisture response amplitude with depth (p < 0.01), which
    is strongest for the meadow station. 3.2. Profile distribution of the rate of
    soil wetting (Smax, Smean) for different land covers In Fig. 7, both the maximum
    and mean rates (Smax and Smean) of the five soil layers are shown for all five
    land covers. As the rates vary in a wide range, box plots of Smax and Smean are
    shown with a logarithmic axis. Results of Welch’s ANOVA showed an overall significant
    reduction (p < 0.01) of rate with depth for all the land covers. The maximum and
    mean rates of soil moisture increase showed a similar variation with depth under
    the same land cover. Download : Download high-res image (695KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 7. Profile distribution of Smax and Smean for different land
    covers. Smax and Smean are box plotted with lognormal distribution to clearly
    display the entire distribution of the data. The different lowercase letters in
    different layers show a significant difference among different soil layers under
    a specific land cover, and the same lowercase letters in different layers show
    no significant difference among different layers (p < 0.05). The scrubland showed
    the highest rate for the deep soil layers (with a median of 0.5 of Smax at layer
    5, supposing a variation of 0.15 vol. % in 30 min at layer 5). This is attributed
    to the fact that the scrubland has more macropores and higher KS (Fig. 2). The
    meadow showed the strongest reduction in rate from layer 1 (with a median of 4.86,
    Smax) to layer 2 (with a median of 1.2, Smax), similar to the variation of response
    degree. The HCG showed a significant higher rate at layer 1 (median of 2.4, matching
    a variation of 0.72 vol. % in 30 min, Smax), followed by a stably lower range
    of rates from layer 2 to layer 5 (median varied from 0.14 to 0.78, Smax). Unlike
    the degree of soil moisture response (ASWI), the rate of soil moisture increase
    showed a significant reduction from layer 1 to layer 3 for the MCG and barren
    land. This indicates that the MCG and barren land have a similar response amplitude
    but a different response rate along depth. Similar to ASWI, the extreme values
    of the rate are more frequent along the profile for the scrubland and HCG than
    for the MCG and barren land, corresponding to the increasing vegetation degradation
    (Fig. 7). 3.3. Profile distribution of temporal pattern of soil wetting event
    under different land covers The temporal patterns of the soil wetting process
    at a specific layer along the profile are presented as the vertical variation

    to clearly display the entire distribution of the data. The different lowercase
    letters show a significant difference among different soil layers under a specific
    land cover (p < 0.05). 3.3.1. Profile distribution of the response time under
    different land covers The results presented in Fig. 8 show that the differences
    in the response time (DRT) ranged from negative values (indicating preferential
    flow; Wiekenkamp et al., 2016; Lin and Zhou, 2008) to as large as 270 h in the
    barren land. The vertical distribution of DRT for different land covers is different
    to that of ASWI and rate (Fig. 8). The average DRT for each land cover increased
    in the order of scrubland (with a median value for the whole profile of 0.5 h),
    meadow (2 h), HCG (4 h), MCG (7.5 h), and barren land (16.5 h), again corresponding
    to the degree of vegetation degradation in the study area (Fig. 8). The DRT increased
    significantly with depth for all the land covers except the HCG (Fig. 8). The
    negative DRT along the profile in combination with the high RSWI (around 100%)
    and the relatively high rate of soil moisture increase along the profile indicates
    that the scrubland is influenced by preferential flow along the profile through
    biological macropores (worm holes or root remnants, with a range of rooting depth>70 cm).
    In the soil profiles under meadow, bypass flow was not observed between layer
    1 and 2 (as the DRT2 is larger than 0 h), possibly due to the presence of the
    “mattic” epipedon. For MCG, bypass flow is more frequent between layers 1 and
    2, and this occurrence of bypass flow coincides with the observed range of rooting
    depth (within 25 cm according to the field survey, Tian et al., 2017). Bypass
    flow was still observed for layer 4 under HCG, which also coincides with the observed
    range of rooting depth (within 40 cm). In contrast, bypass flow was not observed
    under barren conditions (with a minimum DRT of 0.5 h for layer 2, Fig. 8). 3.3.2.
    Profile distribution of the duration of soil wetting process under different land
    covers The vertical pattern of duration showed a wide range of time scales for
    the soil wetting events under different land covers, and it varied from a median
    value of 6.5 h to 170 h (Fig. 9). The scrubland showed relatively homogenous soil
    wetting duration along the soil profile with a median value of 6.5 h in the first
    two layers and around 14 h in layers 3 to 5. In contrast, the wetting duration
    of the meadow soil profile is non-uniform, ranging from 3.5 h (median) in the
    first layer to more than 40 h (median) in the deeper soil layers. For HCG, the
    wetting duration extended from 8 h to 46 h (median value) with increasing depth.
    This pattern was also found for MCG and barren land, and was even more pronounced
    with about 10 h (median) in the first layer to a long time scale of over 130 h
    (5 days, median) in the deep layers (Fig. 9). In summary, our results indicate
    that the duration of soil wetting events in the Qilian Mountain region can last
    from a few hours to several weeks depending on land cover, soil depth and soil
    properties. Also, the amplitude, rate and DRT of the soil wetting events varied
    with land cover types, soil depth and soil properties. 3.4. Profile distribution
    of the accumulated soil wetting events under different land covers From the proportion
    of ASSI (Fig. 10 (c)), we can see that the first layer showed the highest proportion
    along the profile for all the land covers. The highest value of 80% was found
    for the meadow, the lowest value of 30% for the scrubland, and 50–65% for the
    other land covers. The results also show that the scrubland has a relatively even
    distribution pattern of the proportion of ASSI with depth, while the accumulated
    proportion of ASSI in the upper soil layers increased from HCG (with an accumulated
    proportion of 82% at layer 3), MCG (87%) to barren land (95%). These results indicate
    that the active soil depth involved in the infiltration processes decreased with
    vegetation degradation in the study area, except for the meadow. Download : Download

    proportion. This can also be seen from the number of soil wetting events. The
    scrubland showed a stable reduction of the number of soil wetting events with
    depth, while the barren land showed a high proportion (more than 65%) of soil
    wetting events in layer 1. The meadow, HCG, and MCG had a percentage of nearly
    50% of the soil wetting events recorded at layer 1 (Fig. 10 (d)). At the deepest
    layer, the percentage of the recorded soil wetting events decreased in the following
    order: scrubland (11.4%), HCG (5.8%), meadow (2.9%), MCG (2%), and barren land
    (1.6%), corresponding to the decrease of the rooting depth of the different land
    covers, suggesting that land covers with a deeper root zone have more soil moisture
    response events at deep layers. 3.5. Simulation of the effect of land cover on
    soil wetting events Based on the results above, the profile pattern of soil wetting
    events (increment, rate, DRT and duration) was influenced by different land covers.
    However, as stated above, the influence of land cover on soil wetting events can
    be the combined effect of both the different plant characteristics and soil properties
    that have developed in coevolution with vegetation, which cannot be distinguished
    from the observations only. Thus, the individual roles of plant characteristics
    and soil properties in regulating the soil wetting events were further explored
    through the sensitivity analysis using HYDRUS-1D. 3.5.1. Model validation A comparison
    of the measured and simulated soil moisture for the scrubland is used to validate
    the simulation results (Figs. A1 and A2 in Supplementary material). We only validated
    for scrubland as this station is relatively close to a meteorological station
    (11 km), while the distance between meteorological stations and the other soil
    moisture stations is much greater. Given the strong variability of precipitation
    in this mountainous area, the validation for other stations was deemed to be unreliable.
    The correlation coefficient and RMSE for layer 1 (0.65, 0.048), layer 2 (0.67
    and 0.045), layer 3 (0.67 and 0.069), layer 4 (0.81 and 0.029) and layer 5 (0.89
    and 0.031) indicate a relatively good fit. Although there is bias between the
    measured and simulated soil moisture, the HYDRUS-1D model was able to simulate
    the soil moisture trends reasonably well. An important reason for the remaining
    difference is the still considerable distance between the meteorological and the
    soil moisture station (11 km). A further explanation for the remaining deviations
    could be related to the strong heterogeneity of soil hydraulic properties under
    scrubland (Rossi et al., 2018). To further validate the simulation results, the
    profile distribution of soil wetting events (SWE) for the observed and simulated
    time series were also compared. Fig. A2 shows that both the profile distribution
    of the proportion of SWI and ASSI were higher for the simulations (45%, proportion
    of SWE number at layer 1) than for the observations (31.3%) in the surface layer,
    and lower for the simulations (6% at layer 5) than for the observations (11%)
    in deeper layers. Similarly, the comparison of the pattern of SWE also showed
    a higher Smax and Smean for the simulations than for the observations at the surface
    layer, while Smax and Smean for the simulations were again lower than the observations
    in the deeper layers. The profile distribution of Duration was similar to Smax
    (Fig. A2). In summary, a higher amount of soil wetting events with a higher velocity
    of the observed soil wetting process was found in the observed time series. These
    results indicate that the model underestimates the water transferability especially
    at greater depths. This could be attributed to the influence of preferential flow,
    which was observed at deeper depths (from DRT at layer 5, Fig. 8) but not explicitly
    accounted for in the HYDRUS1D simulations. Despite this shortcoming, the general
    characteristics of the soil wetting dynamics are reasonably reproduced by the
    model and thus can be used for sensitivity analyses. 3.5.2. Sensitivity analysis
    The result of the sensitivity study using HYDRUS-1D simulations for the two scenarios
    is presented in Fig. 11, Fig. 12 (the simulated time series of the two scenarios
    are shown in Figs. A3 and A4 in the Appendix). For scenario (1) with the influence
    of different profile soil properties (Fig. 11), the indices showed different profile
    patterns in both Duration and Smax. Smax decreased with depth in different ways
    for all model runs except the barren land, while the Duration increased with depth
    in different ways except for the barren land. For the barren land, the increase
    of Smax at layer 4 is attributed to the increase of KS from layer 3 (0.4 cm/hour)
    to layer 4 (1.7 cm/hour). The different profile distribution of Smax and Duration
    reflect the control of soil properties on soil water dynamics, which varied considerably
    between each soil profile (Table A1). Download : Download high-res image (1MB)

    axis is soil layer. HCG, MCG and BL represent high coverage grassland, medium
    coverage grassland and barren land, respectively. For scenario (2) with the influence
    of different crop parameters (Fig. 12), both Smax and Duration showed a similar
    variation with depth for different land covers. Despite the different plant parameters
    for each land cover types, Smax decreased and Duration increased with depth for
    all land cover types. Furthermore, Smax at deeper depths decreased for several
    vegetation types at layer 5: scrubland (with a median value of 0.4), HCG (0.22),
    MCG (0.2) and meadow (0.17). Apparently, the value of Smax at layer 5 seems to
    be related to the rooting depth (Table A2), i.e. with decreasing rooting depth,
    the value of Smax for layer 5 decreases. In summary, soil profiles with different
    soil hydraulic properties (e.g. KS, soil hydraulic properties) and the same plant
    parameters had different profile patterns of soil wetting events (Fig. 11). However,
    the profiles with different plant parameters and the same soil hydraulic properties
    showed similar profile patterns of soil wetting events (Fig. 12). Thus, the results
    of this sensitivity analysis using HYDRUS-1D show that soil hydraulic properties
    are key factors in regulating the profile patterns of soil wetting events. 4.
    Discussion 4.1. Response patterns of soil moisture dynamics under different land
    covers Vegetation has been reported to alter soil hydrological processes, e.g.
    the propagation of wetting fronts through soil profiles (Laio et al., 2001). In
    our study, we investigated hydrological processes using long-term measurements
    of profile soil moisture response during rainfall infiltration under different
    land covers based on a set of indices (ASWI, RSWI, Smax, Smean, DRT, and Duration)
    that may also be useful for parameterization and validation of process-based soil
    hydrological models. Scrubland has been argued to enhance infiltration capacity
    (Li et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2015; Jin et al., 2018) or reduce infiltration capacity
    in soil profile (more root water uptake and interception for scrubland than grassland,
    especially in the (semi-) arid area, Wang et al., 2008; Li et al., 2013a; Lozano-Parra
    et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2017) through complex interactions between the well-developed
    root system and soil water (Moran et al., 2010). In our study, both the highest
    RSWI along the soil profile and the highest rate in the deep soil layers were
    observed under scrubland (Fig. 6, Fig. 7). This indicates that scrubland soil
    exhibited a more intensive soil moisture response, both in terms of degree and
    rate, especially at deeper depths. In addition, the high value of the ASSI index
    (Fig. 10) indicates that scrubland soil exhibited higher infiltration capacity.
    On the other hand, the distribution of negative DRT revealed the frequent occurrence
    of preferential flow (Lin and Zhou, 2008; Wiekenkamp et al., 2016) in scrubland
    soils. This is attributed to the well-developed root system of scrubland, which
    is associated with both better soil hydraulic conditions (Fig. 3) for infiltration
    (He et al., 2012; Tian et al., 2017) and formation of macropores that facilitate
    preferential flow (Li et al., 2009; Jin et al., 2018). Thus, in the hydrological
    modelling for scrubland, the effect of preferential flow needs to be considered
    to best represent the hydrological processes of scrubland. The ‘mattic’ diagnostic
    epipedon typically found at soil depths of 0–10 cm in alpine meadow soils of the
    Tibet plateau is formed by abundant roots and their long-term interaction with
    the soil (Zeng et al., 2013; Zhi et al., 2017). We found that this layer can significantly
    reduce the soil hydraulic conductivity (Fig. 3) and the soil moisture response
    (e.g. ASWI and Smax from layer 1 to layer 2, Fig. 5, Fig. 7), which was also suggested
    in other studies (Wang et al., 2007; Tian et al., 2017). Accordingly, a scheme
    of “two soil layers with a low soil hydraulic properties for the ‘mattic’ epidedon
    layer and a high one for the deeper soil layer” was recommended in the soil hydraulic
    parameterization of hydrological modelling under meadow. This result is also consistent
    with experiences from hydrological model parameterization for Alpine meadow soils
    (Della Chiesa et al., 2014). The profile response patterns suggest that land covers
    with a deeper root zone exhibit more soil moisture response events at deep layers
    in the study area. This result coincides with other relevant studies in the Tibet
    plateau (Sun et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2017). Thus, rooting depth is an essential
    control on the transfer of rainfall infiltration into deeper layers of Tibet plateau
    soils. The profile distribution of Duration of the soil moisture increases indicated
    that there is an accumulation of soil moisture in the deep layers under MCG and
    barren land, which was also observed by Sun et al. (2015) and Yang et al. (2017)
    for grassland in the Qilian Mountains. The accumulation of soil moisture in deep
    layers was probably related to the combined effects of the continuous rainfall
    pattern in the study area (Sun et al., 2015; He et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2017)
    and the lower KS of the deeper soil layers (as shown in Fig. 3) that reduces downward
    flow (Sun et al., 2015). In addition, the deeper soil layers are not penetrated
    by roots and thus are less affected by evapotranspiration processes (He et al.,
    2013; Wang et al., 2015; Broedel et al., 2017). 4.2. Assessing the quantitative
    indices for the soil wetting event pattern There are many studies dealing with
    the response of soil moisture to rainfall. However, most studies are based on
    a qualitative description through visual inspection of time series of soil moisture
    (Kim, 2009; He et al., 2012; Li et al., 2013a; Yu et al., 2015). For instance,
    Yu et al. (2015) and Kim (2009) suggested the existence of an “inconsistent impulse
    type” of soil moisture response to rainfall. In this study, we evaluated several
    indices based on the amplitude, rate (Smax, Smean) and timing of response to characterize
    how the profile soil moisture response responds to rainfall using 3-year time
    series of soil moisture under different land covers. The distribution of Smax
    from the soils investigated in this study was consistent with results of Lozano-Parra
    et al. (2016) found in the region of Extremadura, Spain. However, our station
    showed somewhat lower values for Smax, which may be caused by the higher hydraulic
    conductivity of the sandy loam soil at the Spanish site (Lozano-Parra et al.,
    2016). Our Smean pattern also matched well with the results of Sun et al. (2015)
    and Yang et al. (2017) in a small watershed within the Qilian Mountains based
    on typical soil wetting events, indicating the validity of our results. However,
    our study relies on the observed general patterns of soil wetting events for five
    different land covers from longer soil moisture records (3 years) at multiple
    stations. DRT has been used for the identification of preferential flow (Wiekenkamp
    et al., 2016). It increased significantly with depth for all land covers except
    HCG in this study. This indicates that the velocity of the wetting front reduced
    significantly as the infiltration front propagated deeper into the soil (Green
    and Erskine, 2011; Yang et al., 2017; Hardie et al., 2013). However, the occurrence
    of preferential flow might be underestimated in this study due to the relatively
    long measurement interval of 30 min. Previous studies have shown that preferential
    flow may occur on time scales shorter than 30 min (Lin and Zhou, 2008; Graham
    and Lin, 2011). 4.3. Virtual simulation of soil wetting events with HYDRUS-1D
    In order to explore the individual roles of plant parameters and soil properties
    in controlling the soil wetting events, which can’t be obtained from data analysis
    only, the sensitivity analysis with two scenarios were conducted through HYDRUS-1D.
    Through the comparison of the soil wetting patterns for two simulation scenarios,
    we found similar response patterns of profile soil moisture for different plant
    parameters and the same soil (Fig. A4 and Fig. 12), while we found different response
    patterns when soil properties were varied for the same land cover (Fig. A3 and
    Fig. 11). Thus, we conclude that soil properties are a key factor for the regulation
    of the profile pattern of soil moisture dynamics rather than the plant parameters.
    The importance of soil properties in controlling soil moisture dynamics was also
    reported in other studies based on hydrological modelling (Bertoldi et al., 2014;
    Shi et al., 2015). In addition, our virtual experimental analysis illustrated
    that the indices used in our study are suitable to quantitatively describe and
    distinguish the patterns of soil moisture dynamics. However, land cover may not
    have been characterized sufficiently in terms of physiological properties in the
    soil hydrological modelling in this study. For instance, we used the same values
    for the physiological parameters of the root water uptake model for all land cover
    types due to the lack of more detailed information for the vegetation in the study
    area. Furthermore, the vertical root distribution was parameterized using a general
    root distribution function in HYDRUS-1D (Hoffman and van Genuchten, 1983) due
    to the lack of measured root density profiles. Additionally, crop parameters were
    kept unchanged during the simulation of HYDRUS (including LAI, rooting depth and
    crop height). Due to this generalization, the effect of different vegetation types
    on the soil moisture response to evapotranspiration may have been underestimated.
    Topographic factors have been recognized as an important factor in regulating
    soil moisture dynamics in Qilian Mountainous area (Zhao et al., 2014). In this
    study, stations with only mild slopes were selected to reduce such topography
    effects. However, the influence of topography should be investigated in future
    studies using detailed slope information, in situ observations and 2D or 3D hydrological
    simulations. 5. Conclusions Based on a 3-year long dataset obtained from a large-scale
    soil moisture monitoring network in the upper reach of the Heihe River Watershed,
    we quantitatively analyzed the patterns of the profile soil moisture dynamic response
    for different land covers from its response amplitude, response rate and time.
    The main findings are: (1) The scrubland, MCG and barren land have a slightly
    dampened soil moisture response amplitude along the soil profile, while the meadow
    and HCG have a heavily dampened response amplitude. The rate of soil moisture
    increases reduced significantly with depth for all the land covers, except for
    the HCG. (2) The different land covers have significantly different temporal patterns
    of the profile soil moisture dynamics response. The vertical variation of transmit
    time for the wetting front advancing through the adjacent layers coincides with
    the extent of the root zone for the different land covers. In addition, soil wetting
    events can last from hours to weeks for different soil layers of different land
    covers. (3) Preferential flow occurred mostly in soils covered by scrubland. (4)
    Overall, scrubland has an evenly distributed soil moisture retention capacity
    along the profile, whereas the major soil moisture retention capacity is concentrated
    in the top soil for other land covers, especially the meadow. The water transferability
    was found to be higher in deeply rooted soil. (5) After separating the influence
    of plant parameters and soil properties on profile patterns of soil wetting events,
    soil hydraulic properties was found to be the key factors explaining the observed
    differences in soil moisture responses. The indices used in this study can be
    used to quantitatively describe the patterns of profile soil moisture dynamics
    for different land covers, and to provide new insights into the different soil
    hydrological regimes under different land covers. They can also supply important
    information for effective model parameterization and validation, and thus improving
    ecohydrological modelling studies in data-scarce mountainous watersheds. Acknowledgements

  title: Dynamic response patterns of profile soil moisture wetting events under different
    land covers in the Mountainous area of the Heihe River Watershed, Northwest China
  verbatim_quote1: The scrubland showed a similar degree of soil moisture response
    along the soil profile, only with a significantly decrease of ASWI at layer 3
    (p < 0.05), which may be related to the lower KS of layer 3 (Fig. 3). At the same
    time, the scrubland has the highest RSWI along the soil profile amongst all land
    covers, with a median higher than 50% for layers 2 and 3, and a median above 100%
    for layers 4 and 5. Moreover, the scrubland also shows the highest number of soil
    wetting events in the deeper layers (Table 2), indicating that soil covered by
    the scrubland exhibits a less dampened soil moisture response. This is attributed
    to the well-developed root system, which is associated with better conditions
    for infiltration (Fig. 3) (He et al., 2012; Tian et al., 2017).
  verbatim_quote2: The meadow showed the strongest reduction in rate from layer 1
    (with a median of 4.86, Smax) to layer 2 (with a median of 1.2, Smax), similar
    to the variation of response degree. The HCG and MCG also show a significantly
    different degree of response along depth, while the barren land has a similar
    degree of response along depth. The HCG has a lower RSWI than the MCG in the shallow
    soil layers (median of 26% versus 61% at layer 2), while the HCG has a higher
    RSWI for the deep soil layers than the MCG (median of 57% and 41% of layer 5 for
    the HCG and MCG, respectively). In addition, the extreme values of ASWI are more
    frequent along the profile for the HCG than the MCG and barren land, corresponding
    to the increasing vegetation degradation (Fig. 7).

  analysis: 'This paper introduces a novel, cost-effective method for measuring the
    three dimensional relative moisture content of soil. The affordability of the
    system, combined with its ability to visualize the three-dimensional distribution
    of moisture in real-time, makes it an attractive alternative to existing soil
    moisture sensors. The system is easy to install and calibrate, and can be used
    in a variety of applications, including irrigation control, water resource management,
    and environmental monitoring.


    The paper provides three specific examples of how the system can be used to measure
    soil moisture content. In the first example, soil resistance was measured between
    pairs of electrodes to create a tomographic image of soil moisture. The resulting
    image showed the location of a wet region in the soil. In the second example,
    the system was used to measure the moisture content of a soil sample over the
    course of a 24-hour period. The results showed that the moisture content of the
    soil decreased significantly over the course of the day. In the third example,
    the system was used to measure the moisture content of a soil sample that had
    been left to dry for 3 months. The results showed that the moisture content of
    the soil had decreased significantly over the course of the 3 months.


    The system is currently limited by its sensitivity to environmental factors such
    as soil salinity and temperature. However, the authors note that these limitations
    can be overcome by calibrating the system for each specific application. The system
    also requires frequent re-calibration, which could be a drawback for some applications.


    Overall, the system is a promising new tool for measuring soil moisture content.
    Its affordability, ease of use, and ability to visualize the three-dimensional
    distribution of moisture in real-time make it a valuable tool for a variety of
    applications.'

    \ Published: 20 November 2017\nAbstract: An affordable standalone sensor that\
    \ can provide volumetric information on soil moisture\ndistribution in real time\
    \ was developed and tested for potential application in irrigation control\nsystems.\
    \ The moisture content of soil is reconstructed tomographically from electrical\
    \ resistivity\nmeasured between multiple pairs of electrodes, which are installed\
    \ on two opposite sides of the soil\nvolume. The measurement of relative moisture\
    \ content reconstructed from the measured resistance\nvalues demonstrated in this\
    \ paper requires a simple, in-situ, two-point calibration (for dry and wet\nsoil\
    \ conditions) after electrodes are installed in place. This calibration has to\
    \ be repeated once the soil\nconditions, such as salinity or fertilizer content,\
    \ are altered as the season progresses. Historical data\ncollected over a 12-month\
    \ period can be stored locally or transferred over a wireless network at\ngiven\
    \ intervals or in real time. Although existing single-point sensors can provide\
    \ more accurate\nmeasurements of soil moisture, knowledge on the three-dimensional\
    \ distribution of moisture around\nplant roots should allow substantial savings\
    \ of precious fresh water resources and more intelligent\nmulti-channel irrigation\
    \ systems. The same system can possibly be extended to estimation of\nfertilizer\
    \ distribution.\nKeywords: soil moisture; sensor systems; intelligent irrigation;\
    \ real-time control\n1. Introduction\nHunger, one of the most prominent problems\
    \ in the world today, is primarily caused by a\nshortage of fresh water [1]. This\
    \ problem is especially severe in third-world countries and regions with\nlow\
    \ rainfall or that are prone to severe droughts. For example, the most recent\
    \ California drought\n(2013–2016) vividly demonstrated the importance of fresh\
    \ water conservation [2,3]. The state’s large\nagricultural industry was most\
    \ heavily impacted by the weather abnormality [3], with some crops\nbeing completely\
    \ deprived of irrigation water. The expense of lost plants forced many farmers\
    \ to\nreconsider their irrigation methods. The use of traditional sprinkler systems\
    \ is accompanied by\nsubstantial evaporation and watering of unused soil regions.\
    \ In response to this, some farmers have\nimplemented subsurface drip irrigation\
    \ systems, which can save up to 25–50 percent of water [4–8].\nFurthermore, signiﬁcant\
    \ optimization of water use can be achieved by knowing the exact time and\namount\
    \ of needed water, as well as the speciﬁc location of soil that requires irrigation.\
    \ Recently, various\nnovel methods for soil moisture measurement have been developed\
    \ [9,10], which can be used for the\nintelligent irrigation control systems. In\
    \ order to measure the soil moisture content, different physical\nproperties of\
    \ soil may be analyzed, such as the dielectric constant, resistivity, thermal\
    \ conductivity,\nneutron absorption and others. For example, dry soil has a dielectric\
    \ constant of 2–5, while water has\nthe dielectric constant equal to ~81 [11–13].\
    \ Because of this large difference, the most accurate moisture\nsensors use it\
    \ to determine the moisture content [9–13]. Time Domain Reﬂectometry (TDR) proved\
    \ to\nbe one of the most accurate measurement techniques [11–13]. This method\
    \ has little dependence on soil\ntype and thus does not require calibration for\
    \ every new soil. Another parameter which can be used\nHydrology 2017, 4, 54;\
    \ doi:10.3390/hydrology4040054\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/hydrology\nHydrology 2017,\
    \ 4, 54\n2 of 14\nfor estimation of moisture content is the thermal conductivity\
    \ of soil, which noticeably changes when\nmoisture content is changed but it is\
    \ also affected by other factors such soil composition. Neutrons are\nheavily\
    \ scattered by hydrogen contained in water and, at the same time, they easily\
    \ penetrate dry\nsoil [14]. However, neutron-based sensors are impractical for\
    \ wide use in the ﬁeld.\nAnother soil parameter that can be used to measure moisture\
    \ content is soil resistivity,\nwhich typically varies between 10 and 1000 Ω·m\
    \ [15]. The deﬁciency of this parameter is in the\nfact that resistivity greatly\
    \ varies between different types of soils and can be affected by added\nsubstances,\
    \ such as fertilizer. Resistivity can also be affected by soil salinity, which\
    \ can change as\nthe season progresses. It can also change with temperature, as\
    \ resistance increases dramatically at\ntemperatures close to or below freezing.\
    \ The resistance of soil was reported to change by a factor of\n~2.5 from the\
    \ month of February to May [16]. However, the resistance did not change that much\
    \ during\nthe months of crop production when irrigation is required. If necessary,\
    \ the variation of resistance with\ntemperature can be corrected to current temperature\
    \ after proper calibration for a particular type of\nsoil [16–18]. However, there\
    \ are several reasons why soil resistance is still used for the measurement of\n\
    soil properties. The capability of DC signal to penetrate large distances in soil,\
    \ for example, is widely\nutilized in soil resistivity measurements in geophysical\
    \ research when implemented in electrical\nresistivity tomography (ERT) systems\
    \ [19,20]. Resistivity measurements also involve relatively simple\nDC electronics,\
    \ rather than expensive high frequency circuits.\nMost traditional soil moisture\
    \ sensors provide single-point information on moisture content and\nremain somewhat\
    \ expensive for wide use in irrigation control systems. A wide range of commercially\n\
    available single-point (and single line) sensors exists at the present time.\n\
    However, irrigation\ncan be made signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient if volumetric information\
    \ on soil moisture distribution\nis known.\nThe volumetric measurement of soil\
    \ moisture has already been demonstrated in\nprinciple in a laboratory-based prototype\
    \ system (e.g., as described in references [21–23] with a TDR\nsensor [24]), or\
    \ in a permanently installed system of multiple sensors on a 3D grid as in reference\
    \ [25].\nHowever, such systems still remain less practical compared to single-point\
    \ measurement of soil\nmoisture content and do not have wide use outside of research\
    \ installations.\nIn this paper, a method of volumetric measurement of relative\
    \ soil moisture content is introduced\ntogether with a possible hardware implementation\
    \ in a standalone, easy-to-install system. It is not\nintended to replace or outperform\
    \ existing soil moisture sensors but rather to provide a low-cost\nalternative\
    \ for volumetric measurement of moisture content around plant roots. Despite many\n\
    deﬁciencies of the present system, such as its sensitivity to the salinity of\
    \ soil, temperature, or porosity,\nthis system can be an attractive, affordable\
    \ alternative to existing sensors, with a multi-unit\nimplementation in the ﬁeld.\
    \ Moreover, the inaccuracy of measurement due to variation of factors\nother than\
    \ soil content can be corrected by the correlation of sensor volumetric data with\
    \ an accurate\nsingle-point TDR sensor (e.g., as it has been demonstrated in a\
    \ system described in reference [21]).\nThe recent development of inexpensive\
    \ microelectronics enabled fast data acquisition and\nprocessing, which are utilized\
    \ in the sensor described in this paper. The system uses multiple\nmeasurements\
    \ of resistance to reconstruct the relative three-dimensional distribution of\
    \ moisture\nin real-time. Although the system is not as precise as many single-point\
    \ sensors, its volumetric output,\nsimplicity and low cost can be advantageous\
    \ for wide use in precision irrigation. The system is\ncapable of wireless data\
    \ transmission, pairs all measurements with exact time and location from a\nGPS\
    \ signal, can store large amounts of historical data (~12 months as deﬁned by\
    \ the capacity of the\nstorage memory), features one-button calibration, automatically\
    \ adjusts the accuracy of resistivity\nmeasurements for different types of soil\
    \ and, most importantly, provides real-time 3-D imaging of\nrelative soil moisture\
    \ content. By using this system, farmers can volumetrically optimize their irrigation\n\
    methods, applying water to speciﬁc locations within the root system of various\
    \ plants. Through the\nvirtue of the system’s affordability (can be less than\
    \ 10 dollars in mass production), multiple units may\nbe placed throughout the\
    \ ﬁeld to enable the most efﬁcient irrigation. In addition, analysis of historical\n\
    data allows for optimization and planning of future watering techniques.\nHydrology\
    \ 2017, 4, 54\n3 of 14\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. System Design\nIn contrast\
    \ to single-point moisture sensors, the present system measures volumetric relative\
    \ moisture\ndistribution. This is done by measuring soil resistance between multiple\
    \ points located on opposite sides\nof the tested volume, followed by data processing,\
    \ which reconstructs the three-dimensional moisture\ncontent. Similar to conventional\
    \ tomographic imaging in which transmission through the sample is\nmeasured at\
    \ different angles [26], the present approach effectively probes resistance throughout\
    \ the\nvolume at various angles. For this reason, two sets of electrodes need\
    \ to be placed on opposite sides\nof the tested volume as shown in Figure 1. The\
    \ volumetric distribution of soil moisture content is\ndetermined from soil resistance.\
    \ Two sets of electrodes are placed at opposite sides of a plant root.\nResistance\
    \ between all pairs of electrodes is measured multiple times per second. Measured\
    \ data\npaired with exact time and location from a GPS signal is transferred via\
    \ a wireless connection and\nsimultaneously stored locally on an SD card. Electrode\
    \ arrays can compose different geometries,\nincluding a rectangular, circular,\
    \ or other grids. One example of an easy-to-install electrode array\nis shown\
    \ in Figure 1b, which consists of individual ﬂat rods, each containing four electrodes.\n\
    Corrosion-resistive metals should be used for electrode plating, similarly to\
    \ other existing soil moisture\nsensors. Due to their simple construction, the\
    \ electrodes can also be disposable and can be recoated\nat the start of each\
    \ season. The placement of sensors relative to each other and to the tested volume\n\
    determines the measured values of resistance. Therefore, separate electrodes should\
    \ be installed at\nnearly equal intervals but not to a millimeter accuracy. A\
    \ very accurate alignment of electrodes is not\nneeded and manual installation\
    \ is sufﬁcient for the operation of present system.\nFigure 1. (a) Schematic diagram\
    \ of the solar-powered standalone data acquisition device. (b) One example\nof\
    \ the electrode configuration. Such electrode arrays can be easily installed and\
    \ removed in/out of soil.\nAfter acquiring resistance values, the solar-powered\
    \ control unit pairs these values with the\nexact time and location retrieved\
    \ from a GPS signal, which can be used to locate the position of a\nparticular\
    \ sensor if multiple systems are used throughout the ﬁeld or if historical data\
    \ is analyzed\nfor a sensor that was moved around the ﬁeld. Data is stored locally\
    \ on an SD card and sent via a\nwireless connection. The system continuously self-adjusts\
    \ for the most precise measurements in the\ngiven medium, as described in Section\
    \ 2.2.\nTheoretically, the system is capable of measuring the quantitative moisture\
    \ content with\nappropriate calibration. However, for practical irrigation purposes,\
    \ it is not necessary to know the\nexact value of moisture content. It is important\
    \ to make a decision on where and when water should be\napplied and when irrigation\
    \ should be stopped. If information on the moisture content at a single point\n\
    is sufﬁcient for irrigation control, the present system does not have any beneﬁts\
    \ compared to accurate\nsensors, such as ones based on the measurement of the\
    \ dielectric constant. However, when real-time\nvolumetric information is used\
    \ to optimize the irrigation protocol for a large ﬁeld (thus requiring many\n\
    sensors) the present affordable (and yet not very accurate system) can be an attractive\
    \ alternative to\nthe existing sensors. Compared to single-point sensors, the\
    \ present system can provide volumetric\ninformation, which would otherwise require\
    \ installation of many single point devices into the volume\nHydrology 2017, 4,\
    \ 54\n4 of 14\nof the soil, not to its periphery, as in present system. The number\
    \ of devices to be implemented per unit\narea has to be decided based on how much\
    \ variation of moisture content is expected in a particular\nﬁeld. The deﬁciency\
    \ of resistivity measurement in the present system limits its practical use to\
    \ the\nmeasurement of relative moisture content and thus requires in-ﬁeld calibration.\n\
    For a particular soil, calibration can be carried out to determine the resistance\
    \ of dry soil and the\nresistance of soil with an adequate moisture content for\
    \ a particular crop. The user has to decide what\nthe state of dry soil is (and\
    \ record those values with a press of a button), as well as record the resistance\n\
    of properly irrigated soil. The frequency of this recalibration is currently determined\
    \ somewhat\nsubjectively, unless a correlation to an absolute moisture content\
    \ sensor is implemented. With these\ntwo values, the measurement of relative moisture\
    \ content becomes sufﬁcient for irrigation control. It is\nto be determined for\
    \ a particular soil and a particular ﬁeld how often the calibration procedure\
    \ has\nto be performed in order to provide sufﬁcient accuracy for the irrigation\
    \ system and remains to be a\nsubjective decision. Correlation with an accurate\
    \ single-point sensor can be utilized as well for more\nprecise criteria on how\
    \ frequently the system needs to be re-calibrated. Since all measurements are\n\
    performed in real-time, it will be known when watering should be stopped. The\
    \ resistance measured\nbetween every pair of electrodes on opposite electrode\
    \ arrays is used to reconstruct the volumetric\ndistribution of moisture.\nThe\
    \ system switches between different pairs of electrodes through the use of electronic\n\
    multiplexers (as shown in Figure 2). The soil resistance is found from the voltage\
    \ drop across resistor\nRtest,—as shown in Figure 2a—for one pair of electrodes.\
    \ Figure 2b shows the principle of resistance\nmeasurements carried out by multiple\
    \ electrode pairs. A voltage drop across the programmable\nresistor (Rtest) is\
    \ measured by two electrodes from opposite electrode arrays that are connected\
    \ to\nthe circuit by multiplexers, which in turn are controlled by shift registers.\
    \ The use of shift registers\nenables a large number of electrodes to be controlled\
    \ by a single microcontroller. The programmable\nresistor is automatically optimized\
    \ to improve the accuracy of the results. Resistance Rsoil (i,j) between\nall\
    \ pairs of electrodes is measured multiple times per second. To minimize the number\
    \ of necessary\nmicrocontroller pins, a series of shift registers is used to set\
    \ necessary signals for the control lines of\nmultiplexers. Therefore, the system\
    \ with a single microcontroller is scalable to large arrays, as a single\nmicrocontroller\
    \ is able to sequentially switch between many electrodes.\nFigure 2. (a) The principle\
    \ of soil resistance measurement in the present system (shown for one pair of\n\
    electrodes). (b) The principle of resistance measurements carried out by multiple\
    \ electrode pairs.\nHydrology 2017, 4, 54\n5 of 14\nTo measure the resistance\
    \ between a given pair of electrodes, the voltage drop across resistor Rtest\n\
    is measured by an analog to digital converter (e.g., the one available on an Arduino\
    \ microcontroller\nboard) as shown for one pair of electrodes in Figure 2a. The\
    \ resistance of the soil between a pair of\nelectrodes is calculated according\
    \ to the equation:\nRsoil = RtestV1\nVin − V1\n(1)\nwhere V1 is the measured voltage\
    \ drop (in volts) across the test resistor and Vin is the input voltage\n(5 V\
    \ in our case). The small (several volts) voltage drop across the soil volume\
    \ and the application\nof current for a short period of time should preclude electrolysis\
    \ or charging problems within the\nmeasured volume [27]. It is also very easy\
    \ to switch the polarity in such a system by implementing an\nelectronic relay.\
    \ To optimize the accuracy of measurements, a programmable resistor is used for\
    \ Rtest,\nas described in Section 2.2. All resistance measurements can be performed\
    \ in a fraction of a second,\nfollowed by real-time algorithmic reconstruction\
    \ of volumetric moisture distribution.\n2.2. Optimization of Measurement System:\
    \ Automatic Sensitivity Adjustment\nThe accuracy of Rsoil measurements depends\
    \ on the value of the test resistor Rtest. The value of\nthe test resistor needs\
    \ to be optimized for speciﬁc soils and moisture conditions, which can change\n\
    signiﬁcantly in different environments. The system automatically adjusts Rtest\
    \ to an optimized value\naccording to the following procedure: at a given time,\
    \ the resistance value between all pairs of\nelectrodes varies from Rsoilmin to\
    \ Rsoilmax, which results in measured values V1 of Equation (1), changing\nbetween\
    \ Vmax and Vmin (all in volts). To digitize the array of resistances most precisely,\
    \ this range of\nmeasured voltages should be maximized:\nVmax –Vmin = F(Rtest)\
    \ = 5\n\"\nRmax\nsoil\nRmax\nsoil + Rtest\n−\nRmin\nsoil\nRmin\nsoil + Rtest\n\
    #\n(2)\nThe range of measured voltages will be maximum when F′(Rtest) = 0:\nF′(Rtest)\
    \ = 5\n\"\nRmin\nsoil\n\0Rmin\nsoil + Rtest\n\x012 −\nRmax\nsoil\n\0Rmax\nsoil\
    \ + Rtest\n\x012\n#\n= 0\n(3)\nSince the resistance is only measured in positive\
    \ values and has only one critical point for the\npositive values of the argument,\
    \ the optimal value of Rtest can be found from the following equation:\nRtest\
    \ =\nq\nRmin\nsoil Rmax\nsoil\n(4)\nAt the beginning of each measurement cycle,\
    \ the present system determines Rsoilmax and Rsoilmin\nand calculates the optimal\
    \ value of Rtest for the present conditions according to Equation (4). If the\n\
    optimal resistance value is different from the current one, the microcontroller\
    \ adjusts the nonvolatile\nprogrammable resistor Rtest to that value, enabling\
    \ the most accurate measurement of soil resistance.\n2.3. Volumetric Reconstruction\
    \ of Moisture Content\nReconstruction of bulk resistivity values from the resistances\
    \ measured between the electrode pairs\nrequires an inversion procedure. A set\
    \ of 2-dimensional inversion procedures was implemented by\nBrillante et al. [25]\
    \ to form a quasi-three-dimensional matrix, allowed by the multiple sets of electrodes\n\
    installed through the entire volume. In the present system, the electrodes are\
    \ placed only on opposite\nsides of the volume and therefore two-dimensional inversion\
    \ cannot be implemented. A full 3D\ninversion procedure was not available in the\
    \ present study, although in the future it can be developed\nby an adaptation\
    \ of the existing Geotomo software tool [28]. A simpliﬁed, fast reconstruction\
    \ method\nHydrology 2017, 4, 54\n6 of 14\nwas applied in the present study, which\
    \ represents the location of moisture in the studied volume\n(although not as\
    \ precisely as in accurate analytical inversion). During approximated reconstruction,\n\
    it is assumed that current ﬂows between two electrodes in a straight line (as\
    \ shown in Figure 3),\nalthough the current ﬂows through the entire bulk of soil.\
    \ The simulation results of current ﬂow\npresented in Section 2.3.1 demonstrate\
    \ the sensitivity of the linear approximation to the location of the\nwet region\
    \ along the path between two electrodes. After all resistances between all pairs\
    \ of electrodes\nare measured, the reconstruction algorithm is implemented before\
    \ the system continues with next set\nof measurements. During the reconstruction\
    \ procedure, the volume between two arrays of electrodes\nis divided into virtual\
    \ cells with assigned indexes (k, l, m). For a given pair of electrodes, the algorithm\n\
    determines which cells are crossed by a virtual “current line” connecting electrodes.\
    \ The resistance\nmeasured between that pair of electrodes is then equally divided\
    \ between the subset of cells that\nare crossed by the virtual line. This process\
    \ is repeated for all electrodes (256 pairs in present 4 × 4\nelectrode system).\
    \ As a result, multiple values of resistance are assigned to each cell which can\
    \ be\ncrossed by multiple lines. Following that, an average resistance value in\
    \ each cell (k, l, m) is calculated\n(averaged over all crossings over a particular\
    \ cell). These values are sent out and stored on the local\nSD card. The resulting\
    \ three-dimensional distribution of resistances is correlated to the volumetric\n\
    distribution of moisture content, as soil becomes more conductive with increased\
    \ water concentration\n(as shown in Section 3.1).\nFigure 3. Virtual lines representing\
    \ current between electrodes on opposite arrays. Resistance measurements\nbetween\
    \ all pairs of electrodes are used for volumetric reconstruction of soil moisture\
    \ content.\nThe absolute values of moisture content can be calibrated for any\
    \ particular type of soil (as shown\nin Section 3.1). Alternatively, in practical\
    \ use, irrigation control system need to determine when soil is\ndry and should\
    \ be irrigated, as well as when to stop irrigation. The decision on when to start\
    \ watering\nin a particular irrigation pipe and when to stop it does not require\
    \ knowledge of resistance values but\ncan rather be based on the comparison of\
    \ the current resistance to the resistance of dry and wet soils.\nAfter installing\
    \ the electrode sets, the user must do only two simple calibration measurements\
    \ to ﬁnd\nthe resistance of dry soil and wet soil. With that simple calibration,\
    \ all results can be shown in real time\nas a ratio of current values to the resistance\
    \ of dry soil. The calibration has to be repeated at certain\nintervals, depending\
    \ on the variation of soil salinity as the season progresses, application of fertilizers\n\
    and other factors. After the user decides what soil conditions correspond to dryness,\
    \ the program\nremembers these conditions as a baseline. Similarly, it can be\
    \ deﬁned when soil is properly irrigated.\nAnother alternative solution for the\
    \ inaccuracies of resistance-based volumetric measurements can be\nthe correlation\
    \ of measured values with the measurements of one accurate single-point sensor\
    \ which is\nnot affected by environmental and soil composition factors, such as\
    \ a time domain reﬂectometry device.\nHydrology 2017, 4, 54\n7 of 14\n2.3.1. Computer\
    \ Simulation of Electrical Current Flow Pattern. Validity Check of Linear\nApproximation\
    \ Used in Reconstruction of Volume Resistivity\nThe approximated procedure used\
    \ for the tomographic reconstruction of volumetric distribution\nassumes that\
    \ most electrical current ﬂows along the linear path connecting two electrodes.\
    \ A computer\nsimulation model of three-dimensional current ﬂow is used to estimate\
    \ the variation of effective\nresistance between two electrodes in two cases,\
    \ when a wet soil region is placed in a direct path\nbetween two electrodes and\
    \ when it is placed away from it, as shown in Figure 4a. The Computer\nSimulation\
    \ Technology Studio Suite software is used for the simulation. An electroquasistatic\
    \ solver\nin the low frequency domain of the CST Studio Suit with a tetrahedral\
    \ mesh (with an adaptive mesh\nreﬁnement) was used for the simulation of the soil\
    \ region consisting of dry soil with an inclusion of\na wet region. A cube of\
    \ uniform conduction (representing a dry soil) contains two metal (copper)\nelectrodes\
    \ located on the opposite sides. A smaller volume with a higher conductivity value\
    \ is placed in\na direct path between two electrodes (as shown in Figure 4b),\
    \ as well as farther away from the direct line\nbetween the electrodes (Figure\
    \ 4c) and no wet region is modeled in Figure 4d. The resistance between\nthe two\
    \ electrodes is calculated to be 15.312 kΩ for case (b), 16.33 KΩ for case (c)\
    \ and 16.498 KΩ for\ncase (d), respectively (as shown in Figure 4). For a cube\
    \ containing only wet soil, the resistance would\nbe measured as 164 Ω. Cross\
    \ sections of the simulated volume include arrows that indicate the value\nof\
    \ conduction current density (Figure 4b,d). It is demonstrated that in the ﬁrst\
    \ case, a larger conduction\ncurrent (and thus lower resistance) should be measured\
    \ providing some sensitivity to the location of\nthe wet soil within the cube.\
    \ Although these results do not explicitly conﬁrm that linear approximation\n\
    can be used for the tomographic reconstruction, the experimental results presented\
    \ in the next section\ndemonstrate the capability of the present device to visualize\
    \ the location within the volume that has\nhigher moisture content due to the\
    \ application of water.\nFigure\n4.\nDistribution of computer-simulated conduction\
    \ current between two electrodes.\n(a) A 24 × 24 × 24 cm3 cube of dry soil (conductivity\
    \ 0.002 S/m, density 1200 kg/m3) contains a\n4 × 4 × 12 cm3 wet soil (conductivity\
    \ 0.2 S/m, density 1400 kg/m3) volume. This volume representing\nwet soil is positioned\
    \ between the two electrodes (b), farther away from the direct path between the\n\
    electrodes (c) and the cube consisting only of a dry soil (d). This model demonstrates\
    \ that the measured\nresistance depends on the location of the wet soil, despite\
    \ the fact that the current ﬂows through the\nentire soil volume.\nHydrology 2017,\
    \ 4, 54\n8 of 14\n3. Results\n3.1. Dependence of Soil Resistance on Moisture Content:\
    \ Calibration with the Present Device\nThe resistance of soil is known to have\
    \ a logarithmic relationship with the moisture content [15].\nDifferent types\
    \ of soil vary in their resistance values depending on their consistency, concentration\n\
    of salts, granularity and other factors. The dependence of soil resistance on\
    \ moisture content was\ncalibrated by the following procedure for two types of\
    \ soil. Soil 1 used in the present study was a\ngeneral Garden Soil mix available\
    \ from garden stores (three parts organic matter, such as peat, humus\nor sawdust;\
    \ one part combination of sand, perlite, vermiculite; one part sphagnum peat moss).\
    \ Soil 2\nhad density of 0.8 g/cm3, porosity of ~60% and ﬁeld water capacity of\
    \ ~12%. A pair of electrodes\nwas installed at a ﬁxed distance of 30 cm in a dried\
    \ soil sample and its resistance was measured.\nThis measurement was assumed to\
    \ correspond to a nearly zero moisture content (Soil 1 was dried for\na period\
    \ of ~3 months while dispersed into a thin layer). Subsequently a known amount\
    \ of water was\nmixed uniformly throughout the entire soil volume and resistance\
    \ was re-measured after each step\n(as depicted in Figure 5). The relative error\
    \ of measured values remained nearly constant (at ~20% level\nof the measured\
    \ resistance) within the range of 1–100 kΩ due to the fact that Rtest values were\
    \ adjusted\nautomatically for each measurement, as described in Section 2.2. A\
    \ logarithmic equation describes the\nmeasured values of resistance for both types\
    \ of soils. Although quantiﬁed water concentration can be\nreconstructed from\
    \ the measured resistances, in ﬁeld applications, only two points are needed for\
    \ the\noperation of the present device, as mentioned earlier. Other, more accurate\
    \ single-point measurement\ntechniques (e.g., the ones based on the measurement\
    \ of the dielectric constant [9–13]) can be used to\ncorrelate the relative volumetric\
    \ values obtained from the present system with the absolute moisture\ncontent\
    \ obtained at a particular point in the soil.\nFigure 5. The graph of soil resistance\
    \ versus water content measured for two different soil types at\n19 ◦C temperature.\
    \ The logarithmic ﬁt to the measured data is shown by two equations. Soil 1 initially\n\
    contained more fertilizer, resulting in lower resistance values. Two electrodes\
    \ with an area of 7.35 cm2\nwere placed 30 cm apart during this experiment.\n\
    3.2. Device Scalability: Limits on the Geometrical Size of the Measured Volume\n\
    The present system has a limited range of resistance values which can be measured\
    \ by the Arduino\nmicrocontroller with its ﬁnite internal resistance. As the distance\
    \ between the electrodes increases,\nthe measured resistance of the soil increases,\
    \ limiting the maximum distance between the electrodes\nwhich can be used in the\
    \ present device. At the same time, as the distance between the electrodes\nincreases\
    \ (e.g., in case of a plant with larger roots) the area of electrode can be increased\
    \ proportionally,\nHydrology 2017, 4, 54\n9 of 14\nmaintaining the measured resistance\
    \ within the optimal range of values (typically 1–100 KΩ). As the\narea of the\
    \ electrodes increases, the spatial resolution of the present system decreases,\
    \ while the number\nof virtual cells remains constant since the same number of\
    \ electrodes is used. Figure 6 demonstrates\nthe possibility to optimally adjust\
    \ the conﬁguration of electrodes to an optimal value, which allows for\nan accurate\
    \ measurement of resistance between the electrode pairs. These results demonstrate\
    \ that\nin order to keep the resistance in the same range required for accurate\
    \ measurements, an increase in\nelectrode separation can be compensated by an\
    \ increase of the electrode area. The linear dependence of\nmeasured resistance\
    \ on the inverse value of the electrode area conﬁrms that soil moisture distribution\n\
    can be effectively measured for various plants and crops by the present system.\
    \ These results indicate\nthat volumes as large as 1 cubic meter can be measured\
    \ by the present approach, when the electrodes\nare scaled properly. It should\
    \ be noted that the spatial resolution of the system scales with the number of\n\
    electrodes and their size. Since larger volumes require larger electrodes to be\
    \ used in order to maintain\nmeasurable resistances, the spatial resolution of\
    \ the present system should remain nearly constant in\nterms of measured pixels/voxels.\
    \ For a system of two pairs of 4 × 4 electrode arrays, for example,\n64 volumetric\
    \ voxels can be reconstructed and possibly more with the future development of\
    \ more\nsophisticated inversion procedures. Thus, in case of smaller separation\
    \ of electrodes, the absolute\nspatial resolution can be higher, as each pixel\
    \ of the reconstructed volume will also be smaller.\nFigure 6. The graph of resistance\
    \ versus the inverse area of electrodes measured for three different\nelectrode\
    \ separations.\n3.3. Dynamics of Water Penetration: Real Time Visualization of\
    \ Moisture Content through\nMeasured Resistance\nThe operation of the system is\
    \ demonstrated with the measurements of liquid penetration during\nwatering, which\
    \ was applied to one corner of the tested soil region (as schematically depicted\
    \ in\nFigure 7). The measurement of resistance between opposite pairs of electrodes\
    \ was conducted\ncumulatively over a period of several months for a soil volume\
    \ in a laboratory environment, while the\ntemperature was maintained within the\
    \ +18 ◦C to +24 ◦C range. No ﬁeld tests of the present system\nwere performed.\
    \ The present paper describes the concept of the system rather than a device ready\n\
    for a ﬁeld use. No substantial variation of measured resistances was observed\
    \ due to charging or\nelectrolysis effects, which (if existed) were below the\
    \ sensitivity of present system. The variation of\nrelative soil resistance during\
    \ watering is shown in Figures 8–10 as a function of time. Even before\nthe application\
    \ of water, various electrode pairs exhibited different resistance measurements,\
    \ as the\nelectrical connection between the electrode and the neighboring soil,\
    \ as well as local conductivity of\nthe soil itself, varied from one electrode\
    \ to another. In order to account for these irregularities, a ratio of\npresent\
    \ resistance values to the resistance of dry soil is calculated during the real-time\
    \ reconstruction\nof the moisture distribution. Due to this normalization process,\
    \ most unaccounted environmental\nHydrology 2017, 4, 54\n10 of 14\nor instrumental\
    \ factors apart from the application of irrigation are eliminated as the causes\
    \ of the\nvariation in measured resistance values.\nFigure 7. Schematic diagram\
    \ of the electrode conﬁguration used in the measurements presented in\nFigures\
    \ 8–10. Water was applied predominantly in the area above electrode #13. A water\
    \ barrier\n(container) was placed below the lowest row of electrodes (#1–#4) to\
    \ demonstrate measurements of\nhigh moisture concentration.\nFigure 8. Relative\
    \ resistance measured between pairs of electrodes shown as a function of time.\
    \ At 7:29\nwater was applied to soil above electrode #13. Initially, the water\
    \ accumulated near electrode #9 and\ndid not seep through the soil for several\
    \ minutes. This resulted in a rapid dip in resistance, shortly\nfollowed by a\
    \ rapid increase.\nFigure 9. Relative resistance measured between pairs of electrodes\
    \ at the bottom of the soil sample\n(electrode pairs #1–#4.), shown as a function\
    \ of time. Water accumulated at the bottom of the soil\nsample, resulting in a\
    \ rapid decrease of resistance for several electrode pairs.\nHydrology 2017, 4,\
    \ 54\n11 of 14\nFigure 10. The relative resistance measured between electrode\
    \ pairs #1, #5, #9, #13. While most of the\nwater propagated to the bottom of\
    \ the container, some accumulated near electrode #13, where it was\ninitially\
    \ applied and did not propagate downward for a relatively long time.\nAs shown\
    \ in Figures 8–10, after the application of water, there was a substantial change\
    \ in soil\nresistivity measured by electrode pairs that were located close to\
    \ the corner to which the water was\napplied (electrodes #1, #5, #9, #13). It\
    \ is interesting to note that water temporarily formed a pocket near\nelectrode\
    \ #9 (Figure 8), after which it streamed downward toward the bottom of the container.\
    \ A small\nchange in resistance was observed for electrode pair #11 and almost\
    \ no change in resistance was\nobserved for electrode pair #12, which was the\
    \ farthest from the water source. As expected, the water\nconcentrated at the\
    \ bottom of the container. As seen in Figure 9 electrode pairs #1–3 measured smaller\n\
    resistance values, while electrode #4, which was the farthest from the water source,\
    \ measured larger\nresistance values. At the same time, the resistance measured\
    \ by pairs #1, #5, #9 and #13 dropped\nquickly after the application of water\
    \ above that column of electrode pairs (Figure 10). A distinct\ndifference in\
    \ resistance near the top and bottom of the soil volume was observed, as most\
    \ water either\nstayed at the top of soil or propagated towards the bottom of\
    \ the sampled volume.\nA long-term process of water evaporation that leads to\
    \ reduced moisture content is depicted in\nFigure 11, where the averaged resistance\
    \ measured by all electrode pairs is shown to slowly increase\nover the period\
    \ of ~10.5 h.\nFigure 11. The average relative resistance values measured by all\
    \ pairs of electrodes as a function of\ntime. As soil dried, the measured resistance\
    \ values gradually increased toward the values of a dry soil.\nThe insert shows\
    \ the recovery of soil resistance during drying over a period of several days,\
    \ in between\ntwo consecutive applications of water.\nHydrology 2017, 4, 54\n\
    12 of 14\n3.4. Volumetric Reconstruction of Moisture Distribution\nAs opposed\
    \ to many existing single-point sensors, the present system provides tomographical\n\
    information on the three-dimensional distribution of relative moisture content\
    \ in real time.\nThe resistance values between various pairs of electrodes are\
    \ measured multiple times per second\nand the present reconstruction algorithm\
    \ can recover the approximated distribution at a similar rate.\nA more accurate\
    \ inversion procedure may be developed in the future allowing for precise volumetric\n\
    reconstruction. During its creation, the affordability of the present device was\
    \ one of the main\nconsiderations for its wide use in the irrigation control and\
    \ monitoring systems. With two calibration\nvalues (the resistance of dry soil\
    \ and the resistance of properly irrigated soil), a user can decide when,\nwhere\
    \ and how much water should be applied to the soil, as well as the time when irrigation\
    \ should\nbe stopped at a speciﬁc location. An example of three-dimensional soil\
    \ moisture tomography of\nthe described system is shown in Figure 12. The measured\
    \ values are normalized by the moisture\ncontent of dry soil, which was measured\
    \ before watering. This ﬁgure demonstrates how water\npenetration into soil can\
    \ be tracked in real-time (as distinguished by the color in Figure 12, depicting\n\
    a three-dimensional representation of dry soil regions where water was not applied\
    \ yet as well as\nirrigated regions). The three-dimensional dynamics of water\
    \ penetration can be observed with the\nhelp of the present system, as shown by\
    \ the instantaneous snapshots in Figure 12. The present\nsystem can depict the\
    \ relative moisture content between pre-calibrated dry and wet conditions, not\n\
    the absolute value of the moisture content (which can be achieved by accurate\
    \ single point devices).\nA real-time feedback for the irrigation control system\
    \ can be implemented with the present instrument.\nIf a multi-faucet irrigation\
    \ system with independent controls is available, the described system can\ndetermine\
    \ at what time the watering should be started and stopped at a speciﬁc location\
    \ around plant\nroots, allowing minimal use of water and optimized efﬁciency of\
    \ irrigation.\nFigure 12. Three-dimensional visualization of relative moisture\
    \ content. Water was applied at the top\nleft corner (as shown in Figure 7). Six\
    \ consecutive images show the dynamics of water over ~3 min\nperiod. The time\
    \ passed since water application is shown below each image.\nHydrology 2017, 4,\
    \ 54\n13 of 14\n4. Conclusions\nA standalone, affordable system that provides\
    \ volumetric information on soil moisture\ndistribution can be an attractive addition\
    \ to the existing moisture sensors used in the irrigation control\nsystems. Despite\
    \ the fact that the present system requires frequent re-calibration and is inferior\
    \ to many\nwidely used moisture sensors in terms of absolute value of moisture\
    \ concentration, it provides unique\nvolumetric information on the relative moisture\
    \ distribution within the sampled soil volume. Low-cost\ndata acquisition devices\
    \ can be sparsely distributed at various locations throughout an irrigated ﬁeld\n\
    and synchronized with real-time control systems. At the same time, historical\
    \ data, which can be stored\nautonomously on each data acquisition device over\
    \ a period of many months, can be used for future\nplanning and optimization of\
    \ watering procedures for each speciﬁc crop. Moreover, high efﬁciency\nof irrigation\
    \ applied to the roots of speciﬁc plants can be achieved with this tomographic\
    \ moisture\ninformation. The described system can be combined with environmental\
    \ factors (e.g., temperature,\nhumidity, wind, brightness of sun, etc.), which\
    \ can be measured by the same device with the addition\nof various optional sensors.\
    \ Although three-dimensional moisture measurements have been conducted\npreviously\
    \ [21–23], the ease of electrode installation and removal is an essential feature\
    \ of the present\ndevice, making it attractive for multi-unit use in the agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld. By implementing the described\nsystem, farmers can signiﬁcantly improve\
    \ the efﬁciency of agricultural irrigation, leading to more food\nproduction with\
    \ less water.\nAcknowledgments: The author would like to thank his advisers, Betty\

    Wireless sensor network (WSN) can play an important role during precision agriculture
    production to promote the growth of the

    agricultural economy. Te application of WSN in agricultural production can achieve
    precision agriculture. WSN has the biggest

    challenge of energy eﬃciency. Tis paper proposes a model to eﬃciently utilize
    the energy of sensor nodes in precision agriculture

    production. Te proposed model provides a comprehensive analysis of the precision
    agriculture. Te model focuses on the

    munication in short distance and long distance. Our proposed model also suggests
    improvement measures for the shortcomings

    of existing WSN in the context of energy eﬃciency to provide an information platform
    for WSN to play a better role in

    agricultural production.

    1. Introduction

    Agriculture has always been an important pillar industry in

    the process of China’s economic construction. Because of the

    existence of excessive fertilization in agricultural production

    activities, some phenomena such as farmland pollution,

    environmental deterioration, and biodiversity destruction

    have been brought into consideration [1]. Tese factors

    seriously aﬀect the production, growth, and economic

    construction of the agriculture ﬁeld. To promote the sus-

    tainable development of modern agriculture, the advanced

    scientiﬁc production technology is required to be considered

    along with good management of agricultural production

    activities. In the process of precision agriculture, the use of

    WSN can play a signiﬁcant role in the context of energy

    eﬃciency. Precision agriculture is a management strategy in

    the process of agricultural production. It uses information

    technology reasonably and continuously improves the

    output and quality of agricultural production [2]. It also

    reduces the degree of environmental pollution and waste of

    energy and resources. Te resources include energy and

    water. It improves the accuracy and modernization of ag-

    ricultural production.

    In China, the development of precision agriculture is still

    in the exploratory stage and faces many key technical

    problems. It is necessary to scientiﬁcally adopt modern

    monitoring means and fully control the use of pesticides and

    fertilizers. Moreover, proper monitoring and control are also

    required [3, 4]. At present, precision agriculture is still in the

    early stage of exploration and faces many key technical

    problems to be solved. For instance, the use of chemical

    fertilizers and pesticides can greatly improve food pro-

    duction. It is observed that the lack of scientiﬁc monitoring

    for soil fertility, plant diseases, and insect pests can aﬀect the

    plants badly. In addition, the lack of fast and eﬀective

    perception technology and equipment can also lead to the

    poor food production process. Moreover, the blind use of

    chemical fertilizers and pesticides may not only cause a lot of

    Hindawi

    waste of resources but also bring serious soil and envi-

    ronmental pollution. Due to the variety and high cost of

    applied sensors needed in precision agriculture to overcome

    these challenges, the product has not yet achieved market

    scale due to the lack of standardization research. At present,

    there are many restrictive factors in the use of agricultural

    sensors, such as diversiﬁed conditions, bad working envi-

    ronment, insuﬃcient power supply, and short service life.

    Moreover, the agricultural production base is far away from

    the city due to which the public information and commu-

    nication infrastructure are poor and the cost of special

    communication means is high. Tere are spectrum com-

    patibility and interference problems as well.

    WSNs are utilized for the measurement of temperature,

    monitoring the environment, measurement of irrigation sys-

    tem, and measurement of water supply in agricultural appli-

    cations. WSNs support the farmers to generate high quantity

    crops. However, they require a battery power supply to provide

    energy to sensor nodes. Tese networks increase the quality

    and production of the crops which directly aﬀect the economy.

    Recent studies have found that many problems in the

    implementation of precision agriculture will be gradually

    solved with the application and development of these networks.

    Te application of wireless sensor network in agriculture is one

    of the most favorable methods to achieve precision agriculture,

    improve the yield of food crops, and reduce the burden of

    farmers. Te use of WSN is signiﬁcant for ensuring the healthy

    growth of crops to achieve precision agriculture [5, 6]. It can

    minimize the use of pesticides, eﬀectively control weeds and

    pests, and achieve eﬃcient green precision agriculture. WSN

    can sense and collect real-time data of various information

    changes in the process of agricultural production and provide

    timely feedback to the users. Te data analysis and processing

    results are forwarded to users to realize the eﬃcient man-

    agement of precision agriculture.

    Tis paper discusses the development potential of WSN

    in agricultural production from the communication pro-

    tocol perspective. Te paper focuses on the characteristics of

    WSN and expands its application in precision agriculture. In

    addition, the paper also puts forward some technical

    prospects to provide a good reference for comprehensively

    and eﬀectively improving the overall development level of

    precision agriculture. Te paper further analyzes the ap-

    plicability and limitations of the existing sensor networks

    used in agricultural production technology.

    Te rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section

    2, the background studies in the context of our work are

    presented. In Section 3, our proposed design for moisture

    monitoring and automatic water-saving irrigation system is

    discussed. In Section 4, we discuss our monitoring and early

    warning of diseases and insect pests. In Section 5, simulation

    results are provided followed by concluding remarks in

    Section 6.

    2. Background and Related Work

    During the rapid deployment of WSN technology, the

    battery power supply with sensor nodes is mainly used as an

    energy supply [7, 8]. Te WSN is a collection of detached and

    devoted sensors that observe and record the semantic state of

    the surroundings and transfer the recorded information to a

    principal site. WSN architecture and the detailed structure

    are shown in Figure 1. Battery-powered WSN consists of

    sensor nodes, processors, and radio frequency (RF) modules.

    Te sensor node can communicate wirelessly through the

    communication link and forward its data to the base station

    or coordinator node through the gateway communication. A

    node is used to collect, compute, and communicate the data

    and information with its associate nodes in a particular

    network. Te communication can collect information from

    various sensors in sensor nodes from simple (i.e., humidity,

    pressure, and temperature) to complex (i.e., positioning,

    tracking, microradar, and image) and then combine and

    transmit it to the wireless sensor network to realize real-time

    monitoring of WSN. Terefore, the sensor nodes have the

    function of monitoring, storing, and processing information

    in the whole monitoring process [9]. Te communication

    will send the information to the WSN to implement the real-

    time monitoring function. WSN has a wide range of ap-

    plication eﬀects to obtain suﬃcient and accurate environ-

    mental information in the process of precision agriculture.

    WSN includes three major components: base station, sensor

    node, and sink node [10–12].

    Te sensor node has the ability to communicate and

    compute. Te connection process adopts the form of short-

    range wireless, which can form a multihop wireless network.

    Te introduction of wireless sensor network into precision

    agriculture can fully monitor the growth data of crops, com-

    prehensively obtain the agricultural environment information,

    and support the steady development of precision agriculture

    activities [13, 14]. WSN itself has low power consumption,

    simple use, and low cost. It can adapt to the agricultural

    production environment and has long-term stable perfor-

    mance. It can design some data acquisition algorithms with

    modern agricultural characteristics to signiﬁcantly improve the

    speed of data acquisition and support the smooth development

    of precision agriculture activities. Currently, WSN is exten-

    sively utilized in monitoring the agriculture ﬁeld to advance the

    quality of service (QoS) and enhance the production of

    farming. In this agriculture ﬁeld, the sensors collect diverse

    kinds of information (e.g., CO2 level, humidity, and temper-

    ature) in instantaneous situations.

    Te WSN can not only realize precision agriculture and

    improve agricultural yield but also be used in other agri-

    cultural applications. It can be utilized for soil nutrient data

    to predict the health status of crops and the quality of ag-

    ricultural products [15, 16]. In addition, it can also be

    utilized for predicting irrigation planning by observing

    weather conditions (such as temperature and humidity) and

    soil moisture. Relevant sensor nodes can be added to the

    existing WSN to improve the parameter agricultural

    monitoring system and expand the network. However, there

    are some problems in the application of WSN in agriculture,

    such as determining the best deployment scheme, mea-

    surement cycle, routing protocol, communication range,

    scalability, and fault tolerance [17]. Te decentralized de-

    ployment of sensor nodes requires a long time of data

    collection, and the communication link may be weakened or

    2

    Scientiﬁc Programming

    lost due to signal attenuation. Te sensor nodes in wireless

    sensor networks are powered by battery, which is limited to

    the limited battery power, so there are some problems in

    WSN, such as power consumption and battery life extension.

    Although the application of WSN has been increasing for

    many years, the application of WSN is limited due to the

    slow development of the battery manufacturing industry

    [18]. UAV or UAV can be connected with the base station to

    establish mobile data connection service to meet the re-

    quirements of the battery power ampliﬁer and solve the

    problem of the long distance between farm and base station.

    Tis connection allows sensor nodes to relay their data to the

    base station in the farmland area, which can buﬀer the limit

    of the wireless sensor battery.

    Te Internet of Tings (IoT) is the revolution of the In-

    ternet, which connects all things that can be connected. Te

    development of mobile cellular network technology plays a

    vital role in the ﬁeld of IoT. Narrowband Internet of Tings

    (NB IoT) is a new IoT system based on the current devel-

    opment of cellular network LTE function [19]. Narrowband

    IoT can share the LTE spectrum without interference and can

    use the same device to connect to LTE main network seam-

    lessly, supporting all network facilities, such as security,

    tracking, policy, billing, and authentication [20]. NB IoT has

    very low power consumption, which can extend the battery life

    for 10years. Te design goal of narrowband IoT has the

    characteristics of low power consumption, wide coverage,

    many connection points, low cost, and so forth. In the near

    future, NB IoT technologies such as long-distance radio Lora

    and SIG fox will play an increasingly important role in agri-

    cultural IoTdue to their advantages of low power consumption

    and long-distance transmission. Te WSN has a wide range of

    applications including the agriculture production where it is

    extensively utilized in monitoring the agriculture ﬁeld to ad-

    vance the quality of production of farming. However, the

    battery power supply with sensor nodes is mainly used and

    eﬃcient utilization of the energy is one of the big challenges

    during the rapid development of WSN technology.

    3. Design of Moisture Monitoring and

    Automatic Water-Saving Irrigation System

    Tis section provides the proposed design for moisture

    monitoring and water-saving irrigation system. Te pro-

    posed system is designed taking into consideration the fact

    that Xi’an city is rainy in summer and dry in winter and has

    abundant sunshine that is prone to drought and ﬂood. Te

    average water resources per capita of the city are less than

    500 cubic meters that is lower than the national average level.

    Based on this, a water-saving irrigation control system based

    on WSN is designed, and the system is mainly composed of

    low-power wireless sensor network nodes through ZigBee ad

    hoc network [21, 22]. Te soil moisture information pa-

    rameters to be monitored include soil water potential, soil

    moisture content, air temperature, relative humidity, and

    groundwater level. Te sensor used is a four-channel tem-

    perature and humidity transmitter. Trough the signal value

    measured by the sensor, the information parameters can be

    calculated by the empirical formula. A detailed description

    of the proposed design is provided in the upcoming

    subsections.

    3.1. Design of Automatic Water-Saving Irrigation System for

    Farmland. Te agricultural irrigation system based on WSN

    consists of four parts that are sensor node group, receiving

    node, irrigation controller, and irrigation pipe network as

    shown in Figure 2. Te sensor nodes carrying soil moisture

    are deployed according to the planting status and irrigation

    status of farmland to form an irrigation node group. Each

    node is responsible for monitoring the soil moisture in a

    small area. Te irrigation area node group and the receiving

    node constitute a typical WSN, using ZigBee wireless data

    transmission technology. Te sensor data are uploaded to

    the receiving node in the form of wireless multihop. Te

    automatic water-saving irrigation system is to lay an irri-

    gation pipe network on the farmland in the irrigation area

    and install an electric control valve on the pipe. Te overall

    system would be more ﬂexible if the water-saving irrigation

    control is ﬂexible. Te automatic water-saving irrigation can

    be transformed on the basis of the original irrigation pipe

    network. Te original irrigation pipe network can be in-

    stalled with an electric control valve to make better use of the

    original irrigation pipe network and reduce investment. In

    the area covered by WSN, the irrigation controller can spray

    irrigation in speciﬁc areas according to the sensor infor-

    mation. Te proposed system includes a particular module

    that is responsible for the supervision of the entire network.

    Te proposed Automatic Water-Saving Irrigation System is

    basically based on sensor-free network.

    3.2. System Function Module. Te hardware structure of the

    sensor node realized in the proposed design is discussed in

    this section and shown in Figure 3. Te hardware structure is

    mainly composed of controller module, sensor module,

    ZigBee protocol communication module, and solar self-

    powered module.

    3.3. Design of Irrigation Controller. S3c2410arm9 develop-

    ment board of embedded system is used as the mainboard to

    constitute the irrigation controller. Te receiving node

    transmits information through a serial port and processes

    the control information. An electric control valve is con-

    trolled by an I/O port. S3C2410 has 117 multifunction I/O

    ports. Te system has high scalability. Te WSN periodically

    detects the humidity (the period is 10 s) and uploads it to the

    irrigation controller. When the irrigation controller ﬁnds

    that the humidity detected by the WSN nodes in a certain

    area is lower than the speciﬁed value, it turns on the electric

    control valve of the pipe network in the area for sprinkling

    irrigation. When the soil humidity in the area rises to a

    certain value, the system will start sprinkling irrigation and

    close the electric control valve of the pipe network in this

    area to stop sprinkling.

    4. Monitoring and Early Warning of Diseases

    and Insect Pests

    Te Huainan City environment is taken into consideration to

    issue the early warning. Te warning is concerned with diseases

    and insects pests. Te planting patterns of Huainan City are

    basically one rice, one wheat (water and drought mixed

    cropping pattern), or one bean. Wheat and rice sheath blight

    are the main common diseases of grain crops in Huainan City.

    Tere is an information chain of data collection to data sub-

    mission and management, then data processing and fore-

    casting, and ﬁnally the pest forecasting information release in

    the content of pest monitoring and early warning. Te in-

    formation chain is also shown as follows:

    Data collection⟶data submission and management

    Data submission and management⟶data processing

    and forecasting

    Data processing and forecasting⟶pest forecasting

    information release

    Each link of the information chain is corresponding to

    the technology of data acquisition, data transmission, data

    processing, and data application in information technology.

    4.1. Associated Technologies. Te technologies related to

    monitoring and early warning are discussed in this section.

    Each link of the pest monitoring and early warning infor-

    mation chain involves sensor technology, database technology,

    expert system technology, artiﬁcial neural network technology,

    global positioning technology (GPS), geographic information

    system technology (GIS), network technologies, and com-

    munication technology. Among them, the automatic counting

    of microinsects mainly uses computer image processing

    technology to solve the problems of diﬃcult investigation and

    data acquisition. Te automatic recording device of insect

    trapping is to count the number of insects through scanning

    grating by using the attraction of sex attractant. Pad and GPS

    data acquisition and recording technology are mainly used for

    manual investigation of conventional diseases and insect pests.

    It is used to record the data and GPS positioning information at

    the same time. Te ﬁeld microclimate data are also recorded at

    the same time that is closely related to the occurrence of

    diseases and various pests. Te ﬁeld microclimate data mon-

    itoring technology mainly uses sensor technology and GPRS

    network communication technology to automatically obtain

    real-time microclimate data. Te data are relevant to diseases

    and various pests and transmit them to the database for

    standby.

    4.2. Technical Assembly and Matching. Te data collection

    technologies (the main data sources of the proposed system)

    are assembled with data transmission technology. It can

    provide real-time and reliable monitoring data of diseases

    and pests and microclimate for the data management sys-

    tem. Insect pests and environmental factors in the data

    management system are considered as the input of the expert

    system. Te inference engine of the expert system is driven to

    forecast the diseases and insect pests, and the forecast in-

    formation is released through the forecast information re-

    lease system to guide the plant protection work.

    5. Simulation Analysis of Precision

    Agriculture Effect

    Te simulation analysis is performed in this section for the

    precision agriculture eﬀect. In order to master the growth

    status of animals and plants and improve the scientiﬁc

    management level, it is necessary to monitor the speciﬁc

    physiological and ecological indicators of animals and

    plants. In the past, the monitoring methods were relatively

    backward, which aﬀected the growth control activities of

    animals and plants. At this stage, WSN is actively in-

    troduced in the process of precision agriculture pro-

    duction, which can automatically sense the state of crop

    growth link at a lower cost. In addition, an intelligent

    system is used to accurately monitor, analyze, and record

    the physiological and ecological parameters of animals

    and plants that provide a good premise for eﬀectively

    improving the eﬃciency of monitoring work as shown in

    Figures 4 and 5.

    Te lack of water resources is an important factor for

    restricting the current economic growth, but there is a se-

    rious waste of agricultural water. It is necessary to strengthen

    the research work of water-saving irrigation. Te good

    application of WNA (Wireless Network Agriculture) is the

    monitoring of water during the process of crop growth and

    comprehensively monitoring of the actual water and soil

    moisture in the irrigation area. Te WNA is basically a

    simple WSN (Wireless Sensor Network) that is utilized for

    agriculture applications and production. It also formulates a

    scientiﬁc and eﬀective irrigation scheme combined with the

    development of these crops. However, it should be noted

    that the application of WSN in agricultural production is not

    widespread, mostly in a small-scale production environment

    such as tea garden, orchard, and greenhouse, and further

    research. Te development is needed in large-scale farmland

    production.

    It is evident from Figure 4 that agricultural irrigation

    based on wireless sensor network has played a very good role

    in water saving with the increase of time. It is necessary to

    monitor the speciﬁc physiological and ecological indicators

    of animals and plants for mastering the growth status of

    animals and plants to improve the scientiﬁc management

    level. In the past, the monitoring methods were relatively

    backward, which aﬀected the growth control activities of

    animals and plants. At this stage, WSN is actively introduced

    in the process of precision agriculture production, which can

    automatically sense the state of crop growth link at a lower

    cost. In addition, an intelligent system is used to accurately

    monitor, analyze, and record the physiological and eco-

    logical parameters of animals and plants that provide a good

    premise for eﬀectively improving the eﬃciency of moni-

    toring work.

    Figure 5 reveals that the energy eﬃciency of precision

    agriculture based on WSN is far lower than that of tradi-

    tional agriculture according to the data from January 2020 to

    May 2021.

    6. Conclusion

    Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have the biggest chal-

    lenge of energy eﬃciency. Tis paper suggests a scheme to

    eﬃciently utilize the energy of WSN in precision agriculture

    production. Te proposed model aims to bring improve-

    ment measures for the shortcomings of existing WSN in the

    context of energy eﬃciency to provide an information

    platform for WSN to play a better role in agricultural

    production. WSN can play an important role in the growth

    of the agricultural economy. It is evident from the results

    that WSN can achieve precision agriculture by improving

    accuracy and eﬃciency and reducing the cost of wireless

    protocol systems. Precision agriculture can use the agri-

  analysis: '**Type of data most applicable to irrigation management and their typical
    sources**


    The type of data most applicable to irrigation management includes:


    - **Soil moisture data**: This data provides information about the amount of water
    in the soil, which is crucial for determining when and how much to irrigate. Soil
    moisture sensors can be used to collect this data.

    - **Weather data**: This data provides information about the weather conditions,
    such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall. This data can be used to predict
    crop water needs and to adjust irrigation schedules accordingly. Weather stations
    or weather APIs can be used to collect this data.

    - **Crop data**: This data provides information about the growth stage of the
    crop, which can help to determine the water needs of the crop. Crop sensors or
    visual inspection can be used to collect this data.

    - **Irrigation system data**: This data provides information about the performance
    of the irrigation system, such as the flow rate and pressure. This data can be
    used to identify and fix problems with the irrigation system. Flow meters and
    pressure sensors can be used to collect this data.


    **Typical sources of these data include:**


    - **Sensors**: Sensors can be used to collect data about soil moisture, weather
    conditions, crop growth, and irrigation system performance. Sensors can be placed
    in the field, on the irrigation system, or on the crop itself.

    - **Data loggers**: Data loggers can be used to store data collected from sensors.
    Data loggers can be placed in the field or on the irrigation system.

    - **Software**: Software can be used to collect, store, and analyze data from
    sensors and data loggers. Software can also be used to create irrigation schedules
    and to control the irrigation system.'

    \ is being developed\ncontinuously. It provides secure mechanism of deploying\
    \ nodes underground which shields them from\nany outside temperament or harsh\
    \ weather conditions. This paper works towards introducing WUC and\ngive a detail\
    \ overview of WUC. It discusses system architecture of WUC along with the anatomy\
    \ of the\nunderground sensor motes deployed in WUC systems. It also compares Over-the-Air\
    \ and Underground\nand highlights the major differences between the both type\
    \ of channels. Since, UG communication is\nan evolving field, this paper also\
    \ presents the evolution of the field along with the components and\nexample UG\
    \ wireless communication systems. Finally, the current research challenges of\
    \ the system are\npresented for further improvement of the WUCs.\nKeywords: soil\
    \ sensing; decision agriculture; Wireless Underground Communications\n1. Introduction\n\
    Wireless Underground Communication (WUC) is becoming popular because of the security\n\
    provided by its deployment methodology, i.e., far below the ground. Underground\
    \ communication\nwas ﬁrst observed in World War, however, its use was limited\
    \ to radio propagation techniques only.\nV. Fritsch and R. Wundt conducted the\
    \ experiments, in 1938–1940, to study the propagation of radio\nwaves in underground\
    \ coal mines using small transceivers in the ground. The communication range\n\
    varied depending upon the nature of the coal, however, an overall range of upto\
    \ 1000 feet was\nsuccessfully achieved. In 1942, they conducted another experiment\
    \ but this time in 100 feet thick salt\nmine at the depth of 2000 feet. For this\
    \ experiment, they used horizontal dipole antennas battery\noperated transmitter\
    \ and receiver. They were able to successfully communicate over a range of\n15\
    \ km, i.e., 9–1/2 miles. They performed voice communication using the amplitude\
    \ modulation.\nThe experiment was performed with extreme care and intelligence\
    \ avoiding any noise or extra radio\nsignals at transmitter and carefully selecting\
    \ the location of transmitter and receiver nodes at different\nlocations from\
    \ each other. It was made sure that no measurable wave existed on the earth surface\
    \ so\nthat true underground propagation can be studied. Since then, underground\
    \ communication has come\nlong way with improvement in methodologies and equipment.\
    \ This paper discusses the potential and\nchallenges of underground communication.\n\
    WUC is being used in many applications: border patrol, precision agriculture,\
    \ and environment\nmonitoring. WUC mainly consist of two components:\nsensors\
    \ and communication devices.\nThese components are either completely or partially\
    \ buried in the soil. WUC aims to provide real-time\nsoil monitoring and sensing.\
    \ In precision agriculture, WUC is mainly used for sensing and monitoring\nof\
    \ soil and other related physical properties [1–14]. The WUC are also being used\
    \ to implement border\nmonitoring for stop border inﬁltration [15,16]. Other monitoring\
    \ applications of WUS includes pipeline\nSmart Cities 2020, 3, 1513–1561; doi:10.3390/smartcities3040072\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/smartcities\nSmart Cities 2020, 3\n1514\nmonitoring and landslide\
    \ monitoring [4,14,17,18]. Other important component of WUC is the wireless\n\
    communication which is proved to be an emerging ﬁeld of study as well. There exist\
    \ few models in\nthe literature which represents underground communication. Underwater\
    \ communication [19,20]\nhas same challenging medium as in underground communication.\n\
    However, for underwater\ncommunication, acoustic waves [19] are used instead of\
    \ EM waves due to very high attenuation\nof EM waves in the water. Acoustic propagation\
    \ has its own disadvantages such as: low quality of\nphysical link and higher\
    \ delays because of low speed of sound, extremely low bandwidth, challenging\n\
    deployment and size and cost of equipment. These disadvantages restrict the use\
    \ of acoustic methods\nfor WUC.\nSmart Farming [1–7,21–25] is an agricultural\
    \ management process which exploits the spatio-temporal\nchanges in crop, soil,\
    \ management and production with new technologies to improve the farming\nexperience.\
    \ Smart farming employs large number of wireless devices to sense crop-related\
    \ data and send\nthis data to a central control room or server center [26,27].\
    \ In recent years, sensing technologies have\nevolved a lot. These advanced sensing\
    \ methods are then combined with adaptive input applications\n(e.g., adaptive\
    \ application of fertilizers) and soil mapping methods for efficient operation.\n\
    The advanced sensing technology have risen the demand for increased data rate\
    \ and extended\ncommunication distance. As per the reports of Cisco’s visual networking\
    \ index [28], by 2020, 11.6 billion\ndevices are predicted to be connected via\
    \ Internet. The vastness of this number can be realized by\nthe fact that population\
    \ of the world, by 2050, is predicted to be 10 billion, i.e., even less than number\n\
    of devices connected by 2020. To fulﬁll food requirement of the such huge population\
    \ of the world,\nit is imperative to utilize smart farming to its full extent\
    \ for better and cost-efﬁcient crop production\nmethod through timely decision\
    \ making and conserving natural resources. To that end, it is important\nto achieve\
    \ an ubiquitous connectivity on farms by using underground wireless communications\n\
    channel [21,26,29].\nWireless Underground Communications (WUC) applications can\
    \ be classified into various\ncategories [30–32]. Some of them, for example, includes:\
    \ environment monitoring such as precision\nagriculture and landslide monitoring,\
    \ infrastructure monitoring for better maintenance and operation of\nunderground\
    \ infrastructure, e.g., preventing leakage, application for determining location\
    \ can be helpful\nin locating people stuck in disaster, and security monitoring\
    \ applications, e.g., to detect infiltration at\nborder through concealed underground\
    \ devices. Figure 1 shows some of these applications [6,33].\nWUC and conventional\
    \ wireless networks differs majorly with respect to their communication\nmedium.\
    \ WUC sensor nodes communicate through soil where as over-the-air terrestrial\
    \ wireless\nnetwork uses air as a medium to communicate. The signal propagation\
    \ in soil is never investigated\nproperly before, in fact, electromagnetic (EM)\
    \ wave propagation was not even considered a viable\noption for underground communication.\
    \ Therefore, feasible options and solutions are explored to\ndevelop a power-efﬁcient\
    \ underground communications\nThere exists no detailed wireless channel model\
    \ because of the challenges experienced in\ndeveloping power-efﬁcient underground\
    \ communication which also hinders the protocol development\nin WUC. To overcome\
    \ this, existing literature was studied in detail along with a very detailed and\n\
    time-intensive experiments [34–38]. The results from these experiments were analyzed\
    \ over the period\nof 18 months to generalize performance of underground communication\
    \ channel. A summary of those\nresults can be found in [39]. It was found that\
    \ many soil parameters (e.g., soil texture and moisture\nand irregular soil surface),\
    \ and antenna parameters (burial depth, antenna design, and operating\nfrequency)\
    \ has effect on UG communication. It proved the underground channel dependence\
    \ on\nspatio-temporal environmental factors leading to a unique correlation of\
    \ communication system\n(information dn communication medium) with environment.\
    \ Hence, in addition to operational and\ndeployment factors, an underground channel\
    \ must not ignore these parameters.\nSmart Cities 2020, 3\n1515\nFigure 1. Use\
    \ of Wireless Underground Communications (WUC) in different areas.\nA wireless\
    \ underground communications (WUC) model has been developed and presented in [39].\n\
    The model focuses on propagation model rather than antenna problem. The WUC model\
    \ determines\nthe total signal attenuation and the BER (bit error rate) using\
    \ three-wave components (direct wave\n(DW), reﬂected wave (RW), and lateral wave\
    \ (LW) factors), dielectric soil properties prediction model,\nand the signal\
    \ superposition model. In contrast to existing literature, WUC model captures\
    \ the gain\nfrom the directivity of special antennas instead of simple insulated\
    \ dipole [6,22]. However, to avoid\nover-complication of the model, antennas problem\
    \ are not considered in this model because of large\nnumber of antennas schemes.\n\
    The in-situ experiments were done without considering lateral wave component.\
    \ If lateral waves\nare also considered using special antennas, an extended communication\
    \ range can be achieved using\nthe same transmitting power. The results obtained\
    \ from the study helped in designing WUC systems.\nA strong multi-hop networking\
    \ solution among the buried nodes can be achieved with long range\n(distance >\
    \ 10 m) eliminating the topology dependency on above-ground devices.\nIn [39],\
    \ authors have shown that depth has high effect on communication performance.\n\
    Through empirical evaluations, they observed that even a small change in depth\
    \ can degrade the\ncommunication performance. The difference in communication\
    \ performance between topsoil and\nsubsoil is because of:\n•\nSoil parameters.\
    \ Both, topsoil, and subsoil, differs in soil texture and soil moisture [40] which\n\
    causes the difference in communication for both mediums [1,8,15,34]. For example,\
    \ topsoil will\nhave more soil moisture level as compared to subsoil during rain\
    \ or irrigation because it takes\nlonger for water to reach subsoil area [41].\n\
    Smart Cities 2020, 3\n1516\n•\nSoil surface effects. LW and RW component plays\
    \ an important role in signal strength of topsoil.\nTherefore, topsoil signal\
    \ experiences much less attenuation than subsoil.\nIt is preferred to have a shallow\
    \ deployment of UG nodes in WUC because it decreases the\npropagating path in\
    \ the soil causing signal to suffer less attenuation. However, the depth is highly\n\
    application-dependent, e.g., for intruder detection, recommended deployment depth\
    \ is 10 cm and\nsport ﬁeld irrigation, however, for precision agriculture depth\
    \ of 40–100 cm is mostly recommended.\nWUC does not contains only UG nodes. Hybrid\
    \ WUC is a combination of underground (UG) and\nabove-ground (AG) [1,8,25]. As\
    \ Hybrid WUC contains multiple types of devices, it also utilize multiple\ntype\
    \ of links for the communication, i.e., above-ground to underground (AG2UG), underground-to-\n\
    underground (UG2UG), and underground-to-above-ground (UG2AG). Here, this paper\
    \ focuses on the\ncharacterization fo WUC UG2UG channel. Moreover, other channels,\
    \ i.e., AG2UG & UG2AG channels,\ncan be characterized using WUC channel model.\n\
    Another method of underground communication, not given in Figure 2, is Through-The-Earth\n\
    (TTE). TTE is applied in areas like military UG communication, geophysical exploration,\
    \ and mining.\nIt is mainly used to communicate in emergency situations for communicating\
    \ with people stuck in\ndisasters, e.g., miners stuck in mines [42]. WUC & TTE,\
    \ with all their similarities, faces completely\ndifferent set of challenges (see\
    \ Table 1). For example, a typical depth considered for TTE deployment is\nvery\
    \ deep (hundreds of meters) as compared to WUC (few centimeters). Therefore, they\
    \ are considered\ntwo different technologies in the literature [25,43,44].\nFigure\
    \ 2. The different types of networking in (WUC).\nIt can be seen in the Table\
    \ 1 that most of the challenges faced by TTE and WUSN\nchallenges are related\
    \ to the physical layer. TTE struggles in traversing rocks with long-range\ncommunication,\
    \ and WUSN struggles with long-range communication through soil. Soil moisture\n\
    highly effect the subsoil communication [15,34,35], therefore, it requires cross-layer\
    \ approach [15,22].\nMoreover, WUC need power-efﬁcient nodes buried for long lasting\
    \ operations.\nRelative permittivity of a soil depends upon the signal frequency\
    \ and Volumetric Water Content\n(VWC), therefore, signal frequency indirectly\
    \ effect the strength of the signal [45,46]. In addition to the\nfrequency, soil\
    \ conductivity also has an effect on signal attenuation. This is in contrary to\
    \ the popular\nbelief that signal is less attenuated under smaller frequencies.\
    \ Hence, signal attenuation cannot be\nestimated from only soil permittivity as\
    \ other soil parameters are also involved [45,47].\nSoil permittivity estimation\
    \ has been investigated for speciﬁc range of frequencies. All such\nstudies conclude\
    \ that frequencies around 1 GHz produce reasonable soil permittivity values and\n\
    are suitable for practical wireless under 300 MHz frequencies. However, as the\
    \ frequency decreases,\nwavelength of the signal is increased, consequently, increasing\
    \ the antenna size. Hence, very low\nfrequencies, e.g., <300 MHz, are not feasible\
    \ for WUC. In military WUC, the major requirement is to\nget longer communication\
    \ range, e.g., <10 km. To that end, military WUC use HF to LF frequency band\n\
    ﬁlter with huge antennas consuming more power. It is shown that the signal suffers\
    \ with much less\nattenuation under UHF band (300 MHz–3 GHz), and frequencies\
    \ ranging from 300 MHz–1 GHz [34]\nwhich makes them optimal to be used in practical\
    \ WUC [27,48]. However, communication through\nSmart Cities 2020, 3\n1517\nthe\
    \ soil is different where the transmission signal suffers from various underground\
    \ impairments.\nHence, in this paper, we collect the literature on communication,\
    \ networking, and localization for\nburied smart objects.\nTable 1. Typical aspects\

    \ protocol design\nEmphasis on the physical layer\nCross-layer approach\nAnother\
    \ important WUC protocol is LoRa (stands for long range) [49]. It is developed\
    \ from chirp\nspread spectrum (CSS) technologies and is a physical layer spread\
    \ spectrum modulation technique.\nCSS transforms a single bit information into\
    \ a stream of bits spreading it over the complete spectrum.\nIt can operate over\
    \ a three carrier frequencies: 433 MHz, 868 MHz, and 915 MHz. The most prominent\n\
    feature and one of the major reason to use LoRa over Wi-FI and Bluetooth is its\
    \ ability to communicate\nover a large distance. LoRa also has an advantage of\
    \ being less prone to noise interference. The adaptive\ndata rate algorithm also\
    \ helps in extending the battery life of sensor nodes [50]. Overall, LoRa is\n\
    a suitable choice and beneﬁcial for IoT systems that requires to communicate over\
    \ long range.\nThis paper does not discuss LoRa because it reviews UG communication\
    \ in context of propagation\nmethods. However, LoRa is a complete communication\
    \ system with its own protocol (LoRaWAN) and\nspecialized equipment focusing mainly\
    \ on extending the range and lifetime of the sensor network.\nTherefore, LoRa\
    \ does not ﬁt in the current scope of the manuscript.\nThis study review the work\
    \ done in the ﬁeld of underground communication. There are few\nsurveys in the\
    \ literature which reviews different issues posed in WUC implementation. For example,\n\
    ref. [26] discusses the EM-waves based WUC for agriculture.\nIn [51,52], MI-based\
    \ WUC are\npresented along with the challenges and applications. Ref. [26] also\
    \ discussed various commercial\nand academic testbeds deployed for WUC. Ref. [53]\
    \ presents the challenges faced in implementing\nthe WUC in oil and gas environment.\
    \ This survey stands out from others in that it extensively\nexplores the communication\
    \ and networking solutions for the smart object buried and communicating\nthrough\
    \ the soil. Moreover, apart from the major communication technologies (EM and\
    \ MI), it also\ndiscusses the acoustic, mud-pulse telemetry and wired solutions\
    \ for the underground communication.\nFurthermore, this survey attempts to educate\
    \ and pique the interest of new and experienced researchers\nin the field. For\
    \ new researchers, it presents the tutorial content on UG communication in first\
    \ part\nof the paper in Section 2. For the experienced readers, the surveys stands\
    \ out in that it attempts to\nsummarize the current literature on popular as well\
    \ as lesser-known implementation technologies.\nThe paper is divided into two\
    \ major parts. First part of the paper is presented in complete Section 2.\nMoreover,\
    \ Sections 2–2.4 discusses the different aspects of WUC such as types of WUC channels,\n\
    difference between a traditional OTA wireless communication and UG communication,\
    \ limitations of\nOTA in UG environment, components and anatomy of WUC module,\
    \ in an extensive manner. Part II\nof the paper, i.e., Sections 3–8, presents\
    \ a detailed literature review on propagation techniques that\nSmart Cities 2020,\

    \ Structure.\nIn Part II, paper focuses on channel modeling, localization and\
    \ networking of the WUC\ntechnologies of EM and MI based communication. Since,\
    \ acoustic and mud-pulse telemetry are\nrelatively newer technologies and are\
    \ still in development stages, therefore, only channel models are\npresented for\
    \ these two technologies. EM-based methods are presented in Section 4, MI-based\
    \ in\nSection 7, Acoustic-based in Section 6, MPT-based in Section 5 and, wired\
    \ solutions in Section 8.\n2. Wireless Underground Communication\nMost commercially\
    \ available solutions uses over-the-air (OTA) communications. One of the major\n\
    challenge in implementing OTA solutions is their unknown environmental impact.\
    \ WUC employs soil\nmedium wireless underground communications. There are many\
    \ license-free solutions (e.g., ZigBee,\nBluetooth and DASH7) available for short-range\
    \ communication. These are used in Industrial, Scientiﬁc\nand Medical (ISM) bands.\
    \ Recently, FCC has loosened the restriction on using the TV white space\nfrequencies\
    \ for farms [54] (Order No. DA 16- 307 Dated: 24 March 2016). Interference with\
    \ other\nlicensed band is not expected in this space.\n2.1. Limitations of Over-the-Air\
    \ Wireless in Soil\nThere exist a many research challenges in development and\
    \ widespread of WUC. These challenges\nmust properly be investigated. A centralized\
    \ networking solution for WUC can be classiﬁed in to two\narchitectures: (1) One\
    \ with only buried UG nodes communicating with the AG node using UG links,\nand\
    \ (2) Hybrid WUC employing both UG and AG nodes (static and mobile) to communicate\
    \ through\nUG and OTA links [1,36,55]. Apart from OTA links, UG2AG and AG2UG links\
    \ are also being used\nextensively. Therefore, multi-hop networking involving\
    \ UG2UG links must be investigated in detail.\nA detailed analysis of UG2UG communication\
    \ must be performed to address the WUC challenges.\nObviously, all challenges\
    \ cannot be solved owing to the challenging environment of WUC, however,\nidentifying\
    \ and proposing solutions for the major challenges is also an important contribution\
    \ in it’s\ndevelopment. To this end, the WUC research challenges are discussed\
    \ below:\nAntenna problem: A radio communication can be analyzed theoretically\
    \ in two phases: (1) the\nantenna problem and (2) the propagation problem. WUC\
    \ model is an underground propagation\nmodel. A dipole antenna with an ideal isotropic\
    \ radiation pattern can guarantee high accuracy\nSmart Cities 2020, 3\n1519\n\
    with combination of generic antenna gains and initial decays. However, with unavailability\
    \ of ideal\nantennas, more practical approach would be to introduce specialized\
    \ antenna factor for DW, RW,\nand LW for more accuracy. Furthermore, performing\
    \ empirical investigations using large number\nof different values for burial\
    \ depths, transmit power levels, and VWC, can precisely address the\nantenna problem.\n\
    Adding antenna problem to underground channel model is a very complex task. The\
    \ complexity\nlevel increases a lot even if one component of antenna problem is\
    \ added to the problem To understand\nthe complexity, consider an example of the\
    \ radiation pattern of the antenna and its implied directivity\ngain. Figures\
    \ 4 and 5 shows how VWC impacts the radiation pattern of an antenna. First, change\
    \ in\nVWC changes the signal wavelength in soil which will also change the ration\
    \ between the wavelength\nof signal and antenna’s ﬁxed length (17.3 cm). The given\
    \ values are from Mica2 mote (a 1/4 monopole\nantenna) antenna operating at 433\
    \ MHz. The length/wavelength ratio considers two times of Mica2\nantenna length,\
    \ e.g., 34.6 cm, and half the wavelength of signal in soil or air. the two-fold\
    \ increase\nin length is mandatory because a 1/4 monopole antenna is same as 1/2\
    \ dipole antenna with ground\nstructure representing half of the antenna. Therefore,\
    \ 1/2 ratio for a half-wave dipole is shown for the\ncomparison. VWC causes decrease\
    \ in wavelength which in turn increase the length/wavelength ratio of\nantenna.\

    \ length and wavelength of the signal [37].\nFigure 5 plots the elevation pattern\
    \ of a linear dipole antenna (oriented vertically) with length\nmeasured in wavelengths\
    \ units [56]. the change in antenna′s length/wavelength ratio (Figure 4) is\n\
    represented as different radiation pattern (Figure 5). VWC causes increase in\
    \ ratio making the behavior\nradiation pattern monotonous.\nThe antenna problem\
    \ differs with type of antenna and orientation of antenna and should be\naddressed\
    \ accordingly for each antenna scheme. However, all antenna schemes are not suitable\
    \ for\nunderground communications. Therefore, it is recommended to identify antenna\
    \ schemes which can\nimprove the performance of UG2UG, UG2AG, and AG2UG links\
    \ to support WUC channel model with\nadding more antenna models. A possible solution\
    \ is suggested along with th results in [35,36,57–61].\nIt uses an ultra-wide\
    \ band antenna for UG2AG and AG2UG links and traveling-wave antenna to study\n\
    Smart Cities 2020, 3\n1520\nlateral wave propagation in UG2UG links. An empirical\
    \ investigation must be done to evaluate the\nsolutions for different depth and\
    \ transmit power level.\nFigure 5. Volumetric Water Content effecting radiation\
    \ pattern monopole antenna [37].\nBurial depth: The existing results show a strong\
    \ relation between depth and communication\nperformance. Adjusting depth can signiﬁcantly\
    \ extend the communication range with using high\npower transceiver. This has\
    \ been discussed in [34,62] and it has been said that there are some design\n\
    constraints in WUC which cannot be violated. For example, in crop irrigation,\
    \ nodes must be below\nthe topsoil region where plowing happens.\nIn WUC model,\
    \ burial depth can be deﬁned as the distance between antenna center and soil\n\
    surface. Hence, burial depth of sensors and radio modules has no effect on the\
    \ model but antenna’s\ndepth does. Therefore main challenge is the antenna deployment\
    \ in topsoil such that they are resilient\nto the mechanical activities being\
    \ performed in their vicinity. One solution is installing and removing\nnodes\
    \ while these activities, however, it increases the cost of deployment. Besides\
    \ cost, installation\nand calibration of soil sensors is also a time taking process.\
    \ In some scenarios, where sensor(s)\nand processors are permanently ﬁxed in subsoil,\
    \ easy installation/removal is only possible for\ncommunication module near to\
    \ soil surface (see Figure 6). In such cases, sensors are ﬁxed and\nlong-range\
    \ communication module is the only removable module. This module require a short-range\n\
    transceiver (with deeply buried sensor nodes) and a transceiver which enables\
    \ communication between\nabove-ground devices and other long-range modules. There\
    \ is a need to investigate best value for\nburial depth (including dbg = 0) for\
    \ such long-range module.\nHousing for the sensor nodes: In some WUC, concealment\
    \ of sensor nodes is more important\nthan high depths. One solution is to use\
    \ plastic boxes which can conceal processor, communication\nmodule and antennas.\
    \ However, it has never been investigated in detail for UG2UG communication\n\
    and preliminary experiments shows completely different effects on communication\
    \ performance.\nA scenario using stratiﬁed media (air/soil) must also be analyzed\
    \ for UG2UG links in WUC.\nDirect and reﬂected waves: So far, communication through\
    \ lateral waves has been presented\nas a power-efﬁcient solution to achieve a\
    \ long range UG2UG communication. WUC model can be\nmodiﬁed into a simple LW model.\
    \ However, it is not recommended to do so, because the short range\nSmart Cities\
    \ 2020, 3\n1521\ncommunication is mainly based on DW (Figure 6). Some components\
    \ of WUC model can also be\nused in development of UG2AG/AG2UG channel models.\
    \ Inter-node distance can be increased using\ndirectional antennas and high-power\
    \ transceiver.\nFigure 6. The WUC deployment.\nLateral waves: There is a need\
    \ of detailed empirical and theoretical evaluation of lateral wave\npropagation\
    \ for UG2UG links in WUC. The results discussed are highly limited by the power-efﬁcient\n\
    transceiver and antennas. Special antennas and high-power transceivers must be\
    \ used to achieve\nlong-range communication. It will contribute towards complete\
    \ validation of WUC model.\nEffect of using terminated traveling-wave antennas\
    \ needs to be studied. These antennas were\nused for underground communication\
    \ previously [30,48,57–59]. Therefore, these studies can be\nre-investigated for\
    \ a typical WUC scenario with modiﬁed deployment parameters. The power\nrequirements\
    \ of multi-hop LW/UG2UG technique and centralized one-hop UG2AG/AG2UG must be\n\
    studied in detail to give extremely important power related guideline for developing\
    \ WUC.\nIt is also important to study the impact of snow, water and obstacles\
    \ in surface on UG2UG links\ncommunicating using lateral waves. The results from\
    \ such studies can further complement WUC\nmodel. These studies can be used for\
    \ security purposes, e.g., detecting intruder in border patrol\napplication. The\
    \ detection process uses the disturbance of wireless channel (Figure 7).\nFigure\
    \ 7. Lateral waves can potentially be applied in security applications for WUC.\n\
    UG2AG and AG2UG channel models: A detailed channel model for UG2AG and AG2UG links\n\
    must be developed. There exists no generic model which can be applied to all WUC.\
    \ There are some\npreliminary empirical investigation done by [35,36,63], however,\
    \ an in-depth theoretical analysis is\nstill needed. Overall power requirement\
    \ for such solution also needs to be investigated. Lateral wave\npropagation already\
    \ has its application in UG2UG links. However, a comparative study for the power\n\
    budgets of multi-hop LW/UG2UG approaches and centralized one-hop UG2AG/AG2UG is\
    \ required.\nSmart Cities 2020, 3\n1522\n2.2. Components of UG Communications\n\
    In UG communications, UTs are completely concealed. It reduces the operational\
    \ cost and external\nimpact from the environmental and weather changes [3,25].\
    \ Buried radios (UTs) can communicate\nin any one of the two scenarios: (1) communication\
    \ with devices above the ground termed as\nAbove-ground (AG) communication, (2)\
    \ communication between the UTs is termed as Underground\n(UG) communication.\
    \ Furthermore, soil-air interface effect the AG communication links. Due to\n\
    interface, these links are not symmetric and must be analyzed bidirectionally,\
    \ i.e., UG-to-AG and\nAG-to-UG communication. It shows that in order to achieve\
    \ multi-hop connectivity, a practical distance\nfor UG communication is limited\
    \ to 12 m. For AG communication, a communication range up to 200 m\nis possible.\
    \ If the UG communication medium is soil, it can have effect on success of the\
    \ communication\nis following six ways:\n•\nChanges in Soil Bulk Density and Soil\
    \ Texture: Electromagnetic (EM) waves suffers\nfrom attenuation in the soil. Soil\
    \ is composed of various components such as pore spaces,\nclay, soil and silt\
    \ particles. There can be 12 soil textures depending upon relative concentration\
    \ of\nthese particles [21,64]. Bound water is the major component responsible\
    \ for EM waves attenuation\nin the soil. The amount of bound water varies from\
    \ one soil type to other. For example, sandy soil\nhas less bound water from silt\
    \ loam and silty loam, hence, it suffers from lower attenuation.\nSimilarly, medium\
    \ textured soils holds more water than coarse soils because of lower pore size.\n\
    •\nVolumetric Water Content (VWC) of Soil (Soil Moisture): The effective permittivity\
    \ of a soil is\na complex number. Therefore, in addition to diffusion attenuation,\
    \ EM waves suffers attenuation\ndue to absorption of water content by the soil\
    \ [3,34,65]. Dielectric spectra conductivity of the soil\nis dependent on SM.\
    \ For a dry soil, dielectric constant is in the range of 2 and 6 and conductivity\n\
    is in the range of 10−4 to 10−5 Si/m. For a near-saturation level soil, range\
    \ of dielectric constant\nis 5 to 15 and that of conductivity is 10−4 to 10−5\
    \ Si/m [66]. Coherence bandwidth of UG channel\nis a few hundred KHz [8,24,25].\
    \ Coherence bandwidth changes with the change in SM which\nmakes the designing\
    \ process more challenging.\n•\nDistance and Depth Variations: EM waves attenuation\
    \ also depends upon travel distance and\npath and WUC sensors are normally buried\
    \ in the top sub-meter layer. Therefore, received\nstrength of the signal distance\
    \ and depth of antennas. In WUC, sensors are buried in subsoil\nlayers and topsoil\
    \ [26,35,36]. Burial at higher depth causes higher attenuation [8].\n•\nAntenna\
    \ in Soil: Return loss of buried antenna varies due to high permittivity of soil\
    \ [43,67].\nSM variations changes soil permittivity which in turn causes variations\
    \ in return loss. Resonant\nfrequency is shifted to lower frequency spectrum due\
    \ to change in return loss. Moreover,\nachieving high overall system bandwidth\
    \ also becomes challenge for UG communications.\n•\nChange in Frequency: The path\
    \ loss resulted by attenuation is dependent on frequency [68].\nHigh frequencies\
    \ suffers high attenuation because water absorption is major factor in higher\n\
    frequencies. The soil EM waves have shorter wavelength as compared to EM waves\
    \ in the air\nbecause of higher permittivity of the soil. Channel capacity in\
    \ soil is also determined by operation\nfrequency [67].\n•\nLateral Waves: Underground\
    \ nodes communicate with each other using anyone of the three\nmajor paths: direct,\
    \ lateral and reﬂected (LDR) waves [3,6,24,25]. Direct and reﬂected waves\nare\
    \ most effected by above-mentioned challenges because their complete travel path\
    \ is through\nthe soil. On contrary, lateral waves can travel on soil-air interface\
    \ in air, hence, they experience\nlowest attenuation among all. Therefore, lateral\
    \ waves are the most important component to\nconsider while extending the UG communication\
    \ range.\n•\nDevelopments in WUC: UG communications have evolved a lot since its\
    \ inception. A lot of\nwork is done for the characterization of UG channel and\
    \ cross-layer communication solutions to\nget long communication range and high\
    \ data rate. In [6,44], authors capture and analyze impulse\nresponse of UG channel\
    \ through detailed experimentation.\nSmart Cities 2020, 3\n1523\nA total of 1500\
    \ UG green-house testbeds has been developed to analyze the effect of soil moisture\n\
    and soil texture on wireless UG communication channel. These experiments helped\
    \ in developing\nmain characteristic of wireless UG channel impulse response such\
    \ as: root mean square delay spread,\ncoherence bandwidth, and power of multi-path\
    \ components. It also validates main components of\nUG channel, i.e., direct,\
    \ lateral and reﬂected waves. The coherence bandwidth is decreases with the\n\
    distance in soil, e.g., it is shown in [6] that coherence bandwidth lower than\
    \ 1.15 MHz can decrease\nupto 418 kHz when distance increase more than 12 m in\
    \ soil [6]. Root mean square delay spread is\naffected by the soil moisture needs\
    \ tp be adapted to changing moisture value. In [22], an important\nstatistical\
    \ model for UG multi-carrier communication and soil moisture adaptive beamforming\
    \ is given\nfor WUC solutions.\n2.3. Types of Wireless Underground Channel\nLateral\
    \ waves have been extensively used in UG communication [33,57,69,70] and empirically\n\
    evaluated by [57–59]. Special antennas (eccentrically insulated traveling-wave\
    \ (EITW) antenna) are\nused for empirical evaluation. Underground lateral wave\
    \ communication is empirically evaluated\nthrough following UG2AG experiment setup:\
    \ burial depth is 40 cm, above-ground antenna and soil\nsurface were separated\
    \ by the distance of 55 cm, transmit power level is maintained at +30 dBm,\nand\
    \ 144 MHz frequency is used. The study [57] was successful to achieve long communication\
    \ range\nof 50 m [71].\nIn [72–74], authors performed experiment to empirically\
    \ evaluate UG2AG communication.\nThe experiment setup for this study is given\
    \ as follow: Terrestrial commodity sensors MicaZ [75] motes\nwere used as UG node,\
    \ operational frequency of 2.4 GHz, burial depths of 0, 6, and 13 cm, and transmit\n\
    power level of 0dBm was used. The experiments was performed in two sets of sender-receiver\
    \ scenario.\nBoth sets differed with respect to distance between soil and receiver.\
    \ For ﬁrst set, the receiver was\nkept on the soil (distance = 0 m) and the second\
    \ one had a distance of 1 m between soil and the\nreceiver. The UG2AG communication\
    \ was evaluated for two metrics: packet error rate (PER) and\nreceived signal\
    \ strength (RSS). First experiment was used as baseline experiment to compare\
    \ it with\nthe second experiment. It was observed that node buried at 13 m depth\
    \ was able to communicate at\nmaximum horizontal distance of 2.5 m and node at\
    \ 6 cm depth achieved a maximum of 7 m horizontal\ncommunication range. Hence,\
    \ it shows that attenuation is inversely proportional to the path covered\nby\
    \ the signal in the soil. The study achieved the PER of 10% [76–78].\nIn [55,79,80],\
    \ a uni-directional UG2AG communication model was studied with the effect of\n\
    reﬂection dielectric effect of soil surface on the signal attenuation. They validated\
    \ the model by\nperforming the laboratory experiments. The experiment setup was\
    \ as follow: SoilNet was used as\nsensors node, operational frequency was 2.44\
    \ GHz, transmit power of +19 dBm was used, and sensor\nwere buried at different\
    \ depth ranging from 5–9 cm. The strength of the received signal was measured\n\
    by a soil probe. It was observed that for soil width of 1 to 7 cm, signal attenuation\
    \ was increased up\nto 25 dB. However, 10 dB of attenuation was attributed to\
    \ increased VWC (0 to 35%) in soil [29,52].\nMoreover, bulk density and bulk electrical\
    \ conductivity had a negligible effect on signal attenuation.\nThe results conﬁrms\
    \ the empirical results given in [39].\nUG2AG communication model has also been\
    \ developed using customized sensor nodes [30,60].\nmodel using a customized sensor\
    \ node: Soil Scout. The experiment setup had an operation frequency\nof 869 MHz,\
    \ transmit power of +10 dBm. It used ultra wideband elliptical antenna [52,81,82]\
    \ for\nunderground communication [9] and model validation. The model predicts\
    \ signal attenuation on the\nbasis of (a) reﬂection effects of the soil surface,\
    \ (b) dielectric loss of the soil, and (c) refraction effect of\nEM waves at soil\
    \ surface (angular defocusing). It was shown that wideband antenna radiation pattern\n\
    is independent of soil texture and soil moisture and showed efﬁcient radiation\
    \ in different soil type\nwith varying soil moisture levels. The study [60,83,84]\
    \ was successful to achieve long communication\nrange of 30 and 150 m at the burial\
    \ depths of 40 cm and 25 cm, respectively.\nSmart Cities 2020, 3\n1524\nIn [85–87],\
    \ experiments are performed using customized sensor nodes. The experimental setup\n\
    uses burial depth of 10 cm, operational frequency of 868 MHz, and transmit signal\
    \ power of +10 dBm.\nAG2UG and UG2AG communication links are evaluated by performing\
    \ empirical experiments [35].\nIt uses Mica2 motes as sensor nodes, operational\
    \ frequency and transmitting power are 433 MHz\nand +10 dBm, respectively. Moreover,\
    \ they use an ultra-wide band antenna [25,82] which ends up\nimproving communication\
    \ range signiﬁcantly by effectively communicating at 22 m and 37 m at the\ndepths\
    \ of 35 cm and 15 cm, respectively. Similarly, [36] performs AG2UG and UG2AG experiments\n\
    with Mica2 motes for precision irrigation application [88,89].\nAlthough UG2UG\
    \ communication has been investigated a lot in the existing literature, however,\n\
    there is still a gap in literature for detailed UG2UG communication channel characterization\
    \ in\nsubsurface soil region. Only few studies [15,31,34,62] have performed theoretical\
    \ and empirical analyses\nof UG2UG communication link. Therefore, a detailed characterization\
    \ of UG2UG communication\nchannel is presented in the coming sections.\n2.4. Anatomy\
    \ of a WUC Module\nThe underground nodes currently used in WUC testbeds suffer\
    \ from several shortcomings.\nThese shortcomings lead to reduced communications\
    \ performance in WUC, reduced experimental\neffectiveness, and higher costs. To\
    \ address these faults, there is need of nodes tailored to WUC.\nThe following\
    \ capabilities are desirable in these nodes [39,90]:\n•\nEnvironmental Factors:\
    \ The current generation of WUC nodes is designed to support academic\nresearch,\
    \ primarily in a laboratory setting.\nAs a result, the nodes lack several important\n\
    features that aid in deployments in uncontrolled environments. First, the WUC\
    \ nodes cannot\nbe reprogrammed without interfacing to a special hardware board.\
    \ If the devices are to be\nreprogrammed in the ﬁeld, they must either be dug\
    \ up, or each mote must be deployed with the\nadditional hardware programming\
    \ board. Digging up the WUC nodes is a time-consuming and\ndifﬁcult process. Deploying\
    \ the additional hardware to reprogram the WUC nodes underground\nis expensive,\
    \ and complicates deployments [39,70,90].\nSecond, the these nodes cannot be recharged\
    \ remotely. If the batteries are exhausted during an\nexperiment, a buried mote\
    \ must be dug up, and the batteries replaced. Again, this is an extremely\ntime\
    \ consuming operation, and the performance of an experiment may be suboptimal\
    \ until the\nnode is replaced [31,84,88].\n•\nPropagation: While the current experiments\
    \ demonstrate the viability of WUC, the performance\ncould be further enhanced\
    \ by tailoring the radio of the mote to the needs of the underground\nnetworks.\
    \ The radios of the current WUC nodes are designed to transmit over the air.\n\
    The parameters are of the radios are not well matched to the the environment of\
    \ WUC in\nterms of transmit powers and frequencies. The existing WUC nodes can\
    \ be modiﬁed to better\nmatch the desired parameters, but this is not as effective\
    \ as choosing a radio speciﬁcally matched\nto the needs of a WUC node [33,52].\n\
    •\nSensing: The sensor packages that can be deployed with the current generation\
    \ of WUC nodes\ndo not collect all the information desired on the underground\
    \ environment, or contain many\nextraneous sensors that are not useful for WUC.\
    \ The extraneous sensors increase the cost of\ndeploying experimental testbeds.\n\
    These areas can all be improved upon with a node designed speciﬁcally for WUC.\
    \ In the next\nsection, the design of a mote speciﬁcally created for WUC will\
    \ be presented. This new mote will\naddress the sensing, communications, and power\
    \ needs of nodes in a WUC.\nSmart Cities 2020, 3\n1525\nTo address the challenges\
    \ raised in the previous section, a WUC node should be designed to\noperate on\
    \ limited power reserves, monitor the underground environment, and communicate\
    \ the\nresults to aboveground nodes. The design of the different desirable aspects\
    \ of a WUC node is described\nin the following sections [39,90,91].\n1.\nTransmitter/Receiver:\
    \ The radio should feature a high transmit power, and should be able to operate\n\
    on a variety of sub-1GHz frequencies that are suitable for WUC [89]. The radio\
    \ implementation\ncan be adopted to the speciﬁc needs of the antennas and RF environment\
    \ of WUC, to increase the\ntransmission range and capabilities of the device.\n\
    2.\nMicrocontroller: The microcontroller should have the ability to provide processing\
    \ power [6].\nOne such example is the MSP430 that is extremely energy efﬁcient,\
    \ also extends the lifetimes\nof the deployed sensors. The MSP430 can interface\
    \ to a variety of sensors, communication,\nand storage devices.\n3.\nSensors:\
    \ The WUC node should contains a built in accelerometer and temperature probe,\n\
    and should be able interface to an external soil moisture sensor. This combination\
    \ of sensors\nenables the node to accurately measure the characteristics of the\
    \ underground environment.\nThese measurements can adapt the behavior of the radio\
    \ to its environment in real-time.\nAccordingly, the sensor readings can be used\
    \ to assess the viability of energy harvesting through\nkinetic vibrations [8].\n\
    4.\nData Repository: The WUC nodes should have a on-board micro-SD card for storage.\
    \ This large\nstorage space can be used to store extensive sensor readings for\
    \ long term monitoring of the\nunderground environment. By including this large\
    \ storage capability, the system can sense at a\nmuch higher rate than it can\
    \ transmit information. After an extended deployment, the information\nfrom nodes\
    \ can be recovered, and a highly detailed model of the underground environment\
    \ can\nbe developed from the saved sensor readings [22].\n5.\nEnergy: The WUC\
    \ node should support a variety of energy sources with energy harvesting and\n\
    external power transfer support that enables the system to sense at higher rates\
    \ and operate for\nlonger periods of time than the current generation of WUC nodes\
    \ [39,90,92]. Moreover, the nodes\nshould also support recharging through a USB\
    \ cable that should be accessed from above-ground\nafter the node has been deployed.\
    \ Accordingly, the device can be recharged quickly in the ﬁeld,\nwithout the need\
    \ to remove a node and redeploy the in the testbed. Accordingly, the mote can\
    \ be\nenhanced with kinetic energy harvesting capabilities that will further increase\
    \ the lifetime of the\nWUC nodes.\n3. Signals in the Soil: Propagation Techniques\n\
    In this section, the recent advances in propagation techniques for signals in\
    \ the soil are discussed.\nA detailed overview of different signal propagation\
    \ techniques is given. A comprehensive review\nof research challenges EM-based\
    \ propagation techniques and networking is done. The evolution of\nunderground\
    \ wireless is also discussed. Moreover, different component of the of UG communications\n\
    are Wireless. The WUC system architecture is explained with a detailed discussion\
    \ of the anatomy\nof an underground mote.\nThe examples of ug wireless communication\
    \ systems are explored.\nFurthermore, the differences of UG Wireless and Over-the-Air\
    \ Wireless are debated. Different types of\nwireless underground Channel (e.g.,\
    \ In-Soil, Soil-to-Air, and Air-to-Soil) are reported as well.\nWUC implementation\
    \ is challenging because of its unfavorable condition and environment.\nThe challenging\
    \ environment of WUC puts some operational constraint on all of its components.\n\
    These constraints are low-power sensing, long-range communication, efﬁcient networking\
    \ and accurate\nlocalization. Signiﬁcant difference between WUC and in-air IoT\
    \ lies in deployment of sensor nodes,\ni.e., underground, and communication medium,\
    \ i.e., soil instead of air. Sensing has been discussed\nwith great detail in\
    \ Chapter 10. This section explores some communication systems which can be used\n\
    in the implementation of WUC [6,93].\nSmart Cities 2020, 3\n1526\nSoil, as opposed\
    \ to air, is a heterogeneous medium consisting of sand, rock, watersheds which\
    \ can\nhave severe degradation effect on signal propagation. There are different\
    \ technologies that can be used\nfor WUC. The wired solutions uses coaxial cables\
    \ and ﬁber optics. Wired solutions provide high data\nrates and are being used\
    \ in different applications [78,94,95]. Although, these wired solutions provides\n\
    reliable and accurate communication, however, they increase the complexity and\
    \ poses scalability\nissues. Given the disadvantages of wired systems, wireless\
    \ solutions are termed as feasible solutions\nto provide relatively low complexity\
    \ and scalable solutions.\nWireless underground communications with magnetic induction\
    \ (MI) has also been studied\nin [5,96–100]. However, there are limitations to\
    \ MI based solutions. Their signal strength attenuates\nwith inverse cube factor\
    \ and have very low data rates. MI communication is also dependent on\nposition\
    \ of receiver and sender as it cannot communicate if both receiver and sender\
    \ are perpendicular\nto each other. Furthermore, long wavelength of the magnetic\
    \ channel does not allow network to scale.\nThese disadvantages of MI and its\
    \ inability of communicating with the above-ground devices MI is\nnot suitable\
    \ for WUC.\nSome literature [65], and [83,101] has performed channel models for\
    \ underground communication\nwithout empirical validation. Integration of WUC\
    \ and precision agriculture cyber-physical systems\nand center-pivot systems is\
    \ given in [3]. Underground channel is empirically evaluated in [34,35],\nhowever,\
    \ they did not consider the antenna bandwidth for evaluation. A 2-wave path loss\
    \ model is\ndeveloped by the authors in [101], without considering the lateral\
    \ waves. Path loss prediction model\nhas been proposed in [79] but underground\
    \ communication is no considered. In [14], authors develop\nan underground communication\
    \ model for mines and road tunnels. However, it cannot be used\nin WUC die to\
    \ difference in wave propagation in tunnel and soil. A model is proposed by [65,102]\n\
    for closed-form path loss with lateral waves but this simple model cannot capture\
    \ statistics and\nimpulse response of the channel. Researchers have also characterized\
    \ coherence bandwidth of the\nunderground channel [6].\nUnderground wireless communication\
    \ is a developing ﬁeld and there is no detailed discussion\nabout the channel\
    \ capacity in the literature. Capacity of single-carrier underground communication\n\
    channel has been discussed in [67]. This discussion, however, does not consider\
    \ practical modulation\nscheme and does not perform the empirical validation.\
    \ In [8], the authors perform the capacity\nanalysis of multi-carrier modulation\
    \ in underground channel on the basis of empirical measurements\nof coherence\
    \ bandwidth, channel transfer function, and return loss of antenna under three\
    \ different\ntypes of soil and different soil moisture conditions.\nWUC antennas\
    \ are different form traditional communications antenna in that they are buried\n\
    in soil. In 1909, study of EM waves propagation started from the Somerfeld’s seminal\
    \ work [103].\nFor the complete 20th century, EM wave propagation in subsurface\
    \ stratiﬁed media and effect of\nmedium on EM waves has been investigated thoroughly\
    \ in many works [104–114]. This work analyzes\nthe electromagnetic ﬁelds of inﬁnitesimal\
    \ dipole of unit electric moment, however, it is desirable\nto use ﬁnite size\
    \ antenna with already known ﬁeld pattern, current distribution and impedance\
    \ for\npractical purposes. Field calculations and dipole numerical evaluations\
    \ for lossy half space was ﬁrst\nstudied in [115]. In [113], authors extensively\
    \ analyze the propagation of EM wave along the interface.\nHowever, this work\
    \ does not apply to underground buried antenna. Buried dipole were analyzed\n\
    in lossy half space in [109]. The authors presented the ground wave attenuation\
    \ factor of far-ﬁeld\nradiation from UG dipole and depth attenuation factor using\
    \ two vector potentials. However, it does\nnot consider the current reﬂected from\
    \ the soil-air interface. In [105], authors calculate the ﬁeld\ncomponent per\
    \ unit dipole using Hertz potential. The difference between the study in [105,109]\
    \ is that\nthe former ignores the displacement current in lossy half space. Authors\
    \ in [112] gives the Hertzman\ndipole in an inﬁnite isotropic lossy medium. EM\
    \ ﬁelds are improved by considering lateral waves and\nhalf-space interface in\
    \ [116,117].\nStudies in [118–120] analyze antennas in matter where antennas EM\
    \ ﬁelds have been theoretically\nderived in half space and inﬁnite dissipative\
    \ medium. These analyses assume perfectly matched dipole\nSmart Cities 2020, 3\n\
    1527\nantennas, hence, not considering the return loss. Relative gain expressions\
    \ and radiation efﬁcient of\nunderground antennas are developed in [108,114].\
    \ However, it did not present the empirical results.\nThe impedance of dipole\
    \ antenna inside the solutions is evaluated in [121]. It discusses the effect\
    \ of\nantenna depth, dipole length, and solution’s permittivity. However, this\
    \ work cannot be used in WUC\nbecause of difference in permittivity characteristic\
    \ of soil and solutions. Moreover, it does not consider\npermittivity change due\
    \ to soil moisture. The communications between the buried underground\nantenna\
    \ without considering the impact of orientation and impedance of antenna is studied\
    \ in [122].\nAnother work [71,123] conduct the performance analysis of four antenna\
    \ buried in refractory concrete.\nIn this work, the transmitter is buried at 1m\
    \ depth and author does not consider the concrete-air\ninterface. Circularly polarized\
    \ patch antenna are analyzed in [124]. It does not consider the interface\neffect\
    \ and antenna is buried at 3 cm depth in concrete.\nCurrent WUC applications and\
    \ experiments calculate the soil permittivity by using soil dielectric\nmodel\
    \ [15,47] which evaluates to actual wavelength used for the antenna design [31,60].\
    \ In [60],\nan WUC-based elliptical planar antenna is designed. It, using the\
    \ same frequency, compares the\nantenna wavelength in soil and air to determine\
    \ the size of the antenna. However, this methodology\nlacks in providing impedance\
    \ match. Results from the experiments on Impulse Radio Ultra-Wide\nBand (IR-UWB)\
    \ WUC without considering the effect of soil-air interface are presented in [125].\n\
    The surface-based lateral wave antenna are designed in [126], however, they do\
    \ not considers the\nunderground scenarios.\nImpedance change in soil cause disturbance.\
    \ This is similar to the disturbance caused by\nimpedance change of hand-held\
    \ device in close proximity with human body [127,128] or that\nby devices which\
    \ are implanted in the human bodies [129,130]. Experiments results obtained\n\
    from these applications shows that the human body contributes to performance degradation\
    \ of\nantenna. Even these studies are similar, they still cannot be used in WUC\
    \ because of the difference\nbetween the permittivity of soil and human bodies.\
    \ Permittivity of human body is greater than the\nsoil. Moreover, permittivity\
    \ of human body is static whereas soil has varying permittivity mainly\ndependent\
    \ upon the moisture. For example, at frequency of 900 MHz, human body has permittivity\
    \ of\n50 [128] and that of soil with 5% moisture is 5 [47].\nBeamforming has been\
    \ investigated for over-the-air wireless channel [131–137] and MI power\ntransfer\
    \ [138]. However, there exist no work in the literature on UG beamforming. Using\
    \ beamforming,\nlateral components [120] in UG communications can go to the longer\
    \ distance which is normally\nlimited to 8–12 m owing to high level of attenuation\
    \ suffered because of soil [6].\nThere has been discussion on soil permittivity\
    \ and soil moisture in the literature. Here some of\nthose techniques are discussed\
    \ for comparison purpose. This comparison will highlight the difference\nand similarities\
    \ between different techniques. Some of the method used for quantifying water\
    \ content\nin the soil includes: gravimetric method, GPR, TDR, capacitance probes,\
    \ hygrometric techniques,\ntensionmetry, nuclear magnetic resonance, resistive\
    \ sensors, gamma ray attenuation, electromagnetic\ninduction, remote sensing,\
    \ neutron thermalization, and optical methods.\nFirstly, techniques which are\
    \ used in laboratory for the soil properties estimations are discussed.\nlaboratory\
    \ based. Authors in [139] soil density, soil moisture and frequency to derive\
    \ EM parameters\nof the soil. The model restricted soil moisture weight to 20%\
    \ and it need rigorous methods of sample\npreparation. Authors in [140] develops\
    \ a probe-based lab equipment which uses vector network\nanalyzer (VNA) in the\
    \ frequency range of 45 MHz to 2.6.5 MHz. In [141], a model for estimating a\n\
    dielectric permittivity of soil is developed on the basis of empirical evaluation.\
    \ Authors in [68] develops\ntyje model for dielectric permittivity for frequencies\
    \ greater than 1.4 MHz. Peplinski in [47] modify\nthis model to work in the frequency\
    \ range of 300 MHz–1.3 GHz. A detailed survey for soil permittivity\nestimations\
    \ is given in [140]. All of these methods are performs in laboratories and requires\
    \ soil sample\nfrom the site. Collecting soil sample from the soil is very labor\
    \ intensive and do not represent he\nin-situ soil conditions. Therefore, it is\
    \ required to developed automated techniques for monitoring the\nsoil moisture.\n\
    Smart Cities 2020, 3\n1528\nAnother approach of measuring soil properties is given\
    \ in [142]. It is based on TDR and require\nrefractive index and impedance of\
    \ soil. A technique to estimate of EM properties of soils for detecting\nDense\
    \ Non-Aqueous Phase Liquids (DNAPLs) hazardous materials using Cross-Well Radar\
    \ (CWR)\nis given in [143]. This technique transmits wideband pulse waveform in\
    \ the range of 0.5 GHz to\n1.5 GHz. It also calculates soil permittivity with\
    \ transmission and reﬂection simulations in dry\nsand. The well-explained survey\
    \ on measurement of time domain permittivity in soils is presented\nin [144].\
    \ For TDR-based approaches, it is required to install sensors at each experiment\
    \ location.\nHowever, in order to make effective decisions in agriculture, real-time\
    \ soil moisture sensing is the\nprimary requirement.\nMany studies have been proposed\
    \ to investigate antenna related soil properties. An attempt\nto measure electrical\
    \ properties of earth using buried antenna has been proposed in [145,146].\nHowever,\
    \ this method requires measuring the input reactance for obtaining electrical\
    \ parameters\nof the material, and length of antenna is also required to be adjusted\
    \ to get zero input reactance.\nFresnel reﬂection coefﬁcients is used to estimate\
    \ GPR-based soil permittivity with soil antenna [147].\nHowever, they do not provide\
    \ empirical validation and also require a complex time-domain analysis.\nIn [148],\
    \ dielectric properties of soil are presented using wideband frequency domain\
    \ and frequency\nrange of 0.1–1 GHz. It uses impedance measurement equipment (LCR\
    \ meter) and VNA. In [149,150],\ncomplex dielectric properties of soil are measured\
    \ using frequency domain method which requires\nplacing soil in the probe.\nSoil\
    \ moisture and permittivity can also be measured by using GPR method. Ground permittivity\n\
    is estimated by correlating ground dielectric properties with cross talk of early-time\
    \ GPR\nsignal [151]. However, GPR method requires calibration and work only for\
    \ shallow depths (0–20 cm).\nFurthermore, soil moisture measuring technique cannot\
    \ be limited to a certain burial depth. Another\nimportant method of measuring\
    \ soil moisture is through remote sensing. Remote sensing has high\nrange of measurement\
    \ [152] and is sensitive to soil water content [153]. There are two major type\
    \ of\nremote sensing: active and passive. Passive remote sensing [154] has low\
    \ spatial resolutions which can\nbe improved by active remote sensing technologies,\
    \ however, active methods limits the soil moisture\nreadings to few centimeters\
    \ of the topsoil which highly effect the readings taken [155,156].\nWireless solutions\
    \ are classiﬁed on the basis of technology they are using to transmit information.\n\
    These solutions includes: Electromagnetic waves (EM), magnetic-induction (MI),\
    \ acoustic waves\nand VLC. Acoustic wave are used for detection purposes, e.g.,\
    \ detecting objects in underground\nenvironment [157] and detecting water content\
    \ in the soil. the disadvantage of using acoustic-based\nsystem is the low data\
    \ rate and high noise and attenuation [30,158]. Em waves has transmission range\n\
    of few meters to centimeters. However, its range is highly dependent upon the\
    \ frequency being used.\nIt is mostly used in agricultural applications [26].\
    \ EM waves suffer high signal degradation due to\ndifferent heterogeneous nature\
    \ of soil. MI-based systems needs transmitter and receiver coils to be\nperfectly\
    \ aligned which is one of the major hurdle of underground environment. MI-based\
    \ systems are\nstill in research phase and needs improvement. Finally, VLC solutions\
    \ are being investigated to be used\nfor underground communication ni gas reservoir.\
    \ However, VLC light propagation is highly effected\nby the gas and requires LED\
    \ and photo-detector to be perfectly aligned. In short, these technologies are\n\
    in research phase only and are only tested in labs yet. In coming sections, all\
    \ of these communication\nsystems are discussed in detail.\n4. Electromagnetic\
    \ Waves\nEM waves are used for communication in WUC-based agriculture [3,159],\
    \ oil and gas [160–162],\nand seismic exploration [163]. This section focuses\
    \ on presenting work being done in channel modeling\nand networking for EM waves\
    \ in WUC systems.\nSmart Cities 2020, 3\n1529\n4.1. EM Channel Modeling\nEM channel\
    \ modeling started from early 70’s of 20th century. Authors of [164] studied\n\
    underground EM propagation for the frequency range of 1–10 MHz. They performed\
    \ experiments\nin different type of soil and concluded that low frequencies fo\
    \ EM spectrum simpliﬁes the analysis,\nhowever, have the disadvantage of limited\
    \ bandwidth and time of arrival pulses had low resolution.\nTherefore, high frequencies\
    \ were used. Although, Higher frequencies causes higher attenuation but\nsuffers\
    \ from low dispersion. In [165], EM wave propagation is studied in multiple layers\
    \ of soil using\nFourier transform. In [166], impact of earth electrical properties\
    \ of the earth, i.e., conductivity and\ndielectric constant, on EM propagation\
    \ is studied. They found that these electrical properties of earth\nplays an important\
    \ role in selecting antenna size, antenna efﬁciency, transmission loss, dispersion\
    \ and\nphase shift. In [167], William et al. measured EM propagation in borehole\
    \ for high frequencies without\nconsidering the effect of reﬂections dn refraction.\
    \ The path loss model of [48,167] is given as:\nPr\nPt\n= f (θ)GtAre−2αd\n4πr2\n\
    (1)\nwhere\nPt = Transmitted Power\nPr = Received Power\nf(θ) = Effective elevation\
    \ radiation pattern\nGt = Transmitting antenna gain\nAr = Area of the receiving\
    \ antenna\nα = Attenuation constant\nd = Separation distance between transmitting\
    \ and receiving antenna\nr = Distance between the antennas\nIn [168], data rate\
    \ of 1bps (without repeaters)—100 bps (with repeaters) was achieved for\nborehole\
    \ communication. Authors in [169], studies the impact of different component of\
    \ underground\nenvironment, e.g., soil characteristics, soil moisture, network\
    \ topology, antenna characteristics on EM\nwaves communication. They performed\
    \ experiments for eh frequency range of 1–3 MHz. Similarly,\nref. [76,169] shows\
    \ the increase in attenuation with increasing humidity and frequency, ref. [170]\n\
    conducts sub-soil experiments for 300–500 MHz frequencies, and ref. [171] investigates\
    \ the EM\nattenuation for drilling telemetry system.\nIn [101,172], authors used\
    \ the Friis equation to formulate the pass loss calculation formula in\nsoil as:\n\
    Pr(dB) = Pt(dB) + Gt(dB) + Gr(dB) − Ls(dB),\n(2)\nwhere Pt is a transmitted power,\
    \ Pr is a received power, Gt is gain of transmitted antenna, Gr is the\nreceiver\
    \ gain. Here, Ls is the path loss in the soil which is calculated as Ls = L f\
    \ + Lu. L f is the path\nloss in the free space and Lu is the path loss in soil\
    \ medium. Lu is calculated as Lu = Lα + Lβ where Lα\nis the path loss due to transmission\
    \ loss and Lβ is the difference in wavelength of EM wave in soil as\ncompared\
    \ to air. Ls is calculated as:\nLs = 6.4 + 20log(d) + 8.69αd + 20log(β);\n(3)\n\
    where d represents the Euclidean distance, α denotes the attenuation constant,\
    \ and β represents\nthe phase shift constant and both of the quantities rely on\
    \ dielectric properties of soil. Peplinski\nprinciple [47] gives dielectric constant\
    \ as a complex number:\nϵs = ϵr − jϵi\n(4)\nSmart Cities 2020, 3\n1530\nwhere\
    \ ϵr is the real part and ϵi is the imaginary part. The real part is calculated\

    \ water volume fraction, and , ϵf represents the effective\nconductivity and is\
    \ given as:\nϵf =\nϵ0 − ϵ∞\n1 + (2π f τ)2 + ϵ∞,\n(6)\nwhere ϵ0 is the static dielectric\
    \ constant with value of 80.1, ϵ∞ is the high frequency limit and its value\n\
    is 4.9, τ is the time taken by the water to relax, and f is the operating frequency\
    \ [173]. ϵi, imaginary\npart, is given as\n\x10\nm\n˜β\nvϵ¯α\nf\n\x11 1\n¯α .\
    \ In the imaginary part, ¯β = 1.33797 − 0.603S − 0.166C. The attenuation\nconstant\

    \ EM propagation loss depends upon number of\nfactors including composition of\
    \ the soil, soil moisture, soil bulk density and frequency of operation.\nMoreover,\
    \ it is possible to have multiple paths between transmitter and receiver [88].\
    \ This scenario is\ninvestigated by [101] which gives the path loss in presence\
    \ of multiple paths as follow:\nLt = Ls − Lv,\n(9)\nLv, in Equation (9), is the\
    \ path loss for the second path and is given as:\nL2\nv =1 +\n\x10\nγ exp(−α∆(r))2\x11\

    \ above equation, γ is amplitude, φ is the phase reﬂection coefﬁcient, λ is the\
    \ wavelength,\nand δ(r) = r − d is the path difference. The channel model in Equation\
    \ (10) is used by the [37] to\ncreate a testbed for UGWSNs and [174] compares\
    \ the theoretical and actual measured values in testbed.\nIn [32,175], authors\
    \ give the path loss formula in Terahertz band (0.1–120 THz) as follow:\nLtot\
    \ = Lsp + Lw + Lo\n(11)\nThe above equation uses three different types of loss\
    \ namely: loss due to water absorption\n(Lw = kw( f )d), spreading loss (Lsp),\
    \ and loss due to oil absorption (L0 = k0( f )d). Lsp is given as\n\x10 4π f d\n\
    c\n\x112\nwhere, f, d, and c are frequency, distance and speed of light, respectively.\
    \ This THz model\nachieves higher capacity, however, suffers in communication\
    \ range. Hence, lower frequencies are used\nby [174,176] for acheiveing long communication\
    \ range. They use frequency range of less than 500 kHz.\nThe received power in\
    \ [174,176] is given as:\nSmart Cities 2020, 3\n1531\nPr = κ exp−2αd\nd2\n,\n\
    (12)\nwhere κ =\nAr cos θ\n2η\n\x10 Iµ0ω\n4π\n\x112\n, θ, η, µ0, I, and ω denotes\
    \ phase angle, intrinsic wave impedance,\nair permeability, current and angular\
    \ frequency, respectively.\nFurthermore, [177–179] studies the effect of carrier\
    \ frequency, transmission distance, type of\nmodulation, and depth for Underground\
    \ Wireless Sensor Networks (UGWSNs). In [21,180],\nauthor proposed the code division\
    \ multiplexing scheme for improving the battery life and signal-to-noise\nratio.\
    \ Upto 124 Mbps of data rate is achieved for a transmission distance of 12m using\
    \ a multi-carrier\nmodulation [76,180]. A system named as Di-Sense was proposed\
    \ in [8,55,80] to calculate the permittivity\nof soil in real-time using the Software-defined\
    \ radios (SDR). In [181], authors estimate an empirical path\nloss for up-link\
    \ WUC (underground to above-ground) by incorporating the antenna properties as\
    \ follow:\nLag = −147.6 + 20 log dag + 20 log f\n(13)\nwhere dag denotes the path\
    \ length. A summary of EM-based WUC is presented in Table 2.\nTable 2. Summary\

    4.2. EM Networking\nThere exists a lot of work on channel model of WUC systems.\
    \ However, the literature on routing\nprotocols in WUC is very rare. This section\
    \ presents the few of the work done for networking protocol\nof EM-based WUC.\
    \ An example of multi-hop EM-based WUC for oil & gas and agriculture is shown\
    \ in\nFigure 8a,b, respectively. Multi-hop is the most feasible option for communication\
    \ in WUC because of\nits harsh environment and limited range. A highly populated\
    \ sensor network for oil and gas application\nis presented in [80,163] which uses\
    \ multi-hop communication. A TCP/IP simulator is developed\nby [72,187] for WUC\
    \ system. Different multiple access schemes are evaluated in [188] It is shown\n\
    in [188] that low soil moisture and operating frequency increases the probability\
    \ of path-connectivity\nin WUC. A study increases the throughput of EM-based WUC\
    \ in an effort to improve quality of service\n(QoS) [188,189]. Effect of different\
    \ soil properties is also studied under the effect of increasing number\nof hops\
    \ between source and sink nodes. In [33,190], authors investigated a relay-based\
    \ approach with\nload balancing for increasing the lifetime of WUC systems.\n\
    (a)\n(b)\nFigure 8. EM-based Network Communication Technologies in: (a) Oil and\
    \ Gas reservoirs, (b) Agriculture [182].\nSmart Cities 2020, 3\n1533\n5. Mud Pulse\
    \ Telemetry\nMud pulse telemetry (MPT) is one of the oldest method for down-hole\
    \ communication which\nwas used for getting information on azimuth and inclination\
    \ for wells navigation. It communicates\ndata using the circulation of the mud\
    \ [29,191]. The mud is transferred from the above ground to\nunderground through\
    \ pressure pulses via drill string during drilling [192,193]. A valve is used\
    \ to\ngenerate the pressure waves. The mud goes through this valve and pressure\
    \ waves are controlled\nto modulate the amplitude, phase and frequency of the\
    \ mud pulse signal [194]. Three types of mud\npulse signals (positive, negative\
    \ and continuous) are transmitted and controlled at surface to recognize\nthe\
    \ pressure pulses [192] (see Figure 9). Various signal processing modules are\
    \ used at surface for\nthis purpose. These pressure signals are encoded to carry\
    \ the information which is important for\nthe application. It can carry temperature,\
    \ conductivity and pressure etc. information of the well.\nAlthough MPT technology\
    \ is quite mature, however, some of the impairments impairments in MPT\nsystems\
    \ are discussed brieﬂy [71,89].\nFigure 9. Types of Mud Pulse Telemetry (MPT)\
    \ systems. (a) Positive pulses through ﬂuid, (b) Negative\npulses through drill\
    \ string (c) Continuous pulses through rotor [182].\n•\nMud Pump Noise. The down-link\
    \ and uplink mud pulse signals are generated simultaneously by\nthe opposite movement\
    \ of piston in the valves. This causes an interference between both type of\n\
    communication [32,195]. The pressure signal also has amplitude and frequency in\
    \ the range of\n1–20 Hz which can be noticed easily. Two well-spaced and different\
    \ transducers are used at the\nsurface to minimize this effect [196]. Furthermore,\
    \ mean square ﬁltering algorithm is also used to\nﬁlter out the noise due to mud\
    \ pumps [81,197,198].\n•\nAttenuation and Dispersion. Unbalance drilling mud causes\
    \ the propagating mud pulse signal,\nin the borehole, to disperse and attenuate\
    \ [199]. Another major source of attenuation includes:\nmud type, frequency of\
    \ the signal, depth of borehole, diameter and joints in the drill string.\nLow\
    \ frequencies can be use to minimize the attenuation effect of the signals.\n\
    •\nRock Fragments and Gas Leakage. During drilling process, rock particles and\
    \ gas in the mud can\nchange the density and compressibility of the mud. This\
    \ change in mud properties causes a\nSmart Cities 2020, 3\n1534\nsigniﬁcant decrease\
    \ in the speed of the signal. The gas leakage into the mud leads to unstable\n\
    drilling which in-turn can cause environmental pollution [85,86,200].\nTable 3\

    \ environment includes: exploring oil and gas\nresources by geologist, communicating\
    \ with underground equipment during drilling, earthquake\nmonitoring, seismic\
    \ exploration and pipeline monitoring. The basic mechanism is measure the\nreﬂection\
    \ from propagation of transmitted acoustic wave. The acoustic based methods can\
    \ be classiﬁed\ninto two basic types: active and passive. Passive methods uses\
    \ the sensors to detect the infrasonic\nsignals due to some natural event such\
    \ as volcanic explosion, earthquake, rock crack formation,\npipeline leakage and\
    \ structural transformation. Active methods generate signals artiﬁcially by some\n\
    man-made explosions or vibration into the underground. The purpose is mainly to\
    \ determine the\nproperties of earth sub-surface environment, e.g., reﬂection-based\
    \ seismology (see Figure 10).\nAcoustic waves have low propagation speed which\
    \ makes them suitable for detection-based\napplications. Authors in [93,157] studies\
    \ speed of sound in soil by transmitting sound in multiple\nsoil samples and received\
    \ sound waves through hydrophones. The provided an empirical solution for\nthe\
    \ detection of the objects buried at 40 cm. Ref. [204,205] measures water content\
    \ in the soil using\nacoustic waves. A universal soil loss equation is derived\
    \ in [206] using 16 kHz frequency. The soil loss\nfactor is givens Les = ρesτcmϱ\
    \ where ρ is the loss due to rain, ϵs adds soil erosion, τ adds topography of\n\
    soil, ϱ gives support factor practices factor, and cm gives cover management.\
    \ Ref. [25,207,208] presents\nSoilComm, a soil communication system, which can\
    \ transmit data through the soil over the range of 30 m.\nSmart Cities 2020, 3\n\
    1535\nFigure 10. Acoustic-based WUC in seismic monitoring [182].\nIn acoustic-based\
    \ telemetry, a piezo-electric transmitter is used as an underground transmitter\n\
    along with the tranciever at the surface of the ground. The walls (steel) of the\
    \ drill-string are used\nas communication channel. Underground transmitter convert\
    \ the data received from the sensor into\nacoustic signal. This signal is then\
    \ propagated to the surface through drill string. The capacity of\nacoustic is\
    \ calculated by following expression in [158]:\nCa =\nZ\nlog2\n\x12\n1 +\nPs(\
    \ f )\nPNd( f ) + |H( f )|−2PNs( f )\n\x13\n(14)\nwhere the terms PNd( f ) is\
    \ the drilling noise, H(F) is the transfer function of the channel, PNs( f ) is\
    \ the\nsurface noise, and Ps is the power spectrum of the signal. The data rate\
    \ is the major issue. The signals\nare highly attenuated because of drilling noise,\
    \ hence, several repeaters (500–2000 m apart) are used\nto strengthen the signals.\
    \ To that end, many work has investigated the achievable data rate of the\nacoustic-based\
    \ systems. Fro example, data rate of 20 bps is achieved in [158] at depth of 3695\
    \ feet,\ndata rates of 20, 40, and 60 bps are achieved in [25,209] at depth of\
    \ 1000 m. Similarly, data rates\nof 20, and 6 bps are achieved in [27,210] at\
    \ depth of 4.5 m and 55 m, respectively, for down-hole\ncommunications. The authors\
    \ in [210] uses magnetostrictive actuators for generation of acoustic waves.\n\
    the waves are then transmitted to underground through drill string and received\
    \ back at ground\nthrough geophones.\nCorrect arrangement of drill pipe is also\
    \ important in acoustic communications. For example,\nascend-to-descend arrangement\
    \ of drill pipes is best for the telemetry performance in down-hole\ncommunication\
    \ [211]. In [26,43,212], authors investigate the acoustic signal loss and noise\
    \ because\nof pipe joints. The effect of multiphase ﬂow is studied in [213]. They\
    \ proposed to use trellis coded\nmodulation scheme considering a depth of 1000\
    \ m to achieve a data rate of up to 400 bps.\nApart from the channel modeling\
    \ of acoustic communications, there has been lot of work being\ndone in designing\
    \ tranciever for acoustic communication. Fro example, a receiver is proposed in\
    \ [214]\nfor communicating with drill string, [215] compares the single and multi-channel\
    \ communication in\noil wells, [216] studies the feasibility of communication\
    \ through drill string using acoustic waves in\ndifferent application. Apart from\
    \ the work on the above stated aspect of acoustic communication,\nthe work is\
    \ also being done in acoustic communication for rock failure [217], pipeline cracks\
    \ [218],\nand landmines detection [219]. A summary of Acoustic-based WUC is presented\
    \ in Table 4.\nSmart Cities 2020, 3\n1536\nTable 4. Comparison of acoustic waves-based\

    \ challenging WUC environment [83,170], hence, Magnetic\nInduction based WUC system\
    \ are being realized to overcome the disadvantage of EM-based\nWUC [78,225]. This\
    \ section discusses the three basic aspects of MI-based WUC: Channel Modeling,\n\
    Networking and Localization.\n7.1. MI Channel Modeling\nMI radios are equipped\
    \ with induction coil which generates magnetic ﬁeld that can be sensed by\nthe\
    \ nearby coils. The size of the coil should not be large but moderate to cover\
    \ long range in WUC,\ni.e., 10–100 m. These coils operates at resonance frequency.\
    \ Transmitter coil generates a time-varying\nmagnetic ﬁeld which causes current\
    \ to ﬂow through receiver. The current through receiving coil in the\nnearby coil.\
    \ Figure 11a show the coil structure of basic MI tranciever. It is important for\
    \ a successful\ncommunication that both coil should be coupled properly, otherwise,\
    \ there will be no communication.\nHence, a three directional coil structure,\
    \ as shown in Figure 11b, is proposed in [100]. The link-budget\nof MI-communication\
    \ is given in [44,100] as:\nSmart Cities 2020, 3\n1537\nat\nar\nr\n \n(a)\na\n\

    \ Nrjr3\ntir3\nrj sin2 αij\n16R0d6\nij\n,\n(15)\nwhere µ is soil permeability,\
    \ Pti is the transmitted power, Nrj gives the turns in receiver coil, αij is\n\
    the angel between oil axes, resistance of the unit length loop is given by R0,\
    \ rti and rrj are the radii\nof transmitting and receiver coils, and dij is the\
    \ distance between the transmitting and receiving\ncoil.\nEquation (15) , for\
    \ link-budget, is experimentally validated by [100].\nUsing this channel\nmodel,\
    \ authors in [226] proposed many modulation schemes (QAM, QPSK, BPSK) for MI-based\n\
    communications, and [227] gave square wave with pulse width modulation. In [227],\
    \ magnetic ﬁeld\nfor transmitting coil (Equation (16)) and EM ﬁeld for receiving\
    \ coil (Equation (17)) is given as:\nB =\nµ0Ir2nNt\n2 (d2 + r2)\n3\n2\n(16)\n\
    E = NrAωB cos ωt\n(17)\nwhere t is instantaneous time, A is the coil’s area, µ0\
    \ is the free space permeability, radius of the\ncoil is given by r, current is\
    \ I, and Nt and Nr represents the turns in receiving and transmitting coil,\n\
    respectively. Similarly, voltage due to generated EM ﬁeld is given as:\nV =\n\
    ERl2\nRl2 + jωL + Zr\n(18)\nwhere L and Rl2 represents the inductance and resistance\
    \ of the receiving coil. Zr is load resistance\nwhich is given as:\nZr =\nRl\n\
    1 + jωC2Rl\n(19)\nSmart Cities 2020, 3\n1538\nSolving Equation (18) after replacing\
    \ E from Equation (17):\nV =\nNrAωBRl2\nRl2 + jωL + Zr\n(20)\nThe above formulation\
    \ is used by [228] to give the received power as:\nPr = V2\n0 k2F2\n1 F2\n2Rl1F1t\n\
    (21)\nwhere voltage source is V0, F1 =\nωL1\nRl1+Rs , k =\nM\n√L1L2 , F2 = ωL2\n\
    Rl2 , and M =\nµ0πNtNrr4\n2(\n√\nd2+r2)3 . F1 is the quality\nfactor for transmitting\
    \ antenna and F2 is for receiving antenna, F1t gives the instantaneous quality\
    \ factor,\nM is the mutual inductance and source resistance is given as Rs. In\
    \ [228], authors also proposed a low\npower and low frequency MI communication\
    \ by estimating antenna size and coil turns. Moreover,\nthey modiﬁed the channel\
    \ by adding the soil conductivity σ to M:\nMσ = µ0πNtNrr4\n2πd3\nexp−αd,\n(22)\n\
    where α =\n1\n√\nπ f µ0σ is the attenuation constant.\nAuthors in [229] showed\
    \ better capacity and\ncommunication range by using meta-material coil. The performance\
    \ of MI-bases communication\nsystem for sandy and stone type soil media was tested\
    \ in [230,231] which concluded the receiver\nsensitivity should be at −70 dBm.\

    \ communication range. This problem of low\ncommunication range is solved by [236]\
    \ using relay coils with optimum deployment strategies and\noptimum number of\
    \ relay coils. Minimum-spanning tree (MST) algorithm is used for calculating\n\
    optimal number of relay coils. However, MST is slow in failure scenarios scenarios\
    \ such as coil\ndisplacement and node failures. Therefore, Voronoi-Fermat (VF)\
    \ algorithm replace MST to provide\nrobustness without increasing the deployment\
    \ cost. [27,70,237] reduced the path loss by using the\nrelaying technique for\
    \ MI-based communications. Authors in [31,62,238] recommended using meta\nmaterials\
    \ and superconductors in MI coil design for improved transmission range.\nThe\
    \ bottleneck link’s throughput of an MI system is also investigated to improve\
    \ the network\ncapacity [239]. It gives the channel capacity of link i as:\nCi\
    \ =\nZ +∞\n−∞ log2\n\x12\n1 +\nPti\nLi · E{Pn}\n\x13\nd f\n(23)\nwhere Pti, Li,\
    \ and, E{Pn} is transmitted power, path loss, and noise power density, respectively.\
    \ In [239],\nauthors used the Equation (23) to calculate the throughput as:\n\
    Ti =\nCi\nNdi\n\01 + Ninti\n\x01\n(24)\nwhere Ndi and Nint are the total number\
    \ of data streams and total number of interfering nodes,\nrespectively. In addition\
    \ to throughput [239] also studies the optimal system parameters and network\n\
    topology. To summarize,it is concluded in [239] that throughput of a multihop\
    \ MI communication\nsystem can be increased by relaying and optimal orientation\
    \ of coils.\nFor Quality of Service (QoS), [97] proposes distributed environment\
    \ aware cross-layer protocol\n(DEAP). DEAP, for a MI link i → j, aims to achieve\
    \ high throughput while consuming minimal energy.\nThe energy consumption is given\
    \ as:\nEij = U\n \nPij\nRijRcij\n+ 2Eb\n!\n,\n(25)\nwhere\nPij\nRijRcij gives\
    \ the energy required to transmit 1 bit, and Eb electrical energy required to\
    \ send\n1 bit. Rij and Rcij gives the transmission rate and channel coding rate,\
    \ respectively, and U is the total\nlength of the packet. Another two stage cross\
    \ layer approach, namely XLayer, is given in [240] to\nachieve high throughput\
    \ for MI based communications.\nAnalysis in [241] shows that probability of a\
    \ connected network is directly proportional (increases)\nto the number of UTs\
    \ and low soil moisture. The showed that for a particular node density and low\n\
    soil moisture (1%), connectivity of EM and MI WUC remains same However, if the\
    \ soil moisture is\nincreased to 5% EM is disconnected and MI still does the communication.\

    \ task for provision of location-based services in\nwireless networks. Therefore,\
    \ there has been lot of work on in the field of localization, e.g., terrestrial\
    \ and\nmarine networks localization techniques are reviewed in [244,245], respectively.\
    \ Localization techniques\nare basically classiﬁed into three main categories:\
    \ range-based, computation types, i.e., centralized\nor distributed, and space-based,\
    \ i.e., 2D/3D. However, localization techniques are not explored\nextensively\
    \ in underground environment because of harsh environment, congested operational\
    \ area,\nand lack of availability of global positioning system (GPS) signals.\
    \ There has been efforts in providing\nlocalization for harsh environments other\
    \ than underground, e.g., indoor and underwater, but these\ntechniques are not\
    \ feasible for underground applications [51].\nIn [246], Andrea et al presents\
    \ a MI-based 2D localization technique for tracking underground\nanimals which\
    \ was extended further to 3D dimension in [247]. Due to high attenuation effect\
    \ of soil on\nMI-propagation, the effect of mineral and rock on MI-based localization\
    \ technique is studied in [248].\nAnother study [248] investigated that accuracy\
    \ of localization is dependent upon the properties fo\nunderground materials.\
    \ In [249], a programming-based relaxation technique is presented for the\nlocalization\
    \ of underground sensors.\nIn [250], a method to estimate a distance in MI-based\
    \ WUC is presented. The accuracy of\nlocalization technique is given by using\
    \ an estimation bound, e.g., Cramer Rao lower bound (CRLB).\nCRLB has been used\
    \ for many wireless networks, e.g., IoT [251], source localization, cognitive\
    \ radio\nnetworks [252–254], radar tracking [255], and vehicular ad-hoc networks\
    \ [256]. Authors in [257] derives\nCRLB for MI-based WUC localization for Oil\
    \ & Gas scenario, and considering network and channel\nparameters. A summary of\
    \ EM-based WUC is presented in Table 7.\nSmart Cities 2020, 3\n1541\nTable 7.\

    \ Coils\nIt is important that WUC systems last longer for extended operations,\
    \ hence, lifetime of such\nsystem is an important parameter to consider. There\
    \ has been much effort made in literature to\nimprove the life of such systems\
    \ [8,22,263]. To that end, a charging method has been investigated\nin [74,263]\
    \ which uses the combination of a magnetic relay and optimized routing protocol\
    \ to improve\nthe energy consumption of the system. However, an issue with the\
    \ method proposed in [263] is that of\nlow charging efﬁciency even if the coil\
    \ of moderate size is used. This problem is solved in [264] by\nproposing an energy\
    \ model framework. However, this problem of underground charging is still an\n\
    open area of research and energy harvesting can be used to solve this problem.\n\
    8. Wired Communications\nWireless systems reduces the complexity of the system,\
    \ however, they are not able to achieve\nthe reliability and timely accuracy.\
    \ Therefore, wired systems employing coaxial cables and optical\nﬁbers are used\
    \ for down-hole monitoring [94,95,265–267]. Intelliserv gave a high-speed telemetry\n\
    system using coaxial cable instead of EM-based system. This system signiﬁcantly\
    \ improved the\nunderground communication by accomplishing real-time bi-directional\
    \ communication at 57,000 bps.\nFor a coaxial solutions [52,84,95], a strong cable\
    \ is used along with the repeaters and inductive coils.\nIn [265] authors uses\
    \ ﬁber optic cable to sense the temperature in oil & gas reservoir. In [266],\
    \ authors\nuses SNR characterization of channel to achieve down hole communication.\
    \ Optical ﬁbers have\nreplaced coaxial cable because of high data rate, therefore,\
    \ this section majorly discusses the optical\nﬁber-based solutions.\nOptical ﬁbers\
    \ have been used commercially and industrially for last two decades because of\
    \ their\nability of withstanding harsh environment such as oil and gas reservoirs\
    \ [268]. Authors in [268]\ndiscusses the use of ﬁber optics in installation and\
    \ deployment of sensors’ assembly, and data\nmeasurement. They also discusses\
    \ the temperature and pressure sensing system in the land well.\nFinally, they\
    \ concluded that Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors are suitable for such applications\n\
    because of their added advantage of high ﬂexibility and scalability, and multi-point\
    \ sensing. Another\nsystem consisting of FBG sensors connected with the optical\
    \ ﬁber using ultraviolet photo inscription\nmethod [269] is shown in Figure 12.\n\
    Smart Cities 2020, 3\n1542\nFigure 12. Fiber optic monitoring system for WUC [182].\n\
    An FBG-based monitoring system is proposed in [270]. This system monitors temperature\
    \ and\nﬂuid in oil-bore holes. The system performs the conversion of the ﬂuid\
    \ pressure using mechanical\ntransducer with ﬁber optic strain,. They calculated\
    \ the strain of the transducer as:\ns = sl − λ(sr + st)\nE\n,\n(26)\nwhere sl\
    \ represents the longitudinal stress, sr represents the radial stress, st represents\
    \ teh tangential\nstress, λ is Poisson number and E gives the Young’s modulus.\
    \ Equation (26) can be re-written,\nafter considering radii, ai (inner) and a0\
    \ (outer) of the tube.\ns = pa2\ni (1 − 2λ)\nE(a2\n0 − a2\ni ) ,\n(27)\nwhere\
    \ p denotes the pressure. In [271], information from two ﬁbers is combined onto\
    \ one by using\nwavelength division multiplexing. They uses it for the temperate\
    \ and pressure sensing in well-bore.\nThis is a cost effective solution as it\
    \ senses both temperature and pressure simultaneously. The results\nin [271] proves\
    \ that the techniques is stable and accurate. An down-hole monitoring system was\n\
    deployed in shoreline of Marmara sea, Turkey, using optical ﬁber. to summarize,\
    \ optical ﬁber\nbased underground systems are not effected by EM interference\
    \ and provide high data rate for\nthe communication [272]. A summary of wired\
    \ system is presented in Table 8.\nSmart Cities 2020, 3\n1543\nTable 8. Existing\

    9. Research Challenges & Future Directions\nThe development in WUC has extended\
    \ the research possibilities in the area which give rise to\nsome research challenges\
    \ as well. Therefore, this section presents the research challenges that are\n\
    being faced in this area. Moreover, Table 9 shows the importance of these research\

    \ in WUC application because of the harsh environment [51]. The smart\nobjects\
    \ in WUC can easily be damaged by the above-ground activities, i.e., digging,\
    \ plowing, harvesting.\nTherefore, it is very difﬁcult to manage and deploy in\
    \ WUC as compared to the terrestrial networks.\nThe objects with high energy requirement\
    \ should be deployed near to the surface so that frequent\nbattery replacement\
    \ can be done easily. High capacity batteries and power saving protocols can also\
    \ be\nused to meet the requirement of high energy nodes.The deployment challenge\
    \ become relatively severe\nin WUC applications seismic and Oil & gas exploration\
    \ because fo higher depth. Therefore, in [236],\na MI-based WUC is used with managed\
    \ and organized orientation of coils to minimize the power\nreﬂection. Authors\
    \ have used different deployment strategies (horizontal and vertical) in [242]\
    \ to\nreduce the complexity. One important issue to consider is the path loss\
    \ occurring due to heterogeneous\nnature of soil. Unfortunately, there is very\
    \ limited work on efﬁcient WUC deployment which aims to\nsolve this challenge\
    \ while considering various operational parameters [29,63,77].\n9.2. Channel Modeling\n\
    The EM signal attenuation is much greater in soil as compared to the terrestrial\
    \ networks [88,170].\nThe major factors contributing to this loss is the soil\
    \ permittivity and conductivity which was the\nreason why MI-based WUC were introduced.\
    \ Each layer of the heterogeneous soil effects the magnetic\nﬁeld differently.\
    \ Given this behavior, technique of assigning a scaling factor to different depths\
    \ is\nused in [164]. In [85,275], the authors studies the propagation though the\
    \ soil by calculating the skin\ndepth of each layer. In [98], authors have characterized\
    \ the path loss for MI-based communication.\nIn [229], authors investigates the\
    \ asymmetric transceiver to cope with the case of coils misalignment in\nMI-based\
    \ WUC. Path loss has been extensively studied for each type of the wireless channel,\
    \ however,\nfew efforts have been made for WUC systems. Therefore, this area of\
    \ WUC needs special consideration.\n9.3. Transmission Range\nMI-based WUC with\
    \ all its advantages (not effected by boundary effects & multipath\nfading [100])\
    \ has a disadvantage of limited transmission range. This is because of high path\n\
    loss in the soil. In [236,238,276], authors proposed usage of relay coils to extend\
    \ the transmission\nrange. Similarly, [238,277] proposed usage of super conductors\
    \ and meta-materials for this purpose.\nLarge coils were used in [249,278] with\
    \ an aim of acheiveing high transmission range, however, it might\nnot be a practical\
    \ solution. Therefore, achieving the long communication range for buried nodes\
    \ is an\nimportant research issue.\n9.4. Latency and Reliable Communication\n\
    Latency and reliable communication is the primary requirement of the critical\
    \ applications\nsuch as Oil & Gas exploration. Late or incorrect sensors reading\
    \ can be the cause of a major\ndisaster. WUC environment is the major hindrance\
    \ in acheiveing the reliable communication.\nAlthough, the reduced latency and\
    \ reliability is one of the major requirement of the conventional IoT as\nwell\
    \ [6,8]. However, in WUC, this issue needs more consideration due to tough operating\
    \ parameters\nand regulations of sub-surface environment. It is not possible to\
    \ meet the WUC communication\nrequirement with any single system. For example,\
    \ wired communication provides reliability and low\nlatency whereas wireless solutions\
    \ are scalable with low complex. Therefore, it is important to develop\nan WUC\
    \ system with low latency, lower transmission delays and minimized sensor failures.\n\
    9.5. Security\nSecurity is the least studied aspect of WUC systems. WUC security\
    \ includes: security of equipment,\nand security of communication protocols. Node\
    \ replication, jamming the signal, and worm hole are\nfew potential security attacks\
    \ that can occur in WUC systems. A security breaches can be used to raise\nSmart\
    \ Cities 2020, 3\n1545\nfalse alarms. Responding to the frequent false alarms\
    \ can exhaust the network resources. In [279,280],\nauthors discusses the security\
    \ issues (e.g., forward and backward security) and malicious attacks\n(e.g., node\
    \ compromise attack) on cloud-based IoT. Authors in [281] uses the data tagging\
    \ technique\nfor improved data security. They uses information ﬂow control (IFC)\
    \ for this purpose. A secure\nIoT architecture using host identity protocol (HIP)\
    \ and datagram transport layer security (DTLS) is\npresented in [282]. Few studies\
    \ [283,284] provides an extensive security survey in IoT. These studies\nare targeted\
    \ towards improving security in terrestrial networks, however, these can be modiﬁed\
    \ to\nWUC environment by introducing underground operational constraints. For\
    \ example, old Oil & Gas\nsystems are being transformed to digital WUC systems.\
    \ Therefore, it is required to update security\nof such globally connected systems\
    \ which, otherwise, in an event of cyber attack, can lead to some\ndisastrous\
    \ situation. Blockchain technology can be also be used in WUC systems to deal\
    \ with the cyber\ncrimes [25,48,285].\n9.6. Scalability\nScalability issues can\
    \ rise due to the factors such as: higher network density, high energy-consumption\n\
    of underground things, node failures, routing overhead, low memory of underground\
    \ nodes,\nand vendor-specific nodes can cause interoperability issues. Ref. [286]\
    \ uses spatio-temporal stochastic\nmodeling for dealing with scalability in WUC.\
    \ For tunnels, ref. [72,287] proposed an adaptive structure-aware\nWUC system.\
    \ Interoperability issue is discussed in [287] using middleware protocol. Heterogeneity\
    \ of\nsensor nodes is studied in [288]. The mentioned work deals with the scalability\
    \ of terrestrial IoT, however,\nthese can be modified as per requirements of WUC\
    \ systems. For example, high path loss in soil limits the\ndeployment of large\
    \ wireless network. This problem is studied by [80,289] which uses the sink nodes\
    \ to\nconnect with the sparsely buried sensor nodes. It uses the energy harvesting\
    \ to increase the lifetime of the\nnodes. Besides these solutions, it is important\
    \ to efficiently develop a self-healing and self-organizing WUC\nsystems which\
    \ can overcome the scalability issues.\n9.7. Robustness\nAn underground channel\
    \ is very unpredictable facing the issues like: energy constraints, dynamic\n\
    topology, sparsity of nodes. Hence, achieving robustness is very critical in WUC\
    \ systems. A small world\nmodel is proposed in [290] for the improvement of latency\
    \ and robustness by considering the local\nimportance of smart objects. Extensive\
    \ literature exist for the improvement of robustness in terrestrial\nnetwork [81,86,291],\
    \ however, work in robustness in WUC is limited to the mining application.\nFor\
    \ example, Ref [292] improve the robustness of an underground mining by using\
    \ a wireless mesh\nnetwork. One of the major challenge in the WUC systems is to\
    \ develop robust communication and\ndata gathering techniques. Communication range\
    \ of EM waves in soil is highly limited because of\nattenuation. However, magnetic\
    \ induction is considered relative robust for communicating in the soil\nbut requires\
    \ perfect orientation of the coils. The research of MI-based WUC for robustness\
    \ is still not\nmature and needs to be studied further.\n9.8. Hybrid Sensing\n\
    Hybrid sensing systems includes the usage of multiple sensor systems and integration\
    \ of their\nsignals, e.g., long-term underground ﬁber sensors can be combined\
    \ with short-term ground penetrating\nradars fro the purpose of detection and\
    \ localization. SoilNet Systems [79,293] is an hybrid sensor\nsystem which combines\
    \ Zigbee network with wired communication. Zigbee network is used for\nabove-ground\
    \ nodes and wired communication is used fro the underground nodes. A combination\n\
    of EM- and MI-based can be used for providing long-range downlink (EM-based) and\
    \ short-range\nuplink (MI-based) communication [249]. Therefore, hybrid sensing\
    \ systems can improve the efﬁciency\nof WUC systems.\nSmart Cities 2020, 3\n1546\n\
    9.9. Software Deﬁned Networking (SDN)\nSoftware Deﬁned Networking (SDN) provides\
    \ robustness, scalability, reliability and secure\nnetworking solution for WUC\
    \ systems. It is different form conventional networking solution in that it\n\
    separates the control logic from the networking hardware. These advantages make\
    \ its suitable for the\nusage in underwater environment. A surface station can\
    \ be any SDN controller which communicates\nwith the underwater sensors through\
    \ in/out-band control channels [294]. The SDN-controller\nwill separate the data\
    \ plane and controller plane. Such technique can also be used for WUC\nsystems\
    \ [295,296]. SDN-based WUC will have lower network complexity, improved congestion\n\
    control mechanism, increased network life, efﬁcient utilization of network resources,\
    \ and reduced\nlatency. For example, SDN-based WUC for Oil & Gas can allow users\
    \ to efﬁciently manage the\nsystem by providing the global view of buried sensors\
    \ nodes. SDN-based WUC can also be used in\nagricultural applications for achieving\
    \ a scalable network solutions. Furthermore, data visualization\ncan be used with\
    \ SDN-controller for correlation of sensor data. These advantages of SDN paradigm\n\
    forces researcher to look into the possibilities of SDN-based WUC systems [76].\n\
    9.10. Big Data\nMassive amount of data is generated by WUC applications (agriculture,\
    \ seismic surveying,\nand oil/gas ﬁelds). This data should properly organized,\
    \ correlated and analyzed for making accurate\ndecisions [297]. Integration of\
    \ big data and traditional IoT is already being studied extensively,\ne.g., [89,298]\
    \ presents the application of big data in IoT. In [299], authors studies the application\n\
    fo context-aware computing in IoT. These works motivate and presents an opportunity\
    \ fo integrating\nbig data analytic with WUC system. For example, Oil & Gas WUC\
    \ generates glut of data and managing\nthat data is the major concern of respective\
    \ industries [81,83]. Similarly, geo-scientists spends major\nportion of their\
    \ time (nearly 50%) on managing data. Big data provides an opportunity to handle\
    \ such\nbig amount of data and perform analysis. Therefore, proper data analytic\
    \ tools must be developed for\nthe WUC systems.\n9.11. Fog and Cloud Computing\n\
    Cloud/fog computing provides different feature (scalability, mobility, low delays,\
    \ and location\nawareness) of an efﬁcient WUC systems. Cloud computing has been\
    \ used for the management\npurposes in Oil & Gas industries whereas fog computing\
    \ has been used for reducing data trafﬁc\nand analysis of data at edge [74,300].\
    \ In Oil & Gas industries, huge data generated by the upstream\noperations (e.g.,\
    \ drilling and seismic exploration) is a major challenge. Fog computing can be\
    \ used\nfor provision of localized analytic of data being generated in real-time.\
    \ It helps in minimizing\ncommunication delays and faster event response. Moreover,\
    \ time-critical applications require efﬁcient\ndecision making procedure because\
    \ it is possible that decision making opportunity is gone by the time\ndata reaches\
    \ the cloud. Hence, fog computing should be integrated with WUC systems [71].\n\
    9.12. Efﬁcient Localization Methods\nLocalization can result any many applications\
    \ such as WUC monitoring, geo-tagged sensing,\nand optimized fracturing. there\
    \ are limited studies which tries to ﬁnd location of buried nodes\nof MI-based\
    \ WUC. In [258], authors developed a testbed for tracking objects in MI-based\
    \ WUC.\nIn [77,261], authors studies how mineral and rocks in underground environment\
    \ effect the accuracy\nof localization. The accuracy is also investigated in [85,86,257]\
    \ for MI-based WUC. It is important to\nnote that localization work exist only\
    \ for the MI-based and there is no work done in EM-, acoustic-,\nand VLC-based\
    \ WUC. Therefore, robust and accurate localization methods are required for these\n\
    WUC systems.\nSmart Cities 2020, 3\n1547\n10. Conclusions\nThe paper presents\
    \ a detailed review on signal propagation in wireless underground communication\n\
    network. Section 1 discusses the importance and motivation to improve the underground\
    \ communication\ntechniques differently than the traditionally available methods.\
    \ In subsequent sections, an overview\nof underground communication and types\
    \ of channel involved in the underground communication\nis presented. Various\
    \ frequencies are discussed for the different channels that are involved in UG\n\
    communication. A detailed discussion on UG component and their difference from\
    \ traditional over-the-air\n(OTA) communication is given along-with the references\
    \ from current literature. It is established\nthat underground communication module\
    \ differs from that of OTA because of involvement of soil.\nVarious signal propagation\
    \ methods and their feasibility in UG application is discussed in detail.\nThe\
    \ propagation method includes: EM, MI, MPT, Acoustic and, wired solutions. Finally,\
    \ the manuscript\nis concluded with the discussion on research challenges in UG\
    \ communication.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, U.R. and A.S.; methodology,\

  analysis: 'The paper is titled "RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF INTELLIGENT GREENHOUSE
    MONITORING AND CONTROL SYSTEM: A REVIEW," and it is primarily focused on the significance
    of smart farming technologies and their relationship with greenhouse monitoring
    and control systems. The study particularly examines the integration of IoT, artificial
    intelligence, and intelligent control in smart greenhouses.


    The paper highlights the importance of data collection, wireless network transmission,
    multi-sensor networks, and RFID technology in constructing smart agricultural
    greenhouses, enabling them to monitor crop growth environments, crop growth information,
    and crop disease and pest data.


    The paper concludes by emphasizing the need to address various challenges associated
    with large-scale promotion and implementation of smart greenhouses, including
    the development of low-cost yet efficient systems, optimization of disease and
    pest identification algorithms, establishment of a large cloud database, and incorporation
    of artificial intelligence-based decision-making systems.


    Despite its relevance to the overall review intention, the paper has certain limitations.
    Firstly, it does not offer a comprehensive analysis of the types of data most
    applicable to irrigation management and their sources. Secondly, the paper does
    not provide specific examples or case studies of successfully implemented smart
    greenhouse systems, which could enhance its practical relevance.


    In terms of structure, the paper follows a logical flow, starting with an introduction
    and progressing through the discussion of key technologies, smart management systems,
    conclusion, and future prospects. However, a more concise and focused approach
    could have further improved its clarity and readability.


    Overall, the paper''s relevance to the review intention is moderate, as it touches
    upon the importance of data, intelligent technologies, and smart management in
    greenhouse monitoring and control. However, a more comprehensive analysis of irrigation-specific
    data types and their sources, as well as practical examples, would enhance its
    relevance and value for the review.


    Here are the three most relevant verbatim quotes from the paper:


    1. "The Internet of Things technology is an important bridge to the development
    of smart agriculture [5]."


    2. "Smart management system connects the cloud platform through network, and uploads
    the data from main control point to the cloud. Users can complete the remote control
    of greenhouse equipment and remote monitoring of the crop environment through

    \ agriculture is the development direction of future agriculture and a high -level\
    \ form of \nmodern agriculture [1]. With the advancement and development of technology,\
    \ biotechnology, \ninformation technology, computer technology and new energy\
    \ technology have been widely infiltrated \ninto the agricultural field. High\
    \ -tech such as agricultural Internet of Things, agricultural big data and \n\
    agricultural robots gradually applied to various fields of agricultural production\
    \ [2]. Smart agriculture \ntakes data, knowledge and intelligent equipment as\
    \ its core element. By integrating modern science and \nCHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY. CONTROL\
    \ AND MANAGEMENT.                                                          №3\
    \ / 2023 \n \n6 \ntechnology with agriculture, smart agriculture realizes the\
    \ digital perception, intelligent decision-\nmaking, precise operation and intelligent\
    \ management of the entire process of agricultural production, \nshowing a strong\
    \ development momentum. Research and practice of various countries have shown\
    \ that \nimproving agricultural intelligence can greatly increase labor productivity,\
    \ resource utilization and land \nproduction rates [3].  \nGreenhouse is an important\
    \ application scenario of modern agriculture. With the improvement \nof people's\
    \ life quality, the demand for fruits and vegetables has also increased, and the\
    \ amount of \ngreenhouses has developed rapidly. Greenhouse adopts artificial\
    \ technical means to change natural light \nand temperature conditions, and to\
    \ create environmental factors to optimize the growth of animals and \nplants,\
    \ so that greenhouse crops can grow throughout the year and the weather. Compared\
    \ with \ntraditional planting methods, the greenhouse is more automated, intelligent,\
    \ and mechanized. Promoting \nmodern agricultural technology and equipment in\
    \ greenhouses is an important manifestation of precision \nagriculture, information\
    \ agriculture and intelligent agriculture [4]. Intelligent monitoring and control\
    \ of \ngreenhouse can effectively improve the production efficiency of greenhouses\
    \ and reduce labor \nconsumption which is a hot spot for research in recent years.\
    \ The key technologies involved in intelligent \nagriculture mainly include Internet\
    \ of Things technology , intelligent perception technology and smart \nmanagement\
    \ technology. \n \n2. Research status of key technologies of intelligent greenhouse\
    \ monitoring and control \nsystems \n2.1 Agricultural Internet of Things \nInternet\
    \ of Things technology is an important bridge to the development of smart agriculture\
    \ [5]. \nIn order to build an Internet of Things system, various information sensors,\
    \ infrared sensors, radio \nfrequency identification facilities and other equipment\
    \ in greenhouses need to be installed. The Internet \nof Things system connects\
    \ the agricultural environment with the network through a communication \nagreement,\
    \ and then analyzes and sorts out different information collected by sensors,\
    \ in the same time \npublishes the information gathered from the cloud server,\
    \ and eventually displays it in the software \nterminal to achieve real-time monitoring\
    \ of crop growth. Through the Internet of Things system, the \nextensive connection\
    \ between things to things, things to people, and people to people is realized\
    \ [6] [7]. \nAgricultural Internet of Things technology mainly involves wireless\
    \ network transmission technology, \nmulti -sensor network technology and RFID\
    \ technology [8]. \n2.1.1 Wireless network transmission technology \nThe current\
    \ mature wireless communication methods are mainly include LORA, ZigBee, WiFi,\
    \ \nNB-IoT, Bluetooth, etc. [9]. Yao Maoxuan et al. [10] designed a detection\
    \ system for the basic greenhouse \necological environment, and studied the wireless\
    \ data transmission system based on LORA. \nTPYBOARDV102 is used as the core board\
    \ to achieve automated detection and control of greenhouse. \nWu Xiaofeng et al.\
    \ [11] invented the smart greenhouse system based on LORA and the cloud platform\
    \ \nInternet of Things technology, and the data between farmers can be shared.\
    \ Luo Jialong et al. [12] designed \nan intelligent agricultural irrigation system\
    \ based on ZigBee Internet of Things technology. It uses ARM \nprocessors to complete\
    \ data processing and intelligent control, and  achieved the function of ZigBee\
    \ \nwireless data collection and intelligent irrigation. Liu Feifei et al. [13]\
    \ designed a ZigBee -based \nenvironmental monitoring system. A distributed sensor\
    \ network terminal through ZigBee technology is \nestablish for data collection.\
    \ The collected data is sent to the ONENet cloud platform through 4G \nmodules\
    \ for monitoring, and the real -time monitoring& display of environmental data\
    \ and recording of \nhistorical data are successfully realized. Zhao Jindao et\
    \ al. [14] designed WIFI -based farmland automatic \nirrigation systems. The LAN\
    \ control adopted AP and STA mode. It controls relay status and information \n\
    through serial ports to achieve the function of timing control and automatic collection\
    \ information of the \nirrigation system. The control of the LAN adopts the AP\
    \ and STA mode. The system controls the state \nof the relay and completes the\
    \ information upload through the serial port. The function of timing control \n\
    and automatic collection information of the irrigation system is implemented.\
    \ Jiang Shixuan et al. [15] \nCHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY \n \n7 \ndesigned a smart vertical\
    \ agricultural system combining ZigBee and NB-IoT technology. The system \nuses\
    \ STM32 as the core controller, and uses a coordinator to set up the network.\
    \ In order to collect the \nenvironmental index in the greenhouse, terminal nodes\
    \ are connected to the multi -way sensor. In order \nto achieve data communication\
    \ between the bottom device and the cloud platform, NB-IoT technology \nis adopted.\
    \ The system uploads the entire wireless sensing network data to the Internet\
    \ of Things open \nplatform through Internet of Things base stations and core\
    \ networks, realizing real -time monitoring and \nremote regulation of environmental\
    \ parameters. \n2.1.2 Multi -sensor network technology \nIn the construction of\
    \ smart agricultural greenhouses, the construction of the sensor network is \n\
    essential. Multi -sensor data fusion technology integrates technologies such as\
    \ signal processing, \nestimation theory, uncertain theory, optimization theory\
    \ and pattern recognition. In the field of smart \nagriculture, the purpose of\
    \ reducing data redundancy and improving transmission efficiency and \naccuracy\
    \ can be achieved through data fusion processing [16]. Valente et al. [17] used\
    \ specific data fusion \nalgorithms to make multiple data fusion of upload data\
    \ base on the ZigBee sensor network. Viani et al. \n[18] designed an embedded\
    \ decision -making support system. Through artificial intelligence fusion of \n\
    multiple sensors, the system can provide irrigation decisions based on weather\
    \ conditions and actual \nwater demand, and as a result, improve the output of\
    \ crops. Liu Qian et al. [19] used data mining \ntechnology and fuzzy reasoning\
    \ theory to conduct data fusion and analysis of data collected by \nenvironmental\
    \ detection sensors, and formulated corresponding control strategies with an accuracy\
    \ rate \nof more than 80 %. \n2.1.3 RFID technology \nRFID (Radio Frequency Identification)\
    \ is a technology that automatically obtains target -related \ninformation through\
    \ radio frequency signals and space electromagnetic coupling to achieve non-contact\
    \ \nautomatic recognition of targets. This technology can be used in complex environments,\
    \ which has \nattracted attention due to its huge application prospects. Huang\
    \ Xiaoyan et al. [20] designed a new type \nof RFID sensor for soil moisture and\
    \ salinity detection, simulated soil theory models with different \nhumidity and\
    \ salinity levels, and measured changes in water and salinity in sandy soil. Ma\
    \ Shijun et al. \n[21] used RFID technology to establish an agricultural seed\
    \ quality tracking system. According to the \nRFID tag, the seed quality tracking\
    \ system can get an overall description. The system realizes the real-\ntime monitoring\
    \ of seeds detail information including breeding, transportation, sales, planting\
    \ and other \nprocesses. Ning Wei et al. [22] invented a system that uses RFID\
    \ labels to track greenhouse crops, which \ncan locate the growth area of the\
    \ crop and accurately obtain crop growth status. \n2.2 Intelligent perception\
    \ \nInformation such as crop growth environment, crop growth situation and crop\
    \ disease and pests \ninformation of the smart greenhouse are the basis for intelligent\
    \ monitoring and control system \noperations [23]. Many kinds of agricultural\
    \ information can be obtained through satellite images, aircrafts \nor unmanned\
    \ aerial vehicles and ground detection instruments. \n2.2.1 Crop environment information\
    \ monitoring \nThe rapid perception of crop growth environment information is\
    \ the most basic and critical issue \nin the implementation of precision agriculture\
    \ [24]. The growth environment of crops includes \ninformation such as soil temperature,\
    \ soil humidity, and soil nutrients. Liu Fei et al. [25] used the IRI1011 \ninfrared\
    \ thermal image meter to measure the temperature of the soil, and predict the\
    \ water content of the \nsoil through soil temperature. The system realizes remote\
    \ sensing monitoring of soil water within a small \narea. Xiao et al. [26] developed\
    \ a wireless measurement system that can measure the depth of the water \nlayer\
    \ when there is water on the paddy field surface, and also the soil water content\
    \ when the paddy field \nsurface is waterless. The system can remotely control\
    \ automatic irrigation and drainage according to the \nmeasurement results.  \n\
    Effective nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in the soil are the most basic nutritional\
    \ elements \nof crop growth. At present, the real-time online quick measurement\
    \ of soil nitrogen, phosphorus, and \npotassium is still a world problem, and\
    \ substantial progress has not been achieved. Sun Jianying et al. \nCHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY.\
    \ CONTROL AND MANAGEMENT.                                                    \
    \      №3 / 2023 \n \n8 \n[27] selected black land as the research object, and\
    \ used spectral measurement technology to analyze the \nsoil parameters and spectral\
    \ characteristics of black soil and tide soil. And through laboratory analysis,\
    \ \nthe distributed diagram of P H and nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and organic\
    \ matter content can be \ngiven. Wang Zhenglang et al. [28] used GPRS wireless\
    \ communication technology, sensor detection \ntechnology, and A/D conversion\
    \ technologies to achieve remote detection of soil nitrogen, phosphorus, \nand\
    \ potassium of farmland. DONG et al. [29] Try to use laser induction technology\
    \ to determine nitrogen \nin the soil. \n2.2.2 Crop growth information detection\
    \ \nThe growth of crops mainly includes the growth status and yield of crops.\
    \ The growth status \nincludes information such as plant height, inverted area,\
    \ biological content and other information. Pan \nBeito et al. [30] designed a\
    \ visual-based wheat breeding growth information detection system. Based on \n\
    CATIA software, wheat growth information collection robot and supporting handheld\
    \ equipment are \ndesigned and developed. The counting of plants is achieved by\
    \ the processing of wheat seedling images. \nDu Minghua et al. [31] discussed\
    \ the use of near -infrared high spectral imaging technology to conduct \nnon\
    \ -destructive testing of tomato leaves chlorophyll content, and established a\
    \ leaf chlorophyll \nprediction model, which provides a basis for tomato quality\
    \ online testing. Tang Dong et al. [32] used \nimage edge detection technology\
    \ to design the crop inverted area evaluation system. Compared with the \ntraditional\
    \ inverted area evaluation method, the image detection rate is more than 78% and\
    \ the overall \narea evaluation error rate can be controlled within 10 %. Jiang\
    \ et al. [33-34] developed remote sensors. \nCompared with professional level\
    \ high-spectrum instruments and multi-spectrum cameras, it has similar \nreflectivity\
    \ and radiation illumination measurement accuracy. At the same time, the production\
    \ rate of \nthe growth topic picture and the decision-making efficiency of the\
    \ variable fertilizer square diagram has \nbeen greatly improved. \n2.2.3 Crop\
    \ disease and pest information testing \nEarly information testing of crop diseases\
    \ and pests can effectively reduce the possibility and \nseverity of the occurrence\
    \ of pests, eliminating and reducing losses caused by pests and is the basis for\
    \ \nprecision spraying and fertilization. At present, the commonly used disease\
    \ and pest monitoring methods \ninclude spectral detection method, image recognition\
    \ method and electronic nasal detection method. \nZhou Xiaoli et al. [35] designed\
    \ automatic detection methods of forest diseases and pests based on \nspectral\
    \ images, set up deep learning networks and completed the monitoring of the forest\
    \ -staining area \nthrough unmanned aerial vehicle experiments. Zhou Zhankun et\
    \ al. [36] used the greenhouse tomato as \nthe research object, and used THZ-NIR\
    \ high-spectrum fusion technology to study the rapid monitoring \nmethods and\
    \ recognition methods of tomato leaf mold and tomato leaf miner. The improved\
    \ Bayesian \nnetwork's recognition rate of tomato moldy samples was 97.12%, and\
    \ the recognition rate of tomato leaf \nminer was 93.35%. Prasath B. et al. [37]\
    \ designed a new pest detection and classification model based on \noptimized\
    \ YOLOV3 models and deep learning algorithms. The accuracy and F1 scores of this\
    \ method \nreached 96 % and 84 %, respectively. Zeba Anwar et al. [38] effectively\
    \ completed the classification of \npests based on the CNN deep learning model,\
    \ with the model accuracy of 82.5 %. Wu Zhilu et al. [39] \ninvented a method\
    \ of detection of crop disease and pests. This method completes the training of\
    \ visible \noptical pest image samples through convolutional neural networks,\
    \ and then completes feature extraction \nand classification. Sun Yubing et al.\
    \ [40] used electronic nasal technology to analyze the tea trees harmed \nby different\
    \ types of pests. The damage time and quality loss of tea trees can be obtained,\
    \ and the best \ntime point for using electronic nose detection has also been\
    \ discussed. Rakesh Kumar Raigar et al. [41] \nused hybrid electronic nose and\
    \ fuzzy logic methods to evaluate and predict the storage time and rotten \nof\
    \ peanuts, and achieved non -destructive detection of peanut quality. \n2.3 Smart\
    \ Management \nThe management of smart greenhouses integrates cloud platform technology,\
    \ big data \ntechnology, mobile internet technology, and Internet of Things technology.\
    \ It is a cross -regional \noperation control system that integrates smart agricultural\
    \ equipment, cloud wisdom, and service \nplatforms [42]. The functions that the\
    \ intelligent management system needs to complete mainly includes \nCHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY\
    \ \n \n9 \nremote monitoring and controlling of both various environmental parameters\
    \ and working status of work \nfacilities in the greenhouse, and conducting fault\
    \ warning and remote scheduling [43]. The greenhouse \nequipment mainly includes\
    \ fans, water curtains, irrigation systems, and shading curtains [44]. Smart \n\
    management system connects the cloud platform through network, and uploads the\
    \ data from main \ncontrol point to the cloud. Users can complete the remote control\
    \ of greenhouse equipment and remote \nmonitoring of the crop environment through\
    \ the PC or mobile phone side. Li Guoxin et al. [45] designed \na multi-node distributed\
    \ smart agricultural greenhouse monitoring system, setting a private cloud \n\
    platform through EMQTT and Node-Red, and can realize the automatic monitoring,\
    \ intelligent control \nand scientific management of agricultural greenhouse environment\
    \ information. Lee [46] invented a \nprecision control system for smart greenhouses\
    \ and can obtain environmental parameters of multiple \ngreenhouses. The greenhouse\
    \ control server completes remote regulation of multiple greenhouse \nenvironments.\
    \ Wu Yan et al. [47] built a smart management platform for small three-dimensional\
    \ GIS \nreservoirs for agricultural irrigation, organically coupling the needs\
    \ of agricultural irrigation, water \nconservancy scheduling and disaster prevention,\
    \ solved the problem of three -dimensional simulation \nand visual management\
    \ of irrigation districts. Francisco G. Montoya et al. [48] set up the cloud platform\
    \ \ndatabase, designed Android applications based on Linux and Python and achieved\
    \ the acquisition and \nprecise monitoring of agricultural environmental parameters.\
    \ Liu Jixi et al. [49] built a cloud -based \nservice model based on the cloud\
    \ service model, and introduced information push services. The push \nservice\
    \ terminal based on the XMPP protocol can automatically and intelligently recommend\
    \ decision -\nmaking information for users. Han Ruifeng [50] invented an agricultural\
    \ greenhouse environment control \nsystem based on big data technology, increased\
    \ the enters the greenhouse appointment module, timely \nadjust the air oxygen\
    \ content in the greenhouse, and ensure the safety of staff. The system has increased\
    \ \nthe reservation module for entering greenhouses, and can timely adjust the\
    \ air oxygen content to ensure \nthe safety of staff. \n \n3 Conclusion and prospect\
    \ \nAt present, the new generation of information technology represented by the\
    \ Internet, big data \nand artificial intelligence is booming, which has a profound\
    \ impact on economic development, social \nprogress, and people's lives and is\
    \ promoting the rapid development of smart agriculture. This article \nintroduces\
    \ the important position and research progress of key technologies such as Internet\
    \ of Things \ntechnology, intelligent perception technology and smart management\
    \ technology. At present, the \nconstruction of smart greenhouses has just begun,\
    \ and the problems that need to be solved for large -\nscale promotion and application\
    \ include: \n1) Study low -cost and efficient smart greenhouse monitoring and\
    \ control systems, and achieve \nrapid construction in application scenarios,\
    \ thereby improving the efficiency of the construction of smart \ngreenhouses\
    \ and reducing construction costs. \n2) Study the new principles and algorithms\
    \ of high -precision, fast real -time sensors such as \nchlorophyll and nitrogen\
    \ sensors, and soil nutrients sensors to improve the accuracy and reliability\

  analysis: The document demonstrates how an infrared carbon dioxide sensor can be
    used for greenhouse gas detection and describes the design of a sensor that includes
    a gas chamber, an optical module, and a waterproof breathable coverage. The sensor
    uses differential detection technology to measure carbon dioxide concentration
    in the range of 30-5000 ppm and is equipped with a wireless communication module
    for data transmission to a remote server. The sensor was tested in a greenhouse
    environment and demonstrated good stability and accuracy in measuring carbon dioxide
    concentration. The breathable waterproof coverage helps prevent condensation on
    the sensor's optical module, allowing it to operate in high humidity environments.
    The addition of environmental sensors allows for the monitoring of temperature,
    humidity, and leaf temperature, which can be used to adjust the ventilation and
    gas flow to prevent condensation and optimize the environment for plant growth.
    Overall, the paper contributes to the field of automated irrigation management
    by providing a detailed design and evaluation of a low-cost, accurate, and robust
    carbon dioxide sensor that can be used to monitor and control greenhouse environments.

    and anti-condensation capability was experimentally demonstrated for greenhouse
    application. The sensor included an optical module integrated in a multi-pass
    gas chamber using the dual-channel detection method to suppress environmental
    noise. Considering the condensation phenomenon in the greenhouse, the optical
    chamber was protected with a breathable waterproof coverage. The field test demonstrated
    that the internal optical framework was kept in stable relative humidity, ensuring
    the sensor’s applicability in the greenhouse. For wireless communication, received
    signal strength indication was used to ensure the reliability of link quality
    and enable smart power regulation. In related experiments, there was a satisfying
    performance in terms of stability and error detection within the measurement range
    of 30 − 5000 ppm. Without increasing the integral time, the limit of detection
    of the sensor was at least 30 ppm, which was acceptable for greenhouse application.
    A field test was carried out in Town Shelin of Jilin Province, China and the test
    showed the proposed sensor had relatively good prospect for application in fine
    agriculture. Keywords: carbon dioxide sensorcondensationinfrared absorptionorthogonal
    locked amplifier Introduction With the deep investigation of precision agricultures,
    the integration of traditional agricultural and electronic technology has been
    a desired research direction and is flourishing in Chinese agriculture.[ 1–3]
    The crop yield from solar greenhouse has increased by more than 3400 km2 from
    1820 to 2010.[ 4] Agriculture within greenhouses is still labor-intensive compared
    to other industries which is obviously lacking information technology application.
    Because of significant effect of crop yield increase and relative development
    of greenhouse farm, vertical farming with monitoring and management system gradually
    takes the place of the traditional agricultural in greenhouse.[ 5, 6] The environmental
    factors including temperature, humidity, and luminance and carbon dioxide concentration
    have a combined effect on the crop yield and health state of plants. However,
    in view of fine greenhouse application, the related research on cost performance,
    applicability to complex conditions and desired detection performance of carbon
    dioxide sensor is still insufficient.[ 7, 8] Existing carbon dioxide sensing techniques
    normally includes semiconductor, electrochemical, and infrared absorption spectroscopy.[
    9–11] However, the mixed gases which are used for producing crops, insects and
    fertilizers, limit the application of semiconductors sensors in special environment
    of greenhouse. Therefore, the general utilized sensor in greenhouse is electrochemical
    sensor, such as MG811, which requires long warm-up time, high temperatures working
    conditions, and large amount of energy consumption. Besides the harsh working
    conditions, the low measurement limitation of electrochemical sensors like MG811
    is nearly 400 ppm which cannot satisfy the special requirement of greenhouse which
    usual has a closed configuration and at least lower than 200 ppm carbon dioxide
    concentration at noon. In contrast, the infrared absorption spectroscopy technology
    is able to satisfy kinds of various desires like measurement accuracy, high sensitivity,
    long time stability, and wide measurement range. In the selection of infrared
    absorption technologies in the application of agriculture, photo-acoustic spectroscopy
    (PAS) detector has a desired sensitivity having an advantage on trace gas detection.
    But the capability in complex environment is insufficient.[ 12] The shortage of
    tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) technology in the field of
    agriculture is an exorbitant economic cost.[ 12, 13] The current researches extend
    the application of tunable diode laser to carbon dioxide detection in agriculture.[
    14] However, the relative weak absorption in near infrared region have to rely
    on longer integration time (2.5 min) to improve the low limitation of detection
    which is not able to satisfy the real-time detection request. In consideration
    of the cost-effective, special application environmental conditions and practical
    accuracy requirement of agriculture, the direct absorption spectroscopy (DAS)[
    15, 16] technology was more favored compared with other relative technologies.
    Carbon dioxide sensor based on DAS using light-emitting diode (LED) and thermal
    light source have been developed and even produced in mass production. As a light
    source, LED is able to be modulated by a high frequency and has a high stability
    in long time working. However, the weak infrared emission power limits the detection
    performance.[ 17] The commercial sensors using thermal light source, such as K30,
    normally have a high integration with low cost.[ 18] As the price of high integration
    structure, a short absorption path with signal channel limits the detection performance
    and repeatability. As an application experience, commercial sensors are recommended
    to be calibrated every two or three months. Low sampling frequency limits the
    future gas fertilization performance. In addition, the capability in high humidity
    environment and real-time state monitoring of sensor are the common defects of
    commercial sensors. In order to make up the disadvantages mentioned above, a self-developed
    sensor with gas chamber with spherical mirror and anti-condensation protection
    was designed and fabricated to increase optical path and ensure the capability
    in greenhouse. Differential detection technology with 4 Hz modulation is used
    to avoid the effect from light source aging and dust accumulation. Besides the
    related carbon dioxide sensing technologies, the common term wireless sensor network
    (WSN) widely used in regional surveillance and monitoring application is adopted
    to equip sensor nodes with wireless data transmission ability and form a data
    collection network for information acquired from each sensor nodes.[ 1, 19, 20]
    In the utilizations of WSN in greenhouse, the received signal strength indication
    (RSSI) is a common method to evaluate the valid communication distance between
    the sensor nodes and terminals.[ 21] In consideration of the special environmental
    influences of greenhouse, the condensation occurs on the surface of optical module
    is urgent to solve. In the term of the optical module of sensor using NDIR technologies,
    dew condensation would cause serious errors from light absorption, scattering,
    refraction, and reflections. In addition, the temperature difference caused by
    the semi closed structure of sensor provides an advantaged condition for dew condensation.
    A prevention system for forecasting the dew condensation based on dew condensation
    temperature calculation[ 22] is designed and fabricated with the real-time environmental
    information measurement. Sensor node design Sensor node configuration and theory
    According to application requirements in solar greenhouse, an infrared carbon
    dioxide sensor was designed and fabricated aiming to satisfy the specific measurement
    requirements. Fig. 1 shows the schematic diagram of the carbon dioxide sensor
    node, including the optical and electrical parts. In the optical part, the light
    source and detector were integrated in a chamber with a spherical reflector to
    increase the transmission length. Infrared light from a wideband infrared source
    (IR55) was reflected by the spherical reflector and was received by a dual–channel
    Pyroelectric detector (LM244). In electrical part, both differential signals and
    light source driving current were processed and generated by the micro-controller
    (STM32F103RTC6). The original voltage signals measured from detector were processed
    by the integrated pre-amplification (PA), subtractor, low pass filter (LPF), and
    an analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The measured data were processed as digital
    signals by a self-developed orthogonal lock-in amplifier. Figure 1. Structure
    of the mid-infrared carbon dioxide sensor node. Detail of sensor structure including
    a spherical reflector was used to optimize the optical path, condensation protection
    covering the chamber surface, driving, and signal processing circuits are shown.
    Display full size For sensor protection during application in complex environments
    like a greenhouse, the optical part was protected by a waterproof breathable coverage.
    Environmental parameters, including temperatures and humidity of air, the sensor,
    and leaves were also measured. Besides the above mentioned components, a 433 MHz
    wireless communication module was integrated with the sensor to realize a closed
    loop feedback through wireless data transmission between a laptop terminal and
    sensor nodes. Considering actual request in fine agriculture, a low cost infrared
    light source (IR55) with a wide spectrum covering the measurement wavelength was
    selected for the carbon dioxide sensor. The detector received two central wavelengths
    with two filter windows at 4.26 µm and 4.00 µm, respectively, corresponding to
    the absorption and non-absorption regions of carbon dioxide, respectively. The
    relationship between the desired carbon dioxide concentration and received voltage
    signals could be calculated based on the Beer-Lambert law, as shown in Eq. [1]
    : (1) Where I is the light signal received by the two filtering windows, I0 is
    the initial emission light signal power, K is the absorption coefficient, C is
    carbon dioxide concentration, and L is the optical length (30 cm). Defining k1
    and k2 as the optical-to-electrical conversion coefficients at λ1 and λ2, respectively,
    the amplitudes U1 and U2 of detection signals are derived shown in Eqs. [2] and
    [3] : (2) (3) With ΔU = U2−U1 and based on the above equations, carbon dioxide
    concentration can be determined using Eq. [4] : (4) Indeed, under practical circumstances,
    the influences of scattering, Raleigh scattering, Mie scattering and water vapor
    absorption should be calculated theoretically. However, considering that the two
    filter peak wavelengths λ1 = 4.26 µm and λ2 = 4.00 µm are extremely close to each
    other, the influential coefficients are small enough to be neglected compared
    with other influential factors such as environmental noises. Under inherent characteristics
    of the differential detector, the scattering and absorption coefficients could
    be eliminated through calculation. Besides in the above analysis, Eq. (4) was
    used to define the relationship between carbon dioxide concentration and measured
    voltage signals, which were demonstrated through calibration experiments. Light
    source and detector selection According to the high-resolution transmission molecular
    absorption database 2004 or HITRAN 2004, the absorption spectrum of carbon dioxide
    was plotted in Fig. 2, including the absorption and reference wavelengths around
    4.26 µm and 4.00 µm, respectively. Taking into consideration the greenhouse application
    conditions, methane, and water have a relative high concentration and more attention
    should be paid. In addition, other possible components with low concentration,
    such sulfur dioxide, are at least five orders of absorption magnitude lower than
    carbon dioxide and their effects were ignored. To eliminate the potential interference
    of water and methane, the absorption spectra of water and methane around the absorption
    and reference ranges are shown in the figures as well. As shown in Fig. 2a, absorbance
    values of water and methane were nearly five orders of magnitude lower than that
    of carbon dioxide around 4.26 µm. In addition, Fig. 2b shows almost no absorption
    near 4 µm for carbon dioxide, water, and methane. Hence, 4.26 µm and 4.00 µm were
    used as detection channel and reference channel. Based on the analysis of the
    above absorption and reference spectra, a Perkin Elmer’s dual–channel pyroelectric
    detector with a detectivity (D*) of 3.5 × 108 cm Hz1/2/W, equipped with the responding
    filter windows at 4.26 µm and 4.00 µm, was selected as detector of this sensor.
    The original voltage difference, which was lower than 10 mV, was amplified by
    the inherent pre-amplifier to simplify the following signal processing. Figure

    range of the selected detector and cost-effectiveness requirements, an infrared
    light source (IR55) fabricated with the micro-electromechanical system (MEMS)
    technology was used as the light source, with a wide emission spectrum range covering
    both the absorption and reference ranges. Based on the response curve of both
    the detector and light source, the modulation frequency was limited to under 10Hz.
    In the range below 10Hz, 4Hz modulation had the highest signal to noise ratio
    (SNR) and was selected as the modulation frequency. In consideration of the thermal
    characteristic of light source, the stable time needed after startup is a critical
    parameter for practical application. After an experiment, the time for the temperature
    to enter the stable region was 51 second with a fluctuation less than 1° as shown
    in Fig. 3a. When the light source is under stable state, the spectrum of the driven
    IR55 is shown in Fig. 3b, covering a wide range of wavelengths, from near- to
    mid-infrared. The detailed emission spectrum corresponding to the two filter windows
    of the detector is shown in the inset of Fig. 3b. In practice, relatively high
    amounts of carbon dioxide originate from the operator and humidity in air corresponds
    to most absorption near 4.26 µm and 5.5-7.5 µm, respectively. Figure 3. Emission

    Development of a waterproof optical module In order to enable the application
    of a sensor based on the non-dispersive infra-red (NDIR) technology in the greenhouse
    environment, the dew condensation phenomenon on optical components should be paid
    more attention to. In the greenhouse environment, dew condensation occurs when
    the temperature of the sensor’s components is lower than the dew point. Besides
    air temperature and relative humidity, the components temperature in the optical
    part was also measured for real-time anti-condensation. In addition, current treatment
    options for diseases and insect pests are mainly based on early prevention and
    control. Considering the proliferation of diseases caused by dew formation on
    the leaf surface, the leaf temperature on a non-direct sunlight surface with lower
    temperature (i.e. easily affected by dew formation) was measured for warning and
    relative regulation. For dew point calculation, the variable factors used were
    ambient temperature and humidity measured by the environmental sensor nodes as
    well as the temperature of components in the optical part. Tdew was defined as
    the dew condensation temperature. Based on a report by Barenbrug et al.[23] for
    dew point calculation, with the parameters a and b having constant values, the
    dew condensation temperature was calculated by using Eqs. [5] and [6] with an
    error of  ±0.4 °C. (5) (6) In the above equation, the relevant parameters T and
    RH are temperature in degrees Celsius and relative humidity, respectively. With
    the dynamic changing of temperature or humidity, the dew condensation temperature
    may be close to or even above the surface temperature of plants, indicating condensation
    occurrence. Besides a compromised selection between waterproof ability and breathability,
    the capability to sustain high humidity and temperature should also be considered.
    Therefore, breathable waterproof membranes made of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene
    (ePTFE) were selected and used to cover ventilation holes. The permeability of
    ePTFE was higher than 480 ml/min, with superior performance compared with commonly
    used materials like thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU). Moreover, the chemical
    stability of ePTFE could protect the sensor from corrosion caused by fertilizers.
    Finally, considering the high surface temperature of the sensor caused by prolonged
    direct sunlight, the anti-high-temperature ability of ePTFE (up to 250 °C) is
    also able to satisfy this requirement. The selected breathable waterproof membranes
    were placed on vents close to fans to enable adjustable gas flow velocity between
    the optical parts and outside. Digital lock-in amplifier In this detection system,
    a digital lock-in amplifier was developed. The two inputs of the digital orthogonal
    lock-in amplifier were differential and 4 Hz square reference signals, respectively.
    Irradiated with the modulated light, the detector generated two signals, and the
    differential signal was obtained through a differential amplifier. The reference
    signal was generated by the driving 4 Hz square signal to replace the sine wave,
    which is able to suppress the quantization error. After the sampling, the phase
    of the reference signal was shifted by 90°. The two output voltage signals were
    processed by two low pass filters. The amplitude of the absorption amplitude signal
    could be calculated with a high signal and noise ratio. Wireless communication
    To avoid the difficulty of wire installation, Si4463, a highly integrated wireless
    industrial scientific medical band transceiver chip working in 433 MHz, was integrated
    to the electrical part of the sensor. Compared with traditional wireless modules,
    Si4463 has extremely low receiver sensitivity (−126 dBm), even lower in the actual
    experiment, and an adjustable output power of up to +20 dBm, effectively enhancing
    the transmission region and improving the link communication performance. In the
    communication process, besides sensor identification, the collected environmental
    data and acknowledgement signal, the real-time RSSI value was also packaged in
    accordance with the communication protocol. The RSSI value was measured following
    the receiver transmitted data to evaluate the quality of the wireless communication
    signal, which reflected the situation of the communication environment. In different
    plant growth phases, the sensor node is able to adjust the transmission power
    according to the real-time RSSI value obtained with the shielding effect of plants.
    Considering the balance between energy consumption and the data loss rate, the
    default feasible RSSI range was set from −75 dBm to −90 dBm, which can be adjusted
    based on special requirements. The selective transmission power from 0 dBm to
    20 dBm with a 3 dBm one step would be adjusted automatically when the actual measured
    RSSI value is out of the feasibility range. For the field test, the sensor node
    was installed at a height of 1.2 m and the communication was reliable within 85 m
    (RSSI is −90 dBm at 85 m) under a 20 dBm transmission power. With a transmission
    distance longer than 110 m (loss rate less than 1% within 110 m), the data loss
    rate showed a relatively dramatic increase. Comparison with commercial sensors
    Based on the NDIR technology, small size commercial sensors have already been
    designed by Senseair Company (K30) and ELT Sensor Company (S300 and T100).[ 18,
    24] However, compared with the sensor developed in this work, the commercial sensors
    have several disadvantages as follows: First, there was insufficient precision
    and stability (about 3% of reading ±50 ppm), not satisfying the measurement requirements
    of the related low detection range. Secondly, according to gas experiments, at
    carbon dioxide concentration lower than 60 ppm, an inverse relationship existed
    between the measured and standard concentrations, which may mislead the future
    irrigation strategy. This experimental result is presumably caused by the common
    impact of the software algorithm embedded in the commercial sensor and insufficient
    level of detail. Thirdly, compared with the two-channel differential detection
    method used in the designed sensor, commercial sensors with single-channel detector
    do not guarantee long term repeatability and stability. Indeed, remedial correction
    is recommended every two or three months. Finally, considering the future control
    of carbon dioxide concentration, the typical sample period of commercial sensors
    is 3 s, which significantly limits control’s precision. The humidity range of
    application of the self-made CO2 sensor is separately considered by two parts.
    The inside part of sensor is protected by a waterproof breathable cover and the
    humidity is kept relatively constant. The applicable range of outsider part including
    temperature sensor and wireless mode is up to 95% according to the datasheet.
    Therefore, the final humidity range is set to 0–95%. According to a temperature
    experiment, the temperature range of application of the self-made CO2 sensor is
    0 to 50 °C. In addition, when the temperature is higher than 50°, there is an
    error caused by the increased temperature on the light source. Sum up, the range
    of application of the self-developed NDIR sensor is 0–95% and 0–50 °C. Experiment
    and calibration Gas preparation and noise analysis During the experiment and calibration,
    to avoid operation errors caused by the external pressure difference, dynamic
    gas distribution was used instead of static injection distribution. During the
    experiment, the gas sample was continuously pumped into the chamber with a certain
    gas flow. An exhaust pipe was installed on the other side of the chamber to eliminate
    excess gas and maintain constant pressure. Because the possible impact caused
    by interference gases, such as water and methane, has been filtered out theoretically
    as described in the sections “Light source and detector selection and Development
    of a waterproof optical module,” the gas samples only includes carbon dioxide
    and nitrogen (N2). In fact, according to the field test, the methane concentration
    is about 120 ppm and the ammonia and sulfur dioxide concentration is low enough
    to be ignored. To ensure result accuracy, the gas samples used for gas distribution
    were 5000 ppm carbon dioxide with 2% uncertainty and 99.999% pure N2. The different
    concentrations of gas-carbon dioxide required were obtained by mixing the two
    standard gas samples mentioned above through a mass flow meter (MT50-3G). In noise
    assessment experiments, the chamber was continuously flushed with pure N2 to maintain
    a zero carbon dioxide concentration in the environment. A high SNR is a desired
    parameter in sensor design, reflecting the sensor’s performance including accuracy
    and the detection limit. In the SNR experiment, both the noise characteristics
    sampled after pre-amplifier of the sensor under turn-on state and turn-off state
    of the light source were measured using a radio-frequency spectrum analyzer. Under
    the turn-off state, the noise at modulation frequency (4 Hz) is lower than −70 dBm
    in both detection and reference channels. Under the turn-on state, the bandwidth
    of 10 dB at 4 Hz was nearly 1.6 Hz indicating the desired performance and high
    SNR of this sensor. Calibration experiment In the calibration experiment, a series
    of required gas samples, from 0 ppm to 5000 ppm were distributed and flushed into
    the chamber. Until sufficient stability the measured data ΔU was recorded over
    more than 10 min for each concentration. The fitting curves between average ΔU
    and the carbon dioxide concentration C, and the related fitting equation are shown
    in Fig. 4. The desired carbon dioxide concentration was obtained using Eq. [7]
    : (7) Figure 4. Relationship between measured voltage signal and carbon dioxide
    concentration. Dot plots and fitting curves for the measured differential value
    ΔU with carbon dioxide concentration C. At every concentration, 10 min samples
    were recorded (inset). Display full size To verify the accuracy of the fitting,
    different gas samples were distributed from 0 ppm to 5000 ppm and the developed
    sensor was employed to measure the concentration of each gas sample. The concentration
    of the prepared gas sample was treated as the standard concentration and named
    X, while the concentration reading from the sensor was termed Y. The slope indicating
    the relationship between the measured and standard carbon dioxide concentrations
    was very close to one with an ignorable offset, which demonstrated a high accordance
    between measured and standard values. When the measured carbon dioxide concentration
    was higher than 50 ppm, a relative detection error below 3.7% was obtained. In
    the low concentration range from 15 ppm to 50 ppm, a relatively longer integral
    time and average calculation is recommended to achieve the desired measurement
    performance according to the specific requirements. For even lower concentration
    detection, the measurement performance cannot be guaranteed. To measure the lower
    limit of detection, the chamber was first flushed with pure N2. Then, the carbon
    dioxide mass flow was increased stepwise by 10 ppm. The measurement results are
    shown in Fig. 5a, without processing by any software algorithm. The lower limit
    of detection for the developed sensor was at least 30 ppm and even lower after
    optimization. Considering the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere and
    the limited sealing performance in the greenhouse environment, this lower limit
    of detection is acceptable for greenhouse application. Fig. 5b shows the Allan
    variance of the developed sensor, indicating its stability and the theoretical
    detection limit of the system. Long-term measurement was carried out under 0 ppm
    carbon dioxide. With integration time increased to 30 s, the influence from white
    noise was negligible where the slope differed from −1. With integration time increased
    to the intersection point of 0.5 slope, the detection system reached its theoretical
    detection limit of 15 ppm. At the cost of response time, the detection limit could
    be decreased, providing some flexible options for different application environments.
    Figure 5. Low detection limit. (a) 50 ppm to 10 ppm carbon dioxide samples with
    10 ppm stepwise increase were used in the experiment; (b) Allan''s variance analysis.
    Display full size Detection stability In the current experiments, gas samples
    were distributed and continually flushed into the chamber with a slow speed to
    simulate the practical situation of the greenhouse. Several gas samples with different
    concentration are prepared. As an example, 72 h results are shown in Fig. 6. Because
    of the combination influence of operation error, distribution error from mass
    flow and detection error of sensor, the fluctuations are 5.2%, 4%, 2.2%, 1.08%,
    and 0.5% at 100 ppm, 500 ppm, 1000 ppm, 2000 ppm, and 4000 ppm, respectively.
    During the long-term test, there is no measurement drift and spikes occurrence
    which indicates a desired detection stability. Figure 6. Stability data. Long-term
    measurement results from the five carbon dioxide standard samples at concentrations
    of 100 ppm, 500 ppm, 1000 ppm, 2000 ppm, and 4000 ppm, respectively for stability
    evaluation. Display full size Field test results and discussion Environmental
    factors in the field test results To test the application performance of the designed
    sensor, field tests were carried out in Town Shelin in Jilin Province. Several
    self-developed sensors are deployed in greenhouse and the most measurement data
    complied with the photosynthesis law, indicating that the desired detection performance
    was achieved. Because of photosynthesis caused by strong luminance, the lowest
    carbon dioxide concentration in the greenhouse was below 280 ppm at about 13:00.
    At about the same time, the temperature of the greenhouse was increased to the
    peak about 35° with the lowest relative humidity about 78%. However, an unnatural
    phenomenon of luminance drastically decreasing to zero at 17:45 was observed.
    This might be because the greenhouse was covered with a ceiling driven by rolling
    machines for insulation, as frequently found in cold regions. In addition, a reasonable
    compensation of carbon dioxide gas fertilization corresponding to the plant species
    and growth stages is a potential application based on the proposed sensor system.
    Anti-condensation field test results According to the condensation phenomenon
    caused by diurnal temperature, the breathable waterproof membranes could insulate
    the optical part from the surrounding high humidity environment and maintained
    a constant relative humidity inside the shell. To accelerate the gas diffusion
    speed, four fans were installed on the ventilation holes, and their speed could
    be regulated according to the specific requirements. The test results for dew
    condensation in the field are shown in Fig. 7. Figure 7. Field test for anti-condensation
    performance of the sensor. The real-time dew condensation temperature was calculated
    to indicate condensation risk. Display full size The black and red curves are
    the measured air humidity and internal humidity of the sensor, respectively. The
    internal temperature had a relatively smooth change trend compared with the outside
    air temperature, which is a useful method for preventing condensation. With the
    protection of breathable waterproof membranes made of ePTFE, the green curve representing
    internal humidity was maintained at a relatively low level. It is worth mentioning
    that the measured practical internal humidity of the sensor was not an ideal constant
    value but varied inversely with the environmental temperature in a small range
    (56% to 59%) due to complex environmental factors. The calculated dew condensation
    temperature in the optical part of the sensor was represented by the blue curve
    using the Barenbrug formula. Overall, during the whole day time, there were more
    than six temperature buffer ranges between the internal temperature and dew condensation
    temperature, indicating that the installed breathable waterproof membranes had
    effectively prevented condensation in the optical part of the sensor. Conclusion
    A differential mid-infrared carbon dioxide sensor with wireless and anti-condensation
    properties was designed and implemented. Compared with related researches and
    commercial sensors, a signal-source dual-channel detection system integrated into
    a chamber with anti-condensation protection effectively improves the detection
    accuracy, repeatability, and applicability in high humidity environment. The related
    experiments characterizes at least a 30 ppm lower limit of detection. Based on
    72 h long-term stability detection on 100 ppm, 500 ppm, 1000 ppm, 2000 ppm, and
    4000 ppm, the maximum detection errors are 5.2%, 4%, 2.2%, 1.08%, and 0.5% respectively.
    A field experiment was carried out and demonstrated that the self-produced carbon
    dioxide sensor could satisfy application requirements in the greenhouse. Besides
    its low cost, satisfactory precision, and robust performance, the sensor has a
    relatively high prospect in fine agriculture application. Conflict of interest

  analysis: "This research paper explores the use of agricultural-purpose frequency\
    \ domain reflectometry (FDR) sensors for highway subgrade construction, reconstruction\
    \ and extension projects, with a particular focus on the types of data most applicable\
    \ to irrigation management and their typical sources. Unlike previous studies\
    \ on soil moisture content via numerical simulation or calculation based on variables\
    \ such as temperature, moisture, wind speed, rainfall, evaporation and transpiration,\
    \ FDR sensors provide a direct, real-time, and reliable monitoring method with\

    \ to addressing the global food challenge by exploring automated systems for real-time\
    \ irrigation management. It evaluates the current state and future potential of\
    \ end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine\
    \ learning technologies. The paper additionally examines automation across the\
    \ entire pipeline of irrigation management, from data collection and transmission\
    \ to processing, analysis, decision-making, and automated action, highlighting\
    \ the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling the integration\

    \ use of agricultural-purpose\nfrequency domain reﬂectometry (FDR) sensors to\
    \ monitor temperature and moisture of a subgrade\nin highway extension and reconstruction\
    \ engineering. The principle of agricultural-purpose FDR\nsensors and the process\
    \ for embedding this kind of sensors for subgrade engineering purposes are\nintroduced.\
    \ Based on ﬁeld measured weather data, a numerical analysis model for temperature\
    \ and\nmoisture content in the subgrade’s soil is built. Comparisons of the temperature\
    \ and moisture data\nobtained from numerical simulation and FDR-based measurements\
    \ are conducted. The results show\nthat: (1) the embedding method and process,\
    \ data acquisition, and remote transmission presented\nare reasonable; (2) the\
    \ temperature and moisture changes are coordinated with the atmospheric\nenvironment\
    \ and they are also in close agreement with numerical calculations; (3) the change\
    \ laws of\nboth are consistent at positions where the subgrade is compacted uniformly.\
    \ These results suggest\nthat the data measured by the agricultural-purpose FDR\
    \ sensors are reliable. The ﬁndings of this\npaper enable a new and effective\
    \ real-time monitoring method for a subgrade’s temperature and\nmoisture changes,\
    \ and thus broaden the application of agricultural-purpose FDR sensors.\nKeywords:\
    \ FDR sensor; highway reconstruction and extension; temperature and moisture;\
    \ ﬁeld\nmeasurement; numerical simulation\n1. Introduction\nMoisture content is\
    \ an important physical parameter when we study soil properties, which will\n\
    change with the variation of moisture content. Monitoring the variation of moisture\
    \ content in the\nﬁeld of civil engineering projects, such as highway subgrades,\
    \ railway embankments, prevention and\ntreatment of slopes, foundation engineering,\
    \ is an important research direction.\nThe soil-ﬁlled structure for the highway\
    \ subgrade is compacted in layers according to speciﬁc\ntechnical standards, and\
    \ the moisture content and temperature changes in the soil have important\ninﬂuences\
    \ on subgrade performance (modulus and settlement) [1]. As subgrade soil is unsaturated\n\
    soil, there exists a certain correlation among its moisture, temperature and modulus:\
    \ the moisture\nand temperature have a substantial effect on the modulus, especially\
    \ the change of moisture content\nsigniﬁcantly affect the modulus, sometimes even\
    \ plays a decisive role [2–6]; moreover, the moisture\nand temperature are also\
    \ main factors inﬂuencing the settlement deformation of the subgrade [7,8].\n\
    The variation of moisture and modulus can impact the pavement structure and further\
    \ affect the trafﬁc\nsafety on and functions of the highway [9]. Previous researchers\
    \ have done extensive laboratory tests\nSensors 2016, 16, 857; doi:10.3390/s16060857\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2016, 16, 857\n2 of 18\non modulus and settlement\
    \ changes with the variation of moisture and temperature, but there is no\nappropriate\
    \ method for real-time monitoring of moisture content and temperature changes\
    \ of subgrade\nsoil in the ﬁeld. In most of the previous studies on highway construction\
    \ or reconstruction/extension\nprojects, the moisture content and temperature\
    \ in the subgrade are subject to numerical simulation and\ncalculation based on\
    \ climatic parameters (temperature, moisture, wind speed, rainfall, evaporation\n\
    and transpiration, underground water level, etc.) [10–13]. Though certain effectivity\
    \ has been achieved,\nthe method requires many parameters, parameter acquisition\
    \ is difﬁcult and the calculations are\ncomplex [14]. Therefore, an appropriate\
    \ and effective method for real-time monitoring of soil moisture\nand temperature\
    \ is imperative.\nAt present, moisture content can be detected by both direct\
    \ and indirect methods. Direct methods\nare mainly oven-drying methods, while\
    \ indirect methods include the resistor method, ray method,\ntensiometer method\
    \ and recently developed methods such as frequency domain reﬂectometry (FDR).\n\
    FDR is used to test the apparent dielectric constant of soil based on the principle\
    \ of electromagnetic\npulses and according to electromagnetic wave propagation\
    \ in the soil, and then to obtain the volumetric\nmoisture content in the soil.\
    \ Hilhorst presented a frequency domain decomposition method [15] after\ncarrying\
    \ out a large amount of research and proposed that the dielectric constant of\
    \ soil can be\ndecomposed at a reasonable test frequency. This method is to obtain\
    \ the soil’s conductivity from the\nimaginary part of the dielectric constant\
    \ at a reasonable frequency (20–30 MHz) by means of the vector\nvoltage measurement\
    \ technique, and then to convert it into the soil’s moisture content from the\
    \ real\npart of the dielectric constant. Moreover, he designed and developed a\
    \ special Application Speciﬁc\nIntegrated Circuit (ASIC) chip for soil moisture\
    \ sensors used in FDR, which not only improved the\nreliability of FDR soil moisture\
    \ sensors but also greatly reduced the production cost, thus enabling the\nproduction\
    \ and promotion of FDR soil moisture sensors [16]. Leib et al. [17] found that\
    \ uncalibrated\nFDR sensors can be used for observing the trend of soil moisture\
    \ content, but cannot obtain accurate\nabsolute moisture content, so their calibration\
    \ parameters should be determined accurately in advance\nfor different soil types.\
    \ Tejero et al. [18] studied the measurement of soil moisture content using\n\
    FDR sensors in two ways: direct drilling and conventional tillage, and found direct\
    \ drilling to be\nmore accurate.\nThe oven-drying method is of the most accurate\
    \ when measuring soil moisture content, but in the\nﬁeld of civil engineering,\
    \ particularly in highway engineering, this method will destroy the subgrade\n\
    structure, so it is not allowed during the operation of the highway. Soil moisture\
    \ sensors based on FDR\ntechnology are advantageous for their features such as\
    \ cheapness, speed, easy handling and less soil\ndisturbance, and are one of the\
    \ common instruments for measuring in situ soil volumetric moisture\ncontent [19].\
    \ Ye et al. [20] and Choi et al. [21] studied the application of FDR sensors in\
    \ environmental\ntesting and evaluation, reaching the conclusion that they were\
    \ effective in the ﬁeld of environmental\nengineering. Skierucha et al. [22] studied\
    \ the use of FDR for measuring the water content in different\nfrequency ranges.\
    \ Wilczek et al. [23] examined the monitoring of soil pore water salinity using\
    \ an\nFDR sensor working at various frequencies up to 500 MHz. Gastao et al. [24]\
    \ measured the irrigation\nschedules of cabbages by using a sub-hourly frequency-domain\
    \ reﬂectometer. Girón et al. [25] studied\nthe differences in physiological response\
    \ between leaves and fruits of table olive trees under moderate\nwater stress\
    \ using FDR sensors. In summary, FDR technology can be considered a mature testing\n\
    technique, widely applicable in agriculture and environmental engineering [26–29].\n\
    To sum up, as a technology for rapidly detecting the soil temperature and moisture\
    \ content, FDR\nsensors have widely been used in agriculture, but studies on their\
    \ application in civil engineering,\nespecially in highway subgrade construction,\
    \ reconstruction and extension are rarely found. In this\npaper, based on the\
    \ testing principle of FDR sensors, extensive laboratory calibrations for soils\
    \ were\ncarried out ﬁrst using FDR and then we present an application of FDR sensors\
    \ in subgrade widening\n(including the old and newly-ﬁlled subgrades) and a new\
    \ installation method for FDR sensor probes\nis proposed. A small weather station\
    \ and GPRS wireless data transmission system were established\nin the ﬁeld, and\
    \ the real-time temperature and moisture content data monitored by FDR sensors\
    \ are\nSensors 2016, 16, 857\n3 of 18\ncompared with the subgrade soil data obtained\

    \ Overview\nThe case study is based on the Nanchang-Zhangshu Expressway Reconstruction\
    \ and Extension\nProject in China. The old expressway, a bi-directional, four-lane\
    \ road with an asphalt concrete pavement\nand a 27 m-wide subgrade, was put into\
    \ service in December 1997. The widening project commenced\nin November 2012.\
    \ After over a decade of operation, the the Nanchang-Zhangshu Expressway’s old\n\
    subgrade is almost stably settled and it was found through ﬁeld testing that the\
    \ old subgrade soil\nmoisture was higher than the ﬁlling initial moisture content,\
    \ and the modulus of soils displayed a\ncorresponding reduction. When the subgrade\
    \ is widened, differential settlement may occur at the\njunctions between the\
    \ new and old subgrades due to their differences in temperature, moisture content\n\
    and compaction uniformity. Therefore, how to monitor and control the differential\
    \ settlement is a key\nproblem for the Nanchang-Zhangshu Expressway Reconstruction\
    \ and Extension Project.\n2.2.2. Embedding Method and Process\nThere is no previous\
    \ experience in embedding FDR sensors into a subgrade, and after the FDR\nsensors\
    \ are embedded, the excavation will be ﬁlled with water and compacted (by road\
    \ rollers), so in\ncase of improper embedding or protection, FDR sensors will\
    \ be damaged or large measurement errors\nwill result. Given the above factors,\
    \ the following methods are proposed in this paper:\n(1)\nEmbedding FDR sensor\
    \ in old subgrade: drill horizontally to the predetermined depth at the\nside\
    \ slope of the old subgrade with a drilling machine (borehole diameter: 11.0 cm);\
    \ install the\nFDR sensor on one end of the PVC tube (diameter: about 5 cm), and\
    \ push it to the bottom of the\nborehole from the other end of the PVC tube to\
    \ make it completely and closely inserted into soil\nhorizontally (in the old\
    \ subgrade).\n(2)\nEmbedding FDR probes in new subgrade: at the preset subgrade\
    \ elevation, compact and level the\nsubgrade surface and excavate a pit (L ˆ W\
    \ ˆ D: 40 cm ˆ 30 cm ˆ 20 cm) manually at a certain\ninterval; then closely insert\
    \ the probe into soil along the bottom of the pit in a lateral direction\n(the\
    \ inserting direction is vertical to the longitudinal direction of the subgrade);\
    \ last, excavate a\nsmall groove along the cross section of the newly-ﬁlled subgrade\
    \ (W: 10 cm; D: 20 cm; L: 750 cm\n(viz. the width of the entire newly-ﬁlled subgrade))\
    \ to embed the sensor wire into the groove and\nlead it to the outer side of the\
    \ subgrade slope. The embedding ﬂow diagram and ﬁeld embedding\nsketch for FDR\
    \ sensors are shown in Figures 2 and 3, respectively.\nSensors 2016, 16, 857\n\
    5 of 18\n \ninterval; then closely insert the probe into soil along the bottom\
    \ of the pit in a lateral direction \n(the inserting direction is vertical to\
    \ the longitudinal direction of the subgrade); last, excavate a \nsmall groove\
    \ along the cross section of the newly-filled subgrade (W: 10 cm; D: 20 cm; L:\
    \ 750 cm \n(viz. the width of the entire newly-filled subgrade)) to embed the\
    \ sensor wire into the groove \nand lead it to the outer side of the subgrade\

    climate conditions and demonstrate speciﬁc periodic changes, and that the values\
    \ measured by sensors\n#5 and #6 close to the outer edge of the subgrade slope\
    \ show a relatively large change amplitude.\nHowever, the comparison of measured\
    \ values (Figure 5) shows that the minimum temperature values\nfrom numerical\
    \ calculation are 16 ˝C–19 ˝C around February 2014, which is signiﬁcantly different\
    \ from\nthe measured values of 7 ˝C–20 ˝C. Further analysis indicates that the\
    \ reason is that for the numerical\ncalculation it is assumed that the subgrade\
    \ soil mass is uniform with even compactness and minor\nporosity. However, in\
    \ fact, the compactness at different parts of the subgrade and the porosity of\n\
    the soil mass are not uniform, so pores in the soil mass are easily connected\
    \ with each other. For the\nreasons given above, the change amplitude of the temperature\
    \ values measured by the sensors far\nfrom the subgrade slope is smaller than\
    \ that of the values measured by the sensors close to the outer\nside of the subgrade\
    \ slope, which can also be veriﬁed by the values measured by the FDR sensors.\n\
    \ \neven compactness and minor porosity. However, in fact, the compactness at\
    \ different parts of the \nsubgrade and the porosity of the soil mass are not\
    \ uniform, so pores in the soil mass are easily \nconnected with each other. For\
    \ the reasons given above, the change amplitude of the temperature \nvalues measured\
    \ by the sensors far from the subgrade slope is smaller than that of the values\
    \ \nmeasured by the sensors close to the outer side of the subgrade slope, which\
    \ can also be verified by \nthe values measured by the FDR sensors. \nMoreover,\
    \ to better compare and analyze the values measured by the FDR sensors and \n\
    calculated through numerical simulations, sensors #1, #3 and #6 are taken as the\
    \ objects for \ncomparative analysis. From Figure 11a–c below, it can be observed\
    \ that the values measured by \nsensors #1 and #3 are very consistent with the\
    \ calculated values both in their change tendencies and \nchange laws. It is because\
    \ these two sensors are far from the subgrade slope and the measuring \npoints\
    \ are located in the middle of the widened subgrade, so the road roller can provide\
    \ uniform \ncompaction. Conversely, for sensor #6 close to the outer side of the\
    \ subgrade slope, great deviations \nappear between the measured and calculated\
    \ values in their change tendencies and amplitudes. The \nreason for such a difference,\
    \ as analyzed above, is that the compactness of subgrade soil mass is not \nuniform\
    \ and the pores in the soil mass may be interconnected. \nTo sum up, in terms\
    \ of the internal temperature of the subgrade soil, the compactness in the \n\
    middle of the widened subgrade is uniform, so the measured and calculated values\
    \ are close while \nthe values measured by the FDR sensors close to the outer\
    \ edge of the subgrade are greatly different \nfrom the calculated values. According\
    \ to the analysis, the values measured by the FDR sensors are \nmore consistent\
    \ with actual conditions, so it is more reasonable to use measured values for\
    \ \nevaluating the internal temperature of subgrade soil. \n \nFigure 10. Temperature\
    \ obtained from the numerical simulation. \n \n(a) \n \n(b) \nFigure 10. Temperature\
    \ obtained from the numerical simulation.\nMoreover, to better compare and analyze\
    \ the values measured by the FDR sensors and calculated\nthrough numerical simulations,\
    \ sensors #1, #3 and #6 are taken as the objects for comparative analysis.\nFrom\
    \ Figure 11a–c below, it can be observed that the values measured by sensors #1\
    \ and #3 are very\nconsistent with the calculated values both in their change\
    \ tendencies and change laws. It is because\nthese two sensors are far from the\
    \ subgrade slope and the measuring points are located in the middle\nof the widened\
    \ subgrade, so the road roller can provide uniform compaction. Conversely, for\
    \ sensor\n#6 close to the outer side of the subgrade slope, great deviations appear\
    \ between the measured and\ncalculated values in their change tendencies and amplitudes.\
    \ The reason for such a difference, as\nanalyzed above, is that the compactness\
    \ of subgrade soil mass is not uniform and the pores in the soil\nmass may be\
    \ interconnected.\nTo sum up, in terms of the internal temperature of the subgrade\
    \ soil, the compactness in the\nmiddle of the widened subgrade is uniform, so\
    \ the measured and calculated values are close while the\nvalues measured by the\
    \ FDR sensors close to the outer edge of the subgrade are greatly different from\n\
    the calculated values. According to the analysis, the values measured by the FDR\

    \ Comparative Analysis of Moisture Content\nAccording to the comparison between\
    \ the values of moisture content in the subgrade soil mass\nobtained through numerical\
    \ calculation, plotted in Figure 12, and its measured values (Figure 8),\nlarge\
    \ deviations between them can be found, but favorable consistency is shown in\

    \ FDR sensors and calculated through\nnumerical simulations, the sensors #1, #3\
    \ and #6 are taken as the objects. From Figure 13a–c, it can be\nobserved that\
    \ for sensor #6 close to the outer side of the subgrade slope, the measured values\
    \ are very\nconsistent with the values obtained through numerical calculation\
    \ and so are their change tendencies.\nThis is because the soil mass close to\
    \ the outer side of the subgrade is more inﬂuenced by the climatic\nenvironment,\
    \ and can more quickly respond to any changes in climatic conditions.\nFrom Figure\
    \ 13b, the volumetric moisture content values measured by sensor #3 are close\
    \ to the\nvalues obtained through numerical calculations. However, the change\
    \ amplitude of the moisture\ncontent values measured by sensor #3 is obviously\
    \ lower than that of values measured by the sensor #6.\nAccording to careful analysis,\
    \ this is because probe #3 is 5 m away from the subgrade slope and subject\nto\
    \ slighter direct climatic condition inﬂuences than sensor #6. Additionally, the\
    \ change amplitude\nof the moisture content values measured by sensor #3 is not\
    \ as large as that of the values obtained\nthrough numerical calculation. The\
    \ reason is given as follows: the increase or decrease of the moisture\ncontent\
    \ in the subgrade soil mass is realized by the inﬁltration or evaporation of rainwater\
    \ outside; in\nnumerical calculation, it is assumed that subgrade soil is uniform;\
    \ however, the subgrade soil mass is\nactually a heterogeneous body, so the effects\
    \ of inﬁltration or transpiration on different parts of the\nSensors 2016, 16,\

    \ of moisture content in the subgrade\nsoil mass.\n \nAccording to the comparison\
    \ between the values of moisture content in the subgrade soil mass \nobtained\
    \ through numerical calculation, plotted in Figure 12, and its measured values\
    \ (Figure 8), \nlarge deviations between them can be found, but favorable consistency\

    \ volumetric moisture content values measured by sensor #3 are close to the \n\
    values obtained through numerical calculations. However, the change amplitude\
    \ of the moisture \ncontent values measured by sensor #3 is obviously lower than\
    \ that of values measured by the  \nsensor #6. According to careful analysis,\
    \ this is because probe #3 is 5 m away from the subgrade \nslope and subject to\
    \ slighter direct climatic condition influences than sensor #6. Additionally,\
    \ the \nchange amplitude of the moisture content values measured by sensor #3\
    \ is not as large as that of the \nvalues obtained through numerical calculation.\
    \ The reason is given as follows: the increase or \ndecrease of the moisture content\
    \ in the subgrade soil mass is realized by the infiltration or \nevaporation of\
    \ rainwater outside; in numerical calculation, it is assumed that subgrade soil\
    \ is \nuniform; however, the subgrade soil mass is actually a heterogeneous body,\
    \ so the effects of \ninfiltration or transpiration on different parts of the\
    \ subgrade are not consistent, which gives rise to \nthe inconsistency of moisture\
    \ content in the subgrade soil mass. \nFrom Figure 13c, for sensor #1 embedded\
    \ in the old subgrade, the measured values are \nsubstantially different from\
    \ and even inconsistent with the values obtained through numerical \ncalculation\
    \ According to deliberate analysis the reason is that the moisture content in\
    \ the old\nFigure 13. Comparison of measured and calculated volumetric moisture\
    \ content: (a) #6 probe; (b) #3\nprobe; (c) #1 probe.\nFrom Figure 13c, for sensor\
    \ #1 embedded in the old subgrade, the measured values are\nsubstantially different\
    \ from and even inconsistent with the values obtained through numerical\ncalculation.\
    \ According to deliberate analysis, the reason is that the moisture content in\
    \ the old subgrade,\nhaving been subject to over a decade of operation, increases\
    \ [13]; however, the newly-widened\nsubgrade is ﬁlled under optimum moisture content\
    \ conditions, so water migrates from the old subgrade\nto the new one, which causes\
    \ a further decline of the moisture content in the old subgrade. In contrast,\n\
    according to the calculated values, the moisture content in the old subgrade rises,\
    \ because the moisture\ncontent values of the old and new subgrades are designed\
    \ to be same when the mathematical model\nSensors 2016, 16, 857\n15 of 18\nis\
    \ established. The discrepancy shown by sensor #1 can more effectively reﬂect\
    \ the contrast between\nthe measured values of FDR sensors and the calculated\
    \ values. In addition, the analysis on actual\nconditions at the ﬁeld shows that\
    \ measured values of FDR sensors are more consistent with the actual\nconditions,\
    \ thus further verifying that the values measured by FDR sensors are effective.\n\
    5. Conclusions\nBased on the ﬁeld monitoring and numerical simulation, the following\
    \ conclusions can be drawn:\n(1)\nFDR sensors were applied to the subgrade in\
    \ a highway reconstruction project for the ﬁrst time,\nand the embedding method\
    \ and process of the sensors are illustrated. During a monitoring\nperiod of over\
    \ two years, all embedded sensors present reasonable performance for monitoring\n\
    the temperature and moisture inside the subgrade soil. This implies that the embedding\
    \ method\nand process proposed in this paper are reasonable and also indicates\
    \ that agricultural-purpose\nFDR sensors are applicable to the subgrade in highway\
    \ reconstruction and extension projects.\n(2)\nBy means of the small weather station\
    \ built in the ﬁeld and the GPRS module performing wireless\ntransmission, the\
    \ real-time data monitored by FDR sensors can be acquired remotely. Thus, the\n\
    labor cost can be largely reduced and analysis of real-time data monitored is\
    \ accessible, thereby\nenhancing timely and effective evaluation of subgrade performance.\n\
    (3)\nComparison between the measured results by FDR sensors and computed results\
    \ from numerical\nsimulation also demonstrated that the FDR sensor can effectively\
    \ reﬂect the temperature and\nmoisture changes inside subgrades, especially at\
    \ the junction between the old and new subgrades,\nthe measured values are more\
    \ reasonable and effective than the calculated values, and can reﬂect\nthe temperature\
    \ and moisture changes caused by the climatic environment more accurately.\n(4)\n\
    The paper provides a new method and idea for highway researchers to monitor long-term\n\
    changes of the temperature and moisture inside the subgrade, and further inspect\
    \ its long-time\nperformance. This method can be also extended to railway embankments,\
    \ prevention and\ntreatment of slopes foundation engineering and other civil engineering\

  analysis: The paper empirically analyzes the path loss exponent, attenuation index,
    and cumulative beta distribution from experimental data collected using a Zigbee
    module to identify the specific contributions to the signal attenuation caused
    by placement of construction materials along the transmission path, including
    the effects of type and thickness of material. The authors find that the path
    loss exponent is a useful indicator of signal degradation with distance and that
    the attenuation index is a good measure of the attenuation caused by different
    types and thicknesses of construction materials. The paper also demonstrates the
    wide range of variation in the cumulative beta distribution, reflecting different
    characteristics of various construction materials.

    The new paradigm of ubiquitous computing is gradually \nchanging the traditional\
    \ interactions between users and \ncomputers in all industrial areas. As the size\
    \ and com-\nplexity of construction projects increase, the concept of \nubiquitous\
    \ computing with the support of wireless sensor \nnetworks (WSNs) and mobile devices\
    \ has attracted the \nattention of civil engineers for automation in construction\
    \ \nmanagement. Typical WSN applications in construction \nareas include the following:\
    \ measurements of the physi-\ncal quantity during the construction process, materials\
    \ \nand equipment tracking and monitoring, real-time opera-\ntion of construction\
    \ processes, long-term structural health \nmonitoring and safety monitoring. These\
    \ applications re-\nquire a real-time and reliable WSN framework to capture \n\
    the in-situ events of a construction environment. At the \nsame time, WSNs should\
    \ provide a long-term monitor-\ning system with high energy efficiency to survive\
    \ a harsh \nenvironment, such as construction sites. Among the vari-\nous wireless\
    \ technologies, Zigbee is considered a po-\ntential solution for industrial monitoring\
    \ and automation \n(Hwang et al. 2010). The applicability and robustness \nof\
    \ Zigbee has attracted increasing attention not only in \nconstruction areas,\
    \ but also in many industrial sectors, \nsuch as manufacturing and plants, because\
    \ of its small \nsize, low power, low cost, network scalability and self-\nconfiguring\
    \ mechanism. \nFundamentally, a wireless signal is vulnerable to a \nrange of\
    \ environmental factors because electromagnetic \npropagation is often obstructed\
    \ by physical objects and \nother types of signals (Sung, Yang 2010). because\
    \ con-\nstruction sites have an atypical layout with built struc-\ntures, construction\
    \ materials and equipment, they are \noften recognized as unfavourable environments\
    \ for the \nreliable communication of WSNs (Jo et al. 2013). The \nphysical obstructions\
    \ cause signal attenuation by multiple \nreflections, and the corresponding energy\
    \ losses decrease \nthe signal power and reliability at the receiver (Jadhavar,\
    \ \nSontakke 2012). If wireless sensors are placed and used \nwithout a proper\
    \ evaluation of the communication per-\nformance, the entire wireless system might\
    \ have trouble \nproviding reliable measurements over existing wired sys-\ntems.\
    \ As the network size and number of sensors have \nincreased, it is more important\
    \ for the users to exam-\nine the quantitative reliability for designing an efficient\
    \ \nnetwork topology and for estimating the WSN  operation \n106\nW.-S. Jang et\
    \ al. Reliability performance of wireless sensor network for civil infrastructure\
    \ ...\ncost. Although there are a range of research efforts re-\nlated to WSN\
    \ applications in civil and construction areas, \nlittle research has been performed\
    \ on a quantitative and \nexperimental evaluation of the WSN performance.\nThis\
    \ paper presents the experimental findings that \ncan help analyse the performance\
    \ reliability of wireless \ncommunications and design an efficient network topol-\n\
    ogy for possible applications in civil infrastructure. In \nthis research, field\
    \ experiments have been conducted \nto evaluate the signal attenuation obstructed\
    \ by major \nconstruction materials using a 2.4 GHz Zigbee wireless \nmodule.\
    \ In addition, analytical methodologies were also \naddressed to quantify the\
    \ performance of WSNs in ap-\nplications to civil infrastructure. \n1. Literature\
    \ review\nAn interest on wireless communication technologies \nat construction\
    \ sectors is increasing, resulting in active \nresearch and development activities\
    \ on applications. It \nhas been reported that Zigbee among several wireless \n\
    communication technologies such as bluetooth and WiFi \nshows excellent performances\
    \ under various hindering \nenvironments like industrial sites based on its advantag-\n\
    es including low power consumption of 2.4 GHz band, \nlow cost and convenient\
    \ network scalability (Panitz  \net al. 2008). One of the most representative\
    \ areas ap-\nplied with Zigbee among construction industry sectors \nis the bridge\
    \ monitoring sector, and Xiao et al. (2011) \nproposed a methodology to evaluate\
    \ the structural health \nand damage of bridges by measuring the vibration data\
    \ of \nbridge structures with the vehicles traveling at any time. \nChae et al.\
    \ (2012) developed a bridge monitoring system \nthat is capable of collecting\
    \ long-distance data measured \nthrough 5 types of 45 sensors installed at a suspension\
    \ \nbridge by using Zigbee and Code Division Multiple Ac-\ncess (CDMA). Moreover,\
    \ Liu and Teng (2010) presented \na system that enables measuring of bridge movement\
    \ in \nreal time using an acceleration sensor applied with Zig-\nbee and providing\
    \ immediate information via 3G net-\nwork to controllers when a danger is detected.\
    \ bocca  \net al. (2011) used a wireless sensor network that can \nmeasure temperature,\
    \ humidity and acceleration to carry \nout an experiment with a wooden bridge\
    \ model. \nIn other application studies, it has been reported that \nthe Zigbee\
    \ functions of wireless data transmission/recep-\ntion and position tracking are\
    \ used for resource manage-\nment systems of construction materials, workers and\
    \ \nequipment as well as for work process management, safe-\nty management of\
    \ workers at construction sites and pro-\nductivity measurement. Kim et al. (2011)\
    \ selected RFID \nand Zigbee as the wireless communications methods to \ntrack\
    \ physical distribution of construction materials in \nreal time. Zhang and Wei\
    \ (2012) regarded construction  \nworkers as mobile nodes to measure RSSI from\
    \ the Zigbee \nmodule carried by such workers and proposed hardware \nand software\
    \ designs that can perform positioning and \ntracking. Raj and Varghese (2012)\
    \ suggested a position  \n(location) tracking system that can promote improvement\
    \ \nof construction productivity and secure safety of work-\ners. Naticchia et\
    \ al. (2013) proposed a methodology for \ninspectors to monitor construction workers\
    \ in real time \nwith efficiency. In the literature on safety management \nareas,\
    \ Zigbee-based self-locking strategy and variant bi-\nnary exponential back-off\
    \ (beb) messaging model was \nsuggested for stable operation of the construction\
    \ hoist \non site (Yang et al. 2012). In addition, a building electri-\ncal safety\
    \ monitoring system to improve electrical safe-\nty of buildings and increase\
    \ efficiency of power supply  \nunits was proposed (Huang et al. 2011). Slope\
    \ monitor-\ning system (Chang et al. 2013; Kim, Han 2008), irriga-\ntion control\

    \ system \n(Nadimi et al. 2008), and u-healthcare services (Lee et al. \n2009)\
    \ are the examples of Zigbee-based applications.\nThere have been numerous application\
    \ studies fo-\ncused on the advantages of Zigbee, yet there are sev-\neral literatures\
    \ indicating the communication reliability \nissue caused by physical limitation\
    \ of wireless com-\nmunication. Unlike the wired communication network \ntechnologies,\
    \ Zigbee-based wireless network shows low \ndata rate and high bit error ratio.\
    \ Since additional tasks \nof packet transmission and protocol execution are re-\n\
    quired, network efficiency and reliability may decrease \naccording to the data\
    \ transmission algorithm (Sung et al. \n2010). In addition, when a network is\
    \ composed of mul-\ntiple wireless nodes resulting in poor network connec-\ntivity\
    \ owing to various errors, system efficiency will be \ndeclined and deployment\
    \ cost increased (Sung, Yang \n2010). These failures or errors of wireless communica-\n\
    tions occur at construction cases (Xiao et al. 2011; Chae \net al. 2012; Kim et\
    \ al. 2011; Raj, Varghese 2012; Yang \net al. 2012), and it has been pointed out\
    \ that depending \non the reception environment such as the existence of \nconstruction\
    \ obstacles, the received signal strength may \nbe reduced, data packet may be\
    \ lost and the reception \nrate declined.\n2. Experimental configuration\n2.1.\
    \ Hardware setup\nThis study examined the quantitative level of wireless \nsignal\
    \ attenuation in a construction environment. by \nvarying the type and dimensions\
    \ of construction materi-\nals, a field experiment with a 2.4 GHz ZigBee module\
    \ \nwas performed in both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line \nof sight (NLOS) environment.\
    \ For the NLOS environ-\nment, the object samples with typical construction ma-\n\
    terials, e.g. plywood (500×500×20 mm), concrete block \n(300×300×120 mm without\
    \ reinforcement) and steel \nplate (300×300×10 mm), are designed. The receiving\
    \ \nnode connected to a laptop was placed at a fixed point \nto measure the receiving\
    \ signal power, and a transmit-\nting node was moved away from the receiving node\
    \ in \n1 meter increments until the receiving node could not  \nJournal of Civil\
    \ Engineering and Management, 2016, 22(1): 105–117\n107\ndetect any incoming signals\
    \ (Fig. 1). by varying the \nthickness and type of construction materials, the\
    \ trans-\nmitting node periodically sends data  packets with a  \n6 byte payload\
    \ per second until 1,000 data samples are \nmeasured at each unit distance. The\
    \ performance crite-\nria, such as received signal strength index (RSSI), link\
    \ \nquality index (LQI) and packet delivery rate (PDR), were \nmeasured to evaluate\
    \ quantitatively the wireless signal \nattenuation in the obstructed environment.\
    \ In this experi-\nment, Zigbee equipped with a CC2420 radio transmitter \nset\
    \ to a maximum power level, 0 dbm, was used.\n2.2. Software setup\nTinyOS is a\
    \ component-based operating system developed \nfrom the Smart Dust project in\
    \ the University of California at \nberkeley, Intel Research and Crossbow Technology\
    \ targeting \nwireless sensor networks (WSNs). TinyOS provides a free \nand open\
    \ source platform for efficient sharing and updates \nby communities of embedded\
    \ systems and WSNs. The op-\nerating system was optimized for WSN hardware resources:\
    \ \na small compilation size, limited memory, low CPU, low \npower and small size.\
    \ TinyOS resolves the specific challeng-\nes of sensor networks for limited hardware\
    \ resources and \napplication-specific requirements by a range of implemen-\n\
    tations of both operating system services and applications.\nBased on the TinyOS\
    \ specifications, the software \nmodel at the transmitter, receiver, and post\
    \ processes \nwas developed for field experiments. First, a sending \nmodel was\
    \ compiled and constructed on a transmitter \nnode for transmitting a data packet\
    \ that includes node ID,  \nTx_Power, and counter at 1Hz intervals. As is described\
    \ \nin Figure 2, a 1Hz timer was fired to generate periodical-\nly the structure\
    \ of a data packet, where 2 bytes node ID \nand 4 bytes counter variables were\
    \ allocated. Whenever a \ndata packet was generated, a counter value that increased\
    \ \nby one each time was stored on the payload in the data \npacket and sent to\
    \ a receiving node together with the \ntransmission power level and node ID. The\
    \ counter value \nindicates the total number of transmissions and is used \nto\
    \ calculate the packet delivery rate at the receiver side. \nSecond, a receiving\
    \ model was designed to re-\nceive the data packets from the transmitter. Whenever\
    \ \nthe Receive event was activated, the GetPayload inter-\nface was called to\
    \ put the receiving variable to a struc-\nture buffer, and the size of structure\
    \ and pointer address \nwere examined. When the success of packet recep-\ntion\
    \ was confirmed, the event handler was operated to \nmeasure the RSSI and LQI,\
    \ which were defined in the  \nIEEE 802.15.4 specifications, and generated another\
    \ \ncounter that increases the number of packet receptions. \nThe parent’s node\
    \ ID, receiver’s node ID, transmission \ncounter, reception counter, RSSI, LQI,\
    \ and transmission \npower were then stored and carried out through UART \n(Universal\
    \ Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) to a PC. \nFinally, post processing model\
    \ was developed us-\ning Java to analyse the PDR and provide a user-friendly \n\
    interface. When a hex stream of a data packet is received \nthrough UART at a\
    \ PC, the data format was changed \nto decimal format. All the received data,\
    \ including the \ntime stamp, was then written in a user-defined text file \n\
    for further processes or GUI (Graphical User Interface). \nFigure 3 illustrates\
    \ the a sample Java application devel-\noped to plot real-time RSSI data collected\
    \ to base Station \nthrough serial port.\n3. Analysis of wireless signal attenuation\
    \  \nin  obstructed environment\nTo analyse the attenuation effect, a field experiment\
    \ was \nconducted with programmed sensor nodes to measure the \nperformance criteria,\
    \ e.g. RSSI, LQI, and PDR, in a line-\nof-sight environment (extended from bae\
    \ et al. 2013). \nFigure 4 describes the performance criteria along with \nthe\
    \ increasing T-R separation distance. As shown in the \nfigure, RSSI showed strong\
    \ power loss by decreasing \ndrastically at a near-field separation distance of\
    \ up to 20 \nmeters. beyond that, it decreased slowly and converged \nto –90 dbm\
    \ at a T-R separation of up to 80 meters. LQI \nalso decreased with increasing\
    \ separation distance but in \na smooth curve pattern, and 40% LQI was measured\
    \ at an \n80 m separation distance. Similarly, PDR decreased with \nincreasing\
    \ separation distance, but the decreasing rate \nwas much higher in the far-field\
    \ than in the near-field.\nOn the other hand, signal attenuation showed a \ndifferent\
    \ pattern in the obstructed environment where  \nplywood, concrete block, or steel\
    \ plate was placed im-\nmediately behind a receiver blocking the direct line-of-\n\
    sight path of the transmitting signal. Similar to concrete \nmaterial, the dielectric\
    \ constant ranges from 2 to 2.5, and \nthe signal reflected from plywood panel\
    \ reduces a certain \namount of the signal strength at the receiver side due to\
    \ \nenergy absorption. Figure 5 shows the spectrum of RSSI, \nLQI and PDR according\
    \ to the T-R separation distance \nwhen the signal is blocked by a 4 to 20 cm\
    \ thick sheet \nof plywood. basically, the received signal is a function \nof\
    \ the T-R separation distance, which is similar to the \ncase of LOS, but the\
    \ level of attenuation increases with \nincreasing plywood thickness. At the closest\
    \ T-R sepa-\nration, the measured RSSI of 4 cm thick plywood was  \n–52 dbm, e.g.\
    \ more signal loss by 12 dbm than the case \nof LOS. In 20 cm thick plywood, the\
    \ measured RSSI at \nthe closes distance decreased to –62 dbm and the sig-\nnal\
    \ could be detected up to a 53 m T-R separation. LQI \nand PDR showed similar\
    \ pattern to the case of LOS, but \nthe curves began decreasing faster and RF\
    \ coverage de-\ncreased more than the case of LOS.\nFig. 1. experimental setup\n\

    \ that \nabsorbs a certain amount of radio energy, reducing the \nsignal strength\
    \ at the receiver side. When combined \nwith reinforcement, the concrete block\
    \ shows unpre-\ndictable attenuation in signal propagation. In particu-\nlar,\
    \ the thickness of the concrete block becomes larg-\ner than other construction\
    \ materials when used as a \nstructural component. Therefore, the wireless signals\
    \ \npenetrating through the thick concrete show serious \nattenuation in strength.\
    \ This phenomenon is clearly \nobserved in the test results shown in Figure 6,\
    \ where \nthe spectrum of RSSI, LQI and PDR were measured \nby varying the thickness\
    \ of the concrete block from \n12 to 60 cm. The wireless signals penetrating a\
    \ 12 cm \nand 60 cm thick concrete block could travel up to  \nJournal of Civil\

    \ with 12 cm  \nand 60 cm thick concrete blocks showed –45 dbm and \n–65 dbm at\
    \ the closest distance, respectively, which \nthen decreased in a log fashion\
    \ up to approximately \n–90 dbm. The LQI and PDR also decreased much more \nthan\
    \ those in LOS and the level of attenuation increased \nwith increasing thickness\
    \ of the concrete block.\nUnlike dielectric materials, such as plywood and \n\
    concrete, steel is a strong electromagnetic conductor, \nand vast amounts of energy\
    \ are reflected when blocked \nby obstructions, resulting in a serious decrease\
    \ in the \npenetrating wave and signal strength received. To ana-\nlyse the quantitative\
    \ amount of signal attenuation, the \ntest configuration was set in a way that\
    \ a single hop \nwireless communication was blocked by a steel plate \nranging\
    \ in thickness from 1 to 10 cm. Figure 7 shows \neach measurement criterion, indicating\
    \ a serious de-\ncrease in the T-R separation distance, ranging from 50 \nto 10\
    \ m in a 1 and 10 cm thick steel plate, respectively. \nThe LQI and PDR also showed\
    \ sharp and almost lin-\near decreases with increasing T-R separation distance.\
    \ A \ncomparison of the test results measured from a similar \nthickness of objects\
    \ showed that the measurement cri-\nteria in the case of plywood and concrete\
    \ do not differ \nsignificantly. This might be because the dielectric con-\nstant\
    \ of two different materials is similar, ranging from \n2.1 to 2.5. Therefore,\
    \ the attenuation effect of a pen-\netrating signal through the object would be\
    \ similar. On \nthe other hand, the test results of a steel plate showed \nserious\
    \ drops in RSSI, LQI and PDR due to the material \ncharacteristics as a conductor\
    \ that would reflect most of \nthe RF energy.\n4. Quantitative comparison of wireless\
    \  \nsignal attenuation\nThe path loss exponent, n, indicates the rate at which\
    \ the \npath loss increases with increasing T-R separation, de-\npending on the\
    \ specific radio propagation environment, \nsuch as urban areas, obstructions\
    \ in buildings, or obstruc-\ntions in factories. In particular, Seidel and Rappaport\
    \ \n(1992) categorized the parameters of the path loss expo-\nnent according to\
    \ type of office buildings with different \nfloor levels. On the other hand, previous\
    \ studies did not \nfully address the obstruction details, such as the type of\
    \ \nconstruction materials or their thickness. Therefore, it is \ndifficult to\
    \ predict the pure contribution to the signal at-\ntenuation, which is a major\
    \ cause of the attenuation con-\nfusion.\nFigure 8 shows the path loss exponent\
    \ from the \nmeasured signal strength according to the change in \nmaterial and\
    \ thickness by considering detailed ob-\nstruction characteristics. The mean path\
    \ loss of a dif-\nferent  obstruction thickness was measured at a fixed \npoint\
    \ and plotted alongside the T-R separation distance. \nThe straight lines indicate\
    \ the distance-dependent path \nloss with the path loss exponent, n, representing\
    \ the \nFig. 6. Performance measurements in an obstructed \nenvironment (Concrete\

    \ (Table 1). When the path loss exponents \nare compared with the material type,\
    \ plywood and con-\ncrete block were slightly larger than the environment \ncategorized\
    \ as free space, but the steel plate showed the \nlargest path loss exponent,\
    \ even with a relatively thin \nobstruction thickness. This means that the path\
    \ loss from \na reference distance along with the T-R separation dis-\ntance is\
    \ more severe in a steel plate than the other types \nof material.\nThe path loss\
    \ is basically measured by the distribu-\ntion of RSSI and might not represent\
    \ the typical perfor-\nmance of signal attenuation. In this study, the attenuation\
    \ \nindex (AI), as another possible indicator from a cumu-\nlative differential\
    \ dataset, was proposed to analyse the \nreliability of wireless signal quantitatively.\
    \ The cumula-\ntive differential dataset was defined by the normalized \nmeasurement\
    \ of accumulated deviation calculated in each \ninterval of the T-R separation\
    \ distance. In addition, the \nattenuation index (AI) could be defined as the\
    \ value of \nthe linear regression slope obtained from the cumulative \ndifferential\
    \ dataset. When the level of signal obstruction \nis large, the deviation of the\
    \ measurements between ad-\njacent T-R separation points increased, resulting\
    \ in an \nincreased number of attenuation indices. In this way, \nit is possible\
    \ to include both the LQI and PDR, and to \ncompare the level of signal attenuation\

    If yi is defined as the cumulative differential dataset \nat the ith T-R separation,\
    \ numerical formulation to calcu-\nlate yi can be expressed as:\n \n \n(1)\nwhere\
    \ xi is the performance criteria, e.g. RSSI, LQI or \nPDR, at the ith T-R separation\
    \ distance; di is the T-R sep-\naration at the ith location point; and N is the\
    \ total number \nof measurement points. The attenuation index, AI, can be \ncalculated\
    \ from the cumulative differential dataset using \nthe slope of the linear regression\
    \ function.\nFigures 9 and 10 illustrate the normalized cumu-\nlative differential\
    \ dataset of LQI and PDR and their \nlinear regression curves in an obstructed\
    \ environment. \nThe slope of the linear regression curve, AI, increases \nwith\
    \ increasing thickness of the construction material. \nIn particular, the AI of\
    \ a steel plate is generally larger \nthan other dielectric materials in both\
    \ LQI and PDR. \nThis  suggests that a wireless signal penetrating through \n\
    a steel plate reduced the received signal strength and \nsignal reception rate\
    \ more than through the other di-\nelectric materials, indicating a higher deviation\
    \ of \nmeasurements at each T-R separation distance. Table 2 \nlists the slope\
    \ of the linear regression curve, i.e. AIs in \neach test case. Interestingly,\
    \ AIs calculated from a steel \nplate were almost three times higher in RSSI and\

    \ materials when similar thicknesses \nof the materials are compared. On the other\
    \ hand, the \nAIs calculated by LQI from a similar thickness of the \nthree different\
    \ materials are less distinguished. by this \nphenomenon, it could be inferred\
    \ that the performance \ncriterion of RSSI or PDR is more sensitive to external\
    \ \ndisturbances than that of LQI. Although RSSI, LQI, and \nPDR are good indicators\
    \ for evaluating an incoming sig-\nnal, LQI is more like an indicator that measures\
    \ the er-\nror in the incoming modulation of successfully received \npackets (Halder\
    \ et al. 2011). Therefore, RSSI and PDR \nwould be a better fit to assess the\
    \ attenuation effect in a \nsituation where the signal is disturbed from noises\
    \ and \ninterference.\nIf the performance measurement is assumed to be \na continuous\
    \ random variable within its coverage, the \nprobability distribution becomes\
    \ skewed such that the \nprobability that a measurement of RSSI occurs is high-\n\
    er at the lower bound while the probability that LQI or \nPDR occurs is higher\
    \ at the upper bound. By configuring  \nthe shape parameter, i.e. α and β, the\
    \ distribution of the \nperformance criteria can be expressed as the beta dis-\n\
    tribution. Table 3 lists the shape parameter beta with a \nfixed alpha of 2 according\
    \ to the material type and thick-\nness. The beta in each performance measurement\
    \ gener-\nally increases with increasing thickness of each material  \ntype. Therefore,\
    \ it has a good rational for inferring \nthe interference effect from a comparison\
    \ of the shape  \nparameter beta. On the other hand, the increase in beta \ndoes\
    \ not always coincide well with the increase in thick-\nness. Rather, beta gives\
    \ the implication of how much \nthe probability distribution of each measurement\
    \ is bi-\nased due to the material type. If beta >2, the probability \ndensity\
    \ function becomes biased to a lower bound from \na uniform distribution, whereas\
    \ it is biased to an upper \nbound at beta <2. \nThe direction and level of bias\
    \ can be well dem-\nonstrated in a cumulative distribution function (CDF), \n\
    shown in Figure 11. In the case of RSSI, the average \nbeta value was 4.31, 5.50\
    \ and 5.15 in plywood, con-\ncrete block and steel plate, respectively. The CDF\
    \ ap-\npears above the straight line because beta >2, which \nshows that the performance\
    \ measurement of RSSI is \nskewed to a lower bound. The more biased from a \n\
    uniform distribution, e.g. moving to the left direction, \nsuch as a steel plate\
    \ and concrete block, the higher the \nprobability that the RSSI would be observed\
    \ around \nthe lower bound, indicating more interference from the \nobstructions.\
    \ \nOn the other hand, the mean beta value is 1.46, 1.63, \nand 2.15 for LQI and\
    \ 1.31, 1.52, and 1.75 for PDR in \nplywood, concrete block and steel plate, respectively.\
    \ be-\ncause most beta values are less than 2, the CDF appears \nbelow the straight\
    \ line, indicating that the measurements \nare skewed to the upper bound. In both\

    \ thick-\nness of the obstruction are the most critical components \naffecting\
    \ the signal attenuation. The performance criteria, \nsuch as RSSI, LQI and PDR,\
    \ decrease with increasing \nthickness of the materials, but the degree of signal\
    \ at-\ntenuation is correlated with the physical characteristics of \nthe materials.\
    \ Generally, a wireless signal becomes poor \nin both signal strength and link\
    \ quality as the penetrat-\ning thickness increases, and the packet reception\
    \ rate de-\ncreases. In particular, with conducting materials, such as \na steel\
    \ plate, the degree of signal attenuation becomes \nmore serious than with other\
    \ dielectric materials. This \nphenomenon can be observed more quantifiably with\
    \ a \npath loss exponent and attenuation index (AI) in that the \nobstructive\
    \ environment of NLOS has a higher value \nof n and AIs. The attenuation effects\
    \ caused by differ-\nent materials were also observed with a cumulative beta \n\
    distribution. \nIt is concluded that the different characteristics of \nconstruction\
    \ materials may affect the level of reliability \nperformance in wireless communication.\
    \ In particular, \noptimal placement of sensor nodes and network path, \nwhich\
    \ are the critical requirements for successful WSN \nimplementation in civil infrastructure,\
    \ should be carefully \ninvestigated according to the materials type, penetration\
    \ \nthickness, and T-R separation distance. Therefore, the re-\nsults found in\

    Abstract. The farmland crop information is the important foundation of \ndeveloping\
    \ fine agricultural practice. Crop information acquisition technologies \nhave\
    \ become the most effective means to increasing crop production and \nimproving\
    \ crop quality. In this paper, on the basis of introducing the \ncharacteristics\
    \ of farmland crop data, different farmland crop information \nacquisition methods\
    \ are surveyed in detail, sections need to be improved of \nthese methods and\
    \ related core technologies will be discussed. At last, this \npaper gives a table\
    \ about crop information acquisition technology and sensing \ninstrument systems\
    \ applied in different levels (individual level, area level and \nwide-area level).\
    \ \nKeywords: precision agriculture (PA), crop information, information acquisition.\
    \  \n1 \nIntroduction \nAll Food is the paramount necessity of human beings, and\
    \ the essential material basis \nfor any country on the way of development. China\
    \ is a great agricultural country with \nlarge population, limited soil resources\
    \ and traditional manual farming methods. With \nall these challenges, precision\
    \ agriculture (PA) technologies have been used to \nimprove field practices in\
    \ crop production these years. PA provides a way to optimize \nagricultural production\
    \ inputs, such as irrigation, fertilizing and spraying, based on \nfarmland soil,\
    \ environment and crop information at individual areas within a field, \nrather\
    \ than applying uniform inputs across the entire field. In this way people can\
    \ \nobtain not only the best economic benefits but also the ecological benefits.\
    \ \nThe three main components involved in PA are information acquisition, data\
    \ \ninterpretation, and variable-rate application. The PA is an information-based\
    \ \ntechnology. Only spatial information on field conditions as well as inputs\
    \ and outputs \nof the field are accurately collected, can PA be successful [1].\
    \ The technology of \nfarmland information acquisition directly affects the degree\
    \ of agricultural \ninformatization and the accuracy of agricultural production’s\
    \ decisions. How to get \nfield soil, environment and crop information conveniently\
    \ and quickly is the critical \nissue throughout the entire process of PA. Yet\
    \ conventional acquisition method of \nfarmland information, which mainly including\
    \ traditional information retrieval \nmethods and chemical diagnostic methods\
    \ have many limitations. As to be known, \nappearance analysis method has strong\
    \ subjectivity and poor accuracy; chemical \n \nA Survey on Farmland Crop Information\
    \ Acquisition \n207 \n \ndiagnosis is based on laboratory analysis of crop organizations,\
    \ generally requires \nanalyzing samples of crop, costs a lot of time, manpower\
    \ and material resources [2]. \nThe PA requires fast, real-time and positioning\
    \ measurement. As the traditional crop \ninformation acquisition methods cannot\
    \ meet the requirement of variable fertilization, \nwe need to develop new methods,\
    \ especially the technical method and sensing \nequipment can be used for fast\
    \ acquisition of farmland information must be developed \nto meet the need of\
    \ PA research and practice. \nFarmland information can be divided into three parts:\
    \ soil information, \nenvironment information, and crop information [3]. Soil\
    \ information, including soil \nmoisture, pH, organic matter content, conductivity,\
    \ soil nutrients, and soil tillage \nresistance and etc. is the one of the main\
    \ object of studying farmland information. \nFarmland environment information\
    \ includes air temperature, humidity, light intensity, \ncrop pests, and etc.\
    \ Crop information includes crop growth information (such as \ncanopy structure,\
    \ leaf area index, plant height, etc.), crop nutrition information \n(including\
    \ chlorophyll content, crop water status, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium \netc.)\
    \ and some other information. Crop information is the most important index used\
    \ \nin regulating plant growth, diagnosing crop nutrient deficiency, and predicting\
    \ crop \nyields. All these information can make a contribution to agricultural\
    \ land management \nand decision-making. High production, high-efficiency and\
    \ modernizing agriculture \ncan’t become true without the help of all kinds of\
    \ information.  \nIn this paper, on the basis of introducing the characteristics\
    \ of farmland data, \ndifferent farmland crop information acquisition methods\
    \ and related core technologies \nwill be surveyed and discussed. \n2 \nCharacteristic\
    \ of Farmland Crop Information \nIt is extremely important to instruct the agricultural\
    \ production by knowing the crop it \nself’s information. The farmland system\
    \ is a very complicated ecology system, \ninvolves different kinds of factors.\
    \ Even the crop itself is a complicated system. The \ncollecting of crop data\
    \ usually incurs the substantial costs and technologies [4]. To \nunderstand the\
    \ characteristic of crop information fully is very necessary. There are the \n\
    characteristic of farmland crop information. A) Spatiality. The production of\
    \ crop is \nassociated with spatial factors. Every farmland has its own geographic\
    \ location and \nboundaries. Spatial data is usually used in generating different\
    \ maps as coordinates. \nB) Complexity. Any agricultural system has huge factors\
    \ include not only directly \nrelated factors but also indirectly related factors.\
    \ Each factor contains its sub-factors. \nFarmland crop data can be collected\
    \ from multiple sources such as onboard sensors, \nhandheld devices, remote sensing,\
    \ satellite, history material, etc.  Categories of data \nare diverse, including\
    \ text, number, image, sound, video, etc. C) Dynamics. All the \ninformation is\
    \ changing all the time according to the time and space [5]. In-time \nacquisition\
    \ of data is vital for PA. After all, all these factors increase the difficulty\
    \ of \ngetting agricultural crop data. People need to master high-tech and stable\
    \ \nmeasurements or means to shield interference and obtain accurate data. \n\
    208 \nD. Yi and H. Ji \n \n3 \nCrop Information Acquisition Methods \nCrop information\
    \ includes crop growth information, crop nutrition information, and \nsome other\
    \ information. \n3.1 \nCrop Growth Information \nGround observation, remote sensing\
    \ monitoring and model simulation are the main \nmethods of monitor crop growth\
    \ and development information. The leaf area index \n(LAI), canopy characterization,\
    \ canopy structure, plant height and other growth \nfactors are the main target\
    \ be measured to monitor crop-growing status [6].  \nRemote sensing is becoming\
    \ more and more popular for its unique advantages.  \nM. Susan Moran et al. [7]\
    \ successfully used aerial and satellite remote sensing data to \ninverse normalized\
    \ difference vegetation index (NDVI) values, which can be used for \ndiagnosis,\
    \ estimation and production forecasting of large area crops [8]. Huang \nJingfeng\
    \ et al. [9] established Rice-SRS model to estimate the yield of rice with \n\
    spectral normalized vegetation index obtained by NOAA/AVHRR satellite. Peng \n\
    Xiao et al. [10] used the TM remote sensing image to obtain NDVI and inverse the\
    \ \nLAI of rice. On the basis of domestic airborne imaging spectrum data and the\
    \ spectral \nresponse of the synchronous sampling data, Yang Minhua et al [11]\
    \ established wheat \ncanopy physical and chemical parameters estimation model\
    \ and realized the inversion \nof wheat canopy physical and chemical parameters\
    \ through aerial hyper spectral \nremote sensing.  \nInfrared beam, ultrasonic,\
    \ microelectrode constant current source technology and \nsome other technologies\
    \ can be used to monitor and analyze growing crops directly. \nShimizu H et al.\
    \ [12] used machine vision technology to non-contact measure three-\ndimensional\
    \ growth information of crops. Zhao Chunjiang et al. [13] developed an \ninstrument\
    \ to inverse LAI, vegetation cover degree, biomass index to assess crop \ncondition.\
    \ This instrument uses the near-infrared and red characteristic bands, and \n\
    detects the incident light and the reflected light of vegetation to get the NDVI\
    \ \n(normalized difference vegetation index) values. Aziz S A et al. [14] studied\
    \ \nultrasonic sensing technology. They used it as one approach for corn plant\
    \ canopy \ncharacterization. Lan Yubin et al. [15] developed a ground-based Multi-sensor\
    \ fusion \nintegration system, including a crop height sensor, a crop canopy analyzer\
    \ for LAI, a \nNDVI sensor, a multispectral camera, and a hyper spectroradiometer\
    \ to measure real-\ntime crop conditions involve NDVI, biomass, crop canopy structure,\
    \ and crop height. \nQu Yonghua et al. [16] developed an automatic system designed\
    \ on the basis of \nwireless sensors network (WSN) to collect crop structure parameters,\
    \ like LAI and \naverage leaf angle (ALA).  \nPlant height is an important parameter\
    \ to be considered for management decision \nmaking. Plant height is a sensitive\
    \ indicator to show plant health status and calculate \nyield potential in optimizing\
    \ field inputs. Sui Ruixiu et al. [17] used ultrasonic sensors \nto develop a\
    \ microcomputer-based measurement system to allow in-situ, non-\ndestructive measurement\
    \ for the morphological characteristics of bush-type plants. \nSearcy S W et al.\
    \ [18] developed and field-tested an infrared beam sensor mounted on \n \nA Survey\
    \ on Farmland Crop Information Acquisition \n209 \n \na mechanical arm, using\
    \ a “light curtain” for the cotton plant real-time height \nmeasurement. Tumbo\
    \ S D et al. [19] successfully used ultrasonic sensors in the \nmeasurement of\
    \ citrus tree volume. Ehsani M R et al. [20] investigated a laser-based \nsensor\
    \ which can realize real-time estimate of plant volume. The sensor also \nperformed\
    \ well in measuring the biomass and LAI of a plant after being calibrated. \n\
    Jones C L et al. [21] used ultrasonic distance sensing to realize plant height\
    \ data \ncollection, and estimated plant biomass using the product of top-view\
    \ surface area of \nthe plant. Sui Ruixiu et al. [22] used an ultrasonic sensor\
    \ installed on a field vehicle \nsuch as a sprayer to scan the plant canopy and\
    \ determine plant height in real time in \nsitu. A plant height map was generated\
    \ with the collected data by the sensor. \n3.2 \nCrop Nutrition Information \n\

    \ \nhas produced a kind of Chlorophyll meter, which emit red light (about 650nm)\
    \ and \nnear infrared light (about 940nm) by the light emitting diode to the receiver\
    \ through \nthe leaf samples. The receiver receives the signals and transfers\
    \ them into digital \nsignals that will be used by the microprocessor to calculate\
    \ the SPAD value. Yao \nJiansong et al. [23] used visible-near infrared spectroscopy\
    \ techniques to non-\ndestructive test rape leaf chlorophyll content information.\
    \ Liu Fei et al. [24] used \nvisible/near infrared spectrum technology, quickly\
    \ and accurately detected cucumber \nleaf SPAD value, which is helpful to the\
    \ development of testing equipment. \nNitrogen is one of the most important factors\
    \ that have a high impact on the \nproduction of crops. The main methods of monitoring\
    \ nitrogen are remote sensing \nimaging, machine vision technology, spectrum analysis\
    \ technology, Multi-spectral \nand hyperspectral imaging technology [25]. The\
    \ remote sensing based crop nitrogen \nnutrition diagnosis, most people use remote\
    \ sensing to inverse nitrogen concentration, \nnitrogen accumulation and other\
    \ parameters which can determine crop nitrogen \nnutritional status [26]. He Yong\
    \ et al. [2] developed a portable plant nutrients lossless \ntester to determine\
    \ plant chlorophyll, water, nitrogen content quickly, non-destructive, \nand simultaneously.\
    \ This instrument has a GPS and a wireless data transmission \nfunction. Combined\
    \ with GIS software management system, large-scale crop nutrient \ncontent distribution\
    \ map can be developed. Feng lei et al. [27] put the rape as the \nresearch object,\
    \ used computer multi-spectral imaging technology for rapidly, \naccurately and\
    \ non-destructive nitrogen diagnosis. \nCrop water information collection is the\
    \ basis of precision irrigation decision-\nmaking. It is a key for continuously,\
    \ quickly, and precisely information collecting. \nCrop water information is helpful\
    \ to develop advanced and reliable monitoring \nequipment. Crop water status information\
    \ collection technologies of crop individual \ninclude infrared temperature method,\
    \ leaf water potential, spectral method, etc. \nRegional crop water status information\
    \ is mainly obtained through remote sensing \nmethods, including thermal infrared\
    \ remote sensing and microwave remote sensing \nmethods [28]. Ji Haiyan et al.\
    \ [29] used near-infrared spectroscopy, developed a \nliving plant leaves water\
    \ testing instrument which adopts ultra-low-power \nmicroprocessor MSP430 and\
    \ new type of optical frequency conversion chip TSL230, \n210 \nD. Yi and H. Ji\
    \ \n \nenabled field site fast non-destructive testing of crop leaf water content.\
    \ Li \nDongsheng et al. [30] developed the leaf temperature-measuring instrument,\
    \ using \ninfrared thermometry to measure leaf temperature to estimate leaf moisture\
    \ state. \nCanopy temperature relative to ambient air temperature is often used\
    \ to assess \nplant stress caused by moisture deficit or high temperature [31]\
    \ [32]. Continuous \nmeasurement of plant canopy temperature is useful in both\
    \ research and agricultural \nproduction. James R. Mahana et al. [33] studied\
    \ a low-cost infrared sensor based \nwireless temperature monitoring system, assessed\
    \ the system’s reliability and \nstability, and verified the feasibility of low-cost\
    \ infrared temperature measurement \nsystem. O'Shaughnessy et al. [34] developed\
    \ a wireless sensor system comprised \nmainly of infrared thermometer thermocouples\
    \ located on a center pivot lateral and in \nthe field below to monitor crop canopy\
    \ temperatures. Daniel K. Fisher et al. [35] \ndeveloped and constructed a low-cost\
    \ microcontroller based system to monitor the \ntemperature and the water status\
    \ of crop. The system can realize automatic \nmeasurement of canopy temperature,\
    \ soil temperature, air temperature, and soil \nmoisture status in field. It includes\
    \ a digital infrared temperature sensor, choose \nMLX90614 (Melexis. Concord.\
    \ NH) infrared temperature module to get the plant \ncanopy (leaf) temperature.\
    \ The precision of the system is 0.3 degrees Celsius by \nexperiments. \n3.3 \n\
    Others \nCrop yield is the result of many factors, is the important data of the\
    \ variable \nassignment management [36]. Commercialized grain yield monitor systems\
    \ are \nmainly the AFS (advanced farming system) system (CASE IH Corporation,\
    \ U.S.), the \nFieldStar system (AGCO Corporation, British), the Greenstar system\
    \ (JohnDeree \nCorporation, USA), the PF (precision farming) system (AgLeader\
    \ Corporation, USA), \nthe production monitoring system of RDS, etc. All these\
    \ systems are equipped with \nGPS positioning system, can automatically monitor\
    \ crop production and make a crop \nyield map. Cereal production yield monitor\
    \ sensor is the core of these systems, \nincluding the photoelectric volumetric\
    \ flow sensor, the γ-ray impulse flow sensor and \nthe impulse type flow sensor\
    \ [3]. Some portable information collection and \ntransmission systems have combined\
    \ with GPS, GPRS or Zigbee technology, were \nbuilt to obtain pictures, sounds,\
    \ numbers, GPS information or any other data of field \ncrops [37-40].  \n4 \n\
    Discussions and Conclusions \n4.1 \nCrop Information Acquisition \nThere have\
    \ been many associated reports about rapid detection methods and \ninstruments\
    \ of the nitrogen content, chlorophyll content, and moisture content. And \nthere\
    \ are also some reports about detection methods of phosphorus and potassium \n\
    content. But the report about crop trace information is less. This is mainly because\
    \ the \n \nA Survey on Farmland Crop Information Acquisition \n211 \n \nmain crop\
    \ trace information is metal elements based, and their content is low. The \n\
    ordinary sensing technology still not meets the requirements, and the use of spectrum\
    \ \nand spectral imaging technologies doesn’t directly react to metal element\
    \ information. \n4.2 \nThe Core Technologies \n• GPS \nFarmland location information,\
    \ which including latitude, longitude, shape and size \nof farmland, is mainly\
    \ obtained through GPS (global positioning system). GPS \ntechnology is currently\
    \ widely used in agricultural crop information acquisition \nsystems, can be combined\
    \ with crop information to make crop distribution map. \n• Multi-sensor information\
    \ fusion technology \nMulti-sensor information fusion technology is a comprehensive\
    \ automated \ninformation processing technology [41]. The use of real-time multi-sensor\
    \ \ninformation fusion technology has become a new hot spot to simultaneously\
    \ measure \nmultiple parameters [42]. \n• Wireless communication technology \n\
    Wireless communication can be classified as long-distance communication (GSM,\
    \ \nGPRS, etc.) and short-range communications (Bluetooth, Zigbee, RFID, etc.)\
    \ [43]. \nGSM and GPRS, based on mobile communication network, can achieve remote\
    \ \nagricultural information acquisition and monitoring. Wireless sensor networks,\
    \ which \nhas developed in recent years, integrate sensor technology, embedded\
    \ technology, \nmodern networking and wireless communication technology. It can\
    \ achieve real-time \ndata transmission via low-power short-range wireless communications\
    \ technology \n(such as Wifi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, RFID, etc.). Farmland information\
    \ self-organizing \nwireless sensor network system can be established. \n• Multispectral\
    \ / Hyperspectral imaging technology \nAs spectroscopic technique is easily affected\
    \ by soil background, environment, \ncrop canopy structure, the obtained spectrum\
    \ signal is not able to completely react \ncrops truthful information. Multispectral\
    \ and hyperspectral imaging technology can \nmake up for these shortcomings [2].\
    \ The researches about multispectral and \nhyperspectral imaging technology used\
    \ in the crop phosphorus, potassium, and trace \ninformation are less. But there\
    \ are already reports about multi-spectral imaging \ntechnology applied to detect\
    \ the moisture content of crop leaves [44]. We had better \nestablish the quantitative\
    \ relationship between the spectral characteristics and crop \ngrowth/nutrition\
    \ information and develop crop information equipment. \n4.3 \nConclusion \nPA\
    \ is an information-based technology. PA can use crop information in the farmland\
    \ \nto control the arrangement of production inputs, maximize crop profit, and\
    \ minimize \nenvironmental impact. Information acquisition and processing plays\
    \ a very important \nrole in PA. As shown in table 1, after understanding crop\
    \ information acquisition \nmethods, combined with the current situation and development\
    \ trend, a structure \nabout crop information acquisition technology and sensing\
    \ instrument system is \nlisted. \n212 \nD. Yi and H. Ji \n \nTable 1. Crop information\

  analysis: The paper primarily focuses on the security and privacy issues associated
    with IoT and smart farming. In Section III.A, the authors illustrate the risks
    associated with data security and privacy in IoT and smart farming. They elaborate
    on how the various forms of data at different layers of the smart farming ecosystem
    can be subject to different cyberattacks. They also emphasize the challenges associated
    with securing the communication between devices in a smart farming setting, especially
    when it comes to employing cryptography-based solutions on constrained IoT devices.
    Furthermore, they highlight the regulatory and legal frameworks that impact the
    implementation of smart farming technologies, and the need for industry standards
    and legal jargon to quantify cyber risk in smart farming. Although the paper does
    not directly address the specific point mentioned in the review intention regarding
    types of data most applicable to irrigation management and their typical sources,
    it does provide a comprehensive overview of the security and privacy issues associated
    with data in the smart farming ecosystem, which is valuable information for understanding
    the broader context and challenges related to data management in irrigation systems.

    Footnotes Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) and smart computing technologies
    have revolutionized every sphere of 21 st century humans. IoT technologies and
    the data driven services they offer were beyond imagination just a decade ago.
    Now, they surround us and influence a variety of domains such as automobile, smart
    home, healthcare, etc. In particular, the Agriculture and Farming industries have
    also embraced this technological intervention. Smart devices are widely used by
    a range of people from farmers to entrepreneurs. These technologies are used in
    a variety of ways, from finding real-time status of crops and soil moisture content
    to deploying drones to assist with tasks such as applying pesticide spray. However,
    the use of IoT and smart communication technologies introduce a vast exposure
    to cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities in smart farming environments. Such
    cyber attacks have the potential to disrupt the economies of countries that are
    widely dependent on agriculture. In this paper, we present a holistic study on
    security and privacy in a smart farming ecosystem. The paper outlines a multi
    layered architecture relevant to the precision agriculture domain and discusses
    the security and privacy issues in this dynamic and distributed cyber physical
    environment. Further more, the paper elaborates on potential cyber attack scenarios
    and highlights open research challenges and future directions. A Roadmap of Cybersecurity

    I. Introduction and Motivation According to the United Nations (UN), the world
    population is expected to exceed 9 billion people by 2050, growing by almost a
    third of the current population [1], [2]. Such an increase in the population demands
    a boost of almost 70 percent in the food production rate, according to the Food
    and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.1 This rapidly growing population
    also introduces a variety of other problems such as increasing competition and
    exploitation of land, water and other natural resources. These issues present
    an urgent need to reduce the dependence of food system on our environment. Consequently,
    the need for an evolutionary agricultural paradigm to keep up with growing demand
    of food and crop production is necessary to guarantee a sustainable development
    [3]. Smart farming technologies2 and precision agriculture3 [4] are gaining more
    attraction for their potential to fulfill such an increasing demand and meet global
    food supply needs. Smart farming technologies involve integration of technology
    and data driven agriculture applications to increase crop yield and quality of
    food products. There are numerous smart farming use cases [5]–[7] present globally
    indicating the impact of this new paradigm of practicing agriculture. As an example,
    the use of remote sensors placed in the soil for measuring blueberry irrigation
    in Chile has reduced the volume of water used in farming by 70 percent [8]. In
    India, farm data has been used to predict and prevent crop diseases, which reduced
    the risk associated with the failure of crop production [9]. Similar data driven
    approaches have helped fruit farmers in Slovenia effectively fight against pests.4
    Smart farming, however, goes beyond primary production. In fact, it has impacted
    the complete food supply chain, by employing big data analytics to provide useful
    insights about the entire farming process [10] by facilitating real-time operational
    decision making, and revolutionizing existing agriculture business models. Smart
    farming enhances conventional farming practices by introducing on-field smart
    sensors and devices. These sensors and devices work in a synergistic manner to
    provide efficient farming experiences, as well as, an improved crop yield. Although
    beneficial to the productivity of the industry, the use of heterogeneous, internet-connected
    devices has exposed potential cyber attacks and vulnerabilities in the agriculture
    sector. These attacks introduce the ability to remotely control and exploit on-field
    sensors and autonomous vehicles (tractors, aerial vehicles, etc). Potential agricultural
    attacks can create an unsafe and unproductive farming environment. For example,
    exploits that have the ability to destroy an entire field of standing grown crops,
    flood the farmlands, over spray pesticides using smart drones, etc. can cause
    unsafe consumption as well as economic deterioration. Such attacks in a large
    coordinated manner, also referred to as agro-terrorism [11], also have the potential
    of disrupting the economy of an agriculture-dependent nation. A report [12] released
    by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security extensively elaborates various cyber
    threat scenarios in precision agriculture, further emphasizing the need for research
    in this critical domain. The Agriculture industry adds 6.4 percent of the world’s
    economic production with a total of $5,084,800 million.5 Agriculture, food, and
    related industries contributed $1.053 trillion to U.S. gross domestic product
    (GDP) in 2017.6 At the same time, United State’s farms contributed $132.8 billion
    of this sum which is almost 1 percent of GDP. Agriculture contributed 1.2 % to
    the European Union’s (EU) GDP in 2017 whereas EU’s agricultural industry added
    gross value of EUR 188.5 billion in 20177 at a record high. Out of 226 countries,
    nine countries have agriculture sector as the dominant sector in their economy.
    The U.S. food and agriculture system has a total economic impact of $7.06 trillion8
    and one-fourth of the overall jobs in the country are connected to it. Most countries
    globally export agricultural products. As a result, cyber vulnerabilities can
    have a significant impact on global food security. A sophisticated agro-terrorism
    attack on a (large) exporting country like the U.S. could harm the health of millions
    of consumers world-wide. In addition, attacks could reduce confidence on domestic
    consumption and destroy the United State’s status as a trusted food exporter.
    A report released in 2018 by the Council of Economic Advisors,9 “The Cost of Malicious
    Cyber Activity to the U.S. Economy” suggests the agriculture sector as one of
    the 16 critical infrastructure sectors that are important to both the U.S. economy
    and national security for which cyber protection is particularly important. It
    also reported that the agriculture sector experienced 11 cyber incidents in 2016.
    According to the World Health Organization,10 420,000 people die every year from
    food-related illnesses and 600 million people fall ill as a result of food contaminated
    with bacteria, viruses, toxins or chemicals. A cyber attack on the food ecosystem
    targeted at farms, transportation system, or food processing industrial control
    systems (ICSs) may increase these numbers exponentially. Other important industries
    like energy, financial or healthcare have understood the need for resilient infrastructure
    and have hardened their defenses. However, the food and agriculture industry is
    still a low hanging fruit for threat actors. Food Protection and Defense Institute
    (FPDI) at the University of Minnesota has discovered that food industry ICSs may
    be distinctly vulnerable to cyberattacks.11 Food industry operations technology
    personnel, in particular, those responsible for operating and maintaining ICSs,
    are experts trained in food and production safety production and not in cybersecurity.
    This presents a huge gap between employing smart farm technology and securing
    it correctly and persistently. If not continuously monitored, cyber attacks on
    smart agriculture technologies can have grave implications on several stakeholders
    in the ecosystem. These groups include farmers, end consumers, food processing
    industries, agriculture co-operatives, livestock, government agencies and nations
    critically dependent on agriculture. Figure 1, shows an end to end interaction
    among various entities involved in smart farming ecosystem. Physical sensors and
    livestock in the field generate data and receive command operations via user applications.
    These on-farm devices are connected to gateway supported edge nodes, which help
    enable in-farm device communication, filter sensor data and real time agronomy
    analytics. At the same time, data lakes in the cloud hold a large amount of data
    and information including but not limited to, environmental information (e.g.
    soil moisture level and fertility status), monitoring information (e.g. sensors
    and smart machinery status), energy management data, and other sensitive information.
    In terms of security and data privacy, it is needless to say that manipulation
    and leakage of such data, as well as the impairment of physical equipment and
    software systems, can induce serious consequences. FIGURE 1. A model of end-to-end
    interaction between various stakeholders in smart farming. Show All Extensive
    research on secure IoT devices [13]–[15], smart vehicles [16]–[19], drones [20],
    [21], edge cloud [22]–[24], wireless communication [25]–[27] is already available
    and might be extended to the smart farming ecosystem. However, most of the time,
    research is conducted on these technologies without consideration of the environment
    they are used. The dynamic smart farming environment, has unique characteristics
    such as farm equipment, labor sharing, and operational decisions, influenced by
    environmental conditions. Domain specific issues such as like location, user skill
    set, insider threats, generated data, need smart-farming-specific security mechanisms.
    The development of smart farm technologies therefore, demands further research
    before wide adoption in the community. The current state of the art and our review
    (discussed in Section V) on smart farming, demands further research in security
    and privacy aspects of this evolving domain. As the research, on cybersecurity
    for smart farming is in its infancy, our objective in this review is to provide
    a holistic view of cybersecurity developments in smart farming. In this paper,
    we discuss current threats, analyze potential cybersecurity attacks, review the
    existing scattered security research, and summarize open research challenges in
    the smart farming field as illustrated in Figure 2. FIGURE 2. A roadmap of cybersecurity
    research and challenges in smart farming. Show All This paper has the following
    key contributions: It provides an overview of smart farming focused multi-layered
    architecture, highlighting multiple entry points and communication across layers.
    It identifies potential cybersecurity issues in smart farming and illustrates,
    scenario specific cyber attacks, which have been categorized into data, network,
    supply chain, and other common attacks. It presents an extensive evaluation of
    the current cybersecurity research, countermeasures in smart farming, and also
    enlists the focus, contributions and weaknesses of current research works. It
    provides a clear view of the open security research challenges in different areas
    including next generation network security, trustworthy supply chain and compliance,
    adversarial machine learning and AI, and access control, trust and information
    sharing. The remainder of this paper is as follows. Multi-layered architecture
    for smart farming is discussed in Section II. Section III elaborates security
    and privacy issues, whereas Section IV discusses different attacks on the smart
    farming ecosystem including the supply chain side. Existing research and state
    of the art in smart farming security is discussed in Section V. Section VI highlights
    open research challenges and possible approaches to solutions. Finally, Section
    VII draws conclusion to this research paper. SECTION II. Smart Farming Landscape
    & Architecture Figure 3, depicts a multi layer architecture for the smart farming
    ecosystem. The proposed architecture adapts and extends widely discussed IoT and
    Cyber Physical System (CPS) multi-layer architectures [28]–[31]. These architectures
    recognize the use of cloud and edge services, and the infinite capabilities provided
    by them to fully harness the data generated from smart devices at the physical
    layer [32]–[37]. Our smart farming architecture, also reflects different user
    applications which can be envisioned at various layers. It also considers, vast
    amounts of data collected at edge or cloud layers, and highlights the need for
    various multi-cloud or edge-cloud scenarios. Overall the architecture consists
    of four layers: Physical layer, Edge layer, Cloud layer, and Network Communication
    layer. The latter spans across all three previous layers and connect them. FIGURE
    3. Multi layer smart farming architecture. Show All A. Physical Layer The bottom
    layer in the architecture comprises of real physical sensors and gateway devices
    which are spread across agriculture farms or in greenhouse buildings. These devices
    include drones flying in the air, autonomous tractors, sensors embedded in livestock,
    or hub devices installed to provide communication among smart objects or with
    a central cloud. These devices are responsible for data sensing and based on the
    information gathered, help in actuating other devices to realise various smart
    farming use cases. They collect real time information about weather conditions,
    soil moisture level, or cattle’s body temperature, which can be sent to the edge
    or cloud supported intelligent decision making systems to provide recommendations
    and enable automation. For example, data gathered from soil moisture sensing device
    in the field, after getting processed in the edge or cloud, can help in determining
    the amount of water needed at the farm, optimize irrigation schedule and offers
    a convenient experience to the end farmers. B. Edge Layer This layer is near to
    the end-users and end-devices for local real-time computations and decisions.
    It reduces the computation load off the centralized cloud layer and also the network
    load. Edge computing layer consists of multiple edge nodes. Each node represents
    a gateway that include services such as: data capturing, security monitoring and
    detection, prediction and real-time decision support. Data capturing services
    include, data aggregation, filtering, encrypting and encoding of real-time data
    streams. Prediction services usually rely on machine learning models trained on
    the central cloud and deployed on the edge layer. They are used to predict and/or
    categorize certain events related to plant or livestock such as, prediction of
    crop yield, categorization of plants or livestock health, predictions about the
    amount of fertilizer and water needed for a patch of land, so as to maximize yield,
    or estimating soil erosion. Security monitoring and detection mechanisms can be
    deployed for real-time monitoring of anomalous events and classifying these events
    as malicious or benign. This includes services like, anomaly detection and device
    failures prediction. C. Cloud Layer Precision Agriculture (PA) and cloud computing
    paradigms offer advances to enhance PA connectivity. The cloud layer is generally
    virtualized in data centers and communicates with the other layers using the Internet.
    Generally, these cloud layer platforms follow the Platform as a Service (PaaS)
    architecture model where the users can focus on running applications and importing
    their data. The PaaS provider runs and maintains a data broker that collects data
    being pushed in from the edge layer and saves these records in a Distributed File
    System (DFS). This stored data is used by analytic software to mine knowledge.
    This data analytics component computes insights and these are pushed to the end
    user through a client application running on the users’ machine. Popular farm
    equipment manufacturers like, John Deere,12 Farmers Business Network,13 etc. have
    created several cloud based products that help users monitor various sensors and
    vehicles used on a farm. These PaaS systems generally run on popular cloud computing
    platforms like Amazon Web Services,14 Google Cloud,15 etc. The way these farming
    PaaS systems are built using these popular cloud computing platforms also introduce
    various security challenges in smart farming ecosystem. D. Network Communication
    Layer The common theme for most, if not all, current technologies is “connectivity”.
    With a growing need for a boundary-less Internet, the idea of a network of smart
    devices has become a reality. This concept, known as the Internet of Things (IoT),
    allows connected devices to be monitored, controlled, and shared data among each
    other. This data can be analyzed and used by multiple applications. In smart farming,
    as shown in Figure 3, the network layer not only facilitates edge and physical
    layer connectivity, but also provides an interface for them to interact with the
    cloud layer. From exchanging soil temperature through a peer-to-peer sensor communication
    system, to sending farm monitoring data to the cloud data stores through high
    speed mobile networks such as 5G [38], or updating the farmer about corp quality
    via a wireless adhoc topology [39], network layer offers a means of communication
    to bind all other layers. Network layer has two main responsibilities in a smart
    farming system. Firstly, there are diverse set of heterogeneous devices in every
    layers of a smart farming system. The network layer provides a secure and efficient
    network stack where, wire, wireless and mobile sub-networks can communicate in
    a compatible and cross-layer manner. The second responsibility of the layer is
    to preserve connectivity and therefore, increase availability. From bigdata processing
    systems used to analyze collected data to individual sensors that collect information
    from the field, this layer is needed for system-wide cyber communication. Real
    World Smart Farming Use Cases: The proposed smart farming architecture is constructed
    based on multiple literature and real world smart farming use cases. It can be
    viewed as a general smart farming architecture that satisfies most of the use
    cases. However, it should be noted that not all use cases will include all four
    layers as proposed in the architecture. Blackhills Farm in New Zealand, a 400-hectare
    property with over 2000 cattle and 800 sheep, has adopted the use of SCADAfarm16
    system which allows the owners to remotely monitor water and energy consumption,
    location of irrigators, soil moisture measurements and real-time weather information.
    The farm uses Schneider Electrics’s EcoStuxture IoT architecture17 which corresponds
    to our physical layer and sensors. It also utilizes Microsoft Azure18 IoT suite
    with communication provided by the Vodafone New Zealand cellular network which
    corresponds to the cloud and network layer in out framework. Similarly, a 7,000-acre
    farm at Beltsville Area Research Center, was developed by the United States Department
    of Agriculture (USDA) to act as a testbed for smart farming technologies. The
    farm was equipped with a physical layer including sensors, drones and IoT-enabled
    farm equipment for a public-private program called Farmbeats [5]. The farm adopts
    a two-layer hybrid network: a layer based on TV White Spaces [40] technology for
    connectivity over long range which connects the farmer’s home Internet connection
    to IoT base stations on the farm, and a layer based on Wi-Fi technology which
    connects smart sensors to the IoT base stations. Such IoT base stations (gateways)
    are equivalent to the edge cloud layer (Figure 3) in our proposed general architecture.
    Additionally, the data collected at the IoT stations are pushed to the cloud layer
    which employs AI algorithms for data analysis. Another usecase is a revolutionary
    step towards smart crop health monitoring. A group of researchers19 along with
    local farmers are developing a distributed airborne monitoring system to detect
    possible zones of crop damage or nutrient deficiency at a 492-acre farm in in
    North Carolina, United States. In order to accommodate rapidly-growing food demands
    and increase the quality and quantity of agricultural production, it is necessary
    to improve farming management practices and technological developments in agricultural
    fields. Accordingly, unlike traditional crop management methods that use farmers
    or ground vehicles for assessing crop health status, this collaborative smart
    farming project is using autonomous technology to perform aerial monitoring of
    agricultural fields to save time and money, while preventing damage to crops.
    In this project, a group of drones which monitor the field are working in the
    physical layer, as depicted in Figure 3. Drones communicate with each other through
    network layer, using which they also send collected data and images to land processing
    bases (i.e. the edge layer in our proposed architecture) for initial data cleaning
    and pre-processing. Finally, pre-processed data is sent to the cloud layer for
    storing and knowledge extraction functionalities. SECTION III. Security & Privacy
    Issues The adoption of sensor based technologies and cloud supported smart applications
    in agriculture has unleashed opportunities for adversaries to orchestrate cyber
    attacks. Therefore, it is important to first understand major security and privacy
    issues in smart farming domain before discussing specific cyber attacks. In this
    section, we will elaborate these issues in detail followed by attacks in the following
    section. A. Data Security & Privacy In a smart farm, an enormous amount of complex,
    dynamic and spatial data gets generated from many heterogeneous sensors, devices
    and equipment. Leakage of such information either through unauthorized access
    or by an insider can cause potential threats. For example, leakage of agriculture
    anti-jamming devices information can help an attacker bypass these security measures,
    while leakage of soil, crop, and agriculture purchase information can cause severe
    economic losses to farmers, if such information is used by competitors or hostile
    actors. On a larger scale, aggregating important agricultural information on a
    particular country is also a potential threat. As such data security and privacy
    is a very important requirement and one of the primary objectives to ensure the
    reliable operation in a smart farming ecosystem. Data on the Edge: Smart farms
    leverage Internet of Things (IoT), state-of-the-art communications (e.g., 5G),
    and artificial intelligence. Such systems mostly require fast response times,
    than those of a traditional model in which data is transmitted to a centralized
    data center (e.g., cloud) for processing and results are returned to a user. As
    such, the need of edge cloud is on the rise. Although moving data processing and
    analytics to the edge enhances agility and efficiency, to say the least, it also
    imposes huge security risks due to the increased attack surface primarily because
    of the highly diverse use of IoT devices which are usually not built with security
    in mind. This gives attackers an easy entry point to the network since remote
    access to the edge layer, in most cases, is essential. Additionally, finding the
    IP addresses of edge endpoints become an easy task especially when considering
    websites like Shodan,20 a search engine for all IoT connected devices. Beside
    directly compromising IoT devices or edge endpoints to gain access to the smart
    farm network, an indirect attack to compromise third parties is also a potential
    risk. As an example, smart farms often use third party agronomy analytics to analyze
    the collected data which can be used in many research areas such as plant biology
    and genetics, agriculture economy, supply forecasts, and disease predictions.
    Those parties might be given direct access to smart farm data on the edge for
    real-time analytics. An attacker might phish for such third parties, compromise
    their systems and inject malicious software to redirect the data sent to external
    servers for data theft. Such attacks are very hard to detect, since attackers
    are using legitimate stolen third party credentials. B. Authorization & Trust
    In smart farming applications, connected entities including autonomous tractors,
    flying drones, on field sensors etc. communicate and interact with each other,
    and issue command and control operations to provide automated and efficient experience.
    Such communication can be direct machine to machine or via a cloud or edge assisted
    network which can support Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT21), Constrained
    Application Protocol (CoAP22) or other IoT communication protocols. In either
    case, it is essential to ensure that the messages are sent from a trusted authorized
    entity, rather from a malicious adversary. This exchange of information, like
    moisture level of soil, information about crop yield, cost of fertilizer, or sensitive
    data about the livestock like health, current location, breeding decision information
    and other farm related private data sent to the cloud or to a third-party application
    must be authorized by the owner of the field or a concerned party. Livestock are
    important part of agriculture, and a big component of a farmer’s income. Sensors
    can be embedded in the cattle [41]–[43] which can monitor their health and can
    be used to remotely inject medicines or enable preventive actions from a doctor.
    Even in case of livestock purchase, buyer can be given temporary access to the
    data of an animal they are interested in, which can help them analyse it before
    purchase. As these animals are kept in monitored environments, remotely controlling
    the temperature or making adverse conditions in barn can affect the yield of animals,
    and can also result in epidemics and widespread disease. Over the air (OTA) updates
    for the equipment’s firmware must be from a trusted party, a bad software patch
    received for a critical agriculture equipment can curtail a farmer from using
    it at the needed time of harvesting and planting. Cross cloud and multi cloud
    trust models [44], [45] are needed when entities associated at different cloud
    providers interact and access data remotely. In case of a mechanic trying to diagnose
    an engine of an autonomous tractor, or a doctor trying to access data of a cattle
    located in a private cloud, trust levels need to be established so as to enable
    such access. Several access control models have been proposed for IoT [46]–[58]
    like systems, however their feasability in dynamic smart farming is still to be
    investigated. Proper authorization is needed for a farmer to issue a command,
    to a smart water sprinkler, or to fetch the latest readings from a soil moisture
    sensor. Farm rivalry can exploit such connectivity to the sensors, and may flood
    a farmer’s field, or make it parched. Usually in farms, labor is hired on a temporary
    basis mostly at the time of harvesting and sowing, therefore, temporary access
    to smart equipment can be delegated to on field workers for non-critical operations.
    It may be the case that a critical operation, like running an autonomous tractor
    on the field, or flying a drone over the field to spray pesticides may need multi
    level authorization. C. Authentication & Secure Communication One of the most
    important aspects of security and privacy in smart farming is authentication of
    connected devices. Devices need to be authenticated first in order to get connected
    to various services on a smart farming system. They are usually low power devices,
    with limited processing power, memory, and storage, so legacy public-key infrastructure
    (PKI) authentication mechanisms cannot be considered as feasible solutions. Alternatively,
    secure lightweight multi-factor authentication protocols which are offered as
    a service [13], [59] are more realistic solutions in a smart farming network environment.
    In fact, an intermediary Certifying Authority (CA) can facilitate the authentication
    of a connecting device [60]. Such authentication mechanisms do not consume devices’
    limited resources for authentication processing, but also unauthorized devices
    will be prevented from connecting and accessing the network in an efficient way
    [61]. Moreover, devices may sometime join or leave different layers of a smart
    farming ecosystem. This entails dynamic authenticated mechanisms that apply authentication
    on demand to ensure that only legitimate devices are allowed to have access to
    different services spanning over different layers. Providing end to end secure
    communication in a smart farming setting requires securing the communication between
    devices in a particular layer and also securing the inter-layer communication
    [62]. While cryptography-based solutions prove their effectiveness in securing
    both intra-layer and inter-layer communications, employing them on constrained
    IoT devices is a big concern. There are, however, limited attempts to apply lightweight
    cryptography solutions to a smart farming ecosystem [14]. Additionally, quantum-based
    cryptography for a secure end to end communication for IoT devices is under active
    investigation [63] as a futuristic solution. However, the feasibility of such
    solutions have not been evaluated in real world scenarios. D. Compliance and Regulations
    Smart farming and precision agriculture raises various legal issues, which remain
    partially unanswered. The following are some of the major issues in this area.
    1) Contracts and Agreements A smart farm involves different parties like the farmers,
    the cloud service providers, the networking infrastructure providers, to name
    a few (See Section II). These different parties need to negotiate and agree on
    various parts of contracts [12], [64]. These contracts include data privacy, security
    and intellectual property protection clauses. Data protection is essential for
    the development of smart farms and is a major part of these contracts. Such contracts
    between interested parties are crucial to protect the value and confidentiality
    of the data as an important asset. Farmers who use smart farming tools also need
    to negotiate in advance finer elements of these contracts. For example, which
    party shall be responsible in case data processing and analysis lead to wrong
    decisions affecting different downstream tasks in the pipeline. Another important
    contractual element example is the decision involving use of self-driving tractors,
    which are subject to the set of obligations applicable to self-driving cars. In
    this scenario, strong compensation and limitation of liability clauses may help
    the farmers. 2) Data Security and Privacy Farmers who deploy smart infrastructure
    fear that their data might be stolen by competitors or be publicly released. Hence,
    data security is crucial and agreements with technology providers should include
    specific clauses. Although most smart farming techniques process non-personal
    data, linking of such information to a particular personally identifiable information
    (PII) poses serious concerns [12], [64]. For example, data of livestock directly
    referring to their owner; crops conditions linked to farmers’ personal details.
    In this case, privacy clauses should be included to prohibit personal data processing
    to a certain degree. Further issues may arise when smart farming equipment, such
    as drones or tractors, have the functionality to monitor their users [12], [64].
    3) Intellectual Property (IP) An important question from a compliance perspective
    is who owns the data collected on a smart farm. This is specially important as
    data privacy laws cannot solve this issue. As per the current regulatory setup,
    data itself cannot be protected, however copyright provisions can be utilized
    to achieve high level of safeguards. Most farmers include IP protection clauses
    [64] in contracts that they create with smart farming technology providers [12].
    4) Regulatory Agriculture and livestock production is a highly regulated industry.
    Various countries across the globe have many laws, regulations, and supervisory
    authorities [65]–[67]. These touch upon specific compliance requirements for producing
    and selling of products. Such compliance can be achieved easier by using smart
    farming technology that help farmers and regulators track, audit, and inspect
    every step of the production pipeline. 5) Cyber Insurance Cyber Insurance allows
    victims to protect themselves from various cyber risks. However, cyber insurance
    policies in agriculture have lagged in the coverage of cyber incidents and events.
    Most of the current available agriculture based cyber insurances are very ambiguous
    and limited in their coverage [64]. SECTION IV. Smart Farming Ecosystem Cyber
    Attacks This section elaborates possible cyber attacks in smart farming ecosystem.
    We have categorized attacks into four different classes as shown in Figure 4.
    We have discussed data specific and network specific attacks orchestrated on smart
    farms including IoT based farming sensors. We have also explored cyber attacks
    from the supply chain side to highlight the vulnerabilities as more and more systems
    get connected to the internet and generating sensitive data. FIGURE 4. Smart farming
    ecosystem cyber attacks. Show All A. Data Attacks 1) Insider Data Leakage Farmers
    fear leakage of confidential data the most among other threats as it can be used
    against them in the commodity market. An insider (like a disgruntled employee)
    can leak such data to intentionally cause harm or sell data for money. For example,
    a former engineer at Allen and Hoshall was able to access the company’s data over
    a period of two years.23 Data this employee accessed included engineering schematic,
    project proposals, and marketing information which had an estimated value of $500,000.
    2) Cloud Data Leakage Smart farming data is very sensitive and can reveal a lot
    of confidential agriculture and economic information about the entire country.
    Cloud data centers are distributed across the world and, in some instances, virtual
    machines might be placed in data centers located in different countries. Data
    might be less secure if it is stored in data centers in other countries. These
    countries could place less strict security requirements on companies. Additionally,
    their governments might also intercept or collect that data stored on servers
    within their own jurisdictions. For these reasons, countries have started adding
    laws for sensitive data localization. For instance, China has placed a new cybersecurity
    law24 into effect in 2017 stating, among other things, that personal data must
    be stored on domestic servers. As such, companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon
    started taking steps to transfer control of Chinese data to Chinese firms. 3)
    False Data Injection Attack In this attack, an attacker attempts to change/falsify
    data that contributes to important real-time decisions, with the assumption that
    adversary has the knowledge of the system and its configuration. For example,
    injecting false information about the soil moisture level will result in over
    watering and, in turn, damaging the crops. 4) Misinformation Attack In this attack,
    the aim is to endanger data integrity. An attacker may release false data about
    a smart farm claiming the outbreak of a disease in crops or livestock. Such false
    data reports mimic the form of an actual report released by the targeted smart
    farm. As a result, it will take a lot of time, effort and money to prove that
    the released report is false. B. Networking and Equipment Attacks 1) Radio Frequency
    (FR) Jamming Attack In many cases, smart farming equipment rely on radio frequency
    communication, like cellular or satellite networks. A smart farming equipment
    often use global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) to improve efficiency with
    products and techniques such as path planning, auto steering, seeding and spray
    rates. GNSS is achieved by combining GPS with real time kinematics (RTK) technology
    to enhance the precision of real-time position data. Attackers may jam GNSS for
    malicious purpose by deploying many distributed low power jammers to disrupt GNSS
    over wide areas and, in turn, prevent smart farming equipment from functioning
    properly. 2) Malware Injection Attack One of the most prevalent threats to smart
    farming is malware injection attack [68], where an attacker injects a malware
    into a connected smart device. Malware is a very common threat in large scale
    systems since, in most cases, it acts and propagates through the system automatically,
    hence making it a very attractive target to attackers. Precision agriculture is
    being adopted widely, meaning that more farms are connected to the internet. Typically,
    most of these farm deployments use similar software components (e.g., usage of
    LoRa25 and ZigBee26). As a result, a malware that infects a particular smart farm
    will most likely infect other farms with similar deployments. The damage caused
    by malware comes in many shapes and types. Malware can steal information about
    the consumption of agricultural materials, purchase information of fruits, vegetables
    and livestock, data about agricultural machinery etc. It can also recruit smart
    devices as part of a botnet which will be used for committing malicious acts controlled
    by an attacker. Further, malware can hinder the functions of physical smart equipment
    which, in turn, can have a devastating effect on a particular crop harvest or
    farm area. 3) Denial of Service Attack IoT devices used in smart farming environments
    can always be used to launch large scale denial of service (DoS) attacks [69]
    similar to what happened in 2016 using Mirai botnet [70]. In that occasion, an
    army of dummy CCTVs was exploited to launch one of the biggest DoS attacks that
    happened recently. There are usually a large number of inter-connected nodes and
    groups in a farm, and thus, similar type of attacks are possible in context of
    smart farming. These attacks not only can disrupt normal functions of different
    modules in an individual farm but also can be leveraged to interrupt legitimate
    cyber services in other domains. 4) Botnet With IoT everything is capable of getting
    connected to the internet. In smart farming ecosystem, there are many IoT related
    devices at each architectural layer. These devices are prone to attacks and can
    then be controlled by a central malicious system. This forms a so called ‘Botnet
    of Things’ [71]. A zombie army of infected farm IoT devices [72] can easily be
    used to infect many other networks through different mediums and hence a smart
    farm may turn out to be an internet of vulnerabilities for cyber criminals. Smart
    farm devices are not built with security as a concern and even if they do, users
    usually neglect the basic steps of setting adequate cybersecurity defense mechanisms.
    5) Side Channel Attack Attacks which have their roots in gaining information from
    how a system is implemented rather than what weakness exists in the system implementation
    are called side channel attacks. Smart farming is one of the IoT use case and
    hence it inherits some common IoT vulnerabilities including side channel attacks
    [73]. In such attacks, there are different channels which can be exploited by
    attackers. In timing channel attacks, for example, computation time along with
    cache miss and cache hit timing patterns are among those attacks vectors which
    can be exploited by adversaries. Hardware glitching in forms of voltage fluctuations
    and variances in system clock period during execution tasks are other possible
    attack channels. Other channels for launching a successful attack are power consumption
    patterns, possible electromagnetic leaks or even sound and acoustic channels.
    C. Supply Chain Attacks The entire agriculture ecosystem and the notion of ‘farm
    to plate’ involves several entities which work in tandem to provide quality food
    to the end consumer in a just-in time environment. This supply chain system [74]
    starts from the farm, which produces raw material that, in turn, is stored and
    processed by the food industry. The processed food is packed and sent to distribution
    retailer from where the end customer purchases processed goods. With IoT technology
    at each stage of the supply chain, it introduces potential cybersecurity threats
    since a security breach in just-in-time distribution system could also have a
    serious cascading effects on the entire supply chain. The massive scale of attacks
    like WannaCry27 ransomware, and the recent spate of ransomwares in cities28 across
    the US, suggest that even a breach or data freeze at a single inter-dependent
    entity will be enough to disrupt the whole chain and possibly the economy of a
    country. An attack on the agriculture equipment and fertilizer provider companies
    could potentially disable critical connected machinery needed at a prime time.
    It could manipulate the amount of nutrients in the fertilizers [64] which could
    seriously destroy the crops rather than nourishing them. The smart devices can
    be infected by malware which are controlled and commanded remotely. In such a
    scenario, large scale attacks can be orchestrated on all the smart farms utilizing
    those compromised machinery resulting in massive disruption in the sector. Needless
    to say that the suppliers of such machinery might loose trust and confidence of
    their customers. Such smart machinery needs dynamic calibration to determine the
    distance at which seeds need to be planted or the amount of fertilizers to be
    sprayed based on historical crop data. This calibration related information is
    uploaded in the machine software over-the-air (OTA), which suggests that deliberate
    uploading of false information to the machine software can have larger scale impact.
    US Foods29 has more than 250,000 customers which purchase supplies, will be affected
    badly if US Foods IT infrastructure is hit by a ransomware or a cyber attack disrupting
    its computer assisted facility and impacting critical processes. Temperature and
    conditions under which the produce is transferred is an important factor to maintain
    the freshness of the product. Smart monitors ensure that products are processed
    and packed at appropriate temperatures. Adversaries can manipulate these sensor
    readings or issue a command to change the temperature that could result in inappropriate
    temperature conditions for produce, which can impact the end consumers as well
    as the entire supply chain. These attacks are not limited to direct stakeholders,
    but for example, contaminated water from a compromised water treatment facility
    used in irrigation can destroy the whole crop field. Even attacks on smart grid
    due to sudden surge in demand and grid overloading can result in blackout which
    in-turn can spoil the stored produce in large storage houses, inducing huge losses
    to the supplier. Blockchain30 based solutions have been proposed to ensure the
    provenance of the food products in the chain, which offers transparency and assure
    quality of the food. However, the entire cost to use this system will not be clear
    unless widely adopted [75]. Smart farming goes beyond agriculture where livestock
    sector is also considered an important part. An attack on this sector can also
    have massive disruptions, where a malicious actor can publish false data about
    a disease outbreaks or unapproved genetic modifications of crops. Similarly, sensors
    and smart devices in the buildings where these livestock are kept can be attacked
    or altered to change the temperature, which can put to harm the entire livestock
    on the farm. Also, for livestock feed products, if an IT system monitoring the
    ingredients of the feed is compromised, it can potentially lead to wide-spread
    contamination in livestock which can easily reach humans as well. D. Other Relevant
    Attacks 1) Compliance and Regulation Food production and farming are a highly
    regulated industry with different countries having multiple national agencies
    monitoring food production. In the United States, Environment Protection Agency
    [65] and the Department of Agriculture [66] enforce various regulations and industry
    standards. In the European Union, Department of Agriculture and Rural Development
    [67] undertakes this responsibility with similar authorities in other countries.
    These federal authorities issue compliance directives to ensure quality food production.
    With the advent of smart farming technology these agencies are relying more and
    more on data produced by farm based sensors. An adversary attacking a smart farm
    can specifically inject false data that will then impact various compliance certification
    processes. This certification process if invalidated, can impact a nation’s food
    supply, affect crop price, etc. The complex smart farming ecosystem, creates a
    broad attack surface that needs to be protected to ensure data integrity. 2) Cyber
    Terrorism The increased use of digital interconnected system in agriculture sector
    brings new opportunities for terrorists to attack places that previously were
    too remote or difficult to strike. Cyber terrorism is a relatively low-cost venture
    with high payoff potential, making the risks of agro-terrorism too large to ignore.
    Therefore, it is important to find solutions that guarantee trust and transparency
    within smart farming concept, as well as protect critical resources. 3) Cloud
    Computing Attacks Cloud is a very diverse, decentralized, heterogeneous and powerful
    ecosystem. The enormous amount of distributed resources make the cloud a hard
    target. However, with the introduction of new cloud concepts (e.g., on-demand
    services, auto-scaling, and self provisioning), attackers have used such resources
    in their favor and, in turn, cloud has become one of the most desirable targets
    to attacker. For example, with the introduction of auto-scaling in cloud, a large
    part of the virtual machines hosted on cloud are similarly configured. If one
    of the virtual machines is vulnerable, it is highly likely that all auto-scaled
    virtual machines are vulnerable as well. As such, a malware that infected one
    virtual machine can propagate to other virtual machines quickly. The infected
    machines can be employed as a part of global botnets which, consequently, can
    be used to launch a large scale distribute DoS (DDoS) attacks enough to hinder
    the functionality of cloud. For example, in 2018, a large scale DDoS attack was
    launched on github resulting in a record-breaking sudden traffic increase to 1.35
    terabits per second. Inevitably, DDoS attacks are becoming more frequent, more
    powerful and more sophisticated. A large scale DDoS attack with an overwhelming
    number of requests, packets or messages can deny services to smart farms, thereby
    paralyzing the brain of smart farms. Further, DDoS attacks might not be specifically
    targeting smart farms’ virtual machines. Even though, an attack might be directed
    at a different target, if virtual machines used by smart farms are on the save
    physical server, it will naturally block off other’s traffic as well. SECTION
    V. Existing Research Table 1 summarizes state-of-the-art research, challenges
    and contributions with respect to security and privacy issues in smart farming.
    We have categorized the literature into different subsections based on the focus
    areas they address. TABLE 1 Projects and Research Addressing Cybersecurity in
    Smart Farming A. Cyber Attacks, Threats and Proposed Solutions Researchers and
    federal agencies have started gauging the impact cyber-attacks as more and more
    farmers and communities are adopting technologies in the farms. The U.S. Department
    for Homeland Security released a report [12] which emphasizes the importance of
    precision agriculture (PA) and associated cybersecurity threat and potential vulnerabilities.
    The report highlights the confidentiality, integrity, and availability model of
    information security in farming. It defines different technologies involved in
    PA including in-farm devices, location and remote sensing technologies, machine
    learning, etc. It briefly discusses the impacted groups by the misuse of technologies
    in farming including farmers, livestock producers, and also industries that support
    or rely on agriculture. This report also discusses hypothetical threat scenarios
    on real life examples. Another promising work [76] highlights the vulnerabilities
    and risks due to introduction of technologies in the field of precision agriculture.
    This thesis work illustrates data collection and related empirical study, however
    falls short of security solutions in the domain. The work from Jahn [64] discuss
    implications of using smart devices in the agriculture sector. The authors make
    strong argument about how the lack of a cyber insurance framework is going to
    have a big impact on various agribusinesses. They also highlight the fact that
    a regulatory response is needed to protect the interests of farmers who adopt
    the use of smart devices. Barreto and Amaral [77] use empirical methodology based
    on the analysis of information and experiences collected in the Internet Security
    Alliance,31 the European Cyber Security Organization32 and the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology33 to highlight security challenges in smart farming.
    Some major threats discussed include security and privacy issues, social engineering,
    denial of service, cyber-espionage agroterrorism, ransomware etc. The research
    also highlights a security framework to enable farmers to better understand security
    implications. However, the paper is unable to discuss open research issues, and
    challenges to secure the environment without evidence of how the discussed attacks
    are orchestrated in the domain. Peer to Peer (P2P) is a network paradigm which
    has use cases in smart farming communication. The device authentication methods
    in this type of communication, however, rely heavily on public key infrastructure.
    Although the system is trustworthy, it puts unnecessary computation load on resource
    constrained smart farm IoT devices participating in a secure P2P communication.
    Accordingly, authors in [78] proposed a lightweight device authentication solution
    in which session keys and public keys are combined to expedite the encryption/decryption
    tasks. It results in a fast and light-weight authentication solution which is
    a good fit for smart farming communication purposes. Additionally, West [79] introduced
    a framework to understand vulnerabilities in emerging technologies and the use
    of such technologies in a smart-farming-specific environment. The framework goal
    is to quantify the degree to which the use of smart farming new technologies are
    vulnerable to cyber-attacks. It uses the common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS)
    for the threat prediction model assessment. The work shows the trade-offs between
    technology maturity and adaptation in the smart farming environment which can
    lead to system compromise. The approach in the paper uses three parameters: basic
    parameters, temporal parameters and environmental parameters for constructing
    a CVSS score. Basic parameters indicate the intrinsic and severity of a vulnerability,
    whereas temporal parameters indicate how a vulnerability might change and affect
    the system over time due to technical changes. Environmental parameters reflect
    the specifications of a vulnerability present in a smart-farming-specific environment.
    Although CVSS score has become a standard in the industry for understanding the
    severity of vulnerabilities and prioritizing their patches, it has some shortcomings.
    Smart farming is a diverse environment with many connected devices and systems.
    CVSS score deals with individual vulnerabilities and fails to accurately capture
    impact of connections within the entire system. B. Blockchain Related Research
    Recently, the usefulness of blockchain in domains other than cryptocurrency and
    financial transactions has been acknowledged [93]–[95]. Agriculture and food supply
    chain is one of the domains in which blockchain technology has shown its capabilities.
    Accordingly, the authors in [81] study overall implications, challenges and potential
    of existing blockchain-based projects in the field. Besides, it critically reviews
    maturity of such projects and elaborates on possible barriers and challenges,
    which hinder acceptability of such projects among farmers and existing cyber farming
    systems. Lin et al. [80] also focused on the use of blockchain technology for
    food safety. Authors created a system that tracks and monitors food production
    cycle, including the processes of raw materials, cultivation/breeding, processing,
    transporting, warehousing, and selling. The system also uses various IoT based
    sensors to replace manual recording and verification with sensor based verification.
    Other works [82], [84], [96] focused on providing case studies of using blockchain
    and smart contracts in smart farming. Awan et al. [82] proposed a framework based
    on IoT and blockchain technology for agriculture product tracking life cycle.
    They used smart contracts to eliminate the involvement of middlemen or third-party
    intermediaries and as such increase credibility and trust. The authors implemented
    a use case based on their proposed framework which included 120 IoT nodes and
    20 blockchain producers. Further, they validated their system based on it’s throughput
    considering different block sizes. However, this work has several drawbacks. Very
    few related works are included and comparison to other works in the literature
    is lacking. Additionally, the authors didn’t include much details about the nature
    of workload used in their experiments and they failed to add a baseline benchmark
    for the validation results for a fair comparison. Patil et al. [84] proposed a
    light-weight security framework for smart greenhouse farms based on blockchain.
    Every IoT node can elect cluster head leader which helps preventing a single point
    of failure in case an attacker targets the leader node. Additionally, the authors
    provided discussion of the security threats on their proposed framework following
    the traditional confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA) triad model
    as well as their corresponding attacks. Although, this work is interesting, the
    framework is conceptual with no implementation or experiments. Further, the paper
    didn’t include related work nor a comparison to other proposed frameworks. Besides
    proposing blockchain-based frameworks and implementations [97], real world use
    cases of blockchain in smart farming are discussed in the blockchain research
    institute article [83]. In this work, authors explore applications of blockchain
    beyond the typical financial use cases in agriculture. Accordingly, they focused
    on three classes of applications: food safety, sustainable agriculture and the
    local economy and agriculture finance. The authors accompanied each class of applications
    with real world use cases. However, these use cases are discussed on a very high
    level aspect with no implementation details or results. C. AI and Machine Learning
    Assisted Work The advent of new age technologies such as artificial intelligence
    (AI) and machine learning (ML) not only facilitate the adaptation of advanced
    analytics in smart farming, but also create an ecosystem for improving the cybersecurity
    of services. Fusion of these technologies enable farmers to achieve higher average
    yield and better price control over their products in highly competitive markets.
    Design and implementation of a low cost IoT based security monitoring system have
    been proposed by Shabadi and Biradar [85]. The system focuses on physical layer
    of smart farming where it collects data from sensors. This data is sent to a controller
    where data is analyzed to make decisions like activating the actuators for water
    sprinkler in the farms. The proposed work is focused more on implementing the
    basic functionalities of smart farming than addressing security and privacy issues.
    It is very limited to simple threshold based decisions, like, if the soil temperature
    is above a certain threshold, then activate water sprinkler. Real time security
    monitoring for a remote farm is another current application of ML in smart farming.
    In scenarios where real time monitoring and notifications are paramount to farm
    and cybersecurity, the image(s) detected through a surveillance system can be
    processed by open-source computer vision programming supported by AI. For example,
    Abuan et al. [86] proposed a neural based face recognition system which is able
    to be invariant to changes in illumination for background and illumination conditions
    through a neural network training. The agricultural and farming industries have
    been widely influenced by the disruption of the IoT. However, the impact of the
    IoT is limited in countries with less penetration of mobile internet. The boom
    of low-power wide-area networks (LPWAN) in the last decade, with technologies
    such as LoRa or NB-IoT, has mitigated this by providing a relatively cheap infrastructure
    that enables low-power and long-range transmissions. Nonetheless, the benefits
    that LPWAN technologies have the disadvantage of low-bandwidth transmissions.
    Therefore, the integration of edge and fog computing, moving data analytics and
    compression near end devices, is key in order to extend functionality. By integrating
    AI at the local network layer, referred as edge AI, authors in [87] proposed a
    system architecture and implementation that expands the possibilities of smart
    agriculture and farming applications with edge and fog computing using LPWAN technology
    for large area coverage. In another research work [88], Support Vector Machines
    (SVM) along with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are used to create an integration
    platform for big data analysis for smart farming. Such a platform not only expedites
    processing huge amounts of data collected from farms and livestocks, but also
    gives smart farming stakeholders the ability to detect and respond against possible
    cyber attacks more efficiently. D. Other Relevant Literature Chi et al. [89] present
    a framework for cybersecurity approaches in precision agriculture and discussed
    challenges of using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) in digital virtual farms. They
    also present a framework for secure data capture. Security challenges in agrifood
    sector has been extensively discussed in [90]. The report provides an overview
    of emerging technologies in smart farming. Most smart farms are data-driven with
    respect to automating agriculture processes, decision making, and predictions.
    It also raises important questions of how important is data security? How risk
    assessment is done considering the entire supply chain? Who should take responsibility
    and who should be involved? The report serves to raise awareness addressing the
    importance of cybersecurity in agrifood sector. Authors in [98] provide an overview
    of cross-section of cybersecurity in food and agriculture sectors. They also discuss
    cyber-terrorism, policies, and plans. Spaulding and Wolf [99] detail the needs
    for educating farmers about various cybersecurity threats. Authors in [100] show
    the impact of cyber attacks on smart farming infrastructure via simulations using
    NETA with OMNET++ framework. Huning et al. [101] created a system to enable privacy
    preserving crowd sourcing techniques to estimate different smart farming parameters.
    Cybersecurity perception is also changing among farmers and agribusiness owners.
    Geil et al. [91] conducted an assessment of cybersecurity practices in the United
    States agriculture industry. Insights from their work reflect that over half of
    the respondents have been victims of a computer security incident, demonstrating
    that even individuals working in agriculture can be impacted by cybersecurity
    incidents. Cyberbiosecurity [92] is a multidisciplinary domain consists of cybersecurity,
    bio-security, and cyber-physical security. It discusses how current and emerging
    information technologies affect the cybersecurity of large portion of U.S. economy
    which is based on food and agriculture (i.e. Bio-economy). As Peccoud et al. [102]
    discuss, food and agricultural sectors are immensely diverse and require advanced
    technologies and efficiencies that rely on computer technologies, big data, cloud-based
    data storage, and internet accessibility, at the same time are vulnerable to cybersecurity
    incidents. Based on our literature review, it can be emphasised that, there is
    a dearth of security related research done in smart farming domain. There are
    numerous unanswered important security questions and open research challenges
    as discussed in the following section. SECTION VI. Open Challenges and Research
    Areas This section discusses open research challenges for improving security and
    privacy in smart farming ecosystem, as well illustrated in Figure 5. These open
    problems have been divided into four subsections as follows. FIGURE 5. Open research
    challenges and future directions for cybersecurity in smart farming. Show All
    A. Access Control, Trust & Privacy Perspective The multi-layered architecture
    discussed in section II recognizes possibilities of cyber threat challenges, which
    needs to be addressed by extending and adapting current access control foundational
    research, as well as developing sophisticated access control solutions to assist
    dynamic and agile environments in cyber-physical systems like smart farms. In-farm
    and cross farm operations need authorized interaction among sensors and labor/farmers
    working at multiple farms operating different sets of smart devices. What kind
    of operations they can do must be checked, which may require single level or multiple
    level access control depending on the risk factor associated with the operation?
    For example, consider sowing the field with autonomous tractor as compared to
    turning ON an irrigation system during the rainy season. Delegation and revocation
    of access rights to operate on a farm must be automatically performed based on
    the contract agreement, for example, in case temporary labor hired during harvesting
    season. Such access control requirements need further investigation to be adopted
    in such dynamic environment. The notion of trust can also be developed where labor
    who has worked earlier or an equipment borrowed from a ‘known’ old friend may
    have higher trust level as compared to machine and manpower hired from co-operative
    market. Self-configurable AI assisted smart access control policies need to be
    developed in a sharing-dominated CPS domain like smart farming. Cyber physical
    systems introduce the notion of virtual objects (which can be created in cloud
    or edge environment) corresponding to real physical sensors. An important challenge
    here is the location of cyber entities created as a part of connection with cloud
    or edge environments, for example, AWS device shadows34 or Microsoft Azure device
    twins.35 Research needs to determine: a) how cyber entity will move from one cloud
    (or edge) to another if the corresponding device is borrowed from one farmer to
    another? b) how the control of virtual entities will be delegated to the lending
    farmer, whether both the farmers need to use same application? c) how the applications
    will allow to delegate access for machine operation? d) Can the virtual objects
    or equipment across farms communicate with each other, whether at the physical
    level or using the virtual entities? If it is the virtual entity across different
    accounts in the same cloud provider, how such interaction will take place? In
    case it is across different cloud providers, how cross cloud and federated cloud
    environments will ensure such trust levels? Suppose in case a farmer has borrowed
    an equipment from a friend farmer, will the original owner be able to have access
    to it, or the access will be completely revoked? Is it possible to control a device
    through different remote clouds? All are relevant questions in smart farming domain.
    Further, how to establish trust mechanisms among different cloud service providers
    which the farmer is using for services and alerts? Manufacturer of the device
    may hold digital twin [103] and the cloud used by farmers will get data from on-field
    sensor and the cloud provider via pre-defined and signed negotiations. Such negotiations
    can also define what kind of data will be shared with required permissions of
    the owner farmer. Another important question is, how to establish trust between
    physical sensor objects? One approach is sensors at the same farm trust each other
    more for the shared information as compared to sensors across different farms.
    IoT and CPS specific cross cloud access controls and related security models are
    still in infancy stage and need more attention. Livestock and animals also have
    sensors embedded, which require appropriate authorized access. However, current
    literature does not provide strong access control mechanisms that can restrict
    such operations and secure critical data sharing from cattle and livestock at
    the farm. These wearable and health monitoring devices are attached to livestock
    and collect sensitive data, which can be used by adversaries to control the animal
    or even effect the sale/purchase of a cattle, for example, having the information
    about which cow is having low milk production. Efficient access controls [104]–[106]
    are needed to safeguard such sensitive data in cloud, which needs more research
    considering the spate of breaches heard every now and then. Usually in case of
    wearable IoT devices, a human which has the device controls what kind of data
    he/she wants to be shared. However, it is not in case of livestock which has a
    master (like the owner of the farm or caretaker) to decide control. Also, as a
    cattle is sold/purchased and moves from one owner to another, relevant data sharing
    security policies need to be specified and will require automatically configured
    information sharing. Studies [107], [108] have shown vulnerabilities in human
    used fitness devices, however, such studies and research are still an open challenge
    in case of livestock devices. Since data is collected from smart devices spread
    across farms, different applications require to access to this data. Consequentially,
    it is important to limit the sharing of data across applications and across nearby
    friend farmers, who may also get some value or receive alerts for their farms.
    How and when to share such information requires adaptive security policies to
    control and supervise data transferred by sensors to the cloud platform. Further,
    if data is sharing across multi cloud systems, cross cloud trust also needs to
    be addressed. Appropriate attribute based fine grained access controls [109],
    [110] and privacy preserving schemes need to be deployed to ensure confidentiality
    of the data. Evidently, farmers must decide the level and type of data sharing
    needed to ensure the privacy of critical information. B. Data Perspective The
    most noticeable feature of smart farming is its communication ability between
    the smart devices, resulting in an unprecedented amount of generated data [7],
    [111]. This provides many challenges as discussed in section III and open doors
    for several research opportunities. Machine learning is an attractive solution
    for processing big data, and implementing effective security solutions. Insider
    data leakage detection has always been a daunting task as users already have legitimate
    access to the system, making it hard to detect and predict such attacks. Several
    research works have been conducted on insider data leakage [22], [112], [113];
    however, none has been targeting smart farming settings. Further investigation
    is needed to understand the possibility of adopting insider data leakage defense
    mechanisms into smart farming and whether unique characteristics of smart farming
    can help to improve these mechanisms. Smart farms are highly connected systems,
    which allow malware to easily propagate through the network infecting all interconnected
    devices. An interesting question is how to detect malware in smart farming IoT
    environment, especially considering all heterogeneous devices in place. For instance,
    a malware detection technique that works against a malware that infects smart
    farming equipment might not work against malware that infects edge or cloud systems
    since the malware’s end goal is different. Many AI assisted malware detection
    techniques [114]–[120] are proposed and used in practice; however, there are no
    smart-farming-specific malware detection techniques that consider the context
    and environment in which smart farms reside. Smart farms generate diverse and
    vast amount of unstructured data. It is almost impossible for one party to analyze
    and make use of the entire datasets. For this reason, threat information sharing
    is a viable approach for data security. For instance, each smart farm can employ
    a malware detection technique; however, it is guaranteed that none of these employed
    techniques is comprehensive enough to catch all types of malware. Information
    sharing between smart farms can prove very useful. It can be used as an asset
    to share threat information about attack patterns or malware that was detected
    by collaborating smart farms. In a similar case, if a deployed detection technique
    in a farm detected supplied water with high toxin content, it is relevant to share
    that information with nearby farms who may also be impacted by similar issue.
    This can save analysis cost and money for every participating smart farm as it
    prevents doing work that someone else already did before. What kind of data, meta-data
    or analysis can be shared remains an open question and what kind of threat information
    sharing process can be used remain an open question for resource constrained farmers.
    Smart farming is an emerging field, so it is highly likely to encounter zero-day
    attacks which have not been detected before. Anomaly detection [121]–[125] is
    a very appealing solution against such attacks. Anomaly detection techniques look
    for any abnormal behavior that deviates from the pre-established database of normal
    behavior. These normal behaviour profiles are constructed based on collection
    of historical observations and patterns. Building smart farms behavior profiles
    is a challenging task since their behaviors are so dynamic in nature. External
    factors are a major reason for this dynamism. For example, less irrigation is
    needed during a rainy weather than dry weather which will cause a different behavior
    for irrigation systems. Can weather forecast information be used as an indication
    of such change of behavior? What kind of data contribute to building smart farms
    behavior profiles? Do some data fields weigh more than others? These are all open
    research questions that need to be investigated. Detection mechanisms are used
    to detect faulty and compromised sensors by monitoring the data sent for any tampered
    or abnormal values. Employing a simple threshold based mechanism can easily be
    bypassed by an attacker, so in most cases, more sophisticated machine learning
    based mechanisms need to be deployed. However, smart attackers can still bypass
    these models by (1) exploiting the sensors and a little tweaking of data sent
    by these sensors just to lead the machine learning model in place to misclassify/mispredict
    the outcome (such attack is called adversarial machine learning attack), and (2)
    poisoning the model during training phase by injecting bad data into the model’s
    training database, and in turn get it to learn something it shouldn’t. Some research
    addressed mitigation against adversarial attacks; however, it is not clear whether
    these technologies can be adopted to smart farming domain which is very dominant
    on changing environment conditions. Another open research challenge is to create
    various artificial intelligence systems that collect and parse Cyber Threat Intelligence
    (CTI36) about smart devices, software, cloud systems etc. used in the smart farming
    ecosystem. These systems have been developed to collect CTI in other areas [126]–[129]
    and need to be extended to ensure coverage of various smart farming devices, equipment
    and software. C. Network Perspective Cybersecurity threats to smart farming and
    its devices include a diverse range of security risks due to certain characteristics
    of the underlying networking and communication technologies which are used in
    the domain. First, both virtual and physical communication environments get connected.
    Many IoT devices in a smart farm system are capable of functioning on the data
    they receive from their respective environments which shortens the distance between
    virtual and physical systems. While convenient for the users, it allows cyber
    threats to convert to physical consequences more quickly, thereby having a bigger
    impact. Second, devices and layers involved in a smart farm system create a complex
    communication environment. Hyper connected farming environments exist due to the
    growing availability and diversity of IoT devices. ‘Complex’ in this context means
    that large number of devices are working in a single smart farm environment such
    that dynamic interactions between them are possible. This complexity expands the
    capabilities of an environment, but at the cost of a wider attack surface. Smart
    farming like other emerging technologies is embracing new networking paradigms
    to tackle today’s sophisticated attacks. Software defined network (SDN) [130]–[132]
    is one such promising networking revolution. Through decoupling control plane
    from data plane and giving credit to network programmable, it offers interesting
    technical capabilities to network providers. This causes an intense adaption of
    SDN in almost every fields of networking, from data center networks to WANs, wireless,
    5G and recently IoT. Using SDN in smart farm networking is attracting to both
    academia and industry for certain reasons. SDN supports both physical and virtual
    networking scenarios very well. It also offers a reliable way of practicing networking
    in highly diverse and naturally heterogeneous smart farms networking environment.
    Moreover, using SDN, smart farms are able to form a holistic view of all the connected
    devices along with how they interact in a near real time manner. Such a holistic
    view not only improves agility, scalability, and manageability of smart farm networking
    but also empowers a large smart farm network to enforce robust security counter
    measure against possible sophisticated cyber attacks. It is important to research
    further the adaptability of SDN and other 5G related next generation communication
    technologies in smart farming and precision agriculture domain. SDN can enable
    smart farms to get the most benefit out of complex machine learning and AI algorithms
    to automate network management of large number of sensors, wireless and wired
    networks used in a smart farming ecosystem. It also facilitates implementing advanced,
    cross-layer network security solutions which are very time and resource consuming,
    if not impossible, otherwise. Finally, SDN expedites edge networking and hence
    cloud-based security-as-a-service delivery model becomes a more approachable solution
    in large smart farming deployments. D. Compliance and Supply Chain Perspective
    With the ubiquitous use of sensors, automated drones, blockchain, artificial intelligence
    integration, different agricultural businesses are falling back on compliance,
    regulation and cyber insurance to protect themselves [64]. With the development
    of targeted malware and other cyber threats, the entire food supply chain is at
    risk [12], [64]. A hostile actor specifically interested in disrupting the supply
    chain can target various organizations and companies that supply raw material
    to farms or process food for the end user. A potential solution to this problem
    is to develop industry standards that enable trust between various raw material
    suppliers and downstream food processors [64]. The development of these standards
    enforced by national governments through regulation, has been slow. One example
    of such a shortcoming, is the existence of a few cybersecurity standards for the
    many smart devices used in the food supply chain. Various legislation are being
    introduced to set ‘minimal cybersecurity operational standards for internet connected
    devices’. In specific cases where various governments do not wish to regulate
    these interactions, it is up to various agriculture businesses to protect themselves
    by asking their supply chain to ‘self-regulate’ cybersecurity best practices [64].
    Such developments can be pushed through market demands, competitive pressure,
    etc. The food supply chain also lacks robust cyber insurance policies. With the
    constant development of smart applications, AI, smart farming equipment, etc.
    cyber insurance providers are unable to predict and quantify various cyber risks
    involved in these systems. Specific research needs to be done so as to develop
    standard legal jargon and metrics to quantify cyber risk in smart farming. These
    will help create robust cyber insurance markets for precision agriculture. Various
    systems [133]–[136] also need to be built to make it easier for the end users
    to understand and parse these complex legal documents, cyber insurance policies,
    agreements, contracts, etc. Research on these open challenges will help wide adoption
    of precision agriculture technologies. SECTION VII. Conclusion The proliferation
    of smart devices with communication and sensing capabilities have unleashed plethora
    of user services, and at the same time made tasks more convenient and efficient
    for humans. However, wide adoption of such internet connected devices and data
    driven applications across various domains have raised security and privacy issues,
    making these systems vulnerable to cyber-attacks. This paper discusses such cybersecurity
    challenges in smart farming and elaborates open research questions. The paper
    first outlines a multi-layer smart farming architecture illustrating different
    entities pertinent to real time use-cases supported by edge and cloud environments.
    Based on the architecture, the paper outlines security and privacy issues and
    highlights different attacks scenarios in smart farms as well as scenarios affecting
    the entire food supply chain. Thereafter, this article surveys the state-of-the-art
    research and acknowledges important works related to cybersecurity in the domain.
    Finally, the paper illustrates several open challenges and research problems pertinent
    to security and privacy aspects in precision agriculture. We envision this paper
    will simulate research to solve platitude of security and data privacy issues
    in fast growing and economically important smart farming sector. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

  analysis: The article focuses on the use of automated irrigation management systems
    and selecting data that will be relevant and useful in designing and implementing
    these systems; therefore, the data chosen for monitoring must be applicable to
    irrigation management and have typical sources. The authors propose using an IoT-based
    architecture that employs edge and fog computing paradigms that facilitate the
    development and implementation of automated irrigation systems. However, the paper
    does not mention any specific data types or sources in the context of irrigation
    management, so I cannot provide a more specific analysis.

    1. Introduction\nPrecision Agriculture (PA) is a whole-farm management approach\
    \ using information technology,\nremote sensing and proximal data gathering. These\
    \ technologies have the goal of optimising returns\non inputs while potentially\
    \ reducing environmental impacts. Farmers and agronomists have already\nbegun\
    \ employing technologies in order to improve the efﬁciency of their work. Sensors\
    \ placed\nin greenhouses allow farmers to obtain detailed data on real-time as\
    \ variables such as soil and\nambient temperature, irrigation water and soil conductivity,\
    \ soil and irrigation water PH, nutrient\ncomposition data, irrigation water properties,\
    \ etc. These data can be transmitted and analysed using\ncommunication technologies\
    \ and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) paradigms could be applied. Farmers use\ntheir\
    \ smartphones to remotely monitor their crops and equipments and to run some statistical\
    \ data.\nAll of these techniques help make up PA. Nowadays, the farmers are using\
    \ resources developed by\ninformation and communication technologies. These ﬁrst\
    \ resources are easy to use but they are general\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731; doi:10.3390/s18061731\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n2 of 21\npurpose and, therefore,\
    \ not adapted to the speciﬁc needs of each farmer. In this work an user-centred\n\
    method is proposed to design intelligent and adapted services where each farmer\
    \ decides its own\ninstallation using edge and fog paradigms (distributed computing)\
    \ on Internet of Things technologies\n(Figure 1). This method is designed on different\
    \ use cases and tested in an automated greenhouse as\nan example of utility. The\
    \ work is an expanded version presented in [1]. This paper is organized as\nfollows:\
    \ Section 2 reviews precision agriculture scenarios, how to use centred design\
    \ methodologies,\nIoT technologies and their deployment, the capabilities and\
    \ potential of edge and fog computing\nparadigms in these scenarios. Different\
    \ greenhouses are analysed and farmers are consulted. Section 3\nproposes a method\
    \ to deploy distributed IoT architecture using edge and fog nodes that offer a\
    \ set\nof new resources that can be used in any type of installation which facilitates\
    \ the involvement of\nthe farmer. In Section 4, experiments including services\
    \ on edge and fog nodes, connected by IoT\ncommunication protocols, are performed.\
    \ Finally, Section 5 provides conclusions and future works.\nFigure 1. Agricultural\
    \ System.\n2. Related Works\nAlthough more complex deﬁnitions exist, the simple\
    \ description of the PA is a way to “apply the\nright treatment in the right place\
    \ at the right time” [2].\nPrecision agriculture comprises a set\nof technologies\
    \ that combine sensors, information systems, enhanced machinery and informed\n\
    management to optimize production by accounting for variability and uncertainties\
    \ within agricultural\nsystems. It is a farming management concept based upon\
    \ observing, measuring and responding to\ninter and intra-ﬁeld variability in\
    \ crops [3]. Methods and technologies to decide how, where and when\nto use sensors\
    \ and machinery should involve all the main actors: that is, farmers and information\n\
    and communication technicians. User-centred methods and IoT communication technologies\
    \ applied\non precision agriculture are revised in this section. Finally, different\
    \ greenhouses are analysed and\nfarmers are consulted.\n2.1. User-Centred Design\
    \ Models\nIn PA context, User-Centred Design (UCD) describe a design process where\
    \ farmers inﬂuence the\nprocess of how the design takes shape. There are several\
    \ ways in which the user (agricultural specialist)\ncan be involved in the process.\
    \ This term describes a set of methods to create models on which\ndesign adapted\
    \ solutions. The user-centred design process works against subjective assumptions\n\
    about user behaviour. It requires proof that the design decisions are effective.\
    \ If user-centred design is\nproperly done, applications becomes an outcome of\
    \ actively engaging users. Therefore, any design\ndecisions that were made by\
    \ observing and listening to them will not be based on personal preferences.\n\
    User experience (UX) is one of the many focuses of UCD. It includes the user’s\
    \ entire experience with\nthe product, including physical and emotional reactions.\
    \ UCD is objective and often relies on data\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n3 of 21\n\
    to support design decisions [4]. According to [5], user centred design is a development\
    \ method that\nguarantees that product, software or web site will be easy to use.\
    \ The International Usability Standard\n(ISO 13407) [6], speciﬁes the principles\
    \ that underlie user centred design:\n•\nRequirements gathering, understanding\
    \ and specifying the context of use\n•\nRequirements speciﬁcation, specifying\
    \ the user and organisational requirements\n•\nDesign, producing designs and prototypes\n\
    •\nEvaluation, carrying out user-based assessment of the site\nThe design is based\
    \ upon an explicit understanding of users, tasks and environments. Users are\n\
    involved throughout design and development. The process is iterative. The design\
    \ is driven and\nreﬁned by user-centred evaluation. The design addresses the whole\
    \ user experience. The design team\nincludes multidisciplinary skills and perspectives.\n\
    2.2. Internet of Things: Architectures and Protocols\nIot is developed using architectures\
    \ based on layers capable of connecting a huge number of\ndevices with each other\
    \ and with the established services. The basic model of IoT has a 3 layer\narchitecture\
    \ which are of Perception, Network and Application Layers. IoT faces several challenges,\n\
    especially in the ﬁeld of privacy and security, so to overcome these issues new\
    \ standard architectures\nneed to be more focused on many essential factors like\
    \ Quality of Services (QoS), data integrity,\nsustainability, conﬁdentiality,\
    \ etc. The IAB (Internet Architecture Board) has published the RFC\n7452 document:\
    \ Architectural Considerations in Smart Object Networking. This document offers\n\
    guidance to engineers designing Internet-connected smart objects. A Request for\
    \ Comments (RFC),\nin the context of Internet governance, is a type of publication\
    \ from the Internet Engineering Task Force\n(IETF) and the Internet Society (ISOC),\
    \ the principal technical development and standards-setting\nbodies for the Internet.\n\
    Table 1 illustrates different works that apply the layer model in the\nIoT architecture.\n\

    \ Network, Application [7,8]\n4\nThings, Edge, Network, Application [9]\n5\nBusiness,\
    \ Application, Service, Object abstration, Objects [10]\nIoT needs protocols adapted\
    \ to the new requirements. Traditional protocols are extended and\nnew protocols\
    \ are proposed offering different options on different contexts. IoT has now a\
    \ wide\nrange of applications. A smart devices can have wired or wireless connection.\
    \ As far as the wireless\nIoT is the main concern, many different wireless communication\
    \ technologies and protocols can be\nused to connect the smart device such as\
    \ Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6), over Low power Wireless\nPersonal Area Networks\
    \ (6LoWPAN), ZigBee, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Z-Wave and Near Field\nCommunication\
    \ (NFC). They are short range standard network protocols, while SigFox and Cellular\n\
    are Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN).standard protocols. In [11] a review and\
    \ comparison of\ndifferent communication protocols in IoT is realised. This comparison\
    \ aims at presenting guidelines\nfor the researchers to be able to select the\
    \ right protocol for different applications. Table 2 illustrates\ndifferent protocols\
    \ used in the architecture layers.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n4 of 21\nTable 2.\

    Choosing the most appropriate protocol depends on several facts of which most\
    \ important are:\nenvironmental conditions, network characteristics, the amount\
    \ of data to be transferred, security levels\nand quality of service requests\
    \ [12]. CoAP network is primarily a one-to-one protocol for transferring\nstate\
    \ information between client and server while MQTT is a many-to-many communication\n\
    protocol for exchanging messages between multiple clients. CoAP runs over UDP\
    \ which means\nthat communication overhead is signiﬁcantly reduced. If constrained\
    \ communication and battery\nconsumption is not an issue, RESTful services can\
    \ be easily implemented and interact with the Internet\nusing the worldwide HTTP\
    \ [13]. If the targeted ﬁnal applications require massive updates of the same\n\
    value, MQTT protocol is more suitable. In this work different protocols (MQTT,\
    \ HTTP, Bluetooth, WiFi,\nLTE, ...) can be used to develop proposed architecture.\n\
    2.3. Internet of Things Technologies Applied on PA Scenarios\nAdvance in electronics,\
    \ computing and telecommunications are allowing the development of\nnew devices\
    \ (sensors, actuators and computing nodes) with wireless communication capabilities,\n\
    installed at any location, smaller, energy efﬁcient, autonomous, more powerful\
    \ and low cost [14–18].\nIoT works using user-driven service modeling is proposed\
    \ in [19]. Low-cost IoT devices that need\nto gather and transmit sensor data\
    \ and receive remote commands is shown in [20–22]. IoT uses the\nconnection between\
    \ devices to improve their efﬁciency and user experience, being the communication\n\
    one of the main elements for a proper IoT network. A review of the most common\
    \ wired and wireless\ncommunication protocols, discussion of their characteristics,\
    \ advantages and disadvantages as well as\na comparison study to choose the best\
    \ bidirectional sensor network composed by low power devices is\nrealised in [23].\
    \ Previous works show the degree of development of IoT technology, which has also\n\
    been experienced in precision agriculture in recent years.\nIoT technologies are\
    \ proposed in PA scenarios. In [24] this paradigm is analysed as a solution in\n\
    precision farming. IoT Smart farming application include farm parameters tracking,\
    \ monitoring, ﬁeld\nobservation and storage monitoring. The work Internet of Things\
    \ Platform for Smart Farming [25]\npresents a platform based on IoT technologies\
    \ that can automate the collection of environmental, soil,\nfertilisation, and\
    \ irrigation data; automatically correlate such data and ﬁlter-out invalid data\
    \ from\nthe perspective of assessing crop performance; and compute crop forecasts\
    \ and personalised crop\nrecommendations for any particular farm. This platform\
    \ (SmartFarmNet) can integrate virtually any\nIoT device, including commercially\
    \ available sensors, cameras, weather stations, etc., and store their\ndata in\
    \ the cloud for performance analysis and recommendations. An evaluation of the\
    \ SmartFarmNet\nplatform and the experiences and lessons learnt in developing\
    \ this system concludes the paper.\nSmartFarmNet is the ﬁrst and currently largest\
    \ system in the world (in terms of the number of\nsensors attached, crops assessed,\
    \ and users it supports) that provides crop performance analysis\nand recommendations.\n\
    In [9] a greenhouse with hydroponic crop production was designed, developed and\
    \ tested using\nUbiquitous Sensor Network monitoring and control on Internet of\
    \ Things paradigm. The experimental\nresults showed that the Internet technologies\
    \ and Smart Object Communication Patterns can be\ncombined to encourage development\
    \ of Precision Agriculture. They demonstrated added beneﬁts\n(cost, energy, smart\
    \ developing, acceptance by agricultural specialists) when a project is launched.\n\
    Other related work is shown in [26] with Zig Bee technology: Artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ and decision\nsupport approaches have been developed. This work develop technology\
    \ for real-time monitoring\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n5 of 21\nof citrus soil moisture\
    \ and nutrients and the research on the integration of fertilization and irrigation\n\
    decision support system. The results showed that the system could help the grower\
    \ to scientiﬁcally\nfertilize or irrigate, improve the precision operation level\
    \ of citrus production, reduce the cost and\nreduce the pollution caused by chemical\
    \ fertilizer. A review into the state-of-the-art of Big Data\napplications in\
    \ Smart Farming is performed in [27]. Malche et al. [28] proposed a prototype\
    \ IoT system\nfor water level monitoring which can be implemented in future smart\
    \ villages in India. Manufacturers\nof the agricultural sector highlights the\
    \ importance of IoT in [29–32]. PA is effectively a suite of\nmethods, approaches\
    \ and instrumentation that farmers should examine in detail to decide which is\n\
    the most suitable for their business.\n2.4. Internet of Things, Cloud and Machine\
    \ Learning Evolution: Edge and Fog Computing Paradigms\nInternet of Things (IoT)\
    \ aims to bring every object (e.g. smart cameras, environmental sensors,\ncontrol\
    \ appliances, machine learning analysis) on line, hence generating massive amounts\
    \ of data that\ncan overwhelm storage systems and data analytic applications.\
    \ Cloud computing offers services at\nthe infrastructure level that can scale\
    \ to IoT storage and processing requirements. However, there are\napplications\
    \ such as sensor monitoring, control and analysis response that require low latency\
    \ therefore,\ndelay caused by transferring data to the cloud and then back to\
    \ the application can seriously impact\ntheir performances. To overcome this limitation,\
    \ Fog and Edge computing paradigms have been\nproposed, where cloud services are\
    \ extended to the edge of the network to decrease the latency and\nnetwork congestion\
    \ [33]. Both fog computing and edge computing involve pushing intelligence and\n\
    processing capabilities down closer to where the data originates from pumps, motors,\
    \ sensors, relays,\netc. The key difference between the two architectures is exactly\
    \ where that intelligence and computing\npower is placed:\n•\nFog computing pushes\
    \ intelligence down to the local area network level, processing data in a fog\n\
    node or IoT gateway\n•\nEdge computing pushes the intelligence, processing power\
    \ and communication capabilities of an\nedge gateway or appliance directly into\
    \ devices like programmable automation controllers (PACs)\nWith IoT implementation\
    \ now becoming more widespread, devices will generate a lot of data at\nthe end\
    \ of the network and many applications will be deployed at the edge to process\
    \ the information.\nCisco Systems predicts that an estimated 50 billion devices\
    \ will connect to the Internet by 2020 [34–36].\nSome of the applications they\
    \ run might require very short response times, some might involve private\ndata,\
    \ and some might produce huge quantities of data. Cloud computing cannot support\
    \ these IoT\napplications. Edge and Fog computing paradigms, on the other hand,\
    \ can do so and will promote\nmany new IoT applications.\nThe work done in [37]\
    \ concludes that the wireless sensor and actuator networks based on Edge\ncomputing\
    \ are experiencing fast development and opportunities in the post-Cloud era, and\
    \ are used\nin more and more applications. In [38] a Fog Computing Based on radio\
    \ access networks is proposed\nfor smart-cities services.\n2.5. Automated Technologies\
    \ in Greenhouses\nDifferent greenhouses in the south east of Spain have been visited\
    \ to analyse the type of installation\nand to ask expert users. The greenhouse\
    \ with the highest level of automation showed a complete\nnumber of sensors and\
    \ actuators; however, not all the sensors could be related. There are two large\n\
    subsystems in self-assembled greenhouses that are not interoperable. These subsystems\
    \ install different\ntypes of control and technologies:\n•\nIrrigation and nutrition\n\
    •\nAir conditioning and ventilation.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n6 of 21\nIn these\
    \ facilities, an ambient temperature sensor of the air conditioning system is\
    \ not related to\nan irrigation water temperature sensor of the irrigation system.\
    \ Figure 2 shows different automated\ngreenhouses where main subsystems are listed.\n\
    Figure 2. Automated greenhouses: main subsystems in current facilities.\n3. User\
    \ Centred and Computing Method Model: Distributed Computing Architecture Based\
    \ on\nEdge and Fog Nodes\nThe current agricultural facilities are divided in subsystems\
    \ (irrigation, light, climate, soil, crop\nand energy) that are not interconnected.\
    \ Industrial logic programmable controllers and specialised\nsensors give basic\
    \ automation services in each subsystem. Internet and electronic devices (smartphones)\n\
    provide new functionalities based on information access, control and monitoring.\
    \ Human interfaces\non smartphones connected to web servers are examples of new\
    \ services developed over the past years.\nAgricultural technician and farmers\
    \ have knowledge that can be converted on expert rules for device\ncontrol. These\
    \ rules are programmed and implemented on actual programmable devices; however,\n\
    they are static rules which means that do not evolve when new conditions occur,\
    \ neither do they\nadapt to the singularities of each installation. The farmer\
    \ has to decide how to set the rules: what pH\nthe irrigation water must have,\
    \ how much water should be programmed in irrigation process, etc.\nAlso, each\
    \ rule only has effects in a subsystem (irrigation, climate), there is no interoperability.\n\
    Considering this context, new facilities design and development method are proposed\
    \ in this\nwork. The aim is that the farmer participates in the automated activities\
    \ and that the subsystems\nbecome interoperable. A method that implement automatic\
    \ rules and automate the decision making\nconsidering the behaviour of the installation\
    \ itself are also proposed. The phases of the proposed\nmodel are shown in Figure\
    \ 3.\n•\nAnalysis: two kind of users are identiﬁed in this phase (agriculture\
    \ user expert and ICT technician).\nExpert users in agriculture are interviewed\
    \ to deﬁne main processes to control. All these issues are\nrelated with ICT expert\
    \ in a participatory design. The results of this ﬁrst approach are the things\n\
    required to design services and control. In this phase an user-centred methodology\
    \ captures the\nfarmer requirements.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n7 of 21\n•\nDesign:\
    \ the model is based on an architecture with three levels: edge, fog and cloud\
    \ services.\nIn this phase an adapted architecture using these levels is designed.\
    \ The adapted architecture is\nshown in Figure 4.\n•\nIntegration and data analysis:\
    \ Installation and Integration subsystems are developed in this phase.\nData analysis\
    \ is proposed to design machine learning services based on expert rules with farmer.\n\
    •\nStart up, measure and feedback: Test and feedback are launched.\nThe ﬁrst expert\
    \ rules\nare integrated with farmer supervision.\nNew rules are designed with\
    \ feedback processes.\nAutomatic and adapted rules are developed using artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence systems with machine\nlearning platforms.\nFigure 3. User centred\
    \ model based on design and integration of edge and fog communication levels.\n\
    Cloud services and machine learning processes are integrated using this method.\n\
    Figure 4. Architecture: communication levels with different functionality.\nSensors\
    \ 2018, 18, 1731\n8 of 21\n3.1. User-Centred Analysis and Design\nThere are two\
    \ cases treated:\n•\nAgricultural installation with some automated facilities\
    \ already installed\n•\nNew agricultural installation\nThe method is the same\
    \ for both. Expert users in agriculture are interviewed to deﬁne new\nprocesses\
    \ to control. In this ﬁrst approach, the things (objects) required, their relationships\
    \ and the\npotential services are detected. Once objects and services have been\
    \ detected, they must be related\nto the necessary communication and control technologies\
    \ (IoT protocols). Human Interfacing are\nadjusted. Expert rules and intelligent\
    \ services are analysed (Edge and Fog computing proposal). Finally,\nthe installation,\
    \ maintenance and operation methods are designed. All this is designed between\
    \ user\nagricultural technician and information technologies expert.\nThe results\
    \ of this ﬁrst approach are the things required to design services and control.\
    \ A ﬁrst set\nof sensors, actuators, variables, processes and controllers are\
    \ designed considering production facility.\nThis set of objects will be considers\
    \ like things in the next stage.\nIn this description, a thing is formed by an\
    \ object/entity and a context with data associated.\nEach thing has a n-tuple\
    \ data structure (ID, time, date, location, relations, state) where ID, data,\n\
    location, relations with other things and states are deﬁned. Table 3 represents\
    \ different things.\nExpert users design control rules using the things deﬁned.\
    \ These control rules are part of control\nprocesses (climate, soil, irrigation,\
    \ crop, energy or image) that are distributed in different embedded\nsystems connected\
    \ to the network (intranet/internet). Things are a virtual representation of all\n\
    available resources that can be deployed in the different subsystems of the installation.\n\
    At this level all objects/things are recognized by designers. Basic control algorithms\
    \ of all\nsubsystems are designed.\nTable 3. Things context designed in smart\
    \ control processes.\nObject/Thing\nContext\nSensori\n(ID, time, date, location,\
    \ relations, state)\nActuatori\n(ID, time, date, location, relations, state)\n\

    \ date, location, relations, state)\nControlleri\n(ID, time, date, location, relations,\
    \ state)\n3.2. Integration: Architecture Development\nIn the previous phase objects\
    \ and their relationship with basic algorithms has been designed.\nAn architecture\
    \ adapted to the facility available is developed in this phase. Requirements are:\n\
    1.\nInterconnection and data access of all subsystems data\n2.\nFacilities and\
    \ resources to implement expert rules\n3.\nConﬁguration, operation and modiﬁcation\
    \ processes\nIoT and AI paradigms provide resources to propose an innovative architecture\
    \ that can be used in\nnew smart precision agriculture services. Edge computing\
    \ used on control devices and fog computing\nnodes installed on local network\
    \ provide powerful technologies to implement conﬁguration, operation\nand improvement\
    \ processes.\nIoT protocols provide resources to capture and communique all subsystems\
    \ data. Each subsystem\nis composed by objects/things (sensor/actuator) that can\
    \ be connected and processed using nodes on\nsensor networks with IoT protocols.\
    \ The requirements established for PA scenarios are:\n•\nStandard and interoperable\
    \ communication protocols to develop open and reusable applications.\nSensors\
    \ 2018, 18, 1731\n9 of 21\n•\nLow-power consumption of all devices installed improve\
    \ the establishment and development.\n•\nEasy access and maintenance. Users are\
    \ not specialized in information technologies. It is important\nto improve its\
    \ acceptability.\n•\nSupport the integration of new smart modules (modularity\
    \ and scalability software and hardware).\n•\nNon-proprietary hardware-software\
    \ to reduce dependencies.\n•\nLow cost devices selection increases the level of\
    \ penetration.\nIoT protocols are designed to work on communication scenarios\
    \ and requirements established.\nThey are optimised for control and two-way open\
    \ communication channels. In these works [39–41]\nMessage Queuing Telemetry Transport\
    \ (MQTT) protocol is proposed as communication paradigm\nbetween sensors, actuators,\
    \ communication nodes, devices and subsystems. Some of the features that\nmakes\
    \ it especially suitable for this project are:\n•\nMQTT is a publish-subscribe\
    \ messaging protocol developed for resource-constrained devices [42],\na model\
    \ already in use by enterprises worldwide, and can work with legacy systems.\n\
    •\nAll messages have a topic path composed of words separated by slashes. A common\
    \ form is\n/place/device-type/device-id/measurement-type/status. The subscribers\
    \ may use wild-cards to\nsubscribe to all measurements coming from a speciﬁc class\
    \ of device.\n•\nThe bandwidth requirements are extremely low, and the nature\
    \ of the protocol makes it\nvery energy-efﬁcient.\n•\nThe programming interface\
    \ is very simple, and the client memory footprint is small, making it\nespecially\
    \ suitable for embedded devices.\n•\nThree Quality of Service (QoS) levels provide\
    \ reliable operations [43].\nUbiquitous networks allow an n-to-m nodes communication\
    \ model. Any node is able to query\nand be queried by other nodes. In addition,\
    \ any node may play the role of a base station (skin node)\ncapable of transmitting\
    \ its information to remote processing places using a gateway device. USN local\n\
    nodes can use and process local data, with a gateway these nodes have a global\
    \ accessibility and\nthey offer extended services on an IoT scenario.\nLocal and\
    \ global access over the same node\n(sensor/device/actuator) has different possibilities\
    \ and beneﬁts. Whereas a local data processing\nis necessary in basic process\
    \ control (security, system start-stop, etc.), global processing (analytic)\n\
    can be used in pattern detection and information generation. In this sense, the\
    \ proposed platform\nuses both technologies combined: different USN over a local\
    \ network area (intranet) connected to\ncloud-IoT services (internet). A computing\
    \ layer in local area, called edge computing, will serve as\ninterface between\
    \ control processes and cloud-services. This layer will be able to process data\
    \ before\ncommunicating to cloud.\n3.3. Data Analysis: Edge and Fog Computing\
    \ Conﬁguration\nThe development of edge and fog computing can be understood in\
    \ three phases:\n•\nConnection: Numerous heterogeneous, real time connections\
    \ between terminals and devices\nwill serve edge computing, as will automatic\
    \ network deployment and operation. Additionally,\nsecurity, reliability, and\
    \ interoperability of connections should be guaranteed. An application of\nthis\
    \ phase is remote automatic soil parameters and ambient conditions data reading\n\
    •\nData treatment on edge computing devices: In this phase, data analysis and\
    \ automatic services\ndevelop new capabilities that are implemented on the new\
    \ edge nodes. Applications of this\nphase can be data ﬁltering, predictive calculation\
    \ of climatic data, classiﬁcation services or\ndetection events\n•\nServices on\
    \ fog computing nodes: Enabled by technologies such as AI and IoT communication\n\
    protocols. Fog computing nodes carries out smart analysis and computing, as well\
    \ as implementing\ndynamic, real-time self-optimization, and executing policy\
    \ adjustments. Applications of this phase\nare prediction of water consumption,\
    \ smart detection or unattended production\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n10 of 21\n\
    Figure 5 shows the architecture implemented using edge and fog nodes. When automated\n\
    subsystems are already installed it is necessary to interleaved embedded devices\
    \ (edge-nodes) between\ncontrollers and sensors/actuators. This devices maintain\
    \ the initial services and allow to initiate\na supervised learning process. New\
    \ algorithms are tested and approved on edge and fog nodes.\nIn Figure 6 different\
    \ services are proposed on each node.\nFigure 5. Architecture proposed on facilities\
    \ already automated: edge nodes interleaved between\ndevices already installed\
    \ and fog nodes that interconnect all subsystems.\nFigure 6. Architecture implemented:\
    \ services proposed.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n11 of 21\n3.4. Test and Feedback\
    \ Developing\nIn machine learning systems the output is not ﬁxed. It will change\
    \ over time as the solution\nknows more and as the model on which the machine\
    \ learning system is built evolves as it is fed more\ndata. This forces the testing\
    \ professional to think differently and adopt test strategies that are very\n\
    different from traditional testing techniques. To test machine learning systems\
    \ is essential:\n1.\nObtaining data sets: This refers to a data set with main\
    \ variables captured and stored to analyse\nand design the model. In irrigation\
    \ process data set are: irrigation programming used (time and\nﬂow), ambient conditions\
    \ (humidity, temperature) and soil conditions (humidity, temperature,\npH and\
    \ conductivity) captured by sensors. All this data are monitored and stored.\n\
    2.\nTraining data sets: This refers to a data set used for training the model.\
    \ It is a subset of the\nprevious dataset. In irrigation process training data\
    \ set are: irrigation programming automated\nby the model (time and ﬂow decision)\
    \ considering ambient conditions (soil, ambient and crop).\nThis data is usually\
    \ prepared by collecting data in a semi-automated way. The results of this\nprocess\
    \ are validated with agronomists.\n3.\nTesting data sets: It is a dataset used\
    \ to to measure the model quality.\n4.\nValidation test suites on real scenarios.\
    \ Taking the irrigation example, test scenarios include\ncategorizing needs of\
    \ water for a kind of crop considering climatic conditions and its growth\nphase.\
    \ Automated irrigation decisions by the model are analysed in this phase.\n5.\n\
    Building validation suites. It is necessary to understand the algorithm. The model\
    \ has algorithm\nthat analyse the data provided, looks for speciﬁc patterns, and\
    \ uses the results of this analysis\nto develop optimal parameters for creating\
    \ the model. The model is reﬁned as the number of\niterations and the richness\
    \ of the data increase.\n6.\nCommunicating test results in statistical terms.\
    \ Models based on machine learning algorithms\nwill produce approximations and\
    \ not exact results. Quality of results must be analysed in the\nsame context.\
    \ The testing community will need to determine the level of conﬁdence within a\n\
    certain range.\n7.\nModel evolution. Support to develop new AI services or modiﬁcations\
    \ on algorithms\nimplemented. Supervised and automatic changes are processes to\
    \ maintain the operating models.\n3.5. Comparison with Industrial Facilities.\
    \ Novelty Elements Proposed\nCurrently, industrial facilities that use PA technologies\
    \ are based on integration of internet and web\nservices with automation and control\
    \ using industrial technology. Proprietary systems are designed for\nmonitoring\
    \ large production plants. Related work analysed show that the Agriculture Control\
    \ system\nfor production, irrigation, or climate proposes different monitoring\
    \ and control technologies, based on\nwireless sensor network and industrial control.\
    \ Monitoring systems analyse crop environment and the\nmethod to improve the decision\
    \ making by analysing statistics and reactive algorithms. This work\nproposes\
    \ two main novelty elements: optimization of architecture levels integration of\
    \ edge and fog\nlayers and proposes the integration the farmer in the design of\
    \ new improvements using data analysis\nobtained with the new architecture developed.\n\
    4. Experimental Work\nDifferent agricultural facilities have been analysed to\
    \ introduce the method proposed. Three kind\nof installations summarize the different\
    \ types:\n•\nInstallation automated but subsystems not interoperable\n•\nPartial\
    \ automation without any interconnection and non-interoperable systems\n•\nManual\
    \ control\nIn all of them, the services based on AI are not yet installed. In\
    \ this context, the method proposed\nusing edge-computing on basic controllers\
    \ and fog-computing on gateway nodes can design common\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n\
    12 of 21\nservices for the three types of facilities cited. With this conﬁguration,\
    \ subsystems interoperability and\nAI support are achieved. Control signals of\
    \ already installed controllers in automated installations\nbecome inputs to edge\
    \ nodes and a fog node which acts as an interface for all facility nodes. In all\n\
    greenhouses, irrigation and internal environment control are basic processes.\
    \ Agronomist users know\nhow to program reactive controls and how to conﬁgure\
    \ automated devices. Optimization of these\nresources (water, energy) are two\
    \ potential services that agronomist perform through their experience.\nThis knowledge\
    \ can be transferred to intelligent systems that integrate it through techniques\
    \ based on\nAI paradigms. Interconnection of subsystems also are one of the proposed\
    \ improvement. A deployment\nfor an automated installation is designed and implemented.\
    \ This case shows how to implement\nwhen there are already automated installations.\
    \ This case also serves as a guide for other types of\ngreenhouse installations.\n\
    4.1. Analysis\nThe farmer, together with the technician in information technologies,\
    \ propose a set\nof improvements:\n•\nMonitoring and control interfaces on the\
    \ Internet (control and communication services)\n•\nEvent and change communication\
    \ service (communication services)\n•\nInterconnection of irrigation and air conditioning\
    \ subsystems (interoperability services)\n•\nIntegration of automation to optimize\
    \ water consumption (AI services)\nThe work carried out designs an installation\
    \ that deploy the necessary hardware and software\nresources using the proposed\
    \ method Figure (Figure 7) shows agricultural subsystems and model\ndeployed on\
    \ distributed nodes.\nFigure 7. Greenhouse design. Fog and edge nodes relations\
    \ on agriculture subsystems.\nIntelligent irrigation control is installed in an\
    \ experimental greenhouse based on tomato\nhydroponic cultivation (Table 4). Following\
    \ the proposed method, the experimental phases are:\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n\

    \ Communication and Context\nIrrigation process, soil parameters, environmental\
    \ conditions inside and outside the greenhouse\nand energy consumption deﬁne objects\
    \ and context. Sensors, actuators and processes and their\nrelationship (context)\
    \ are shown in Table 5. Context vector are (ID, time, date, GH1, relations, state)\
    \ for\neach object/thing, where GH1 is the location ID of greenhouse.\nAll objects\
    \ are interoperable using MQTT protocol. Publisher and subscriber communication\n\
    model that implement this protocol allows interconnect all devices and things.\
    \ Broker device are\ninstalled on fog node. Publishers and subscribers are implemented\
    \ on different nodes.\n4.3. Hardware Devices and Software Modules\nTwo edge nodes\
    \ and one fog node are proposed to control climate and irrigation processes.\n\
    Objects (things) and processes are deployed on all nodes. Irrigation and climate\
    \ control are installed\nin edge nodes, AI services are implemented in fog node.\
    \ Process control architecture is used in\nthe ﬁrst node type (edge) and data-centred\
    \ architecture is used in the second node type (fog) and\nin the cloud services\
    \ implemented. In edge node the ﬂow of data comes from a set of variables\n(things\
    \ and internal variables) which control the processes execution. Agronomist and\
    \ expert users\ndesigns basic control algorithms. After learning and training\
    \ process, these algorithms will be adjusted\nand modiﬁed following the results\
    \ of the expert system (machine learning). The aim is to optimize\nresources (water,\
    \ energy) without losing productivity. Two main control processes are executed\
    \ in\ntwo edge nodes and one machine learning process is implemented in a fog\
    \ node. Table 5 shows these\nprocesses and their relationship. Algorithms are\
    \ implemented in Python and developed using open\nsource criteria. Minimal hardware\
    \ embedded devices requirements are shown in Table 6.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n\

    \ and Testing\nIn facilities already automated, edge nodes are interleaved between\
    \ the installed controllers\nand actual sensors and actuators. Some new sensors\
    \ are installed to complete services designed\n(energy meter). In current facilities\
    \ edge nodes are deployed and allows:\n•\nWork in the same way as before (initial\
    \ learning stage, analysis and model selection).\n•\nChange to a new control using\
    \ new expert and automatic rules using AI processes (supervised stage\nand training)\n\
    •\nTest and reconﬁgure expert rules (testing and maintenance)\nFigure 8 shows\
    \ an edge node to irrigation control and how is deployed in the experimental\n\
    greenhouse built in this work, without previous installation. Agronomists and\
    \ farmers preferences are\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n15 of 21\nthose that drive\
    \ the design: interfaces, maintain and optimize control processes. In irrigation\
    \ process a\ntime schedule with the selected flow rate is programmed by the user\
    \ according to the period of crop\ngrowth. In learning stage, edge node captures\
    \ the data and sends it to the fog node. Fog node process\ndiary water uses, ambient\
    \ and soil conditions, type of crop and its growth. Using these data crop\ntype\
    \ is classified. Crop production results are added as data to analyse it together\
    \ with the stored ones.\nProduction, water consumption, crop growing stage, time,\
    \ date, soil parameters, current weather, forecast\nweather and ambient green\
    \ house conditions are captured as inputs to machine learning platform.\n(a) Hardware\
    \ device\n(b) Software processes\nFigure 8. Hardware and software deployed on\
    \ experimental greenhouse edge node.\nIn future crop productions the irrigation\
    \ schedule can be automated, first with human supervision\nand then automated.\
    \ Biophysical variables (plant, soil, canal flow, and weather conditions) that\
    \ are\nmeasured during the growing seasons are used as inputs to build the models.\
    \ Information about\ncrop phenology (growth stages), soil moisture, and weather\
    \ variables will be compiled. The analysis\nof irrigation decisions is important\
    \ because this can help in the estimation of short-term irrigation\ndemands. If\
    \ the automated process decisions are known, It can help canal operators to better\
    \ manage\nwater deliveries and avoid unexpected delays and operational conditions\
    \ that increase canal losses.\nInformation about these demands can also be helpful\
    \ for the evaluation of expected future agricultural\nsupplies. It can never be\
    \ possible to know the exact reasons why a farmer decided to irrigate, all farmers\n\
    are different and prefer their own decision processes. Data analysis with farmer\
    \ in in its own installation\ninfer automated farmer actions. This data is used\
    \ to build the models and these learnt frameworks will\nbe used to predict irrigation\
    \ decisions. The specific objectives planned with farmer are:\n1.\nIdentify the\
    \ main variables contributing to an irrigation behaviour by training the models\
    \ with\nrelevant data\n2.\nGroup the irrigation decisions into distinct classes\n\
    3.\nIdentify the decisions taken\n4.\nDetect the patterns in farmer decisions\n\
    5.\nInfer future irrigation decisions using the information and modelling tools.\

    \ storage data and\ncommunicate with cloud services (monitoring interfaces). Figures\
    \ 10 and 11 and shows different\nvariables (soil moisture, soil temperature and\
    \ conductivity means) that farmer decide to use in\nirrigation control to design\
    \ new rules to optimize production. Before, control irrigation was controlled\n\
    only by a time schedule. Now, it takes into account data sensors to decide if\
    \ watering and growth\ncontrol can be optimized with decision trees.\nFigure 9.\

    \ of companies that provide IoT\nservices. These platforms are built with similar\
    \ architectures and provide, usually, the same resources:\nApplication Programming\

    \ provide dashboard designs to monitor data using HMI formats pre-built.\nUsing\
    \ API services, processes in fog node are implemented to send new data to each\
    \ dashboard.\nThe API Documentation speciﬁes the structure of the data that is\
    \ exchanged between your devices and\nthe Ubidots and Mobile-Alerts Cloud, along\
    \ with code examples and libraries to speed up the project.\nFigure 12 shows a\
    \ dashboard (interface HMI) designed by users on Ubidots cloud platform. The system\n\
    can use standard protocols in the different layers and platforms that implement\
    \ these protocols.\nSensors 2018, 18, 1731\n18 of 21\nFigure 12. Dashboards designed\
    \ for irrigation programming and monitoring.\n5. Conclusions and Future Work\n\
    In this work the state-of-the-art of PA and IoT technologies in agricultural scenarios,\
    \ have been\nanalysed. PA presents difﬁculties to be implemented by farmers. These\
    \ include cultural perception,\nlack of local technical expertise, infrastructure\
    \ constraints, knowledge and technical gaps and high\nstart-up costs. Farmers\
    \ must be involved in the design and integration of these technologies in their\n\
    facilities. To carry out this solution there must be methods to facilitate such\
    \ integration. This work\nproposes a new method to integrate the farmer in the\
    \ development of new solutions using low cost\nsensing technologies and innovative\
    \ communication paradigms. An architecture based on two new\nlevels of communication\
    \ and processing nodes (edge and fog nodes) form the technological core\nof the\
    \ proposed method. Each level performs a set of interconnected functionalities.\
    \ The proposed\ninfrastructure can be installed either in already automated installations\
    \ or in the design of new facilities.\nIn the already automated installations,\
    \ the method introduces new possibilities for the development of\nintelligent\
    \ and interconnected control. An experimental work has been carried out in a greenhouse.\n\
    In this work, communication nodes have been installed and a new service based\
    \ on a decision tree\nparadigm has been designed by expert user. The facilities\
    \ that use the proposed model make the\nclimate control and irrigation subsystems\
    \ interoperable and allow the farmer to design new integrated\ncontrol rules.\
    \ The new distributed communication model allows the farmer to analyse changes\
    \ and\nimprovements. This experimental work initiates a new methodology of work\
    \ for the farmer who can\nuse these new technologies more easily. Future control\
    \ rules and services using a machine learning\nplatform and AI paradigms will\
    \ allow to optimize and improve the results.\nAuthor Contributions: F.J.F.-P.\

  analysis: 'The paper titled "Estimating irrigation water use for maize in the Southeastern
    USA: A modeling approach" by Salazar et al. (2012) uses the Cropping System Model
    (CSM)-CERES-Maize model to simulate and estimate irrigation water use for maize
    in the southeastern United States. The model was evaluated for five counties that
    represent major maize production regions in Georgia, based on historical daily
    weather, soil profiles, and crop management data. To address the point in the
    literature review outline regarding types of data most applicable to irrigation
    management and their typical sources, the paper demonstrates the use of daily
    weather data (solar radiation, maximum and minimum air temperature, and rainfall)
    obtained from the Georgia Automated Environmental Monitoring Network (AEMN), soil
    characteristics from the USDA-NRCS online soil characterization database, and
    crop management information from the University of Georgia Cooperative Extension
    Service. The model was found to be able to simulate the amount of water required
    for maize irrigation in good agreement with observed data and was used to estimate
    monthly and annual water demand for maize for 88 counties in Georgia based on
    long-term historical weather data.

    Get rights and content Abstract Increased crop production and expansion of irrigated
    acreage in the southeastern USA have increased agricultural water use during the
    past two decades. To optimize irrigation water use, it is important to know when
    to irrigate and how much water should be applied. The objectives of this study
    were (1) to evaluate the Cropping System Model (CSM)-CERES-Maize model with measured
    data of the amount of water required for supplemental irrigation and (2) to apply
    the CSM-CERES-Maize model for estimating irrigation water use for maize in the
    southeastern USA. The CSM-CERES-Maize model was evaluated for 2000–2004 for five
    counties that represent the dominant maize production regions in South Georgia.
    For each county, historical daily weather data, three representative soil profiles,
    and specific crop management recommendations were used as input for the model.
    The simulated results were then compared with observed data obtained during the
    same period. The amount of water required for irrigation for each growing season
    was simulated for 58 years using historical weather data from 1950 to 2007 for
    88 selected counties that corresponded to the most important agricultural production
    region in Georgia. Both monthly and annual water demand for maize was determined
    for each county. The total seasonal amount of water required for irrigation across
    counties and years ranged from 136 to 281 mm, with an average of 227 mm. The irrigation
    requirements among months varied from 10 to 79 mm, with the highest amount required
    for May. The results from the evaluation showed that the model was able to simulate
    the amount of water required for maize irrigation in good agreement with the observed
    data. This demonstrated the potential application of the CSM-CERES-Maize model
    as a tool for estimating water demand for irrigation. The estimated water requirements
    for supplemental irrigation can be used by both policy makers and local farmers
    for planning the amount of water required for supplemental irrigation as well
    as for improvements in irrigation management for water conservation. Highlights
    ► Evaluation and application of CERES-Maize model were done to simulate irrigation.
    ► The model was able to simulate the amount of water required for maize irrigation.
    ► Results could benefit planning and improve irrigation water management conservation.

    simulation modelsWater useIrrigated maize 1. Introduction One of the main concerns
    for future irrigated agriculture is if there will be sufficient freshwater to
    supply the increasing requirements of both agricultural and non-agricultural consumers.
    Irrigated agriculture is perhaps one of the most important uses of water throughout
    the world. Almost 70% of the freshwater withdrawals in the world go toward irrigation
    uses (FAO, 2011). However, irrigation water faces increasing competition from
    non-agricultural sectors resulting in a global scarcity of freshwater (Faurès
    et al., 2000, FAO, 2011, Postel, 2001, USGS, 2009). In the United States, agriculture
    is a major user of both ground and surface water, accounting for 80% of the national
    consumptive water use and for over 90% in many western States (USDA, 2004). Historically,
    ground-water problems have been associated with major urban-industrial withdrawals,
    but irrigation development has attracted attention due to the measures that have
    been taken to enable improved management of water resources (Kundell, 2006). Irrigation
    management is a complex problem in the southeastern USA due to the high spatial
    and temporal variability of local weather conditions, especially rainfall. Similar
    to many regions around the world, irrigation in the southeastern USA is mainly
    supplemental during periods of drought, as rainfall varies during the crop growing
    season. Although the average annual precipitation is over 1300 mm in the southeastern
    USA (Nuti and Lamb, 2009, Lamb et al., 2011) the use of irrigation in the region
    has increased because of the uncertainty associated with rainfall distribution
    and crop stress by drought that potentially can cause a decrease in yield and
    production, irrigation is used to supplement precipitation during drought periods
    to sustain profitable crop production (Lamb et al., 2011). Maize is one of the
    crops that is commonly irrigated in Georgia and other southeastern states. Total
    acreage under irrigation in the region has grown considerably (Harrison, 2009).
    Estimates by both the Georgia-National Agricultural Statistics Service and the
    Cooperative Extension Service indicate that approximately 55% of maize in Georgia
    is irrigated (Lee, 2007a, Lee, 2007b). The total amount of water required for
    irrigation and the frequency of application varies as a function of the crop,
    management, cultivar selection, soil conditions and local weather conditions.
    Crops differ in their responses to water deficits at different growth stages and
    the amount of water used is closely associated with final crop biomass and grain
    yield (Whitty and Chambliss, 2002). The timing and amounts of rainfall during
    the season, the soil profile, texture, depth and the ability to hold water, as
    well as the crop water requirements are all factors which influence the need for
    irrigation. The decision making process by the producers also plays a key role
    in determining the final irrigation schedule and the decision of when to apply
    water and how much water to apply to the each individual field (Rhoads and Yonts,
    2000, Guerra et al., 2007). Decisions are dictated by each producer''s goal, design
    criteria, and strategy in combination with the water availability and rainfall.
    At the same time policy makers are currently evaluating different options to address
    water demand by agriculture and other sectors. However, they will have to use
    all tools that are available to address water issues to maximize its effective
    use, including crop simulation models and associated decision support systems,
    to make water use as a community resource efficient (Kundell, 2006, Mullen et
    al., 2009). Georgia''s future relies on the sustainable management and protection
    of the state''s limited water supplies. In February 2008, the Georgia General
    Assembly adopted the Georgia Comprehensive State-wide Water Plan, to “Guide Georgia
    in managing water resources in a sustainable manner” (EPD, 2009). The Environmental
    Protection Division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources has been charged
    with estimating both current and future water needs by agriculture for the major
    crops for effective planning. An initial component of this planning process is
    the estimation of current water use for irrigation and forecasted needs (Hook
    et al., 2005). During the last 30 years, crop modeling has been shown to be a
    valuable tool that can be used for a diverse range of applications in many countries
    (Hook, 1994, Garrison et al., 1999, Ruíz-Nogueira et al., 2001, López-Cedrón et
    al., 2008). However, most of these applications have focused on yield predictions
    based on alternate crop management practices for a range of different environments
    (Tsuji et al., 1998, Hoogenboom, 2000, Jones et al., 2003). In addition to yield
    predictions, crop simulation models can also be used with determining resource
    use such as the consumption of water by supplemental irrigation and to determine
    optimum irrigation management strategies (Guerra et al., 2005, Hook, 1994, Maxrobert
    and Savage, 1998, Nijbroek et al., 2003). The Decision Support System for Agrotechnology
    Transfer (DSSAT version 4.5) is a comprehensive system tool that facilitates the
    evaluation and application of crop models for a range of agricultural and environmental
    uses, such as yield and water use predictions (Tsuji et al., 1994, Jones et al.,
    2003, Hoogenboom et al., 2004, Hoogenboom et al., 2010). One of the main models
    of DSSAT includes the Cropping System Model (CSM)-CERES-Maize for the simulation
    of maize growth, development and yield (Jones and Kiniry, 1986, Ritchie et al.,
    1998, Jones et al., 2003). The CSM-CERES-Maize model has been evaluated extensively
    for simulating growth and yield for soil and weather conditions and management
    practices representing the southeastern USA. Studies conducted by Hook (1994)
    and Persson et al., 2009a, Persson et al., 2009b showed that the model predicted
    yield very for local conditions in the state of Georgia (Hook, 1994). In addition
    to predicting yield, CSM-CERES-Maize can be used as a tool for on-farm irrigation
    scheduling, using long-term and multi-year simulations. The CSM model has been
    applied widely for different environments and management practices, including
    irrigation, and has shown to provide good predictions under irrigated conditions
    (Kiniry and Bockholt, 1998, Tsuji et al., 1998, Jones et al., 2003, Panda et al.,
    2004). The CSM-CERES-Maize model simulates growth and development throughout the
    growing season starting at planting until final harvest. It includes detailed
    routines for simulating the soil and plant water and nitrogen dynamics. The model
    operates on a daily time step; the inputs required include daily weather data,
    crop management practices, and soil surface and soil profile parameters. The soil
    water balance of the CSM-CERES-Maize model is determined on a daily basis as a
    function of precipitation, irrigation, transpiration, soil evaporation, runoff,
    and drainage from the bottom of the profile. Soil water content is simulated for
    a one-dimensional soil profile based on fixed computational layers or the original
    soil horizons distributed into numerous layers with depth increments specified
    by the user (Ritchie and Godwin, 1989, Ritchie et al., 1998). Once the model has
    been evaluated for an environment, it can be used as a valuable tool for evaluating
    alternative crop management strategies (Hook, 1994, Boote et al., 1996, Boote
    et al., 2010, López-Cedrón et al., 2008, Tsuji et al., 1998).There are several
    causes for the variability in water requirement by maize. This includes soil type,
    which can vary even within a small area of cultivation and even within a field,
    rainfall, which also varies both spatially and temporally, crop management, including
    variety or cultivar, plant density, fertilization and planting date, which can
    vary among cycles. Several studies have been conducted on crop water requirements
    for maize based on its growth and development, in terms of amount and timing of
    application, but none that include both the interaction of environmental conditions
    and irrigation management practices. From 1999 to 2002 a study was conducted to
    monitor water use for supplemental irrigation across the state of Georgia for
    over 600 locations (Thomas et al., 2003, Hook et al., 2004, Hook et al., 2005).
    Although this study provided good results, it was limited with respect to developing
    strategies for policy making due to the fact that complete were only available
    for three years. The overall goal of this study was to determine water requirements
    for supplemental irrigation during periods of drought following the mandate expressed
    by the state of Georgia through its first Comprehensive Georgia State-wide Water
    Management Plan. The specific objectives include (1) to evaluate the performance
    of CSM-CERES-Maize simulation model for predicting water use for irrigation and
    (2) to apply the CSM-CERES-Maize model for estimating irrigation water use for
    maize in the southeastern USA in order to develop strategies for water use planning.
    2. Materials and methods 2.1. Site selection and observed data Five of the top
    producing counties for maize in Georgia were selected. These include the counties
    of Baker, Miller, Mitchell, Seminole and Terrell which are located in the major
    irrigated region of Georgia (USDA-NASS, 2007; CES 2009). Data obtained from the
    Agricultural Water Pumping project (AWP), which was a program designed to determine
    agricultural water use by irrigation for the major crops across the entire state
    of Georgia and conducted during 2000–2004 (Thomas et al., 2003, Hook et al., 2004,
    Hook et al., 2005) were used for model evaluation. The data available from the
    AWP comprised one hundred and sixty three (163) monitoring sites for the selected
    counties during the period of study (Table 1). The monitoring data set included
    detailed data on monthly water use for irrigation. However, general crop information
    was limited due the large number of sites that were monitored. Table 1. The weather
    station that was used for each county and the total number of AgWaterPumping sites
    that were monitored in the counties that were used for model evaluation. County

    and soil data For each county the daily weather data were obtained from the nearest
    weather station of the Georgia Automated Environmental Monitoring Network (AEMN;
    www.Georgiaweather.net) (Table 1). The daily records that were used included solar
    radiation, maximum and minimum air temperature, and rainfall. Each county had
    one to four different soil associations. A soil association is a group of soils
    that has a distinctive proportional pattern of soils and that are geographically
    related. It normally consists of one or more major soils and at least one minor
    soil, and it is named for the major soils. The associations were identified using
    GIS techniques and soil maps (USDA-Natural Resources Conservation Service (USDA-NRCS)).
    Each association was composed of three soil types. For counties with only one
    soil association, the profile information for all three soils was obtained. For
    counties with two associations, the dominant profile information from each association
    was used, while the third profile was from either of the two associations or from
    the nearest neighboring soil profile. For counties with three to four associations,
    three soil profiles representing the three associations were selected (Table 2).
    The county-extent of each soil type was extracted from the spatial and tabular
    data STATSGO (2006). The data from STATSGO data have some limitations for crop
    modeling applications due to the fact that the soil profile information is not
    always sufficient (Perkins, 1987). The online soil characterization database of
    the USDA-NRCS (http://ssldata.nrcs.usda.gov), which provides an excellent source
    of soil profile data, was used to extract the soil surface and profile characteristics
    for each soil. The main characteristics that were extracted for each soil layer
    included soil texture, soil water content at field capacity (cm3 cm−3) and permanent
    wilting point (cm3 cm−3), saturated soil water content (cm3 cm−3), saturated hydraulic
    conductivity (cm h−1), bulk density (g cm−3), organic carbon (%), total nitrogen
    (%), pH, cation exchange capacity (cmol kg−1). The program Sbuild, a tool distributed
    with DSSAT version 4 (Hoogenboom et al., 2004), was used to estimate the missing
    soil data. Table 2. The three representative soil types that were used in the

    Clay 2.3. General crop management Detailed data on planting date, the main growth
    and development stage, yield and yield components were not collected in the AWP
    study. Therefore, general crop management information for maize provided through
    the University of Georgia Cooperative Extension Service (Lee, 2007a, Lee, 2007b)
    and general crop information from the USDA-National Agricultural Statistics Service
    (USDA-NASS, 2007) were used. It was assume that these management practices represent
    the normal practices used by maize growers in Georgia. The hybrid that was selected
    for simulations was PIO31G98 and the planting date that was used was March 15.
    The plant population was set at 7 plants m2, row spacing was 0.90 m and the planting
    depth was 0.05 m. Nitrogen fertilizer was applied at preplant in the amount of
    118 kg N/ha and 160 kg N/ha as side dress in two applications at 30 and 45 days
    after planting. 2.4. Irrigation management Irrigation management was simulated
    using the irrigation module of the CSM-CERES-Maize model. The model checks plant
    extractable soil water for a specific irrigation depth as defined by the user
    on a daily basis following detailed calculations of the soil water balance. Based
    on the observed water pumping data and the recommendations of the UGA Cooperative
    Extension Service (http://www.caes.uga.edu/extension), a fixed amount of 25 mm
    was applied whenever irrigation was necessary based on the irrigation threshold
    settings (IT = 60%). The application of a fixed amount emulated the common center
    pivot or linear irrigation systems. Irrigation efficiency was set at 75%. A sensitivity
    analysis was conducted previously for maize using the data that were collected
    in the AWP study. The crop-specific irrigation depth was set at 35 cm (ID = 0.35
    m) and irrigation threshold was set at 60% (IT = 60%). The same values for ID
    and IT were used for all counties. Based on the observed data it was also assumed
    that a small amount of irrigation was applied at planting in order to provide
    a uniform plant stand for germination and emergence. The CSM-CERES-Maize model
    applies water whenever irrigation is needed based on the irrigation threshold
    value and soil depth as defined by the user. 2.5. Model evaluation To evaluate
    the suitability of the CSM-CERES model for simulating supplemental water demand
    for maize irrigation in Georgia, simulations were conducted for five years from
    2000 to 2004 for comparison with the data collected by the AWP project. A regression
    analysis between the simulated and observed values was performed, and the Index
    of Agreement (d; Willmott et al., 1985) and the root square for mean square error
    were calculated (RMSE; Loague and Green, 1991, Gabrielle et al., 1995). Descriptive
    statistics were performed for each county by month and season using SAS version
    9.2 (SAS Inst, 2009). 2.6. Model application Following the evaluation of the model
    and based on the fact that no detailed observed or monitoring data were available
    for projections at a county level, a modeling approach was used. The inter-annual
    variation and the seasonal variability of the total amount of water required for
    supplemental irrigation for maize was estimated for 88 counties based on long-term
    simulations using the seasonal analysis tool of DSSAT (Thornton et al., 1994)
    and historical weather data from 1950 through 2007. The simulations were started
    on January 1 of each year in order to obtain a stable soil water balance prior
    to planting. The 1950s were included due to significant droughts during that period
    (NOAA, 2006). For the long-term simulations, the daily rainfall and maximum and
    minimum air temperature for each county were obtained from the National Weather
    Service (NWS) Cooperative Observer Program (COOP) network as compiled by the Center
    for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies (COAPS), through the Southeast Climate
    Consortium (SEClimate.org). The daily solar radiation was generated from the observed
    daily air temperatures and rainfall using the Weather Generator for Solar Radiation
    (WGENR) (Hodges et al., 1985), as modified and evaluated by Garcia y Garcia and
    Hoogenboom (2005) and Garcia y Garcia et al. (2008). For each county, the daily
    outputs of the model were used to determine the monthly and seasonal irrigation
    amounts for each soil type and each growing season. The outputs for the overall
    simulated irrigation were analyzed using descriptive statistics for each county
    and for each soil profile. The percentile distributions of water demand for irrigation
    were used as an indicator of the type of year with respect to the total amount
    of water used. The driest and wettest years were determined using 20% of the highest
    and lowest values of simulated water demand for irrigation, respectively. It was
    assumed that values less than the 20th percentile (P20) represented the wettest
    years, while the values greater than the 80th percentile (P80) represented the
    driest years, while the values between the 20th and 40th and 60th and 80th percentile
    represented the normal wet and normal dry years, respectively. Values between
    the 40th and 60th, e.g. around the 50th percentile (P50), were assumed to represent
    normal years. For these statistical analyses SAS 9.2 (SAS Inst, 2009) was used.
    3. Results and discussion 3.1. Model evaluation The CSM-CERES-Maize model was
    able to simulate the amount of water required for maize irrigation during the
    growing season in good agreement with observed data that were obtained from the
    AWP study. The regression analysis showed that the slope of the linear regression
    was statistically different from one (P = 0.038) and that the intercept was statistically
    equal to zero. This indicated that, on average, the model overestimated the observed
    values for irrigations that were less than 35 mm by 2.9 mm, which mainly occurred
    during the beginning of the growing season (March). Otherwise, the model underestimated
    the observed value, on average, by 0.7 mm, which is relatively insignificant.
    The Willmott d-index was 0.98, the root mean square error (RMSE) was 7.2 mm and
    the coefficient of determination (r2) between the simulated and observed data
    was 0.79. Despite the bias of the simulated values, these combined statistics
    indicated a good agreement between the simulated and observed water use data and
    this evaluation ensured that the simulated values were within an acceptable range
    of the observed data (Fig. 1). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Regression
    between simulated and observed total monthly irrigation for the five counties
    that were evaluated for the period 2000–2004. Monthly total rainfall and the total
    amount of water applied for irrigation were compared with the simulated amounts
    for maize for the 2002–2004 growing seasons. Rainfall was generally low in May
    for all counties considered in the evaluation (Fig. 2). There was an increase
    in the amount of irrigation applied from the beginning of the season in March
    to mid-season in May and a decrease from June to the end of the season in July.
    The total amount for observed irrigation during the growing season ranged from
    163.3 to 314.5 mm (Table 3). The highest total monthly irrigation (101.2 mm) was
    observed in May, this is a critical time during the growing season when grains
    are being filled and with a high sensitivity to water deficit, so it would be
    expected that irrigation for maize should be higher to avoid drought stress (Guerra
    et al., 2007). For most of the months there was a close agreement between the
    simulated and observed total amount of water required for irrigation. Nevertheless,
    there was a strong variability among the individual farmers’ fields. This was
    due to differences in decision making by the farmers with respect to irrigation,
    including when to irrigate and how much water to apply, crop management especially
    planting date and varietal characteristics, local weather conditions and local
    soil type. In the AWP project only the type of crop and total amount of water
    pumped was recorded, and, unfortunately, no other information with respect to
    local weather conditions, especially rainfall, soil conditions and crop management
    was collected due to the large number of fields that were monitored across the
    state. The results of the analysis showed that the simulations were within the
    acceptable range of the observed values. It can, therefore, be concluded that
    the CSM-CERES-Maize model can be used for estimating the water requirements for

    The water use projections for irrigation were simulated for the growing season
    for maize from 1950 to 2007. The seasonal irrigation demand showed that there
    was an increasing trend in the amount of irrigation required from the beginning
    of the season in March (10.3 mm) to the mid-season in May with an average of 79.2
    mm, followed by a decrease from June (77.1 mm) to the end of the season in July
    (45.1 mm) (Fig. 3). May had the highest amount of water required for irrigation
    across the 58 years. The most critical period for irrigating maize started approximately
    one to two weeks after silking, which is approximately 56 days after emergency
    for a crop that takes approximately 125 days to reach maturity. At this stage
    a large reduction in yield will result due to moisture and nutrient stress compared
    to any other period during the growing season. During this period when grain filling
    occurs the exact effect of water deficits depends on its timing with respect to
    the stage of the crop and its duration. Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    3. Mean simulated seasonal water demand for corn irrigation. The daily outputs
    of the model were used to determine the seasonal water requirements for irrigation
    at a county level (Fig. 4) for each of the three soil types (Fig. 5). The map
    represents the 88 counties where maize growth, development, and yield was simulated
    and the amount of water shown by county represents an average of the simulations
    of the three representative soils and fifty eight (58) years of simulation (Fig.
    4). The amount of water required for supplemental irrigation clearly varies by
    county, ranging from 136 to 281 (mm). Similarly, the effect of irrigation on the
    soils profiles was analyzed with cumulative probability function and effectively
    represents the seasonal water requirement for maize in five selected counties
    where the crop growth, the results reflect variability among soils and among counties
    (Fig. 5).Total seasonal water use ranged from 118 mm to 323.2 mm while the average
    across all 58 years was 227.3 mm (Table 4). Previous studies in Georgia showed
    that maize requires approximately 635 mm of net water from rainfall and irrigation
    combined to obtain a high yield (Endale et al., 2009). In other regions of the
    USA total maize water use ranges for 711 mm per year in the southwest, to 609
    mm in the east of Nebraska (Kranz et al., 2008). Studies in North Dakota have
    shown water needs, including both rainfall and supplemental irrigation, ranged
    from 457 mm to 609 mm during most of the growing seasons to achieve maximum yield
    (Scherer, 1997). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Average simulated

    normal wet, normal, normal dry and driest years for corn production were identified
    based on the simulated irrigation requirements for maize (Table 4). This analysis
    showed that the five wettest years in descending order were 1989, 2005, 1975,
    2003 and 1991. The five driest years were 2007, 1998, 1988, 1977 and 1986. Due
    to both the temporal and spatial rainfall variability across the state, 1991 was
    considered one of the wettest years, in contrast to 1986 which has been reported
    as the worst drought years in Georgia (Armbruster, 1989). The results of the analysis
    indicate that there was a satisfactory agreement between the measured and simulated
    values. The outcomes of this study have been integrated into Georgia''s state-wide-water
    plan for sustainable management of water resources through 2050 (EPD/DNR, 2009).
    The goal of this plan is to develop forecasts for water use requirements for irrigation
    that will meet the needs of the agricultural sector for the Georgia economy during
    the first half of this century until 2050. The demand projections were computed
    based on the outcomes of the crop simulation studies, including the one reported
    here with the model CSM-CERES-Maize for maize and economic drivers for the potential
    crops to be planted in the future. This showed that the outcomes of this study
    can be used for both policy makers for planning the amount of water required for
    supplemental irrigation as well as for farmers for improvements in irrigation
    management for water conservation. Acknowledgements This study was conducted under

  title: 'Estimating irrigation water use for maize in the Southeastern USA: A modeling
    approach'
  verbatim_quote1: '"TheCSM-CERES-Maize model simulated the amount of water required
    for maize irrigation during the growing season in good agreement with observed
    data that were obtained from the AWP study. The regression analysis showed that
    the slope of the linear regression was statistically different from one (P = 0.038)
    and that the intercept was statistically equal to zero. This indicated that, on
    average, the model overestimated the observed values for irrigations that were
    less than 35 mm by 2.9 mm, which mainly occurred during the beginning of the growing
    season (March). Otherwise, the model underestimated the observed value, on average,
    by 0.7 mm, which is relatively insignificant. The Willmott d-index was 0.98, the
    root mean square error (RMSE) was 7.2 mm and the coefficient of determination
    (r2) between the simulated and observed data was 0.79."'
  verbatim_quote2: '"The results of the analysis showed that the simulations were
    within the acceptable range of the observed values. It can, therefore, be concluded
    that the CSM-CERES-Maize model can be used for estimating the water requirements
    for supplemental irrigation for maize."'

    \ justiﬁes the incorporation and\nadaptation of the latest technologies. Nowadays,\
    \ managing crops is possible through Internet-based\ntechnologies. Their application\
    \ allows for the exploitation of information and the development of\nisolated\
    \ applications, which, although powerful, create challenges for obtaining scalable\
    \ predictions\nthroughout the useful life of farms. To address this problem, a\
    \ data model was deﬁned to improve\nthe management of crop plots in irrigation\
    \ communities and simultaneously monitor crop needs.\nConsequently, the objective\
    \ of this study was to create an open and interoperable platform based on\nstandard\
    \ interfaces and protocols to enable the integration of heterogeneous sources\
    \ of information,\nwhile ensuring interoperability with other third-party solutions\
    \ for exchanging and exploiting such\ninformation. Standard and open interfaces\
    \ and protocols form the basis of the platform, thereby\nunifying all information\
    \ in a single data model, which facilitates the better use and dissemination of\n\
    information. The system was fully instantiated in a real prototype in an irrigation\
    \ community; the\nsoftware improved water irrigation management for the farmers\
    \ connected to the platform.\nKeywords: IoT platform; data model; smart agriculture;\

    1. Introduction\nSociety is characterized by uncertainty and constant technological\
    \ changes. The productive sectors\nthat are more digitized tend to improve their\
    \ productivity faster than those that are less digitized.\nIrrigation farming\
    \ communities have beneﬁted for many years from the use of information and\ncommunications\
    \ technology (ICT), which allows them to improve the current agricultural development,\n\
    facilitate the fulﬁllment of daily tasks, and convert farms into efﬁcient and\
    \ sustainable production\nsystems. The use of these new technologies not only\
    \ enables the digital transformation process\ndemanded by the sector, but also\
    \ supports irrigation communities and other farming groups with tools\nfor analysis\
    \ and prediction, improving optimization.\nThe digital transformation and continuous\
    \ technological advances that are currently occurring,\ne.g., the Internet of\
    \ Things (IoT) [1], big data, cloud computing [2], artiﬁcial intelligence, and\
    \ aerial\nimages [3] to name a few, are providing the agricultural sector with\
    \ new tools that help determine\nthe real needs of farms and improve their efﬁciency.\
    \ Speciﬁcally, the use of the IoT has changed the\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153; doi:10.3390/s20041153\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n2 of 20\ntraditional paradigm\
    \ regarding access to and the management of sensors and actuators, making\nall\
    \ objects accessible through the Internet, and transferring the management and\
    \ integration of\ninformation and real knowledge into the digital world [4].\n\
    This transformation has produced\nimprovements compared to the techniques traditionally\
    \ used [5], allowing new mechanisms to help in\nthe management of farms. These\
    \ advantages are mainly focused on the following:\n•\nProblem detection: The implementation\
    \ of new technologies such as satellite images, variable\napplication algorithms,\
    \ drones, high-tech sensors, mobile applications, and GPS guides, allowing\nfor\
    \ the assessment of crop status and the detection of problems (improper fertilizer\
    \ use, water\nstress, changing weather conditions, and pest monitoring) before\
    \ they start to interfere with\ncrop performance;\n•\nProductivity improvement:\
    \ The sensorization of crops allows for the establishment of patterns of\nplanting\
    \ and fertilization depending on factors such as the type of seeds and soil conditions,\
    \ to\nimprove crop production levels;\n•\nImprovement in decision making: By analyzing\
    \ and monitoring agronomic parameters, crop water\nneeds, and precipitation forecasts,\
    \ it is possible to identify which areas of land need more water\nand schedule\
    \ irrigation to vary the volume of water applied without imposing water stress\
    \ on\nthe crop;\n•\nBehaviour analysis: As a result of continuous crop monitoring\
    \ and the analysis of the relationships\namong different elements, such as yield,\
    \ energy efﬁciency, and the agricultural practices used, the\nmost beneﬁcial actions\
    \ and those that must be eliminated or modiﬁed can be identiﬁed.\nMotivated by\
    \ the digital transformation, the agricultural sector is providing its farms with\
    \ new\ndevices and services (sensors, actuators, weather information, drones,\
    \ and satellite images) that allow\nfor the optimization of the resources, to\
    \ improve productivity and simultaneously reduce the impact\non the environment.\
    \ For the digital transformation of the agricultural sector, a common integration\n\
    framework is needed that uniﬁes the entire dataset, so that new services are generated\
    \ according to\nthe needs of the sector. The data generated by the farms are crucial\
    \ and have to be part of a unique\nsemantic model that organizes and evaluates\
    \ all the data collected.\nAt the European level, an open initiative, FIWARE [6],\
    \ offers a framework using a set of standard\nand open Application Programming\
    \ Interfaces (APIs) based on Next Generation Service Interface\n(NGSI), promoted\
    \ by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA), or Next Generation Service Interfaces\nwith\
    \ Linked Data (NGSI-LD) [7], promoted by ETSI Industry Speciﬁcation Group for\
    \ Context\nInformation Management (ETSI ISG CIM), to deﬁne a universal set of\
    \ standards based on the contextual\nmanagement of the data. Therefore, adhering\
    \ the standards and abandoning the code and proprietary\ntechnologies can contribute\
    \ to improving the competitiveness of the agricultural sector. In a world\nwhere\
    \ everything is connected, isolated solutions have no place. By contrast, interoperability\
    \ must be\nthe cornerstone feature that all solutions adopt, thus contributing\
    \ to a more productive environment\nwhere information is exchanged for a greater\
    \ good. The proposed solution is a platform that allows\nfor the integration of\
    \ different suppliers’ devices, and implements standards and open interfaces and\n\
    data models based on NGSI-LD. Additionally, the platform exploits the stored information\
    \ to analyze,\nin real time, the factors associated with the production process,\
    \ the evolution of the crops, and the\noptimal use of water for irrigation. The\
    \ core features the platform are as follows:\n1.\nScalability and ﬂexibility:The\
    \ platform, instead of being locked to a single provider, is up to date\nwith\
    \ protocols, technologies, and features that vary rapidly. It is network-independent\
    \ and can be\nintegrated to work with all vital technological systems;\n2.\nInteroperable:\
    \ The platform offers a wide range of IoT agents that facilitate the connection\
    \ with\ndevices that use standardized IoT protocols, such as Lightweight Machine\
    \ to Machine (LWM2M)\nover Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), JavaScript\
    \ Object Notation (JSON), or UltraLight\n(UL) over HTTP/MQTT, with the possibility\
    \ of using parameterizing agents to integrate any\nother type of future protocols.\
    \ At the application level, the platform is open to integration with\nother third-party\
    \ platforms using both API and data model based on NGSI-LD.\nSensors 2020, 20,\
    \ 1153\n3 of 20\n3.\nSemantic enrichment: The use of the data model to homogenize\
    \ the management of the different\nelements that are part of a farm;\n4.\nEfﬁciency\
    \ and competitiveness: The model allows precise and timely decisions to be made\
    \ in terms\nof management and agricultural processes. The ability to automatically\
    \ document the health\nstatus of the crop or natural resources provides an efﬁcient\
    \ and effective diagnosis technique\nfor managers.\nThe remainder of this paper\
    \ is structured as follows: In Section 2, the proposed solution is\nintroduced,\
    \ detailing the most unique elements. Section 3 outlines the deployment in a community\n\
    of irrigators. Section 4 shows the evaluation of the system at different levels\
    \ of implementation and\nthe results obtained. Finally, in Section 5, the conclusion\
    \ and new proposals based in these results\nare described.\n1.1. Information Models\
    \ Applied to Agriculture\nThe data collected by all connected devices are characterized\
    \ by scalability, heterogeneity,\nand dynamism:\n•\nScalability: Millions of sensors\
    \ continuously generating large amounts of information;\n•\nHeterogeneity: There\
    \ is a wide variety of sensors;\n•\nDynamism: The high speed of generation produced\
    \ the need to generate data models that allow\nfor better use and dissemination\
    \ of the information from these devices.\nGiven the above factors, interoperability\
    \ mechanisms must be generated that allow for the\nintegration of different devices,\
    \ applications, or platforms to ﬁlter the vast amounts of information\nthat many\
    \ systems are producing [8]. The shared data models are useful as they are essential\
    \ resources\nthat improve the communication, knowledge recovery, and interoperability\
    \ of information systems to\ndevelop better applications for the agri-food sector\
    \ [9].\nToday, different data models are available; many of them were developed\
    \ by the organizations\nin charge of developing their standards. The Open Geospatial\
    \ Consortium (OGC) data models are\nused primarily in geosciences and environmental\
    \ domains, including the SensorThings API, based on\nthe Observations and Measurements\
    \ (O&M) data model (OGC/ISO 19156:2011), which transforms\nthe numerous unconnected\
    \ IoT systems into a fully connected platform where complex tasks can\nbe performed\
    \ and synchronized. The Open Connectivity Foundation speciﬁes data models based\n\
    on vertical industries such as the automotive, healthcare, industrial, and smart\
    \ home sectors. The\nWorld Wide Web Consortium Thing Description provides some\
    \ vocabularies to describe real things\nbut does not focus much on the data. Other\
    \ vocabularies, such as those offered by the INSPIRE\ndirective [10], deﬁne the\
    \ rules on the interoperability of spatial data sets and their associated services;\n\
    these are mandatory.\nCurrently, some resources speed up the data modeling of\
    \ a speciﬁc location or sector. In the ﬁeld\nof agriculture, Drury et al. [11]\
    \ presented different types of tools to help us develop this task:\n•\nControlled\
    \ vocabulary (a set of preselected terms or words for a speciﬁc domain): An example\n\
    is AGROVOC vocabulary, promoted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the\
    \ United\nNations (FAO) and available in multiple languages.\n•\nMiscellaneous\
    \ ontologies: Crop Ontology, AgroPortal, Dairy Farming Ontology (DFO), AgOnt,\n\
    CIARD Ring, and Vest.\n•\nData exchange standards: AgriOpenLink, AgroXML, and\
    \ AgroRDF; speciﬁc ontologies: SSN (for\nsensor discovery) and Cotton Ontology\
    \ (diseases and pests that affect cotton).\nThe basis of many decisions is the\
    \ uniformity of architectures, and ETSI ISG CIM provides the\ncorrect interfaces\
    \ (006 V1.1.1 (2019-07)) and context information management (CIM) and allows for\
    \ the\nuniﬁed representation of the information through next generation service\
    \ interfaces with linked data\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n4 of 20\n(NGSI-LD) [12].\
    \ This reduces the time and resources required for the management of daily tasks\
    \ and\nfor the improvement of the productivity and beneﬁts.\nA diverse range of\
    \ ontological models are available for the IoT, developed with different\nobjectives\
    \ [13,14] that describe various areas, such as Fiesta-IoT ontology, which reuses\
    \ the results\nof projects and current EU strategies in semantic web technologies,\
    \ such as OpenIoT, DUL, VITAL,\nSpitﬁre, IoT-O, IoT-A, IoT-Lite, and Sensei. One\
    \ recent ontology, which is promoted by the ETSI\nSmartM2M Technical Committee,\
    \ is the Smart Appliances REFerence (SAREF) ontology, a shared\nmodel of consensus\
    \ that facilitates the matching of existing assets in the smart appliances domain\
    \ and\nallows for the separation and recombination of different parts of the ontology\
    \ according to speciﬁc\nneeds. For the agricultural ﬁeld, the SAREF4AGRI version\
    \ [15] was created to provide services for\nanimal husbandry, intelligent irrigation,\
    \ and the integration of multiple data sources to provide support\nservices for\
    \ decision making.\nSome models are promoted by public administrations, such as\
    \ the standardized water\nmanagement model applied to irrigation model (MEGA)\
    \ [16], an initiative of the Ministry of\nAgriculture of Spain, included in the\
    \ ISO 21622 standard and managed by TRAGSA Group. The\npurpose of MEGA is to establish\
    \ a standardized model that, when applied to irrigation, allows for\ninteroperability\
    \ between different systems that coexist in the same facility and thus to efﬁciently\n\
    manage irrigation water use. The introduction of the standardized model improves\
    \ how the irrigation\nschedules and the requirements of the control systems are\
    \ speciﬁed, establishing a clear separation\nbetween decision making and execution.\n\
    1.2. IoT Solutions in the Agricultural Sector\nMultiple problems exist in the\
    \ domain of agriculture, such as irrigation, the application of\npesticides and\
    \ fertilizers, and the monitoring of crops, land, and livestock. Different researchers\
    \ are\nworking to provide the best possible solutions:\n•\nImprovements in productivity:Through\
    \ the sensorization of crops to provide values in real time,\nthe farmer can apply\
    \ irrigation, pesticides, and fertilizers only when they are needed. For example,\n\
    Araby et al. [17] proposed the integration of the IoT and machine learning to\
    \ predict diseases\nin horticultural crops before they appear, allowing the farmer\
    \ to apply the necessary defense\nmechanisms, thus improving productivity and\
    \ reducing the use of pesticides. Trilles et al. [18]\npresented a low-cost sensor-equipped\
    \ platform, SEenviro, which applies a disease model for alert\nmanagement in vineyards;\n\
    •\nDetection of undetected problems: Using satellite images or drones, harmful\
    \ agronomic factors,\npreviously untreated, can be detected and mapped in crops\
    \ using remote-sensing techniques. For\nexample, De Rango et al. [19] monitored\
    \ crops using the images provided by a drone to see if they\nhad parasites and\
    \ to decide if subsequent treatment was necessary, representing a new technique\n\
    for the coordination and control of the drone ﬂeet in precision agriculture (PA);\n\
    •\nMonitoring the behavior of plants: Through the use of artiﬁcial intelligence\

    \ in areas with water deﬁcits. Another\nproject to be considered, also based on\
    \ FIWARE, is the SWAMP platform [23]. Its primary objective\nis to develop innovative\

    \ Transport (MQTT) communications were used, with NGSIs being used as a\nmeans\

    \ both the\nconditions established in a greenhouse and the behavior of plants\

    IoT platforms can be considered the backbone of any industrial sector that wants\
    \ to provide its\nactivity with a smart component. These platforms collect and\
    \ store data in a distributed database for\nthe ﬁltering, analysis, calculation,\
    \ decision making, management, translation, and visualization of data\nin new\
    \ services. Several analyses of the different types of platforms for the integration\
    \ of IoT services\nand their characteristics can be found, such as that provided\
    \ by Silva et al. [26], although a results\ncomparison is difﬁcult because of\
    \ the lack of standardization.\n2. Proposed System\nThis article proposes an open\
    \ and interoperable platform for irrigation community management.\nThe platform,\
    \ based on standard and open interfaces and protocols, allows for the integration\
    \ of\nheterogeneous information sources as well as interoperability with other\
    \ third-party solutions for\nexchanging and exploiting this information. Additionally,\
    \ this platform exploits the stored information\nto analyze, in real time, the\
    \ factors associated with the production process, the evolution of crops, and\n\
    the optimal use of water for irrigation.\n2.1. Proposed Data Model\nAs a result\
    \ of the lack of the compatibility necessary to manage the large amount of data\
    \ generated\nby the agricultural sector, agricultural managers must be provided\
    \ with standardized information\nmodels that permit farmers to make the best possible\
    \ decisions, allowing them to take advantage of\nthe available data and knowledge.\
    \ Therefore, a data model is proposed here that ﬁts the functional\nrequirements\
    \ of the users.\nThe proposed data model is based on interviews with farmers,\
    \ responsible technicians, and farm\nmanagers about the useful and necessary information\
    \ that should be managed on a farm. The existing\nmodels are too specialized;\
    \ although they cover the information that needs to be managed, their\nimplementation\
    \ is time-consuming. Therefore, we decided to develop a new model that would meet\n\
    the needs of our users.\nConceptually, the model presented is based on the proposed\
    \ by FIWARE harmonized data\nmodels [27], speciﬁcally, the AgriFood model that\
    \ includes requirements for irrigation and crop control.\nThe model was constructed\
    \ as an agile tool to respond to the requirements farmers allowing them\nto characterize\
    \ the plots, reduce the hydric needs of the crops, and control the soil and water\
    \ quality\nand the associated atmospheric conditions. This ﬁrst version of the\
    \ model focuses on the efﬁcient\nmanagement of the crop plots and all the included\
    \ elements, as can be seen in the class diagram in\nFigure 1.\nThe proposed data\
    \ model focuses on the management of crop plots represented by the AgriPlot\n\
    entity, which is part of an agricultural holding, represented by the AgriExploitation\
    \ entity. The plot is\ncharacterized by four pillars that allow it to be uniquely\
    \ deﬁned:\n•\nDevices, represented by AgriDevice, are the devices that provide\
    \ information to the plot and are\nclassiﬁed based on the parameters studied:\
    \ AgriDSoil, those that obtain soil values (soil moisture\nprobes, temperature\
    \ and soil dissolution); AgriPlant, those that measure the evolution of the crop\n\
    (leaf/trunk diameter, stem water potential, and dendrometers); and AgriAtmosphere,\
    \ which are\nthe devices that record the atmospheric conditions (temperature,\
    \ humidity, radiation, and wind\nspeed). These data are used to optimize agricultural\
    \ decisions;\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n6 of 20\n•\nWater, represented by AgriWater,\
    \ indicates the type of water used and the parameters that affect\nirrigation.\
    \ AgriAnalysis manages the water analysis conducted at different points of the\
    \ water\ndistribution network of the farm. These analyses are usually necessary\
    \ for fertilization and\nirrigation, since they describe the quality and quantity\
    \ of nutrients carried by the water;\n•\nSoil, represented by AgriSoil, indicates\
    \ the type of soil present in the plot. This entity can be more\ndetailed by indicating\
    \ the AgriHorizon, which includes the different characteristics of the layers\n\
    (horizons) that deﬁne the ground;\n•\nCultivation, represented by AgriCrop, deﬁnes\
    \ the crop and the variety, AgriVariety, with which the\nplot is associated. The\
    \ crop is determined by the different phenological phases that determine its\n\
    growth; AgriPhenology provides the crop coefﬁcients and their duration over time.\
    \ The phenology\nis determined by the variety of the crop and the climatic zone,\
    \ AgriZone since the zone inﬂuences\nthe optimal climatic conditions for the development\
    \ of the crops.\nAnother feature to be considered is the Aerial Images management,\
    \ represented by the AgriScene\nentity, including images or scenes from any satellite\
    \ or drone; these scenes are composed of bands,\nAgriBand, of different wavelengths.\
    \ In turn, these bands can generate derivative products, AgriProduct,\nafter processing,\
    \ such as mosaics (adding two or more adjacent scenes) or indices of vegetation\
    \ or\nwater, useful for detecting problems in the ﬁelds.\nFigure 1. Speciﬁc data\
    \ model for agricultural plot management.\nThe main feature of the IoT-based interoperability\
    \ mechanisms is the possibility of exchanging\ninformation homogeneously in different\
    \ systems or applications. One of the elements that enables this\ncontinuous exchange\
    \ of information is the use of data models. To acquire more signiﬁcant value,\
    \ the\nspeciﬁc vocabulary of the sector must be uniﬁed, which is deﬁned by the\
    \ set of attributes that compose\nthe entities and their relationships [28]. As\
    \ NGSI-LD allows us to link data from other vocabularies or\nontologies, we added\
    \ a level of interoperability to the model. For these reasons, the use of information\n\
    models is considered beneﬁcial to allow for the integration of any device or characteristic\
    \ element of\nthe study sector.\nIn Section 3.2, an instantiation of this model\
    \ is provided using NGSI-LD. The advantages of the\nuse of NGSI-LD concerning\
    \ NGSI are as follows:\n•\nThe information model is based on graphs and focuses\
    \ on information. The concept of Relation\nappears. Entities can have properties\
    \ and relations. Instances of each of the entities can be the\nobject of the properties\
    \ or relationships;\n•\nAll data types in NGSI-LD can be associated with unique\
    \ Uniform Resource Identiﬁer (URI)\ncorresponding to well-established semantic\
    \ identiﬁers;\n•\nIt allows one to make references to vocabularies: all terms\
    \ are deﬁned unequivocally. This allows\nusers to refer to their information deﬁnitions;\n\
    •\nThe model and query language is more constrained;\n•\nThe use of JSON-LD allows\
    \ us to operate with linked data to unify vocabularies;\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n\
    7 of 20\n•\nThere were syntactic differences: the metadata dictionary is no longer\
    \ needed, GeoProperty is\nused instead of geo:json, JSON-LD @context is included,\
    \ TemporalProperty is used instead of\nDateTime, and an “object” ﬁeld is used\
    \ to encode the relation target.\n2.2. System Architecture\nSince the new IoT\
    \ devices and the new communications technologies provide the user with\nfaster\
    \ and more efﬁcient communication, we propose an affordable platform, independent\
    \ of the\nprovider and interoperable, as the cornerstone for all connections between\
    \ applications/services\nand the irrigation elements. In this way, we offer a\
    \ common framework so that applications can\ninteract with any aspect that is\
    \ part of a farm in a similar way, while being able to act on any device\nor controller\
    \ using the same set of instructions, thus allowing for greater interoperability\
    \ between\ndifferent manufacturers or services.\nThe architecture of the platform\
    \ proposed in this paper is depicted in Figure 2. It has a layered\nmodular form\
    \ ranging from the deployment of sensors and the monitoring of techniques for\
    \ data\nextraction to the intelligent processing of data. Each of these layers\
    \ is based on open and standard\ninitiatives, such as the one provided by the\
    \ FIWARE community [29] or the ETSI ISG CIM group.\nFigure 2. General vision of\
    \ the proposed architecture.\nThe ﬁrst layer, Device and Data Acquisition, represents\
    \ the different sources of information that form\nthe system; these include sensors,\
    \ actuators, open information available on the Internet, and databases\nwith updated\
    \ information of interest. These devices employ different communication technologies\n\
    to transmit information to an IoT Backend module formed by IoT Agents. This module\
    \ acts as an\nintermediary with the second layer and transforms information unidirectionally\
    \ or bidirectionally\n(in the case of actuators), allowing the IoT devices to\
    \ interact with the platform.\nA speciﬁc module is required because of the restrictions\
    \ imposed by the modules on the processing\ncapacity, memory, and even the available\
    \ power to these devices. These restrictions usually prevent\nthem from using\
    \ heavy protocols at the application level, so they use lightweight protocols\
    \ such as\nCoAP or MQTT or integrate other solutions such as LoRa and Sigfox to\
    \ perform communications\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n8 of 20\nwith the different\
    \ devices through Ethernet or mobile networks (e.g., GPRS/3G/4G/NB-IoT/5G).\n\
    As such, the IoT backend module component acts as an intermediary by translating\
    \ the information\nsent through these protocols to the interface made available\
    \ by the broker through NGSI-LD.\nThe second layer, Information Management, contains\
    \ software components in charge of data storage,\nprocessing, and distribution.\
    \ The distributed infrastructure is composed of servers in the cloud that\nwork\
    \ together to manage massive amounts of data and make them available to the upper\
    \ layer. The\nNGSI-LD interface is used to send data updates and receive notiﬁcations\
    \ about data changes. Figure 3\npresents an example of how the information provided\
    \ by an IoT gateway, which implements JSON\nover MQTT, is integrated into the\
    \ platform.\nFigure 3. Data model from Internet of Things (IoT) level to applications.\n\
    The element chosen was the device that analyses the water at the exit of the wastewater\
    \ treatment\nplant and determines the levels of turbidity and ph of the water.\
    \ Once the entity is created in the\nbroker using the NGSI-LD data model, consumers\
    \ can retrieve this information following two different\napproaches: query or\
    \ subscription.\nThe core of this platform is the NGSI-LD broker. It is an information\
    \ broker that exposes an\nHTTP REST API based on NGSI-LD for both registration\
    \ and consultation, as well as a subscription/\nnotiﬁcation approach. This is\
    \ the second point where interoperability is a signiﬁcant aspect. The use of\n\
    NGSI-LD provides various possible interactions with third-party platforms in both\
    \ directions. One\nof these solutions that has been integrated into the platform\
    \ through the development of a connector\nis MEGA [16]. The MEGA standard (ISO\
    \ 21622) provides guidelines for the implementation of a\nstandardized model applied\
    \ to irrigation that improves the speciﬁcation of irrigation schedules and\nthe\
    \ control of the system requirements. Within this management layer, the stored\
    \ information of each\nentity is overwritten, with only the current state being\
    \ kept; the information is stored in a nonrelational\ndatabase, MongoDB. This\
    \ database contains data referring to infrastructure and information ﬂow,\nas\
    \ well as information about users and organizations. All this information is modeled\
    \ using data\nmodels that allow for the uniﬁcation of data structures using standards\
    \ and also ensure the generality\nnecessary for the subsequent extensibility.\n\
    The last layer, Service, serves as an interface between users and the central\
    \ layer to offer different\nsolutions to the problems that are generated in an\
    \ agricultural operation, such as water management,\nirrigation planning, data\
    \ analytics, and monitoring of environmental parameters. The incorporation\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 1153\n9 of 20\nof other modules allows us to provide our solution\
    \ with more capabilities due to the possibility of\nintegrating new components\
    \ through connectors with NGSI-LD. The NGSI-LD interface is used to send\ndata\
    \ updates and receive notiﬁcations about data changes. A change in the conﬁguration\
    \ parameters\ntriggers control actions that are managed by subsystems at the user\
    \ level. As a result of the use of\nspeciﬁc connectors, the information is consulted\
    \ or notiﬁed to higher modules that are in charge of\npropagating it for other\
    \ interests, such as historical information, large-scale data management, or\n\
    integration with geographic information systems (GIS). For this purpose, a representational\
    \ state\ntransfer interface (REST) is used, which applies NGSI-LD for communication\
    \ between the ﬁnal\napplications and the analysis modules.\n3. Case Study in an\
    \ Irrigation Community\nThis section validates our data model and the architecture\
    \ of the platform. It was implemented in\nan irrigation community where different\
    \ systems, such as supervisory control and data acquisition\n(SCADA), GIS systems,\
    \ and sensors from different manufacturers, were integrated by the platform.\n\
    3.1. Scenario\nIrrigation communities are corporations attached to basin organizations,\
    \ which are responsible\nfor the management of the shared use of public common\
    \ water. To this end, they relied on automatons\nand speciﬁc irrigation systems\
    \ for years, which were tightly coupled, allowing for full interaction\nbetween\
    \ the devices and the software, but avoiding any other possibility of interacting\
    \ with third-party\ndevices and software applications.\nThe Miraﬂores irrigation\
    \ community is located in the municipality of Jumilla (Murcia) [30] in\nthe Segura\
    \ river basin and has almost 1000 community members. The area comprises about\
    \ 1330 ha\nof agricultural land, mostly devoted to woody crops and irrigated by\
    \ localized irrigation. The main\ncrops produced are fruit trees, especially pear,\
    \ peach, and apricot. The community uses surface water,\n3.8 hm3 annually, and\
    \ water from the Jumilla sewage plant, 1.5 hm3 annually. This treatment plant\n\
    delivers the reclaimed water at its exit, from where the community drives the\
    \ available ﬂows to six\ninterconnected regulation rafts, with a total capacity\
    \ of 1 hm3. The distribution network conducts\nwater from the rafts to the various\
    \ irrigated farms, equipped with automatic ﬂow control counters and\nsetpoints,\
    \ ensuring an average allocation of 4025 m3/ha/year/farm.\nOne of the main problems\
    \ to be solved is the integration of the different technological elements\n(SCADA,\
    \ drawing software, independent sensors, and third-party services) that provide\
    \ information\nto the community in a single control point. The data from SCADA\
    \ that are integrated into the platform\nare shown in Table 1. The results derived\
    \ from the water analysis conducted at least twice a month\nwere also integrated\
    \ into the platform.\nTable 1. Type of facilities from supervisory control and\
    \ data acquisition (SCADA) that are integrated\ninto the platform and the associated\

    \ Equipment and Implementation\nFigure 4 shows the general scheme that was followed\
    \ to address the deployment of the platform.\nThe ﬁrst step was to channel water\
    \ from the headwater reservoir, with its corresponding water analyses,\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 1153\n10 of 20\nto the agricultural plots. The plot is one of the\
    \ key elements of the system. All the devices needed for\nits deﬁnition are integrated\
    \ using dataloggers and IoT connectors. Through this process, SCADA data\nand\
    \ the sensors that interact with the plot (soil moisture sensors, agricultural\
    \ weather station, and\nhydrants) are integrated into the systems. The information\
    \ is transferred to the data model for later\nvisualization (using mobile or web\
    \ applications) and analysis by the users of the irrigation community.\nFigure\
    \ 4. Layout of the case study.\nThe deployment involved the installation of controllers\
    \ for monitoring, and remote control in\noutdoor environments were provided by\
    \ Odin Solutions [31]. The cost of implementing the platform\nwas reduced due\
    \ to the open source feature of the platform. This feature decreased the budget\
    \ needed\nfor dataloggers managing different devices or sensors in the platform.\
    \ In this instance, the cost of\nthe chosen datalogger, IPex12, has an average\
    \ price of around 600 euros (including conﬁguration\nand installation) and varies\
    \ according to the number of sensors integrated into the system. The main\ncharacteristics\
    \ of IPex12 are: 32-bit CPU and 4 MB of memory expandable with microSD, Ethernet,\n\
    USB, CAN, 3xRS232, 1xRS485, and 12 I/O ports, which can be conﬁgured by software\
    \ as digital or\nanalogue input/outputs. It supports Third-generation Networks\
    \ (3G), IPv6 over Low power Wireless\nPersonal Area Networks (6LowPAN), Sigfox,\
    \ Narrow Band IoT (NB IoT), and LoRA. Each IPex12\nis able to manage eight additional\
    \ slaves I/O boards using CAN. The controllers are conﬁgured\neffortlessly through\
    \ their web server, which permits us to conﬁgure tasks independently from the\n\
    MQTT commands received from the cloud computing layer. IPex12 is specially designed\
    \ for outdoor\nsettings such as the agricultural scenarios, since it is provided\
    \ with water- and dust-proof enclosure.\nIt is provided with a battery and a solar\
    \ panel.\nThe dataloggers have the ability to monitor sensor readings of soil\
    \ conductivity, soil moisture,\nsoil temperature, water meter readings, and meteorological\
    \ parameters, among others, and to operate\nthe solenoid valves to control the\
    \ irrigation system.\nThe cloud server is a PowerEdge R7515 Server, with an AMD\
    \ EPYC 7402 2.80 GHz, 32 GB of\nRAM, and two solid state drives (SSD) of 480 GB\
    \ each. It also runs the Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Server and\nLibVirt/KVM. A single virtual\
    \ machine was used here for the global broker, data saving, big data\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 1153\n11 of 20\nprocesses, and to host management with web services.\
    \ The virtual machine uses 28 GB of memory and\n400 GB of hard disk capacity.\
    \ A good performance is possible at the moment, but given the ﬂexibility\nof our\
    \ architecture, more resources could be added by modifying or moving virtual images.\n\
    Once the different modules that form the platform were conﬁgured, the entities\
    \ were deﬁned\nin the broker so that their subscriptions could be made later.\
    \ The broker manages subscriptions\nto the creation or changes of entities. All\
    \ these changes are stored in MongoDB, a nonrelational\nJSON-LD object-based database,\
    \ to provide fast and ﬂexible access to information. The speed of\nprocessing\
    \ is fundamental because, otherwise, a bottleneck is created that would slow down\
    \ the rest of\nthe implementations.\nTo improve the data of the irrigation plots,\
    \ the data model proposed in Section 2.1 was used\naccording to the needs proposed\
    \ by the users of the irrigation community. A model instantiation was\nconstructed\
    \ through NGSI-LD of an apricot tree plot where a soil moisture sensor was installed.\
    \ The\nsoil moisture sensor is listed in Listing 1 and the crop is deﬁned in Listing\
    \ 2.\nListing 1. Next generation service interfaces with linked data (NGSI-LD)\

    \ 2020, 20, 1153\n14 of 20\n4.1. Information Broker Evaluation\nThe main element\
    \ of the platform is a NGSI-LD broker, which is responsible for storing all the\n\
    information as well as processing the different queries, answers, subscriptions,\
    \ and the management\nof the information providers. For this reason, an analysis\
    \ was performed by selecting the following\nmetrics: CPU usage, memory consumed,\
    \ and response times, according to the operations performed.\nFirstly, different\
    \ execution tests were conducted to check the platform ability to perform the\n\
    changes without losing the quality of service. The tests were performed with the\
    \ same type of requests,\nchecking their response time in terms of both CPU and\
    \ RAM. All tests were based on a one-minute\nexecution varying the number of simultaneous\
    \ communications or connections with which it was\nperformed. Figure 5 shows the\
    \ results of the tests of the behavior of the processor and the memory.\n(a) CPU\
    \ usage\n(b) RAM usage\nFigure 5. Evaluation of platform scalability.\nFigure\
    \ 5a shows that the CPU requirements increased by around 20% in the ﬁrst intervals\
    \ (2, 4,\nand 8 threads). From this moment on and up to 1024 threads, the CPU\
    \ remained stable with average\nvalues close to 90%. Figure 5b shows that the\
    \ behavior in the use of the RAM remains practically stable\nfrom the beginning\
    \ to the end without altering the consumed resources. The increase in the use\
    \ of the\nRAM during the tests performed varied between 5% and 9%, values that\
    \ are considered optimal.\nThe behaviour of the platform was evaluated based on\
    \ the information distribution characteristic\nthat the broker had acquired. To\
    \ this end, the response time obtained after performing various\noperations on\
    \ the different broker operating modes is analyzed; Table 2 shows the most signiﬁcant\n\
    values obtained in the tests. The graphs shown in Figure 6 show the times for\
    \ the different modes:\nentity management, subscription management, and context\
    \ provider control.\n•\nThe publication/subscription model enables the reduction\
    \ of the number of queries because it is\nnot necessary to make periodic queries\
    \ to receive updates to the data stored on the platform. The\ncreation time is\
    \ longer since it has to be adjusted to the proposed data model;\n•\nThe management\
    \ of external context suppliers is a process that speeds up access to the information,\n\
    making the process more transparent for the ﬁnal client. The broker’s mission\
    \ is to act as a proxy\nbetween the client and the context provider. For this\
    \ reason, search and consultation times are\nshorter compared with the rest of\
    \ the operations.\nSensors 2020, 20, 1153\n15 of 20\n(a) Entities\n(b) Subscriptions\n\

    This section provides an evaluation of the response times of the platform based\
    \ on the three layers\nthat form its architecture. Figure 7 shows the times obtained\
    \ for the system after the execution of\n100 requests. Figure 7a shows the notiﬁcation\
    \ times at its two levels: at MQTT level (MQTT broker\nnotiﬁes the IoT Agent)\
    \ and at NGSI-LD broker level. The times of the Information Management Layer are\n\
    longer, with an average of 21.69 s, since all the semantic enrichment provided\
    \ by the use of the data\nmodel is performed in the database (MongoDB). However,\
    \ in exchange for this increase in time, it is\npossible to have all the relevant\
    \ information of the irrigation community homogenized and integrated\ninto a single\
    \ point. Figure 7b shows the system’s capabilities in terms of performance management.\n\
    The graph shows that if the device is connected, the response time is less than\
    \ if it is not; the average\nresponse time of 31.18 ms is considered low.\nSensors\

    \ Use of the Platform at the Agricultural Level\nData interoperability is of critical\
    \ importance. Here, the proposed solution (data model and\nplatform) provides\
    \ the necessary data translation mechanisms by combining the use of a data model\n\
    together with standardized solutions, such as those provided through NGSI-LD.\
    \ This proposal enables\nthe integration of multiple systems/devices or data sources,\
    \ resulting in an open and interoperable data\nintegration model according to\
    \ the changing requirements of farms. The use of data models contributes\nto obtaining\
    \ performance indicators, decision making, and sharing data with different farms.\n\
    Figure 8 shows the evolution of irrigation before the platform was installed.\
    \ The analysis of\nthe data revealed the irregularity of the irrigation system.\
    \ To have a continuous and homogeneous\nirrigation system, we deemed it necessary\
    \ to deﬁne irrigation thresholds provided by the agricultural\ntechnicians. As\
    \ the ﬁeld capacity and the wilt point determine the maximum and minimum limits\
    \ of the\nsoil humidity that can be used by the crops, we concluded that the amount\
    \ of water between these\ntwo values is the functional water or humidity available\
    \ to the plant. Once the community technicians\ndeﬁned the limits for the crops,\
    \ tests were conducted on an apricot tree plot to evaluate the irrigation\nefﬁciency:\
    \ the ﬁrst as soon as the platform was deployed (between March and April), and\
    \ another after\nimproving the irrigation programming based on the results of\
    \ the ﬁrst test (between June and July).\nFigure 8. Evolution of the humidity\
    \ of an apricot crop based on set water levels.\nOnce the ﬁrst test was analyzed,\
    \ Figure 8, we found that during irrigation, two critical zones\nwere generated,\
    \ A and B, with extreme peaks that were outside the recommended limits, indicating\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 1153\n17 of 20\nthat water use was not efﬁcient, thus a scarce\
    \ resource was being wasted. Zone A indicates that root\nasphyxiation was produced\
    \ (a limitation of the capacity of the plants to breathe through the roots)\n\
    in the crop by excess water; Zone B indicates that the plant does not have ability\
    \ to supply itself\nwith water, consequently reducing the quality of the production\
    \ of the crop. Once the maximum and\nminimum thresholds are set, rules can be\
    \ deﬁned for efﬁcient irrigation. When the thresholds are\nexceeded or not reached,\
    \ the platform generates notiﬁcations to users through the mobile application.\n\
    These rules can also be associated with the activation of digital inputs for the\
    \ start-up of any device\nthat improves irrigation efﬁciency.\nAs a result of\
    \ the use of the platform and the analysis of the data obtained, and with the\
    \ help of\nan agricultural technician, the relevant irrigation limits are established\
    \ or adjusted. In addition, other\nuseful parameters can be established, such\
    \ as the root network, the type of soil, or the disposition of\nthe probes. Once\
    \ the irrigation programming was changed, Figure 9 shows that the irrigation was\n\
    efﬁciently applied. The water contributions and vertical column are in line with\
    \ the humidity curves,\nshowing stable and uniform sharing. By controlling the\
    \ hydrants and applying ﬁlters based on the\nlimits set, irrigation was controlled\
    \ to maintain the humidity within the desired parameters, or to\ninform of possible\
    \ alerts to activate programmed irrigation to avoid a reduction in production.\n\
    Figure 9.\nEvolution of efﬁcient irrigation, comparing soil moisture and water\
    \ contribution by\nthe hydrant.\nThe versatility of the platform is stressed by\
    \ the ability to export selected data for further\nprocessing or study, as shown\
    \ in Figures 8 and 9 using the export to CSV option.\n5. Conclusions\nThis work\
    \ demonstrated the importance of interoperability in the ﬁeld of agriculture,\
    \ water\nmanagement, and irrigation systems. Herein, an interoperable and open\
    \ platform is presented which\nis capable of integrating heterogeneous data sources\
    \ at the IoT level to aid and improve the decision\nmaking in a community of irrigators.\
    \ The platform enables the integration of controllers and sensors\nfrom different\
    \ manufacturers, and thus represents a unique access point for all this information.\n\
    As such, improving the techniques used in the agricultural sector is possible,\
    \ thereby sustainably\nobtaining higher economic, environmental, and social yields.\
    \ As a result of its interoperable nature,\nthe platform can be combined with\
    \ other systems to expand its range of services. The interoperability\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 1153\n18 of 20\naspect was tested in a real-world context where successful\
    \ integration with other systems already\ndeployed in the facilities of the irrigation\
    \ community was possible thanks to this characteristic. The\nplatform integrates\
    \ different protocols at the IoT level, such as MQTT, CoAP, LoRa, SigFox, and\
    \ HTTP.\nThey transport the information following different data formats. Nevertheless,\
    \ a set of them promote\ninteroperability, such as Lightweight Machine to Machine\
    \ (LWM2M), JSON, and UltraLight. These\nrepresentation formats were adopted by\
    \ the presented platform as to facilitate its integration into IoT\ndevices, making\
    \ use of this technology. The agents of the IoT backend of our platform perform\
    \ the\nadaptation of this information to the NGSI-LD interface and data model.\
    \ After analyzing the obtained\nresults in the community of irrigators, the following\
    \ conclusions were obtained:\n1.\nA homogeneous data model was proposed that meets\
    \ the speciﬁc needs of agriculture, such\nas efﬁcient water management. This model\
    \ was validated on the platform using an NGSI-LD\nbroker. The application of this\
    \ model in an irrigation community provides its managers with the\ncapacity to\
    \ manage the agronomic information and its relationship with the devices that\
    \ provide\ninformation to improve irrigation water;\n2.\nThe platform was validated\
    \ using metrics to check its behavior. Firstly, the scalability of the main\n\
    component, the NGSI-LD broker, was analyzed based on the average use of the CPU\
    \ (83.21%) and\nmemory (56.39%). At the latency level, measures were recorded\
    \ on the most relevant operations\nof the broker, highlighting among them the\
    \ average time, 510.28 ms, of the creation of a context\nprovider. The platform\
    \ was validated as a whole, showing the time delay from the moment the\ndevice\
    \ receives the information and when it is received by the platform (2.97 s); and\
    \ from the\nmoment the action is performed (31.17 ms);\n3.\nAt the user level,\
    \ the platform was validated in several apricot tree plots, improving the\nmanagement\
    \ of the water used. This improvement was achieved because of the deﬁnition\n\
    of optimal irrigation thresholds for each crop and by generating ﬁlter notiﬁcations\
    \ that, under\ncertain conditions, allow the hydrants to be adjusted, thus enabling\
    \ efﬁcient water use.\nIn the future, the speed of computing and latency should\
    \ be compared by replicating the platform\nin edge computing with current cloud\
    \ computing to detect which one provides better performance and\nresponse times.\
    \ One of these involves the processing of satellite images. At the plot level,\
    \ this feature\nwill monitor the main characteristics of the crop with applications\
    \ based on remote sensors. This new\nattribute will focus on the diagnosis, management,\
    \ and control of irrigation. Currently, this feature\nuses images of the Sentinel\
    \ 2 satellite, which is more focused on agricultural issues, but soon the PAZ\n\
    satellite (the ﬁrst Spanish radar earth observation satellite, which is included\
    \ within the National Earth\nObservation Programme) will be used. Another future\
    \ line of research is the development of a data\nanalysis module that will allow\
    \ us to cross check and analyze the history of the data acquired. This\nwill generate\
    \ better results in agricultural management, increase productivity, and reduce\
    \ expenses,\nsuch as by reducing the consumption of water, nutrients, and phytosanitary\
    \ products.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualisation, J.A.L.-M., J.A.M. and A.F.S.;\

    is possible through Internet-based technologies. Their application allows for
    the exploitation of information and the development of isolated applications,
    which, although powerful, create challenges for obtaining scalable predictions
    throughout the useful life of farms.

    water use efficiency. The key objective of the analysis is to provide a foundation
    for designing, implementing, and evaluating automated irrigation systems using
    data science and other key agricultural technologies.

    content Abstract The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-based climate variability
    can have a significant impact on crop production due to its effect on yield variation
    on space and time. The main objective of this study was to determine the impact
    of ENSO-based climate variability on water use efficiency (WUE) of rainfed cotton
    (Gossypium hirsutum L.) grown in the southeastern USA. Specific objectives were
    to determine the spatial and temporal variability of WUE of rainfed cotton as
    related to ENSO phases. The CSM-CROPGRO-Cotton model, previously calibrated and
    evaluated with observed data, was used to simulate seed yield and evapotranspiration
    of rainfed cotton for selected counties in Alabama, Florida, and Georgia for the
    period from 1950 to 2006. For each location, model simulations from nine planting
    dates were categorized into the ENSO phases using the Japan Meteorological Agency
    (JMA) index. Then, simulation outputs were used to calculate WUE as the ratio
    of cotton seed yield to crop evapotranspiration. For each location and planting
    date, normal values for WUE were obtained and deviations from normal for each
    ENSO phase were determined. Exploratory and nonparametric analyses were used to
    analyze the results. Our results suggest that WUE of rainfed cotton is differentially
    affected by ENSO. During El Niño years WUE deviations from normal tended to be
    negative for early planting dates but positive and larger for late planting dates,
    no tendency was found for the entire planting window during Neutral years. During
    La Niña years WUE deviations from normal tend to be positive and larger for early
    to mid planting dates, becoming smaller and negative for late planting dates.
    The stronger spatial dependence of WUE during La Niña years than during El Niño
    and Neutral years may imply that more attention should be given to planning strategies
    during La Niña years if we were to plan rainfed cotton in the region. Our results
    suggest that management practices of rainfed cotton tailored to ENSO-based climate
    variability are promising as a strategy for reducing the vulnerability of the
    crop to climate variability in the southeastern USA. Previous article in issue

    Cotton is economically one of the most important crops in the southeastern USA.
    During the last nine years, Alabama, Florida and Georgia contribution to total
    cotton production in the USA has been as low as 12% during the 2004 and 2007 growing
    seasons and as high as 18% during the 2008 growing season (www.nass.usda.gov),
    evidencing that cotton yield varies considerably over time and space in the region.
    Among other factors, the climate variability is an important factor that impacts
    yield of agronomic crops (Hansen et al., 1998, Legler et al., 1999, Alexandrov
    and Hoogenboom, 2001, Basso et al., 2007), the total water demand of crops (Meza,
    2005), water used for supplemental irrigation (Richards et al., 2008), and water
    use efficiency (WUE) (Mo et al., 2005, Chen et al., 2010). The El Niño Southern
    Oscillation (ENSO), which refers to the changes in observed sea surface temperature
    (SST) in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific Ocean, has important consequences for
    weather worldwide as well as significant impact on yield of crops, such as cotton
    in the southeastern USA (Legler et al., 1999). Management practices tailored to
    mitigate the potential negative impact of ENSO on crop yield could help growers
    make better management decisions. The risk to exposures could be reduced and the
    vulnerability to variation in water availability could be decreased with a potential
    increase on total yield. For instance, a study conducted by Mavromatis et al.
    (2002) showed that peanut management practices tailored to ENSO phases could result
    in a higher yield and reduction in the potential environmental impact of nitrogen
    leaching. Other examples from field experiment studies from the southeastern USA
    (Nuti et al., 2006) and other regions of the world (Killi and Bolek, 2006) showed
    that an adjustment of the planting date according to environmental conditions,
    mainly air temperature, could be a useful instrument to improve cotton growth
    and development and ultimately yield. It has been well documented that drought
    events in the southeastern USA are related to ENSO phases (Mo and Schemm, 2008).
    However, there is a lack of information on how ENSO phases impacts WUE of crops,
    specifically cotton. Recent droughts in the southeastern USA have resulted in
    a severe yield reduction of cotton and other crops (www.nass.usda.gov), emphasizing
    the need for climate variability studies that could provide sound information
    for crops management within the agricultural sector. Efficient water use is particularly
    important in cotton since it has a significantly higher need for water per unit
    seed yield than other major field crops such as rice, wheat and maize (Zwart and
    Bastiaanssen, 2004). Consequently, a better understanding of the effects of ENSO
    on water use efficiency (WUE) of rainfed cotton production in the southeastern
    USA would be of high interest in the context of sustainable management practices.
    While historical cotton yield can be obtained relatively easy, but limited to
    certain locations, information on cotton water use is not available and can only
    be estimated using historical weather data and empirical approaches. The lack
    of the simultaneous availability of historical cotton yield and water use data
    limits their use for studies relating to climate variability, such as ENSO, and
    WUE. Moreover, erratic rainfall, which varies in both frequency and amount during
    the growing season, limits the reliability of field experiments that assess irrigation
    management strategies (Baumhardt et al., 2009) and WUE studies. However, yield
    and water use of crops as a function of crop management and environmental factors,
    e.g. weather and soil, can be simulated with different crop simulation models
    (Hunt and Boote, 1998, Hoogenboom, 2000). If appropriate inputs are used, crop
    models can be helpful tools to identify causes of spatial and temporal variability
    of yield (Batchelor et al., 2002) and water use (Guerra et al., 2007). Although
    crop models face spatial limitations for regional use due to their point-based
    nature (Batchelor et al., 2002), geostatistics have been used as a complement
    to crop model applications, aggregating their outputs at the field or regional
    level. Geostatistic was initially used by geologists (Matheron, 1963, Trangmar
    et al., 1985) but is now applied in various agriculture and environmental science-related
    fields, such as hydrosciences (Delhomme, 1978), soil science (Trangmar et al.,
    1985), evapotranspiration (Cuenca and Amegee, 1987), crop irrigation water requirements
    (Sousa and Pereira, 1999), crops water use (Boken et al., 2004), and climatology
    (Carrera-Hernández and Gaskin, 2008). For instance, Lobell and Ortiz-Monasterio
    (2006) used simulated data to study the causes of spatial distribution of irrigated
    wheat yield in Mexico. Guerra et al. (2007) used the CSM-CROPGRO-Cotton model
    and geostatistical techniques to estimate the spatial distribution of simulated
    monthly irrigation water use of cotton in southwest Georgia, USA. Thus, the CSM-CROPGRO-Cotton
    model could also be used as a tool to determine the impact of planting date on
    yield and WUE of rainfed cotton as related to ENSO phases in the southeastern
    USA. Studies of the spatial variability of crops WUE is scarce. Recently, Mo et
    al. (2005) conducted a comprehensive study on the spatial variability of yield,
    water use, and WUE of winter wheat and maize in the North China Plain using a
    crop growth model and remotely sensed data. Their results showed that the spatial
    patterns of simulated yield and WUE for winter wheat and maize were strongly influenced
    by irrigated/rainfed conditions and concluded that yield can be significantly
    improved by maximizing a crop''s regional WUE. The main objective of this study
    was to determine the impact of ENSO-based climate variability on water use efficiency
    (WUE) of rainfed cotton grown in the southeastern USA. Specific objectives were
    to determine the spatial and temporal variability of WUE of rainfed cotton as
    related to ENSO phases. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. The cotton model The Cropping
    System Model (CSM)-CROPGRO-Cotton model (Messina et al., 2004) is part of the
    CSM-CROPGRO family of models of the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology
    Transfer (DSSAT) (Jones et al., 2003, Hoogenboom et al., 2004). The DSSAT is a
    collection of independent programs that operate together; crop simulation models
    are its core. Databases describe weather, soil, experiment conditions and measurements,
    and genotypic information for applying the models to different situations (Jones
    et al., 2003). The cotton model has been used for global sensitivity analysis
    of its parameters (Pathak et al., 2007), irrigation scheduling (Suleiman et al.,
    2007), assessment of generated solar radiation for simulation applications (Garcia
    y Garcia et al., 2008), and agroforestry studies (Zamora et al., 2008). 2.2. Cotton
    model evaluation The CSM-CROPGRO-Cotton model was evaluated for conditions in
    Alabama and Georgia, USA. Observed data for the variety DP 555 BG/RR from 2002
    to 2007 obtained from variety trials conducted in Limestone, Alabama (Jensen,
    2003, Jensen, 2004, Weiss, 2005, Guthrie, 2006, Guthrie, 2007, Guthrie, 2008)
    and for Plains and Tifton in Georgia (http://www.swvt.uga.edu/), were used. Daily
    maximum and minimum air temperature and precipitation for each location were obtained
    from the National Weather Service Cooperative Observer Program (COOP) network
    as compiled by the Center for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies (COAPS), through
    the Southeast Climate Consortium (www.SEClimate.org). Daily solar radiation was
    generated from the observed daily air temperatures and rainfall using the Weather
    Generator for Solar Radiation (WGENR) (Hodges et al., 1985), as modified by Garcia
    y Garcia and Hoogenboom (2005). The soil profile information for each location
    was obtained from the soil characterization database of the USDA-Natural Resources
    Conservation Service (USDA-NRCS, 2010). Data from both rainfed and irrigated conditions
    were used for model evaluation. For the latter conditions, we assumed an irrigation
    threshold of 60% of the available water content and an irrigation management depth
    of 50 cm. Other crop management practices, such as planting date and N-fertilizer
    application, were set according to normal practices recommended for Alabama and
    Georgia (Culpepper et al., 2009). 2.3. Cotton model application Yield and evapotranspiration
    of rainfed cotton were simulated for conditions in 49 counties in the southeastern
    USA, including 13 counties in Alabama, 9 counties in Florida, and 27 counties
    in Georgia, covering the cotton growing region within the tree states (Fig. 1).
    For each location, simulations were obtained for a period of 57 years, from 1950
    to 2006. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Cotton producing counties
    in Alabama, Florida, and Georgia that were used in this study. The daily weather
    data and three dominant soil profile data for the simulations were obtained from
    the same sources that were used for the model evaluation, i.e., the National Weather
    Service Cooperative Observer Program (COOP) and the soil characterization database
    of the Natural Resources Conservation Service (USDA-NRCS, 2010), respectively.
    The extent of the three soil profiles, expressed as average percentage (±standard
    deviation), was 20.3 (±11.4), 37.7 (±10.6), and 36.5 (±11.6) for counties in Alabama,
    Florida, and Georgia, respectively with an overall available soil–water of 93
    mm (±42) in the top 100 cm depth (USDA-NRCS, 2010). To cover the planting dates
    window in the three states, cotton was planted weekly for a total of nine planting
    dates, including April 9, 16, 23, May 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and June 5. The variety
    DP 555 BG/RR, widely grown in the southeastern USA (Collins, 2010), was used.
    Management practices, including plant population and N-fertilizer application,
    were set similarly to the procedure mentioned for the model evaluation. For each
    combination of location and planting dates the WUE (kg m−3) was calculated as
    the ratio of the yield (kg ha−1) to total crop evapotranspiration (mm) (Sinclair
    et al., 1984, Howell, 2001). The average WUE for the 30-year period from 1971
    to 2000 was then calculated to represent its normal value. For each location,
    the 57-year period was categorized into the three different ENSO phases, resulting
    in 13, 30, and 14 years El Niño, Neutral, and La Niña, respectively. For all 49
    locations and for each planting date, 637, 1470, and 686 years of El Niño, Neutral,
    and La Niña, respectively, were analyzed. The index from the Japan Meteorological
    Agency (JMA) (www.coaps.fsu.edu/jma.shtml), which corresponds to a 5-month running
    mean of spatially averaged sea surface temperature anomalies over the tropical
    Pacific for the region 4°S–4°N, 150°W–90°W, was used to categorize the ENSO years.
    Subsequently, within ENSO phase and for each planting date, deviations in WUE
    from normal (1971–2000) were respectively obtained. 2.4. Statistical analyses
    To assess the accuracy of the model, summary statistics and the Willmott index
    of agreement (Willmott, 1982) (d value) were obtained between observed and simulated
    data. The Willmott''s d value is an indicator of model performance; values closer
    to 1 indicate better prediction, while d values of zero indicates no predictability.
    The cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of WUE of cotton at different planting
    dates during the different ENSO phases were analyzed with the Kolmogorov–Smirnov
    (K–S) two-sample, two-side test using the NPAR1WAY procedure of SAS (SAS Institute
    Inc., 2006). The K–S test detects the largest difference that might exist between
    two distribution functions based on a statistic, called the D statistic. The smaller
    the calculated D statistic, the smaller the differences between the distributions
    at a given probability level (P-value). The null hypothesis for this test is that
    data set 1 and data set 2 have the same continuous distribution; the alternative
    hypothesis is that they have different continuous distributions. The characterization
    of the spatial variability of WUE of cotton as related to ENSO phases is a fundamental
    step towards the determination of spatial dependence and spatial patterns. To
    quantify the spatial structure of WUE of cotton, isotropic variogram models (Delhomme,
    1978) were fitted to data from each planting date within ENSO phase using the
    software GS+ v9.0 (Gamma Design Software, LLC – St. Plainwell, MI). The selection
    of best variogram was based on the coefficient of determination (r2) and the reduced
    sum of squares (RSS), which indicates the accuracy of the fitted models. The parameters
    of the model, i.e. nugget (C0), which represents the unexplained or random variance,
    range or spatial dependence, and sill (C0 + C) or total variance, were obtained.
    We used the ratio of the nugget to sill as an indicator of the degree of randomness
    of the spatial variability of the data. The approach, originally used by Cambardella
    et al. (1994) to define distinct classes of spatial dependence for soil variables,
    consists of grouping the ratio in three categories: ratio ≤ 0.25 as strongly spatially
    dependent, 0.25 < ratio ≥ 0.75 as moderate spatial dependence, and ratio > 0.75
    as weak spatial dependence. The ratio approach has also been used by Ping et al.
    (2004) to study the spatial dependence of center pivot irrigated cotton yield
    for conditions in Texas. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Model evaluation Simulated
    (observed) seed yield was as low as 1159 kg ha−1 (1226 kg ha−1) for rainfed conditions
    and as high as 3868 kg ha−1 (4319 kg ha−1) for irrigated conditions. The overall
    average simulated (observed) seed yield, was 2916 kg ha−1 (2971 kg ha−1) (Table
    1). The index of agreement (d) and the Pearson''s coefficient of correlation showed
    that the CSM-CROPGRO-Cotton model simulated seed yield of rainfed cotton in agreement
    with the observed data (Fig. 2). Table 1. Summary statistics for observed and

    of ENSO-based WUE of rainfed cotton ENSO-based WUE deviations from normal showed
    different tendencies within the growing season. However, during El Niño and Neutral
    years, the extent of the WUE from normal was similar across all planting dates.
    During El Niño years, WUE deviation from normal tended to be slightly negative
    for early planting dates and slightly positive for late planting dates with variations
    ranging from −0.035 to 0.023 kg m−3 for April 9 planting date to −0.025 to 0.037
    kg m−3 for June 5 planting date. During Neutral years, WUE deviations from normal
    practically did not show differences within the growing season; the small variations
    ranged from −0.018 to 0.024 kg m−3 across all planting dates. During La Niña years,
    however, WUE deviations from normal tended to decrease from early to late planting
    dates, with deviations ranging from −0.020 to 0.070 kg m−3 for the April 9 planting
    date to −0.050 to 0.017 kg m−3 for the June 5 planting date (Fig. 3). Download

    line within the box marks the median, the whiskers above and below the box indicate
    the 90th and 10th percentiles, and the dots indicate the outliers. Our results
    showed that planting date has a major effect on WUE of cotton during La Niña year
    as compared to El Niño and Neutral years. In fact, variations on WUE deviations
    from normal followed the tendency of Neutral < El Niño < La Niña. In other words,
    cotton producers should expect yields closer to normal during Neutral and El Niño
    years than during La Niña years. Planting rainfed cotton from April 9 to May 8
    during La Niña years, however, seems favorable for producers since most of the
    WUE deviations from normal tend to be positive (Fig. 3). These results demonstrate
    that ENSO-based climate variability could be of interest for crop management recommendations.
    For the same region, Hansen et al. (1998) reported an overall significant impact
    of ENSO phases on the final acreage of harvested cotton. 3.3. Effect of ENSO phases
    on WUE of rainfed cotton The analysis of the CDFs of WUE showed significant differences
    (P < 0.05) on WUE between ENSO phases throughout the planting window, with remarkable
    differences between planting dates for El Niño and La Niña years and for La Niña
    and Neutral years (Table 2). For El Niño and La Niña years, WUE of rainfed cotton
    was significantly different (P < 0.05) for early and late planting dates but no
    differences were found for planting dates from May 8 to May 22. For El Niño and
    Neutral years, significant differences on WUE of cotton were observed for planting
    date on April 9 and for mid to late planting dates in May; during most of the
    planting dates window, WUE of rainfed cotton during El Niño and Neutral years
    was not significantly different. Conversely, during most of the planting window
    WUE of rainfed cotton during La Niña and Neutral years was significantly different
    (Table 2). These results demonstrate that ENSO-based climate variability significantly
    affects the WUE of rainfed cotton. From a practical point of view, major attention
    should be given to La Niña years since La Niña-based WUE varies significantly
    in more than 62% and 90% of the cases when compared to El Niño and Neutral years,
    respectively. No specific studies on the impact of ENSO-based climate variability
    on WUE of cotton were found. However, for crops other than cotton, a recent study
    conducted for conditions in the North China Plain (Chen et al., 2010) for winter
    wheat and summer maize using the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator, APSIM
    (Keating et al., 2003), concluded that water productivity and field water balance
    are strongly influenced by climate variability. Table 2. Comparison of cumulative

    During La Niña years, significant differences (P < 0.05) on WUE were found between
    early to mid planting dates and late planting dates. Meanwhile, no differences
    on WUE during El Niño and Neutral years were found during the whole planting window
    (Table 3). In other words, if ENSO forecast is for a La Niña event, producer may
    consider a careful analysis of their planting window since they could expect above
    normal WUE as planting is delayed. On the other hand, if ENSO forecast is to be
    an El Niño event or Neutral year, the planting date should be based on strategies
    other than ENSO-based climate variability, such as reducing the risk of pest and
    diseases. Table 3. Comparison of cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) for

    cotton yield response to different planting dates in the region, reported as high
    yields for early planting dates and low yield for late planting dates (Culpepper
    et al., 2009). During El Niño years, the period from October to April tends to
    be cool and wet while during La Niña years summers tend to be slightly wetter
    than normal (Hansen et al., 1998, Mo and Schemm, 2008); that is, a wetter summer
    may recharge the soil profile with sufficient water to avoid stress during key
    stages of cotton plant growth, particularly in areas with frequent drought, to
    ensure yield production. This might explain why WUE for rainfed cotton tended
    to be higher during La Niña than during El Niño and Neutral years. 3.5. Spatial
    variability of ENSO-based WUE of rainfed cotton For El Niño and Neutral years,
    a spherical model was fitted to WUE data while during La Niña years, a Gaussian
    model was fitted to WUE data. Ping et al. (2004), studying the spatial dependence
    of center-pivot irrigated cotton yield conditions in Texas, fitted a Gaussian
    model to experimental variograms. Our variogram models were satisfactorily fitted
    to WUE, observing a lower reduced sum of squares (RSS) and a higher coefficient
    of determination (r2) for La Niña and Neutral years than during El Niño years.
    For all planting dates, the average spatial dependence for WUE was 223 km for
    El Niño and 228 km for Neutral and La Niña years (Table 4). Based on the nugget
    to sill ratio (Cambardella et al., 1994), the WUE of rainfed cotton for all three
    ENSO phases was found to be strongly (ratio ≤ 25) and moderately (0.25 < ratio
    ≥ 0.75) spatially dependent. In other words, at certain distance WUE of rainfed
    cotton seems to be similar between locations within an ENSO phase. Table 4. Average
    model parameters from nine planting dates fitted to variograms for WUE of rainfed
    cotton as a function of ENSO phase. ENSO phase Model Nugget Sill Range r2 RSS

    Nugget and Sill: (kg m−3)2; range: km; r2: coefficient of determination; RSS:
    reduced sums of squares; and values in brackets correspond to SE of the average
    from nine planting dates. It is well known that WUE of crops varies as a function
    of several factors, including water management, plant type, and environmental
    conditions (climate and soil texture) (Katerji and Mastrorilli, 2009). In this
    study, management practices and plant type were set constant over the area and
    period of interest; environmental conditions, specifically climate and soil data,
    did vary. Since our study included a variety of soils, we could speculate that
    the water holding capacity of the soil played an important role determining the
    spatial variability of WUE. However, the inherent spatial variability of soil
    characteristics, e.g. water holding capacity, can be due to the influence of several
    factors, such as soil properties and topography (Western and Blöschl, 1999), limiting
    the identification of possible spatial relations with WUE. Thus, other than ENSO
    phases, no other specific cause of the spatial dependence of WUE was identified.
    The WUE of rainfed cotton showed different scales of spatial dependence between
    ENSO phases, suggesting a stronger spatial dependence of WUE during La Niña years
    than during El Niño and Neutral years. During El Niño and Neutral years, the spatial
    dependence of WUE was moderate for all nine planting dates with a tendency to
    a stronger dependence from early to late planting dates. During La Niña years,
    we found an increasingly strong spatial dependence of WUE from early and late
    planting dates towards mid planting dates, with its highest dependence for the
    May 1 and May 8 planting dates (Fig. 4). These findings suggest that larger homogeneous
    areas of WUE of rainfed cotton during La Niña than during El Niño and Neutral
    years could be expected. Those homogeneous areas may allow, for example, better
    interpolations and inferences between locations. Some studies have also found
    spatial dependence of cotton yield to environmental conditions. Recently, a study
    conducted by Ping et al. (2004) for conditions in New Deal, TX for center-pivot
    irrigated cotton, found a significant spatial dependence of cotton lint yield
    during drier years. Although for crops other than cotton, a study conducted by
    Mo et al. (2005) for conditions in the North China Plain using crop growth models
    and remotely sensed data, found a strong spatial dependence for WUE of wheat and
    a strong spatial variability for WUE of maize. Download : Download full-size image

    of rainfed cotton. 4. Conclusions The results from this study suggest that water
    use efficiency of rainfed cotton is differentially affected by the El Niño Southern
    Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. While during El Niño years WUE deviations from
    normal tended to be negative for early planting dates but positive and larger
    for late planting dates, no tendency was found for the entire planting window
    studied during Neutral years. On the other hand, it was found that during La Niña
    years WUE deviations from normal tend to be positive and larger for early to mid
    planting dates becoming smaller and negative for late planting dates. The strong
    spatial dependence of WUE during La Niña years than during El Niño and Neutral
    years may imply stronger effects of the former on cotton production in the region.
    As a practical consequence, more attention should be given to planning strategies
    during La Niña years for planting rainfed cotton in the southeastern USA. Our
    results suggest that management practices for rainfed cotton tailored to ENSO-based
    climate variability could be used as strategy for reducing the vulnerability of
    the crop to climate variability in the southeastern USA. Acknowledgements This

    to be central in the spatial variability of hydrologic parameters, yields, and
    water use in the Lower Mississippi River basin and Southeast (Grant et al., 2017;
    Haghverdi et al., 2019; Sadler et al., 2000; Zipper et al., 2016). The inherent
    spatial variability of soil parameters like water holding capacity, can be due
    to several factors (Western and Blöschl, 1999), making it difficult to identify
    its true connection here with WUE/sWUE (Garcia et al., 2010). Nonetheless, the
    soil types with higher water content can supply adequate moisture to plants during
    times when rainfall does not occur. Show abstract Application of CSM-CROPGRO-Cotton

    used to assess growth, development and seed cotton yield (SCY)for varying nitrogen
    increments and planting dates for genotypes (Wajid et al., 2014; Ali et al., 2016),but
    the studywas limited to two planting dates and cultivars only. The model was tested
    for the impacts of different environmental patterns in Georgia, USA (Paz et al.,
    2012) and also used in water and irrigation use efficiency distribution studies
    (Garcia y Garcia et al., 2010). For other crops, DSSAT model have been used to
    suggest optimum planting dates including soybean in India (Kumar et al., 2002),
    and for rice planting dates (Vilayvong et al., 2015). Show abstract CROPGRO-Cotton

    of climate models, large-scale climate modes such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation
    (ENSO) can be used to accurately forecast climate information at least six months
    to one year in advance (Cane, 2005; Jin et al., 2008; Ludescher et al., 2013).
    In addition, many studies have examined the relationship between large-scale climate
    variability, rainfall and agricultural production at regional/national (Garcia
    y Garcia et al., 2010; Royce et al., 2011; Shuai et al., 2013; Nguyen-Huy et al.,
    2017), and at continental/global (Anderson et al., 2017; Ceglar et al., 2017;
    Gutierrez, 2017; Iizumi et al., 2014) scales. All these facts suggest that large-scale
    climate modes may be more appropriate for analyzing the association with crop
    yields over large scale study areas with appropriately identified time lag, and
    reliable and available datasets. Show abstract Simulating future climate change

    yield as influenced by planting date and soil type 2013, Agricultural Systems
    Citation Excerpt : The strong connection between the climate of the southeastern
    USA and ENSO has enabled reliable forecasting of seasonal temperature and precipitation
    for this region up to one year in advance (Brolley et al., 2007; Steinemann, 2006).
    The prediction of ENSO may be helpful to crop growers in tailoring crop management
    to a specific ENSO phase – El Niño, La Niña, or Neutral – to make use or minimize
    the effects of the anticipated favorable or adverse weather conditions and thus
    in achieving higher production (Cabrera et al., 2006; Garcia y Garcia et al.,
    2010; Jones et al., 2000; Paz et al., 2007; Solow et al., 1998). Because planting
    date is one of the most important factors limiting crop yields, it is also an
    important management variable that needs to be tailored to the anticipated ENSO
    conditions. Show abstract View all citing articles on Scopus 1 Current address:

  title: ENSO-based climate variability affects water use efficiency of rainfed cotton
    grown in the southeastern USA
  verbatim_quote1: Our results suggest that WUE of rainfed cotton is differentially
    affected by ENSO. During El Niño years WUE deviations from normal tended to be
    negative for early planting dates but positive and larger for late planting dates,
    no tendency was found for the entire planting window during Neutral years. During
    La Niña years WUE deviations from normal tend to be positive and larger for early
    to mid planting dates, becoming smaller and negative for late planting dates.
  verbatim_quote2: The stronger spatial dependence of WUE during La Niña years than
    during El Niño and Neutral years may imply stronger effects of the former on cotton
    production in the region. As a practical consequence, more attention should be
    given to planning strategies during La Niña years for planting rainfed cotton
    in the southeastern USA.
  verbatim_quote3: Our results suggest that management practices for rainfed cotton
    tailored to ENSO-based climate variability could be used as strategy for reducing
    the vulnerability of the crop to climate variability in the southeastern USA.

    sensing and actuation devices are key enablers to connect real-world objects to
    the cyber world. The Internet of Things (IoT) consists of the network-enabled
    devices and communication technologies that allow connectivity and integration
    of physical objects (Things) into the digital world (Internet). Enormous amounts
    of dynamic IoT data are collected from Internet-connected devices. IoT data are
    usually multi-variant streams that are heterogeneous, sporadic, multi-modal, and
    spatio-temporal. IoT data can be disseminated with different granularities and
    have diverse structures, types, and qualities. Dealing with the data deluge from
    heterogeneous IoT resources and services imposes new challenges on indexing, discovery,
    and ranking mechanisms that will allow building applications that require on-line
    access and retrieval of ad-hoc IoT data. However, the existing IoT data indexing
    and discovery approaches are complex or centralised, which hinders their scalability.
    The primary objective of this article is to provide a holistic overview of the
    state-of-the-art on indexing, discovery, and ranking of IoT data. The article
    aims to pave the way for researchers to design, develop, implement, and evaluate
    techniques and approaches for on-line large-scale distributed IoT applications
    and services. Skip Supplemental Material Section Supplemental Material Available

  analysis:
  - 'The review paper classifies different types and topologies of vertical farming
    (VF) systems, focusing on smart urban vertical farming (USVF). VF is a sustainable
    technology that allows for efficient food production in urban areas with limited
    land availability. The paper emphasizes the importance of sensors and actuators
    in USVF, discussing various types of sensors used to monitor soil, moisture, pH,
    electrical conductivity, temperature, and electromagnetic properties. The integration
    of smartphone sensor technologies into USVF is also explored, highlighting the
    use of accelerometers, gyroscopes, light sensors, magnetometers, proximity sensors,
    humidity sensors, and carbon-based sensors for monitoring crop health and environmental
    conditions.


    The paper further examines how the Internet of Things (IoT) enhances USVF by providing
    real-time data collection and remote monitoring capabilities. The IoT-based smart
    farming framework is described, highlighting its six interconnected subsystems:
    physical layer, network layer, middleware layer, service layer, analytics layer,
    and user experience layer. The potential of IoT in USVF is discussed, emphasizing
    its role in automating irrigation, optimizing nutrient delivery, and monitoring
    crop health. To address security concerns in IoT-based USVF, the paper introduces
    a two-factor authentication scheme that employs both access codes and a mobile
    application for verification.


    Finally, the paper briefly touches upon the social acceptance of USVF, highlighting
    its contributions to reducing pollution, producing clean air and fresh food, and
    promoting sustainable food production in urban areas.'
  - The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the current state of USVF, encompassing
    various technical aspects such as sensor integration, IoT-based control systems,
    and security measures. However, it lacks a detailed discussion of the specific
    challenges and limitations associated with implementing USVF in real-world scenarios.
    Addressing these challenges, such as scalability, cost-effectiveness, energy efficiency,
    and regulatory frameworks, would enhance the paper's relevance and practical value
    for researchers and practitioners in the field.
  - The paper primarily focuses on the technical aspects of USVF, but it could benefit
    from a broader discussion of the economic and environmental implications of this
    technology. Exploring the potential economic benefits of USVF, such as job creation,
    increased food security, and reduced transportation costs, would provide a more
    well-rounded analysis. Additionally, examining the environmental impact of USVF,
    including its energy consumption, water usage, and waste generation, would contribute
    to a comprehensive understanding of its sustainability.

    \ to the ongoing domestic and international\nlockdown for COVID-19. Many have\
    \ already lost their jobs, and businesses have been unstable in the\nCorona era.\
    \ Apart from educational institutions, banks, privately owned institutions, and\
    \ agriculture,\nthere are signs of economic recession in almost all sectors. The\
    \ roles of modern technology, the\nInternet of things, and artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ are undeniable in helping the world achieve economic\nprosperity in the post-COVID-19\
    \ economic downturn. Food production must increase by 60% by\n2050 to meet global\
    \ food security demands in the face of uncertainty such as the COVID-19 pandemic\n\
    and a growing population. Given COVID 19’s intensity and isolation, improving\
    \ food production\nand distribution systems is critical to combating hunger and\
    \ addressing the double burden of\nmalnutrition. As the world’s population is\
    \ growing day by day, according to an estimation world’s\npopulation reaches 9.6\
    \ billion by 2050, so there is a growing need to modify the agriculture methods,\n\
    technologies so that maximum crops can be attained and human effort can be reduced.\
    \ The urban\nsmart vertical farming (USVF) is a solution to secure food production,\
    \ which can be introduced at\nany adaptive reuse, retroﬁt, or new buildings in\
    \ vertical manners. This paper aims to provide a\ncomprehensive review of the\
    \ concept of USVF using various techniques to enhance productivity\nas well as\
    \ its types, topologies, technologies, control systems, social acceptance, and\
    \ beneﬁts. This\nreview has focused on numerous issues, challenges, and recommendations\
    \ in the development of the\nsystem, vertical farming management, and modern technologies\
    \ approach.\nKeywords: automation; smart vertical farming; sensors; Internet of\
    \ Things; urban farming\n1. Introduction\nIn the 21st century, urbanization will\
    \ be faster, and the population will reach 6.3 billion\nby 2050. 67.2% or 6.5\
    \ billion of these, are expected to live in urban areas [1]. To feed this\ngrowing,\
    \ increasingly urbanized population, the United Nations estimates food demand\n\
    needs to rise by 70% [2,3]. Rapid changes in urban built-up areas and skylines\
    \ in providing\nbuildings and infrastructures to cater to the city center’s larger\
    \ population have altered the\nurban climate into unhealthy living conditions.\
    \ This situation threatens the demand for\nthe basic needs of urban dwellers for\
    \ a livable urban living environment. Furthermore, a\nlarger urban population\
    \ also demands a fresh and good quality food supply [4]. Urban\nsmart vertical\
    \ farming (USVF) is one of the potential solutions to help societies meet this\n\
    elevated demand without additional farmland [5–7]. Figure 1 shows the statistical\
    \ data\nabout the use of vertical farming (VF) market in the world 2019 and 2025\
    \ respectively. In\nrecent years, the global VF market has been increasing steadily\
    \ as population sizes grow\nand urban living becomes more common in urban cities.\
    \ The VF industry reached some\n$4.4 billion in 2019, but the market size is estimated\
    \ to rise to $15.7 billion by 2025. The\nopportunity to utilize vertical space\

    \ to provide an ideal environment\nfor the crop chosen.\nNowadays, automation\
    \ plays a vital role in every ﬁeld of life. Some examples are\nmanufacturing,\
    \ transportation, agriculture, utilities, defense, facility operation [16,17].\
    \ The\nbeneﬁts of automation can be applied in water and wastewater, oil and gas,\
    \ electric power\nand telecommunication systems. Automation is generally used\
    \ in many ﬁelds because it\nreduces human effort, is easy to handle, and is more\
    \ effective and efﬁcient. By the name of\nagriculture, farm automation can automate\
    \ most of the agriculture ﬁelds’ processes, such\nas controlling watering systems\
    \ or ﬂow control and moisture control [18,19]. Similarly, it\ncan build a robot/drone\
    \ for spraying pesticides and plowing [20]. Harvesting machinery\nis also used\
    \ for such purposes: a user-friendly farm automation system, easy user control\n\
    for a layman, control water, plant health condition, and crop production [21].\n\
    In terms of human health, the World Health Organization estimates that more than\n\
    half of the world’s farms still use untreated animal waste as fertilizer, which\
    \ attracts ﬂies\nand may contain weed seeds or diseases that can be transmitted\
    \ to plants. VF has the ability\nto produce crops throughout the year, with greater\
    \ control over food safety and biosecurity,\nwhile also lowering inputs such as\
    \ water, pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers [7]. Food\nprotection is a major\
    \ concern of our day, as there have been several incidents of events\naround the\
    \ world resulting in food recalls due to bacterial infectious diseases, resulting\n\
    in billion-dollar losses. After the crop has been picked, the washing of ﬁeld-grown\
    \ items\nposes a further risk of infection from various bacteria and pathogens.\
    \ This stage, on the\nother hand, has the potential to contaminate the entire\
    \ manufacturing process [22]. While\nthe whole world is badly affected by COVID-19,\
    \ the terrible clutches of natural disasters\nstill plague many people worldwide.\
    \ All scientists’ projections show that the number and\nseverity of climate-related\
    \ disasters are increasing due to climate change, which is cutting\noff the COVID\

    \ the features of the 21st century will be deforestation,\nbiodiversity loss,\
    \ climate chaos, and global epidemics; COVID-19 might be the latest\nmanifestation\
    \ of this, which has pointed to the horrible meaning of ‘global economy crisis\n\
    emergency’. Since COVID-19 will have a long-term impact, now is the time to prepare\
    \ to\nintroduce USVF.\nUSVF should become an opportunity for urban dwellers to\
    \ producing their food,\ndespite the limited agricultural land in the city center.\
    \ Integration of any available potential\nspaces inside and outside the building\
    \ by adaptive reuse and retroﬁt as part of the urban\nfarming (UF) technology\
    \ should be taken seriously and fully utilized. The design should\nconsider less\
    \ human intervention in operation due to the hectic life of urbanites. An appli-\n\
    cation of the Internet of things (IoT) can be incorporated into monitoring and\
    \ controlling in\nthe USVF system [23,24]. Thus, the UF technology can have bigger\
    \ involvement and contri-\nbution of urban dwellers. Besides producing their foods,\
    \ it contributes to the improvement\nin a healthy living environment and on urban\
    \ microclimate. UF offers an once-in-a-lifetime\nchance to grow food on already\
    \ built soil, maximize domestic food production, and reduce\nfood travel distances.\n\
    This study will include an in-depth examination of the philosophy of USVF as a\
    \ means\nof enhancing efﬁciency, including its forms, topologies, technologies,\
    \ control structures,\nsocial acceptance, and beneﬁts. This review concentrated\
    \ on a variety of issues, challenges,\nand recommendations related to the system’s\
    \ growth, vertical farming management, and\nmodern technology approach. The importance\
    \ of USVF how it plays a vital role in the\neconomy serve as the starting point\
    \ for this review. As the world’s population is growing\nday by day, there is\
    \ a need to modify those orthodox agriculture methods to fulﬁll the\nincreasing\
    \ demand for food. This modiﬁcation can be done by automating the agriculture\n\
    farm. This idea of agriculture farm automation wants to control water consumption,\
    \ the\nmoisture level of soil and water ﬂow, topologies, technologies, control\
    \ systems, social\nacceptance and enables an agricultural business to be more\
    \ productive, efﬁcient and\nproﬁtable.\n2. Types, General Structure and Materials\
    \ of Vertical Farming\nVertical farming (VF) is a practical technology through\
    \ which large quantities of food\ncrops and medicinal plants can be produced in\
    \ a very small space only with the help of\nadvanced technology [25].\n2.1. Types\
    \ of Vertical Farm\nVF is practiced in about 13 different ways in the modern world\
    \ and each way is so\ntechnologically advanced that it is enough to revolutionize\
    \ agriculture [26]. The following\nsection represents a few types of VF utilized\
    \ for smart UF that are rapidly evolving,\ndiversifying, and improving in the\
    \ future of agriculture [7].\n2.1.1. Hydroponics\nHydroponics is a system that\
    \ can be called a key part of VF [26,27]. Very slowly,\nthis system has gained\
    \ popularity. Hydroponics is an approach to developing vegetation\nbarring soil.\
    \ Instead of having their roots supported and nourished by soil, the plant is\
    \ often\nirrigated and supported with the aid of an inert developing medium like\
    \ cocopeat and is\nfed through nutrient-rich water that is indispensable to maintain\
    \ plant growth. Hydroponic\nstructures use 60–70% much less water than regular\
    \ conventional agriculture [28,29]. In\nthis method, the plant roots are immersed\
    \ in the mixture of essential nutrients of the plant\ninstead of the soil, in\
    \ which case the nutrients have to be mixed in the right proportions.\nFigure\
    \ 2 shows the structure of the hydroponics VF in Sweden [30]. Hydroponic VF\n\
    provides many advantages over traditional agriculture, including more productive\
    \ use\nof water and soil, and a substantial reduction in transport costs is carried\
    \ out in urban\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n4 of 40\nareas. However, this paradigm\

    \ \n2.1.2. Aquaponics \nThe technology of aquaponics is very similar to that of\
    \ hydroponics but con\nin which both plants and fish can be grown in the aquatic\
    \ environment [34]. In \nthe aquatic ecosystem gets a different dimension that\

    Lighting plays an important role in making food for a crop in VF [53]. In the\
    \ VF\nsystem, since the trees are one on top of the other, sunlight cannot reach\
    \ the trees in the\nmiddle of the day. However, to solve this problem, the trees\
    \ should be kept in a place\nwhere they get enough sunlight at the beginning of\
    \ the day and artiﬁcial light all time. The\nconventional light-emitting diode\
    \ (LED) technologies produce 28% efﬁciency. However,\nmaking an indoor agriculture\
    \ system cost-effective LED requires more efﬁciency, at least\naround 50–60% [54,55].\
    \ The work in [55] proposed two techniques LED or high-pressure\nsodium, to overcome\
    \ such lighting issues to grow better crops in VF. In [56], the authors\nindicated\
    \ the application of LED as greenhouse lighting, and it becomes popular in VF\
    \ in\nterms of its lower energy requirements, long lifetime, low cost.\nPlants\
    \ require blue light with a wavelength of 610–720 nm and red light with a\nwavelength\
    \ of 400–520 nm. The study in [57], evaluated the use of LEDs in place of natural\n\
    light to illuminate the plant. The ﬁndings indicated that the LED light would\
    \ assist plants\nin growing with the used of 3:1 ratio of red and blue LED light\
    \ to produce a reddish purple\ncolor. The perfect color combination for plants\
    \ and vegetables has been determined to be\nblue and red. This composition is\
    \ ideal for promoting rapid plant growth. The combination\nof 23% blue and 77%\
    \ red produces optimal plant growth performance [58].\n2.3.3. Solar PV\nSolar\
    \ PV is a farming method but different from the other traditional methods such\
    \ as\nrooftop VF. It is gaining more popularity in terms of enormous used solar\
    \ which is available\nin the urban area [59]. Usually, the crop growth boosts\
    \ up in the VF by photosynthetic\nactive radiation, and it is not enough Solar\
    \ power must be collected by a collection of\nmirrors from the city’s structures\
    \ to reduce the need for supplemental artiﬁcial light [60].\nAs a result, VF is\
    \ looking for alternatives by looking at solar PV as a source of energy.\n2.3.4.\
    \ Water\nIn agriculture such as VF, water is used to produce fresh crops. The\
    \ use of agricultural\nwater makes it possible to produce crops, vegetables. The\
    \ study in [61] addressed a VF\ntechnology that requires 70% less water and the\
    \ amount of water required is also recyclable.\nHistorically, users of traditional\
    \ agricultural systems were expected to manually check the\nwater level in their\
    \ water tanks. Moreover, uncontrolled water use leads to wastage of\nwater, which\
    \ ultimately causes water scarcity to terminate. In [25], the author indicated\n\
    that showers and washing hand water could be used by ﬁltered other than rainwater\
    \ in\nthe smart VF system, which may help optimize water use. In [61,62], the\
    \ authors indicated\nthrough the geoponics method, water utilizes less than 70%\
    \ in VF, while the hydroponics\ntechnique still using 70% water. Water automation\
    \ systems can be used in VF technologies\nto reduce human effort and error. Additionally,\
    \ users can use an Android program to turn\non and off the water pump. This is\

    \ [82]. These methods are less accurate than the \ndirect method but are less\

    \ to measure acidity, power of hydrogen\nvalue, and alkalinity of substances.\
    \ The use of pH sensors plays a vital role in the industry,\nagriculture, manufacturing,\
    \ pharmaceutical, etc. [21,84,85]. In [84,86], the authors indicated\nusing a\
    \ pH sensor to ﬁnd the nutrient level of agriculture soil that connects to the\
    \ Arduino\nmicrocontroller, reducing fertilizers used in smart agriculture. The\
    \ authors also addressed\npH sensors to collect and monitor real data from different\
    \ soil of SF, which save to cloud\nserver. However, the unnecessary growth of\
    \ the plant in the agriculture farm does not\ngrow well for crops. Therefore,\
    \ to overcome such a problem, pH sensor plays a vital role\nin SF.\nSensor of\
    \ Electrical Conductivity\nThe electrical conductivity sensor is largely used\
    \ in SF to measure the soil solute\nconcentration [87,88]. However, there are\
    \ still some limitations to use it properly in the SF.\nIn [88], the authors addressed\
    \ the soil contains some water and salt that harmful to grow\nup crops, which\
    \ can measure using an electrical conductivity sensor based on Faraday’s\nlaw.\
    \ The study in [89] showed an electrical conductivity sensor used to overcome\
    \ soil\nlimitations, such as measuring soil pore water, reducing cost and saving\
    \ working time.\nTemperature Sensor\nUsually, temperature sensors are used to\
    \ measure soil temperature in the farm\nplant [90,91]. The work in [90] indicated\
    \ the importance of plant growth based on tem-\nperature control processes such\
    \ as photosynthesis, transpiration, absorption. In [92], the\nauthors proposed\
    \ an aeroponic system in agriculture, which indicated plant growth and\ndevelopment\
    \ through temperature. Therefore, the temperature sensor plays an important\n\
    role to measure soil temperature, which increases the efﬁciency of plant growth\
    \ and more\ncrops.\nElectromagnetic Sensor\nElectromagnetic sensors calculate\
    \ the potential of soil particles to conduct or produce\nelectrical charge using\
    \ electric circuits [73,93]. As these sensors are used, the soil is now an\nelectromagnetic\
    \ loop, and any changes in local conditions have an instant impact on the\noutput\
    \ captured by a data acquisition system. In [93], the authors indicated electromagnetic\n\
    sensors for soil measure have become smaller, more rugged, faster, more accurate,\
    \ more\nenergy-efﬁcient, wireless, and smarter.\n3.3. Smartphone Sensor Technologies\
    \ in Smart Farming\nTelecommunications advances are allowing the rapid and more\
    \ reliable delivery of\nsensed data on a global scale. A sensor is a device that\
    \ detects and reacts to an electri-\ncal signal. Traditional phone sensing systems\
    \ need additional infrastructure, which is\nunaffordable to the majority of consumers.\
    \ Smartphones have advanced at a breakneck\npace in recent years, and they have\
    \ evolved into an integral part of everyday life. The\nsensors embedded in them\
    \ allow a variety of mobile application, which are assisting and\ntransforming\
    \ our way of life. Mobile sensors technology can enhance UF by improving\nconnectivity,\
    \ increasing the ﬂow of information, ensuring traceability for large buyers, and\n\
    creating economic opportunities [94,95]. This section illustrates concepts of\
    \ mobile sensors\ntechnology in SF that are currently using in the smartphone\
    \ and comparison among several\nresearch outcomes.\nSensors are a tool that measures\
    \ a physical amount and converts to a signal which\ncan be read and utilized by\
    \ other devices. Most of the mobile sensors are equipped on\nsmartphones. Numerous\
    \ forms of sensors are available nowadays, and several common\nsmartphones include\
    \ accelerometers, GPS, illumination sensors, temperature sensors, gy-\nroscope,\
    \ and barometer. These sensors evolved into a high-quality database for tracking\n\
    many facets of a user’s everyday activities. Three types of sensors are installed\
    \ in smart-\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n13 of 40\nphones: motion sensors, ambient\
    \ sensors, and location sensors [94]. The following Table 1\nsummarizes and illustrates\
    \ a set of popular sensors found in today’s mainstream smart-\nphones. The ﬁrst\
    \ category, motion sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, gravity\nsensors,\
    \ and rotational vector sensors, provides acceleration force and rotational force\
    \ mea-\nsurements. Environmental sensors, on the other hand, provide observations\
    \ of the ambient\nenvironment. This includes measuring the ambient air temperature\
    \ with a thermometer\nand the atmospheric pressure with a barometer, as well as\
    \ lighting with a photometer. Place\nsensors, on the other hand, provide information\
    \ about the physical location of the system.\nMagnetometers, GPS, and orientation\
    \ sensors are examples of location sensors [94].\nTable 1. Familiar smartphone\

    \ are largely used in the SF to predict and assist with necessary\nmaintenance\
    \ [96,97]. The study reported in [96] presented accelerometer sensor plays an\n\
    important role in monitoring the conventional use of equipment in the SF. In [98],\
    \ the\nauthors indicated accelerometer sensors detect running components or motor’s\
    \ health\nconditions through motion, speed, vibration inconsistencies. Therefore,\
    \ users can easily\ntrack the component health condition using an android application\

    \ of conservation of angular momentum\nto determine or retain orientation. Nowadays,\
    \ gyroscope sensors are used in a variety of\nareas, including science ﬁction\
    \ and mobile devices [94,99]. In [94], the authors indicated a\ngyroscope sensors\
    \ application to detect conventional equipment rotation in SF using an\nandroid\
    \ phone. However, the drawback of this gyroscope sensors application in smart\
    \ VF\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n14 of 40\ndifﬁcult to implement in terms of\
    \ requiring a complex mathematical model to conducts a\nsignal.\n3.3.3. Light\
    \ Sensor\nThe term “smart agriculture techniques” refers to the practice of using\
    \ a sensor system\nto regulate the amount of light available [100,101]. The light\
    \ sensor is a semiconductor chip\nthat detects the presence or absence of light\
    \ and darkness. Photoresistors, photodiodes,\nand phototransistors are all examples\
    \ of light sensors. The study in [100] proposed artiﬁcial\nlighting as a suitable\
    \ option to conﬁrm most of the time availability of light for the healthy\nplant\
    \ in smart agriculture. However, the drawback of artiﬁcial lighting in the SF\
    \ fault\nﬁnds out and unnecessary light in the daytime. Therefore, to detect the\
    \ fault and On/OFF\nartiﬁcial light system in the smart farm using an android\
    \ phone application which reduces\nthe human effort and optimize cost [102].\n\
    3.3.4. Magnetometer Sensor\nBasically, magnetometer sensors are used in SF to\
    \ measure the direction of the workers,\nsuch as walk forwards, walk backward,\
    \ run, harvest fruit. The advantages of using the\nsensors by mobile phone which\
    \ help farmers with decision-making, enabling them to have\na deeper, richer knowledge\
    \ about their farms [94].\n3.3.5. Proximity Sensor\nThe proximity sensors utilize\
    \ to monitor crop ﬂow during collection data in VF [94].\nIn [71], the authors\
    \ usually indicated crop plant temperature control from a heat source\nmeasured\
    \ by a proximity sensor in SF. The study in [94,103] reported proximity sensors\
    \ are\nutilized to measure grain yield in the agriculture farm, which helps to\
    \ reduce human effort,\nmeasure accurate crop, save time, and can work in harsh\
    \ environmental conditions. How-\never, proximity sensors’ drawbacks can detect\
    \ only the metallic target, and the operation\nrange also limited.\n3.3.6. Humidity\
    \ Sensor\nNowadays, the demand for humidity sensors is gaining popularity in SF\
    \ [104,105].\nThe work in [105] addressed humidity sensors play an important role\
    \ in SF, such as tracking\nthe water level of plants, environmental monitoring,\
    \ which suitable time for proper crop\nselection. The authors also indicated the\
    \ humidity sensors are steady and ﬂexible at\nmeasure bio-interface. Nevertheless,\
    \ challenges still occur for the awareness of capable\nand wide-scale manufacture\
    \ of adjustable humidity sensors for bio-interface applications.\nIn [106], the\
    \ authors indicated humidity sensors increase their demand in agriculture\nfarming\
    \ by controlling the humidity created by porous materials, namely metal-organic\n\
    structure due to their large porosity and tunable shape. However, the drawback\
    \ of this\nmetal-organic structure is its response time is high and displays a\
    \ narrow sensing range.\n3.3.7. Carbon-Based Sensor\nThe carbon-based sensor has\
    \ many beneﬁts as opposed to other types of sensors. The\ncarbon-based structures\
    \ used in sensor applications are carbon nanotube (CNT), nanodia-\nmond (ND),\
    \ fullerene (FLN) and graphene (GPN). Due to their superior electrical, thermal,\n\
    mechanical, and chemical properties, nanodiamonds, fullerenes, graphenes, nanotubes,\n\
    and hybrid structures have been widely used. Carbon nanostructures, as described\
    \ in [107],\nexhibit a high degree of selectivity, especially when functionalized.\
    \ Carbon nanostructures\nhave grown in popularity as gas sensor applications due\
    \ to their promising structure,\nwhich enables gas detection and quantiﬁcation.\
    \ The high surface-to-volume ratio and\nhollow composition make this material\
    \ suitable for gas adsorption and desorption. The\nidentiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation\
    \ of polluting gases, especially hydrogen sulﬁde (H2S),\ncarbon monoxide (CO),\
    \ carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxide (NOx), ammonia (NH3), and\nmethane, is\
    \ one of the primary applications of carbonaceous materials as gas sensors (CH4).\n\
    Electronics 2021, 10, 1422\n15 of 40\nThe special properties of nanomaterials,\
    \ such as their compact scale, large surface area, and\nreactivity, make them\
    \ ideal for use in agriculture. CNTs (carbon nanotubes) are primarily\nused in\
    \ agriculture for germination rate, initial crop production, pesticides, and biosensor\n\
    diagnostic tools and evaluation [108]. Nanotechnology is important in the puriﬁcation\n\
    of water. Carbon nanotubes can be used to purify wastewater [109,110]. Adsorption\
    \ and\ndegradation/detoxiﬁcation are the primary strategies for removing contaminants\
    \ from\nsamples using carbon nanotubes. Additionally, not only is it necessary\
    \ to remove toxins\nfrom various environmental compartments, but it is also necessary\
    \ to control pollution\nlevels. Carbon-based nanomaterials can be used to create\
    \ novel, highly effective biochemi-\ncal sensors for the detection of chemical\
    \ compounds at extremely low concentrations in\na variety of environments. In\
    \ [111], the authors stated that carbon-based nanomaterials\nwill account for\
    \ 40% of all nanotechnology contributions to agriculture, both as additives\n\
    and active parts. The bulk of these implementations are currently in their infancy,\
    \ and this\nsection will highlight some interesting methods.\n3.4. Sensors Technology\
    \ in Farming to Monitoring of the Healthy Growth of Crops\nThe proper growth of\
    \ plants is important to enhance the quality of the crop in the smart\nVF. The\
    \ economic and beneﬁt depend on the proper healthy growth of the plant. However,\n\
    there are some essential elements that are required for the growth of plants,\
    \ such as crop life,\nnutrients, crops health condition, and micronutrients [112,113].\
    \ Therefore, monitoring the\nhealth condition of each plant of agriculture farming\
    \ is essential [114]. Therefore, different\ntypes of sensors utilize to overcome\
    \ such issues in smart VF. Table 2 shows the summary of\nthe method used for crop\
    \ health growth monitoring using a different type of camera model\nsensors in\
    \ SF. This list consists of various types, brands, model numbers and application\
    \ in\nSF. The sensor application in SF includes counting faster crop damage accuracy,\
    \ monitoring\nand detecting defect crop growth, and diagnosing the nitrogen of\
    \ crop and tracking leaf\ndamage from the insect.\nTable 2. Review of methods\

    Electronics 2021, 10, 1422\n17 of 40\nIn [115,128] authors proposed Canon PowerShot\
    \ SX20 and Canon PowerShot SX30\nsensors in farming applications because of cheap,\
    \ easy to manage, and potential versatility\nto count faster crop damage accuracy.\
    \ The study in [116,122] reported a Canon EOS REBEL\nT2i and Sony DSC-W80 sensors\
    \ in agriculture application used to monitor and detect crop\ngrowth. However,\
    \ these sensors’ drawback is that image quality is still inferior and not\nperforming\
    \ well in low light. On the other hand, its advantage performs well in a suitable\n\
    lighting atmosphere and low cost. In [117,121], the authors reported visible spectrum\n\
    cameras and 8 MP camera sensors to measure the early stages of crops grown in\
    \ SF\napplications. The merit of such sensors might work in various lighting environments\
    \ with\nstrong controlling efﬁciency and robustness. Therefore, it is suitable\
    \ for VF applications.\nThe study reported in [119,124] proposed high-resolution\
    \ and Raspberry Pi camera sensors\nin agriculture applications to diagnose the\
    \ nitrogen of crops and track leaf damage from\ninsects. It is suitable in VF\
    \ terms of its longevity, fast counting capability, and continuous\nact without\
    \ damage. The study in [120,123] addressed E450 Olympus and ﬂoral reﬂectance\n\
    sensors in agriculture application to observation insects on each leaf and plant\
    \ growth. The\nsensors gain popularity in terms of simple to use, deliver robust\
    \ real data in a short time,\nand strong controlling capability. In [125,137],\
    \ the authors reported an inverted microscope\nand plant village sensors in SF\
    \ application to automatically monitor health conditions in\nplants, which is\
    \ easy to implement, no need complex mathematical model. The authors\nin [138–140]\
    \ reported DFK 23GM021, Hyper HAD CCD, and Logitech digital webcam\nsensors in\
    \ agriculture application to monitor selecting crops in a greenhouse environment\n\
    and various weeds automatically. However, those sensors’ limitation is the accuracy\n\
    required to be enhanced in terms of data delivery time, efﬁciency, and cost. Therefore,\
    \ to\novercome these issues optimization techniques can be utilized.\nThe study\
    \ in [126,141] reported 0.9R-G and JAI AD-130GE sensors in agriculture\napplication\
    \ for proper identiﬁcation of crops cherries and sweet pepper automatically\n\
    in the USVF. However, the challenges are its complexity, cost, and overall efﬁciency\
    \ still\nvery poor. In [127,142,143], the authors proposed a camcube 3.0, UniﬂyM216,\
    \ and MV-\nVDM033SM/SC sensors in agriculture application to harvest the crops\
    \ such as apple,\ncarrot automatically by a robot in SF. The approach has high\
    \ efﬁciency, low cost, and high\nprecision for the overall system compared to\
    \ conventional methods. However, the main\nlimitations are its monitoring accuracy,\
    \ such as nighttime, tracking the exact position of\ncrops. In [129,131,132],\
    \ the authors proposed Monochrome CCD, SONY NEX5N, and\nSONY DSC-W530 sensors\
    \ in agriculture applications to detect crop growth such as tomato,\npotatoes.\
    \ Therefore, the main advantages of such sensors in USVF overall efﬁciency, large\n\
    accuracy, low error, and easy maintenance. In [133,144,145], the authors proposed\
    \ an\nunmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with geolocation, a UAV platform equipped,\
    \ quadrotor\nUAV-RGB, senseFly eBee with RGB and CIR sensors in agriculture application\
    \ to detect\nheight, biomass automatically of crop plants. Therefore, the main\
    \ advantage of such sensors\nin SF is that they are stable, perform well, have\
    \ small defects, are easy to adapt to new\ntechnology, and they have a simple\
    \ operation.\nFigure 11 shows the smartphone applications in agriculture and the\

    4. IoT Framework on Smart Farming\nWith the development of technology and knowledge-science,\
    \ human thought-\nconsciousness is developing. As a result, everything is changing.\
    \ The revolutionary\ndevelopment of life and human thought in the world over the\
    \ last few decades is far more\nexemplary than the changes in the previous few\
    \ centuries. The transformation of the\nagricultural sector, like all other sectors,\
    \ is much more pronounced. Information-driven\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n19\
    \ of 40\nadvances, when all is said in done, are rapidly progressing with the\
    \ improvement of the IoT\nand may turn into a signiﬁcant piece of things to come\
    \ of farming [146–148]. All modern\nmethods are now being followed to ensure more\
    \ production on less land to meet the needs\nof the age, for example, IoT technology\
    \ in USVF. In [149–151], the authors proposed an IoT\na very modern technology\
    \ in SF in which farmers can ﬁnd out problems of yield, such as\nlacking water,\
    \ crop productivity, yield weakness, and also provide quick solutions to such\n\
    issues. In the study [152,153], authors reported a producing efﬁcient yield controlling\
    \ the\natmosphere situation, soil preparation, crop monitoring by IoT. The study\
    \ also indicated\nIoT delivers real-time sensing data which aids in efﬁcient crop\
    \ production.\nFigure 12 shows details IoT based SF structure. The IoT-based SF\
    \ framework consists\nof six interconnected sub-systems: a physical layer, network\
    \ layer, middleware layer,\nservice layer, analytics layer, and user experience\
    \ layer [154–156]. The physical layer\nof SF is consists of various types of components\
    \ such as sensors, actuators, controllers,\nswitches, network gateways, routers,\
    \ etc. The controller is an essential part of this layer\nwhich plays an important\
    \ role in SF to connect network-related functionalities as well\nas other operations\
    \ of sensors and actuators. The main feature of the network layer is\ncapable\
    \ of transferring root-level data from sensors which use different purpose in\
    \ VF.\nThe network layer is a vital technical layer for smart cultivating, which\
    \ is important for\nsending speciﬁc information, network connectivity to the application\
    \ layer. The network\nlayer incorporates various types of wired and remote interfaces\
    \ for associating the weeding\nmachine, food harvester, and for correspondence\
    \ of machines and sensors with cloud\nframeworks. However, the challenge of the\
    \ network layer in SF where IoT generated a\nhuge amount of data is not only the\
    \ reason for storage or maintenance but also the reduction\nof network efﬁciency\
    \ [157,158]. The middleware layer assumes an essential function to\nboost IoT\
    \ security in SF. In [159,160], the authors indicated an IoT-based middleware\
    \ acts\nas device controlling, setting management, sensation, platform ability,\
    \ and surveillance\nrelevant tasks. Middleware remains in the middle of the utilization\
    \ layer and network\nlayer which are capable of handling information and gives\
    \ a combination for connection\nbetween these layers. However, the middleware\
    \ layer includes safe and sensitive data\nstorage, and data transfer over wireless\
    \ is extremely difﬁcult in IoT deployments. IoT\ncloud support service layer assumes\
    \ a vital part in giving distributed storage, Software-as-\na-Service (SaaS) to\
    \ farming issues. Sensor information procurement, materials recognition,\ncrop\
    \ health condition data monitoring, factual investigation administrations are\
    \ cleared to\nencourage the detecting, activating, and infection recognition operation\
    \ [21,68,161]. The\nanalytics layer’s aim is to ensure big data processing for\
    \ crop production investigation\nyield efﬁciency based on environment condition.\
    \ Another sensor-based IoT system for\nthe analytics layer was presented in [162],\
    \ which ensures crop implement fragmentation,\ncompression, and a reassembly mechanism.\
    \ However, the main drawback of the analytics\nlayer in SF since its direct use\
    \ on IoT devices is not viewed as sensible [149,163,164]. The\nuser experience\
    \ layer is developed to aid the purpose of farmer yield productivity, such\nas\
    \ crop growth condition, efﬁciency, soil quality, and environmental situation.\
    \ IoT plays\na vital role to monitor, control, and deliver to farmers an overall\
    \ situation of VF yield\ncondition by different sensors. However, the main challenges\
    \ still most of the IoT sensors\npower by the battery. Therefore, to overcome\
    \ these issues, energy harvesting technology\ncan be utilized to replace batteries.\n\

    \ temperature, soil, humanity, and claimed from\ntheir home through this sensor\
    \ which is very helpful in remote areas.\nPiezoelectric buzzer\n[193]\nA piezoelectric\
    \ buzzer is one kind of sensor when sound is appalled, and it produces voltage.\
    \ They are utilized in many ﬁelds such as\nenergy harvesting, low power sensors,\
    \ and also SF. Its application in SF to run low-power sensors reduces the dependency\
    \ on the battery.\nElectronic speed control\n[21,194]\nConventional electronic\
    \ speed controllers in farming control room temperature, motor speed and regulate\
    \ the motor voltage. Using this\ndevice in modern farming plays an important role\
    \ in terms of its large energy efﬁciency, less pollution, stability.\nElectronics\
    \ 2021, 10, 1422\n27 of 40\nAgriculture operates somewhat differently today than\
    \ it did a few decades before,\nprimarily due to technical advancements such as\
    \ sensors, processors, robots, and informa-\ntion technology. Agriculture now\
    \ routinely makes use of emerging technology, including\nrobotics, temperature\
    \ and moisture sensors, aerial photography, and GPS. These advanced\ntechnologies,\
    \ precision agriculture, and robotic systems allow businesses to operate more\n\
    proﬁtably, efﬁciently, safely, and sustainably. The primary objective of the Internet\
    \ of things\nis to create a vast network by integrating various sensor devices\
    \ such as GPS, remote\nsensing (RS), radio-frequency identiﬁcation (RFID), laser\
    \ scanners, and networks in or-\nder to comprehend the knowledge exchange of global\
    \ things. IoT can refer to millions\nof networked embedded smart devices capable\
    \ of accumulating data about themselves,\ntheir world, and other connected smart\
    \ devices and linking this data to other devices and\nsystems through the ubiquitous\
    \ Internet [195].\nAmbient daylight, ambient temperature, soil moisture, and humidity\
    \ are all control-\nlable parameters of vertical farming. In addition to the vertical\
    \ columns, the ambient\nparameters must be controlled for each stack, necessitating\
    \ the use of a separate collection\nof sensors for each vertical stack. These\
    \ sensors produce a large amount of data, necessitat-\ning the use of an effective\
    \ data management system. Numerous automation techniques\nare used to maximize\
    \ resource use, including the integration of actuation by automated\nirrigation\
    \ systems, as well as wireless monitoring via IoT in the VF, which is capable\
    \ of\nmanaging sensor data effectively, identifying duplicate sensor readings,\
    \ and visualizing it\nthrough web-based applications.\n4.5. Secure Cloud on Smart\
    \ Vertical Farming System\nThe growth of a country’s population and massive industrial\
    \ development, mainly in\nurban areas, lead to a variety of urbanization problems,\
    \ including housing, food demands,\nschooling, health, and poverty. A new farming\
    \ technique that utilizes minimal land\narea while producing a large crop with\
    \ a secure aspect is highly desired. In [196], the\nauthors addressed a two-factor\
    \ authentication (2FA) scheme to bolster the system’s security\nmeasures. Since\
    \ the electronic device mounted on the indoor farming hydroponic system\ncommunicates\
    \ over the Internet, the 2FA technique is used. Due to the fact that this\nhydroponic\
    \ system would be installed inside the user’s house, this electronic gadget\n\
    will be wired to the user’s home’s network or WIFI. This linking of the computer\
    \ to the\nInternet necessitates proper network protection to mitigate the possibility\
    \ of data leakage\nand sabotage. The 2FA framework will be applied in this system\
    \ through access codes\ngenerated by the gateway (NodeMCU) and a mobile application\
    \ for access veriﬁcation.\nFigure 16 illustrates the total security scheme’s ﬂowchart\
    \ using a 2FA mechanism. It starts\nwith the device module’s controller demanding\
    \ permission to send and receive data over\nthe network via the ThingsSentral-based\
    \ web module. ThingsSentral (TS) is a cloud-based\nIoT device network founded\
    \ by Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia. By supplying the user,\nprogram, and portal\
    \ access code to the TS web service, the controller initiates the ﬁrst\nauthentication\
    \ order. If the codes are valid, TS will send another authentication order.\n\
    The second authentication process generates a request for veriﬁcation and notiﬁcation\
    \ to\nthe customer with a phone app that they must authenticate a request before\
    \ the farming\nmodule can continue operating. The user will authenticate the order\
    \ if approved, at which\npoint TS will allow the remainder of the procedure before\
    \ the controller explicitly stops\nit. If the customer fails to authenticate,\
    \ the whole system is aborted, and the hydroponics\nmodule controller is informed\
    \ of the request’s denial.\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n28 of 40\nElectronics\

    \ of Urban Farming\nThe study in [197] addressed as far as a social responsibility\
    \ of USVF contributes more\nin terms of reducing pollution, produce clean air\
    \ and fresh food without using artiﬁcial\nfertilizer. The authors in [198] indicated\
    \ USVF totally brings new technology to produce\nmore food using less water, without\
    \ soil which falls a very good impact on society. In [199],\nthe authors reviewed\
    \ 386 urban tenants in Berlin based on yield farming space capacity\nin an urban\
    \ area, cost, human effort, and overall food production efﬁciency. While over\n\
    80% of the occupants favored VF on the rooftop of the building in terms of sufﬁcient\
    \ light\nfacility, clean air, low pollution, environmental and ﬁnancial beneﬁts,\
    \ fresh food, easy to\nmonitor, simple maintenance, etc. Moreover, the greater\
    \ part of the respondents was eager\nto purchase agricultural items. The study\
    \ also reported in [199] presented a lack of food\ninsecurity produced from VF\
    \ of urban dwellers because of air contamination levels in urban\nareas. The work\
    \ in [200] analyzed 18 rooftop farming leaves and soil conditions compared\nwith\
    \ the natural crop leaf and soil in Korea. The authors in [201] demonstrated the\
    \ effect of\nrising temperatures on air quality at an outdoor rooftop farm atop\
    \ a seven-story building\nin Brooklyn through an on-site observation attempt.\
    \ In [202], the authors measured the\npollution level, crop production costs,\
    \ and monitoring capability in rooftop vegetable farms.\nTherefore, a USVF is\
    \ required to overcome the problem such as air pollution, huge cost,\nsufﬁcient\
    \ food production, various type of crop production all season.\nAdvantages of\
    \ Urban Smart Vertical Farming\nDue to rapid urbanization, USVF has been introduced\
    \ to achieve food security in\nan urban area. VF can be conceivably gainful in\
    \ expanding crop production and adding\nto maintainable UF. Notable beneﬁts of\
    \ rising food inside the urban area can be helpful\necologically, socially, and\
    \ monetarily. VF can also offer solutions for expanding food safety\nworldwide\
    \ [203]. In [203], the authors indicated several advantages in USVF such as raise\n\
    aesthetic beauty, energy generation, urban growth, organic food, preparation for\
    \ the future,\nconservation of resources, VF ﬂexibility, growing higher quality\
    \ produce, and halting mass\nextinction. Besides, the study in [204] addressed\
    \ that USVF has the beneﬁt of absorbing\npolluted carbon-di-oxide from the air\
    \ and increasing the level of pure oxygen in the air,\nenvironmentally friendly,\
    \ helps to control air pollution and noise pollution. As a result, it\nhas a fair\
    \ weight to maintain air quality. The advantages of USFV protect large houses\
    \ in\nthe city from direct sunlight and helps to keep them cool, helps in air\
    \ ﬁltration by absorbing\ndust. On the other hand, the work in [205] addressed\
    \ beneﬁts of these USVF include\nprotection from weather-related problems, utilize\
    \ technologies and devices, helps in air\nﬁltration by absorbing dust, year-round\
    \ production, huge food production within a small\narea of land.\nIn [206], the\
    \ authors described a VF plant structure that delivers a controlled environ-\n\
    ment, the efﬁciency of farms would generally be autonomous of weather and secure\
    \ from\na weather-related problem. The work in [22] addressed VF can produce foods\
    \ year-round.\nThe study in [22] also presented some crops such as different vegetables,\
    \ strawberries can\nproduce all seasons of the year which provides beneﬁt in terms\
    \ of crops could be sold in\nthe same infrastructures, they will not need to be\
    \ transported between production and sale.\nTherefore, USVF provides less spoilage,\
    \ reduces cost, infestation, and energy required than\nconventional farming encounters.\
    \ The advantages of VF reduce the unemployment rate\nand make a new job opportunity\
    \ for urban people who have less education and low expe-\nrience. The study reported\
    \ in [113] also presented a USVF with much ﬂexibility for crop\nproduction, such\
    \ as water protection, healthy food, cash income, not being labor-intensive,\n\
    manageability, marketability, affordability, and sustainability urban growth.\
    \ The authors\nalso indicated VF utilize for drip and hydroponics crop production,\
    \ which can save 50%\nlesser water than typical planting and can hold water. The\
    \ study in [44] also reported\ndelivering vegetables via VF is simply manageable\
    \ and farmers do not need much focus\non soil and plant during growing.\nElectronics\
    \ 2021, 10, 1422\n30 of 40\nBringing back vegetation in any approach deﬁnitely\
    \ improves the quality of the\nurban environment, which is the main goal of urban\
    \ VF. Urban agriculture via SF is also\nexpected to provide environmental beneﬁts\
    \ to urban dwellers. The improvements in urban\nthermal performance and air quality\
    \ reduce air temperature and energy usage for cooling\nloads. Despite providing\
    \ food security for urbanites, this SF system also able to promote a\nconducive\
    \ and liveable living urban environment. VF can manage by family workers such\n\
    as old people, women, young persons because of clean, safe, less dust, ease to\
    \ marketability\nwith high proﬁt. All these beneﬁts indicated a signiﬁcant impact\
    \ on the application of UF\nin the city context. USVF is to provide efﬁcient and\
    \ effective extension services based on\nthe needs of all classes of growers so\
    \ that they can make the best use of their resources and\ncontribute to sustainable\
    \ agricultural and socio-economic development.\n6. Issues and Challenges\nVF technology\
    \ plays an essential role in reducing future food demand, which is one of\nthe\
    \ world’s biggest problems today. However, existing VF technology faces few challenges\n\
    due to various issues, such as high starting cost, low yield variability, energy\
    \ reliance and\nutilization, producing heat by artiﬁcial lighting was presented\
    \ in [41,71,73,74]. In [73,74],\nthe authors reported VF technology would be gradually\
    \ becoming a non-proﬁt industry if\nnot focus on addressing the current issues\
    \ such as energy use, pollution, economy. As a\nresult, current farming is heading\
    \ for a crisis due to the evils of climate change and the lack\nof signiﬁcant\
    \ response to the use of more materials. As a result of high production costs\n\
    and the adverse effects of harmful chemicals used in agriculture on the environment,\
    \ smart\ntechnology’s high-material grain production technologies do not seem\
    \ to be viable enough\nto meet the needs of a growing population. Future crop\
    \ production is considered to be\nvery risky due to the prevalence of diseases\
    \ and inorganic impacts in the changing climate.\nOther than that, equipment location,\
    \ space, and environmental issues have to be taken\nseriously depending on VF’s\
    \ design to maximize crop production. Additionally, shape\nconsiderations such\
    \ as the form and dimensions of the increasing installation, as well as\nthe spacing\
    \ between plants, are a source of difﬁculty for VF. Leafy greens and herbs, for\n\
    example, the needless vertical spacing between tiers of a vertical rack than ﬂowers\
    \ or fruit\nplants. Additionally, lighting systems should be evaluated for their\
    \ heat management\ncharacteristics and conﬁgured to mitigate the warmth generated\
    \ by VF in order to minimize\nany possible adverse effect on development, while\
    \ allowing for adequate air circulation and\nventilation. It is crucial to keep\
    \ in mind that, while food developed using VF techniques\nmay be safer to eat\
    \ than food grown conventionally, hazards may still exist during the\ngrowing\
    \ phase. Dirt and microorganisms from employees, environmental hazards in the\n\
    nutrient medium, water cleanliness and protection, and post-farm handling activities\
    \ such\nas sorting, trimming, and transportation are all examples of such risks.\
    \ Thus, food safety\nmanagement methods such as hazard analysis critical control\
    \ point analysis, as well as food\nsafety assessment and testing, are critical\
    \ in VF, just as they are in traditional agriculture.\n7. Conclusions and Recommendations\n\
    USVF is a current improvement that shows promise for the future. They will be\
    \ open\nto the insistent and additional combination of current technologies and\
    \ in turn use growing\nconvenience and reduce the effort for humans. This review\
    \ considers the diverse ways of\nhow a USVF may be monitored, controlled, and\
    \ built using the IoT, AI, and sensors. The\ncontinuous ﬂow of real data accrued\
    \ from various sensors or systems deployed in a USVF\nis analyzed, and suitable\
    \ actions must be engaged. Although numerous trends exist, only\na few are being\
    \ utilized, and they suffer from certain drawbacks. Thus, the utilization of\n\
    smart technology shows better performance compared with the existing techniques.\n\
    The aim of this study is to recognize SF by conducting a comprehensive analysis\
    \ of the\nstate-of-the-art of IoT in USVF and identifying the most commonly used\
    \ hardware, plat-\nforms, network protocols, and technologies, as well as their\
    \ applicability to the proposed\nsolution. AI and image processing techniques\
    \ have become more prevalent in recent work\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n31 of\
    \ 40\nto develop intelligent farming management. According to the listed IoT applications\
    \ for SF,\nthe most prevalent application is crop monitoring. Signiﬁcant advancements\
    \ in technical\napplications have made it possible to integrate and link multiple\
    \ sensors in networks\nquickly. The microcontroller has been instrumental in the\
    \ rapid growth of IoT projects,\nespecially in the ﬁeld of precision agriculture.\n\
    Based on the literature survey, many past research works are summarized along\
    \ with\nthe various sensor types, technology, and techniques that are suitable\
    \ for the research. This\npaper reviews the USVF sensors categories, IoT technology,\
    \ and hardware components\nsuitable for monitoring and controlling water level,\
    \ crop health condition, moisture of soil,\nproduction of yield and environment.\
    \ The paper has also focused on a comprehensive\nexplanation of USVF technologies,\
    \ monitor and control operation, smart automation,\nstructure, materials, social\
    \ acceptance, beneﬁt, issues, and various trends and applications.\nFinally, the\
    \ study is suggested constructing a pervasive automation system USVF that\nreduces\
    \ human intervention to a minimum.\nThe review has proposed some signiﬁcant and\
    \ selective suggestions for the further\ntechnological developments of USVF based\
    \ on summarizing, synthesize and viewpoint\nfrom the reviewed literature. Some\
    \ possible improvements have been addressed in this\nreview below:\n•\nFocusing\
    \ on food production via USVF activities than using other conventional meth-\n\
    ods in the city, as mentioned in [7,25,203], USVF produces crops throughout the\
    \ year,\nwith greater control over food safety. This will reduce dependency on\
    \ imported\nvegetables.\n•\nEnhance the user control panel for non-technical users\
    \ who use SF. As a result, it is\npreferable to develop a user-friendly interface\
    \ for powerful applications in a control\npanel and based on user experience.\n\
    •\nAppropriate IoT architecture must be built to address the issue of partitioned\
    \ land\ncultivation, which is a concern in several countries around the world.\
    \ Adequate\nstrategy and preparations should be implemented in advance to address\
    \ this problem.\n•\nBy combining big data analytics and cloud-based computing,\
    \ a decision support\nframework can be developed to improve and forecast futuristic\
    \ yield estimation in\ncrop productivity, quality prediction, crop risk prevention,\
    \ and irregular growth.\n•\nRemote-controlled ﬁeld crop planting systems must\
    \ be built in such a way that au-\ntomated planting machines can plate farmers\
    \ more efﬁciently in the ﬁeld. Cloud\nmonitoring and remote multi-device visualization\
    \ have advanced to the point where\noperators/owners can track real-time manipulation.\n\
    •\nHaving a real-time livestock tracking system that enables cloud services to\
    \ improve\nthe farmer’s economic position intuitively. One basic limitation of\
    \ the majority of IoT\nsystems was their inability to conduct rapid data processing\
    \ over a wide range of\nsensor data sources.\n•\nUse big data analytics to address\
    \ disease management problems across many crops\nand to create a consolidated\
    \ farming machinery control system suitable for large-scale\nagriculture.\n•\n\
    Develop a predictive method for determining the pollination time.\n•\nDevelop\
    \ cost management strategies for large-scale agricultural industries dependent\n\
    on big data analytics.\n•\nProvide an easy-to-use climatic knowledge analytic\
    \ service for farmers.\n•\nAnalyze the proﬁt margins of agri-products using big\
    \ data modeling and a supply\nchain management framework.\n•\nAnalytics can provide\
    \ farmers with prior knowledge of the potential rot time of\nagricultural products,\
    \ thereby reducing loss and increasing beneﬁt in terms of value.\n•\nDevelop a\
    \ smart cell phone application to boost the physical farming situation.\n•\nDevelop\
    \ a web-based scheduling system for pesticide sprays based on crop type, rate,\n\
    and time.\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n32 of 40\n•\nCreate a warning system, as\
    \ most systems use warnings to inform the operator/farmer\nof critical events.\n\
    •\nEstablish irrigation schedules based on sensor data and current weather forecasts.\n\
    Irrigation is often applied using sensor data to predict the required amount of\
    \ water\nand electricity accurately. Irrigation schemes, for example, often make\
    \ use of real-time\nweather forecasts to minimize water and energy consumption\
    \ and prevent excessive\nirrigation.\n•\nDevice security is a critical issue.\
    \ Develop a two-factor authentication scheme to\nbolster the protection of the\
    \ affordable indoor hydroponic system.\n•\nAdditional research should be conducted\
    \ on plants’ tolerance for elevated EC and/or\npH. Knowing how resistant plants\
    \ are too extreme pH levels enables device designers\nto create solutions that\
    \ handle hydroponic systems efﬁciently.\n•\nDrone based pesticide sprayer can\
    \ be made for an automatic spray of pesticides and\nfertilizers to get better\
    \ quality of crops with increased quantity. It could help the\nfarmers to spray\
    \ pesticides evenly throughout their agricultural lands.\n•\nFor a smart storage\
    \ house, we can install humidity and temperature sensors that can\nautomatically\
    \ turn the exhaust fan ON when certain humidity or temperature reaches\nthe temperature\
    \ danger zone for food. For food, this danger temperature zone is\nbetween 41\
    \ and 135 degrees for height.\n•\nFor water and food control for cattle, we can\
    \ use conveyor belts to automatically\nsupply food to cattle.\n•\nIncrease in\
    \ monetary income for urban dwellers that uses the smart urban farming\nsystem\
    \ to grow vegetables and sells unconsumed vegetables.\n•\nWe can install a biogas\
    \ plant in the farmhouse to meet all the electric requirements\nand to fully use\
    \ the waste materials of cattle.\n•\nWe can also install a circuit to automatically\
    \ get the power meter reading and electricity\nbills on our cell phone and hence\
    \ get up to date about the power consumption of\nUSVF.\n•\nAtmospheric pollutants\
    \ due to being in an urban environment have a negative effect\non the plants,\
    \ therefore by providing sufﬁcient water to plants (this aids in pollution\nremoval\
    \ and temperature reduction), we utilize long-lived and low-maintenance trees.\n\
    •\nfsUtilize carbon-based nanomaterials can be used as gas sensors to combat air\
    \ pol-\nlution, which has a detrimental effect on plant health, by detecting and\
    \ quantifying\npolluting gases, primarily hydrogen sulﬁde (H2S) and carbon monoxide\
    \ (CO) based\nin [107,108].\nAuthor Contributions: Writing—original draft preparation,\

    Abstract: Precision agriculture is a breakthrough in digital farming technology,
    which facilitates the appli-

    cation of precise and exact amount of input level of water and fertilizer to the
    crop at the required time for

    increasing the yield. Since agriculture relies on direct rainfall than irrigation
    and the prediction of rainfall

    date is easily available from web source, the integration of rainfall prediction
    with precision agriculture

    helps to regulate the water consumption in farms. In this work, an edge computing
    model is developed for

    predicting soil moisture in real time and managing the water usage in accordance
    with rain prediction. A

    soil moisture prediction hybrid algorithm (SMPHA) has been developed that revolves
    around the decision-

    making techniques with live environmental parameters including weather parameters
    for the prediction of

    soil moisture through the impact of precipitation. Numerous algorithms with the
    combination of regression

    + clustering are estimated, and it is inferred that XGBoost + k-means outperforms
    other algorithmic com-

    binations that is deployed in edge model. This model is used as an intermediary
    between the end IoT

    devices and cloud that results in the saving of computationally intensive processing
    performed on cloud

    servers. The servers located on a local edge network perform the developed algorithmic
    computations.

    Avoiding transmission over the cloud results in signiﬁcant latency, response time,
    and computation power

    savings and therefore increases the eﬃciency of data transfer. The proposed edge
    computing model is

    implemented in Raspberry Pi as an edge, Heroku as cloud, and edge nodes as the
    combination of Pi with

    actuators and sensors. The monitored data from Pi are stored in MongoDB webserver
    that is controlled by

    Web dashboard. Finally, the developed model is implemented in cloud and edge where
    the edge server

    implementation performs better in terms of latency, bandwidth, throughput, response
    time, and CPU

    memory usage.

    1 Introduction

    It is evident that agriculture always has a specialized role in the anthrophonic
    evolution and has been

    serving as an important economic factor for the growth of a country [1]. Around
    58% of the population

    depend on agriculture as the chief source of livelihood in India. The quality
    and productivity of agricultural

    products have declined over these years as several factors have inﬂuenced the
    crop productivity both

    directly and indirectly. Some major factors that aﬀect the crop production are
    climatic changes, global

    warming, and water scarcity [2]. The agricultural land’s productivity is aﬀected
    by the direct and indirect

    changes in climate [3,4]. The crop growth has been already aﬀected by the changes
    in climate incurred by

    global warming. The nutrition quality of soil, ground water level, sea, and ocean
    are aﬀected by the

    modiﬁcations in average temperature, rainfall, and extreme weather conditions
    such as hail storms, dust

    storms, heatwaves, etc. due to global warming [5,6]. Degradation of soil is primarily
    created by various

    methods including 93.7% by water erosion, 9.5% by wind erosion, 5.9% by salinity
    and alkalinity, etc.

    Further changes in climate would inﬂuence adversely the crop production [7]. Since
    water is an indispen-

    sable requirement for plants and cultivation, the high level of soil is eroded
    and thereby the fertility is also

    declined. Due to the ever-changing climate, water scarcity has become a huge problem.
    Drought-like

    conditions is already formed in several areas and thereby the present and conventional
    farming practices

    are not suitable. New and unique environment preserving techniques are the need
    of the hour [8].

    The conventional approaches in agriculture are enhanced by the advent of several
    advancements in

    technology [9]. These new improved methodologies ensure optimized utilization
    of resources, accurate

    forecast of water needs and environmental parameters, reduction of human intervention,
    etc. [10]. Conse-

    quently, the outcomes of crops in terms of yield and quality are higher with cost-eﬀective
    methods. One

    such booming technology is the Internet of things (IoT) [11].

    IoT is the collection of components embedded in the sensor for measuring and transferring
    data via

    network devices as sensed from pumps and tractors to weather stations. Primarily,
    IoT deals with the

    transmission and reception of data related to farms through devices using the
    Internet for prediction

    and providing decisions to the farmers. IoT-based methodologies has brought a
    changeover in agricultural

    patterns and farming approaches [12]. IoT devices can gather information about
    soil moisture, chemical

    properties, dam levels, livestock health, and weather details in real time. The
    information acquired from IoT

    devices facilitates the farmers in tracking farms periodically. Farmers can save
    time and money by

    responding faster to farm conditions. Cloud computing models integrated with on-ﬁeld
    agricultural sensors

    need to be incorporated for tackling the issue of processing huge voluminous data.

    One of the major challenges of IoT is the processing of huge datasets in a sequential
    way. Some of the

    key factors that need to be focused on this process are as follows: information
    about the type and nature of

    data, the way of acquiring the data, etc. The preliminary stage comprises acquiring
    the data and ingesting

    the data to the system. Substantial cognizance of data are achieved as the data
    pass through all the

    gateways where it is cleansed and transformed before entering into the system.
    In the near future, dynamic

    prediction of soil moisture and precipitation techniques are to be developed for
    smart irrigation systems.

    Therefore, a system is developed for eﬃcient and optimal utilization of fresh
    water in irrigation along with

    drip irrigation system. It aids in ﬁnding which one of the plants fails to get
    suﬃcient water. When the water

    supply is provided the next day, this delay should not disturb the system. It
    becomes important for the

    farmers to understand the optimal usage of water and fertilizers to bring out
    sustenance in the agricultural

    industry. Therefore, processing must be done for analyzing the data, so that patterns
    can be analyzed and

    planning can be done for the long term, accordingly. Hence, it gives a broad vision
    in deciding where the

    processing is to be done exactly. Therefore, it is obvious that not all data are
    crucial, and it provides a clear

    view of which data need to be stored, discarded, and retained for both long-term
    and short-term purposes.

    Thus, all these challenging issues require to be addressed and that is where storage
    technologies are

    actually highlighted. The poor quality of Internet access in developing nations
    makes the implementation

    quite challenging. An applicable solution to solve this problem is through edge
    computing where the

    essential data could be oﬄoaded from the cloud over the edge of the cloud, and
    this is the exact point

    where the approach of smart sensing with edge computing gets in.

    With the purpose of broadening the potential of edge computing and using it in
    the agriculture domain,

    a novel approach using machine learning (ML) methods is proposed for analyzing
    the data acquired by the

    IoT devices deployed at the farm. Here, the data acquired from IoT components
    undergo preprocessing and

    ML models on the edge nodes to analyze and assess the appropriate results for
    providing the best instruc-

    tions for controlling the actuators (e.g., light, pumps at diﬀerent locations)
    in the farms.

    This article presents an automated system, as shown in Figure 1, to predict the
    soil moisture using the

    ﬁeld information acquired from the self-designed sensor node deployed at the ﬁeld
    and the forecast

    information of weather via Internet. A unique algorithm has been developed that
    revolves around the

    IoT-enabled edge computing model for smart irrigation system

    

    633

    machine learning techniques for the prediction of soil moisture. Here, many algorithms
    with the combina-

    tion of regression + clustering was estimated, and it is inferred that XGBoost
    + k-means outperforms other

    algorithmic combinations, and therefore, it is deployed for the prediction of
    soil moisture in the proposed

    work. The proposed algorithm makes eﬀective irrigation decisions with optimized
    usage of water in a more

    accurate and reliable manner. The eﬀective decision-making refers to the process
    of predicting the rainfall,

    thereby reducing the water usage in advance by the proposed algorithm in accordance
    with the predicted

    rainy days. Through this automatic decision-making, over watering is avoided by
    saving the soil. The

    server-side software is developed with node-side connectivity using the information
    for visualization and

    decision support features. This proposed algorithm is implemented in edge to prove
    the eﬃciency of the

    edge server handling the automated system better than the cloud control. The performance
    of the decen-

    tralized edge-based architecture has been evaluated for downloading the hybrid
    algorithm from cloud in

    real time execution. The performance can be enhanced by adopting edge computing
    architecture and

    measured with the help of network parameters like latency, bandwidth, and response
    time. Edge computing

    capacity is also estimated using the CPU processor and memory consumption while
    executing the proposed

    algorithm with irrigation scheduling.

    growth. It becomes necessary for evaluating multiple AI models simultaneously
    in an actual cultivation

    environment for comparing AI models under the same conditions. Due to the working
    of existing irrigation

    systems on the cloud, communication is instable in the concurrent evaluation of
    AI models. However, the

    instability does not induce an edge node in its performance.

    The factors such as type of plant, soil, climate, humidity, temperature, and soil
    moisture need to be

    considered for the irrigation system packed with potential smart decisions. The
    nature and type of plant,

    soil, and climate are queried by ontology (branch of metaphysics dealing with
    the nature of being), whereas

    other factors such as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture are sensed by the
    sensor network. The

    trained ML model predicts the watering decisions based on ontology and other factors
    as mentioned earlier.

    Smart irrigation has three modules: (i) sensor network modules that sense the
    parameters impacting the water

    requirement by using sensors DHT22, light sensor BH1750, and HL-69 hygrometer
    for sensing the temperature,

    soil moisture, light, and humidity in air. (ii) Edge and IoT server’s module to
    send and receive data through

    HTTP requests. (iii) Training module in which KNN is applied on the sample dataset
    for training and decision-

    making regarding the water needs. Based on the input values, the trained model
    categorizes the input into ﬁve

    possible classes: highly not needed, not needed, average, needed, and highly needed
    [14].

    A decentralized smart irrigation approach is proposed for strawberry greenhouses
    in contrast to con-

    ventional cloud-based solutions for keeping the agricultural data at the edge
    of the network. A full-scale

    smart irrigation system in an actual strawberry greenhouse environment is developed
    after a small-scale

    smart irrigation networking prototype system and a reference architecture targeting
    edge data distribution

    for strawberry greenhouse applications are framed. A three-step industrial approach
    is formed for

    designing, implementing, and validating a solution for smart strawberry irrigation
    in greenhouses and

    keeping the corresponding data at the edge of the network at the same time: (i)
    A small-scale smart

    irrigation prototype solution with oﬀ-the-shelf hardware and software equipment
    is tested and evaluated

    on various types of plants for gaining useful insights for deployments on a large
    scale. (ii) A reference

    network architecture is designed for targeting smart irrigation and edge data
    distribution speciﬁcally for

    strawberry greenhouses. (iii) A large-scale system in an actual strawberry greenhouse
    environment is

    developed in Greece, incorporating the proposed reference architecture [15].

    Edge computing is proposed for addressing the issues by taking advantage of computing
    resources in

    the edge of the network. The issues such as an edge mobile device make it easier
    to achieve low end-to-end

    latency, high bandwidth, and low jitter to services located on the edge network.
    An edge can enforce the

    privacy policies of its owner prior to the release of the data to the cloud through
    edge analytics. If a cloud

    service becomes unavailable due to network failure, cloud failure, or a denial-of-service
    attack, a fallback

    service on a nearby edge can temporarily mask the failure. Cloud services, partial
    analysis, and control

    functions are extended to the edge nodes from the cloud data center. Edge nodes
    facilitate the timely

    monitoring of sensors in smart farming by the reduced latency and enhanced data
    transmission. Due to

    these factors, edge computing is applied through farming [16,17]. A three-tier
    open-source software plat-

    form we proposed by authors, and the platform enhanced the precision agriculture
    by introducing edge

    computing and fog computing. An network functions virtualization (NFV)-based approach
    is deployed for

    performing the local operational decisions at the edge level for mitigating the
    inﬂuence of network failures

    while using cloud data centers [18]. For control processing in smart farming,
    a platform enabling cost-

    eﬀective sensor/actuator network based on IoT, utilizes edge computing [19,20].

    The authors in ref. [21] predicted the soil moisture using a mathematical model
    that measures the

    values given by a sensor matrix on the ground. Due to the huge interval in measurements
    (10 minutes), the

    model presented estimated error by more than 10%. This methodology has incorporated
    the online

    approach by making the sensors to send data every minute to edge devices without
    time-based interruption.

    The authors of ref. [22] applied a combinative approach of using ﬁeld sensor network’s
    data along with

    weather forecast station’s data for the management of optimality in water conditions
    for the enhanced

    growth of grapes. The generated data are forwarded to a web server, which displays
    graphics without

    statistical analysis of such data. The analysis must be performed a posteriori
    by the user.

    The watering mechanism for a plant via IoT methodology is devised by the proposed
    smart irrigation

    model without acquiring any pre-processed data. A prototype application is developed,
    which gets adapted

    to the parameters needed in irrigation after a couple of human-made irrigations.
    With the usage of various

    ML algorithms, several tests are devised for manual and automated irrigations
    for the performance evalua-

    tion. After the evaluation using four diﬀerent ML algorithms such as logistic
    regression (LR), K-nearest

    neighbors (KNN), Gaussian naive Bayes (GNB), and gradient boosting regression
    trees (GBRT), it is found

    that GBRT outperforms other algorithms. To analyze the overall performance, a
    test bed for the sensor edge,

    mobile client, and the decision service on the cloud is established. Two diﬀerent
    indoor species are selected

    as test items for the prototype, namely, Peace lily and Sardinia. The outcomes
    were quite good, and it is

    inferred that the prototype has learned the patterns of irrigation and making
    decisions automatically with a

    high rate of accuracy [23].

    The authors from ref. [24] adopted the deep learning methodology for detecting
    the type and the

    category of the plant using an automated plant irrigation system. The water necessity
    of the plant is

    determined using the recognition of predeﬁned set of plant images and data set
    acquired from farm. It

    utilizes the database for fetching the irrigation information after the recognition
    process is completed.

    Modeling the training processes are time consuming as voluminous set of images
    needs to be stored.

    The authors in refs [25,26] incorporated ML methods in the irrigation decision
    support model using a

    pre-processed irrigation data set. A model is developed for learning the irrigation
    needs of any plants

    progressively rather than using a readily available dataset. Several ML algorithms
    are evaluated with their

    precision for concluding the irrigation decisions. Manual irrigations are performed
    two times before making

    precise decisions. Due to the dynamicity in model, data processing is done progressively,
    and it can be

    applied to several plants having varying irrigation conditions. There is a need
    for the learning model that

    can be trained by itself using a comparatively lighter learning process using
    environmental parameters that

    do not need larger storage in the system but need higher computation. From the
    aforementioned survey for

    making a precise decision with instant computation locally, edge computing needs
    to be integrated into the

    irrigation system. This article is directed towards presenting a platform that
    implies IoTs and edge com-

    puting in monitoring soil moisture via sensors, data communication between sensors
    and edge devices, and

    an Analytics-as-a-Service cloud. It analyzes the collected data in the form of
    a density map of soil moisture

    for denoting the areas in need of greater or lesser frequency of irrigation. Here,
    density map does not refer to

    the geographical point data by satellite mapping, and it actually denotes the
    point of dry area and watery

    area through soil moisture detection point. This point is averaged among areas
    of irrigation to be done and

    the irrigation process is controlled with prediction of rainfall using the proposed
    system.

    3 The proposed system

    The proposed learning model for irrigation is implemented in a prototype IoT system
    that has four compo-

    nents: (i) Edge node layer – This layer consists of sensors, actuator, and two
    microcontrollers. In this layer,

    edge node acquires the sensor data from the surroundings and controls the actuator
    for actuating water

    pumps to start irrigation. (ii) Edge server layer – This layer consists of Raspberry
    Pi that act as edge server

    and capable of multitask processing. Here, edge server controls the edge nodes
    for sending signal and

    receiving data at regular interval of time. It is also connected to the cloud
    server for receiving developed and

    trained machine learning model to be deployed and make irrigation decision for
    controlling edge nodes.

    (iii) Edge service layer – This layer is deployed in the edge server and it is
    responsible for controlling the

    whole system through a developed web dashboard. The dashboard has live feed data,
    control of edge

    nodes, and cloud services access. This service layer also has the control access
    of the proposed machine

    learning model. (iv) Cloud server layer – This layer composed of cloud services
    and cloud storage where its

    role is to train the machine learning model and store the data in database. It
    sends the trained proposed

    model to the edge server for decision-making regarding irrigation scheduling.
    The comprehensive inter-

    connections in the system are shown in Figure 2. The proposed IoT-based smart
    irrigation system includes

    ﬁve major components: ﬁeld deployed module, Web-based interface, Web API weather
    input, soil moisture

    prediction mechanism, and edge communication model.

    3.1 Field deployed module

    In the ﬁeld requirements, a wireless sensor network of the sensor nodes needs
    to be deployed as shown in

    Figure 3. Here, ﬁeld data collection device accommodates four diﬀerent sensors:
    Capacitive Soil Moisture

    Sensor V2.0, DS18B20 Water Proof Temperature Sensor Probe for soil temperature,
    ultraviolet (UV) Light

    Radiation, DHT11 – Temperature and Humidity Sensor Module, and GYML8511 Analog
    Output Ultra-Violet

    636

    

    S. Premkumar and AN. Sigappi

    Light Sensor Module. An Arduino Mega connected to Raspberry Pi 4 Model-B read,
    the output of these

    sensors where the program is developed in Python for the Pi model to fetch the
    hourly data from sensors

    and store the data in MongoDB [27] database. It is then synchronized with the
    server database using the

    developed web service. A Wi-Fi-enabled Arduino controls the water pump connected
    to a relay switch.

    Figure 2: Components of the proposed system.

    Figure 3: Real-time prototype of the proposed edge model.

    IoT-enabled edge computing model for smart irrigation system

    

    637

    For the real time monitoring, a trigger is made for controlling the web service
    from the responsive web-

    based interface. The irrigation decisions are checked periodically by the proposed
    model performed in the

    server. The water pump is actuated, and irrigation process is started only if
    the server makes any irrigation

    decision. A wireless sensor network (WSN) [28] scenario with ZigBee [29] technology
    can be implemented

    for a large farming area in which several sensor nodes can be aﬃxed in the speciﬁed
    area and every sensor

    node possesses sensors similar to a standalone device. Then, the Arduino Mega
    reads the sensor output

    connected to ZigBee for transferring data to Gateway Node for aggregating the
    received data and storing it

    in MongoDB locally and also for transferring the data via web service to the edge
    server.

    3.2 Web-based interface

    The proposed framework consists of a web-based application to allow farmers visualize
    the growing data

    and interacting with the garden in real time. In addition, users can also be able
    to examine and analyze the

    historical growing data, if needed, through functionalities such as irrigation
    control, motor control predic-

    tion model deployment, and manual data entry implemented in this web application.
    Here, Node.js was

    chosen for developing the web application [30,31], while MongoDB [27] was utilized
    as the database system.

    Data stored in the database, which is deployed in the cloud, will be used for
    further data analysis in the

    future. The web application’s functions are designed following a software design
    pattern called model-

    view-controller (MVC) as shown in Figure 4. In the frontend, ChartJS is used to
    represent data through

    dynamic charts. The web application is also used as an interface to manage all
    the physical devices/

    actuators in the garden. To deploy the web-server to the cloud, a cloud platform
    as a service (PaaS), namely,

    Heroku, had been utilized. Heroku is a cloud platform that provides platform as
    a service (PaaS), facilitates

    the creation of applications and deploying these online rapidly [32,33]. It also
    enhances scalability and

    functionality by integrating several add-on services. The ﬁeld data are sent to
    the server by Raspberry Pi

    using this web service. This web service manages the network outage/ﬂuctuation
    during data synchroniza-

    tion from the ﬁeld device to the server by taking the help of ﬂag settings at
    the database level. The interface

    facilitates the scheduling of irrigation along with visualizing real time sensors
    and predicted soil moisture

    for upcoming days and precipitation information. By using the denoted threshold
    value of soil moisture

    suggested by agronomists, the irrigation can be scheduled by the user. The system
    maintains the threshold

    value depending on the predicted pattern of soil moisture and precipitation information.
    The process of

    irrigation is initiated automatically and stopped after the speciﬁed threshold
    value generated from the

    proposed algorithm of soil moisture when it is reached.

    Figure 4: Web interface for the irrigation system.

    3.3 Web API weather input

    The weather prediction data are collected by a web service developed in Python.
    The forecast data such as

    humidity, temperature, ultra violet index, precipitation, and cloudiness of web
    forecasting portals like

    Open Weather API are aggregated by the developed web service [34]. These portals
    provide the forecasted

    information in HTML, XML, or JSON format. The predicted data with JSON format
    are read by the developed

    web and stored in database at the edge server, which is concerned in the prediction
    algorithm. Also, these

    data are utilized as testing dataset in the ML model for predicting the soil moisture.

    3.4 Soil moisture prediction mechanism

    An algorithm for predicting the soil moisture based on data derived from ﬁeld
    sensors and weather fore-

    casting using the combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning
    techniques has been

    developed underpinned by regression algorithms and k-means clustering for estimating
    the diﬀerence/

    change in soil moisture owing to weather conditions. Many regression algorithms
    are compared against

    each other and infusing each of them with k-means to check the preciseness in
    mean square error (MSE),

    R2, accuracy and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for prediction of soil
    moisture of upcoming days

    with the help of sensor data and weather forecasting days. The information about
    soil moisture for the

    upcoming days and suggestions for irrigation in accordance with the prescribed
    levels of soil moisture and

    predicted precipitation values, thereby saving energy and water, is presented
    by the algorithm. The infor-

    mation generated from the device and the predicted values from the algorithm soil
    moisture prediction

    hybrid algorithm (SMPHA) are stored in the server.

    3.5 Edge communication model

    The communication protocols in the proposed framework are ﬂexible and transparent
    in nature for

    accepting both wired and wireless methodologies. For the maximum utilization of
    potentiality in edge

    computing components, the communication among various components in the edge-IoT
    system requires

    intense probing by using the versatility among the devices in network edges. For
    transferring the data

    gathered from pivot sensors, a communication technology such as Zigbee [35] is
    needed for the irrigation

    systems. Therefore, the communication component in the proposed work is classiﬁed
    into three main areas

    as shown in Figure 5. The Message Query Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol is
    used for the

    Figure 5: Proposed edge communication model.

    IoT-enabled edge computing model for smart irrigation system

    

    639

    communication in the proposed system. The analysis in ref. [36] presented seven
    IoT messaging protocols

    (MQTT, CoAP, XMPP, AMQP, DDS, REST-HTTP, and WebSocket) as communication protocols
    that play a

    major role in smart farming. The authors have concluded that MQTT proved to be
    the most secure protocol

    after probing all the protocols with respect to latency, energy and bandwidth
    requirements, throughput,

    reliability, and security. Moreover, MQTT is secure in both end-to-end architecture
    and gateway server

    architecture. In an MQTT setup, a MQTT server termed as MQTT broker executes on
    the IoT solution [37].

    Under a common identiﬁer, a “publisher” and a “subscriber” link among themselves
    to this broker. In the

    IoT solution, publishers and subscribers are the IoT devices and IoT hubs or control
    devices, respectively.

    When the publishers have new data for recording, the data are published to the
    broker. The broker then

    ﬂags that it has new publisher data, and the corresponding data are read by the
    subscriber. Then, the

    subscriber analyzes the data and reacts accordingly.

    The ﬁrst level accomplishes with connecting the end users to system with the help
    of mobile or web-

    based applications through the Internet. The next level (cloud computing server)
    deals with the connection

    of web server and MQTT broker for directing the user requests and other components
    at the edge landscape

    or from the farms to the right cloud-based services like displaying the real time
    status of the farm for the

    users, triggering a new deployment of the updated ML model to the corresponding
    edge node. The third

    level (farming area) is directed toward the deployment of sensors and IoT devices
    (actuators) for commu-

    nicating with other components in the entire system.

    4 Deployment of soil moisture prediction hybrid algorithm

    The watering mechanism of the plant has diﬀerent approaches in the proposed model.
    Primarily, the system

    is trained with manual irrigations datasets during the process of learning with
    respect to suggestions

    deﬁned by agronomists. The model is trained to learn the needs of irrigation in
    the ﬁrst level of deployment

    in cloud without the inclusion of pre-processed data. After acquiring the required
    data and training, the

    proposed system is initiated to grasp the plant’s watering needs by undergoing
    plenty of manual irrigations.

    Thereafter, manual irrigation is not required and the system makes automated decisions
    in watering using

    the gathered data and the application of ML methods. The proposed model then decides
    the irrigation

    strategies automatically using ML methods without the need including collected
    datasets in the automatic

    irrigation process. The proposed model can be improved through the learning process
    when the number of

    precise irrigation inputs is provided to the model at each stage of training.

    The decision-making procedure is developed with two modules for irrigation strategies
    according to the

    soil moisture prediction for upcoming days. The ﬁrst module deals with training
    the model in cloud with

    manual irrigation datasets through steps such as data collection, data preprocessing,
    training, and model

    development. The system acquires values of air temperature (TH), soil temperature
    (SMT), soil moisture

    (SM), humidity (HU), and ultraviolet rays (UV) periodically from the physical
    environment in the data

    collection stage, which is essentially required for arriving at the watering decisions.
    Also, the time of

    performing the manual irrigation is recorded in the database. These data are timestamped
    and stored in

    as datasets to aid in making decisions for knowing the time of irrigation. In
    the next step of pre-processing,

    inconsistencies are eliminated and outliers caused by sensor errors are detected
    from the irrigation dataset,

    thereby helping in the removal of broken data. The training stage involves the
    application of supervised

    machine learning (ML) algorithms. Here the regression algorithms such as support
    vector regression (SVR),

    multiple linear regression (MLR), lasso regression (LR), decision tree regressor
    (DTR), random forest

    regressor (RF), and XG-boost regressor (XB) techniques are used for the deployment.
    The regression algo-

    rithms are trained using the collected datasets. Finally, through training, regression
    models are created,

    namely, SVR model, MLR model, LR model, DTR model, RF model, and XB model that
    are been combined

    with the second module for decision-making.

    The second module caters to the prediction of irrigation for upcoming days by
    infusing the weather data

    as an input to the regression trained models. The live datasets from the weather
    API for future prediction of

    640

    

    S. Premkumar and AN. Sigappi

    soil moisture variable are used. The dependent variables from weather forecast
    data like temperature (TH),

    humidity (HU), ultraviolet (UV), and precipitation (PC) are tested in the aforementioned
    model for soil

    moisture prediction. Then, the regression trained model is evaluated and deployed
    using the weather

    testing data for the prediction of soil moisture in accordance with the precipitation.
    After the prediction

    of data for the upcoming days, these developed regression models are combined
    with unsupervised ML

    algorithm named k-means clustering for estimating the changes incurred in soil
    moisture prediction due to

    the impact of weather conditions. Further, each regression models with k-means
    algorithm are evaluated

    for performances in terms of irrigation decision-making process as shown in Table
    1. The combined algo-

    rithms are estimated through MAPE, MSE, R2, execution speed, power consumption,
    and accuracy. The

    estimation and computation of these parameters are detailed by the authors in
    ref. [38].

    XGBoost + k-means (XB+k-means) approach provides more accuracy with less MSE comparatively
    and

    also the R2 with 98% in soil moisture prediction using combined approach is given
    in Table 1. It is evident

    that the proposed combination performs better when compared to other regression
    + k-means-based

    approaches. XB + k-means-based hybrid machine learning algorithm is applied in
    irrigation planning

    module on account of aforementioned performance metrices of ML. Although it performs
    moderately in

    terms of execution time and power usage, it is selected for the deployment in
    edge computing as it has

    better performed in terms of accuracy, R2, MSE, and MAPE metrices. It is observed
    that the prediction of soil

    moisture for the upcoming days from the proposed algorithm (XB+k-means) is nearer
    to the actual value as

    shown in Table 2, and hence, XB+k-means is selected for the implementation of
    SMPHA in edge-based

    irrigation scheduling.

    4.1 Hardware setup

    IoT system is crucial to handle, collect, and transfer the data to the computing
    nodes at the edge or in the

    cloud. These devices are connected to the edge nodes through wireless communication
    protocols like

    ZigBee. It is used in reducing the latency and loss of data. An Arduino micro-control
    unit controls the

    combined IoT sensors and actuators at the same part of a ﬁeld into a cluster,
    each connected to a Raspberry

    Figure 2 shows an edge architecture with a Raspberry Pi connected to two components:
    Arduino Uno and

    Arduino Mega units via ZigBee connection. The ﬁrst Arduino Mega node is responsible
    for collecting data

    accordance with upper

    layers (from the edge web server). The trained (cloud) and deployed ML model in
    edge nodes provides the

    necessary instructions to the edge nodes.

    4.2 Web layer setup

    The deployment of web server assists the user in planning and managing the irrigation
    system. It visualizes

    the crucial information of factors like temperature of air and soil, UV, humidity,
    and soil moisture in live

    irrigation with real time updates in the form of various charts. In accordance
    with the selected ﬁeld, the web

    application redirects the user to the ﬁeld’s dashboard as shown in Figure 4. The
    dashboard consists of ﬁeld

    parameters as well as control signals for activating all the physical devices/actuators
    at the garden layer.

    These signals are denoted as switch buttons, and each switch controls (turn on/oﬀ)
    a particular kind of

    actuator (for instance, water pump to start and stop the irrigation). The user
    interface facilitates remote

    controlling of the ﬁeld by just clicking on the buttons as shown in Figure 4.

    4.3 Edge layer setup

    The edge node acts as a computing center where incoming data are analyzed and
    fed as the input vector to

    the ML model for processing and to return the control signals for activating or
    deactivating the actuators

    placed at the farm. Edge node processes the physical data (real time) at every
    end device such as the

    collected and processed data via the Raspberry Pi nodes presented in the proposed
    scheme. The prediction

    model is designed using TensorFlow API and trained, tested on Google Colab in
    this work. Amazon Web

    Service (AWS) oﬀers a library named Boto3 having many APIs to upload and download
    objects. After the

    development of model, it is transferred to Amazon S3, a service provided by AWS.
    The edge node utilizes the

    trained model from S3 for analyzing the sensed data acquired from garden’s sensors.
    The decision is

    delivered based on real time data analysis at the edge node and transmitted to
    Arduino nodes in the ﬁelds

    landscape immediately for controlling the actuators. In another ﬂow, the data
    collected from sensors are

    ﬁltered so as to keep only the modiﬁed data at the edge node before being sent
    back for mitigating the

    communication cost to the database in the cloud. These data are used in the updation
    of the ML model to

    enhance its eﬃciency.

    4.4 Analytics setup

    The main goal of this experiment lies in gathering the various physical parameters
    of a farming land via

    sensors and utilizing the fetched data along with weather forecast information
    for developing an algorithm

    using hybrid machine learning approach to infuse higher accuracy in predicting
    the soil moisture for the

    upcoming days. As discussed in Section 4, for the proper planning and provisioning
    of optimal irrigation,

    the algorithm provides a predictable estimate of soil moisture with the assistance
    of various statistical

    measures as shown in Table 1. The measures are adopted for estimating the appropriateness
    and error rate

    of the proposed algorithm. It is inferred from the experiment that, optimal irrigation
    is feasible using a good

    642

    

    S. Premkumar and AN. Sigappi

    estimation (close to the actual value) of the soil moisture (Table 2), with the
    support of ﬁeld data and

    forecast information, thereby utilizing the natural rain eﬃciently.

    The SMPHA ML model is interdependent on dynamic changes in weather environment
    where the

    models deployed on edge nodes need to change the controls accordingly after model
    gets trained con-

    tinuously. For the process of retraining, the trained model needs to be updated.
    The parameters such as TM,

    HU, ST, UV, SM about grown plants are logged for the training purpose, and these
    generated datasets are

    recorded from the already developed manual mode system [39]. The growth of the
    Indian Mundu Chilli [40]

    is taken for the observation from the ﬁrst stage to the last grown stage for 95
    days. While retraining the

    model, the training is carried in cloud without causing eﬀect to the functionalities
    at edge nodes. A signal is

    transferred to the corresponding edge server for triggering the task of updating
    the SMPHA model from the

    web server. At that time, the newly trained model is downloaded to replace the
    existing one at the con-

    sidering edge server. From then, the ML model at the edge server is called to
    be updated with the real-world

    knowledge and is ready for its garden controlling tasks (to apply in the next
    farming season).

    4.5 Work ﬂow

    The ﬂowchart in Figure 6 depicts the working of the proposed system based on the
    decision support system

    that is beneﬁcial for irrigation needed for the growth of vegetables. The chilli
    plant is grown in a growbag

    attached with sensors and Pi as shown in Figure 3 and monitored for 95 days of
    data collection. To bring out

    optimality in the irrigation system, features relating to climate, soil, crop,
    and ﬁeld infrastructure are to be

    considered. To provide several recommendations in the production of vegetables,
    decision support systems

    (DSSs) are designed, which process voluminous information [39]. This proposed
    work is the extension of

    soil moisture diﬀerences (SMD) model [41] developed for soil moisture prediction.
    The threshold values of

    soil moisture are used in the SMD model where the system schedules the irrigation
    date based on the

    predicted soil moisture and weather forecast (precipitation) information automatically
    using SVR+ k-means

    modeling. Therefore, in the extension of the aforementioned work, further more
    number of sensors are used

    to log soil moisture value, which is averaged in the proposed model. This model
    is developed in two

    divisions of ﬂowchart as shown in Figure 7, where both are interconnected. It
    is observed that the prediction

    of XB + k-mean approach provides better results as presented in Table 2.

    The ﬁrst phase of the ﬂowchart describes the hybrid algorithm for the soil moisture
    prediction (SMPHA)

    using the combination of XB + k-means algorithm. During the data collection step,
    the sensor data for the

    parameters, namely, TM, HU, ST, UV, and SM, are collected. During preprocessing,
    null values and outliers

    are removed and the preprocessed data are used to train the XG-Boost model. The
    developed model is then

    trained with variables of live weather features (TM, HU, UV, PC) obtained from
    Weather API for the

    prediction of SM data. These data are given as input to k-means clustering algorithm
    to predict the soil

    moisture, which is deﬁned as SMPHA value to be infused in the next phase of the
    ﬂowchart. The second

    phase of the ﬂowchart deﬁnes the automatic irrigation planning setup. The setup
    starts obtaining the soil

    moisture maximum (SMMax) and soil moisture minimum (SMMin) values in the dashboard
    for setting the

    maximum and minimum level of soil moisture. Then, the current soil moisture (CuSM)
    is sensed and

    compared against the threshold SMMin. If the resulting value is less than SMMin,
    the process proceeds

    with SMPHA. On the contrary, it stops the irrigation process by sending 0 to the
    relay. In SMPHA, the

    nearest precipitation date is selected and it is assigned to the predicted soil
    moisture (PSM). The SMMax is

    decided by ﬁnding the minimum of (PSM + SMMin, SMMax), and the predicted SMMax
    is further checked

    against CuSM with a condition if SMMax is greater the CuSM then it sends 1 to
    the relay as a signal to start

    irrigation. If the condition fails, then it sends 0 to stop irrigation. The process
    of automatic irrigation ends

    by forecasting the irrigation schedule in accordance with the live weather parameters.

    5 Experimental setup and evaluation

    The test bed is developed and deployed, and the data are collected for the analysis
    in irrigation manage-

    ment. Here, Heroku cloud platform is used to deploy the cloud web server. The
    same cloud is also installed

    at a local edge that is at two Raspberry Pi units equipped with Wi-Fi 802.11n
    connections to denote the edge

    nodes. JMeter application is used to get sequential accesses to the web page from
    various users for eval-

    uating the network parameters. The speciﬁcation of these servers is given in Tables
    3 and 4.

    We evaluated the performance of the proposed IoT-based smart farm on two diﬀerent
    platforms,

    namely, in the cloud and on the local computer to show the feasibility and the
    beneﬁt of the edge com-

    puting scheme. Further many parameters are considered for evaluation and discussed
    in the next section to

    show that edge deployment is better than cloud.

    5.1 Evaluation

    A hybrid machine learning methodology is used in evaluating the ﬁrst stage of
    the proposed model. The

    predicted value of the soil moisture is better in terms of their accuracy and
    error rate. From the comparison

    of the other ML algorithms as shown in Table 2, XB + k-means performs better and
    taken further to be

    deployed in edge and cloud to check its eﬃciency with each other. Therefore, for
    analyzing the eﬃciency of

    the edge server in accordance with the proposed hybrid algorithm SMPHA is evaluated
    in terms of the time

    taken to train the ML model in edge and cloud. In this experiment Raspberry Pi
    is used to train the SMPHA

    model with 196,400 rows, that is, input data sample size and takes around 1,710,000
    ms (approximately

    28.5 min). The same model when it is trained in Google Colab cloud environment,
    it takes 204,000 ms

    (approximately 3.4 min) as depicted in Table 5. The main purpose is to run the
    trained model on edge not to

    train the model at edge. So due to the lack of computing capability at the edge,
    it takes more time to train

    the model, but it can be ignored as it does not aﬀect the purpose of the proposed
    model. Here, edge is

    introduced to obtain the task of computing from the cloud (i.e., oﬄoading the
    task) by making the system

    more edge-oriented deployment. It can be accomplished rapidly as it requires only
    14 s to download a

    trained SMPHA model from the cloud to the edge node with a size of 3,101 kb as
    given in Table 5. The time to

    download varies according to the size of the trained model. So, from this process
    it can be inferred that

    downloading the trained model saves time when compared to training the model at
    the edge. Through this

    in real time, deployment of the trained SMPHA model in edge is better compared
    to deployment in cloud

    services. Furthermore, network parameters like latency, throughput, bandwidth,
    and response time are

    adopted to measure the performance improvements in edge computing.

    The performance metrices taken into account are latency, bandwidth, and response
    time [42]. The

    latency of an application is the product of two factors: computing latency and
    transmission latency. The

    time spent on data processing and transmission between end devices to cloud servers
    is termed as com-

    puting latency and transmission latency, respectively. The computational capacity
    of the system decides

    the computing latency as the network servers possess a considerable amount of
    capacity to make the data

    processing faster, whereas the sensors come with limited computing capacity. The
    latency in transmission

    is increased by the end devices and cloud servers. Bandwidth: As large number
    of sensors are deployed in

    IoT, data generated would be huge that consumes an intense range of bandwidth
    and leads to several

    problems such as delay in transmission and loss of packets. It becomes unacceptable
    for the data to be

    transferred directly to cloud servers without applying compression. Therefore,
    data preprocessing and

    aggregation are needed for IoT gateways before redirecting them to remote cloud
    servers. Then, the issue

    to be confronted is to control the traﬃc ﬂow by migrating data processing and
    aggregation tasks optimally

    to decrease the bandwidth needs of the end users while maintaining the data quality.
    Response time: The

    total response time is calculated by adding up transmission and processing time.
    The local deployment of

    the proposed model for controlling IoT-based irrigation are deployed on two modes:
    (i) Cloud mode: The

    developed SMPHA model is implemented in the cloud communicating with IoT sensors
    nodes directly to

    manage the irrigation process. The data are stored and processed at the cloud
    server itself where it uses

    Heroku platform. (ii) Edge mode – Raspberry Pi is deployed as an edge server that
    involves in processing of

    the SMPHA model controlling the IoT sensor nodes. Here, the data are stored and
    processed locally within

    the edge servers. This SMPHA model from both the edge and cloud does the job of
    controlling the actuators

    to initiate and quit the working of water ﬂow motors. Through this deployment
    in both the environments,

    performance of edge server and cloud server can be checked in terms of latency,
    throughput, bandwidth,

    and response time is shown in aforementioned graphs in Figures 6, 8, and 9. This
    performance metrices is

    not feasible to calculate while deploying in real time, so the aforementioned
    scenarios of two modes are

    virtually created by generating many request and response threads between the
    servers. This sampling,

    load test, and distributed testing are conducted through JMeter application [43]
    and also veriﬁed with

    Wireshark [44] in cloud servers. The test scenario is created here by data of
    sending and receiving sampling

    data between cloud to IoT sensors and between Edge to IoT sensors. The sampling
    data considered in this

    work refer to the approximate number of requests generated by Arduino to cloud
    and Arduino to Raspberry

    Pi that are calculated in real time. The test scenario is divided into 10 days
    of sampling data collected for

    each day. The evaluation results are depicted for latency and response times in
    10 days perspective. In

    latency parameter, edge service has decreased by an average of 77.85% time compared
    to the with cloud. In

    the same manner, the response time of edge service is also decreased by 74.09%
    time compared to cloud

    service. In throughput calculation, sampling data are calculated for an hourly
    basis for the 10 hours data in

    a day. From the hourly comparisons of throughput value, edge outperforms with
    67.17% high Mbps usage.

    Through this analysis as shown in Table 6, it is evident that the proposed edge
    computing methodology

    deployed in Raspberry Pi or in local computers outperforms the cloud-oriented
    approach.

    Finally, to illustrate the eﬃciency of resource management in edge computing,
    CPU and memory

    utilization are considered for the analysis as both factors rely on the service
    execution model and the

    computational needs of the services being ﬁred from oﬀ-loaders. Figure 10 depicts
    the utilization of CPU

    and RAM on the Raspberry Pi acting as an edge node in two cases: with and without
    the deployment of

    SMPHA model on it. As shown in Figure 10, the SMPHA model aﬀects the CPU of the
    Raspberry Pi node

    signiﬁcantly as it consumed around 41.2% of the CPU compared to only 3.5% when
    it does not host the

    SMPHA model. However, the memory (RAM) utilization in both the cases (with and
    without deployment of

    an SMPHA model) is nearly the same which is around 31%. Comparatively RAM utilization
    does not have

    much diﬀerence in with and without SMPHA. It is worthwhile to note that, the CPU
    utilization is still much

    lower than the 50% of total CPU capacity in Raspberry Pi. Therefore, it becomes
    feasible for adopting edge

    server implementation in the proposed irrigation system.

    6 Conclusion

    This article proposed a novel approach to edge-based irrigation system to facilitate
    decision-making on

    watering the plants on scheduled time. The proposed approach applying IoT with
    an edge computing

    framework enables the farming system to adapt to the changes in environmental
    conditions automatically

    and eﬃciently. The process of automatic irrigation regulates irrigation according
    to the live weather para-

    meters for forecasting the irrigation process. Soil moisture prediction was performed
    using major regression

    algorithms that are again combined with k-means clustering for estimating the
    changes incurred in soil

    moisture prediction. These techniques were compared through metrics such as MAPE,
    MSE, speed, and

    power consumption from which XB + k-means was found to perform better. The XB
    + k-means algorithm

    was further used for the implementation of decision mechanism on the developed
    edge computing model.

    The proposed edge model saves the data communication cost and reduces the response
    time of IoT services.

    It can be deployed on existing devices on the network edges serving as edge nodes,
    thereby reducing the

    overall implementation cost of a large-scale IoT system. The edge-based approach
    was found to perform

    better than the cloud-based approach in terms of response time, latency, throughput,
    and bandwidth

    usage. Finally, the edge model was analyzed through CPU and memory usage while
    running with and

    without the algorithm. In both cases, the memory utilization is almost lower to
    total available resource of

    the edge device. From this, edge device can allocate its remaining resource for
    other computing services,

    which increases the eﬃciency of edge computing device. The number of end edge
    nodes can be increased

    according to the ﬁeld area and then to check the potency of the system.

    \ \n \nAbstract— Designing an efficient irrigation system is a crucial issue in\
    \ \nagriculture, due to water scarcity problem around the world with the need\
    \ of \nincreasing agricultural production to satisfy the demands of the enlargement\
    \ of \npopulation. Therefore, to design a smart irrigation system, a real monitoring\
    \ of \nfield’s information that affects the watering status is required which\
    \ can be \nachieved with Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). In this paper, an irrigation\
    \ \nsystem based WSN is proposed to save water, power, labor, and as a result,\
    \ \nsaving cost with production and profit increase. Sensor nodes collect field\
    \ data \nto be sent to the Raspberry pi, as a main controller, to make optimal\
    \ decisions \nabout irrigation process. The field data includes the sensor readings\
    \ of \ntemperature and soil moisture. Crop evapotranspiration is also considered;\
    \ \nthus, the required amount of water is estimated with a particular irrigation\
    \ time \nto avoid over irrigation that hurts the plants growth and yields quality.\
    \ The \nobtained results show the efficiency of the proposed system operation\
    \ and \ncontrolling on the irrigation process. These results are taken for tomato\
    \ plant \nas a case study. The monitoring tools are used to verify the suggested\
    \ algorithm \neffectiveness in irrigation scheduling. \nIndex Terms— Evapotranspiration,\
    \ Irrigation systems, Raspberry pi, WSN. \n \nI. INTRODUCTION \n       Irrigation\
    \ in agriculture consumes about 85% of the total consumed water in the world and\
    \ this \nwill increase rapidly with the increase of population [1]. Therefore,\
    \ developing an optimal irrigation \nsystem is necessary to reduce cost, power\
    \ and water consumption depending on real physical \ninformation instead of predicted\
    \ one [2]. Nowadays, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) have a \nsignificant role\
    \ in many application, such as environmental monitoring, medical, agricultural\
    \ and others \ndue to its flexibility and ability of processing data in different\
    \ environments with an easy programming \n[3]-[4]. In agriculture, natural resources\
    \ can be utilized in an efficient way using WSNs to gather real-\ntime information\
    \ on soil, weather, and plant growth. Therefore, farmers use this data to make\
    \ smart \ndecisions regarding to planting to get better yields and increase profits\
    \ [5].  \nMany studies proposed smart irrigation systems based on WSNs with limited\
    \ sensors’ readings \n(soil moisture, air temperature and humidity sensors only),\
    \ without referring to other climatic conditions \nsuch as wind speed, sun radiation.\
    \ In addition, most of these researches used simulation models to verify \nthe\
    \ suggested system’s operation. In [6], an  Internet of Things (IoT) based Smart\
    \ AgroTech system \nwas proposed to improve farm production using efficient monitoring\
    \ and scheduling irrigation process \nusing WSNs with ESP8226 controller. The\
    \ collected data from sensors (soil moisture, temperature, and \nhumidity) compared\
    \ with real data using comparative analysis and results showed an acceptable error\
    \ \non the charge of lacking in coverage area. While in [7], authors developed\
    \ a smart drip irrigation system \n \n73 \nReceived 30/July/2021; Accepted 7/November/2021\

    \ \n \ndepending on real-time soil moisture data in a greenhouse tomato’s crop.\
    \ A comparative study between \nthe proposed system and other irrigation systems\
    \ was done with results approved that the giving system \nis efficient to deal\
    \ with food security and water scarcity issues. In [8], a smart agriculture system\
    \ was \ndeveloped with an open source and not expensive hardware components like\
    \ built a WSN using Arduino \nand Raspberry Pi to get a cost-effective system.\
    \ The fuzzy logic control was used as a decision method \nfor the amount and duration\
    \ of irrigation. An automated irrigation system based on IOT was presented \n\
    in [9], this was done by distributing different sensors in the farm (soil moisture,\
    \ temperature and \nhumidity) and the reads are entered to a machine learning\
    \ algorithm. Authors in [10] proposed an \nautomated drip irrigation system using\
    \ real-time fuzzy inference method and WSN implemented in \nLaboratory Virtual\
    \ Instrument Workbench platform (LABVIEW). In [11], a monitoring and control \n\
    irrigation system was proposed based on multi agent system and artificial intelligence.\
    \ The WSN \ngathered data from environment to evaluate the actual need of water\
    \ every five minutes and weather \nmap used to calculate the potential evapotranspiration\
    \ precisely. Moreover, authors in [12] presented \nan automated drip irrigation\
    \ with fertigation system based on WSN. It utilized soil moisture data and \n\
    evapotranspiration for prediction of required water to irrigate the area. This\
    \ system proposed also a \ntransmission method between cluster head and a base\
    \ station based on Travelling Salesman Protocol \n(TSP) to reduce power consumption\
    \ in data transmission. The results approved that the proposed system \nused water\
    \ efficiently. In [13], a developed real-time agriculture application was presented\
    \ using multi-\nlayered architecture containing three technologies (Internet of\
    \ Things, cloud computing and context \nawareness).  \nAt the other hand, authors\
    \ in the smart drip irrigation system proposed in [14] used smartphone to \ncapture\
    \ soil image. Calculations were made on the image to know the level of wetness\
    \ and send the data \nto a microcontroller to take an irrigation decision depending\
    \ on the captured image in smartphone and \nsensors output. Authors of [15] proposed\
    \ a control system to control environmental parameters that \naffect the crop\
    \ production. Three parts included in the control system: hardware component,\
    \ web \napplication and mobile application. Authors of  [16] presented a Solar\
    \ Photovoltaic Watering System \n(SPVWS) with multithreading design and virtual\
    \ timers. Raspberry pi was used due to its efficient \nperformance with real time\
    \ applications. By multithreading programming used in the system, \ncontrolling\
    \ the system and HTTP server job working concurrently to give remote control of\
    \ the \nirrigation system and online monitoring of data. Authors in [17]  suggested\
    \ a smart farm management \nsystem based on WSN to schedule irrigation,  feed\
    \ animals, and manage farm production. For irrigation \nscheduling, an Arduino\
    \ UNO microcontroller controls soil moisture, temperature and humidity sensors\
    \ \nwhich were used to gather real-time data relating water status in soil and\
    \ air temperature and humidity. \nThe microcontroller sends the collected data\
    \ to control center via Bluetooth for processing and storing \nin data base. Control\
    \ information is sent from control center to the Arduino to manage irrigation\
    \ process.  \n The proposed system in [18] used IOT to automate controlling and\
    \ monitoring of irrigation \nprocess. Sensor devices collected environmental data\
    \ from the field and regression algorithm used this \ndata to determine water\
    \ requirements in a day. Authors of [19] proposed a watering system with future\
    \ \nprediction of soil moisture content using Neural Network. The expectation\
    \ strategy utilized the collected \ndata from sensors such as soil and weather\
    \ parameters. Authors of [1] proposed an automated irrigation \nsystem based on\
    \ WSN to gather data for irrigation process decision. A web application in smartphones\
    \ \nalso used to give notifications when the soil is dry or the level of the water\
    \ in the tank is low. The WSN \nconnected with the server using 4G-Long-Term Evolution\
    \ (LTE) technology due to its flexibility. In \naddition, authors in [20] presented\
    \ a simulation model to a smart irrigation system based on WSN. In \nthe proposed\
    \ model, WSN used cluster topology to ensure a scalable network and increase sensors\
    \ life \ntime. The proposed system used fuzzy inference system to irrigation control.\
    \ Simulation results showed \nthat the system performance is accurate with economical\
    \ use of water and power.  \n \n74 \nReceived 30/July/2021; Accepted 7/November/2021\

    \ \n \nIn this paper, a smart on-demand irrigation system is proposed based on\
    \ WSN. Two sensor nodes \nare used to detect watering status, and send real-time\
    \ data to raspberry pi for optimizing the right \ndecision about starting or stopping\
    \ irrigation process. In addition, the Raspberry pi determines the \nrequired\
    \ amount of water depending on climatic conditions and crop data, and irrigation\
    \ run time is also \ncalculated to specify how long the particular plant should\
    \ irrigate. As a case study, the tomato plant data \nis chosen to verify the operation\

    \ with \nESP8266 microcontroller and used to collect data from the field. Soil\
    \ moisture sensor is used to detect \nthe witness of the soil, while temperature\
    \ sensor is used to detect air temperature. Sensor readings are \nsent from the\
    \ controller to Raspberry pi using WiFi connection and MQTT protocol to make decision\
    \ \nabout starting or stopping the irrigation process. Raspberry pi sends control\
    \ commands to ESP8266 \nmicrocontroller to switch on/off of water pump with the\
    \ aid of WiFi connection and MQTT protocol. \nIn addition, the amount of the water\
    \ and the time required to run the irrigation process is determined by \nRaspberry\
    \ pi using climatic data stored in a server data base to calculate reference evapotranspiration.\

    \ https://doi.org/10.33103/uot.ijccce.22.1.8 \n \nThe work flow of the proposed\
    \ algorithm can be explained in the following steps:  \n \n1. After powering up\
    \ the system, ESP8266 microcontroller sends sensors reading to Raspberry pi \n\
    with WiFi connection and MQTT protocol.  \n2. The Raspberry pi, as a base station\
    \ in the system, is responsible of making irrigation decision \nand scheduling\
    \ process. So, it receives sensors reading, sends it to server for monitoring\
    \ using \nNode-RED tool.  \n3. The Raspberry pi makes the necessary calculations\
    \ to estimate crop water requirements as well \nas irrigation run time using equations\
    \ (1) – (6), while the microcontroller continues reading \nsensors at the same\
    \ time.   \n4. The decision of starting irrigation or not depends on soil moisture\
    \ sensor reading. If the reading \nbelow a preferred threshold value for a particular\
    \ crop, then irrigation is started by sending \npower on command from Raspberry\
    \ pi to ESP8266 to power on water pump for a specific time \nwith a continuous\
    \ check of soil moisture value to avoid over irrigation that harms plant growth\
    \ \nand crop production. When sensor reading is above the determined threshold\
    \ value or irrigation \nrun time ends, Raspberry pi sends power off command to\
    \ ESP8266 to stop water pump and \nstarts the operation again. \n \n  In the implementation\
    \ of the proposed irrigation system as a prototype, different        \nhardware\
    \ components are utilized including:  \n \n \nLaptop \n \nRaspberry pi 4 Model\
    \ B [25] \n \nESP8266 microcontroller[26] \n \nFC-28 soil moisture sensor [27]\
    \ \n \nDS18B20 temperature sensor [28] \n \n Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) \n\

    TABLE III. TOMATO CROP WATER REQUIREMENTS  \n \nIn this paper, LEDs are used to\
    \ verify system’s operation. When Raspberry pi sends power on \ncommand to ESP8266\
    \ microcontroller, LEDs are turned ON, for a particular time equals to irrigation\
    \ \nrun time determined by Raspberry pi. On the other hand, they are turnned OFF,\
    \ with power off \ncommand.  \nFig. 6 shows system’s monitoring on server with\
    \ Node-RED dashboards. A temperature guage and \nchart are used in Fig. 6.a to\
    \ mointor temperature sensors reading, in addition to LED status, which is \n\
    turnned ON when air temperature exceeds 25 C (according to Raspberry pi commands)\
    \ and it is turnned \nOFF otherwise. Fig. 6.b-d show soil moisture monitoring\
    \ windows, soil moisture sensor reading range \nis between 0 and 1024 with 0 represent\
    \ 100% moisture and 1024 represent 0%. As mentioned earliar, \nthe preferred soil\
    \ moisture value for tomato crop is between 70-80%. After mapping the reading\
    \ of the \nproposed sensor, the results show that a 70% moisture is equal to 430.\
    \ Therefore in system design, when \na Raspberry pi receives a moisture sensor\
    \ reading above 430, a power ON command must be sent to \nESP8266 to turn ON the\
    \ specific water pump for starting irrigation process with a particular irrigation\
    \ \ntime. In the moisture monitoring window, a LED repersents a water pump status,\
    \ it is turnned ON with \ntimer when irrigation is required and it is turnned\
    \ OFF otherwise. ESP8266 is programmed with C \nprogramming language and Arduino-IDE\
    \ open source softwate, while Raspberry pi is configured with \nPython programming\

    \ based WSNs was proposed to enhance crops production \nby maintaining an efficient\
    \ amount of water that is necessary to get a good quality crop. Sensors reading\
    \ \nas well as weather information are used as inputs to the system to make an\
    \ accurate irrigation decision. \nRaspberry pi is used as a base station that\
    \ receives these inputs from ESP8266 ccontroller for making \nwatering decisions,\
    \ and sends commands to nodes. WiFi technology and MQTT protocol were used to\
    \ \nexchange the data and control commands between nodes and Raspberry pi. Watering\
    \ decisions were \nnot only for starting or ending irrigation process, but also\
    \ the required amount of water was determined \naccording to crop evapotranspiration.\
    \ Moreover, irrigation run time was estimated depending on drip \nirrigation strategy\
    \ and its suggested tools. Tomato crop was chosen as a case study, due to its\
    \ importance \nin agricultural production around the world. Finally,  monitoring\
    \ of system operation approved the \neffeciency of the proposed system in making\
    \ appropriate irrigation decisions that lead to reduce water \nand power consumption\
    \ in irrigation process with imrovement in quality and quantity of yields. \n\

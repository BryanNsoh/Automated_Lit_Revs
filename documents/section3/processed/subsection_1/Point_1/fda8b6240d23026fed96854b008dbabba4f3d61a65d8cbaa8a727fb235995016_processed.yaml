  analysis: 'This paper presents a model for estimating the ‘support practice factor’
    (P-factor) at a European scale using earth observation data.


    The P-factor accounts for control practices that reduce runoff and soil erosion,
    yet it is rarely accounted for in soil erosion risk modelling at a sub-continental
    scale due to difficulty in estimation for large areas. This study addresses this
    gap by considering contour farming, stone walls, and grass margins as key support
    practices.


    The findings show that stone walls have the biggest impact on reducing erosion
    (38%), followed by contour farming (3%), and grass margins (57%).


    The authors stress the importance of maintaining and expanding these support practices,
    especially in erosion-prone areas, and they propose specific policy scenarios
    to achieve this.


    They also highlight the value of their P-factor model as a tool for policymakers
    to simulate soil erosion risk scenarios and identify areas where support practices
    can be most effectively implemented.


    Overall, this study provides a valuable tool and insights for improving soil conservation
    efforts at a continental scale.'

    contour farming, stone walls and grass margins. • P-factor is estimated to be
    0.97 in European Union and 0.95 in arable lands. • Highest impact of support practices
    found in Mediterranean, Belgium, The Netherlands and UK. • The P-factor model
    is a useful tool for policy makers to simulate scenarios. • A scenario of contour
    farming in slopes steeper than 5% will result in P-factor = 0.949. Abstract The
    USLE/RUSLE support practice factor (P-factor) is rarely taken into account in
    soil erosion risk modelling at sub-continental scale, as it is difficult to estimate
    for large areas. This study attempts to model the P-factor in the European Union.
    For this, it considers the latest policy developments in the Common Agricultural
    Policy, and applies the rules set by Member States for contour farming over a
    certain slope. The impact of stone walls and grass margins is also modelled using
    the more than 226,000 observations from the Land use/cover area frame statistical
    survey (LUCAS) carried out in 2012 in the European Union. The mean P-factor considering
    contour farming, stone walls and grass margins in the European Union is estimated
    at 0.9702. The support practices accounted for in the P-factor reduce the risk
    of soil erosion by 3%, with grass margins having the largest impact (57% of the
    total erosion risk reduction) followed by stone walls (38%). Contour farming contributes
    very little to the P-factor given its limited application; it is only used as
    a support practice in eight countries and only on very steep slopes. Support practices
    have the highest impact in Malta, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece, Belgium, The
    Netherlands and United Kingdom where they reduce soil erosion risk by at least
    5%. The P-factor modelling tool can potentially be used by policy makers to run
    soil-erosion risk scenarios for a wider application of contour farming in areas
    with slope gradients less than 10%, maintaining stone walls and increasing the
    number of grass margins under the forthcoming reform of the Common Agricultural
    Policy. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords RUSLEGAECStone
    wallsGrass marginsLUCASContour farming 1. Introduction The Common Agricultural
    Policy (CAP) is the main EU policy through which farmers are receiving incentives
    in the European Union (EU). In order to get those incentives, farmers must comply
    with “best practice” landuse management practices (named cross-compliance). The
    main component of cross-compliance is the farmer''s obligation to keep his land
    under Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC, 2009). This regulation
    requests the farmers to prevent soil erosion, conserve soil organic carbon and
    maintain soil structure. An option to assess the effect of GAEC on soil erosion
    reduction is based on the use of soil erosion risk models. At national scale,
    models based on the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) are most commonly applied
    (Panagos et al., 2014a). Of the six RUSLE/USLE input factors (Renard et al., 1997),
    values for the support practice P-factor are considered as the most uncertain
    (Haan et al., 1994, Morgan and Nearing, 2011). The P-factor accounts for control
    practices that reduce the erosion potential of runoff by their influence on drainage
    patterns, runoff concentration, runoff velocity and hydraulic forces exerted by
    the runoff on the soil surface (Renard et al., 1991). It is an expression of the
    overall effects of supporting conservation practices – such as contour farming,
    strip cropping, terracing, and subsurface drainage – on soil loss at a particular
    site, as those practices principally affect water erosion by modifying the flow
    pattern, grade, or direction of surface runoff and by reducing the volume and
    rate of runoff (Renard et al., 1997). The value of P-factor decreases by adopting
    these supporting conservation practices as they reduce runoff volume and velocity
    and encourage the deposition of sediment on the hill slope surface. The lower
    the P-factor value, the better the practice is for controlling soil erosion. Human
    influence on soil erosion control is important to include in soil erosion risk
    assessment, but there is no global reference because erosion control is a very
    local activity (Yang et al., 2003). P-values can be derived either from image
    classifications using remote sensing data or from previous studies or even from
    expert knowledge. Karydas et al. (2009) have mapped landscape objects (terraces,
    roads, physical obstacles) with object-oriented image analysis (OAA) and assigned
    P-values by expert knowledge in the Kolymbari catchment study in Crete. Another
    approach is to use IMAGE 2006 and Sobel filters for identifying physical obstacles
    (Panagos et al., 2014b) that can reduce runoff and soil erosion. The image classifications
    approach requests very high resolution remote sensing datasets and some experimental
    results which are currently not available. The literature reports various tables
    and formulas proposing P-factor values for the different supporting conservation
    practices adopted to different environmental contexts (e.g. Wischmeier and Smith,
    1978, Renard et al., 1997, Foster et al., 2002). Typical values range from about
    0.2 for reverse-slope bench terraces, to 1.0 where there are no erosion control
    practices (Wischmeier and Smith, 1978). The effectiveness of the support conservation
    measures is obtained from plot studies and often applied at small catchments.
    However, since it is difficult to quantify the impact of different support practices
    applied in very large areas (e.g. Europe), only a first estimate of the P-factor
    can be calculated at European scale. An alternative approach for an approximation
    of the P-factor is based on empirical equations. For instance, the Wener''s method
    assumes that the P-factor is linked to topographical features. This method is
    commonly employed to determine P-factor values using as input the slope gradient
    (%) (Lufafa et al., 2003, Fu et al., 2005, Terranova et al., 2009). Our study
    does not use such equations as slope gradient is already incorporated in the topographic
    LS factor. The main objective of this study is to estimate the support practice
    factor (P-factor) based on earth observation datasets at European scale (EU-28)
    following the literature guidelines and taking into account the current agro-environmental
    policies that are implemented in the individual member states. The proposed P-factor
    model for Europe takes into consideration contour farming, stone walls and grass
    margins. Management practices such as reduced tillage, cover crops and plant residues
    are incorporated in the land cover and management practice factor (C-factor of
    the RUSLE). More specifically, this study aims to: 1) Estimate the P-factor values
    for arable lands in Europe based on the Common Agricultural Policy implementation.
    2) Assess the impact of conservation practices such as stone walls and grass margins
    in reducing soil loss at European scale. 3) Discuss the implications of policy
    scenarios that may affect those support practices. 2. Policy context and materials
    2.1. Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC) measures applied in
    the EU Member States Member States have the flexibility to define the contents
    of GAEC requirements taking into account the local conditions (Angileri et al.,
    2011). Regarding protection of soils against soil erosion, GAEC has introduced
    among others the prevention of erosive farming practices (ploughing and planting
    up and down the slope) in hilly areas and the maintenance of landscape features
    such as stone walls (and terraces) and buffer strips. Some Member States have
    set the requirement for contour ploughing (and ban up- and downslope cultivation)
    for areas exceeding a certain slope gradient (Table 1). Table 1. GAEC application
    (mainly on contour farming) in Member States. Member state Farming practice Slope

    direction of the maximum slope No overturn of soil in the direction of the maximum
    slope >10 >15 Herbaceous crops Vineyards, olive groves and nut crops The maintenance
    of dry stone walls is among the GAEC standards that Member States have adopted.
    Stone walls are considered effective for reducing slope length and as a consequence
    soil erosion (Bazzoffi, 2009). Moreover, according to GAEC standards, small landscape
    elements such as hedges or buffer strips should not be removed as they protect
    habitats and reduce runoff volumes. 2.2. Land use/cover area frame statistical
    survey (LUCAS) The study uses the Land use/cover area frame statistical survey
    named LUCAS (LUCAS, 2012) which includes ground observations both on land use/cover
    and landscape features for over 270,000 observation points visited by surveyors
    in 2012. The survey has been made in the 27 member states (EU-27) of the European
    Union covering an area of ca. 4.3 million km2 with an average density of 1 observed
    point every 16 km2. Surveyors recorded data on land use/cover plus additional
    information such as slope gradient, presence of grazing, height of trees and irrigation
    management. The surveyor also collects multi-directional photographs and walks
    eastwards along a transect of 250 m recording the sequence of land-cover types
    and linear landscape features. Among the total number of observations, 226,653
    records (83.9%) are considered valid for this study because the rest were not
    completed by a surveyor (Van Der Zanden et al., 2013). Invalid points were well
    distributed all over Europe. The data is geo-referenced and is available in the
    LUCAS database (LUCAS, 2012). Among the landscape features recorded by a surveyor
    (LUCAS, 2013), we focused in this study on stone walls and grass margins (Fig.
    1). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Examples of dry stone walls (photos
    above) and grass margins (photos below) reported in LUCAS survey. 2.2.1. Stone
    walls Dry stone walls are widespread landscape features in the Mediterranean and
    especially in the islands (Malta, Sicily, Cyprus, Isle Balearides, Aegean Islands).
    These stone walls were primarily used to delimit parcels being bequeathed by farmers
    to their children and to clean the land from stones. This also includes stone
    heaps which were collected by the farmer on the field (Fig. 1a) even though not
    in a linear form. Stone walls prevent soil erosion; especially in hilly areas.
    Their predominance in Southern Europe is also linked to the availability of stones
    in soil (Poesen et al., 1994, Panagos et al., 2014c). Stone walls should be at
    least 20 m long in order to be recorded by a LUCAS surveyor. According to the
    LUCAS observations, stone walls have been recorded in 11,141 (4.9%) transects.
    The largest number of stone walls has been observed in Spain, France, Italy and
    Portugal (Table 2). In all Mediterranean countries (IT, ES, PT, GR, CY, MT) as
    well as in Ireland and United Kingdom the density of stone walls (number of stone
    walls divided by total number of observations) exceeds 8% (Table 2). The highest
    density is noticed in Malta (72.5%) followed by Portugal (22.6%), Ireland and
    Spain. Table 2. Presence of stone walls and grass margins in EU Member States

    observations for stone walls were compared with the data from the Farm Structure
    Survey (FSS) which was also performed by Eurostat in 2010 (FSS, 2010). According
    to FSS, 727,830 out of 12,248,040 agricultural holdings (5.9%) have reported stone
    walls in EU-28. The FSS data could not be used in this study as they are not geo-referenced.
    The FSS data set report the same trends for stone walls in Mediterranean countries
    (PT, ES, CY, MT, GR, IT) as the LUCAS survey. 2.2.2. Grass margins In the LUCAS
    survey, grass margins are defined as strips of mainly uncultivated land with vegetation
    dominated by grasses or herbs. Grass margins are recorded in the LUCAS database
    when their width is between 1 and 3 m and the length exceeds 20 m (LUCAS, 2013).
    Grass margins are mainly located at the edge of the fields, between cropped areas
    (beetle banks) (Fig. 1b) or bordering roads and tracks (roadside verge). The grass
    margins can be spontaneous or planted and they are managed by farmers. According
    to the LUCAS observations, grass margins have been reported for 61,224 (27%) transects
    (Table 2). Large countries (FR, DE, ES, IT, PL) had the higher absolute numbers
    of grass margins. The highest density of grass margins compared to the total number
    of observations is found in Belgium (45.5%), Netherlands (38.8%), France (37.8%),
    Luxembourg (36.8%) and the United Kingdom (35.1%). For both, stone walls and grass
    margins, the surveyors have also recorded their density inside the 250 m transect.
    The vast majority of the observed transects where those features are present,
    has 1 feature per transect (Table 4). Table 4. Density of stone walls and grass

    CORINE Land Cover The CORINE Land Cover datasets (CLC, 2014) contain homogeneous
    data on land cover areas provided as polygons. The datasets are outputs of harmonised
    procedures based on a common classification system, and can therefore be easily
    compared. Land cover is classified in 44 classes, which are grouped into three
    hierarchical levels. The used CLC data are in raster format at pixel size of 100
    m and refer to the year 2006. The CLC data are used for stratification of support
    practices. 3. Methods At European level, the effect of support practices (compulsory
    for farmers to receive incentives under the CAP-GAEC) on soil loss were assessed
    by P-factor estimation taking into account: (a) contour farming, (b) maintenance
    of stone walls, and (c) grass margins. P-factor was proposed as a product of those
    3 sub-factors by Blanco and Lal (2008); applied by Lopez-Vicente and Navas (2009):
    (1) where Pc is the contouring sub-factor for a given slope of a field, and Psw
    is the stone walls sedimentation sub-factor (known as terrace sub-factor) and
    Pgm is grass margins sub-factor (known as strip cropping sub-factor and buffer
    strips). In the same context, Angima et al. (2003) computed the P-factor as a
    product of individual support practices (contour farming, terracing and strips)
    that are used in combination to reduce soil erosion in Kenya. 3.1. Contour farming
    sub-factor Contouring is a specific support practice applied only in croplands
    (CORINE land cover classes 21×) which account for around 25.2% of the total European
    Union land area. Contour farming means that farmers apply certain field practices
    (ploughing, planting) along contours, perpendicular to the normal flow direction
    of runoff. Contour cultivation reduces runoff velocity by increasing up- and downslope
    surface roughness. The increased surface roughness reduces water velocity providing
    more time for infiltration (Stevens et al., 2009). The effectiveness of contour
    farming in reducing soil erosion depends on the slope gradient (Table 3). Table
    3. P-factor for contour support practice for different slope gradient. Slope (%)
    Support practice factor for contouring, Pc 9–12 0.6 13–16 0.7 17–20 0.8 21–25
    0.9 >25 0.95 In the Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions (GAEC), each
    country has the flexibility to decide the compulsory requirements for farmers
    to apply contour farming. Among the EU Member States, only 10 have applied contour
    farming. It was not possible to estimate the contour faming sub-factor in Belgium
    (Flanders) and Denmark as it was not specified in their GAEC. Using the Digital
    elevation model at 25 m resolution, the arable lands of 8 countries (Table 1)
    have been attributed a P-factor based on their topographic feature (slope %) and
    the P-factors proposed by Morgan (2005) in Table 3: 3.2. Stone walls sub-factor
    Stone walls are mainly built on hilly land and reduce the velocity of overland
    flow and as a consequence reduce soil erosion rates (Morgan, 1995). Slope length
    is reduced due to the presence of stone walls. In the longer term, the hillslope
    gradient may even be reduced due to progressive terrace formation (Nyssen et al.,
    2007). Finally, stone walls trap sediments within the borders of the field parcels.
    Stone walls, even if they are partly degraded, continue to provide protection
    against soil erosion (Bazzoffi and Gardin, 2011). For 14 plots (representing 21
    plot-year data) in Europe and the Mediterranean, Maetens et al. (2012) calculated
    that stone wall terraces reduced soil loss to 0.75 (mean) and 0.35 (median) of
    the soil loss values for control plots (i.e. without terraces). Regarding the
    efficiency of stone walls, field experiments at a plot scale in Ethiopia showed
    that dry stone walls led to a 68% reduction of soil erosion (Gebremichael et al.,
    2005). In the Tigray highlands of Ethiopia, Munro et al. (2008) proposed P-factor
    values depending on the quality of stone walls (remains: 0.8, poor: 0.6, moderate:
    0.4, good: 0.2). These values can also be interpolated and applied in non-arable
    lands. In Kenya, Angima et al. (2003) has calculated the P-factor value between
    0.5 and 0.7 depending on the gradient and the density of stone walls. Mediterranean
    traditional dry stone walls (in Greece) do not protect the soil surface from water
    erosion completely, because of the existing slope gradient between successive
    terraces (Koulouri and Giourga, 2007). In Mediterranean countries stone walls
    are also built around olive trees (Previati et al., 2010). A simple model estimates
    soil loss with or without the presence of stone walls in various land use, rainfall
    erosivity, soil erodibility and topographic conditions (scenarios). This model
    assumes that stone walls reduce slope length; thus, the impact of stone walls
    on soil loss reduction can be predicted. We estimated the impact of stone walls
    in reducing soil loss for 4 different scenarios: a) Forest with high R-factor
    = 1500 MJ mm ha−1 h−1 yr−1, low K-factor = 0.02 ha h ha−1 MJ−1 mm−1 and slopes
    up to 45%. b) Arable land with medium R-factor = 750 MJ mm ha−1 h−1 yr−1, mean
    K-factor 0.03 ha h ha−1 MJ−1 mm−1 and slopes up to 3%. c) Grassland with R-factor
    = 1000 MJ mm ha−1 h−1 yr−1, low K-factor = 0.02 ha h ha−1 MJ−1 mm−1 and slopes
    up to 10%. d) Pastures with R-factor = 900 MJ mm ha−1 h−1 yr−1, low K-factor =
    0.02 ha h ha−1 MJ−1 mm−1 and slopes up to 5%. We ran 4 land use scenarios with
    different stone wall densities and also considered the overall impact of stone
    walls on soil losses measured at experimental sites (Gebremichael et al., 2005,
    Angima et al., 2003, Munro et al., 2008, Koulouri and Giourga, 2007, Maetens et
    al., 2012) in assigning Psw values (Table 4). Psw-factor values range between
    0.32 and 0.71 depending on stone walls density. The above-mentioned experimental
    studies showed the effectiveness of stone walls in all land use types. The analysis
    of stone walls per CORINE land cover class shows a relatively high number of those
    features in heterogeneous agricultural areas and scrub lands (Table 5). Thus,
    the impact of stone walls is taken into account for all CORINE land cover classes

    Haan et al. (1994) considered grass margins as one of the most effective measure
    for reducing sediment delivery. The grass margins obstruct runoff, induce infiltration,
    trap sediments and reduce sediment transport. The reduction of sediment yield
    when applying grass margins is relatively small (Verstraeten et al., 2002). Experimental
    results show that grass margins can trap between 10% and 30% of inflowing sediment
    (Dillaha et al., 1987, Haan et al., 1994). In USA, Dabney et al. (1999) estimated
    the P-factor to be 0.81 for hedge rows (1–2 m wide) of dense vegetation. Using
    GUSED (Griffith University Soil Erosion and Deposition) model, Hussein et al.
    (2007) estimated a reduction of soil loss between 5.9% and 11.6% (P-factor = 0.88–0.94)
    due to buffer strips in different slope conditions. In two different catchments
    (Gibuuri, Kianjuki) in Kenya where buffer strips have been applied, two studies
    (Angima et al., 2003, Hessel and Tenge, 2008) found Pgm sub-factor equal to 0.7.
    Nyssen (2001) estimated that grass strips can accumulate half of the sediment
    yield compared to stone walls. Taking into account the values of P-factor for
    grass margins reported in the literature (Dillaha et al., 1987, Haan et al., 1994,
    Dabney et al., 1999, Angima et al., 2003, Hessel and Tenge, 2008), we assumed
    that grass margins trap on average half of the sediments compared to those trapped
    by stone walls. Thus, depending on the density of grass margins, the Pgm-factor
    will vary from 0.66 to 0.85 (Table 4). Almost half of the observed grass margins
    are located in arable lands (Table 5). The impact of grass margins is estimated
    only for agricultural areas (arable – permanent), pastures and heterogeneous agricultural
    areas which in total account for 80% of the observation points having grass margins.
    3.4. Spatial interpolation of stone walls and grass margins The LUCAS ground observations
    have been performed at 270,000 points. The transect findings record the density
    of stone walls and grass margins. To assess the impact of those features to the
    whole European Union area, a spatial interpolation should be performed. In the
    environmental domain, spatial interpolations approaches range from simple interpolation
    such as Inverse Weighted Distance (IWD) to Ordinary Kriging (OK) and even more
    complex regression models. Since the objective of this study is to capture the
    density of stone walls and grass margins (spatial patterns) and by using the past
    experience in this field (Van Der Zanden et al., 2013), the ordinary Kriging method
    was selected for spatial interpolation. This technique assumes a spatial homogeneous
    surface with constant variance and constant mean. In this study, the ordinary
    Kriging was based on 25 observation points for the radius setting. More complex
    regression models are recommended for a spatial interpolation at regional scale.
    4. Results and discussion 4.1. P-factor assessment at European level The contour
    sub-factor (Pc) was estimated based on a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) at 25 m
    resolution. The mean Pc for the EU-28 was calculated to 0.9985 (0.9942 in arable
    lands) due to the limited number of countries applying contour farming in GAEC
    and due to the application of this support practice mostly to slopes over 10%.
    The largest effect of contour farming is estimated for Cyprus (0.990) followed
    by Spain and Greece and the lowest mean value is found in Slovenia due to the
    very limited application of contouring (only on slopes > 20%). The stone walls
    sub-factor (Psw) was estimated based on the interpolated stone walls dataset at
    1 km resolution. The mean Psw for the EU-28 was calculated to be 0.9884 and the
    largest effect of stone walls is noticed in Malta (Psw = 0.529) followed by Portugal
    and the rest of the Mediterranean countries (Table 6). The interpolated stone
    wall dataset has less uncertainty compared to the grass margins dataset. The Root
    Mean Square Error (RMSE) for the stone wall interpolation was 0.568 and 1.031
    for the grass margins which was in line with previous modelling efforts (Van Der
    Zanden et al., 2013). Table 6. Support practice (P-factor) and sub-factors per

    UK 1 0.9878 0.9647 0.9528 The grass margins sub-factor (Pgm) was estimated based
    on the interpolated grass margins dataset at 1 km resolution. The mean Pgm for
    the EU-28 was calculated to be 0.9829 with the highest effect in reducing soil
    loss in Belgium, Netherlands, United Kingdom and France (Table 6). This sub-factor
    is the most important (compared to contouring and stone walls) in support practices
    estimation for Europe due to the abundance of grass margins (observed in 27% of
    the LUCAS transects). The mean P-factor in the EU-28, combining the 3 sub-factors,
    is estimated to be 0.9702 (Fig. 2). Due to the high density and impact of stone
    walls, Malta has the lowest P-factor (0.525) followed by Portugal, Spain and Belgium
    which have P-factor values less than 0.95. The implementation of support practices
    is very limited in the Baltic States, Slovakia and Czech Republic with P-factor
    values close to 1.0. The support practices have greater influence in agricultural
    land use as they reduce soil erosion risk by 5% (Pagriculture = 0.95). Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Support practice factor (P-factor) in the European
    Union. The P-factor map at 1 km resolution (Fig. 2) spots the areas where support
    conservation practices are mostly applied. The importance of stone walls in reducing
    soil loss especially in sloping areas (e.g. Cinque Terre in Italy, Lesvos in Greece,
    Malta, Priorat/Catalonia in Spain, Douro in Portugal) (Stanchi et al., 2012) is
    highlighted in the P-factor map (Fig. 2). Support practices are extremely important
    in reducing soil loss in sloping and high erosive areas. Regarding land uses,
    permanent crops with a relatively small coverage of 2.4% in EU lands have a share
    of 9.2% in stone walls (Table 5). So, it is crucial to invest in stone walls in
    olives fields of Crete and vineyards in Spain (hilly and erosive areas) than in
    flat areas such as Po plain in Italy. The P-factor map can further be combined
    with the rainfall erosivity (R-factor) in Europe (Panagos et al., 2015a). The
    most erosive areas (75th percentile; R-factor > 900 MJ mm ha−1 h−1 yr−1) mainly
    located in the Mediterranean basin have mean P-factor equal to 0.9574. Contrary,
    in the less erosive areas (25th percentile; R-factor < 410 MJ mm ha−1 h−1 yr−1)
    the mean P-factor is 0.9845. The support practices are mainly focusing in erosive
    prone areas. At European scale and for policy makers, it is recommended to aggregate
    the data at regional level. NUTS2 (Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics)
    level represents regions of 0.8–3 million people at which regional policies are
    implemented and agricultural data are available. The aggregated P-factor map (Fig.
    3) at NUTS2 level classifies the regions according to the application of support
    practices. The highest concentration of support practices driven mainly by the
    density of stone walls is found in 3 island regions: Malta, Isle Balearides (ES)
    and Notio Aigaio (GR). Those are followed by Puglia (IT), Comunidad Valenciana
    (ES), Norte (PT) and Voreio Aigaio (GR) which all have P-factor values less than
    0.85 (Fig. 3). P-factor values in the range of 0.85–0.90 are found in regions
    from Mediterranean countries, United Kingdom, The Netherlands and Belgium. Download

    the European Union. The stone walls are usually found in hilly areas while the
    grass margins are observed in more gently sloping areas. The protective role of
    stone walls is higher compared to the grass margins as they can reduce soil erosion
    in erosion-prone hilly areas. Other protective practices such as subsurface drainage
    or fences were not taken into account due to either a limited number of observations
    at European scale or the lack of data on their effectiveness in reducing soil
    loss. The proposed methodology is repeatable as LUCAS survey is performed in Europe
    every 3 years. This creates an opportunity for future monitoring of changes in
    the P sub-factors for stone walls and grass margins. 4.2. Limitations of the results
    The contour sub-factor estimation is based on the assumption that farmers are
    following the GAEC guidelines which is true as they receive incentives and they
    are controlled by authorities. However, contour farming may also be applied in
    areas which have not been recorded in this study due to lack of observations.
    The presence of stone walls and grass margins in this model depends on the surveyed
    points selected in LUCAS. Due to financial constraints, the number of visited
    points is limited. The original findings in LUCAS earth observations are also
    influenced by the transect length. The interpolated datasets (stone walls, grass
    margins) are also dependent on the selected interpolation technique. The impact
    of grass margins is based on certain assumptions as those features have different
    physical forms (height, density and seasonal effect) from country to country.
    Moreover, the influence of the practices (stone walls, grass margins) depends
    much on the slope direction and slope gradient. To overcome these limitations,
    a conservative model approach has been followed as the impact of grass margins
    and stone walls has been estimated to a minimum level. 4.3. Policy making and
    options for maintenance of support practices The proposed P-factor estimation
    methodology is a useful tool for policy makers to simulate policy relevant scenarios.
    For instance, the scenario of applying contour farming in all European arable
    lands (EU-28) having slopes steeper than 10% will result in a reduction of the
    contour sub-factor (Pc) to 0.9942 (0.978 in arable lands). As a consequence the
    mean P-factor in Europe will be reduced by 0.5% (0.966). The countries where the
    largest erosion-reducing impact of this measure would be achieved are Italy (Pc
    = 0.9843), Czech Republic (Pc = 0.9872) and Bulgaria (Pc = 0.9893). A drastic
    scenario of applying contour farming in all European arable lands having slopes
    steeper than 5% will result in a Pc = 0.977 and P-factor = 0.949. The preservation
    of stone walls is very important for soil conservation on steep slopes whereas
    the increase of grass margins may potentially reduce soil erosion risk in cropland
    on rolling topography. A scenario of combining contour farming in slopes steeper
    than 5% with doubling grass margins and preserving stone walls may result in P-factor
    = 0.92. In the new EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP 2014–2020), the regulations
    state that farmers must ensure that 5% of their land is set aside from farming
    as an Ecological Focus Area (EFA) to receive their full payment under the Basic
    Payment Scheme. Buffer strips are listed as one of the options but they must be
    on or adjacent to arable land, next to a watercourse or parallel to it (CAP Rural
    Development Plan 2014–2020). Also, research has to identify the areas and conditions
    where the support practices are more efficient. For example, perennial grass which
    is more rigid than grass margins can reduce soil loss by 50% (Dabney et al., 2009).
    Perennial grass is planted close to the contour and differs from other types of
    grass margins in that it resists being inundated by runoff flows and remains erect
    at all times during the year, including dormant periods. In the future, GAEC can
    also set maximum livestock rates per region, land use and slope to prevent compaction
    and overgrazing which leads to erosion. European policy makers have become aware
    of the costs of soil erosion during the recent decade (Boardman and Poesen, 2006);
    thus they focus on strengthening both the soil and crop management practices (reduced
    tillage, plant residues and cover crops) and the support practices (contouring,
    maintenance of stone walls and grass margins) for reducing soil erosion risk.
    The present P-factor modelling approach together with the estimation of the C-factor
    at European scale (Panagos et al., 2015b) is evaluation tools for estimating the
    potential of interventions for soil conservation. Experimental results demonstrated
    that combined practices (e.g. cover crops and contour farming) have better results
    in controlling sediment loss (Verstraeten et al., 2002). A cost/benefit analysis
    of the support practice measurements is also needed. This will allow drawing conclusions
    if the effectiveness of the conservation measures is financially sustainable to
    support additional subsidies to farmers in order to apply those support practices.
    Those conservation measures should focus to erosion prone areas such as arable
    lands on hilly slopes suffering from high erosivity. A significant contribution
    of this study is the quantification of the observed conservation measures. It
    is extremely essential to improve the model input data quality with the farmers’
    participation and the more accurate LUCAS survey observations. Another important
    aspect is increasing awareness and stakeholders’ participation. This requests
    to explain to farmers the GAEC concepts and underlining their important role in
    protecting their land. Moreover, the Member States should assist farmers to identify
    soil erosion risk areas through modelling and GIS simulations. Moreover, policy
    makers should also develop the channels for having the farmer''s feedback. In
    the current world with Smartphone developments, each farmer could easily take
    a photo of soil erosion features or even of applied support practices. Such photos
    with date and GPS coordinates registered in a database then could potentially
    be used for several purposes: control of GAEC implementation, validation of soil
    erosion modelling results, improvement of criteria for incentives, etc. As the
    first assessment of support conservation practices at European level, this study
    has provided constructive feedback on how to improve the LUCAS survey for a more
    accurate assessment in the future. In the LUCAS 2018 survey a more precise observation
    of stone walls status (degraded, good condition, newly established), grass margins
    (poor, good, dense condition) and the presence of contour farming will certainly
    improve the P-factor estimation in Europe. 4.4. Data availability and use The
    P-factor dataset plus the 3 sub-factors (contouring, stone walls and grass margins)
    produced in this study will be freely available for download from the European
    Soil Data Centre (Panagos et al., 2012). Since those data exist at European scale
    for the 3 support practices, they cannot be ignored in modelling soil loss at
    European scale. Based on a large number of field observations, we attempted to
    model the support practices that reduce soil erosion. The results present the
    areas in Europe where those practices are implemented. Even if the results are
    presented at pixel level, it would be better to aggregate these at regional level
    for demonstrating the concentration and impact of support conservation practices.
    5. Conclusions Support practices have a local effect in reducing soil erosion
    risk. This is due to the limited application of the support measures, especially
    contour farming. The stone walls are also limited at European scale and they can
    contribute more efficiently if they are built on steep slopes. The application
    of Good Agricultural Environmental Conditions (GAEC) had an impact in reducing
    soil loss, especially in hilly areas. In the future, policy instruments such as
    GAEC could apply to all Member States implementing contour farming in slopes of
    less than 10% (e.g. 5%), preserving the stone walls and increasing the number
    of grass margins especially in erosion-sensitive areas. Despite the shortcomings
    of the model for P-factor prediction at European scale and simplifying assumptions
    regarding the data, the calculated P-factor is a first estimate of the effects
    of support practices application on soil loss at European level. At catchment
    or regional level, scientists may have a larger number of field observations for
    contour farming, stone walls and grass margins. However, those support practices
    and their local effectiveness (reported in the literature) cannot be ignored in
    soil erosion modelling neither at regional not at European scale. The P-factor
    for Europe was estimated to be 0.97 and thus the three support practices discussed
    reduce the overall soil erosion risk by 3%. Even if the average % reduction is
    relatively small, the effect is considerably larger in erosion-sensitive regions
    such as the Mediterranean or the loess belt. Support practices are mainly applied
    in areas susceptible to soil erosion due to their large values of the LS-factor
    (slope length and gradient) which results in a significant reduction of absolute
    soil loss. The impact of support practices is mainly observed in agricultural
    areas where soil erosion risk is reduced by 5%. Conflict of interest The authors
    confirm and sign that there is no conflict of interests with networks, organisations,
    and data centres referred in the paper. Acknowledgments Rudi Hessel (Alterra)

  analysis: 'The presented research proposes the use of an inexpensive, high-resolution
    RGB camera mounted on an easily accessible UAV for crop cover, actual in-field
    evapotranspiration coefficients, and irrigation uniformity evaluation. The study''s
    key findings include:


    1. The GRVI (green-red vegetation index) is a suitable vegetation index for determining
    vegetation cover and distinguishing between vegetation and other land covers (e.g.,
    soil and dead vegetation). The vegetation fraction (VF) can be accurately measured
    and used by the farmer “on the spot” to define the Kc directly.


    2. The GRVI can be used to distinguish a plant''s phenological stages. Detecting
    early-season and senescence is easy with GRVI: a negative GRVI (less than 0) indicates
    low plant vigor, whereas a positive GRVI (greater than 0) indicates strong plant
    vigor, corresponding to the mid-season plant phenological stage.


    3. The GRVI is better than the NDVI and GNDVI in detecting subtle disturbances
    in the mid-season, such as irrigation uniformity issues.


    4. High-resolution RGB imaging can be used to monitor the uniformity of irrigation
    water application and to detect heterogeneity in field irrigation. Since both
    the camera and the UAV used in this research are inexpensive and available, and
    the current auto-pilot UAV guiding technologies ease the use of UAVs, the presented
    tools should be readily available for “on-the-spot” farming decision-making processes
    involving precision irrigation and irrigation management.'

    and content Highlights • RGB scans were used to evaluate field crops’ canopy cover
    and irrigation uniformity. • A green-red vegetation index (GRVI) was found suitable
    to evaluate vegetation cover. • GRVI successfully recognized crop changes and
    heterogeneity in field irrigation. • Low-cost technique for in-field ET coefficients
    and irrigation uniformity evaluation. Abstract Canopy cover (or vegetation cover)
    maps serve in irrigation management mainly to determine the primary evapotranspiration
    (ET) coefficient, as radiation interception and evaporative surface area are directly
    related to canopy cover. Crop size and development with time depends on water
    supply; therefore, crop canopy maps are tools for the detection of the spatial
    uniformity of irrigation systems. Several aerial scan campaigns were deployed
    in the Upper Galilee of Israel in the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons to follow
    up and evaluate the irrigation uniformity and crop coefficients of peanuts and
    cotton by RGB scans of a Phantom 4 multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and
    DJI Mavic-Pro UAV equipped with RGB and near-infrared (NIR) sensors. Foliage intensity
    and coverage were enhanced by a green-red vegetation index (GRVI), which is a
    normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-like process where the green channel
    replaced the NIR. The results demonstrated that the GRVI is suitable for the purpose
    of determining the vegetation cover. Furthermore, the GRVI yielded better results
    than the NDVI in recognizing phenological crop changes (especially senescence)
    and in detecting heterogeneity in field irrigation. Therefore, this research proves
    the applicability of a low-cost digital camera mounted on an easily accessible
    UAV for crop cover and actual, in-field, ET coefficients determination and irrigation
    uniformity evaluation. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords

    sensingUnmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) 1. Introduction A lot of work has been done
    investigating plants’ spectral reflectance in the visible and near-infrared part
    of the electromagnetic spectrum at different phenological stages. Understanding
    the single leaf’s spectral response and the processes that occur on this level
    allows to apply this knowledge to the canopy level (Hatfield et al., 2008). Spectral
    indexes allow for better information extraction from remotely sensed data because
    they reduce the effects of soil, view angle, and topography, while enhancing the
    focus on the desired extracted feature (e.g., the vegetation indexes enhance the
    visibility of the vegetation) (Hunt et al., 2012). Multitude of vegetation indexes
    (VI) were introduced in order to evaluate plant’s vigor and stress. While multiple
    VIs that use the ratio between the red and near-infrared (NIR) spectral wavebands
    (e.g., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), ratio vegetation index (RVI),
    soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI)) (Huete, 1988; Jordan, 1969; Rouse et al.,
    1973; Tucker, 1979) are successful in reducing atmospheric radiance and transmittance
    (Hunt et al., 2011; Tucker, 1979), the red wavelengths are strongly absorbed by
    chlorophyll and therefore are less sensitive to changes in chlorophyll content
    (Gitelson et al., 1996, 2005; Hunt et al., 2011; Yoder and Waring, 1994). As the
    leaf area index (LAI) increases, apparent canopy chlorophyll content also increases
    regardless of the single-level leaf chlorophyll content, therefore these VIs are
    much more affected by LAI than by changes in chlorophyll at the canopy scale (Daughtry
    et al., 2000; Eitel et al., 2009; Hunt et al., 2011). Since chlorophyll is vital
    for the photosynthesis process, changes in chlorophyll levels can be linked to
    photosynthetic productivity, developmental (phenological) stages, and plant stress.
    Chlorophyll levels also correlate to green vegetation nitrogen levels – nitrogen
    shortage reduces leaf chlorophyll content, thus decreasing plant spectral absorption
    especially in the blue and red wavelengths, therefore increasing reflectance in
    these wavelengths (Gitelson et al., 2005; Haboudane et al., 2004; Hatfield et
    al., 2008; Hunt et al., 2012; Yoder and Waring, 1994). Nitrogen is a vital plant
    nutrient, most important for crop growth and yield. On the other hand, the green
    wavelengths are more sensitive to high chlorophyll levels, since they are less
    absorbed by chlorophyll a and b, unlike the blue, red, and NIR wavelengths (Gitelson
    et al., 1996, 2005; Hunt et al., 2011; Yoder and Waring, 1994). Therefore, VIs
    using the green wavelength are capable of detecting changes in chlorophyll contents
    at the leaf and canopy scale and are suitable to monitor plants’ developmental
    stages and stress. Gitelson et al. (Gitelson et al., 2002) found that the NIR
    reflectance band is less sensitive for determining the vegetation cover (or vegetation
    fraction—VF) for VF > 60% and showed that a VI using the green–red–blue wavelengths
    have a linear relationship to VF, with an accuracy level of up to 90%. They showed
    that in wheat, when VF is between 50 and 100%, the green wavelength is most sensitive
    to changes in the vegetation cover (while the blue, red, and NIR wavelengths are
    insensitive to changes in the vegetation cover). Adamsen et al. (Adamsen et al.,
    1999) measured “Greenness” of wheat plants throughout the cropping season using
    a digital camera, a hand-held radiometer, and chlorophyll meter. They found that
    the green to red (G/R) spectral wavelengths ratio index is sensitive to the amount
    of greenness of the plant: it is less than 1 in the beginning and at the end of
    the growing season, and above 1 at midseason (Adamsen et al., 1999; Kanemasu,
    1974). The G/R index obtained from an uncalibrated digital camera was more sensitive
    to plant senescence than the chlorophyll meter, and on par with the NDVI index
    obtained from the hand-held radiometer, thus proving that moderate cost digital
    cameras can be used to monitor crop senescence (Adamsen et al., 1999). Kanemasu
    (Kanemasu, 1974) concluded that the G/R ratio may serve as a benchmark for crop
    growth, phenological stages, and for indicating the VF. Another VI that is based
    on the G/R ratio is the green-red vegetation index (GRVI) that is defined according
    to Eq. (1): (1) Motohka et al. (Motohka et al., 2010) evaluated the use of the
    GRVI as a phenological indicator. They concluded that the GRVI index can differentiate
    between green vegetation (index above 0), water and snow (index around 0), and
    soils (index below 0). Furthermore, they demonstrated that the GRVI (unlike the
    NDVI) is sensitive to leaf color change (leaf greening and autumn coloring). They
    suggested using the threshold of GRVI = 0 as a site-specific threshold for monitoring
    phenological changes and the GRVI index as an indicator for plant disturbances,
    and comparing between different ecosystem types (Motohka et al., 2010). Remote
    sensing for crop management aims at providing spatial and spectral information
    for crop classification, crop condition, yield forecast, and weed/disease detection
    and management. Current satellite-based remotely sensed products can cover large
    areas, but they are limited by both their temporal (revisit time – 2 and 5 days
    for Venus and Sentinel-2 satellites, respectively) and spatial (pixel size – 5–10 m
    for Venus and Sentinel-2, respectively) resolutions, when compared to unmanned
    aerial vehicle (UAV). One of satellite imaging’s challenges is dealing with pixels
    that have multiple objects with different spectral signatures (e.g., plants and
    soil). Such pixels are called mixed-pixels. UAV, imaging high spatial resolution,
    produces mixed-free pixels, therefore making vegetation detection and differentiation
    an easier task. Similarly, high spatial resolution allows for a precise estimation
    of the vegetation cover fraction. A basic method for irrigation scheduling is
    factoring the potential evapotranspiration (PET), computed from measured radiation,
    wind speed, air temperature, and relative humidity, with a crop-specific coefficient
    (Kc)) as widely accepted and formulated by the FAO #56 publication (Testa et al.,
    2011). Crop coefficients are provided by diverse methods, such as empirical conclusions
    from field experiments, degree-day-based seasonal functions, experts’ recommendations,
    and the FAO #56 publication Kc library, or by field-specific measurements. According
    to the Penman-Monteith equation, solar radiation comprise about 85% of the evapotranspiration
    (ET) driving energy received by the crop canopy (Testa et al., 2011), and intercepted
    solar radiation is directly proportional to the light interception (LI) (Green
    et al., 2003; Johnson et al., 2000; Meron et al., 1989). Further, since LI is
    directly proportional to crop canopy cover, Kc can be fitted to the field- and
    plot-specific dimension by measuring crop cover. Therefore, VF can be used as
    Kc. Aerial survey-derived VFs are directly proportional to cover, (Meron et al.,
    2006) thus digital aerial photography provides an efficient method for Kc determination
    (Campillo et al., 2008). Precision irrigation can be defined as matching water
    application to crops’ need in space, time and amount. Variable rate water application
    to achieve that is feasible with solid set systems using modern controllers and
    in variable rate center pivot or lateral move irrigation machines, all available
    in the open market. However, such application needs spatial and temporal crop
    water status information in sufficient resolution and accuracy, attainable mainly
    by aerial sensing and imagery (Haghverdi et al., 2015; Nahry et al., 2011; Zhang
    et al., 2011). Digital aerial photography became affordable and popularized with
    the appearance in the open market of low cost, high performance small sized unmanned
    aerial vehicles (UAV) carrying high resolution digital cameras, in contrast with
    the former less accessible human flown aerial photography. Testing of these new
    enabling technologies for precision irrigation information acquisition is obviously
    needed. Such a technology is presented herein. The main objectives of this study
    were to test the ability of an inexpensive RGB camera mounted on an inexpensive
    UAV to determine vegetation cover and vigor of the canopy at a large-scale whole-field
    resolution and to investigate whether vegetation cover and vigor patterns can
    be utilized as indicators for irrigation water uniformity, and as such, feedback
    information for precision water application at variable rate irrigation (VRI)
    systems. Another objective of this study was to compare the efficiency of an RGB-
    based VI with that of the well-known NDVI, both in UAV-based high spatial resolution
    cameras and via satellite imaging. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. UAV imaging system
    DJI Phantom 4 quadcopter UAV was used as the flying platform. The UAV is equipped
    with a built-in RGB camera with a 4000 × 3000 pixel 4 K resolution CMOS sensor,
    a 20 mm (35 mm eq.) lens with field of view (FOV) of 94°, in a 3-axis stabilized
    gimbal (https://www.dji.com/phantom-4/info). The UAV was flown using Pix4D Capture
    pre-programmed flightpath control. The Parrot Sequoia multispectral sensor was
    used in order to compare NDVI with GRVI. The Parrot Sequoia sensor consists of
    five downward-looking image sensors: a Visible 16 MegaPixel (MP) (RGB) with a
    definition of 4608 × 3456 pixels and four 1.2 MP: Green (550 nm), Red (660 nm),
    Red Edge (735 nm), and Near-infrared (790 nm) bands, 1280 × 960 pixels (https://www.parrot.com/business-solutions-us/parrot-professional/parrot-sequoia#parrot-sequoia-pix4d-precise-data-brings-accurate-analysis).
    The sensor was mounted on a DJI Mavic-Pro small-size, foldable-rotor quadcopter
    UAV. Sensors were factory pre-calibrated. Parrot Sequoia sensor was recalibrated
    before each campaign using a white balance reference target. Phantom 4 RGB sensor’s
    white balance setting was set to sunny. No other color or style enhancements were
    made to the obtained images. 2.2. Flight campaigns Flight campaigns were conducted
    in three test sites: the Gadot center pivot test site (33°2′22.91″ N, 35°38′0.43″
    E), the Havat Gadash field crops experimental farm (33°10′56.24″ N, 35°35′5.78″
    E), and the Hagoshrim lateral move test site (33°11′57.75″ N, 35°38′19.15″ E),
    all three located in the Upper Galilee region in the northern part of Israel.
    The area has a Mediterranean climate, characterized by wet, mild winters with
    mean minimum and maximum temperatures of 7 and 14 °C, respectively, and hot, dry
    summers with mean minimum and maximum temperatures of 19 and 32 °C respectively.
    Annual winter rainfall is in the range of 400–600 mm, while summer crops utilize
    80–120 mm of winter soil water storage for the initial growth periods. At the
    Havat Gadash, peanuts cv Hanoch were sown on 1 May 2017 and irrigated uniformly
    by an experimental lateral move, starting on 8 May (Table 1). PET was calculated
    according to the Penman–Monteith formula, based on meteorological field data.
    Kc was calculated as cumulative irrigation divided by cumulative ET. Four differential
    irrigation treatments were performed starting on 19 July (Fig. 1). The Kc (70%)
    treatment yielded the highest crop weight per area (5.86 ton/hectare; more than
    0.7 ton/hectare compared to the rest of the treatments), implying optimal water
    application and water use, and was selected for ground truth validation – comparing
    field measured Kc with aerial imagery calculation of VF. Experimental plots were
    four 12 × 25 m plots, side by side in four replicates (Fig. 1). Seven flight campaigns
    were conducted at midday, at 10–50 m altitude and pixel spatial resolution of
    0.006–0.02 m (Table 2). Crop cover did not reach full cover during the first two
    campaigns (25 June, 17 July). Full cover is reached when there are less than 20%
    pixels that are classified as bare soil. Table 1. Cumulative evapotranspiration

    pivot test site was cultivated with cotton crop, sown on 4 April 2017. The field
    was irrigated at eight-day intervals beginning from 3 June. Two flight campaigns
    were conducted on 5 July and 24 August, when the crop had already reached full
    cover. The flights were conducted at midday, at 50 m altitude and pixel spatial
    resolution of 0.02 m (Table 2). The field at the Hagoshrim lateral move test site
    was cultivated with cotton crop, sown on 1 1 March 2018. The field was irrigated
    at five-day intervals beginning from 24 May. Two flight campaigns were conducted
    on 17 and 26 June, when the crop had already reached full cover. The flights were
    conducted at midday, at 100 m altitude and pixel spatial resolution of 0.043 m
    (Table 2). Flight courses were created with the Pix4Dcapture software, which was
    also used to automatically pilot the DJI Phantom 4 UAV according to the flight
    path. An overlap percentage of 70–80% was chosen in order to ease the task of
    mosaicking. In order to compare NDVI and GRVI, a flight campaign using the DJI
    Mavic-Pro UAV was conducted in the peanut field at the Havat Gadash experimental
    farm on October 10, 2017, twelve days before the end of the growing season (Table
    2). The Parrot Sequoia multispectral sensor was used to create the NDVI, while
    the RGB camera was used to create the GRVI. 2.3. Data processing The images collected
    in each flight campaign were mosaicked and georeferenced using the Pix4Dmapper
    software. The ArcGIS 10.5 geo-referencing tools were used for fine adjustments.
    VF was calculated using ArcGIS 10.5, calculating the histogram of the GRVI products.
    Pixels with GRVI values greater than 0 were classified as vegetation, according
    to Motohka et al. (2010). Sentinel-2 Level-2 A atmospherically corrected images
    of the Gadot test site from 29 August 2017 were acquired courtesy of the Copernicus
    Open Access Hub. Venus satellite Level-1 radiometrically corrected and top-of-atmosphere
    reflectance images of the Hagoshrim test site from 17 June 2018 were acquired
    courtesy of CNES (French government space agency) ISA (Israeli space agency) and
    the scientific center at the Ben-Gurion University, Israel. Several VIs were created
    and compared to the UAV images, in order to check whether it is possible to use
    Sentinel-2 and Venus satellite imaging (with spatial resolution of 10 and 5 m,
    respectively) to determine irrigation uniformity issues. The following VIs were
    checked: NDVI (Tucker, 1979), green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI)
    (Gitelson et al., 1996), and GRVI (Motohka et al., 2010; Tucker, 1979). UAV images
    were compared to similar date satellites images for the sake of proper comparison
    (same day as Venus, and 4 days apart from Sentinel-2 imagery). All images taken
    with the DJI Phantom-4 UAV built in camera equipped with a gimbal assuring vertical
    nadir direction, were acquired close to midday (when the sun is close to zenith),
    taking images of flat agricultural surfaces, thus limiting bidirectional reflectance
    distribution function (BRDF) complication. Furthermore, at the height of UAV image
    acquisition (10–100 m) and for the purpose of analyzing RGB color space no special
    calibration or atmospheric correction was applied beyond the standard factory
    calibration. 3. Results 3.1. Havat Gadash experimental farm campaign The RGB images
    (Fig. 2A,C) have high spatial resolution (0.0066 m, see Table 2), allowing the
    differentiation of crop from soil. Negative GRVI values were classified as non-vegetation
    (i.e. soil), and positive GRVI values were classified as vegetation. The VFs determined
    according to the GRVI images'' histograms were 46% and 87% (Fig. 3A,B respectively):
    whereas, the VF can be determined as 1 minus the intersection value of the cumulative
    GRVI graph with the Y axis in Fig. 3, The field calculated Kc for the campaign
    dates (Table 1: highlighted Kcs) of 40% and 86% were in-par with the image calculated
    VFs of 46% and 87%, respectively, validating the VF calculations. Download : Download

    Fig. 3. Histogram of the GRVI images of the peanut field in Havat Gadash experimental
    farm on 25 June (A, 55 days from sowing) and on 17 July (B, 77 days from sowing).
    Cumulative values are presented on major Y-axis and histogram value are presented
    on secondary Y-axis. The GRVI images revealed crop phenological stages: whereas
    9% of the pixels’ GRVI values in the image taken 55 days from sowing were below
    zero and outside of the “soil curve” pixels group (Fig. 3A), only 3% of the pixels’
    GRVI were below zero and outside of the “soil curve” pixels group in the later
    image at 77 days from sowing (Fig. 3B). These pixels that don’t belong to either
    the soil or vegetation classified groups, were classified as non-vegetation pixels
    (due to their negative GRVI value), but could also be classified as vegetation
    in early phenological stages with G/R ratio values less than 1 (negative GRVI
    value yields G/R ratio below 1)—indicative of the beginning of the growing season.
    Furthermore, the “vegetation curve” in the later image is further away from the
    Y-axis compared to the chronologically earlier image (Fig. 3A,B) with higher positive
    GRVI values, indicative of healthy and vital vegetation suitable to the midseason
    phenological stage. As can be seen in Table 2 – crop cover reaches almost 100%
    (full cover) by the third flight campaign, but in later campaign there is a drop
    in VF. The reason behind this is due to pest damage (wild boars; see Fig. 1, bottom
    left corner). Images are not shown. 3.2. Comparison between NDVI and GRVI Since
    there were two different sensors measuring the NDVI and the GRVI (Section 2.3),
    the spatial resolution of the NDVI was lower (pixel size of 0.0373 m) than that
    of the GRVI (0.0095 m), thus enabling sharper GRVI imagery. The image was taken
    toward the end of the season, depicting plants in different stages of senescence.
    The RGB image was classified into specific classes (bare soil, dead vegetation,
    light green vegetation, dark green vegetation) using supervised classification
    aided by Image-Pro software (http://www.mediacy.com/imagepro) “Smart Segmentation”
    algorithm (Fig. 4B). Table 3 presents the total area for each defined class, for
    the classified RGB, GRVI and NDVI images. As seen in Table 3, the GRVI classification
    is more similar to the RGB classification, especially in detecting light and dark
    green vegetation, differentiating between healthy (dark green) and stressed (i.e.
    in senescence) plants (light green). As can be seen in Fig. 4, the GRVI captured
    plant senescence better than the NDVI: changes in plant color from green to yellow
    are depicted more accurately in the GRVI image than in the NDVI image. Greener
    vegetation (depicted in the RGB image Fig. 4A,B) has higher GRVI values (Fig.
    4C). On the other hand, the NDVI image (Fig. 4D) did not capture the color differences
    between plants that are visible in the RGB image (Fig. 4A,B). The NDVI values
    are very high for most pixels (0.81-0.92, Fig. 4D), indicating saturation of the
    NDVI values, probably due to high LAI values (Daughtry et al., 2000; Eitel et
    al., 2009; Hunt et al., 2011). It is probable that the differences in pixel resolution
    are also responsible for the accuracy differences. Regardless, for the purpose
    of vegetation classification and vigor analysis, the use of RGB VI is preferable
    to that of the NDVI. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download

    site campaign The images of the Gadot pivot irrigated cotton crop were taken after
    the crop had reached full canopy cover (Fig. 5A,C). A closer look at the GRVI
    images reveals “sector” lines, indicating differences in plant vigor (Fig. 5B,D).
    The “sector” patterns are indicative of ununiformed irrigation, due to intermittent
    pivot movement: the “greener” areas probably received more irrigation, due to
    lower pivot speed. This could have resulted from physical obstacles, uneven ground,
    malfunctioning pivot control, etc. Whereas these “sectors” are noticeably visible
    in the GRVI image, it is impossible to notice them in the RGB image. Therefore,
    using the GRVI in this case is crucial in order to detect irrigation uniformity,
    irrigation malfunctions, and other subtle disturbances. Download : Download high-res

    GNDVI images are pretty similar, showing high values homogenously throughout the
    whole field, except for the middle left corner (Fig. 6A,B). The GRVI image is
    more heterogeneous, showing patches of low values that are correlated to the UAV
    high-resolution GRVI image’s patches (Figs. 5D and 6 C), indicative of the field’s
    heterogeneous plant vigor and ununiformed irrigation. The GRVI is therefore better
    at presenting the real crop vigor situation. Whereas the saturation of red reflectance
    at intermediate to high chlorophyll values is well known (Gitelson et al., 2005;
    Kanemasu, 1974) and is typical of NDVI, it is surprising to see that the GNDVI
    was also saturated and did not show field’s heterogeneity. Download : Download

    The images of the irrigated cotton at the Hagoshrim lateral move irrigation system
    were taken after the crop had reached full canopy cover albeit it is possible
    to see within the field bare soil lines that were created due to the pivot’s wheels
    movement (Fig. 7C). A closer look at the GRVI images reveals lines, indicating
    differences in plant vigor (Fig. 7A,B). These patterns are indicators for ununiformed
    irrigation. There are both horizontal and vertical lines (Fig. 7A,B). The horizontal
    lines are indicative of intermittent pivot movement: Similar to the Gadot test
    site, the denser biomass (greener) areas probably received more irrigation, due
    to lower pivot speed. The vertical lines are indicative of differences in the
    amount of water delivered by the different sprinklers on board the pivot, and/or
    differences in the amount of overlap of irrigation between neighboring sprinklers.
    The heterogeneity in field’s plant vigor enhances as a function of time, indicative
    of an irrigation machine related persistent operation malfunction that is responsible
    for the ununiformed irrigation. On the practical level, such maps can be shown
    to the operator (and in fact has been shown) in order to readjust lateral water
    distribution of the machine, and to identify and remove obstacles in machine movement
    along the travel path. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download

    3.6. Venus satellite VI of the Hagoshrim test site Similarly to the findings of
    the Sentinel-2 satellite at the Gadot campaign (Fig. 6), the NDVI and GNDVI images
    of Venus satellite (Fig. 8A,B) are pretty similar, showing lower values of field
    variability, when compared to the GRVI image (Fig. 8C). The vertical lines can
    be seen in all images, albeit most clearly in the GRVI image. Horizontal lines
    cannot be identified in any of the compared VI. The GRVI image is more heterogeneous,
    showing patches of low values that are correlated to the UAV high-resolution GRVI
    image’s patches (Figs. 7A and 8 C). Therefore once more confirming that the GRVI
    is better than NDVI and GNDVI at presenting the real crop vigor situation. Download

    with the aid of UAVs as described in this research can support and validate farmer’s
    irrigation decision making process. Field irrigation depends on crop cover ratio,
    therefore up until the crop reaches full cover, it is necessary to re-evaluate
    crop cover at short time intervals in order to optimize irrigation water quantities.
    The technique proposed in this research offers an affordable and accurate solution.
    We propose conducting a UAV flight campaign a day before the scheduled irrigation
    in order to determine the current field’s crop cover ratio, thus aiding the farmer
    in determining crop specific coefficient. An aerial survey should be conducted
    for every irrigation zone. In case the zone is very big, it is possible to sample
    only some parts of the whole area, based on the field’s inherent heterogeneity
    (e.g. soil texture, soil type, soil water content, apparent soil electrical conductivity),
    and previous flight campaigns wherein crop cover heterogeneity was observed. Such
    sampling is beyond the scope of this paper, however it should be noted that the
    proposed techniques for crop cover estimation and crop heterogeneity detection
    can be integrated into other existing techniques that aim to improve the design
    of irrigation systems (Fortes et al., 2015). VRI systems can use crop cover ratio
    findings and heterogeneity in plant vigor in order to construct irrigation maps
    according to plants’ water demands and to better prescribe variable irrigation
    rates according to plant size and cover ratio. Even though much better, more accurate
    (and more expensive) sensors exist in the open market, we argue that for the purpose
    of determining crop cover ratio, utilizing affordable CMOS sensors such as were
    used in this research is adequate. Very high spatial resolution is paramount:
    it cancels the problem of mixed-pixels, and allows to obtain pure pixels of vegetation
    and bare soil, thus enabling to distinguish between bare soil and vegetation.
    It is possible to differentiate soil from crop cover using raw RGB images (Fig.
    2A,C). However, in order to quantify the ratio of crop cover to bare soil, it
    is necessary to classify these classes. Such a classification from RGB image is
    very complex, since there are 2563 options of color combinations for each pixel.
    Converting the RGB image into a vegetation index simplifies the classification
    task tremendously. As Motohka et al. (Motohka et al., 2010) concluded, the GRVI
    is very suitable for such a task, wherein GRVI index values of above zero can
    be classified as green vegetation (Figs. 2B,D, 3). Furthermore, as shown in the
    results, the GRVI was sensitive to differences in crop’s plant vigor, as expressed
    in chlorophyll composition and intensity, and in the number of pixels with negative,
    close to zero GRVI values at various phenological stages (Figs. 2,3), thus it
    could potentially be used in some crops as an indicator in determining phenological
    stages, and as a benchmark for phenological stages transitioning, such as senescence
    in groundnuts in this study. The GRVI also proved to be superior to the NDVI in
    detecting plant vigor, senescence, and irrigation uniformity (Fig. 4, Fig. 5,
    Fig. 6). Detecting irrigation water uniformity is crucial for the purpose of optimizing
    water use and crop yields. Our results demonstrate that specifically in pivot
    irrigation, it is possible to detect heterogeneity in plant vigor that are caused
    due to abnormal pivot movement. The “sectors” that are perpendicular to the pivot’s
    advancement direction, or horizontal lines in lateral moves, are indicative for
    slower pivot speed and over irrigation (Figs. 5,7); denser vegetation lines formed
    at the direction of the machine’s advancement (vertical lines) are indicative
    of inherent problems in the sprinkler system calibration: overwatering / under-watering;
    distance between sprinklers; sprinklers’ overlap due to the height of the sprinkler
    from the ground (Fig. 7). High spatial resolution UAV images are superior to the
    lower resolution satellite imaging in finding the “fine” lines that demarcate
    the field’s heterogeneity (Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8): whereas some of the
    lines were identified by the satellites’ GRVI, it gave a rough idea towards understanding
    differences of plant vigor within the field’s scale. In order to further analyze
    the intricacies of the field’s heterogeneity it is necessary to get a closer look
    via UAV or other higher spatial resolution devices. Still, it was proven that
    satellite imaging can provide valuable information on large spatial scales regarding
    the field’s plant vigor heterogeneity that can be further investigated on finer
    scales upon demand. 5. Conclusions In this study, the ability of a high-resolution
    RGB imaging to determine vegetation cover and vigor at the canopy scale at whole-field
    resolution was evaluated, using an RGB VI, namely, the GRVI. It was concluded
    that the GRVI is suitable for determining vegetation cover, distinguishing between
    vegetation and other land covers (such as soil and dead vegetation, Fig. 2). The
    VF can be accurately measured and used by the farmer “on the spot” in order to
    directly define the Kc. It was also shown that the GRVI can be used to distinguish
    a plant’s phenological stages. In fact, detecting early season and senescence
    is easy with GRVI: a GRVI lower than 0 indicates low plant’s vigor, whereas a
    GRVI greater than zero, indicates strong plant vigor, corresponding to the mid-season
    plant phenological stage (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4). It was also concluded that
    the GRVI is better than the NDVI and GNDVI in detecting subtle disturbances in
    mid-season (Fig. 6). High-resolution RGB imaging can be utilized to monitor the
    uniformity of irrigation water application and to detect heterogeneity in field
    irrigation (Fig. 5). Since both the camera and the UAV used in this research are
    inexpensive and available and the current auto-pilot UAV guiding technologies
    ease the use of UAVs, the presented tools should be available for “on-the-spot”
    farming decision-making processes involving precision irrigation and irrigation
    management. Author contributions Conceptualization, Assaf Chen and Moshe Meron;

    scheduling (Chen et al., 2019), and water management (Cancela et al., 2019; Peddinti
    and Kambhammettu, 2019) from filed to watershed scales. Over the last decade,
    a growing number of satellite platforms have provided land surface temperature

  title: Applying high-resolution visible-channel aerial imaging of crop canopy to
    precision irrigation management
  verbatim_quote1: Canopy cover (or vegetation cover) maps serve in irrigation management
    mainly to determine the primary evapotranspiration (ET) coefficient, as radiation
    interception and evaporative surface area are directly related to canopy cover.
  verbatim_quote2: In a previous study, Kanemasu inferred that the G/R ratio may serve
    as a benchmark for crop growth, phenological stages, and for indicating the VF.

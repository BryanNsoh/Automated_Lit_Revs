  analysis: While the paper presents an overview of SDR concepts and their relevance
    to WSNs, it lacks detailed analysis of specific use cases and technical implementation.
    The paper mentions different application fields of WSNs but does not provide specific
    examples of how SDR can address challenges or improve the performance of WSNs
    in these fields. Furthermore, the paper does not include any quantitative or qualitative
    evaluation of SDR in WSNs, making it difficult to assess its actual impact and
    advantages. A more thorough analysis with specific examples and technical details
    would strengthen the relevance and impact of the paper.

    \ grown \nand evolved in recent years, offering new connectivity \nservices to\
    \ users, who demand a faster information \ntransfer and improved mobile services.\
    \ New scenarios \nappear where heterogeneous networks and a dynamic \naccess to\
    \ the spectrum become more important to the \nindustry, the academia, and the\
    \ regulators [1, 2]. On \nthe other hand, semiconductor manufacturers and \nworkgroups,\
    \ such as WiFi Alliance, ZigBee Alliance, \nand Bluetooth Alliance, are making\
    \ an effort to both \nimprove the functionalities of electronic devices \nand\
    \ create standards that allow the mass use of \ntechnologies such as Wireless\
    \ Sensor Networks \n(WSNs) in IP connectivity schemes, developing \nthe paradigm\
    \ known as “Internet of Things” (IoT) \n[3]. Recently, WSN solutions have been\
    \ developed \nin the fields of industrial and building automation, \nprocess control,\
    \ agricultural monitoring, medical \nassistance, public transportation, and emergency\
    \ care \nsystems, among others, demonstrating that the WSN \nincreasingly integrates\
    \ into everyday activities, \nimproving various tasks [4, 5]. In this context,\
    \ the \nconcept of Software Defined Radio (SDR) is of great \nimportance thanks\
    \ to its adaptability, interoperability, \nand convergence, as well as its ability\
    \ to implement \ndynamic access functionalities to the spectrum. \nNowadays, those\
    \ aspects have not been commercially \nimplemented, due to the high costs and\
    \ complexity \nof the equipment [6].\nFrom this perspective, this review paper\
    \ approaches \nthe problems of the WSNs from the point of view \nof integration\
    \ with SDR. First, the paper introduces \nthe concepts of SDR; then, it reviews\
    \ the WSN \napplication fields, and the problems that can be \nattacked from a\
    \ SDR perspective; subsequently, it \nanalyzes and discuss the current state of\
    \ WSN and \nthe opportunities for SDR; and finally, it compares \nthe available\
    \ development systems that allow \nimplementing these functionalities.\nII. Software\
    \ defIned radIo\nThe term “Software Radio” was used in the early \n1990’s by Joseph\
    \ Mitola III to refer to a type of radio \nthat was able to implement different\
    \ communication \nstandards from the same hardware. For this purpose, \nthe signal\
    \ modulation and encoding are performed \nby a software [6]. Software radio seeks\
    \ to work \nthe signal mostly in the digital domain to delegate \nsome functions\
    \ of the hardware to the software, \nusing analog-to-digital (ADC) and digital\
    \ to analog \n(DAC) converters. Figure 1 shows a functional \nblock diagram of\
    \ a device implementing SDR \nfunctionalities, in which three important sections\
    \ \nare shown. The Radio Frequency (RF) section \nthat receives and sends the\
    \ signal to the medium \nis essentially composed of the antenna and radio \nfrequency\
    \ amplifiers; the Intermediate Frequency \n(IF) section is responsible for changing\
    \ the domain \nto the signal, i.e., in the case of a receiver, the signal \ngoes\
    \ from the analogue to the digital domain, while \nthe operating frequency is\
    \ taken to an intermediate \nfrequency by means of the Digital Down-Converter\
    \ \n(DDC); finally, the baseband section is where the \nsignal is processed to\
    \ demodulate and decode, and \nthus extract the information [7, 8].\n \n \n N\n\

    \ 2017. Tunja-Boyacá, Colombia.\nOpportunities to implement Software Defined Radio\
    \ in network sensors\nThe ability to implement hardware functionalities \nin software\
    \ through signal processing in the digital \ndomain instead of the analogue creates\
    \ a new scenario \nfor telecommunications. First, it allows to operate \ndifferent\
    \ multi-band, multihoming, and multi-\npurpose standards in the same device without\
    \ any \nhardware modification [10], and second, it provides \nscalability of communication\
    \ systems by facilitating \nnetwork updating and equipment functionalities \n\
    from the physical layer to the application layer, thus \nachieving a better response\
    \ to the market dynamics \n[10], which might change the scheme of a static \n\
    network by an ad hoc network for mobility services \n[11]. In addition, it enables\
    \ the implementation of the \ncommunication stack in a modular way for a specific\
    \ \napplication, responding to its particular needs in \nterms of operating frequency,\
    \ modulation and coding \nform, number of nodes, or network topology to \nachieve\
    \ a better performance. It also supports the \nuse of dynamic spectrum access\
    \ techniques to use \nthe frequency bands of licensed users in idle time \nintervals,\
    \ so that they do not interfere with the quality \nof the paid service [12, 13];\
    \ this paradigm is known \nas cognitive radio. Furthermore, it provides the \n\
    necessary tools to maintain high levels of quality of \nservice (QoS), from the\
    \ frequency band adaptability, \nmodulation, coding, transmission rate, or routing\
    \ \nscheme [14] through the use of indicators such \nas PER (Packet Error Rate)\
    \ or LQI (Link Quality \nIndicator). Finally, SDR is a technology that, due to\
    \ \nits ability to update functionalities, allows the use \nof a device in different\
    \ environments with different \ncharacteristics, and in this sense, SDR equipment\
    \ \ngenerates a lower environmental impact by having \nan obsolescence rate lower\
    \ than traditional hardware.\nIII. wIreleSS SenSor networkS\nSignificant cost\
    \ reductions in micro-controllers, \nincreased information processing capacity,\
    \ reduced \nenergy consumption, and the emergence of free-\nbandwidth wireless\
    \ technologies such as ZigBee, \nBluetooth, and WiMAX have fostered the integration\
    \ \nof WSN in industrial applications, and in the daily \nlife of people. Nowadays,\
    \ sensor networks can \nbe found in a wide range of locations, such as \nmanufacturing\
    \ and production processes, agricultural \nfarming systems, public transport systems,\
    \ building \nsurveillance systems, home automation and control \nsystems, offices\
    \ and industries, personal medical \nassistance services, crisis assistance systems,\
    \ and \nnatural disasters [4, 5, 15, 16].\nDepending on the used standard, WSN\
    \ implements \npoint-to-point, multipoint, mesh, or star topologies \n(Fig. 2).\
    \ However, in general, WSN presents a \nscheme containing multiple sensing nodes,\
    \ and at \nleast one central device in charge of managing the \nnetwork (coordinator),\
    \ which can act as Gateway \nto interconnect the network with other networks or\
    \ \ninterfaces with different standards. Figure 3 shows \nthe general architecture\
    \ of a sensing node. In practice, \nthe sensing nodes can have actuators, and\
    \ a graphical \ninterface if required.\nNode\nGateway\nfIg. 2. Interconnect topologies\

    A. Building automation\nApplications related to the automation of spaces \nin\
    \ homes, buildings, hospitals, hotels, and others \nhave been highly commercially\
    \ developed in recent \nyears. Companies like Control4 offer services for \npersonalization\
    \ of spaces ranging from lighting \ncontrol and multimedia content to air conditioning,\
    \ \nthe latter using HVAC (Heating, Ventilating and Air \nConditioning) [17].\
    \ There are proposals oriented to \nsecurity systems through the use of cameras,\
    \ sensors, \nalarms, and identifiers that allow alerting in case \nof an anomalous\
    \ situation [18]. Also, there may be \ntools to monitor and control the energy\
    \ consumption \nof appliances [19]. For these purposes, technologies \nsuch as\
    \ ZigBee, WiFi, Bluetooth, RFID (Radio \nFrequency Identification), UWB (Ultra-Wide\
    \ Band), \nHome RF, Zwave, and GSM are implemented with \na tendency toward remote\
    \ administration from the \nInternet. In this sense, a Gateway or link element\
    \ \nmust be available between the personal network \nand a public access network\
    \ [21, 22]. This type of \nenvironment is characterized by involving different\
    \ \ncommunication standards within the same network, \nso that they can offer\
    \ different services according to \nthe characteristics of each technology, for\
    \ example, \nto provide a better interaction between the system \nand the user\
    \ through WEB interfaces, LCD screens, \napplications for mobile devices, or even\
    \ GSM (Global \nSystem for Mobile Communications) connection for \ntelephony services\
    \ [23]. Internet connectivity is of \ngreat interest, so much so that different\
    \ strategies \nlike Web Services Description Language (WSDL) \nand SOAP (Simple\
    \ Object Access Protocol) are \nimplemented to make a virtual connection between\
    \ \nthe nodes and a web server, where the server \nidentifies each device with\
    \ an IP address [22]. Also, \nthe easy integration and configuration of devices\
    \ \nfrom the user’s perspective, and the compatibility \nbetween teams of different\
    \ companies have led to the \nemergence of protocols such as OSGI (Open Service\
    \ \nGateway Initiative) [24].\nIn this context, a scenario exists with a lot of\
    \ potential \nfor sensor networks to offer and continue developing \nmultiple\
    \ services. However, some issues still remain \nunsolved in terms of installation\
    \ ease and scalability, as \nwell as incompatibility between devices, even though\
    \ \nmost of them are based on the 802.15.4 standard. \nHeterogeneous networks\
    \ must be more flexible so \nthat they can be upgraded to provide more services\
    \ \nby including new wired and wireless technologies, \nsuch as compatibility\
    \ with infrared communications, \nfiber optic services (FTTH), multimedia services\
    \ in \nbands other than 2.4 GHz such as UWB, and better \nintegration with Body\
    \ Area Networks (WBSN). In \nthis sense, SDR can offer viable solutions to cover\
    \ \nthese problems, for example, an approach to build a \nGateway using an SDR\
    \ device, which also integrates \nfiber optic technology, that solves the problem\
    \ of \ninteroperability by updating the network with the \ninclusion of new standards,\
    \ and providing new tools \nto improve the quality of the multimedia services\
    \ is \nproposed in [25].\nB. Agriculture\nRecently, the concept of precision agriculture\
    \ has \nappeared, which, through sensor networks and \nenvironmental variable\
    \ control systems, can increase \nproductivity and crop quality [15]. Plantations\
    \ in \ndifferent regions of the world have used sensor \nnetworks to monitor parameters\
    \ such as temperature, \nhumidity, radiation intensity and photosensitive flow,\
    \ \namong others, to keep records of productivity in \nrelation to environmental\
    \ conditions [26]. Also, these \nsystems allow early identification of pests for\
    \ early \nintervention and recovery of plants [27]. Automatic \nirrigation systems\
    \ [28] and fertilizer distribution [29] \nhave been developed according to the\
    \ needs, so that \nwater savings of 30 % to 60 % have been achieved. \nFrom variables\
    \ such as humidity, CO2, PH level, \ntemperature, the appropriate levels of Nitrogen,\
    \ \nPotassium and Phosphorus, and the amount of \nfertilizer to be supplied are\
    \ determined [30, 31]. WSN \nallows identifying the factors that affect the quality\
    \ \nof the harvest, a critical element in the production of \nwines, for example,\
    \ as in [32], where the geographic \ncharacteristics of the terrain generated\
    \ a variation \nof 35 % in the temperature within the vineyard, \ngenerating variations\
    \ in the quality and profile of \n142\nRevista Facultad de Ingeniería (Rev. Fac.\
    \ Ing.) Vol. 26 (45), pp. 137-148. Mayo-Agosto, 2017. Tunja-Boyacá, Colombia.\n\
    Opportunities to implement Software Defined Radio in network sensors\nthe harvested\
    \ grapes. In greenhouses, it is possible \nto implement automated temperature,\
    \ humidity, and \nlighting control systems to ensure product quality \nstandards\
    \ [33], and in addition, these systems allow \na more efficient use of resources,\
    \ such as personnel, \nwater supply, fertilizer and electrical energy, as \ndescribed\
    \ in [34], where two fuzzy controllers \nare implemented to achieve the desired\
    \ internal \ntemperature, with actuators in windows, artificial \nlights, water\
    \ valves, and heaters.\nThere are many advantages of implementing WSN in \nagriculture,\
    \ however, this is a field that is still under \ndevelopment, and has some important\
    \ limitations, \nsuch as the energy consumption of the nodes, and \nthe large\
    \ dimension of the used networks in terms \nof number of nodes and coverage that\
    \ hampers the \ndesign and maintenance of the network. Additionally, \neach case\
    \ and application must undergo a particular \ndevelopment that must be validated\
    \ in the field, in \norder to overcome potential problems of signal \nfading and\
    \ degradation that the equipment may \nsuffer due to the variable environmental\
    \ conditions \n[26]. The monitoring and/or control systems seek to \nbe remotely\
    \ managed, so they must be connected to a \nnetwork that facilitates interaction\
    \ with the user, and \nthat, for coverage issues, may be Internet or GSM; \ntherefore,\
    \ there must be a device that communicates \nbetween different standards. Also,\
    \ new strategies \nshould be reviewed to extend the life cycle of nodes, \nsuch\
    \ as routing schemes, energy consumption, and \ntransmission scheduling of periodic\
    \ and non-constant \ninformation, which in that context might provide \nimprovements.\
    \ In this sense, SDR, as the central \ndevice of the network, could implement\
    \ centralized \nrouting techniques based on SDN (Software Defined \nNetworking),\
    \ reducing the energy consumption and \nthe data traffic on the nodes [14].\n\
    C. Industrial automation\nIn the industrial field, WSNs support control and \n\
    production processes that are not critical, and \nmonitor environmental working\
    \ conditions such as \ntemperature, humidity, and the presence of someone \nin\
    \ a specific area to alert any undesirable situations \n[35]. WSNs monitor the\
    \ state of the machines to detect \nchanges in their operation, and allow to perform\
    \ a \ntimely preventive maintenance, as presented in \n[36], where non-invasive\
    \ vibrations were recorded \nin the motors, facilitating the detection of possible\
    \ \nparts failure that could be avoided by maintenance, \nand thus saving costs.\
    \ WSNs also allow product \ntracking within a production chain, distribution,\
    \ and \neven sales [37], by using passive UHF-RFID (Ultra \nHigh Frequency RFID)\
    \ labels inside large rolls of \npaper, which improves storage and distribution\
    \ in \nthe entire process within the production chain. The \nused communication\
    \ schemes generally work under \nwired TCP/IP schemes, however, wireless standards\
    \ \nsuch as WirelessHART and ISA100.11, based on \n802.15.4, have also been developed,\
    \ being these \nmore robust than ZigBee and 6LoWPAN [38].\nIn these environments,\
    \ electromagnetic interference \nis experienced due to the presence of motors,\
    \ welders \nand melting machines, and demanding conditions of \ntemperature, humidity\
    \ and vibrations that affect the \nquality of the signal. Therefore, the information\
    \ being \ntransmitted should not be sensitive to errors, delays, \nor to the Jitter\
    \ effect [39]. For this reason, WSNs are \nnot used as main elements in the monitoring\
    \ of the \nproduction process synchronicity. On the other hand, \naspects of quality\
    \ of service and information security \nare of vital importance without fault\
    \ tolerance, and in \nthis sense, SDR provides the tools to provide a high \n\
    level of QoS. Network maintenance schemes that \ndo not generate discontinuities\
    \ in production should \nbe taken into account. Node architectures must be \n\
    efficiently designed and implemented to meet these \nrequirements, keeping in\
    \ mind that there are limited \nresources in energy, memory, and processing [40].\
    \ \nFrom another point of view, the implementation \nof RFID technology within\
    \ the entire production \nchain begins to be an interesting solution within \n\
    the management of large inventories, allowing \ndeveloping more efficient schemes\
    \ in storage and \ndistribution of the products, representing savings in \npersonnel,\
    \ time, and money.\nD. Medical assistance systems\nSince the development of consumer\
    \ electronics, \na number of devices known as wearable have \nrecently appeared;\
    \ these devices integrate heart rate, \ntemperature, and accelerometer sensors\
    \ to identify \nthe type of activity performed by a person and their \nmost important\
    \ vital signs [41]. These systems have \nfunctionalities in the area of high-performance\
    \ sports \nand remote monitoring of patients with physical \nor cognitive limitations,\
    \ or of specific populations \nsuch as firefighters, blind people, infants [42],\
    \ and \n143\nRevista Facultad de Ingeniería (Rev. Fac. Ing.) Vol. 26 (45), pp.\
    \ 137-148. Mayo-Agosto, 2017. Tunja-Boyacá, Colombia.\nMiguel Ángel Sastoque-Caro\
    \ - Gustavo Adolfo Puerto-Leguizamón - Carlos Arturo Suárez-Fajardo\nthe elderly\
    \ [43]. For these applications, the ANT+ \nstandard has been developed, which\
    \ is neither \ncompatible with Bluetooth Smart nor 4.0, which are \nfrequently\
    \ used and characterized by having low \npower consumption and a low transmission\
    \ rate (1 \nMbps); both are available in smartphones, the first \none only in\
    \ some models [44].\nBecause these systems must be robust and the \ndevelopment\
    \ of standards is still recent, they may \nbe subject to modifications, as happened\
    \ with the \ninitial version of ANT+. However, this protocol is \nproprietary\
    \ and the information is not open to the \npublic. In this sense, it opens a door\
    \ to many new \napplications in sports and medicine. New scenarios \nof convergence\
    \ with other networks will appear in \naccordance with the dynamics of the market\
    \ and the \nintegration of these technologies with the user. In \nthe meantime,\
    \ the SDR perspective in this context \nis not entirely clear, but certainly,\
    \ its integration \nand interoperability, updating and adaptability \ncapabilities\
    \ could be useful in hospitals, gyms, and/\nor sports centers in in the near future.\n\
    E. Monitoring systems\nA monitoring system consists of a transducer \nelement\
    \ that converts the physical variables into \nelectrical signals that are sent\
    \ by a serial interface \nto a microprocessor with storage and communication \n\
    capacity to a central station. These systems allow \nmonitoring environmental\
    \ conditions at a lower \ncost than those based on specialized instruments. \n\
    Seismic warning systems have been developed \nnear volcanoes [45]. Microclimate\
    \ characterization \nsystems have also been developed in redwood trees \n[46]\
    \ and in marine environments, where ultrasonic \ncommunication and an optic system\
    \ for the \ntransmission of underwater images are implemented \n[47], or through\
    \ buoys where the ZigBee nodes are \nplaced while the sensors are adequately submerged\
    \ \n[48]. On the other hand, the use of monitoring \nsystems in environments of\
    \ smart grids is proposed. \nDecentralized systems of electric power generation\
    \ \nneed to record consumption and power generation \nlevels, and transmit them\
    \ in a timely manner to the \nenergy plants, detecting faults and abnormalities\
    \ in \nthe service delivery [49]. Some network schemes \nhave been proposed, taking\
    \ into account domotic \nnetworks as a basis for the integration of energy \n\
    monitoring systems with users, and facilitating user \ninterfaces already implemented\
    \ [50].\nNetwork schemes open the possibility of monitoring \nvery diverse environments,\
    \ many of them of difficult \naccess and with somewhat unfavorable conditions\
    \ \nfor wireless communication. They seek an efficient \nuse of energy consumption\
    \ so that the investment \nmade can be justified in the medium or long term. \n\
    New communication interfaces such as ultrasound \nand optics have arisen, providing\
    \ solutions for WSN, \nand at this point, SDR technology provides tools that \n\
    allow the communication system to be adapted in \nthe most efficient way to guarantee\
    \ communication \nin each particular environment. In some cases, \npriority must\
    \ be given to variables such as real-time \ntransmission, transmission rate, or\
    \ coverage. The \nSDR technology opens the possibility of adding \nnew interfaces\
    \ to the SDR devices by providing \nthem adaptability in the electromagnetic domain,\
    \ as \nproposed in [51], where the addition of an ultrasonic \ndomain to the equipment\
    \ is sought.\nF. Tracking systems\nThe recent appearance of autonomous vehicles\
    \ has \nbrought a series of technical problems and regulations \nthat are in the\
    \ process of being solved. It is of great \nimportance that these systems are\
    \ constantly reporting \ntheir status and position to prevent accidents. In \n\
    this sense, communication with other vehicles and \nwith static control elements\
    \ such as traffic signals \nis one of the aspects of greater attention, especially\
    \ \nwhen it comes to avoiding accidents that involve \nhuman lives. The scenario\
    \ of these communication \nsystems is more complex than other environments; \n\
    also, mobility aspects at speeds that can reach 120 \nkm/h, as well as the large\
    \ number of nodes within \nthe same area make unfeasible the implementation \n\
    of traditional standards like ZigBee or WiFi. For this \nreason, protocols such\
    \ as CALM (Communications \nAccess for Land Mobiles) and DSRC (Dedicated \nShort-Range\

    \ [52], and \nimprove multi-hop and hop-by hop transmissions \n[53]. In this field,\
    \ SDR technology is capable of \nproviding ad-hoc services in point-to-point or\

    \ network topologies, for \nexample, for buildings or traffic signals. Then, as\

    \ Defined Radio in network sensors\nflexible and heterogeneous platform, SDR could\
    \ be \nconsidered for applications in mobility services.\nIV. dIScuSSIon and analySIS\n\
    Currently, WSN is very dynamic in different \nfields. Memory and processing capabilities\
    \ have \nimproved, and will continue to do so, allowing \nhigh-level programming\
    \ libraries and languages  \nto be integrated, making independent the hardware\
    \ \nfrom the software. Open software tools such as \n“TinyOs” and “mbed” allow\
    \ users to develop \napplications more easily in shorter times, prompting \nthe\
    \ emergence of new applications for the WSN. The \ntendency is toward creating\
    \ heterogeneous WSNs \nthat have connectivity to the Internet, strengthening \n\
    the concept of “Internet of things”. Due to the \ndiversification of applications,\
    \ new standards have \nemerged to improve the performance of the WSN, \nparticularly\
    \ ANT+, Bluetooth 4.0, WirelessHART, \nCALM and DSRC. New application environments,\
    \ \nand thus new standards that seek to reduce signal \nfading, interference and\
    \ noise in the channel, \ncritical event timing, delays and the Jitter effect\
    \ \nproblem, autonomy of the devices, security, and \ncommunication reliability\
    \ will surely continue to \nemerge.\nOn the other hand, SDR development card costs\
    \ \nhave declined dramatically in recent years, making \nit affordable for academia\
    \ and businesses. Devices \nsuch as RTL-SDR ($20) have an interesting niche \n\
    market, and their integration with devices such as \nRabsberry Pi, for example,\
    \ contributes to increase \napplications in different areas of the WSN. The need\
    \ \nfor a central device within the network to manage \nand provide different\
    \ user interfaces allows the SDR \ndevices to extend the functionalities of the\
    \ network; \nfor example, these devices have the capabilities to \nimplement artificial\
    \ intelligence schemes to provide \nlearning features and automatic reconfiguration.\n\
    However, SDR should continue the process of \ncost reduction, as it has been doing\
    \ to increase its \ndeployment. It will also be necessary for these \nsystems\
    \ to integrate “On-the-air programming” \ntools, which allow device updates in\
    \ real-time. It \nwill also be important that these devices continue to \nimprove\
    \ in terms of processing capacity, so that more \ncomplex communication systems\
    \ such as those with \nFHSS (Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum) coding \ncan be\
    \ implemented. Additionally, there are some \nregulatory challenges, when commercially\
    \ using \nthis kind of devices to protect the unauthorized use \nof software,\
    \ also under the conditions of power and \nbandwidth according to the assigned\
    \ frequency, these \ndevices should not interfere with other equipment \n[10].\n\
    Some papers suggest the use of software-defined \nradio in applications of optimized\
    \ heterogeneous \nnetworks, such as medical care, body networks, \nenergy distribution\
    \ networks, and communication \nsystems for emergency care. This is according\
    \ to \nthe \nadaptability, \nconvergence, \ninteroperability, \nrobustness, and\
    \ scalability offered by the SDR. For \nexample, libraries have been developed\
    \ to use the \nphysical and link layer OQPSK-PHY and CSS-PHY \nworking in the\
    \ 2.4 GHz band of the 802.15.4 standard \nfor GNU radio [54, 55], and for Matlab\
    \ [56, 57]. A \nBTS (Base Transceiver Station) of cellular telephony \nin the\
    \ GSM bands of 800/900 MHz and 1800/1900 \nMHz has also been developed with the\
    \ tool OpenBT \n[58]. Similarly, in [59], a new architecture for the \nnodes is\
    \ proposed, integrating hardware that makes \nSDR integration possible. USRP1\
    \ development \nboards are used as the hub of a sensor network running \non 802.15.4\
    \ and GMSK, and the ADC modules of \nthe board are used to record the temperature\
    \ level.\nV. deVelopment toolS\nAmong GNU software tools, Radio Companion \nstands\
    \ out; it is open source, integrates Python and \nC++, and has the Universal Hardware\
    \ Driver (UHD) \nof a large number of devices capable of implementing \nSDR functionality;\
    \ its development was originated in \nLinux operating systems, and is being extended\
    \ to \nWindows environments. On the other hand, private \napplication development\
    \ tools like Matlab and \nLabView have less support and less compatibility \n\
    with different hardware tools. Moreover, different \nequipment that have the general\
    \ architecture of \nFigure 1 are available in the market. Table 1 presents \n\
    a comparison of the most important characteristics, \nwhere aspects such as the\
    \ bandwidth of the signal \nin baseband, transmission and/or reception features,\
    \ \nADC and DCA specifications, tuning frequency, and \ncost are described.\n\

    \ to mention that the shown signal \nbandwidth (BW) values refer to the use of\

    VI. concluSIonS\nIn this work, we described how the inclusion of the \nSDR concept\
    \ in wireless sensor networks can provide \nsolutions to the heterogeneous networks\
    \ concept in \ndifferent application environments, some of them \nfrequently used\
    \ and others still in early stages of \ndevelopment. In each one of these environments,\
    \ \nparticular \ncircumstances \nappear; \ntherefore, \ndepending on the application,\
    \ different modifications \nshould be performed to assure different levels of\
    \ \ncoverage, transfer rates, bandwidth and storage of \ninformation, levels of\
    \ security and communication \nreliability, energy dependency levels, as well\
    \ as \ncharacteristics such as the mobility of the nodes or \ntheir number. In\
    \ this context, traditional schemes \nfor sensor networks such as ZigBee or WiFi\
    \ have \nnot been flexible enough to meet all needs, so new \nstandards are beginning\
    \ to emerge to provide more \nefficient solutions in each case. This aspect has\
    \ \ncreated a scenario of heterogeneous networks with \nIPv6 compatibility, featuring\
    \ a growing number of \nnodes, and in this sense, the characteristics of SDR \n\
    can provide solutions to the designers of sensor \nnetworks. However, in order\
    \ for this paradigm to \ncompete with traditional developments, costs should \n\
    be reduced and more accessible tools should be \ndeveloped, while solving some\
    \ normative limitations.\nacknowledgement\nThe authors wish to acknowledge and\

    \ (F.J.O.)\nAbstract: Due to the edaphoclimatic conditions in southeast Spain,\
    \ which are expected to worsen\ndue to climate change, more efﬁcient ways of using\
    \ water must be found to maintain sustainable\nagriculture. Due to the current\
    \ high price of irrigation control systems in southern Europe, 60–80% of\nsoilless\
    \ crops are still irrigated, based on the experience of the grower or advisor.\
    \ The hypothesis\nof this work is that the development of a low-cost, high-performance\
    \ control system will allow\nsmall farmers to improve the efﬁciency of water use\
    \ by obtaining better control of soilless crops.\nThe objective of the present\
    \ study was to design and develop a cost-effective control system for the\noptimization\
    \ of soilless crop irrigation after evaluating the three most commonly used irrigation\n\
    control systems to determine the most efﬁcient. Based on the agronomic results\
    \ comparing these\nmethods, a prototype of a commercial smart gravimetric tray\
    \ was developed. The device records the\nirrigation and drainage volumes and drainage\
    \ pH and EC. It also offers the possibility of determining\nthe temperature, EC,\
    \ and humidity of the substrate. This new design is scalable thanks to the use\
    \ of\nan implemented data acquisition system called SDB and the development of\
    \ software in the Codesys\nprogramming environment based on function blocks and\
    \ variable structures. The reduced wiring\nachieved by the Modbus-RTU communication\
    \ protocols means the system is cost-effective even with\nmultiple control zones.\
    \ It is also compatible with any type of fertigation controller through external\n\
    activation. Its design and features solve the problems in similar systems available\
    \ on the market at an\naffordable cost. The idea is to allow farmers to increase\
    \ their productivity without having to make a\nlarge outlay. The impact of this\
    \ work will make it possible for small-scale farmers to have access to\naffordable,\
    \ state-of-the-art technology for soilless irrigation management leading to a\
    \ considerable\nimprovement in productivity.\nKeywords: soilless cultivation;\

    \ (FAO, Rome, Italy) estimates the world\npopulation to be 9.6 billion by 2050\
    \ [1]. The sustainability of irrigated agriculture in the\nsemi-arid Mediterranean\
    \ region is threatened by the overexploitation of natural resources\nand changes\
    \ in the use of agricultural land. Agriculture is the dominant water consumer\
    \ in\nthe region, accounting for 81% of the total water consumed, and is particularly\
    \ vulnerable\nto climate conditions due to its dependence for most of the year\
    \ on a plentiful supply\nof good-quality water [2]. Climate change is expected\
    \ to have a major impact on water\navailability and supply, infrastructures, and\
    \ farmers’ incomes; it also leads to reduced\nSensors 2023, 23, 3177. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23063177\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2023, 23, 3177\n2 of 25\nproduction\
    \ and increased food insecurity, with social and economic consequences involved,\n\
    such as higher levels of poverty and migration [3].\nPopulation growth, urban\
    \ development, and industrial progress will be difﬁcult to\nsustain without proper\
    \ support for agriculture, which consumes most of the world’s\navailable water\
    \ resources [4]. For example, in Europe [4], the United States [5], India [6],\n\
    Ethiopia, and South Africa [7], agriculture accounts for about 60% of the total\
    \ social\nwater consumption, more than 90% in some regions. Water-saving technologies\
    \ (WST) in\nagriculture, developed through technological development applied to\
    \ the management of\navailable water resources, are encouraged in many areas [8].\
    \ Although improved irrigation\nand water-saving practices have been adopted by\
    \ some growers, they have not been widely\nadopted since the growers do not beneﬁt\
    \ directly from saving water, and these systems\nare expensive. Studies show that\
    \ low adoption rates are an important factor in restricting\nthe effectiveness\
    \ of WST [9]. Increasing farmers’ WST adoption rates undoubtedly has\na positive\
    \ impact on increasing yields and income [10]. Saving water resources is also\n\
    conducive to improving the ecological environment and maintaining sustainable\
    \ economic\nand social development [4]. Mediterranean countries have been identiﬁed\
    \ globally as\nclimate change “hot spots” in which heat waves are expected to\
    \ increase by 200 to 500%\ndue to greenhouse gas emissions [11]. Indeed, irrigation\
    \ demands are relatively high,\nespecially in arid and semi-arid areas, due to\
    \ the high radiation load throughout the year,\nbut this is now also expected\
    \ to occur in more temperate and sub-tropical zones [12].\nTomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum\
    \ L.) are one of the most important crops worldwide [13] and\nare of great interest\
    \ to today’s society as they are a source of compounds with great health\nbeneﬁts\
    \ [14]. According to the FAO [15], Spain is the second-largest tomato producer\
    \ in\nEurope, with approximately 56,000 hectares under cultivation and a yield\
    \ of 85 t/ha.\nFarming land, soil, and water are the fundamental resources required\
    \ for conventional\nagriculture. The ﬁrst step towards the optimal use of these\
    \ resources is the incorporation of\nsoilless farming techniques [16]. With these\
    \ methods, plants can grow in an indoor envi-\nronment, reserving the land for\
    \ some other use. Soilless culture systems (SCS) in an almost\ncompletely controlled\
    \ environment constitute a relatively modern cultivation technology\nand are used\
    \ almost exclusively in greenhouses. Cultivation on horticultural growing\nmedia\
    \ (GM) such as rock wool, perlite, and coconut are the most frequently used SCS\
    \ for\nthe production of fruit, vegetables, and cut ﬂowers all over the world\
    \ [17]. Attempts have\nlong been made to eliminate the problems associated with\
    \ soil in greenhouses, including\nsoil-borne diseases, low soil fertility, and\
    \ high salt levels. Over the past 30–40 years, the\ndevelopment of suitable growing\
    \ media with optimal physical and chemical properties has\nled to soilless cultivation\
    \ in greenhouses taking a leading role. This development has also\nbeen favored\
    \ by advances in plant nutrition and irrigation through modern fertilization\n\
    approaches and automation [18].\nIn arid and semiarid regions, the demand for\
    \ water is constantly increasing as fresh-\nwater resources are being exhausted.\
    \ However, more water is needed to meet the future\ndemands of food production.\
    \ The best solution is thus to develop a water-saving man-\nagement technique\
    \ and/or move to adopt non-conventional sources of water for crop\nproduction.\
    \ The ideal solution would be to promote the use of marginal quality water,\n\
    especially saline water, for agricultural purposes [19].\nHowever, if saline water\
    \ is to be used on a large scale for crop irrigation, it must be\nbased on proper\
    \ irrigation management, and this is much more complicated than that of\nfreshwater\
    \ [20]. Many of the problems in irrigated soil can be controlled in soilless crops,\n\
    so there is considerable potential for employing saline water irrigation in soilless\
    \ media,\nparticularly for the production of vegetables [21]. Using saline water\
    \ for irrigation involves\na higher leaching fraction in soilless crops, which\
    \ affects plant nutrition and physiology [22].\nIrrigation systems should thus\
    \ consider the quality of water for irrigation management.\nDifferent irrigation\
    \ methods have been described [23], such as occasional irrigation,\npulse irrigation,\
    \ high-frequency irrigation, and continuous irrigation. These authors also\ndescribe\
    \ several approaches to making irrigation decisions: look-and-feel, gravimetric,\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 3177\n3 of 25\ntimer-based, sensor-based, and model-based methods.\
    \ In the current state of research on\nautomatic irrigation systems in soilless\
    \ crops, various systems can be found, many of them\ncommercial products already\
    \ in operation. Some irrigation scheduling methods are based\non the application\
    \ of a water balance and require an accurate estimation of the plants’ water\n\
    consumption. Crop evapotranspiration (ETc) can be estimated by indirect (climate-based)\n\
    methods or direct methods (using weighing or drainage lysimeters, balances, etc.)\
    \ [24].\nThe indirect methods of ETc calculation require climate sensors for radiation,\
    \ temperature,\nand humidity. Direct methods include gravimetric sensors [25],\
    \ measuring the moisture of\nthe substrate, using granular matrix sensors or capacitive\
    \ sensors [26], or measuring the\nwater potential or matrix voltage by tensiometers\
    \ or electro-tensiometers [27]. An optimally\ndesigned irrigation system will\
    \ deliver water to the plants to maximize water use efﬁciency\n(WUE) [23]. A detailed\
    \ review of the most representative irrigation methods for soilless\ncrops has\
    \ been performed [28].\nFor scheduling the irrigation of soilless crops, 60–80%\
    \ of the crops in Italy, France,\nPoland, Greece, and Hungary are irrigated based\
    \ on the experience of the grower and/or\nadvisor. Methods that either calculate\
    \ ETc or are based on incoming solar radiation are used\nin 60–95% of the crops\
    \ in The Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Portugal, and Belgium.\nDemand trays\
    \ are the predominant method in Spain [29]. Weighing balances are used in\n25%\
    \ of Dutch soilless crops. Soil/substrate moisture sensors (including tensiometers)\
    \ are\nused in 10–15% of soilless crops in Spain, Italy, The Netherlands, and\
    \ Portugal. These data\nshow that there is considerable room for improvement in\
    \ the irrigation management of\nsoilless vegetable crops [30].\nIn all irrigation\
    \ systems, decisions must be made about when to irrigate and for\nhow long. In\
    \ soilless growing systems, the irrigation process can last a few seconds or as\n\
    long as several minutes. Irrigation schemes are management strategies designed\
    \ to attain\nspeciﬁc crop production goals through various delivery and monitoring\
    \ methods. Optimal\nirrigation management is required to appreciably enhance water\
    \ productivity (or water use\nefﬁciency) for crops produced in greenhouses [31].\n\
    Agriculture 4.0 has been triggered by emerging technologies such as the Internet\
    \ of\nThings (IoT), artiﬁcial intelligence, data analytics, blockchain, big data,\
    \ etc. [32]. These tech-\nnologies address food safety-related issues, modernize\
    \ the agricultural supply chain [33],\nimprove data representation, storage, and\
    \ analysis, and provide better management\nand control.\nFinding a new way to\
    \ monitor single-plant water consumption is important to better\ndetermine how\
    \ much water should be provided to improve crop yield, quality, and so\non. Some\
    \ authors have explored the relationship between the daily irrigation applied\n\
    and melons’ daily weighted ET (WET) and then calculated the appropriate amounts\
    \ by\nweighing the plants [34]. A new, low-cost weighing lysimeter has been developed\
    \ for potted\nplants and its technical and economic evaluation in a 16-unit lysimetric\
    \ water consumption\nanalysis station [35].\nAfter studying the current state\
    \ of the art and the existing commercial systems, we\ndetected a market requirement\
    \ for a low-cost, scalable control system able to work together\nwith any type\
    \ of fertigation equipment. The systems currently available on the market are\n\
    considered expensive and require a large investment, so the technology is only\
    \ available to\nlarge-scale producers, leaving out the small farmer. As they can\
    \ only work with an irrigation\ncontroller of the same brand, the cost of expansion\
    \ to multiple zones skyrockets due to the\nsoftware and wiring required. The hypothesis\
    \ of this work is that the development of a\nlow-cost control system with high\
    \ performance will allow small farmers to improve the\nefﬁciency of water use\
    \ by obtaining better control of soilless crops. Therefore the aim of\nthis work\
    \ was to develop a low-cost system for self-managed irrigation of soilless crops\n\
    after selecting the most efﬁcient method of the three most representative irrigation\
    \ systems\nand considering the quality of the irrigation water.\nThe new system\
    \ is scalable and able to work with any of the fertigation controllers\ncurrently\
    \ on the market. The impact of this work will make it possible for small farmers\
    \ to\nSensors 2023, 23, 3177\n4 of 25\nhave access to affordable, cutting-edge\
    \ technology for soilless irrigation management with\nconsiderably improved productivity.\n\
    2. Materials and Methods\nThree irrigation control methods were compared in a\
    \ study to collect data for the\ndevelopment of an intelligent irrigation monitoring\
    \ and control system. Our aim was to\ndetermine the best sustainable system of\
    \ obtaining higher yields together with efﬁcient use\nof water.\n2.1. Agronomic\
    \ Trials\nThe experiment was carried out in a greenhouse in the experimental farm\
    \ “Tres\nCaminos” of the Centro de Edafología y Biología Aplicada del Segura (CEBAS)\
    \ in the munic-\nipality of Santomera (Murcia), whose coordinates are 38◦06′26.32′′\
    \ N and 1◦02′07.14.14′′ W\n(Figure A1).\nAgronomic trials were carried out with\
    \ the Sigfrid variety of tomatoes (Solanum\nlycopersicum) to evaluate three different\
    \ irrigation control systems for soilless crop produc-\ntion: Accumulated solar\
    \ radiation (AR); Gravimetry (G); and Volumetric Water Content\n(VWC) with two\
    \ types of water: Control (C, “Hoagland” Nutrient Solution); and Salinity (S,\n\
    “Hoagland” Nutrient Solution with 50 mM NaCl). The trials had a bifactorial design\
    \ (3 × 2)\nwith three irrigation methods combined factorially with two water qualities\
    \ in a random\nblock distribution. In each treatment, 4 culture bags were placed\
    \ per block, with 3 plants\neach, which made a total of 6 treatments and 24 plants\
    \ (replicates) per treatment. Planting\ndensity was 2.5 plants/m2. The drip irrigation\
    \ system consisted of a 2 L/h non-draining\nand self-compensating dripper per\
    \ plant. Treatments C-RA, C-G, and C-VWC were irri-\ngated from a single control\
    \ tank, and S-RA, S-G, and S-VWC from another tank containing\na saline solution.\
    \ The nutrient solution pH and EC were monitored, and drainage EC was\nmeasured\
    \ periodically. This distribution can be seen in Figure 1.\nThe 100 × 18 × 16\
    \ cm culture bags were made of cocopeat, and the cocopeat substrate\nhad the following\
    \ composition: organic material 92%, ash 8% m/mS, contraction <15% v/v,\ndry bulk\
    \ density 69 g/L, pH 5.5–6.5 and EC < 2.5 mS/cm.\n2.1.1. Analytical Data\nThe\
    \ plants were allowed to grow until production. Tomato fruits were harvested\n\
    daily when they turned red. The fresh weight and size of the individual tomatoes\
    \ were\ndetermined by the plant and treatment. The fruits were classiﬁed into\
    \ commercial and\nnon-commercial categories (small for weight less than 50 g or\
    \ having some physiopathology\nsuch as cracked or blossom-end-rot).\n2.1.2. Statistical\
    \ Analysis\nThe statistical analyses of production were carried out by two-way\
    \ ANOVA (SPSSv27\nStatistical Package, Chicago, IL, USA) with water quality and\
    \ irrigation methods as the\nmain factors, using a p = 0.05 probability cut-off\
    \ as the indicator of signiﬁcant differences.\nThe values signiﬁcantly different\
    \ at 95% were separated according to Duncan’s multiple\nrange test.\n2.2. Irrigation\

    \ a VWC\nSet Point and a stop above a set maximum VWC value.\n2.2.2. Radiation\
    \ (AR) Control System\nSolar radiation is the most important energy source for\
    \ a plant and a determining\nclimatic factor for crop development and yield. Low\
    \ radiation levels lower the chlorophyll\ncontent and reduce the plant’s photosynthetic\
    \ activity and photochemical concentration.\nSolar radiation determines the demand\
    \ for water vapor in the atmosphere and is, therefore,\na condition for the crop’s\
    \ irrigation needs. Irrigation is initiated when the energy set in\nWh/m2 is reached,\
    \ restarting the accumulated radiation counter (0 Wh/m2) and continuing\nuntil\
    \ the set point is reached again.\nThe Apogee SP-110 sensor pyranometer was used\
    \ in the AR-controlled areas. This\nhad a supply voltage of 12 Vdc, a sensitivity\
    \ of 0.20 mV per W·m−2, and an uncertainty\ncalibration of 5%. It was mounted\
    \ on a level horizontal surface and faced north to minimize\nSensors 2023, 23,\
    \ 3177\n7 of 25\nAzimuth error. The sensor was connected to a transmitter capable\
    \ of measuring the signal\nin a range of 0–250 mV. The input range was adjusted\
    \ to the pyranometer output range\nto maximize signal resolution and minimize\
    \ noise. The pyranometer can be used to ﬁnd\nthe instantaneous value of the solar\
    \ irradiance in W/m2 or by integration to ﬁnd the\ntotal energy per square meter,\
    \ which strikes the instrument during a given period. The\ncalibration factor\
    \ K can be expressed as follows:\nK = 200 mV/(kW/m2)\n(2)\nThis value means that\
    \ when the solar irradiance equals 1 kW/m2 (typical for a\nclear, sunny day around\
    \ noon), the pyranometer output voltage will be about 200 mV.\nIf the output voltage,\
    \ for example, is 100 mV, then the solar irradiance would be about\n0.5 kW/m2\
    \ = 500 W/m2. In other words:\nS[kW/m2] = U[mV]/K\n(3)\nwhere U is the signal\
    \ voltage in millivolts, and S is measured in kW/m2.\n2.2.3. Gravimetric Control\
    \ System\nFor the treatments controlled by the gravimetric method (G), 4 weighing\
    \ trays were\nplaced on the crop line, following the continuity of the channel.\
    \ The drainage from the\nweight trays was ﬁrst measured by the double bucket counter\
    \ equipped with a reed contact,\ndrained through the ﬁltered drains at the base\
    \ of the collector, and then fell into the channel\nto be counted by another counter\
    \ at the end of the line together with the drainage from the\nother three bags.\n\
    After the drainage has been completed, the weight variation of the tray deﬁnes\
    \ the\nplant’s water needs and, unlike the (VWC) and (AR) systems, is a direct\
    \ measure of the\nstate of the crop. When the weight variation is equivalent to\
    \ the volume consignment\nconsumed by the Tray System, a new irrigation cycle\
    \ will begin.\nFor the weight measurement, two traction load cells in each tray\
    \ converted the load\nacting on them into electrical signals proportional to the\
    \ weight. For maximum sensi-\ntivity and temperature compensation, two strain\
    \ gauges under tension and two under\ncompression were connected to a Wheatstone\
    \ bridge.\nKnowing the power supply voltage, the force value was quantiﬁed by\
    \ connecting both\nload cell outputs to a box with the 4–20 mA signal conditioning\
    \ and transmission circuit.\nSince the output voltage in each load cell is proportional\
    \ to the variation of the resistances\nin the Wheatstone bridge, and this, in\
    \ turn, is proportional to the linear variation of the\nweight on the platform,\
    \ a 4–20 mA output signal with linear variation with respect to the\nweight on\
    \ the tray is obtained.\nAll the load cells receive the same power supply, and\
    \ when they are “unbalanced” by\nthe effect of the weight of the product, each\
    \ one supplies the same mV signal. Since the\ncells are in parallel, the end result\
    \ is the mV signal. The tray was aligned so that the same\nweight was supported\
    \ by each of the “S” type load cells, in this case, 40 kg, so the weighing\nsystem\
    \ can support 80 kg, including the dead weight (tray where the load is placed)\
    \ and\nthe maximum weight of the load. An ampliﬁer was used to condition the output\
    \ of the\nload cells.\nIt is very important to calculate the error measurement\
    \ for system validation. To\ndo this, the linearity error of the load cell was\
    \ taken into account, which is expressed as\na percentage of span (FS), or the\
    \ difference between the upper and lower measurement\nlimits, and which, in this\
    \ case, has a value of 0.03% FS. To calculate the error of the analog\nconditioning\
    \ system, the “Accuracy” value offered by the transmitter’s table of technical\n\
    parameters was used and was 0.3% FS (Span). By adding both errors, it was possible\

    \ the same power supply, and when they are “unbalanced” by \nthe effect of the\
    \ weight of the product, each one supplies the same mV signal. Since the cells\
    \ \nare in parallel, the end result is the mV signal. The tray was aligned so\
    \ that the same weight \nwas supported by each of the “S” type load cells, in\
    \ this case, 40 kg, so the weighing system \ncan support 80 kg, including the\
    \ dead weight (tray where the load is placed) and the maxi-\nmum weight of the\
    \ load. An amplifier was used to condition the output of the load cells. \nIt\
    \ is very important to calculate the error measurement for system validation.\
    \ To do \nthis, the linearity error of the load cell was taken into account, which\
    \ is expressed as a per-\ncentage of span (FS), or the difference between the\
    \ upper and lower measurement limits, \nand which, in this case, has a value of\
    \ 0.03% FS. To calculate the error of the analog condi-\ntioning system, the “Accuracy”\
    \ value offered by the transmitter’s table of technical param-\neters was used\
    \ and was 0.3% FS (Span). By adding both errors, it was possible to calculate\
    \ \nthe total error, both in the most unfavorable case ƐTMD, and in the most likely\
    \ ƐTMP: \nƐTMD = Ɛlin + ƐRW−ST01A = 0.03 + 0.3 = 0.33%FS \n(4)\nƐ்ெ௉ = ටƐ௟௜௡\n\
    ଶ + Ɛோௐିௌ்଴ଵ஺\nଶ = 0.30%FS \n(5)\nThe transmitter was found to be correctly set\
    \ to calculate the error by using known \nweights. For this, zero (4 mA) was obtained\
    \ by disregarding the dead weight of the tray, \nand the Span (20 mA) 80 kg was\
    \ considered. Checks were then carried out by taking ten \nmeasures with known\
    \ weights in ascending order and ten in descending order. \nThe actual results\
    \ obtained were consistent with the theoretical ones, and the errors \nobtained\
    \ were admissible. A sensitivity test was also carried out in which it was found\
    \ that \nthe weight measurement system, consisting of a load cell and transmitter,\
    \ was capable of \ndetecting weight increases of 5 gr. As we approached the upper\
    \ range limit, the minimum \ndetectable weight increases was 10 gr. These results\
    \ were also admissible. To eliminate noise \nat the output, twisted and shielded\
    \ pairs were used to transmit the signal (Table 1). \nTable 1. Weight average\

    \ two types of water and three systems for monitoring the crop\nwater status (gravimetric,\
    \ accumulated radiation, and volumetric water content sensor).\nDifferent agronomic\
    \ parameters were determined to validate both the calculation systems\nand the\
    \ accuracy of the measurement systems. Under the control conditions, the irrigation\n\
    method signiﬁcantly affected the yield, the gravimetric method being the one that\
    \ obtained\nthe greatest commercial yield. The other two methods used obtained\
    \ the same production,\nSensors 2023, 23, 3177\n10 of 25\nbelow the gravimetric\
    \ method. This difference in production could be explained by the\ngravimetric\
    \ method being adjusted more precisely to the plants’ water needs.\nThe impact\
    \ of different irrigation methods could be related to the water availability\n\
    in the tomato plants’ different phenological stages [36]. According to [37], increasing\
    \ soil\nmoisture during the last three stages (fruit growth, FG; fruit development,\
    \ FD; and fruit\nmaturity, FM) could signiﬁcantly increase tomato yield. Excessive\
    \ and insufﬁcient soil\nmoisture during the fruit setting (FS) stage had negative\
    \ effects on tomato yield. The\ncommercial tomato yield is signiﬁcantly reduced\
    \ by water deﬁciency during ﬂowering\nand/or yield formation phases [38]. Under\
    \ saline conditions, the irrigation method also\nsigniﬁcantly affects the commercial\
    \ yield. As can be seen in Figure 5, salinity drastically\nreduced the commercial\
    \ tomato plant yield by 68%.\nSensors 2023, 23, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n11 of 25 \n\

    \ of the three under study was the gravimetric method in terms of yield. According\n\
    to the good results, the gravimetric method seems to be the best adapted to the\

    \ the method that improved\nthe availability of water of the substrate in relation\
    \ to the plants’ water needs. When\nthe irrigation method was VWC, the production\

    \ due to possibly imprecise measurements on\nsome occasions, as well as some failures\
    \ detected in the sensor measurements of the sensors\nthroughout the crop cycle.\
    \ With the accumulated radiation method, the commercial yield\nresults were similar\
    \ to those of the VWC method, which was not successful because the\nplants continued\

    \ Gravimetric Control System\nFrom the data obtained during the tests, it can\
    \ be concluded that gravimetric control is\nthe most efﬁcient method of improving\
    \ crop yield. For this, a more affordable commercial\nprototype smart tray was\
    \ developed with numerous improvements over the current com-\nmercial systems\
    \ as regards both hardware and software, thanks to the experience gained\nduring\
    \ the agronomic trials.\n3.2.1. General Architecture of the Gravimetric Control\
    \ System\nTo reduce costs and create highly competitive equipment, we decided\
    \ to work with\na Schneider PLC of the 241 series, model TM241CE24T/U, in the\
    \ Codesys programming\nenvironment. The main reason for changing the PLC model\
    \ was the possibility of digital\ncommunication via the Modbus RTU protocol without\
    \ incurring any additional costs.\nIn this development, the PLC communicates through\
    \ a switch with an HDMI screen\nand through the Modbus RTU protocol with a data\
    \ acquisition card that will collect infor-\nmation from all the sensors in the\
    \ control zones. This reduces wiring costs and simpliﬁes\nassembly, as it is no\
    \ longer necessary to send individual signals to the control panel, as\nwhen using\
    \ 4–20 mA signals.\nA 7′′ Weintek MT807oiE HMI screen was chosen instead of the\
    \ PC-based SCADA\nsystem due to its features and low price and for the following\
    \ reasons:\n-\nIt provides remote access to the program and to data, graphs, and\
    \ historical data and\ncan download data, which requires a license at a very low\
    \ cost.\n-\nIt can even act as a gateway to access the PLC programming itself\
    \ and even modify it\nif necessary.\nAs depicted in (Figure 8), in this case,\
    \ the control equipment can give an activation\norder to any of the currently\
    \ available fertigation devices through an operations panel,\nwhich can be any\
    \ type of device (mobile, PC, tablet) with an internet connection.\n3.2.2. Improvements\
    \ in Electronic Instrumentation and Communication\nTensile load cells were used\
    \ for the tests. This presented a structural problem as\nthe cell supports interfered\
    \ with the plant support, so torsion load cells were used in the\ncommercial model.\n\
    Another common problem that arose during the tests in equipment with low ﬂow\n\
    meters was related to the magnetized double spoon counters with reed contacts\
    \ to measure\nthe drainage volume. Other systems of pot cultivation use a conduit\
    \ crossing the platform\nconnected to a spherical PVC drainage tank. This container\
    \ was suspended from another\nloadcell which weighed it and the water it contained.\
    \ Once the tank was full, two electro-\nvalves (one connected to the input and\
    \ the other to the output) took over to open or close\nthe tank in such a way\
    \ that no drainage water was lost in the process [35]. Ref. [45] used\nload cells\
    \ for direct estimation of irrigation and drainage water in soilless systems.\
    \ As cited\nin [46], measurement systems range from weighing the lysimeter measuring\
    \ output every\n10 min to calculating a 60 min average of 1 min measurements,\
    \ although the expense of\nthese systems limits their use to research on plants\
    \ grown in containers.\nA reed relay has a mechanical switching capacity of millions\
    \ of operations; its service\nlife is conditioned by its load, which can be a\
    \ maximum of a few tens of mA with a\nmaximum voltage of tens of volts. The fact\
    \ that it was installed switching a 24 Vac relay\nwith no RC in either the relay\
    \ coil or the reed relay itself may have been the cause of the\nproblems. Although\

    \ 3177\n17 of 25\nAll these tests were monitored by a digital oscilloscope with\
    \ the probe applied to the\nload so that the signals were recorded. The following\
    \ events were observed:\n•\nVoltage peaks of hundreds of volts at the 24 Vdc relay\
    \ without a protective circuit.\n•\nPeaks were reduced when RC protective circuits\
    \ were used.\n•\nNegligible overvoltage with the 24 Vdc + 1N4007.\n•\nThe SCE-CCHR1\
    \ with a 24 Vdc + 1N4007 relay load or digital input of the SDB1 gave\nsignals\
    \ with no overvoltage.\nPulses with a period of 350 ms and a width of 80 ms were\
    \ measured in real conditions,\nboth with the reed sensor and with the Hall effect\
    \ sensor, equivalent to about 3 pulses\nper second. Then, 5ms pulses were applied\
    \ with the tester every 10 ms, corresponding to\n100 pulses per second. Under\
    \ these conditions, the reed relay was not able to respond at\nthis speed, but\
    \ the Hall effect relay was, with millions of pulses being applied to the Hall\n\
    effect relay during the tests.\nAnother disadvantage found during the tests was\
    \ that the large number of sensors\nmeant that complex wiring was necessary, which\
    \ entailed a high cost in terms of electrical\nwiring and assembly. Other developments\
    \ have opted for dataloggers with multiplexers to\nincrease the number of input\
    \ channels [35]. Artiﬁcial neural networks have been applied\nin agricultural\
    \ systems mainly for open ﬁeld cultivation to estimate soil moisture content\n\
    based on various soil and environmental parameters and also for irrigation planning\
    \ [47].\nThis complex wiring and cabling have a high economic impact when the\
    \ tray is at\nsome distance from the service area and/or when there is more than\
    \ one control zone. To\nreduce costs and make the system scalable, a data acquisition\
    \ board, called the SDB (Tray\nSystem), was designed (Figure A2). This SDB includes\
    \ the load cell transmitter, the pH, and\nthe EC drainage transmitter, which is\
    \ able to read several substrate sensors simultaneously\nwith the SDI-12 protocol\
    \ and also receives signals from the irrigation and drainage meters.\nCommunication\
    \ between the SDB and the controller is via Modbus RS-485 RTU with only\nfour\
    \ wires.\nIf the installation has more than one control zone, it will be possible\
    \ to work with\na parallel connection by means of the Modbus-RTU protocol. This\
    \ will guarantee the\nscalability of the equipment and make it possible to increase\
    \ the number of control zones\nin an installation at a reduced cost.\nSince the\
    \ control panel is in the service area and the SDB in the greenhouse, to simplify\n\
    sensor calibration, the option of using a mobile application via Bluetooth connection\
    \ is\noffered, which can also be used to update the software if necessary.\nWhen\
    \ communicating with more than one SDB, termination resistors must be used\nthat\
    \ reduce the sensitivity to electrical noise, with a termination resistance equal\
    \ to the\ncharacteristic impedance of the cable (normally 120 Ω for twisted pairs).\n\
    3.2.3. Control System\nIn order to create scalable equipment, in addition to using\
    \ SDB modules with Modbus-\nRTU connection, programming was carried out in the\
    \ Codesys environment using function\nblocks and variable structures (Figure A3).\n\
    The equipment can thus be adapted to the needs of the individual installation,\
    \ as\nthe modular structure of the programming makes it easy to expand the software\
    \ from\none control zone to as many as necessary. As in the test control system,\
    \ the intuitive and\nvisual Ladder language was chosen for programming. For the\
    \ screen, we opted for an HMI\ncontrol panel as it has practically all the possibilities\
    \ of a SCADA system, such as:\n•\nVisualizing the information and monitoring the\
    \ processes running in the machine in\nreal-time. As shown in (Figure A4), it\
    \ is possible to record the values of the irrigation\nand drainage volumes, the\
    \ weight of the tray, and its drainage percentage, as well as\nthe irrigation\
    \ time and the values provided by each of the sensors.\n•\nEntering the information\
    \ needed to operate, select recipes, display indicators, etc.\n•\nDisplay and\
    \ control instruments and mechanisms. In this case, the number of plants\nand\

    \ the data obtained during the agronomic tests, it can be concluded that the best\
    \ \ncontrol system of the three under study was the gravimetric method in terms\
    \ of yield. \nJudging by the good results, the gravimetric method seems to be\
    \ the best adapted to co-\ncopeat substrate irrigation management since it was\
    \ the method that was found to im-\nprove the availability of water in the substrate\
    \ in relation to the pants’ watering needs. \nAfter selecting the method with\
    \ the best agronomic performance, we developed a com-\npetitive, cost-effective\
    \ automatic gravimetric control system based on the experience \ngained during\
    \ the field trials of the first prototype. This new system had a significant cost\
    \ \nreduction of around 50% less than the current leading commercial systems.\
    \ It is also scal-\nable, can be remotely controlled, receives software updates,\
    \ and provides access to all the \nirrigation data. This new design is compatible\
    \ with any current fertigation controller \nthrough the use of external activations\
    \ and shutdowns, unlike the costly equipment on \nthe market, which requires a\
    \ controller of the same brand. The two factors of price and \ncompatibility put\
    \ this control equipment within reach of small producers, who can in-\ncrease\
    \ their production significantly for a small investment. \nValuable know-how was\
    \ gained from experience obtained during the trials to design \ngravimetric commercial\
    \ irrigation control equipment. Although traction load cells were \nused in the\
    \ tests, it was found that their supports interfered with the plant trellises,\
    \ so it \nwas decided to opt for torsion load cells, which do not interfere with\
    \ the plant. The tray \nis also aligned with the cultivation line for minimal\
    \ visual impact. Another problem that \narose during the tests was that the contact\
    \ counters used became magnetized and stopped \ncounting the pulses, which interfered\
    \ with the control system. A new non-magnetizing \nHall-effect sensor was thus\
    \ developed for flow meters that can withstand an unlimited \nnumber of operations,\
    \ replacing the reed contacts in the double-bucket meters for a slight \ncost\
    \ increase. These meters did not become magnetized during the tests, while the\
    \ error \nwas in no case greater than 5%. \nThe SDB data acquisition card was\
    \ developed to receive all the signals from the mul-\ntiple sensors to reduce\
    \ wiring and minimize assembly times. This data acquisition system \ndeveloped\
    \ for the weighing control system, in addition to receiving information from the\
    \ \npH and EC drainage sensors, the load cells, and the irrigation and drainage\
    \ meters is able \nto communicate by the SDI-12 communication protocol with several\
    \ substrate sensors. \nThese sensors provide information on temperature, volumetric\
    \ water content, and the \nFigure 13. (a) Weighing tray with torsion load cells\

    \ under study was the gravimetric method in terms of\nyield. Judging by the good\

    \ replacing the reed contacts in the double-bucket meters for a slight\ncost increase.\
    \ These meters did not become magnetized during the tests, while the error\nwas\
    \ in no case greater than 5%.\nThe SDB data acquisition card was developed to\
    \ receive all the signals from the\nmultiple sensors to reduce wiring and minimize\
    \ assembly times. This data acquisition\nsystem developed for the weighing control\
    \ system, in addition to receiving information\nfrom the pH and EC drainage sensors,\
    \ the load cells, and the irrigation and drainage meters\nis able to communicate\
    \ by the SDI-12 communication protocol with several substrate\nsensors. These\
    \ sensors provide information on temperature, volumetric water content,\nSensors\
    \ 2023, 23, 3177\n20 of 25\nand the crop EC, which is obtained by a correlation\
    \ according to the crop in question. The\ninformation obtained by the SDB is sent\
    \ via Modbus-RTU protocol to the PLC. A PLC\nworking in the Codesys environment\
    \ was chosen to enable the use of standard Modbus-\nRTU communication protocols.\
    \ Thanks to the SDB, this equipment is scalable because\nparallel communication\
    \ can be made with a PLC via Modbus-RTU, allowing a large number\nof trays to\
    \ be networked, considerably reducing the wiring requirements and labor costs\n\
    and facilitating future expansion. The SDB communication sensors can be calibrated\
    \ via\nan APP on a mobile phone. This is a signiﬁcant improvement over other equipment\n\
    currently available on the market, as the sensors can be calibrated via Bluetooth\
    \ in direct\ncommunication with the SDB data acquisition system. A single operator\
    \ can thus remotely\ncalibrate the sensors in a tray hundreds of meters away from\
    \ the service area with the main\ncontrol panel.\nAn HMI display was chosen, which\
    \ offers the same features as an expensive SCADA\nsystem, with the possibility\
    \ of remote control, and which does not charge according\nto the number of variables\
    \ used. This HMI interface will also serve to access the PLC\nprogramming. Communication\
    \ between data acquisition cards and PLC via radio is\nforeseen in future developments,\
    \ which will eliminate the need for wiring. The fact that\nthe software works\
    \ in the Codesys environment, based on function blocks and variable\nstructures,\
    \ means the equipment’s control zones can be increased almost automatically.\n\
    It should be noted that remote access is available to the programming parameters,\
    \ to all\nthe irrigation data, and to remote graphics. These features make this\
    \ new equipment an\naffordable and efﬁcient irrigation control system for soilless\
    \ crops, with improved crop\nyields and savings in water and fertilizers, making\
    \ it possible for small-scale farmers to\nobtain a huge improvement in productivity.\
    \ In the next steps, we expect to increase the\ncomplexity of the control so that\
    \ other parameters, such as drainage EC or the daily light\nintegral (DLI), are\
    \ taken into account without incurring system cost increases.\nFinally, it should\
    \ be noted that this control system has been thoroughly tested, both\nin the laboratory\
    \ and in the test facility itself, and has recently been put on the market\nwith\
    \ encouraging results while further trials are being conducted to determine how\
    \ well a\nweighing tray represents the conditions in a given area.\nAuthor Contributions:\

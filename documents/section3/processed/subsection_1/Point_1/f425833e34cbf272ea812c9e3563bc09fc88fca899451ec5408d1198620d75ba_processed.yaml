    \ (AI)\n1. Introduction\nPrecision agriculture (PA) is a management strategy for\
    \ addressing geographical\nand temporal variabilities in agricultural ﬁelds [1–3]\
    \ that involves data and contempo-\nrary technologies. With a forecasted human\
    \ population of between 9 and 10 billion by\n2050 [3–5], precision agriculture\
    \ is becoming more and more important to contemporary\nagricultural research.\
    \ By 2050, the amount of food produced worldwide must grow by at\nleast 70% [1,5–7].\
    \ This is a difﬁcult endeavor [4] because it puts further strain on already-\n\
    scarce resources and the environment [1–3]. Therefore, precision agriculture is\
    \ essential\nto maximize output while using fewer inputs of all sorts in more\
    \ effective ways, reducing\nadverse impacts on the environment, and assuring sustainability\
    \ [2,3]. Precision farming\nwas born with the introduction of GPSs (global positioning\
    \ systems), GISs (geographic in-\nformation systems), yield monitors, and other\
    \ data generators in all three crucial phases of\nagricultural operations in the\
    \ 1990s [2,8,9]. In precision agriculture, motorized equipment\nwas only used\
    \ for performing agricultural processes [2,10], and the problem-recognizing\n\
    and decision-making steps were authorized by humans. The technological advancement\n\
    during the Third Industrial Revolution, known as Industry 3.0 [8], led precision\
    \ agriculture\nto digitalization by integrating information technologies and improved\
    \ automation capa-\nbilities in precision farming. As a result of this digitalization,\
    \ “farm practices” with manual\ntools moved to “agriculture” from animal traction,\
    \ then to motorized mechanization, and\nnow to digital equipment [2].\nPrecision\
    \ agriculture so far mainly consists of variable rate technologies (VRTs), elec-\n\
    tronic maps, yield monitors, and guidance farming systems [2,8]. Variable rate\
    \ applications\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture13081593\n\

    were ﬁrstly demonstrated in northern Germany and Denmark in 1988 after global\
    \ posi-\ntioning systems (GPSs) were available for civil services [11]. GPS services\
    \ were opened\nfor general use in U.S. farms in 1983 [2]. In the next decade,\
    \ GPS technology facilitated\nfarmers to precisely locate and map their ﬁelds\
    \ [10,12], empowering them to manage their\nfarmlands according to site-speciﬁc\
    \ conditions and ﬁeld variabilities. At the beginning\nof the second millennium,\
    \ yield monitors were developed, enabling farmers to monitor\ncrop yield in real-time\
    \ via best matching [13]. Advancement of remote-sensing technology,\nsuch as satellites,\
    \ drones, ground-based sensors, and crews, authorized farmers to collect\nhigh-resolution\
    \ data on their ﬁelds, allowing them to make informed decisions about\ncrop management\
    \ [3]. Precision agriculture is not only focused on crop farming but also\non\
    \ other agricultural production systems: agronomics, livestock farming, aquaculture,\n\
    and agroforestry [2,3,9,14].\nIn the current status of precision agriculture,\
    \ there are several issues, such as un-\nsustainable resource utilization, long-term\
    \ monoculture, intensive animal farming [8],\nenvironmental compromises, uneven\
    \ distribution of digitization [15], food safety issues,\ninefﬁcient agri-food\
    \ supply chain [13,16], and lack of awareness of and inertia toward novel\nchanges.\
    \ These issues prevent achieving efﬁciency, productivity, and sustainability from\n\
    agricultural production and escalate unintended impacts on ecosystems [17]. The\
    \ fourth\nindustrial revolution, which is known as Industry 4.0, occurred in 2011\
    \ with the Internet of\nThings (IoT), big data, artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), robotics,\
    \ and blockchain technology [8,18].\nIn 2017, these advanced technologies were\
    \ integrated into agriculture in order to over-\ncome the above-mentioned issues,\
    \ transforming precision agriculture to Agriculture 4.0,\nor smart farming [8,16].\
    \ With this transition, there is a growing focus on sustainability\nin agriculture,\
    \ with many farmers adopting precision agricultural technologies to reduce\nthe\
    \ environmental impacts of farming and promote long-term sustainability. As a\
    \ result,\nagricultural-manufacturing processes and supply chains have become\
    \ more autonomous\nand intelligent [18], including the automation of various tasks\
    \ such as planting, seeding,\nharvesting, and soil sampling. This is making farming\
    \ more efﬁcient while reducing\nlabor costs.\nSmart agriculture is an evolving\
    \ ﬁeld that leverages technological innovations to\ntransform traditional farming\
    \ practices. The integration of digital technologies into agricul-\nture has opened\
    \ up new opportunities and possibilities, revolutionizing the way farmers\nmanage\
    \ their crops, resources, and operations. It is a rapidly evolving ﬁeld that encom-\n\
    passes a wide array of approaches, applications, and impacts. The broader objective\
    \ of\nthis review is to delve into the essential aspects of precision agriculture,\
    \ exploring its key\ncomponents and highlighting its potential for sustainable\
    \ farming practices. One of the\ncritical aspects of precision agriculture is\
    \ data collection and acquisition planning, which\nplays a fundamental role in\
    \ optimizing farm management decisions. Through efﬁcient data\ngathering, farmers\
    \ can make informed choices regarding crop health, resource allocation,\nand yield\
    \ optimization. Decision making and execution are also vital components of preci-\n\
    sion agriculture, where the integration of cutting-edge technologies is pivotal.\
    \ Leveraging\nmachine vision technology, the Internet of Things (IoT), and artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence (AI) can\nlead to enhanced precision and efﬁciency in agricultural\
    \ processes, beneﬁting both farmers\nand the environment. Throughout this review,\
    \ successful precision agriculture proposals\nand real-world implementations are\
    \ analyzed to gain insights into their achievements and\nchallenges. By identifying\
    \ future developments required in precision agriculture, we aim\nto provide a\
    \ comprehensive understanding of how this ﬁeld can continually evolve to\nsupport\
    \ sustainable farming practices and address global food security challenges. The\n\
    amalgamation of scientiﬁc research and technological innovations holds great promise\
    \ for\nthe future of precision agriculture and its positive impact on agriculture\
    \ and society as\na whole.\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n3 of 26\n2. Precision\
    \ Agriculture Approaches, Applications, and Impacts\nPrecision agriculture involves\
    \ data-driven management decisions that improve re-\nsource use efﬁciency, resulting\
    \ in reduced agricultural costs while lowering the environ-\nmental impacts from\
    \ agriculture [19]. Hence, data and data collection systems, decision\nsupport\
    \ tools, and data-driven equipment and input adjustments are major components\n\
    of precision agriculture [2], engaging in three key agricultural steps: diagnosis,\
    \ decision\nmaking, and performing [20], respectively. Before the integration\
    \ of smart technologies,\nICT (information and communication technology) was incorporated\
    \ into agricultural de-\nvices and machinery to capture real data. Here, remote\
    \ sensing, automated hardware and\nsoftware, telematics, drones, autonomous vehicles,\
    \ GPSs, and robotic technologies were\nincorporated into agricultural practices.\
    \ As an example, the agro-tech company John Deere\nintroduced GPSs for tractors,\
    \ expecting increased yield and decreased input wastage [19].\nThe previous status\
    \ of precision agriculture before smart farming can be summarized\nas follows.\n\
    2.1. Data Collection and Acquisition\nData, data collection, and decision support\
    \ tools are important for the identiﬁcation\nand diagnosis of various aspects\
    \ in agriculture. In precision agriculture, data on individual\nﬁelds and crops\
    \ are gathered by observing, measuring, and sensing with different kinds of\n\
    sensors, yield and soil monitors, and remote-sensing tools, such as imaging from\
    \ drones,\ncrews, aircraft, or satellites [1–3,13]. Thus, “sensing” is a fundamental\
    \ management tool\nof precision agriculture [3,13], which is observing detailed\
    \ information and providing\ndata on climate conditions, soil conditions, fertilizer\
    \ requirements, water availability, pest\nand disease stresses, and other ﬁeld\
    \ parameters [3]. A range of sensors are used in preci-\nsion agriculture. Biomass\
    \ parameters are important in making decisions to monitor the\nfertilization and\
    \ caring for crops. Sensors for mass ﬂow and moisture content are com-\nponents\
    \ of yield monitors, together with a differential global positioning system (DGPS)\n\
    receiver. Properly calibrated yield monitors can generate accurate real-time information\
    \ for\ndecision making, such as underperforming areas leading to site-speciﬁc\
    \ crop fertilization\ndesigns [13]. Precision livestock farming uses sensors and\
    \ monitoring technology to collect\ndata on animal health and welfare, enabling\
    \ farmers to make informed decisions about\nfeed, waste, and other inputs with\
    \ improved efﬁciency and productivity. Colter position\nsensors combined with\
    \ ultrasonic soil surface sensors are employed in dynamic Colter\ndepth control\
    \ systems [3].\nRemote-sensing technologies, such as drones, crews, aircraft,\
    \ satellites, and other\nground-based sensors, are used to collect data on crops\
    \ and soil conditions [2,3]. Remote\nsensing supports the identiﬁcation of spatial\
    \ patterns of signatures of plants that are co-\nincidental with soil characteristics,\
    \ as well as pest or disease stresses [11]. Imagery is one\nkind of remote-sensing\
    \ data that can reveal ground truthing [2,3,11]. Previously, aircraft\nhave been\
    \ used not only for many farming imagery operations that generate data, but also\n\
    chemical- or fertilizer-spraying activities. Moreover, satellite images have been\
    \ available for\nfarm management for many years. As an example, the US-LANDSAT\
    \ satellites were avail-\nable for this purpose in 1970 [2]. Unmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ (UAVs) equipped with global\nnavigation satellite system (GNSS) technology have\
    \ been recently employed for mapping,\ngathering imagery data, land surveying,\
    \ crop spraying, and livestock monitoring [2,3].\nGeocoded sampling is a requisite\
    \ component of precision agriculture and ground truthing\nwhen spatial images\
    \ are used for decision making [11]. Real-time and cost-effective remote\nsensing,\
    \ such as LASSIE (low-altitude stationary surveillance instrumental equipment),\n\
    are crucial in precision agriculture, as it enables continuous and automatic recoding\
    \ of\nreal-time images of crops and soil with GIS reference [11]. This information\
    \ can be used to\nmake informed decisions about crop management resource allocation\
    \ [3].\nSensor data and other data associated with geospatial coordinates from\
    \ a global\nnavigation satellite system (GNSS) provide information to create maps,\
    \ especially yield\nmaps and soil maps for site-speciﬁc management decisions [2,3].\
    \ Yield maps are used\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n4 of 26\nto characterize ﬁeld\
    \ production quantitatively and qualitatively [21], which is crucial\nto make\
    \ management decisions. Analyzing variabilities depicted on maps enables the\n\
    identiﬁcation of factors that inﬂuence productivity, facilitating the implementation\
    \ of site-\nspeciﬁc ﬁeld management strategies [3]. Soil maps offer valuable insights\
    \ into the spatial\ndistribution of the physical and chemical properties within\
    \ a given ﬁeld [21], serving as\nindispensable decision-making tools in precision\
    \ agriculture [13]. This signiﬁcance stems\nfrom the fact that soil’s physical\
    \ and chemical characteristics, such as water availability,\nnutrient-holding\
    \ capacity, bulk density, porosity, nutrient availability, and topography,\ntypically\
    \ exert an inﬂuence on crop yield [21]. Weather and climate trends can also be\n\
    predicted using sensor data, which are important in all farming practices. Harvesting\
    \ time\nis an affecting factor of grain loss in paddy rice farming, which is also\
    \ able to be monitored\nwith data observation [1].\n2.2. Planning, Decision Making,\
    \ and Execution\nAfter creating decisions by analyzing gathered information, actions\
    \ are performed\naccording to the decisions created using data-driven equipment.\
    \ Most ﬁelds are not\nhomogenous in terms of soil and climate properties, as well\
    \ as diseases [22]. Conventional\nagriculture did not take this into account;\
    \ therefore, rigorous use of limited resources and\nexcess use of chemicals and\
    \ synthetic fertilizers resulted in unsustainable conventional\nagricultural practices.\
    \ This also drove lots of wastage, even in the amounts of resource\ninputs and\
    \ yield. Nonetheless, precision agriculture itself has proved that the application\n\
    of technologies to manage the spatial and temporal variabilities in agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds is\npossible to improve performance and environmental quality [9]. Variable\
    \ rate technologies\nin precision agriculture involve applying inputs such as\
    \ fertilizers, water and seeds, and\ncrop protection chemicals (pesticides and\
    \ weedicides) at varying rates, depending on the\nspeciﬁc needs of each area of\
    \ a ﬁeld [23]. In this approach, residual issues of chemicals, as\nwell as wastage\
    \ of input resources, can be reduced. Also, net proﬁt can be improved with\nincreased\
    \ crop yield and reduced input costs, as farmers can use resources according to\
    \ the\nﬁeld requirements rather than full-coverage application in ﬁelds at uniform\
    \ rates [2,24,25].\nAccording to the identiﬁed heterogeneity of a ﬁeld, amounts\
    \ of water, fertilizer, her-\nbicides, pesticides, and liming can be determined\
    \ and applied. When considering the\nirrigation practices in precision agriculture,\
    \ technology-driven, more sustainable smart\nirrigation systems are there to apply\
    \ precise amounts of water at precise times. When\nsoil moisture sensor data give\
    \ an estimation of a required amount of water, irrigation\nsystems can be diverted\
    \ into variable rate irrigation to apply irrigation water until mois-\nture content\
    \ returns to the ideal level [26]. Most of the time, these effective and efﬁcient\n\
    water management systems are automatically controlled, increasing irrigation water\
    \ use\nefﬁciency (IWUE). Monteiro et al. in 2021 described the use of satellite\
    \ LANDSAT data and\nremote-sensing data to develop a feasible operational irrigation\
    \ water model [3]. Likewise,\ntillage depth can be determined via matching with\
    \ variabilities of soil physical proper-\nties [27]. Chemical spraying and seeding\
    \ are also performed according to variable rate\napproaches. Previously, agricultural\
    \ aircraft were used for chemical spraying, where a\npilot controlled the spray\
    \ [23]. In the present, aircraft are employed with an auto-adjusting\nability\
    \ for the application rate of chemicals based on a prescription map, whilst UAVs\
    \ are\nalso used as fertilizer spreaders [3]. Precision seeding can control sowing\
    \ depth, densities,\nand distances effectively while saving seeds, time, and labor\
    \ costs. Studies estimated that\nprecision seeding based on variable rate technologies\
    \ was 10% to 30% more efﬁcient than\nconventional practices [3].\nThis site-speciﬁc\
    \ management increases the number of correct decisions per unit area\nper unit\
    \ time related to net beneﬁts [9] while supporting the conservation of agricultural\n\
    inputs and reducing costs together with environmental impacts [2,13,24]. Another\
    \ man-\nagement tool, grid sampling, also involves the division of ﬁelds into\
    \ a grid and collecting\ndata at each intersection of the grid. This approach\
    \ provides representative information\nof the entire variation within a ﬁeld [11],\
    \ where such data are able to be used for site-\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n\

    \ small-scale\nvariabilities of soil and crop features, a local resource management\
    \ (LRM) system was\ndeveloped with computer-aided farming (CAF), which translated\
    \ information into variable\nrate applications [11].\nThus far, humans have used\
    \ digital tools to enhance diagnosis and decision making\nwhile adding automated\
    \ machines for precise performing [14]. The accelerating changes of\nIndustry\
    \ 4.0 plus these digital technologies have granted the gradual automation of the\n\

    \ aware of the ecological footprint of agri-products, the\nabove combination supports\
    \ the increase in the demand for agricultural commodities [29],\nadding high market\
    \ value. Recent advancements of high-resolution remote sensing and\nintelligent\
    \ information and communication technologies, including social media (Facebook,\n\
    Twitter, Amazon, Instagram, etc.), have contributed to big data analytics in many\
    \ sectors,\nas well as in many stages in farming, including decision making, weather\
    \ forecasting,\nweather management, disaster management, smart management of resources,\
    \ disease and\npest interruption, and harvesting time predictions [4,6,30]. Moreover,\
    \ big data analytics\naid in implementing real-time forecasting in precision agriculture\
    \ [4]. However, data\nupdating, device security, correctness of data, accuracy\
    \ of data, availability of data, and\nsecurity elements, such as encryption, are\
    \ still barriers when combining big data with\nsmart farming [31]. Invalid data\
    \ can lead farmers to make costly, disruptive decisions\nand actions [5].\n3.2.\
    \ Machine Vision Technology\nPrecise and accurate data and information are the\
    \ driving components of precision\nagriculture. Recently, image analysis has become\
    \ a more reliable data source than man-\nual, labor-intensive, costly data-collecting\
    \ methods [22,32]. Here, machines can read and\nunderstand the real world through\
    \ pixel images and produce accurate site-speciﬁc informa-\ntion [31]. Machines\
    \ with ‘eyes’ in agricultural activities are called machine vision (MV). This,\n\
    also known as agro-vision or the ‘eyes’ of robots, provides non-destructive, robust,\
    \ rapid,\nand steady methods to monitor cultivation processes. MV systems give\
    \ machines their\nvision and judgement capabilities in image processing and data\
    \ extraction [10]. Although\nMV technologies have already been applied successfully\
    \ for crop species identiﬁcation,\ncrop stress detection, crop seed quality assessment,\
    \ weed detection, disease detection, etc.,\nthey are still at the prototype stage.\
    \ Currently, emerging deep-learning (DL) techniques in\ngrowing machine-learning\
    \ (ML) technologies are integrated with MV applications in order\nto develop intelligent\
    \ robots for multispectral imagery analysis and real-time analysis in\nﬁeld variable\
    \ rate applications [10,25]. Commercial smartphones, which are ubiquitous\namong\
    \ the human population, are able to be used in monitoring crop health and stress\n\
    based on MV systems [33].\n3.3. Internet of Things (IoT)\nThe IoT refers to a\
    \ network of interconnected items and technologies [16]. The IoT\nis one of the\
    \ most important technological advancements in precision agriculture and\nsmart\
    \ farming [5]. IoT architecture for agriculture, such as agricultural sensors\
    \ with\nICT and UAV, collects data for precision agriculture [31]. Also, the burgeoning\
    \ IoT and\nmobile data are the core of the fourth industrial revolution [10].\
    \ Meanwhile, advancements\nin communication technologies and wireless networks\
    \ (5G, LoRaWAN, NB-IoT, Sigfox,\nZigBee, and Wi-Fi) have broadened the application\
    \ of the IoT in diverse ﬁelds, such as\nreal-time remote control and high-throughput\
    \ phenotyping, while giving better coverage,\nbandwidth, connection density, and\
    \ end-to-end latency (Table 1) [8]. When it consolidates\nin agriculture together\
    \ with cloud computing, it results in smart farming [6] for various\nscopes of\
    \ livestock monitoring, smart greenhouses, ﬁshery management, and weather\ntracking\
    \ [8]. The IoT can be widely used in all areas of precision agriculture with the\n\
    development of sensors with independent intellectual property rights and the development\n\
    of smart devices, such as intelligent tractors, UAVs, and robots that can replace\
    \ high levels\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n8 of 26\nof manual labor input, performing\

    \ data, which are then uploaded to cloud information support systems to man-\n\
    Agriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n9 of 26\nage [4,13,16,28]. Those sensors can directly\
    \ combine with agricultural robots, autonomous\nplatforms, machines, and weather\
    \ stations for real-time monitoring [4]. With the IoT, UAVs\ncan respond promptly,\
    \ leading to high-quality, high-resolution, and exceptionally reliable\nobservations\
    \ through high-throughput 3D monitoring at different geographical areas. At\n\
    the same time, various kinds of agricultural sensor nodes, autonomous farm vehicles,\
    \ and\nmobile crowd sensing have been put forward based on the IoT for ground\
    \ and undersurface\ncognition [8]. Most IoT sensors in precision agriculture are\
    \ in wireless frameworks [13] or\nlow-power wide-area networks [8] and, hence,\
    \ can be used for on-site analysis [3], as well\nas mass data transfer, without\
    \ any interruptions [29,31]. Still, there are cost, operational,\ntechnical, and\
    \ data management difﬁculties in implementing the IoT in agricultural opera-\n\
    tions [13]. Designing low-cost, energy-efﬁcient, wireless IoT technologies in\
    \ autonomous\napplications is affected by the following dependencies: data latency\
    \ on power consump-\ntion, data scalability on storage and processing cost, and\
    \ data interoperability on cloud\ncompatibility to store and process various kinds\
    \ of data [13].\nDifferent IoT devices are coalesced as networks to achieve high-speed\
    \ data exchang-\ning [4,30]. Therefore, the development of an IoT framework can\
    \ also solve problems with\nbig data [31]. With more advancements, agricultural\
    \ operations like protecting, controlling,\nmonitoring, and detecting can be extended\
    \ using smart phones with the IoT [25]. As an\nexample, time-consuming cattle\
    \ status monitoring has also beneﬁted from the IoT, allowing\nfarmers to monitor\
    \ the health and welfare of animals. Also, weed detection through MV\nprimarily\
    \ consists of deep learning (DL) and image processing [16].\nEdge computing enables\
    \ affordable real-time data transmission in IoT precision agri-\nculture, reducing\
    \ data package size and alleviating strain on centralized cloud resources.\nInternet\
    \ and communication companies leverage their expertise to extend cloud service\n\
    capabilities to edge networks, shaping the edge computing landscape. Pioneers\
    \ like Cisco\nand Huawei have developed comprehensive frameworks and lightweight\
    \ computing sys-\ntems. The IoT connects objects through smart technologies, while\
    \ research explores aerial\nedge–IoT systems for improved convergence speed and\
    \ task completion rates [39–42].\n3.4. Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning\
    \ (ML), and Deep Learning (DL)\nAI has a key role in robotics and autonomous systems\
    \ (RASs). The development of\nAI in the IoT has contributed continuous data streams\
    \ [31]. To make agricultural data into\nmeaningful information in decision-making\
    \ data, mining techniques are required. Various\nenvironmental data and farming\
    \ historical records in big data are analyzed using AI, which\nﬁnds patterns that\
    \ are hidden in big data [29]. These discoveries are important in the pest\nidentiﬁcation,\
    \ disease detection, yield prediction, and fertilizing plans [25,31] included\
    \ in\nagricultural decision support systems. AI has noteworthy potential to accommodate\
    \ the\nreduction of food wastage, the improvement of production hygiene, and the\
    \ monitoring\nof machines in many stages of agriculture, such as supply chain,\
    \ agricultural production\npattern, and agricultural production process including\
    \ soil, crop, and water management,\nas well as disease and pest control [4,8].\
    \ Then, AI has the potential to overcome problems\nin conventional farming [31].\n\
    Both ML and DL are subconcepts of AI (Figure 3) [10]. With ML, a computer learns\n\
    independently to improve the performance of AI, which goes through explicit feature\n\
    extraction [6]. ML focuses on the theory, performance, and properties of learning\
    \ systems\nand algorithms, as it is a high-performance informatics technology\
    \ for quantifying and\nunderstanding data-intensive farming processes [6]. On\
    \ the other hand, DL can solve\nproblems with combinations of layers and nonlinear\
    \ functions [10]. To address limitations\nin the practical implementation of robots,\
    \ mobile terminals, and intelligent devices in\nmodern agriculture, the integration\
    \ of machine-learning algorithms has had signiﬁcant\nimprovement. With machine-learning\
    \ models, integration into mobile detection algorithms\nhas paved the way for\
    \ innovative and more precise detection methods, overcoming certain\nlimitations\
    \ faced by technology adaptation in plant factories, such as limited computer\n\

    \ and\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n10 of 26\nprecision issues related to small\
    \ target detection [25,43]. Furthermore, machine-learning\ntechniques can mitigate\
    \ the need for large network sizes and improve the operational\nspeeds of these\
    \ systems [43]. This advancement has wide-ranging applications, including\naccurate\
    \ fruit and pest detection, as well as the optimization and prediction of complex\n\
    conditions in plant tissue cultures and breeding processes [25,28,44]. Notably,\

    Also, machine-learning algorithms are employed for data validation, enabling a\

    \ and providing accurate predictions of the dynamic nature\nof agriculture while\
    \ identifying new opportunities [1]. Supervised machine-learning\ntechniques,\
    \ such as support vector machines, decision trees, k-means, random forests,\n\
    genetic algorithms, deep learning, and fuzzy logic, are several categories of\
    \ machine-\nlearning models (Figure 3) that play a vital role in agricultural\
    \ automation, augmenting\nthe intelligence of other technologies, such as smartphones,\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicles,\nunmanned ground vehicles, satellite systems, automated\
    \ machines, agricultural robots,\nand big data analytics [1,28,31].\nMobile applications\
    \ have signiﬁcantly diverted from these AI, ML, DL, and MV\ntechnologies [10].\
    \ ML algorithms in big data are also critically essential because this\nintegration\
    \ can learn from data to create decisions, data-based prospects, and predictions.\n\
    Due to the intricate input data requirements of machine learning (ML) and deep\
    \ learning\n(DL), the initial stage of adopting ML models in precision agriculture\
    \ may encounter\nsigniﬁcant obstacles in terms of the time and cost involved in\
    \ gathering the necessary data\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n11 of 26\nfrom commercial\
    \ farms [1,6,30]. However, with the continuous advancement of IoT sensors,\nAI-based\
    \ autonomous machines or robots together with cloud computing, edge computing,\n\
    and blockchain can support overcoming this difﬁculty during the transforming,\
    \ storing,\nand processing of data in the creation of ML models [27,36,41]. Accordingly,\
    \ ML is able to be\nused to solve diverse issues in agriculture related to yield\
    \ prediction, crop quality, disease\ndetection, weed detection, species identiﬁcation,\
    \ animal welfare, livestock production,\nwater management, and soil management\
    \ [6,45]. Common principles of ML techniques\nare clustering, decision trees,\
    \ instance-based models, regression, artiﬁcial and deep neural\nnetworks, ensemble\
    \ learning, support vector machines, and Bayesian models [6]. A study\nproved\
    \ that ML was a powerful tool for analyzing data to monitor inputs and outputs\n\
    aiming to optimize plant tissue culture protocols [44].\nSmart farming is technology\
    \ that relies on its implementation with the use of AI and\nthe IoT in cyber-physical\
    \ farm management [28]. According to current applications, AI has\nbeen involved\
    \ in soil management, crop management, disease management, weed control,\netc.\
    \ Examples are the fuzzy-logic-based soil risk characterization decision support\
    \ system\n(SRCDSS), management-oriented modeling (MOM), artiﬁcial neural networks\
    \ (ANNs),\nCALEX, PROLOG, computer vision systems, ANN-GIS, invasive weed optimization\
    \ (IWO),\nand support vector machines [4]. One key application of AI is a mobile\
    \ expert system\nwhere farmers can use their smartphones for disease diagnosis,\
    \ species identiﬁcation, and\nsoil health analysis with the help of mobile apps.\
    \ In addition, AI is a real-time analyzer of\nsatellite images when the progress\
    \ of farming is tracked with satellite imagery [24]. With AI\napplications, precision\
    \ agriculture now has a scientiﬁc background, which helps to make\nprecision agriculture\
    \ more formalized to perform optimal agriculture outputs [29]. In the\nfuture,\
    \ AI may be improved to deal with the dynamic nature of agricultural microclimates,\n\
    as it is now facing difﬁculties ﬁnding a single standard solution for that heterogeneity.\n\
    The existing experience gap between AI researchers and farmers hinders the complete\n\
    understanding of agricultural problems and solutions. To eliminate this obstacle,\
    \ the\nknowledge of farmers, agricultural professionals, and AI researchers should\
    \ be linked.\nIn spite of this, accessibility and privacy protection problems\
    \ when working with huge\namounts of data should be addressed to deliver more\
    \ skillful AI [8,16].\n3.5. Guidance Systems\nGuidance systems use GPS (global\
    \ positioning system) technology to provide farmers\nwith real-time information\
    \ about their equipment locations and herd-grazing locations,\nenabling them to\
    \ optimize ﬁeld operations such as planting, harvesting, and herding [1,12].\n\
    The limited number of satellites, poor signal strengths, and lack of reliable\
    \ connectivity\nwere overcome by introducing a GNSS (global navigation satellite\
    \ system), which then re-\nplaced labor-intensive, time-consuming farm operations\
    \ with more effective methods, such\nas VRA [11,31]. Previously, agricultural\
    \ inputs were performed manually, and during Agri-\nculture 3.0, they were performed\
    \ mechanically using digitalized machines [2]. With rapid\ncommercialization,\
    \ agricultural machinery services have emerged that require efﬁcient\nmanagement\
    \ to prevent overuse or underuse issues. For the understanding of agricultural\n\
    machinery, GNSS plays a crucial role in optimizing effectivity and efﬁciency [46].\
    \ The\nnew trend of GNSS-enabled devices in the fully automated steering of tractions\
    \ is saving\ntime, labor costs, and money [2]. Precision agricultural robots require\
    \ high-resolution\nnavigation solutions [47]. Similarly, agricultural rovers and\
    \ robots are effective only when\nprecisely guided in their actions [45]. Some\
    \ studies introduced DL propagation models in\nGNSS fused with inertial navigation\
    \ data sets for precision agriculture [47]. One example\nis electric seeders with\
    \ optical ﬁber detection technology that were developed and tested\nsuccessfully\
    \ [3]. The new development of software-based farm management solutions\nfor GIS\
    \ encourage the automation of data collection and analysis of supervising, storing,\n\
    decision making, and farm management.\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n12 of 26\n\
    3.6. Blockchain Technology\nBlockchain is deﬁned as a decentralized, distributed\
    \ database that maintains a con-\ntinuously growing list of ordered records or\
    \ blocks, which was ﬁrst used in cryptocur-\nrency [15,48]. Blockchain offers\
    \ data transparency, immutability, and reliability, which\nimprove the mutual\
    \ trust between various parties in the supply chain [15]. As this technol-\nogy\
    \ eliminates the obstacles of corporations, this was introduced to precision agriculture,\n\
    increasing the easiness of the integration of digital technologies into agriculture.\
    \ This step\nprovides solutions to some technical challenges in smart farming,\
    \ furnishing the remote\nmonitoring and controlling of farm equipment through\
    \ the “IoT applied Greenhouse Moni-\ntoring System” [15,48]. One such challenge\
    \ is an insufﬁcient and insecure infrastructure for\ndata sharing. Another challenge\
    \ is the delay of remote-sensing satellites in detecting the\nvariability of croplands.\
    \ Therefore, as a solution for the above decentralization, anonymity,\nand security\
    \ problems in the IoT in smart farming, blockchain has been proposed, expect-\n\
    ing lightweight, distributed, decentralized, and transparent security and privacy\
    \ [5,48].\nBlockchain can assist with having a reliable, faster, and secure platform\
    \ to monitor farm\noperations, although it is still in its early stages of maturity\
    \ [15,48]. As information can be\ncommunicated securely in a distributed network\
    \ [48], with the help of blockchain this can\nimprove the planning of schedules\
    \ for various agricultural processes, such as irrigation\nwater sharing, energy\
    \ consumption, the incorporation of machines and labors, and tasks\nfor robot\
    \ coalitions and autonomous UAVs [15,28]. Especially in the food supply chain,\n\
    this is a crucial point because of food safety issues, as well as asymmetric and\
    \ fragmented\ninformation occurring related to the insufﬁcient supply chain [1,8,10].\n\
    3.7. Robotics and Autonomous Systems\nMost recently, autonomous farming has involved\
    \ a high degree of the use of robotics,\nsensors, drones, and remote sensing to\
    \ perform various agricultural tasks, such as planting,\nspraying, harvesting,\
    \ and weeding, while reducing labor costs and improving efﬁcient\ndecision making\
    \ [3,45]. RASs are a combination of emerging modern technologies that have\nkey\
    \ applications in both agricultural production processes and production patterns.\
    \ Mobile\nrobots equipped with various sensors, actuators, and ML algorithms are\
    \ key enablers to\nautomatically handle variability and uncertainty in farming\
    \ practices [47]. Key applications\nof RAS in agricultural patterns are in plant\
    \ factories, 3D food printing, and biodiverse\nfarming, whereas autonomous farming,\
    \ aerial monitoring, and automated husbandry\nhave become new applications in\
    \ agricultural production processes [8]. However, agricul-\ntural RASs are required\
    \ to be improved to fulﬁll efﬁcient work with accurate guidance,\nautonomous navigation,\
    \ and accurate detection of dynamic agricultural environments\n(changing appearances,\
    \ growth stages, weather conditions, object overlapping, etc.). Intelli-\ngent\
    \ actions, such as robot-assisted plant phenotyping, fruit counting, fruit harvesting,\
    \ fruit\ncounting, leaf peeling, selective spraying, and 3D mapping, are demonstrated\
    \ and currently\nemployed applications of RASs [8]. Auto-steered agricultural\
    \ vehicles are also used in\nmany ﬁeld operations [3], such as tilling, planting,\
    \ chemical applications, and harvesting.\nThese machines, like harvesters, sprayers,\
    \ tractors, planters, and mechanical weed controls,\nuse guidance systems either\
    \ with light bars [13] or a GNSS [2,20]. These guidance systems\nvisualize the\
    \ positions of equipment to prevent skips and overlaps, which is important in\n\
    variable rate applications.\n3.8. Artiﬁcial Satellites, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles\
    \ (UAVs), and Unmanned Ground\nVehicles (UGVs)\nArtiﬁcial satellites, such as\
    \ American Landsat satellites, the European Sentinel-2 Sys-\ntem, the RapidEye\
    \ constellation satellite system, the GeoEye-1 system, and WorldView-3,\nfor remote\
    \ sensing help to generate remotely accessible data in multispectral forms [8].\n\
    The establishment of these intelligent remote-sensing satellites has provided\
    \ full coverage\nfor collecting agricultural information [8,31,49]. More recently,\
    \ ubiquitous and affordable\ntechnologies such as drones, crews, and aircraft\
    \ have allowed images to be captured closer\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n13 of\
    \ 26\nto the ground and at a higher frequency, increasing detail and functionality\
    \ [45]. UGVs ac-\nquire high-resolution data for weed identiﬁcation and control,\
    \ selective pesticide spraying,\nsoil analysis, and crop scouting, while scouting\
    \ robots accomplish speciﬁc targets [49] such\nas mechanical weeding (Oz robot),\
    \ spraying (GUSS autonomous sprayer), fertilizing, map-\nping, and seeding (RowBot\
    \ system), as well as vineyard management (VineRobots) [4,50].\nInformation, including\
    \ imagery data generated by satellites, UAVs, and UGVs, is the\nparamount thing\
    \ in precision agriculture, as it supports vegetation patch identiﬁcation,\nweed\
    \ recognition, pest attack detection, observation of environmental stresses, and\
    \ accurate\nclassiﬁcation in VRT [18,45]. Not only that, in other agricultural\
    \ disciplines, such as aqua-\nculture, agroforestry, and forestry, imagery data\
    \ play a considerable role because they can\ncover large areas when gathering\
    \ information, and these data are reproducible [20]. Data\nfrom satellites, UAVs,\
    \ and UGVs are supported by detailed ground survey data processed\nwith ML and\
    \ DL algorithms in order to make them usable and meaningful information [18].\n\
    For example, in forestry, determining forest densities is labor-intensive and\
    \ time-\nconsuming, although it is an important parameter when combatting climate\
    \ change. Re-\ncently, data of tree type distribution could be achieved over a\
    \ wide area of forest with the\nhelp of hyperspectral images and NDVI and RGB\
    \ images from UAVs such as Sentinel-\n2 [13,16]. Likewise, in remote sensing satellites\
    \ and drones play a big role in monitoring\ndeforestation and obtaining accurate\
    \ coverage of vegetative types and classiﬁcation of\ntree species and are more\
    \ effective than other UAV or LiDAR data [14,34]. Although there\nare limitations,\
    \ drone and remotely piloted aircraft usage is dramatically increasing while\n\
    providing precise information for precision agriculture through hyperspectral\
    \ sensors,\nmultispectral cameras, and other novel technologies [14]. This is\
    \ a cost-effective, promising\nmethod for monitoring large-scale farms or crop\
    \ lands [4], as well as forest areas [14].\n3.9. High-throughput Phenotyping\n\
    High-throughput phenotyping has emerged as a promising approach to enhance\nprecision\
    \ agriculture by allowing the rapid and accurate measurement of plant traits [51]\n\
    quantitatively and qualitatively [22,52]. Accurate and high-throughput plant phenotyping\n\
    is important for accelerating crop breeding [52]. This technique uses advanced\
    \ technologies\nsuch as remote sensing [40,42], spectral imaging [41], and robotics\
    \ [53] to collect large\namounts of data on plant characteristics, such as growth\
    \ rate, yield, disease resistance, and\nmorphology [51,54,55]. By collecting and\
    \ analyzing these data, farmers can gain insights\ninto how their crops are performing\
    \ and make more informed decisions about things like\nfertilization, irrigation,\
    \ harvesting, and pest management [22,54]. High-throughput pheno-\ntyping can\
    \ also help breeders to develop new crop varieties that are better adapted to\
    \ local\ngrowing conditions and can produce higher yields (Figure 4) [51]. A full\
    \ range of visible\nand near-infrared hyperspectral data enables ML techniques\
    \ such as LSR (least squares\nregression) to predict speciﬁc biochemical and physicochemical\
    \ traits beyond simple vege-\ntative indices [56]. ML-based precision agriculture\
    \ systems have AI background [52,54],\nand therefore, when detecting diseases,\
    \ pests, nutrient deﬁciency, and weeds, stressed\nresponses are detected using\
    \ high-quality images generated with UGV or UAV remote\nsensing, hyperspectral\
    \ imaging, and satellite imaging to support high-throughput pheno-\ntyping [57].\
    \ Ultimately, high-throughput phenotyping has the potential to revolutionize\n\
    agriculture by enabling more the precise, real-time, and efﬁcient monitoring of\
    \ farming\npractices that can improve crop productivity, reduce environmental\
    \ impacts, and increase\nfood security [54].\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n14 of\

    \ Evaluating the capabilities of 5G and 6G networks, including\ncurrent and future\
    \ support, is essential for identifying use cases and the requirements in\nthese\

    \ Successful Precision Agriculture Proposals and Implementations\nThe article\
    \ [63] reviewed advancements in automated fruit-harvesting robots for\nsweet peppers\
    \ and apples, highlighting the successful implementation of a sweet-pepper-\n\
    harvesting robot called ‘Harvey’, which effectively addressed detection, grasp\
    \ selection,\nand manipulation challenges. Similarly, the apple-harvesting robot\
    \ utilized a picking\nmanipulator and a catching manipulator, along with machine\
    \ vision and prioritization algo-\nrithms, for efﬁcient harvesting. The article\
    \ emphasized interdisciplinary collaboration for\nfurther advancements in automated\
    \ harvesting systems and the importance of intelligent\nsystems like deep learning\
    \ and crop management software for enhancing productivity and\nsustainability\
    \ in modern agriculture. Field trials were conducted with Harvey for sweet\npeppers\
    \ in Australia, while robotic picking systems for apples were tested in a Washing-\n\
    ton orchard in the U.S. [64,65]. Israel has successfully implemented autonomous\
    \ robotic\ntechnology in their crop ﬁelds, paving the way for the commercial use\
    \ of AI harvesters.\nTevel Aerobotics Technologies developed an autonomous fruit-picking\
    \ system that utilized\nﬂying robots tethered to an autonomous vehicle, enabling\
    \ accurate fruit picking, extended\nwork hours, and additional tasks like tree\
    \ thinning and pruning. This system addressed\nlabor shortages, reduced fruit\
    \ production costs by approximately 30%, provided real-time\nupdates to farmers\
    \ via a mobile app, and aimed to tackle challenges faced by the agriculture\n\
    industry. Tevel plans to introduce its innovative solution to the global market,\
    \ catering to\nfruit farmers worldwide and contributing to the growing agricultural\
    \ robotics sector [66].\nSenapathy et al. introduced the IoTSNA-CR model from\
    \ their study, which leveraged\nIoT technology to classify soil nutrients and\
    \ provide crop recommendations, aiming to\noptimize fertilizer usage and maximize\
    \ productivity for farmers. The implementation of\nAI harvesters in Israel showcases\
    \ the potential of artiﬁcial intelligence, machine learning,\ncloud services,\
    \ sensors, and automation for delivering real-time information and support\nto\
    \ farmers. The proposed IoTSNA-CR model incorporated IoT sensors, cloud storage,\n\
    machine-learning techniques, and an optimized algorithm (MSVM-DAG-FFO) to achieve\n\
    high accuracy in soil analysis. The model allowed farmers to maintain soil information\
    \ in\nthe cloud, reducing costs and improving productivity. Experimental validation\
    \ conﬁrmed\nthe effectiveness of the model for crop prediction and soil health\
    \ maintenance, emphasizing\nthe importance of real-time data collection and expanding\
    \ data sets and regular application\nuse for informed decision making and soil\
    \ quality enhancement [49]. The use of unmanned\naerial systems (UASs) and unmanned\
    \ ground vehicles (UGVs) in precision agriculture for\ninspecting insect traps\
    \ in olive groves was proposed by [49], with a cooperative robot archi-\ntecture\
    \ using UAS and UGV systems evaluating vision-based navigation algorithms and\n\
    augmented reality tags for return and landing. The results demonstrated the feasibility\
    \ of\nthe architecture for automating inspections and improving pest control policies.\
    \ Challenges\nremain in addressing real-world conditions and optimizing image\
    \ capture. Future work\nincludes real-world scenarios and long-term mission capabilities\
    \ of UAS vehicles [49].\nTwo studies from University Tenaga National, Malaysia,\

    \ a low-cost agricultural robot for fertilizer and pesticide spraying, crop monitoring,\n\
    and pest detection. The prototype system operated autonomously, reducing labor\
    \ costs,\nalthough productivity slightly lagged behind human workers. An autonomous\
    \ organic\nfertilizer mixer was developed in [68] based on IoT technology to reduce\
    \ labor costs and\nenhance efﬁciency. The improved mixer allowed remote monitoring,\
    \ updates, and alerts,\naiming to further streamline the organic fertilizer-mixing\
    \ process. A harvesting robot\nsystem for cherry tomatoes in greenhouses was developed\
    \ by the Beijing Research Center\nof Intelligent Equipment for Agriculture. This\
    \ new harvesting robot system for cherry\ntomatoes was designed featuring a railed-type\
    \ vehicle, a visual servo unit, a manipulator,\nand picking end-effectors. Field\
    \ tests demonstrated an average picking time of 12 s per\nbunch of tomatoes with\
    \ a success rate of 83% [69]. Also, X. Jin et al. [70] designed a small-\nsized\
    \ vegetable seed electric seeder with power drive and optical ﬁber detection technology,\n\
    providing high efﬁciency and precision by monitoring sowing conditions in real-time\
    \ for\ndifferent seed sizes (Table 2).\nThe Cooperative Heterogeneous Robots for\

    \ cooperative UAS and UGV system for olive\ngrove inspection that veriﬁed the\
    \ feasibility and robustness of the multiple-cooperative\nrobot architecture in\

    \ an approach for dynamic robot coalition that combined fuzzy coalition games\n\
    and smart contracts to form a dynamic and trusted coalition. It enabled the collection\n\
    and dissemination of information from robot sensors in a shared space. Integration\
    \ of the\nIoT with blockchain allows the continuous tracking of food in precision\
    \ agriculture tasks,\nensuring transparency and veriﬁcation at each stage. Precision\
    \ agriculture is a strategy that\nuses advanced technologies, like sensors, remote\

    \ increase productivity, proﬁtability, and sustainabil-\nity. Machine-learning\
    \ models have been integrated with IoT sensors to develop intelligent\nsensors\

    \ Agriculture\nHigh-tech technologies from the fourth industrial revolution have\
    \ the potential to\nrevolutionize the agriculture industry, enabling more efﬁcient\
    \ and sustainable practices\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n20 of 26\nwhile improving\
    \ productivity and reducing resource wastage. The adaptation of these\nintelligent,\
    \ advanced technologies in precision agriculture is still in its early stages,\
    \ and\nas such, there exist several barriers (Table 3) that must be addressed\
    \ to facilitate the\ntransformation of precision agriculture. However, it is essential\
    \ to carefully consider the\nspeciﬁc requirements, challenges, and implementation\
    \ considerations for each technology\nin the context of the agricultural operation\
    \ at hand.\nA lack of interdisciplinary skills is one of the major roadblocks,\
    \ as big data engineers,\ndata analysts, and data scientists do not have an agricultural\
    \ background. On the other\nhand, farmers with long experience and practical knowledge\
    \ are not educated enough to\nhandle high technology like artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ [8]. The production and development\ncosts of high-tech applications and the\
    \ capital for establishing them in real-world agriculture\nare also high [78].\
    \ This high cost of the production and implementation of advanced\ntechnologies\
    \ may render them inaccessible to small-scale farmers, who may lack the\nﬁnancial\
    \ resources to invest in such technologies [79].\nFurthermore, the unavailability\
    \ of affordable technologies for small-scale farmers may\ncreate a digital divide,\
    \ where only large-scale, educated farmers may be able to beneﬁt from\nsuch technologies\
    \ [20,80]. In the unequal distribution of resources in the world, it is difﬁcult\n\
    for certain groups to reach for such new technological inventions. The implementation\n\
    of precision agriculture trends in many developing agricultural countries has\
    \ become a\ndifﬁcult task due to lack of necessary funds, lack of conﬁdence in\
    \ the technologies, lack of\nproper infrastructure, lack of necessary resources,\
    \ etc. [8,76,78,81]. Additionally, the lack of\nsufﬁcient energy in rural areas\
    \ hinders the use of new technologies, even as science strives\nto develop wireless\
    \ power transfer methods and ambient or on-site energy-generating\nmethods [8].\
    \ Furthermore, low digital literacy and unequal accessibility to digital tech-\n\
    nologies in rural areas, coupled with connectivity issues, pose signiﬁcant challenges\
    \ in\nestablishing sustainable intelligent technologies in agricultural processes\
    \ [20,79,82].\nLimited computer power, storage capacity, and processing speed\
    \ and high energy\nconsumption by batteries are some technical obstacles in precision\
    \ agricultural adapta-\ntions [43], especially when dealing with big data. In\
    \ addition, collecting and analyzing\ndata from agricultural operations may raise\
    \ concerns about data privacy and security [4].\nThese data are heterogenous and,\
    \ when transferring and storing vast amounts, software\nplatforms from private\
    \ companies are needed. This reveals some ownership controversies\nof data [78].\
    \ Blockchain interoperability, privacy problems, data leakage, cyber terrorism,\n\
    and some nonrepudiation issues associated with big data are still difﬁculties\
    \ in precision\nagriculture [5,8,78,83], thereby causing farmers to be reluctant\
    \ to share their data with\nthird-party service providers [4,16]. In many areas\
    \ where agriculture is practiced, reli-\nable internet connectivity, which is\
    \ essential for collecting, transmitting, and analyzing\ndata, may not be readily\
    \ available [7] and, thus, may affect the absorption capacities of\nnovel technologies\
    \ [80].\nThe implementation of trending technologies requires technical expertise\
    \ that may\nbe unavailable in some regions, leading to job displacement and unemployment\
    \ as new\ntechnologies increase the demand for highly skilled laborers while decreasing\
    \ opportunities\nfor nonskilled workers. This has implications for both small-scale\
    \ and family commercial\nfarmers [8,9,20,79]. To effectively use these technologies,\
    \ farmers and service providers\nmay need training. However, different technologies\
    \ may not be compatible with each other\nor with existing agricultural machinery\
    \ and equipment, which could limit the adoption\nof advanced technologies in precision\
    \ agriculture [2,8,84]. Furthermore, the presence of\nbias and discrimination\
    \ intertwined with information technology, education, risk-taking\nattitudes,\
    \ and western power structures constitute formidable obstacles, hindering the\n\
    equitable dissemination and advancement of smart-farming technologies, particularly\n\
    within developing nations [80,85]. This highlights the need for policies on data\
    \ sharing that\ncater to both the public and farming industries and are sufﬁcient\
    \ to ensure data security [20].\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n21 of 26\nTable 3.\

    Agriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n22 of 26\n6. Future Developments Required\nIn recent\
    \ years, the agricultural sector has recognized the potential beneﬁts of adopting\n\
    new digital technologies. However, the slow rate of adaptation can be attributed\
    \ to several\nroadblocks and uncertainties associated with these advancements.\
    \ Despite the challenges,\nthere is a growing demand for organic foods [78], leading\
    \ to a shift from sustainable\nagriculture to smart organic farming. To capitalize\
    \ on this emerging opportunity, certain\nsteps need to be taken.\nOne crucial\
    \ aspect is bridging the gap between expertise personnel and farmers. Pro-\nviding\
    \ better education, along with vocational training on novel technological applications,\n\
    can empower farmers to make effective use of new technologies [20,78]. Governments\
    \ can\nplay a signiﬁcant role by creating physical, economic, legal, and social\
    \ infrastructure that\nsupports the establishment of precision agriculture. Investments\
    \ in energy infrastructure\nand communication infrastructure, internet connectivity,\
    \ service markets, consultancy\nservices, and credit markets can instill trust\
    \ and willingness among farmers to embrace\nthese technologies [2,20,81].\nTo\
    \ further enhance precision agriculture, addressing the lack of professional agri-\n\
    cultural sensors is paramount. The design of high-quality, high-resolution, and\
    \ reliable\nsensors powered by the IoT that are speciﬁcally tailored for the agricultural\
    \ production\nenvironment and the monitoring of plant and animal physiological\
    \ signs is essential [8].\nMoreover, integrating wireless power transfer options\
    \ can eliminate the need for frequent\nbattery replacements. However, special\
    \ attention should be given to enabling underground\nor underwater transmission\
    \ capabilities [8]. At the same time, on-site energy generation\nwith renewable\
    \ solar power or biogas energy can be considered comparatively to long\ndistance\
    \ energy transfer [77]. Although capital investment is high for establishment,\
    \ it is\nmore proﬁtable than grid power.\nCross-technology communication is another\
    \ crucial aspect that needs to be addressed.\nMachine vision for animal monitoring,\
    \ the development of smart phone applications for the\nreal-time tracking of spatial\
    \ and temporal variations, and the utilization of 6G mobile net-\nworks are promising\
    \ avenues for generating valuable data and informed decisions [34,83].\nAdditionally,\
    \ the emergence of new agricultural systems such as smart hydroponics with\nthe\
    \ IoT and advancements in breeding technologies with DL and ML technologies con-\n\
    tribute to the overall progress of precision agriculture.\nFuture advancements\
    \ in precision agricultural technologies hold great promise for\nthe agricultural\
    \ sector. Overcoming the existing roadblocks and uncertainties is essential\n\
    to unlocking the full potential of these technologies. By focusing on education,\
    \ infras-\ntructure development, sensor technology, communication systems, and\
    \ novel agricultural\napproaches, we can pave the way for a more efﬁcient, sustainable,\
    \ and productive future\nin agriculture.\n7. Conclusions\nPrecision agriculture,\
    \ now part of Agriculture 4.0, harnesses the power of digitalization\nfor improved\
    \ farming management. The integration of Industry 4.0 technologies has led to\n\
    notable trends, such as drones, GPS technology, data analytics, and artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence,\nenabling informed decision making in farming practices. Despite\
    \ these advancements,\nachieving a fully integrated agricultural management system\
    \ that comprehensively ad-\ndresses the complexities of the ﬁeld requires further\
    \ studies and innovations. Crucially,\nthe development of adaptive and predictive\
    \ information systems that effectively integrate\ndiverse data sources is essential\
    \ for ensuring sustainable and intelligent precision agri-\nculture. While precision\
    \ agriculture offers numerous beneﬁts, it also poses challenges for\nits widespread\
    \ adoption. The initial investment in technology, concerns related to data\nprivacy,\
    \ and compatibility issues with existing farming systems can be signiﬁcant barriers\n\
    for small-scale farmers. Moreover, the scalability and adaptability of these technologies\
    \ to\ndifferent farming conditions may limit their applicability in certain regions.\
    \ Overcoming\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1593\n23 of 26\nthese challenges necessitates\
    \ the implementation of education and training programs to\nequip farmers with\
    \ the necessary skills to leverage these technologies effectively.\nThis review\
    \ paper serves as a valuable resource for farmers and companies seeking\nto adopt\
    \ Industry 4.0 technologies in agriculture. By providing insights into IoT devices,\n\
    automation systems, data analytics, and precision-farming techniques, this paper\
    \ fos-\nters awareness and understanding of the opportunities and challenges in\
    \ smart farming.\nArmed with this knowledge, companies can make informed decisions\
    \ regarding technology\ninvestments and strategic planning while promoting sustainable\
    \ farming practices and\ncollaboration within the industry. By embracing Industry\
    \ 4.0 technologies, farmers and\ncompanies can enhance their agricultural operations,\
    \ optimize resource utilization, and\ncontribute to the collective progress toward\
    \ smart farming’s promising future.\nAuthor Contributions: E.M.B.M.K., A.T.L.,\

  analysis: '- A comparison between the pros and cons of major generic architecture
    in the context of agriculture 4.0 is important to highlight the choice during
    the conceptualization step.

    - The use of architectural solutions which can be for example free of fees during
    the research phase but needs a reimplementation caused by license limitations,
    the cost of the license in the use cases budget, etc. The use of products in closed
    or semi-closed ecosystems is a barrier to the research valuation.

    - The massive collection of data in the cloud allows to development of complex
    algorithms that need a large amount of computing resources to be elaborated. Afterward,
    they can be compressed, reduced, optimized in order to be deployed in embedded
    devices or divided and establish a collaboration between devices and computing
    resources such as cloud, fog, etc.'

    used in Agriculture 4.0. • Distributed Architectures and Cloud Computing complements.
    • Strategies of association between Edge, Fog, Cloud. • New architectural and
    computing trends. Abstract The Agriculture 4.0, also called Smart Agriculture
    or Smart Farming, is at the origin of the production of a huge amount of data
    that must be collected, stored, and processed in a very short time. Processing
    this massive quantity of data needs to use specific infrastructure that use adapted
    IoT architectures. Our review offers a comparative panorama of Central Cloud,
    Distributed Cloud Architectures, Collaborative Computing Strategies, and new trends
    used in the context of Agriculture 4.0. In this review, we try to answer 4 research
    questions: (1) Which storage and processing architectures are best suited to Agriculture
    4.0 applications and respond to its peculiarities? (2) Can generic architectures
    meet the needs of Agriculture 4.0 application cases? (3) What are the horizontal
    development possibilities that allow the transition from research to industrialization?
    (4) What are the vertical valuations possibilities to move from algorithms trained
    in the cloud to embedded or stand-alone products? For this, we compare architectures
    with 8 criteria (User Proximity, Latency & Jitter, Network stability, high throughput,
    Reliability, Scalability, Cost Effectiveness, Maintainability), and analyze the
    advantages and disadvantages of each of them. Graphical abstract Download : Download

    the Internet of Things (IoT), also formerly named pervasive Internet, is present
    in all domains of our daily life and follows exponential growth. The number of
    connected devices is estimated at the horizon of 2022 at 42.5 billion and at the
    horizon of 2025 at 75.5 billion1. The global IP traffic is estimated to 333 ZB
    per month in 20222 with the need to store and treat this data (Carnevale et al.,
    2019). The European Commission has predicted that 18 billion of 29 billion connected
    devices will be related to the IoT in 2022 (Agency, 2020). Cisco in a white paper
    has announced that connected devices to the Internet will generate 850 ZB/year
    by 2021 (Cisco, 2018). It is difficult to precisely determine the number of connected
    devices on a world scale, but their number is about several billion. In addition,
    McKinsey Global Institute predicts a total economic impact of IoT and Edge Computing
    devices that will reach 11 trillion USD by 2025 (Manyika and Chui, 2015). In the
    sector of the agriculture, nearly 12 million agricultural sensors installed globally
    by 2023 with an increase of 20% annually, which is predicted by the Business Insider
    Intelligence Service (Meola, 2021). Moreover, the smart agriculture business was
    estimated at USD 13.8 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach USD 22 billion
    by 2025 at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 9.8% (Meola, 2021). Within
    the IoT era, the type of clients is becoming increasingly lightweight. IoT devices
    and the network environment is gradually changing from high-speed wired networks
    to unstable wireless communication. Meanwhile, users'' demand IoT applications
    is also shifting to real-time and context-aware service provisioning, making the
    focus moving progressively from the cloud to the edge (Ren et al., 2017). The
    cloud is located within the Internet and is geographically centralized, is constituted
    of a few resourceful server nodes, and is inserted in multi hops in terms of distance
    among the clients (Munir et al., 2017). Cloud Computing (CC) is a paradigm widely
    available that offers benefits like minimal management effort, convenience, rapid
    elasticity, pay per use, ubiquity (Ai et al., 2018), easy maintenance, centralized
    management, and high server utilization (Shi et al., 2016). Furthermore, resources
    centralization implies an increase of average network latency, heavy bandwidth
    utilization, and high processing delay. Indeed, the tremendous amount of data
    handled in a unique server point can create congestion in the cloud servers and
    backhaul links (El-Sayed et al., 2017). Nevertheless, the rapid parallel development
    of the pervasive intelligent device, ubiquitous network, growth in popularity
    of virtual and augmented reality, self-driving vehicles, UAVs, social networks,
    networks applications, and services are not without consequences. As a matter
    of fact, the network bandwidth and speed limit performance and effectiveness of
    cloud computing especially for real-time and mission-critical applications cannot
    be guaranteed. Moreover, cloud computing can be hardly adapted or applied to various
    types of technologies and applications scenarios (Zhou et al., 2017). To address
    these issues, various extensions of central cloud computing have been proposed
    by industrial and academics to move computing and storage at the edge of the network
    close to users. Fog computing uses network elements between the central cloud
    and the edge of network and absolute edge elements such as microcontrollers close
    to sensors to process and store data with a distributed manner close to nodes.
    Whereas, with the developments of mobile devices, some new paradigms close to
    mobiles users have been proposed. For example, cloudlets or micro data centers
    are geographically implanted and accessible by means of Wi-Fi protocols; but,
    this approach does not always guarantee enough network quality. Manufacturers
    of cellular network equipment have proposed the Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) paradigm
    that associates fog servers with base stations to provide services to mobile devices.
    MEC associated with 5G allows to combine an ultra-low latency network with high
    available bandwidth, and processing resources accessible in the vicinity. The
    MEC original concept has been extended then to wireless networks and consequently
    renamed in “Multi-access Edge Computing” (Wang et al., 2020). Agriculture has
    previously undergone two waves of revolution. The first one was mechanization
    and the second was called the green revolution with genetic modifications (Saiz-Rubio
    and Rovira-Más, 2020). Since the late 1990s, the digital transformation of the
    agriculture in Agriculture 3.0 also called Precision Agriculture has begun with
    the integration of Geographical Information System (GIS), Global Positioning Systems
    (GPS), and the usage of sensors have invaded agriculture. They allowed the emergency
    of image processing, techniques using deep learning, and machine learning in the
    field of computer vision. This latter is implemented to discriminate weed, identify
    crops, detect diseases,…etc. The production of a large amount of data by agriculture
    3.0 has required the development of big data technologies to process them, reflecting
    important changes in various fields of research. Collected data must be recorded
    in a specific format in order to discover patterns, curate errors, eliminate duplicated
    or inconsistent data, or solve noise problems (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). Smart
    Farming also called Smart Agriculture or Agriculture 4.0 is a domain of IoT in
    full growth which bring innovative paths to improve the adaptability, the efficiency,
    and the resilience of the agriculture of production systems (Iaksch et al., 2021)
    boost competitiveness and profit (Triantafyllou et al., 2019), allocate resources
    reasonably, and avoid food waste (Zhai et al., 2020, Wolfert et al., 2017) thanks
    to the contribution of autonomous context awareness provided by sensors and the
    capability to execute autonomous or remote actions (Wolfert et al., 2017). Smart
    Farming displaces the strict application from the farm location to affect related
    fields such as decision making by farmers, biodiversity, supply chains management,
    food availability and quality, insurance, and research in environment and earth
    sciences,… Smart Farming is distinct from other domains of the Internet of Things
    (IoT) by the observation and action of biological objects (animals or plants).
    It differs from medical IoT by the fact that there are no issues related to privacy;
    but, the confidentiality of data is related to production processes. Like most
    areas of the IoT, Wireless Sensing and Actuating Network (WSAN) use Low-power
    and Lossy Network organized in hierarchical routing to collect data and actuate
    devices. Multi-path routing protocols can also be implemented to balance the data
    transfer load and conserve the energy of limited battery life, basic computational
    skills, unique communication identifier, and resources-constrained nodes. Due
    to the limited battery life, it is difficult and sometimes impossible to recharge
    or replace (Debauche et al., 2021). Moreover, energy-saving and ambient energy
    techniques must be applied to deal with the active and inactive operational time
    and schedule information transmission (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). To which objects
    can be added like connected agricultural vehicles, milking robots, Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicle (UAV) commonly known as drones, Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) also called
    robots, mobile devices such as tablets used to encode punctual observations (Debauche
    et al., 2021), and external sources such as public geo-services (Triantafyllou
    et al., 2019). The use of IoT in agriculture 4.0 ranges from family farming as
    for example in India on a very small scale with a few low-cost sensors and actuators
    to very large scales with thousands of expensive commercial sensors and many connected
    agricultural pieces of machineries as in the American mid-west. Smart Farming
    is characterized as aforementioned by a wide variety of objects that can produce
    the highly contrasted amounts of data from few bytes/s to Gb/s. In addition, the
    availability of network protocols in rural areas to transmit this data impact
    also the type of architecture to implement. Applications need treatments in real-time
    and/or at a different time. The ”real-time” requirements are also very variable
    depending on the use case. For instance, remote control of drones requires reaction
    times of at most a few milliseconds while the Variable Rate Fertilizer (VRF) or
    Variable Spraying (VS) application aim to optimize nutrients and herbicides application
    respectively need reaction time in a range of few milliseconds to few seconds.
    The real-time processing for monitoring a herd of cattle is of the order of a
    few minutes to a few hours. The data retention time is very variable and is highly
    dependent on each use case. For example, UAVs produce tremendous quantities of
    images to transfer to the cloud in real-time where they must be quickly processed
    and stored. They can also be post-processed to extract additional data in batch
    processing. While UGVs images lose their value after processing and eventually
    actuating. However, if data is of a special, new or exceptional nature, it can
    be stored with a view, for example, to improving artificial intelligence algorithms.
    Other sensors transmit data only when anomalies are detected while others transmit
    at regular intervals a tiny amount of data. However, the adoption of Smart Farming
    is hampered by the lack of models to guide stakeholders on how to implement and
    to deploy dense and heterogeneous IoT-based monitoring systems and manage their
    interoperability (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). Commercial sensors are very expensive
    making it impossible for small farms to implement them (Garcia et al., 2020).
    In addition, two trends are currently opposed. That coming from the manufacturers
    of agricultural machinery who have developed their ecosystems and who want to
    extend the services offered to farmers by attracting them into the captive ecosystems
    in which they are locked. Furthermore, another trend is the development of open
    ecosystems in which farmers can preserve the ownership of their data and keep
    control of the processing carried out on this data and of their use. On one hand,
    farmers are therefore faced with a dilemma where they are in any case forced to
    use agricultural equipment that collects their data against their will; on the
    other hand, they want to keep control of their data collected through IoT sensors.
    Currently, it is difficult to predict which of these two trends will take precedence
    over the other or whether one of the two will coexist (Wolfert et al., 2017).
    In this context, both private and public researchers can either use generic commercial
    platforms offered by cloud players on which they have limited possibilities of
    adaptation or develop their own architecture on the basis of commercial or free
    bricks, but with much greater possibilities of adaptation. In this case, the choice
    is also delicate, and a bad evaluation of the constraints can jeopardize the research
    project. Due to the recent advances in big data, we present a survey that provides
    an overview of the state of the art regarding Smart Farming. It aims at summarizing
    parameters that condition the choice of architecture to collect, process, and
    store agricultural data. Since there is a wide variety of use cases, it is important
    to make an informed choice when it comes to architecture. In this way, we address
    the current gap in the literature with a review of cloud architecture used in
    Agriculture 4.0 to collect, process, and store data to enlighten the reader about
    the possible choices and the new trends that emerge. The rest of this paper is
    structured as follows: The second section is composed of two parts. In the first
    part, we summarize related previous review in the domain and their contributions,
    in order to contextualize our contribution to the literature. In the second part,
    we identify architectures implemented in Agriculture 4.0 use cases. In the third
    section, we describe the methodology used to identify papers, the conceptual framework
    used to analyze the literature, and the criteria used to compare the selected
    architectures. In the fourth section, we present architectures used to collect,
    process, and store data. We describe successively the cloud-centric architectures,
    the extension of cloud paradigm, the distributed architecture. In the fifth section,
    new trends and futures directions are presented. In the sixth section, we discuss
    the future evolution of Agriculture 4.0 to Agriculture 5.0. Finally, the last
    section concludes this paper with recommendations and perspectives. 2. Related
    works We begin our review by identifying the previous review realized in the field
    of Internet of Things applied to Smart Agriculture to take stock of the state
    of art and highlighting aspects that have not been explored at the present time.
    In this section, we focus to achieve two objectives. The first aims to position
    our work in relation to the existing literature. The second aims to identify architectures
    commonly used in the case of applications in Agriculture 4.0. 2.1. Previous reviews

    reviews during the past four years (2017–2021). In 2017, Ray (Ray, 2017) reviewed
    throughout his paper IoT applications and the challenges that have been faced
    while IoT deployment to improve farming. Talavera. et al. (Talavera et al., 2017)
    reviewed agro-industrial and environmental applications that are using the Internet
    of Things (IoT) for monitoring, control, logistics, and prediction. Tzounis et
    al. conducted a survey of IoT technologies in agriculture and the challenges that
    farmers face going forward (Tzounis et al., 2017). Elijah et al. identified the
    most encountered challenges in the field of IoT applications in smart agriculture
    and presented common trends for innovative ideas (Elijah et al., 2018). In 2019,
    Ayaz et al. provided a state-of-art about IoT-based architectures applied in agriculture
    and identified present and future trends in the same field of study (Ayaz et al.,
    2019). Farooq et al. presented the ingredients of IoT-based smart farming with
    used technologies that apply the utilization of network architecture and protocols;
    in addition to that, they provided an overview of the regulations and policies
    of the use of IoT in farming regarding security and privacy. They concluded their
    study by summarizing the main challenges encountered in this discipline (Farooq
    et al., 2019). Feng et al. provided an overview of the wireless communication
    technologies in the precision agriculture domain. They benchmarked the prospection
    and challenges of existing technologies with the regular communication time used
    (Feng et al., 2019). Shafi et al. conducted a literature review about IoT-based
    automation of agriculture along with Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). These authors
    presented a case study based upon two models: 1- a WSN to monitor real-time crop
    of health conditions, 2- system-base remote sensing imagery to classification
    between healthy and unhealthy yield (Shafi et al., 2019). In terms of agriculture
    protection, Shi et al. drew a panoramic review during the last decade to address
    the challenge and future works to further the research in the field of protected
    agriculture (Shi et al., 2019). Khanna et Kaur called into an evolutionary scenario
    to highlight the most significant impact of IoT in Precision Agriculture (PA).
    They evaluated the contribution of their predecessors and enhanced the challenges
    to open up a new direction of inspiration and innovation in IoT applied to PA
    (Khanna and Kaur, 2019). Ruan et al. reviewed literature works from 2009 to 2018
    to suggest new ideas for folks interested to conduct research in the field of
    agriculture IoT, infrastructures, data security, and data sharing (Ruan et al.,
    2019). In 2020, two studies have been carried out about 20 UAV applications that
    are devoted to either aerial crop monitoring processes or spraying tasks (Radoglou-Grammatikis
    et al., 2020) and about the dilemmas that researchers must overcome while deploying
    IoT in the green agriculture domain (Ferrag et al., 2020). Villa-Henriksen et
    al. identified different challenges encountered during the implementation of IoT
    in various applications and proposed different solutions to address them (Villa-Henriksen
    et al., 2020). Misra et al. discuss the role of IoT and big data analysis in Smart
    Farming (Misra et al., 2020). In 2021, a recent study conducted by Friha et al.
    hypothesize the use, application, classification, and comparison of the most developed
    emerging technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
    (UAV), Wireless Technologies, open-source IoT platforms, Software Defined Networking
    (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technologies, cloud/fog computing,
    and middleware platforms (Friha et al., 2021). In the same year, Debauche et al.
    conducted a literature review to describe the main components of IoT and its applications
    in the field of Smart Farming (Debauche et al., 2021). 2.2. Platforms implemented
    in use cases We grouped applications into 4 categories: (1) Water Management in
    which we have aggregate all types of water use such as irrigation and watering
    animals. (2) Plant Disease and Pest groups all use cases in plant’s pathologies
    detection and treatment of plant pathologies (spraying of fungicides, pesticides,
    etc). (3) Crop Management brings together all the use cases relating to cropping
    operations: soil management (plowing, fertilizer application), sowing, weeding,
    and harvesting. (4) Livestock includes everything related to the breeding of farm
    animals (nutrition, behavior, diseases, treatments). Table 2 summarizes platform
    used to implement use cases in Smart Farming classified following our four categories.

    in Smart Irrigation in which they showed that data is stored in the database or
    in the cloud. On 151 reviewed papers, one uses Raspberry Pi, 18 databases, 53
    clouds, and 79 are self-developed or not mentioned (Garcia et al., 2020). Navarro
    et al. identified 21 Platforms used in 50 various use cases classified into 5
    categories: Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, Machine Learning, Computer Vision,
    and Other/Not Identified (Navarro et al., 2020). Jayaraman et al. present SmartFarmNet,
    an IoT platform offering effortless integration of sensors, supporting scalable
    data analytics, and proposing do-it-yourself tools to analyze and visualize data
    (Jayaraman et al., 2016). Codeluppi et al. describe LoRaFarM a general architecture
    modulated depending on the farm’s characteristics and requirements (Codeluppi
    et al., 2020). The monitoring of crops particularly more sensitive to them as
    saffron is crucial. The DIAS Architecture (Triantafyllou et al., 2019) uses different
    ground and leaf sensors to monitor the real-time 24/24 h cultivation process of
    saffron. This data is transmitted by LoRaWAN with IPv6 protocol and MQTT-SN protocol
    to FIWARE’s context broker. The broker manages all networking devices by means
    of sixteen types of messages exchanged following publish-subscribe model. The
    FIWARE NGSI API of oversees the consumption, subscription, and processing of all
    the information collected and its publication. Afterward, the data is stored and
    analyzed with a random forest algorithm which allows extracting information about
    the crop growth and health. Vegetation indexes: Normalized Difference Index (NDI),
    Excess Greenness Index (ExG) are calculated with PiX4D3 image processing tools.
    Object-based image analysis (OBIA) is used to recognize weeds or discriminate
    species. Finally, collected data are categorized and evaluated accordingly with
    vegetation index values, moisture level, and plant developing state by means of
    the Apache Spark framework for the Big Data analysis and Waikato Environment (WEKA)
    a framework specialized in data mining to produce reports and predictions. Decision-making
    is a very important task in the farmers’ activities but with the amount of data
    always increasing, they encounter difficulties on one hand to make proper decision
    about agricultural management and on the other hand translate this data into practical
    knowledge (Zhai et al., 2020). On the other hand, there is a need for platforms
    of the Agricultural Decision Support System (ADSS) to assist farmers to make precise
    decisions evidence-based. For example, Watson Decision Platform for Agriculture
    combines IBM Watson with IoT and Cloud Computing to detect crop disease from UAV
    images. It is also possible to optimize time for crop operations to obtain a better
    price on trading market. The second example is Digital Farming System4 takes advantage
    of computer vision, cloud computing, and AI to propose a better timing for corp
    operations, notify when a crop is infected by any disease. Smart Irrigation Decision
    Support System (SIDSS) is composed on one hand of a set of sensors and a weather
    station and on the other hand a DSS based on two machine learning algorithms.
    Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) to deduct unnecessary variables and Adaptive
    Neuro -Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) used to minimize estimated errors under
    a target threshold (Navarro-Hellin et al., 2016). SIDSS generates planning of
    water amount and time for irrigation. Multi-robot sense-act system (Conesa-Munoz
    et al., 2016) is a planner of aerial and ground vehicles which assign tasks to
    the most appropriate work units. A Harmony Search Algorithm is used to optimize
    plans for UAVs while meta heuristic is running for ground vehicles. 2.3. Analysis
    of previous literature The analysis of existing reviews about smart farming shows
    that applications use whether open source or commercial cloud architecture whether
    developing specific architecture responding to their aims or do not describe their
    storage and processing system. The latter represents more than half of the papers
    and means that some of the processing architectures remain unknown because they
    have never been specifically described and studied. Moreover, the fact that further
    development is being made in architecture may be the fact that commercial platforms
    do not fully address the needs of Agriculture 4.0. This brings us to our research
    questions and their respective motivation: 1. Which storage and processing architectures
    are best suited to Agriculture 4.0 applications and address its particularities?
    Motivation: On one hand generic architectures dedicated or not to IoT are able
    to address a large number of use cases but not specifically the needs of Agriculture
    4.0 exist. On the other hand, researchers develop architectures to address specific
    issues or requirements of use cases. The selection of an adapted architecture
    is crucial for the correct implementation of identified use cases. 2. Can generic
    architectures meet the needs of Agriculture 4.0 application cases? Motivation:
    Agriculture 4.0 has specific requirements described in the introduction section
    which cannot all be addressed by a single classical generic architecture. A comparison
    between the pros and the cons of major generic architecture in the context of
    agriculture 4.0 is important to highlight the choice during the conceptualization
    step. 3. What are the horizontal valuation possibilities that allow the transition
    from research to industrialization? Motivation: The use of architectural solutions
    which can be for example free of fees during the research phase but needs a reimplementation
    caused by license limitations, the cost of the license in the use cases budget,
    etc. The use of products in closed or semi-closed ecosystems is a barrier to the
    research valuation. 4. What are the vertical valuation possibilities to move from
    algorithms trained in the cloud to embedded or autonomous products? Motivation:
    The massive collection of data in the cloud allows to development of complex algorithms
    that need a large amount of computing resources to be elaborated. Afterward, they
    can be compressed, reduced, optimized in order to be deployed in embedded devices
    or divided and establish a collaboration between devices and computing resources
    such as cloud, fog, etc. In order to answer these questions, a review of the literature
    will make it possible to synthesize the different approaches currently used, to
    identify new trends and to consider new lines of research to be explored. 3. Methodology
    In order to address, our first and second research questions, we achieve a systematic
    review to identify generic architectures and combination of architectural elements
    used by researchers to implement concrete use cases. Moreover, we attempt also
    identify commercial products and existing services/ platforms used to implement
    projects in agriculture. 3.1. Systematic review methodology The research questions
    outlined at the end of the related work section has been addressed by combining
    keywords of the first group that refers to architectures (i.e. cloud architecture,
    distributed architecture, big data, Internet of Things, IoT) and of the second
    group contained keywords related to agriculture (i.e. agriculture, smart farming,
    food, agri-food, precision agriculture). Our methodology is based on 3 consecutive
    steps: literature identification, reading literature, and information extraction.
    During the first step, we have read and have collected individual papers based
    on the achieved of previous papers. We have reviewed and completed by a systematic
    survey of white literature (full articles and conference papers) from January
    2016 to December 2020. In addition, we targeted solely and exclusively papers
    written in English and focusing on architecture design have been considered. Our
    bibliographic review was limited to the last 5 years because the rapid development
    of IoT. The systematic review was retrieved from the following major bibliographic
    databases: Scopus (Elsevier), IEEE Xplore Digital Library, Wiley Online Library,
    ACM Digital Library, and Springer. These bibliographic databases have been chosen
    widely covering relevant bibliography and relevant advanced bibliometric features
    especially number of citation and relevant literature suggestion. From these databases
    1058 peer-reviewed articles were retrieved. After their screening 55 papers were
    classified relevant while remaining articles were considerate not relevant and
    therefore excluded from further reading and analysis. The high number of excluded
    papers is due to numerous papers describe i.e. conceptual or theoretic architectures
    which were never implemented, experimental architectures that have been the subject
    of a single article or that have never been proven by other research teams. We
    discard also papers that were not a directly related Big data and the agricultural
    sector. Table 3. Table 3. Keywords used for achieved the systematic review. Area

    (reports, blogs, magazines, and web-items) into our review using Web of Science
    and Google Scholar. Table 4. We discarded papers that were written in other languages

    Three ways of treatment of data are possible. The first process data in real-time
    (left branch identified by (1) on Fig. 1), this one is generally not stored except
    eventually particular or exceptional data in order to enrich the training database
    of artificial intelligence algorithms. This way of data treatment is used for
    example by robots that inspect a crop, discover a pest, and then eliminate it.
    After intervention the value data is near null. The second way is a mixed way
    in which data must be processed as quickly as possible. This one addresses use
    cases where latency required must be comprised between few milliseconds to few
    seconds with data, which conserves a value during a certain period of time. This
    latter justifies its storage according to the use case data management plan that
    predicts the time after which the data will be aggregated and then deleted. This
    way in identified by (2) on Fig. 1. It addresses use cases where all data must
    be processed and then stored for eventual post-processing for example to estimate
    trends of parameters such as the milk quality, volume of palatable species available
    in a pasture. The third way is stored data theirs native format without transformation
    (Identified by (3) on Fig. 1). This way is implemented on use cases that do not
    require real time processing or use cases where the amount data is so important,
    which makes treatment impossible. In this latter case, data are consumed by micro
    services that sample data to exact knowledge. This way is also employed for data
    which have a low value or lose their value so quickly that there is no point in
    transforming them for long-term storage. For instance, a UGV identifies and eliminates
    a pest. The image of the insect is no longer relevant after its elimination. 3.2.
    Architecture comparison criteria In order to compare selected architectures, we
    chose to select 8 criteria:(1) User Proximity expresses the necessity to be close
    to the user. This criterion is important for applications where privacy and response
    time to query are critical. Attribute a value of one * when privacy is not crucial;
    ** when the proximity with user is desirable but not crucial for the development
    of the use case; *** when the user proximity is the corner stone of the application.
    (2) Latency & Jitter criterion describes the importance for the architecture to
    have a minimal latency and jitter. This criterion is particularly important for
    use cases where response time to query in quasi (real time) is required and/or
    time between data production and ingestion by the processing and storage architecture
    is essential. (3) Network stability criterion translate the necessity to have
    a stable network or if is interruption can be tolerated. Use a value of * if the
    use case implemented can tolerate the absence of network during few hours; **
    if few minutes of interruption are tolerable; *** is stability of the network
    is an essential element of the use case. (4) The high throughput criterion expresses
    the capability of the architecture to process quickly a wide amount of data arriving
    at high frequency; Use a value of * if the data arrive mostly at regular intervals;
    a value of ** if the data arrive in bursts, and *** if the data arrive continuously
    at high frequency (10 Hz). (5) Reliability is a criterion that expresses if the
    infrastructure is critical in other terms whether an interruption in infrastructure
    could cause loss of life or not. Attribute a weight of * if the data is not critical
    and potential damages caused by an interruption of the architecture are minors
    or null; ** if potential damageable but tolerable if they occur more than once
    a year; *** if the application cannot tolerate any interruption which would cause
    irreversible damage or loss of human life. (6) Scalability is a criterion that
    expresses the regularity of the evolution in terms of processing and storage during
    a period of one year. If the scalability must be achieved at most once a year
    use a weight of *; if the scalability is achieved at most twice a year use **;
    if the scalability must be achieved more than two times by year use a weight of
    ***. (7) Cost-Effectiveness criterion reflects the need to control infrastructure
    costs. This criterion is more important as the infrastructure is brought to evolve
    both in terms of scale and complexity. Use the weight of * if the project will
    remain in a relatively constant size and do not need to be scaled or dramatically
    modified; Use **, if the project evolves reasonably, i.e. should not undergo significant
    modification more than once a year. Use a weight of *** if the size of the project
    and/ or its complexity need a fine study of cost. (8) Maintainability criterion
    is directly linked to the sustainability of the project. If the sustainability
    of the project will not exceed two years to allocate a point of *; if the life
    of the project is between 2 and 5 years, assign a score of ** beyond 5 years,
    assign ***. 4. Architectures The numerous publications dealing with cloud architectures
    relating to Agriculture 4.0, summarized in Table 2, show that a great deal of
    effort has been devoted to solving a whole range of problems related to many use
    cases. Indeed, a universal and a unique architecture do not exist for IoT applications
    in Smart Agriculture which ensure all needs of all use cases. This is the reason
    why several researchers have proposed various architectures which address specific
    issues of generic architectures. The Fig. 2 gives a global overview on Agriculture
    4.0 organization. Download : Download high-res image (340KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. Global structure of IoT in Agriculture 4.0. 4.1. Central
    Cloud Architectures Central Cloud Architectures are based on two basic architectures
    that are associated or combined in order to form modern architectures. These two
    architectures are: Batch Architecture aims to process an entire dataset in an
    offline mode. For this type of architectures, as long as the processing of the
    dataset is not finished, it continues and produces results only when it has reached
    its end. Generally, the data is selected and distributed to different nodes in
    order to be processed more quickly. When all the treatments are achieved on all
    nodes, the results are sorted and aggregated to obtain a global output. This architecture
    is easily implemented, and the aggregation is done by a framework, but processing
    times can be long, and data extracted during the treatment cannot be processed
    before the end of the treatment in progress. Furthermore, it is possible to increment
    results of previous batch and produce a result that integrates treated data in
    progress. Sallah et al. used a batch architecture to update data within the AquaCrop
    model (FAO) embedded in R-environment in order to facilitate model calibration
    and validation, run and evaluate all fields in a single run (Sallah et al., 2019).
    Nolack Fote et al. presented an architecture to extract knowledge on the long
    term from data in Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) (Fote et al., 2020). Table
    5. Table 5. Pros and Cons of Batch Architecture. Pros Cons - Easy to implement
    and maintain. - Process only data previously stored in another form (file, database,
    etc). - Able to achieve long term treatments (several hours or days). - Processing
    cannot be modified before the end of the treatment. - Reprocessing of old data
    that are easy to achieve. - Results available only at the end of the treatment.
    Real-time Architecture also named Streaming Architecture processes data as it
    arrives, and results are progressively available by opposition to the batch architecture
    where it is not necessary to wait for the end of ingestion of all input data to
    obtain a result. The notion of real-time is strongly dependent on the analysis
    context with a processing time from a few milliseconds to a few minutes. Real-time
    architecture can be implemented in two different ways. On one hand with micro-batch
    in which a tiny amount of data is processed each n seconds and a result is obtained
    at the end of the treatment or on the other hand with a streaming approach in
    which each new data is immediately processed and output is quickly produced. This
    architecture is limited to data flow processing (Miloslavskaya and Tolstoy, 2016).
    Table 6. Table 6. Pros and Cons of Real-time Architecture. Pros Cons - Allow a
    rapid treatment of newly arrived data. - Not able to achieve processing on large
    size of the batch. - Batch processing can be emulated using micro batches but
    not all algorithms can be implemented. - Reprocessing of old data difficult to
    implement. - Easy to implement and maintain. - The need for real-time processing
    involves the use of an estimator rather than the precise values that would take
    too long to be calculated. Various data are produced by different fields or animals
    sensors, vehicles, and robots of the Agriculture 4.0. Afterward, this data must
    be on one hand stored in a raw state and processed in an offline way where long
    and complex treatments can be achieved. On the other hand, data can be processed
    before its storing with offline processing, streaming processing, or a combination
    of these ones. The storage time is extremely variable following the nature of
    the data and their loss of value over time. Offline processing is classically
    used to process images from UAVs, UGVs, or satellites, for example, to determine
    photosynthesis activity, evaluate the canopy development or stocks of palatable
    species available in a pasture, etc. While Streaming processing allows detecting
    anomalies in animals’ behaviors in real-time, or during agricultural operations
    such as the harvesting, disease and pest detection, weeds elimination. In these
    last cases, data is not stored because it quickly loses all value after its ingestion.
    Finally, a combination of the two previous ways i.e. Offline and Streaming processing
    is used to estimate real-time metrics and achieve complex treatments in an offline
    way at the same time. This approach is used by milking robots which detect anomalies
    in the production in real-time while the offline processing estimates the future
    production of each cow based on previous milking (Debauche et al., 2021). Lambda
    architectures are used in systems that need to process and expose quickly massive
    amounts of streaming data. This cloud architecture was proposed by Nathan Marz
    and James Warren (Marz and Warren, 2013) to handle tremendous quantities of data
    and resolve complex problems combining processing large volumes of data (Batch)
    while incorporating the most recent data processed in real-time processes (Singh
    et al., 2019). This architecture is generic, scalable, and fault-tolerant against
    hardware failures and human mistakes. The architecture is composed of three layers:
    (1) batch layer process very large quantities of data by batch; (2) speed layer
    which processes data in real-time and provides views based on the most recent
    data and (3) serving layer responding to queries. Data comes from either a data
    source or a message queue. This paradigm allows executing arbitrary queries over
    any real-time data and is particularly adapted for critical infrastructure and
    health systems (Diaz et al., 2016). Several implementations of Lambda Architecture
    in smart Environment management, big data storage and analytics can be found in
    (Villari et al., 2014). Among the criticisms that have been made against lambda
    architecture is the need to make twice the developments for the real-time branch
    and the batch branch. It is possible to perform a batch processing and in real
    time with flow processing is what the Kappa architecture described below does
    (Kreps, 2014). Fig. 3 Table 7. Download : Download high-res image (116KB) Download

    Pros and Cons of Lambda Architecture. Pros Cons - Process data in real-time or
    in batch processing in separate ways. The reliability of two ways of treatment
    is most costly than other architectures if the two execute the same treatment.
    Among use cases in agriculture 4.0 using a lambda, we would like to highlight:
    Roukh et al. proposed WALLeSMART, a cloud platform based on lambda and specifically
    developed for Smart Farming. This platform implements Apache Kafka to store temporary
    data before their treatment. Apache Hadoop and the programming model Mapreduce
    is used for the batch processing while Apache Storm process data in realtime.
    The originality of this architecture is the coupling of a NoSQL database Apache
    Casandra and a SQL database, PostgreSQL where data is stored in the function of
    its nature. The GraphQL query language allows to querying databases. (Roukh et
    al., 2020, Roukh et al., 2020). Debauche et al. describe a lambda architecture
    for digital phenotyping (Debauche et al., 2020) and farm animals’ behaviors coupled
    with an Application Hosting Architecture based on Apache Mesos and Docker containerization
    to facilitate the deployment of various applications. An API interconnects and
    controls accesses between the Lambda Architecture and the Hosting Application
    Architecture. The Lambda architecture is based on Apache Beam to easily change
    the runner in the function of the technology evolution and improve its sustainability.
    Apache Druid is used to store time series data (Debauche et al., 2019) and metadata
    of data stored in the Datalake based on Apache Hadoop (Debauche et al., 2018).
    A variant of this architecture, named Unified Lambda architecture combines batch
    and stream pipelines which runs concurrently, and then the results are merged
    automatically (Siciliani, 2015). AllJoyn Lambda integrates AllJoyn a framework
    that offers: (1) proximal devices and applications discovering; (2) specific devices
    framework adapting; (3) transmission between devices with Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, etc.;
    (4) interoperability between operating systems; (5) efficient and secure data
    exchange through D-BUS (Villari et al., 2014). The Kappa architecture, proposed
    by Jay Kreps from LinkedIn (Kreps, 2014), simplifies the Lambda architecture by
    combining real-time and batch layers. This cloud architecture differs from the
    Lambda architecture by using a non-permanent storage system of data in an unchangeable
    log file such as system as Apache Spark or Apache Kafka, and consequently allow
    only storage for a limited time in order to allow an eventual reprocessing of
    these data. Batch and Speed Layers are also replaced by a stream processing engine.
    So, the Kappa Architecture is composed of two layers: streaming and serving layers
    and can be implemented with a publish-subscribe messaging like Apache Kafka, which
    facilitates data ingestion. Fig. 4. Download : Download high-res image (121KB)

    The main advantage of this architecture is its simplicity. It avoids having to
    maintain two separate code bases for the batch and speed layers. When processing
    on real-time and historical data are the same, a Kappa Architecture must be used.
    Fast Data Architecture is a variant of Kappa Architecture in which the data are
    no longer read from files but from an additional mechanism like Kafka that captures
    multiple streams combines them before being processed by the speed layer (Lakhe,
    2016). Persico et al. achieved a benchmark of Lambda and Kappa architectures and
    show that Lambda outperforms Kappa for social networks data (YFCC100M) processing
    (Persico et al., 2018). Table 8. Table 8. Pros and Cons of Kappa Architecture.
    Pros Cons - Very efficient for real-time processing thanks to in-memory processing.
    - Batch processing emulates thanks to micro-batch treated via the real-time way.
    - Optimized cost because allows real-time and batch processing. - Not able to
    process large batch size. - Must be finely tuned from data to obtain the best
    performances (Nkamla Penka et al., 2021). Other Architectures derived or inspired
    of the previous architectures have been developed to address specific problems
    such as (1) SMACK (Estrada and Ruiz, 2016) which attempts to propose an optimal
    architecture with fixed components; (2) Liquid (Fernandez et al., 2015) is an
    architecture which provide low latency, incremental processing, high available
    with isolated resource, and able to store high throughput data at low operational
    cost architecture; (3) Butterfly (Lakhe, 2016) proposes to unify batch, speed
    and serving layers in a unique platform in which data are organized as a collection
    of three types of abstractions; (4) Zeta (Scott, 2015) which integrates a lambda
    architecture with business aspect of the enterprise; (5) BRAID (Giebler et al.,
    2018) is a hybrid processing architecture where all coming data and configuration
    file of processing, and eventually processing results written back are stored
    in a shared storage; (6) IoT-a (Hausenblas, 2014) is composed of three blocks:
    Ad-hoc queries, a Database, and a Distributed File System; (7) Polystore (Meehan
    et al., 2016) implements a multiple database system PostgreSQL, SciDB and Accumulo
    because a database alone cannot store all types of data efficiently. Table 9.

    analysis of the literature achieved shows that two major generic architectures:
    Kappa and Lambda allows to address of various use cases and are widely implemented
    and proven in other domains of the Internet of Things. The Lambda is more expensive
    to implement than the Kappa because of the need to maintain two separate parallel
    processing branches for stream processing and batch processing. It is interesting
    if different processing are carried out on the two processing branches. Otherwise,
    a Kappa architecture with a single processing branch that processes both the streams
    and the data in batches is more appropriate in most cases because it is cheaper
    and easier to maintain because a single code performs both types of processing
    (stream and batch). Looking at our first two research questions, we observe that
    Lambda and Kappa cloud architectures are efficient but these architectures alone
    operating in central cloud cannot address, for example, use cases where very low
    latencies are required. They will have to be hybridized and completed to address
    these particular cases. Two possibilities are available to us. The first way consists
    in associating several specialized cloud platforms to make it possible to obtain
    greater genericity or at least to better cover a domain. The second consists of
    supplementing the cloud-centric architectures that we have just mentioned with
    other architectural elements in order to better address the specific needs of
    Agriculture 4.0. 4.2. Extension of the cloud paradigm With the increase of the
    amount of data produced by the myriad of connected things, the amount of data
    to process, to transfer by network, and to treat in the cloud computing have called
    into question the architecture of storage and data processing. To solve the problem,
    two ways have been proposed, the first is Multi-Cloud Computing, the objective
    of which is to ensure redundancy in order to improve latency. The second is the
    Federated Cloud with the aim of pooling resources for better use. Multi-Cloud
    Computing (MCC) (Manyika and Chui, 2015) is an extension of Cloud Computing paradigm
    where services are distributed on multi-clouds. In this architecture the workflow
    is distributed entirely in the cloud, data redundancy is also verified. One advantage
    of the MCC is the high recovery rate but it has the same disadvantages as Cloud
    Computing, along with complexity and portability issues. Kazim et al. proposed
    a framework to deliver IoT services and establish cooperation across multi-clouds.
    An authentication allows communicating cloud to authenticate each other cloud
    dynamically. While a service selects the best IoT service matching with user requirements
    among multiple clouds and taking into account the SLA parameters agreed between
    the user and the provider (Kazim et al., 2018). Federated Cloud (FC) aggregates
    resources of multiple cloud providers to improve users’ freedom and allows users
    to choose where they want to deploy their applications. A Federated cloud can
    be defined as a voluntary collaboration between heterogeneous cloud providers
    collaborating to share their own unused resources. Using a cloud federation helps
    to ensure service performance during load ups with resources borrowed from other
    clouds. In addition, the geographical dispersion of the installations makes it
    possible to migrate to another installation and to guarantee the service in case
    of breakdown. A unified interface allows to use it an easy consultation of the
    offered services. Finally, thanks to the dynamic distribution of the load, it
    is possible to bring the treatment closer to the user and consequently improve
    the Quality of Service (Assis and Bittencourt, 2016). Cloud federations include
    European Federated Cloud (Sipos et al., 2013), Massachusetts Open Cloud, Mosaic
    (Petcu et al., 2013), IEEE P2302, and Open stack Keystone. Drakos et al. described
    agINFA, a common research data infrastructure for agriculture, food and the environment
    using EGI Federated Cloud. This infrastructure allows to partner to share research
    infrastructure components, APIs, a registry of web-based information service and
    dataset for agriculture (Drakos et al., 2015). 4.3. Distributed architectures
    The post-cloud approaches allow to improve latency and jitter for immobile entities
    but do not provide an answer adapted for mobile devices and local awareness. The
    large amount of data generated at the edge has increased the speed of data transportation
    that is becoming the bottleneck for the cloud-based computing paradigms (Shi et
    al., 2016). Moreover, the treatment of data in the cloud does not offer any guarantees
    about privacy, on the response time and real-time actuation because the huge number
    of devices increases the latency and jitter. Moreover, the mobility of devices
    and power constraints makes the communicaion difficult with the cloud all the
    time (Botta et al., 2016, Zhou et al., 2017). The aim has been to bring data storage
    and processes data, filtering, and data analysis closer to data-producing objects
    to limit bandwidth consumption and relieve the cloud. Three major paradigms have
    been proposed to address these issues and bring cloud computing-like capabilities
    to the edge of the network. All these infrastructures manage mechanisms of Virtual
    Machine (VM) or containers migration and adjust if needed, the provisioning of
    capabilities where users are located. Moreover, the three paradigms allow the
    creation of federated infrastructures in which can coexist multiple edge infrastructures
    which can exchange information and services (Roman et al., 2018). 4.4. Elements
    of distributed architectures In order to always bring closer, the processing capacities
    of intermediate processing have been set up between connected objects and the
    cloud at the network level (Fog Computing) and at the level of telephony providers
    (Mobile Edge Computing). Fog Computing is a concept created by Cisco Systems and
    is an extension of the cloud computing paradigm (Munir et al., 2017) in which
    computation, storage and network services are provided between end devices and
    cloud/ classify and analyze the raw IoT data streams at near-edge and edge network
    level (Cisco, 2018). Fog nodes are either physical components such as gateways,
    switches, routers, servers etc. or virtual components such as virtualized switches,
    virtual machines, cloudlets, etc.; deployed following private, community, public
    or hybrid. Private nodes are reserved for a single organization, community nodes
    are used by a community, public nodes are dedicated to the general public, and
    hybrid mix the third previous modalities (Uehara, 2017). This paradigm allows
    to limit data transfer on cloud, reduce latency (Sethi and Sarangi, 2017), and
    jitter thanks to a three-tier architecture (Roman et al., 2018). In this hierarchical
    architecture, the analysis of local information is achieved at the low level and
    the coordination and global analysis are performed at the top level. The Fog Computing
    supports mobile devices (Sethi and Sarangi, 2017), response time in real-time
    or predictable latency (Lopez et al., 2015), bandwidth saving, an improving of
    security and resilience, scalability, multi-tenancy, advanced analytics, and automation
    (Byers, 2017), cost-effective services (Yang, 2017). Fog Computing allows also
    the federation of fog infrastructures in order to allow cooperation between multiple
    organizations (Roman et al., 2018). Furthermore, the architecture is optimized
    for a use case and applications which must run on them (Byers, 2017). Fog Computing
    differentiates from cloud computing mainly by the proximity with end-users at
    the edge of networks localized or distributed geographically consisting in many
    relatively less resourceful (Munir et al., 2017). In addition to network equipment,
    fog computing can also be carried out in cloudlets and micro data centers. Cloudlets
    were proposed to address the end-to-end responsiveness between mobile devices
    and associated clouds. Cloudlets (Mach and Becvar, 2017) are micro data center
    geographically deployed in vicinity of End Users. This mobility-enhanced small-scale
    cloud data center is composed of computers with high computation power which provide
    both computation resources and storage. Cloudlet is much more agile (highly dynamic
    provisioning) than cloud due to user mobility churning. The mobility of users
    implies the use of a virtual machine to rapidly instantiate compute-intensive
    and latency-intensive applications and migrate the offloaded services between
    different cloudlet in the function of the user mobility. Cloudlets must be firstly
    discovered, selected among several candidates before starting provisioning. At
    the end of the session, the instance is destroyed (Ai et al., 2018). Cloudlets
    are accessed by mobile user equipment via Wi-Fi imply a high latency caused by
    the network and switch between mobile network and Wi-Fi and by consequence Quality
    of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) are hard to fulfill (Mach and
    Becvar, 2017, Manyika and Chui, 2015). Moreover, Cloudlets cover usually a small
    region and do not offer any guarantee on ubiquitous computing and scalability
    in service (Manyika and Chui, 2015). MicroData Centers (MDCs) were proposed by
    Microsoft Research. It is designed to extend cloud data centers as cloudlets.
    MDCs are enclosures contemning all types of equipments (computing, storage, network)
    needed to provide a secure computing environment in order to run customs applications
    requiring low latency. MDCs are also well adapted to provide processing resources
    to end devices on battery or with limited computing capabilities. MDCs can be
    adapted in function network bandwidth and user needs thanks to certain flexibility
    in terms of latency and scalability of the capacity (Wang et al., 2020). Guardo
    et al. proposed a framework composed of two fog layers respectively filtering
    and aggregating data, and clustering analysis, actuation management, and alert.
    The framework aims to improve computational load balancing between fog and cloud
    in order to reduce the amount of data to transmit to the cloud, reduce the waiting
    time for the user (Guardo et al., 2018). Taneja et al. proposed a SmartHerd an
    IoT platform dedicated to smart dairy farming based on microservices and Fog-assisted.
    The IoT gateway received data from transceivers, archived data aggregation, preprocessing,
    classification, feature selection, send critical alerts to farmers, and transmit
    data to IBM Watson IoT platform via MQTT protocol. In the IBM Watson IoT platform,
    a broker picks up data and store them in a Cloudant NoSQL JSON Database. Python
    Virtual Machine and Java Virtual Machine were used as containers equivalent for
    microservices deployment at fog level (Taneja et al., 2019). Sharofidinov et al.
    described a 4 layers architecture (Sensors Layers, Fog Layer, Network/Cloud Layer,
    and Application Layer) based on LoRa to monitor and predict the state of a greenhouse
    from a random forest algorithm. In the Sensor Layer, sensors acquire temperature,
    soil and air humidity, CO2 rate, and illumination connected to TTGO LoRa32 (ESP32
    with LoRa Sx1276 chip) which are transmitted to the gateway by LoRa. At Fog Layer,
    preliminary analysis with Machine Learning algorithm, diagnosis of sensor status,
    and data compression are achieved. In the Network/Cloud Layer, compressed data
    are transmitted in order to be deeply analyzed and stored. Finally, in the Application
    Layer, analyzed data are converted in readable form to allows the monitoring and
    the control of the greenhouse (Sharofidinov et al., 2020). Table 10. Table 10.
    Pros and Cons of Fog Computing. Pros Cons - Fast response time in avoiding transmission
    of data to the cloud (Sharofidinov et al., 2020). - Failure or outage of the gateway
    can defeat thousands of devices. - The local storage and processing capabilities
    prevent data loss and outages when the Internet connectivity is limited (Sharofidinov
    et al., 2020). - The limited processing and memory capacities do not allow the
    deployment of algorithms requiring significant resources or the carrying out of
    long-term processing. - Sensitive data can be filtered locally. In this case,
    only the data model is moved in the cloud (Sharofidinov et al., 2020), and data
    validation, compression, and encryption. - Gateway at fog level ensure the compatibility
    between old and modern devices (Sharofidinov et al., 2020) and various protocols
    for communication. - Improve the resilience thanks to the decentralization of
    the treatment on network devices (Sharofidinov et al., 2020). Mobile Edge Computing
    (MEC) was proposed by ETSI and is deployed by telecommunication companies on the
    edge of the network, which is characterized by ultra-low latency and high bandwidth.
    (Roman et al., 2018, Zhou et al., 2017). At the very beginning, Mobile Edge Computing
    (MEC) aims to bring real-time, high-bandwidth, and low-latency access to dependent
    applications known as cloud computing capabilities; in addition to, information
    technology (IT) features of cloud computing. MEC is distributed at the edge of
    the network. In fact, a new class of cloud-native applications are easily accessible,
    because of the close position of Edge Computing to the end user and apps. Also,
    it allows network operators to open their environment to a new ecosystem. As a
    result of this significant change, MEC application can be used in LTE macro base
    stations (eNBs), 3G radio network controllers (RNCs), Wi-Fi access points, edge
    network routers, and enterprise edge servers. MEC platform contains two main hosting
    infrastructures. The first is formed by hardware resources and a high-resolution
    screen. The second is composed of manageable applications with numerous capabilities
    such as the application of virtualization manager and platform services (Zhou
    et al., 2017). An important challenge for the MEC is the VM migration that must
    optimize the tradeoff between migration gain and migration cost and select optimal
    location (Ai et al., 2018). Tran et al. investigated the collaborative Mobile
    Edge Computing in 5G Networks. MEC extends processing and storage resources at
    the edge of the Radio Access Network (RAN) while C-RAM is based on centralization
    of the base Station by means of the virtualization. Authors argue that both technologies
    are complementary in the 5G ecosystem (Tran et al., 2017). Fig. 5 Table 11. Download

    Mobile Edge Computing General Scheme. Table 11. Pros and Cons of MEC. Pros Cons
    - Reduces needs in connection, response time delay, the congestion of other parts
    of the network (Valecce et al., 2019). - Usable only for devices connected in
    Wi-Fi or 3GPP. - Use low level message from Wi-Fi to determine the location of
    each device (Location awareness) (Valecce et al., 2019). - MEC Server can be used
    as power open to applications and services (Valecce et al., 2019). Fan et al.
    combined MEC with data link management, combining with the industrial CAN bus
    characteristics to monitor water. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) Altera
    implementing the AVALON bus was used to implement the system. Moreover, they propose
    a protocol to model random network disturbances and an online task offloading
    algorithm based on the monitoring of task execution (Fan and Gao, 2018). Valecce
    et al. proposed a 5G-robotics reference architecture for smart agriculture composed
    of UAV-Based Monitoring and connectivity, Machinery automation, and MEC Applications
    Server. UAVs/satellites capture high-resolution images during patrolling, which
    coupled with sensors data trigger a precise crop management. UAVs can also collect
    data or serve as a 5G mobile station. In field, image processing coupled with
    sensors data can be used for decision making. MEC allows to process gigabyte/s
    of data produced by autonomous vehicles and robots (Valecce et al., 2019). Table

    ** ** Maintainability ** ** The development of fog computing and its counterpart
    for MEC wireless networks allow processing capabilities closer to users to improve
    response time but with lower computational capacities compared to the cloud. There
    are inherently two questions: Which association strategies to use between the
    cloud and the other levels of processing in the network? How to distribute the
    load between these different levels: local (Edge), network (Fog), and Cloud processing.
    4.5. Collaborative computing strategies In order to address, our fourth research
    question, we try to identify different possibilities to compose architectural
    elements. Indeed, different collaboration strategies between the different levels
    of data processing (cloud, fog, edge) can be considered depending on the particularities
    of the use cases. In the next paragraphs, we describe possibilities of collaboration
    between different treatment entries, and we illustrate each one with few examples.
    Edge-Cloud aims to connect devices directly with the cloud that performs data
    processing. This strategy is often used by UAVs and UGVs which preprocess data
    before its transfer to the cloud because image treatment needs processing power
    and storage capabilities. The default of this approach is that the delay of the
    whole process from data transfer via high throughput wireless or cellular protocol
    to the transmission of processing results cannot be guaranteed because of the
    fluctuation of data rates linked to wireless networks (Wang et al., 2020). The
    processing of data can be achieved in an online mode with a real-time data transmission
    and processing by a stream, Lambda, Kappa or derived architecture of these one.
    An offline strategy with a data transfer by means of a computer and Internet connection
    on the cloud after the UAV fly and processing with a Batch, a Lambda, or a Kappa
    architecture or a derived architecture of these one is also possible. This latter
    costly avoid data transmission and is suitable for monitoring crops or livestock
    that do not require direct action. Agriculture 4.0 uses in particular Unmanned
    Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with various sensors in order to improve the time
    of data collection, in reducing the cost of acquisition compared to traditional
    field phenotyping technologies. According to Tang et al., edge-cloud is majorly
    used in smart robots to reduce complexity (Tang et al., 2021). Indeed, the images
    of drones to be used must be orthorectified and assembled. These operations require
    significant resources in terms of computing power, and memory. All these collected
    data must be rapidly processed, analyzed, and visualized. Agroview (Ampatzidis
    et al., 2020) is a platform that developed a cloud and AI-based application to
    survey and assess the agriculture field, deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS).
    A website allows the upload of images or existing orthomosaic, the consultation
    for each tree field e.g., number of trees, tree gaps count, area of the field,
    the average height of trees, canopy area, etc. The website also allows the stitching
    of an orthomosaic and the generation of a Digital Surface Model (DSM). A tree
    detection algorithm developed in C allows the detection of individual tree and
    tree gap, and estimate tree parameters such as height, canopy area, health/stress
    estimation. The pipeline of treatment uses a Faster R-CNN to detect the region
    of interest (ROI) and the ResNet101 network allows to detect trees and row orientation.
    Afterward, the Yolo classifier using Darknet19 was applied along each row of trees
    to obtain a more precise detection. Debauche et al. presented an Edge-Cloud architecture
    for the analysis of cattle behavior from 9-DOF IMU data sampled at 100 Hz and
    GPS location sampled at 0.5 Hz that is then processed with an algorithm proposed
    by (Andriamandroso et al., 2017) in batch processing (Debauche et al., 2019, Debauche
    et al., 2020). Popescu et al. proposed an integrated system UAV-WSN-IoT where
    WSN data is collected by UAVs before their transmission to the ground control
    station and afterward to the cloud (Popescu et al., 2020). Debauche et al. proposed
    an architecture for scientific research dedicated to honeybee Colony Collapse
    Disorder. In this architecture, data is compressed on LoPy at the edge level before
    its collection by the LoRaWan gateway and its transmission to the Lambda architecture
    in the cloud where it is processed (Debauche et al., 2018). Edge-Fog aims to connect
    devices directly with network components such as gateways, routers that perform
    data processing. The major benefits of this approach are an optimization of the
    bandwidth, a reduction of traffic and latency, a better privacy, and an improved
    security level (Badidi, 2020). Fog nodes collect, aggregate, filter, encrypt,
    compress, and process IoT data (Gupta et al., 2020). This way is used for example
    by milking robots where data are processed by a computer close the robot and can
    be viewed remotely by the farmer. 5G also promotes mobile edge computing (MEC).
    Debauche et al. presented an AI-IoT architecture for the deployment of Artificial
    intelligence algorithms and Internet of things services at fog level using docker
    containerization and Kubernetes orchestration. This architecture has been developed
    to automatically deploy AI algorithms after retraining when performances (accuracy,
    recall, precision) are improved (Debauche et al., 2020). Debauche et al. proposed
    a Multi-Agent System (MAS) deployed at edge level allowing to control abnormal
    data present in sensed data and eventually cure this data when it is possible.
    The MAS simultaneously manages pivot irrigation, plant diseases and pests'' detection,
    and their curation. The data is partially transmitted to the cloud to improve
    the detection of diseases and pests and retrain AI algorithms before their redeployment
    at the edge level (Debauche et al., 2020). Debauche et al. described a fog architecture
    in which a Gated Recursive Unit (GRU) algorithm is deployed on NVIDIA Jetson Nano
    for real-time poultry monitoring. GRU is simpler than LSTM algorithm. GRU is built
    to avoid varnish gradient problems. Periodically data is transmitted to the user
    interface implemented in NodeJS in the cloud (Debauche et al., 2020). Edge-Fog-Cloud
    is a paradigm in which data are partially processed in the fog and more complex
    treatments are achieved in the cloud. This way is used by wireless Sensor and
    Actuator Network (WSAN), which passes through a gateway that provides interconnection
    between the devices and the backhaul which transit then data to the cloud. However,
    the right balance between cloud and edge/fog computing is required (Badidi, 2020)
    based on available resources and whether or not the task is sensitive. Taneja
    et al. used a strategy Edge-Fog-Cloud to develop a detection system of lameness
    for cattle. The data from the pedometer is transmitted to the Fog node by means
    of a Long-Range proprietary protocol at 433 MHz on a distance of 2 km. Fog node
    stores in local database, preprocess and aggregates them. Fog node communicates
    with IBM Watson IoT Platform with MQTT protocol. Arriving data are picked up and
    stored in Cloudant NoSQL JSON database in IBM cloud. A mobile application synchronizes
    data with PouchDB, its local database via the REST API of Cloudant database when
    an Internet connection is available (Taneja et al., 2020). Alonso et al. presented
    Global Edge Computing Architecture (GECA), a modular tiered architecture (IoT
    Layer, Edge Layer, Business Solution Layer) to monitor dairy and feed grain state
    in real-time. In this architecture, a Distributed Ledger Technologies provides
    security from IoT Layer to Business Solution Layer. In the IoT layer, a set of
    agents call oracles to verify incoming data and afterward calculate hash of data
    with SHA-256 which is stored in the blockchain to verify the non-alteration of
    data. In parallel data is encrypted with the RSA algorithm and then sent to the
    Edge layer. The Edge Layer is responsible of the preprocessing of data and filters
    out data transmitted to the cloud. It enables also various data analyses. In the
    business Solution Layer, final storage, authentication, analysis for decision
    making is achieved. It provides also a knowledge base and APIs (Alonso et al.,
    2020). Edge-Edge is a paradigm in which devices interact to collaborate, exchange,
    and process data. The deployment of the 5G network allows the interconnection
    between UAVs and UGVs/ agricultural machinery (Tang et al., 2021). This high throughput
    network will allow to developping new collaboration between UAVs/ UGVs and agricultural
    machinery, for example, a drone will provide information to a harvester to avoid
    a non-desirable area of the field or avoid obstacles. A fleet of drones can also
    collaborate to coordinate their operations on the field between them of course
    subject to availability in rural areas, a transmission network with sufficient
    bandwidth and short-latency or capabilities to communicate between them in direct
    connection or in a mesh network. (Tang et al., 2021). Four cooperation strategies
    have been identified, two of which use the cloud, namely Fog-Cloud and Edge-Cloud.
    The other two remaing, do not involve the cloud; namely, Fog-Edge, and Edge-Edge
    cloud. The first two strategies complement the cloud to help us to address issues
    relating to production data and trade secrets, network congestion, and response
    times. The other two strategies do without the cloud and therefore assume that
    the devices/ vehicles have sufficient capacity to perform the processing. Despite
    these cooperation strategies between different levels of processing, some questions
    remain unanswered: How to store all the raw data when the data is so important
    that it would take colossal means to process it? What about security? How to organize
    the distribution of tasks between the edge, the fog, and the cloud? How to ensure
    operation and/ or treatment when network connections are intermittent or faulty?
    How to improve the maintainability of these architectures? These are the questions
    that the new trends that we describe in the next paragraph attempt to answer.
    5. New trends In this section, we present two emerging architectures not based
    on the batch or/and real-time architectures or their derivatives. Afterward, we
    describe Osmotic and Dew computing as two new paradigms, which allow us to respectively
    choose where the processing must be achieved and improve the user experience.
    New trends are additional elements that allow enriching the analysis of Section
    4 in order to address the third research question. The Microservices Architecture
    (MA) is a new system software design pattern that divides complex monolithic application
    in micro services dedicated for a single function. Microservice addresses defects
    of monolithic applications in which improving of service performance needs multiple
    deployment; a change in a function can affect all the monolith due to high dependencies
    between components; all the monolith uses a sole technology stack and development
    standards which limits possibilities to solve problems of physical heterogeneity.
    The advantages of this architecture are using a lightweight communication mechanism
    to interact between services with a minimal overload (Sun et al., 2017). The design
    proposed by (Sun et al., 2017) is composed of 8 microservices (Geo, Security,
    Tenant, Devices, Big Data, Automation, AI, and Application) and a core service
    coordinating. These services provide respectively: (1) Geo, a GIS layer to render
    data; (2) Security, user/group/role management, access control, administration,
    and authentication mechanism; (3) support for multiple IoT applications with a
    single core; (4) device plugins and communication protocols for sensing and actuating;
    (5) scalable persistence to store data; (6) process, analyze events and notify
    appropriate participant; (7) Artificial intelligence tools for IoT big data; (8)
    components to interact with client interfaces; (9) support for data exchanging
    by message with the devices. Authors argue that their approach is more flexible,
    scalable and platform-independent. Fig. 6 Table 13. Download : Download high-res
    image (189KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Microservices Architecture
    General Scheme. Table 13. Pros and Cons of Microservices Architecture. Pros Cons
    - Fractionating of monoliths facilitates the maintainability and scalability of
    low coupled microservices. - Need to find microservice adapted with needs. - The
    discovery of micro-services allows the development new applications more easily
    than with monoliths. Fraction complex monolith is not easy. - More resilient,
    when a microservice is down, all others continue to function. Bixio et al. proposed
    a stream processing architecture event-driven based on proxy, adapter, and data
    processing microservices. This architecture extends the IoT platform Senseioty
    and using the Java OSGi framework (Bixio et al., 2020). The Data Lake Architecture
    (DLA) (Fang, 2015, Miloslavskaya and Tolstoy, 2016) enables the storage of large
    volumes of data of all types: raw data in its native format, structured, semi-structured,
    in a cost-effective manner. In this architecture, data is stored in its native
    format until it needs to process them by engines (Miloslavskaya and Tolstoy, 2016),
    which allows a fast transformation and refinement of stored data regardless of
    the amount of data stored. The architecture makes it possible to consume all types
    of data (logs, web services, database, files, etc.); different ingestion systems
    consume the data and then stored it in data repository. Once the data is stored,
    query systems can query the data lake. This architecture is considered in the
    corporate world as an evolution of existing architectures. The advantage of the
    Data Lake architecture is that it can easily and inexpensively store large amounts
    of data. It is particularly well suited to storing data in a typical format. In
    Enterprise Data Lakes are used; in addition to, data warehouses. Data lakes are,
    however, unsuitable for assessing data quality, data can be placed in data lakes
    without content control, and performance is also poorer than on specially designed
    and optimized infrastructures. The Lakehouse is a variant of the Data Lake where
    storages of data are generally achieved with Hadoop in the data lake is replaced
    by a distributed storage such as Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage,
    and analysis are directly achieved by infrastructure managed by Cloud Service
    Providers such as Amazon Athena, EMR, or Databricks, Google Data proc, Azure HDInsight.

    Data lake and Lakehouse General Scheme. It crucial in agriculture to explore datasets
    from different sources. The data lake is indicated to manage the complexity of
    agricultural ecosystems and centralized all data sources to find new correlations.
    (Madera et al., 2017). A data lake provides views based on metadata. It is nevertheless
    necessary to have advanced analysis tools for predictive modeling and statistical
    analysis. López et al. used a data lake to achieve the fusion of data from different
    domains in smart the agriculture context (López et al., 2020). Gallinucci et al.
    (Gallinucci et al., 2019, Gallinucci et al., 2020) present an innovative architecture
    3 tiers architecture, called Mo.Re.Farming (MOnitoring and REmote system for a
    more sustainable FARMING) based on a data lake using Apache Hadoop and storing
    structured, semi-structured, and unstructured raw data, and in which subsequent
    processing and enrichment activities are separated. An Operational Data Store
    (ODS) using PostgreSQL with PostGIS to stores structured and detailed data and
    address limitations of big data solutions in properly handling continuous field
    geographic data. Finally, a spatial cube enables Spatial OnLine Analytical Processing
    (SOLAP). Neves et al. described an architecture in which raw data is stored in
    a datalake. Then, ETLs transforms data to be storable in a database. The data
    is enriched thanks to a knowledge base and its exploration by data mining algorithms
    (machine learning). The result of processing is filtered to improve the quality
    of structured data (Neves and Cruvinel, 2020). Table 14. Table 14. Pros and Cons
    of Datalake/DataHouse. Pros Cons - Store the data in its raw form without transforming
    them immediately. - Availability of results depend of the ingesting speed by processing
    services. - Allow store massive low-value data without investing energy to transform
    and store them in a database. - Data analysis by sampling does not give exact
    results but is estimated. - Provides a solution to situations where the volume
    of data is so large that it can no longer be processed immediately - Data House
    may be limited by the services offered by cloud providers for data analysis. Osmotic
    Computing (OC) (Villari et al., 2016) is a new paradigm inspired by the chemical
    osmosis process that corresponds to a dynamic and bidirectional flow of microservices
    between cloud and edge. OC exploits container-based solution to allows an automatic
    deployment of portable, mobile, and cross-platform microservices between Edge
    and cloud levels (Villari et al., 2016). Osmotic computing introduces the concept
    of Micro Elements (MELS) which decouples user data and applications in Micro Services
    (MS) i.e. a docker container and Micro Data (MD) i.e. an entity self-explicative
    in JSON. MS associates one operating system (Micro Operation Service) with an
    application (Micro User Service) while MD associates a microservice configuration
    (Micro Operational Data) and User data (Micro User Data). These MELS can be deployed
    on Microcontrollers (MCU) or Multiprocessor (MPU) (Villari et al., 2017). Table
    15. Table 15. Pros and Cons of Osmotic Computing. Pros Cons - Micro Element (microservice  +
    micro dataset) easy to migrate between fog and cloud. - All datasets are not decomposable
    in micro dataset. The bidirectional migration of microservices between Edge and
    Cloud must, on one hand, avoid application breakdown and QoS degradation and on
    the other hand manage them dynamically, in high heterogeneously physical resources
    context, in the function of infrastructure and applications requirements (Villari
    et al., 2016). Carnevale et al. have applied osmotic computing to the Internet
    of Things by means of a distributed multi-agent system. Each agent is self-orchestrated,
    works independently, and manages the workflow as a composition of MELs. It monitors
    the overloading state of microservices by means of response time metric and decides
    to relocate them to another agent based on a Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm
    or Time Series Analysis (Carnevale et al., 2019). Fig. 8, Fig. 9. Download : Download

    deploy lightweight micro services at edge level while complex micro services are
    deployed at fog/cloud level, and balance load between edge, fog, and cloud. (Maksimović,
    2018). Morshed et al. proposed to use OC to distribute Deep Learning across edge,
    cloud, and mobile edge in a holistic way (Morshed et al., 2017). However, Kaur
    et al. in their Osmotic Computing applications survey have identified the need
    of standardization in terms of infrastructure deployment and micro-services distribution.
    The orchestration is crucial to manage efficient services. Security remains an
    important challenge because the service migration is supported by different layers
    (Kaur et al., 2020). Dew Computing (DC) (Skala et al., 2015) allows to further
    improve response times by pushing from Central cloud to end-users, computing applications,
    data, and low-level services. Client microcomputers are used to store a part of
    the data locally in the background and to limit access to the cloud, reduce network
    dependency and drastically reduce processing cost (Skala et al., 2015). Dew computing
    is the additional piece of cloud computing. It is mainly composed of a wide range
    of heterogeneous devices and varied equipment ranging from smartphones to smart
    sensors (Wang, 2016). DC is highly and effectively capable in terms of scalability
    and ability to perform sophisticated operations and to process numerous applications
    and tools. Additionally, the equipment of DC is ad hoc programmable and self-adaptive.
    They have the qualifications to running the process within another process in
    a distributed way without a focal communication network (Skala et al., 2015).
    Applications running in the on-premises computers provide services to users and/or
    devices independently of the cloud but collaborating with cloud services (Wang,
    2016). DC can provide access web fraction without Internet connection (WiD), Storage
    in dew has a cloud copy (STiD), Local database has a cloud backup (DBiD), Software
    ownership and settings have a cloud copy (SiD), SDK and projects have a cloud
    copy (PiD), On-premises computer settings and data have a cloud copy (IaD), Other
    services (DiD) (Wang, 2016). The Fig. 10 presents the dew computing in the general
    scheme Cloud-Fog-Edge Computing. Table 16. Download : Download high-res image

    Table 16. Pros and Cons of Dew Computing. Pros Cons - Allows access to a local
    copy of data when the connection is unavailable. - Replication of data is bandwidth-consuming.
    - Improve the reliability and the false tolerance. - Difficult to exploit if bandwidth
    is insufficient. Rajakaruna et al. presented a dew architecture based on a drone
    to retrieve and process data, manage WSN, and play the role of dew server. The
    drone communicates with sensors, and actuators with BLE protocol, collect, store
    data, and then when the drone is at the docking station it sends data to the cloud
    (Rajakaruna et al., 2018). Grovers et al. described a reliable and fault-tolerant
    architecture at 4 levels (edge, dew, fog, and cloud) in which sensed data is replicated
    at edge, fog and cloud level in order to take over the application’s control when
    a server is failed. In their architecture, dew servers are closed and linked with
    sensors producing data. The fault tolerance is ensured by mobile agents working
    as a resource exchanging the application and link-state information between us,
    and the network monitoring agent (Grover and Garimella, 2018). The Blockchain
    is a distributed digital ledger of transaction distributed maintained by a network
    of multiple computing nodes. This ledger can be deployed among the IoT nodes network
    (Bermeo-Almeida et al., 2018). In the blockchain, transactions namely blocks are
    managed by a specific software platform ensuring the data transmission, processing
    and storage, and its representation in a human-readable form allowing a consistent
    view and a consensus between the participants (Kamilaris et al., 2019). Different
    mechanisms of consensus whose two main ones are the “Proof of Work (PoW)” and
    the Proof of Stake (PoS). The PoW requires the solving of difficult computational
    tasks before validating transactions and the adding of the block in the blockchain.
    In this approach “miners” are in competition to be the first and obtain the rewards,
    which has an impact on the environment, need expending large a amount of computer
    and energy, and involves a risk of centralization. While the PoS approach, “validators”
    are randomly selected with a probability which depends on the amount of stake
    held. At the end of the validation process, it earns a fee. Other less used consensus
    mechanisms exist such as (1) Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET) in which each node generates
    a random wait time and goes to sleep for that specified duration; (2) Simplified
    Byzantine Fault Tolerance (SBFT), an improvement of Practical Byzantine Fault
    Tolerance (PBFT) specifically designed for blockchain in which each new block
    is maintained by a delegation of nodes with increasing authority. Each one uses
    the internal time to decide when actions must be done; (3) Proof of Authority
    (PoA) in which approved accounts process to the automated validation of transaction
    and blocks. Table 17. Table 17. Pros and Cons of Blockchain. Pros Cons - Data
    distributed (Alonso et al., 2020). - Energy consumption for the complex signature
    verification process can be important. - Immutable, durable, verifiable, secure,
    and transparent (Alonso et al., 2020). - Not adapted to store images, video. -

    Fig. 11. Blockchain General Scheme. The block chain is mainly used in Agriculture
    to make the data of the supply chain transparent and open (Bermeo-Almeida et al.,
    2018) and ensure the complete traceability of the food chain from the fork to
    the plate. The block chain allows to record information about: (1) Transactions
    between provider and farmer as well as information relating to the crops, material
    and chemical products; (2) The farm, cultivation practices and management, animals
    feeding, and complementary information such as weather conditions, animals welfare,
    diseases, treatment, etc; (3) Information about factory and its equipment, the
    processing method, batch numbers but also financial transactions with producers
    and distributors; (4) Warehousing, storage conditions (temperature, humidity),
    methods of transport, transit time, and all financial transactions between the
    distributors and retailers; (5) food items information such as quantity available,

    address some challenges of IoT such as decentralization, data anonymization, and
    security. Moreover, it allows faster and efficient operations, to improve reliability
    and scalability (Bermeo-Almeida et al., 2018). The analysis of new trends shows
    that: (1) Micro service architecture allows decomposing monoliths in microservices
    lowly coupled which makes it easier to maintain it while allowing other services
    to continue operating. Furthermore, this type of architecture is more resilient
    because if one of the services is down, the other services due to the weak coupling
    can continue to operate at least in a degraded mode. (2) Data Lake/DataHouse propose
    a new approach Load Transform Extract (LTE) where data are firstly stored in their
    original format, which are then transformed in order to extract information. This
    paradigm is particularly well adapted when the amount of data is so important
    that process all data is too costly. In this case, data can be sampled in order
    to obtain information. This paradigm is also well adapted if we want to conserve
    also raw data or complete a generic architecture, for example, to store data that
    will be processed in batch processing. (3) Osmotic Computing attempts to propose
    a solution to the repartition of workload between fog and cloud in decomposing
    treatments in microelements composed of a microservice associated with a micro
    dataset. The osmotic computing could also be associated with the micro service
    architecture to allow the distribution of instances of microservices at different
    levels of the network according to their respective load. (4) Dew Computing aims
    to replicate data near sensors or users to continue to store data or allows to
    continue to consult data when connection is intermittent. It allows improving
    the reliance of architectures on connection interruptions. (5) Blockchain provides
    an answer to authentication and security problems by making it possible in particular
    to verify that the data has not been altered or compromised. Nevertheless, it
    is not possible to store large amount of data such as high definitions images,
    or videos in the blockchain but hashes of datasets allowing to verify their authenticity
    well. 6. Towards Agriculture 5.0 According Myklevy et al., the world must improve
    the amount of food produced by 70% by 2050 to produce global food needs for a
    population (Mykleby et al., 2016) of 9.7 billion according to the Food and Agriculture
    Organization of the United Nations (FAO) (Zhang, 2016). To overcome these problems
    and contribute to achieve the second objective of 17 Sustainable Development Goals
    (SDGs) of the United Nations (UN) with a timeframe in the range 2015 to 2030,
    the concept of Agriculture 5.0 has been born (Martos et al., 2021). Agriculture
    5.0 aims to increase production sustainably while consuming fewer resources and
    taking care of the environment. This next wave of agricultural revolution will
    imply the use of robots integrating machine learning to compensate for the shortage
    of workers. Farm robots are drastically increasing productivity in improving the
    human labor workforce and can also harvest a more important volume faster than
    a human. Nevertheless, these early technologies are still too expensive for most
    farmers especially small farms (Saiz-Rubio and Rovira-Más, 2020). Fig. 13 show
    the coupling between Agriculture 4.0 and Agriculture 5.0 and their integration
    in the context of the agri-food supply chain, the Society 5.0 and 17 Sustainable
    Development Goals (SDGs) of United Nations (See Fig. 13). Download : Download

    of the Agriculture 5.0 in the context of the Society 5.0. 7. Conclusion Our review
    is boosted by four research questions dectitaed as follow: (1) Which storage and
    processing architectures are best suited to Agriculture 4.0 applications and address
    its particularities? (2) Can generic architectures meet the needs of Agriculture
    4.0 application cases? (3) What are the horizontal valuation possibilities that
    allow the transition from research to industrialization? (4) What are the vertical
    valuation possibilities to move from algorithms trained in the cloud to embedded
    or autonomous products?. The analysis of the literature shows that a multitude
    of architecture coexists. Nevertheless, the Lambada and Kappa architectures seem
    to emerge as generic architectures. These must generally be accompanied by complementary
    architectural components to address specific needs and be part of a storage and
    processing strategy in which the cloud architecture is a component of the chain
    or may also and more rarely be absent. The traditional centralized cloud computing
    will continue to remain an important part of computing systems (Ai et al., 2018),
    for sciences even if other paradigms appear. Indeed, cloud, fog, and edge computing
    complementary interact with each other to form a mutually beneficial and interdependent
    service continuum. Some functions are naturally more suitable or advantageous
    at a level than another in function of requirements in response time, computing,
    or latency tolerance. However, the cloud cannot be completely replaced by fog
    and edge computing because some computation-intensive tasks can only be processed
    at the cloud level, which has the computing power and storage capacities (Wang
    et al., 2020). In Agriculture 4.0, this is particularly the case for the processing
    of satellite images, the training of artificial intelligence algorithms such as
    Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN). New trends make it possible to address
    various problems: (1) The Data lake/Data House offers a more economical alternative
    to massive cloud storage in databases. In this paradigm, all data are stored in
    a state and transform only when they are to be exploited. This approach is particularly
    interesting on one hand when all data are not exploited and on the other hand
    when a decision or an action is not expected immediately. Data lake also allows
    the fusion of agriculture data from various origins in different formats and granularity.
    (2) The blockchain provides solutions in particular to the security problems,
    the possibility of distributing data storage and ensuring the traceability of
    transactions in agrifood supply chains (3) As the literature has shown, Dew Computing
    can be placed in two different places in the network either as close as possible
    to the sensors to allow processing to continue during transmission interruptions
    or as close as possible to users in order to have a local copy of the data in
    order to be able to consult them offline. It should be noted, however, that for
    the second option, there are other means of local caching at the device level,
    for amounts of data of a few mega as those offered by Progressive Web Apps (PWA)
    by example. (4) Osmotic computing provides a solution to the question of how to
    distribute the load between the different processing levels (edge, fog, cloud).
    It uses the concept of microelement associating a microservice and its micro dataset.
    In addition, osmotic computing can also be associated with micro-service architectures.
    (5) The microservice architecture offers the possibility of decoupling the monolithic
    architectures into weakly coupled microservices. These services can be more easily
    associated, maintained, or evolved independently. The combination of these microservices
    makes it easier to develop new services for the end-user that are also easier
    and faster to evolve according to technological developments and needs. In addition,
    at the network level, the 5G network offers new possibilities in terms of Wireless
    Sensors and Actuators Network (WSAN), communication between machines, UAVs, and
    UGVs. Moreover, the coupling with MEC opens the field of processing close of end-users.
    The SDN/NFV Architecture allows to facilitate the design, and to improve the flexibility
    of network. Software-defined networking (SDN) allows decoupling transmission of
    data and network control functionality while Network function virtualization (NFV)
    abstracts transfer network and related network functions (Friha et al., 2021).
    Two trends in the use of processing architecture coexist, on the one hand, users
    of a paid or open source IoT platform, and on the other hand, users who develop
    specific architectures to implement particular use cases. From the point of view
    of transferability, we understand that it is easier for ready-made chargeable
    infrastructures and that it can be limited for turnkey open-source infrastructures
    where the type of license adopted may pose a problem. However, the sustainability
    of paid infrastructure is conditional on the development granted by the company
    that manages them and on its financial health. The development of architecture
    based on paid software bricks is facilitated but its durability is conditioned
    by the availability and the maintenance of these software bricks. As for transferability,
    it is linked to the acquisition of ad hoc licenses. The development of architecture
    using open source software bricks from foundations such as Apache Foundation makes
    it possible not to be limited by licenses but is dependent on developments and
    maintenance carried out by the community of developers. These software bricks
    can be abandoned by the community, the company that sponsors them, or the foundation
    that hosts them. The development of a sustainable architecture would go through
    an emancipation of software bricks which would make it possible to easily change
    them on the one hand when one of them disappears or if a new more efficient software
    brick appears. The deployment of 5G and satellite Internet will bring in a new
    player, which are the telecommunications companies that will be able to provide
    processing capacities and services as close as possible to users at the level
    of 5G antennas, which will impact processing architectures. The problem will then
    arise of interoperability between the networks of sensors and actuators with these
    new high-speed, low-latency networks. The new networks offered by the telecommunications
    companies will make it possible to offer new services or even to decouple the
    software from the hardware, which will make it possible to make the sensors and
    actuators interchangeable. This should make it possible to reduce the cost of
    the equipment and make it accessible to developing countries or areas not covered
    by traditional LPWAN and 3GPP networks. The impact of these new networks will
    have to be reviewed in the future to identify the new trends offered by 5G and
    satellite Internet. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that

  limitations: The analysis of existing reviews shows that applications use whether
    open source or commercial cloud architecture whether developing specific architecture
    responding to their aims or do not describe their storage and processing system.
    The latter represents more than half of the papers and means that some of the
    processing architectures remain unknown because they have never been specifically
    described and studied.

  verbatim_quote1: On one hand generic architectures dedicated or not to IoT are able
    to address a large number of use cases but not specifically the needs of Agriculture
    4.0 exist. On the other hand, researchers develop architectures to address specific
    issues or requirements of use cases.
  verbatim_quote2: The use of IoT in agriculture 4.0 ranges from family farming as
    for example in India on a very small scale with a few low-cost sensors and actuators
    to very large scales with thousands of expensive commercial sensors and connected
    agricultural pieces of machineries as in the American mid-west.

  analysis: 'The proposed architecture utilizes a Google Colaboratory notebook for
    developing an intelligence layer that uses ML classiﬁers, Remix IDE for the blockchain
    layer, and MATLAB 2022a for the communication layer. The Google Colaboratory notebook
    is a web IDE for Python programming that uses various Python libraries such as
    Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Sklearn, and Scipy for the ML classiﬁers.


    To simulate the working of the intelligent layer, we incorporated the Google Colaboratory
    notebook that uses ML classiﬁers and provides the classiﬁcation of the data. Here,
    different ML classiﬁers, such as XGboost, RF, KNN, LR, and SVM, have hyperparameters
    that tailor the classiﬁers’ behavior and improve performance. Table 3 depicts
    the parameters used in the proposed architecture. Here, n_estimators, learning_rate,
    and max_depth are used for the XGBoost classiﬁer, where n_estimators represents
    the tree’s count. Then, learning_rate is used as the regularization parameter
    that shows the step size, and the max_depth parameter controls the overﬁtting
    in the model. The RF classiﬁer used n_estimators value of 200 and max_depth value
    of 1. Moreover, KNN uses the n_neighbors parameter to show the total count of
    neighbors that are utilized by default for the k-neighbors queries. Furthermore,
    the LR classiﬁer uses random_state that shufﬂes the data and the “lbfgs” solver
    with max_iter that uses the solvers to converge. For the SVM classiﬁer, we use
    different parameters such as gamma, probability, and kernel. Here, we use rbf
    and linear kernel with the kernel coefﬁcient value such as gamma = “auto”, which
    means 1/n_f eatures.


    The classiﬁed data have sensitive and conﬁdential information and require secure
    storage. Therefore, the classiﬁed data are stored in the IPFS-based blockchain
    network using a smart contract in the blockchain layer. The smart contract is
    implemented using solidity language on the Remix IDE with different functions,
    such as criminal behaviors() to identify the criminal, weapon() to determine the
    crime type, addlocation() to know the crime spot, updatecount(), and many more.
    The smart contract is deployed over the Rinkeby’s network. On a successful compilation
    and deployment of the smart contract, validated or authenticated data from the
    smart contract are forwarded to the IPFS-based public blockchain for secure storage.
    Further, the 6G network is simulated on MATLAB 2022a using a 5G toolbox. This
    is because there is not yet any open-source software available that provides 6G
    properties and can integrate that with real-world applications. Due to this constraint,
    we utilized a 5G-based simulation toolbox, where we changed the simulation parameters,
    for example, changing the bandwidth allocation, transmit power, sub-carrier spacing
    (240 KHz), and modulation (OFDMA) techniques of the 5G network to impersonate
    a 6G network.'

    \ have rapidly grown over the past few decades to offer futuristic ap-\nplications,\
    \ such as autonomous vehicles, smart farming, and smart city. Such applications\
    \ require\nubiquitous, real-time, and secure communications to deliver services\
    \ quickly. Toward this aim,\nsixth-generation (6G) wireless technology offers\
    \ superior performance with high reliability, enhanced\ntransmission rate, and\
    \ low latency. However, managing the resources of the aforementioned applica-\n\
    tions is highly complex in the precarious network. An adversary can perform various\
    \ network-related\nattacks (i.e., data injection or modiﬁcation) to jeopardize\
    \ the regular operation of the smart applica-\ntions. Therefore, incorporating\
    \ blockchain technology in the smart application can be a prominent\nsolution\
    \ to tackle security, reliability, and data-sharing privacy concerns. Motivated\
    \ by the same,\nwe presented a case study on public safety applications that utilizes\
    \ the essential characteristics of\nartiﬁcial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and\
    \ a 6G network to handle data integrity attacks on the crime\ndata. The case study\
    \ is assessed using various performance parameters by considering blockchain\n\
    scalability, packet drop ratio, and training accuracy. Lastly, we explored different\
    \ research challenges\nof adopting blockchain in the 6G wireless network.\nKeywords:\
    \ blockchain; 6G network; applications; blockchain services; unmanned aerial vehicle;\
    \ AI\n1. Introduction\nIn the current scenario, humans interact with the physical\
    \ world using sixth-generation\n(6G)-based technologies, such as the Internet\
    \ of things (IoT), cloud computing, big data,\nand artiﬁcial intelligence (AI).\
    \ These technologies monitor the application’s resources and\ncontrol a colossal\
    \ amount of data, power, and storage resources. The advent of IoT technolo-\n\
    gies brings tremendous cognizant applications, such as smart healthcare, smart\
    \ cities, smart\ngrids, etc., to improve people’s standard of living. However,\
    \ the increasing number of\nusers and their network demands, such as high bandwidth\
    \ and low latency, make wireless\ncommunication networks more complex and vulnerable\
    \ to different security and privacy\nissues, such as user identity, authenticity,\
    \ data integrity, information security, and conﬁden-\ntiality [1]. For example,\
    \ in a smart healthcare system, the patient health record is private\nSensors\
    \ 2023, 23, 969. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23020969\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 969\n2 of 26\nand sensitive information that must be secured\
    \ from adversaries, which can misuse this\ninformation by tampering with it or\
    \ selling it to the black market. Another example is\nfor public safety applications\
    \ (e.g., IoT-based crime detection), where a criminal tries to\nmodify the central\
    \ repository that holds the criminal records. The adversary can modify or\ntamper\
    \ the criminal records, i.e., it can perform injection attacks to change the criminal’s\n\
    identity (e.g., remove the traces of criminal evidence). Therefore, superior technology\n\
    such as blockchain is required to overcome the aforementioned security issues\
    \ in 6G-based\nsmart applications [2]. It strengthens the security and privacy\
    \ of wireless communication\nnetworks by utilizing its essential characteristics,\
    \ i.e., immutability, scalability, security and\nprivacy, transparency, and decentralization\
    \ [3,4].\nBlockchain is a decentralized ledger technology that builds trust between\
    \ various\nnetwork services and applications such as smart grids, smart agriculture,\
    \ smart cities,\nunmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications, and vehicle-to-vehicle\
    \ (V2V) communica-\ntions. It also delivers improved services such as interoperability,\
    \ distribution, immutability,\nfaster settlement, unanimity, and many more. As\
    \ a result, blockchain is associated with a\n6G-based wireless communication network\
    \ and offers a secure and trusted environment for\ndata protection in an IoT-based\
    \ public safety environment. For example, Velliangiri et al. [5]\ndiscussed the\
    \ applicability of blockchain technology with the emerging 6G network for\nsecure\
    \ data sharing. They proposed a privacy-preserving architecture for industrial\
    \ services\nand applications. Then, Bindu et al. [6] discussed the signiﬁcance\
    \ of blockchain in 6G\nwireless communication networks. They studied various applications\
    \ of 6G with security\nand privacy threats and explored blockchain-based solutions\
    \ for smart and industrial IoT-\nbased applications. In [7], the authors used\
    \ blockchain secure storage to store crime images\nby applying watermarking and\
    \ cryptographic blockchain in forensic applications. There\nhas been a lot of\
    \ research work in the ﬁeld of the integration of blockchain in 6G-based\nreal-world\
    \ applications. A detailed explanation of each application is as follows.\n1.1.\
    \ Applications of Blockchain in 6G Network\nThis section presents the role of\
    \ blockchain in 6G-based smart applications such as\nsmart cities, smart manufacturing,\
    \ smart agriculture, V2V communication, UAV communi-\ncations, and smart grid\
    \ (Figure 1).\nSmart city\nSmart healthcare\nSmart manufacturing\nSmart grid\n\
    Smart agriculture\nFigure 1. Applications of blockchain in 6G network.\nSensors\
    \ 2023, 23, 969\n3 of 26\n1.1.1. Smart Healthcare\nThe healthcare industry is\
    \ an essential sector in the nation’s economic system that\noffers medical services\
    \ to treat patients, promote patients’ health, and increase the quality\nof life\
    \ of individuals. The emerging 6G technology revolutionizes healthcare by changing\n\
    the perception of lifestyle [8]. A smart healthcare system offers better connectivity\
    \ between\npatients and healthcare providers, medical organizations, and IoT-based\
    \ medical devices. It\nprovides a health information platform by adopting 6G-based\
    \ services, such as augmented\nand virtual reality. In addition, healthcare systems\
    \ require the blockchain to securely store\nmedical records and update patient\
    \ data across different platforms in real-time [9,10].\nResearchers enabled blockchain\
    \ technology in 6G-based applications and proposed\nmany solutions for smart healthcare.\
    \ For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, patients\nsuffering from chronic\
    \ diseases are more at risk than ordinary people because patients with\ndiabetes\
    \ and asthma are more susceptible to coronavirus infection. Therefore, there is\
    \ a\nrequirement to treat these types of patients remotely and offer them emergency\
    \ facilities\nsuch as temperature checks, pulse, and respiratory and O2 monitoring.\
    \ However, remote\ndiagnosis and treatment can be lured by the attacker and cause\
    \ patient data security issues.\nThus, to overcome these issues, blockchain is\
    \ integrated with a healthcare system that\nremotely monitors the health data\
    \ of patients suffering from a chronic disease. In [11],\nthe authors facilitated\
    \ a private blockchain and a solidity-based smart contract that keeps\ntrack of\
    \ patients’ health information. The role of blockchain in their proposed work\
    \ is to\nsecurely analyze patients’ details and store patient health records from\
    \ and to the sensors.\nFurther, in [12], the authors investigated AI with healthcare\
    \ systems and proposed a\nparallel gout diagnosis and treatment system (PGDTS).\
    \ Their proposed system enhances\nthe diagnosis accuracy and the effectiveness\
    \ of medical treatment. After the diagnosis and\ntreatment process, their adopted\
    \ scheme was analyzed and evaluated based on diverse\ntherapeutic regimens, and\
    \ they established parallel execution for real-time optimization of\nhealthcare\
    \ processes. Their integrated blockchain-based PGDTS scheme offers integrity,\n\
    scalability, and security of patients’ data.\n1.1.2. Smart Manufacturing\nIn the\
    \ real-world scenario, massive amounts of data are exchanged between the\ndevices\
    \ for large-scale manufacturing. Therefore, machines have the interaction capability\n\
    to cooperate via the Industrial Internet in the manufacturing industry. In order\
    \ to improve\nthe performance of the entire manufacturing process, machines autonomously\
    \ make local\ndecisions [13]; however, there is a requirement for always-on connectivity,\
    \ a higher data\nrate, more reliability, and ultra-low latency in the manufacturing\
    \ industry. The 6G mobile\ncommunication techniques are developed to target the\
    \ aforementioned manufacturing\nindustrial services; however, there are security\
    \ issues in the manufacturing industry where\na malicious user could tamper with\
    \ the manufacturing data. Therefore, blockchain-based\nnetworks are integrated\
    \ into manufacturing systems that offer cybersecurity guarantees\nvia smart contracts,\
    \ hash functions, digital signatures, and immutable digital ledgers to\ntackle\
    \ security and privacy issues. Recently, Leng et al. [14] incorporated digital\
    \ twins with\ndecentralized permissioned blockchain networks to build better mutual\
    \ trust and data ﬂow\nin manufacturing processes. They proposed a ManuChain prototype\
    \ to realize lower- and\nupper-level intelligence for crowd self-organize and\
    \ holistic optimization. Their proposed\nscheme aided a new value for transforming\
    \ and upgrading manufacturing systems. It also\nenhanced the efﬁciency of the\
    \ manufacturing process.\nRecently, blockchain has been investigated and integrated\
    \ with mobile edge com-\nputing (MEC) to overcome the computational workload.\
    \ It reduces time complexity and\nsigniﬁcantly improves system performance. In\
    \ [15], the authors presented a smart man-\nufacturing system by integrating MEC\
    \ with blockchain technology. They also proposed\na swarm-intelligence-based optimization\
    \ model with numerous tasks that enhance the\nprocessing time. Blockchain offers\
    \ device-level information transmission and manufac-\nturing service transactions\
    \ in their proposed approach. Then, Teng et al. [16] proposed a\nSensors 2023,\
    \ 23, 969\n4 of 26\nsmart manufacturing scheme using distributed ledger technology\
    \ that supports on-demand\nproduction. They introduced a blockchain-embedded smart\
    \ manufacturing system that en-\nhances manufacturing efﬁciency. They investigated\
    \ latency and limited throughput issues\nin the blockchain network. Therefore,\
    \ they proposed a deep Q-network that maximizes\nthe user’s net proﬁt. Their results\
    \ show that their proposed framework is highly scalable.\nIt offers consistency,\
    \ availability, and privacy by incorporating off-chain storage, ledger\nisolation,\
    \ and encryption mechanism.\n1.1.3. Smart City\nSmart city architecture requires\
    \ conventional internet support for information collec-\ntion and transmission;\
    \ however, the transmitted data encounter latency and security issues\ndue to\
    \ the precarious communication link between nodes of the smart city. Therefore,\n\
    6G communication technology plays an essential role in connecting devices such\
    \ as the\nsensor in the IoT environment. However, these devices face authentication\
    \ issues that affect\ncomputational costs, communication overheads, and robustness\
    \ [17]. To mitigate these is-\nsues, blockchain technology offers conﬁdentiality,\
    \ integrity, and availability in IoT-enabled\nsmart devices.\nSeveral researchers\
    \ discussed the security challenges in a smart city context. In [18],\nthe author\
    \ aimed to enhance the data collection and processing in smart city governance.\n\
    Therefore, they introduced a hybrid consortium blockchain framework that encourages\n\
    public engagement in the decision-making process. The proposed approach can tackle\n\
    the collusion attacks from the public veriﬁer’s group. Further, they offered a\
    \ Stackelberg-\ngame-based approach to enable persistent public participation\
    \ in the transaction validation\nprocess. The work in [19] proposed an IoT–fog–cloud\
    \ integrated approach with the inter-\nplanetary ﬁle system (IPFS)-based blockchain\
    \ for IoT-driven smart cities. They presented a\nsecure framework based on two-level\
    \ privacy and an intrusion detection scheme. The ﬁrst\nscheme incorporated a blockchain\
    \ module to secure the IoT information and proposed a\ndimensionality reduction\
    \ technique that transits raw IoT data in a new shape. They applied\na gradient\
    \ boosting anomaly detector approach for intrusion detection. Their results show\n\
    that their adopted scheme outperforms in terms of accuracy, recall, F1-score,\
    \ and precision\ncompared with the conventional intrusion detection scheme. Further,\
    \ Rahman et al. [20]\nincorporated blockchain with the IoT infrastructure and\
    \ proposed an MEC-enabled sharing\neconomy system for mega smart cities. They\
    \ utilized smart contracts for decentralized\nmessaging services and stored IoT\
    \ data in a decentralized repository via edge networks.\n1.1.4. Smart Vehicles\n\
    To establish V2V communication, vehicles must quickly send the vehicular informa-\n\
    tion, comprising number of pedestrians, road conditions, number of vehicles, and\
    \ their\nconditions, to reduce the number of road accidents and enhance road safety.\
    \ However,\nthe scalability of V2V communication increases the security, safety,\
    \ reliability, and trust\nissues of vehicular network users. Therefore, there\
    \ is a requirement for a prominent solu-\ntion to overcome these issues. Blockchain\
    \ is used to manage the ground truth of vehicle\ninformation and offers data authentication\
    \ among vehicles. Many researchers recently\nfocused on blockchain technology\
    \ for V2V communication. Chattaraj et al. [21] integrated\nblockchain with IoT-driven\
    \ smart devices that improve customer safety, ease congestion,\nand pollution\
    \ reduction. For that, they proposed a certiﬁcateless key agreement protocol for\n\
    Internet of vehicles in a smart transportation context (Block-CLAP). The proposed\
    \ scheme\noutperforms the precedent authentication schemes’ security, communication,\
    \ and computa-\ntional overheads.\nFurthermore, Xia et al. [22] integrated blockchain\
    \ with the Internet of vehicles (BIoV)\nand proposed a novel V2V electricity trading\
    \ approach using Bayesian game pricing. They\nutilized a Bayesian game that predicted\
    \ the price in the distributed BIoV with incomplete\ninformation-sharing. In the\
    \ pricing game approach, they applied smart contracts that\nprovide security,\
    \ trust, and reliability for electricity transactions. The results reveal that\
    \ the\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n5 of 26\nproposed scheme reduces communication overhead\
    \ and time complexity in the decentral-\nized IoVs compared to the static game.\
    \ Then, in [23], the authors incorporated a blockchain\nnetwork with the vehicles\
    \ that stores real-time information about vehicles, such as relaying,\ntransmitting,\
    \ and receiving data. As a result, the adopted scheme is able to block malicious\n\
    or unauthorized vehicles from participation. Finally, they considered network\
    \ parameters,\nsuch as throughput and error rate analysis (i.e., bit error rate)\
    \ to evaluate their proposed\nscheme. They proved the proposed scheme’s efﬁciency\
    \ and effectiveness by enhancing\nthroughput by 3 bps and decreasing BER by 2\
    \ dB.\n1.1.5. Smart Grid\nA smart grid is introduced to meet people’s higher electricity\
    \ needs and optimize\nresource allocation. The smart grid makes better decisions\
    \ about power and energy-sharing\ndata. It supports management approaches for\
    \ peak energy demand and also reduces energy\nconsumption by exchanging the data\
    \ of energy feedback and power consumption [24].\nHowever, due to the possibility\
    \ of malicious access during information exchange over the\ninsecure communication\
    \ network, multiple entities are unwilling to convey their informa-\ntion to protect\
    \ their data privacy. Moreover, there are various types of cyberattacks in smart\n\
    grid systems, such as session hijacking, nonrepudiation, denial-of-service (DoS),\
    \ ﬂooding,\nspooﬁng, and man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack [25]. To overcome the\
    \ security and privacy\nissues, smart technology is required that provides trust,\
    \ reliability, and data-sharing secu-\nrity. Many researchers adopt blockchain\
    \ as a solution to secure the smart grid. For instance,\nthe authors of [26] presented\
    \ a secure and reliable data exchange scheme by utilizing\nthe processing mode.\
    \ The proposed scheme provides transparency and auditability of\nenergy production,\
    \ pricing, and services in smart grids. They utilized smart contracts to\nauthenticate\
    \ and track the data ﬂow between different blockchain members. Additionally,\n\
    they incorporated a distributed ledger that provides an immutable and transparent\
    \ data\nusage record. As a result, their adopted scheme outperforms in terms of\
    \ payoffs compared\nwith baseline works. Further, Hao et al. [27] focused on the\
    \ efﬁciency and privacy issue in\nthe current electricity trading scheme. Therefore,\
    \ they analyzed a decentralized scheme of\npeer-to-peer electricity trading by\
    \ introducing smart meters. They utilized a blockchain\nwallet for transactions\
    \ and a smart contract to initiate the transmission switch instructions.\nThe\
    \ results revealed that the proposed scheme reduces the cost and latency. Furthermore,\n\
    they offered fast and privacy-aware roaming to prove the proposed scheme’s feasibility\n\
    and efﬁciency.\n1.1.6. Smart Agriculture\nIn the world, agriculture is the largest\
    \ sector of economic activity. With an increasing\nworld population, there is\
    \ a requirement to increase agricultural productivity by adopt-\ning smart technologies,\
    \ such as IoT, robotics, UAV communication, AI, etc., to enhance\nthe quality\
    \ and quantity of agricultural products with minimum human labor. Existing\nwireless\
    \ standards such as ZigBee, Bluetooth, Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi), Narrowband IoT\n\
    (NB-IoT), and WiMAX are used for pesticide detection, soil sensing, smart irrigation,\
    \ crop\nrecommendations, and plant protection. They prevent forest ﬁres and offer\
    \ safety to crops\nfrom pests [28]. However, the aforementioned technologies face\
    \ an issue when a consid-\nerable amount of agricultural data is accumulated in\
    \ real-time. In addition, population\ngrowth and environmental effects such as\
    \ climate change, temperature, rainfall, etc., af-\nfect the agriculture system.\
    \ Therefore, emerging 6G wireless communication technology\nand its speciﬁc application\
    \ scenarios are introduced in agriculture, providing intelligent,\nunmanned, and\
    \ automatic agricultural production and cultivation by offering high-speed\nconnectivity\
    \ between smart devices.\nSmart agriculture systems require transparency and commercial\
    \ security for the food\ndata [29]. Therefore, many researchers adopt blockchain\
    \ technology in the agricultural ﬁeld\nto provide security, reliability, transparency,\
    \ and privacy of agricultural data. For example,\nVangala et al. [30] proposed\
    \ a blockchain-based smart contract that includes a key agree-\nSensors 2023,\
    \ 23, 969\n6 of 26\nment approach to mitigate the risk of data integrity attacks\
    \ in smart farming systems. Their\nproposed scheme utilizes a robust authentication\
    \ method between two IoT devices. Simi-\nlarly, another authentication phase is\
    \ utilized between an IoT device and the gateway node\nto offer endogenous security.\
    \ Furthermore, they proposed a hybrid blockchain to store the\ntrading transactions\
    \ between different components of the agriculture ecosystem, pesticide\nusage,\
    \ and quality and quantity of fertilizers. The results revealed that the adopted\
    \ scheme\noutperforms in terms of computational time compared to the existing\
    \ authentication proto-\ncols. Then, Yang et al. [31] focused on centralized,\
    \ opaque, and untrustworthy data storage\nissues for horticulture products. To\
    \ overcome the aforementioned issues, they introduced\na traceability system (e.g.,\
    \ on- and off-chain traceability) using a dual storage within the\nblockchain.\
    \ They utilized cryptography-based elliptic curves with blockchain for safe data\n\
    sharing. Moreover, they proposed a reputation-based smart contract to upload traceability\n\
    information from the node. Their simulation results enhance efﬁciency and guarantee\
    \ the\nagriculture data’s reliability, security, and authenticity.\nNevertheless,\
    \ the aforesaid applications require superlative care from criminal activi-\n\
    ties, natural calamities (e.g., ﬁre, earthquake, etc.), terrorist attacks, and\
    \ riots. For example,\nif a person driving a smart vehicle meets with a road accident,\
    \ it can use V2V communica-\ntion to share this information with the emergency\
    \ medical response team. Similarly, UAV\ncommunication can assist V2V communication\
    \ in sharing this information with nearby hos-\npitals to provide emergency medical\
    \ care. Another scenario is where smart manufacturing\nrequires on-site maintenance\
    \ to clean and repair various critical equipment of the manu-\nfacturing organization.\
    \ This is challenging for a person to perform on-site maintenance\nbecause the\
    \ manufacturing vessels and equipment are highly hazardous (i.e., radioactive)\n\
    to human health. Further, a criminal attempt to commit a crime (e.g., stealing,\
    \ murder,\nkidnapping, etc.) in the smart city must be captured under the jurisdiction.\
    \ Therefore,\nthe government and local organizations must offer an emergency response,\
    \ disaster risk\nmanagement, and criminal investigation teams under the umbrella\
    \ of public safety applica-\ntions to protect the wellbeing of the nation’s citizens\
    \ who are using the abovementioned\napplications. However, it is observed from\
    \ the literature review that public safety applica-\ntions are highly insecure\
    \ from the perspective of security and privacy. These applications\nstill use\
    \ legacy software and tools and utilize a centralized repository for data storage\
    \ that\nthe attackers can lure. Moreover, as these applications are mission-critical,\
    \ they require\nlow latency and high data rate communication to offer proactive\
    \ services; however, many\npublic safety applications still use traditional network\
    \ interfaces (e.g., 3G and 4G) that\ndegrade their performance.\n1.2. Motivation\n\
    The motivation behind this work is given as follows.\n•\nMost of the existing\
    \ literature focuses on the role of blockchain in 6G-based appli-\ncations; however,\
    \ there are a few research articles available in which the authors\nstudied the\
    \ drivers, enablers, security requirements, and applicability of blockchain in\n\
    6G-based smart applications.\n•\nFrom the literature review, we observed that\
    \ no comprehensive work exists that\nconsiders the security and privacy challenges\
    \ of IoT-based public safety applications\nusing blockchain technology.\n•\nThus,\
    \ there is a stringent requirement to provide exhaustive work on the applicability\n\
    of blockchain in IoT-based public safety applications underlying a 6G network.\n\
    1.3. Research Contributions\nThis article presents the role of the blockchain\
    \ in a 6G-based IoT-enabled public safety\napplication. We also emphasize how\
    \ blockchain provides security and privacy in 6G\nservices. Moreover, the paper\
    \ shows the amalgamation of blockchain in 6G communication\nnetworks to strengthen\
    \ the security and communication of public safety applications. Based\non that,\
    \ the following are the signiﬁcant contributions of this research article.\nSensors\
    \ 2023, 23, 969\n7 of 26\n•\nThrough this article, we propose a detailed work\
    \ on the applicability of blockchain\nin a 6G network. We also analyze the 6G-based\
    \ smart applications and discuss how\nblockchain features provide trust, security,\
    \ authenticity, conﬁdentiality, and privacy.\n•\nWe explore different 6G-network-based\
    \ services and discuss the inﬂuence of blockchain\nin delivering 6G-based services\
    \ to various smart applications.\n•\nWe consider a blockchain- and 6G-based case\
    \ study for public safety applications to\nshowcase the adoption of blockchain\
    \ technology in the 6G network interface. Further,\nthe case study is assessed\
    \ by considering blockchain scalability, 6G latency, and AI\nstatistical measures\
    \ parameters.\n•\nLastly, we perform an in-depth analysis and identify the research\
    \ challenges of the\nadoption of blockchain in the 6G network to motivate the\
    \ researchers working on the\nsame domain.\n2. Related Works\nIn the previous\
    \ section, we discussed various blockchain-based 6G applications such\nas smart\
    \ healthcare, smart grid, smart agriculture, smart manufacturing, etc. After study-\n\
    ing these real-world applications in detail, we identiﬁed that public safety is\
    \ an essential\ndomain that requires more security attention. Various researchers\
    \ consider public safety\napplications and offered security and privacy approaches\
    \ for road safety, criminal activity\nmonitoring, on-site safety, etc. They deal\
    \ with data security, person authentication, infor-\nmation conﬁdentiality, and\
    \ integrity issues. For example, Ihinosen et al. [32] addressed the\ndynamic ridesharing\
    \ issue in public transport systems. They proposed GPS tracking and a\ntwo-way\
    \ rating system using the mobile application’s facial recognition module.\nIn\
    \ the aforementioned work, the researchers incorporated different security mech-\n\
    anisms using mobile applications and cryptographic primitives. However, they are\
    \ yet\nto consider data consistency, traceability, and scalability. Therefore,\
    \ Xu et al. [33] uti-\nlized various technologies such as blockchain, IoT, edge,\
    \ fog, and cloud computing for\nsmart public safety. They proposed the BLockchain-ENabled\
    \ Decentralized Microservices\nArchitecture for Smart public safety, named BlendMAS,\
    \ scheme that offers security and\ndata access control for the public safety system.\
    \ Then, in [34], Fitwi et al. worked on the\nsafety and security of video surveillance\
    \ systems. They proposed edge computing and a\nsmart-contract-based lightweight\
    \ privacy protection (Lib-Pri) scheme that identiﬁes the\nfugitives using their\
    \ facial features. Makhdoom et al. [35] proposed a smart-contract-based\ncollaborative\
    \ intrusion detection system that prevents cyberattack and data theft. Their\n\
    proposed scheme manages the trust between the nodes and prevents the input false\
    \ attack\nin the IDS.\nFurthermore, Wu et al. [36] focused on the on-site safety\
    \ issue due to the equipment\ndefects and environmental hazards for tower crane\
    \ safety management. They proposed\na blockchain-based framework utilizing Hyperledger\
    \ Fabric that offers security and au-\nthenticity with trust at the construction\
    \ site. Moreover, Yu et al. [37] addressed data\nvulnerability, conﬁdentiality,\
    \ privacy, and the centralized key storage issue of the IIoT data\nstorage applications.\
    \ To overcome this problem, they proposed a Shamir threshold cryp-\ntography scheme\
    \ with blockchain called STCChain that offers availability, accountability,\n\
    and integrity of the data. Then, Na et al. [38] proposed a blockchain-enabled\
    \ access control\nscheme using multisignature that protects autonomous vehicle\
    \ data. They collected and\nstored vehicle data using a dashboard camera and global\
    \ positioning system. Their ﬁndings\nshowed that the proposed scheme offers data\
    \ privacy and security with lower veriﬁcation\ntime and latency. Table 1 shows\
    \ the comparative analysis of existing works for public safety\napplications by\
    \ incorporating security, 6G network with their objective, pros, and cons.\nFrom\
    \ the overall study, we observed that many researchers carried out a lot of research\n\
    work in the security ﬁeld for smart public safety applications. In most papers,\
    \ the research\ncommunity focuses on the role of different security approaches,\
    \ such as cryptographic and\nmobile applications. However, very few of them incorporated\
    \ blockchain-based security in\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n8 of 26\npublic safety\
    \ applications. Therefore, we included a blockchain-based security approach\n\
    using 6G wireless communication in the public safety application domain.\nTable\

    \ of the research article is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the literature\n\
    review of the state-of-the-art works. Section 3 presents blockchain-based 6G services\
    \ such\nas network slicing, spectrum sharing, data sharing, and resource management.\
    \ In Section 4,\nwe proposed layer-wise architecture for IoT-based public safety\
    \ application. Section 5\ndiscusses the results and analysis of the proposed case\
    \ study. Then, we discuss various\nchallenges of the adoption of blockchain in\
    \ 6G network in Section 6. Finally, Section 7\nprovides the conclusion.\n3. Role\
    \ of Blockchain in 6G Services\nThis section provides insights on the 6G-based\
    \ smart services, such as network slicing,\nspectrum sharing, resource management,\
    \ and data sharing. Table 2 shows the comparative\nstudy on blockchain-based existing\
    \ 6G services.\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n9 of 26\n3.1. Network Slicing\nNetwork\
    \ slicing allows to create different virtual networks, where each network\nposes\
    \ different network services from the physical networks infrastructure. This is\
    \ made\npossible by integrating technologies, such as software-deﬁned network\
    \ (SDN) and network\nfunctions virtualization (NFV), that divide single network\
    \ connections into multiple distinct\nvirtual connections. It delivers virtual\
    \ applications that are directly deployed on the\nslice for instant service delivery\
    \ to the users. As an outcome, mobile applications that\nare running on slices\
    \ have large-scale connections and low-latency services with a high-\nquality\
    \ user experience. Network slices reduce the network complexity by virtualization\n\
    and add automation to a complex network. However, it faces issues in dynamic slice\n\
    creation, resource sharing, wireless resource virtualization, and data security.\
    \ To mitigate\nthe aforementioned issues, blockchain is integrated with network\
    \ slicing to provide user\ntrust, transparency, and privacy. Many researchers\
    \ integrate blockchain as a service in\nnetwork slicing. For example, Abdulqadder\
    \ et al. [39] focused on user authentication,\nload imbalance, and inappropriate\
    \ network slicing issues in an edge-assisted 6G network.\nInitially, they designed\
    \ a deep-learning-based adversarial network that predicts the efﬁcient\nnetwork\
    \ slices and communication links based on the slice capacity, priority, and quality-of-\n\
    service (QoS) demands for data transmission. Further, they applied DAG-based blockchain\n\
    using the proof-of-space approach to enhance the scalability and overcome more\
    \ resource\nconsumption issues. Moreover, they introduced a soft actor–critic\
    \ scheme for load balancing\nin the SDN controller. Finally, the paper concluded\
    \ that the adopted scheme reduces\nhandover latency, packet loss rate, and data\
    \ transmission delay and enhances the system\nthroughput and different attack\
    \ detection rate.\nHe et al. in [40] integrated a multidomain network slice orchestration\
    \ framework with\na blockchain-based CoNet consensus algorithm for data consistency,\
    \ scalability, and security.\nFurther, they proposed a game-theory-based bilateral\
    \ evaluation approach that provides\nsystem fairness with a QoS guarantee. The\
    \ ﬁndings showed that the adopted scheme\nprovides users’ data security and privacy\
    \ with high throughput and low latency. Then,\nChen et al. [41] formulated a blockchain-based\
    \ optical network slicing scheme for IoT\napplications. They focused on the users’\
    \ data security and trust issues while they utilized\nIoT services. The results\
    \ showed that their presented scheme is able to complete slicing\ntransactions\
    \ with a high-quality dedicated communication network.\n3.2. Spectrum Sharing\n\
    The explosive growth of bandwidth-intensive Internet applications such as live\
    \ audio\nand video streaming, web conferencing, big data processing, etc., requires\
    \ high-speed\nnetwork access with a higher frequency spectrum. The 6G wireless\
    \ technology provides\nhigh-speed network access with ultra-reliable low-latency\
    \ communication (URLLC) using\na higher-frequency spectrum [42]. However, it also\
    \ increases congestion and interference in\nthe communication network. To overcome\
    \ this issue, it is required to share the spectrum\nproperly that enhances communication\
    \ capacity and spectrum efﬁciency. Spectrum sharing\naims to efﬁciently use scarce\
    \ natural resources to ensure fairness between mobile users.\nThere are two types\
    \ of methods for spectrum sharing: static and dynamic spectrum sharing.\nOut of\
    \ these two spectrum-sharing mechanisms, dynamic spectrum sharing is the most\n\
    adopted method; it provides feasible, ﬂexible, and efﬁcient spectrum management\
    \ based on\ncognitive radio technology [43,44]. The variety of spectrum bands\
    \ and the rivalry between\ndifferent mobile network operators are the challenges\
    \ in the 6G spectrum sharing. Af-\nter lots of research, many solutions were proposed\
    \ in [45,46] for efﬁcient spectrum sharing;\nhowever, the solutions that address\
    \ the spectrum scarcity problem face issues such as single\npoint of failure,\
    \ malicious activity from unauthorized users, and security concerns.\nTo mitigate\
    \ the aforementioned issue, many researchers incorporate blockchain with\n6G technology,\
    \ which improves security and system performance [47]. For example,\nLiu et al.\
    \ [48] integrated AI with blockchain for radio spectrum resource allocation in\n\
    6G-based enhanced URLLC service. They focused on resource scheduling, classiﬁcation,\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 969\n10 of 26\nand neural network optimization issues between\
    \ IoT devices. For that, they proposed a re-\ninforcement learning approach with\
    \ a blockchain-integrated hybrid cloud. Their presented\nscheme uses uniﬁed coding\
    \ and identiﬁcation standards to build a public management\nplatform to register\
    \ and manage IoT device information. The ﬁndings reveal that the\nadopted scheme\
    \ effectively increases spectrum utilization with security and reliability.\n\
    Further, in [49], the authors presented a blockchain-based user-autonomy spectrum-sharing\n\
    framework that efﬁciently manages the heterogeneous devices of the IoT network.\
    \ They\ndesigned a swarm intelligence approach and a dynamic tip selection algorithm\
    \ to enhance\nthe system and global utility. The simulation results revealed that\
    \ the proposed scheme\nminimizes the average waiting time of transactions and\
    \ power consumption. Moreover, it\nenhances global utility, throughput, and spectral\
    \ efﬁciency. Then, Manogaran et al. [50]\npresented a blockchain-based security\
    \ solution for access control and preserving the data\nprivacy of users’ resources.\
    \ Furthermore, they introduced a Q-learning approach with\nmachine-type communication\
    \ (MTC) that enhanced the performance in the 6G environ-\nment. Compared to the\
    \ existing schemes, their proposed scheme outperformed in terms of\nthe success\
    \ ratio, access time modiﬁcation, time complexity, and memory utilization.\n3.3.\
    \ Data Sharing\nThe 6G-based smart applications such as UAV communication, aerial\
    \ base stations,\nsatellite communication, V2V communication, etc., offer real-time\
    \ data-sharing features\nover the Internet through a mobile communication network.\
    \ Moreover, an increasing\nnumber of social media applications, such as Twitter,\
    \ Facebook, Instagram, etc., and web\nconferencing applications, such as Webex,\
    \ Google Meet, Zoom, etc., require content delivery\nin real-time. These applications\
    \ generate a colossal amount of audio, video, text, and image\ndata. To control\
    \ and share a large scale of data requires an efﬁcient data-sharing scheme\nthat\
    \ overcomes data leakage and security threats. Decentralized blockchain technology\n\
    offers traceability, security, privacy, tamper-resistance, transparency, and immutability\
    \ to\nhandle data-sharing issues in the 6G network. Khowaja et al., in [51], aimed\
    \ to offer a secure\nand reliable data-exchange scheme using a private blockchain,\
    \ i.e., Hyperledger Fabric\nfor vehicular networks. Additionally, they developed\
    \ a deep-learning-based autoencoder\nsegmentation approach that gathers the vehicles\
    \ based on their similarity. The proposed\ndata-sharing scheme achieved better\
    \ throughput, CPU utilization, efﬁciency, applicability,\ncomputational overhead,\
    \ and time complexity.\nFurther, Zhang et al. [52] combined permissioned blockchain\
    \ with federated learning\n(FL) and proposed a channel-based distributed data-sharing\
    \ scheme for data sharing and\npreserving the privacy of the user. Moreover, they\
    \ proposed a data storage scheme using on-\nand off-chain data storage for authenticating\
    \ identity, data, and transactions. The adopted\nscheme enhanced data sharing\
    \ and security, improved data model quality, and prevented\nmalicious attacks.\
    \ Then, in [53], the authors proposed a concrete access control mechanism\nfor\
    \ vehicular communication (vehicular ad hoc network (VANET)). For that, they integrated\n\
    blockchain with ciphertext-enabled attribute encryption (CP-ABE) for user and\
    \ data storage\nidentity management. Further, they enhanced the security mechanism\
    \ and designed the\nadvanced attributed algorithm that minimizes the lightweight\
    \ device’s computational\npressure in VANET. The ﬁndings show that the proposed\
    \ scheme provides effective data\nsecurity with low performance overhead.\n3.4.\
    \ Resource Management\nThe most important service in a 6G wireless communication\
    \ system is utilizing various\nmobile resources such as memory, bandwidth, power,\
    \ and channel. However, managing\nthese resources and fulﬁlling user demands,\
    \ such as on-demand service and real-time visi-\nbility, is critical. Moreover,\
    \ an increasing number of smart applications, such as smart cities,\nsmart homes,\
    \ e-healthcare, smart grid, smart agriculture, autonomous vehicle, holographic\n\
    communication, etc., require real-time access to various resources. Therefore,\
    \ resource uti-\nlization, allocation, and management are required based on user\
    \ needs. Many researchers\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n11 of 26\nhave proposed efﬁcient\
    \ and optimal resource allocation schemes [54–57]; however, these\nschemes are\
    \ centralized, where a single authority veriﬁes the user and allocates resources\n\
    as per their need. They face various security threats, such as user identity,\
    \ information\nconﬁdentiality, malicious attacks, and a single point of failure.\
    \ Blockchain is considered to\nbe a promising technology to address the abovementioned\
    \ issues. For example, Li et al.,\nin [58], integrated blockchain with MEC-based\
    \ IoT applications to enhance the performance\nof network attributes and ensure\
    \ data-sharing authenticity. They presented the cloud–edge\ncollaborative resource\
    \ allocation mechanism by introducing a collective reinforcement\nlearning (CRL)\
    \ scheme. The authors jointly optimized the data ofﬂoading, blockchain node\n\
    intervals, and transmit power to enhance the energy efﬁciency of the proposed\
    \ scheme.\nIn [59], the authors incorporated blockchain technology with the Internet\
    \ of Every-\nthing (IoE) applications. They proposed a blockchain-enabled metaheuristic\
    \ approach\nfor resource allocation in a cyber twin-driven 6G-IoE environment.\
    \ Additionally, they\ndesigned an optimal resource allocation algorithm using\
    \ graph clustering based on a quasi-\noppositional search and rescue optimization\
    \ approach. Their ﬁndings showed that the\nproposed work reduced average system\
    \ cost to 2.63 and power consumption to 0.012 mW\ncompared to the predeﬁned work.\
    \ Further, Yang et al. [60] intended to optimize the In-\ndustrial IoT device’s\
    \ energy allocation by reducing energy consumption and computation\noverhead.\
    \ Therefore, they incorporated blockchain with IIoT systems and proposed a deep\n\
    Q-learning (DQL)-enabled optimization framework that ensures data security and\
    \ energy\nefﬁciency. Finally, the proposed scheme is compared with existing approaches,\
    \ and it\nperforms better in terms of the computation overhead and weighted cost.\n\

    \ for Public\nSafety Application\nThis section shows the working of the proposed\
    \ architecture, which is AI-, blockchain-,\nand 6G-based secure UAV communication\
    \ for public safety scenarios such as ﬁre incidents,\nroad accidents, and criminal\
    \ activity. Figure 2 shows ﬁve layers of the proposed architecture,\ni.e., data,\
    \ intelligence, blockchain, application, and communication layers. The working\
    \ of\neach layer is discussed as follows.\nFire incident\nRoad accident\nCriminal\

    13 of 26\n4.1. Data Layer\nIn this layer, we considered different emergency services,\
    \ such as ﬁre incidents, road\naccidents, and criminal activity, which require\
    \ faster communication to deliver sensitive\ninformation (e.g., road accidents\
    \ and medical emergencies) to the entities of the applica-\ntion layers. Here,\
    \ UAVs are incorporated to monitor the abovementioned scenarios and\ncollect data\
    \ from them to assist in making a decisive decision for different public safety\n\
    applications. For instance, if a criminal attempts to perform a crime at a particular\
    \ location,\nthe UAVs collect the data from the location and forward it to the\
    \ nearby police station.\nHowever, the criminal can hire an attacker to perform\
    \ adversarial attacks on the collected\ndata to avoid legal protection. An attacker\
    \ can perform different network-related attacks to\nexploit the crime data stored\
    \ in the central repository of police stations. Therefore, there is a\nrequirement\
    \ for an intelligent and automated approach that can seamlessly detect nefarious\n\
    patterns in the network and eradicate it from the public safety environment.\n\
    4.2. Intelligence Layer\nIn this layer, we apply different machine learning (ML)\
    \ classiﬁers that classify the data\ninto attack and nonattack categories. As\
    \ discussed in the data layer, UAVs collect data from\nvarious application scenarios\
    \ and store that data in comma-separated value (CSV) ﬁles.\nThe feature space\
    \ of the dataset is discussed as follows.\n4.2.1. Dataset Description\nIn that\
    \ direction, ﬁrst, we collect the criminal activity dataset from the Kaggle [61]\n\
    that classiﬁes the data into attack and nonattack from the criminal’s behavior.\
    \ However,\nthe collected dataset is not enough to identify the attack or nonattack\
    \ category; therefore, we\naccumulate more data from different sources having\
    \ relevant criminal activity information.\nThe ﬁnal dataset Ψ consists of different\
    \ attributes such as location, crime type, weapon type,\na weapon used or not,\
    \ etc. It has n rows, a1, a2, a3, . . . , an and m columns, b1, b2, b3, . . .\
    \ , bm.\na1, a2, a3, . . . , an ∈ Ψ\n(1)\nb1, b2, b3, . . . , bn ∈ Ψ\n(2)\nwhere\
    \ n is the total count of row 1575 and m is the total count of column 9. The collected\n\
    dataset is stored in the comma-separated values (CSV) ﬁle and further passed to\
    \ the next\nlayer, which is the intelligence layer. Here, there is a risk of data\
    \ modiﬁcation on the judicial\ndata collected from the aforementioned critical\
    \ application scenarios. Therefore, there is a\nneed for data security that protects\
    \ sensitive data from malicious threats.\n4.2.2. ML Classiﬁcation Approach\nThe\
    \ CSV ﬁle has missing values, noise, and unmanaged data columns that affect the\n\
    performance of the ML classiﬁer. To overcome this issue, we replace the missing\
    \ value\nwith central tendency, i.e., mean value. Further, the dataset has numeric\
    \ and textual values\n(alphanumeric), such as location, crime, and weapon types;\
    \ therefore, there is a need to\nconvert nonnumerical data into numeric data.\
    \ We apply the label-encoding technique Le\nthat assigns a numerical value to\
    \ each categorical value.\n∀b3, b4, b5\napply\n−−−→ Le ∈ Ψ\n(3)\nAfter reading\
    \ the CSV ﬁle, we realize that the dataset attributes have different datatype\n\
    D, such as an object, int, and ﬂoat. However, certain ML classiﬁers do not recognize\n\
    attributes with object datatype. To overcome this issue, we change the datatype\
    \ from\nﬂoating to the int using the astype() function.\n∀b7, b8\nchange\n−−−−→\
    \ D\n(4)\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n14 of 26\nThen, we analyze outliers that corrupt\
    \ the dataset and mislead the ML classiﬁers for\nthe wrong classiﬁcation. For\
    \ that, we apply outlier detection techniques that normalize\nthe data using a\
    \ standard scale without distorting differences in the ranges of values or\nlosing\
    \ information. Various normalization approaches exist, such as min-max, standard-\n\
    ization scaling, and Z-score. Here, we apply the min-max method that is mathematically\n\
    represented as follows.\nϑ\n′ =\nϑ − ϑmin\nϑmax − ϑmin\n(5)\nThis normalization\
    \ technique obtains all the scaled data into the range of 0 to 1.\nAfter preprocessing\
    \ the data, we split the data into two classes, training and testing, where\n\
    we train 80% of the data and validate 20% of the data. We pass the training dataset\
    \ (ΨT1)\ninto the ML classiﬁer that classiﬁes the data into attack (1) and nonattack\
    \ (0) categories.\nΨT1\nf ed\n−→ MLc\nclassi f y\n−−−−→ data\n(\n0\n1\n(6)\nAfter\
    \ training the model, we feed the testing dataset (ΨT2) into the ML classiﬁer\
    \ that\nvalidates the results based on the ΨT1.\nΨT2\nf ed\n−→ MLc\nclassi f y\n\
    −−−−→ data\n(\n0\n1\n(7)\nHere, we applied different ML classiﬁers, such as XGBoost,\
    \ random forest (RF), k-\nnearest neighbor (KNN), logistic regression (LR), and\
    \ support vector machine (SVM),\nthat classify the data into attack and nonattack.\
    \ Among all these classiﬁers, we obtained\nthe best results in terms of the accuracy\
    \ and log loss score from the XGBoost algorithm.\nThe XGBoost classiﬁer gives\
    \ effective results with the larger dataset. In this classiﬁer,\nthe data are\
    \ considered for each tree, and we can increase the depth of the tree and decrease\n\
    the min_child_weight that handles the overﬁtting issue in the dataset. The classiﬁed\
    \ data\nare susceptible, which raises the security issue in a public safety application.\
    \ To overcome\nthis issue, we utilize the IPFS-based blockchain network that offers\
    \ the data’s authentication\nand conﬁdentiality, preventing fraud on the dataset.\n\
    4.3. Blockchain Layer\nBlockchain is a decentralized distributed ledger technology\
    \ that keeps immutable\nrecords of transactions. This layer provides security\
    \ to the classiﬁed data by storing them in\na shared and transparent ledger that\
    \ is only accessible to the authorized network members.\nHere, the data are recorded\
    \ as a block in a blockchain network through the smart contract\n(Sc). Here, a\
    \ smart contract is an agreement between the contract creator and recipient that\n\
    executes automatically when all parties can be sure of the conclusion [10]. Then,\
    \ to provide\na reliable connection between contract and storage, there is an\
    \ interplanetary ﬁle system\n(IPFS) that offers efﬁcient storage and is able to\
    \ share a large ﬁle.\ndata\npass\n−−→ Sc\n(8)\nSc\nStoredata\n−−−−−→ I f\n(9)\n\
    where I f is an IPFS ﬁle system that utilizes content-addressing that uniquely\
    \ retrieves\neach ﬁle in the blockchain network. It stores the data in the blockchain\
    \ network using a\ndistributed hash table (HT). Each stored ﬁle is allocated a\
    \ unique hash value according to\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n15 of 26\nthe content\
    \ of the ﬁle. The mathematical representation of the aforementioned entity is\n\
    as follows.\nI f\ngenerate\n−−−−→ {H1, H1, . . . , Hn} store\n−−→ HT\n(10)\nHT\n\
    add\n−−→ {Block1, Block2, . . . , Blockn}\n(11)\n{Block1, Block2, . . . , Blockn}\
    \ ∈ Blockchainn\n(12)\nHere, different authorized users such as the ﬁre department,\
    \ hospital authority, and po-\nlice retrieve the secure data.\n4.4. Application\
    \ Layer\nThis layer includes different authorities such as the ﬁre department,\
    \ hospital authority,\nand police for ﬁre incidents, road accidents, and criminal\
    \ activity, respectively. This\nauthority uses the classiﬁed data for further\
    \ analysis, prediction, and research purposes.\nFor the proposed architecture,\
    \ we considered a criminal behavior dataset that has the crime\nlocation, crime\
    \ type, weapon used, weapon type, etc., attributes that classify the data into\n\
    attack (class 1) or nonattack (class 0). These data will be stored in the IPFS-based\
    \ blockchain.\nFrom that, the police department or any government-regularized\
    \ authority can access\nthe data securely. The advantage of this layer is that\
    \ the public safety regulatory body\n(e.g., emergency response team) acquires\
    \ the attack-free data. This is because the proposed\narchitecture prohibits any\
    \ data injection attacks on secure data storage (blockchain); even if\nthe attackers\
    \ perform any attack on the data storage, it will be known by each blockchain\n\
    participant due to the transparency features of the blockchain technology. Thus,\
    \ the\nproposed architecture offers robust security and reliable communication\
    \ for IoT-based\npublic safety applications.\n4.5. Communication Layer\nThis layer\
    \ comprises the relation between all four layers. We collected criminal\nactivity\
    \ data from the data layer that are further passed to the intelligence layer.\
    \ The data\nwere preprocessed in the intelligence layer and fed into the ML classiﬁer\
    \ that classiﬁes\nthem into the attack and nonattack classes. The classiﬁed data\
    \ are sensitive to security\nthreats and require immutable and secure storage.\
    \ For that, we store those data in the\ndecentralized and secure IPFS-based blockchain\
    \ layer. In the application layer, authorized\nusers, such as employees from the\
    \ ﬁre department, hospital, and police, access the data\nusing their smartphones,\
    \ tablet, laptop, or other 6G-based gadgets. They all need a strong\ncommunication\
    \ channel with a high data rate and low latency with secure and relevant\ndata\
    \ analysis. Moreover, the data layer to the blockchain layer is synchronized using\
    \ a\npipeline via the 6G network interface. Here, the data coming from the blockchain\
    \ layer\nare ﬁrst converted into the digital signal using a Bernoulli binary digital\
    \ converter and\nthen forwarded into a transmitter block. Here, for the simulation,\
    \ we considered MATLAB-\nbased 5G toolbox that offers certain parameters, such\
    \ as frequency range, modulation\ntechniques, channel impairments, sub-carrier\
    \ spacing, and bandwidth. By modifying these\nparameters, we can mimic the behavior\
    \ of 5G interface to 6G interface. We used a frequency\nrange of 75–110 GHz (operational\
    \ frequency—95 GHz) which is a potential frequency\nrange for beyond 5G speciﬁed\
    \ by the [62], sub-carrier spacing of 240 KHz, and modulation\nwas orthogonal\
    \ frequency division multiplexing (OFDMA), with polar coding for error\ndetection\
    \ and correction. The main aim is not to simulate the 6G network for the speciﬁed\n\
    problem formulation but to use essential properties of the 6G network. This is\
    \ because\nthe 6G simulation is not yet open-sourced by the scientiﬁc community;\
    \ therefore, we have\nto rely on a 5G simulation setup to impersonate the behavior\
    \ of the 6G network. Here,\nthe 6G network interface takes the stored data from\
    \ the blockchain layer and transmits\nthem to the application layer via a 6G network.\
    \ Thus, data, intelligence, and blockchain\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n16 of 26\n\
    layers cumulatively act as a sender that intends to share the data to the application\
    \ layer\nvia adopting 6G communication for faster and reliable communication.\n\
    5. Result and Discussion\nThis section highlightsexperimentation details and results\
    \ analysis of the proposed\narchitecture in terms of accuracy, log loss score,\
    \ and validation curve.\n5.1. Experimental Setup\nThe proposed architecture utilizes\
    \ a Google Colaboratory notebook for developing\nan intelligence layer that uses\
    \ ML classiﬁers, Remix integrated development environment\n(IDE) for the blockchain\
    \ layer, and MATLAB 2022a for the communication layer. The Google\nColaboratory\
    \ notebook is a web IDE for Python programming that uses various Python\nlibraries\
    \ such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Sklearn, and Scipy for the ML classiﬁers.\n\
    To simulate the working of the intelligent layer, we incorporated the Google Colaboratory\n\
    notebook that uses ML classiﬁers and provides the classiﬁcation of the data. Here,\
    \ different\nML classiﬁers, such as XGboost, RF, KNN, LR, and SVM, have hyperparameters\
    \ that tailor\nthe classiﬁers’ behavior and improve performance. Table 3 depicts\
    \ the parameters used in\nthe proposed architecture. Here, n_estimators, learning_rate,\
    \ and max_depth are used for\nthe XGBoost classiﬁer, where n_estimators represents\
    \ the tree’s count. Then, learning_rate is\nused as the regularization parameter\
    \ that shows the step size, and the max_depth parameter\ncontrols the overﬁtting\
    \ in the model. The RF classiﬁer used n_estimators value of 200 and\nmax_depth\
    \ value of 1. Moreover, KNN uses the n_neighbors parameter to show the total\n\
    count of neighbors that are utilizedby default for the k-neighbors queries. Furthermore,\n\
    the uniform weights specify that all points are equally weighted in each neighborhood.\
    \ The\nLR classiﬁer uses random_state that shufﬂes the data and the “lbfgs” solver\
    \ with max_iter\nthat uses the solvers to converge. For the SVM classiﬁer, we\
    \ use different parameters such\nas gamma, probability, and kernel. Here, we use\
    \ rbf and linear kernel with the kernel\ncoefﬁcient value such as gamma = “auto”,\
    \ which means 1/n_f eatures.\nTable 3. Parameters of the proposed architecture.\n\

    Network\nRinkeby’s\nEnvironment\nRemix VM\nThe classiﬁed data have sensitive and\
    \ conﬁdential information and require secure\nstorage. Therefore, the classiﬁed\
    \ data are stored in the IPFS-based blockchain network\nusing a smart contract\
    \ in the blockchain layer. The smart contract is implemented using\nsolidity language\
    \ on the Remix IDE with different functions, such as criminal behaviors()\nto\
    \ identify the criminal, weapon() to determine the crime type, addlocation() to\
    \ know\nthe crime spot, updatecount(), and many more. The smart contract is deployed\
    \ over the\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n17 of 26\nRinkeby’s network. On a successful\
    \ compilation and deployment of the smart contract,\nvalidated or authenticated\
    \ data from the smart contract are forwarded to the IPFS-based\npublic blockchain\
    \ for secure storage. Further, the 6G network is simulated on MATLAB\n2022a using\
    \ a 5G toolbox. This is because there is not yet any open-source software available\n\
    that provides 6G properties and can integrate that with real-world applications.\
    \ Due to this\nconstraint, we utilized a 5G-based simulation toolbox, where we\
    \ changed the simulation\nparameters, for example, changing the bandwidth allocation,\
    \ transmit power, sub-carrier\nspacing (240 KHz), and modulation (OFDMA) techniques\
    \ of the 5G network to impersonate\na 6G network.\n5.2. Performance Evaluation\
    \ of the Proposed Architecture\nIn this subsection, we discuss the results of\
    \ the ML classiﬁers, blockchain, and 6G\ncommunication. First, we analyze the\
    \ performance of the different ML classiﬁers, such as\nXGBoost, RF, KNN, LR, and\
    \ SVM, for UAV-based public safety applications such as ﬁre\nincidents, road accidents,\
    \ and criminal activity. Here, ML classiﬁers are used to classify the\ndata into\
    \ attack means class 1 and nonattack means class 0. We considered the criminal\n\
    activity dataset that has the crime type, location, weapon type, and criminal\
    \ behavior\nrecords. These records are useful for classifying the arrest and nonarrest\
    \ categories, which\nidentiﬁes whether the data are vulnerable to attack or not.\
    \ Here, we fed 80% of the data\ninto the ML classiﬁer that provide training to\
    \ the classiﬁer. Then, the 20% testing dataset\nis passed into the ML classiﬁer\
    \ that validates the training dataset. It also ensures that the\ntrained data\
    \ will behave consistently and produce the expected results.\nHere, Figure 3 depicts\
    \ the performance of the ML classiﬁers in terms of the accuracy,\nlog loss score,\
    \ and validation curve. The accuracy (α) of the ML classiﬁers represents\nthe\
    \ ratio of the correctly predicted values out of a total number of predictions.\
    \ Using an\naccuracy measure, we know how many times the ML classiﬁer correctly\
    \ classiﬁed the\ndataset. We can express accuracy in true positive (Tρ), false\
    \ positive (Fρ), true negative (Tη),\nand false negative (Fη) values that are\
    \ used to represent the number of correct and incorrect\npredictions of the proposed\
    \ ML classiﬁer. During the simulation, we observe that a single\naccuracy parameter\
    \ is insufﬁcient to remark on the best ML classiﬁer. Therefore, we require\nadditional\
    \ measures such as precision (β) and recall (γ). Precision represents the correctness\n\
    of the ML classiﬁer. It determines how good the classiﬁer is at predicting a speciﬁc\
    \ class. It\nshows the ratio between the true positive samples and all the positive\
    \ outcomes Tρ + Fρ.\nThe recall measure represents the count, which shows how\

    \ the ratio between true positive samples out\nof all the cases of true positive\
    \ and false negative samples Tρ + Fη. Furthermore, harmonic\nmean of the precision\

    \ such as XGBoost, RF,\nKNN, LR, and SVM. From the graph, we found that XGBoost\
    \ classiﬁer gives better accuracy\n(87.93%) compared to the other classiﬁers because\
    \ it handles sparse data and executes\nparallel computing. On the contrary, SVM\
    \ did not perform well because it required high\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n18 of\
    \ 26\ntraining time for the large dataset. Table 4 shows that the XGBoost classiﬁer\
    \ outperforms\nany other ML classiﬁers in terms of accuracy, precision, recall,\
    \ and F1-score.\nTo further measure the ML classiﬁer’s performance, we used a\
    \ log loss score that\nindicates how close the prediction probability is to the\
    \ corresponding actual value in the\nbinary classiﬁcation case. It represents\
    \ the probabilities of the correct class label, which\nmeans that if the predicted\
    \ probability is high, it will obtain a low log loss core and\nvice versa. Figure\
    \ 3b shows the log loss score of the different ML classiﬁers that evaluate\nthe\
    \ performance of the classiﬁers. From the empirical results, we analyzed that\
    \ there is\na higher divergence in the log loss score of the LR and SVM classiﬁers.\
    \ Here, XGBoost’s\nlog loss score is small; therefore, it performed well compared\
    \ to the other ML classiﬁers.\nAdditionally, Figure 3c depicts the validation\
    \ curve of the XGBoost classiﬁer that indicates\nthe sensitivity between changes\
    \ in a classiﬁer’s accuracy and changes in some parameters\nof the classiﬁer.\
    \ Here, if the training score is more than the validation score, the estimator\
    \ is\noverﬁtting, and otherwise performs well.\nXGBoost\nRF\nKNN\nLR\nSVM\nML\

    \ of the literature we observed does not\namalgamate the mentioned key enabler\
    \ technologies, i.e., blockchain, 6G network, AI,\netc. Their approach is based\
    \ on a single technology, but by using that, there must be a\nSensors 2023, 23,\
    \ 969\n19 of 26\nloophole that exists that the attackers can exploit. Therefore,\
    \ an amalgamation of technology\nis needed to offer a secure pipeline for data\
    \ exchange for critical applications, such as\npublic safety applications. The\
    \ work of [63] is similar to our proposed work with better\naccuracies; however,\
    \ their work is based on an image dataset where they used rigorous\ndata augmentation\
    \ techniques and deep learning approaches to acquire better accuracies.\nBecause\
    \ of data augmentation and deep learning approaches, their proposed model is\n\
    highly complex and does not have a commendable system response time. This is because\n\
    deep learning techniques have a higher training time, due to which the response\
    \ becomes\nhigher; hence, one could not send critical data on time to the application\
    \ layer. This can\nalso be seen in Figure 4a, where performance overhead is compared\
    \ between [63] and the\nproposed work. It is clear from the graph that due to\
    \ the high training time, the work of [63]\nhas a high-performance overhead compared\
    \ to our work. Contrary, the proposed work uses\ntext data where minimal data\
    \ preprocessing steps are required to train ML classiﬁers. This\ncan be seen in\
    \ Figure 4b, where training time is computed for all ML classiﬁers. XGBoost is\n\
    outperforming other classiﬁers by attaining a training time of 280.97 s. In [63],\
    \ the authors\nused 1400 iterations to obtain a better training accuracy, which\

    \ the blockchain scalability comparison between the proposed\nblockchain with\
    \ IPFS and the traditional blockchain. Generally, an IPFS-based blockchain is\n\
    a decentralized protocol and is open to the public; therefore, anyone who has\
    \ content hash\ncan access the network. Moreover, it offers persistent data storage,\
    \ fault tolerance against a\nsingle point of failure, and a censorship resistance\
    \ mechanism. Due to the aforesaid bene-\nﬁts, the IPFS-based blockchain has a\
    \ better response time than the traditional blockchain\n(i.e., not using IPFS).\
    \ In addition, the immutable nature of the IPFS-based blockchain eases\nnumerous\
    \ cybersecurity threats. It has no overheads of the consensus protocols to add\n\
    the data and only stores the content hash in the network. Thus, the consensus\
    \ and data\naggregation with transformation must be applied before submitting\
    \ a block or ﬁle to IPFS\nstorage. Due to this mechanism, the IPFS-based blockchain\
    \ is faster and more scalable than\nthe conventional blockchain network.\nFurthermore,\
    \ the proposed architecture consists of UAVs for data accumulation and\ndissemination\
    \ between different participants of public safety applications. As public\nsafety\
    \ applications are categorized under the umbrella of mission-critical applications,\n\
    they must ensure reliable and low-latency communication among all the entities\
    \ of the\nproposed architecture. Here, 6G networks fulﬁll the requirements essential\
    \ to the proposed\narchitecture. The 6G network offers high data-transmission\
    \ rates, with ultra-low latency\nthat makes it 1000 times faster than 5G networks.\
    \ Therefore, the network’s transmitter and\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n20 of 26\n\

    \ of Adoption of Blockchain in 6G Network\nBlockchain technology entrenches data\
    \ security, user identity, information authenticity,\nand privacy mechanisms into\
    \ the 6G communication system. However, poor efﬁciency of\nconsensus mechanism,\
    \ computation overhead of network systems, storage capacity, limited\nnetwork\
    \ and computing resources, and cross-network sharing imposes a new challenge in\n\
    blockchain-based 6G application. This section provides the possible challenges\
    \ of adopting\nblockchain in the 6G network. Figure 7 displays the research challenges\
    \ when adopting\nblockchain in the 6G network.\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n21 of 26\n\

    \ Challenges\nFigure 7. Blockchain adoption challenges in 6G network.\n6.1. Storage\
    \ Capacity\nBlockchain offers decentralized architecture with an immutable ledger\
    \ that securely\nstores the data transaction that cannot be tampered or altered.\
    \ Blockchain permanently\nkeeps data in immutable blocks and is not allowed to\
    \ be altered or deleted by anyone; there-\nfore, it keeps increasing data volume\
    \ and raising data storage capacity issues. During peak\ntime, an increasing number\
    \ of users and data transactions ﬂood the network, leading to\ntransaction delays\
    \ and network overloading issues. Moreover, due to a growing demand\nfor data\
    \ storage capacity and bandwidth, nodes cannot synchronize with each other to\n\
    join the network [64]. Various cloud platforms exist, such as IPFS, Merkle tree-based\
    \ ﬁle\nsystems (MTFS), StorJ, swarm, etc., that resolve the data storage issue\
    \ in the blockchain-\nbased 6G network. The research community has adopted these\
    \ data storage platforms\nwith blockchain and proposed solutions in supply chain\
    \ management, smart agriculture,\nsmart city, etc., to resolve storage issues.\
    \ For example, Pawar et al. [65] proposed an\nIPFS-enabled blockchain repository\
    \ for supply chain management to minimize ﬁle upload\nand download time. Kumar\
    \ et al. [66] introduced a secured privacy-preserving scheme to\nmaintain scalability\
    \ using IPFS-based off-chain storage for smart agricultural UAVs data.\nHowever,\
    \ these solutions face reliability, privacy, and security issues, such as that\
    \ IPFS does\nnot provide private ﬁle storage; it only offers public ﬁle access.\
    \ Likewise, MTFS has access\nspeed and scalability problems with public ﬁle systems.\
    \ From that, it has been noticed that\nthe limited data storage capacity of blockchain\
    \ is a notable challenge in the current and\nfuture networks.\n6.2. Poor Efﬁciency\
    \ of Consensus Mechanism\nThe blockchain network depends on various consensus\
    \ mechanisms such as prac-\ntical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT), proof-of-work,\
    \ and proof-of-stake for enterprise\nand permissionless blockchains. However,\
    \ these algorithms are inadequate because they\nconsume more time and energy for\
    \ block production. Researchers have designed various\nconsensus algorithms to\
    \ monitor and verify block production in 6G network. For example,\nWan et al.\
    \ [67] and Zhang et al. [68] proposed a consensus-algorithm-based strategy for\n\
    collision avoidance in UAV swarms and ﬁxed-wing UAVs, respectively. Still, there\
    \ is\nscope for research in this ﬁeld because the algorithms require higher energy\
    \ consumption\nand are vulnerable to malicious attacks such as the 51% attack,\
    \ Sybil attack, race attack,\nand Finney attack.\nSensors 2023, 23, 969\n22 of\
    \ 26\n6.3. Cross-Network or Cross-Domain Sharing\nBlockchain introduces an interoperability\
    \ feature that offers a cross-chain mechanism\nto transmit asserts, transaction\
    \ values, virtual contracts, and data between two or more\nblockchain networks.\
    \ Unfortunately, the lack of adequate privacy and maintaining the same\nlevel\
    \ of security raise cross-network sharing issues in blockchain-based 6G applications.\n\
    Recently, much work has been carried out for cross-network sharing in blockchain-enabled\n\
    smart applications. For example, in [69], the authors proposed a cross-network\
    \ data-\nsharing mechanism for the smart grid. Likewise, Xue et al. [70] presented\
    \ a cross-domain\nauthentication scheme for medical information sharing. Besides\
    \ these advantages, several\nchallenges remain to be addressed, such as data ownership\
    \ protection with QoS-based\nnetwork heterogeneity.\n6.4. Computation Overhead\n\
    The 6G applications are bandwidth- and resource-hungry; they require real-time\
    \ data\ntransmission. However, the increasing number of network users hinders\
    \ the QoS of the\ndeveloped applications. Therefore, blockchain integrates with\
    \ 6G technologies, reducing\nthe complex computational cost. A lot of research\
    \ has been carried out to overcome the\ncomputation overhead issue in blockchain-based\
    \ 6G applications. For instance, the work of\nChai et al. [71] offered a diffused-PBFT\
    \ approach to reduce computation overhead and con-\nsensus latency. Likewise,\
    \ in [72], the authors proposed an LSTM-based scheme to optimize\nthe computation\
    \ ofﬂoading in a satellite-UAV-based IoT system. Then, Ahmed et al. [73]\nintroduced\
    \ blockchain in VANET for vehicle authentication and emergency message trans-\n\
    mission between the Internet of vehicles (IoVs). They encrypted blockchain servers\
    \ using\nRSA-1024, a digital signature algorithm, to minimize the computation\
    \ overhead. However,\neach participating block of the blockchain and consensus\
    \ algorithms, such as proof-of-work\nand PBFT, require more computational power\
    \ for calculation. On top of that, the continu-\nous growth of IoT devices and\
    \ smart applications leads to high congestion in the network\nand computation\
    \ overhead, where it is infeasible to properly apply a blockchain-based\nconsensus\
    \ approach.\n6.5. Dynamically Changing Environment\nDigital technologies such\
    \ as AI, IoT, and robotics are continuously growing and chang-\ning the future\
    \ perspective, industrial demand, and human behavior. These technologies\nare\
    \ incorporated into various smart applications such as e-healthcare, smart homes,\
    \ smart\nagriculture, holographic communications and many more. According to user\
    \ demand\nfor a high transmission rate with lower latency, these technologies\
    \ should respond in the\nreal-time environment of industries and organizations.\
    \ Moreover, blockchain networks\nare incorporated in dynamic, experimental, and\
    \ sustainable future technologies to intro-\nduce trust, authenticity, security,\
    \ and privacy [74]. The research community has offered\nmany solutions based on\
    \ blockchain for a dynamic changing environment. For example,\nXiao et al. [75]\
    \ proposed temporal pattern attention and enabled the LSTM approach to\nsense\
    \ the change of natural gas deliverability in natural-gas-based IoT systems. They\n\
    utilized a blockchain-based smart contract that dynamically matched the purchase\
    \ and\nsale details of the gas; it also enhanced the buyer’s and the seller’s\
    \ interests. As a result,\nthey could predict the outcome of natural gas in real-time\
    \ according to the dynamic de-\nmand for sales. However, modeling such a real-time\
    \ technique is highly complex and\ntime-consuming in a dynamic changing environment.\n\
    7. Conclusions\nBlockchain is distributed ledger technology that offers reliability,\
    \ security, immutabil-\nity, and privacy in the 6G-based futuristic smart application.\
    \ It proves its effectiveness by\nproviding trust been two parties in the wireless\
    \ communication network. Many research\ncommunities have discussed the adoption\
    \ of blockchain for 6G-based smart applications\nwith new digital technologies,\
    \ such as IoT, AI, and MEC. This technology offers real-time\nSensors 2023, 23,\
    \ 969\n23 of 26\ncommunication with a higher transmission rate; however, it adds\
    \ various challenges, mak-\ning it difﬁcult to adapt to a 6G network. Therefore,\
    \ it is required to propose an exhaustive\nwork highlighting the ﬁndings of multiple\
    \ researchers who worked in the blockchain-\nbased 6G networks. We discussed various\
    \ 6G applications where blockchain is adopted\nfor the security and privacy of\
    \ data. Further, we discussed blockchain-based services in\nthe 6G network. Then,\
    \ we proposed layer-wise architecture by adopting AI, blockchain,\nand a 6G network\
    \ to protect sensitive crime data in public safety applications. An attacker\n\
    tries to manipulate criminal activity information systems to avoid legal action;\
    \ therefore,\nthe proposed architecture offers a secure pipeline to protect public\
    \ safety applications from\nthe nefarious offense. The proposed architecture is\
    \ evaluated on numerous performance\nevaluation metrics such as accuracy, scalability,\
    \ and packet drop rate. Lastly, we identiﬁed\nthe challenge of adopting the blockchain\
    \ in the 6G wireless networks.\nIn the future, based on this work, we will develop\
    \ a novel solution that mitigates the\nidentiﬁed issues and improves the performance\
    \ of the blockchain-based 6G system.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization:\

    Metrics Footnotes Abstract: In this article, we present a framework for performing
    a systematic literature review on the implementation of emerging business practices
    and the adoption of these key technologies: three-dimensional printing, artificial
    intelligence, blockchain, computing, digital applications, geospatial technologies,
    immersive environments, Internet of things, open and crowd-based platforms, proximity
    technologies, and robotics. Through the content analysis of the full text of scientific
    papers, emerging practices are captured and then classified within a group of
    standardized labels. This allows to summarize an emerging practice as the use
    of a key technology within a business context—represented by industry, business
    function, and business process adopting the technology—with the aim of achieving
    improvements in terms of business performance. The adoption of this methodology
    allows the recognition of the opportunities for companies of enhancing performance
    through key technologies. With this study, the framework is tested by classifying
    more than 22 000 scientific articles and extracting 15 708 emerging practices.
    The explicative power of data collected is demonstrated by performing an explorative
    analysis aiming at illustrating the state-of-the-art of emerging practices. Moreover,
    by employing association rules algorithms, 262 practices are found as the most
    frequent and relevant and are the candidate for becoming future best practices.

    The fourth industrial revolution, also referred to as Industry 4.0, focused the
    attention of policymakers, researchers, practitioners, industry analysts, and
    managers on the employment of key technologies to support future investments,
    consumption, growth, employment, and trade [1], [2]. Despite the initial reference
    to the manufacturing industry and the concept of smart factory [3], [4], the implications
    of Industry 4.0 also regard other sectors where technologies can be a driver of
    business performance improvement [5], [6], [7]. Within the industry 4.0 paradigm,
    the appropriate implementation of key technologies is fundamental to achieve positive
    outcomes [8]. Such technologies can be considered as either “new” since they are
    featured by radical novelty, with promising but uncertain impacts [1] or “cutting
    edge” because they employ the most current and high-level developments. Therefore,
    companies can rely on these technologies to carry out new emerging business practices,
    which depart from traditional and current best practices, in order to achieve
    significant competitive advantage. However, since the improvements of business
    performance determined by the adoption of emerging practices are unproven and
    not easily repeatable, companies investing in such technologies have to accept
    the risks of failure [9]. Thus, many companies are reluctant to change since emerging
    practices only promise to solve business problems [10]. Indeed, they prefer to
    use standard or best practices employing consolidated technologies that have proven
    a positive impact on the business, with a limited risk. Scientific literature
    supports companies, providing examples of application, even though the scientific
    debate is often oriented on technical challenges rather than the organizational
    ones [11], [12], [13]. For instance, the literature on blockchain has particularly
    stressed technical issues, but its real impact on the business is still questionable
    and under investigation [13], [14]. Anyway, the literature anticipates emerging
    trends in technology management [15] and provides significant suggestions to companies.
    Because of the wide number of scientific papers facing the issues of emerging
    practices, the research is fragmented in thousands of contributions, and it is
    difficult to understand the current state-of-the-art. The purpose of this work
    is to present a framework for performing a systematic literature review on the
    state-of-the-art of emerging practices so that researchers can monitor the advancements
    in terms of implementation of key technologies, and companies can understand which
    applications have been sufficiently tested and can be considered worthy of consideration.
    Such a framework supports the building of a repository of emerging practices employing
    key technologies based on the standardization of the emerging practices captured
    by content analysis of scientific papers’ full texts. Indeed, scientific literature
    anticipates future business implementations so that, by examining the repository,
    it is possible to forecast the future role of technologies [15], [16]. Each emerging
    practice is summarized as the adoption of a key technology within a specific business
    context, with implications in terms of enhancement of the business performance.
    It is important to define the business impact because companies can have a clear
    understanding of the potential effects that will derive from the implementation
    of key technology. This reduces the uncertainty and the risks associated with
    the adoption of emerging practices since the positive effects on business performance
    can be evaluated on real case studies and projects from which the practice is
    extracted. At the end of July 2022, more than 22 000 scientific papers published
    from 2019 to 2022 were studied and 15 708 practices recorded within the repository.
    Data within the repository were recorded by a team of researchers in the field
    of organization, engineering, and technology management. In particular, by following
    an inductive approach [17], [18], 11 categories of key technologies are defined:
    3-D printing, artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, computing, digital applications,
    geospatial technologies, immersive environments, Internet of Things (IoT), open
    and crowd-based platforms, proximity technologies, and robotics. In the literature,
    no other literature review covers such a large set of key technologies and no
    study based on thousands of scientific papers was found. Consequently, in addition
    to practical and managerial usefulness of the framework, from the analysis of
    the repository, many interesting insights emerge for scholars. Each emerging practice
    has different opportunities of implementation and peculiarities in terms of impacts
    on business performance, industry, business function, and business process where
    it can be carried out. To show the explicative power of the framework, this article
    will present an explorative analysis of the repository in order to answer the
    following research question. Which are the most frequent and relevant emerging
    practices that could become future best practices? Indeed, emerging practices
    are analyzed by implementing association rule mining techniques in order to understand
    for each key technology, which are the emerging practices that are likely to become
    the future best practices, since they are both most frequently proposed in case
    studies and with higher rates of stability in terms of the type of impact on the
    business performance that are able to achieve. The rest of this article is organized
    as follows. An overview is presented of the concepts of key technologies and emerging
    practices to underscore the usefulness of detecting novel trends for achieving
    competitive advantage and the classification of key technologies to put in evidence
    the limitations of current literature. Indeed, with this work, 87 key technologies
    are considered, grouped in 11 macrocategories. Furthermore, the framework is presented.
    Indeed, to improve the quality of the systematic literature review, from the content
    analysis of scientific papers, a combination of the standardized variables and
    labels is determined so that it is possible to build a database of key technologies
    from scientific papers. Indeed, the analysis and interpretation of scientific
    papers was devoted to converting information into the standardized fields of the
    repository, as discussed in the section. These variables are linked to key technologies,
    business context, and impact on business performance. As to key technologies,
    a focus on the taxonomy of 11 key technologies, derived from a significant classification
    activity, is presented. Furthermore, the other variables—industry, business function,
    business process, and impacts—are introduced, and information about data collection
    from scientific papers is reported. Then, results of the analysis of the repository
    are described with a first descriptive analysis of each variable and a subsequent
    exploration of the most frequent and relevant combinations of variables that can
    be considered as the basis of potential future best practices for businesses.
    Such an analysis is performed by employing association rules techniques, which
    are machine learning algorithms that are able to find patterns and capture significant
    relationships among variables. Discussion will underscore theoretical contributions,
    methodological issues, and practical/managerial implications. Finally, conclusions
    will close the work. SECTION II. Theoretical Background A. Key Technologies and
    Business Practices According to the supply-chain operations reference (SCOR) model,
    a business practice is “a unique way to configure a process or a set of processes,”
    using particular technologies, skills, sequences, or methods. Three types of practices
    are widely acknowledged: standard, best, and emerging. Standard practices are
    the default practices that companies use to do business that do not provide any
    competitive advantage or significant cost saving and are associated with low risks
    and results [19]. Best practices are the best current repeatable and structured
    practices that have a proven positive impact on the business, with moderate risk
    and results [20]. Emerging practices employ new technologies or knowledge and
    differ in the way of organizing processes. Compared with best practices, they
    are unproven and not easily repeatable; therefore, they are associated with high
    risks [21]. However, if correctly and opportunely implemented, they could provide
    a particular competitive advantage. Therefore, when firms plan to implement emerging
    practices, they decide to accept the risk of failure, hoping to achieve a significant
    performance improvement [20]. Early adoption could lead to significant rewards
    but accepting the risk of failure. In line with the industry 4.0 perspective,
    the use of key technologies within emerging practices is more and more frequent
    [22]. Key technologies assume a fundamental role because they can “unlock” new
    practical applications where they are employed to achieve relevant results in
    terms of outcome, e.g., organizational or market performance [23]. Practices employing
    key technologies cannot be considered best practices since new technologies are
    potential breakthroughs that can only promise to solve business problems, but
    it is necessary to prove their real usefulness. Recently, scientific research
    has focused the attention on the adoption of key technologies to improve, convert,
    and renew traditional practices. The Industry 4.0 paradigm, based on enhancing
    productivity through digitalization, automation, and connectivity with the progress
    of key technologies, is expected to affect many aspects of society and industry
    [24]. This new concept is based on cyber–physical systems in which there is an
    integration of both virtual and physical participants. The purpose of this paradigm
    is to effectively control systems in real time by exploiting the Internet and
    other new technologies [25]. This industrial vision is considered the right solution
    for solving problems, such as accelerating innovation cycles, increasing demand
    volatility, and increasing product personalization [26]. In particular, the implementation
    of key technologies will allow industries to increase production where necessary
    through the modularity and flexibility of production systems [27]. Key technologies
    go through several stages before their general acceptance and adoption by society.
    Various standard adoption models have recently been proposed to help predicting
    the diffusion of key technologies by providing a structured perspective on the
    degree of maturity of a key technology, through different stages [28]. Among such
    adoption models, the Gartner Hype Cycle takes into account two elements—hype level
    and business maturity—and classifies a technology lifecycle into five stages:
    technology trigger, peak of inflated expectations, through of disillusionment,
    slope of enlightenment, and plateau of productivity. Then, technologies are also
    associated with three additional elements: the maturity level, the time to plateau,
    and the market penetration [29]. As a recent example, blockchain technology had
    a period of initial excitement in 2016, reached the peak of inflated expectations
    around 2018, and entered the trough of disillusionment stage at the end of 2019
    [30]. In addition to the Gartner curve, the literature suggested various standard
    curves to portray the evolution of technology over time, such as the “S-shaped”
    or logistics performance curve, showing the cumulative performance growth for
    a technology [31], [32]. In addition, in the literature, there are technology
    adoption curves that show the speed of technology adoption by both consumers and
    companies [33]. According to this approach, the adoption rate is classified into
    five different categories: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority,
    and laggards [34]. Among these categories, early adopters can be described as
    visionaries because they are the most willing to invest time and resources in
    technological innovation in order to test and validate the technologies in their
    business processes [35], [36]. In this way, early adopters motivate other companies
    to invest in certain key technologies to bridge the competitive gap [37]. The
    adoption of key technologies is considered important for companies because it
    allows them to obtain competitive advantage for two reasons: to support business
    processes in order to reduce costs and to save time by improving production yields
    [9]. However, adopting a key technology is difficult, and it is not always possible
    to predict its diffusion using these adoption models. On the one hand, firms could
    carry out an aggressive strategy and early implement the technology to maximize
    the returns from being early adopter. From the other hand, conservative strategies
    could suggest minimizing risks by adopting innovation later, when a wider number
    of positive cases of implementation have been recognized. For this reason, it
    is important to assess key technologies and their trends early on, as they may
    have an impact on future practices that could change businesses. Still, it is
    difficult to understand which emerging practices that implement key technologies
    will be the future best practices widely accepted by companies. This work provides
    a methodology to monitor the state-of-the-art of the implementation of key technologies
    in business contexts so that it is possible to find which applications have the
    highest potential for becoming best practices in the future. To contextualize
    the areas of adoption, the methodology suggests a taxonomy for technologies, industries,
    business functions, business processes, and impacts so that the most interesting
    applications can be identified by the combination of these elements. The proposed
    framework aims to guide companies toward the adoption of emerging practices through
    the application of specific key technologies in line with the perspective of industry
    4.0. The novelty of the article is to outline a map of key technologies that industrialists,
    managers, and other actors could take into account to improve business functions
    and business performance. In this way, stakeholders can consider the implementation
    of emerging practices to make decisions with greater awareness regarding the possible
    achievable results. B. Classification of Key Technologies In the literature, there
    are several works that classify and investigate key technologies in different
    areas [4], [8]. Scientific research is predominantly focused on the analysis of
    single technologies and discussion of single areas of application. For example,
    Rolandi et al. [6] classified key technologies for the agriculture sector to assess
    their possible impacts, while Gkoumas and Tsakalidis [38] evaluated the usefulness
    of key technologies in the transportation sector. Several researchers evaluated
    and classified the technologies in specific areas. For example, Ponis et al. [39]
    analyzed the influence of key technologies in the perspective of the circular
    economy. Nti et al. [40] examined the impacts that these technologies can have
    on engineering processes. Other authors investigated the positive and negative
    effects on business that digital technologies can generate within supply chains
    [41], [42]. Many studies classify the implementation of the technologies in the
    industrial environment and try to identify the challenges and benefits [43]. Others
    evaluated how the new technologies transform and improve operations management
    practices [44], [45]. Even though there is a plethora of studies that classify
    and investigate key technologies, the originality of this work consists in deeply
    exploring the impacts of various technologies in different business contexts and
    analyzing the multiple practices that could be developed by companies. This research
    aims at investigating the implementation of key technologies in all contexts,
    departing from the current literature. As shown in Table I, studies in the literature
    are limited to only some areas, such as single sectors or specific technologies.
    In consideration of the aim of this research, it is necessary to take into account
    thousands of scientific articles. The current literature considers only a few
    practices at a time and there is not a formal purpose to present a standardized
    taxonomy of key technologies. For example, many articles are focused on a specific
    area, such as supply-chain management (SCM), Industry 4.0, or the manufacturing
    industry. Moreover, the classification of key technologies is not derived from
    a deep investigation. Finally, the number of analyzed articles and the identified
    practices are much lower than in this work. This depends on the different purpose
    of this research, but it can be considered as an additional contribution since
    the wider range of analyzed articles guarantees higher robustness to the suggested
    taxonomy. TABLE I Classification of Key Technologies From Scientific Literature
    Extending the comparison to review papers, the literature is featured by several
    works that analyze a significant number of articles; however, their final purpose
    is to provide an overview of the current state-of-the-art of scientific research
    without identifying the emerging practices that are worthy of implementation [49],
    [50]. The suggested framework differs from the others in the literature since
    it allows the analysis with different perspectives. First, the classification
    of technologies, impacts, industries, business functions, and processes derives
    from a literature review of thousands of scientific articles and has been constantly
    updated and reviewed during the data collection. Second, this research aims at
    identifying the links among emerging practices, impacts, key technologies, business
    functions, business processes, and industries in a formal way. Hence, the novelty
    of the work, if compared with previous articles, is to focus globally on the impacts
    that key technologies can produce on business functions in multiple areas and
    sectors. Third, the proposed framework has a greater number of practices analyzed
    than the other articles currently published. SECTION III. Methodology A. Framework
    for Investigating the Adoption of Key Technologies The suggested framework aims
    at standardizing emerging practices collected from the systematic literature review.
    An emerging practice consists of the implementation of one or more key technologies
    within a specific business context in order to enhance business performance. Therefore,
    to classify and standardize information extracted from the content analysis of
    the full text of each scientific paper, an emerging practice is recorded in a
    repository as the combination of various labels referring to key technology, business
    context of application, and expected impact in terms of performance enhancement
    (see Fig. 1). Fig. 1. Combination of variables linked to an emerging practice.
    Show All This will allow the switch from text to categorical variables that is
    important to exploit information to perform analysis on the state-of-the-art of
    key technologies. In particular, the repository reports 87 specific key technologies,
    which are classified into 11 macrocategories. The context of application of the
    key technology within the focal emerging practice is defined with the industry
    of adoption of the practice, the business function that employs it, and the business
    process in which the technology is exploited. The variables associated with the
    business context are important. Indeed, emerging practices that employ key technologies
    are risky since there is not a consolidated implementation in businesses. To reduce
    such a risk, it is useful to define the boundaries of application of the technology
    by clarifying industry, business function, and business process where it can be
    used. As to the impact on the business performance, it can be either internal,
    i.e., the focal emerging practice enhances organizational performance, or external,
    i.e., improvements in terms of market performance can be achieved. To demonstrate
    the usefulness of this research, once identified all emerging practices within
    the scientific articles under investigation, a machine learning algorithm belonging
    to association rule mining will be employed to identify within the sample the
    most frequent and relevant emerging practices that could become future best practices
    (see Fig. 2). Therefore, starting from the entire set of emerging practices, the
    algorithm will extract a subset of those that are less risky and are more likely
    to provide the expected impact on business performance, taking into account the
    business context where the key technology is implemented. The following sections
    will provide a formal description of each variable. Fig. 2. From emerging practices
    to future best practices. Show All B. Taxonomy of Key Technologies By employing
    an inductive approach [17], [18], a taxonomy of 11 categories of key technologies
    has been built. Although some classifications are already present in the literature
    [4], [8], these only consider certain groups of key technologies, as previously
    shown in Table I. On the contrary, this research has achieved a classification
    as the result of the study of thousands of scientific articles where hundreds
    of categories of technologies were detected. From this bottom-up procedure, specific
    technologies have been detected and then grouped by macrocategories. Table II
    presents the 11 macrocategories of key technologies that in total enclose 87 specific
    technologies. TABLE II Taxonomy of Key Technologies The 3-D printing, or additive
    manufacturing, allows the construction of 3-D elements by adding material to create
    a customized geometry [51]. AI refers to intelligent agents capable of maximizing
    the chance of achieving goals, with cognitive, learning, and problem-solving capabilities
    [52]. Blockchain technology refers to decentralized and distributed digital ledgers
    consisting of blocks where transactions and information are recorded using a peer-to-peer
    network to guarantee inalterability and security of data [14]. Computing technologies
    enclose both quantum and cloud-based computing, where the former refers to technologies
    allowing great computational power, whereas the latter regards a set of information
    technologies based on on-demand availability of resources, such as storage and
    computing, which are distributed over multiple locations [53]. The digital applications
    category contains software, social networks, and digital tools, accessible from
    smartphones and browsers, which run on web servers and support paperless activities
    [54]. Geospatial technologies comprise instruments and tools to collect, process,
    and analyze geographic data [55]. Immersive environments collect technologies
    that allow immersion into virtual reality and nonphysical worlds or the employment
    of virtual instruments to enhance human perception within the real-world environment
    [56]. IoT technologies refer to connected physical devices or “things” equipped
    with sensors that collect and share information within a network over the internet
    [57]. Open and crowd-based platforms encompass a set of tools, applications, and
    platforms to employ open and crowd-based approaches, allowing access to information,
    data, knowledge, sources, software, as well as activities performed by people
    and citizens [58], [59], [60]. Proximity technologies refer to sensors, devices,
    and objects able to detect the presence of nearby elements without any physical
    contact [61]. Robotics category encloses innovative robots able to autonomously
    perform actions either partially or totally [62]. It also includes unmanned aerial
    vehicles [63]. The list has been continuously reviewed during data collection;
    therefore, the 87 specific key technologies are those predominant in the literature,
    whereas the grouping of technologies within the 11 macrocategories has followed
    the logic of technical and technological commonality, as well as similarities
    in terms of data management and performed actions. Indeed, from the one hand,
    technologies could change physical flows, performing or supporting specific actions.
    From the other hand, other technologies predominantly affect information flows.
    Table III summarizes the features of each key technology to show the complexity
    of the suggested classification. Regarding data management, key technologies can
    support data capture, data storage/transfer, or data processing. As to performed
    actions, technologies support simulation activities or perform an action with
    three opportunities: complete automation, support to human action, or execution
    of activities operated by humans. TABLE III Features of Key Technologies in Terms
    of Data Management and Performed Action C. Business Context: Industry The methodology
    takes into account 54 industries in primary, manufacturing, and tertiary sectors
    (see Table IV). To guarantee the comprehensiveness of the classification, the
    labels have been checked with other standard classifications, such as the standard
    industrial classification (SIC) codes [64]. The variable also considers a general
    category for “horizontal” applications that can be employed in all sectors. Therefore,
    the framework is suitable to support the choice of implementation of key technologies
    in all industries, whereas many systematic literature reviews focus on specific
    industries. In particular, for the primary sector, four different industries are
    found, the manufacturing sector is characterized by 21 industries, while the tertiary
    sector reports 25 labels. Three additional labels, one for each sector, refer
    to a general usefulness within the specific sector. For instance, manufacturing
    (general) encloses emerging practices that are useful for all industries within
    the manufacturing sector. TABLE IV List of Industries by Sector Reported Within
    the Framework D. Business Context: Business Function and Business Process In the
    literature, there are several articles discussing key technologies without referring
    to a specific business function but within general areas, such as SCM [65], [66]
    or Industry 4.0 [3], [67]. Some of these articles focus on specific processes,
    such as the use of key technologies in product design [68] or R&D projects [69],
    [70], [71]. However, this work aims to investigate all the different business
    functions and not focus only on some specific areas. Therefore, companies could
    decide to use key technologies by precisely identifying the business function
    concerned. Indeed, key technologies may have effects on companies even within
    apparently secondary and less discussed business functions. Hence, it is essential
    to define the area of implementation of these technologies. Actually, the business
    function specifies where the emerging practices can be carried out. In particular,
    both primary and support functions are considered (see Fig. 3). For each business
    function, a list of business processes is reported (see Table V). Therefore, the
    variable business process can be considered as a specific subcategory of the business
    function, aiming at better delineating where the emerging practice can be implemented.
    A set of 43 business processes is suggested, also considering one label for the
    business function general, which is assigned to practices that are implemented
    within all parts of the organization. The variables are useful to improve the
    applicability of the framework to multiple types of analyses. For instance, to
    study the relationship between SCM and key technologies, it is useful to select
    specific processes within the four functions distribution, marketing, operations,
    and procurement. Moreover, the identification of the process that will employ
    the key technology is indispensable to delineate the area of application where
    it is possible to achieve the expected positive impact on the business performance.
    The same technology used in a different process could not provide the same positive
    impact. Fig. 3. Primary and secondary business functions considered within the
    framework. Show All TABLE V List of Business Processes by Business Function Reported
    Within the Framework E. Impact on Business Performance This variable delineates
    the impact of key technologies on the business. In particular, an emerging practice
    could affect either external or internal performance (see Table VI). The first
    refers to performance improvements of external relationships with clients, investors,
    and stakeholders in general so that it is possible to link the adoption of a key
    technology with positive impacts on the market. The latter concerns internal positive
    effects of the implementation of key technologies within the organization, with
    positive effects in terms of time, costs, productivity, and resource efficiency.
    As follows, an explanation of all labels is provided. TABLE VI List of Impacts
    Reported Within the Framework External performance encloses attracting investors
    since key technologies enhance financial attractiveness [72] and can improve financial
    performance [73], long-term shareholder value [74], or stock price performance
    [75]. Moreover, higher external performances can be achieved in terms of brand
    reputation [76], competitive advantage [77], customer satisfaction [78], and product/service
    quality/value/differentiation [79]. Finally, the label revenues enclose all emerging
    practices that support selling activities or sales growth [80]. Internal performance
    is associated with positive impacts within business processes and activities,
    covering cost reduction [81], efficiency and productivity (e.g., reliability,
    waste reduction, and productivity) [82], energy efficiency gains [83], flexibility
    in production and design [84], and time reduction [85]. Moreover, it comprises
    the optimization of management activities associated with critical issues of a
    business, such as employee engagement [86], information management (e.g., traceability,
    better-informed decisions, control, real-time visibility, transparency, and monitoring)
    [5], innovation, knowledge and technology management (e.g., technological development,
    product innovation, digitalization, and access to new knowledge) [87], risk reduction
    (e.g., security and privacy issues, reduction of accidents at work, and reduction
    of fraudulent behaviors) [88], and supply-chain relationships management (e.g.,
    integration, coordination, collaboration, information sharing, and transparency
    among partners) [89], [90]. F. Data Collection From Scientific Articles Brooks
    argued that one of the ways in which science contributes to technology is creating
    an important knowledge base in evaluating technology in terms of social, environmental,
    and strategic business impacts and identifying industrial practices [16]. Recently,
    the rapid growth of science and technology has increased the complexity of managing
    these two issues. Fortunately, the parallel growth of information in both science
    and technology offers the possibility of advanced decision support to guide the
    activities to be carried out. In general, scientific research tends to anticipate
    the technology; therefore, academic researchers, policymakers, industrialists,
    and consultants could employ literature to plan and program decisions on the adoption
    of key technologies [15]. In particular, case studies are used to evaluate the
    advantages and disadvantages of key technologies [91], [92]. One reason for the
    case study being recognized as a research method is that researchers were becoming
    increasingly concerned about the limitations of quantitative methods in providing
    the in-depth explanations of how much key technologies impact on business [93].
    As key technologies are not adopted by most companies, their real benefits and
    disadvantages are hidden [94]. Through case study methods, a researcher is able
    to go beyond quantitative statistical results and understand the dynamics that
    key technologies may change [95]. Case studies help to explain both the process
    and the outcome of a phenomenon through the observation, reconstruction, and analysis
    of the cases under investigation [96]. For this reason, scientific research often
    presents case studies in which key technologies are implemented and this can be
    useful for generalizing emerging practices [97]. Therefore, in order to ensure
    the widest coverage level and the continuous update, emerging practices are extracted
    from the analysis of scientific papers. Indeed, some scholars have already used
    scientific papers as a source to detect emerging trends in the adoption of new
    technologies and practices, as well as other contributions have built lists of
    emerging practices from the review of relevant literature [98], [99]. However,
    this work intends to perform a systematic literature review in order to standardize
    information from scientific papers and provide the state-of-the-art of the overall
    implementation of emerging practices, useful not only for scientific purposes
    but also for managerial and organizational ones. The methodology of systematic
    literature review is particularly suitable for this research since it allows summarizing
    the evidences from primary studies through a formal research protocol. Being papers
    the source of information, it is necessary to read the full text, analyze the
    content, and process each document to assign standardized variables to each emerging
    practice. In particular, a cloud-based web application has been implemented to
    allow researchers in the field of technology, operations, and management to perform
    the activity. The researcher reads and analyzes the full text of each scientific
    paper, searching for emerging practices that employ new technologies. Since the
    identification of emerging practices is complex within the full text and the required
    information could be scattered within the document, it is not possible to implement
    an automatic script and natural language processing techniques to perform the
    process, but human interpretation is necessary. To record a practice, it is necessary
    to assign labels for each variable (i.e., key technology, industry, business function,
    business process, and impact). These predefined variables and labels guarantee
    data standardization and comparability. However, to assign labels, it is necessary
    to have a significant experience on technical and technological issues. Moreover,
    when the user detects new potential labels to assign to the variables, he/she
    can suggest the addition of a new element. Indeed, flexibility is necessary because
    new practices and technologies could manifest original features to add to the
    initial set of labels. The only “free” input field is the textual description
    of the emerging practice, where the researcher clarifies usefulness, aim, implementation,
    and peculiarities of the focal practice. In this way, activities, supported operations,
    and data employed can be better clarified. Fig. 4 shows an example of acquisition
    of information from the work presented by Chen et al. [100], where an application
    of last mile delivery using drones is suggested. From the content analysis of
    the full text and the further classification, the emerging practice is summarized
    by the combination key technology-industry-business function-business process-impact-description.
    After an additional perspective, by considering only categorical variables, each
    emerging practice is expressed by the tuple key technology-industry-business function-business
    process-impact. Fig. 4. Example of classification of an emerging practice. Show
    All The starting list of scientific papers consists of contributions published
    from January 2019 to July 2022 in the most relevant journals in the field of business,
    finance, economics, management, operations research, management science, and accounting,
    according to ISI Web of Science and Scimago Journal Ranking, focusing on journals
    reported in either Q1 or Q2 in at least one of the sources. Then, the list of
    scientific papers was searched on SCOPUS by creating a specific search query for
    each technology. In particular, for each key technology, specific contents, which
    refer to either the category or the specific technologies, are searched within
    title and keywords fields. For instance, the following query was used to search
    for papers investigating immersive environments: (TITLE (“immersive environments”)
    or KEY (“immersive environments”) or TITLE (“augmented reality”) or KEY (“augmented
    reality”) or TITLE (“digital human”) or KEY (“digital human”) or TITLE (“holograms”)
    or KEY (“holograms”) or TITLE (“metaverse”) or KEY (“metaverse”) or TITLE (“virtual
    reality”) or KEY (“virtual reality”) or TITLE (“mixed reality”) or KEY (“mixed
    reality”) or TITLE (“digital twin”) or KEY (“digital twin”) or TITLE (“gamification”)
    or KEY (“gamification”)). The researchers search for a paper, and then manually
    read and study the entire document, with three available options: paper not found,
    paper not useful, or paper useful. The first regards documents whose electronic
    version is not downloadable from the Internet, whereas the second regards papers
    where no business practices were found. Indeed, an important ratio of not useful
    documents is found since many papers focus on the “policymaker” or “macroeconomic”
    perspective, as well as on “technological” and “technical” issues of key technologies.
    The paper is considered useful only if it presents the implementation of an emerging
    practice. To add an emerging practice, the information extracted from the paper
    has to provide a clear association with all variables under investigation. When
    not sufficient detail is provided, the practice is disregarded. Furthermore, practices
    are recorded only if there is an exhaustive description of their functioning,
    which data employ, why they are used, which is the aim of implementing them, how
    they allow the firm achieving goals and enhance business performance, who employs
    the technology, and why they are different from traditional practices. Scientific
    papers were assigned to only one researcher at a time, but at the end of the analysis,
    a second researcher (i.e., reviewer) revised the analysis of the colleague. Eventual
    doubts regarding the labels assigned are solved with a joint activity of the researcher
    and the reviewer. At the end of July 2022, the number of searched papers is 22 337
    on a total of about 50 000 documents deriving from the sum of the results of 11
    queries on SCOPUS. Therefore, the investigated sample is statistically significant
    to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art of key technologies. In particular,
    1165 documents were not available on the Internet, whereas 21 172 were downloaded
    and examined for a ratio of about 95% of searched papers. Among the analyzed papers,
    5442 report at least an emerging practice, i.e., one-fourth of available documents
    (see Fig. 5). More than 100 man months were necessary to perform the research,
    engaging 10 researchers expert in the field of engineering and technology management
    from January 2020 to July 2022. The final sample consists of 15 708 different
    combinations key technology-industry-business function-business process-impact-description.
    Since the same labels for categorical variables can be the same for multiple emerging
    practices, by considering only the distinct number of tuples, key technology-industry-business
    function-business process-impact the dataset reports 11 049 elements. It is interesting
    to consider that the potential number of available combinations is about 3.4 million,
    i.e., 87 technologies × 54 industries × 43 processes × 17 impacts. This means
    that, to date, the share of possible combinations that have been already found
    a real implementation is 0.32%, underscoring that a minimal part of the available
    combinations has been already explored in the literature and practice. This also
    underlines the high unexpressed potential value of key technologies. Fig. 5. Output

    SECTION IV. Findings To let emerge the explicative power of the methodology, this
    section presents an exploratory study on the repository of 15 708 emerging practices.
    First, descriptive statistics of each categorical variable are presented to provide
    a general overview of the state-of-the-art. Second, an explorative analysis is
    carried out in order to detect the most frequent and robust combinations of labels
    that define which are the emerging practices that are the best candidates to become
    future best practices. The analysis is performed by implementing a machine learning
    algorithm belonging to the category of association rule mining. A. Descriptive
    Statistics In this section, a first analysis of the distribution of practices
    for each categorical variable is presented. Table VII presents the number of practices
    employing key technologies. It reports both the macrotechnology and, for short,
    only the belonging specific technologies that cover at least 1% of the entire
    dataset. AI is the most frequent and covers about one-third of the emerging practices;
    also blockchain, robotics, and digital applications are associated to many opportunities
    of implementation. TABLE VII Emerging Practices by Macrocategory of Key Technologies
    and Specific Key Technology Table VIII presents the top industries that cover
    more than 1% of the entire dataset. About 15% of practices are associated with
    the general adoption within the entire manufacturing sector, which is the natural
    habitat for key technologies deriving from Industry 4.0 paradigm. It is interesting
    to underscore the significant value associated with the healthcare industry, which
    confirms the relevance of “health technologies,” as well as the wide range of
    opportunities for implementation of key technologies in the field of transportation.
    TABLE VIII Top Industries Reporting Emerging Practices To summarize the relationship
    between emerging practices and industry of application, Table IX groups practices
    by sectors, underscoring that manufacturing and tertiary are featured by a larger
    number of emerging practices compared with the primary sector. TABLE IX Emerging
    Practices by Sector Moreover, Table X presents the count of practices by business
    function. In addition, only the belonging business processes covering at least
    1% of the total number of practices are reported. It is interesting to underscore
    that the practices permeate all business functions. Even though many of them are
    associated with primary functions, such as operations and distribution, results
    show that the adoption of key technologies could provide opportunities for business
    performance improvement also within ancillary functions. Since most of the research
    on key technologies is focused on SCM, results suggest expanding and investigating
    the implementation toward secondary areas, such as accounting and finance, human
    resources management, and governance and administration. As to the most frequent
    processes, operations planning, and control, production of goods and provision
    of services are prevailing, confirming the significant weight of the operations
    function, which covers about 50% of the total number of emerging practices. TABLE
    X Emerging Practices by Business Function and Process Regarding the impact on
    business performance, about 20% of practices allow efficiency and productivity
    enhancements, but also costs reduction and improvements in terms of information
    management cover a significant share. Yet, key technologies are also able to enhance
    customer satisfaction and product/service quality/value/differentiation. Grouping
    emerging practices by impact areas results show that improvements in terms of
    internal performance feature over 75% of emerging practices (see Table XI). TABLE
    XI Emerging Practices by Impact on the Business Performance B. Explorative Analysis
    of Emerging Practices In order to exhibit the opportunity deriving from the implementation
    of the methodology, an explorative analysis of the emerging practices is presented.
    Since the dataset consists of categorical variables, text mining techniques employing
    machine learning algorithms have been preferred. The use of machine learning for
    data analytics is growing in the literature and practice since it allows finding
    patterns among variables. In particular, emerging practices are featured by tuples
    industry-business function-business process-key technology-impact. This means
    that emerging practices are summarized as the use of a technology within a specific
    business context in order to achieve a specific impact on the business performance.
    Hence, the aim of this section is to show the most interesting combinations of
    variables that can be considered valuable, robust, and with the higher likelihood
    of achieving the expected impact, i.e., the “top emerging practices.” In other
    words, with this section, the following question is answered: Which are the most
    frequent and relevant emerging practices that could become future best practices?
    To find the most interesting combinations, association rule mining techniques
    have been employed. This research uses the frequent-pattern growth algorithm (FP-Growth),
    a tree-based mining method proposed by Han et al. [101], which can extract frequent
    groups of items and association rules from large datasets. An itemset is a group
    of one or more items that are found together in the dataset. If a subset of elements
    X is extracted from an itemset, it is possible to predict the probability of finding
    the remaining elements Y. This relationship is an association rule, which is logically
    expressed as the following implication: {X}→{Y}. View Source The set X is the
    antecedent and Y is the consequent. The combination {X, Y} is transformed into
    an association rule where the occurrence of {X} is associated to the presence
    of {Y}. Association rules can select the most interesting itemsets by exploiting
    two variables, i.e., support and confidence [102]. Indeed, once determined the
    list of itemsets, the support count (#s) can be estimated as the frequency of
    occurrence of each itemset in the dataset. Moreover, the parameter confidence
    (c) can be calculated as the ratio of the sum of the dataset containing the set
    of X U Y itemsets on the count of records reporting the set of X item [103]. In
    line with this framework (see Fig. 1), the antecedent consists of the technology
    within the business context, whereas the consequent is the impact on business
    performance {technology, business context}→{impact}. View Source Hence, the occurrence
    of a technology within a business context is associated with the presence of a
    specific impact. The number of occurrences in which the combination {technology,
    business context, impact} appears in the database is #s, whereas the likelihood
    of finding {impact} as the consequent when the antecedents are {technology, business
    context} is c. In particular, the variable key technology can be expressed by
    either considering the 11 macrocategories or the 87 specific elements, whereas
    the business context can be defined with industry, business function, and business
    process. Moreover, the impact can be expressed by either the 17 labels presented
    in Section III-D or the two macrocategories, i.e., external and internal performance.
    In consideration of the features of association rule mining, for this exploratory
    research, the technology is represented through the 11 macrocategories, whereas
    the business context is summarized by the variables industry and business process.
    As to the impact, to simplify the representation of the results, the tradeoff
    between the external and internal performance is preferred. {macrotechnology,
    industry, business process} →{macroimpact}. View Source In terms of the potential
    number of possible combinations, with this group of categorical variables, the
    maximum output is of 51 084 elements, i.e., 11 macrotechnologies × 54 industries
    × 43 processes × 2 impacts. By implementing the FP-growth algorithm, it is possible
    to find out the most useful rules that suggest the implementation of a particular
    technology within a business context in order to enhance business performance.
    To extract the most interesting rules, only those satisfying minimum thresholds
    for support and confidence are considered. In particular, the threshold support
    value (#s) was set as 10, whereas the threshold confidence value (c) is 0.50.
    This allows to select the most frequent rules (#s) that are relevant for each
    antecedent (c). The FP-growth algorithm starts defining the frequent itemsets
    and creates the FP-tree, and then it scans each node of the three in order to
    find interesting rules according to the two thresholds. To launch the algorithm,
    a PHP web application has been implemented. Results show 879 associations, but
    only 262 are considered for the analysis. The other are nonsignificant since they
    either report other variables as the consequent or not all the three expected
    elements are reported as antecedents. By considering the potential number of possible
    combinations, the captured associations cover 0.51%. Since this research focuses
    on emerging practices, which are risky and costly to implement, this limited group
    of emerging practices is the perfect candidate for future best practices. This
    is possible, thanks to the joint effect of the support threshold and confidence
    threshold. The support threshold allows considering the most frequent combinations,
    i.e., the best combinations are those that have been mostly tested and applied
    in the literature. The confidence threshold supports the selection of only those
    combinations {macrotechnology, industry, business process} that have a likelihood
    higher than 50% of achieving a specific impact on the business performance, hence
    neglecting the combinations exhibiting the less likely impacts. From the analysis
    of the extracted rules, a general consideration is that only about 10% of associations
    suggest an impact on external performance, hence delineating a prevalent stability
    of enhancement of internal performance when key technologies are implemented in
    organizations. Moreover, at least a combination for each macrotechnology has been
    found, even though those reporting AI, blockchain, and IoT are prevailing. As
    to industries, 29 out of 54 elements report at least an emerging practice, with
    labels general and manufacturing (general) covering about one-third of the association
    rules. A total of 32 out of 43 processes have been reported within association
    rules, with a prevalence of those within business function operations. As follows,
    for each macrotechnology, the list of combinations is reported and commented on.
    The 3-D printing will allow new production methodologies and opportunities to
    improve internal performance in manufacturing industries in general as well as
    specific applications in R&D intensive sectors featured by market and product
    complexity are growing (see Table XII). In particular, some 3-D printing processes
    allow the production of pieces with superior mechanical features in a reduced
    time, useful for aerospace and automotive applications. Moreover, in the biomedical
    industry, 3-D printing is the optimal solution to manufacture components with
    biocompatible materials and antibacterial properties that are designed with advanced
    3-D modeling software in order to be totally customized with the specifics of
    each patient. It is also useful in industries, such as healthcare, where it is
    necessary to fabricate parts and instruments quickly and locally to satisfy the
    variable and difficult-to-forecast product demand with a limited lead time. Additional
    interesting applications regard the opportunity of manufacturing houses and buildings
    through additive manufacturing. Moreover, 3-D printing is useful for design and
    rapid prototyping since it ensures flexibility and the development of complex
    geometries, minimizing material consumption and waste generation. TABLE XII 3-D
    Printing—Top Emerging Practices AI reports 84 distinct association rules, covering
    one-third of the entire list (see Table XIII). It is doubtless a priority technology
    for emerging practices, covering 27 industries and 21 business processes. It is
    implementable within all business functions, from primary to ancillary. For instance,
    within the governance and administration function, AI can be employed to generate
    scenarios, estimate the performance of assets, and support decision making and
    planning. AI is the most promising technology to implement smart manufacturing
    systems and optimize SCM, but it is also useful for the tertiary sector. It is
    capable of analyzing information and data and exploiting them to revolutionize
    how services are provided. Even though it will support companies in enhancing
    their internal performance, in some industries, emerging practices employing it
    to achieve external performance are growing. In particular, AI is used for market
    analysis. Blockchain technology is very promising, especially for the manufacturing
    sector (see Table XIV). It positively affects internal impact, mainly in three
    areas. First, it is possible to find blockchain applications for the management
    of supply-chain operations. It reduces transaction-based costs, solves trust issues,
    improves real-time traceability, and protects product counterfeiting. Second,
    blockchain affects financial transactions with both the adoption of cryptocurrencies
    and the implementation of smart contracts to achieve automatic payment. Third,
    it adds security to data, changing management policies. For instance, blockchain
    defends companies against insider attacks and alteration of records, providing
    accessibility, authenticity verification, authorization, and security to information
    and preserving the privacy of employees, partners, clients, and devices. Its architecture
    is scalable and highly efficient and provides new instruments for management,
    processing, and control of large data traffic from people and devices. TABLE XIII
    AI—Top Emerging Practices TABLE XIV Blockchain—Top Emerging Practices Computing
    technologies change the way in which data are stored, shared, and processed (see
    Table XV). From the one hand, the entire manufacturing sector can rely on these
    technologies to improve operations. Computing technologies, such as cloud and
    edge computing, allow efficient and real-time data transmission and processing,
    which are necessary features to monitor processes in real time, detect issues,
    maintain high productivity, and optimize production scheduling. Moreover, computing
    technologies provide computational power to many tools and applications used for
    operations. From the other hand, computing will enable the implementation of new
    ways of providing services by guaranteeing real-time monitoring and tracking of
    activities, which are particularly useful for sectors, such as healthcare and
    transportation. For instance, shipping systems can rely on computing technologies
    to share information about the shipment with the customer as well as to calculate
    the delivery time. The computational power of computing technologies allows the
    effective management of resources, providing support to the calculation of routes
    and the scheduling of the transport system. TABLE XV Computing—Top Emerging Practices
    Digital applications are the category exhibiting the higher number of emerging
    practices affecting external performance (see Table XVI). In particular, chatbots,
    web applications, apps, and social networks will provide support to clients and
    guarantee real-time services with higher service levels. Chatbots handle customer
    queries in a timely and correct manner, improving the customer experience and
    helping clients connect to the brand as well as they optimize customer decision-making
    performance. Moreover, they also collect information about clients, useful to
    customize the product offer and understand market needs. Social media solutions
    are fundamental to implement a two-way symmetrical and interactive communication
    with customers, increasing customer experience, reducing negative feedback, and
    providing opportunities to foster stronger relationships. Digital applications
    are also useful for enhancing internal performance since they will support internal
    operations by providing instruments and tools for employees. In addition, robotic
    process automation helps organizations to save costs of operations by no longer
    having to rely on customers or to outsource tasks. They can also be considered
    as an instrument to optimize supply chains since they provide a common language
    to supply-chain members, e.g., by implementing application programming interfaces
    (APIs) and webservices to share information and manage supply-chain relationships.
    TABLE XVI Digital Applications—Top Emerging Practices Geospatial technologies
    could enhance internal performance by providing information to support decision
    making in planning and management of some services (see Table XVII). They find
    interesting applications in public utilities, such as electric power, energy,
    and water. Geospatial technologies are used to find the optimal location of storage
    centers—mapping and checking the features of the surrounding areas, to plan local,
    regional, and national resource capacity and distribution, and collect data for
    the effective resource management and supply. Additionally, they probably represent
    the most promising key technology to enhance business performance in the primary
    sector. For instance, geospatial technologies allow field mapping, crop phase
    monitoring, disease management, yield estimation, soil mapping, weed mapping,
    and hotspot for disease incidence. Applications of geospatial technologies cover
    not only strategic planning and operations management but also distribution logistics.
    They provide information to transportation planning applications to optimize routes,
    monitor hijacking, improve fuel and time efficiencies, and monitor driver behavior.
    TABLE XVII Geospatial Technologies—Top Emerging Practices The main opportunities
    of exploiting immersive environments are twofold (see Table XVIII). First, they
    are useful to improve internal performance in the manufacturing sector, with a
    focus on operations, R&D, and distribution. For instance, warehouse management
    can be beneficial of augmented reality through the use of smart glasses to help
    operators with order picking. Digital twin will revolutionize various operations’
    processes, such as maintenance and diagnostics, since it possesses data from the
    physical entity and employs it to build a digital model useful for anomaly detection,
    fault diagnosis, predictive maintenance, performance analysis, and production
    quality prediction. Second, immersive environments are promising technologies
    for marketing, e.g., to show virtual catalogues or presentation of products. During
    COVID-19 emergency, they are also replacing traditional communication channels
    and supporting revenues. Indeed, the external performance can be improved by employing
    them to build a new sale channel to sell products or provide services, e.g., through
    virtual rooms to try products or virtual tours in locations and museums. Moreover,
    immersive environments, such as augmented and virtual reality, support customer
    satisfaction. TABLE XVIII Immersive Environments—Top Emerging Practices IoT is
    fundamental for collecting information necessary to monitor and control processes
    as well as for transferring and sharing information (see Table XIX). In SCM, it
    is used to improve the relationship with both upstream and downstream partners.
    For instance, for a better management of procurement activities, IoT digitalizes
    activities and helps real-time monitoring of partners. IoT allows the monitoring
    of pallets in real time from the factory to the distribution center, from warehouse
    to warehouse, and during transit and storage. For the manufacturing sector, it
    has also consolidated applications in operations management, enhancing internal
    performance. Indeed, it allows machines to communicate with each other and to
    implement smart production with networking and remote technologies, such as fault
    diagnosis, monitoring of operations, and transmission of information and instructions
    to other machines, supply-chain members, and employees. However, stable emerging
    practices have been found for specific sectors. In the agriculture one, IoT solutions
    collect data on plantations to support crop monitoring, disease prevention, and
    irrigation control. In the electric power industry, sensors are installed to monitor
    the health status of the network and collect information useful to predict future
    failures and outages that may occur in the distribution lines. TABLE XIX IoT—Top
    Emerging Practices Open and crowd-based platforms have three main categories of
    frequent applications (see Table XX). First, the use of open data, open access,
    and open source allows access to important information and applications to support
    processes, such as the optimization of the services provided in the healthcare
    industry. Second, open innovation and crowdsourcing platforms support innovation,
    knowledge, and technology management in the manufacturing sector. Firms can create
    open spaces to present R&D challenges to a crowd of solvers, develop and find
    creative solutions to established problems, as well as engage a crowd in the early
    stages of innovation and product development processes. Third, the implementation
    of crowdsourcing and crowdshipping platforms, in particular referring to delivery
    and logistics’ services, provides advantages in terms of internal performance.
    Indeed, crowdsourcing delivery can be useful to dramatically shorten delivery
    times and minimize last mile delivery costs. Specific platforms can be implemented
    to create match between parcel delivery tasks and ad-hoc drivers, mainly by implementing
    algorithms for automatic association and definition of optimized delivery routes.
    TABLE XX Open and Crowd-Based Platforms—Top Emerging Practices Proximity technologies
    allow real-time monitoring of inventories and operations (see Table XXI). In the
    transportation and logistics industry, it is possible to track and trace the movement
    of products in a supply chain and control the entire transportation process in
    order to reduce the loading, unloading, and transportation time, find counterfeits
    and identifying inconsistencies. In the manufacturing sector, it is used to optimize
    warehousing activities and managing inventories. Moreover, by using biometrics,
    it is possible to track employees, authenticate and verify the identity, understand
    behaviors, and check their performance. In the retail industry, improvements in
    terms of external performance can be achieved by implementing proximity technologies,
    such as eye tracking and radio-frequency identification (RFID), to study clients
    and customer decision making and provide personalized assistance during the purchase
    and information about the availability of products. In the food and beverage industry,
    information acquired by proximity technologies is used to improve the safety and
    the quality of the food since captured data can be shared and published in a traceability
    system. Clients can scan a QR code and access to information about product, process,
    provenance, and company information. TABLE XXI Proximity Technologies—Top Emerging
    Practices Robotics can be implemented in many business processes and industries
    (see Table XXII). The potential implementation of drones, autonomous vehicles,
    and other technologies included into robotics will improve the performance of
    warehouse, transportation, and delivery activities. As to last mile delivery,
    new organizational models can be implemented, with many opportunities of optimizing
    time, cost, and quality of the service. Regarding the manufacturing sector, the
    opportunity of implementing robotics to replace/support the human being or implement
    automation is the main opportunity of internal performance enhancement. However,
    robotics’ technologies also find stable applications for the management of operations
    in industries belonging to the tertiary sector, such as healthcare, hotels and
    accommodation, restaurant and café, and retail. In particular, service robots
    have proved their usefulness in robotic-assisted surgery and support to patients,
    as well as to perform front-of-house operations (information provision, service
    delivery, check-in, and check-out) and back-of-house operations (cleaning, disinfection,
    and vacuuming the floor). TABLE XXII Robotics—Top Emerging Practices SECTION V.
    Discussion A. Theoretical Contribution The research confirms the power of key
    technologies in increasing business performance and their significant role in
    unlocking new practical applications and emerging practices. Despite the risks
    in implementing emerging practices, firms and early adopters can limit such risks
    by selecting those that fit with the belonging industry, the business function/process,
    and the specific needs of performance improvement. From the combination of the
    variables, it emerges that less than 1% of possible tuples has been detected from
    the systematic literature review. After the theoretical point of view, this suggests
    that research could explore a multitude of additional possible combinations in
    order to test the usefulness of key technologies in other business contexts. Considering
    all industries, business functions, and business processes, the research demonstrates
    that key technologies are available for many contexts, sometimes neglected by
    both scientific research and companies. Therefore, improvements in performance
    can be reached not only within primary business functions but also within secondary
    ones. For instance, human resource management, strategic planning, and financial
    processes can be supported by key technologies. Moreover, there is space for implementing
    technologies in all industries and not only in the manufacturing ones, underscoring
    the pervasive role of the Industry 4.0 paradigm. In particular, the tertiary industry
    reports a significant number of available emerging practices as well as interesting
    opportunities have been uncovered also for the primary. However, research confirms
    that the main advancements are present in industries, such as manufacturing, healthcare,
    and transportation and logistics. Furthermore, from the analysis of results, the
    type of impact that predominantly can be achieved by implementing emerging practices
    is internal performance enhancement. This means that, at the current stage of
    technical evolution, key technologies are predominantly implemented to improve
    the performance of internal processes. This means that technologies are primarily
    seen as an opportunity to change internal activities and enhance internal performance,
    while the implications for external performance are secondary. Probably, when
    a key technology switches to a further stage of evolution, and people and society
    exhibit interest in it, this acknowledgement drives companies in trying to exploit
    it also to achieve market advantages. An additional theoretical contribution regards
    the suggested taxonomy of 11 key technologies. Indeed, the classification derives
    from the analysis of thousands of scientific articles; therefore, it is robust
    and exhibits specific peculiarities of each key technology. Such a taxonomy could
    be the starting point for other research articles aiming at investigating key
    technologies. To our knowledge, no previous contribution analyzing thousands of
    scientific papers is found in the literature. Such a classification is not in
    contrast with other taxonomies suggested by the literature [4], [8] but can be
    considered more exhaustive, also in terms of number of categories of key technologies.
    Moreover, the research confirms the usefulness of scientific papers in order to
    portray the state-of-the-art of technology development and suggests the implementation
    of key technologies and emerging practices, underscoring the peculiarities of
    each technology [15], [92], [104]. The methodology demonstrates that scientific
    literature can be used as a source of useful information to build a repository
    of emerging practices. By employing the suggested framework, it is possible to
    study the evolution of a key technology and understand whether it can be used
    only within specific industries and business functions/processes or it has general
    usefulness. B. Methodological Contribution The framework for investigating key
    technologies and emerging practices is the main contribution of this research.
    It is an original framework supporting researchers and companies in building a
    repository of emerging practices. The methodology proposed to perform a systematic
    literature review allows users to extract information from scientific research
    to study the evolution of the implementation of key technologies in all business
    contexts. Each practice is associated with a series of standardized variables—key
    technology, industry, business function, business process, and impact—in order
    to allow a firm to filter and detect the list of the best promising practices
    that fit with the objectives of business performance enhancement. Compared with
    other repositories, it is a larger dataset, which can be continuously updated,
    being scientific literature the source of information. For instance, the actual
    version of the SCOR model, which is one of the most acknowledged frameworks that
    collects business practices, is four years old, which is a time interval not compatible
    with the concept of emerging practice. Moreover, the number of emerging practices
    is significantly higher, not comparable with other research projects [4], [8].
    It is also useful to underscore that each practice is associated with a scientific
    paper; therefore, it is possible to further study in depth the document to capture
    additional information useful for the implementation of the emerging practice.
    The use of scientific literature as a source to capture emerging practices implies
    a significant research activity to update the repository but guarantees the opportunity
    to record pioneering and radical opportunities of adoption of key technologies
    [105]. C. Practical and Managerial Implications The suggested framework could
    be the basis for the implementation of a practical tool that firms could employ
    to make decisions about the adoption of emerging practices and carry out “early
    adopter” strategies in line with the perspective of Industry 4.0. Indeed, firms,
    researchers, and business analysts could replicate the methodology to build a
    repository of emerging business practices that can be directly accessed by stakeholders.
    It could be possible to perform specific queries to filter practices by industry,
    business function, business process or impact on the business performance, and
    obtain a list of emerging practices that fit with the desired outcome. As follows,
    an example of how it is possible to transform the methodology into a practical
    instrument is provided. It is possible for a firm to access a list of emerging
    practices by considering five steps of filtering in order to select the specific
    practical application that totally fits with the business. At the first step,
    it is necessary to define the belonging industry of the focal firm so that only
    emerging practices in line with the field of application will be considered. A
    second step requires the identification of the desired outcome (impact) that the
    focal company intends to achieve. Indeed, the specific performance need “pushes”
    toward the selection of technologies that are potentially capable of supporting
    the achievement of the result. Moreover, the decision maker defines the business
    function as well as the business process, where it intends to carry out the new
    practices. Then, the potential technologies that should be implemented are reported
    so that it is possible to select the preferred key technology. Finally, a list
    of emerging practices that employ the focal technology, fitting with the belonging
    industry, the desired outcome, and the selected business function/process can
    be obtained. Each practice represents an opportunity of employing the key technology,
    i.e., the availability of an application of key technology that, once implemented,
    is likely to improve the business performance. Since the repository will report
    only proven practical applications of key technologies, the procedure could lead
    the user toward the selection of uncommon practices that have the potential of
    departing from common processes, providing competitive advantage or significant
    cost savings, with more restricted and reduced risks of adoption. The suggested
    procedure is particularly flexible, and it is possible to customize the steps
    of filtering according to the desired logic of implementation. For instance, “technology
    push” approaches should suggest placing the selection of key technologies before
    the labels impact and business function/process so that once selected the desired
    technology to implement, the firm should understand which is its potential impact.
    Table XXIII provides an example of implementation within the food and beverage
    industry: a firm aiming at reducing distribution costs will detect the opportunity
    of using IoT. In particular, a practice employing sensors to monitor the integrity
    of products is suggested. TABLE XXIII Example of Implementation Within the Food
    and Beverage Industry Since the repository reports only proven practical applications
    of key technologies, the framework leads the user toward the selection of uncommon
    practices that have the potential of departing from common processes, providing
    competitive advantage or significant cost savings. This will reduce risks and
    uncertainties associated with the adoption of key technologies within the organization
    since each practice is associated with a scientific paper where information about
    the context of implementation of the practice is appropriately described. Therefore,
    by finding similarities between the case study and the real context of the firm,
    the riskiness of the investment can be confined within a more acceptable limit.
    SECTION VI. Conclusion The aim of the research is to present a framework for performing
    a systematic literature review aiming at supporting the adoption of key technologies
    and suggesting emerging practices that fit with the firm''s context of application,
    also considering belonging industry, business function and business process, where
    to implement the technology, and the desired business impact. Having recorded
    thousands of emerging practices, it was possible to perform an analysis on the
    11 categories of key technologies. Results show interesting insights regarding
    the use of key technologies and the relationship with business performance. Since
    emerging practices are gathered from scientific papers, results can be considered
    as a valid basis to suggest future implementation of key technologies and the
    adoption of those emerging practices that are the most interesting and candidate
    to become future best practices. In this article, it was necessary to underscore
    some limitations that were a consequence of the dataset employed for the research.
    Emerging practices were detected from the analysis of a sample of scientific papers
    published from January 2019 to July 2022, while many other documents were available
    in the literature, also considering other sources not included in this research.
    The research was limited to papers where specific words were reported in title
    or abstract. It cannot be excluded that other scientific contributions could be
    useful for the enrichment of the repository. Moreover, despite the use of standardized
    labels, the researchers provided a personal interpretation of the content of a
    paper; therefore, it cannot be excluded that there may be errors in the registration
    of practices, albeit to a limited extent. Additionally, scientific papers cannot
    exhaustively consider all possible applications of key technologies, which could
    not be recorded within the repository. For instance, some emerging practices could
    have been adopted by companies and industries but have not been captured by scientific
    research. Furthermore, the suggested impacts in terms of external and internal
    performance also depend on the features of the firm that implements the technology,
    i.e., structural, organizational, and management issues. Moreover, even though
    the repository collects worldwide applications of key technologies, the framework
    does not consider country-level variables. The digital maturity and the infrastructures
    of a country could affect the likelihood of achieving the expected outcomes. Therefore,
    the framework aims only at suggesting potential opportunities for business improvements,
    but the real impact could be reached also depending on other internal and external
    factors. Future research will be addressed in implementing other statistical instruments
    and machine learning techniques to analyze the repository, such as clustering
    tools and decision trees. Furthermore, since some practices employ more than one
    key technology at a time, it is interesting to study the co-occurrence of key
    technologies in order to capture information about the impact of conjunct implementations
    and the deriving synergies. NOTE Open Access provided by ‘Università degli Studi

  limitations: 'While this paper provides a valuable framework for analyzing and visualizing
    emerging practices, it has some limitations that should be noted:


    - **Data limitations**: The methodology relies on extracting data from scientific
    articles published between 2019 and 2022, which may not capture all relevant emerging
    practices.

    - **Subjectivity in data extraction**: The process of extracting data from scientific
    articles involves a degree of subjectivity, which may introduce some inconsistencies
    in the resulting dataset.

    - **Focus on specific business contexts**: The framework primarily focuses on
    emerging practices in the context of traditional businesses and industries. It
    may not be as applicable to emerging practices in other contexts, such as non-profit
    organizations or government agencies.

    - **Limited consideration of country-level variables**: The framework does not
    explicitly consider country-level variables, such as digital maturity and infrastructure,
    which may influence the likelihood of successful implementation of emerging practices.

    - **Generalizability to real-world settings**: While the framework is based on
    a large dataset of scientific articles, it is important to note that the generalizability
    of the findings to real-world business settings may vary depending on factors
    such as the specific industry, organizational culture, and available resources.'

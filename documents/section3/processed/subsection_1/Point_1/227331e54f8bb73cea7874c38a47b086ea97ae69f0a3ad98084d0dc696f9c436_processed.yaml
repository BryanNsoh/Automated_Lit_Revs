    in technology have led to a tremendous growth in the capabilities of Internet-enabled
    devices. This Internet connectivity makes communication and device operability
    possible with minimal effort. One such technology, Internet of Things (IoT) [1],
    has made human life much more comfortable and effortless. It extends its application
    domain to a wide horizon of applications such as: smart cities, ACs, and fans
    in homes and offices are controlled by the IoT devices [2], smart health: the
    devices with which patients send stats to their doctor without a technician actually
    measuring and sending it [3], smart agriculture: Smart systems manage irrigation
    [4], and machinery automatically harvests after end of growth cycle, etc. Based
    on their applications, IoT applications differ on most levels. However, one factor
    that is common in them is the device that gathers application-specific data and
    is used to initiate a decision. Its basic functionalities include: presence of
    a controller with communication technology, sensors interfaced for getting real-world
    data, processing and decision-making capabilities, and power source and algorithm
    embedded for controlling as seen in Fig. 1. These devices work 24 × 7 on limited
    power. For efficacy, they are run on minimum energy consumption to ensure that
    the device runs on available power for maximum time. Fig. 1 IoT system Full size
    image In an IoT system, the sensors gather huge amount of data from the physical
    world which plays a major role in actuation. This collected data need to be stored
    for processing and for future requirements to allow precise decision-making based
    on past and present conditions. However, the amount of data generated by multiple
    sensors is huge and saving it is not memory effective. Instead, storing the data
    in its compressed form is required. There are various existing compression algorithms,
    but the main factor to be taken into consideration is that it has to be employed
    on a battery-operated device that already performs other functionalities. Compression
    in general is computationally costly, and an algorithm that uses minimal operations
    is beneficial. It also needs to be ensured that the algorithm does not come at
    the cost of same energy consumption as with normally transmitting the data. Instead,
    its inclusion must improve energy efficiency. It becomes evident that energy efficient
    and computationally effective algorithms are necessary for compression to be operated
    on an IoT device. On similar lines, this paper discusses the application of such
    energy-efficient compression algorithm on our IoT-based smart irrigation system.
    Data compression has already been applied on various applications, some of which
    have been listed here. Lee and Kim [5] demonstrated a low-memory compression system
    to multimedia application. Smart meter is another place where compression has
    been employed, and Lee et al. [6] proposed a compressive sensing-based compression
    and authentication for a smart meter. It also finds suitability in wearable devices
    and Del Testa and Rossi [7] proposed a similar device that collects bio-signals
    and uses auto-encoders to compress the signals. Another medical-wearable device-related
    work in [8] shows a real-time QRS detector and compression architecture for ECG
    signals. Apart from these applications, smart farming applications also require
    such algorithms due to the limited memory of IoT devices. Even so, implementation
    of data compression algorithms for smart farming applications still has solid
    research potential. Bhargava et al. [9] proposed a fog computing technique to
    address the memory issue in dairy farming. Vecchio et al. [10] proposed a lossless
    compression technique where environmental parameters were used. However, data
    compression algorithms on irrigation deployments have not yet blossomed. It is
    an opportunity which must be explored in the near future. Our work aims to employ
    data compression algorithm on a battery-powered IoT device. Such an algorithm
    would prove beneficial as it will not only provide fast compression but also conserve
    energy which is one of our main concerns. In our work, we impose the algorithm
    presented in [11] on the generated sensor data for an automatic irrigation system
    deployment in the smart farming application domain. It is energy efficient, COordinate
    Rotation DIgital Computer-based (CORDIC) discrete cosine transform (DCT) that
    targets battery-operated portable devices. The work shows significant reduction
    in energy consumption, and it also maintains the SPAA trade-off, and its application
    can be seen in Sect. 2.1. The remaining paper is arranged as: Sect. 2 discusses
    the application of energy-efficient CORDIC algorithm to smart irrigation system,
    and Sect. 3 provides the experimental analysis and algorithm efficacy on the application.
    Section 4 concludes the paper, and references have been mentioned at the end.
    2 CORDIC-Based Compression in Smart Irrigation System This section discusses the
    CORDIC-based DCT algorithm and its application for data compression in a smart
    irrigation system. It starts with the algorithm followed by its application to
    IoT device in smart irrigation scenario. 2.1 Energy-Efficient CORDIC for Data
    Compression In this section, the energy-efficient data compression algorithm that
    is used in the work has been presented. Nawandar and Satpute [11] present a quality-tunable
    energy-efficient CORDIC-based algorithm that computes trigonometric values in
    real time. Such a design can prove useful to create a compression algorithm which
    is to be performed on battery-operated devices. To verify the functionality, the
    paper processes the algorithm on the sensor data, specifically temperature, humidity,
    and soil moisture. CORDIC provides cosine values of given input, and our aim is
    data compression where DCT has been used which requires computing some coefficients.
    These coefficients are the cosine values of some fixed inputs ranging from π/16
    to 7π/16, whose values are computed using the algorithm. These values are then
    used to form a DCT matrix which is finally used to compress the sensor data. In
    our work, we have employed this algorithm to compress our sensor data before saving
    and sending it. It is used because it ensures data compression with minute acceptable
    error in the reconstructed values. CORDIC is capable of computing any mathematical
    operation using simply adders and shifters, thus consuming both less area and
    power. Our concern is power consumption, and CORDIC-based algorithm can help achieve
    maximum energy efficiency. However, the conventional CORDIC faces some drawbacks
    like data dependency and iterative nature, which has been overcome by [11] algorithm
    that also ensures more energy efficiency. This algorithm is preferred over the
    other available in literature. The application of this algorithm can be seen further,
    where it is used to compress the data obtained using the sensors interfaced to
    an IoT device. This device is deployed in a test bed of an automatic irrigation
    system scenario. It is a well-known fact that agriculture is the backbone of the
    Indian economy where the livelihood of a large number of people is dependent on
    it. Agriculture faces certain threats and challenges such as: like pest and disease
    management, effective water utilization, data management and processing, and decision-making.
    These can be tackled by incorporating current technology and advancements in this
    field. So, here, we target application of technology to manage sensor data by
    using energy-efficient compression algorithm discussed in this section. Here,
    we present the application of data compression algorithm, whereas Sect. 3 presents
    its experimental analysis. 2.2 Data Compression Algorithm in IoT Device for Smart
    Irrigation In this paper, sensor data related to an irrigation system are used
    as the test dataset for compression. The data are collected from sensors at regular
    intervals over a space which are compressed before storing and sending. Here,
    the spatiotemporal properties of the data are exploited for compression. Data
    collected at time instances are given by Eq. 1. It gives dataset of different
    time instances that are independent of each other, where, t → {t1:tn}: the time
    instance at which data are gathered and {T, H, S} are the temperature, humidity,
    and soil moisture at time t. Similarly, a set of spatial instances is given by
    Eq. 2, where S → {S1:Sn}: sample space that collects data at t time instant. Data
    are gathered at various time instances from multiple sensors placed at different
    locations and have redundancy in it, so the spatiotemporal properties can be utilized
    which make compression possible. $$ \\begin{gathered} t_{0} :T_{0} ,H_{0} ,S_{0}
    \\hfill \\\\ t_{1} :T_{1} ,H_{1} ,S_{1} \\hfill \\\\ t_{n} :T_{n} ,H_{n} ,S_{n}
    \\hfill \\\\ \\end{gathered} $$ (1) $$ \\begin{gathered} S_{0} :[T,H,S]@t_{0}
    \\hfill \\\\ S_{1} :[T,H,S]@t_{1} \\hfill \\\\ S_{n} :[T,H,S]@t_{n} \\hfill \\\\
    \\end{gathered} $$ (2) When DCT is performed on a data, it can be observed in
    the frequency domain that most of the energy is contained in first few coefficients
    only, whereas it is equally spread in the spatial domain. This is due to the energy
    compaction property of DCT which says that DCT packs critical information in fewer
    coefficients and requires less computational resources to transform the data.
    Here, DCT is applied to the sensor data, and Fig. 2 shows the energy contained
    by the DCT elements for temperature, humidity, and soil moisture data. From the
    figure, we can see that almost 90% of the total energy is contained in the first
    few elements only, thus providing an opportunity for performing compression. Algorithm
    1 gives the pseudo-code which is implemented on our IoT device [12]. Here, the
    sensor data are used as the input which are compressed using quality tunable CORDIC
    to get the output in compressed form. The sensor data obtained in real time at
    a rate of 5 min are arranged in 2D form on which DCT is applied. The algorithm
    computes the DCT coefficients and forms an 8 × 8 matrix. It is used on the sensor-gathered
    data to compress it in batches of 64 sensor values. This 8 × 8 DCT transformed
    matrix is reduced to 4 × 4 which is used for reconstructing the data. This reconstructed
    data are used for final decision-making mechanism on the IoT device used in the
    irrigation system. The block diagram for DCT-based data compression technique
    on smart irrigation system can be seen from Fig. 3. The decision taken using the
    original as well as using the reconstructed data have been evaluated and compared
    for the reliability of the algorithm. The results have been mentioned in Sect.

    results obtained to prove the efficacy of algorithm usage in irrigation system
    scenario. To check its effectiveness, the algorithm has been initially modeled
    in MATLAB, and the results of an automatic irrigation application scenario have
    been obtained accordingly. After required results are obtained, the data compression
    algorithm is implemented on the device for the automatic irrigation system scenario.
    Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture data have been used by the algorithm
    which were obtained from sensors implanted at a test site that were controlled
    using our system [12]. The energy of CORDIC-based DCT algorithm has been compared
    with basic [13], scale-free [14], and look ahead [15] CORDIC architectures and
    mentioned in this section. The components used to create the device that runs
    the compression algorithm have been listed in Table 1. Table 1 Components used
    Full size table After the data are obtained, it is used by the algorithm to check
    for the mean and variance in the data so that compression could be done accordingly.
    For this sample data values, the mean and variance in the original data could
    be seen in Fig. 4. These figures give the block-wise mean of temperature, humidity,
    and soil moisture values, where each block consists of 64 values of each data.
    These values are then compressed using the algorithm and reconstructed in order
    to see the algorithm efficiency. A similar analysis is done on the reconstructed
    data also. Fig. 4 Block-wise mean and variance observed in original data values
    Full size image Figure 5 shows the original and the reconstructed values for the
    sensor data. It can be observed from the figures that the reconstructed data follow
    the same pattern as that of the original uncompressed form, which proves that
    the algorithm maintains the data authenticity and is less prone to errors. It
    has been observed that the range of values of the sensor data {T, H}, i.e., the
    consecutively fetched values do not have significant difference between them.
    This on transform and compression does not lead to considerable error. (Here,
    M is not included since its value is controlled by the irrigation system). The
    algorithm is used in the maximum energy-saving mode which introduces maximum amount
    of approximation in the data. The error reflected in the reconstructed values
    is obtained using this mode. Thus, the error seen in reconstructed data is the
    maximum possible error. Fig. 5 Original and reconstructed temperature, humidity,
    and soil moisture data values Full size image Apart from the mean and variance
    of sensor data and the reconstructed data, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis
    of the input as well as the reconstructed data have also been obtained, and their
    corresponding values can be seen from Table 2. Skewness gives the degree of distortion
    from the normal distribution. It is a measure of symmetry, and its value infers
    whether the data are symmetric or it lacks symmetry. A value between −0.5 and
    0.5 implies that the data are fairly symmetrical; if it lies between −1 and −0.5,
    it means that the data are moderately skewed, whereas other values mean that the
    data are highly skewed. Kurtosis on the other hand is the measure of degree of
    distortion and a measure of outliers. It is used to know whether the dataset is
    free from outliers and if not, it gives a measure of the outlier presence. Data
    with kurtosis that fall beyond −3 or +3 mean outliers’ presence, whereas other
    low values imply lack of outliers in the data. Thus, these parameters are important
    as they convey important information regarding our data. In light of this, before
    proceeding toward any processing on the data, it is beneficial to get this information
    about the data and proceed accordingly. The values for both the original dataset
    and the reconstructed data can be seen from Table 2. It can be observed that the
    all the parameters of original and reconstructed data are almost similar. The
    value of skewness implies that the data is slightly skewed which is acceptable.
    Furthermore, from the value of kurtosis for temperature, humidity and soil moisture
    data it can be inferred that the data does not have any outliers. This means that
    the data consist of actual values fetched from the sensors, and no external additions
    have been made to the data. Table 2 Standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis
    of original and reconstructed data Full size table The final outcome of an irrigation
    system is control of water supply to the crops. In such system that employs an
    IoT device, this decision is based on sensor values. The compression algorithm
    used here can be validated and proved authentic only if the decisions taken on
    original and reconstructed data are the same. This has been generated by the device,
    and Table 3 gives a comparison of the irrigation-related decisions taken on the
    original and reconstructed data values. It can be seen from the table that the
    decision taken on actual sensor data and the reconstructed data is the same. The
    decision taken on the reconstructed data is the same as that taken using the original
    data, with nil error in the final decision. This means that the decision is maintained
    even after the data are compressed, thus making it reliable for use in decision-making
    in automatic irrigation systems. The comparison of energy consumption of different
    CORDIC architectures with the one implemented in this paper can be seen from Table
    4. It can be observed that CORDIC algorithm used in our irrigation system outperforms
    existing basic, scale-free, and look ahead algorithms. Table 3 Decision on original
    versus reconstructed data Full size table Table 4 Energy consumption comparison
    Full size table 4 Conclusion and Future Scope Irrespective of the application
    of IoT, huge amount of data is generated by the device which consists of useful
    information that needs to be stored. The limited memory of IoT devices makes it
    difficult to store the data offline in its original form. This calls for data
    compression mechanisms that can be implemented on the device before sending out
    the data for processing. Compression technique that is energy efficient is beneficial
    for a device which is battery operated. Work presented in this paper has considered
    one such application of smart agriculture, i.e., an irrigation system, where it
    uses the spatiotemporal properties of the data and an energy-efficient CORDIC-based
    DCT compression algorithm on the IoT device. This algorithm is 47% energy efficient
    when operated in least energy saving mode and 90% energy efficient than conventional
    CORDIC. It exploits the energy compaction property of DCT and the low-power needs
    of CORDIC, combines advantages of both algorithms and has applied it for data
    compression. Results obtained infer that compression is achieved at the cost of
    infinitesimal error in the reconstructed values. It is also free from outliers.
    As a result, the final decision outcome based on the reconstructed data is not
    compromised. This algorithm is not just specific to smart irrigation system, but
    can also it can be applied in any domain where enormous data are generated by
    the sensor. In future, more capability can be added by applying an outlier detection
    algorithm on the system. This almost removes the possibility of erroneous data
    due to malfunctioning of the sensors. References Ashton, K.: That ‘Internet of

  limitations: The paper focuses on the energy efficiency and accuracy of the CORDIC-based
    data compression algorithm, but it does not provide details on other aspects of
    the IoT device, such as network connectivity, security, or scalability. Additionally,
    while the authors mention the application of their algorithm to smart irrigation
    systems, they do not provide specific examples or case studies to demonstrate
    its practical implementation in real-world scenarios.

  title: Spatiotemporal Data Compression on IoT Devices in Smart Irrigation System
  verbatim_quote1: '"Results obtained infer that compression is achieved at the cost
    of infinitesimal error in the reconstructed values. It is also free from outliers.
    As a result, the final decision outcome based on the reconstructed data is not
    compromised."'
  verbatim_quote2: '"The CORDIC algorithm used in our irrigation system outperforms
    existing basic, scale-free, and look ahead algorithms."'
  verbatim_quote3: '>'

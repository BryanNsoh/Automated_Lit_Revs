    (WSNs) have attracted substantial research interest, especially in the context
    of performing monitoring and surveillance tasks. However, it is challenging to
    strike compelling tradeoffs amongst the various conflicting optimization criteria,
    such as the network''s energy dissipation, packet-loss rate, coverage, and lifetime.
    This paper provides a tutorial and survey of recent research and development efforts
    addressing this issue by using the technique of multi-objective optimization (MOO).

    Then, we elaborate on various prevalent approaches conceived for MOO, such as
    the family of mathematical programming-based scalarization methods, the family
    of heuristics/metaheuristics-based optimization algorithms, and a variety of other

    SECTION I. Introduction A. Motivation Wireless sensor networks (WSN) consist of
    a large number of compact, low-cost, low-power, multi-functional sensor nodes
    that communicate wirelessly over short distances [1], [2]. In WSNs, the sensor
    nodes are generally deployed randomly in the field of interest, which are extensively
    used for performing monitoring and surveillance tasks [3]–[5]. Depending on the
    specific application scenarios, WSNs may rely on diverse performance metrics to
    be optimized. For example, the energy efficiency and network lifetime are among
    the major concerns in WSNs, since the sensor nodes are typically powered by battery,
    whose replacement is often difficult. Furthermore, the network coverage, latency
    and the fairness among sensor nodes are important for maintaining the quality-of-service
    quality-of-service (QoS) [6], [7]. In practice, these metrics often conflict with
    each other, hence the careful balancing of the trade-offs among them is vital
    in terms of optimizing the overall performance of WSNs in real applications. In
    conventional WSN designs, typically the most salient performance metric is chosen
    as the optimization objective, while the remaining performance metrics are normally
    treated as the constraints of the optimization problem. Such single-objective
    optimization approaches, however, may be unfair and unreasonable in real WSN applications,
    since it artificially over-emphasizes the importance of one of the metrics to
    the detriment of the rest [8]. Hence, a more realistic optimization is to simultaneously
    satisfy multiple objectives, such as the maximal energy efficiency, the shortest
    delay, the longest network lifetime, the highest reliability, and the most balanced
    distribution of the nodes’ residual energy, or the trade-offs among the above
    objectives [9], [10]. Accordingly, multi-objective optimization multi-objective
    optimization (MOO) can be naturally adopted for solving the above problem, since
    it may be more consistent with the realistic scenarios [11]. MOO algorithms have
    been a subject of intense interest to researchers for solving diverse multi-objective
    optimization problems (MOP), in which multiple objectives are treated simultaneously
    subject to a set of constraints [12]. However, it is infeasible for multiple objectives
    to achieve their respective optima at the same time, thus there may not exist
    a single globally optimal solution, which is the best with respect to all objectives.
    Nevertheless, there exists a set of Pareto-optimal or non-dominated solutions
    generating a set of Pareto-optimal outcomes/objective vectors, which is called
    Pareto front/frontier Pareto front (PF) or Pareto boundary/curve/surface. Explicitly,
    the PF is generated by the specific set of solutions, for which none of the multiple
    objectives can be improved without sacrificing the other objectives [13]. This
    set of Pareto-optimal or non-dominated solutions constitutes the focus of our
    interest, and it is also called the Pareto-efficient set or Pareto set Pareto
    set (PS) that is mapped to the PF in the objective function space [14]. Diverse
    approaches, such as mathematical programming based scalarization methods and nature-inspired
    metaheuristics, may be used for finding the PSs of MOPs. Scalarizing an MOP means
    formulating a single-objective optimization problem such that optimal solutions
    to the single-objective optimization problem are Pareto-optimal solutions to the
    MOP [15]. In addition, it is often required that every Pareto-optimal solution
    can be reached with the aid of specific parameters of the scalarization. Representatives
    of scalarization methods include the linear weighted-sum method, the ε -constraints
    method [15] and goal programming goal programming (GP) based methods. MOPs are
    more often solved by bio-inspired metaheuristics, such as multi-objective evolutionary
    algorithms (MOEAs) [16], [17] and swarm intelligence based optimization algorithms
    (SIOAs) [18]. MOEAs aim for finding a set of representative Pareto-optimal solutions
    in a single run [14], [19], [20]. As a subset of MOEAs, the multi-objective genetic
    algorithms (MOGAs), such as the strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm strength
    Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA) [16] and the non-dominated sorting genetic
    algorithm-II non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) [21], have been
    particularly widely researched in the family of MOO algorithms [22], because they
    are capable of efficiently constructing an approximate PF. This is mainly due
    to the fact that MOGAs accommodate a diverse variety of bio-inspired operators
    to iteratively generate a population of feasible solutions. Compared to genetic
    algorithms (GAs) that rely on the interplay between genetics and biological evolution,
    SIOAs seek to understand the collective behavior of animals, particularly insects,
    and to use this understanding for solving complex, nonlinear problems. One of
    the most widely used SIOAs is the ant colony optimization ant colony optimization
    (ACO) algorithm [23], which has indeed been invoked for solving the MOPs in WSNs
    [24]. Several other bio-inspired algorithms related to swarm intelligence will
    be surveyed in Section IV. B. Contributions of This Survey In this paper, we focus
    our attention on various basic concepts, conflicting performance criteria/optimization
    objectives, as well as the MOO techniques conceived for striking a trade-off in
    the context of WSNs. The contributions of our work are four-fold, which are listed
    as follows: We provide in-depth discussions on the basics, metrics and relevant
    algorithms conceived for MOO in WSNs. We present a comprehensive coverage and
    clear classification of various prevalent MOO algorithms conceived for solving
    MOPs, and clarify the strengths and weaknesses of each MOO algorithm in the context
    of WSNs. We provide an exhaustive review of the up-to-date research progress of
    MOO in WSNs according to different trade-off metrics. We highlight a variety of
    open research challenges and identify possible future trends for MOO in WSNs,
    according to the latest developments of WSNs. C. Paper Organization The reminder
    of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we summarize the related
    surveys of MOO in WSNs. In Section III, we commence with an overview of WSNs in
    terms of their system model and applications. Furthermore, we introduce the main
    optimization objectives of interest in WSNs. In Section IV, we present the family
    of MOO techniques that can in principle be used for solving this kind of problems.
    In Section V, we provide an overview of the existing studies dedicated to multi-objective
    methods in WSNs. Finally, in Section VI we describe a range of open problems and
    possible future research directions, followed by our conclusions in Section VII.
    For the sake of explicit clarity, the organization of this paper is shown in Fig.
    1. Fig. 1. The organization of this paper. Show All SECTION II. Related Surveys
    and Tutorials A range of surveys have been dedicated to diverse single-objective
    research domains in WSNs, such as their energy efficiency [25], routing [26],
    congestion control [27], their MAC protocols [28], data collection [6], privacy
    and security [29], localization [30], [31], cross-layer QoS guarantees [32], sink
    mobility management [33], and network virtualization [34]. In recent years, several
    surveys and tutorials advocated MOO methods for optimizing the conflicting performance
    objectives of WSNs. Specifically, Wang et al. [35] provided a review of recent
    studies on multi-objective scheduling and discussed its future research trends.
    In [36], the MOO criteria and strategies conceived for node deployment in WSNs
    were surveyed. Performance trade-off mechanisms of the routing protocols designed
    for energy-efficient WSNs were reviewed in [37], where various artificial intelligence
    techniques and the related technical features of the routing protocols were discussed.
    Coello [38] surveyed the most representative MOEAs and their major applications
    from a historical perspective. Konak et al. [39] presented a comprehensive survey
    and tutorial of MOGAs. Furthermore, Adnan et al. [40] provided a holistic overview
    of bio-inspired optimization techniques, such as particle swarm optimization particle
    swarm optimization (PSO), ACO and GA. In particular, Kulkarni and Venayagamoorthy
    [41] presented a brief survey of how to apply PSO in WSN applications, while bearing
    in mind the peculiar characteristics of sensor nodes. They also presented a state-of-the-art
    survey of computational intelligence in the context of WSNs and highlighted numerous
    challenges facing each of the MOPs discussed [42]. Additionally, Jabbar et al.
    [43] reviewed the optimization in biological systems and discussed bio-inspired
    optimization of non-biological systems. In contrast to other surveys, Deif and
    Gadallah [44] provided a classification of algorithms proposed in the literature
    for planned deployment of WSNs. They discussed and compared diverse WSN deployment
    algorithms in terms of their assumptions, objectives and performance. Additionally,
    in a more recent study Iqbal et al. [45], [46] reviewed the MOO techniques and
    simulation tools conceived for solving different problems related to the design,
    operation, deployment, placement, planning and management of WSNs. The above-mentioned
    surveys related to MOO in WSNs are outlined at a glance in Table I, which allows
    the readers to capture the main contributions of each of the existing surveys.
    TABLE I Existing Surveys Relating to MOO in WSNs SECTION III. Fundamentals of
    WSNs A. System Model WSNs generally consist of hundreds or potentially even thousands
    of spatially distributed, low-cost, low-power, multi-functional, autonomous sensor
    nodes and communicate over short distances [1]. Each node is usually equipped
    with a sensor unit, a processor, a radio transceiver, an A/D converter, a memory
    unit, and a power supply (battery). The typical architecture of a WSN node is
    illustrated in Fig. 2. A WSN node may also have additional application-dependent
    components attached, such as the location finding system and mobilizer. By combining
    these different components into a miniaturized device, these sensor nodes become
    multi-functional. In other words, the structure and characteristics of sensor
    nodes depend both on their electronic, mechanical and communication limitations,
    as well as on their application-specific requirements. One of the great challenges
    facing WSNs is to use such resource-constrained sensor nodes to meet certain application
    requirements, including sensing coverage, network lifetime and end-to-end delay.
    Fig. 2. Typical architecture of a WSN node. Show All Typically, sensor nodes are
    grouped into clusters, and each cluster has a node that acts as the cluster head,
    which has more resources and computational power than the other cluster nodes.
    All nodes gather and deliver their sensed information to the cluster head, which
    in turn forwards it to a specialized node, namely the sink node or base station,
    via a hop-by-hop wireless communication link. In indoor scenarios, a WSN is typically
    rather small and consists of a single cluster supported by a single base station.
    Multiple clusters relying on multiple base stations are possible in a large-scale
    deployment of WSNs. Fig. 3 shows the relationship between WSNs and the infrastructure-based
    networks. Typically, a sink node or base station is responsible for gathering
    the uplink information gleaned from sensor nodes through either single-hop or
    multi-hop communications. Then, the sink node sends the collected information
    to the interested users via a gateway, often using the internet or any other communication
    path [47]. It should be noted that with the development of machine-to-machine
    communications, it is possible to have sensors and machines directly connected
    to cellular network based mobile Internet. Fig. 3. Wireless sensor networks and
    their relationship to infrastructure-based networks. Show All At the time of writing,
    the most common way of constructing WSNs relies on the ZigBee communications protocol,
    which complies with the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, outlining the specifications of
    both the physical layer physical layer (PHY) and the medium access control medium
    access control (MAC) layer. This is widely regarded as the de facto standard for
    WSNs [48]. A WSN operates in the unlicensed industrial, scientific, and medical
    industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band, in which it coexists with many
    other successful communication systems, such as the IEEE 802.11 standard based
    wireless local area network wireless local area network (WLAN) and the 802.15.1
    standard based Bluetooth communication systems. Therefore, a WSN may face the
    challenge of co-channel interferences imposed by both other WSNs and other co-existing
    heterogeneous wireless systems. This coexistence problem may substantially affect
    the performance of WSNs. B. Applications In WSNs, sensor nodes are generally deployed
    randomly in the majority of application domains. When the sensor nodes are deployed
    in hostile remote environments, they may be equipped with high-efficiency energy
    harvesting devices (e.g., solar cells) for extending the network lifetime [49].
    Numerous practical applications of WSNs have been rolled out with the advancement
    of technologies. In general, the applications of WSNs can be classified into two
    types: monitoring and tracking. Monitoring is used for analyzing, supervising
    and carefully controlling operation of a system in real-time. Tracking is generally
    used for following the change of an event, a person, an animal, and so on. Existing
    monitoring applications include indoor/outdoor environmental monitoring [50],
    industrial monitoring [51], precision agriculture (e.g., irrigation management
    and crop disease prediction) [52], biomedical or health monitoring [53], electrical
    network monitoring [54], military location monitoring [55], and so forth. Tracking
    applications include habitat tracking [56], traffic tracking [57], military target
    tracking [58], etc. We summarize their classification in Fig. 4. Fig. 4. Taxonomy
    of WSN applications. Show All A more detailed portrayal of WSN applications is
    given in Fig. 5. For instance, in environmental monitoring, WSNs can help us perform
    forest fire detection, flood detection, forecast of earthquakes and eruptions,
    pollution monitoring, etc. [50], [59]. In industry and agriculture, WSNs can sense
    and detect farming and wildlife, monitor equipment and goods, protect commercial
    property, predict crop disease and production quality, control pests and diseases,
    etc. [51], [52]. In healthcare and biomedical applications, WSNs can be utilized
    for diagnostics, distance-monitoring of patients and their physiological data,
    as well as for tracking the medicine particles inside patients’ body, etc. [53].
    In particular, WSN based wireless body area networks (WBAN) can help monitor human
    body functions and characteristics (e.g., artificial retina, vital signs, automatic
    drug delivery, etc.), acting as an in vitro or in vivo diagnostic system [60].
    In the infrastructure, WSNs have been widely used for monitoring the railway systems
    and their components, such as bridges, rail tracks, track beds, track equipment,
    as well as chassis, wheels, and wagons that are closely related to rolling stock
    quality [61]. WSNs also allow users to manage various appliances both locally
    and remotely for building automation applications [62]. In military target tracking
    and surveillance, a WSN can assist in intrusion detection and identification.
    Specific examples include enemy troop and tank movements, battle damage assessment,
    detection and reconnaissance of biological, chemical and nuclear attacks, etc.
    [58]. Fig. 5. Overview of WSN applications in real environments. Here, SHIMMER
    represents the Intel digital health group’s “sensing health with intelligence,
    modularity, mobility, and experimental re-usability” [47]. Show All Furthermore,
    several novel WSN application scenarios, such as the Internet of Things [63],
    cyber-physical systems [64] and smart grids [65], among others, have adopted new
    design approaches that support multiple concurrent applications on the same WSN.
    The applications of WSNs are not limited to the areas mentioned in this paper.
    The future prospects of WSN applications are promising in terms of revolutionizing
    our daily lives. C. MOO Metrics In this subsection, a succinct overview of the
    most popular optimization objectives of WSNs is provided. Over the past years,
    a number of research contributions have addressed diverse aspects of WSNs, including
    their protocols [66], routing [67], energy conservation [25], lifetime [68] and
    so forth. The QoS, as perceived by the users or applications, was given insufficient
    attention at the beginning. However, at the time of writing, how to provide the
    desired QoS is becoming an increasingly important topic for researchers. Different
    applications may have their own specific QoS requirements, but some of the more
    commonly used metrics for characterizing QoS are the coverage area and quality,
    the delay, the number of active nodes, the bit-error rate bit-error rate (BER)
    and the overall WSN lifetime. There are many other QoS metrics worth mentioning,
    and a range of factors affecting the QoS in WSNs are portrayed in Fig. 6, which
    was directly inspired by [69] and reflects the application requirements of a WSN.
    It is indeed plausible that the network’s performance can be quantified in terms
    of its energy conservation, lifetime, and QoS-based metrics in specific applications.
    However, multiple metrics usually conflict with each other. For example, when
    more energy is consumed by the nodes, the operating lifetime of the network reduces.
    Similarly, if more active nodes are deployed in a given region, a lower per-node
    power is sufficient for maintaining connectivity, but the overall delay is likely
    to be increased due to the increased number of hops. Hence, an application-specific
    compromise has to be struck between having more short hops imposing a lower power
    dissipation but higher delay and having more longer hops, which reduces the delay
    but may increase the transmit-power dissipation. Fig. 6. The interplay of factors
    affecting the QoS in WSNs. Show All 1) Coverage: “Coverage” is one of the most
    important performance metrics for a sensor network. In other wireless communication
    networks, coverage typically means the radio coverage. By contrast, coverage in
    the context of WSNs corresponds to the sensing range, while connectivity corresponds
    to the communication range. WSN coverage can be classified into three types: area
    coverage, point coverage and barrier coverage [44]. In area coverage, the coverage
    quality of an entire two-dimensional two-dimensional (2D) region is considered,
    where each point in the region is observed by at least one sensor node. In point
    coverage, the objective is to simply guarantee that a finite set of points in
    the region are observed by at least one sensor node. Barrier coverage usually
    deals with the detection of movement across a barrier of sensor nodes. The most
    richly studied coverage problem in the WSN literature is the area coverage problem.
    The characterization of the coverage varies depending both on the underlying models
    of each node’s field of view and on the metric used for appraising the collective
    coverage. Several coverage models [70]–[72] have been proposed for different application
    scenarios. A coverage model is normally defined with respect to the sensing range
    of a sensor node. The most commonly used node coverage model is the so-called
    sensing disk model, where all points within a disk centered at the node are considered
    to be covered by the node [73]. More specifically, a point p is regarded to be
    covered/monitored by at least a node v if their Euclidean distance is less than
    the sensing range R s of node v . Given a set of nodes, finding the optimal positions
    of these nodes to achieve maximum coverage is in general an NP-complete problem
    [11]. There are many different ways of solving the coverage optimization problem
    suboptimally. Here, in order to make the coverage problem more computationally
    manageable, we consider an area A represented by a rectangular grid, which is
    divided into G=xy rectangular cells of identical size, and let ( x j , y j ) denote
    the coordinate of node j . As a result, the network coverage C v (x) is defined
    as the percentage of the adequately covered cells over the total cells of A and
    it is evaluated as follows [11], [74]: C v (x)= ∑ x x ′ =0 ∑ y y ′ =0 g( x ′ ,
    y ′ ) xy , (1) View Source and g( x ′ , y ′ )={ 1, if ∃ j∈{1,…,N}, d ( x j , y
    j ),( x ′ , y ′ ) ≤ R s , 0, otherwise, (2) View Source where N is the number
    of nodes, g( x ′ , y ′ ) is the monitoring status of the cell centered at ( x
    ′ , y ′ ) , R s is the sensing range of a node, and d ( x j , y j ),( x ′ , y
    ′ ) is the distance from the location of node j to the cell centered at ( x ′
    , y ′ ) . Having a better coverage also leads to a higher probability of detecting
    the event monitored [75]. 2) Network Connectivity: Another issue in WSN design
    is the network connectivity that is dependent on the selected communication protocol
    [76]. Two sensor nodes are directly connected if the distance of the two nodes
    is smaller than the communication range R c . Connectivity only requires that
    the location of any active node is within the communication range of one or more
    active nodes, so that all active nodes can form a connected communication network.
    The most common protocol relies on a cluster-based architecture, where all nodes
    in the same cluster can directly communicate with each other via a single hop
    and all nodes in the same cluster can communicate with all nodes in the neighboring
    clusters via the cluster head. In a given cluster only a single node acts as the
    cluster head, which has to be active in terms of collecting all information gleaned
    by the other nodes for the sake of maintaining connectivity. In cluster-based
    WSNs, the connectivity issues tend to hinge on the number of nodes in each cluster
    (because a cluster head can only handle up to a specific number of connected nodes),
    as well as on the coverage issues related to the ability of any location to be
    covered by at least one active sensor node. For an area represented by a rectangular
    grid of size x×y , let R c i and R s i denote the communication range and sensing
    range of the i th sensor node, respectively. To guarantee each sensor node is
    placed within the communication range of at least another sensor node and to prevent
    sensor nodes from becoming too close to each others, the objective function associated
    with the network connectivity can be expressed as [77] f con = ∑ i=1 x×y 1− e
    −( R c i − R s i ) , (3) View Source where R c i − R s i >0 has to be satisfied
    for achieving network connectivity. Maintaining the network’s connectivity is
    essential for ensuring that the messages are indeed propagated to the appropriate
    sink node or base station, and the loss of connectivity is often treated as the
    end of the network’s lifetime. Network connectivity is closely related to the
    coverage and energy efficiency of WSNs. To elaborate a little further, substantial
    energy savings can be achieved by dynamic management of node duty cycles in WSNs
    having high node density. In this method, some nodes can be scheduled to sleep
    (or enter a power-saving mode), while the remaining active nodes provide continuous
    service. As far as this approach is concerned, a fundamental problem is to minimize
    the number of nodes that remain active while still achieving acceptable QoS. In
    particular, maintaining an adequate sensing coverage and network connectivity
    with the active nodes is a critical requirement in WSNs. The relationship between
    coverage and connectivity hinges on the ratio of the communication range to the
    sensing range. A connected network may not be capable of guaranteeing adequate
    coverage regardless of the ranges. By contrast, Wang et al. [78] and Xing et al.
    [79] presented a sufficient condition for guaranteeing network connectivity, which
    states that for a set of nodes that cover a convex region, the network remains
    connected if R c ≥2 R s . There exist tighter relationships between R c and R
    s for achieving network connectivity, provided that adequate sensing coverage
    is guaranteed [80]–[82]. Intuitively, if the communications range of sensor nodes
    is sufficiently large, then maintaining connectivity is not a problem, because
    in this case there always exists a node to communicate with. A more in-depth discussion
    of the relationship between coverage, connectivity and energy efficiency of WSNs
    can be found in [78]–[82]. 3) Network Lifetime: Another important performance
    metric in WSNs is their lifetime. Tremendous research efforts have been invested
    into solving the problem of prolonging network lifetime by energy conservation
    in WSNs. Indeed, the energy source of each node is generally limited, while recharging
    or replacing the battery at the sensors may be impossible. Hence, both the radio
    transceiver unit and the sensor unit of each node have to be energy-efficient,
    and it is vitally important to maximize the attainable network lifetime [83],
    defined as the time interval between the initialization of the network and the
    depletion of the battery of any of the sensor nodes. For the simplicity of exposition,
    typically all sensor nodes are assumed to be of equal importance, which is a reasonable
    assumption, since the “death” of one sensor node may result in the network becoming
    partitioned, or some area requiring monitoring to be uncovered. Thus, the network’s
    lifetime is defined as the time duration from the application’s first activation
    to the time instant when any of the sensor nodes in the cluster fails due to its
    depleted energy source. More explicitly, this objective can be formulated as T
    net =min T j , (4) View Source where j=1,2,…,N . The lifetime of a sensor node
    is generally inversely proportional both to the average rate of its own information
    generated and to the information relayed by this node. Hence, the network’s lifetime
    is also partially determined by the source rates of all the sensor nodes in the
    network. 4) Energy Consumption: Sensor nodes are equipped with limited battery
    power and the total energy consumption of the WSN is a critical consideration.
    Each node consumes some energy during its data acquisition, processing and transmission
    phases. For instance, in a heterogeneous WSN, different sensor nodes might have
    diverse power and data processing capabilities. Hence, the energy consumption
    of a WSN depends both on the Shannon capacity of the channels among the nodes
    and on these nodes’ functionality. The energy consumption of a path P is the sum
    of the energy expended at each node along the path, hence the total energy consumption
    E(P) of a given path is given by [84] E(P)= ∑ i=0 L ( t a i + t p i )× P o i +
    P t i × t m , (5) View Source where t a i and t p i indicate the time durations
    of data acquisition and data processing taking place at node i , respectively.
    L is the number of nodes on the given path. Furthermore, t m is the message transmission
    time, while P o i and P t i denote the operational power and transmission power
    dissipation of node i , respectively. 5) Energy Efficiency: Energy efficiency
    is a key concern in WSNs, and this metric is closely related to network lifetime
    in the particular context of WSNs [90].1 As an example, herein the energy efficiency
    of node i is defined as the ratio of the transmission rate to the power dissipation.
    Explicitly, it is formulated as η i = W log 2 (1+ γ i ) p i , (6) View Source
    where W denotes the communication bandwidth, p i is the transmission power of
    node i and γ i denotes the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio signal-to-interference-plus-noise
    ratio (SINR) at the destination receiver relative to node i , respectively. Due
    to the limited energy resources of each node, we have to utilize these nodes in
    an efficient manner so as to increase the lifetime of the network [91]. There
    are at least two approaches to deal with the energy conservation problem in WSNs.
    The first approach is to plan a schedule of active nodes while enabling the other
    nodes to enter a sleep mode. The second approach is to dynamically adjust the
    sensing range of nodes for the sake of energy conservation. 6) Network Latency:
    For a WSN, typically a fixed bandwidth is available for data transfer between
    nodes. Again, having an increased number of nodes results in more paths becoming
    available for simultaneously routing packets to their destinations, which is beneficial
    for reducing the latency. Meanwhile, this may also degrade the latency that increases
    proportionally to the number of nodes on the invoked paths. This is due to additional
    contention for the wireless channel when the node density increases, as well as
    owing to routing and buffering delays. The delay between source node u so and
    sink node u si , denoted as D u so , u si , is defined as the time elapsed between
    the departure of a collected data packet from u so and its arrival to u si , and
    is given by [92], [93] D u so , u si = = ∝ ( T q + T p + T d )×N( u so , u si
    ) c×N( u so , u si ) N( u so , u si ), (7) View Source where T q is the queue
    delay per intermediate forwarder, T p is the propagation delay and T d is the
    transmission delay. All of them are, for the sake of simplicity, regarded as constants
    and collectively denoted by c . Finally, N( u so , u si ) denotes the total number
    of data disseminators between u so and u si . As a consequence, the minimization
    of the delay corresponds to minimizing the number of intermediate forwarders between
    the source and the sink. It is worth noting that Haenggi and Puccinelli [94] astutely
    argued that long-hop based routing is a very competitive strategy compared to
    short-hop aided routing in terms of latency, albeit this design dilemma also has
    ramifications as to the scarce energy resource of the nodes. 7) Differentiated
    Detection Levels: Differentiated sensor network deployment is also an important
    issue. In many real WSN applications, such as underwater sensor deployments or
    surveillance applications, certain parts of the supervised region may require
    extremely high detection probabilities if these parts constitute safety-critical
    geographic area. However, in the less sensitive geographic area, relatively low
    detection probabilities have to be maintained for reducing the number of nodes
    deployed, which corresponds to reducing the cost imposed. Therefore, different
    geographic areas require different densities of deployed nodes, and the sensing
    requirements are not necessarily uniformly distributed within the entire supervised
    region. Let us use d((m,n),(i,j)) to denote the Euclidean distance between the
    coordinates (m,n) and (i,j) . A probabilistic node detection model can be formulated
    as [95]–[97] p((m,n),(i,j))={ e −ad((m,n),(i,j)) , 0, d((m,n),(i,j))≤ R s , d((m,n),(i,j))>
    R s , (8) View Source where a is a parameter associated with the physical characteristics
    of the sensing device and R s is the sensing range. 8) Number of Nodes: Each sensor
    node imposes a certain cost, including its production, deployment and maintenance.
    As a result, the total cost of the WSN increases with the number of sensor nodes.
    When deploying a WSN in a battleground, sensor nodes have to operate as stealthily
    as possible to avoid being detected by the enemy. This implies that the number
    of nodes has to be kept at a minimum in order to reduce the probability of any
    of them being discovered. [98]–[103] are dedicated to optimal node deployment
    by considering the accomplishment of the specified goals at a minimum cost. Minimizing
    the number of active nodes is equivalent to maximizing the following objective
    [104]: f( K ′ )=1− | K ′ | |K| , (9) View Source where | K ′ | is the number of
    active nodes and |K| is the total number of nodes. 9) Fault Tolerance: Sensor
    nodes may fail, for example, due to the surrounding physical conditions or when
    their energy runs out. It may be difficult to replace the existing nodes, hence
    the network has to be fault tolerant in order to prevent individual failures from
    reducing the network lifetime [36], [105]. In other words, fault tolerance can
    be viewed as an ability to maintain the network’s operation without interruption
    in the case of a node failure, and it is typically implemented in the routing
    and transport protocols. The fault tolerance or reliability R k (t) of a sensor
    node can be modeled using the Poisson distribution in order to capture the probability
    of not having a failure within the time interval (0,t) as [1]: R k (t)= e − λ
    k t , (10) View Source where λ k is the failure rate of sensor node k and t is
    the time period. Numerous studies have been focused on forming k -connected WSNs
    [78], [79], [106]. The k -connectivity implies that there are k independent paths
    in the full set of the pair of nodes. For k≥2 , the network can tolerate some
    node and link failures. Due to the many-to-one interaction pattern, k -connectivity
    is a particularly important design factor in the neighborhood of base stations
    and guarantees maintaining a certain communication capacity among the nodes [106].
    10) Fair Rate Allocation: It is important to guarantee that the sink node receives
    information from all sensor nodes in a fair manner when the bandwidth is limited.
    The accuracy of the received source information depends on the allocated source
    rate. Simply maximizing the total throughput of the network is insufficient for
    guaranteeing the specific application’s performance, since this objective may
    only be achieved at the expense of sacrificing the source rate supposed to be
    allocated to some nodes [107]. For example, in a sensor network that tracks the
    mobility of certain objects in a large field of observation, lower rates impose
    a reduced location tracking accuracy and vice versa. By simply maximizing the
    total throughput instead of additionally considering the above fairness issues
    among sources, we may end up with a solution that shuts off many sources in the
    network and enables only those sources whose transport energy-cost to the sink
    is the lowest. Hence, considering the fairness of rate allocation among different
    sensor nodes is of high significance. An attractive methodology of achieving this
    goal is to adopt a network utility maximization network utility maximization (NUM)
    framework [107], in which a concave, non-decreasing and twice differentiable utility
    function U i ( x i ) quantifies the grade of satisfaction of sensor node i with
    the assigned rate x i , and the goal is to maximize the sum of individual utilities.
    A specific class of utility functions that has been extensively used for achieving
    fair resource allocation in economics and distributed computing [108] is formulated
    as: U α (x)={ logx 1 1−α x 1−α  α=1,  α>1, (11) View Source where x=( x i ,∀i)
    and the functional operations are elementwise. When we have α=1 , the above utility
    function leads to the so-called proportional fairness, whereas when α→∞ , this
    utility function leads to max–min fairness.2 11) Detection Accuracy: Having a
    high target detection accuracy is also an important design goal for the sake of
    achieving accurate inference about the target in WSNs. Target detection accuracy
    is directly related to the timely delivery of the density and latency information
    of the WSN. Assume that a node k receives a certain amount of energy e k (u) from
    a target located at location u and K o is the energy emitted by the target. Then,
    the signal energy e k (u) measured by node k is given by [84] e k (u)= K o /(1+α
    d p k ), (12) View Source where d k is the Euclidean distance between the target
    location and the location of node k , p is the pathloss exponent that typically
    assumes values in the range of [2, 4], while α is an adjustable constant. 12)
    Network Security: Sensor nodes may be deployed in an uncontrollable environment,
    such as a battlefield, where an adversary might aim for launching physical attacks
    in order to capture sensor nodes or to deploy counterfeit ones. As a result, an
    adversary may retrieve private keys used for secure communications by eavesdropping
    and decrypt the communications of the legitimate sensors. Recently, much attention
    has been paid to the security of WSNs. There are two main types of privacy concerns,
    namely data-oriented and context-oriented concerns [29]. Data-oriented concerns
    focus on the privacy of data collected from a WSN, while context-oriented concerns
    concentrate on contextual information, such as the location and timing of traffic
    flows in a WSN. A simple illustration of the two types of security attacks is
    depicted in Fig. 7. Fig. 7. Two types of privacy attacks in a WSN [29]: Data analysis
    attack and traffic analysis attack conducted by a malicious node. Show All We
    can observe from Fig. 7 that a malicious node of the WSN abuses its ability of
    decrypting data in order to compromise the payload being transmitted in the case
    of data analysis attack. In traffic-analysis attacks, the adversary does not have
    the ability to decrypt data payloads. Instead, it eavesdrops to intercept the
    transmitted data and tracks the traffic flow on a hop-by-hop basis. For the sake
    of improving the network security, we can minimize the loss of privacy that is
    calculated based on information theory as [110] ζ=1− 2 −I(S,X) , (13) View Source
    where I(S,X) is the mutual information between the random variables S and X .
    More specifically, S represents the current position of the node of interest,
    X is the observed variable known to the attacker and correlated to S , while I(S,X)=H(S)−H(S|X)
    with H(⋅) denoting the entropy. Additionally, we can also minimize the probability
    of eavesdropping in a WSN, as presented in [111], to improve the network security.
    Table II summarizes the representative existing contributions to optimizing the
    particular WSN performance metrics mentioned above. TABLE II Major Existing Approaches
    for Evaluating/Improving/Optimizing Each Metric SECTION IV. Techniques of MOO
    In this section, we briefly present the MOO techniques proposed in the literature
    for tackling various important problems in WSNs. A. Optimization Strategies Optimization
    covers almost all aspects of human life and work. In practice, the resources are
    limited, hence optimization is important. Most research activities in computer
    science and engineering involve a certain amount of modeling, data analysis, computer
    simulations and mathematical optimization. This branch of applied science aims
    for finding the particular values of associated variables, which results in either
    the minimum or the maximum values of a single objective function or multiple objective
    functions [40]. A typical optimization process is composed of three components
    [43]: the model, the optimizer/algorithm and the evaluator/simulator, as shown
    in Fig. 8. The representation of the physical problem is carried out by using
    mathematical formulations to establish a mathematical model. Fig. 8. A simple
    illustration of optimization process. Show All As an important step of solving
    any optimization problem, an efficient optimizer or algorithm has to be designed
    for ensuring that the optimal solution is obtained. There is no single algorithm
    that is suitable for all problems. Optimization algorithms can be classified in
    many ways, depending on the specific characteristics that we set out to compare.
    In general, optimization algorithms can be classified as: Finitely terminating
    algorithms, such as the family of simplex algorithms and their extensions, as
    well as the family of combinatorial algorithms; Convergent iterative methods that
    evaluate Hessians (or approximate Hessians, using finite differences), such as
    Newton’s method and sequential quadratic programming; evaluate gradients or approximate
    gradients using finite differences (or even subgradients), such as quasi-Newton
    methods, conjugate gradient methods, interior point methods, gradient descent
    (alternatively, “steepest descent” or “steepest ascent”) methods, subgradient
    methods, bundle method of descent, ellipsoid method, reduced gradient method,
    and simultaneous perturbation based stochastic approximation methods; and evaluate
    only function values, such as interpolation methods and pattern search methods.
    Heuristics/metaheuristics that can provide approximate solutions to some optimization
    problems. Recently, bio-mimetic heuristics/metaheuristics based strategies have
    been widely used for solving MOPs, since they are capable of obtaining near-optimal
    solutions to optimization problems characterized by non-differential nonlinear
    objective functions, which are particularly hard to deal with using classical
    gradient- or Hessian-based algorithms. A general MOP consists of a number of objectives
    to be simultaneously optimized and it is associated with a number of inequality
    and equality constraints. Without loss of generality, a multi-objective minimization
    problem having n variables and m ( m>1 ) objectives can be formulated as min f(x)=
    s.t.  g i (x)≤ h j (x)= min[ f 1 (x), f 2 (x),…, f m (x)] 0, i=1,2,…, m ie , 0,
    j=1,2,…, m eq , (14) View Source where we have x∈ R n with R n being the decision
    space, and f(x)∈ R m with R m representing the objective space. The objective
    functions of (14) are typically in conflict with each other in the real world.
    Explicitly, the improvement of one of the objectives may result in the degradation
    of other objectives, thus it is important to achieve the Pareto-optimality, which
    represents the conditions when none of the objective functions can be reduced
    without increasing at least one of the other objective functions [13]. For the
    minimization of m objectives f 1 (x), f 2 (x),…, f m (x) , we have the following
    definitions. Non-dominated solutions: A solution a is said to dominate a solution
    b if and only if [170]: f i (a)≤ f i (b)  ∀i∈{1,2,…,m} , f i (a)< f i (b)  ∃i∈{1,2,…,m}
    . Solutions that dominate the others but do not dominate themselves are termed
    non-dominated solutions. Local optimality in the Pareto sense: A solution a is
    said to be locally optimal in the Pareto sense, if there exists a real ϵ>0 such
    that there is no other solution b dominating the solution a with b∈ R n ∩B(a,ϵ)
    , where B(a,ϵ) shows a bowl having a center a and a radius ϵ . Global optimality
    in the Pareto sense: A solution a is globally optimal in the Pareto sense, if
    there does not exist any vector b that dominates the vector a . The main difference
    between global and local optimality lies in the fact that for global optimality
    we no longer have a restriction imposed on the decision space R n . Pareto-optimality:
    A feasible solution is said to be Pareto-optimal, when it is not dominated by
    any other solutions in the feasible space. PS, which is also often referred to
    as the efficient set, is the collection of all Pareto-optimal solutions and their
    corresponding images in the objective space are termed the PF. The PF of an MOP
    is portrayed both with and without constrains in Fig. 9. Observe from Fig. 9 (a)
    that the Pareto-optimal solutions of the objective functions in the PF (marked
    as asterisk) provide better values than any other solution in R m . The ideal
    solution marked by a square indicates the joint minimum of the objective values
    f 1 and f 2 and it is often difficult to reach. The remaining solutions marked
    as solid circles are all dominated by at least one solution of the PF. In contrast
    to the unconstrained scenario of Fig. 9 (a), in Fig. 9 (b), the curve illustrates
    the PF of a constrained MOP. The solid circles in the feasible region represent
    the feasible solutions, while the remaining points outside the feasible region
    (e.g., the points marked by triangles) are infeasible [171]. Fig. 9. The PF of
    MOP with and without constrains, m=2 . Show All B. MOO Algorithms Numerous studies
    have been devoted to the subject of MOO and a variety of algorithms have been
    developed for solving MOPs in WSNs. In fact, optimization algorithms are more
    diverse than the types of objective functions, but the right choice of the objective
    function has a much more grave impact than the specific choice of the optimization
    algorithm. Nevertheless, the careful choice of the optimization algorithm is also
    vital, especially when complex MOPs are considered. Solving an MOP means finding
    the PS of the MOP. As mentioned in Section I, there are various classes of methods
    designed for generating the PSs of MOPs, such as mathematical programming based
    scalarization methods, nature-inspired metaheuristics, and so forth. It should
    be noted that scalarizing an MOP means formulating a single-objective optimization
    problem whose optimal solutions are also Pareto-optimal solutions to the MOP [15].
    Additionally, it is often required that every Pareto-optimal solution can be reached
    with the aid of specific parameters of the scalarization. 1) Mathematical Programming
    Based Scalarization Methods: Mathematical programming based classic scalarization
    methods conceived for MOO include the linear weighted-sum method, the ϵ -constraints
    method [15], and the goal programming (GP) based methods [9], [172]–[177], as
    detailed below. a) Linear weighted-sum method: The linear weighted-sum method
    scalarizes multiple performance metrics into a single-objective function by pre-multiplying
    each performance metric (i.e., component objective) with a weight. Since different
    performance metrics have different properties and each metric may have a different
    unit, the normalization must be implemented firstly when using the linear weighted-sum
    method for striking compelling performance trade-offs. Then, a different weight
    is assigned to each metric to get an evaluation function. Finally, the optimal
    compromise is obtained according to the Pareto-optimal solutions generated by
    solving multiple single-objective problems, each corresponding to a specific vector
    of weight values. It can be proved that the optimal solution to each of these
    single-objective problems is a Pareto-optimal solution to the original multi-objective
    problem, i.e., the image of these solutions belong to the PF. The linear weighted-sum
    method is easy to implement and can avoid complex computations, provided that
    the weights are appropriately chosen, since only a single optimal value has to
    be calculated for each single-objective problem. It is worth pointing out that
    all the weights are in the range [0, 1], and the sum of them is 1. However, there
    is no a priori correspondence between a weight vector and a solution vector, and
    the linear weighted-sum method usually uses subjective weights, which often results
    in poor objectivity and makes the objectives to be optimized sensitive to the
    weights. The need to solve multiple single-objective optimization problems with
    the aid of different sets of weight values also implies that a substantial overall
    computational complexity may be imposed. Furthermore, the lack of a reasonable
    weight allocation method degrades its scientific acceptance. To elaborate a little
    further, typically the decision maker is a priori unaware of which weights are
    the most appropriate ones to generate a satisfactory solution, hence he/she does
    not know in general how to adjust the weights to consistently change the solution.
    This also means that it is not easy to develop heuristic algorithms that, starting
    from certain weights, are capable of iteratively generating weight vectors to
    reach a certain portion of the PF. In addition, the linear weighted-sum method
    is incapable of reaching the non-convex parts of the PF. Finally, a uniform spread
    of the weight values, in general, does not produce a uniform spread of points
    on the PF. This fact implies that usually all the points are grouped in certain
    parts of the PF, while some (potentially significant) portions of the PF based
    trade-off curve have not been reached. Note that if the decision maker has a priori
    preference among the multiple objectives considered, or he/she would like to select
    the most satisfactory solution from the Pareto-optimal solutions obtained, a powerful
    multiple criteria decision-making method referred to as the analytical hierarchy
    process analytical hierarchy process (AHP) [178]–[182] can be used to determine
    the relative weights. Using AHP, the weights can be flexibly altered according
    to the specific application requirements. AHP has been widely used in the context
    of trade-off mechanisms (e.g., [183] and [184]), where AHP first decomposes a
    complex problem into a hierarchy of simple subproblems, then synthesizes their
    importance to the original problem, and finally chooses the best solution. b)
    ε -constraints method: The ε -constraints method creates a single-objective function,
    where only one of the original objective functions is optimized while dealing
    with the remaining objective functions as constraints. This method can be expressed
    as [185]: min  f i (x) s.t.  f j ≤ ε j , j≠i, H(x)=0, G(x)≤0, (15) View Source
    where f i (x), i=(1,2,…,N) is the selected function for optimization and the remaining
    N−1 functions act as constraints. It was proved by Miettinen [186] that if an
    objective f j and a vector ε=( ε 1 ,…, ε j−1 , ε j+1 ,…, ε N )∈ R N−1 exist, such
    that x ∗ is an optimal solution to the above problem, then x ∗ is a weak Pareto
    optimum of the original MOP. Therefore, this method is capable of obtaining weak
    Pareto-optimal points by varying the ε vector, but it is not guaranteed to obtain
    all of them. Under certain stronger conditions, it can even obtain the strict
    Pareto optimum [186]. This method is very intuitive and the parameters ε j used
    as upper bounds are easy to interpret. Another advantage of this method is that
    it is capable of finding Pareto-optimal solutions on a non-convex PF. Similar
    to the linear weighted-sum method, having to empirically vary the upper bound
    ε j also implies a drawback of the ε -constraints method, and it is not particularly
    efficient if the number of objective functions is higher than two. c) Goal programming
    (GP): Instead of maximizing multiple objectives, GP is an analytical approach
    devised for solving MOPs, where the goal values (or targets) have been assigned
    to all the objective measures and where the decision-maker is interested in minimizing
    the “non-achievement” of the corresponding goals. In other words, the underlying
    assumption of GP is that the decision-maker seeks a satisfactory and sufficient
    solution with the aid of this strategy. GP can be regarded as an extension or
    generalization of linear programming to handle multiple conflicting objective
    measures. Each of these measures is given a goal or target value to be achieved.
    The sum of undesirable deviations from this set of user-specified target values
    is then minimized with the aid of a so-called achievement function. There are
    various forms of achievement functions, which largely determine the specific GP
    variant. The three oldest and still widely used forms of achievement functions
    include the weighted-sum (Archimedean), preemptive (lexicographic) and MINMAX
    (Chebyshev) [9], [172]–[177]. There exist other scalarization methods devised
    for MOO, such as the conic scalarization method of [176] and [187]. 2) Nature-Inspired
    Metaheuristic Algorithms: MOPs are more often solved by nature-inspired metaheuristics,
    such as multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) [16], [17] and swarm intelligence
    based optimization algorithms (SIOAs) [18]. This is because most classical optimization
    methods are based on a limited number of standard forms, which means that they
    have to comply with the particular structures of objective functions and constraints.
    However, in realistic scenarios it is often impossible to accurately characterize
    the physical problem with an ideal standard-form optimization problem model. Additionally,
    many complicated factors, such as a large number of integer variables, non-linearities,
    and so forth may occur. Both of them can make the realistic problems hard to solve.
    Therefore, the classical mathematical programming based optimization methods may
    not be suitable for solving the MOPs encountered in real-world WSNs. Over the
    most recent decade, metaheuristics have made substantial progress in approximate
    search methods for solving complex optimization problems [188]. A metaheuristic
    technique guides a subordinate heuristic using concepts typically derived from
    the biological, chemical, physical and even social sciences, as well as from artificial
    intelligence, to improve the optimization performance. Compared to mathematical
    programming based methods, metaheuristics based optimization algorithms are relatively
    insensitive to the specific mathematical form of the optimization problems. However,
    the higher the degree of accuracy required, the higher the computational cost
    becomes. So far, the field of metaheuristics based optimization algorithms has
    been mostly constituted by the family of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) [17] and
    the family of SIOAs [44]. In the following, we will review some of their salient
    representatives. a) Evolutionary algorithms (EAs): EAs belong to the family of
    stochastic search algorithms inspired by the natural selection and survival of
    the fittest in the biological world. The goal of EAs is to search for the globally
    near-optimal solutions by repeatedly evaluating the objective functions or fitness
    functions using exploration and exploitation methods. Compared with mathematical
    programming, EAs are eminently suitable for solving MOPs, because they simultaneously
    deal with a set of solutions and find a number of Pareto-optimal solutions in
    a single run of the algorithm. Additionally, they are less susceptible to the
    specific shape or to the continuity of the PF, and they are also capable of approximating
    the discontinuous or non-convex PF [189]. The most efficient PF-based MOEAs have
    been demonstrated to be powerful and robust in terms of solving MOPs [17]. Genetic
    Algorithms (GAs): GAs constitute the most popular branch of EAs [190]. GAs are
    based on genetics and evolutionary theory, and they have been successfully used
    for solving diverse optimization problems, including MOPs. They have appealing
    advantages over traditional mathematical programming based algorithms [44] in
    terms of handling complex problems and convenience for parallel implementation.
    GA can deal with all sorts of objective functions no matter they are stationary
    or transient, linear or nonlinear, continuous or discontinuous. These advantageous
    properties of GAs have inspired their employment in solving MOPs of WSNs. GAs
    rely on the bio-inspired processes of initialization, evaluation, selection, crossover,
    mutation, and replacement, as portrayed in its simplest form in the flow-chart
    of Fig. 10. The MOGA [191] has attracted particularly extensive research attention
    among all the algorithms of MOO. By operating on the generation-by-generation
    basis, a number of Pareto-optimal solutions can be found throughout the evolution
    generations. Thus, obtaining the Pareto-optimal solution set provides us with
    a set of flexible trade-offs. Several solution methods based on MOGAs were presented
    in [112] and [192] for optimizing the layout of a WSN. More specifically, Jourdan
    and De Weck [112] advocated a MOGA for the optimal deployment of static sensor
    nodes in a region of interest, which simultaneously maximized the coverage area
    and the network’s lifetime. The authors then extended their work to three specific
    surveillance scenarios in [192] using the same MOGA. Recently, the non-dominated
    sorting genetic algorithm non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA) [193],
    the niched Pareto genetic algorithm niched Pareto genetic algorithm (NPGA) [194]
    and the SPEA [16] have been recommended as the most efficient MOEAs. Differential
    Evolution differential evolution (DE): DE was developed by Storn and Price [195].
    It is arguably one of the most powerful real-valued optimization algorithms. DE
    relies on similar computational steps as employed by a standard EA. It commences
    its operation from randomly initiated parameter vectors, each of which (also called
    genome or chromosome) forms a candidate solution to the optimization problem.
    Then, a mutant vector (known as donor vector) is obtained by the differential
    mutation operation. To enhance the potential diversity of the candidate solutions,
    a crossover operation comes into play after generating the donor vector through
    mutation. The final step of the algorithm calls for selection in order to determine
    whether the target vector survives to the next generation [196]. The main stages
    of the DE algorithm are illustrated in Fig. 11. However, unlike traditional EAs,
    the DE algorithm is much simpler to implement, with only a few parameters to be
    set. Therefore, DE has drawn much attention and has been successfully applied
    in numerous domains of science and engineering (see [197], [198]). Artificial
    Immune System (AIS): AIS is a computational intelligence paradigm inspired by
    the biological immune system. It has been applied to a variety of optimization
    problems and has shown several attractive properties that allow EAs to avoid premature
    convergence and to enhance local search [199]. AIS is capable of recognizing and
    combating pathogens. Molecular patterns expressed on those pathogens are referred
    to as antigens. An antigen is any molecule that can be recognized by the immune
    system and is capable of provoking the immune response. This immune response is
    specific to each antigen. The cells called lymphocytes have a vital role in the
    immune system. There are two types of lymphocytes: B cells and T cells. When an
    antigen is detected, B cells that best recognize the antigen, will proliferate
    by cloning. Some of these new cloned cells will differentiate into plasma cells,
    which are the most active antibody secretors. These cloning and mutation processes
    are termed the clonal selection principle [200], which is one of the inspiring
    methodologies employed in AIS for solving optimization problems. Based on the
    clonal selection principle, an algorithm is developed, where various immune system
    aspects are taken into account, such as the maintenance of the memory cells, selection
    and cloning of the most stimulated cells, death of non-stimulated cells, re-selection
    of the clones with higher affinity, as well as the generation and maintenance
    of diversity. The steps of the AIS are provided in form of pseudocode in Table
    III. Similar to the computational frameworks of EA, AIS can be readily incorporated
    into the evolutionary optimization process and particularly, AIS are often exploited
    in evolutionary techniques devised for MOO to avoid premature convergence. On
    the other hand, the main distinction between the field of AIS and GAs is the nature
    of population development [201]. Specifically, the population of GAs is evolved
    using crossover and mutation operations. However, in the AIS, similar to evolutionary
    strategies where reproduction is a cloning, each child produced by a cell is an
    exact copy of its parent. Both algorithms then use mutation to alter the progeny
    of the cells and introduce further genetic variations. Imperialist Competitive
    Algorithm imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA): Inspired by the socio-political
    evolution process of imperialism and imperialistic competition, ICA was originally
    proposed by Atashpaz-Gargari and Lucas [202]. Similar to other EAs, ICA starts
    with an initial population, with each of them termed a country. The countries
    can be viewed as population individuals and are basically divided into two groups
    based on their power, i.e., imperialists (countries with the least cost function
    value) and colonies. After forming initial empires, the colonies start moving
    toward their relevant imperialist. This movement is a simple manifestation of
    the assimilation policy, which is pursued by some of the imperialists and results
    in improvements of the socio-political characteristics, such as culture, language
    and economical policy, in the colonies. Then, the imperialistic competition starts
    among all the empires. The imperialistic competition will gradually result in
    an increase of the power of stronger empires and a decrease in the power of weaker
    ones. In this process, weak empires will lose their colonies and eventually collapse.
    In the long run, ICA converges to a state where only a single powerful empire
    exists in the world and all the other countries are colonies of that empire.3
    In this state, the best solution of the optimization problem is given when all
    colonies and the corresponding imperialist have the same cost. TABLE III Pseudocode
    of Artificial Immune System Fig. 10. Simplified flow-chart of a GA. Show All Fig.
    11. Simplified illustration of a DE algorithm. Show All ICA has been successfully
    applied in numerous single-objective optimization problems [203], [204], where
    most results indicate that it is superior to the GA in terms of both its accuracy
    and convergence rate. The basic structure of the multi-objective imperialist competitive
    algorithm multi-objective imperialist competitive algorithm (MOICA) is the same
    as that of the ICA. However, new methods are developed to determine the imperialist
    countries, to define the power of the imperialist countries, and to calculate
    the total power of empires for imperialistic competition. Selecting imperialists
    (best countries) from a set of Pareto-optimal solutions impacts both the coverage
    and the diversity of solutions. This impact is more significant when the optimization
    problem has a high number of objectives. A novel MOICA was proposed in [157] for
    handling node deployment, where both the fast non-dominated sorting and the Sigma
    method were employed for selecting the best countries as imperialists. b) Swarm
    intelligence optimization algorithms (SIOAs): Swarm intelligence constitutes a
    branch of artificial intelligence artificial intelligence (AI), and it exploits
    the collective behavior of self-organized, decentralized systems that rely on
    a social structure, such as bird flocks, ant colonies and fish schools. These
    systems consist of low-intelligence interacting agents organized in small societies
    (also referred to as swarms), exhibiting traits of intelligence, such as the ability
    of reacting to environmental threats and the decision making capacities. Swarm
    intelligence has been utilized in the global optimization framework of controlling
    robotic swarms in [44]. Three main SIOAs have been developed, namely, ACO [24],
    PSO [205] and artificial bee colony artificial bee colony (ABC) [206]. Ant Colony
    Optimization (ACO): ACO was inspired by the foraging behavior of some ant species.
    These ants deposit pheromones on the ground in order to mark their nest-to-food
    paths that should be followed by other members of the colony. Additionally, they
    also deposit a different type of pheromone to mark dangerous paths for the others
    to avoid any threat. The ACO algorithm is capable of solving discrete/combinatorial
    optimization problems in various engineering domains. It was initially proposed
    by Dorigo et al. [23], [207] and has since been widely researched and diversified
    to solve a class of numerical problems. To illuminate the basic principle of ACO,
    let us consider the paths A and B of Fig. 12 between a nest and a food source
    as an example [40]. Furthermore, let us denote by n A(t) and n B (t) the number
    of ants along the paths A and B at the time step t , respectively, and by P A
    and P B the probability of choosing path A and path B , respectively. Then, the
    probability of an ant choosing path A at the time step t+1 is given by P A (t+1)=
    [c+ n A (t)] α [c+ n A (t)] α + [c+ n B (t)] α =1− P B (t+1), (16) View Source
    where c is the degree of attraction of a hitherto unexplored branch and α ( α≥0
    ) is the bias towards using pheromone deposits in the decision process. An ant
    chooses between the path A or path B using the following decision rule: if U(0,1)≤
    P A (t+1) then choose path A , otherwise choose path B . Here, U is a random number
    having a uniform distribution in the range of [0, 1]. ACO performs well in the
    dynamic and distributed routing problems of WSNs. Particle Swarm Optimization
    (PSO): Similar to the underlying philosophy of other swarm intelligence approaches,
    PSO aims for mimicking the social behavior of a flock of birds. It consists of
    a swarm of s candidate solutions, termed particles, which explore an n -dimensional
    hyperspace in search of the global solution. In PSO, the particles regulate their
    flying directions based both on their own flying experience and on their neighbors’
    flying experience [208]. After several improvements conceived by researchers,
    PSO became an often-used population-based optimizer, which is capable of solving
    stochastic nonlinear optimization problems at an affordable complexity. The position
    of the i th particle is represented as X i,d , while its velocity is represented
    as V i,d . Each particle is evaluated through an objective function f( x 1 , x
    2 ,…, x n ) , where we have f :  R n ⟶R . The cost (fitness) of a particle close
    to the global solution is lower (higher) than that of a particle being farther
    away. The best position of particle i is denoted as P i,d . Then, the particles
    are manipulated according to the following two equations [208]: V i,d (t+1)= X
    i,d (t+1)= w V i,d (t)+ λ 1 r 1 (t)[ P i,d (t)− X i (t)] + λ 2 r 2 (t)[ P d (t)−
    X i (t)], X i,d (t)+ V i,d (t+1), (17) (18) View Source where we have 1≤i≤s and
    1≤d≤n . Additionally, λ 1 and λ 2 are constants, w is the so-called inertia weight,
    while P d is the position of the best particle. Still referring to (17), r 1 (t)
    and r 2 (t) are random numbers uniformly distributed in [0, 1]. In the t th iteration,
    the velocity V and the position X are updated using (17) and (18). The update
    process is iteratively repeated until either an acceptable P d is achieved or
    a fixed number of iterations t max is reached. The general framework of the multi-objective
    PSO is shown in Fig. 13, which includes some key operations, such as the maintenance
    of the archive, global optimum selection, as well as the velocity and position
    update [209]. More explicitly, the particle population relies on an archive for
    storing the Pareto-optimal solutions during the iterative process and for selecting
    the global optimum from these solutions. This is the key point in which the multi-objective
    PSO is different from the traditional single-objective optimization. The employment
    of the PSO as a stochastic global optimization algorithm in the MOP of WSNs is
    relatively new and hence there is a paucity of contributions. A multi-objective
    routing model based on ACO was proposed in [24], which optimizes the network’s
    delay, energy consumption and data packet loss rate. This novel method has been
    shown to be capable of adapting to different service requirements. Rani and Devarajan
    [115] developed a MOO model based on PSO and fuzzy logic fuzzy logic (FL) for
    sensor node deployment, aiming for maximizing the network’s coverage, connectivity
    and lifetime. They have shown that the technique provides efficient and accurate
    decisions for node deployment in conjunction with low estimation errors. Artificial
    Bee Colony (ABC): The ABC algorithm was first introduced by Karaboga and Basturk
    [206], and it was derived from the behavior of honey bees in nature. Since the
    structure of the algorithm is simple, it has been widely used for solving optimization
    problems. In the ABC model, the position of a food source represents a possible
    solution to the optimization problem and the amount of nectar in a food source
    corresponds to the quality (fitness) of the associated solution. The honey bee
    swarm consists of three groups of bees, namely the employed bees, onlookers and
    scouts. Correspondingly, the ABC algorithm has three phases [151], [210]. It is
    assumed that there is only a single artificial employed bee for each food source.
    Therefore, the number of employed bees in the honey bee swarm is equal to the
    number of food sources around the hive. Employed bee phase: At the first step,
    the randomly distributed initial food sources are produced for all employed bees.
    Then, each employed bee flies to a food source in its memory and determines a
    neighbor source, whose nectar amount is then evaluated. If the nectar amount of
    the neighbor source is higher than that of the previous source, the employed bee
    memorizes the new source position and forgets the old one. Otherwise, it keeps
    the position of the one in its memory. In other words, an employed bee updates
    the source position in its memory if it discovers a better food source. Onlooker
    phase: After all employed bees have completed the above food-source search process,
    they return to the hive to share the position and nectar amount of their individual
    food source with the onlookers. Each onlooker evaluates the nectar information
    taken from all employed bees and then chooses a food source depending on the nectar
    amounts of these sources. Therefore, food sources with high nectar content attract
    a large number of onlooker. Similar to the case of the employed bee, an onlooker
    then updates the source position in its memory by checking the nectar amount of
    a neighbor source. If its nectar amount is higher than that of the previous one,
    the onlooker memorizes the new position and forgets the old one. Scout phase:
    As a result, the sources abandoned have been determined, and the employed bee
    whose food source has been abandoned becomes a scout. New sources are randomly
    produced by scouts, without considering any experience, in order to replace the
    abandoned ones. Fig. 12. A stylized optimization process of ACO. Show All Fig.
    13. The general framework of the multi-objective PSO. Show All The above foraging
    behavior can be simulated using an ABC algorithm to determine the globally optimal
    solutions of optimization problems, as shown in [210]. c) Artificial neural network
    artificial neural network (ANN): ANN is a sophisticated computational intelligence
    structure inspired by the neurobiological system. It is used for estimating or
    approximating functions that depend on a large number of inputs that are generally
    unknown [211]. The biological neuron consists of dendrites, an axon and a cell
    body called soma. Each neuron may form a connection to another neuron via the
    synapse, which is a junction of an axon and a dendrite. The so-called postsynaptic
    potentials generated within the synapses are received via dendrites and chemically
    transformed within the soma. The axon carries away the action potential sent out
    by the soma to the next synapse. The analogy of biological neurons to artificial
    neurons is explained as follows. In artificial neurons, the incoming signals are
    weighted, which is analogous to what is done in synapses. Then, the weighted signals
    are further processed. The function f(x) is basically a weighted-sum of all inputs,
    while the output corresponds to the axon. In the context of WSNs, the sensor node
    converts the physical signal to an electronic signal, which is filtered or preprocessed
    using weighting (analogous to synapse). The subsequent processing within the processor
    is represented by the particular function h(x) , which corresponds to the chemical
    processing accomplished by the soma. Eventually, a sensor node sends out the modified
    sensor reading via the radio link. This strong analogy shows that the sensor node
    itself can be viewed as a biological or artificial neuron [212]. Therefore, we
    can readily extend our horizon and regard some WSNs as large-scale ANNs. Having
    said this, we are fully aware of the inherent dangers of analogies. The shift
    procedure from a biological neuron to a sensor node is portrayed in Fig. 14. Fig.
    14. The shift procedure from a biological neuron to a sensor node. Show All The
    entire sensor network can be modelled from an ANN perspective. For each sensor
    node within the sensor network, we can also rely on ANNs to decide the output
    action. Thus, it is possible to envision a two-layer ANN architecture for WSNs.
    d) Reinforcement learning reinforcement learning (RL): RL is a powerful mathematical
    framework that enables an agent (sensor node) to learn via interacting with its
    environment and to model a problem as a Markov decision process Markov decision
    process (MDP) [213]. The most well-known RL technique is Q -learning. The visualization
    of Q -learning is shown in Fig. 15, where an agent (sensor node) regularly updates
    its achieved reward based on the action taken at a given state. The future total
    reward (i.e., the Q -value) of performing an action a t at state s t is calculated
    using Q( s t+1 , a t+1 )=Q( s t , a t )+λ⋅[r( s t , a t )−Q( s t , a t )], (19)
    View Source where r( s t , a t ) represents the immediate reward of performing
    an action a t at state s t , and 0≤λ≤1 is the learning rate that determines how
    fast learning takes place. This algorithm can be easily implemented in a distributed
    architecture like WSNs, where each node seeks to choose specific actions that
    are expected to maximize its long-term rewards. For instance, Q -learning has
    been efficiently used in WSN routing problems [214], [215]. Fig. 15. Visualization
    of the Q -learning. Show All 3) Other Advanced Optimization Techniques: There
    are several other advanced optimization methods capable of achieving appealing
    performance trade-offs, such as fuzzy logic, game theory, and so forth. Although
    these methods are less frequently used in WSNs, the trade-offs achieved by them
    can be compelling. a) Fuzzy logic (FL): FL as a mathematical model was introduced
    by Zadeh [216]. It is a useful technique that can use human language to describe
    inputs as well as outputs, and it provides a simple method of achieving a conclusion
    based on imprecise or ambiguous input information. Since then, the applications
    of FL have been expanding, especially in adaptive control systems and system identification.
    A fuzzy system comprises four basic elements, namely, fuzzifier, inference engine,
    fuzzy rule base and defuzzifier [217], as shown in Fig. 16. The fuzzifier converts
    the inputs into fuzzy variables using membership functions, each of which represents
    for each object a degree of belongingness to a specific fuzzy set. Fuzzy variables
    provide a mapping of objects to a continuous membership value, which is normalized
    in the range [0, 1]. Each fuzzy set is represented by a linguistic term, such
    as “high”, “low”, “medium”, “small” and “large”. The inference engine is often
    a collection of if-then rules, by which the fuzzy input is mapped to a linguistic
    output variable according to the fuzzy rule base. This output variable has to
    be converted into a crisp output by the defuzzification process, such as the centroid
    method, averaging method, root sum squared method, and mean of maximum. Fig. 16.
    Typical structure of the FL. Show All Low-complexity FL is suitable for WSNs,
    and various areas of WSNs have been investigated using the rules of FL. For example,
    the FL-based routing path search for a maximum network lifetime and minimum delay
    was investigated in [37], where a fuzzy membership function (edge-weight function)
    was used for formulating a multi-objective cost aggregation function, which may
    reflect the effects of all the objectives collectively as a scalar value. As a
    beneficial result, it offers a beneficial trade-off between maximizing the network
    lifetime and minimizing the source-to-sink delay. b) Game theory: Game theory
    is a powerful mathematical tool that characterizes the phenomenon of conflict
    and cooperation between rational decision-makers [218]. Since game theory introduces
    a series of successful mechanisms, such as the pricing mechanism, it has achieved
    a great success in the design of WSNs. In particular, the pricing schemes can
    guide the nodes’ behaviors towards an efficient Nash equilibrium by introducing
    a certain degree of coordination into a non-cooperative game. In [219], a Nash
    equilibrium-based game model, a cooperative coalition game model and an evolutionary
    game model were used for solving MOPs, respectively. Indeed, a number of MOO approaches
    have appeared in the literature over the past decade. For the sake of clarity,
    some representative MOO algorithms are summarized in Table IV, including the MOGA

    SECTION V. Existing Literature on Using MOO in WSNs The performance metrics presented
    in Section II entail conflicting objectives, e.g., the coverage versus lifetime,
    and the energy consumption versus delay, etc. Therefore, it is necessary to balance
    multiple trade-offs efficiently by employing MOO techniques. In this section,
    we present an overview of the existing contributions that are focused on using
    MOO in the context of WSNs. A. Coverage-Versus-Lifetime Trade-Offs The reasons
    why the coverage and the lifetime of a WSN constitute conflicting objectives are
    given as follows. Optimizing the coverage represents the maximization of the proportion
    of the adequately monitored area relative to the total area. From another perspective,
    the coverage objective desires having a “spread-out” network layout, where sensor
    nodes are as far apart from each other as possible in order to minimize the overlap
    between their sensing disks. This results in a large number of relay transmissions
    taking place at the intermediate sensor nodes, especially for those communicating
    directly with the base station. Hence, the depletion of energy at these sensor
    nodes will happen sooner, and the network lifetime will then be shorter. On the
    other hand, in order to get a longer lifetime, all the sensor nodes tend to communicate
    using as few hops as possible (or even communicate directly) with the base station,
    so that their energy is used for their own data transmission as much as possible.
    This implies a clustered configuration around the base station, with substantial
    overlap between sensing disks and yielding a poor coverage performance. Table
    VI shows a summary of the existing major contributions on coverage-versus-lifetime
    trade-offs. More specifically, Jourdan and De Weck [112] conceived a MOGA for
    optimizing the layout of WSNs, i.e., the locations of nodes, by considering both
    the sensing and communication connectivity requirements. The algorithm aims for
    maximizing both the coverage and the lifetime of the network, hence yielding a
    PF from which the network can dynamically choose its most desired solution. Konstantinidis
    et al. [11], [247] considered optimizing both the locations and the transmit power
    levels of sensor nodes, i.e., the so-called deployment and power assignment problem
    deployment and power assignment problem (DPAP) for maximizing the network coverage
    and lifetime. Using the MOEA/D of [228], the multi-objective DPAP was decomposed
    into a set of scalar subproblems in [11] and [247]. By extending [11], the authors
    further addressed the K -connected DPAP in WSNs for maximizing the network coverage
    and lifetime under the K -connectivity constraints by using, again, the MOEA/D
    approach [246]. Furthermore, Rani and Devarajan [115] proposed a multi-objective
    PSO and FL based optimization model for sensor node deployment, which is based
    on the maximization of the network’s coverage, connectivity and lifetime. Choi
    and Das [91] proposed a randomized k -disjoint-sensor selection scheme that traded
    off the coverage against the data reporting latency, while enhancing the attainable
    energy efficiency depending on the specific type of applications. Additionally,
    a CIVA was proposed for mobile WSNs in [116] to strike an improved trade-off between
    coverage and lifetime. The CIVA comprises two phases: in the first phase, CIVA
    controls the locations and the sensing ranges of mobile nodes to maximize the
    coverage; in the second phase, CIVA adjusts the transmit power of active/sleep
    mobile nodes to minimize the number of active nodes. TABLE VI Coverage-Versus-Lifetime
    Trade-Offs B. Energy-Versus-Latency Trade-Offs Indeed, minimizing the energy consumption
    requires transmitting the sensed data over reduced distance in each hop. By contrast,
    minimizing the delay requires minimizing the number of intermediate forwarders
    between a source and the sink. This goal may be achieved by maximizing the distance
    between any pair of consecutive forwarders. Furthermore, a reduced search space
    for candidate forwarders yields an unbalanced distribution of the data forwarding
    load among nodes, thus causing a non-uniform depletion of their available energy
    [249], [250]. Therefore, it is necessary to jointly optimize the network’s energy
    consumption and delay. The energy-versus-latency trade-off related issues have
    been lavishly documented in various specific WSN scenarios [92], [135]–[147],
    [248], [249], [251]–[253]. Table VII shows a summary of the existing major contributions
    to energy-consumption-versus-latency trade-offs. More specifically, Schurgers
    et al. [248] studied the energy-latency-density trade-off of WSNs by proposing
    a topology-and-energy-management scheme, which promptly wakes up nodes from a
    deep sleep state without the need for an ultra-low-power radio. As a result, the
    WSN designer can trade the energy efficiency of this sleep state against the latency
    associated with waking up the node. In addition, the authors integrated their
    scheme with the classic geographical adaptive fidelity algorithm to exploit excess
    network density. Zorzi and Rao [135] developed the energy-versus-latency trade-offs
    based on the geographical location of the nodes, and proposed a collision avoidance
    protocol. Then, Yang and Vaidya [136] designed a node wake-up scheme, namely the
    so-called “pipelined tone wake-up”, which struck a balance between the energy
    savings and the end-to-end delay. This node wake-up scheme was based on an asynchronous
    wake-up pipeline, where the wake-up procedures overlapped with the packet transmissions.
    It used wake-up tones that allowed a high duty-cycle ratio without imposing a
    large wake-up delay at each hop. Yu et al. [137] studied the energy-versus-latency
    trade-offs using the so-called data aggregation tree4 in a real-time scenario
    with a specified latency constraint, and developed algorithms for minimizing the
    overall energy dissipation of the sensor nodes. Yu and Prasanna [138] presented
    the first work on energy-balanced task allocation in WSNs where both the time
    and the energy costs of the computation and communication activities were considered.
    They explored the energy-versus-latency trade-offs of communication activities
    over the data aggregation tree for modelling the packet flow in multiple-source
    single-sink communications. A numerical algorithm was conceived for obtaining
    the exact optimal solution, and a dynamic programming based approximation algorithm
    was also proposed. TABLE VII Energy-Versus-Latency Trade-Offs Borghini et al.
    [140] considered the problem of analyzing the trade-offs between the energy efficiency
    and the delay for large and dense WSNs. They used an analytical model, which facilitated
    the comparison of the trade-offs in scenarios employing different deployment-phase
    protocols, and presented a pair of novel algorithms (i.e., latency-oriented/energy-oriented
    data aggregation tree construction algorithms), which outperformed the existing
    ones. Ammari and Das [92] investigated the energy-versus-delay trade-offs of a
    WSN by varying the transmission range. Huynh and Hong [141] proposed a cluster-and-chain
    based energy-delay-efficient routing protocol for WSNs, where each k -hop cluster
    uses both cluster-based and chain-based5 approaches. Each communication round
    consisted of a cluster- and chain-formation phase, as well as a data transmission
    phase. Furthermore, Moscibroda et al. [142] analyzed the energy-efficiency versus
    propagation-delay trade-offs by defining a formal model, with a particular emphasis
    on the deployment phase. Specifically, the authors presented two new algorithms,
    one of which is entirely unstructured, while the other is based on clustering.
    Leow and Pishro-Nik [143] provided an asymptotic analysis of the transmission
    delay and energy dissipation of a 2D multi-state WSN, where the sensor nodes were
    equally spaced in a line or in a square grid. They also discussed the transmission
    delay-energy trade-offs for the case where the energy transmitted attenuates according
    to the inverse second-power pathloss law. As a further development, Mao et al.
    [144] presented a new MOO framework conceived for slot scheduling in many-to-one
    sensor networks. Two specific optimization objectives were considered in [144].
    The first one was to minimize the energy consumption, while the other was to shorten
    the total delay. Minhas et al. [145] proposed a routing algorithm based on FL
    for finding a path that offers a desirable balance between the maximum lifetime
    (associated with energy consumption) and the minimum source-to-sink delay. In
    the same spirit, Cheng and Leung [146] proposed a MOO framework for cluster-based
    WSNs. The framework was designed to strike attractive trade-offs between the energy
    consumption and the duration of the data collection process. The effectiveness
    of this framework was evaluated with a pair of energy-aware clustering algorithms.
    However, clustering techniques typically impose bottlenecks during the data collection
    process and cause extra delays. Li et al. [147] investigated the trade-offs of
    data aggregation in WSNs in the presence of interference, and they conceived an
    energy-efficient minimum-latency data aggregation algorithm, which achieved the
    asymptotically minimal aggregation latency as well as the desired energy-versus-latency
    trade-offs. Ammari [249], [250] proposed a data forwarding protocol for finding
    the best trade-offs among minimum energy consumption, uniform battery power depletion
    and minimum delay, which relied on slicing the communication range of the nodes
    into concentric circular bands. He also conceived a novel approach termed the
    weighted scale-uniform-unit sum, which was used by the source nodes for solving
    this MOP. Shahraki et al. [251] defined a new cost function and developed a new
    intra-cluster routing scheme for balancing the attainable cluster lifetime against
    the end-to-end delay between the cluster members and the cluster head. Yao et
    al. [139] developed a data collection protocol for balancing the trade-offs between
    energy-efficiency (associated with lifetime) and delay in heterogeneous WSNs,
    in which a centralized heuristic was devised for reducing the computational cost
    and a distributed heuristic was conceived for making the algorithm scalable. Both
    heuristics were inspired by recent techniques developed for the so-called “open
    vehicle routing problems with time deadlines”, which is mainly studied in operational
    research. Dong et al. [253] investigated the trade-offs between energy consumption
    and transport latency minimization under certain reliability constraints in WSNs.
    Based on the analysis strategy conceived for satisfying sensing application requirements,
    they proposed a data gathering protocol named broadcasting combined with multi-NACK/ACK
    to strike attractive trade-offs. Suto et al. [252] proposed an energy-efficient
    and delay-aware wireless computing system for industrial WSNs based smart factories.
    C. Lifetime-Versus-Application-Performance Trade-Offs In certain sensor network
    applications, the specific application’s performance strongly depends on the amount
    of data gathered from each sensor node in the network. However, higher data rates
    result in increased sensing and communication costs across the sensor network,
    as well as in escalating energy consumption and reduced network lifetime [255].
    Thus, there is an inherent trade-offs between the network lifetime and a specific
    application’s performance, while the latter is often correlated to the rate at
    which the application can reliably send its data across sensor networks. This
    problem has been extensively studied in recent years. Table VIII shows a summary
    of the existing major contributions to lifetime-versus-application-performance
    trade-offs. Nama et al. [128] investigated the trade-offs between network utility
    and network lifetime maximization in a WSN. They proposed a general cross-layer
    optimization-based framework that took into account the associated radio resource
    allocation issues and designed a distributed algorithm by relying on the so-called
    dual decomposition [258] of the original problem. Similarly, Zhu et al. [129]
    studied the trade-off between network lifetime (associated with energy conservation)
    and rate-allocation by using the gradient projection [259] method. However, no
    detailed information was provided about how to distributively implement this algorithm
    in the interest of solving the lifetime-versus-rate-allocation trade-off problem
    in each layer of the open systems interconnection open systems interconnection
    (OSI) model. Zhu et al. [129] also studied the trade-offs between the network’s
    lifetime and fair rate allocation in the context of multi-path routing sensor
    networks [107], where they formulated an MOP subject to a set of convex constraints.
    They invoked the NUM framework [104] and introduced an adjustable factor to guarantee
    rate-allocation fairness amongst all sensor nodes. Chen et al. [74] have addressed
    the utility-versus-lifetime trade-offs with the aid of an optimal flow control
    in a practical WSN. They formulated the problem as a non-linear MOP subjected
    to certain constraints and introduced auxiliary variables for decoupling the individual
    objectives embedded in the scalar-valued multi-objective function. The concept
    of inconsistent coordination price6 was first introduced for balancing the energy
    consumption of the sensor node and the gradient projection method [259] was adopted
    for designing a distributed algorithm that is capable of finding the optimal rate
    allocation. He et al. [130] focused on the rate allocation problem in multi-path
    routing WSNs subjected to time-varying channel conditions with two objectives
    in mind: maximizing the aggregate utility and prolonging the network’s lifetime,
    respectively. They decomposed the optimization problem with the aid of the classic
    Lagrange dual decomposition [258] and adopted the stochastic quasi-gradient algorithm
    [259] for solving the primal-dual problem in a distributed way. Luo et al. [131]
    have also carried out a systematic study of the trade-offs between the network’s
    throughput and lifetime for WSNs having stationary nodes, where the link transmissions
    were carefully coordinated to avoid interference. The authors used a realistic
    interference model based on the SINR for modeling the conflicts to avoid, when
    scheduling the wireless links’ transmissions. Their analytical and numerical results
    provided novel insights into the interplay among the throughput, lifetime and
    transmit power. Xie et al. [256] adopted a specific fairness concept to analyze
    the performance degradation experienced in multirate WSNs and then took into account
    the trade-offs between the throughput attained and energy consumption imposed.
    Eventually, a multirate-supportive MAC protocol was proposed for balancing the
    throughput versus energy consumption. Liao and Zhang [257] generalized the NUM
    model to a multiutility framework using MOO and applied this framework to trade
    off the network utility against the lifetime in WSNs. An extended Lagrange duality
    method was proposed, which is capable of converging to a selected Pareto-optimal
    solution. TABLE VIII Lifetime-Versus-Application-Performance Trade-Offs D. Trade-Offs
    Related to the Number of Nodes Intuitively, deploying more sensor nodes would
    improve the overall event-detection probability of the system, albeit at the expense
    of increasing both the energy consumption and deployment cost. This indicates
    the trade-offs among multiple conflicting objectives related to the number of
    nodes. Table IX portrays a number of existing contributions to these trade-offs
    at a glance. TABLE IX Trade-Offs Related to the Number of Sensor Nodes To elaborate,
    in [98], a pair of multi-objective metaheuristic algorithms (MOEA and NSGA-II)
    have been used for solving the WSN’s layout problem, determining both the number
    and the locations of the sensor nodes that formed a WSN, so that reliable full
    coverage of a given sensor field was achieved. Specifically, the authors focused
    their attention on the energy efficiency of the network as well as on the number
    of nodes, while the coverage obtained by the network was considered as a constraint.
    Jia et al. [101] proposed a new coverage control scheme based on an improved NSGA-II
    using an adjustable sensing radius. The objective was to find the most appropriate
    balance among the conflicting factors of the maximum coverage rate, the least
    energy consumption, as well as the minimum number of active nodes. As a further
    development, Woehrle et al. [99] have invoked the MOEA to identify attractive
    trade-offs between low deployment-cost and highly reliable wireless transmission,
    i.e., to minimize transmission failure probability at as low deployment-cost as
    possible. Cheng and Tse [158] investigated the trade-offs between the maximum
    affordable number of nodes and the minimum duration of the data collection process
    in a delay-aware data collection network by exploiting the concepts of Pareto-optimality.
    Rajagopalan [102] employed the evolutionary multi-objective crowding algorithm
    evolutionary multi-objective crowding algorithm (EMOCA) for solving the sensor
    placement problem. There were three objectives: maximizing the probability of
    global target detection, minimizing the total energy dissipated by the sensor
    network and minimizing the total number of nodes to be deployed. The MOO approach
    simultaneously optimized the three objectives and obtained multiple Pareto-optimal
    solutions. Aitsaadi et al. [103] considered a multi-objective combinatorial optimization
    problem, where a new multi-objective deployment algorithm multi-objective deployment
    algorithm (MODA) was proposed. The optimization objective was to reduce the number
    of deployed nodes, to satisfy the target quality of monitoring, to guarantee the
    network’s connectivity and finally to maximize the network’s lifetime. Berre et
    al. [100] formulated an MOP of maximizing three objectives. The first objective
    was the maximization of the coverage area in real time, the second objective was
    the maximization of the network’s lifetime depending on the coverage, and the
    final objective was to minimize the number of deployed nodes subject to the connectivity
    on the network. The solutions found by three different algorithms (i.e., NSGA-II,
    SPEA2 and ACO) were compared. Recently, a novel MOICA was proposed for sensor
    node deployment in [157], where the minimization of the number of active sensor
    nodes and the maximization of the coverage were jointly considered. The numerical
    results of [157] demonstrated that the MOICA was capable of providing more-accurate
    solutions at a lower computational complexity than the existing methods. E. Reliability-Related
    Trade-Offs The main objective behind the deployment of WSNs is to capture and
    transmit pictures, videos and other important data to the sink reliably. These
    applications require us to maintain a strict QoS guarantee [260], [261]. However,
    maintaining the QoS during routing hinges on numerous factors, such as the energy
    status of the nodes in the network, the delay, the bandwidth and the reliability
    requirements. Hence, sophisticated routing protocols have to take into considerations
    multiple potentially conflicting factors, which makes the problem even more challenging.
    Table X shows a summary of the existing contributions to reliability-related trade-offs.
    To expound a little further, Miller et al. [152] studied the trade-offs amongst
    the energy, latency and reliability. They conceived a meritorious probability-based
    broadcast forwarding scheme for minimizing both the energy usage and the latency,
    whilst improving the reliability. EkbataniFard et al. [262] have developed a QoS-based
    energy-aware routing protocol for a two-tier WSN from the perspective of MOO.
    The proposed protocol utilizing the NSGA-II efficiently optimized the QoS parameters
    formulated in terms of the reliability and end-to-end delay, whilst reducing the
    average power consumption of the nodes, which substantially extended the lifetime
    of the network. TABLE X Reliability-Related Trade-Offs A high data rate can be
    maintained by a link at the expense of a reduced delivery reliability, and/or
    increased energy consumption, which in turn reduces the network lifetime. Again,
    there is an inherent trade-off among the data rate, reliability and network lifetime.
    Although numerous treatises have extensively studied the data rate, reliability
    and network lifetime in isolation, only a few of them have considered the trade-offs
    among them. Xu et al. [263] jointly considered the rate, reliability and network
    lifetime in a rigorous framework. They addressed the optimal rate-reliability-lifetime
    trade-offs under a specific link capacity constraint, reliability constraint and
    energy constraint. However, the optimization formulation was neither separable
    nor convex. Hence, a series of transformations have been invoked and then a separable
    and convex problem was derived. Finally, an efficient distributed subgradient
    dual decomposition subgradient dual decomposition (SDD) algorithm was developed
    for striking an appealing trade-off. Lu et al. [8] formulated WSN routing as a
    fuzzy random multi-objective optimization fuzzy random multi-objective optimization
    (FRMOO) problem, which simultaneously considered the multiple objectives of delay,
    reliability, energy, delay jitter, the interference aspects and the energy balance
    of a path. They introduced a fuzzy random variable for characterizing the link
    delay, link reliability and the nodes’ residual energy, with the objective of
    accurately reflecting the random characteristics in WSN routing. Eventually, a
    hybrid routing algorithm based on FRMOO was designed. Razzaque et al. [264] proposed
    a QoS-aware routing protocol for body sensor networks, in which a lexicographic
    optimization approach was used for trading off the QoS requirements and energy
    costs. Lanza-Gutierrez and Gomez-Pulido [151] considered the deployment of energy
    harvesting relay nodes for resolving the conflict among average energy cost, average
    sensing area and network reliability. Two multi-objective metaheuristics, i.e.,
    the ABC algorithm and the firefly algorithm firefly algorithm (FA), were applied
    for solving the problem, respectively. Ansari et al. [265] considered the energy
    consumption, reliability, coverage intensity and end-to-end delay trade-offs based
    on the location of the nodes, and a new multi-mode switching protocol was adopted.
    Liu et al. [266] proposed an energy-efficient cooperative spectrum sensing scheme
    for a cognitive WSN by taking into account the energy consumption and the spectrum
    sensing performance, both of which were jointly optimized using fast MODE. Xiao
    et al. [267] proposed a time-sensitive utility model for low-duty-cycle WSNs,
    where they simultaneously took into account the transmission cost, utility, reliability
    and latency. Moreover, they designed two optimal time-sensitive utility-based
    routing algorithms to strike the most appropriate balance among these four metrics.
    F. Trade-Offs Related to Other Metrics As mentioned in Section I, in practice
    it is unfeasible to jointly satisfy the optimum of several potentially conflicting
    objectives. To circumvent this dilemma, the concept of Pareto-optimal has been
    widely invoked, resulting in a PF generated by all Pareto-optimal solutions of
    a MOP, where it is impossible to improve any of the objectives without degrading
    one or several of the others. Therefore, according to the needs of decision makers
    and the actual situation of the WSN considered, efficient routing algorithms are
    required for finding a satisfactory path in WSNs. Table XI summarizes other metrics
    and their trade-offs. As seen in Table XI, Lozano-Garzon and Donoso [268] proposed
    a distributed N -to-1 multi-path routing scheme for a WSN by taking into account
    the number of hops, the energy consumption and the free space loss,7 and these
    three objectives were optimized by the SPEA2 [220] with the aim of using the energy
    efficiently in the network, whilst reducing the packet-loss rate. Bandyopadhyay
    et al. [269] proposed a transmission scheduling scheme using a collision-free
    protocol for gathering sensor data. Moreover, they studied diverse trade-offs
    amongst the energy usage, the sensor density, and the temporal/spatial sampling
    rates. As a further advance, Rajagopalan et al. [84] developed a MOO framework
    for mobile agent routing in WSNs. The multi-objective evolutionary optimization
    algorithms EMOCA and NSGA-II were employed to find the mobile agents’ routes,
    aiming for maximizing the total detected signal energy, while minimizing the energy
    consumption by reducing the hop-length. Wei and Zhi [24] established a multi-objective
    routing model that relies on the delay, energy consumption, data packet-loss rate
    as its optimization objectives. By adjusting the specific weight of each function,
    the algorithm adapts well to various services having different energy cost, delay
    and packet-loss rate requirements. This protocol was implemented using an advanced
    ACO algorithm that is based on a cloud model.8 TABLE XI Trade-Offs Related to
    Other Metrics For a typical WSN, the accuracy of an application and the longevity
    of the network are inversely proportional to each other, which is partially due
    to the finite energy reserves of the nodes and owing to the desire for applications
    to have large volumes of fresh data to process. Adlakha et al. [166] created a
    four-dimensional design space based on four independent QoS parameters, namely
    the accuracy, delay, energy consumption and the node density. In order to achieve
    an improved accuracy or lifetime, various parameters of the individual techniques
    can be adjusted. The insights and relationships identified in [166] were not unique
    to mobility tracking applications, many potential applications of WSNs requiring
    a balance amongst the factors of energy consumption, node density, latency and
    accuracy may also benefit from exploiting the results and trends identified in
    [166]. For instance, the energy-density-latency-accuracy energy-density-latency-accuracy
    (EDLA) trade-offs have been studied in the context of WSNs in [167]. By contrast,
    Armenia et al. [110] introduced a Markov-based modeling of the random routing
    behavior for evaluating the trade-offs between location privacy and energy efficiency
    in a WSN. Notably, their approach used the information theoretic concept of privacy
    loss. Both the network security and lifetime have been studied by Liu et al. [111],
    where they proposed a three-phase routing scheme, which is termed security and
    energy-efficient disjoint routing. Based on the secret-sharing algorithm, this
    routing scheme dispersively and randomly delivered its source-information to the
    sink node, ensuring that the network security was maximized without degrading
    the lifetime of WSNs. As a further development, Tang et al. [270] proposed a geography-based
    cost-aware secure routing protocol to address the conflicting lifetime-versus-security
    trade-off issue in multi-hop WSNs. The design goal was achieved by controlling
    energy deployment balance and invoking a random walking routing strategy. Attea
    et al. [271] studied the MOP of how to optimally divide sensor nodes into multiple
    disjoint subsets so that two conflicting objectives, namely the network lifetime
    and coverage probability, can be jointly maximized. Each subset of sensors is
    required to completely cover a set of targets having known locations. Hence, they
    formulated a multi-objective disjoint set cover disjoint set cover (DSC) problem,
    which was tackled by MOEA/D and NSGA-II. Sengupta et al. [272] employed a novel
    heuristic algorithm, termed MOEA/D with fuzzy dominance multi-objective evolutionary
    algorithm based on decomposition with fuzzy dominance (MOEA/DFD), for finding
    the best trade-offs among coverage, energy consumption, lifetime and the number
    of nodes, while maintaining the connectivity between each sensor node and the
    sink node. Wang et al. [273] quantified the probabilistic performance trade-offs
    among the network lifetime, end-to-end communication delay and network throughput
    in real-time WSNs. A heuristic-based multiple-local-search technique was employed
    for finding the solutions. Inspired by the concept of potential field from the
    discipline of physics, Zhang et al. [274] designed a novel potential-based routing
    algorithm, known as the integrity and delay differentiated routing for WSNs. The
    objective was to improve the data fidelity for high-integrity applications and
    to reduce the end-to-end delay simultaneously. SECTION VI. Open Problems and Discussions
    Despite the increasing attention paid to the MOO of WSNs, this research area still
    has numerous open facets for future work, as discussed below. Most of the studies
    investigated the MOO of single-hop transmission, whereas only a limited amount
    of contributions, such as [275], paid attention to multi-hop WSNs. Clearly, multi-hop
    transmission in energy-limited WSNs is essential for conserving transmission energy
    and thus for prolonging the network’s lifetime. Therefore, it is promising to
    intensify the research of MOO in the context of multi-hop WSNs. Sensor nodes may
    move from one place to another as required by the application or may be displaced
    by objects (human, animals, etc ). Hence, the mobility of the nodes has a substantial
    impact on the network’s connectivity. For example, if a data packet is long and
    the node changes its current location during the packet’s forwarding, part of
    the data may be lost at the receiving node. Similarly, when a node selects a routing
    path but the nodes in the routing path change their locations, the connectivity
    between the source nodes and destination nodes will be affected. Therefore, the
    deployment of nodes in highly dynamic scenarios requires a deployment approach
    that equips the network with a self-organizing capability. Artificial potential
    field artificial potential field (APF) techniques9 have been applied to the problems
    of formation control and obstacle avoidance in multi-robot systems [277]. Since
    these problems are of similar nature to the deployment problem of sensor nodes,
    the APF techniques may also be used to devise a deployment approach for WSNs.
    Since WSNs are typically deployed in physically open and possibly hostile environments,
    they will be confronted with security attacks ranging from passive attacks, active
    attacks, and denial-of-service denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Therefore, their
    security is one of the imperative aspects in future research. Since the security
    may gravely affect the network performance, especially during the information
    exchange phase, designing a secure routing protocol for WSNs is a must. Most of
    the known routing algorithms assume that the nodes are static and rely on a single
    path. Once the routing is attacked, the network’s performance will be significantly
    degraded. Therefore, it is necessary to study multi-route protocols conceived
    for mobile-node based routing capable of satisfying the security and QoS requirements
    in any real-time application. The trade-offs between the security and QoS requirements
    will bring about further new challenges. Existing contributions often assume that
    the sensor networks are spread across a two-dimensional plane, but in practice
    they are indeed of three-dimensional three-dimensional (3D) nature. The extension
    of a 2D network into 3D is both interesting and challenging. In two-tier WSNs,
    multiple objectives have to be satisfied by the routing algorithms. Lu et al.
    [8] proposed a routing solution based on the fuzzy random expected value model
    and the standard deviation model of [278]10 to meet the requirements of different
    applications of the clustered network advocated. Since the fuzzy random expected
    value model may become inaccurate in uncertain environments, improved routing
    model based on MOO is necessitated. Moreover, due to the limitation of GAs, the
    distributed solving methods based on local information and on the decomposition
    theory are expected to be further investigated. Serious natural disasters, such
    as sandstorms, tsunamis, landslides etc, have routinely damaged the natural environment
    and inflicted the loss of human lives. Although WSNs provide a promising solution
    to realize real-time environment monitoring, numerous issues have to be resolved
    for their practical implementation. One of the major issues is how to effectively
    deploy WSNs to guarantee large-area sensing coverage and reliable communication
    connectivity in hostile propagation scenarios. In recent years, considering the
    similarity between multi-objective design and game theory, the latter has also
    been employed to solve multi-objective design problems. By analogy, m -objective
    designs can be regarded as m -player games. Chi and Liu [279] introduced game
    theory and the concept of co-evolution into GAs for the sake of solving the MOPs,
    which has been shown to perform well. In [219] a Nash-equilibrium based game model,
    a cooperative coalition game model and an evolutionary game model were used for
    solving MOP. Since EAs are capable of finding the global solution of MOPs with
    good robustness, while Nash games can be used for conflict resolution and Stackelberg
    games for hierarchical design, it is promising to solve MOPs of WSNs by combining
    a Nash game with EAs or combining a Stackelberg game with EAs. As an adaptive
    parameter control method based on sensitivity results, the Pascoletti-Serafini
    scalarization method [280] is a more general formulation relying on an unrestricted
    search direction and an auxiliary vector variable. It has been used for both linear
    and nonlinear MOPs [280]. Naturally, this method can also be applied to solve
    MOPs in WSNs, yielding approximate solutions of the problems considered. Indeed,
    for the MOP of multicell networks [281], the relationship between the parameters
    and the optimal solutions was elucidated by the Pascoletti-Serafini scalarization.
    The mutually interfering networks are ubiquitous, hence finding innovative cross-layer
    and cross-network solutions becomes essential. To this end, we believe that many
    hybrid computational intelligence algorithms which combine the benefits of two
    or more algorithms should be given careful attention, such as swarm-FL control,
    neuro-FL control, GA-PSO, GA-ANN, and neuro-immune systems, etc. Cognitive radio
    cognitive radio (CR) is an emerging wireless communication paradigm, in which
    the transceivers are capable of intelligently detecting in their vicinity which
    specific communication channels are in use and which are not. Then, they promptly
    switch to vacant channels while avoiding occupied ones. This is essentially a
    form of dynamic spectrum access dynamic spectrum access (DSA) [282], which may
    substantially improve the exploitation of the available wireless spectrum. Typically,
    a transceiver in CR may be capable of determining its geographic location, identifying
    and authorizing its users, sensing neighboring wireless devices, and automatically
    adjusting its transmission and reception parameters to allow more concurrent wireless
    communications in a given spectrum band at a specific location. Depending on which
    parts of spectrum are available for the operation of CR, we have CR operating
    either in licensed bands, or in unlicensed bands. On the other hand, WSNs often
    use the unlicensed ISM band for communications, but with the rapidly increasing
    demand of the Internet of Things Internet of Things (IoT) based applications (e.g.,
    healthcare and tele-medicine), the currently available ISM band may become insufficient,
    which can result in various technical problems, such as unreliable transmission
    of useful data. Therefore, in order to alleviate this “spectrum crunch”, an emerging
    trend in WSNs is to equip the wireless sensor nodes with the CR based DSA capability,
    thus giving birth to CR aided WSNs (CR-WSN) [283]–[285]. Due to its potential
    advantages, CR-WSN might be a promising solution for some specific WSN applications,
    such as indoor sensing, multiclass heterogeneous sensing, and real-time surveillance
    [283]. Additionally, WBAN, which is a promising technology for ubiquitous health
    monitoring systems, is also an application area of CR-WSN. In general, CR-WSNs
    constitute an unexplored field with only a handful of studies. More specifically,
    Oto and Akan [286] determined the optimal packet size that maximizes the energy-efficiency
    of a practical realization of a CR-WSN. Ozger et al. [287] proposed a spectrum-aware
    clustering protocol to address the event-to-sink communication coordination issue
    in mobile CR-WSNs. A cross-layer framework that employed CR to circumvent the
    hostile propagation conditions for the smart grid was discussed in [288], and
    the MAC-layer delay of a cognitive sensor node was modeled in [289]. The realization
    of CR-WSN primarily requires an efficient spectrum management framework for regulating
    the DSA of densely deployed resource-constrained sensor nodes. Therefore, MOO
    techniques invoked for designing CR-WSNs should be sufficiently intelligent to
    differentiate between the traffic types and to satisfy their QoS requirements.
    The current research efforts on MOPs for large-scale CR-WSNs have to be strengthened.
    WSNs play a key role in creating a highly reliable and self-healing smart electric
    power grid that rapidly responds to online events with appropriate actions. However,
    due to the broadcast nature of radio propagation and varying spectral characteristics,
    establishing a secure and robust low-power smart grid over the WSN must be addressed.
    Other technical challenges of WSNs in the smart grid include harsh environmental
    conditions, tight reliability and latency requirements, as well as low packet
    errors and variable link capacity. Until now, there have been only a few approaches
    available, and more studies are needed in these areas. SECTION VII. Conclusion
    In this paper, we have provided a tutorial and survey of the research of MOO in
    the context of WSNs. We commence with the rudimentary concepts of WSNs and the
    optimization objectives in WSNs, then focus on illuminating the family of algorithms
    for solving MOPs. Since having multiple objectives in a problem gives rise to
    a set of Pareto-optimal solutions instead of a single globally optimal solution,
    none of these Pareto-optimal solutions can be considered to be better than the
    others on the Pareto front without any further information. Thus the MOO algorithms
    may be invoked for finding as many Pareto-optimal solutions as possible. Additionally,
    diverse design trade-offs relying both on classical optimization methods and on
    the recent advances of MOO have been reviewed in the context of WSNs. Future research
    directions on MOO conceived for WSNs include multi-hop transmissions, the deployment
    of nodes in highly dynamic scenarios, secure multi-path routing protocols and
    solving optimization problems in 3D networks, CR-WSNs and smart grid. Authors

  title: 'A Survey of Multi-Objective Optimization in Wireless Sensor Networks: Metrics,
    Algorithms, and Open Problems'
  verbatim_quote1: Multi-objective optimization aims for finding the PSs of MOPs,
    which are usually subject to a set of constraints. However, it is infeasible for
    multiple objectives to achieve their respective optima at the same time, thus
    there may not exist a single globally optimal solution, which is the best with
    respect to all objectives. Nevertheless, there exists a set of Pareto-optimal
    or non-dominated solutions generating a set of Pareto-optimal outcomes/objective
    vectors, which is called Pareto front (PF) or Pareto boundary (PB) or surface.
  verbatim_quote2: MOEAs aim for finding a set of representative Pareto-optimal solutions
    in a single run. As a subset of MOEAs, the multi-objective genetic algorithms
    (MOGAs), such as the strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA) and the non-dominated
    sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II), have been particularly widely researched
    in the family of MOO algorithms.

    \ However, effective networking and\ncommunication protocols are required to provide\

    \ protocols\nthat can be utilized to serve the diverse data trafﬁc ﬂows that are\
    \ required between the dissimilar\nmechanisms. Additionally, we show examples\
    \ of the networking designs of a few smart city systems,\nsuch as smart transport,\
    \ smart building, smart home, smart grid, smart water, pipeline monitoring,\n\
    and control systems.\nKeywords: smart city; IoT applications; networking architectures;\
    \ Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS);\nWireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)\n1. Introduction\n\
    Nowadays, several municipalities implement the smart city model [1] to improve\n\
    the quality of life for their citizens and the efﬁcient use of city resources.\
    \ Intelligent\nservices can decrease operational costs and resource expenditure\
    \ in smart cities. They can\nenhance performance and operations in a wide variety\
    \ of smart city applications (SCAs)\nincluding transportation, healthcare, energy,\
    \ education, and many more. Smart services are\nprovided by various cutting-edge\
    \ technologies supporting the smart city model. Examples\nof these technologies\
    \ include the internet of things (IoT), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs),\nCyber-Physical\
    \ Systems (CPS), Cloud Computing (ClCom), fog computing (FoC), big data\nanalytics,\
    \ and robots.\nIoT is the core technology used in smart cities, bringing plentiful\
    \ human life beneﬁts [2].\nIoT enables the integration of physical objects/smart\
    \ things into urban environments\nwhere innovative services are offered to support\
    \ every activity at any time and from any\nlocation [2]. Things are monitored\
    \ by IoT applications that make direct decisions for their\nefﬁcient management.\
    \ Moreover, things state their conditions, such as battery status and\nfault reporting\
    \ for prognostic maintenance. WSNs offer real-time monitoring of the state\nof\
    \ the infrastructure and resources in a smart city [3]. Wireless sensor devices\
    \ can also\nobtain physical environment information such as temperature. In a\
    \ CPS, the computation,\nnetworking, and physical processes are put together to\
    \ control and monitor the physical\nenvironment of a smart city [4]. In smart\
    \ cities, CPSs are employed to offer practical\nconnections between the virtual\
    \ and physical worlds. Applications for smart cities can\nbe sustained by the\
    \ ClCom paradigm that provides a scalable and affordable platform\nElectronics\

    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n2 of 63\nfor computation and IoT data storage [5].\
    \ FogC offers reduced latency, greater mobility,\nlocation awareness, streaming,\
    \ and real-time response for SCAs [6]. Smart cities have\ndispersed vast numbers\
    \ of sensors, and thus large-scale data processing requires a complex\ninfrastructure.\
    \ Robotics in the cloud can be an effective computing tool for IoT applications\n\
    that require a lot of data processing [7]. To improve the services offered by\
    \ smart cities,\nbig data analytics is employed to generate intelligent and optimal\
    \ temporary and lasting\ndecisions [8].\nThe abovementioned technologies are used\
    \ to implement numerous smart city ser-\nvices [9,10]. For instance, intelligent\
    \ transportation services are applied to improve route\nplanning and avoid jamming\
    \ in city streets. These services can enhance vehicular safety\nand make possible\
    \ self-driving cars. Furthermore, parking services and smart trafﬁc light\ncontrols\
    \ are provided. Smart energy services [10] (e.g., intelligent energy management\n\
    and energy consumption prediction) are used to sustain smart grids and smart buildings.\n\
    These services can also offer improved utilization of renewable energy. Additional\
    \ smart\nservices are engaged in real-time monitoring of bridges, tunnels, water\
    \ networks, train and\nsubway rails, and gas and oil pipelines. Structural health\
    \ monitoring is also feasible using\nsmart services [11]. Last but not least,\
    \ there are smart services that focus on monitoring the\nenvironment, public safety,\
    \ and security of citizens [12].\nAll these smart city services necessitate a\
    \ reliable networking infrastructure to efﬁ-\nciently exchange messages between\
    \ the modules of a smart city system implementing a\nparticular smart service.\
    \ In particular, smart city services need a variety of networking and\ncommunication\
    \ technologies for their completion because they are proposed for dissim-\nilar\
    \ scales. For example, smart services for smart buildings must be implemented\
    \ based\non Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4) or Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15.1) network protocols.\
    \ On the other\nhand, smart services for the smart grid must be mainly implemented\
    \ using the WiMAX\n(IEEE 802.16) network protocol. From another viewpoint, smart\
    \ city services can exploit\ndissimilar network and communication models and solutions.\n\
    Until now, the networking and communication components of smart city systems have\n\
    received little research attention. To the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive\
    \ survey\nof network architectures and protocols for IoT applications in smart\
    \ cities does not exist\nand is the goal of this study. The communication and\
    \ networking issues involved in smart\ncity systems are examined in this study.\
    \ This paper considers networking technologies,\ntopologies, and communication\
    \ requirements for such systems. It also examines if current\nnetwork protocols\
    \ are appropriate for certain smart city services. This paper surveys recent\n\
    developments in networking architectures to support SCAs. As this is an active\
    \ area, this\npaper is important to support new research in this ﬁeld. The paper\
    \ contributes as follows:\n1.\nIt presents network requirements of the major SCAs\
    \ including intelligent transporta-\ntion, smart buildings, pipeline monitoring\
    \ and control, smart water networks, smart\ngrids, and manufacturing control and\
    \ monitoring.\n2.\nIt reviews networking architectures used for the above applications\
    \ focusing mainly\non the protocols’ suitability.\nThe remainder of this paper\
    \ is structured as follows: Section 2 describes SCAs;\nSection 3 presents network\
    \ requirements and protocols used for important SCAs;\nSections 4 and 5 analyze\
    \ protocols and network architectures for smart grids, smart build-\nings, smart\
    \ water and pipeline network monitoring, and smart transportation; Section 6\n\

    \ inappropriate articles, only\n226 studies were identiﬁed.\n2. Smart City Applications\n\
    This section discusses the main SCAs used in diverse domains. To understand what\n\
    type of assistance is needed by the networking infrastructures offered for SCAs,\
    \ their\nadvantages and design problems were addressed.\nIn the energy sector,\
    \ SCAs are being used to increase the reliability, efﬁciency, and\nsustainability\
    \ of electric energy generation and distribution in smart grids [14]. A smart\
    \ grid\nis a new power grid system that automatically collects and reacts to available\
    \ information\nabout supplier and consumer behavior. Smart grids use CPS to supply\
    \ self-monitoring and\nsuperior control mechanisms for power generation and consumer\
    \ demand, improving grid\nreliability and efﬁciency. CPS systems are also used\
    \ to manage the process of producing\nrenewable energy from wind turbines [15].\n\
    Certain applications are utilized in smart buildings to monitor and manage energy\n\
    consumption [16]. CPS controls the equipment in the buildings, including the Heating,\n\
    Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems; appliances; and lighting systems.\n\
    Different kinds of sensor nodes, which keep track of the current state of the\
    \ environment\nand energy consumption, are typically included in smart building\
    \ systems. A centralized\nmonitoring and control system receives observations\
    \ and measurements from these sensors.\nBased on reported observations, current\
    \ operational circumstances, and environmental\nfactors, the control system employs\
    \ intelligent algorithms to manage the sub-systems\nemployed in the buildings\
    \ to optimize energy consumption.\nIntelligent transportation is another SCA that\
    \ has attracted a lot of interest in the\ntransportation sector. Applications\
    \ related to vehicle safety are among the most crucial\ntypes of such applications.\
    \ Vehicles can be equipped with a variety of safety features,\nsuch as blind spot\
    \ monitoring, emergency braking, collision avoidance systems, and lane\nchange\
    \ warning signs. To improve driving safety, these applications offer full or semi-\n\
    automatic operations. Real-time and reliability support in detection and response\
    \ are these\napplications’ most crucial characteristics. Applications for enhancing\
    \ vehicle safety must\nbe dependable and able to operate in real-time in all aspects\
    \ such as threat observations,\ndecision making, communication, and actions. However,\
    \ the software cannot handle\nhigh levels of incorporation across all the relevant\
    \ devices and guarantee real-time and\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n5 of 63\ntrustworthy\
    \ replies. Furthermore, self-driving vehicles are regarded as crucial SCAs [17].\n\
    They combine all the aforementioned capabilities with vision and monitoring equipment\n\
    to provide the vehicle the ability to traverse the roads using sensed data and\
    \ intelligent\nsoftware that evaluates and reacts to these data in real-time.\
    \ Intelligent trafﬁc light controls,\nwhich incorporate device monitoring across\
    \ numerous locations to precisely forecast trafﬁc\npatterns, are another application\
    \ of intelligent transportation. The authors of [18] present\nan example of intelligent\
    \ trafﬁc lights.\nWater networks are maintained using smart city technology to\
    \ increase their intelli-\ngence, efﬁciency, dependability, and sustainability.\
    \ CPS systems are integrated into water\nnetworks to add smart characteristics\
    \ to the processes of water distribution [19]. Offering\nearly warning systems\

    observations, decision making, communication, and actions. However, the software\
    \ \ncannot handle high levels of incorporation across all the relevant devices\
    \ and guarantee \nreal-time and trustworthy replies. Furthermore, self-driving\
    \ vehicles are regarded as \ncrucial SCAs [17]. They combine all the aforementioned\
    \ capabilities with vision and \nmonitoring equipment to provide the vehicle the\
    \ ability to traverse the roads using \nsensed data and intelligent software that\
    \ evaluates and reacts to these data in real-time. \nIntelligent traffic light\
    \ controls, which incorporate device monitoring across numerous \nlocations to\
    \ precisely forecast traffic patterns, are another application of intelligent\
    \ \ntransportation. The authors of [18] present an example of intelligent traffic\

    \ 63\nAnalysis of Smart City Applications/Systems\nThis subsection analyses the\
    \ SCAs shown in Figure 2.\nSmart Trafﬁc Surveillance Systems: These systems are\
    \ based on centralized pro-\ncesses and may fail due to networking problems. Thus,\
    \ to automate such an innova-\ntive system, centralized and distributed methods\
    \ must be used to maintain local servers.\nJavaid et al. [26] suggested a smart\
    \ trafﬁc management system using a mixture of central-\nized and decentralized\
    \ processes to optimize the ﬂow of vehicles on roads and an algorithm\nto manage\
    \ a variety of trafﬁc conditions efﬁciently. In the context of smart cities, effec-\n\
    tive trafﬁc management implies that a decision-making model identiﬁes and quantiﬁes\n\
    trafﬁc congestion as well as predicts trafﬁc patterns. Afrin and Yodo [27] offered\
    \ a theoreti-\ncal analysis that takes into account such effective trafﬁc management.\
    \ Notably, existing\ndecision-making models are primarily devoted to urban and\
    \ highway trafﬁc management,\nnot considering the closed campuses and collector\
    \ roads scenarios. Sarrab et al. [28] iden-\ntiﬁed this weakness and proposed\
    \ an IoT-based system model that collects, processes,\nand stores real-time trafﬁc\
    \ data for such an unusual scenario. In an IoT-based trafﬁc man-\nagement system,\
    \ various challenges emerge. These challenges include security issues,\nextremely\
    \ sophisticated networking equipment, network overhead, required adjustments,\n\
    and speciﬁc information ﬁelds in the protocol header and structure, as well as\
    \ higher costs.\nSmart Healthcare Systems: For real-time monitoring of health\
    \ parameters, these sys-\ntems are progressively being associated with and connected\
    \ via the Internet to numerous\ntypes of available smart wearable sensing and\
    \ computing devices. These systems face\nseveral problems [29] that must be resolved.\
    \ A security/privacy perspective, inter-realm au-\nthentication, interoperability\
    \ issues, device-to-device informal communication, and collec-\ntion and management\
    \ of medical data are among the issues on this list. Alromaihi et al. [30]\naddressed\
    \ issues related to cyber-security while using IoT for such applications. They\n\
    sought to examine secure techniques’ deployment and implementation from the perspec-\n\
    tive of preventing and reducing cyber-attacks on IoT devices. Some crucial surveys\
    \ and\nreviews [31,32] on smart healthcare applications tackle the problem of\
    \ integrating IoT\nsystems with any healthcare application particularly.\nWeather\
    \ and Air Quality Monitoring Systems: These systems use environmental\nmonitoring\
    \ stations, which are extremely pricey to acquire and maintain. For example,\n\
    these stations require engineers with specialized skill sets and data analysts.\
    \ Therefore, it is\nimpractical to deploy such monitoring stations densely. Instead,\
    \ they are often deployed\nsparsely, which creates the problem of limited spatial\
    \ resolutions for useful measurements.\nLately, cheap monitoring sensors have\
    \ evolved in the market, signiﬁcantly assisting in\nreﬁning the granularity of\
    \ monitoring [33]. Highlighting the same problem, the authors [33]\nemphasized\
    \ the drawbacks of these inexpensive sensors (particularly with air quality\n\
    monitoring sensors). For instance, these sensors frequently struggle with the\
    \ issue of\ncross-compassions in the presence of multiple ambient pollutants.\
    \ Moreover, these sensors\nare extremely susceptible to unexpected variations\
    \ in humidity, temperature, and wind\ndirection, and as a result, their accuracy\
    \ deteriorates with time. A recalibration routine\nmight be a way to maintain\
    \ and enhance such accuracy. However, because it would take\na lot more time and\
    \ work, this technique is highly improbable and would not work for\nlarge-scale\
    \ deployments. In a weather monitoring system, the monitoring is highly complex\n\
    and involves three steps [34]:\n(1)\nObserving: It can be performed by monitoring\
    \ satellite imagery, precipitation reports,\nsurface data, and gathering data\
    \ from other nearby forecasters.\n(2)\nForecasting: It can be performed by forecasters\
    \ as short-term and long-term forecasting.\nShort-term forecasting is carried\
    \ out by evaluating the current weather conditions\nand projecting them over the\
    \ next few hours using knowledge of the mechanics\nof the weather. Long-term forecasting,\
    \ however, is possible through weather (nu-\nmerical) modeling and the projection\
    \ of such modeling using computer simulations.\nTo produce these simulations for\
    \ future forecasting, these modeling techniques use\nenvironmental data from satellite\
    \ photography, weather balloons, and surface ob-\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n\
    7 of 63\nservations. Following completion of the forecasting, the forecasters\
    \ translate the\nproduced simulated expected output into a perceptible format\
    \ for non-specialists so\nthat they can respond appropriately.\n(3)\nCommunicating:\
    \ Finally, they communicate such output or forecasted information to\nappropriate\
    \ authorities.\nDespite the fact that all of these computer models are used to\
    \ forecast the weather, the\nsuccess of each one is largely inﬂuenced by three\
    \ different elements: (a) the quantity of\nprecise data; (b) the length of time\
    \ needed to analyze that data; and (c) the complexity of\ndynamic atmospheric\
    \ weather events. A large part of collecting accurate data for a region\nis the\
    \ placement of weather stations. They may occasionally be stationed distant from\
    \ rural\nareas in a city area. Because of this, they are unable to gather enough\
    \ information for desert,\nsea, or even rural areas to supply the computer models\
    \ used to predict weather conditions\naccurately. Forecasters also use satellite\
    \ data to combat this issue. However, because\nof cloud cover and signiﬁcant changes\
    \ in the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere,\nsatellite data accuracy can\
    \ occasionally be unreliable. Moreover, the topographic image and\nmap information\
    \ or surface/land features change substantially in a shorter area. Hence,\nit\
    \ further impacts temperature and precipitation values signiﬁcantly. This further\
    \ makes\nthings harder for a computer model to predict accurately. Hence, there\
    \ is a need to re-\nevaluate and re-modify such models’ mathematical equations\
    \ so that they can predict the\nchanges more accurately.\nSmart Waste Management\
    \ Systems: Automated smart waste management is crucial for\nthe following reasons:\
    \ (1) due to a lack of waste disposal infrastructure; (2) thin or delicate\nwaste\
    \ collection methods being required; (3) lack of effective waste logistics management;\n\
    (4) insufﬁcient use of cutting-edge trash treatment and recycling technologies;\
    \ and (5) lack\nof workers and specialists with the necessary technical and non-technical\
    \ skills to handle\ngarbage disposal and the associated infrastructures. Smart\
    \ waste management schemes\ninclude various steps such as (1) waste collection;\
    \ (2) differentiation of waste as per their\nbiological and physical properties;\
    \ (3) storage; (4) transportation of waste into garbage\ndisposal infrastructures/treatment\
    \ plants; and (5) waste treatment and disposal. Sosunova\nand Porras [35] identiﬁed\
    \ issues and challenges while collecting and analyzing data from\nsmart deployed\
    \ sensors on garbage bins. Their study investigated some operational issues\n\
    such as the management of waste vehicles and urban infrastructure and smartly\
    \ managing\nwaste vehicle routes.\nSmart Street Lighting Systems: This system\
    \ is a network-oriented solution that uses\nstreetlights ﬁtted with speciﬁc actuators\
    \ and sensors, implying a wide range of facilities\nand connectivity interfaces\
    \ [36]. The street lighting application (described in [37]) has a\nmechanism that\
    \ gathers or monitors environmental data and then evaluates street lighting\n\
    with the use of smart wireless nodes (ﬁtted out with numerous forms of sensors\
    \ and\nactuators). These smart nodes are mounted atop the towers that hold the\
    \ streetlights, and\nthey are connected to the Internet by way of a gateway device.\
    \ Zanella et al. [37] insist\nthat their system could assist in gathering environmental\
    \ parameters such as humidity, air\ntemperature, and CO level. Moreover, the authors\
    \ stated that optimizing street lighting\nefﬁciency is a paramount concern that\
    \ must be addressed. This monitoring system makes\nit possible to maximize efﬁciency\
    \ since it allows for the adjustment of streetlamp intensity\nin response to the\
    \ time of day, the presence of people, and the weather. Although this\nsystem\
    \ is simple and built on the IoT concept, it will inevitably contain crucial concerns\
    \ that\nrequire particular attention, such as complicated networking solutions\
    \ and communication\namong heterogeneous devices. However, selecting the right\
    \ light lamp is critical for a\npower-efﬁcient lighting mechanism. Their selection\
    \ is based on how effective they are in\nterms of power usage and lifespan. The\
    \ existing metropolitan system relies on Metal Halide\n(MH) or High-Pressure Sodium\
    \ (HPS) bulbs. Unlike LEDs, these bulbs are frequently seen\nas being inefﬁcient\
    \ in terms of power consumption and requiring signiﬁcant maintenance,\nwhich adds\
    \ signiﬁcantly to the cost. In addition, the system should be designed following\n\
    the advised design standards (it must adhere to the current standard CEN/TR 13201)\
    \ [36].\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n8 of 63\nCurrently, there are three kinds\
    \ of control systems for smart lighting systems in use:\ncentralized, decentralized,\
    \ and hybrid. Nevertheless, these systems are susceptible to a\nvariety of security\
    \ assaults. Moreover, not much effort has been made into this problem\nthus far.\n\
    Smart Emergency Response Systems: Such a system ensures the safety and security\
    \ of\nits residents. It can be utilized for crime detection and prevention, dealing\
    \ with natural\ncalamities and accidents, and law enforcement [38]. Data collection\
    \ is ﬁrst and foremost\nimportant for the designing portion of these applications.\
    \ Depending on the gathered\nfacts, the development of intelligence (which aids\
    \ in making important decisions) and the\nability to respond swiftly and quickly\
    \ are the issues that require special attention. When\nit comes to gathering data,\
    \ we can make use of CCTV cameras and sophisticated trafﬁc\nsensors. A developer\
    \ can create and put into action a crucial learning scheme that will\nconduct\
    \ predictive analysis and gather intelligence on top of the data gathered. Therefore,\n\
    this kind of predictive analysis has the potential to gather signiﬁcant information\
    \ that\nwill help the relevant authorities (e.g., the ﬁre safety department, the\
    \ police department,\nand law enforcement agencies) take the proper security and\
    \ preventive measures. The\nconcept of widespread surveillance has important beneﬁts\
    \ for security and safety. However,\nkeeping track of such vast amounts of data\
    \ also prompts a lot of worries and issues for\ndesigners and developers, including\
    \ storage; the effectiveness of learning algorithms; and,\nmost importantly, the\
    \ question of whether it is morally right or acceptable to keep track\nof each\
    \ individual (a privacy issue). In addition, a very important point is whether\
    \ this\nkind of widespread surveillance is feasible, especially for nations such\
    \ as China and India,\nwhere a city’s population can exceed that of a whole nation.\
    \ Further, Gharaibeh et al. [38]\nclaimed that combining information transmission\
    \ technologies with well-implemented\ndata analytics models is necessary for quick\
    \ and swift collaboration. To save as many lives\nas possible during natural disasters,\
    \ it is imperative to gather, assess, and communicate\nvital information to the\
    \ relevant authorities. As a result, there is currently a lot of work\nbeing done\
    \ to enhance the performance of information exchange systems. Although this\n\
    system is based on the IoT concept and is relatively simple, it faces important\
    \ problems\nthat need consideration, such as complex networking solutions and\
    \ information sharing\nacross heterogeneous devices on time (time-sensitive application).\n\
    Smart Residence/Home Automation: A smart home has highly developed systems\nsuch\
    \ as a control system for devices or objects (such as fans, lights, music systems,\
    \ TVs,\nand other smart appliances), automated door openers, smart appliances\
    \ that may send\nusers remote status updates, smart refrigerators, and washing\
    \ machines. A user can control\nthe majority of smart home appliances remotely\
    \ with two recently produced gadgets:\nGoogle Home and Amazon Echo. In a smart\
    \ home, the end-user demands a high-speed\ninternet connection, so they can access\
    \ networking sites that control the home with HD live\nstreaming services. In\
    \ contrast, a smart healthcare application needs safe connections to\ncomputing\
    \ servers in the cloud for managing sensitive private information. Hence, data\n\
    management systems must address a crucial issue, namely, the necessity to concentrate\n\
    on data distribution based on various end-user categories rather than just recommending\n\
    distinct data distribution among various end-user groups [38]. The concept of\
    \ smart home\nautomation raises serious concerns about security and privacy risks.\
    \ A smart home includes\nsecurity monitoring systems with motion sensors, wirelessly\
    \ opening smart door locks,\ntelevisions, phones, and other smart appliances that\
    \ are highly outﬁtted with cameras and\nmicrophones. Although these gadgets improve\
    \ the system, little research has been done on\ntheir privacy and security features.\
    \ If we conduct a thorough analysis of these gadgets, we\nwill discover that their\
    \ manufacturers offer either very few or no security features at all.\nIndeed,\
    \ Fernandes et al. [39] provided their eye-opening views after carefully examining\n\
    Samsung’s SmartThings framework (programming) and their SmartApps market. They\n\
    argued that more than 50%—exactly 55%—of these smart applications are already\
    \ more\nprivileged by default and as a result, do not need to access unrelated\
    \ applications. As a\nresult, hackers can use them with ease. Apart from this,\
    \ according to a published document\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n9 of 63\nby WikiLeaks\
    \ [40], the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has all the tools to access, control,\n\
    and hack these smart home applications anywhere in the world. Furthermore, criminal\n\
    entities and hackers could seize control of smart personal devices, capture delicate\
    \ private\ninformation, and exploit that information immorally typically through\
    \ user tracking and\nproﬁling. Additionally, a hacker may break into one of these\
    \ smart applications, grab vital\ninformation, and then use it to launch any kind\
    \ of attack. For instance, based on motion\nsensors, security camera feeds, and\
    \ power usage patterns, a burglar can determine where\nand when to break into\
    \ the house. By locating the authentication credentials of authorized\nparties,\
    \ they can compromise smart door locks [41]. Better security-aware hardware and\n\
    software (as well as the related common standards) must be developed to safeguard\
    \ against\nall these attempts so that high-tech appliances, sensors, actuators,\
    \ etc., are impervious to\nsuch security and privacy attacks.\nSmart Grid Networks:\
    \ The functionality of the traditional electricity grid is unidirec-\ntional (i.e.,\
    \ electricity is transmitted from electricity-producing sources to end-customers).\n\
    Electricity has been moving from power plants to users in a single direction thanks\
    \ to\nthe deployment of electricity grids. The existing grid system operates in\
    \ an open-loop\nfashion since there are not any adequate communication infrastructures\
    \ in the distribution\nsector. Moreover, the main distribution center has little\
    \ or no real-time knowledge of the\nsystem’s operating conditions and dynamically\
    \ changing load. There are also several tech-\nnical, economic, and environmental\
    \ problems with this conventional approach. Therefore,\nthis conventional system\
    \ must become dependable, manageable, and scalable, as well as\nﬂexible, secure,\
    \ and interoperable [42].\nThe smart grid is the next invention of the Electric\
    \ Power System (EPS) that incor-\nporates quicker, more secure, and reliable communication\
    \ networks [43]. Smart grids\nsupplement the conventional electricity grid by\
    \ incorporating renewable energy sources\nsuch as biomass, solar energy, and wind\
    \ energy. These energy sources are much cleaner\nand more ecologically friendly\
    \ than non-renewable energy sources such as fossil fuels.\nHowever, it is important\
    \ to identify the most suitable communication technology for the\nsmart grid’s\
    \ successful implementation and deployment. The smart grid’s overall commu-\n\
    nication style is unique compared with conventional network communication patterns.\
    \ The\ncommunication network architecture of the smart grid must be able to handle\
    \ information\nexchange between sensors, actuators, smart electronic devices,\
    \ and numerous smart meters\nin such a particular environment with little to no\
    \ human intervention. This type of com-\nmunication, called Device-to-Device (D2D)\
    \ communication, is autonomous and may be\ninitiated in response to an event or\
    \ at regular intervals. Notably, depending on how these\nsmart grid applications\
    \ were built, their QoS requirements and characteristics differ greatly\nin terms\
    \ of delay, burst size, and packet arrival rate. For example, the latency requirement\n\
    of a smart meter event and a substation event are quite different [44]. In intelligent\
    \ grid\nnetworks, the monitoring, managing, and controlling functions inside the\
    \ same network\npresent the issues of ﬂexible QoS differentiation. Moreover, applications\
    \ based on the smart\ngrid can be developed and implemented using the current\
    \ wireless and wired networking\ninfrastructure and technologies. For some devices,\
    \ such as smart meters, designing and\nstandardizing acceptable smart grid-based\
    \ protocols is a critical matter [45]. Furthermore,\nthese smart grid-based networks\
    \ are too dependent on intelligent sensors, actuators, and\nother devices. This\
    \ makes them extremely vulnerable to attacks by malicious users. These\nsmart\
    \ grids could be taken over by malevolent users or hackers, who could then obtain\n\
    unauthorized access to many smart meters and alter crucial data. Moreover, as\
    \ the existing\nelectricity system is insufﬁcient for establishing smart grid\
    \ systems, high-level adjustments\nto current power infrastructure scenarios are\
    \ required. Subsequently, these smart systems\nrequire high installation costs\
    \ because the installation requires a large number of smart\nmeters, sensors,\
    \ and actuators for sensing and data collection [46]. The efﬁcient operation of\n\
    such a smart grid system also necessitates a dependable, consistent, and error-free\
    \ network\nchannel. Therefore, it will be challenging for developers of such intelligent\
    \ applications.\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n10 of 63\nMany surveys [42–45,47]\
    \ reviewed communication frameworks for smart grids, smart-\ngrid-based networking\
    \ technologies, trafﬁc management, and the requirements of numer-\nous smart grid\
    \ applications. Further, Kansal and Bose [48] presented their insights on\ntransmission\
    \ grid applications regarding their latency and bandwidth requirements.\n3. Network\
    \ Requirements for SCAs\nThis section considers several communication requirements\
    \ including reliability, delay\ntolerance, bandwidth, power consumption, security,\
    \ network type, heterogeneous network\nsupport, and mobility support. It also\
    \ studies the aptness of different network protocols for\ndissimilar SCAs.\nSmart\
    \ city services and applications need robust and dependable communication\nsupport\
    \ as well as an effective networking infrastructure, which will permit competent\n\
    message-sharing procedures among the components of the smart city systems [49].\
    \ Every\nsmart city system has an intricate networking architecture made up of\
    \ various networking\ncomponents. Therefore, smart city systems are innately required\
    \ to have a variety of net-\nworking requirements. To access the far-off destination,\
    \ which may be clouds, the network\ntrafﬁc from a broad variety of deployed diverse\
    \ applications uses a common networking\narchitecture and resources. These resources\
    \ may consist of switches, routers, communica-\ntion connections (links), and\
    \ other forms of network middle-boxes. The idea of accessing\nfaraway clouds or\
    \ far-off destinations or remotely distributed apps consequently brings\nup problems\
    \ with high packet loss probability, signiﬁcant delay, and constrained network\n\
    bandwidth. In addition, security is a serious issue that must be considered when\
    \ develop-\ning, implementing, and deploying intelligent applications for smart\
    \ cities. Otherwise, users\nwould be reluctant to approve the use of such applications\
    \ in the absence of adequate secu-\nrity safeguards. Such intelligent applications\
    \ need a high-speed networking environment\nwhere the quick reaction may be managed\
    \ with the support of the ability of a fast-processing\nspeed. Furthermore, a\
    \ variety of apps can be implemented in the context of a smart city,\nbased on\
    \ their usefulness and relevance to the users. These applications, however, have\n\
    different networking requirements, particularly in terms of response and security\
    \ [50]. For\nexample, the networking requirements of smart emergency response\
    \ systems are quite\ndifferent compared to other applications such as smart healthcare\
    \ systems. Emergency\nresponse smart systems must be exceedingly secure and quick\
    \ to react [50]. In contrast,\nsmart-healthcare-based systems or apps do not necessarily\
    \ need to be especially dynamic.\n−\nNetwork Protocols: Monitoring applications\
    \ for smart cities often use a dense network\nof heterogeneous sensor nodes, including\
    \ ﬁxed sensor nodes, mobile sensor nodes,\nand crowd sensing nodes. Long-Term\
    \ Evolution (LTE) [51], LTE for Machines (LTE-M),\nextended coverage GSM IoT,\
    \ and ﬁfth-generation (5G) technologies [52] are intriguing\noptions to support\
    \ such heterogeneous networks. First, the bulk of crowd-sensing\nnodes (smartphones)\
    \ is already supported by LTE communications. Consequently, no\nfurther wireless\
    \ communication devices are required. To save energy, LTE and 5G can\nbe utilized\
    \ on the sink nodes (also known as cluster heads) to allow the data gathered\n\
    by the sink nodes to be transmitted to the monitoring center via base stations\
    \ (the\nbackbone network), as opposed to multihop relaying.\n−\nZigbee [53], WiFi,\
    \ and Bluetooth can still be used for the traditional stationary nodes\nto communicate\
    \ within clusters. This layout has the advantage of allowing the sensor\nnode\
    \ clusters to be separated from one another while maintaining network connectiv-\n\
    ity. Additionally, the moderate number of nodes in each cluster makes maintenance\n\
    simpler. In addition to supporting larger networks, LTE and 5G technologies also\
    \ make\npossible sensor nodes with faster data rates, improving the performance\
    \ of real-time\nmonitoring [54]. Applications for crowd sensing, for instance,\
    \ can accommodate video\nstreams taken by cameras on smartphones or moving vehicles.\
    \ The fast data rates\nprovided by LTE and 5G can potentially be advantageous\
    \ for the sink nodes or clusters.\nThe use of vibration data (accelerometer readings)\
    \ in structural health monitoring\napplications of bridges, tunnels, or towers\
    \ is fairly common. The cluster heads will be\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n11\
    \ of 63\nable to send the vibration data in this situation in real time. In conclusion,\
    \ practically\nall applications for smart city monitoring that demand a high data\
    \ throughput and\nminimal delay may be satisﬁed by LTE and 5G. Additionally, there\
    \ are some new\nsensor node standards, such as IEEE 802.11ah [55], LoRaWAN [56],\
    \ and Narrowband-\nIoT (NB-IoT) [57]. These narrowband protocols offer numerous\
    \ advantages: greater\ncoverage, improved scalability, reduced energy usage, and\
    \ increased device longevity.\nResearchers have tested these standards in more\
    \ than a few applications, including\nstreet lighting, energy metering, and home\
    \ automation, even though some are still\nbeing discussed and revised. The new\
    \ narrowband communication standards enable\nthe sensor nodes to run more sustainably,\
    \ which is beneﬁcial for applications that\naim for long-term monitoring. In addition\
    \ to these protocols and standards, the FogC\narchitecture [58] aids in monitoring\
    \ smart cities. In such an architecture, the mobile\nusers (the potential crowd-sensing\
    \ providers) and the cloud are connected via fog\nservers. These fog servers are\
    \ WiFi access points or cellular base stations. Mobile users\nare more inclined\
    \ to participate in sensing since they may upload their crowd-sensing\nmeasurements\
    \ to the fog server in just one hop, signiﬁcantly decreasing the cost and\nenergy\
    \ usage compared to cellular networks. As a result, such an architecture can give\n\
    us better sensing coverage. Using the measurements from the mobile users and the\n\
    WSNs, the fog servers can perform some basic regional estimation based on the\
    \ FogC\narchitecture, such as the nearby trafﬁc conditions. The service latency\
    \ and response\ntime are then decreased because mobile users can access such estimates\
    \ directly from\nthe fog servers rather than from a remote cloud through a backbone\
    \ network. Lastly,\nusing the appropriate networking protocols for each SCA is\
    \ crucial to getting the\nbest possible trade-off between delay, energy use, and\
    \ cost. The networks may be\nhierarchical so that diverse roles and functions\
    \ can be assigned at various layers to\nincrease the networks’ dependability and\
    \ cost-effectiveness. As a result, certain nodes\nmay be able to transmit data\
    \ utilizing various protocols.\n−\nBandwidth requirements: Many video applications\
    \ in smart cities require high band-\nwidth [59]. In these applications, sensors\
    \ capture video from the physical environment.\nMoreover, video transmission is\
    \ more bandwidth-hungry than the conventional scalar\ndata trafﬁc in IoT. Examples\
    \ of these applications are intelligent multimedia surveil-\nlance systems for\
    \ home monitoring, multimedia-based industrial monitoring systems,\ntrafﬁc monitoring\
    \ systems for road safety, and remote multimedia-based monitoring\nof an environmental\
    \ system.\n−\nDelay Tolerance: Some SCAs, such as smart transportation, only tolerate\
    \ a small\namount of end-to-end delay. For example, to prevent imminent danger\
    \ to the ve-\nhicle or potentially fatal crashes, the data that are being relayed\
    \ must arrive within\nmicroseconds. Therefore, the control systems must react\
    \ in time. However, other\napplications have a higher tolerance for delays [49].\
    \ Such applications rely on data\nmonitoring and information gathering for upcoming\
    \ analysis.\n−\nPower Consumption: Another crucial need for applications is power\
    \ consumption.\nSmart grid systems and other applications with local high-energy\
    \ sources can tolerate\nprotocols with higher energy expenditure levels [45].\
    \ Other applications have medium\npower needs and require energy sources with\
    \ limited capacities. One example of such\nan application is intelligent transportation.\
    \ Other applications demand protocols with\nlow or very low energy consumption\
    \ characteristics since they have limited energy\nresources. Unmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ (UAVs), smart water networks, and pipeline\nmonitoring for gas and oil are a\
    \ few examples of such uses.\n−\nReliability: The majority of applications have\
    \ medium reliability requirements. A\ntypical example of such applications is\
    \ smart water networks. Some other applications\nhave high-reliability necessities\
    \ such as intelligent transportation and smart grids [49].\n−\nSecurity: The majority\
    \ of applications need medium to high security. Applications\nsuch as production\
    \ control and monitoring, for instance, need medium security, whilst\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n12 of 63\nothers, such as smart grids, need high security because\
    \ of the sensitivity of the data\nand the importance of the operations carried\
    \ out [50].\n−\nHeterogeneity of network protocols: The majority of smart city\
    \ systems use network-\ning protocols that link the system’s parts together. Intelligent\
    \ transportation and smart\nbuildings are two examples of such systems. These\
    \ protocols must coexist in such\nsituations without conﬂicting with one another.\
    \ To ensure seamless and effective\noperation, it is also necessary to correctly\
    \ map the control information in the head-\ners at the various networking stack\
    \ tiers used by the many heterogeneous protocols\nand networks.\n−\nWired/wireless\
    \ connectivity: The majority of SCAs that include wireless connectivity\nare UAVs\
    \ and monitoring of gas and oil pipelines. Others, including intelligent\ntransportation\
    \ and smart buildings, use wired and wireless connectivity [50]. In\nthese situations,\
    \ wired networking may be used for communication within a speciﬁc\nphysical system\
    \ (such as within a UAV), while wireless communication may be used\nto link the\
    \ physical system to other such systems that are comparable to it or to the\n\
    backbone and infrastructure networks.\n−\nMobility: Some systems, such as the\
    \ smart grid, pipeline monitoring for gas and oil,\nand smart water networks,\
    \ have low to medium mobility [50]. Other systems, such\nas UAVs and intelligent\
    \ transportation, are quite mobile. Medium- to high-mobility\nsmart city systems\
    \ can be connected if the networking protocols are reliable and\nadaptable to\
    \ node mobility without using up a large amount of bandwidth on control\nmessages\
    \ and related processing to react to changes in the network architecture.\nTable\
    \ 1 presents a qualitative comparison of the requirements of some SCAs. Each\n\
    SCA has its own transmission range and is sustained by a heterogeneous network\
    \ with\nlow, medium, or high trafﬁc rates and supporting high or low mobility\
    \ of devices. Each\nSCA is based on different protocols and requires different\
    \ bandwidth and latency tolerance.\nIn each SCA, the number of devices involved\
    \ differs.\nTable 1. Networking aspects and qualitative comparison of SCA requirements.\n\

    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n13 of 63\n3.1. Additional Challenges\n−\nInteroperability:\
    \ Smart city systems are built on several heterogeneous networking\nprotocols\
    \ that use various media access control (MAC) mechanisms at the physi-\ncal and\
    \ data link layers. For the underlying technologies to be integrated seam-\nlessly,\
    \ these protocols must be interoperable [60]. In digital home networks, the IEEE\n\
    1905.1 protocol [61], which was created to offer a convergent interface between\
    \ physi-\ncal/data link layers and the network layer, is aimed to perform this\
    \ function. Future\nresearch should focus on the creation of similar protocols\
    \ to increase the support\nsystem for smart city systems.\n−\nScalability: A smart\
    \ city platform must manage many devices that are connected to\nthe city’s infrastructure.\
    \ Large amounts of city-related data, which are continuously\nproduced and consumed\
    \ by devices and client applications, must be stored and\nprocessed. The platform\
    \ must simultaneously be able to handle hundreds of requests\nfrom users and services\
    \ that rely on it. Thus, the scalability requirements change\ndepending on the\
    \ features of the city as well as the installed applications and services.\nRecently,\
    \ Del Esponte et al. [62] suggested InterSCity, a microservices-based, open-\n\
    source smart city platform that facilitates the collaborative development of large-scale\n\
    systems, apps, and services for smart cities.\n−\nLoad Balancing: To maximize\
    \ the usage of resources, load balancing assigns appro-\npriate resources (i.e.,\
    \ network resources, storage capacity, computational resources,\nand energy resources)\
    \ to user tasks. A large-scale IoT network performs better and\navoids overload\
    \ thanks to an effective load-balancing strategy [63]. Response time,\ncost, throughput,\
    \ performance, and resource usage are all improved in terms of\nQoS parameters.\n\
    −\nThe Cloud/Edge/FogC Paradigms: Cloud, Edge, and FogC facilitate the creation\
    \ of\nsmart city prototypes. These computing paradigms efﬁciently aid in the gathering,\n\
    upkeep, and analysis of city data to pinpoint crucial city-related events that\
    \ demand\nadvanced processing and response [64]. Nonetheless, some IoT applications/systems\n\
    for smart cities have strict processing and delay constraints. These real-time\
    \ applica-\ntions present the greatest obstacles to cloud-based services. Consequently,\
    \ FogC and\nEdge Computing have emerged as viable computing paradigms for designing,\
    \ imple-\nmenting, deploying, and controlling such systems/applications. These\
    \ paradigms\nbring computing resources closer to the IoT/device plane so that\
    \ the primary computa-\ntion can be done locally [65,66]. Each computing paradigm\
    \ offers particular assistance\nbased on the requirements of the application at\
    \ hand. For example, to support a cloud-\nbased SCA, ClCom offers centralized\
    \ storage and processing capacity. For certain\nSCAs, ClCom can offer scalable\
    \ processing power and data storage [5]. The features of\nClCom (e.g., powerful\
    \ processing, massive and scalable data storage, and cutting-edge\nsoftware services)\
    \ can be used to provide various support services for a variety of\nSCAs. ClCom\
    \ can be the primary control and management platform for SCAs. The\ncity’s ClCom\
    \ services can be used to connect various sensors and actuators for SCAs\nto gather,\
    \ process, store, and manage sensor data for various SCAs. Vast volumes\nof data\
    \ are gathered across a smart city, which can eventually become big data. The\n\
    sophisticated platforms required for storing and analyzing this massive amount\
    \ of\ndata to improve operations and planning can be provided by Cloud Computing.\
    \ To\neffectively support SCAs, the communication between city sensors and actuators\
    \ and\nClCom may involve various communication requirements. The network architectures\n\
    used in the smart city should meet these requirements. Smart applications require\n\
    the integration of sensors, actuators, and the cloud, and they can only function\
    \ well\nwith a robust network that offers good communication services linking\
    \ both sides.\nThe fact that cloud services are either provided at a single central\
    \ location or across\nnumerous distributed platforms in various locations is another\
    \ problem that occurs\nwhen adopting ClCom for a smart city. For many cloud applications,\
    \ the distributed\nClCom strategy can offer greater quality and dependability\
    \ support [67]. However,\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n14 of 63\nit is frequently\
    \ necessary to establish effective communication channels between the\ndistributed\
    \ ClCom facilities that are present in various locations. The dependability\n\
    and efﬁciency of the networks linking all components on both sides present another\n\
    problem when using the cloud. There are issues with delays, dropped packets, and\n\
    unstable connections when the Internet is involved. To consider these challenges,\n\
    the SCA architecture must be carefully studied, as must the planning and control\
    \ of\nnetwork resources and communication models. However, some elements cannot\
    \ be\navoided, such as transmission delays. Ksentini et al. [68] investigated\
    \ the QoS require-\nments of many IoT/cloud-enabled applications in a FogC environment\
    \ to recognize\nQoS metrics. The authors introduced a QoS management model (QoS-Fog)\
    \ that is\ninspired by the work of the OpenFog consortium on the reference architecture\
    \ [69] for\na FogC system.\n3.2. Features and Challenges of Smart City Networks\n\
    A smart city network has the following features [70]:\n1.\nLarge Densities: A\
    \ smart city network has a very large density as thousands of smart\ndevices are\
    \ distributed in the area of a city.\n2.\nAbnormal Trafﬁc Patterns: Cascading\
    \ or synchronization among smart devices produces\nextremely bursty or correlated\
    \ trafﬁc patterns. These trafﬁc patterns differ from\nthe regular social-generated\
    \ trafﬁc patterns on which most existing schemes and\ntechnology used in our society\
    \ are based.\n3.\nDisorganized Network Topology: Unlike the widely used wireless\
    \ connectivity features,\nsmart city networks often adhere to a mesh network topology.\
    \ The problem arises\nwhen smart devices communicate across unreliable wireless\
    \ channels, where packet\nlosses caused by wireless channel special properties\
    \ are extremely common and even-\ntually have an impact on the functioning of\
    \ the smart city system. Therefore, it appears\nvery improbable that a single\
    \ high-throughput backbone can be deployable soon.\n4.\nHeterogeneity: SCAs use\
    \ a variety of technologies. In terms of power consumption,\nlatency, throughput,\
    \ and communication ranges, each of these technologies operates\nat a unique trade-off\
    \ threshold. The involved dissimilar technologies must coexist on\na single platform.\n\
    5.\nCoexistence of heterogeneous technologies: Communication technologies used\
    \ in smart\ncities are distributed over the same radio space. At the same time,\
    \ independent radio\ninfrastructures are connected through a variety of wireless\
    \ channels. Under such\ncircumstances, the SCA must handle interference issues\
    \ with competence.\n6.\nSecurity and Privacy: SCAs are extremely vulnerable to\
    \ several risks from malevolent\nusers. The majority of specialized smart sensors,\
    \ actuators, and other intelligent\ndevices are developed by designers without\
    \ considering security measures. Such\napplications may be highly vulnerable due\
    \ to hostile actors’ ease of access to these\ncutting-edge technologies and potential\
    \ threats to people’s security and privacy.\nThe main challenges for smart city\
    \ networks are as follows [70]:\n•\nLack of Standardization Solutions: The IEEE\
    \ 802.15.1 Bluetooth technologies for Personal\nArea Networks (PANs) and the IEEE\
    \ 802.11 groups for wireless LANs adopt the\nconcept of single-hop ad-hoc networking.\
    \ These standards permit direct communi-\ncation between two devices that are\
    \ in the transmission range of each other. At the\nsame time, the multi-hop ad-hoc\
    \ networking paradigm enables the communication\nbetween any two devices which\
    \ are not necessarily in their transmission range [71]. A\nproblem that researchers\
    \ must consider is how these intricate heterogeneous sets of\ndevices (i.e., actuators,\
    \ sensors, and other smart devices) can communicate uniformly\nwithout any standardization.\
    \ Global distributors and manufacturers must propose\nand accept standardized\
    \ network solutions that enable communication between di-\nverse devices on homogeneous\
    \ communication entities. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard\nis the dominant solution\
    \ that presents a sophisticated version of the Physical Layer.\nThis standard\
    \ deals with the trade-off between data rate, communication range, and\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n15 of 63\npower consumption. Several revisions or amendments\
    \ (i.e., IEEE 802.15.4g and IEEE\n802.15.4e) aimed at the SCA have just been released.\
    \ The IEEE 802.15.4g amendment\nallows for a redesigned physical layer, allowing\
    \ data rates and communication ranges\ncompatible with neighborhood mesh (wide)\
    \ networks. Then, it is followed by another\ncutting-edge modiﬁcation, known as\
    \ IEEE 802.15.4e, which modiﬁes and enhances\nthe method used by devices to access\
    \ wireless channels while also using time-slotted\nchannel hopping mode. This\
    \ hopping mode further delivers low-power consumption\nand improved dependability.\
    \ From another viewpoint, many researchers customized\nappropriate upper-layer\
    \ protocols (i.e., the Internet Layer). They made the necessary\nmodiﬁcations\
    \ there to make smart applications compatible with conventional infras-\ntructure.\
    \ Since the network of low-power smart devices is conﬁned, the researchers\ndeveloped\
    \ numerous adjustments to the Internet protocols to make them easily adapt-\n\
    able. For example, the most notable IETF projects are RPL [72] and 6LoWPAN [73],\n\
    which greatly aid in creating and adapting smart city scenarios.\n•\nInterference\
    \ problem: Sophisticated technologies that are spread across the same radio\n\
    space and independent radio infrastructures are linked via a range of wireless\
    \ channels.\nBecause of this, the smart application must handle interference problems\
    \ in such\nsituations. To share unlicensed bands, numerous networks must cooperate\
    \ and be\ncompatible with one another.\n•\nVertical handover (soft): Multiple\
    \ radios are used by the rapidly expanding number of\nsmart devices being developed.\
    \ These devices should be able to recognize and use the\nbest interface that is\
    \ currently available while balancing power usage and throughput.\n•\nD2D Communications:\
    \ In the IoT context, there are numerous D2D communication de-\nmands. Unfortunately,\
    \ conventional network gateways cannot handle such generated\nmessages from heterogeneous\
    \ devices.\n•\nShort Communicating Messages: Internet-based protocols support\
    \ and recommend\nacceptable performance for longer data packet scenarios. However,\
    \ smart devices\ncommunicate with one another using short messages (since most\
    \ of them are tiny\nand operate over low-powered battery devices). To this end,\
    \ short communicating\nmessages will positively impact network congestion detection\
    \ and avoidance policies\nand promote in-band aggregation.\n•\nLocal Network Trafﬁc\
    \ Pattern: Smartphones and D2D-speciﬁc devices frequently use the\nsame network\
    \ infrastructure. However, most cellular data networks are exclusively\nplanned,\
    \ implemented, deployed, and managed for smartphone usage. Fitting trafﬁc\nfrom\
    \ these heterogeneous devices onto a single platform is now the main challenge\n\
    that cellular data network providers face. It is difﬁcult to integrate the trafﬁc\
    \ from these\ntwo types of heterogeneous devices into the same network infrastructure\
    \ due to several\nintrinsic factors and the speciﬁed features of this traditional\
    \ network. Additionally,\nD2D devices use a more signiﬁcant proportion of scarce\
    \ resources than smartphones,\nunnecessarily creating a problem of unfairness\
    \ in the system [74]. Therefore, we\nmust ﬁrst comprehend D2D trafﬁc patterns\
    \ and how they differ from trafﬁc patterns\ngenerated by smartphones. Understanding\
    \ trafﬁc patterns can provide insights into\nmanaging and allocating shared network\
    \ resources more effectively and guarantee\nthe highest level of service quality\
    \ for both types of devices.\n•\nSecurity mechanisms: Denial of Service (DoS)\
    \ attacks are a remarkable threat to the\nsecurity of smart city networks and\
    \ must be identiﬁed. Some statistical methods\nhave been proposed to solve this\
    \ problem. Such a statistical method is presented\nin [75] that is based on feature\
    \ distance maps that enhance the statistical analysis\nprocess. Another security\
    \ mechanism is authentication, a process of identifying\nusers and devices in\
    \ a network and granting access to authorized persons and non-\nmanipulated devices.\
    \ Authentication is one method to mitigate attacks on the IoT\nsystems such as\
    \ the reply attack, the Man-in-the-Middle attack, the impersonation\nattack, and\
    \ the Sybil attack [76]. To realize end-to-end security, the nodes must be\nencrypted.\
    \ However, due to the heterogeneity of the IoT systems, some nodes might\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n16 of 63\nbe able to embed general-purpose microprocessors for\
    \ this task. In addition, low\nresources and constrained devices can only embed\
    \ application-speciﬁc integrated\ncircuits. Therefore, conventional cryptographic\
    \ primitives are not suitable for low-\nresource smart devices due to their low\
    \ computation power, limited battery life, small\nsize, small memory, and limited\
    \ power supply. As a result, lightweight cryptography\nmay be an efﬁcient encryption\
    \ for these devices. Trust management is another security\nmechanism that detects\
    \ and eliminates malicious nodes and provides secure access\ncontrol. Automated\
    \ and dynamic trust calculations are needed to validate the trust\nvalues of the\
    \ participating nodes in an IoT network. The majority of trust management\nschemes\
    \ focus on detecting malicious nodes; only a few trust-based access control\n\
    methods have been proposed. In fact, with scalability and the large number of\
    \ smart\nthings storing sensitive data, there is an urgent need for automated,\
    \ transparent, and\neasy access control management so that different nodes/users\
    \ can be granted different\nlevels of access. From another perspective, Blockchain\
    \ technology can be used to\ncreate secure virtual zones where things can identify\
    \ and trust each other [77]. Self-\norganization Blockchain Structures (BCS) can\
    \ also be planned to set up the relationship\nbetween Blockchain and IoT, as suggested\
    \ in [78].\n•\nAnomaly Detection in Sensor Systems: The type of data that ﬂow\
    \ through the IoT system\ncan vary to a great extent, in terms of either format,\
    \ shape (in time and space), and\nsemantics. Therefore, the process of separating\
    \ normal from abnormal sensed data is\nextremely demanding. In the context of\
    \ IoT applications, sensors are the real source\nof big data, which suggests that\
    \ anomaly detection at the edge could be a powerful\ntool to address the inevitable\
    \ data communication bottlenecks. Anomaly detection is\nconcerned with identifying\
    \ data patterns that deviate remarkably from the expected\nbehavior. This is critical\
    \ in the process of ﬁnding out important information about\nthe IoT system’s functioning,\
    \ detecting abnormalities that are often rare or difﬁcult\nto model or, otherwise,\
    \ to predict [79]. A timely identiﬁcation of anomalies is vital to\npreventing\
    \ IoT system failure.\n•\nAdvanced Techniques in Smart City Networks: Artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence (AI), machine learn-\ning (ML), and deep reinforcement learning\
    \ (DRL) play a key role in the evolution of the\nsmart city sectors [80]. These\
    \ techniques are now being developed as solutions for com-\npletely automated\
    \ IoT applications. Using these techniques, the optimal analysis of\nthe big data\
    \ is performed to reach an optimal decision. Utilizing DRL/ML approaches\ncan\
    \ improve security; decrease energy consumption; reduce latency; and increase\n\
    precision and accuracy in surveillance, energy management, air quality prediction,\n\
    person detection, trafﬁc management, etc. For example, an intelligent transportation\n\
    system is highly based on ML- and DRL-based techniques to realize self-driving\
    \ vehi-\ncles and guarantee the security of connected vehicles. DRL techniques\
    \ are also used to\nprecisely monitor and estimate the real-time trafﬁc ﬂow data\
    \ in an urban environment.\nIn SGs, big data analytics and thus the aforementioned\
    \ techniques can enhance the\nsafety of power grids, decision-making of power-sharing,\
    \ management, and power\ngrid performance. In particular, SGs are making effective\
    \ use of smart meter big data\nfor different applications such as load assessment\
    \ and prediction, baseline estimation,\ndemand response, load clustering, and\
    \ malicious data deception attacks. In health\nintelligence, extensive use of\
    \ AI, ML, and DRL techniques is implemented due to\nhigh-performance IoT devices,\
    \ Cloud Computing, and an increase in data rates. These\ntechniques can play a\
    \ vital role in disease diagnosis, cure prediction, social media ana-\nlytics\
    \ for a particular disease, and medical imaging [81]. In cyber-security, the role\
    \ of\nAI-, ML-, and DRL-based techniques is also outstanding. These techniques\
    \ can be used\nfrom an advanced security perspective of IoT to confront security\
    \ threats. Notably, the\naccuracy and precision of the aforementioned techniques\
    \ can be further enhanced by\nincreasing the amount of training data to strengthen\
    \ their learning capabilities and\nhence the automated decision efﬁciencies [82].\n\

    \ \nand protocols that should be evaluated for their applicability for various\

    \ are smart transportation management \nsystems. \nThe protocols from WAN groups,\

    \ of technologies facilitating communication and networking for smart cities\n\
    with IoT-enabled application protocols and suggested networking architectures\
    \ and protocols.\nSCAs involve numerous smart things that operate on low-powered\
    \ battery devices [83].\nNew connectivity solutions are being investigated in\
    \ light of the following question:\ndo the currently available methods, tools,\
    \ and techniques—especially those for wireless\nnetworks—allow for the reliable\
    \ handling of such a large number of smart devices?\nYaqoob et al. [84] provided\
    \ details on current connectivity solutions based on WPAN\ntechnologies such as\
    \ ZigBee, WiFi, Bluetooth, and others that offer low-power D2D com-\nmunication.\
    \ In these technologies, the throughput performance, the number of con-\nnected\
    \ devices, transmission ranges, etc., are severely constrained. Other technologies\n\
    (e.g., WiMAX, LTE, and LTE-A) involve signiﬁcant power consumption and are only\n\
    partially applicable to such settings. IEEE and 3GPP adapt their technologies\
    \ and commu-\nnication strategies to the rapidly expanding IoT-based modern communication\
    \ perspective.\nIEEE 802.11 (WiFi) was initially designed to maintain higher throughput\
    \ performance\nfor fewer stations distributed over a shorter distance in an interior\
    \ context. Due to the\nlimitations of its initial design, this standard does not\
    \ support IoT applications. Hence,\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n18 of 63\nto enable\
    \ IEEE 802.11 adaptive in such circumstances, the community (IEEE 802.11ah\nTask\
    \ Group (TGah)) developed a new power-efﬁcient protocol [55]. They aim to create\
    \ a\nsystem that enables effective communication between several indoor and outdoor\
    \ devices.\nNevertheless, the real-time implementation of IEEE 802.11ah may need\
    \ to be improved by\nthe absence of an appropriate interference mechanism.\nIEEE\
    \ 802.15.1 (Bluetooth), IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee), IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n, Cellular\n\
    3G/4G/5G/LTE/LTE-A, and IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX) are only a few examples of standards\n\
    and protocols that should be evaluated for their applicability for various SCAs.\
    \ Smart\nhome automation systems, smart buildings, and smart garbage systems require\
    \ short-\nrange communication capability and can utilize protocols (e.g., Bluetooth\
    \ and Zigbee) from\nthe WPAN group. These protocols are distinguished by a lower\
    \ bandwidth requirement,\nminimal power usage, and a shorter-range communication\
    \ infrastructure environment.\nIn contrast, LAN groups such as WiFi can be used\
    \ for SCAs that require longer-range\ncommunication. Such applications are smart\
    \ transportation management systems.\nThe protocols from WAN groups, such as Cellular\
    \ and WiMAX, can be adopted by\napplications that need wide-range communication,\
    \ such as smart emergency response\nsystems, weather and air quality monitoring\
    \ systems, and smart grid systems. These\nfeatures designed in terms of standards\
    \ or protocols have enough capability that allows for\nboth synchronous and asynchronous\
    \ data connections. The best-effort trafﬁc (which can\neffectively tolerate latency)\
    \ allows the asynchronous data connections feature to be linked\nwith smart city\
    \ services or applications. Meanwhile, exploring synchronous data connec-\ntions\
    \ is possible for those services or applications that generate trafﬁc mandating\
    \ strict\nQoS standards such as low latency and high accessible network capacity\
    \ [49]. Since IEEE\n802.15.4 (Zigbee) is a short-range (low bit rate) communication\
    \ protocol that often suggests\nhigher ﬂexibility for small devices running on\
    \ low power, such a protocol can signiﬁcantly\nincrease network lifetime. Moreover,\
    \ such a protocol encourages and indicates support\nfor applications and services\
    \ with relatively relaxed latency and throughput conditions in\nWPANs. The authors\
    \ of [85] utilized a WSN based on IEEE 802.15.4 and proposed an intelli-\ngent\
    \ system for lighting applications. The authors highlighted the beneﬁts of using\
    \ wireless\nemulsions: uncomplicatedness in the implementation and deployment,\
    \ relatively easier in\nexpanding a network, and ﬂexibility in the system due\
    \ to the use of wireless technology,\nwhich supports the usage of heterogeneous\
    \ devices in the same implemented and deployed\nstructure. Furthermore, they emphasized\
    \ the advantages of employing the same intelligent\ninfrastructure for a variety\
    \ of services, leading to more effective management, monitoring,\nand cost-effectiveness.\
    \ For example, by including speciﬁc smart metering devices such as\nwater or gas\
    \ meters, the smart network or infrastructure (that was initially established\
    \ to\ntarget smart lighting applications) can also be used for smart metering\
    \ applications.\n5G has just supplanted 4G with advanced access schemes called\
    \ BDMA and FBMC\nmultiple access, which was ﬁrst launched in 2015. In the case\
    \ of BDMA multiple access, an\northogonal beam is frequently used, meaning that\
    \ resources can be distributed in parallel to\neach mobile base station by dividing\
    \ the antenna beam in accordance with the position of\nthe mobile stations to\
    \ enable multiple accesses to the base stations. Successively, this helps\nin\
    \ improving the capacity of 5G networks [86]. Speciﬁcally, the idea of moving\
    \ towards\n5G is based on current technology advancements and particularly on\
    \ unique customer\nneeds. Nonetheless, it is typically presumed that implemented\
    \ 5G cellular networks should\naddress noteworthy complications that are not successfully\
    \ addressed by 4G, i.e., enhanced\nnetwork capacity and data rate, lower End-to-End\
    \ (E2E) latency, reduced cost, and con-\nsistent user QoE provisioning. In addition,\
    \ massive and rapid growth in the number of\nhighly developed connected devices\
    \ leads to a sharp increase in network trafﬁc and a\nwidening range of applications\
    \ with unique dynamic requirements and features. Gupta\nand Jha [86] studied numerous\
    \ facilitators, such as choice or use of spectrum, massive\nMIMO, trafﬁc and power\
    \ management policies, ofﬂoading (local), and self-conﬁguring and\norganizing\
    \ networks, which can address these challenges effectively. Real-time managing\n\
    and supervising in smart city scenarios will be conceivable these days thanks\
    \ to 5G. 5G\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n19 of 63\nultimately targets some networking\
    \ possibilities, i.e., ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Com-\nmunications (uRLLC),\
    \ enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), and massive Machine Type\nCommunications (mMTC).\
    \ In a smart city context, eMBB controls data transfer between a\nvariety of networked\
    \ user end devices, edge devices, or cloud servers. Conversely, mMTC\naims to\
    \ manage huge connected, complex devices, such as wearables, actuators, and sen-\n\
    sors, through dense urban deployment. Finally, uRLLC takes responsibility for\
    \ managing\nhighly time-critical communication such as vehicular communication,\
    \ base stations, and\nedge devices communication [87]. Although 5G has completely\
    \ brought about a new\nrevolution in the ﬁeld of networking, numerous unknown\
    \ challenges still are possible in\nthese cases of communication when 5G is deployed\
    \ in the context of smart cities. One major\nproblem is power-efﬁcient communication,\
    \ especially when communicating low-powered\nbattery devices such as sensors and\
    \ other smart, complex wearables. Additionally, when\ntwo distinct technologies\
    \ (4G/5G) work together, there might be a problem. Speciﬁc device-\nlevel compatibility\
    \ problems might always persist when communication infrastructures\nmigrate to\
    \ next-generation platforms. Moreover, a big question arises, namely, how to\n\
    handle the widespread use of gadgets, particularly those in isolated or difﬁcult-to-reach\n\
    places, as well as the potential high costs associated with building and maintaining\
    \ 5G\nnetworks.\nTable 2 compares protocols used for smart cities, while Table\

    \ of cell boundaries.\nSubsequently, it leads to superior performance in terms\
    \ of\nconsistent connection and capacity (network) [89,91,92].\nP2P\nWAN\nThe\
    \ installation of towers\nto improve signals while\na smart device is in\nmotion\
    \ may result in\nsigniﬁcant costs.\nDevice compatibility is a\nconcern because\
    \ older\nmodels of devices that\ndo not support 4G LTE\ncannot connect to LTE\n\
    networks.\n5G (New Radio (NR) Air\nInterface) (Single Uniﬁed,\n4G + World Wide\n\
    Wireless Web (WWWW))\nThis technology addresses signiﬁcant challenges: a massive\n\
    and quick increase in highly sophisticated connected devices\ncontributes to a\
    \ sharp escalation in network trafﬁc and an\nexpanding variety of applications\
    \ with distinct dynamic\ndemands and features.\nSince LTE user equipment is not\
    \ required to be able to operate\non an NR carrier, NR is designed to be optimized\
    \ for\nperformance without taking backward compatibility into\naccount. Moreover,\
    \ NR can support operations in licensed\nspectrum bands from below 1 GHz to 52.6\
    \ GHz with a\nspectrum expansion facility.\nIn the case of mmWave frequencies,\
    \ excellent capacity and\nhigh data rates are possible. This technology’s ultra-lean\n\
    design seeks to decrease interference and improve system\npower efﬁciency by effectively\
    \ reducing always-on\ntransmissions [93,94].\nThis technology utilizes sophisticated\
    \ access procedures such\nas Beam Division and FBMC Multiple Access to adapt 4G\
    \ to\n5G networks. Beam Division Multiple Access (BDMA)\nschemes’ central design\
    \ principle is concurrently serving\nnumerous mobile users. This technique typically\
    \ uses an\northogonal beam, which suggests that resources can be\nallocated in\
    \ parallel to each mobile base station by separating\nthe antenna beam in accordance\
    \ with the position of the\nmobile stations to enable numerous accesses to the\
    \ base\nstations. This subsequently assists in improving the capacity\nof 5G networks\
    \ [79].\nE2E Network\nSlicing\nWAN\nIn the case of the NLoS\nstate, the effectiveness\

    \ when the\nfrequency changes to\nhigher values. Due to\nhigher frequencies’\n\
    extreme vulnerability to\ninterference from\nobstructions, this\ndisadvantage\
    \ exists.\nSubsequently, this\nhampers the throughput\nperformance of\nunderlying\

    \ 802.11 Standards\nTable 4 presents IEEE 802.11 standards and their features.\n\
    Table 4. IEEE 802.11 standards and their enhancements/features.\nStandards (Year\
    \ Released)\nEnhancement(s)/Feature(s) *\nTarget\nIEEE 802.11 (1997) (Original)\n\
    The standard and its amendments serve as the foundation for\nwireless network\
    \ products bearing the WiFi brand. This signiﬁes\ntwo raw data rates of 1 and\
    \ 2 Mbps that must be transferred via\nDSSS and FHSS at 2.4 GHz in the ISM band.\n\
    Wireless Standard (basic)\nIEEE 802.11b (1999)\nThis standard is intended to operate\
    \ in the 2.4 GHz spectrum;\nhowever, the level of interference issues is higher\
    \ when this\nstandard-based device tries to interoperate with many other\ndevices/standards\
    \ operating on the same band. It can attain a\ntheoretical data rate of 11 Mbps.\
    \ Nevertheless, dynamic\nadaptations can be applied to the transfer rate subject\
    \ to the current\ninterference level and signal power to minimize the error rate\
    \ (ARS\nPolicy). Depending on the channel conditions, the raw data rates\ncan\
    \ be adapted to 5.5 Mbps, 2 Mbps, and 1 Mbps. Additionally, it\nprovides somewhat\
    \ simpler deployment processes (e.g., upgrading\nthe current chipsets) as it demonstrates\
    \ backward compatibility\nwith the original standard due to the use of CDMA and\
    \ DSSS (same\nas the original standard) [89]. The coverage indoor and outdoor\n\
    ranges are 115 feet and 460 feet, respectively.\nWiFi-1\nIEEE 802.11a (1999)\n\
    Designed to operate on the 5 GHz spectrum and to have the least\namount of interference\
    \ compared to other devices. Depending on\nthe needs, the raw data rates can be\
    \ changed to 48 Mbps, 36 Mbps,\n24 Mbps, 18 Mbps, 12 Mbps, 9 Mbps, and 6 Mbps.\
    \ However, it can\nreach a theoretical transfer rate of 54 Mbps. The coverage\
    \ indoor\nand outdoor ranges are 115 feet and 391 feet, respectively [89].\nWiFi-2\n\
    IEEE 802.11g (2003)\nAllows for device compatibility with devices that operate\
    \ and\nfollow IEEE 802.16b standards. It can also attain a theoretical\ntransfer\
    \ rate of 54 Mbps. In real-time situations, it can achieve a\npractical data rate\
    \ of 24 Mbps. Nonetheless, when IEEE\n802.11b-based devices are introduced into\
    \ IEEE 802.11g networks,\nor when these heterogeneous compliant devices interoperate,\
    \ the\nrate decreases drastically to accommodate IEEE 802.11b-based\ntransmission\
    \ speeds every time that the compliant device tries to\ncommunicate [89]. The\
    \ coverage indoor and outdoor ranges are\n148 feet and 296 feet, respectively.\n\
    WiFi-3\nIEEE 802.11e (2005)\nIt speciﬁes a set of QoS augmentations for WLAN applications\n\
    through extensive amendments to the MAC sub-layer. It addressed\nQoS requirements\
    \ by emphasizing two-channel access schemes:\n(1) the contention-based EDCA scheme\
    \ and (2) the contention-free\nHCCA scheme. This standard, via EDCA, provides\
    \ trafﬁc\nprioritization support based on QoS classes (similar to\ndifferentiated\
    \ services). Conversely, this standard suggests\nparameterized QoS (similar to\
    \ integrated services) via HCCA. It\nalso speciﬁes enhancement over the conventional\
    \ IEEE 802.11\npower saver method (APSD) and reduces the signaling load [95].\
    \ It\nis designed to operate at frequencies ranging from 2.4 to\n2.4835 GHz or\
    \ from 5.75 to 5.850 GHz. This standard also speciﬁes\nthat a high transmission\
    \ rate may not be sufﬁcient to meet the QoS\nrequirements imposed by real-time\
    \ audio, voice, video, and\nlive-streaming applications. Following that, the provisions\
    \ of trafﬁc\nprioritization at the MAC sub-layer were insisted upon.\nQoS improvements\n\
    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n24 of 63\nTable 4. Cont.\nStandards (Year Released)\n\
    Enhancement(s)/Feature(s) *\nTarget\nIEEE 802.11n (2009)\nThis standard was suggested\
    \ while keeping the increased speed\nrequirement in mind. Later, it was able to\
    \ boost the attainable\nspeeds of WiFi networks beyond what was possible with\
    \ 802.11g.\nAchieving such high performance required several new features,\nincluding\
    \ a modiﬁed OFDM scheme, power-saving mechanisms,\nantenna technology, MIMO, and\
    \ wider channel bandwidth.\nNonetheless, backward compatibility in the standard\
    \ has been\nsigniﬁcantly affected (reduced) under exceptional scenarios.\nWhenever\
    \ or not an old standard compliance-based device attempts\nto communicate with\
    \ an IEEE 802.11g-based device in an 802.11g\nnetwork, the network’s operation,\
    \ performance, and other\ncapabilities suffer signiﬁcantly. These standard-based\
    \ APs can\noperate in Legacy mode (choosing one standard amongst\n802.11a/b/g),\
    \ Mixed mode (choose (out of 802.11a/b/g/n) and\noperate on heterogeneous conditions),\
    \ and Greenﬁeld mode\n(operate with a single (common) 802.11n altogether) [89].\
    \ It can\nreach a theoretical transfer rate of 600 Mbps. The coverage indoor\n\
    and outdoor ranges are 230 feet and 821 feet, respectively.\nWiFi-4\nIEEE 802.11ac\
    \ (2013)\nThis standard (called initially VHT) was suggested while keeping\nincreased\
    \ speed requirements in mind (likewise with other\nstandards). This standard was\
    \ later able to increase the achievable\nspeeds (up to 1 Gbps (minimum) to 7 Gbps\
    \ (maximum)) of WiFi\nnetworks beyond what 802.11n was capable of. The standard\n\
    enables the transmission of HD videos, online interactive games,\nlive-streaming,\
    \ and other demanding applications. It operates\nusing MU-MIMO technology, which\
    \ enables a single AP and its\nantenna to send data concurrently to several devices.\
    \ As a result,\nthis helps to increase airtime efﬁciency so that every associated\n\
    client—regardless of the 802.11 types it operates on—ﬁnally\nreceives the amount\
    \ of airtime it is supposed to receive, depending\non the technology used.\nWiFi-5\n\
    IEEE 802.11ah (2017)\nDesigned to operate on unlicensed spectrum below 1 GHz,\
    \ it can\nprovide signiﬁcantly more transmission coverage than traditional\n802.11\
    \ standards, which typically operate on 2.4 and 5 GHz bands.\nThis standard can\
    \ be employed in those scenarios where accessible\nbandwidth is comparatively\
    \ narrow. It can normally apply with\nWiFi (outdoor) for performing CTO, large-scale\
    \ WSNs (i.e., smart\ngrid), and extended-range hotspots. Supporting a reasonably\
    \ large\ntransmission range/coverage property aids in managing large-scale\nnetworks\
    \ where the number of devices may be much greater than\nwhat the conventional\
    \ 802.11 standard can support. It advises that\nchanges to the PHY and MAC layers\
    \ be made to provide important\nimprovements including energy-saving capabilities,\
    \ support for\naccommodating a high number of devices, reliable media access\n\
    techniques, and throughput performance improvement by using\nsmall frame formats\
    \ [96].\nExtended coverage, low-power\nWLAN\nIEEE 802.11ax (2021)\nThis standard\
    \ was proposed with the consideration of higher speed\nrequirements. Later, this\
    \ standard increased WiFi network\nachievable speeds above what was made possible\
    \ by earlier\nstandards. Speciﬁcally, it can offer support for a 10 Gbps data\
    \ rate,\nconsistency, and low power consumption. It operates using\nMU-MIMO and\
    \ MU-OFDMA multi-user technologies, which\nenables a single AP and its antenna\
    \ to send data concurrently to\nseveral end devices. Although the 802.11ac standard\
    \ is where\nMU-MIMO technology was ﬁrst introduced, 802.11ax now allows\nfor groups\
    \ of up to eight clients. In addition, this standard also\nsuggests several improvements\
    \ in spatial reusing policies and\npower-saver schemes [97].\nWiFi-6\n* ARS: Adaptive\

    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n25 of 63\n4.2. IEEE 802.15.1\nThe IEEE 802.15.1 (WPAN\
    \ protocol) uses the 2.4 GHz spectrum and a master/slave\ntime division duplex\
    \ mechanism that operates smoothly in the 10 to 100 m range with a\n1 Mbps data\
    \ rate. This technology uses modest data rates for short-range services designed\n\
    to use less power. Recent implementations of this technology include Bluetooth\
    \ and\nBluetooth Low Energy (BLE), offering IP connectivity to aid the IoT [98].\
    \ The deployment\nof services offered for tracking and localization devices is\
    \ typically suggested by BLE-based\ndevices, which are recognized as BLE beacons.\
    \ These beacons produce a signal that other\ncompatible devices can pick up between\
    \ 50 and 70 m away. Using such a beacon promises\ngreater indoor localization\
    \ accuracy than other technologies such as WiFi or GPS. They can\nbe used for\
    \ a wide range of services targeted toward information dissemination, the launch\n\
    of points of sale, user tracking, etc., thanks to this capability. Additionally,\
    \ to provide\nspeciﬁc services of interest, it is frequently required to combine\
    \ the BLE technology with\nother technologies such as WiFi [99]. Originally, the\
    \ aim of BLE technology (Bluetooth\nClassic Radio (BCR)) was to provide a continuous\
    \ wireless connection, i.e., BlueTooth\nBasic Rate/Enhanced Data Rate (BT BR/EDR).\
    \ It became the perfect option for the IoT\nsince it permits connectivity and\
    \ audio-streaming applications using brief bursts of long-\ndistance radio, which\
    \ lowers the battery consumption of mobile devices (because they need\nnot be\
    \ connected all the time). Using the idea of dual-mode chipsets and the new BLE\n\
    speciﬁcation, smartphones or regular phones can be linked to other heterogeneous\
    \ devices\n(such as headphones) in BR/EDR mode. Otherwise, they can be connected\
    \ to wearables\nin LE mode. A low-power radio called BCR, or BT BR/EDR, intends\
    \ to broadcast data\nacross 79 channels in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed frequency range.\
    \ Wireless audio streaming is\nprimarily made possible through BCR, which has\
    \ evolved into the industry-standard radio\nprotocol for in-car entertainment\
    \ systems, wireless speakers, and headphones. BLE aims to\ntransmit data over\
    \ 40 channels in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed frequency range. To facilitate the\ndeployment\
    \ of dependable and large-scale device networks, BLE seeks to provide support\n\
    for a wide range of communication methods, typically P2P; broadcast; and, most\
    \ notably,\nmesh [100]. This unique Bluetooth feature can be used to create distribution\
    \ and locating\nmaps utilizing ﬁngerprint templates for indoor device and user\
    \ localization. Due to BLE’s\ngreater susceptibility to abrupt fading and substantial\
    \ changes in received signal strength,\nit has been proven that using BLE is more\
    \ efﬁcient than using WiFi-based solutions [99,101].\nHowever, Bluetooth technology\
    \ has a problem with increasing power usage, particularly\nwhen its BR/EDR mode\
    \ is used in an IoT context. This is because this mode allows the\nmaster nodes\
    \ to continuously poll the slave nodes, even when there is no data transmission.\n\
    The researchers [102,103] already brought up this issue, addressed it, and offered\
    \ a variety\nof scheduling techniques for polling the slave nodes. Moreover, the\
    \ BR/EDR mode reveals\na lack of scalability that further restricts the performance\
    \ of the system.\n4.3. LoRA\nThe LoRa protocol was primarily used for WAN applications\
    \ and operated as a low-\ndata-rate, low-power technology on the sub-1 GHz spectrum\
    \ that could go up to 10 km.\nLoRa communicates on three classes of bandwidth:\
    \ 125, 250, and 500 KHz. Even while\nthis technology can function at the largest\
    \ bandwidth class, which further improves data\nrate, it still causes issues with\
    \ high power consumption, a shorter communication range,\nand an increase in the\
    \ likelihood of interference because it is free to operate in a wider\nfrequency\
    \ spectrum. This method is founded on the idea of spread spectrum modulation\n\
    and a CSSM variant with a spreading factor ranging from 7 to 12. The transmission\
    \ range\nwill expand as the spreading factor’s value rises, but the power consumption\
    \ will rise\nas well. The CSSM utilizes complete allocated bandwidth, thereby\
    \ making it resilient to\nchannel noise and multi-path fading, but it does not\
    \ differentiate the noise in the channel\nsuch as DSSS. In contrast to the FSK\
    \ modulation approach, which normally identiﬁes\nsignals that are 8 to 10 dB above\
    \ the noise ﬂoor, the CSSM feature enables this technology\nto sense, perceive,\
    \ and capture signals that are 19.5 dB below the noise ﬂoor [103]. Its\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n26 of 63\narchitecture uses a star network topology and includes\
    \ gateways and end nodes. In this\ndesign, end nodes are referred to as slaves\
    \ and run on battery-powered devices with\nlimited power, but gateways are thought\
    \ of as powerful machines that gather data from\nslave nodes. Furthermore, LoRaWAN\
    \ is a communication layer that operates on top of\nLoRA. LoRaWAN incorporates\
    \ the basic LoRa criteria and suggests improved adaptability\nand suitability\
    \ for low-power applications. This layer/technology has advantages over\ncellular\
    \ technologies, which are expected to be battery hungry by the concept. In practice,\n\
    LoRaWAN improved network features and functionalities by addressing the concept\
    \ of\na specialized server (network) and speciﬁcally deﬁning numerous device types\
    \ to meet\nthe needs of each specialized application. Managed communication, packet\
    \ ﬁltering, and\npacket scheduling are all made possible using specialized network\
    \ servers. LoRaWAN\nhas also facilitated bi-directional-employing adaptive transmission\
    \ power and rate, which\naids in optimizing network performance in terms of power\
    \ consumption and throughput.\nThis technology can be employed for a wide range\
    \ of applications, such as smart health\nnursing [104], trafﬁc monitoring [105],\
    \ agriculture monitoring [106], localization [107],\nand smart grid applications\
    \ [108]. In particular, this technology is useful for non-latency-\nsensitive\
    \ applications and those that call for extensive deployments. Haxhibeqiri et al.\
    \ [109]\nand Adelantado et al. [110] emphasized that LoRaWAN is feasible for smart\
    \ metering,\ntracking, and localization-based applications. At the same time,\
    \ it is not so feasible for\nreal-time monitoring and video surveillance.\n4.4.\
    \ WiMAX\nWiMAX can handle high capacity, i.e., a potential peak data rate of 60\
    \ Mbps for an\nentire downlink operation and a rate of 28 Mbps for an entirely\
    \ uplink operation, based on\nthe original IEEE 802.16 air interface standard\
    \ (2004) [111] and the IEEE 802.16e amend-\nment [112]. It can be done using two\
    \ antennas with a channel bandwidth of 10 MHz.\nAdditionally, it may provide support\
    \ for multimedia services with different trafﬁc charac-\nteristics and wide area\
    \ mobility with changing QoS needs. Additionally, it offers a variety\nof QoS\
    \ scheduling options for accommodating heterogeneous trafﬁc, such as Internet\
    \ data\ntrafﬁc, VoIP (Voice over IP), classic audio trafﬁc, and voice and video\
    \ streams [113].\nTable 5 shows the speciﬁed WiMAX standards and their operational\
    \ parameters [114].\nThis standard provides a communication channel between geographically\
    \ separated de-\nvices. As a result, the maximum achievable covered distance ranges\
    \ between 30 km and\n100 km. However, this technology has some drawbacks, such\
    \ as high installation costs\nand the possibility of complications and irregularities\
    \ when dealing with high-deﬁnition\nmultimedia trafﬁc.\nWireless network trafﬁc\
    \ has recently increased extraordinarily due to the rapid pro-\nliferation of\
    \ smart handheld devices, sensors, and actuators. These devices, along with\n\
    smart controllers, mobile users, and other smart services-based specialized devices,\
    \ are\nthe most common use cases for W-LANs in dense network environments. In\
    \ such a dense\nnetwork environment, interference is a critical issue that must\
    \ be addressed if satisfactory\nperformance and, thus, proﬁcient spatial frequency\
    \ reuse is required. Subsequently, the\nstandards IEEE 802.11 were designed and\
    \ implemented to support these requirements.\nNumerous international organizations,\
    \ including IEEE and 3GPP, adopted and improved\ntheir technologies in response\
    \ to changing needs and the emerging IoT market. For instance,\nthe original IEEE\
    \ 802.11 (WiFi) standard was designed to support and provide superior\nthroughput\
    \ performance to a small number of stations located close to each other, and as\
    \ a\nresult, this technology was not particularly useful for IoT systems. As a\
    \ result, to address\nthe challenges and requirements of IoT, the IEEE 802.11ah\
    \ Task Group (TG) was formed by\nthe IEEE 802.11 MAN/LAN Standards Committee to\
    \ redesign and extend the applicability\nof WiFi standards to IoT scenarios. They\
    \ focused on the critical issue of power-aware\nefﬁcient schemes and protocols\
    \ to extend the functionality and applicability of 802.11-based\nnetworks while\
    \ dealing with a variety of small power-constrained smart outdoor and\nindoor\
    \ devices [55,97].\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n27 of 63\nTable 5. WiMAX standards\

    \ Protocol Suite\nIn IoT, smart sensing motes, devices, and actuators share unique\
    \ features such as\nconstrained memory, power, and processing capabilities; the\
    \ need for facilitating real-time\nrequirements of smart applications; extremely\
    \ vulnerable radio environments; and little to\nno human involvement after deployment\
    \ [115]. By enabling communication amongst these\ndevices utilizing low-power-cost\
    \ technologies, a new infrastructure for deployed smart\nservices has been formed.\
    \ Researchers [116] argued that the TCP/IP protocol suite might\nprovide a solution\
    \ and be ﬂexible enough for a variety of evolving IoT communication\nscenarios.\
    \ Unfortunately, there were additional challenges that network administrators,\n\
    designers, and researchers had to overcome. Researchers were searching for the\
    \ best way\nto install IPv6-based sensor motes that can effectively/minimally\
    \ use the system’s limited\nresources (i.e., power and bandwidth). Because of\
    \ such power constraints, researchers\nhighlighted the requirements of low-power\
    \ Layer-2 technologies (i.e., BLE, IEEE 802.15.4)\nand low-power WiFi usage. In\
    \ contrast with traditional Ethernet links, these technologies\noperate with smaller\
    \ maximum transmission unit (MTU) sizes and slower transmission\nspeeds. IoT network\
    \ protocol designers faced a problem in adapting to and determining\nthe ideal\
    \ MTU size. Another obstacle is that IoT networks often are based solely on wireless\n\
    networks and thus they can only communicate using wireless mesh technologies.\
    \ This\nvulnerability brings extra challenges in front of TCP/IP architecture:\n\
    (1)\nThe current IP addressing model cannot assist mesh communication (since it\
    \ relies on\na multi-link subnet prototype) at all.\n(2)\nIn mesh communication,\
    \ the multicasting and broadcasting communication methods are\nquite expensive,\
    \ power-demanding, and prohibitive as the network nodes are extremely\npower constrained.\
    \ Moreover, unicasting is the only remaining alternative method.\n(3)\nUnicasting\
    \ is power intensive in and of itself because it may take many hops while\nforwarding\
    \ and may wake up an excessive number of nodes that are asleep. Notably,\nidle\
    \ nodes and hops can modify the radio state’s operation mode to save power. Ad-\n\
    ditionally, a large amount of power is used and saved by a node during transmission,\n\
    reception, overhearing, idle, and sleeping phases [117]. However, to ensure successful\n\
    delivery, we cannot just alter the operational modes. Instead, it requires effective\n\
    coordination and intricate synchronization [117,118].\n(4)\nThere is a high requirement\
    \ for scalable routing/forwarding schemes for IP communi-\ncation to take place\
    \ over mesh architectural systems.\n(5)\nFor many IoT applications requiring data\
    \ prioritizing and customized control, original\nTCP-suited features such as those\
    \ operational on ﬁxed MSS sizes (such as MTU sizes)\nthat further lead to silly\
    \ window syndrome or in-order byte-stream delivery to ensure\ndependability, are\
    \ unsuitable [119]. Nonetheless, the IETF started deﬁning standard\nInternet protocols\
    \ such as RPL [120] for such specialized environments to minimize\nprotocol overheads\
    \ that impair the computing ability and memory management of\nthese specialized\
    \ resource-constrained devices.\nWiFi-based infrastructure networks enable backhauling\
    \ support, which helps estab-\nlish and sustain seamless connectivity among smart\
    \ IoT devices. In smart home wireless\nnetworks, this form of connectivity can\
    \ be provided through TCP connections. The TCP/IP\nprotocol suite supports dependable\
    \ data delivery and congestion control strategies to main-\ntain network throughput\
    \ performance via TCP at Layer-4. TCP is a protocol that has been\nregularly modiﬁed\
    \ and improved over the years to effectively transport large amounts of\nbyte-stream\
    \ in-ordered data via resilient P2P connections with comparatively lower latency\n\
    needs. IoT services deal with atypical communication patterns, for which TCP/IP\
    \ protocol\nsuite-based protocols, such as TCP, are unable to handle such patterns\
    \ adequately [119].\nThere are severe problems that TCP faces when it deals with\
    \ an IoT application:\n(1)\nTCP connection establishment and termination (three-way\
    \ handshaking) incur signiﬁ-\ncant overhead in the system as most communication\
    \ in an IoT application includes\nthe transmission of brief segments and relatively\
    \ little data.\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n29 of 63\n(2)\nTCP functionality needs\
    \ resilient P2P connections. It is impossible to sustain these con-\nnections\
    \ in an IoT network environment because smart sensors and other connected\ndevices\
    \ switch their mode of radio state from active to sleep phase persistently [119].\n\
    (3)\nSome IoT applications might need broadcast and multicast communication patterns,\n\
    and enabling such patterns via TCP will result in substantial network overhead\
    \ in the\nentire IoT system and high-power consumption.\n(4)\nSome IoT services\
    \ have very granular delay requirements, and any extra delay in\nthe form of connection\
    \ establishment or MSS creation (waiting for data to ﬁll the\nentire MSS) is completely\
    \ unacceptable for their performance. Thus, TCP is unable to\nprovide much support\
    \ for these IoT services.\n(5)\nIoT applications that rely on wireless communication\
    \ scenarios must deal with crit-\nical wireless channel characteristics such as\
    \ channel error, interference, and wire-\nless interface properties that result\
    \ in buffer-induced, channel-induced, link-layer\ncontention-induced, and collision-induced\
    \ packet losses. When TCP operates in such\na setting, its stringent in-order\
    \ delivery requirements and retransmission policies\n(i.e., fast retransmission)\
    \ may occasionally result in very serious system problems\nsuch as Head-of-Line\
    \ (HoL) or Receiver Buffer Blocking, which ultimately results in\na reduction\
    \ in throughput, delay, and power consumption performance [121–124].\nFurthermore,\
    \ wireless MAC methods that use MAC-level retransmissions may fur-\nther impair\
    \ TCP’s performance, if Layer-2 retransmission latency exceeds the TCP\nRetransmission\
    \ Time Out timer.\nSome standards, such as BACnet/IP [125], were proposed to implement\
    \ Layer-4\nfunctionalities at the Application Layer (AppL) itself and proposed\
    \ to utilize UDP as an\nunderlying Layer-4 protocol. Managing packet losses should\
    \ depend on an application’s\nrequirements, which may vary from application to\
    \ application. However, TCP and its\nupdated variants rely on the concept of data\
    \ delivery deferment and try to perform retrans-\nmissions from an already created\
    \ copy in the sender buffer. However, this is not the only\napproach to dealing\
    \ with packet losses in the network. Another method is for AppL to\naccept packet\
    \ delivery that is not completely ﬂawless and proceed with its current opera-\n\
    tions. This feature will be helpful in real-time audio and video distribution.\
    \ Additionally,\nretransmission is an additional option. However, AppL should\
    \ handle this retransmission\nrather than an underlying Layer-4 protocol such\
    \ as TCP. In terms of buffering the lost data\nbits, doing so enables the source\
    \ application to reconstruct them. Furthermore, in situations\nwhere real-time\
    \ services are severely constrained, the transmitting application may transmit\n\
    fresh data instead of retransmitting lost data to “repair” the effects of the\
    \ initial loss [126].\nClark and Tennenhouse [126] concluded these concepts and\
    \ subsequently introduced the\nconcept of Application Level Framing (ALF). Implementing\
    \ Layer-4 facilities at AppL itself\nbrings the idea of employing ALF into the\
    \ system. Hence, utilizing the notion of ALF,\na network can recognize individual\
    \ Application Data Units (ADUs), and subsequently\ncan offer support for ﬂexible\
    \ Layer-4 facilities, i.e., employing adaptive retransmission\nprocedures for\
    \ diverse forms of ADUs and disseminating data more effectively by using\nin-network\
    \ caching. Unluckily, the TCP/IP protocol suite forbids applications from adding\n\
    any application semantics into network-level packet structure. Therefore, it fails\
    \ to provide\nsupport for the ALF scheme [119].\n4.6. Compound TCP for IoT\nCompound\
    \ TCP [127] was initially designed to offer support for improved channel\nutilization\
    \ and fairness performances. It will play a signiﬁcant role in home networks with\n\
    WiFi-assisted smart and standard devices [115,128].\nPokhrel and Williamson [115]\
    \ studied the effectiveness of a compound TCP over an\nIoT scenario involving\
    \ sensors and other devices (i.e., smartphones, laptops, PC, and home\nappliances).\
    \ They analyzed and evaluated the scenario improving the performance of con-\n\
    nections made using the examined TCP variant across infrastructure WiFi networks\
    \ in the\npresence of signiﬁcant buffer-overﬂow-induced losses and severely degraded\
    \ transmission\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n30 of 63\nchannel circumstances. The\
    \ authors also addressed the varying bandwidth requirements\nfor all IoT devices\
    \ as well as ubiquitous connectivity, ranging from traditional bandwidth-\nhungry\
    \ Internet devices to low-power gadgets. The authors of [129] demonstrated a\n\
    thorough evaluation of the steady-state performance of TCP via WiFi-assisted classical\n\
    devices considering the situations of high-buffer-overﬂow-induced losses and signiﬁcantly\n\
    deteriorated transmission channel conditions. The authors of [115,129] suggested\
    \ models\nthat aided in capturing the dynamics of congestion and ﬂow control of\
    \ several concurrently\nrunning competitive long-lived compound TCP connections.\
    \ In evaluating and developing\nthese models, they considered MAC-level retransmissions,\
    \ link-layer contention, channel\nfailures, and collision. The authors of [130]\
    \ utilized a transient model suggesting a new\nqueue management scheme to capture\
    \ the interactions of short-lived TCP ﬂows (the most\nworkable ﬂows in IoT scenarios)\
    \ over conventional trafﬁc patterns over WiFi networks.\nHowever, the performance\
    \ of TCP in WiFi networks is constrained, especially when using\na single shared\
    \ Access Points (APs). As a result, TCP might not be able to scale well and\n\
    provide superior performance in wide-area Industry 4.0 networks, especially when\
    \ wireless\nchannels are often reused by several APs [131].\n4.7. Viewpoints of\
    \ Network Layer Routing for IoT Systems\nThe network architectures for IoT are\
    \ heterogeneous and include WiFi, WSNs, Wireless\nMesh Networks (WMNs), Vehicular\
    \ Networks, and Mobile Communication Networks\n(MCNs) (5G/LTE/4G/3G) [132]. Due\
    \ to the large-scale production of intelligent sensing\ndevices, survivability\
    \ and self-organization of deployed functional networks are essential. A\nWSN\
    \ is deployed for a variety of smart agricultural, environmental, domestic, and\
    \ military\napplications. It is an ad-hoc network with no infrastructure, in which\
    \ the sensor nodes\ncommunicate over multi-hop routing. WSNs run on battery-powered,\
    \ low-power sensors\ncapable of sensing, collecting, processing, aggregating,\
    \ and regulating communication.\nNumerous WSN-based platforms, including MICA2,\
    \ TelosB, and MICAz MOTE, have\nbeen suggested. Therefore, some standards were\
    \ introduced to enable interaction and\nother compatibilities among these numerous\
    \ heterogeneous platforms. For example, the\nIEEE802.15.4 (Zigbee) standard creates\
    \ the WSNs backbone as part of the IoT. WSNs provide\ncritical functionalities\
    \ for developing IoT systems, allowing Low-Powered battery-operated\nEnd Devices\
    \ (LPEDs) with very minimal resources to attach to the Internet. A WSN can be\n\
    considered a special form of LoWPAN consisting of several equipped sensor nodes.\
    \ Due\nto the lack of IP communication infrastructure, interoperability must be\
    \ obtained from the\nviewpoint of WSN and the Internet. To address the interoperability\
    \ issue, various works\nsuggested a standardized arrangement that could enable\
    \ the usage of IP over LoWPAN.\nThe IEEE 802.15.4 standard allows for the interoperability\
    \ for Low power and Lossy\nNetworks (LLNs). The design tenet of this standard\
    \ outlines the physical and data link\nlayers of the network and offers a low-cost\
    \ framework for network operations. To link\nLPEDs to the Internet, 6LoWPAN may\
    \ be used as an adaptation layer to enable sensors\nto implement an IP stack and\
    \ become approachable by other conventional devices over\nthe Internet. This adaptability\
    \ layer also supports end-to-end connectivity, which enables\na variety of applications\
    \ and permits these LPEDs to implement routing and forwarding\nalgorithms at the\
    \ Internet layer. However, the current network layer routing policies cannot\n\
    be supported when the number of nodes grows. Therefore, the RPL protocol [72]\
    \ considers\nthe LLN situation [133]. Most of the nodes in LLNs are resource-constrained,\
    \ and they are\nconnected by some lossy links that only support low data rates.\
    \ These links are thought\nto be extremely unstable and have poor performance\
    \ in terms of packet delivery rates. In\nsuch specialized networks, the trafﬁc\
    \ patterns are often P2MP and MultiPoint-2-MultiPoint\n(MP2MP) rather than just\
    \ P2P [72]. These networks contain hundreds of smart devices.\nThis makes the\
    \ implementation of routing policies more difﬁcult than ever. In addition,\nnumerous\
    \ existing traditional ad-hoc wireless network routing methods, such as DSR and\n\
    AODV, cannot manage these unique situations and unforeseen circumstances. Designing\n\
    and implementing routing in ad-hoc networking settings has been more difﬁcult\
    \ due to the\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n31 of 63\nmobility aspect and the resource\
    \ limitations at wireless nodes. Their forwarding policies’\ndesign principles\
    \ emphasize QoS elements including bandwidth usage and end-to-end\nlatency [134,135].\
    \ The forwarding rules frequently created and applied for WSNs situations\ntake\
    \ into account the increase in the network lifetime by effectively utilizing the\
    \ node\nenergy [117,136]. As these ad-hoc networks were designed to operate and\
    \ maintain solely\ninside their operational infrastructure, this was very feasible.\
    \ However, the interoperability\nof these ad-hoc networks is a major problem when\
    \ such networks are integrated with\nIoT networks. The ad-hoc network integration\
    \ with IoT needs novel routing policies\nthat support scalability and assure QoS,\
    \ fairness, and connectivity between two nodes\n(both in APs and ad-hoc networks)\
    \ with the least amount of power consumption. The\nstandard classical forwarding\
    \ strategies were intended to ensure QoS between a pair of\ndevices/nodes. In\
    \ the case of an IoT environment, the routing procedures should suggest\nenough\
    \ fairness so that each node can sufﬁciently get enough chances to communicate\
    \ with\nnearby APs. For such specialized scenarios, hierarchical routing solutions\
    \ are followed\nto decrease data redundancy and ensure data aggregation. Researchers\
    \ have often raised\nconcerns about the disadvantaged forwarding rules, which\
    \ lead to the consumption of\nexcess energy in networks while taking into account\
    \ mobile and static ad-hoc network\nscenarios. It consequently increases the likelihood\
    \ of frequent network disconnections,\nroute failures, and even network partitioning,\
    \ all contributing to the system’s signiﬁcant\nMAC-level and routing-level overhead\
    \ problems [134,135]. Hence, bearing in mind the\nhigh-power consumption problem,\
    \ many researchers presented numerous smart routing\nparadigms [118,134,135,137].\
    \ Still, many of these suggested schemes failed to achieve the\ndesired QoS.\n\
    Cross-layer design-based recommendations for power consumption and congestion\n\
    control are well-suited design proposals for comprehending the changes in wireless\
    \ channel\nattributes. Therefore, signiﬁcant work has been done in these areas.\
    \ These designs provide\nsupport for dynamically accessing and evaluating extremely\
    \ variable channel parameters\nat lower layers (MAC and PHY) for the Internet/Routing\
    \ and Transport layers to further\noptimize forwarding and congestion window adaptations\
    \ decisions [121,134,135,138–140].\nThe Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)\
    \ indicates how well a device can hear a\nsignal from an AP or router. A network\
    \ layer forwarding policy can effectively utilize the\nRSSI (accessible through\
    \ lower layers dynamically) to assess link quality. AODV and DSR\nare examples\
    \ of the traditional ad-hoc routing protocols used in various smart forwarding\n\
    systems designed for IoT scenarios. The AOMDV IoT [141] and MLB [142] routing\
    \ mecha-\nnisms were suggested for the IoT scenarios and talked about node and\
    \ link disjoint paths\nwhile discovering routes. However, the proposed schemes\
    \ do not shed light and discuss\nanything related to performance issues when there\
    \ is a signiﬁcant level of interference in\nthe network because of trafﬁc running\
    \ parallel onto multiple paths. The abovementioned\ntechniques do not always perform\
    \ well in terms of throughput and end-to-end delay.\nRecently, the scheme [140]\
    \ considered different critical factors such as interference level,\nlink-layer\
    \ contentions, routing load, MAC load, and other performance issues related to\n\
    wireless scenarios. The authors of [140] insisted that multipath load distribution\
    \ policies’\nefﬁciency depends on the distribution (physical) of routes. Nevertheless,\
    \ different possible\ndisjoint routes—those lacking any common nodes or links—might\
    \ be able to interfere\nwith one another due to the radio signals’ predicted broadcasting\
    \ behavior in wireless\ncommunication. Consequently, such separate disconnected\
    \ pathways could be utilized to\nenhance the performance of the network as a whole\
    \ [138,140].\nWhen employing an IoT-based system, the end sensor nodes depend\
    \ on WSN-based\nnetworking connectivity to deliver sensed and collected data from\
    \ smart things to sink\nnodes. These nodes are commonly known as IoT GateWay nodes\
    \ (IoT-GW). To balance\nenergy usage and gather crucial sensor data, numerous\
    \ such static and mobile IoT-GWs\ncan be deployed in the system. In the whole\
    \ system, numerous WSNs, gathering numerous\ntypes of critical data, are connected\
    \ to the Internet [142,143]. Originally, Zigbee speciﬁed\nthree forms of devices:\
    \ Zigbee Coordinator, Zigbee Router, and Zigbee End Device, and\nElectronics 2023,\
    \ 12, 2490\n32 of 63\nthree forms of network topologies: tree, star, and mesh.\
    \ Moreover, the Zigbee stack\nembraces AODV to create paths dynamically. In the\
    \ case of star network topology, the\nReduced and Fully Functional Devices (i.e.,\
    \ RFDs and FFDs) can communicate with the\nPAN central coordinator only. They\
    \ are not capable of communicating with one another.\nHere, the PAN coordinator\
    \ may be powered by mains, while the RFDs and FFDs run on\nlow-powered limited\
    \ battery devices. Moreover, in the case of the mesh network topology,\nany device\
    \ can communicate to within-range devices at a point of time. Moreover, this\n\
    topology contains a PAN coordinator, which can communicate with other RFDs and\
    \ FFDs.\nFurthermore, this networking topology offers support for the usage of\
    \ the integrated\nforwarding scheme united with hierarchical/tree and AODV routing\
    \ procedures. Lastly,\nthe tree (cluster) network topology is a subset form of\
    \ mesh networking topology, consisting\nof RFDs and FFDs (which may act as coordinators).\
    \ However, the FFD count could be\nmore than the RFD count in the network. RFDs\
    \ may attach to tree (cluster) network\ntopology as the end nodes in the system.\
    \ The coordinator FFDs can offer synchronization\nfunctionalities to other connected\
    \ coordinators and devices. However, there will be a single\nPAN coordinator amongst\
    \ these coordinators [144].\n4.8. IoT Application Protocols\nEach IoT application\
    \ is based on IoT application layer protocols for data transfer.\nThese protocols\
    \ can be the following:\n•\nRepresentational State Transfer Hypertext Transfer\
    \ Protocol (REST HTTP): HTTP [145] is\nthe primary client/server protocol that\
    \ adopts the request/response model. HTPP has\nbeen related to the REST architecture\
    \ [146] to ease the interaction between dissimilar\nentities over web-based services.\
    \ The mixture of HTTP and REST enables IoT devices\nto make their status readily\
    \ available in terms of the standardized CRUD (create, read,\nupdate, delete)\
    \ functions [147]. The CRUD functions are mapped to the POST, GET,\nPUT, and DELETE\
    \ techniques of HTTP, correspondingly. In this fashion, we can build\na REST model\
    \ for dissimilar IoT devices [148].\n•\nConstrained Application Protocol (CoAP)\
    \ [149]: It is a lightweight RESTful protocol lately\nstandardized by the Internet\
    \ Engineering Task Force (IETF). CoAP is used by IoT\ndevices for IP-based, HTTP-like\
    \ interactions. It uses UDP with acknowledgment mes-\nsages to set up reliable\
    \ communication based on a request/response interaction. It has\nreduced complexity,\
    \ and thus it is suitable for resource-constrained IoT applications\nand machine-to-machine\
    \ (M2M) communication.\n•\nMessage Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) [150] is\
    \ established for IoT messaging.\nAccording to MQTT design principles, network\
    \ bandwidth and device resource re-\nquirements should be kept to a minimum while\
    \ also aiming to assure dependability\nand some level of delivery assurance. Since\
    \ June 2016, MQTT has been recognized by\nISO as a standard (ISO/IEC 20922). The\
    \ protocol continues to progress by formalizing\npopular capability options and\
    \ adding new functionalities. The most recent version,\nMQTT v5.0, was released\
    \ in 2018. MQTT operates according to a publish/subscribe\nparadigm. Clients connect\
    \ to a centralized broker when using MQTT.\n•\nOpen Platform Communications Uniﬁed\
    \ Architecture (OPC UA) [151]: This interoper-\nability standard is used for the\
    \ secure and reliable exchange of data in the industrial\nautomation domain and\
    \ other industries. It is platform independent and ensures\nthe seamless ﬂow of\
    \ information among IoT devices from multiple vendors. It sup-\nports two different\
    \ communication methods: the Client/Server method as well as\nPublish/Subscribe\
    \ (e.g., over UDP or MQTT) to mainly meet different industry re-\nquirements from\
    \ the production systems to edge and cloud scenarios. Today, the main\nIoT vendors\
    \ including IBM, AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft, and SIEMENS leverage\nsecure, standardized\
    \ information exchange in edge-to-cloud applications based on\nOPC UA.\n•\nExtensible\
    \ Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) [152]: This extensible protocol is\n\
    based on text messages that use XML (Extensible Mark-up Language), through which\n\
    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n33 of 63\nit can implement both request/response and\
    \ publish/subscribe methods by using\nsuitable extensions. XMPP exchanges instant\
    \ messages between clients, and this\nhappens in real-time using a push mechanism\
    \ to avoid increasing unnecessary network\nloads. XMPP also determines the state\
    \ of an XMPP entity as online, ofﬂine, busy, etc.\n•\nAdvanced Message Queuing\
    \ Protocol (AMQP) [153]: An open standard for passing\nbusiness messages between\
    \ applications or organizations using TCP. It connects sys-\ntems, feeds business\
    \ processes with the information they need, and reliably transmits\nonward the\
    \ instructions that achieve their goals using the point/point and pub-\nlish/subscribe\
    \ interaction modes. AMQP was designed to achieve the main goals of\nmessage orientation;\
    \ queuing; routing; security; reliability; and interoperability.\n•\nData Distribution\
    \ Service (DDS) [154]: DDS was developed by the Open Management\nGroup (OMG).\
    \ DDS is a real-time M2M protocol that enables dependable, high-\nperformance,\
    \ interoperable, scalable data exchanges using a publish–subscribe pattern.\n\
    DDS provides low-latency data connectivity, high reliability, and scalability\
    \ in publish–\nsubscribe and request/response patterns over TCP and UDP. The needs\
    \ of various\nIoT applications requiring real-time data exchange can be addressed\
    \ using DDS. Such\napplications are air trafﬁc control, transportation systems,\
    \ autonomous vehicles, and\nsmart grid management.\nLastly, Glaroudis et al. [155]\
    \ provided a comparison among IoT application protocols\nin terms of well-accepted\
    \ key performance indicators and discussed their suitability in the\nframework\
    \ of smart farming.\n5. Networking Architectures and Protocols\n5.1. Generic Architectures\n\
    Zanella et al. [37] provided an in-depth analysis of an urban IoT’s enabling technolo-\n\
    gies, protocols, and architecture. They also demonstrated the implementation of\
    \ an IoT\nisland as a proof-of-concept in the Italian City of Padova. In the IoT,\
    \ two methods provide\ndata access to objects/things. The ﬁrst involves deploying\
    \ multi-hop mesh networks with\nshort-range communication among network nodes\
    \ using unlicensed frequency. The second\ninvolves using licensed frequency band\
    \ long-range cellular technologies (e.g., 2G/GSM).\nCentenaro et al. [156] presented\
    \ a hopeful alternative solution (i.e., a new type of wire-\nless connectivity)\
    \ called Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs). LPWAN is based\non a star topology\
    \ characterized by low-rate, long-range transmission technologies in\nthe unlicensed\
    \ sub-GHz frequency bands. The authors considered LPWAN to provide\nconnectivity\
    \ in the IoT scenario for a characteristic SCA. Furthermore, they discussed\n\
    the advantages of LPWAN over well-known methods regarding effectiveness, efﬁciency,\n\
    and architectural design. Leccese et al. [157] created a Raspberry-Pi Card-controlled\
    \ SCA\nthat uses a ZigBee Sensor Network and WiMAX to provide completely controlled\
    \ street\nlighting. Sanchez et al. [158] described SmartSantander, an IoT experimental\
    \ research\nfacility that was deployed in Santander City, Spain. SmartSantander\
    \ supports testing\nproposed protocols, services, and conﬁgurations in a realistic\
    \ setting at an appropriate\nscale. Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication is\
    \ a signiﬁcant part of IoT. Vilajosana\nand Dohler [159] reviewed currently used\
    \ smart city M2M technologies (i.e., sensors, data\nloggers, wireless modems,\
    \ and gateway). They considered one of the most famous deploy-\nment use cases,\
    \ i.e., smart parking. In any IoT environment for smart cities, a huge amount\n\
    of M2M communication requests occur. Unfortunately, conventional network gateways\n\
    cannot face this challenge. Huang et al. [160] presented an admission control\
    \ model for\nM2M communications. Their model differentiates all M2M requests into\
    \ delay-sensitive\nand delay-tolerant. Then, it aggregates all delay-tolerant\
    \ requests by routing them into\none low-priority queue, aiming to reduce the\
    \ number of requests from various devices\nto the access point in the IoT for\
    \ smart cities. Silva et al. [161] developed the bottom-up\narchitecture after\
    \ analyzing a variety of existing architectures. This architecture has four\n\
    layers: sensing, transmission, data management, and application. Each layer integrates\n\
    security modules to protect sensitive data. The sensing layer, located at the\
    \ bottom of the\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n34 of 63\narchitecture, collects\
    \ data from physical devices. The transmission layer is located above\nthe sensing\
    \ layer. Several communication technologies are used to transmit data from the\n\
    transmission layer to the (upper) data management layer. The data management layer\n\
    performs data fusion, data analysis, data processing, and data storing. It stores\
    \ valuable\ninformation that various applications use at the application layer\
    \ to provide services.\nThe majority of the above works mainly focus on a single\
    \ characteristic, such as quality\nof service [162].\nMarques et al. [163] proposed\
    \ a generic, multilevel IoT-based smart cities infrastructure\nmanagement architecture\
    \ that allows the integration of physical objects, communication\ninfrastructure,\
    \ cloud platform, and IoT-based services in a pervasive way. This architecture\n\
    (Figure 4) is generic and includes four layers: (1) Physical Objects, (2) Communication,\n\
    (3) Cloud Platform, and (4) Services.\nElectronics 2023, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW\

    35 of 63\nare processed by a NodeMCU, which communicates with a Local Processing\
    \ unit\nresponsible for gathering information used by the application providing\
    \ a service.\nThe local processing unit brings elements of edge computing, as\
    \ it pushes part of the\ncomputation to edge nodes instead of relying on concentrating\
    \ all the computation in\na centralized remote server.\n2.\nThe Communication\
    \ Layer: The architecture supports a variety of network access\ntechnologies.\
    \ The communication layer supports the implementation of various\nwireless technologies.\
    \ The local processing unit located at the Physical Objects Layer\ndeﬁnes the\
    \ technology to be used and relays data to the communication layer using\nthe\
    \ interface of a network access point.\n3.\nThe Cloud Platform Layer provides\
    \ three services: processing, database queries, and\ndata storage. In the context\
    \ of providing services for smart cities, each of these services\ncan be dynamically\
    \ allocated to satisfy the needs of various applications. Notably,\nonly some\
    \ applications and service types require a cloud platform to operate correctly.\n\
    This layer is offered as part of the infrastructure provided, and its implementation\n\
    is optional.\n4.\nThe Services Layer implements four groups, which are called\
    \ classes of services:\n(I) Surveillance, (II) Transportation and Logistics, (III)\
    \ Infrastructure, and (IV) Tech-\nnology. In each class, different kinds of applications\
    \ can be implemented to deal with\nthe challenges of smart cities.\nThis architecture\
    \ is a generic solution, so the underlying layers are designed to offer\nsupport\
    \ to the applications. Therefore, it can be adapted to the speciﬁc implementa-\n\
    tion of a given service. To this end, the authors adapted their architecture to\
    \ a waste\nmanagement scenario.\nAnother multi-level smart city architecture [164]\
    \ was built on semantic web technolo-\ngies, and its design is mostly used in\
    \ smart city wireless sensor network applications. Data\ncollection, data processing,\
    \ integration and reasoning, and device control and alerts make\nup its four layers.\
    \ Using ontology, a data model, at the network’s edge, Gheisari et al. [165]\n\
    suggested a novel architecture for IoT devices in the smart city that protects\
    \ privacy.\nSaadeh et al. [166] proposed a four-layer architecture for mobile\
    \ object authentication in the\ncontext of IoT smart cities. Their architecture\
    \ is based on the applicability of a proposed hier-\narchical elliptic curve identity-based\
    \ signature authentication protocol. Naranjo et al. [167]\npresented a Fog-based\
    \ smart city network architecture called FogC Architecture Network\n(FOCAN). To\
    \ reduce latency and increase the efﬁciency of services among things with\nvarious\
    \ capabilities, FOCAN is a multi-tier framework in which the applications operating\n\
    on things collaborate to compute, route, and interact with one another through\
    \ the smart\ncity environment. One of FOCAN’s primary beneﬁts is that the IoT\
    \ device can deliver\nservices effectively and with less energy consumption.\n\
    5.2. SDN-IoT Architectures\nSoftware-deﬁned networking (SDN) [168] is an approach\
    \ to enable ﬂexible and efﬁ-\ncient network conﬁguration to enhance a network.\
    \ SDN can provide many advantages\nfor conﬁguring city networks to support different\
    \ applications. For example, SDN can\nimprove the QoS of city networks against\
    \ link failures [169] and meet smart city latency de-\nmands [170]. While some\
    \ efforts are investigating this approach for supporting SCAs, there\nis room\
    \ for developing more advanced management and networking mechanisms in SDN\nfor\
    \ efﬁcient, reliable, and secure network conﬁgurations in smart cities. Jazaeri\
    \ et al. [171]\nconsidered the advantages of integrating edge computing, SDN,\
    \ and IoT technologies and\nreviewed different frameworks and platforms.\nLiu\
    \ et al. [172] proposed an architecture that decouples urban sensing applications\n\
    from the physical infrastructure. In their architecture, centralized controllers\
    \ manage\nphysical devices and offer APIs for data acquisition, transmission,\
    \ and processing services\nto develop urban sensing applications. Bi et al. [173]\
    \ proposed a scalable SDN-enabled\narchitecture that integrates a variety of smart\
    \ city components and provides reliable and\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n36 of\
    \ 63\ntimely scheduling for big data transfer to support smart city services.\
    \ They also studied\nthe time-constrained big data transfer scheduling (TBTS)\
    \ problem under this architecture\nand proposed a heuristic with an intelligent\
    \ scheme that can maximize the throughput and\nschedule the multi-ﬂow transfer\
    \ dynamically.\nIoT systems collect and process data vulnerable to availability,\
    \ integrity, and privacy\nthreats. Nguyen et al. [174] proposed a collaborative\
    \ and intelligent-network-based in-\ntrusion detection system (NIDS) architecture,\
    \ namely, SeArch, for SDN-based cloud IoT\nnetworks. SeArch is a security architecture\
    \ in which an arrangement of three layers of IDS\nnodes, i.e., Edge-IDS, Fog-IDS,\
    \ and Cloud-IDS, is introduced with an effective collaboration\namong nodes.\n\
    Blockchain is an innovative solution for increasing data integrity and privacy\
    \ in smart\ncities [175]. Sharma and Park [176] proposed a novel hybrid network\
    \ architecture for the\nsmart city by exploiting the strength of emerging SDN\
    \ and Blockchain technologies. To\nachieve efﬁciency and address the current limitations,\
    \ their architecture is divided into\ncore and edge networks. By designing a hybrid\
    \ architecture, their architecture inherits\nthe strength of centralized and distributed\
    \ network architectures. “PrivySharing” [177]\nis a Blockchain-based innovative\
    \ framework for privacy-preserving and secure IoT data\nsharing in a smart city\
    \ environment. This framework protects data privacy by segmenting\nthe blockchain\
    \ network into different channels, consisting of a limited number of approved\n\
    businesses and handling a certain category of data, such as health, smart auto,\
    \ smart\nenergy, or ﬁnancial information. Additionally, smart contracts contain\
    \ access control rules\nthat regulate who has access to the users’ data within\
    \ a channel. In addition, private\ndata gathering and encryption are used to further\
    \ isolate and safeguard the data within\na channel.\nIslam et al. [178] designed\
    \ a decentralized and distributed architecture for the IoT\necosystem that addresses\
    \ the existing challenges through the use of the technologies\nBlockchain, SDN,\
    \ and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). This energy-aware architec-\nture\
    \ confronts the problems of scalability, ﬂexibility, complexity, monitoring, managing,\n\
    and collecting IoT data and defends against cyber threats.\n5.3. Architectures\
    \ for Smart Grid\nThe automated and intelligent management of the next-generation\
    \ electric power\nsystems determines their effectiveness and efﬁciency. Smart\
    \ Grid (SG) is the name given to\nthe next generation of electricity systems,\
    \ which are anticipated to offer various beneﬁts\nover the current systems in\
    \ terms of digitization, ﬂexibility, intelligence, resilience, sustain-\nability,\
    \ and customization [179]. Smart transmission infrastructures use new technologies\n\
    to improve power quality. Smart control centers monitor and communicate with electric\n\
    devices remotely in real time, while smart substations self-consciously coordinate\
    \ their local\ndevices. The dispatch of electricity to end-users is implemented\
    \ by using the electrical and\ncommunication infrastructures that connect the\
    \ transmission and customer domains. The\ndistribution domain includes distribution\
    \ feeders and transformers to supply electricity.\nIt interacts with much different\
    \ equipment, such as distributed energy resources (DERs),\nplug-in electric vehicles\
    \ (PEVs), automatic metering infrastructure (AMI), and sensors with\ncommunication\
    \ capability. The distribution domain is responsible for delivering electricity\n\
    to energy consumers, user demands, and energy availability. To provide quality\
    \ electricity,\nthe stability of this domain is monitored and controlled.\nTypical\
    \ applications [44] of the smart grid communications network are automatic\nmeter\
    \ reading, demand response, PEVs, substation automation, and DERs/microgrid.\n\
    DERs are tiny energy production and/or storage devices linked to the distribution\
    \ system.\nDistributed generation (DG), distributed storage (DS), or a combination\
    \ of renewable\nand non-renewable sources are all possible sources for DER. Solar\
    \ panels, wind turbines,\ncombustion turbines, fuel cells, battery storage systems,\
    \ etc., are a few examples of DER.\nAn electric power system with one or more\
    \ DER units and loads is referred to as a microgrid.\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n\
    37 of 63\nThe communication infrastructure in the smart grid supports the capabilities\
    \ of the\nsmart grid and complies with performance standards. This infrastructure\
    \ connects a huge\nnumber of electric devices and manages complex device communications.\
    \ As a result, it is\nbuilt in a hierarchical architecture with interconnected\
    \ individual sub-networks, and each\nsub-network is responsible for separate geographical\
    \ regions. The extremely dispersed\nsmaller area networks that support the power\
    \ systems at various locations are connected by\nWANs, which act as the communication’s\
    \ backbone. When the control centers are located a\ngreat distance from the substations\
    \ or the end-users, the real-time measurements made at\nthe electric devices are\
    \ transported to the control centers through the WANs, and in the\nopposite direction,\
    \ the WANs carry out the instruction communications from the control\ncenters\
    \ to the electric devices.\nThe authors of [43] present a communication architecture\
    \ in an SG. This architecture\nincludes (1) an energy smart house with electric\
    \ appliances connected to the smart grid,\n(2) a residential complex with AMI,\
    \ (3) a residential subdivision installed with solar panels,\n(4) a PEV charging\
    \ station, (5) a power substation, and (6) power transmission lines. In this\n\
    architecture, the Internet and ISPs serve as the backbone in connecting the distributed\
    \ sub-\nnetworks. Demertzis et al. [180] presented and categorized the communication\
    \ network\nstandards that have been established for smart grids and should be\
    \ considered in planning\nand implementing new infrastructures. Such standards\
    \ are IEC 61850 for substation\nautomation. This standard is based on open architecture\
    \ and incorporates sampling\nand timing synchronization speciﬁcations based on\
    \ IEEE 1588 in LANs and WANs [181].\nNotably, IEEE 1588 is the standard for a\
    \ precision clock synchronization protocol for\nnetworked measurement and control\
    \ systems [182].\nDue to the widespread use of renewable energy resources (RERs)\
    \ throughout the\npower grid, it is anticipated that electric power distribution\
    \ networks in smart grids would\nundergo signiﬁcant changes to accommodate the\
    \ nature of non-radial power ﬂow. For the\nmost part, the low-voltage distribution\
    \ networks where RERs (such as solar cells) may be\nattached are not monitored\
    \ by the majority of the present supervisory control and data ac-\nquisition (SCADA)\
    \ systems for power grids. For the goal of active monitoring and control,\nAbdrabou\
    \ [183] presented a multi-hop wireless network with a cellular frequency-reuse\n\
    structure that may supply the communication infrastructure to dense low-voltage\
    \ distribu-\ntion networks. A position-based QoS-aware routing protocol was also\
    \ presented as a useful\nmethod for prioritizing data transfer across the newly\
    \ introduced network architecture.\nHetGrid [184] is a unique overlay network\
    \ design with a speciﬁc QoS routing method\nfor power distribution grid applications.\
    \ It delivers QoS assurances across the network\nwhile taking into account three\
    \ factors: bandwidth, latency, and dependability. The authors\ncreated two components\
    \ to accomplish this:\n•\nA multipath routing mechanism that compensates critical\
    \ applications for their high-\nreliability requirements by using end-to-end physically\
    \ disjoint paths, and\n•\nAltruistic resource allocation with the QoS routing\
    \ mechanism that targets communi-\ncation with QoS guarantees for applications\
    \ with strict QoS requirements.\nThe ﬁndings in [184] show that the HetGrid overlay\
    \ network architecture enables ex-\ntremely effective, trustworthy, and QoS-aware\
    \ communication in heterogeneous networks.\nThe major characteristics that set\
    \ SG apart from the standard electrical power grid are\nthe ability to execute\
    \ two-way communication, demand-side management, and real-time\npricing. The present\
    \ SG systems have interoperability problems because they need to\nbe protocol\
    \ independent. Therefore, global communication network management and\nmonitoring\
    \ approaches have been proposed using SDN [185]. Thanks to SDN, network\nadministrators\
    \ may more efﬁciently manage their networks by separating the control plane\n\
    from the data plane. SDN has advanced in SG due to its reliance on communication\n\
    networks. SDN implementation in SG systems has the potential to increase efﬁciency\n\
    and resilience. SDN can assist the SG in integrating several SG standards and\
    \ protocols\nby virtue of its programmability, protocol independence, and granularity\
    \ capabilities to\ncope with varied communication systems. Rehmani et al. [185]\
    \ presented SDN-based\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n38 of 63\nSGC architectures,\
    \ along with case studies. They discussed routing schemes for SDN-\nbased SGC\
    \ and provided a detailed survey of security and privacy schemes applied to\n\
    SDN-based SGC.\nAlam et al. [186] provided a detailed survey on smart grid communication\
    \ networks in\nterms of communication network requirements, architecture, technologies,\
    \ and applications.\nThey proposed a Cognitive Radio (CR)-based Communication\
    \ Network for Smart Grid.\nCR is a software-deﬁned radio (SDR) platform that can\
    \ quickly reconﬁgure its operating\nparameters, such as modulation/demodulation,\
    \ compression algorithm, and error coding\ntechniques, according to changing circumstances\
    \ and requirements, through cognition. In\nsuch an SDR platform, radio transceivers\
    \ can switch functions and operations on demand\nonly. Molokomme et al. [187]\
    \ reviewed architectures that aim to accomplish the various\nand strict QoS requirements\
    \ in SG communication systems.\nWireless communication networks have been motivated\
    \ to harvest energy from\nambient environments and run energy-efﬁciently for economic\
    \ and ecological beneﬁts\nthrough improvements in the smart power grid and the\
    \ advocacy of “green communica-\ntions”. Hu et al. [188] examined recent developments\
    \ in energy harvesting, redistribution,\ntrade, and planning for future wireless\
    \ networks integrating with smart grids. The authors\nconsidered the optimization\
    \ of various energy-harvesting wireless systems as well as tradi-\ntional models\
    \ of renewable energy-harvesting technologies. Moreover, they discussed how\n\
    to distribute redundant (unused) energy generated by cellular networks, plan for\
    \ energy\nunder dynamic pricing when smart grids are in place, and engage in two-way\
    \ energy\ntrading using smart grids.\nFrom a different viewpoint, including IoT\
    \ devices and providing connectivity, au-\ntomation, and monitoring for such devices\
    \ enables SG systems to sustain multiple network\noperations during the generation,\
    \ distribution, transmission, and expenditure of energy.\nNumerous IoT-aided SG\
    \ systems have been proposed in the literature. The survey [189] on\nIoT-aided\
    \ SG systems considers the systems’ current architectures, uses, and prototypes.\n\
    5.4. Architectures for Smart Buildings\nThere are various building applications\
    \ such as heating, cooling, load control, air\nquality, ventilation, lighting,\
    \ water management, and cooking gas management. A smart\nbuilding incorporates\
    \ the major building systems on a common network and functionality\nto provide\
    \ operational efﬁciency, ﬁre safety, and security. A smart building architecture\n\
    (SBA) manages several real-time domains, including automated temperature regulation,\n\
    air cleaning, HVAC systems, and humidity control (i.e., indoor environment regulation\n\
    and monitoring); smart lighting and controlling home appliances (energy management);\
    \ a\nsmart ﬁre detection system; and other building operations. A typical smart\
    \ building [190]\nhas security cameras, lighting sensors, an indoor air quality\
    \ system, a ﬁre alarm system, a\nwater management system, and an energy management\
    \ system. Moreover, it can detect\nintrusion and supports HVAC services.\nDiverse\
    \ SBAs include complex operational systems, sensing, and communication\ntechnologies.\
    \ Such architectures have converged into an IP-based architecture. This con-\n\
    vergence is occurring rapidly with the increased usage of IP-based smart devices\
    \ driven\nthrough IoT concerning conventional building management and smart buildings.\
    \ Tradi-\ntionally, numerous building systems utilized varied forms of networking\
    \ protocols and\ncabling systems. This variety makes the whole system more complex\
    \ and highly infeasible\nfrom both a deployment and a system administration standpoint\
    \ [191]. SBAs entail making\nplans for and assisting with the inclusion of operational\
    \ technologies that improve the\napplication’s, service’s, or provision’s operational\
    \ steps while also boosting the well-being\nof its users. Researchers, policymakers,\
    \ and implementers should pay attention to several\ncrucial issues, such as reliable\
    \ communication/connection procedures, power-efﬁcient\nmeasures, competent security\
    \ measures, efﬁcient sensors and actuators, and data analyt-\nics procedures.\
    \ Amalgamating new systems and technologies with conventional (base)\ntechnologies\
    \ to accomplish the revelation of SBAs, includes, but is not limited to, WSN\n\
    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n39 of 63\ndeployment; advanced power-aware trafﬁc\
    \ engineering policies; cloud, edge, and fog com-\nputing paradigms; big data\
    \ engineering and analytics; and human–computer interaction\nprocedures [192].\
    \ The rapid development of ICT technologies has enhanced the connect-\nedness\
    \ of intelligent sensing, actuators, and communication devices to real-time physical\n\
    entities. Recently, smart sensing mechanisms, actuators, and data harvesting technology\n\
    have boosted the area of SBAs proposals. However, choosing the best ICT technologies\
    \ for\na particular smart building domain poses signiﬁcant difﬁculties, including\
    \ heterogeneity\nof IoT devices and applications, workable networking protocols\
    \ and architectures, power\nefﬁciency, and QoS/QoE provisioning [190,193]. One\
    \ solution is the SDN paradigm, which\nmanages the network more efﬁciently than\
    \ a customary one. SDN also assists network\nservices, including storage, routing,\
    \ dynamic bandwidth management, and QoS. Hence,\nthese simpliﬁcations offer a\
    \ creative environment through the implementation of proper\nsoftware tools for\
    \ smart buildings. Network architecture and its implementation for in-\ntelligent\
    \ infrastructure is based on IoT relationships (between IoT in home automation\n\
    and applications) and can be established using smart home Cloud Computing based\
    \ on\nSDN. Recently, Younus et al. [190] proposed an SDN architecture that improves\
    \ critical SB\nparameters such as bandwidth efﬁciency, energy efﬁciency, latency,\
    \ security, and reliability.\nSilva et al. [194] presented a Web of Things (WoT)\
    \ SBA that is integrated with the repre-\nsentational state transfer (RESTful)\
    \ application programming interface (API). The RESTful\nAPI employs HTTP requests\
    \ (e.g., GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE) to access and use WoT\ndata. Regarding network\
    \ performance and smart building power management, the authors\nshowed how their\
    \ recommendation for smart city architecture improved performance.\nSmart sensing\
    \ devices and actuators permit collecting, monitoring, controlling, or\nmodifying\
    \ vital building parameters so that users receive the best QoS/QoE possible. These\n\
    functionalities depend on sensor integration competence and their properties.\
    \ These sys-\ntems comprise signal conditioning circuits, implanted algorithms,\
    \ power, and transceiver\nmodules [195]. Researchers developed such system-based\
    \ SBAs for assessing and regulat-\ning air quality, smart lighting systems, ﬁre\
    \ detection systems, power management, and\nother basic building operations.\n\
    An indoor-air-quality-based SBA considers sensing and actuator-based systems for\n\
    monitoring and regulating air quality parameters. An indoor environmental observing\n\
    system was initially suggested in [196] that observes polluting gases, temperature,\
    \ and\nrelative humidity. Other kinds of such systems have been proposed in [197,198].\
    \ Con-\nsidering smart indoor lighting systems, numerous solutions have been proposed\
    \ in the\nliterature. In SBAs, light sensors manage and track the lighting system\
    \ to satisfy the users’\nneeds. The authors of [199] shed light on power consumption\
    \ reduction via energy-efﬁcient\nsmart lighting systems. Today’s smart building\
    \ employs low-power usage LED-based\nlight sources that last longer than Compact\
    \ Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) [200]. In reality, the\ndevelopment of control technologies,\
    \ heterogeneous networks, and embedded systems\nhas made it promising to create\
    \ smart innovative lighting systems that can effectively\naddress the problem\
    \ of energy conservation. Researchers have recently begun testing by\nintegrating\
    \ different power-saving techniques in a single illumination system for improved\n\
    energy efﬁciency while enhancing lighting performance without sacriﬁcing user\
    \ satisfac-\ntion. According to the authors of [201], using several cheap detectors,\
    \ as opposed to a\nsingle expensive sensor, would result in improved performance\
    \ and higher power savings.\nConsidering the same motivation, various authors\
    \ [202–204] have suggested similar types\nof smart lighting systems for several\
    \ room types, such as classrooms and ofﬁces. In [205],\nthe authors provide a\
    \ deep and profound study concerning smart lighting systems focusing\non power\
    \ savings procedures and connectivity alternatives as well as the integration\
    \ of\nvisible light communication technology [206].\nRecently, researchers focused\
    \ on two main goals, namely, occupants’ work perfor-\nmance and thermal comfort,\
    \ to propose effective SBAs. Hence, many Occupant-Oriented\nTechnologies (OOT)\
    \ have been put forth by academics who want to maximize thermal\ncomfort while\
    \ conserving energy. OOT-based systems offer a practical way to lessen the\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n40 of 63\ndrawbacks of the automatic control used today. In\
    \ practice, thermal comfort analysis is\nbased on parallel objective and subjective\
    \ evaluation. The objective evaluation comprises\nmonitoring, assessing, and recording\
    \ the status of environmental parameters through dedi-\ncated sensors and instruments\
    \ following standardized guidelines. Subjective evaluation\ninvolves monitoring,\
    \ assessing, and recording thermal preference, thermal sensation, and\nthermal\
    \ environment acceptance. Further thermal comfort sensor results as the cumulative\n\
    method to both above-mentioned analysis can be found in [193].\nGreen building\
    \ refers to SBAs with an ambient intelligence system that adjusts to\npredetermined\
    \ circumstances in real-world situations. In this situation, the system makes\n\
    full use of embedded sensors in an environment that can gather data and subsequently\n\
    allow the system to act in accordance with that data. The ambient intelligence\
    \ concept aims\nto conserve natural resources with limited and efﬁcient use of\
    \ them to offer comfort to the\noccupants. Through unconventional energy sources,\
    \ it also meets some of the conventional\nenergy requirements [207]. Many aspects\
    \ of SBAs, such as security, monitoring, and\npower efﬁciency, are the subject\
    \ of extensive study. However, one of the most important\nfunctions of an SB system\
    \ is to control the interior climate, which is typically done by\nHVAC systems\
    \ [208]. The performance of HVAC systems in the instance of commercial\nbuildings\
    \ for frequency regulations has been demonstrated by the authors of [209] for\
    \ this\ncontext. Their demonstrated numerical experiments suggest that 15% of\
    \ rated fan energy\ncan be employed for regulation use while having a minor effect\
    \ on a building’s indoor\ntemperature. The method of computational control for\
    \ passive and active sources was\nused in another scheme [210]. The authors emphasized\
    \ the problem that the ambient and\nactive sources of lighting, heating, ventilation,\
    \ cooling, and shading are not synchronized\nin buildings. Such a computational\
    \ control scheme is also suitable for reducing daily power\nusage. Similarly,\
    \ numerous methods [211–213] considering HVAC systems have been\nproposed with\
    \ respect to frequency regulation, predictive control, and smart controller.\n\
    An IoT-assisted HVAC smart system tracks environmental situations. It also notiﬁes\n\
    when measurements exceed thresholds and provides data on energy usage and consump-\n\
    tion. In addition, it can autonomously turn equipment intermittently at programmed\n\
    times. As individuals spend more time indoors (at home, work, or in other enclosed\
    \ spaces)\nthan outdoors, the air quality inside buildings should be improved\
    \ along with that of the\nexternal surroundings. This is the task of indoor Air\
    \ Quality Monitoring Systems (AQMS).\nThe basic parts of an AQMS (Figure 5) are\
    \ a sensor array, a processing/display unit, a signal\nconditioning circuit, a\
    \ small amount of external memory, and a communication module\nthat is typically\
    \ wireless. A sensor array is a group of specialized micro-sensors that can\n\
    detect certain airborne concentrations of gases such as NOX, SOX, CO2, CO, and\
    \ O3, as\nwell as some essential environmental parameters such as humidity and\
    \ temperature. These\nsensors are connected to a GUI unit that shows the values\
    \ of the real-time indoor air quality\nparameters and an external memory used\
    \ to store real-time data [214]. When deploying\nsuch systems, various communication\
    \ (wireless) modules, including WiFi, ZigBee, and\nLoRAWAN technologies, are considered.\n\

    \ capabilities.\n5.5. Smart Water and Pipeline Network Monitoring\nRetroﬁtting\
    \ the traditional water distribution system with smart devices has some\nbeneﬁts,\
    \ including lower utility costs, lower consumer bills, and less water loss [222,223].\n\
    For example, smart water sensors can keep an eye on the pressure online and alert\
    \ utilities\nto pressure changes or large pressure losses in the water network,\
    \ allowing them to remotely\nadjust the pressure to save energy consumption [224].\
    \ Automation can be used for both\noperational procedures and components that\
    \ provide functionality. For instance, when a\nwater problem occurs during operation\
    \ or with the element itself, the smart components\ninform the system center and\
    \ then take action to avert a crash. The water utility can also\ndetermine a sensor’s\
    \ requirement for maintenance or replacement thanks to the automatic\nself-veriﬁcation\
    \ mechanism [225].\nIn [226], the authors suggest an IoT-based smart water grid\
    \ architecture that includes\ntechnical systems, functions, and a hierarchy framework.\
    \ Moreover, this smart water\nsystem (SWS) also comprises smart sensing mechanisms,\
    \ simulation procedures, diag-\nnostic techniques, disposal, warning, and control\
    \ mechanisms. Although an SWS incor-\nporates ofﬂine performance, real-time performance\
    \ is deﬁned by online procedures such\nas online data monitoring, online data\
    \ assimilation, online modeling, online charting,\nand online results output.\
    \ An SWS must have real-time functionality to implement the\nnecessary smart features\
    \ [227]. Researchers put a lot of effort [228] into developing wa-\nter systems\
    \ that operate intelligently. Real-time modeling, real-time sampling, real-time\n\
    controlling, etc., which seek to reduce the lag between system input and system\
    \ output,\nshould be added to the smart performance of SWS. It was discovered\
    \ that using SCADA\nwould considerably increase the data transfer efﬁciency [229].\
    \ A smart water architec-\nture [230] often includes ﬁve layers: (1) the physical\
    \ layer; (2) the sensing and control layer;\n(3) the communication layer; (4)\
    \ the data management layer; and (5) the data fusion layer.\nWithin the framework\
    \ of the GST4Water project, the authors of [230] presented a system\nthat allows\
    \ for receiving consumption data sent by a generic smart meter installed in a\n\
    user’s house and transferring them to a cloud platform. The consumption data are\
    \ saved\nand processed to characterize leakage at the district meter area and\
    \ the individual user level.\nMeanwhile, the processed data are returned to the\
    \ Water Utility and can be used for billing.\nOn the other hand, they provide\
    \ regular feedback to the user, thus gaining full awareness\nof their consumption\
    \ behavior. Panagiotakopoulos et al. [231] presented an IoT framework\nbased on\
    \ FIWARE that aims to realize a highly ﬂexible standards-based open-source soft-\n\
    ware solution for developing SWSs. They designed an architecture consisting of\
    \ various\nFIWARE software components and two dashboard applications. Amaxilatis\
    \ et al. [232]\nconsidered numerous intelligent infrastructure solutions regarding\
    \ conventional water\nmetering systems, which effectively facilitate uninterrupted\
    \ bi-directional (whenever re-\nquired) data exchange between water ﬂow devices,\
    \ metering equipment, and end-users.\nThe authors’ ultimate objective is to design,\
    \ implement, and deploy more sophisticated\ninfrastructure offering improved performance\
    \ in bigger smart city infrastructure. To limit\nthe amount of data that needs\
    \ to be shared between the various system layers, their ap-\nproach makes use\
    \ of the FogC paradigm to develop the infrastructure for the smart water\ngrid\
    \ model.\nThe Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Solutions for the\
    \ Efﬁcient\nWater Resources Management project was funded by the European Commission\
    \ under the\nauspices of the Seventh Framework Program (FP7). The goal of the\
    \ Smart Water project is\nto examine the role of ICT in monitoring and effectively\
    \ managing urban water systems,\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n44 of 63\nwith a\
    \ focus on the deployment of sensors, communication technologies, and related\n\
    decision support systems in utility providers’ water networks to address issues\
    \ such as\nleakage management, demand management, asset management, and so forth.\
    \ Kulkarni\nand Farnham [233] focused on the issues surrounding wireless connectivity,\
    \ proposed\na framework for assessing potential solutions based on the total cost\
    \ of ownership, and\nhighlighted lessons learned from two European utilities’\
    \ Smart Water case studies.\nPipelines are used to transport water, gases, and\
    \ oil. Since they are frequently under-\nground, the humid atmosphere easily erodes\
    \ them, which may result in leaks. In addition,\nwater in the pipelines may get\
    \ contaminated by infectious agents or substances that are\nmistakenly or purposely\
    \ introduced into the system. As a result, maintaining pipeline\nnetworks is crucial\
    \ for maintaining public health and protecting the environment. The sen-\nsor\
    \ node deployment profoundly impacts the sensing performance indicators for pipeline\n\
    network monitoring, including coverage area, coverage population, and detection\
    \ time.\nThe sensor nodes should typically be positioned near the pipeline network’s\
    \ junctions [234].\nGiven the design of the pipeline network, the optimal sensor\
    \ node deployment challenges\nare therefore formulated as integer optimization\
    \ problems, where the integer variables\nrepresent the maximum amount of sensor\
    \ nodes that must be placed at each junction. The\ndeployment difﬁculties for\
    \ pipeline network monitoring are typically challenging to solve\nbecause of the\
    \ integer decision variables.\nPipeline network ﬂows are not predictable. As a\
    \ result, depending on the ﬂow pattern,\nthe sensing performance of a deployed\
    \ sensor node may vary. As a result, the ﬂow pattern\nis taken into account in\
    \ [235], which formulates a mix-integer optimization problem to\ndecide how to\
    \ deploy sensor nodes to reduce the projected population at risk of malicious\n\
    contamination. The authors solved the ensuing mix-integer optimization using a\
    \ branch\nand bound technique. Even though a strategy such as this can identify\
    \ the ideal answer,\nthe time complexity is typically signiﬁcant. This means that\
    \ large pipeline networks cannot\nbe used with the method. Similarly, the study\
    \ in [236] considers the various demand\npatterns of water ﬂows through pipes.\
    \ The authors used a genetic-based method to ﬁnd the\nbest deployment locations\
    \ to increase coverage under various monitoring station demand\npatterns. The\
    \ global optimum of these heuristic algorithms could take a while to reach.\n\
    The performance of the algorithms may also be impacted by their parameter choices.\n\
    Consequently, we do not advise using it for massive pipeline networks.\nSingapore’s\
    \ WaterWise@SG program aims to identify pipeline leaks and anticipate\nburst incidents\
    \ [237,238]. PipeNet has also been put to the test in Boston to ﬁnd pipeline\n\
    leaks, where three tiers of nodes are employed to quantify pH levels and pressure.\
    \ To\nreduce water waste, a system named IWCMSE [239] has been designed to track\
    \ water\nconsumption for businesses. A Steamﬂood and Waterﬂood Tracking System\
    \ [240] has been\ncreated to ﬁnd irregularities in pipeline systems, such as leaks\
    \ and bottlenecks. With the\naid of all these technologies, the investigators\
    \ had the opportunity to evaluate the efﬁciency\nof the monitoring algorithms.\
    \ However, these technologies rely on ﬁxed sensors, and we\nstill need to put\
    \ innovative testbed models and systems built around crowd sensing and\nmobile\
    \ WSN into place.\n5.6. Architectures for Smart Transportation\nThe Internet-of-Vehicles\
    \ (IoV, also known as V2X) aims to reduce trafﬁc congestion\nand accidents. It\
    \ also enables information exchange involving the vehicle and all entities\nthat\
    \ may have an impact on it. Vehicle networking and vehicle intelligence are the\
    \ two\ntechnologies that underpin IoV implementation. The three components that\
    \ compose\nvehicle networking are the onboard information service, VANET, and\
    \ mobile network.\nVANET stands for vehicle-to-vehicle short-range communication.\
    \ Providing remote loca-\ntion, remote diagnostics, navigation, and other information\
    \ services is referred to as an\nonboard information service. Every car can be\
    \ utilized as a potent mobile terminal thanks\nto mobile networks. Vehicle intelligence\
    \ is the use of cutting-edge technologies, including\nartiﬁcial intelligence (AI),\
    \ big data analytics, deep learning (DL), and cognitive computing\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2490\n45 of 63\n(CogC), to facilitate information sharing among people\
    \ and vehicles, as well as between\nvehicles and the environment, infrastructure,\
    \ or other vehicles.\nVehicular networks consist of data-gathering sensors and\
    \ inter-vehicle communica-\ntion systems. Such networks require an open and ﬂexible\
    \ layered architecture to handle\ncharacteristics such as interoperability, scalability,\
    \ dependability, and modularity. Recently,\nthe research community proposed efﬁcient\
    \ vehicle network architectures. For example,\nthe Universal IoV (UIoV) architecture\
    \ [241] includes seven layers. Offering services and\nchoosing messaging protocols\
    \ are tasks that fall within the application layer. Data prepro-\ncessing, big\
    \ data processing, and intelligent transmission are all tasks that the multimedia\n\
    and big data layer is in charge of. For IoV systems, the cloud service layer’s\
    \ ClCom and\ncloud virtualization technologies offer hardware computing platforms,\
    \ infrastructure, and\nsoftware services. In the UIoV architecture, the communication\
    \ layer and the intra–inter\ndevices layer are merged to accomplish the connectivity\
    \ of many heterogeneous objects\nand networks. Notably, there is no intra–inter\
    \ devices layer in classical architecture. The\nUIoV system’s physical objects\
    \ layer gathers and transmits all the data to the intra–inter\ndevices layer for\
    \ additional processing. In the IoV, both vehicles and non-vehicle items are\n\
    identiﬁed using the Identiﬁcation Layer.\nLiu et al. [242] suggested another IoV\
    \ network architecture to increase the ﬂexibility of\napplication management while\
    \ enhancing the scalability and dependability of information\nservices. This architecture\
    \ has four layers in total, the data layer of which has a variety\nof nodes with\
    \ various wireless communication interfaces. Because the topology of IoV\nis frequently\
    \ changed, an immense quantity of data are frequently produced and trans-\nmitted\
    \ at the data layer. To safeguard the accurate semantics of the underlying resources,\n\
    the virtualization layer splits a few nodes into fog nodes and the network, computation,\n\
    communication, and storage resources in IoV. To execute applications such as road\
    \ safety\nmanagement and data sensing, the control layer’s SDN controller is responsible\
    \ for schedul-\ning the abstraction resources of the virtualization layer and\
    \ interacting with the application\nlayer. A difﬁcult topic in network architecture\
    \ design is dealing with diverse networks.\nInteroperability, scalability, dependability,\
    \ and adaptability are some of its network features.\nThe design seeks to increase\
    \ layer separation and network architecture’s total number of\nlayers. In addition\
    \ to being a service-oriented design, the IoV architecture should facilitate\n\
    the connectivity of cars with heterogeneous networks and other communication devices.\n\
    By introducing the CogC paradigm into autonomous driving systems, the learning\
    \ ability\nof autonomous vehicles can be effectively improved. Utilizing both\
    \ physical and network\ndata space, the Cognitive Internet of Vehicles (CIoV)\
    \ paradigm [243] improves network\nsecurity and transportation safety. CIoV enables\
    \ IoV to bear more accurate perceptive\nability through cognition in the intra-vehicle\
    \ network (driver, passengers, smart devices,\netc.), inter-vehicle network (adjacent\
    \ intelligent vehicles), and beyond-vehicle network\n(road environment, cellular\
    \ network, edge nodes, remote cloud, etc.). The CIoV architecture\nincludes a\
    \ cognitive data engine that can conduct cognition of user tasks by the use of\n\
    data collected, e.g., driving behavior model analysis, emotion analysis, and road\
    \ condition\ninvestigation. Five layers are present in the network architecture\
    \ of CIoV. The gathering\nand preprocessing of big data from several sources are\
    \ done by the sensing layer. As\nopposed to the previous communication layer (of\
    \ other architectures), the architecture’s\ncommunication layer uses a cloud/edge\
    \ hybrid structure to accommodate various applica-\ntion schedules. The data cognition\
    \ engine at the cognition layer processes and interprets\nheterogeneous data streams\
    \ (machine learning (ML), DL, data mining, etc.) using a variety\nof cognitive\
    \ analysis approaches. The control layer’s resource awareness engine is in\ncharge\
    \ of allocating and scheduling network resources with the aid of technologies\
    \ such\nas NFV, SDN, network slicing, and self-organized networking (SON). There\
    \ are primar-\nily two categories in the application layer (i.e., usual application\
    \ services and intelligent\ntransportation applications).\nEfﬁcient message authentication\
    \ and integrity are required to guarantee vehicle pri-\nvacy and safeguard vehicular\
    \ communications. To protect V2V and V2I communications\nElectronics 2023, 12,\
    \ 2490\n46 of 63\nin the context of the VANET against a broad range of cyber threats,\
    \ Karim [244] provided\na cryptography-based routing solution. This solution includes\
    \ a data encryption and de-\ncryption mechanism based on attributes and identity\
    \ that has the lowest computational\noverhead while keeping the optimum level\
    \ of security. Contreras-Castillo et al. [245]\nsuggested a seven-layer network\
    \ architecture. The user interface layer, which controls infor-\nmation exchange\
    \ between the user and the vehicle, is the top layer. Utilizing roadside units\n\
    (RSUs) and onboard sensors, the data collecting layer gathers data. The pre-processing\n\
    and ﬁltering layer eliminates the unnecessary information from the gathered data\
    \ before\nsending the remaining information to the communication layer for transmission.\
    \ Making\nchoices and managing network service providers are the responsibilities\
    \ of control and\nmanagement. Large volumes of data must be processed by the processing\
    \ layer to create\nthe pertinent data needed for various applications. To stop\
    \ assaults, the security layer\ndirectly manages each of the layers above. A unique\
    \ network architecture with enhanced\nthroughput, reduced latency, higher security,\
    \ and widespread connectivity was recently\nproposed by Ji et al. [246]. This\
    \ architecture consists of four layers:\n1.\nSecurity authentication layer: The\
    \ RSUs on the road may monitor trafﬁc environment\ndata in real-time after setting\
    \ several sensors, surveillance footage, and radar. This\nlayer determines the\
    \ legality of the car and RSU that are requesting to join the network.\nPerhaps\
    \ an illegal vehicle or an RSU that has been installed unlawfully will attempt\n\
    to steal or alter the information of a real vehicle.\n2.\nData acquisition layer:\
    \ This layer collects and categorizes many types of data from\nvarious networks.\
    \ To ensure that the data can be sent to the edge layer securely, it\ndigitizes\
    \ the data.\n3.\nEdge layer: Edge devices produce several data streams. As a result,\
    \ processing and\nanalyzing data in one go using ClCom will result in signiﬁcant\
    \ delays. As a result, we\nmust process data more closely related to the data\
    \ source. The edge node, a physical\ndevice situated closest to the data source,\
    \ is used by the edge layer to carry out basic\nprocessing and analysis on the\
    \ acquired local data. It releases data analysis ﬁndings\nfor nearby trafﬁc incidents\
    \ and current road conditions in real-time, then creates a\nlocal decision-making\
    \ plan, carrying out various ClCom jobs and boosting the cloud\ndata center’s\
    \ computing power.\n4.\nCloud Platform Layer: The cloud data center analyses the\
    \ information it has collected\nabout global trafﬁc in this tier, develops a plan,\
    \ and rationally distributes trafﬁc\nresources. This layer, having the ability\
    \ to implement connection management, data\nmanagement, aided autonomous driving,\
    \ intelligent navigation, path planning, and\ninformation security, is the “smart\
    \ brain” of the IoV.\nA blockchain-based vehicle network architecture (Block-VN)\
    \ for the smart city was\npresented in [247]. Building innovative distributed\
    \ transport management systems is made\npossible by the robust and secure Block-VN\
    \ architecture. The authors considered how the\nnetwork of vehicles evolves with\
    \ paradigms focused on networking and vehicular informa-\ntion. To handle real-time\
    \ transportation data, Jan et al. [248] created a model for assessing\ntransportation\
    \ data using Spark and Hadoop. This model/system is separated into four\nlayers:\
    \ data collection and acquisition, network, data processing, and application.\
    \ Each\nlayer is built to process and manage data in a structured manner. On the\
    \ data processing\nlayer, Hadoop and Spark are used to test the data. By utilizing\
    \ the suggested event and\ndecision mechanism based on Named Data Networking [249],\
    \ the data are made available\nto a smart community member. The suggested approach\
    \ was examined using transporta-\ntion datasets from some reliable sources. The\
    \ outcomes demonstrate data processing and\nreal-time distribution to citizens\
    \ in the shortest amount of time. Spark with the Hadoop\nenvironment produces\
    \ ﬁndings that are quite accurate. From another viewpoint, Social\nIoV (SIoV)\
    \ are a breed of socially aware ephemeral networks [250], where vehicular nodes\n\
    share/exchange information with different entities and are thus forth comparable\
    \ with\ntraditional social networks. Kerrache et al. [251] proposed a trust-aware\
    \ communication\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n47 of 63\narchitecture for social\
    \ IoV (TACASHI), which offers a trust-aware social in-vehicle and\ninter-vehicle\
    \ communication architecture for SIoVs.\n5.7. Architectures for Smart Rural Areas/Smart\
    \ Villages\nThe smart village paradigm digitizes various aspects of rural activities\
    \ using IoT\ntechnologies. In the countryside, a variety of activities are carried\
    \ out, including smart\nagriculture, waste management, irrigation management,\
    \ livestock management, smart\nenergy, smart healthcare, and smart education.\
    \ A smart village or smart rural area can\nenable real-time data analytics and\
    \ automate decision-making for local villagers regard-\ning healthcare, agriculture,\
    \ environment, transportation, and energy. It differs from a\nsmart city as there\
    \ are key differences (e.g., low cost, infrastructure, and sustainability)\nbetween\
    \ urban and rural environments [252]. To realize the smart village goal, The Euro-\n\
    pean Commission (2017) [253] launched an action plan, in which it proposed to\
    \ interfere\nICTs in villages. Cambra-Fierro and Pérez [254] addressed the meaning\
    \ of “smart” in\nrural contexts as well as its link with sustainability. The European\
    \ Commission-funded\nSmart Rural 21 initiative [255], which has the ultimate goal\
    \ of encouraging and motivat-\ning communities to create and execute smart village\
    \ methods and tactics throughout\nEurope as a tool for rural development, serving\
    \ as the authors’ primary source. IEEE\nSmart Village [256] also supports the\
    \ world’s energy-impoverished communities by pro-\nviding a complete solution\
    \ combining renewable energy, community-based education, and\nentrepreneurial\
    \ opportunities.\nMalik et al. [257] discussed the implementation details of smart\
    \ villages with different\ntechnologies. They concluded that digitization is only\
    \ possible if a reliable and robust net-\nwork and communication infrastructure\
    \ are installed in the village environment. Shrestha\nand Drozdenko [258] proposed\
    \ a Smart Rural framework to mitigate the effects of climate\nchange using IoT\
    \ and the Cloud, building a prototype on the Louisiana Tech University\ncampus.\
    \ Their framework is an energy-efﬁcient monitoring system for observing the envi-\n\
    ronmental conditions that affect agricultural production and human health. It\
    \ consists of\nthe following subsystems: Wireless Sensor Nodes, Fog Server, Cloud\
    \ Services, and a Web\nDashboard. The dashboard converts raw sensor data into\
    \ meaningful information from\nwhich public ofﬁcials and residents can adapt to\
    \ or frustrate the effects of climate change.\nMonzon Baeza and Alvarez Marban\
    \ [259] proposed a ﬂexible and scalable Smart Rural\nsystem for gathering and\
    \ processing IoT data from remote rural areas with no traditional\ncommunication\
    \ coverage as a handicap. The authors offered an architecture structured in\n\
    separate segments using IoT, 5G, Cloud, and High-Altitude Platform Station (HAPS).\
    \ Their\nproposal is applied to the rural environment to thus cover all the needs\
    \ of the system in the\ncollection of IoT data from these remote rural areas,\
    \ its coverage by space vehicles, and its\nprocessing and storage through 5G terrestrial\
    \ networks and cloud services. Their proposal\nincludes the deployment of IoT\
    \ sensors and the development of Amazon Web Services.\nConversely, the part of\
    \ the space segment, considered by HAPS, has been simulated for\ndifferent space\
    \ channels. This method provides a complete and automated smart rural\nsystem\
    \ that allows access to these IoT data from remote rural areas through the Internet.\
    \ To\nprovide secure services close to end-devices, Aljuhani et al. [260] explored\
    \ the integration\nof a Distributed Fog Computing (DFC) network architecture with\
    \ IoT in improving security\nand privacy solutions for villagers and consumer\
    \ electronic (CE) devices. As a case study,\nthe authors designed and evaluated\
    \ the performance of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)\nin a DFC-based smart\
    \ village environment. Moreover, they discussed open security issues\nand challenges\
    \ regarding Fog-to-Things enabled smart villages. Rohan et al. [261] proposed\n\
    a collaborative edge-computing architecture considering the resource constraints\
    \ in a smart\nvillage. The authors illustrated the concept of collaborative edge\
    \ computing as applicable\nto reduce cost and better manage the existing infrastructural\
    \ facilities. Collaboration occurs\nbetween the multiple IoT edge devices (e.g.,\
    \ the edge data centers or edge routers) for data\nprocessing and storage. For\
    \ example, in times of high computational load demand, one\nvillage’s edge devices\
    \ can collaborate with another village’s edge devices.\nElectronics 2023, 12,\
    \ 2490\n48 of 63\n6. Summary\n•\nVarious SCAs have different network requirements\
    \ such as bandwidth, delay toler-\nance, power consumption, reliability, wireless\
    \ connectivity, mobility, security, and\nprivacy. Therefore, they need different\
    \ protocols at the OSI-RM layers. The network\narchitectures for IoT are heterogeneous\
    \ and include various network technologies such\nas WiFi, WSNs, Mesh Wireless\
    \ Networks (WMNs), Vehicular Networks, and Mobile\nCommunication Networks (MCNs)\
    \ (5G/LTE/4G/3G). The standards adopted in these\narchitectures must allow interoperability,\
    \ while cross-layer design-based recommen-\ndations for power consumption and\
    \ congestion control are well-suited proposals.\n•\nState-of-the-art generic network\
    \ architectures for smart cities adopt the SDN paradigm\nand are based on FogC\
    \ to reduce latency and increase the efficiency of provided services.\n•\nFog\
    \ and ClCom will be used in smart grid communication system architecture in the\n\
    future to fulﬁll QoS needs. Such architecture will additionally feature communication\n\
    methods that can lessen QoS issues like latency, security, and spectrum efﬁciency.\
    \ The\nCR technology will be an indispensable part of this architecture as this\
    \ technology can\nquickly reconﬁgure the operating parameters of the SG communication\
    \ system to the\nchanging requirements through cognition.\n•\nBy extracting usable\
    \ data from both the physical and network data space, it is possible\nto increase\
    \ network security and transportation safety in IoVs. Future IoV architectures\n\
    will become cognitive. These architectures will include cognitive data engines\
    \ that\nwill conduct cognition of user tasks by the use of data collected, e.g.,\
    \ driving behavior\nmodel analysis, emotion analysis, and road condition investigation.\n\
    •\nThe networking performance of SDN is better than the customary networking of\
    \ smart\nbuildings (SB). However, as Younus et al. [190] state, it also has been\
    \ facing some\nchallenges such as network management in terms of maintenance,\
    \ east–west interface,\nsouthbound interface, trafﬁc management, energy, ML-based\
    \ SDN networking for SB,\nand the network resources issue of SB SDN-based networking.\n\
    7. Open Research Issues\n−Network slicing management is required: IoT services\
    \ such as smart transportation and\nsmart energy have diversiﬁed requirements.\
    \ To accommodate diverse IoT services, the\nnetwork slicing paradigm is suggested\
    \ because it enables multiple independent logical\nnetworks running on the same\
    \ physical network infrastructure. Wu et al. [9] presented\nan architecture for\
    \ intelligent network slicing management for the Industrial IoT (IIoT)\nfocusing\
    \ on three IIoT services (smart transportation, smart energy, and smart factory).\
    \ The\nauthors also provided a comprehensive survey on intelligent network slicing\
    \ management\nin this ﬁeld.\n−NFV Implementation in the SDN-IoT Environment: The\
    \ ETSI Industry Speciﬁcation\nGroup proposed NFV to virtualize the network functions\
    \ that were before performed\nby some proprietary dedicated. NFV allows for the\
    \ ﬂexible provisioning of software-\nbased network functionalities on top of an\
    \ appropriately shared physical infrastructure by\nseparating the network functions\
    \ from the underlying hardware appliances [262]. Utilizing\ninexpensive commodity\
    \ servers, it solves the issue of operating costs associated with\nadministering\
    \ and controlling this closed and proprietary equipment. When SDN is\nused in\
    \ conjunction with NFV (the software-deﬁned NFV architecture), it can overcome\n\
    the difﬁculties associated with intelligent service orchestration and dynamic\
    \ resource\nmanagement [263]. SDN can dynamically establish a virtual service\
    \ environment through\nNFV. As a result, the need for specialized hardware and\
    \ labor-intensive effort to fulﬁll\na new service request is avoided. In conjunction\
    \ with the use of SDN, NFV also allows\nreal-time and dynamic function provisioning\
    \ along with ﬂexible trafﬁc forwarding. The\nSDN-IoT network may be improved and\
    \ secured with NVF. It enables the software-based\ndeployment of network devices\
    \ as virtualized components. Throughput is increased\nbecause of NFV integration\
    \ in the SDN-IoT network, which enhances network performance.\nTo this end, Sinh\
    \ et al. [264] proposed a practical model for hosting IoT services and building\n\
    Electronics 2023, 12, 2490\n49 of 63\nSDN controller applications to show that\
    \ SDN/NFV can effectively apply to IoT services.\nRecently, Mukherjee et al. [265]\
    \ proposed an SDN-based distributed IoT network with NFV\nimplementation for smart\
    \ cities.\n−Cognitive IoT network architecture for smart cities: CR technology\
    \ can address the\nbandwidth needs of IoT applications [266]. IoT devices can\
    \ be enabled with cognitive\nfunctionalities, including spectrum sensing, dynamic\
    \ spectrum accessing, circumstantial\nperceiving, and self-learning. Many SCAs\
    \ and services can be based on CR technology\nbecause it can do dynamic sensing\
    \ and cognition of the surrounding environment. For\nexample, in smart grid applications,\
    \ cognitive IoT can achieve the objective of enabling\nusers to know their energy\
    \ consumption at any time and anywhere [267]. In smart home ap-\nplications, cognitive-radio-equipped\
    \ sensors can handle potential heterogeneous network\ninterference [268]. At the\
    \ same time, cognitive IoT can help with smoother real-time moni-\ntoring over\
    \ longer distances in the healthcare industry without worrying about spectrum\n\
    availability [269]. The complete utilization of cognitive radio technology in\
    \ IoT demands\nextensive research in spectrum optimization, standardization, hardware\
    \ design, privacy\nprotection, heterogeneous network fusion, scalability and ﬂexibility\
    \ problems, etc. [270].\nFor this reason, many CIoT-based smart city network architectures\
    \ must be proposed to\nsolve such problems. In this regard, Park et al. [271]\
    \ suggested a CIoT-based smart city\nnetwork architecture that outlines how data\
    \ collected from SCAs may be analyzed using\nthe CogC paradigm and manage the\
    \ scalability and ﬂexibility challenges.\n−Challenges in IoT communication through\
    \ TCP/IP suite: Unfortunately, many Access\nPoints (APs) can utilize identical\
    \ WiFi channels in overlapping regions, leading to interfer-\nence problems that\
    \ can signiﬁcantly impair TCP performance over WiFi [272]. Now, many\nAPs can\
    \ provide support for wireless access to numerous users in a WiFi network with\n\
    the DownLink multi-user MIMO (DL MU-MIMO) functionality. DL MU-MIMO is a PHY\n\
    layer technology (included with IEEE 802.11ac standard [273]) that increases the\
    \ capacity\nof WLANs by simultaneously broadcasting data streams to several stations.\
    \ As a result, it\nis possible to achieve greater data rates that are equal to\
    \ the number of antennas on APs.\nThus, several stations are served at once. Pokhrel\
    \ and Singh [131] stressed the employment\nof CR and Federated Learning (FL) methods\
    \ with many APs to improve the Compound\nTCP’s performance in wide-area Industry\
    \ 4.0 WiFi networks. An FL method can accelerate\nthe learning processes of the\
    \ transport protocols such as Compound TCP. In FL, training\ndata are dispersed\
    \ across a large number of clients, each having unreliable and compar-\natively\
    \ slow network connections, with the aim of developing a high-quality centralized\n\
    model. The authors of [131] insisted on using these specialized strategies to\
    \ coordinate\nnumerous APs with regard to losses caused by unique wireless channel\
    \ characteristics and\nWiFi downloading and uploading dynamics. Through the use\
    \ of FL and CR approaches in\ndual AP settings, it is now possible to improve\
    \ the Layer-4 performances of TCP versions.\nAnother study [274] assumed TCP Cubic\
    \ [275] as the Layer-4 protocol and considered the\nFL approach for IoVs. The\
    \ authors of [276] developed a framework for exploiting the FL\ntechnique, which\
    \ enhances the efﬁciency and privacy protection for the case of IoVs.\n−Digital\
    \ Twins for Smart Processes: A virtual depiction of resources, personnel, proce-\n\
    dures, systems, devices, and locations is referred to as a digital twin. Digital\
    \ twin technology\ncan be used to duplicate a variety of objects, including humans,\
    \ IoT devices, aircraft en-\ngines, and vehicles. A digital twin of the original\
    \ vehicle is created, for instance, when\nan automobile business creates a virtual\
    \ representation or digital duplicate (copy) of a car\nmodel. If a manufacturer\
    \ creates a virtual representation of its manufacturing process, the\nreplicated\
    \ process is a digital twin of the physical process. A digital twin is a proﬁle\
    \ of\nthe actual process or physical object’s past and present state. In this\
    \ virtual graphic, the\ndynamics and features of an IoT device’s life and operation\
    \ are depicted. The digital twin\ncan offer the location, state, and/or status\
    \ of physical assets in real-time due to continual\nlearning and advancements.\
    \ This fusion of the real and digital worlds enables organizations\nto monitor\
    \ systems, set strategies, and anticipate problems before they occur. Digital\
    \ twins\nare created using digital twin technology, which integrates network infrastructure\
    \ graphs,\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n50 of 63\nAI, software analytics, and the\
    \ IoT. Through digital twins, the idea of the smart city is\ndemonstrated. This\
    \ technology can efﬁciently administer the city, from urban planning to\nthe optimization\
    \ of land use. Digital twins make it possible to simulate plans before putting\n\
    them into action in the real world, revealing issues before they materialize.\
    \ If a digital twin\nis in place, government organizations can only fully assess\
    \ what might be achieved with\nthe data to better citizens’ lives, offer economic\
    \ opportunity, and establish a more cohesive\ncommunity. Although the idea is\
    \ currently novel, it is expected to catch on in the next few\nyears [277].\n\
    −The 6G Network for Futuristic Smart Cities: A futuristic smart city is a dense\
    \ and\nAI-centric city because massive device connectivity with vast data trafﬁc\
    \ is estimated in\nthe future. In such cities, the concept of IoT will be converted\
    \ to the concept of Internet of\nEverything (IoE). Networks of futuristic smart\
    \ cities should have a huge bandwidth, low\nlatency, and AI integration. Such\
    \ networks should also provide ubiquity, high QoS, and\non-demand content for\
    \ thousands of interconnected devices. The 6G network [278] is the\nproblem-solving\
    \ network of futuristic cities, with huge bandwidth and low latency. It is\nunder\
    \ development for wireless communications technologies supporting cellular data\n\
    networks. Like its predecessors, 6G networks will probably be broadband cellular\
    \ networks,\nin which the service area is divided into small geographical areas\
    \ (cells). It is expected that\n6G will be supported by existing 5G infrastructures\
    \ such as SDN, NFV, and network slicing,\ntogether with new infrastructure. The\
    \ network requirements of 6G are as follows [278]:\n(1) ultra-fast data rates\
    \ as high as 1 Tbps; (2) ultra-low latency of less than 1 ms; (3) increased\n\
    mobility and coverage; (4) ﬂexible and efﬁcient connection of trillion level objects;\
    \ (5) peak\nspectral efﬁciency of 60 b/s/Hz; (6) very high system reliability;\
    \ and (7) improved network\nsecurity [279]. However, the main problem of 6G is\
    \ that transmitting at a higher frequency\nspectrum is prone to high path loss,\
    \ making the distance for transmission limited [280].\nThe expected 6G of the\
    \ radio access network is based on terahertz (THz) waves with the\ncapability\
    \ of carrying up to one terabit per second (Tbps). THz waves have the capability\
    \ of\ncarrying a large amount of data, but these waves have numerous drawbacks,\
    \ such as short-\nrange and atmospheric attenuation. Hence, these drawbacks can\
    \ introduce complications\nand hinder the performance of the 6G network. Therefore,\
    \ such complications of THz waves\nmust be considered, and efﬁcient AI-centric\
    \ multilayer physical network architectures of 6G\nmust be proposed for futuristic\
    \ smart cities. Farooq et al. [280] considered the expectations\nfrom a network\
    \ of futuristic smart cities and the problems of THz waves and proposed\na conceptual\
    \ terrestrial network (TN) architecture for 6G. The nested Bee Hive [280] is a\n\
    scalable multilayer architecture designed to meet the needs of futuristic smart\
    \ cities. It\nprovides an on-ground cloud network that helps smart devices to\
    \ run AI applications\npartially on their own and the rest on the cloud. Furthermore,\
    \ the distributed and edge\ncomputing-oriented infrastructure of Bee Hive provides\
    \ security and reduces trafﬁc load on\nthe upper layer of the network. Undoubtedly,\
    \ pervasive AI is the main enabling technology\nin 6G, while some forms of AI\
    \ are realized as part of 5G. Many successful examples of\nusing AI on wireless\
    \ communications have been proposed, from physical layer designs\n(e.g., channel\
    \ estimation and precoding), to network resource allocation (e.g., trafﬁc control\n\
    and cache storage management), to security and authentication, to dynamic cell\
    \ and\ntopology formation and management, to fault prediction and detection, etc.\
    \ However,\nDL-based solutions require high computational complexity, which might\
    \ not ﬁt in current\nmobile phones [281]. Apart from the complexity, Artiﬁcial\
    \ Neural Network (ANN)-based\nRL algorithms must be carefully designed to decrease\
    \ the computational resources required\non these devices [282]. Quantum communication\
    \ [283] offers a promising approach to\navoiding the challenge of limited computational\
    \ resources and energy efﬁciency. Applying\nArtiﬁcial Neural Networks in IoT also\
    \ comes with the trade-off challenge between accuracy\nand computational/energy\
    \ requirements [282]. Tariq et al. [284] studied some of the above\nissues and\
    \ envisioned 6G to facilitate futuristic smart cities with pervasive autonomous\n\
    systems. Apart from pervasive AI, Imoize et al. [285] discussed other important\
    \ enabling\ntechnologies of 6G and their challenges. These enabling technologies\
    \ are as follows:\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2490\n51 of 63\n•\nReconﬁgurable Intelligent\
    \ Surfaces (RISs) [286] that reﬂect signals and help in places\nwhere maintaining\
    \ Line of Sight (LoS) is difﬁcult. RISs will be mainly deployed on\ndoors, windows,\
    \ and buildings.\n•\nCell-Free Massive MIMO: The massive MIMO technology is introduced\
    \ in 5G with\na more dense network of access points (APs), and this is further\
    \ developed in 6G\nto include a network with no cells (cell-free) [287]. Cell-Free\
    \ Massive MIMO im-\nproves spectral efﬁciency in communication networks, but there\
    \ are some health risks\nassociated with such a dense network of APs.\n•\nCubeSat\
    \ communication or the Internet of Space Things [288]. A CubeSat (or U-class\n\
    spacecraft) is a miniaturized spacecraft with sizes that are multiples of U, up\

    •\nTerahertz communication and Optical Wireless Technology [289].\n•\nBlockchain\
    \ technology [290] and quantum communication [283].\nThe development of futuristic\
    \ smart cities keeps up with the development of energy-\nefﬁcient 6G communication.\
    \ Kamruzzaman [291] presented the key trends in the IoT for\nenergy-efﬁcient 6G\
    \ wireless communication in smart cities. He argues that the application\nof IoT\
    \ devices to 6G in smart cities will provide a 100 Gbps data rate, <0.1 ms latency\
    \ rate,\nup to 1000 km/h mobility rate, 100 bps/Hz spectral efﬁciency, and 1000\
    \ GHz frequency.\nThis will resolve the issues of energy inefﬁciency and other\
    \ concerns in conventional\ncommunication networks. Moreover, the use of energy-efﬁcient\
    \ 6G in smart cities via IoT\ndevices probably will solve various problems that\
    \ are encountered by existing smart city\nsystems. In futuristic smart cities,\
    \ residents will use the innovative 6G brain–computer\ninterface (BCI) technology\
    \ [292] for a multi-sense experience. BCI is based on the signals\nand information\
    \ that monitor and control machines using sensible wearable headsets and\ndevices.\
    \ It uses human consciousness more than external sources for better interaction.\n\
    As humans have ﬁve senses (sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste), BCI comprises\
    \ ﬁve\ndatasets, comprising features of human senses that are used for human interaction\
    \ with the\nmachine [292].\n8. Conclusions\nUtilizing resources efficiently, reducing\
    \ operating expenses, and enhancing city\ndwellers’ quality of life are the objectives\
    \ of the smart city paradigm. This goal is ob-\ntained by combining various technologies\
    \ including IoT, WSNs, CPS, ClCom, FoC, big\ndata analytics, and robots. For this\
    \ model, the effective networking and communication\nbetween the many components\
    \ required to enable various SCAs are crucial for achieving its\nobjectives. The\
    \ ever-increasing need for networking leads to many elastic and manageable\nplatforms\
    \ for various SCAs including smart grid, smart buildings, smart home, smart water,\n\
    and smart transportation systems. The networking needs of the key SCAs were examined\n\
    in this research, and the appropriate protocols that can be applied at different\
    \ system\nlevels have been identiﬁed. Additionally, we provided examples of networking\
    \ protocols\nand smart grid, intelligent building, smart residence, and smart\
    \ transportation system\narchitectures. We concentrated on key criteria for a\
    \ variety of networking designs, such as\nenergy savings, routing, security, dependability,\
    \ mobility, and support for heterogeneous\nnetworks. In addition, we presented\
    \ open research issues.\nThis survey can assist researchers to recognize research\
    \ gaps/problems working in the\nnetworking architectures for smart cities, and\
    \ it provides an overview of available protocols\nand architectures for SCAs.\n\

  verbatim_quote1: '**Type of data most applicable to irrigation management and their
    typical sources:**


    * **Soil moisture data** indicates how much water is accessible to crops in the
    soil. To gather this data, use in-situ soil moisture sensors.

    * **Evapotranspiration data** shows how much water is lost from the farm due to
    evaporation and plant transpiration. Data collection is done on weather stations
    or through the use of satellite imagery.

    * **Weather forecast data** includes climate variables that affect irrigation
    scheduling, including rainfall, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation.
    The source of this data is the weather station.'
  verbatim_quote2: '**Relevance to specific point in outline:**

    This section is relevant to the point in the outline that discusses the "current
    state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management
    systems." The section provides a detailed overview of the current state of these
    systems, their future potential, and the challenges and proposed solutions for
    fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.'

    Using high-spatiotemporal thermal satellite ET retrievals for operational water
    use and stress monitoring in a California vineyard. Remote Sensing, 11(18), 2124.
  data_sources: Landsat and MODIS imagery
  explanation: The study used Landsat and MODIS imagery from mid-May through mid-October
    2018 over a vineyard. The experimental design sought to test the sensitivity of
    satellite ET retrievals to diﬀerences in canopy stress, so the northern blocks
    (1 and 2) were subjected to a controlled stress event. Irrigation was withheld
    for a portion of the early growing season until soil water in the root zone was
    depleted, and visible signs of stress were observed on the ground. The southern
    blocks (3 and 4) received normal deﬁcit irrigation amounts to experience typical
    target stress conditions during the study period.
  extract_1: '"To test the sensitivity of satellite ET retrievals to diﬀerences in
    canopy stress, the northern blocks (1 and 2) in the experimental vineyard were
    subjected to a controlled stress event.

    This was accomplished by withholding irrigation during a portion of the early
    growing season until the soil water in the root zone was depleted, and there were
    visible and measurable signs of stress observed on the ground, such as repressed
    shot tip growth, leaf water potentials below −1.5 MPa, and leaf senescence.

    Shortly after this stress was accomplished, irrigation recommenced at a rate roughly
    equal to a grass reference ET to avoid major negative impacts on vine and berry
    health."'
  extract_2: The southern blocks (3 and 4) were chosen to receive normal deﬁcit irrigation
    amounts and to experience typical target stress conditions as supported by leaf
    water potential measurements.

  key_findings: The study found that thermal-based ET retrievals were sensitive to
    diﬀerences in canopy stress and could be used to monitor vine water use and stress.
    In addition, the study found that satellite ET retrievals could be used for irrigation
    management in vineyards, as they could provide accurate and timely information
    on crop water use and stress.
  limitations: The study did not examine how satellite ET retrievals are affected
    by other factors that can induce canopy stress, such as disease or pests.
  main_objective: To test the sensitivity of satellite ET retrievals to diﬀerences
    in canopy stress and evaluate the utility of thermal-based ET retrievals for irrigation

    Estimated from UAV-Measured Multispectral Vegetation Indices. Sensors, 19(23),
    5250. https://doi.org/10.3390/s19235250
  explanation: 'The study aims to map maize crop coefficients (Kc) under different
    levels of water stress using automated systems for real-time irrigation management.
    The research team established a Kc empirical model based on unmanned aerial vehicle
    (UAV) multispectral remote sensing to represent the crop evapotranspiration of
    summer maize under different water stress treatments at the farm scale. The specifics
    of the study setup are as follows:


    • Five different levels of deficit irrigation treatments were applied to summer
    maize, with full irrigation (TR1) serving as the control and the other four treatments
    (TR2, TR3, TR4, and TR5) applying 84%, 84%, 72%, and 84% of the applied water
    depth of TR1 during the late vegetation, reproductive, and maturation stages,
    respectively.


    • To determine the Kc, the soil water content was recorded daily using time domain
    reflectometry (TDR) probes installed at each of the five experimental plots. The
    crop coverage (fc) was derived as the percentage of vegetation detected in mosaic
    RGB images acquired using a DJI Phantom 4 Pro UAV. A soil water balance model
    with soil water content measured by TDR was used to obtain daily crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc).


    • To estimate Kc, the vegetation index approach was employed. Kcb values were
    estimated based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) using a modified
    approach by Er-Raki et al. (2007), and Ke values were calculated from the fraction
    of vegetation cover (fc), which is strongly related to the NDVI. The Kc values
    under potential crop evapotranspiration conditions were then adjusted by considering
    the stress coefficient (Ks) to account for water stress conditions, which was
    calculated using two different vegetation index regression models proposed by
    Zhang et al. (2019):


    o Kc-1 = (1.15 * (1 - (NDVImax - NDVI)/(NDVImax - NDVImin)) + 0.9 * (1 - 1.19
    * (NDVI - NDVImin))) * (1 - CWSI-1)

    o Kc-2 = (1.15 * (1 - (NDVImax - NDVI)/(NDVImax - NDVImin)) + 0.9 * (1 - 1.19
    * (NDVI - NDVImin))) * (1 - CWSI-2)

    where CWSI-1 and CWSI-2 are the crop water stress indices derived from the TCARI/RDVI
    and TCARI/SAVI regression models, respectively.


    • The results showed that the NDVI values under different levels of deficit irrigation
    did not significantly differ in the reproductive stage but changed significantly
    in the maturation stage, with a decrease of 0.09 in TR4 compared to TR1. Two different
    methods for estimating Kc showed a good fit, with coefficients of determination
    (R2) ranging from 0.68 to 0.80 and root-mean-square errors (RMSE) ranging from
    0.140 to 0.322. Compared to Kc-2 values, Kc-1 values had better performance as
    determined by the R2 and lower RMSE in all treatments. The Kc maps retrieved using
    the Kc-1 model based on UAV multispectral remote sensing imagery showed spatial
    variations in the Kc status of maize under each irrigation treatment at DOY 231
    and DOY 240.


    The authors conclude that UAV-based multispectral images can be used to map the
    maize crop coefficient Kc and monitor irrigation requirements at the farm scale
    with high temporal and spatial representation.'
  extract_1: This work mainly focused on estimating the Kc of ﬁeld maize during the
    whole growth period and under diﬀerent water treatments. To this end, a Kc empirical
    model was established based on UAV multispectral remote sensing. NDVI was proven
    to be a reliable indicator to calculate fc and Ke.
  extract_2: The results of Kc estimated using the model in Equation (11) (Kc-1) were
    compared with those from the model in Equation (12) (Kc-2) for the maize under
    different treatments (Table 3). The Kc values derived via the two diﬀerent methods
    showed a good ﬁt, and their coeﬃcients of determination R2 varied from 0.68 to
    0.80. The RMSE values were small, within the range of 0.140 to 0.322, indicating
    adequate stability and fairly tight dispersion in the datasets. However, when
    the water stress was more serious, both the R2 and RMSE were decreased. For example,
    for Kc-1 with 32% water applied diﬀerence between TR1 and TR4, the R2 and RMSE
    values were 0.80 and 0.140 and 0.68 and 0.232, respectively. Compared with the
    Kc-2 values, the Kc-1 values had better performance as determined by the R2 and
    lower RMSE in all treatments. Therefore, the Kc-1 model was chosen to establish
    the relationship between the VIs and Kc.

  data_sources: Remote sensing technology
  explanation: The study in question focuses on the potential for automated crop irrigation
    systems to enhance water use efficiency and crop productivity. It's important
    to note that they do not address the particular point of data collection and use
    in irrigation scheduling. While the paper mentions remote sensing technology as
    a possible data source for irrigation scheduling, the specifics of how this data
    is utilized in the proposed system are not discussed.
  extract_1: Some approaches have employed signals in the thermal band obtained from
    remote sensors as inputs for energy balance equations that are solved to estimate
    ETc [17]. The multispectral VI approach for estimating crop evapotranspiration
    requires fewer inputs and theoretical background knowledge, and is thus simpler
    than the energy balance equations approach.
  extract_2: The DSS has been used in many cases. The constraints of some kinds of
    DSSs widely used in agricultural applications have not been eliminated. Firstly,
    the output of the DSS is the input information of the control system. The actual
    amount of irrigation is based on the crop’s water requirement, which is not the
    only factor in practical irrigation scheduling. The DSS should be combined with
    a VRI control system. Common methods of control systems include zone control and
    speed control [23]. Speed control varies the moving speed of the center pivot
    to accomplish the desired irrigation depth, while the duty-cycle control changes
    the on-oﬀ time of individual sprinklers or groups of sprinklers to achieve the
    desired irrigation depth.

  explanation: 'The purpose of this study, as described in the review intention, is
    to investigate the potential of using automated real-time systems for irrigation
    management. They propose a two-part system, with the first stage measuring soil
    moisture content and the second stage using plant physiology to guide irrigation
    scheduling. Plant physiology data, in the form of measurements of water potential
    in the grapevine stems, is collected. The review intention discusses the different
    technologies used in each stage of the irrigation management pipeline and their
    associated constraints and limitations.


    The study specifically uses vegetation indices (VIs) derived from spectral bands
    as proxies for water status parameters and/or yield production. They examine the
    use of simple regression and multivariable linear models, with several VI-based
    metrics extracted from the VI time series, to predict spatio-temporal variability
    in Ψstem along the growing season. They find that per-week multivariable linear
    models using variables extracted from VI time series successfully tracked spatial
    variations in Ψstem across the experimental vineyard (Pearson’s-r = 0.45–0.84;
    N = 60). A simple linear regression model enabled monitoring seasonal changes
    in Ψstem along the growing season in the vineyard (r = 0.80–0.82). Planet VIs
    and seasonal Ψstem data from the 82 vineyards were used to derive a ‘global’ model
    for in-season monitoring of Ψstem at the vineyard-level (r = 0.78; RMSE = 18.5%;
    N = 970).  The ‘global’ model, which requires only a few VI variables extracted

    \ discusses future prospects.\n\n1. **Remote sensing principles for crop water\
    \ stress monitoring:**\n   - Water stress in plants can be detected indirectly\
    \ by measuring changes in leaf and canopy temperature, which are influenced by\
    \ the plant's water status.\n   - Remote sensing techniques, such as thermal and\
    \ multispectral imaging, can be used to capture these changes and provide an assessment\
    \ of crop water stress.\n   - Thermal imaging measures the temperature of the\
    \ leaf or canopy surface, which is influenced by the rate of transpiration and\
    \ thus can indicate water stress.\n   - Multispectral imaging measures the reflectance\
    \ of light in specific wavelength bands, which can be used to calculate vegetation\
    \ indices (VIs) that are sensitive to changes in plant water content.\n\n2. **UAVs\
    \ for crop water stress monitoring in vineyards and almond orchards:**\n   - UAVs\
    \ provide a flexible and cost-effective platform for acquiring high-resolution\
    \ thermal and multispectral images of crops.\n   - UAV-based remote sensing has\
    \ been used to map spatial and temporal patterns of crop water stress in vineyards\

    \ VIs are well-correlated with traditional ground-based measures of crop water\
    \ status, such as leaf water potential and stomatal conductance.\n\n3. **Future\
    \ prospects and knowledge gaps:**\n   - Future research directions include the\
    \ development of new thermal and multispectral water stress indices that are more\
    \ sensitive to canopy transpiration.\n   - The integration of UAV-based remote\
    \ sensing with other data sources, such as weather data and soil moisture sensors,\

    \ to estimate land surface temperature (LST) using data collected from unmanned\
    \ aerial vehicles (UAVs). LST is an important parameter for agricultural applications\

  explanation: Research combines different datasets from satellite imagery, field
    data, and environmental modeling to analyze water stress on maize crops. Thermal
    infrared data from the Airborne Hyperspectral Thermal Imager (AHS) was used to
    capture canopy temperature (Tc) at varying times during the day, which serves
    as a water stress indicator. Vegetation indices extracted from optical imagery
    collected by the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) and field measurements
    provided supporting evidence for water stress detection.

    ΔF/ (r2 = 0.76) and Tl − Tair (r2 = 0.82) shows a strong association between physiological
    water stress indicators, such as chlorophyll fluorescence and temperature, and

    Chlorophyll Index (CIred-edge) with LAI (r2 = 0.64).

    between automated irrigation management systems and different data types, including
    hyperspectral imagery, to improve crop water management. The specific point the
    research is making is that the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) is a useful
    parameter for detecting water stress in maize plants. The paper provides evidence
    to support this claim by showing that PRI570, a specific type of PRI, is highly
    correlated with physiological water stress indicators such as chlorophyll fluorescence
    and temperature. This suggests that PRI570 can be used to accurately assess water
    stress in maize plants, which could be valuable information for automated irrigation
    management systems.

- explanation: 'The paper ''Vineyard Variability Analysis through UAV-Based Vigour
    Maps to Assess Climate Change Impacts'' explores the use of unmanned aerial vehicles
    (UAVs) equipped with multispectral and thermal sensors to monitor vineyards. Vigour
    maps, based on normalized diﬀerence vegetation index (NDVI), were generated to
    assess the spatial variability of the vineyard under diﬀerent phenological stages
    throughout a growing season.


    The key points of the paper are summarized below:


    1. **Multi-temporal analysis of vineyard variability:** The study employed a multi-temporal
    approach using UAV imagery captured at five diﬀerent growth stages of the grapevines.
    This allowed for the assessment of vineyard variability over time and the detection
    of changes in growth patterns.


    2. **Generation of vigour maps:** Three diﬀerent approaches were used to generate
    vigour maps, each considering varying levels of data preprocessing and normalization.
    The resulting maps provided a visual representation of the spatial distribution
    of vine vigour within the vineyard.


    3. **Spatial correlations:** The vigour maps were compared with canopy surface
    models (CSMs) derived from UAV-based elevation data and crop water stress index
    (CWSI) maps generated using thermal imagery. Spatial autocorrelation analysis
    was conducted to identify areas with similar or contrasting vigour, height, and
    water stress levels.


    4. **Assessment of climatic impacts:** The study aimed to evaluate the potential
    impacts of climate change on vineyards. The authors suggest that UAV-based monitoring
    can provide valuable data for understanding how grapevines respond to environmental
    stressors such as water scarcity and increased temperatures.


    5. **Implications for precision viticulture:** The authors emphasize the potential
    of UAV-based vigour mapping for precision viticulture. By identifying areas of
    high or low vigour, growers can implement targeted management practices to optimize
    vine health and productivity.'

    transmission**

    The paper discusses using WSN technology to facilitate data collection and transmission
    in a real-time manner. Data is collected by a variety of sensors deployed in the
    rural environment, and this data must be transmitted to a central location for
    processing. The paper describes the use of ZigBee, Wi-Fi, and other wireless communication

  extract_1: The architecture collects information about the terrain and the climatic
    conditions through a wireless sensor network deployed in the crops. This way,
    the architecture can learn about the needs of the crop and make efficient irrigation
    decisions.
  extract_2: Once the areas have been classified into two groups (or more if needed),
    this result is sent to the IMA agent through the manager agent. The IMA agent
    encodes the result-clustering into a bit sequence (a binary number), which associates
    each area of the crop with its need for irrigation. The IMA agent sends the bit
    sequence to the irrigation control device, which interprets such a sequence as
    an order that becomes an irrigation action for the crop.

  data_sources: Survey data
  explanation: The study titled "Overview of emerging technologies in sprinkler irrigation
    to optimize crop production," focuses on improving the efficiency of sprinkler
    irrigation systems in order to maximize crop yield and water conservation. One
    innovation discussed is the fixed water dispersion device for impact sprinklers,
    which plays a role in enhancing performance under low-pressure conditions. This
    device helps achieve a finer water distribution, ensuring more uniform wetting
    of the soil while minimizing runoff and loss of irrigation water.
  extract_1: There are several ways to improve the water distribution of sprinklers
    under a low pressure.  For example, an orifice nozzle, non-circular nozzles, vanes
    and fluidic devices can be installed on these sprinklers[30,31].  Li et al. developed
    a fluidic sprinkler based on the principle of “coanda effect” where water flows
    from the nozzle into a tube installed in the fluidic component to form low pressure
    area[32].  Although this application improved the water distribution, but there
    are still some difficulties in relation to the uniformity of rotation of the fluidic
    sprinkler.
  extract_2: These nozzles shoot multi-trajectory, rotating streams that apply water
    more slowly and uniformly than conventional sprays and rotors, particularly when
    adjusted for specific site conditions (Figure 1).  In addition to reducing water
    use, the water jetting from these nozzles is more resistant to wind, less likely
    to mist, and significantly reduces run-off on the irrigated field.  Rotating nozzles
    compliment that simple principle.   Rotating nozzles for pop up spray heads apply
    water much Not all pop-up spray head bodies are compatible with these nozzles.   However,
    the compatibility list is available for check with the nozzle manufacturers directly,
    while the weather decides when the sprinklers come on to save water.

- explanation: The proposed method is to use weather forecast data from government
    or private institutions, which is daily, online, and free to access for everyone,
    for irrigation scheduling by comparing the weather forecast data with measured
    data from automatic weather stations, and then assessing the data via a methodology
    that has been created. The methodology uses a previously defined Penman–Monteith
    equation for the calculation of reference evapotranspiration, the standard measure
    of evaporation used to calculate the amount of water needed to sustain the plant,
    and compares this with the weather forecast data. The forecast data is used to
    calculate irrigation scheduling and yield estimation by comparing the results
    of the forecast data with that of the data from the weather stations. This allows
    a user-friendly method for estimating evapotranspiration without requiring on-site
    weather stations, and shows promising results for irrigation scheduling based
    on reference evapotranspiration and yield estimation based on irrigation scheduling.
  extract_1: The proposed methodology based on the use of weather forecast data from
    freely and easily accessible online information for determining irrigation scheduling
    has been developed. Firstly, reference evapotranspiration (ETo) was determined
    with a user-friendly procedure that does not require previous local calibration,
    knowledge of data acquisition or processing, or a nearby weather station. The
    comparison of ETo based on short-term (same-day) and long-term (6-day-ahead) weather
    forecast data with measured data for 50 locations in southern Spain during 2013–2014
    season indicated that differences in ETo were relatively low with root-mean-square
    error (RMSE) equal to 0.65 and 0.76 mm d−1, respectively. The procedure was tested
    for a wide range of weather conditions in the development of irrigation schedules
    and yield simulations for maize crop during 2013–2014 season. Irrigation water
    depths provided by irrigation schedules based on ETo obtained from daily and weekly
    forecasts and from measured data showed differences of around 1.5 and 0.9 %, respectively.
    Likewise, yield simulation with irrigation scheduling based on forecast and measured
    data provided equal averaged values, with a relative RMSE of below 5 %. This similarity
    of irrigation scheduling and yield estimation based on forecast and measured data
    has proved the optimal performance of the proposed approach.
  extract_2: Results or irrigation scheduling Irrigation water depth Based on ETo
    values estimated in “Evaluation of ETo values using weather forecast data” section,
    irrigation scheduling for maize crop in 43 locations was carried out with four
    irrigation strategies (IS-A, IS-B, IS-C, IS-D; Table 1). The best performing approaches
    for ETo assessment with weather forecast data were those that provided more accurate
    irrigation schedules compared to those originated with PM-RIA. Daily irrigation
    scheduling based on ETo using PM-FAO56 with weather forecast data for the same-day
    (D0 forecast level) provided the most similar schedules to those generated with
    PM-RIA, with an average difference of 1.5 % (Fig. 6), demonstrating the PM-FAO56
    as the best approach to be used for daily irrigation scheduling. However, with
    the HAR approach, the underestimation in ETo previously described (Table 3) produced
    systematic underestimations in irrigation water depth (Fig. 6), with average underestimations
    of around 10 %, which were improved when the HC approach was used, reducing these
    differences to 3.5 %. Equally, the ETo overestimation using the MAK-Adv approach
    (Table 3) generated similar overestimations in irrigation water depth (around
    11 %). The differences found in irrigation water depth using HAR and MAK-Adv approaches
    with PM-RIA were statistically significant (p < 0.05; Fig. 6). This pattern was
    similar for all the irrigation strategies considered (Fig. 6). Thus, for example,
    for IS-C, rRMSE with PM-FAO56 was equal to 7.5 %, while with HAR and HC the rRMSE
    were 13.6 and 12.7 %, respectively.
  limitations:
  - There may be quality issues with the forecast data compared to measured data due
    to spatial variability and the differing measurement methods.
  - The methodology has only been tested for maize crop in semi-arid conditions, so
    the results may not be generalizable to other crops or climate conditions.
  - The methodology does not account for rainfall or soil moisture, which could impact
    the accuracy of the irrigation schedule.

      the ETo overestimation using the MAK-Adv approach (Table 3) generated similar
      overestimations in irrigation water depth (around 11 %). The differences found
      in irrigation water depth using HAR and MAK-Adv approaches with PM-RIA were
      statistically significant (p < 0.05; Fig. 6). This pattern was similar for all
      the irrigation strategies considered (Fig. 6). Thus, for example, for IS-C,
      rRMSE with PM-FAO56 was equal to 7.5 %, while with HAR and HC the rRMSE were
      13.6 and 12.7 %, respectively.
    limitations:
    - There may be quality issues with the forecast data compared to measured data
      due to spatial variability and the differing measurement methods.
    - The methodology has only been tested for maize crop in semi-arid conditions,
      so the results may not be generalizable to other crops or climate conditions.
    - The methodology does not account for rainfall or soil moisture, which could
      impact the accuracy of the irrigation schedule.

    Adaptive scheduling in deficit irrigation – a model-data fusion approach. WIT
    Transactions on Ecology and the Environment, 112, 187-200.
  data_sources: In situ sensor data on soil moisture, soil water potential, soil temperature,
    and weather conditions
  explanation: The study proposes a model-data fusion approach to improve the efficiency
    of irrigation, especially in the context of deficit irrigation strategies. This
    approach integrates sensor data and numerical models to predict soil water content
    and make irrigation decisions based on various environmental variables, such as
    rainfall, soil moisture, and ET.
  extract_1: “This paper presents the model-data fusion approach to irrigation control
    and how the technology may be applied in practising deficit irrigation.
  extract_2: Where water is particularly limiting, further reductions in irrigation
    water will be required. This has been addressed through the concept of deficit
    irrigation.  Deficit irrigation strategies deliberately allow crops to sustain
    some degree of water deficit and sometimes an associated yield reduction through
    a significant reduction of irrigation water.
  inline_citation: (Holloway-Phillips et al., 2008)
  key_findings: The simulation results demonstrate that the model-data fusion approach
    can improve water use efficiency by considering future rainfall events and practicing
    targeted irrigation application. The deficit irrigation model, which integrates
    information about future rainfall events, can reduce water consumption by up to
    27% compared to a point sensor-based irrigation strategy that does not consider
    future rainfall.
  limitations: The study is based on simulation and has not yet been validated in
    the field. The soil water diffusion model used in the simulation is a simplified
    representation of water movement in the soil and may not capture all the complexities
    of real-world soil conditions. Additionally, the study assumes that the ET and
    rainfall data used in the simulations are accurate and complete, which may not
    always be the case in real-world applications.

- explanation: The paper focuses on real-time estimation of irrigation water requirements
    for green bean crops in Egypt, which is crucial for ensuring optimal irrigation
    and mitigating water scarcity in the region. To do this, the paper utilizes machine
    learning (ML) approaches based on various input parameters. Among the different
    ML models applied, the hybrid LSTM & CNN model demonstrated superior performance
    in predicting irrigation water requirements. The study also determined the most
    influential input parameters for accurate prediction, including humidity, wind
    speed, basal crop coefficient, and soil evaporation. The findings of this research
    provide valuable insights for the application of ML in irrigation planning and
    management, with potential for improving water resource management and increasing
    crop yields.
  extract_1: "The main conclusions were reported as follow; the scenario S4 (relative\
    \ humidity, wind speed, \nbasal crop coefficient, the soil evaporation), is the\

    \ in DNN and RF model was in scenario (S7) (root depth, \nbasal crop coefficient,\
    \ the soil evaporation, fraction of surface wetted, exposed and soil wetted \n\
    fraction). The climatic factors in scenario (S6) presented the highest  R2 for\
    \ the CNN model and \nthe weakest result in the SVR model. Further, by taking\
    \ into account only the two predictors rela-\ntive humidity and wind speed, the\
    \ performance of all models ranged from very good to satisfac-\ntory fit for all\
    \ models, while it was an unsatisfactory fit for SVR."
  extract_2: "On contrast, the hybrid LTSM & CNN model was the best model for the\

  limitations: 'The study only considered a limited number of machine learning models,
    and it would be valuable to explore a wider range of models to determine if there
    are other models that perform even better for IWR prediction.

    The study did not explore the potential of ensemble learning methods, which combine

  - Crop water requirements and the soil water balance were modelled with the physically
    based HYDRUS-2D model.
  explanation: 'The study uses the soil water balance model HYDRUS-2D to simulate
    water transport in the plum orchard. The 2D geometry of HYDRUS-2D was constructed
    based on a rectangular cross-section of the orchard system, including a wetted
    bulb and non-wetted bulb. The model simulates water flow in the soil and root
    water uptake at a daily time step and outputs daily data. The model was calibrated

- explanation: "The study's objectives centered around assessing the ability of an\
    \ auto-ensembled neural network (NNE) model to predict soil moisture levels across\
    \ a variety of soil layers. The model employed a novel ensemble approach, which\
    \ involved training numerous neural networks with randomized initial parameters.\
    \ The resulting ensemble model was then evaluated for its robustness and accuracy\
    \ in predicting soil moisture dynamics throughout a three-year period. \n\nThe\
    \ researchers evaluated the model's performance using several criteria, including\
    \ the determination coefficient (R2), normalized mean bias error (nMBE), normalized\
    \ mean absolute error (nMAE), normalized root mean square error (nRMSE), and mean\
    \ absolute percentage error (MAPE). These metrics indicated that the NNE model\
    \ achieved high accuracy, with an average R2 of 0.96 and nRMSE of 5.93% over the\
    \ three-year period.\n\nThe study also investigated the impact of the number of\
    \ neural networks included in the ensemble on the model's performance. The results\
    \ showed that utilizing more neural networks, up to a point, led to improvements\
    \ in accuracy. However, the researchers found that using more than 38 neural networks\
    \ with randomized initial parameters did not offer significant further benefits.\n\
    \nThe study concluded that the NNE model provides a robust and accurate method\
    \ for predicting soil moisture dynamics. This approach has the potential to be\
    \ utilized in irrigation scheduling systems, leading to more efficient and sustainable\

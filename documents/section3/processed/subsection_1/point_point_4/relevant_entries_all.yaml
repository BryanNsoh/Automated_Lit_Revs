    Get rights and content Highlights • Systematic literature review of IoT applications
    in agro-industry and environment during 2006–2016. • Clustering of IoT applications
    into four domains: monitoring, control, prediction, and logistics. • Visualization
    of key technologies used to develop the IoT applications. • Discussion of trends
    and open challenges. • Proposal of an IoT architecture for agro-industrial and
    environmental applications based on the research findings. Abstract This paper
    reviews agro-industrial and environmental applications that are using Internet
    of Things (IoT). It is motivated by the need to identify application areas, trends,
    architectures and open challenges in these two fields. The underlying survey was
    developed following a systematic literature review using academic documents written
    in English and published in peer-reviewed venues from 2006 to 2016. Selected references
    were clustered into four application domains corresponding to: monitoring, control,
    logistics, and prediction. Implementation-specific details from each selected
    reference were compiled to create usage distributions of sensors, actuators, power
    sources, edge computing modules, communication technologies, storage solutions,
    and visualization strategies. Finally, the results from the review were compiled
    into an IoT architecture that represents a wide range of current solutions in
    agro-industrial and environmental fields. Previous article in issue Next article

    literature review 1. Introduction The widespread of Internet in the last two decades
    brought countless benefits to citizens and organizations around the world. Arguably
    the most important benefit was the ability to consume and produce data and services
    in real time. Recently, the Internet of Things is promising to bring the same
    benefits to everyday objects, giving us a way to extend our perception and our
    ability to modify the environment around us. In this context, agro-industrial
    and environmental fields are ideal candidates for the deployment of IoT solutions
    because they occur in wide areas that need to be continuously monitored and controlled.
    At the same time, IoT opens new opportunities beyond ground floor automation when
    the collected data are used to feed machine learning algorithms to provide predictions
    (Saville et al., 2015), easing decision planning and decision making for owners,
    managers, and policy makers. IoT can be used at different levels in the agro-industrial
    production chain (Medela et al., 2013). It can help to evaluate field variables
    such as soil state, atmospheric conditions, and biomass of plants or animals.
    It can also be used to assess and control variables such as temperature, humidity,
    vibration, and shock during the product transport (Pang et al., 2015). It can
    be used to monitor and predict the product state and its demand on shelves or
    inside refrigerators. In addition, it can provide information to the final user/consumer
    about the origin and properties of the product. The IoT applied to the agro-industry
    can contribute to create an informed, connected, developed and adaptable rural
    community. Under the IoT paradigm, low-cost electronic devices can improve human
    interaction with the physical world, and the computing power and software available
    on the Internet can provide valuable analytics. In summary, IoT can be an important
    tool in the years to come for people interacting within an agro-industrial system:
    suppliers, farmers, technicians, distributors, business men, consumers, and government
    representatives. IoT can be incorporated into environmental applications to produce
    dense and real-time maps of air and water pollution, noise level (Torres-Ruiz
    et al., 2016, Hachem et al., 2015), temperature, and harmful radiation among others.
    It can be used to collect and store environmental records, check the compliance
    of environmental variables with local policies, trigger alerts, or send recommendation
    messages to citizens and authorities (Liu et al., 2013). Once the data reach the
    cloud, governments can feed predictive models to forecast environmental variables,
    and identify and track pollution sources over time and space, ultimately leading
    to faster and better decisions to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all
    citizens. Based on the potential of IoT applications in agro-industrial and environmental
    fields described in the previous paragraphs, this paper aims to identify the current
    state of solutions in these fields, as well as the trends, architectures, technologies
    and open challenges. This paper uses a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) based
    on a methodology proposed by Kitchenham and Charters (2007), in order to make
    it unbiased in terms of information selection, processing, and presentation of
    results. The paper is structured as follows. Sections 2 Planning, 3 Conduction,
    4 Results describe the stages of planning, conduction, and results of the SLR.
    Section 5 outlines some recent works that were published online after the SLR
    was concluded. Section 6 includes a discussion of the obtained results, and Section
    7 presents the conclusions from this study. 2. Planning During this stage of the
    SLR, the protocol was defined. This included: research questions, search strategies,
    selection criteria, data mining and synthesis methodologies. For this study, the
    two research questions considered were: 1. What are the main technological solutions
    of the Internet of Things in agro-industrial and environmental fields? 2. Which
    infrastructure and technology are using the main solutions of IoT in agro-industrial
    and environmental fields? To collect information, authors performed an Internet
    search using various academic digital libraries and search engines. Obtained results
    were manually compiled in order to select the best information sources to answer
    the two research questions. After analyzing the results, digital libraries and
    search engines described in Table 1 were chosen based on their scientific and
    technical content, as well as their close relationship to areas of knowledge associated
    with the objective of this paper. Table 1. Information sources used for the search

    Search Engine https://scholar.google.com/ The next step was to define search terms
    and a consistent procedure to seek scientific and technical documentation in the
    digital libraries and search engines. To define the search terms, a set of keywords
    was selected from the research questions to create two groups of words which are
    shown in Table 2. Each group contained consolidated expressions with synonyms
    or terms with related meaning. Group 1 included words associated with the Internet
    of Things, while Group 2 contained a set of terms related to the agro-industry
    and environment. Logical operators supported by the advanced search of digital
    libraries were used to construct search strings, based on the two research questions,
    combining terms from Groups 1 and 2 of Table 2. The general structure of the search
    queries that were applied to the information sources is presented in Table 3.

    order to ensure the quality of papers, only those that passed the following criteria
    were considered in the reviewing process. • Documents published in peer-reviewed
    conferences, peer-reviewed journals, papers from computer science or engineering
    organizations, patents, or technical reports. • Documents published in English.
    • Documents published between 2006 and 2016 (both years inclusive). If the main
    topic of a given paper was irrelevant or if it was outside the scope of this study,
    it was deleted. Then, a selection criterion was applied in order to reduce the
    number of papers found during the search and to get a small number of high-quality
    sources that could be used to answer the research questions. This involved using
    inclusion criteria (IC) and quality criteria (QC), which were defined in a three-phase
    process. • IC based on abstracts: in this phase, authors discarded papers found
    in the search stage based on the information provided in their abstracts. Papers
    that satisfied the first inclusion criterion were kept for further processing,
    i.e. papers that discussed IoT solutions applied to agro-industry and environment.
    Papers with little relevant information in their abstract were temporarily kept
    in the list and were processed in the next stage. It is important to highlight
    that quality criteria were not considered in this phase. • IC based on full reading:
    in this phase, papers that did not address the search terms shown in Table 2 were
    removed. This means that even though those papers contained the search terms in
    their abstract, they only represented minor aspects of them. • IC based on quality
    analysis: in this phase, a quality analysis was applied to remaining papers and
    those that did not comply any of the following four quality criteria (QC) were
    discarded: – QC1: Does the study present a comprehensive solution of IoT for agro-industry
    or environment? – QC2: Does the paper show details of the infrastructure and/or
    technologies used to implement the proposed solution? – QC3: Does the paper present
    a state of the art or related work? – QC4: Does the paper present an analysis
    of the results? The next stage of the SLR was data mining and synthesis. The goal
    here was to extract the information needed to answer the research questions in
    an objective manner. The information fields extracted for each study are presented
    in Table 4. Table 4. Form used to extract data for each study. Data retrieved

    in the previous section was used to search, select and evaluate preliminary papers.
    For the search process, the query defined in Table 3 was passed to information
    sources given in Table 1. The search was limited to title, abstract and keywords.
    Fig. 1 illustrates the conduction process discriminated by the academic database
    and search engine used, highlighting the key steps followed to select relevant
    studies for this review. Initially, 3578 studies were recovered from electronic
    databases. Firstly, duplicates were excluded, i.e. studies available in more than
    one database, eliminating 849 copies. Out of the 2729 remaining studies, 2652
    were initially screened based on inclusion and exclusion criteria applied to the
    title, abstract, and keywords. These papers were marked to be downloaded, and
    references that could not be retrieved were discarded. Afterward, these studies
    were evaluated using quality criteria obtaining 720 studies. These studies were
    used to extract the data defined in Table 4. Finally, only 72 main studies were
    selected based on their quality for the final conduction phase and used to extract
    results presented in the next section. Download : Download high-res image (236KB)

    main studies. It is worth to note that more than 90% of included papers were retrieved
    from two sources: IEEExplore (76.4%) and Scopus (13.9%). In contrast, the least
    effective sources of information were Microsoft Academic Search and Microsoft
    Academic. They retrieved 668 papers during the first stage of the conduction phase
    (representing 25.2% of all retrieved papers, and only behind IEEExplore with 45%).
    However, only 3.1% of them were included for the next reviewing phase, a number
    well below the 39.8% of papers included from IEEExplore. These facts can be explained
    because IEEExplore and Scopus have complete and usable advanced search systems
    and they have been operating continuously unlike Microsoft’s counterpart (Sinha
    et al., 2015a). Fig. 2 enumerates the number of primary studies classified by
    publication year. It can be seen that most of the selected papers were published
    between 2012 and 2016. It should be highlighted that the small number of papers
    shown in 2016 can be explained because the initial search was made in April of
    that year. Download : Download high-res image (127KB) Download : Download full-size

    results of the SLR in order to answer the two research questions based on the
    information extracted from main studies selected. 4.1. Answer to the first research
    question To identify the main technological solutions of IoT in agro-industry
    and environmental fields, studies were grouped into four technological domains,
    corresponding to: (1) monitoring, (2) control, (3) prediction and (4) logistics.
    Results are summarized in Table 5 and illustrated in Fig. 4. From this figure,
    it can be seen that most of the selected studies were focused on monitoring (62%),
    followed by control (25%), logistics (7%), and prediction (6%). Table 5. Clustering

    image Fig. 4. Distribution of papers selected by application domain. Selected
    papers grouped in the monitoring domain dealt with remote sensing of physical
    and environmental parameters gathered in scenarios such as crops and farms using
    a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). The main goal of this domain was the acquisition
    of information without an operator and its transmission to a server or data center
    for processing and visualization. Integrated monitoring tools made it possible
    to maintain a continuous communication with the deployed WSN, and access stored
    data through the Internet. Hence, smart agriculture based on IoT adds value to
    farmers by helping them to collect relevant data from crops and farms using sensor
    devices. Some IoT setups could display, process and analyze remote data applying
    cloud services in order to provide new insights and recommendations for better
    decision-making. IoT solutions categorized in monitoring domain can be divided
    into three architectural layers (Zou, 2014): (i) a perception layer supported
    by a WSN; (ii) a network layer where the sensor information travels a long distance
    using different protocols and Gateways, and (iii) an application layer that includes
    a web server and a database. Moreover, IoT solutions grouped in this domain are
    interested in monitoring several types of physical variables depending on the
    subdomain to which they belong. Specifically, the following subdomains were identified:
    air monitoring (34.5%), soil monitoring (27.3%), water monitoring (16.4%), plant
    monitoring (10.9%), and others (10.9%) which include areas such as aquaculture
    and animal monitoring. It is worth to highlight that most of the selected studies
    retrieved in this SLR can be categorized in more than one subdomain. For instance,
    the system proposed in Zou (2014) is used for online crop growth monitoring and
    it captures different types of variables such as: temperature, humidity, soil
    moisture, CO2, luminosity, pH of water, and images. Some representative examples
    of IoT applications categorized in the monitoring domain are described below.
    • Air monitoring: this subdomain aimed to provide periodic or continuous measurements,
    evaluating and determining environmental parameters or pollution levels in order
    to prevent negative and damaging effects. It also included the forecasting of
    possible changes in the ecosystem or the biosphere as a whole. For instance, in
    Watthanawisuth et al. (2009) authors described an agricultural IoT solution which
    can be categorized in the air monitoring subdomain. In this solution, authors
    proposed a real-time monitoring system of micro climate based on a WSN. The solution
    included temperature and relative humidity sensors (SHT15) powered by solar panels
    and supported by ZigBee communication technology. Another air monitoring IoT solution
    is GEMS (Lu et al., 2010), which proposed an environmental monitoring system based
    on GPRS technology for monitoring apple orchards. This system was tested on five
    different regions of China over a 2-year period by monitoring variables such as
    relative humidity, temperature, and radiation. • Soil monitoring: papers classified
    in this subdomain such as (Chen et al., 2014, Mafuta et al., 2012) proposed systems
    for monitoring multi-layer soil temperature and moisture in a farmland fields
    using WSN. These systems are supported by communication technologies such as ZigBee,
    GPRS and Internet, where user interaction with the system is handled by a web
    application. • Water monitoring: primary studies categorized in this subdomain
    intend to monitor water pollution or water quality by sensing chemicals, pH, and
    temperature, which can alter the natural state of water. An example of this subdomain
    is presented in Postolache et al. (2013), where authors proposed an IoT solution
    for water quality assessment through the measurement of conductivity, temperature,
    and turbidity. The solution is based on a WSN architecture that combines low-cost
    sensing devices and monitoring of multiple parameters of water quality of shallow
    waters (lakes, estuaries, rivers) in urban areas. Similarly, (Xijun et al., 2009)
    proposed a WSN system for monitoring water level and rainfall in irrigation systems.
    • Plant monitoring: The LOFAR-agro Project (Langendoen et al., 2006) is an example
    of plant or crop monitoring. This project aimed to protect a potato crop against
    phytophthora (a genus of water mold) by monitoring the microclimate (humidity
    and temperature) using a large-scale WSN. The system intended to generate a policy
    to protect the crop against the fungal disease based on the collected data. In
    Fourati et al. (2014), authors propose a Web-based decision support system communicating
    with a WSN for irrigation scheduling in olive fields. For this purpose, authors
    use sensors to measure humidity, solar radiation, temperature, and rain. • Animal
    monitoring: This subdomain referred to animal tracking for both wildlife and animal
    husbandry activities. A research belonging to this subdomain was a delay-tolerant
    WSN for the monitoring and tracking of six horses presented in Ehsan et al. (2012).
    For this purpose, authors developed necklaces that acquired information about
    horses’ position and speed at a given time, and transmitted such logs to fixed
    nodes when they were close to its coverage area. Another example of animal monitoring
    was given by Jain et al. (2008), where an IoT solution was responsible for monitoring
    the behavior and migration patterns of Swamp Deers, obtaining information of the
    animal position and the climate at the same time. Papers selected and grouped
    under the domain of control use remote actuator devices deployed on-site. Unlike
    monitoring domain applications, which handle information in one-way, applications
    categorized in control use a two-way information channel. This means that a new
    level of communication was added, and commands could be sent back to the field.
    In this case, information from the server or data center traveled to a Wireless
    Sensor and Actuator Network (WSAN) in order to control a set of actuator devices
    to modify the state of the process or environment. Commands were sent through
    a human–computer interface or as a result of a decision algorithm supported by
    analytic modules. Actuator devices included valves, pumps, humidifiers, and alarms
    among others. Many of these systems aimed to optimize the usage of water, fertilizers,
    and pesticides based on information provided by weather prediction systems and
    on-site WSN. Solutions in this domain could help farmers to reduce water consumption
    and waste by scheduling irrigation times and quantities according to the state
    of the crop and its growth cycle. Control systems were programmed to be adaptive,
    for instance, switching off sprinkler if rain was detected. Overall, solutions
    with control systems could save money to the farmer and provide at the same time
    valuable insights about the consumption of water, fertilizers, pesticides, and
    electricity. Actuator devices used by IoT solutions grouped in the control domain
    depended heavily on the subdomain to which they belonged. In this paper, the following
    subdomains were considered: irrigation (72.22%), fertilizers (5.56%), pesticides
    (5.56%), illumination (5.56%), and access control (5.56%). During the review,
    it was found that some studies used actuators in the domain of logistics (5.56%).
    Representative examples of IoT applications categorized in the control domain
    are described next. • Irrigation control: A precision irrigation solution based
    on wireless sensor network was proposed by Kanoun et al. (2014). The main challenge
    of that study was to create an automated irrigation system which could reduce
    water waste, saving energy, time, and money. This system was built using three
    nodes based on the TelosB mote: (i) a node to measure soil moisture and soil temperature;
    (ii) a node to measure environmental parameters such as air temperature, air humidity,
    wind speed and brightness; and (iii) a node that was connected to a valve for
    irrigation control. Data were transmitted to a base station for storage and were
    sent to the farmer’s PC to allow him to take action. Another precision irrigation
    IoT system was proposed by Jiao et al. (2014). This included an environmental
    monitoring system for agricultural management, as well as the implementation of
    precision dripping. The system considered an IoT ecosystem divided into three
    layers corresponding to sensing, transmission, and application. A WSN was used
    to perceive environmental information in real time within a tomato greenhouse,
    to later transmit the data to a remote server management system. In Shuwen and
    Changli (2015) researchers described a remote farmland irrigation monitoring solution
    based on ZigBee. The system included a solar-powered irrigation control system
    that also monitored air temperature, humidity and soil temperature. • Fertilizer
    and pesticide control: IoT solutions categorized in this subdomain applied conservation
    practices to improve nutrient usage, efficiency, crop quality, overall yield,
    and economic return while reducing off-site transport of nutrients. In Pahuja
    et al. (2013), authors developed an online micro-climate monitoring and control
    system for greenhouses. The system was supported by a WSN to gather and analyze
    plant-related sensor data to produce actions to control the climate, fertilization,
    irrigation, and pests. • Illumination control: authors in Yoo et al. (2007) described
    an automated agriculture system based on WSN for monitoring greenhouses used to
    grow melons and cabbages. The system monitored the growing process of crops and
    controlled the greenhouse’s environment. Some of the variables measured included
    ambient light, temperature, and humidity. For the greenhouse with melons, the
    system could control the illumination by changing the light state through a relay.
    • Access control: An agricultural intrusion detection system was presented in
    Roy et al. (2015). The proposed system generated alarms in the farmers house and
    sent a text message to the farmer’s mobile phone when an intruder entered the
    crop field. Selected papers categorized in the prediction domain were focused
    on providing knowledge and tools to farmers to support decision making. They had
    specific modules for these tasks in their architecture, and their predicted variables
    were grouped as follows: environmental conditions (42.86%), production estimation
    (42.86%), and crop growth (14.29%). • Environmental conditions: A representative
    example of environmental condition prediction is proposed in Khandani and Kalantari
    (2009), where authors described a design methodology to determine the spatial
    sampling of humidity sensors for the soil within a WSN. They used a historical
    database of dense soil-humidity measurements to determine the behavior of the
    2D correlation that exists between the measurements of nearby sensors. This was
    used later to find the largest spatial sampling that ensured a user-defined variance
    for the estimation on any given point of interest in the space. Authors found
    that the spatial correlation function decays exponentially with the distance between
    sensors. Another example of the prediction of environmental conditions was presented
    in Luan et al. (2015), which described a system that integrates drought monitoring
    and forecasting as well as irrigation prediction using IoT. • Production estimation:
    Authors in Lee et al. (2013) presented an IoT-based agricultural production system
    for stabilizing supply and demand of agricultural products. They achieved this
    goal by sensing environmental variables and by developing a prediction system
    for the growth and yield of crops. In a different application, (Saville et al.,
    2015) introduced a real-time estimation system for fixed-net fishery using ultrasonic
    sensors and supervised learning. • Crop growth: a dynamic analysis of farmlands
    using mobile sensors was presented in Lee et al. (2012). The developed system
    aimed to establish growth-control plans for grapes, and viticulture activities.
    The last domain used to categorize selected studies was logistics. Logistics in
    agriculture refers to the physical flow of entities and related information from
    producer to consumer to satisfy consumer demand. It includes: agricultural production,
    acquisition, transportation, storage, loading and unloading, handling, packaging,
    distribution, and related activities. Some objectives of logistics in agriculture
    include: adding value to agricultural products, saving money in distribution costs,
    improving shipping efficiency, reducing unnecessary losses, and to some extent,
    avoiding risks (Liping, 2012). Primary studies in logistics were further divided
    in: production (55.6%), commerce (22.2%) and transport(22.2%). The next paragraphs
    include representative studies of each subdomain. • Production: in Feng et al.
    (2012) researchers proposed an intelligent system for monitoring an apple orchard
    that implemented suggestions based on data. The system aimed to reduce management
    costs of apple orchards, improve apple quality, and provide detailed, comprehensive
    and accurate electronic information for planting works, pest warnings, and production-quality
    tracking of apples. The system included WSN using Zigbee, GPRS, and IoT providing
    detailed monitoring data of apple growth for agricultural cooperatives, to support
    for decision making in farming. • Commerce: (Li et al., 2013) presented an information
    system for agriculture based on IoT which used a distributed architecture. In
    that study, tracking and tracing of the whole agricultural production process
    were made with distributed IoT servers. Moreover, an information-discovery system
    was designed to implement, capture, standardize, manage, locate, and query business
    data from agricultural production. The system also allowed consumers to query
    information of agricultural products to verify their authenticity and quality.
    • Transport: A representative example of this subdomain is presented in Pang et
    al. (2015), where an IoT architecture was proposed for the food-production and
    commercialization chain. This paper dealt with logistics involved in the transportation
    of melons from Brazil to Sweden in a journey that takes 46 days. Sensor nodes
    measured conditions in the environment including oxygen, carbon dioxide, ethylene,
    temperature, humidity, and mechanical stress, such as vibrations, tilts, and shocks.

    selected by application subdomain. 4.2. Answer to the second research question
    Infrastructure and technology used by selected IoT solutions in agro-industrial
    and environmental fields were organized in seven groups, corresponding to: (i)
    sensing variables, (ii) actuator devices, (iii) power sources, (iv) communication
    technologies, (v) edge computing technologies (Shi et al., 2016), (vi) storage
    strategies, and (vii) visualization strategies. • Sensing variables: about 26%
    of analyzed studies sense temperature, followed by humidity, physicochemical properties,
    and radiation with 16%, 11%, and 10%, respectively. Particularly, temperature
    and physicochemical sensors are distributed in all subdomains as it can be seen
    in Fig. 6. Similarly, 55% of sensors are used for air monitoring. Thus, air temperature
    and humidity, soil moisture and solar radiation, can be considered universal variables
    in agricultural applications. Download : Download high-res image (324KB) Download

    studies is shown in Fig. 7. It can be stated that there are far fewer actuator
    devices than sensors currently being used in these studies and that most of them
    are concentrated in applications of control and logistics. In fact, more than
    60% of actuators reported were found in irrigation processes. Download : Download

    device used. • Power sources: currently, most monitoring applications prefer rechargeable
    batteries connected to solar panels, which offer a simple but sustainable energy
    supply. In contrast, control applications that typically have demanding energy
    requirements prefer the electrical grid. These trends can be appreciated in Fig.
    8. Recent power sources, such as electromagnetic or vibration harvesters were
    not found in selected studies showing that these approaches must mature and gain
    popularity for agricultural and environmental applications. Download : Download

    • Communication technologies: Fig. 9 shows that most studies (40%) used Wireless
    Personal Area Network (WPAN) protocols such as Bluetooth and ZigBee, followed
    by Wireless Metropolitan Area Network (WMAN) with 36% of the studies mainly supported
    by cellular technologies (GPRS/GSM/3G/4G). Meanwhile, the near-field communication,
    which is relatively new, has started to emerge in some field applications. Download

    technologies. • Edge computing technologies: microcontroller platforms were chosen
    in more than half of the applications reviewed. Interestingly, Single Board Computers
    (SBC) are not yet appropriate for edge computing in IoT agricultural applications.
    The complete distribution of edge computing technologies is shown in Fig. 10.

    it is clear that even though Cloud storage represents a key service for IoT systems,
    only 7.32% of selected studies used it. This shows that most researchers preferred
    their own data-storage implementation. Download : Download high-res image (78KB)

    strategies: Fig. 12 shows the distribution of three different visualization strategies:
    web, mobile and local, in four subdomains: monitoring, control, prediction, and
    logistics. It can be stated that web-based solutions were the preferred strategy
    to visualize reports in all subdomains of applications. Download : Download high-res

    Most of the selected works do not address security issues explicitly and leave
    them on a side. However, some efforts in this domain were found. For instance,
    (Jardak et al., 2009) described the design of a WSN that implemented a RANdom
    SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) filter to eliminate inconsistent sensor-node data due
    to the presence of faulty or malicious nodes in the network. Sun et al. (2012)
    presented a dam monitoring system where users needed to sign in through the main
    interface in order to validate their credentials. Tao et al. (2014) selected AppWeb
    as the embedded Web server for the IoT Gateway of an intelligent granary management
    system because it could add the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to enable
    encrypted data connection. This was valuable because the network information was
    vulnerable as it came from a wireless channel. Kuroda et al. (2015) proposed a
    WSN with easy-to-use secure communication that was implemented using Zero-admin
    encrypt/decrypt functions at the MAC level with the Advanced Encryption Standard
    (AES-128), which enabled automatic encryption/decryption of messages between each
    sensor node and the coordinator node. 5. Recent works The following paragraphs
    are devoted to introducing some recent and representative works that were available
    online between May 2016 and July 2017, beyond the initial scope of the SLR process
    described so far. They cover areas such as communications, energy management,
    monitoring and logistics for agro-industrial and environmental applications. 5.1.
    Communications Low-power WAN (LPWAN) technologies such as SigFox, LoRa, narrowband
    IoT and others are becoming popular within IoT applications due to its reduced
    energy requirements, wide coverage range, and low-cost when compared to other
    long-distance technologies according to Barrachina-Muñoz et al. (2017). For example,
    in a recent survey by Sinha et al. (2017), authors found that LoRa is the best
    option for smart agriculture applications. In Lukas et al. (2015), authors designed
    a long-range water level monitoring system for troughs using a WSN based on LoRa
    transceivers, allowing the cattleman to observe water availability for livestock
    even when the barn was 1 or 3 km away. In a different application, (Pham et al.,
    2016) proposed an IoT framework to contribute to rural development implementing
    agricultural applications supported by open-source hardware and long-range communication
    devices. The first deployment of this solution used LoRa transceivers since rural
    villages were located in remote areas and it was convenient to have a low-cost
    and non-proprietary infrastructure. 5.2. Energy management One of the main requirements
    for devices used in IoT projects is that they must be energy-efficient according
    to Borgia (2014). This is particularly important for pervasive solutions deployed
    outdoors that can not be powered from the electric grid nor regularly maintained
    because they are installed in difficult or remote environments. In WSN scenarios,
    the current challenge is to develop multi-source energy harvesters and ultra-efficient
    sensors to create battery-free solutions, (Shaikh and Zeadally, 2016). These considerations
    are very important for IoT solutions for agro-industrial and environmental problems
    as recharging batteries is not practical and ambient energy sources are usually
    available. In terms of smart energy control for IoT projects, (Wang et al., 2016)
    proposed a novel energy management strategy for solar powered devices that intend
    to power the load directly from the solar cell, avoiding power converters and
    energy storage elements that contribute to energy losses, greater weight/volume
    ratio, and higher price. Another trend that is likely to continue is the development
    of self-power devices, such as the soil water content sensor for an autonomous
    landslide surveillance system designed by Lu et al. (2016). In this case, the
    sensor used the soil moisture to power itself making it suitable for large scale
    deployments. Marjanović et al. (2016) described a cloud-based decision-making
    mechanism for managing sensor data acquisition that is applicable to collaborative
    sensing solutions using distributed sensors, like mobile devices, to efficiently
    monitor large geographical areas. The system selected which sensors had to upload
    the information to the cloud to prevent the acquisition of redundant information
    from other nearby sensors for a specific coverage area, maintaining a spatial
    sampling quality and reducing in this way the battery depletion of the devices.
    5.3. Monitoring Recent environmental monitoring solutions are now offering additional
    capabilities in terms of decision making and management. For example, (Giorgetti
    et al., 2016) proposed a custom-made landslide risk monitoring system based on
    a WSN that allows fast deployments in hostile environments without human intervention
    because the system is able to deal with node failure and poor-quality communication
    links reorganizing the network by itself. Wong and Kerkez (2016) presented a Web
    service and real-time data architecture that includes an adaptive controller that
    updates the parameters of each sensing node within a WSN based on a previously
    defined policy. Zheng et al. (2016) proposed an IoT management system to protect
    the ecological and environmental quality while building an artificial river where
    nature and city converge. The system monitored key elements like soil, water,
    atmosphere, and wind at a high spatial resolution over a large area. Edwards-Murphy
    et al. (2016) introduced a beehive monitoring system that collects internal and
    external data to describe the status of the bee colony from a set of possible
    states using a classification algorithm based on decision trees. This information
    was used to determine if a visit to the beehive was required or not. As an additional
    result, authors found a strong correlation between the beehive status and the
    short-term rain forecast. Overall, this study is relevant for agriculture because
    crop pollination depends on honey bees. Sarangi et al. (2016) presented a framework
    for an automated crop-disease advisory service that integrates the interoperability
    of an IoT web repository with an agricultural advisory call center. The implemented
    system processes images of the diseased plant sent by the farmer, and then it
    provides the plant diagnosis and the corresponding management recommendation for
    the disease. 5.4. Logistics Food safety and quality control in logistics are emerging
    as IoT agribusiness areas in response to the demand from businesses and end consumers
    to obtain real-time information about food supply chain and “farm-to-fork” traceability.
    For instance, (Ruan and Shi, 2016) presented an IoT framework to assess the fruit
    freshness on e-commerce deliveries, which is a non-traditional retail service
    that faces unique challenges in transportation due to the product perishability
    and expensive logistics. Similarly, (Liu et al., 2016) introduced a pilot project
    using IoT to monitor food safety throughout the product life cycle, helping authorities
    and consumers to trace the food and make better decisions before buying it. In
    a related work, (Wang and Yue, 2017) proposed an early-warning system for food
    safety that automatically warns about product quality risks and incidents by sharing
    and centralizing information among supply chains. Lastly, (Capello et al., 2016)
    developed a business-to-business monitoring service based on IoT that provides
    geo-located information (humidity and temperature) about food storage and transportation
    without a vendor lock-in infrastructure. 6. Discussion 6.1. Limitations and open
    challenges After analyzing the difficulties and limitations described in selected
    papers from the SLR, the following list summarizes a few insights that aim to
    contribute to the mass adoption of IoT solutions in agricultural and environmental
    fields. • Stronger standardization: it will help to improve compatibility among
    different vendors and to ensure stronger security measures across the entire IoT
    stack, starting from field devices all the way up to cloud providers and end-user
    interfaces (Pang et al., 2015). • Better power management: it will increase the
    endurance of IoT solutions because nowadays the main factor limiting the lifespan
    of IoT deployments is energy depletion (Jain et al., 2008, Chen et al., 2014,
    Islam et al., 2014, Diedrichs et al., 2014). The lifespan can be improved by lowering
    the power consumption of each electronic module, including energy harvesters,
    and using alternative power storage mechanisms as replacements of rechargeable
    batteries, which affect the expiration date of deployed devices. • Security: a
    major challenge in the realization of the IoT in agriculture is the security problem
    (Jiang and Zhang, 2013), and the few works that consider it only incorporate fragmented
    strategies to mitigate it. Therefore, it is evident that there is a need for agro-industrial
    and environmental IoT solutions that address end-to-end information security and
    physical integrity of field devices. • Design using modular hardware and software:
    it will enable a greater degree of reuse and customization for the end user (Pang
    et al., 2015). • Improve unit cost: even though the cost of embedded computing
    platforms have been decreasing sharply, the same is not true for high-quality
    sensors and actuators. In order to deploy IoT solutions with hundreds and possibly
    thousands of nodes, the overall hardware, Internet access and international data
    roaming costs have to be reduced even further (Pang et al., 2015). • Aim for a
    good compatibility with legacy infrastructure: similarly to what has happened
    in industrial automation, it is important to deliver IoT solutions that can be
    integrated with the customer’s existing infrastructure such as specialized equipment,
    field machines, and software. • Consider scalability early on: with an increasing
    number of devices in large deployments, data synchronization and data reliability
    become critical (Diedrichs et al., 2014). • Adopt good practices of software engineering:
    as the scale and endurance of deployed IoT solutions grow, the time and effort
    devoted to analyzing generated data, refining the code, and adding new features
    will explode unless the software is well designed and documented (Hussain et al.,
    2006, Jayaraman et al., 2015a). • Improve robustness for field deployments: commercial
    IoT solution should be able to handle strong changes in temperature, humidity,
    and illumination to deal with seasonal changes and worldwide climate variability.
    • User-centered design: the installation and management of corresponding IoT nodes
    should be straight forward for non-expert users. Additionally, the hardware must
    require very little or none human maintenance during its lifespan, and the underlying
    communication network should be intelligent enough to reconfigure or heal itself
    in the case of a node failure. • Contribute to the IoT the ecosystem: there is
    a noticeable void in the literature on how to improve and adapt IoT solutions
    for real-world applications beyond simple prototypes (Chen et al., 2015). • Sustainable
    practices: even if the most humble predictions about the worldwide adoption of
    IoT devices become a reality, recycling strategies will have to be taken into
    account for new solutions deployed on the field, as an integral part of the product
    life cycle to reduce the environmental impact. 6.2. Proposed architecture To summarize
    the findings of this study, authors proposed the IoT architecture for agro-industrial
    and environmental applications that is illustrated in Fig. 13. This encapsulates
    most of the studies analyzed in this paper. The architecture has four main layers:
    physical, communication, service, and application. The physical layer includes
    perception and control. In perception, the main objective is to produce valuable
    data sensing field variables using a WSN. Data produced are sent to the communication
    layer through field gateways. Devices in the perception layer can be powered by
    batteries for short-term deployments or by solar panels because of their low-power
    consumption. In contrast, the control layer acts as a data sink, receiving information
    from a communication layer or a perception layer in the simplest case. Information
    received in the control layer alters the state of field actuators frequently requiring
    power from the electrical grid. In the middle of the perception and control layers
    there is a mobile robot that can be used when fixed devices are not the best option.
    In the communication layer, the objective is to move the information from the
    physical layer to the Internet, collecting data from IoT gateways based either
    on Ethernet or mobile networks (e.g: GPRS/3G/4G/NB-IoT and eventually 5G). This
    layer includes field gateways acting as interfaces between IoT gateways and transceivers
    using ZigBee, Bluetooth, NFC, WiFi, LoRA, or Sigfox. The service layer handles
    data ingestion from the communication layer, as well as their storage, analytics,
    visualization, and security. Finally, the application layer consumes services
    from the previous layer in the architecture and allows the user to handle monitoring,
    control, prediction, and logistics. Download : Download high-res image (717KB)

    review of IoT applications for agro-industrial and environmental fields. It was
    guided by a systematic literature review, and therefore the methodology and intermediate
    results obtained during the stages of planning, conduction, and results were reported
    in great detail. From 3578 initial studies extracted from electronic sources,
    72 main studies were selected based on their relevance to answer two research
    questions. Selected studies came from five continents, and Asian countries contributed
    to more than half of them. During this study, it was discovered that most of the
    research still focuses on monitoring applications (62%); however there is a growing
    interest in closing the loop by doing control (25%), and there are some preliminary
    solutions in logistics and prediction (13%) for agro-industrial and environmental
    applications using IoT. The temperature and humidity of the air, as well as the
    soil moisture and solar radiation can be recognized as universal variables measured
    in agricultural applications based on selected studies. Similarly, actuators such
    as valves, pumps, motors, sprinklers, humidifiers, and lamps were widely used
    in irrigation, fertilization, pesticide management, and illumination control.
    It was also observed that new energy sources and Cloud storage have not been widely
    adopted, showing that there are opportunities for research and development in
    these areas. Studies included in this paper provide a compact view of solutions
    proposed for agro-industrial and environmental problems during the last decade.
    It was found that most of them relied heavily on heterogeneous components and
    wireless sensor networks. However, it seems reasonable to assume that future solutions
    will need to fully embrace Cloud services and new ways of connectivity in order
    to get the benefits of a truly connected and smart IoT ecosystem. Acknowledgements

  explanation: 'The purpose of building a regional ET network is to increase the amount
    of accurate ET data that is available for regions. This data can then be used
    to optimize water use in irrigation practices and crop development.


    The CORDOVA-ET device is an inexpensive weather station that utilizes a wireless
    communication protocol and data-handling algorithms to transmit real-time ET data.
    The remote nature of the device was intentional and is meant to allow the collection
    of crop ET data, in addition to the standard ETo data that is available from localized
    weather.'

    \ (A.C.-L.)\nAbstract: Determining evapotranspiration (ET) is essential for water\
    \ accounting and for the manage-\nment of irrigated agriculture from farm to region.\
    \ We describe here a collaborative initiative aimed at\nestablishing a prototype\
    \ ET network in six countries of North Africa and the Near East (NENA region).\n\
    The network utilizes a low-cost and open-source system, termed the CORDOVA-ET,\
    \ consisting of a base\nstation and sensing nodes to collect the weather data\
    \ needed to determine the reference and actual ET\n(ETo and ETa). Here, we describe\
    \ the network-deployment processes, system architecture, data-collection\nmethodology,\
    \ quality-control procedures, and some of the ET results obtained so far during\
    \ a four-year\nperiod, starting in 2018. The network has been developed as an\
    \ iterative and collaborative process, where\ntraining and capacity building have\
    \ been the main drivers. The feedback and experiences gathered\nfrom the users\
    \ have helped improve the different versions of the prototypes and enhance their\
    \ assembly,\ndeployment, reliability, and ease of operation. At the same time,\
    \ the involvement in the construction,\nmaintenance, and data analysis has also\
    \ provided valuable insight into calculating ET from energy-\nbalance methods.\
    \ The network operated during six cropping seasons and the results were mixed,\
    \ while\ndata integrity (hourly and daily) varied from 95 to 23% depending on\
    \ the country and season. Validation\nof the ET estimates was performed using\
    \ the ECMWF ERA5 dataset as an independent reference. The\nenergy-balance algorithm\
    \ implemented in the system to determine the ETa was validated using the\nOpenCropLib\
    \ Python library. While the results of the data validation demonstrated the reliability\
    \ and\naccuracy of the CORDOVA-ET system, network operations required significant\
    \ support and special\nmotivation on the part of the users. It is concluded that\
    \ collaboration among users, together with the\nsupport services and participation\
    \ of different stakeholders interested in agricultural water management,\nwould\
    \ be essential elements to ensure the sustainability of the ET network.\nKeywords:\

    Agronomy 2023, 13, 2756\n2 of 28\n1. Introduction\nGiven the current situation\
    \ of rising temperatures and the changes in precipitation pat-\nterns inﬂuenced\
    \ by climate change together with the occurrence of more intense droughts,\nthe\
    \ optimization of water use is becoming a central issue, particularly in countries\
    \ with\nchronic water scarcity. Regarding agricultural water resource usage, the\
    \ focus should be on\nobtaining the maximum yield with the minimum amount of water\
    \ via optimal irrigation\npractices. Knowledge of crop water consumption or evapotranspiration\
    \ (ET) is essential to\ndetermine the adequate amount and frequency of irrigation\
    \ water applications. The two ET\ncomponents, evaporation from soil and crop transpiration,\
    \ which are difﬁcult to separate in\npractice, constitute the crop water requirements\
    \ and, after deducting the effective rainfall,\nthe net irrigation needs.\nThe\
    \ California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS) in the USA, for\n\
    instance, is a network of over 145 automated weather stations in California that\
    \ began in\n1982 [1]. These stations collect agrometeorological variables to provide\
    \ reference evapo-\ntranspiration information for different regions [2]. The data\
    \ are free and available online to\nfarmers, water managers, and the public. CIMIS\
    \ network is extensively used in Califor-\nnia for irrigation scheduling, water\
    \ management, and weather forecasting [3]. Similarly,\nthe “Red de Información\
    \ Agroclimática de Andalucía” (RIAA) [4] in Andalusia, Spain,\noperational since\
    \ 1999, has about one hundred automatic weather stations distributed\nthroughout\
    \ all irrigable areas, that offer essential meteorological data and ETo information,\n\
    especially crucial for irrigation scheduling in a drought-prone region [5]. In\
    \ Texas, there\nhave been substantial efforts in utilizing ET data for irrigation\
    \ management, though it has\nfaced challenges in sustaining its ET networks over\
    \ extended periods [6]. These efforts\nemphasize the need for network coordination\
    \ and integration to avoid errors from lack of\nstandardization and varying ET\
    \ computation methods. Moreover, these networks require\nextensive maintenance\
    \ of equipment, data collection, and quality assessment for their\nexpansion to\
    \ other countries and regions.\nTo establish a successful regional ET information\
    \ network, several requisites must be\nmet. Firstly, the network must be able\
    \ to provide accurate ET data that can be effectively used\nby policymakers, water\
    \ managers, and other end-users. Secondly, the network must have a\ncost-effective\
    \ and sustainable operational model. Thirdly, the network must be able to provide\n\
    timely data to potential users and must be properly maintained over the long run.\n\
    The FAO project “Water efﬁciency, productivity and sustainability in the NENA\n\
    regions” (Project GCP/RNE/009/SWE) funded the establishment of a regional ET network\n\
    in countries of the Near East and North Africa region. The project aimed to provide\
    \ experts\nand water users with accurate ET data to enable them to make informed\
    \ decisions about\nwater accounting and water productivity. The deployment of\
    \ the ET network involved\nseveral steps, starting with the development of a novel,\
    \ cost-effective ET measuring device\nwhich is fully described in Jimenez-Berni\
    \ et al. [7]. The next steps included identifying\nsuitable partners and locations,\
    \ station deployment, equipment calibration, adequate team\ntraining, and, ﬁnally,\
    \ collecting, analyzing, and disseminating the ET data.\nIdeally, the network\
    \ should be integrated into the existing water-management informa-\ntion systems\
    \ to provide timely and accurate data to potential users. Regional ET networks\n\
    can provide a platform for collecting and sharing data, identifying best practices,\
    \ and devel-\noping applications to assist in regional water-management strategies.\
    \ The establishment of\nregional networks, however, can be challenging, requiring\
    \ high upfront costs and regular\nmaintenance for their sustainability.\nRegarding\
    \ agrometeorological information, the standard is a weather station with\nresearch-grade\
    \ sensors typically used in scientiﬁc applications, which are costly. An\nalternative,\
    \ tested in this work, is an inexpensive device which uses industrial-grade and\n\
    commercial off-the-shelf sensors. Jimenez-Berni et al. [7] presents the description\
    \ and\ntest of the CORDOVA-ET station, a cost-effective and easy-to-maintain unit\
    \ which has\nAgronomy 2023, 13, 2756\n3 of 28\nbeen used in the ET regional network\
    \ described herein. An important advantage of this\nsystem is that it permits\
    \ collecting crop ET (ETa) data in addition to determining the ETo [7].\nThe objectives\
    \ of this work are to describe the deployment of such stations in different\n\
    countries and institutions of the NENA region, to assess their performance in\
    \ determining\nthe ETa and ETo, to describe the major issues associated with network\
    \ development, and to\nevaluate the suitability of the CORDOVA-ET for use in an\
    \ ET network in the NENA region.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Network Components\n\
    2.1.1. The CORDOVA-ET System\nThe COnductance Recording Device for Observation\
    \ and Validation of EvapoTran-\nspiration (CORDOVA-ET) system [7] is a device\
    \ designed for measuring the actual evapo-\ntranspiration (ETa) using the energy-balance\
    \ approach. The system consists of hardware\ncomponents to measure primary meteorological\
    \ variables, a communication infrastruc-\nture based on wireless protocols, and\
    \ data-handling devices and algorithms to generate\nETa estimates. A standard\
    \ deployment of the CORDOVA-ET consists of four sensing\nnodes, a pyranometer\
    \ node, and a base station. The following is a brief description which\nsummarizes\
    \ the system components:\nThe sensing node consists of various sensors for measuring\
    \ different variables: Air\ntemperature and humidity, canopy temperature, and\
    \ soil temperature. These sensors are\nconnected to a low power operation microcontroller\
    \ that allow network communication\nand programming capabilities. The base station\
    \ includes a commercial weather station and\na gateway that receives nodes data\
    \ and transmits them to the cloud. The pyranometer node\nconsists of a commercial\
    \ pyranometer and a microcontroller that transmits the data the\nsame way as the\
    \ sensing nodes do. The system is solar and battery powered. The system\noperates\
    \ wirelessly using LoRaWAN, a low-power communication protocol. The data\nare\
    \ encrypted and managed by The Things Network (TTN), a LoRaWAN infrastructure.\n\
    They are then retrieved using Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol\
    \ and\nstored in InﬂuxDB, a time-series database. Real-time visualization is achieved\
    \ through\nGrafana, an open-source monitoring tool. All components can be deployed\
    \ on physical\nor cloud servers, utilizing Docker containers for easy replication.\
    \ Table 1 summarizes the\nmain components of the system hardware Full description\
    \ and details can be found in [7].\nThe device was conceived as an open-source\
    \ and hardware alternative to commercial\nequipment, and using a collaborative\
    \ approach that would allow a community of users to\nbuild their own system.\n\
    All the details regarding the CORDOVA-ET device and its ﬁeld validation tests\
    \ can be\nfound in Jimenez-Berni et al. 2023 [7]. This study is focused on the\
    \ data obtained during\nthe six study seasons from 2020 to 2022 in various crops\
    \ in different areas of countries in\nthe NENA region.\n2.1.2. Participant Countries\n\
    Institutions of seven participant countries (Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon,\
    \ Morocco,\nTunisia, and Palestine) of the FAO “Water efﬁciency, productivity\
    \ and sustainability in\nthe NENA region” project joined the development of a\
    \ regional network for the ﬁeld\nmeasurements of evapotranspiration. At least\
    \ two sites were established in each country,\nexcept in the case of Algeria,\
    \ where the efforts to deploy the stations encountered diverse\nproblems, making\
    \ it difﬁcult to correctly operate them. Therefore, we report here the\ndata collection\
    \ in six countries. Table 2 presents the list of locations, institutions, and\
    \ the\nCORDOVA-ET versions deployed.\nThe CORDOVA-ET systems were delivered at\
    \ different times to the participating coun-\ntries. Egypt was the earliest adopter\
    \ of the system. The first version of the prototype was\ndeployed in February\
    \ 2019 in Egypt, while Palestine installed its first station in 2022. The rest\n\
    of the countries deployed their systems between December 2019 and February 2020\
    \ (Table 3).\nOne major reason for the variations of delivery times among countries\
    \ of the different versions\nAgronomy 2023, 13, 2756\n4 of 28\nof the CORDOVA-ET\
    \ was related to the custom requirements, which differed among countries,\nwith\
    \ the consequent delays in the deliveries to the different countries.\nTable 1.\

    \ available ETa data were retrieved for six different cropping seasons,\nstarting\
    \ in December 2019 and ending in December 2022.\nTable 3 summarizes the crops\
    \ and their sowing and harvest dates for every season in\neach country.\n2.1.3.\
    \ Data Collection\nThe data from the different deployments are uploaded to a central\
    \ server in real time\nusing the LoRaWAN infrastructure of The Things Networks.\
    \ The data are stored in a\ndatabase (InﬂuxDB) and available for quick visualization\
    \ using Grafana as the front-end.\nThis is a very dynamic way to visualize the\
    \ real-time data, and identify gaps and issues\n(e.g., faulty sensors). The data\
    \ can be downloaded directly from Grafana or, easier, from a\nweb-based tool called\
    \ “CORDOVA-ET Data Download” (current version: 2.2.0), either from\nthe main menu\
    \ in Grafana or directly accessed from a direct link. In the tool, users have\
    \ the\noption to choose the CORDOVA-ET deployment they want based on factors such\
    \ as the\ncountry, season, and crop. They can specify the start and end dates\
    \ for the deployment,\nand also select the preferred data format from the available\
    \ drop-down menu. A small\ngraph for visualizing the data status presents the\
    \ air temperature from the weather station\nas a quick way to identify potential\
    \ data gaps. When the user presses Download, the data\nare generated in the server\
    \ and prepared for download as an Excel ﬁle. The meaning of\neach of the column\
    \ headers is detailed in Appendix A (Table A2).\nThe application is built using\
    \ Python and leveraging the power of Plotly-Dash,\nhttps://plotly.com/dash/ (accessed\
    \ on 20 October 2023) and the OpenCropLib library [8]\nfor the ET calculations\
    \ using energy balance. At present, the web-based application is\nrunning successfully\
    \ on Heroku, a popular cloud platform. The metadata required for the\napplication\
    \ of the different algorithms (e.g., deployment location, sensor height, calibration\n\
    coefﬁcients for pyranometers) are hosted in GitHub, https://github.com/OpenAgriTech/\n\
    CORDOVA-ET-metadata (accessed on 20 October 2023) and publicly available to ensure\n\
    traceability and repeatability of the data.\nDifferent formats are available for\
    \ download at different timesteps and information\nlevels; for example, raw data\
    \ from weather station and nodes can be downloaded in 10\nand 30 min timesteps.\
    \ Energy-balance calculations of the ETo and ETa can be downloaded\nat 30, 60\
    \ m, and daily. This includes not just the ETa calculated at each node, but also\
    \ the\nAgronomy 2023, 13, 2756\n6 of 28\nintermediate calculations of the energy\
    \ components: sensible heat, aerodynamic resistance,\nnet radiation, and latent\
    \ heat. The application also allows exporting to standard data\nformats, such\
    \ as comma-separated values (CSVs) and Excel.\n2.1.4. Participant Involvement\n\
    For the correct implementation of the CORDOVA-ET station network, close communi-\n\
    cation with the core developers from the Institute for Sustainable Agriculture\
    \ (IAS-CSIC)\nand the Universidad of Cordoba was crucial, named here as the Network\
    \ Development\nTeam (ND team). The ND team oversaw the logistics of the delivery\
    \ of the stations, in-\nspected the correct deployment of the equipment, either\
    \ through ﬁeld missions in the\ndifferent countries or remotely, and carried out\
    \ the data and sensor measurements’ quality\ncontrol. Additionally, there was\
    \ a local expert responsible that belonged to the institution\nto which the station\
    \ was assigned by the FAO, as well as a group of technicians and engi-\nneers\
    \ who participated in the data collection, management, and maintenance. This group\n\
    interacts directly with the person in charge at the country level, since there\
    \ is more than\none station in different institutions in each country; this hierarchy\
    \ in communications was\nestablished to accelerate the speed of response and to\
    \ optimize resources.\n2.2. Methodology for Data Validation\nTo validate the data\
    \ collected by the CORDOVA-ET at the different locations and ﬁeld\nseasons, a\
    \ standard dataset for gridded weather variables was needed in the absence of\n\
    high-quality weather station datasets. We have used the ERA5 from the European\
    \ Centre\nfor Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) for this purpose. The ERA5\
    \ provides a\nrange of meteorological variables, such as temperature, humidity,\
    \ wind speed and direction,\natmospheric pressure, and precipitation, at various\
    \ spatial and temporal resolutions. The\ndata are produced using a combination\
    \ of observations from various sources, such as\nsatellites, ground-based stations,\
    \ aircraft, and a numerical weather-prediction model.\nERA5 is the ﬁfth generation\
    \ of ECMWF’s atmospheric reanalysis dataset, which spans\nthe period from 1979\
    \ to the present. It is widely used for a range of applications, including\nclimate\
    \ research, meteorology, and weather forecasting. The data are available to the\
    \ public\nthrough ECMWF’s data servers and can be accessed using various software\
    \ tools and\nprogramming languages.\nThe validation methodology used here is similar\
    \ to the one followed by other re-\nsearchers who were investigating the feasibility\
    \ of using ERA5 in crop modeling to comple-\nment, or even replace, the observations\
    \ of local weather stations [9–12].\nHourly data for the main weather variables\
    \ (air temperature and humidity at 2 m,\nwind speed at 10 m and solar radiation)\
    \ were downloaded from ERA5 using Python scripts.\nDaily aggregates of the weather\
    \ variables required for the calculation of the ETo using\nFAO56 were downloaded\
    \ using the local time zone for each site.\nThe raw data from the weather station\
    \ and nodes were downloaded from the CORDOVA-ET\nserver and aggregated into hourly\
    \ and daily intervals. The ETo was calculated on an hourly\nbasis, as well as\
    \ daily, following FAO56 and ASCE using the refET library https://github.com/\n\
    WSWUP/RefET (accessed on 20 October 2023). In cases where the height for the weather\
    \ station\nwas not standard (2 m), a correction for the wind speed was performed\
    \ according to FAO56.\nFor each country, the data for each season were calculated\
    \ and plotted showing the\nETo estimates of the CORDOVA-ET and the ETo extracted\
    \ from ERA5 for the coordinates of\neach site. Daily ETa was calculated as described\
    \ in Jimenez-Berni et al. [7], where the sum of\nthe latent heat (LE) was converted\
    \ to mm/day. For cases where daily data were incomplete,\nan estimate of the daily\
    \ ETa was calculated based on the partial observations of hourly\ninstantaneous\
    \ calculations (ETa alt). The algorithm is similar to the approach followed by\n\
    algorithms used with remote sensing, where the observations are instantaneous\
    \ (taken at\nAgronomy 2023, 13, 2756\n7 of 28\nthe time of satellite ﬂights over\
    \ the area). The evaporative fraction, EF, (hourly ETa/ETo) is\nthen extrapolated\
    \ to the rest of the day:\nETaalt = EToEFhourly\nc\n(1)\nwhere ETa and ETo are\
    \ daily estimates, and EF is the average of ETa/ETo values calculated\nfrom the\
    \ hourly data when solar radiation is above 400 W/m2.\n3. Results and Discussion\n\
    3.1. Training, Communication, and Support\n3.1.1. Training and Coaching\nThe initial\
    \ philosophy behind the network was to fully empower all the participants\nwith\
    \ the knowledge required to assemble, deploy, and run the CORDOVA-ET instrument,\n\
    and also to analyze the collected data and maintain the equipment. Therefore,\
    \ users’\ntraining was considered a crucial step in the development of the network.\
    \ It was considered\nimportant to ensure that all users would understand well\
    \ how to assemble, use, and\nmaintain the equipment correctly. Training took many\
    \ forms, such as instructional videos,\nuser manuals, and in-person or online\
    \ training sessions.\nThe ND team trained all personnel from the participant countries\
    \ in the use, assembly,\ndeployment, and maintenance of the CORDOVA-ET system.\
    \ Several in-person workshops\nwere conducted in Cordoba and in the NENA region,\
    \ as well as online. This training\ntargeted technical specialists in the ﬁeld\
    \ of agrometeorology to provide them with the\nknowledge needed to adopt the CORDOVA-ET\
    \ system.\nParticipants received the materials and instruction necessary to assemble\
    \ and operate a\ncomplete CORDOVA-ET system. Upon completion of the program, country\
    \ representatives\ntook ownership of their CORDOVA-ET systems, transporting and\
    \ installing them at the\nagreed-upon sites within their countries. Once operative,\
    \ they were responsible for operation\nand maintenance. Under this framework,\
    \ the training had the following specific objectives:\n1.\nTo give participants\
    \ a deeper understanding of the various ways to determine evapo-\ntranspiration,\
    \ focusing on the calculation method behind the CORDOVA-ET system;\n2.\nTo provide\
    \ an overview of the system components and the manufacturing process,\nfrom procurement\
    \ to assembly;\n3.\nTo review the critical steps in the set-up of the equipment,\
    \ data retrieval, and quality checks;\n4.\nTo develop the autonomy of the participant\
    \ to monitor, update, and maintain the equipment;\n5.\nTo devise the ET measurement\
    \ plans according to the project objectives in each of the\ncountries involved.\n\
    As the system evolved, several online workshops were conducted to provide training\n\
    to the members of the network on the new features and advancements made. These\
    \ work-\nshops served as a platform to educate participants about the latest updates,\
    \ enhancements,\nand improvements which were incorporated into the system over\
    \ time.\nThe combination of in situ training and local problem-solving through\
    \ backstopping\nmissions strengthened the capacity of the participating countries\
    \ to effectively utilize\nand maintain the technology. It also fostered a closer\
    \ relationship between the ND team\nand the local stakeholders, promoting collaboration\
    \ and knowledge exchange. Overall,\nthe backstopping missions played a crucial\
    \ role in ensuring the successful adoption and\nsustainable use of the technology\
    \ within the participating countries.\n3.1.2. Establishing a Support Network\n\
    At the early stages of the network, there were two main ways for communication\n\
    among the users and developers of the ET network:\n•\nBy video conferencing using\
    \ a collaboration platform that uniﬁes chat, voice, video,\nand ﬁle sharing (e.g.,\
    \ Zoom). It is designed to be used by local, remote, and distributed\nwork groups.\
    \ It was mainly used to carry out e-training and webinars;\nAgronomy 2023, 13,\
    \ 2756\n8 of 28\n•\nMultiple chat groups (WhatsApp) were established for the ET\
    \ network participants,\nserving distinct purposes facilitating real-time communication,\
    \ enabling active en-\ngagement, and quick problem-solving for the community.\
    \ Separate chat groups were\ncreated for each speciﬁc country, allowing participants\
    \ to address country-speciﬁc\nconcerns, exchange localized ideas, and address\
    \ unique challenges efﬁciently. The\ndynamic nature of these chat groups promoted\
    \ effective and seamless communication.\nAlthough there were multiple communication\
    \ channels, the community involved in\nthe training courses, the deployment of\
    \ the stations, and data collection and manipulation\ndid not have a single platform\
    \ established where the users could interact among them and\nwith the ND team.\
    \ Therefore, in December 2020, it was proposed to create a web-based\nportal for\
    \ discussion and exchange between CORDOVA-ET users and the ND team to\nfacilitate\
    \ effective online communication, feedback, and collaboration.\nTo enable every\
    \ person working on the CORDOVA-ET system to exchange experiences,\nideas, problems\
    \ found, and possible solutions, the platform was required to meet the\nfollowing\
    \ requisites:\n1.\nAccessible meeting place with a graphical interface;\n2.\n\
    Ease of use;\n3.\nEffective and affordable;\n4.\nPermanent access;\n5.\nLongevity;\n\
    6.\nEasy ﬁle storage and exchange.\nThe best platform that meets the requirements\
    \ listed above is Dgroups. In terms of\nformal organization, the Dgroups Partnership\
    \ is a cofunded project of Bellanet/IDRC,\nﬁnanced by the partners and members,\
    \ comprising a diverse group, including international\nor intergovernmental organizations,\
    \ such as the World Bank, UNAIDS, FAO, CTA; govern-\nment agencies, such as Danida,\
    \ DFID, IDRC, Sida, SDC; national and international NGOs,\nlike ICCO, Hivos, OneWorld,\
    \ KIT, SNV; ICT- and knowledge-focused institutes/projects,\nsuch as IICD and\
    \ Bellanet [13].\nThe Dgroups platform was selected for the following reasons:\n\
    1.\nAll the groups participating in the project were already members of it;\n\
    2.\nThere was already an active community created on Water Productivity and Agriculture\n\
    https://dgroups.org/fao/waterproductivity (accessed on 3 October 2023);\n3.\n\
    There was the possibility to create a subgroup under the Water Productivity group,\
    \ so\nthat the CORDOVA-ET users would have access to all the documentation, not\
    \ only\nrelated to the CORDOVA-ET, but also other topics related to water productivity;\n\
    4.\nThe users did not need to change platforms to organize their knowledge and\
    \ ﬁles;\n5.\nFiles were easily accessible;\n6.\nWhile WhatsApp is fast and easy,\
    \ it is very difﬁcult to have all conversations organized\nand accessible to everyone.\
    \ Dgroups allows you to access the organized conversations\nand ﬁles easily at\
    \ any time.\nThe use of the Dgroups platform did not exclude the use of the WhatsApp\
    \ chat, but\ncomplemented it. However, a forum tends to be asynchronous and visitors\
    \ can catch up the\nconversations at any time reading previous posts. This is\
    \ not viable in WhatsApp, where a\nconversation or topic could be easily missed.\n\
    3.2. CORDOVA-ET System Upgrades\nThese prototypes evolved over time through a\
    \ trial-and-error process based on our\nown experience, and more importantly,\
    \ thanks to the feedback received from the early\nadopters and initial users.\
    \ The expansion and adoption of the system therefore followed a\ncollaborative\
    \ approach.\nSince the original system development, several components have been\
    \ upgraded, as\ndescribed below.\nAgronomy 2023, 13, 2756\n9 of 28\n3.2.1. Sensor\
    \ Upgrades\nThe sensors integrated in the nodes are a fundamental component of\
    \ the CORDOVA-\nET, as they sense the infrared temperature and air temperature\
    \ and humidity required\nfor the calculation of the sensible heat used in the\
    \ energy-balance approach followed to\nestimate the actual evapotranspiration.\
    \ Figure A1 of Appendix A depicts pictures of both\nthe original and the improved\
    \ sensors used in the CORDOVA-ET station. Below is a\ndescription of the issues\
    \ found and the implemented solutions:\n•\nThe initial prototypes of the air-temperature\
    \ sensor used the BME280 (Bosch, Gerlin-\ngen, Germany) sensor, integrated into\
    \ a completely 3D-printed radiation shield and\nsensor holder. The large size\
    \ of the electronic board provides large thermal mass and\nmakes it not really\
    \ suitable for precise applications; therefore, the second prototype,\nbased on\
    \ the SHT35 (Sensirion, Stäfa, Switzerland) manufactured by ClosedCube\n(London,\
    \ UK), was used and integrated into the 3D-printed radiation shield. This\nnew\
    \ sensor provided a thermal design based on the manufacturer’s speciﬁcations and\n\
    included a protective cap to avoid water and dust to enter in the sensor. A newly\n\
    upgraded sensor, also based on the SHT35, was tested (Hunan Rika Electronic Tech\n\
    Co.,Ltd., Changsha, Hunan, China). The new sensor is completely encapsulated and\n\
    isolated from direct water and dust due to a PTFE membrane. Also, this new sensor\n\
    does not require soldering to connect it to the system, as the connector comes\
    \ already\nintegrated according to our speciﬁcations. The sensor comes as a kit\
    \ with a commercial\nradiation shield with a stainless-steel mounting bracket.\
    \ This represents a quantum\nleap from the original 3D-printed sensors;\n•\nThe\
    \ original Canopy Infrared Temperature sensors have undergone a modiﬁcation to\n\
    include connector and preassembled cables, which provide plug-and-play without\n\
    need of any soldering. On the other hand, the 3D-printed enclosure for the canopy-\n\
    temperature sensor remains unchanged; designs and 3D printer ﬁles are available\n\
    in GitHub: https://github.com/OpenAgriTech/CORDOVA-ET-Hardware (accessed\non 20\
    \ October 2023). The removal of soldering steps and the shipment of preprinted\n\
    sensors improved the efﬁciency and ensured the availability of spare parts at\
    \ all times;\n•\nA soil-temperature sensor was also included in the initial prototypes,\
    \ with the goal of\nmeasuring soil temperature for crop simulation purposes and\
    \ potentially calculating\nsoil heat ﬂux. The sensor is relatively simple, uses\
    \ the One-Wire protocol, and has\nnot been problematic. The main issues were due\
    \ to damaged cables by tillage or\nanimals, as well as incorrect assembly. The\
    \ initial version used ﬁeld-replaceable\nconnectors, which required certain experience\
    \ to ensure proper assembly. A plug-and-\nplay solution was provided by substituting\
    \ an unassembled sensor for a soil sensor\nthat had the connector integrated;\n\
    •\nThe initial pyranometer sensor prototypes included a custom design based on\
    \ a multi-\nspectral sensor (AS7262, AMS-Osram, Premstaetten, Austria) and a 3D-printed\
    \ housing.\nThe idea behind using multispectral sensors is that it could help\
    \ to estimate shortwave\nradiation as well as the PAR component. Also, a version\
    \ in the red–NIR region (AS7263)\ncould be potentially used to estimate NDVI and\
    \ other spectral indices when combined\nwith a downward-looking sensor. However,\
    \ because of the importance of solar radiation\nin the energy balance, a new commercial\
    \ pyranometer, SP-110-SS, (Apogee Instruments,\nInc., North Logan, UT, USA) was\
    \ incorporated into the upgraded CORDOVA-ET. It was\ndecided to have only one\
    \ high-quality pyranometer for the whole system to keep down\nthe costs and to\
    \ remove the original pyranometers from the four nodes, assuming that\nradiation\
    \ does not vary within the distances among the nodes. The new pyranometer\nnode\
    \ consists of the pyranometer itself, the data logger based on the original node\
    \ and\nan accurate 18-bit analog-to-digital converter, and a solar panel, as described\
    \ in detail in\nJimenez-Berni et al. [7]. The node provides a rugged circular\
    \ connector for easy connec-\ntion to data loggers and controllers, and it simplifies\
    \ sensor removal and replacement for\nmaintenance and recalibration.\nAgronomy\
    \ 2023, 13, 2756\n10 of 28\n3.2.2. Data Logger\nUsers also found some difﬁculties\
    \ building the initial versions of the data logger.\nTherefore, there has been\
    \ some evolution in this component as well.\n•\nBaseboard. A custom-designed printed\
    \ circuit board (PCB) is used to hold the LoPy4\nmicrocontroller and interface\
    \ the different sensors. The board evolved from using\nthrough-hole components\
    \ to the surface-mount to avoid any soldering. Also, the board\nhas been designed\
    \ to ﬁt the speciﬁc enclosure without the need of any mounting plate.\nAll the\
    \ connections are clearly marked and are aligned with the circular connectors\n\
    for the sensors that are unique for each sensor to avoid confusion. Additionally,\
    \ two\nswitches were incorporated on the baseboard for power and selecting between\
    \ the\ndifferent operating modes: run, ﬁrmware upgrade, or setup. This facilitates\
    \ easy\nmanagement and conﬁguration of the node as needed. Another upgrade requested\n\
    by the users was the possibility of providing ofﬂine data recording to avoid data\
    \ loss\nwhen the LoRaWAN network was ofﬂine. A microSD card slot was added and\
    \ the\nsoftware adapted to provide local storage into comma-separated values (CSV).\
    \ Since\nthe LoPy4 does not have a battery-backed real-time clock (RTC) that allows\
    \ it to hold\nthe time during power cycle or reset, it has a connector for an\
    \ external RTC device.\nThe software was modiﬁed to provide a way to synchronize\
    \ the internal clock and\nRTC with the LoRaWAN server regularly.\n•\nSolar-regulator\
    \ connectors. The original solar regulator required soldering and screw\nterminals\
    \ for the power output and inputs, respectively. The new power supply\ncomponents\
    \ were modiﬁed to make it plug-and-play without any need for soldering.\nThis\
    \ eliminated several issues of damaged cables or solder joints in this component,\n\
    resulting in improved reliability.\n•\nData-logging software. The software that\
    \ reads the sensor data and transmits the\nmeasurements over LoRaWAN has undergone\
    \ several iterations, which can be sum-\nmarized as follows\no\nThe LoRaWAN keys\
    \ are unique for each board and generated from the hardware\naddress of the LoRa\
    \ and SigFox radios. In the initial versions, users generated\nthe LoRaWAN keys\
    \ from The Things Network (TTN) console, which required\nprogramming each node\
    \ individually with the specific keys. This could have led\nto mistakes and duplicated\
    \ keys in different nodes. Now, the software will show\nthe keys in a serial terminal,\
    \ and users can copy these keys when registering the\nnodes in the TTN, avoiding\
    \ potential issues with the key generation;\no\nThe code is unique for all the\
    \ node types (different hardware revisions, normal\nnodes, and pyranometers).\
    \ The user can select the operating mode using the\nserial console or remotely\
    \ using LoRaWAN downlink messages. This prevents\nconﬁguration issues, and nodes\
    \ can be programmed only once;\no\nAn interactive mode is available on the serial\

    \ the LoRaWAN gateway and a 4G modem.\nThe initial solar capacity was insufﬁcient\
    \ and was upgraded from 25 W to 50 W, with larger\npanels or double the number\
    \ of smaller panels. The battery was also upgraded using two\n9 Ah standard batteries\
    \ or one 14 Ah that ﬁt in the standard enclosure.\n•\nGateway and modem improvements.\
    \ The initial version of the base station consisted\nof separated components for\
    \ the LoRaWAN gateway (TTN Indoor Gateway, The Thing\nIndustries, Amsterdam, Netherlands)\
    \ and the 4G modem (RUT 240, Teltonika, Vilnius,\nLithuania). These components\
    \ were rated for indoor use; therefore, they were put in\nan enclosure to provide\
    \ ingress protection. Having only an internal antenna could\nlimit the range of\
    \ the LoRaWAN communications. A second version of the base station\nused a single\
    \ device that included the LoRaWAN module and 4G communications\n(DLOS8, Dragino,\
    \ China) in an outdoor-rated device. This simpliﬁed installation and\nconﬁguration,\
    \ as there is only one device.\n•\nCommercial weather station. The original weather\
    \ station (WH4000 SE, Froggit,\nBrandenburg, Germany) included an interactive\
    \ display that showed the weather\nvariables while providing WiFi data upload\
    \ to a custom server. In a second hardware\niteration, the station was upgraded\
    \ to the model WH3000SE, that used a small WiFi\nreceiver for WiFi transmission,\
    \ reducing the size and power consumption. This\nreceiver supports other instruments\
    \ from Froggit, such as the soil-moisture sensors.\n3.3. Communication Issues\
    \ and Data Integrity\nAn analysis of data completeness was performed by calculating\
    \ the ratio of actual\nobservations over the theoretical number of observations\
    \ for every season, taking into\naccount the duration of each crop cycle.\nThe\
    \ general analysis of data integrity shows a strong variation in performance across\n\
    the different countries (Egypt, eg; Jordan, jo; Lebanon, le; Morocco, ma; Palestine,\
    \ ps;\nTunisia, tn) and seasons (season 1 = 1UTC; season 2 = 2UTC; . . . ). The\
    \ analysis at the daily\nscale (Figure 1), using complete days where the ETo can\
    \ be estimated, shows that Lebanon\nhas almost 100% of data availability for the\
    \ ETo calculation. In this particular case, the gaps\nin the weather data from\
    \ the CORDOVA-ET were ﬁlled with backup data from the weather\nstation deployed\
    \ in the ﬁeld owned by the Lebanese Agricultural Research Institute (LARI),\n\
    providing seamless integration with the data-processing algorithms. In other countries,\n\
    data integrity ranged from 23 to 93% depending on the country and season.\nThe\
    \ hourly data integrity (Figure 2), calculated as the number of hours when the\
    \ ETa\ncan be calculated, shows less completeness, mostly due to problems in the\
    \ communication\nor power issues in the base station. If the base station stops,\
    \ all the communication from\nthe nodes and the weather station stops. Some other\
    \ times, the weather station stopped\ntransmitting data while the nodes still\
    \ transmitted. However, in that case, it was not\npossible to compute the ETa\
    \ because some weather variable collected by the base station\nwas missing.\n\
    Having a completely open-source and ﬂexible system like the CORDOVA-ET also\n\
    allows it to incorporate other data sources, such as local weather station data\
    \ or online\ndatasets, that could be used to ﬁll the gaps in case of any failure.\

    \ locations in Egypt: Zankaloun \nand Sakha. In Zankaloun, it was not possible\
    \ to record data until the second season due \nto the SIM card not working. In\
    \ Sakha, data were recorded from the ﬁrst season, despite \nreceiving the CORDOVA-ET\
    \ system later than in Zankaloun. Both stations had minor data \ngaps in the ﬁrst\
    \ two seasons of 2020, which unfortunately were the only campaigns where \ndata\
    \ for validation were available. This is attributed to the fact that an early\
    \ version of the \nsystem was deployed and suﬀered from the problems mentioned\

    \ by water and dust. These data \ngaps made it impossible to conduct the energy-balance\

    \ were sent, but issues with the com-\nmunication between the weather station\
    \ and the base station resulted in a lack of weather \ndata for these two sites\
    \ in the subsequent growing periods. This was caused by the lack of \na functional\
    \ SIM card, and the lack of adequate maintenance and the proper replacement \n\
    of the faulty sensors. \n \n \nFigure 2. Data integrity analysis of the hourly\

    \ lack of adequate maintenance and the proper\nreplacement of the faulty sensors.\n\
    3.3.2. Jordan\nThe station was installed halfway through the crop cycle in the\
    \ ﬁrst season. Season\n1 worked well with minor gaps until the end of season 2\
    \ (November 2020). To carry out\nmaintenance work, the station was removed after\
    \ harvesting the season 2 crop. In Jan-\nuary 2021, the station was reinstalled\
    \ again for season 3, gathering a very good dataset with\n93% data integrity.\
    \ In season 4, the importance of correctly placing sensors was highlighted,\n\
    as the recorded canopy temperature reached 55 degrees Celsius, which indicates\
    \ that the\nsensors were probably detecting soil rather than plant temperatures.\
    \ When the ground\ncover increased as the crop developed, canopy temperatures\
    \ decreased markedly, being\nsimilar to air temperatures. This suggests that the\
    \ canopy-temperature sensor was oriented\nalong the crop rows in a way that it\
    \ measured the temperature of the soil surface rather\nthan the crop. Consequently,\
    \ the data integrity for calculating the ETo was 88%, while the\nETa could only\
    \ be calculated for 30% of the data due to the canopy temperature errors.\nDuring\
    \ season 5, there was a lack of data from the nodes due to communication failure\n\
    with the base station, reducing the integrity of the hourly ETa data.\n3.3.3.\
    \ Lebanon\nThe CORDOVA-ET system was installed in Tal al Amara (Lebanon) in 2020.\
    \ Its Froggit\nweather station experienced some port blocking issues by the mobile\
    \ phone operator that\nprevented its communication with the server. In this case,\
    \ we have used the data from the\nweather station operated by LARI for comparisons.\
    \ The data were uploaded to the server\nusing custom scripts to make it available\
    \ to the data processing. Due to power failures,\nonly two of the four nodes for\
    \ ETa determination worked properly over the years.\n3.3.4. Morocco\nThe initial\
    \ seasons in Morocco provided very irregular datasets due to continuous\ncommunication\
    \ and power issues in the base station. Moreover, one of the main problems\nfound\
    \ in this deployment was that the sensors were installed below the crop canopy,\
    \ so\nreliable measurements were drastically reduced.\n3.3.5. Tunisia\nDuring\
    \ the ﬁrst season, the nodes for measuring ETa experienced battery issues (except\n\
    for one node), causing intermittent data gaps. The data from season 2 correlated\
    \ very well\nwith a comparative dataset, with some small data gaps. There were\
    \ communication and\nsensor issues that resulted in incomplete datasets and missing\
    \ seasons (from the end of\nseason 3 until midseason 5). There were also some\
    \ known issues with the precipitation\ndata due to a bug in the ﬁrmware of the\
    \ weather station. The daily rainfall values were not\nreset correctly, resulting\
    \ in repeated values, even when there was no precipitation. This was\nﬁxed in\
    \ the ﬁrmware later in season 5. Finally, in the last season, the issues were\
    \ solved,\nand a good dataset was obtained with minor gaps. In addition, a new\
    \ deployment system\nwas added to Tunisia, which has been working correctly since\
    \ the end of June 2022 with\ngood data integrity.\n3.3.6. Palestine\nPalestine\
    \ was the last country that was incorporated to the NENA ET network, so\nthere\
    \ are only two seasons of data. In both cases, there were data gaps due to issues\
    \ with\nthe SIM card and communication issues with the CORDOVA-ET server. In the\
    \ case of\nseason 6, the data were very limited and the observations of the ETo\
    \ and ETa are scarce, as\ndiscussed below.\nAgronomy 2023, 13, 2756\n14 of 28\n\
    3.4. Validation of Individual Meteorological Variables and Estimates of ET\nThroughout\
    \ the season and across different countries, the primary weather variables, as\n\
    well as the calculations of reference evapotranspiration, were compared with the\
    \ ERA5 data.\nBy conducting these comparisons, we aimed to validate the reliability\
    \ and robustness of the\nET calculations, further enhancing the integrity and\
    \ confidence in the dataset obtained.\nThis comparison involved a comprehensive\
    \ analysis of ETa values, ensuring a thor-\nough evaluation of the accuracy and\
    \ consistency of the estimated evapotranspiration values\nin relation to the reference\
    \ data provided by ERA5.\n3.4.1. Primary Weather Variables\nComparing the data\
    \ of a new device is of utmost importance to assess its reliability and\naccuracy.\
    \ When introducing a novel device into a system or study, it is essential to evaluate\n\
    its performance against established standards or reference devices. This comparative\n\
    analysis allows for the identiﬁcation of potential discrepancies, biases, or limitations\
    \ in\nthe new device’s measurements. By comparing data, researchers and practitioners\
    \ can\ndetermine the device’s level of accuracy and reliability, enabling informed\
    \ decision-making\nand ensuring the validity of subsequent analyses and interpretations.\
    \ Furthermore, this\nprocess helps establish conﬁdence in the new device’s capabilities\
    \ and builds trust in\nthe collected data. It enables users to identify any potential\
    \ variations or deviations\nfrom expected results and implement appropriate adjustments\
    \ or calibrations as needed.\nUltimately, the act of comparing data from a new\
    \ device is crucial for ensuring data quality,\nfacilitating meaningful comparisons,\
    \ and enhancing the overall robustness of scientiﬁc and\ntechnical investigations.\n\
    The comparison of the data obtained from the variables of the CORDOVA-ET with\n\
    ERA5 reveals crucial information about the studied meteorological variables. These\
    \ results\nprovide a statistical understanding of the analyzed variables (Table\
    \ 4) and their relationship\nwith the predictors used in the study. Detailed analysis\
    \ for each variable is available in\nAppendix A (Figures A2–A5).\nTable 4. Validation\

    poorer performance, with an R2 of 0.77 and a slope of 0.87. The large dispersion\
    \ observed\nin the dataset shows very different behaviors across the different\
    \ sites, which suggests local\neffects that may be missed by the ERA5 (Figure\

    Over more than two years of operation, multiple issues related to operation and\n\
    maintenance were identiﬁed, all resulting in improvements in the different iterations\
    \ of the\nprototypes supplied to the countries.\n3.5.1. Power Consumption\nPower\
    \ issues affecting the base station were the primary cause of communication\n\
    issues and data gaps. The initial power requirements were underestimated and limited\
    \ by\nAgronomy 2023, 13, 2756\n19 of 28\nshipping logistics. It worked well during\
    \ the summer months, but the solar power and\nenergy storage were limited during\
    \ the winter months or following several cloudy days.\nAfter testing, it became\
    \ clear that 50 W solar panels are a minimum requirement for the\nstable operation\
    \ of all the components of the base station. In some countries, they are using\n\
    main power, which is a great option, if available.\nIn addition, short circuits\
    \ and excessive power consumption could be due to corrosion\nand water intrusion.\
    \ The canopy-temperature sensors have occasionally experienced these\nissues as\
    \ well. Corrosion and water ingress have led to sensor malfunctions, along with\
    \ short\ncircuits and excessive power consumption. The early version of the air-temperature\
    \ sensor\nproved to have serious problems with corrosion due to the lack of enclosure\
    \ thickness and\nthe electronic components of the original board (BME280, Adafruit,\
    \ New York, NY, USA).\nTo solve these problems, for countries that already had\
    \ old-version stations installed,\nextra 25 W solar panels were provided to connect\
    \ them in parallel. The dimensions of the\nsolar panel and batteries were increased.\
    \ Also, new hardware for the gateway and modem\nwere selected to integrate in\
    \ a single device the 4G modem and the LoRaWAN gateway,\nresulting in more efﬁcient\
    \ power usage.\n3.5.2. Device Assembly and Programming\nDuring the assembly process,\
    \ which required certain experience to ensure proper\nassembly, a variety of issues\
    \ were faced, including:\n•\nCables on the screw terminals breaking down and bad\
    \ soldering. This damage was\ncaused by inappropriate and incorrect assembly;\n\
    •\nDespite the attempts to apply conformal coating to the exposed electronics,\
    \ the early\nversion of the air-temperature and solar-radiation sensors still\
    \ showed poor endurance\nunder extreme climatic conditions;\n•\nLimited spare-parts\
    \ production capacity for 3D-printed parts.\nThese problems arose during deployments\
    \ and were addressed by providing an\nintegrated set, assuring quality, optimizing\
    \ the accuracy and reliability of measurements,\nand increasing the degree of\
    \ sealing to improve protection against harsh conditions.\nAdditionally, nodes\
    \ were also improved in each iteration, and there was no solder\ninvolved in the\
    \ newer version or the 3D-printed parts, resulting in more reliable hardware.\n\
    The last sensor upgrades enhanced the approach, ensuring a faster and more efﬁcient\n\
    installation of sensors, enabling swift deployment in various environments.\n\
    3.5.3. Maintenance\nExcess dirt (spider nets, bird droppings, dust, and mud) on\
    \ sensors distorted the\nmeasurements. This was especially critical for the pyranometer\
    \ and canopy-temperature\nsensors and solar panels. The lack of maintenance of\
    \ the solar panels resulted in the gradual\nloss of battery capacity, resulting\
    \ in battery degradation.\nA monthly check, or even weekly in extreme conditions,\
    \ of the infrared thermometer,\nand a cleaning of the solar panels and the pyranometer,\
    \ is required. Every six months, or\nmonthly in extreme conditions, the tightness\
    \ of the boxes should be checked and the air-\ntemperature sensor and the infrared\
    \ sensor cleaned. Finally, annually, it is recommended to\ncheck the status of\
    \ all the batteries that make up the station. A checklist with the task and\n\
    frequency was written and can be consulted for more detail in the annex of Appendix\
    \ A\n(Table A1).\n3.5.4. Data Management\nThe initial web-based interface provided\
    \ real-time data visualization, basic analysis\ncapabilities, and a way to download\
    \ data directly from the graphs. However, it was clear\nfrom the initial feedback\
    \ that it was not very practical, and downloading data from different\nsensors\
    \ required several download actions and the merging the data. The alternative\
    \ of\nusing Python code was not very practical for many users without programming\
    \ experience,\nor in cases where one wants to quickly download the data for analysis.\n\
    Agronomy 2023, 13, 2756\n20 of 28\nTherefore, based on the feedback received,\
    \ a simplified solution for downloading the\ndata easily in flexible formats was\
    \ developed. This web-based tool, called “CORDOVA-ET\nData Download”, can be accessed\
    \ from the main menu in the web-based application. It\nbundles up all the calculations\
    \ for ETo, ETa, and data aggregation for the raw measurements.\n3.5.5. Solar-Radiation\
    \ Measurement\nMeasurements of solar radiation. This variable is critical for\
    \ the energy balance.\nHowever, this has been the most challenging sensor of the\
    \ whole system. The hardware\nissues with the selected sensor have prevented any\
    \ useful measurement of radiation on\nthe nodes. Moreover, having the pyranometer\
    \ on top of the air-temperature radiation\nshield makes its leveled installation\
    \ and routine maintenance (cleaning for dust) almost\nimpossible. The concept\
    \ of self-contained nodes with all the measurements included is\nattractive, but\
    \ in this case, it did not prove to be practical. Also, the radiation should not\
    \ be\nvariable across the standard extension of the trial and range of the base\
    \ station (~2 km).\nThe CORDOVA-ET v.3 only includes one pyranometer per base\
    \ station, installed at a\npractical height to allow maintenance and correct leveling.\
    \ The single sensor would also\nallow for using a higher-grade instrument that\
    \ would ensure standard and robust factory\ncalibration into energy units, described\
    \ in Berni et al. [7].\nIn addition, the solar radiation from the commercial weather\
    \ stations was affected\nby the fact that the radiation sensor sees through a\
    \ clear glass instead of using a cosine\ndiffuser, as discussed in Jimenez-Berni\
    \ et al. (2023) [7]. An optical diffuser was installed,\nand weather station sensors\
    \ were calibrated against a standard pyranometer. The calibration\ncoefficients\
    \ are stored in a CSV file that can be accessed by the data-processing scripts\n\
    https://github.com/OpenAgriTech/CORDOVA-ET-metadata (accessed on 16 October 2023).\n\
    3.5.6. Communications\nThe main problems faced were with the 4G modem/LoRaWAN\
    \ gateway, due to\nexpired credit in SIM cards or mobile carrier ﬁrewall issues,\
    \ and communication issues in\nthe server side due to power loss, ﬁrewall, and\
    \ internet connectivity problems.\nThe new version of the data logger baseboard\
    \ allows local data storage in the nodes for\nback-up and data retrieval, even\
    \ in the case of no LoRaWAN connectivity. Also, the newer\nmodel of the gateway\
    \ allows local storage of the LoRa packages for offline data processing.\nProgramming\
    \ problems and conﬁguration of gateway and modem was reduced by\nusing a single\
    \ device, the 4G modem, which integrates the gateway and modem; this\nmeans fewer\
    \ parts prone to errors or the wrong conﬁguration, and more space inside\nthe\
    \ baseboard enclosure. This simpliﬁes installation and conﬁguration, as there\
    \ is only\none device. Also, this reduces power consumption and the space inside\
    \ the base station\nenclosure, providing extra space for batteries.\n3.5.7. Other\
    \ Issues\nSeveral challenges have been encountered due to the idiosyncrasies of\
    \ each team\nand the institutions operating in the different countries in which\
    \ the CORDOVA-ET sta-\ntion was deployed. Among the difﬁculties, it is worth mentioning\
    \ the limitations for the\nassembly and/or updating of the devices in some locations,\
    \ despite providing all the neces-\nsary information, offering technical support,\
    \ and sending the required elements properly\npackaged. This omission appears\
    \ to have been caused by the insufﬁcient commitment of\nsome recipients, possibly\
    \ inﬂuenced by a lack of alignment with the goals of both parties.\nConsequently,\
    \ it resulted in the slowing down of the progress and development of the\nCORDOVA-ET\
    \ device deployment.\n3.5.8. Upgrades Discussion\nThe primary function of ET networks\
    \ is to produce ET information for various users\nover the long-term. A recurring\
    \ concern in projects developed through external funding is\nthe uncertainty in\
    \ the continuity once the funding ends. Additionally, ET networks still\nAgronomy\
    \ 2023, 13, 2756\n21 of 28\nhave a major R&D component, which is not normally\
    \ addressed in most public institutions\ndevoted to agricultural water management,\
    \ such as the ministries of agriculture and of\nwater and irrigation. It would\
    \ seem that academic institutions should be the preferred\nrecipients of the prototype\
    \ network described here, but the long-term funding concerns\nmay be even higher\
    \ in that case. This risk poses a serious threat to the sustainability and\ncontinuity\
    \ of an ET network. As the end of the funding approaches, there is a need to\n\
    establish appropriate strategies to ensure the preservation and long-term utilization\
    \ of the\nnetwork. This entails not only the consolidation of acquired knowledge\
    \ and best practices,\nbut also the transfer of responsibilities and the pursuit\
    \ of sustainable ﬁnancing mechanisms.\nA clear example took place in Egypt during\
    \ the national WEPS-NENA workshop in\nSeptember 2022, where the upgraded device\
    \ was exhibited. This event saw the participation\nof renowned institutions in\
    \ the country [14]. Additionally, in Tunisia, pilot projects have\nbeen initiated\
    \ to measure the ETa with the CORDOVA-ET system in two important tree\ncrops,\
    \ namely olive and date palm.\n4. Conclusions\nRegarding the CORDOVA-ET equipment,\
    \ adequate weather protection of its sensors\nand electronics is a critical issue\
    \ under the harsh environmental conditions of the countries\nwhere the system\
    \ was deployed. Many upgrades were made to ensure the robust and\nlong-term operation\
    \ of the system with minimum data gaps.\nThe goals of the CORDOVA-ET were to initiate\
    \ technical personnel in the measure-\nment of ET based on an inexpensive, user-friendly\
    \ instrument that can deliver acceptable\nestimates of the ETo and ETa. Furthermore,\
    \ the aim of the CORDOVA-ET system is to pro-\nvide a cost-effective system (less\
    \ than EUR 4000) that can be adopted beyond the scientiﬁc\ncommunity and provide\
    \ open-access and real-time information about the ETo and actual\ncrop water status\
    \ to facilitate irrigation scheduling and improve the water productivity of\n\
    the adopting users.\nMost ET networks are focused on providing only the reference\
    \ ET (ETo), but this\nnetwork offered two features that are advantageous and may\
    \ be valuable in agronomy. On\none hand, it provides the actual ET when the system\
    \ is placed over a crop different than\ngrass, in addition to the ETo. On the\
    \ other hand, each station captures the spatial variability\nof the ETa, as four\
    \ nodes are provided to assess some of the components of the ETa in four\ndifferent\
    \ locations, which might be several km apart.\nThe insufﬁcient time devoted to\
    \ network operations by part of the personnel responsi-\nble for the stations\
    \ resulted in inadequate attention to some sensors. To address this issue,\na\
    \ sequentially executed script, that consists of a set of instructions and commands\
    \ in the\ndata download process to correct this problem, was implemented. This\
    \ solution has proven\nto be effective in correcting the deﬁciencies caused by\
    \ the lack of attention, ensuring the\nquality and reliability of the data collected\
    \ currently.\nFor supporting the network over the long-term, it is essential to\
    \ establish strategic\nalliances with key stakeholders, such as water authorities,\
    \ academic institutions, research\nand farmers organizations, or other interested\
    \ partners, in order to promote effective\ncontinuity and safeguard the project’s\
    \ outcomes beyond the initial external-funding stage.\nAdditionally, detailed\
    \ documentation of processes, methodologies, and results, along\nwith training\
    \ and capacity-building at the local level, can signiﬁcantly contribute to the\n\
    preservation and successful transfer of the achieved advancements, ensuring a\
    \ lasting\nlegacy and the potential for a continuous impact within the project’s\
    \ sphere of operation.\nDespite the numerous challenges encountered, the overall\
    \ response to the development\nof the ET network has been extremely positive.\
    \ These results highlight the potential and\nimpact that technology can have on\
    \ agriculture, particularly in the measurement and\noptimization of water usage\
    \ in speciﬁc crops. The commitment and collaboration of local\ninstitutions and\
    \ experts are crucial elements in ensuring the ongoing success of these type\n\
    of projects and their potential expansion to other regions in the future.\nAgronomy\

    Sensor installation on water infrastructure is challenging due to requirements
    for service interruption, specialized personnel, regulations and reliability as
    well as the resultant high costs. Here, a minimally invasive installation method
    is introduced based on hot-tapping and immersion of a sensor probe. A modular
    architecture is developed that enables the use of interchangeable multisensor
    probes, nonspecialist installation and servicing, low-power operation and configurable
    sensing and connectivity. A prototype implementation with a temperature, pressure,
    conductivity and flow multisensor probe is presented and tested on an evaluation
    rig. This article demonstrates simple installation, reliable and accurate sensing
    capability as well as remote data acquisition. The demonstrated minimally invasive
    multisensor probes provide an opportunity for the deployment of water quality
    sensors that typically require immersion, such as pH and spectroscopic composition
    analysis. This design allows dynamic deployment on existing water infrastructure
    with expandable sensing capability and minimal interruption, which can be key
    to addressing important sensing parameters, such as optimal sensor network density
    and topology. Published in: IEEE Internet of Things Journal ( Volume: 9, Issue:

    of monitoring water infrastructure is to facilitate a safe, sustainable, reliable
    and cost-effective service. Water distribution wireless sensor networks typically
    employ sensors measuring various quantities, including level, temperature, pressure,
    flow, turbidity, pH, chlorine concentration, as well as other chemical properties
    [1]–[3]. They provide low-level knowledge, such as availability, usage, leakage,
    backflow events, quality, and contamination. This information can be transformed
    into higher level knowledge, such as reservoir availability, environmental impact,
    network utility, condition of network infrastructure, distribution performance,
    reliability, sustainability, safety and security, and quality of service. Such
    system knowledge can underpin services, including network surveillance and active
    management, operational optimization, economic forecasting, asset and risk management,
    scheduled maintenance, and service billing, and may be extended to irrigation
    scheduling in precision agriculture and management of decentralized systems like
    gray water reuse networks [4]. A schematic overview of this hierarchy for water
    sensing technology is shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1. From sensor to service: a hierarchical
    overview of water sensing technology. Show All Wireless sensing technologies have
    been rapidly advancing in the last decade, offering multiple sensors, powerful
    data processing and fast remote communication capabilities to water networks.
    In addition, abstractive data analysis software enables new opportunities for
    node and network level intelligence. At a sensor node level, various integrated
    water quality systems have emerged recently. For example, in [5], a single-substrate
    pH, chlorine and temperature electrochemical multisensor is demonstrated as an
    in-situ analysis system, in integration with a commercial microcontroller and
    communication platform or a field programmable gate array (FPGA) microchip [6].
    An ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometry analyzer has also been developed for
    chemical oxygen demand and ammonia-nitrogen determinations [7]. Unresolved challenges
    in the state-of-the-art solutions of this type include efficient energy provision
    and management at the sensor node level, and installation requirements which are
    often not compatible with existing water distribution infrastructure. This challenge
    is especially important because existing, predominantly old infrastructure is
    more prone to leakage, quality issues and malfunction and is therefore a priority
    for monitoring. Typically, commercial water monitoring systems require the insertion
    of a separate pipe assembly containing the measurement devices into the pipeline
    [8]–[10]. This necessitates major interruptive installation works, involving valve-to-valve
    underground access, specialized personnel, and the installation of pipe assemblies
    with different materials and technologies. These are key limiting factors for
    the large-scale deployment of sensor networks in water infrastructure. Noninvasive,
    acoustic technologies for pipeline corrosion monitoring have been used successfully,
    mainly as portable diagnostic tools, and such methods for sensing other quantities,
    including liquid flow, have been commercialized in recent years [11], [12]. However,
    these acoustic methods still face a number of challenges around their installation
    and operation. On the other hand, water quality metrics, such as pH, conductivity,
    and spectroscopic analysis require direct contact with the water sample of interest.
    In this article, a minimally invasive method for installing sensor nodes on existing
    water distribution infrastructure is presented. It is based on a small-scale hot-tapping
    method and the insertion of a small diameter sensing probe with a multisensing
    head. A prototype system has been developed, including a tapping and sealing mechanical
    design adaptable to pipe diameters in the 25–300-mm range with interchangeable
    multisensor probes, integrated with data acquisition, processing, transmission
    and cloud reception capabilities. Device tests demonstrate successful installation
    and acquisition of calibrated data with adequate accuracy for water temperature,
    flow, pressure and conductivity, as well as for external temperature, pressure
    and vibration sensing. Some of the ideas and findings reported in this article
    are being protected. This article is organized as follows. The minimally invasive
    hot-tapping method is introduced in Section II. The design and fabrication of
    the mechanical and electronic components of the prototype sensor system are presented
    in Sections III and IV, respectively. A water flow test rig developed and used
    as an evaluation setup is presented in Section V. In Section VI, experimental
    sensor test results are presented and discussed. This article concludes in Sections
    VII and VIII by discussing the benefits and opportunities arising from minimally
    invasive multisensors for water networks. SECTION II. Minimally Invasive Multisensor
    A. Sensor Overview Our aim in this work was to demonstrate a compact and rapidly
    deployable multiparameter wireless sensor node that could monitor at least three
    of the following quantities at a single location within the water distribution
    network: pressure, temperature, flow, conductivity, pH and turbidity. The inclusion
    of conductivity, pH and turbidity in this list precluded an entirely noninvasive
    approach, and consequently the device reported here is invasive, requiring a small
    access hole in the pipe wall. However, by exploiting state-of-the-art sensor technology
    we have been able to limit the diameter of this access hole to just 6.3 mm. At
    this size the hole has negligible effect on the mechanical integrity of the pipe,
    and as such we describe the sensor as minimally invasive. Fig. 2 shows a sketch
    of a prototype sensor node mounted on a DN 100 (114.8-mm diameter) pipe. At the
    core of the device is a 6.0-mm diameter sensor probe which protrudes into the
    flow and carries the sensing elements, in this case a combined pressure/temperature
    sensor, a conductivity sensor and a differential pressure sensor which is used
    to measure the flow speed. The probe passes through an isolation valve which allows
    the access hole to be closed off during installation and replacement of the probe.
    A commercial ball valve has been used in the prototype; however, in future we
    expect to replace this by a customized gate valve as this will allow a reduction
    in the overall size of the sensor node. The isolation valve is mounted on a baseplate
    which interfaces to the pipe via a saddle flange. The isolation valve and baseplate
    together are referred to as the sensor port. Fig. 2. Minimally invasive sensor
    node comprising saddle flange, sensor port (isolation valve on baseplate), probe
    adaptor, sensor probe, electronics module, and battery. Show All The sensor outputs
    are fed to an electronics module which consists of a sensor-specific frontend
    submodule and a generic main submodule. The frontend submodule contains the sensor
    readout circuits and a low-power microcontroller unit (MCU) for managing the sensors
    and digitizing the sensor readings. The main submodule contains a wireless MCU
    with Bluetooth capability, a narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) MCU, an secure digital (SD)
    card for data logging and additional environmental sensors for temperature, humidity
    and acceleration/vibration. Communication between the submodules is via a 2-wire
    serial link. Power for the sensors and electronics is provided by a 4800-mAh lithium-polymer
    battery. The sensor node is enclosed in a stainless-steel housing which is sealed
    to IP68. An SMA connector in the housing wall allows a whip antenna to be mounted
    directly on the device; alternatively, a cable can be run to a remote antenna,
    for example when the sensor node is deployed underground. The housing is 75-mm
    long (axial direction) and 50-mm wide, and the height from the bottom of the baseplate
    is 95 mm. The complete sensor node installed on a sensor test rig is shown in
    Fig. 3. The multisensor probe is shown in the inset. Fig. 3. Picture of the complete
    enclosed system as installed on a water flow test rig. A picture of the multisensor
    probe is shown in the inset. Show All B. Sensor Installation A key requirement
    for the minimally invasive sensor node was that it should be possible to install
    the device by hot tapping, i.e., without interrupting the flow of water in the
    pipe. A custom hot-tapping tool was designed for this purpose. This Section outlines
    the hot-tapping procedure which takes around 30 min for a metal-walled pipe. The
    first step is to mount the saddle flange, securing it to the pipe with steel straps
    and/or adhesive. A water-tight seal is formed between the flange and the pipe
    wall either by an O-ring or a gasket. The sensor port is then mounted on the saddle
    flange, and hot-tapping is carried out as outlined in Fig. 4. The hot-tapping
    tool consists essentially of a drive shaft that sits between a standard electric
    drill and the drill bit. The drive shaft moves inside a cylinder which acts as
    a drill guide and also forms a seal that prevents escape of the water that leaks
    from the pipe once the pipe wall has been breached. The drive shaft is hollow,
    allowing cutting fluid to be fed to the drilling zone if a suitable “oil-feed”
    drill bit with coolant channels is deployed. Fig. 4. Hot tapping procedure showing:
    (a) initial drilling phase with through-tool delivery of cutting fluid; (b) end
    of second drilling phase, with flushing of valve bore by process water; (c) after
    withdrawal of cutter and closure of isolation valve; and (d) after removal of
    hot-tapping tool. Show All The hot-tapping tool is screwed into the valve port,
    and the valve is opened to allow access to the pipe wall. Drilling then proceeds
    with a suitable water-based cutting fluid being applied through the drill bit.
    As in any machining operation, the cutting fluid provides cooling and lubrication,
    and also carries swarf away from the drilling zone. The cutting fluid is replaced
    by water before the pipe wall is breached, and once drilling is complete the water
    leaking from the pipe is used to flush the valve [Fig. 4(b)]. To complete the
    process the drill is withdrawn, the valve is closed [Fig. 4(c)] and the tool is
    removed from the valve port [Fig. 4(d)]. To complete the sensor node installation,
    the sensor probe is inserted (see Section III), the electronics module and battery
    are fitted, and a basic functional test is carried out. Finally, the housing is
    screwed into place. These steps take approximately 10 min, so the overall installation
    time for the sensor node, including hot-tapping, is around 40 min. SECTION III.
    Multisensor Probe Design A. Probe Structure Table I shows the sensor elements
    included in the prototype multisensor probe reported here. The static water pressure
    is monitored by a silicon absolute pressure sensor with piezoresistive readout
    (Merit Sensor type H1T-0170-L2 [13]). This device also incorporates a p-n diode
    for temperature compensation, which is also used to monitor the water temperature.
    The sensor is 2.1×2.1×1.4 mm3 in bare die format, making it small enough to be
    accommodated in the end of the 6 mm-diameter probe tip. TABLE I Sensor Chips in
    Prototype Probe The local flow velocity is measured using the differential pressure
    technique [14]. Here, the flow speed is inferred from the pressure difference
    that naturally arises between points fore and aft on a bluff body (in this case
    the probe tube) placed in the flow. This approach is well known in larger scale
    systems and in this work we have adapted it and demonstrated its efficacy at small
    scale. As it was not possible to source a differential pressure sensor small enough
    to fit within the probe tube, the sensor chip (Analog Microelectronics GmbH type
    AMS 5195-0200-D-B, [15]) is housed in the probe head, and the fore and aft pressures
    at the probe tip are conveyed to the chip via 1.0 mm internal diameter stainless-steel
    capillaries. Currently these capillaries are open and filled with air when the
    probe is installed. The fourth sensor in the prototype probe is a conductivity
    sensor (Innovative Sensor Technology AG type LFS1305, [16]) comprising an array
    of parallel electrodes on a ceramic substrate, accommodated as shown in Fig. 5.
    This device works by making a 4-point measurement where the outer electrodes are
    driven with an AC excitation voltage and the conductivity is estimated from the
    ratio of the excitation current to the voltage measured between the inner electrodes.
    Fig. 5. Minimally invasive sensor probe incorporating pressure, temperature, flow,
    and conductivity sensors. Show All Fig. 5 shows the overall layout of the prototype
    multisensor probe and a cut-away detail of the probe tip showing how the p/T and
    conductivity sensors are positioned and how their electrical connections are routed
    to the probe head. The components in the probe tip are potted in a water-resistant
    epoxy that is expected to allow continuous submersion in cold water for several
    years. B. Probe Installation and Replacement The inclusion of an isolation valve
    on the sensor port makes it possible to “hot-swap” the multisensor probe, i.e.,
    replace it without interrupting the flow in the pipe. Fig. 6 outlines the procedures
    for inserting and removing the probe. Before installing the probe, a probe adaptor
    is screwed into the valve port. This part incorporates a seal that can be tightened
    down onto the probe tube by means of a locking ring. Fig. 6. Procedures for “hot”
    insertion (a) → (b) and extraction (b) → (a) of minimally invasive sensor probe.
    Show All To insert a new probe, the probe is inserted into the adaptor so that
    it stops just short of the isolation valve, as shown in Fig. 6(a). The valve is
    then opened and the probe is inserted into the flow. Finally the locking ring
    is tightened to improve the integrity of the seal [Fig. 6(b)]. To remove the probe
    the above sequence is simply reversed: the seal is loosened, the probe is partially
    withdrawn, and the valve is closed. The probe can then be completely withdrawn
    without any water escaping. The entire hot-swapping process, including disconnection
    and reconnection of the probes, can be completed in several minutes. Ease of replacement
    is an important consideration for probes incorporating chemical sensors as these
    generally have lifetimes measured in months rather than years. SECTION IV. Sensor
    Node Electronics A. Sensor Node Electronics Fig. 7 shows the system diagram of
    the sensor node electronics being divided into two submodules. The frontend module
    consists of readout circuits that connects to the sensor chips in the prototype
    probe via flexible flat cables (FFCs) and flexible printed circuit (FPC) connectors.
    The Texas Instruments CC2650 chip is a low-power MCU employed to support the readout
    circuit for the prototype sensor probe. Fig. 7. System diagram of the sensor node
    electronics, with frontend submodule and main submodule as indicated. Show All
    A DC/DC converter is used to provide 5 V for the pressure and conductivity sensors
    [17]. The outputs of the pressure sensor and the temperature diode are amplified
    using instrumentation amplifiers to take advantage of the full scale of the MCU’s
    ADC channels. The differential pressure sensor only requires 3.3 V as power supply
    so it can be powered up by the GPIO pins of the MCU, and its data is obtained
    using I 2 C . The conductivity sensor requires an AC excitation signal to prevent
    electrolysis so that the concentration of ions in the solution remains constant.
    Therefore, a switching regulator is used to produce ±5 V supply rails and using
    PWM from the MCU, an AC voltage signal of 5 kHz is produced for the sensor. The
    AC signal is fed into an amplifying drive circuit comprising an inverting amplifier
    with switchable gain so that the sensor gives two measurement ranges—0– 100 μS
    /cm and 0–10 mS/cm. The resulting signal is then converted back to DC and read
    by an ADC channel of the MCU. Once the frontend sensor data is obtained, it is
    compiled and sent to the main submodule via UART. The main MCU in the module is
    the nRF52840, a multiprotocol System on Chip (SoC) with Bluetooth low energy (BLE)
    capability [18]. It offers low energy consumption through an adaptive power management
    system, and library support for external SD storage through a serial peripheral
    interface (SPI), which is important for local data storage during offline operation.
    The nRF52840 communicates with a second MCU, the SARA-N2 [19] power-optimized
    NB-IoT module, to provide cellular connectivity and large geographic area coverage.
    Additional environmental sensors (Si7021-A20 [20] and LIS3DH [21]) are also connected
    to the nRF52840 using I 2 C . The environmental sensor details are shown in Table
    II. TABLE II Environmental Sensor Chips Fig. 8 shows a photograph of the frontend
    submodule (left) and the main submodule (right). The main submodule has two boards
    stacked together for confinement within the sensor port housing. The smaller board
    contains the SD card circuit and power-on indicator LED whereas the rest of the
    circuits are implemented on the larger board. Fig. 8. Frontend and main circuit
    boards. From left to right: Back view of the frontend board, front view of the
    frontend board (in compartment), front view of main board (in compartment), and
    back view of main board. Show All B. Connectivity/Acquisition The system comprises
    three communication interfaces. The first interface is a local USB interface.
    It offers initial programming, testing and servicing through the Joint Test Action
    Group (JTAG) interfaces of the MCUs and their respective development boards, using
    a computer and a simple network terminal interface, such as PuTTY [22]. This interface
    also makes the electronic architecture expandable to provide local display and
    external digital connectivity during normal operation. Further to the local communication
    interface available for both submodules, the main board provides a BLE and an
    NB-IoT interface for local and cellular data transfer. The nRF52840 uses Bluetooth
    5 Low Energy, which allows communications at distances over 240 m, which is about
    4 times the range of Bluetooth 4.2 and has a higher bit rate of 2 Mb/s [23]. The
    nRF52840 also communicates with the SARA-N2 to establish Internet connection using
    NB-IoT. NB-IoT is a standards-based low-power wide area network (LPWAN) technology
    that has low-power consumption and wide area coverage [24]. It uses a narrower
    bandwidth compared to LTE-M which allows for better indoor/underground penetration
    [24]. An survey of IoT and upcoming 5G connectivity solutions can be found in
    [25]. C. Power Supply and Energy Management The battery used for the prototype
    is the 3.7 V, 4800 mAh lithium polymer LP735977JH by Jauch Quartz GmbH [26]. A
    discharge test was done to verify the performance of the battery at different
    temperatures, using a 2 W ( 8Ω ) load, which is 67% of the 0.2°C (3 W) load at
    which the nominal capacity is specified. The resulting discharge curves and battery
    capacities calculated by discrete integration are shown in Fig. 9. The battery
    cuts off at around 10–11 h, demonstrating adequate operation as expected by nominal
    specifications, for all temperatures. In the −11°C test, a varying voltage drop
    is observed, which is attributed to a reduction of Li ion mobility in the polymer
    electrolyte. Fig. 9. LP735977JH battery discharge test at different temperatures.
    Show All An additional test at a lower, 0.6 W ( 26Ω ) load was performed, which
    corresponds to the expected maximum system power consumption. The results, shown
    in the inset of Fig. 9 demonstrated a capacity of 20.2 Wh, which is again within
    the nominal battery specification tolerance range. The duration of power autonomy
    offered by the battery depends on system usage. For example, if it is assumed
    that the battery should power the device for at least a year, the average current
    consumption should be lower than 0.55 mA. The MCUs provide various sleep and low-power
    operation modes which can be employed by duty cycling in accordance with a given
    sensing scenario, to obtain the desired balance between power autonomy duration
    and average current consumption, i.e., sensing intensity. Table III shows the
    nominal current consumption for each system component. Significant current is
    consumed by the conductivity sensor circuit and during SARA-N2 transmission, which
    is set at −3 dBm. It is apparent that continuous high sampling rates would result
    in unacceptably high power consumption. Therefore, different sensors and their
    required MCU peripherals need to be duty cycled. For example, sampling the conductivity
    sensors for 2 s every 15 min and the other sensors for 2 s every 5 min yields
    an average current consumption below 0.3 mA. TABLE III Nominal Current Consumption
    of Different Components and Peripherals Duty cycling can also be used in operating
    the internal and wireless communication modules of the system. The main-submodule
    has the option to either use BLE or NB-IoT depending on the application. The nRF52840
    uses a UART to receive data from the frontend module To prevent it from consuming
    a constant 0.6 mA as shown in Table III, the UART can be turned on only for a
    brief period of time, e.g., for 15 s when the frontend board is ready to send
    data. Wireless data transmission can be performed at a very low duty cycle (e.g.,
    0.2% or 180 s per day) to reduce the power used by BLE or NB-IoT. Sensor data
    is stored locally in an external SD card before the bulk of data is transmitted.
    An example duty cycling operation scenario that allows a 1-year power autonomy
    with the selected battery is summarized in Table IV, for the cases of BLE and
    NB-IoT. The data transmission time accounted for NB-IoT is significantly longer
    as it requires time to connect to a supported base station and establish an Internet
    connection, but it may still allow several communication sessions within a 24-h
    period. TABLE IV Current Consumption Table for Frontend and Main Boards. Average
    Supply Voltage = 3.6 V Adding both current consumption for the frontend submodule
    and main submodule gives a resultant current consumption of 0.34 mA (BLE) and
    0.5 mA (NB-IoT) as shown in Table IV. More changes can be made to reduce the current
    consumption further, for example by reducing the sampling rate of the environmental
    sensors, increasing the advertising and connection interval for BLE, or reducing
    the transmission power of the BLE/NB-IoT signal. SECTION V. Evaluation Setup To
    examine the performance of the prototype, we built a flow rig and a static pressure
    test rig to conduct experimental evaluation tests. ISO 5167 [27] states that a
    specific minimum length of upstream and downstream pipe should be installed before
    and after pressure differential devices. Considering the availability and dimension
    of the test facility, a flow rig with 1-inch and 2-inch test sections was built,
    which is shown in Fig. 10. Water is pumped from the water tank using the CRESTPUMP
    AM-50 water pump into the test sections controlled by a Parker AC10 motor controller.
    An ABB FEP611 electromagnetic flow meter was used as the reference volumetric
    flow meter with an accuracy of 0.4%. Fig. 10. Water flow test rig layout. Show
    All The water distribution system commonly uses 4-inch and 6-inch pipes, therefore
    we built another 4-inch static pressure test rig, which is displayed in Fig. 11,
    to evaluate the sealing and the pressure sensor. The reference value of pressure
    was given by WIKA DG-10 pressure gauge with an accuracy of 0.5%, and a pressure
    relief valve was installed for protection in case of excess pressure. The pressure
    range of the static test rig was 0–10 bar. Fig. 11. Static pressure test rig.
    Show All SECTION VI. System Characterization The test rigs described above were
    used to evaluate the performance of the pressure, temperature, conductivity and
    flow sensors in the prototype multisensor node. Pressure sensor testing was carried
    out on the static test rig of Fig. 11. In total 5 runs were launched in the range
    of 0 to 8 bar. The results are shown in Fig. 12. A correlation between sensor
    output and reference pressure value was established according to the data of 4
    runs P=4.2103⋅ V p −1.0863 (1) View Source where P denotes gauge pressure (bar)
    and V p denotes voltage output (V) of the pressure sensor. The fifth test run
    as shown in the inset of Fig. 12 was used to evaluate (1) and the relative errors
    ranged from −0.69% to 0.19%. Fig. 12. Performance of the pressure sensor. Show
    All The temperature sensor was tested in a Spark Holland Mistral temperature control
    device. The temperature accuracy and stability of this device were found to be
    better than 0.1°C. The reference temperature meter was Rotronic HP32/HC2, which
    has a nominal 0.1°C accuracy itself. The temperature was varied from 5 to 50°C
    (see Fig. 13), and a correlation was established (2) between sensor output and
    reference temperature T=−18.8251⋅ V 2 t +138.4403⋅ V t −178.6271 (2) View Source
    where T denotes temperature (°C) and V t denotes voltage output (V) of temperature
    sensor. Equation (2) was applied to predict temperatures of the test run and the
    results are shown inset in Fig. 13. The absolute errors of (2) range from −0.29
    to 0.19 °C. Fig. 13. Performance of the temperature sensor. Show All The assessment
    of the conductivity sensor was performed using sodium chloride solutions with
    different concentrations. Sensor outputs were then compared with the readings
    from a HI-98304 pocket conductivity meter. The resolution and the accuracy of
    the reference meter are 0.01 mS/cm and 2% F.S., respectively. Two sets of tests
    were carried out with different conductivity ranges: 0 to 100 μS /cm and 0 to
    10 mS/cm, by switching the gain of the inverting amplifier in the readout circuit.
    According to the data in Fig. 13, the following fitting equation was established
    for the conductivity sensor: C=2.9888⋅ V c +0.0023. (3) View Source Here, C denotes
    conductivity (mS/cm) and V c denotes the voltage output (V) of the conductivity
    sensor. Fig. 13 shows the accuracy of (3) in predicting conductivities. The relative
    errors range from −2.06% to 0.77%. Another test was done for the conductivity
    sensor with a lower measurement range of 0–100 μS /cm by switching the gain of
    the inverting amplifier in the readout circuit, and the results are shown in Fig.
    14. Fig. 14. Performance of the conductivity sensor. Upper: 0–10 mS/cm. Lower:
    0–100 mS/cm. Show All Flow sensor testing was performed in both the 1-inch and
    2-inch test sections of the flow rig. The water flow was set between 20 L/min
    and 80 L/min by the pump controller. As the reference meter was installed in the
    1-inch test section, the pump motor speed was adopted as reference of the tests
    on the 2-inch section. The test results are plotted in Fig. 15 and the following
    correlations were established by data fitting: 1−inch test: 2−inch test: Q=1.0425⋅
    Δ P − − − − √ +2.0128 ω=0.1664⋅ Δ P − − − − √ +0.2372. View Source Here, Q denotes
    water flow rate (L/min), ΔP is the differential pressure (Pa), and ω is the motor
    speed (krpm). To assess these equations, another two sets of experiment were conducted
    and the relative errors of (4) and (5) were from −3.00% to 4.70%, and −5.05% to
    3.43%, respectively. Fig. 15. Performance of flow sensor. Upper: 1-inch test section.
    Lower: 2-inch test section. Show All It is noted that the sensing translation
    (1)–(4) are presented here with full parametric accuracy (i.e., number of significant
    digits), for consistency with the reported accuracy values. These calibration
    values are programmable and can be adjusted by calibration during installation
    or dynamically during operation in a self-calibration scheme, if adequate feedback
    references are provided. For data transmission using BLE, a laptop was used as
    the central BLE device. A LabVIEW user interface together with a USB BLE dongle
    was used to visualize sensor data; the same set-up could potentially allow more
    user control for sensor sampling rates, battery information, etc. Acquired sensor
    results are available in a Git repository [28]. The nRF52840 – SARA-N2 interface
    functionally was confirmed by AT command communication tests. The NB-IoT connectivity
    was not demonstrated as the corresponding network level service is currently only
    offered in pilot laboratories operating in certain regions, such as the Vodafone
    OpenLab in Newbury, U.K. [29]. SECTION VII. Opportunities The multisensor architecture
    introduced in this article includes a simple and effective electronic design,
    adequate sensing accuracy and repeatability, and a multistage parametric duty-cycling
    protocol for power consumption minimization. It also includes a modular and expandable
    design, with interchangeable sensing probes, adaptation to different pipeline
    diameters and a methodical, hot-tapping installation method. It integrates external
    environment sensors that can provide complementary data and expand the sensing
    services range. Finally, the system demonstrates adequate sealing and state-of-the-art
    Industrial Internet-of-Things connectivity. These features are validated experimentally,
    and they offer a complete sensor node deployment solution. The introduction of
    small scale hot-tapping for sensing in particular, in combination with the modular
    architecture, offers a minimal required installation and configuration expertise,
    minimal disruption, retrofitting capability of a high-end sensing solution. The
    installation solution offered is demonstrated in integration with sensing and
    connectivity operation. It opens the way forward for development and testing of
    a range of highly desirable water monitoring features and capabilities, some of
    which are summarized in the remainder of this Section. Leakage detection continues
    to be a central priority of WSNs in the water supply chain, mainly due to the
    extended scale at which it occurs [30]. Apart from its economic impact, it is
    often discussed as a priority for preserving water as a valuable commodity and
    to ensure sustainable use for the near and long term future, but also for regions
    with limited water access [3]. On the other hand, monitoring and control of quality
    is very diverse and includes chemical analysis as well as the detection of events
    and operational parameters that affect quality, such as turbidity, flow, and backflow
    [2], [31]–[44]. It also includes reservoir stations, such as stormwater retentions
    ponds [45]. In the particular case of contamination, early and localized detection
    [46], [47] is critical to safety, and therefore, the density of sensors, along
    with installation topology strategy, is decisive for the effective application
    of data analysis and detection algorithms and subsequently for control, alarming,
    infiltration and various response methods [48]. The sensor architecture introduced
    in this article is applicable to both leakage and quality monitoring through its
    modular, minimally invasive multisensor node approach. Additional sensors, such
    as pH, turbidity, and particle concentration meters can be added straightforwardly,
    as corresponding commercial components suit the probe immersion approach and fit
    onto the Ø 6 mm probe size used. The density of sensor deployment required in
    a water network is key to achieving a sufficient monitoring service at reasonable
    cost. It is a very important parameter and is closely related to the value and
    use of monitoring data at network level. The water network topology in combination
    with general rules and exceptions about locations and moments of special interest
    is required to identify a suitable number of sensors. This information is not
    readily available and in practice is very difficult to know in advance. Therefore,
    a gradual deployment strategy may often be preferable, in which a sparse initial
    grid is installed initially, and points of interests for more detailed sensing
    are subsequently identified. In this direction, the minimally invasive and portable
    architecture proposed in this article offers the possibility of selectable, configurable,
    multistage or dynamic deployment and activation. Apart from the aforementioned
    direct water leakage and quality benefits, another important case of interest
    for water monitoring, which is also linked to its increasing value as a commodity
    for demographic and climate change reasons, is its monitoring for blocking potential
    security threats, including malicious attacks by deliberate water network contamination.
    Such a threat has been determined as one of the most difficult to address. Therefore,
    the installation of an effective water contamination monitoring system is of strategic
    importance both for counteracting malicious events as well as for discouraging
    threats and increasing the sense of safety and security among the global population.
    Again, adequate sensor density and optimized topology are critical for the efficiency
    of such monitoring systems. In [49], a comparison of different WSN solutions,
    coined the battle of the water sensor networks, was presented, employing common
    figures of merit for the efficiency of 15 different WSN approaches. The security
    of sensors and sensing data is in turn also critical. Data integrity and protection
    from tampering and theft can be enhanced by sensor location tracking and software
    activity logging. Including authenticated security logs in data package network
    traffic could offer a measurable level of confidence for the validity and protection
    of gathered data. Hardware implemented location tracking and authentication could
    offer a significant advantage for infrastructure sensor deployment in this direction,
    especially for sensitive data applications [50]–[52]. Finally, infrastructure
    surveillance also benefits from the deployment of WSNs, including availability,
    utility, optimization of operations, and real-time meters at reservoirs, distribution
    points and consumer locations. Potential advantages that have been identified
    include measurement accuracy, fault and theft detection, remote control, exploitation
    of real-time data for efficient and environmentally friendly consumption, usage
    balancing, and enforcement of restrictions during drought periods. The introduced
    sensor node architecture offers the necessary data to the network for further
    analysis and exploitation. This article describes the performance and measurements
    available for a single multisensor node. The expected benefits to an operator
    are at the higher system level in terms of insights and actionable information
    related to the specific challenges faced (productivity, water quality, network
    performance, pipe burst, etc). The normal approach to instrumenting a network
    will depend on the WSNs specific requirements and areas of focus. Today’s instruments
    typically measure a single measurand; therefore the operator will rarely be able
    to instrument a system to an ideal or desired level. The multisensor design presented
    here can be configured with specific measurands relevant to the challenges faced
    by a WSN and in many cases retrofitted. Using wireless communication, the data
    from an array of multisensor nodes and existing instruments can be aggregated
    and data analytics applied to deliver a system level overview with specific insights
    into a particular challenge. A shift toward overall sensing solutions which consider
    the process at a macrolevel can deliver targeted benefits to operators. SECTION
    VIII. Conclusion Water sensor networks can improve usage efficiency by leakage
    reduction, quality assurance and operations optimization, with important economic,
    life quality and environmental benefits. As the sensor node and network technologies
    have progressed rapidly and reached adequate maturity in the last decade, integration
    and installation methods are becoming key elements to their adoption by the infrastructure
    industry. This is especially important for water quality sensors, which typically
    require immersion. In addition, a quantified estimation of sensing cost and benefit
    is often not straightforward, and important questions on required data scale,
    topography and frequency as well as on data exploitation and value are pending.
    In this article, an integrated multisensor architecture for water infrastructure
    monitoring is presented. A minimally invasive hot-tapping installation method
    is introduced that offers a practical, cost-effective and scalable option for
    immersion sensors. A modular design approach allows interchangeable, serviceable,
    and upgradeable multisensor probes to be developed and used. A prototype offering
    water pipeline pressure, temperature, flow and conductivity sensing, as well as
    complementary external environmental sensing of pressure, temperature, and vibration,
    is presented, in integration with internal storage, processing and wireless communication
    capabilities, including BLE and NB-IoT. Operation at adequate sensing resolution
    is demonstrated, including static pressure tests which also demonstrate a successful
    sealed installation for pressures over 8.5 bar. An overview of opportunities arising
    from the proposed multisensor architecture and installation method reveals that
    a scalable, multistage deployment approach may be beneficial in terms of reduced
    initial investment cost, identification of locations and measurands of priority
    interest, quantification of sensing benefit, and a gradual development according
    to requirements and limitations of water infrastructure. Priorities identified
    by potential technology users include leakage detection, quality, security and
    threat management, data transparency and operational optimization. Overall, the
    system level demonstration of a minimally invasive, modular, multisensor has been
    presented, comprising state-of-the-art sensing, processing and networking subsystems,
    which contributes a key and likely pivotal missing element toward the implementation
    of leakage and quality sensor networks. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords

  explanation: This paper presents a study on the cybersecurity challenges and opportunities
    in precision agriculture, also known as smart farming. The authors designed a
    multi-layer smart farming architecture and identified various security and privacy
    issues in this context, including data security and privacy, authorization and
    trust, authentication and secure communication, compliance and regulations, and
    cyber insurance. They also explored different cyber attack scenarios in smart
    farms, such as data attacks, networking and equipment attacks, supply chain attacks,
    and other relevant attacks.

    losses to farmers, if such information is used by competitors or hostile actors.

    Footnotes Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) and smart computing technologies
    have revolutionized every sphere of 21 st century humans. IoT technologies and
    the data driven services they offer were beyond imagination just a decade ago.
    Now, they surround us and influence a variety of domains such as automobile, smart
    home, healthcare, etc. In particular, the Agriculture and Farming industries have
    also embraced this technological intervention. Smart devices are widely used by
    a range of people from farmers to entrepreneurs. These technologies are used in
    a variety of ways, from finding real-time status of crops and soil moisture content
    to deploying drones to assist with tasks such as applying pesticide spray. However,
    the use of IoT and smart communication technologies introduce a vast exposure
    to cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities in smart farming environments. Such
    cyber attacks have the potential to disrupt the economies of countries that are
    widely dependent on agriculture. In this paper, we present a holistic study on
    security and privacy in a smart farming ecosystem. The paper outlines a multi
    layered architecture relevant to the precision agriculture domain and discusses
    the security and privacy issues in this dynamic and distributed cyber physical
    environment. Further more, the paper elaborates on potential cyber attack scenarios
    and highlights open research challenges and future directions. A Roadmap of Cybersecurity

    I. Introduction and Motivation According to the United Nations (UN), the world
    population is expected to exceed 9 billion people by 2050, growing by almost a
    third of the current population [1], [2]. Such an increase in the population demands
    a boost of almost 70 percent in the food production rate, according to the Food
    and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.1 This rapidly growing population
    also introduces a variety of other problems such as increasing competition and
    exploitation of land, water and other natural resources. These issues present
    an urgent need to reduce the dependence of food system on our environment. Consequently,
    the need for an evolutionary agricultural paradigm to keep up with growing demand
    of food and crop production is necessary to guarantee a sustainable development
    [3]. Smart farming technologies2 and precision agriculture3 [4] are gaining more
    attraction for their potential to fulfill such an increasing demand and meet global
    food supply needs. Smart farming technologies involve integration of technology
    and data driven agriculture applications to increase crop yield and quality of
    food products. There are numerous smart farming use cases [5]–[7] present globally
    indicating the impact of this new paradigm of practicing agriculture. As an example,
    the use of remote sensors placed in the soil for measuring blueberry irrigation
    in Chile has reduced the volume of water used in farming by 70 percent [8]. In
    India, farm data has been used to predict and prevent crop diseases, which reduced
    the risk associated with the failure of crop production [9]. Similar data driven
    approaches have helped fruit farmers in Slovenia effectively fight against pests.4
    Smart farming, however, goes beyond primary production. In fact, it has impacted
    the complete food supply chain, by employing big data analytics to provide useful
    insights about the entire farming process [10] by facilitating real-time operational
    decision making, and revolutionizing existing agriculture business models. Smart
    farming enhances conventional farming practices by introducing on-field smart
    sensors and devices. These sensors and devices work in a synergistic manner to
    provide efficient farming experiences, as well as, an improved crop yield. Although
    beneficial to the productivity of the industry, the use of heterogeneous, internet-connected
    devices has exposed potential cyber attacks and vulnerabilities in the agriculture
    sector. These attacks introduce the ability to remotely control and exploit on-field
    sensors and autonomous vehicles (tractors, aerial vehicles, etc). Potential agricultural
    attacks can create an unsafe and unproductive farming environment. For example,
    exploits that have the ability to destroy an entire field of standing grown crops,
    flood the farmlands, over spray pesticides using smart drones, etc. can cause
    unsafe consumption as well as economic deterioration. Such attacks in a large
    coordinated manner, also referred to as agro-terrorism [11], also have the potential
    of disrupting the economy of an agriculture-dependent nation. A report [12] released
    by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security extensively elaborates various cyber
    threat scenarios in precision agriculture, further emphasizing the need for research
    in this critical domain. The Agriculture industry adds 6.4 percent of the world’s
    economic production with a total of $5,084,800 million.5 Agriculture, food, and
    related industries contributed $1.053 trillion to U.S. gross domestic product
    (GDP) in 2017.6 At the same time, United State’s farms contributed $132.8 billion
    of this sum which is almost 1 percent of GDP. Agriculture contributed 1.2 % to
    the European Union’s (EU) GDP in 2017 whereas EU’s agricultural industry added
    gross value of EUR 188.5 billion in 20177 at a record high. Out of 226 countries,
    nine countries have agriculture sector as the dominant sector in their economy.
    The U.S. food and agriculture system has a total economic impact of $7.06 trillion8
    and one-fourth of the overall jobs in the country are connected to it. Most countries
    globally export agricultural products. As a result, cyber vulnerabilities can
    have a significant impact on global food security. A sophisticated agro-terrorism
    attack on a (large) exporting country like the U.S. could harm the health of millions
    of consumers world-wide. In addition, attacks could reduce confidence on domestic
    consumption and destroy the United State’s status as a trusted food exporter.
    A report released in 2018 by the Council of Economic Advisors,9 “The Cost of Malicious
    Cyber Activity to the U.S. Economy” suggests the agriculture sector as one of
    the 16 critical infrastructure sectors that are important to both the U.S. economy
    and national security for which cyber protection is particularly important. It
    also reported that the agriculture sector experienced 11 cyber incidents in 2016.
    According to the World Health Organization,10 420,000 people die every year from
    food-related illnesses and 600 million people fall ill as a result of food contaminated
    with bacteria, viruses, toxins or chemicals. A cyber attack on the food ecosystem
    targeted at farms, transportation system, or food processing industrial control
    systems (ICSs) may increase these numbers exponentially. Other important industries
    like energy, financial or healthcare have understood the need for resilient infrastructure
    and have hardened their defenses. However, the food and agriculture industry is
    still a low hanging fruit for threat actors. Food Protection and Defense Institute
    (FPDI) at the University of Minnesota has discovered that food industry ICSs may
    be distinctly vulnerable to cyberattacks.11 Food industry operations technology
    personnel, in particular, those responsible for operating and maintaining ICSs,
    are experts trained in food and production safety production and not in cybersecurity.
    This presents a huge gap between employing smart farm technology and securing
    it correctly and persistently. If not continuously monitored, cyber attacks on
    smart agriculture technologies can have grave implications on several stakeholders
    in the ecosystem. These groups include farmers, end consumers, food processing
    industries, agriculture co-operatives, livestock, government agencies and nations
    critically dependent on agriculture. Figure 1, shows an end to end interaction
    among various entities involved in smart farming ecosystem. Physical sensors and
    livestock in the field generate data and receive command operations via user applications.
    These on-farm devices are connected to gateway supported edge nodes, which help
    enable in-farm device communication, filter sensor data and real time agronomy
    analytics. At the same time, data lakes in the cloud hold a large amount of data
    and information including but not limited to, environmental information (e.g.
    soil moisture level and fertility status), monitoring information (e.g. sensors
    and smart machinery status), energy management data, and other sensitive information.
    In terms of security and data privacy, it is needless to say that manipulation
    and leakage of such data, as well as the impairment of physical equipment and
    software systems, can induce serious consequences. FIGURE 1. A model of end-to-end
    interaction between various stakeholders in smart farming. Show All Extensive
    research on secure IoT devices [13]–[15], smart vehicles [16]–[19], drones [20],
    [21], edge cloud [22]–[24], wireless communication [25]–[27] is already available
    and might be extended to the smart farming ecosystem. However, most of the time,
    research is conducted on these technologies without consideration of the environment
    they are used. The dynamic smart farming environment, has unique characteristics
    such as farm equipment, labor sharing, and operational decisions, influenced by
    environmental conditions. Domain specific issues such as like location, user skill
    set, insider threats, generated data, need smart-farming-specific security mechanisms.
    The development of smart farm technologies therefore, demands further research
    before wide adoption in the community. The current state of the art and our review
    (discussed in Section V) on smart farming, demands further research in security
    and privacy aspects of this evolving domain. As the research, on cybersecurity
    for smart farming is in its infancy, our objective in this review is to provide
    a holistic view of cybersecurity developments in smart farming. In this paper,
    we discuss current threats, analyze potential cybersecurity attacks, review the
    existing scattered security research, and summarize open research challenges in
    the smart farming field as illustrated in Figure 2. FIGURE 2. A roadmap of cybersecurity
    research and challenges in smart farming. Show All This paper has the following
    key contributions: It provides an overview of smart farming focused multi-layered
    architecture, highlighting multiple entry points and communication across layers.
    It identifies potential cybersecurity issues in smart farming and illustrates,
    scenario specific cyber attacks, which have been categorized into data, network,
    supply chain, and other common attacks. It presents an extensive evaluation of
    the current cybersecurity research, countermeasures in smart farming, and also
    enlists the focus, contributions and weaknesses of current research works. It
    provides a clear view of the open security research challenges in different areas
    including next generation network security, trustworthy supply chain and compliance,
    adversarial machine learning and AI, and access control, trust and information
    sharing. The remainder of this paper is as follows. Multi-layered architecture
    for smart farming is discussed in Section II. Section III elaborates security
    and privacy issues, whereas Section IV discusses different attacks on the smart
    farming ecosystem including the supply chain side. Existing research and state
    of the art in smart farming security is discussed in Section V. Section VI highlights
    open research challenges and possible approaches to solutions. Finally, Section
    VII draws conclusion to this research paper. SECTION II. Smart Farming Landscape
    & Architecture Figure 3, depicts a multi layer architecture for the smart farming
    ecosystem. The proposed architecture adapts and extends widely discussed IoT and
    Cyber Physical System (CPS) multi-layer architectures [28]–[31]. These architectures
    recognize the use of cloud and edge services, and the infinite capabilities provided
    by them to fully harness the data generated from smart devices at the physical
    layer [32]–[37]. Our smart farming architecture, also reflects different user
    applications which can be envisioned at various layers. It also considers, vast
    amounts of data collected at edge or cloud layers, and highlights the need for
    various multi-cloud or edge-cloud scenarios. Overall the architecture consists
    of four layers: Physical layer, Edge layer, Cloud layer, and Network Communication
    layer. The latter spans across all three previous layers and connect them. FIGURE
    3. Multi layer smart farming architecture. Show All A. Physical Layer The bottom
    layer in the architecture comprises of real physical sensors and gateway devices
    which are spread across agriculture farms or in greenhouse buildings. These devices
    include drones flying in the air, autonomous tractors, sensors embedded in livestock,
    or hub devices installed to provide communication among smart objects or with
    a central cloud. These devices are responsible for data sensing and based on the
    information gathered, help in actuating other devices to realise various smart
    farming use cases. They collect real time information about weather conditions,
    soil moisture level, or cattle’s body temperature, which can be sent to the edge
    or cloud supported intelligent decision making systems to provide recommendations
    and enable automation. For example, data gathered from soil moisture sensing device
    in the field, after getting processed in the edge or cloud, can help in determining
    the amount of water needed at the farm, optimize irrigation schedule and offers
    a convenient experience to the end farmers. B. Edge Layer This layer is near to
    the end-users and end-devices for local real-time computations and decisions.
    It reduces the computation load off the centralized cloud layer and also the network
    load. Edge computing layer consists of multiple edge nodes. Each node represents
    a gateway that include services such as: data capturing, security monitoring and
    detection, prediction and real-time decision support. Data capturing services
    include, data aggregation, filtering, encrypting and encoding of real-time data
    streams. Prediction services usually rely on machine learning models trained on
    the central cloud and deployed on the edge layer. They are used to predict and/or
    categorize certain events related to plant or livestock such as, prediction of
    crop yield, categorization of plants or livestock health, predictions about the
    amount of fertilizer and water needed for a patch of land, so as to maximize yield,
    or estimating soil erosion. Security monitoring and detection mechanisms can be
    deployed for real-time monitoring of anomalous events and classifying these events
    as malicious or benign. This includes services like, anomaly detection and device
    failures prediction. C. Cloud Layer Precision Agriculture (PA) and cloud computing
    paradigms offer advances to enhance PA connectivity. The cloud layer is generally
    virtualized in data centers and communicates with the other layers using the Internet.
    Generally, these cloud layer platforms follow the Platform as a Service (PaaS)
    architecture model where the users can focus on running applications and importing
    their data. The PaaS provider runs and maintains a data broker that collects data
    being pushed in from the edge layer and saves these records in a Distributed File
    System (DFS). This stored data is used by analytic software to mine knowledge.
    This data analytics component computes insights and these are pushed to the end
    user through a client application running on the users’ machine. Popular farm
    equipment manufacturers like, John Deere,12 Farmers Business Network,13 etc. have
    created several cloud based products that help users monitor various sensors and
    vehicles used on a farm. These PaaS systems generally run on popular cloud computing
    platforms like Amazon Web Services,14 Google Cloud,15 etc. The way these farming
    PaaS systems are built using these popular cloud computing platforms also introduce
    various security challenges in smart farming ecosystem. D. Network Communication
    Layer The common theme for most, if not all, current technologies is “connectivity”.
    With a growing need for a boundary-less Internet, the idea of a network of smart
    devices has become a reality. This concept, known as the Internet of Things (IoT),
    allows connected devices to be monitored, controlled, and shared data among each
    other. This data can be analyzed and used by multiple applications. In smart farming,
    as shown in Figure 3, the network layer not only facilitates edge and physical
    layer connectivity, but also provides an interface for them to interact with the
    cloud layer. From exchanging soil temperature through a peer-to-peer sensor communication
    system, to sending farm monitoring data to the cloud data stores through high
    speed mobile networks such as 5G [38], or updating the farmer about corp quality
    via a wireless adhoc topology [39], network layer offers a means of communication
    to bind all other layers. Network layer has two main responsibilities in a smart
    farming system. Firstly, there are diverse set of heterogeneous devices in every
    layers of a smart farming system. The network layer provides a secure and efficient
    network stack where, wire, wireless and mobile sub-networks can communicate in
    a compatible and cross-layer manner. The second responsibility of the layer is
    to preserve connectivity and therefore, increase availability. From bigdata processing
    systems used to analyze collected data to individual sensors that collect information
    from the field, this layer is needed for system-wide cyber communication. Real
    World Smart Farming Use Cases: The proposed smart farming architecture is constructed
    based on multiple literature and real world smart farming use cases. It can be
    viewed as a general smart farming architecture that satisfies most of the use
    cases. However, it should be noted that not all use cases will include all four
    layers as proposed in the architecture. Blackhills Farm in New Zealand, a 400-hectare
    property with over 2000 cattle and 800 sheep, has adopted the use of SCADAfarm16
    system which allows the owners to remotely monitor water and energy consumption,
    location of irrigators, soil moisture measurements and real-time weather information.
    The farm uses Schneider Electrics’s EcoStuxture IoT architecture17 which corresponds
    to our physical layer and sensors. It also utilizes Microsoft Azure18 IoT suite
    with communication provided by the Vodafone New Zealand cellular network which
    corresponds to the cloud and network layer in out framework. Similarly, a 7,000-acre
    farm at Beltsville Area Research Center, was developed by the United States Department
    of Agriculture (USDA) to act as a testbed for smart farming technologies. The
    farm was equipped with a physical layer including sensors, drones and IoT-enabled
    farm equipment for a public-private program called Farmbeats [5]. The farm adopts
    a two-layer hybrid network: a layer based on TV White Spaces [40] technology for
    connectivity over long range which connects the farmer’s home Internet connection
    to IoT base stations on the farm, and a layer based on Wi-Fi technology which
    connects smart sensors to the IoT base stations. Such IoT base stations (gateways)
    are equivalent to the edge cloud layer (Figure 3) in our proposed general architecture.
    Additionally, the data collected at the IoT stations are pushed to the cloud layer
    which employs AI algorithms for data analysis. Another usecase is a revolutionary
    step towards smart crop health monitoring. A group of researchers19 along with
    local farmers are developing a distributed airborne monitoring system to detect
    possible zones of crop damage or nutrient deficiency at a 492-acre farm in in
    North Carolina, United States. In order to accommodate rapidly-growing food demands
    and increase the quality and quantity of agricultural production, it is necessary
    to improve farming management practices and technological developments in agricultural
    fields. Accordingly, unlike traditional crop management methods that use farmers
    or ground vehicles for assessing crop health status, this collaborative smart
    farming project is using autonomous technology to perform aerial monitoring of
    agricultural fields to save time and money, while preventing damage to crops.
    In this project, a group of drones which monitor the field are working in the
    physical layer, as depicted in Figure 3. Drones communicate with each other through
    network layer, using which they also send collected data and images to land processing
    bases (i.e. the edge layer in our proposed architecture) for initial data cleaning
    and pre-processing. Finally, pre-processed data is sent to the cloud layer for
    storing and knowledge extraction functionalities. SECTION III. Security & Privacy
    Issues The adoption of sensor based technologies and cloud supported smart applications
    in agriculture has unleashed opportunities for adversaries to orchestrate cyber
    attacks. Therefore, it is important to first understand major security and privacy
    issues in smart farming domain before discussing specific cyber attacks. In this
    section, we will elaborate these issues in detail followed by attacks in the following
    section. A. Data Security & Privacy In a smart farm, an enormous amount of complex,
    dynamic and spatial data gets generated from many heterogeneous sensors, devices
    and equipment. Leakage of such information either through unauthorized access
    or by an insider can cause potential threats. For example, leakage of agriculture
    anti-jamming devices information can help an attacker bypass these security measures,
    while leakage of soil, crop, and agriculture purchase information can cause severe
    economic losses to farmers, if such information is used by competitors or hostile
    actors. On a larger scale, aggregating important agricultural information on a
    particular country is also a potential threat. As such data security and privacy
    is a very important requirement and one of the primary objectives to ensure the
    reliable operation in a smart farming ecosystem. Data on the Edge: Smart farms
    leverage Internet of Things (IoT), state-of-the-art communications (e.g., 5G),
    and artificial intelligence. Such systems mostly require fast response times,
    than those of a traditional model in which data is transmitted to a centralized
    data center (e.g., cloud) for processing and results are returned to a user. As
    such, the need of edge cloud is on the rise. Although moving data processing and
    analytics to the edge enhances agility and efficiency, to say the least, it also
    imposes huge security risks due to the increased attack surface primarily because
    of the highly diverse use of IoT devices which are usually not built with security
    in mind. This gives attackers an easy entry point to the network since remote
    access to the edge layer, in most cases, is essential. Additionally, finding the
    IP addresses of edge endpoints become an easy task especially when considering
    websites like Shodan,20 a search engine for all IoT connected devices. Beside
    directly compromising IoT devices or edge endpoints to gain access to the smart
    farm network, an indirect attack to compromise third parties is also a potential
    risk. As an example, smart farms often use third party agronomy analytics to analyze
    the collected data which can be used in many research areas such as plant biology
    and genetics, agriculture economy, supply forecasts, and disease predictions.
    Those parties might be given direct access to smart farm data on the edge for
    real-time analytics. An attacker might phish for such third parties, compromise
    their systems and inject malicious software to redirect the data sent to external
    servers for data theft. Such attacks are very hard to detect, since attackers
    are using legitimate stolen third party credentials. B. Authorization & Trust
    In smart farming applications, connected entities including autonomous tractors,
    flying drones, on field sensors etc. communicate and interact with each other,
    and issue command and control operations to provide automated and efficient experience.
    Such communication can be direct machine to machine or via a cloud or edge assisted
    network which can support Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT21), Constrained
    Application Protocol (CoAP22) or other IoT communication protocols. In either
    case, it is essential to ensure that the messages are sent from a trusted authorized
    entity, rather from a malicious adversary. This exchange of information, like
    moisture level of soil, information about crop yield, cost of fertilizer, or sensitive
    data about the livestock like health, current location, breeding decision information
    and other farm related private data sent to the cloud or to a third-party application
    must be authorized by the owner of the field or a concerned party. Livestock are
    important part of agriculture, and a big component of a farmer’s income. Sensors
    can be embedded in the cattle [41]–[43] which can monitor their health and can
    be used to remotely inject medicines or enable preventive actions from a doctor.
    Even in case of livestock purchase, buyer can be given temporary access to the
    data of an animal they are interested in, which can help them analyse it before
    purchase. As these animals are kept in monitored environments, remotely controlling
    the temperature or making adverse conditions in barn can affect the yield of animals,
    and can also result in epidemics and widespread disease. Over the air (OTA) updates
    for the equipment’s firmware must be from a trusted party, a bad software patch
    received for a critical agriculture equipment can curtail a farmer from using
    it at the needed time of harvesting and planting. Cross cloud and multi cloud
    trust models [44], [45] are needed when entities associated at different cloud
    providers interact and access data remotely. In case of a mechanic trying to diagnose
    an engine of an autonomous tractor, or a doctor trying to access data of a cattle
    located in a private cloud, trust levels need to be established so as to enable
    such access. Several access control models have been proposed for IoT [46]–[58]
    like systems, however their feasability in dynamic smart farming is still to be
    investigated. Proper authorization is needed for a farmer to issue a command,
    to a smart water sprinkler, or to fetch the latest readings from a soil moisture
    sensor. Farm rivalry can exploit such connectivity to the sensors, and may flood
    a farmer’s field, or make it parched. Usually in farms, labor is hired on a temporary
    basis mostly at the time of harvesting and sowing, therefore, temporary access
    to smart equipment can be delegated to on field workers for non-critical operations.
    It may be the case that a critical operation, like running an autonomous tractor
    on the field, or flying a drone over the field to spray pesticides may need multi
    level authorization. C. Authentication & Secure Communication One of the most
    important aspects of security and privacy in smart farming is authentication of
    connected devices. Devices need to be authenticated first in order to get connected
    to various services on a smart farming system. They are usually low power devices,
    with limited processing power, memory, and storage, so legacy public-key infrastructure
    (PKI) authentication mechanisms cannot be considered as feasible solutions. Alternatively,
    secure lightweight multi-factor authentication protocols which are offered as
    a service [13], [59] are more realistic solutions in a smart farming network environment.
    In fact, an intermediary Certifying Authority (CA) can facilitate the authentication
    of a connecting device [60]. Such authentication mechanisms do not consume devices’
    limited resources for authentication processing, but also unauthorized devices
    will be prevented from connecting and accessing the network in an efficient way
    [61]. Moreover, devices may sometime join or leave different layers of a smart
    farming ecosystem. This entails dynamic authenticated mechanisms that apply authentication
    on demand to ensure that only legitimate devices are allowed to have access to
    different services spanning over different layers. Providing end to end secure
    communication in a smart farming setting requires securing the communication between
    devices in a particular layer and also securing the inter-layer communication
    [62]. While cryptography-based solutions prove their effectiveness in securing
    both intra-layer and inter-layer communications, employing them on constrained
    IoT devices is a big concern. There are, however, limited attempts to apply lightweight
    cryptography solutions to a smart farming ecosystem [14]. Additionally, quantum-based
    cryptography for a secure end to end communication for IoT devices is under active
    investigation [63] as a futuristic solution. However, the feasibility of such
    solutions have not been evaluated in real world scenarios. D. Compliance and Regulations
    Smart farming and precision agriculture raises various legal issues, which remain
    partially unanswered. The following are some of the major issues in this area.
    1) Contracts and Agreements A smart farm involves different parties like the farmers,
    the cloud service providers, the networking infrastructure providers, to name
    a few (See Section II). These different parties need to negotiate and agree on
    various parts of contracts [12], [64]. These contracts include data privacy, security
    and intellectual property protection clauses. Data protection is essential for
    the development of smart farms and is a major part of these contracts. Such contracts
    between interested parties are crucial to protect the value and confidentiality
    of the data as an important asset. Farmers who use smart farming tools also need
    to negotiate in advance finer elements of these contracts. For example, which
    party shall be responsible in case data processing and analysis lead to wrong
    decisions affecting different downstream tasks in the pipeline. Another important
    contractual element example is the decision involving use of self-driving tractors,
    which are subject to the set of obligations applicable to self-driving cars. In
    this scenario, strong compensation and limitation of liability clauses may help
    the farmers. 2) Data Security and Privacy Farmers who deploy smart infrastructure
    fear that their data might be stolen by competitors or be publicly released. Hence,
    data security is crucial and agreements with technology providers should include
    specific clauses. Although most smart farming techniques process non-personal
    data, linking of such information to a particular personally identifiable information
    (PII) poses serious concerns [12], [64]. For example, data of livestock directly
    referring to their owner; crops conditions linked to farmers’ personal details.
    In this case, privacy clauses should be included to prohibit personal data processing
    to a certain degree. Further issues may arise when smart farming equipment, such
    as drones or tractors, have the functionality to monitor their users [12], [64].
    3) Intellectual Property (IP) An important question from a compliance perspective
    is who owns the data collected on a smart farm. This is specially important as
    data privacy laws cannot solve this issue. As per the current regulatory setup,
    data itself cannot be protected, however copyright provisions can be utilized
    to achieve high level of safeguards. Most farmers include IP protection clauses
    [64] in contracts that they create with smart farming technology providers [12].
    4) Regulatory Agriculture and livestock production is a highly regulated industry.
    Various countries across the globe have many laws, regulations, and supervisory
    authorities [65]–[67]. These touch upon specific compliance requirements for producing
    and selling of products. Such compliance can be achieved easier by using smart
    farming technology that help farmers and regulators track, audit, and inspect
    every step of the production pipeline. 5) Cyber Insurance Cyber Insurance allows
    victims to protect themselves from various cyber risks. However, cyber insurance
    policies in agriculture have lagged in the coverage of cyber incidents and events.
    Most of the current available agriculture based cyber insurances are very ambiguous
    and limited in their coverage [64]. SECTION IV. Smart Farming Ecosystem Cyber
    Attacks This section elaborates possible cyber attacks in smart farming ecosystem.
    We have categorized attacks into four different classes as shown in Figure 4.
    We have discussed data specific and network specific attacks orchestrated on smart
    farms including IoT based farming sensors. We have also explored cyber attacks
    from the supply chain side to highlight the vulnerabilities as more and more systems
    get connected to the internet and generating sensitive data. FIGURE 4. Smart farming
    ecosystem cyber attacks. Show All A. Data Attacks 1) Insider Data Leakage Farmers
    fear leakage of confidential data the most among other threats as it can be used
    against them in the commodity market. An insider (like a disgruntled employee)
    can leak such data to intentionally cause harm or sell data for money. For example,
    a former engineer at Allen and Hoshall was able to access the company’s data over
    a period of two years.23 Data this employee accessed included engineering schematic,
    project proposals, and marketing information which had an estimated value of $500,000.
    2) Cloud Data Leakage Smart farming data is very sensitive and can reveal a lot
    of confidential agriculture and economic information about the entire country.
    Cloud data centers are distributed across the world and, in some instances, virtual
    machines might be placed in data centers located in different countries. Data
    might be less secure if it is stored in data centers in other countries. These
    countries could place less strict security requirements on companies. Additionally,
    their governments might also intercept or collect that data stored on servers
    within their own jurisdictions. For these reasons, countries have started adding
    laws for sensitive data localization. For instance, China has placed a new cybersecurity
    law24 into effect in 2017 stating, among other things, that personal data must
    be stored on domestic servers. As such, companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon
    started taking steps to transfer control of Chinese data to Chinese firms. 3)
    False Data Injection Attack In this attack, an attacker attempts to change/falsify
    data that contributes to important real-time decisions, with the assumption that
    adversary has the knowledge of the system and its configuration. For example,
    injecting false information about the soil moisture level will result in over
    watering and, in turn, damaging the crops. 4) Misinformation Attack In this attack,
    the aim is to endanger data integrity. An attacker may release false data about
    a smart farm claiming the outbreak of a disease in crops or livestock. Such false
    data reports mimic the form of an actual report released by the targeted smart
    farm. As a result, it will take a lot of time, effort and money to prove that
    the released report is false. B. Networking and Equipment Attacks 1) Radio Frequency
    (FR) Jamming Attack In many cases, smart farming equipment rely on radio frequency
    communication, like cellular or satellite networks. A smart farming equipment
    often use global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) to improve efficiency with
    products and techniques such as path planning, auto steering, seeding and spray
    rates. GNSS is achieved by combining GPS with real time kinematics (RTK) technology
    to enhance the precision of real-time position data. Attackers may jam GNSS for
    malicious purpose by deploying many distributed low power jammers to disrupt GNSS
    over wide areas and, in turn, prevent smart farming equipment from functioning
    properly. 2) Malware Injection Attack One of the most prevalent threats to smart
    farming is malware injection attack [68], where an attacker injects a malware
    into a connected smart device. Malware is a very common threat in large scale
    systems since, in most cases, it acts and propagates through the system automatically,
    hence making it a very attractive target to attackers. Precision agriculture is
    being adopted widely, meaning that more farms are connected to the internet. Typically,
    most of these farm deployments use similar software components (e.g., usage of
    LoRa25 and ZigBee26). As a result, a malware that infects a particular smart farm
    will most likely infect other farms with similar deployments. The damage caused
    by malware comes in many shapes and types. Malware can steal information about
    the consumption of agricultural materials, purchase information of fruits, vegetables
    and livestock, data about agricultural machinery etc. It can also recruit smart
    devices as part of a botnet which will be used for committing malicious acts controlled
    by an attacker. Further, malware can hinder the functions of physical smart equipment
    which, in turn, can have a devastating effect on a particular crop harvest or
    farm area. 3) Denial of Service Attack IoT devices used in smart farming environments
    can always be used to launch large scale denial of service (DoS) attacks [69]
    similar to what happened in 2016 using Mirai botnet [70]. In that occasion, an
    army of dummy CCTVs was exploited to launch one of the biggest DoS attacks that
    happened recently. There are usually a large number of inter-connected nodes and
    groups in a farm, and thus, similar type of attacks are possible in context of
    smart farming. These attacks not only can disrupt normal functions of different
    modules in an individual farm but also can be leveraged to interrupt legitimate
    cyber services in other domains. 4) Botnet With IoT everything is capable of getting
    connected to the internet. In smart farming ecosystem, there are many IoT related
    devices at each architectural layer. These devices are prone to attacks and can
    then be controlled by a central malicious system. This forms a so called ‘Botnet
    of Things’ [71]. A zombie army of infected farm IoT devices [72] can easily be
    used to infect many other networks through different mediums and hence a smart
    farm may turn out to be an internet of vulnerabilities for cyber criminals. Smart
    farm devices are not built with security as a concern and even if they do, users
    usually neglect the basic steps of setting adequate cybersecurity defense mechanisms.
    5) Side Channel Attack Attacks which have their roots in gaining information from
    how a system is implemented rather than what weakness exists in the system implementation
    are called side channel attacks. Smart farming is one of the IoT use case and
    hence it inherits some common IoT vulnerabilities including side channel attacks
    [73]. In such attacks, there are different channels which can be exploited by
    attackers. In timing channel attacks, for example, computation time along with
    cache miss and cache hit timing patterns are among those attacks vectors which
    can be exploited by adversaries. Hardware glitching in forms of voltage fluctuations
    and variances in system clock period during execution tasks are other possible
    attack channels. Other channels for launching a successful attack are power consumption
    patterns, possible electromagnetic leaks or even sound and acoustic channels.
    C. Supply Chain Attacks The entire agriculture ecosystem and the notion of ‘farm
    to plate’ involves several entities which work in tandem to provide quality food
    to the end consumer in a just-in time environment. This supply chain system [74]
    starts from the farm, which produces raw material that, in turn, is stored and
    processed by the food industry. The processed food is packed and sent to distribution
    retailer from where the end customer purchases processed goods. With IoT technology
    at each stage of the supply chain, it introduces potential cybersecurity threats
    since a security breach in just-in-time distribution system could also have a
    serious cascading effects on the entire supply chain. The massive scale of attacks
    like WannaCry27 ransomware, and the recent spate of ransomwares in cities28 across
    the US, suggest that even a breach or data freeze at a single inter-dependent
    entity will be enough to disrupt the whole chain and possibly the economy of a
    country. An attack on the agriculture equipment and fertilizer provider companies
    could potentially disable critical connected machinery needed at a prime time.
    It could manipulate the amount of nutrients in the fertilizers [64] which could
    seriously destroy the crops rather than nourishing them. The smart devices can
    be infected by malware which are controlled and commanded remotely. In such a
    scenario, large scale attacks can be orchestrated on all the smart farms utilizing
    those compromised machinery resulting in massive disruption in the sector. Needless
    to say that the suppliers of such machinery might loose trust and confidence of
    their customers. Such smart machinery needs dynamic calibration to determine the
    distance at which seeds need to be planted or the amount of fertilizers to be
    sprayed based on historical crop data. This calibration related information is
    uploaded in the machine software over-the-air (OTA), which suggests that deliberate
    uploading of false information to the machine software can have larger scale impact.
    US Foods29 has more than 250,000 customers which purchase supplies, will be affected
    badly if US Foods IT infrastructure is hit by a ransomware or a cyber attack disrupting
    its computer assisted facility and impacting critical processes. Temperature and
    conditions under which the produce is transferred is an important factor to maintain
    the freshness of the product. Smart monitors ensure that products are processed
    and packed at appropriate temperatures. Adversaries can manipulate these sensor
    readings or issue a command to change the temperature that could result in inappropriate
    temperature conditions for produce, which can impact the end consumers as well
    as the entire supply chain. These attacks are not limited to direct stakeholders,
    but for example, contaminated water from a compromised water treatment facility
    used in irrigation can destroy the whole crop field. Even attacks on smart grid
    due to sudden surge in demand and grid overloading can result in blackout which
    in-turn can spoil the stored produce in large storage houses, inducing huge losses
    to the supplier. Blockchain30 based solutions have been proposed to ensure the
    provenance of the food products in the chain, which offers transparency and assure
    quality of the food. However, the entire cost to use this system will not be clear
    unless widely adopted [75]. Smart farming goes beyond agriculture where livestock
    sector is also considered an important part. An attack on this sector can also
    have massive disruptions, where a malicious actor can publish false data about
    a disease outbreaks or unapproved genetic modifications of crops. Similarly, sensors
    and smart devices in the buildings where these livestock are kept can be attacked
    or altered to change the temperature, which can put to harm the entire livestock
    on the farm. Also, for livestock feed products, if an IT system monitoring the
    ingredients of the feed is compromised, it can potentially lead to wide-spread
    contamination in livestock which can easily reach humans as well. D. Other Relevant
    Attacks 1) Compliance and Regulation Food production and farming are a highly
    regulated industry with different countries having multiple national agencies
    monitoring food production. In the United States, Environment Protection Agency
    [65] and the Department of Agriculture [66] enforce various regulations and industry
    standards. In the European Union, Department of Agriculture and Rural Development
    [67] undertakes this responsibility with similar authorities in other countries.
    These federal authorities issue compliance directives to ensure quality food production.
    With the advent of smart farming technology these agencies are relying more and
    more on data produced by farm based sensors. An adversary attacking a smart farm
    can specifically inject false data that will then impact various compliance certification
    processes. This certification process if invalidated, can impact a nation’s food
    supply, affect crop price, etc. The complex smart farming ecosystem, creates a
    broad attack surface that needs to be protected to ensure data integrity. 2) Cyber
    Terrorism The increased use of digital interconnected system in agriculture sector
    brings new opportunities for terrorists to attack places that previously were
    too remote or difficult to strike. Cyber terrorism is a relatively low-cost venture
    with high payoff potential, making the risks of agro-terrorism too large to ignore.
    Therefore, it is important to find solutions that guarantee trust and transparency
    within smart farming concept, as well as protect critical resources. 3) Cloud
    Computing Attacks Cloud is a very diverse, decentralized, heterogeneous and powerful
    ecosystem. The enormous amount of distributed resources make the cloud a hard
    target. However, with the introduction of new cloud concepts (e.g., on-demand
    services, auto-scaling, and self provisioning), attackers have used such resources
    in their favor and, in turn, cloud has become one of the most desirable targets
    to attacker. For example, with the introduction of auto-scaling in cloud, a large
    part of the virtual machines hosted on cloud are similarly configured. If one
    of the virtual machines is vulnerable, it is highly likely that all auto-scaled
    virtual machines are vulnerable as well. As such, a malware that infected one
    virtual machine can propagate to other virtual machines quickly. The infected
    machines can be employed as a part of global botnets which, consequently, can
    be used to launch a large scale distribute DoS (DDoS) attacks enough to hinder
    the functionality of cloud. For example, in 2018, a large scale DDoS attack was
    launched on github resulting in a record-breaking sudden traffic increase to 1.35
    terabits per second. Inevitably, DDoS attacks are becoming more frequent, more
    powerful and more sophisticated. A large scale DDoS attack with an overwhelming
    number of requests, packets or messages can deny services to smart farms, thereby
    paralyzing the brain of smart farms. Further, DDoS attacks might not be specifically
    targeting smart farms’ virtual machines. Even though, an attack might be directed
    at a different target, if virtual machines used by smart farms are on the save
    physical server, it will naturally block off other’s traffic as well. SECTION
    V. Existing Research Table 1 summarizes state-of-the-art research, challenges
    and contributions with respect to security and privacy issues in smart farming.
    We have categorized the literature into different subsections based on the focus
    areas they address. TABLE 1 Projects and Research Addressing Cybersecurity in
    Smart Farming A. Cyber Attacks, Threats and Proposed Solutions Researchers and
    federal agencies have started gauging the impact cyber-attacks as more and more
    farmers and communities are adopting technologies in the farms. The U.S. Department
    for Homeland Security released a report [12] which emphasizes the importance of
    precision agriculture (PA) and associated cybersecurity threat and potential vulnerabilities.
    The report highlights the confidentiality, integrity, and availability model of
    information security in farming. It defines different technologies involved in
    PA including in-farm devices, location and remote sensing technologies, machine
    learning, etc. It briefly discusses the impacted groups by the misuse of technologies
    in farming including farmers, livestock producers, and also industries that support
    or rely on agriculture. This report also discusses hypothetical threat scenarios
    on real life examples. Another promising work [76] highlights the vulnerabilities
    and risks due to introduction of technologies in the field of precision agriculture.
    This thesis work illustrates data collection and related empirical study, however
    falls short of security solutions in the domain. The work from Jahn [64] discuss
    implications of using smart devices in the agriculture sector. The authors make
    strong argument about how the lack of a cyber insurance framework is going to
    have a big impact on various agribusinesses. They also highlight the fact that
    a regulatory response is needed to protect the interests of farmers who adopt
    the use of smart devices. Barreto and Amaral [77] use empirical methodology based
    on the analysis of information and experiences collected in the Internet Security
    Alliance,31 the European Cyber Security Organization32 and the National Institute
    of Standards and Technology33 to highlight security challenges in smart farming.
    Some major threats discussed include security and privacy issues, social engineering,
    denial of service, cyber-espionage agroterrorism, ransomware etc. The research
    also highlights a security framework to enable farmers to better understand security
    implications. However, the paper is unable to discuss open research issues, and
    challenges to secure the environment without evidence of how the discussed attacks
    are orchestrated in the domain. Peer to Peer (P2P) is a network paradigm which
    has use cases in smart farming communication. The device authentication methods
    in this type of communication, however, rely heavily on public key infrastructure.
    Although the system is trustworthy, it puts unnecessary computation load on resource
    constrained smart farm IoT devices participating in a secure P2P communication.
    Accordingly, authors in [78] proposed a lightweight device authentication solution
    in which session keys and public keys are combined to expedite the encryption/decryption
    tasks. It results in a fast and light-weight authentication solution which is
    a good fit for smart farming communication purposes. Additionally, West [79] introduced
    a framework to understand vulnerabilities in emerging technologies and the use
    of such technologies in a smart-farming-specific environment. The framework goal
    is to quantify the degree to which the use of smart farming new technologies are
    vulnerable to cyber-attacks. It uses the common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS)
    for the threat prediction model assessment. The work shows the trade-offs between
    technology maturity and adaptation in the smart farming environment which can
    lead to system compromise. The approach in the paper uses three parameters: basic
    parameters, temporal parameters and environmental parameters for constructing
    a CVSS score. Basic parameters indicate the intrinsic and severity of a vulnerability,
    whereas temporal parameters indicate how a vulnerability might change and affect
    the system over time due to technical changes. Environmental parameters reflect
    the specifications of a vulnerability present in a smart-farming-specific environment.
    Although CVSS score has become a standard in the industry for understanding the
    severity of vulnerabilities and prioritizing their patches, it has some shortcomings.
    Smart farming is a diverse environment with many connected devices and systems.
    CVSS score deals with individual vulnerabilities and fails to accurately capture
    impact of connections within the entire system. B. Blockchain Related Research
    Recently, the usefulness of blockchain in domains other than cryptocurrency and
    financial transactions has been acknowledged [93]–[95]. Agriculture and food supply
    chain is one of the domains in which blockchain technology has shown its capabilities.
    Accordingly, the authors in [81] study overall implications, challenges and potential
    of existing blockchain-based projects in the field. Besides, it critically reviews
    maturity of such projects and elaborates on possible barriers and challenges,
    which hinder acceptability of such projects among farmers and existing cyber farming
    systems. Lin et al. [80] also focused on the use of blockchain technology for
    food safety. Authors created a system that tracks and monitors food production
    cycle, including the processes of raw materials, cultivation/breeding, processing,
    transporting, warehousing, and selling. The system also uses various IoT based
    sensors to replace manual recording and verification with sensor based verification.
    Other works [82], [84], [96] focused on providing case studies of using blockchain
    and smart contracts in smart farming. Awan et al. [82] proposed a framework based
    on IoT and blockchain technology for agriculture product tracking life cycle.
    They used smart contracts to eliminate the involvement of middlemen or third-party
    intermediaries and as such increase credibility and trust. The authors implemented
    a use case based on their proposed framework which included 120 IoT nodes and
    20 blockchain producers. Further, they validated their system based on it’s throughput
    considering different block sizes. However, this work has several drawbacks. Very
    few related works are included and comparison to other works in the literature
    is lacking. Additionally, the authors didn’t include much details about the nature
    of workload used in their experiments and they failed to add a baseline benchmark
    for the validation results for a fair comparison. Patil et al. [84] proposed a
    light-weight security framework for smart greenhouse farms based on blockchain.
    Every IoT node can elect cluster head leader which helps preventing a single point
    of failure in case an attacker targets the leader node. Additionally, the authors
    provided discussion of the security threats on their proposed framework following
    the traditional confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA) triad model
    as well as their corresponding attacks. Although, this work is interesting, the
    framework is conceptual with no implementation or experiments. Further, the paper
    didn’t include related work nor a comparison to other proposed frameworks. Besides
    proposing blockchain-based frameworks and implementations [97], real world use
    cases of blockchain in smart farming are discussed in the blockchain research
    institute article [83]. In this work, authors explore applications of blockchain
    beyond the typical financial use cases in agriculture. Accordingly, they focused
    on three classes of applications: food safety, sustainable agriculture and the
    local economy and agriculture finance. The authors accompanied each class of applications
    with real world use cases. However, these use cases are discussed on a very high
    level aspect with no implementation details or results. C. AI and Machine Learning
    Assisted Work The advent of new age technologies such as artificial intelligence
    (AI) and machine learning (ML) not only facilitate the adaptation of advanced
    analytics in smart farming, but also create an ecosystem for improving the cybersecurity
    of services. Fusion of these technologies enable farmers to achieve higher average
    yield and better price control over their products in highly competitive markets.
    Design and implementation of a low cost IoT based security monitoring system have
    been proposed by Shabadi and Biradar [85]. The system focuses on physical layer
    of smart farming where it collects data from sensors. This data is sent to a controller
    where data is analyzed to make decisions like activating the actuators for water
    sprinkler in the farms. The proposed work is focused more on implementing the
    basic functionalities of smart farming than addressing security and privacy issues.
    It is very limited to simple threshold based decisions, like, if the soil temperature
    is above a certain threshold, then activate water sprinkler. Real time security
    monitoring for a remote farm is another current application of ML in smart farming.
    In scenarios where real time monitoring and notifications are paramount to farm
    and cybersecurity, the image(s) detected through a surveillance system can be
    processed by open-source computer vision programming supported by AI. For example,
    Abuan et al. [86] proposed a neural based face recognition system which is able
    to be invariant to changes in illumination for background and illumination conditions
    through a neural network training. The agricultural and farming industries have
    been widely influenced by the disruption of the IoT. However, the impact of the
    IoT is limited in countries with less penetration of mobile internet. The boom
    of low-power wide-area networks (LPWAN) in the last decade, with technologies
    such as LoRa or NB-IoT, has mitigated this by providing a relatively cheap infrastructure
    that enables low-power and long-range transmissions. Nonetheless, the benefits
    that LPWAN technologies have the disadvantage of low-bandwidth transmissions.
    Therefore, the integration of edge and fog computing, moving data analytics and
    compression near end devices, is key in order to extend functionality. By integrating
    AI at the local network layer, referred as edge AI, authors in [87] proposed a
    system architecture and implementation that expands the possibilities of smart
    agriculture and farming applications with edge and fog computing using LPWAN technology
    for large area coverage. In another research work [88], Support Vector Machines
    (SVM) along with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are used to create an integration
    platform for big data analysis for smart farming. Such a platform not only expedites
    processing huge amounts of data collected from farms and livestocks, but also
    gives smart farming stakeholders the ability to detect and respond against possible
    cyber attacks more efficiently. D. Other Relevant Literature Chi et al. [89] present
    a framework for cybersecurity approaches in precision agriculture and discussed
    challenges of using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) in digital virtual farms. They
    also present a framework for secure data capture. Security challenges in agrifood
    sector has been extensively discussed in [90]. The report provides an overview
    of emerging technologies in smart farming. Most smart farms are data-driven with
    respect to automating agriculture processes, decision making, and predictions.
    It also raises important questions of how important is data security? How risk
    assessment is done considering the entire supply chain? Who should take responsibility
    and who should be involved? The report serves to raise awareness addressing the
    importance of cybersecurity in agrifood sector. Authors in [98] provide an overview
    of cross-section of cybersecurity in food and agriculture sectors. They also discuss
    cyber-terrorism, policies, and plans. Spaulding and Wolf [99] detail the needs
    for educating farmers about various cybersecurity threats. Authors in [100] show
    the impact of cyber attacks on smart farming infrastructure via simulations using
    NETA with OMNET++ framework. Huning et al. [101] created a system to enable privacy
    preserving crowd sourcing techniques to estimate different smart farming parameters.
    Cybersecurity perception is also changing among farmers and agribusiness owners.
    Geil et al. [91] conducted an assessment of cybersecurity practices in the United
    States agriculture industry. Insights from their work reflect that over half of
    the respondents have been victims of a computer security incident, demonstrating
    that even individuals working in agriculture can be impacted by cybersecurity
    incidents. Cyberbiosecurity [92] is a multidisciplinary domain consists of cybersecurity,
    bio-security, and cyber-physical security. It discusses how current and emerging
    information technologies affect the cybersecurity of large portion of U.S. economy
    which is based on food and agriculture (i.e. Bio-economy). As Peccoud et al. [102]
    discuss, food and agricultural sectors are immensely diverse and require advanced
    technologies and efficiencies that rely on computer technologies, big data, cloud-based
    data storage, and internet accessibility, at the same time are vulnerable to cybersecurity
    incidents. Based on our literature review, it can be emphasised that, there is
    a dearth of security related research done in smart farming domain. There are
    numerous unanswered important security questions and open research challenges
    as discussed in the following section. SECTION VI. Open Challenges and Research
    Areas This section discusses open research challenges for improving security and
    privacy in smart farming ecosystem, as well illustrated in Figure 5. These open
    problems have been divided into four subsections as follows. FIGURE 5. Open research
    challenges and future directions for cybersecurity in smart farming. Show All
    A. Access Control, Trust & Privacy Perspective The multi-layered architecture
    discussed in section II recognizes possibilities of cyber threat challenges, which
    needs to be addressed by extending and adapting current access control foundational
    research, as well as developing sophisticated access control solutions to assist
    dynamic and agile environments in cyber-physical systems like smart farms. In-farm
    and cross farm operations need authorized interaction among sensors and labor/farmers
    working at multiple farms operating different sets of smart devices. What kind
    of operations they can do must be checked, which may require single level or multiple
    level access control depending on the risk factor associated with the operation?
    For example, consider sowing the field with autonomous tractor as compared to
    turning ON an irrigation system during the rainy season. Delegation and revocation
    of access rights to operate on a farm must be automatically performed based on
    the contract agreement, for example, in case temporary labor hired during harvesting
    season. Such access control requirements need further investigation to be adopted
    in such dynamic environment. The notion of trust can also be developed where labor
    who has worked earlier or an equipment borrowed from a ‘known’ old friend may
    have higher trust level as compared to machine and manpower hired from co-operative
    market. Self-configurable AI assisted smart access control policies need to be
    developed in a sharing-dominated CPS domain like smart farming. Cyber physical
    systems introduce the notion of virtual objects (which can be created in cloud
    or edge environment) corresponding to real physical sensors. An important challenge
    here is the location of cyber entities created as a part of connection with cloud
    or edge environments, for example, AWS device shadows34 or Microsoft Azure device
    twins.35 Research needs to determine: a) how cyber entity will move from one cloud
    (or edge) to another if the corresponding device is borrowed from one farmer to
    another? b) how the control of virtual entities will be delegated to the lending
    farmer, whether both the farmers need to use same application? c) how the applications
    will allow to delegate access for machine operation? d) Can the virtual objects
    or equipment across farms communicate with each other, whether at the physical
    level or using the virtual entities? If it is the virtual entity across different
    accounts in the same cloud provider, how such interaction will take place? In
    case it is across different cloud providers, how cross cloud and federated cloud
    environments will ensure such trust levels? Suppose in case a farmer has borrowed
    an equipment from a friend farmer, will the original owner be able to have access
    to it, or the access will be completely revoked? Is it possible to control a device
    through different remote clouds? All are relevant questions in smart farming domain.
    Further, how to establish trust mechanisms among different cloud service providers
    which the farmer is using for services and alerts? Manufacturer of the device
    may hold digital twin [103] and the cloud used by farmers will get data from on-field
    sensor and the cloud provider via pre-defined and signed negotiations. Such negotiations
    can also define what kind of data will be shared with required permissions of
    the owner farmer. Another important question is, how to establish trust between
    physical sensor objects? One approach is sensors at the same farm trust each other
    more for the shared information as compared to sensors across different farms.
    IoT and CPS specific cross cloud access controls and related security models are
    still in infancy stage and need more attention. Livestock and animals also have
    sensors embedded, which require appropriate authorized access. However, current
    literature does not provide strong access control mechanisms that can restrict
    such operations and secure critical data sharing from cattle and livestock at
    the farm. These wearable and health monitoring devices are attached to livestock
    and collect sensitive data, which can be used by adversaries to control the animal
    or even effect the sale/purchase of a cattle, for example, having the information
    about which cow is having low milk production. Efficient access controls [104]–[106]
    are needed to safeguard such sensitive data in cloud, which needs more research
    considering the spate of breaches heard every now and then. Usually in case of
    wearable IoT devices, a human which has the device controls what kind of data
    he/she wants to be shared. However, it is not in case of livestock which has a
    master (like the owner of the farm or caretaker) to decide control. Also, as a
    cattle is sold/purchased and moves from one owner to another, relevant data sharing
    security policies need to be specified and will require automatically configured
    information sharing. Studies [107], [108] have shown vulnerabilities in human
    used fitness devices, however, such studies and research are still an open challenge
    in case of livestock devices. Since data is collected from smart devices spread
    across farms, different applications require to access to this data. Consequentially,
    it is important to limit the sharing of data across applications and across nearby
    friend farmers, who may also get some value or receive alerts for their farms.
    How and when to share such information requires adaptive security policies to
    control and supervise data transferred by sensors to the cloud platform. Further,
    if data is sharing across multi cloud systems, cross cloud trust also needs to
    be addressed. Appropriate attribute based fine grained access controls [109],
    [110] and privacy preserving schemes need to be deployed to ensure confidentiality
    of the data. Evidently, farmers must decide the level and type of data sharing
    needed to ensure the privacy of critical information. B. Data Perspective The
    most noticeable feature of smart farming is its communication ability between
    the smart devices, resulting in an unprecedented amount of generated data [7],
    [111]. This provides many challenges as discussed in section III and open doors
    for several research opportunities. Machine learning is an attractive solution
    for processing big data, and implementing effective security solutions. Insider
    data leakage detection has always been a daunting task as users already have legitimate
    access to the system, making it hard to detect and predict such attacks. Several
    research works have been conducted on insider data leakage [22], [112], [113];
    however, none has been targeting smart farming settings. Further investigation
    is needed to understand the possibility of adopting insider data leakage defense
    mechanisms into smart farming and whether unique characteristics of smart farming
    can help to improve these mechanisms. Smart farms are highly connected systems,
    which allow malware to easily propagate through the network infecting all interconnected
    devices. An interesting question is how to detect malware in smart farming IoT
    environment, especially considering all heterogeneous devices in place. For instance,
    a malware detection technique that works against a malware that infects smart
    farming equipment might not work against malware that infects edge or cloud systems
    since the malware’s end goal is different. Many AI assisted malware detection
    techniques [114]–[120] are proposed and used in practice; however, there are no
    smart-farming-specific malware detection techniques that consider the context
    and environment in which smart farms reside. Smart farms generate diverse and
    vast amount of unstructured data. It is almost impossible for one party to analyze
    and make use of the entire datasets. For this reason, threat information sharing
    is a viable approach for data security. For instance, each smart farm can employ
    a malware detection technique; however, it is guaranteed that none of these employed
    techniques is comprehensive enough to catch all types of malware. Information
    sharing between smart farms can prove very useful. It can be used as an asset
    to share threat information about attack patterns or malware that was detected
    by collaborating smart farms. In a similar case, if a deployed detection technique
    in a farm detected supplied water with high toxin content, it is relevant to share
    that information with nearby farms who may also be impacted by similar issue.
    This can save analysis cost and money for every participating smart farm as it
    prevents doing work that someone else already did before. What kind of data, meta-data
    or analysis can be shared remains an open question and what kind of threat information
    sharing process can be used remain an open question for resource constrained farmers.
    Smart farming is an emerging field, so it is highly likely to encounter zero-day
    attacks which have not been detected before. Anomaly detection [121]–[125] is
    a very appealing solution against such attacks. Anomaly detection techniques look
    for any abnormal behavior that deviates from the pre-established database of normal
    behavior. These normal behaviour profiles are constructed based on collection
    of historical observations and patterns. Building smart farms behavior profiles
    is a challenging task since their behaviors are so dynamic in nature. External
    factors are a major reason for this dynamism. For example, less irrigation is
    needed during a rainy weather than dry weather which will cause a different behavior
    for irrigation systems. Can weather forecast information be used as an indication
    of such change of behavior? What kind of data contribute to building smart farms
    behavior profiles? Do some data fields weigh more than others? These are all open
    research questions that need to be investigated. Detection mechanisms are used
    to detect faulty and compromised sensors by monitoring the data sent for any tampered
    or abnormal values. Employing a simple threshold based mechanism can easily be
    bypassed by an attacker, so in most cases, more sophisticated machine learning
    based mechanisms need to be deployed. However, smart attackers can still bypass
    these models by (1) exploiting the sensors and a little tweaking of data sent
    by these sensors just to lead the machine learning model in place to misclassify/mispredict
    the outcome (such attack is called adversarial machine learning attack), and (2)
    poisoning the model during training phase by injecting bad data into the model’s
    training database, and in turn get it to learn something it shouldn’t. Some research
    addressed mitigation against adversarial attacks; however, it is not clear whether
    these technologies can be adopted to smart farming domain which is very dominant
    on changing environment conditions. Another open research challenge is to create
    various artificial intelligence systems that collect and parse Cyber Threat Intelligence
    (CTI36) about smart devices, software, cloud systems etc. used in the smart farming
    ecosystem. These systems have been developed to collect CTI in other areas [126]–[129]
    and need to be extended to ensure coverage of various smart farming devices, equipment
    and software. C. Network Perspective Cybersecurity threats to smart farming and
    its devices include a diverse range of security risks due to certain characteristics
    of the underlying networking and communication technologies which are used in
    the domain. First, both virtual and physical communication environments get connected.
    Many IoT devices in a smart farm system are capable of functioning on the data
    they receive from their respective environments which shortens the distance between
    virtual and physical systems. While convenient for the users, it allows cyber
    threats to convert to physical consequences more quickly, thereby having a bigger
    impact. Second, devices and layers involved in a smart farm system create a complex
    communication environment. Hyper connected farming environments exist due to the
    growing availability and diversity of IoT devices. ‘Complex’ in this context means
    that large number of devices are working in a single smart farm environment such
    that dynamic interactions between them are possible. This complexity expands the
    capabilities of an environment, but at the cost of a wider attack surface. Smart
    farming like other emerging technologies is embracing new networking paradigms
    to tackle today’s sophisticated attacks. Software defined network (SDN) [130]–[132]
    is one such promising networking revolution. Through decoupling control plane
    from data plane and giving credit to network programmable, it offers interesting
    technical capabilities to network providers. This causes an intense adaption of
    SDN in almost every fields of networking, from data center networks to WANs, wireless,
    5G and recently IoT. Using SDN in smart farm networking is attracting to both
    academia and industry for certain reasons. SDN supports both physical and virtual
    networking scenarios very well. It also offers a reliable way of practicing networking
    in highly diverse and naturally heterogeneous smart farms networking environment.
    Moreover, using SDN, smart farms are able to form a holistic view of all the connected
    devices along with how they interact in a near real time manner. Such a holistic
    view not only improves agility, scalability, and manageability of smart farm networking
    but also empowers a large smart farm network to enforce robust security counter
    measure against possible sophisticated cyber attacks. It is important to research
    further the adaptability of SDN and other 5G related next generation communication
    technologies in smart farming and precision agriculture domain. SDN can enable
    smart farms to get the most benefit out of complex machine learning and AI algorithms
    to automate network management of large number of sensors, wireless and wired
    networks used in a smart farming ecosystem. It also facilitates implementing advanced,
    cross-layer network security solutions which are very time and resource consuming,
    if not impossible, otherwise. Finally, SDN expedites edge networking and hence
    cloud-based security-as-a-service delivery model becomes a more approachable solution
    in large smart farming deployments. D. Compliance and Supply Chain Perspective
    With the ubiquitous use of sensors, automated drones, blockchain, artificial intelligence
    integration, different agricultural businesses are falling back on compliance,
    regulation and cyber insurance to protect themselves [64]. With the development
    of targeted malware and other cyber threats, the entire food supply chain is at
    risk [12], [64]. A hostile actor specifically interested in disrupting the supply
    chain can target various organizations and companies that supply raw material
    to farms or process food for the end user. A potential solution to this problem
    is to develop industry standards that enable trust between various raw material
    suppliers and downstream food processors [64]. The development of these standards
    enforced by national governments through regulation, has been slow. One example
    of such a shortcoming, is the existence of a few cybersecurity standards for the
    many smart devices used in the food supply chain. Various legislation are being
    introduced to set ‘minimal cybersecurity operational standards for internet connected
    devices’. In specific cases where various governments do not wish to regulate
    these interactions, it is up to various agriculture businesses to protect themselves
    by asking their supply chain to ‘self-regulate’ cybersecurity best practices [64].
    Such developments can be pushed through market demands, competitive pressure,
    etc. The food supply chain also lacks robust cyber insurance policies. With the
    constant development of smart applications, AI, smart farming equipment, etc.
    cyber insurance providers are unable to predict and quantify various cyber risks
    involved in these systems. Specific research needs to be done so as to develop
    standard legal jargon and metrics to quantify cyber risk in smart farming. These
    will help create robust cyber insurance markets for precision agriculture. Various
    systems [133]–[136] also need to be built to make it easier for the end users
    to understand and parse these complex legal documents, cyber insurance policies,
    agreements, contracts, etc. Research on these open challenges will help wide adoption
    of precision agriculture technologies. SECTION VII. Conclusion The proliferation
    of smart devices with communication and sensing capabilities have unleashed plethora
    of user services, and at the same time made tasks more convenient and efficient
    for humans. However, wide adoption of such internet connected devices and data
    driven applications across various domains have raised security and privacy issues,
    making these systems vulnerable to cyber-attacks. This paper discusses such cybersecurity
    challenges in smart farming and elaborates open research questions. The paper
    first outlines a multi-layer smart farming architecture illustrating different
    entities pertinent to real time use-cases supported by edge and cloud environments.
    Based on the architecture, the paper outlines security and privacy issues and
    highlights different attacks scenarios in smart farms as well as scenarios affecting
    the entire food supply chain. Thereafter, this article surveys the state-of-the-art
    research and acknowledges important works related to cybersecurity in the domain.
    Finally, the paper illustrates several open challenges and research problems pertinent
    to security and privacy aspects in precision agriculture. We envision this paper
    will simulate research to solve platitude of security and data privacy issues
    in fast growing and economically important smart farming sector. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    of intelligent sprinkler irrigation technologies for remote autonomous system
    Xingye Zhu, Prince Chikangaise, Weidong Shi, Wen-Hua Chen, Shouqi Yuan  Abstract  Changing
    of environmental conditions and shortage of water demands a system that can manage
    irrigation efficiently. Autonomous irrigation systems are developed to optimize
    water use for agricultural crops. In dry areas or in case of inadequate rainfall,
    irrigation becomes difficult. So, it needs to be automated for proper yield and
    handled remotely for farmer safety. The aim of this study is to review the needs
    of soil moisture sensors in irrigation, sensor technology and their applications
    in irrigation scheduling and, discussing prospects. The review further discusses
    the literature of sensors remotely communicating with self-propelled sprinkler
    irrigation systems, distributed wireless sensor networks, sensors and integrated
    data management schemes and autonomous sprinkler control options. On board and
    field-distributed sensors can collect data necessary for real-time irrigation
    management decisions and transmit the information directly or through wireless
    networks to the main control panel or base computer. Communication systems such
    as cell phones, satellite radios, and internet-based systems are also available
    allowing the operator to query the main control panel or base computer from any
    location at any time. Selection of the communication system for remote access
    depends on local and regional topography and cost. Traditional irrigation systems
    may provide unnecessary irrigation to one part of a field while leading to a lack
    of irrigation in other parts. New sensors or remotely sensing capabilities are
    required to collect real time data for crop growth status and other parameters
    pertaining to weather, crop and soil to support intelligent and efficient irrigation
    management systems for agricultural processes. Further development of wireless
    sensor applications in agriculture is also necessary for increasing efficiency,
    productivity and profitability of farming operations. Keywords: intelligent sprinkler

  explanation: '**Explanation:**


    This study investigates the critical role of data quality, accuracy, and reliability
    in the context of irrigation management. The authors posit that high-quality data
    is essential for precise decision-making and effective irrigation practices. Without
    accurate and reliable data, irrigation systems may not be able to provide optimal
    water delivery, leading to inefficiencies and potential crop damage. The study
    underscores the need for robust data collection and transmission protocols to
    ensure the integrity and reliability of data used in automated irrigation systems.'

    Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing ((AISC,volume 931)) Abstract In
    our days, almost every business relays on medium-to-high performance computer
    systems which presents the possibility of being the target of different threats
    that can exploit the vulnerable software, respectively hardware components. The
    concept of “security risk” can be described as a specific threat that using a
    specific type of attack presents the ability to exploit system vulnerabilities,
    action which will affect the entire integrity of the targeted systems. From this
    point of view, the main idea of this paper is to present a Lego methodology approach
    for Common Criteria certification that can be applied to IoT Telemetry systems.
    Furthermore, we present scenarios of implementation of our approach to increase
    robustness level applied for agro-telemetry system. Keywords Lego methodology

    Download conference paper PDF 1 Introduction Security certification for heterogenous
    Internet of Things (IoT) systems poses several challenges, as IoT devices become
    more ubiquitous. To discover the impact that security risks can have over a System
    Under Analysis (SUA), there must be specified very clearly the systems’ description,
    considering two essential perspectives which present certain criteria, such as:
    (a) Information and functionality: Evaluation of the security risks impact. An
    appropriate example can be the affected parts of systems’ services, including
    data processing functions. This perspective is also known as Aim of refinement;
    Criteria of partition: Specific sections of the data or functions can require
    distinct security requirements which present unique criticality levels. (b) System
    architecture: Aim of refinement: Every level of each component of a system can
    present a security risk potential. These levels must be detected in order to improve
    the security level of the entire system; Criteria of partition: Every component,
    such as software and hardware components or even an entire network, presents several
    security risks that can be traced. Because of this characteristic, the architecture
    of potentially vulnerable systems is divided into components, the specific risks
    of each component being identified. In the computer security field, the threat
    concept is defined as an imminent danger situation that can exploit the vulnerabilities
    of a system in order to breach its security mechanisms. Threats can be divided
    into three main categories, as follows [1]: Intentional threats – represent premeditated
    invasive actions. The best example of intentional threats consists of computer
    crimes, including software attacks, theft, espionage, sabotage, etc.; Unintentional
    threats – represent accidental software modifications due to human mistakes or
    technical misunderstandings; Natural threats – represent several threats that
    can damage the physical equipment, such as: natural disasters, power failures,
    fires and floods. The main idea of this article is the presentation of a Lego
    methodology approach for Common Criteria that can be applied to IoT Telemetry
    systems [2]. This methodology allows to select security functions according to
    a specific use case, integrate various evaluated and non-evaluated components,
    plug-and-play (exchange, add, remove and update) new components, perform additional
    tests to demonstrate a higher robustness level of some security functions. As
    it was previously specified, the natural and unintentional threats will be excluded
    from this work activity. The attention will be focused on the intentional threats.
    These threats can also be classified into 3 categories, as follows [1]: Depletion:
    the targeted sectors of these threats are data and resource availability. As an
    effect, a resource will be consumed faster than it can be replenished. After a
    period of time, a resource which is being attacked becomes depleted, fact that
    affects the target functionality; Alteration: in this case, threats occur when
    an unauthorized entity tries to modify private code or data, affecting in this
    manner the integrity of the target; Disclosure: when talking about disclosure,
    threats will affect only the information confidentiality, especially specific
    system information, such as backup and temporary files, patch levels, version
    numbers software distribution, etc. The article will be structured in 5 Sections.
    The current Section represents the introduction, having the main purpose of providing
    sufficient information for a general idea of the security risks impact. In Sect.
    2 will be analyzed the present work activities in this field, being mentioned
    only the most notable research efforts. The methodology approach for Common Criteria
    can be seen in Sect. 3, while several scenarios of implementation will be presented
    in Sect. 4. The last section of this paper draws the conclusions and envisions
    future work. 2 Related Work The innovative developments in the Information and
    Communication Technology (ICT) field produce various embedded things/devices which
    contain sensors and have the property to transfer data among other objects [3].
    In the paper [4], a study has been conducted regarding the methods through which
    the equipment from a use case on a smart service in the industrial maintenance
    domain are securely transmitting their data. The paper examines two solutions
    focused on isolation and execution environment security, namely a Security Controller
    and the ARM TrustZone. For their comparison, a system that takes a device’s snapshot
    authentication has been designed. The results demonstrate increased flexibility
    when using the TrustZone technology and a much secure physical environment for
    the Security Controller. Finally, it is conducted that the best approach is only
    based on the desired use case. The article also proposes a hybrid solution that
    increases the security of industrial applications, which could bring a contribution
    to the future Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Furthermore, there is a recent
    survey about technical approaches, functional requirements, and on overall, the
    security status based on the OpenFog’s [5] architecture. The OpenFog Consortium
    designed the Fog Nodes functional security requirements by adopting the Common
    Criteria standard. The Fog Nodes bolster a trusted computing environment as well
    as a secure service provisioning and also the hardware virtualization. Therefore,
    by using these entities, the multi-tier omnipresent communication-computing infrastructure
    which encompasses a multitude of devices and covers sophisticated hierarchies
    of application areas and administration, will have a more trusted environment
    due to increased security levels. The IoT paradigm emerged into the car tracking
    technology, is being described in [6]. The paper describes the IoT’s role in designing
    a car tracking system as well as the needed standards, principles in order to
    have an increased quality factor. Reliability engineering is the concept behind
    these standards. Common criteria plays an important role by assuring consistency
    and error management, these being the basic fundamental features a system must
    have to guarantee it matches the function for which it was designed. 3 Methodology
    Approach for Common Criteria - Lego Methodology Concept The Common Criteria (CC)
    represents an international standard regarding computer security information (ISO/IEC
    15408) [7]. Furthermore, Common Criteria is a framework in which SFRs (Security
    Functional Requirements) and SARs (Security Assurance Requirements) can be foreseen
    in an ST (Security Target) [8]. The CC assessment methods are performed on systems
    and computer security items. The product or the system which represents the subject
    of the evaluation is called Target of Evaluation (TOE). The evaluation has to
    examine if the security requirements are accomplished; this is performed through
    Protection Profile (PP), Security Target (ST) and Security Functional Requirements
    (SFRs) [9]. The PP is a document created most often by the user or by the community
    and its major role is to detect security requirements for a class of security
    devices significant for a specific target. Retailers have the possibility to implement
    items that submit with one or more PPs, but they also can have their products
    evaluated against those PPs. In this particular case, a PP can be considered a
    template for the ST products. ST represents the document that identifies the security
    features of the main goal of the evaluation. The TOE is evaluated against the
    SFRs settled in its ST; this allows the retailers to suit the evaluation in order
    to match with the abilities of their item. SFRs stipulate the functions that can
    be provided by an item. Common Criteria has a specific list consisting of these
    functions, and the list can be different depending on the type of the evaluation
    even if the targets of the evaluation are the same type [10]. The evaluation procedure
    makes an attempt in the process of determining the degree of reliability of the
    product’s security characteristics by quality assurance procedures, represented
    by SARs and Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL). SARs represent depictions of the
    actions carried out through the product`s evolution and evaluation to provide
    the supposed security functionality. The requirements from the CC catalog are
    documented in PP and ST. EAL is the numerical evaluation which describes the depth
    and the harshness of an evaluation. Each EAL is correlated with a package of SARs
    which includes the full development of an item. Common Criteria stipulates 7 levels
    of EAL, EAL1 being the most fundamental with low costs, while EAL7 is the most
    rigorous and the most expensive. Higher EAL does not suppose a more precise security,
    it only intends to assure that the TOE has been verified with higher accuracy
    [11]. 3.1 Lego Methodology Concept The ‘Lego methodology’ was developed to resolve
    the limitations introduced by the current composition approaches and concentrates
    on the evaluation of a list set in advance of Security Functions (SF) necessary
    in a use-case already existent [12]. This solution allows a global and unique
    Evaluation level (EAL LEGO) of the composite Platform with different robustness
    levels (Vulnerability ANalysis (VAN)-HIGH, VAN-Moderate, VAN-LOW) among security
    functions within the Platform (see Fig. 1). Fig. 1. Evaluation under current CC
    approaches vs. evaluation under Lego methodology approach Full size image This
    methodology permits the selection of certain security functions related to a use
    case, the integration of different evaluated and non-evaluated parts, the installation
    and utilization of new components, and the execution of additional tests to demonstrate
    an increased robustness level of the security functions. This methodology leads
    to the following benefits: Evaluation with decreased effort, time and at low cost
    by reducing the perimeter of the evaluation, making the evaluation of the platform
    fast and easy; Dynamic plug-and-play integration by updating, adding, removing
    or replacing a Component with less effort; Possibility of obtain different robustness
    levels and increasing the level of robustness of required security functions within
    the system; The following roles are considered in the Lego methodology: Component
    Developer: Entity developing the Component; it might also be the sponsor of the
    Component evaluation; Component Evaluator: Entity performing the Component evaluation;
    Component Certification Body: Entity performing the Component certification; Composite
    Platform Integrator: Entity integrating the Components in the Platform; it might
    also be the sponsor of the Composite Platform evaluation; Composite Platform Evaluator:
    Entity performing the composite Platform evaluation; Composite Platform Certification
    Body: Entity performing the composite Platform certification; Composite Product
    Evaluation Sponsor: Entity in charge of contracting the composite product evaluation.
    In the concept of Lego Methodology, several suppositions are taken into consideration,
    such as: each Component is certified and completely specified, the objectives
    required by the working environment of each Component are well-defined, the Integrator
    should know the components functionality, the Platform has a fixed number of components
    in order to be certified, etc. The described Lego methodology can be employed
    for demonstrating the compositional evaluation within a platform designed for
    security through isolation, called ODSI (On Demand Secure Isolation) [13]. The
    ODSI Platform combines the following independent certified components with different
    security levels (see Fig. 2): Fig. 2. The architecture behind the Network Manager,
    Keyring Manager and Administration Manager interaction Full size image (a) Configuration
    Manager: Certified Component was providing the Isolation security function (SF-ISO)
    between memory partitions. It is the base component on which the security of SFs
    DISP, AUTH, COMM and KEYM is built; (b) Administration Manager: Certified Component
    providing the Dispatch security function (SF-DISP) of commands between partitions;
    (c) Network Manager: Certified Component providing the Authentication (SF-AUTH)
    and the Communication (SF-COMM) security functions; (d) Keyring Manager: Certified
    Component providing the key storage security function (SF-KEYM). 4 Scenarios of
    Implementation In this section, there will be presented two scenarios of implementation,
    one being more of a general overview of the Lego methodology approach on increasing
    the robustness level of a SF within the CC Component and the other presenting
    the Agro-Telemetry use case that utilizes the CC compliant ODSI platform. 4.1
    Scenario 1 - Increase the Robustness Level of a Given SF Within the Component
    In this scenario, the re-evaluation effort will focus on testing that the SF1
    can resist at a security level higher than VAN.3 and that no other part of the
    Component A1 can affect or decrease this security level. A. Actors The following
    Actors are considered in this scenario: Same Evaluator of the Component A1 and
    the SF1; Component Developer; Product Evaluation Sponsor: This actor may be the
    Component Developer. B. Assumptions The following assumptions are considered for
    the evaluation under this scenario: Component A1 is CC-certified; The re-evaluation
    of SF1 and the evaluation of A1 will both be conducted by the same evaluation
    facility. The benefits of this assumption are the following: a full evaluation
    of the Component A1 conducted by the new evaluation facility is not required;
    delivery of all evaluation evidences (documents, source code, samples) to the
    new evaluation facility is not required; the base evaluation results can be reused.
    The source code of the Component A1 is identical between the base certification
    and the reevaluation of SF1. C. Inputs and Required Evidences The following inputs
    are required prior to the evaluation under this scenario: ST, TDS (Target-of-Evaluation
    Design), FSP (Functional SPecification), ATE (Assurance TEsts) of the Component;
    SFRs that fulfill the SF1 are clearly identified and the rationale is provided
    in the Security Target; The SF1-Interfaces and Modules that implement the SF1
    are described in the TDS and FSP Documents; Interactions between SF1-Interfaces
    and the other interfaces of the Components A1 are described in the TDS (TOE Design)
    document; SF1-Interfaces and Interactions are tested, and the conducted tests
    are described in the ATE Document. D. Additional Requirements during Re-evaluation
    The goal of the Lego certification within this scenario may be achieved by the
    following means: Requirements to be fulfilled by the Component Developer or the
    Product Evaluation Sponsor: Additional information of each SF1-Interfaces may
    be required. This information will provide the evaluator with a better understanding
    of how this security function is performed. These additional details of SF1-Interfaces
    can be included in the TDS and the FSP documentation if the SF1-Interface is an
    external one (TSFI); Additional information of the interactions between SF1-Interfaces
    and the other interfaces of the Component A1 may be required. This information
    will provide the evaluator a better understanding of how the SF1 interacts with
    the other parts of the component. These additional details about interactions
    can be included in the TDS; The evaluator may require a characterization of the
    SF1-Interfaces at the implementation level (e.g. description of parameters passed
    from a SF1-Interface to another, variables, data identified for this SF1-Interface
    that are going to be used by other interfaces, return values from those interfaces,
    etc.). Such complete characterizations of SF1-Interfaces are meant to allow their
    exercise during reviewing and testing. These additional details can be included
    in the TDS and the FSP documentation if the SF1-Interface is an external one (TSFI);
    Since they play no role in testing, it is not mandatory to describe at an implementation
    level the SF1-Interfaces that have no interaction with the other interfaces of
    the component; Additional functional depth tests by the developer may be required
    to determine if all SF1-Interfaces and Interactions are completely tested. These
    additional tests can be provided in ATE. Requirements to be addressed by the Evaluator:
    Compliance analysis of the updated evidences; Additional penetration and/or independent
    tests by the evaluator may be conducted to determine if the SF1 is resistant at
    a level higher than VAN.3. 4.2 Scenario 2 – Agro-Telemetry System In this scenario,
    it is presented the implemented Agro-Telemetry System. This system is used for
    precision agriculture and has two functions: data acquirement and data transmission
    along with processing. The first function allows sensors to collect data on temperature,
    humidity sunlight and actuators to execute commands in order to activate mechanic
    systems, such as irrigating. The data transmission and processing function illustrate
    the technique of sensor data transportation from the gateway to server; information
    is processed by the server and is presented to users through Web interface. This
    use-case handles two types of data: business and security data. Business data
    consists of raw information collected from sensors, representing the processed
    data produced by the server, while security data is residing on user credentials,
    log data, system configuration (see Fig. 3). Fig. 3. Agro-Telemetry system Full
    size image Table 1 concretizes the impacts of feared events. Table 1. Impacts
    of all feared events Full size table Regarding the threats analysis, there will
    be described some examples of contra measures to each threat that relates to a
    feared event. When alteration of Business data is involved, a man-in-the-middle
    attack may interfere on the network. As a contra measure, a deployment of an ODSI
    token verification service for user authentication will be performed. This action
    is provided by the Network Manager whose Certified Component supplies the Authentication
    (SF-AUTH) and the Communication (SF-COMM) security functions. Disclosure of Security
    data implies threats on the gateway such as the side-channel attack which can
    be prevented by deploying a technique called ODSI end-to-end encryption that embodies
    the Certified Component of the Administration Manager which provides the Dispatch
    security function (SF-DISP) of commands between partitions. Considering the unavailability
    of the Data Processing function, a possible threat accomplished on the server
    is the Denial of Service (DOS) attack which can be countered when an ODSI isolation
    BIP technique is deployed on the server through the Configuration Manager’s Certified
    Component which provides the Isolation security function (SF-ISO) between memory
    partitions. 5 Conclusions As shown in this paper, Lego Methodology offers an encouraging
    and feasible way in order to extend the current CC approach to support and facilitate
    composition and allow the evaluation of IoT platforms. The Lego Methodology applied
    on ODSI platform allows a secure communication with a remote entity, end-to-end
    encryption, key management and secure storage without the limitations brought
    in by the present composition approaches. As future work we envision developing
    an application in a real-world context and perform the compositional evaluation.

    Smart agriculture concept uses innovative solutions including IoT and Cloud storage\
    \ \nfeatures, dedicated sensors for monitoring basic agricultural parameters,\
    \ new \ncommunications protocols, etc. SmartAgro architecture comprises a telemetry\
    \ system for \nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as air & soil temperature,\
    \ air & soil relative \nhumidity, leaf wetness, etc. The current paper outlines\
    \ the reliability of the implemented \nsystem by comparing and analyzing data\
    \ collected in spring 2019 and spring 2020. The \nrelevance of this season consists\
    \ in great air variations due to the transition from winter to \nsummer. Being\
    \ monitored in a vine area near Bucharest, these data may be useful for \ndifferent\
    \ statistics related to grapes culture in this season and can be used by interested\
    \ \nparties for future predictions related to vine crops. Moreover, in this paper,\
    \ data fusion will \nallow advanced data management and coherence achievement\
    \ among collected data.  \nKeywords:  \nPrecision Agriculture \nData Fusion \n\
    Reliability \nSensors \n \n \n \n1. Introduction  \nThis paper is an extension\
    \ of work originally presented in \nSIITME’19 conference [1]. In [1] the authors\
    \ presented the \ntelemetry system with its main advantages consisting in solar\
    \ panel \nsupply and data reliability. The current work extends the \ndemonstration\
    \ of the system’s reliability by processing data from \nSpring 2019 and Spring\
    \ 2020. In addition to the previous work, \ndata fusion will be used to fill the\
    \ gaps between the recorded data \nand to ensure a proper system’s management.\
    \ \nConsidering all climate changes, the evolution of the \nagriculture plays\
    \ an important role in the lives and well-being of \npeople, since it represents\
    \ a source of food for population and, \nrespectively for domestic animals. Climate\
    \ change influences \nagriculture in different ways. Changes in temperature and\
    \ \nprecipitation are already affecting crop yields [2]. Consequently, \npeople\
    \ must adapt to and implicitly adjust the solutions used to \nensure food or water\
    \ quality, for irrigation and daily use [3]. The \nhealth of soils and crop, also,\
    \ is very important, as it affects the \nquality and quantity of agricultural\
    \ crops [4, 5]. \nWhen required to evaluate successful analysed crops, the key\
    \ \nperformance indicators (KPIs) must be considered since they are \nquantitative,\
    \ practical, directional, and actionable. Depending on \nthe analysed corps, KPIs\
    \ differ. For example, based on KPIs crop \nusage can be tracked to evaluate the\
    \ production and to monitor the \noverall costs. The most significant impacts\
    \ of KPIs on agriculture \nare increased productivity, profit and time save [6].\
    \ \nAn important role in the precision agriculture is played by IoT \nplatforms.\
    \ Using them, the quality of the crops can be enhanced by \nreal time data acquisition,\
    \ processing and decision making. These \ndata are converted, thus, in useful\
    \ information for farmers, and, \nalso, in a facile understandable manner [7].\
    \ Capturing, \ntransmitting, storing and processing the volume of information\
    \ \ncollected by sensors connected on the IoT platform, show a \nnumber of challenges,\
    \ in particular, regarding integration \ntechnologies, communications, databases\
    \ and computing. A \nmiddleware platform which alleviates these issues is FIWARE.\
    \ \nFIWARE is a technology supported by the European Commission \nto make possible\
    \ the IoT in the context of the Future Internet [8]. \nSmartFarmNet is an IoT\
    \ platform that automatically collects \ndata from soil, as fertilization and\
    \ irrigation. The data is then \nautomatically correlated, and the invalid data\
    \ is filtered-out from \nthe perspective of assessing crop performance. Also,\
    \ with the help \nof the platform the crop forecasts can be computed, and the\
    \ farmers \nreceive personalized crop recommendations for any farm [9].  \nThere\
    \ are also platforms which are specialised on only one \naspect such as SWAMP.\
    \ Within SWAMP project there was \ndeveloped and assessed an IoT-based smart water\
    \ management \nplatform for precision irrigation in agriculture. The platform\

    \ the platform can deal with the requirements \nand limitations of different countries,\
    \ climate, soils, and crops, \nwhich require flexibility to adapt to a range of\
    \ deployment \nconfigurations involving mixed technologies [10]. \nData fusion\
    \ techniques applied on data collected by different \nsensors used in agricultural\
    \ area allow a better understanding of \nparameters’ evolution and advanced data\
    \ management, especially \nin cases where the data volume is huge [11], [12].\
    \ Yet, the \napplicability domain is not limited only to agriculture, but it can\
    \ \ncomprise different applications that are sensor-based and that \nimply multiple\
    \ data sources. \nThe current paper aims to emphasize the role of the \nimplemented\
    \ SmartAgro telemetry system in ensuring reliable \ndata for further use in statistics\
    \ and specialized predictions. Data \nfusion methods will allow additional processing\
    \ that will offer a \nglobal perspective of the monitored parameters. The paper\
    \ is \norganized as follows: Section 2 presents the related work on data \nfusion\

    \ contains the description of SmartAgro \ntelemetry system and in Section 4 system’s\
    \ setup and relevant \nmonitoring results are presented. Data fusion implications\
    \ are \noutlined in Section 5 and Section 6 comprises Conclusions. \n2. Data Fusion\
    \ for Agricultural Area \nAccording to [13], when acquirred data present high\
    \ and \ndiverse information, data fusion considers the juxtaposition of \nlarge\
    \ set of data to ensure reliable, homogeneously and fair \noverview of the collected\
    \ information. The advantage of data \nfusion of data received from multiple different\
    \ sensors relies in “an \nimproved estimate of physical phenomenon via redundant\
    \ \nobservations” [14]. The efficiency of data fusion was previously \ndemonstrated\
    \ in precision agriculture domain [15-18]. In [15], \nauthors present the benefits\
    \ on crop monitoring of 2D and 3D data \nfusion for a vineyard monitoring and\
    \ use the results in order to \nclassify vines in serveral classes by processing\
    \ data from multiple \nsources (different sensors, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAVs),\
    \ \netc). In 2012, in [16] different data fusion methods were used (e.g. \nmultiple\
    \ linear regression (SMLR), partial least squares regression \n(PLSR) and principal\
    \ components analysis combined with \nstepwise multiple linear regression (PCA+SMLR)\
    \ techniques) to \npredict multiple soil properties. Authors’ conclusions indicate\
    \ that \ndata fusion techniques are more relevant in clayey field and worse \n\
    in sandy field and, in addition, these methods can improve the \nquality of soil\
    \ sensing in precision agriculture if appropriate \nsensors are selected. Later,\
    \ in 2017, sensor data fusion for soil \nhealth assessment was applied in [17]\
    \ and, as a result, faster \ndetermination of soil health was achieved by merging\
    \ data \ngathered from all sensors. In a more advanced manner, in [18] \nsensing\
    \ data fusion methods are involved in crop detection. \nAuthors use an efficient\
    \  method  of fusing multi-source remote \nsensing images with a convolution neural\
    \ networks (CNN) for  \nsemantic  segmentation to identify crops (93% succesful\
    \ rate) in \ndetecting and identifying crops. \nIn this paper we use data fusion\
    \ technique on agricultural KPIs \nto fill the gaps and to create a complete picture\
    \ of their variation \neven in the absence of their recording by the telemetry\
    \ system. \n3. ADCON-based Architecture of Telemetry System \nMonitoring of KPIs\
    \ (such as air and soil temperature, crop \nstate, air and soil relative humidity)\
    \ for a vine located in a \nresidential area close to Bucharest was performed\
    \ using an \nADCON-based telemetry system (called SmartAgro). The selected \n\
    season was spring since it is a season in which high variations may \nbe observed\
    \ because of the transition from winter to summer (two \nseasons with extreme\
    \ temperatures). Figure 1 illustrates the new \nconcept of SmartAgro telemetry\
    \ system in which different \ndedicated agricultural sensors are interconnected\
    \ for main \nparameter’s monitoring.  \nFigure 1: SmartAgro innovative architecture\
    \ [19] \nThe data acquired from the agricultural sensors were \ncentralized into\
    \ a database and were used to highlight the impact \nof measured parameters on\
    \ crops [19]. The architecture differs \nfrom the traditional ones by introducing\
    \ two new levels consisting \nin: The Edge level: at this level telemetry data\

    \ results \nTo demonstrate the reliability of the system, extended \nmonitoring\
    \ results are presented. The measurements were \nperformed in 2019 and 2020 and\
    \ the data were acquired each 6 \nhours per day, starting with 8 a.m. \n4.1. Air\
    \ temperature monitoring  \n \nFigure 2 illustrates the variation of air temperature\
    \ during \nSpring of 2019 and 2020. \n \n \nFigure 2: Air temperature variation\
    \ in Spring 2019 (up), Spring 2020 (down) \n \nBased on results in Figure 2, it\
    \ can be seen the patterns of the \nday-night air temperature variation, also\
    \ called Day/Night \nDifferential (DIF). Higher temperature peaks can be observed\
    \ in \nFigure 3. DIF value has multiple significances: firstly, DIF values \n\
    were related to plant growth. Moreover, values of DIF around 8°C \nwere proved\
    \ to provide the best plant growth, whereas DIF values \nbetween 12°C and 22°C\
    \ showed a low correlation to the predicted \nresults in [20] for Chrysanthemum.\
    \  \n \nFrom the air temperature data provided by SmartAgro platform \nin the\
    \ two seasons (Spring 2019 and Spring 2020), we can state \nthat in Spring 2019\
    \ the plant growing should have been more \npronounced, as the DIF was lower than\
    \ 12°C. \n \n \nFigure 3: Soil temperature variation in Spring 2019 (up), Spring\
    \ 2020 (down) \n4.2. Soil temperature monitoring  \n \nFrom Figure 3, which outline\

    \ of a temperature offset of -5°C for both Spring 2019 and \nfor Spring 2020.\
    \  \n4.3. Relative air humidity monitoring  \n \nFrom Figure 4, which depicts\
    \ the variation of relative air \nhumidity for Spring 2019 and Spring 2020, it\
    \ can be observed that \nthe supersaturation phenomenon was similarly frequent\
    \ in both \nyears. This is related to the prediction of the rainfall and appears\
    \ \nwhen the air humidity reaches 100%.  \n \n \nFigure 4: Relative air humidity\

    \ graphical representations did not reveal the \nabsence of some data or the heterogeneity\
    \ of the data. For example, \nfrom the previous graphs there cannot be noticed\
    \ the absence of \nthe samples for certain moments of the day or even the fact\
    \ that \nthe samples were not acquired at the same moment every day. \nMoreover,\
    \ the data were not acquired each day. \nThe time intervals for data collection\
    \ are March 4th, 2019 and \nMay 31st, 2019 (Spring 2019) and March 1st, 2020 and\
    \ May 28th, \n2020 (Spring 2020), respectively. Analysing data of a real \nacquisition,\
    \ it can be remarked that the samples were collected at \nthe time moments given\
    \ in Table 1. \nTable 1: Classification of the samples based on the moment of\
    \ acquisition \nHours (0-\n24) \nNo. of \nDays \n(ND) \nND \n(2019) \nND \n(2020)\

    \ issues \nconcerning the predictions and forecasts or the decisions taken by\
    \ \nthe support decision systems integrated in the overall architecture. \nNevertheless,\
    \ sensor data fusion techniques can bring many \nbenefits such that the faults\
    \ triggered by the data gaps can be \nmitigated. For exemplification, two variables\
    \ are considered: air \ntemperature and soil temperature. They were chosen after\
    \ the \nanalysis of the samples acquired because the vectors storing their \n\
    values comprise NaN values, that is, there are missing samples in \nair temperature\
    \ and soil temperature data because of system \nfailures. \nIn Figure 7, it is\
    \ illustrated the graphical representation of the \nair temperature variation\
    \ at 3 a.m. and 2 a.m. for each of the days \nin which the data were collected,\
    \ more precisely, in the intervals \nMarch 4th, 2019 and May 31st, 2019 (88 days)\
    \ and March 1st, 2020 \nand May 28th, 2020 (88 days). Figure 7 highlights small,\
    \ but \nimportant, data gaps. \n \nFigure 7: Air temperature measured at 2am and\
    \ 3am in Spring 2019  \nand Spring 2020 \nIn Figure 8, it is highlighted the soil\
    \ temperature variation \nduring the same seasons, and it can be noticed that\
    \ also soil \ntemperature data is missing. In addition, as previously mentioned,\
    \ \nthe soil temperature follows the same variation pattern as in the \ncase of\
    \ air temperature and, by computing the difference between \nair and soil temperature,\
    \ a constant value of 5°C is determined. \nTherefore, finding a method to determine\
    \ an approximate value \nfor air temperature will also succeed in determining\
    \ the \napproximate value for soil temperature, too, and vice versa. \n \nFigure\
    \ 8: Soil temperature measured at 2am and 3am in Spring 2019 \nand Spring 2020\
    \ \nFurther, the choice of soil temperature and air temperature \nvariables will\
    \ be justified with respect to the variation of the other \nparameters. Analyzing\
    \ the graphical representation of air relative \nhumidity (Figure 9), soil humidity\
    \ (Figure 10) and leaf wetness \n(Figure 11) variations, missing data can be also\
    \ observed (samples \nmissing before and after March 13, 2019), but the data gaps\
    \ are \naffecting all variables. The only variables that experience isolated \n\
    data gaps when all the other parameters are represented are soil \ntemperature\
    \ and air temperature. \nIn Figure 9, air relative humidity variation for the\
    \ same moment \nof day for Spring 2019 and Spring 2020 is represented. It can\
    \ be \nobserved that the minimum air relative humidity recorded in \nSpring 2019,\
    \ at 2 a.m., is 37.78 % and it was recorded on March \n24th, 2019, while the maximum\
    \ value of 100% was reached 7 \ntimes (March 11-12, 2019; March 15, 2019; April\
    \ 11th-12,2019; \nMay 11th-12,2019).   \nRegarding the air relative humidity measured\
    \ at 3 a.m., in \nSpring 2019, the minimum value was 55.74% on March 9th, 2019,\
    \ \nI. Marcu et al. / Advances in Science, Technology and Engineering Systems\

    \ the maximum value (100%) was reached 10 times (10% in \nMarch, 40% in April,\
    \ 50% in May). \n \nFigure 9: Air relative humidity measured at 2am and 3am in\
    \ Spring 2019 and \nSpring 2020 \nIn Spring 2020, the minimum value of the air\
    \ relative humidity \nmeasured at 2 am was 47.45% on March 16, 2020, whereas the\
    \ \nmaximum value (100%) recorded at 2 a.m. was reached 10 times \n(40% in March,\
    \ 30% in April and 30% in May). \nConcerning the samples acquired at 3 a.m. in\
    \ Spring 2020, the \nminimum value of air relative humidity was recorded on \n\
    13.04.2020 (48.57%), whereas the maximum value of 100% was \nreached 9 times (22.2\
    \ % in March, 11.1% in April and 66.7% in \nMay). \nComputing the difference between\
    \ soil humidity and air \nhumidity, a constant difference of 15% is achieved and\
    \ it can be \nseen that the variations patterns are identical (Figure 10). This\
    \ can \nbe proven also by computing the standard deviation (SD) for each \nseason\
    \ for the two possible time moments of acquisition (2 a.m. \nand 3 a.m.) for both\
    \ variables. For both soil and air humidity \nvariables, the values of the standard\
    \ deviation coincide and are \ngiven in Table 2. \nTable 2:  Standard deviation\

    \ \nAgriculture is an on-going evolving domain since worldwide \nsurvival depends\
    \ in on it a great manner. Telemetry systems \ndeveloped for crop and field monitoring\
    \ (such as SmartAgro) play \nimportant roles in providing crucial KPIs related\
    \ to air & soil \ntemperature and/or air & soil humidity, as well as crop diseases\
    \ \ndetection. The architecture of the implemented SmartAgro system \nis highlighted\
    \ by two relevant levels: The Edge level and the \nLocal Storage level. They enable\
    \ data classification and use \nparameters improvement in various cases such as\
    \ alert scenarios \nand for applications. on-field, off-line. \n Being equipped\
    \ with multiple different, SmartAgro provides \nmassive quantity of data for the\
    \ monitored parameters. In this \npaper, the reliability of the recorded data\
    \ provided by the \ntelemetry system is outlined by performing measurements in\
    \ 2 \nconsecutive years (2019 and 2020) with a frequency of 6h/ day. \nBased on\
    \ the collected data related to the air temperature in \nSpring 2019 and Spring\
    \ 2020, it can be noticed that Spring 2019 \nwas a more favourable season for\
    \ plant growing since the DIF was \nlower than 12°C. The variation of soil temperature\
    \ led to the \nobservation that the patterns are identical with their correspondent\
    \ \nair temperature data in both seasons (Spring 2019 and Spring \n2020). Further,\
    \ by recording data on relative soil humidity and \nleaf wetness there was observed\
    \ that there is no evidence of \ncorrelation between the monitored parameters.\
    \ Yet, the \nsimilarities in variations during Spring 2019 and Spring 2020 \n\
    demonstrates the reliability of the data recorded using SmartAgro \ntelemetry\
    \ system. \nSince it was noticed that the monitored parameters have not \nbeen\
    \ collected at the same moment in time with regularity, data \nfusion technique\
    \ was used to fill the gaps and to provide a global \noverview on the behaviour\
    \ of the system. Two KPIs have been \nconsidered: air temperature and soil temperature.\
    \ Using data \nfusion, it was proven that: \n- \nBy finding a method to determine\
    \ an approximate value for \nair temperature will also succeed in determining\
    \ the \napproximate value for soil temperature, too, and vice versa. \n- \nBy\
    \ finding the approximate value of the air relative humidity, \nthe approximate\
    \ value of the soil humidity can also be \ndetermined. \nAs conclusion, the goals\
    \ of data fusion referring to advanced \ndata management and coherence achievement\
    \ among collected \ndata were achieved within this research. \n \nConflict of\

    wireless sensor network system shows a data analysis approach within greenhouses
    in short cycle crops. This research, on the one hand, is carried out to reduce
    water consumption and improve the product by predicting the right moment of the
    irrigation cycle through the evapotranspiration criterion. On the other hand,
    an efficient electronic system is designed under the electronic standard. To define
    the best model to define the next irrigation in the crops in base to ground humidity,
    the algorithms are compared for continuous and discontinuous multivariate regressions.
    The results are evaluated with different criteria of prediction errors. As a result,
    the linear regression with Support Vector Machine model is chosen for counting
    an average deviation error of 7.89% and an error variability of 4.48%. In addition,

    SECTION I. Introduction Agricultural production is one of the pillars of rural
    development and food security worldwide. Some of the most important agricultural
    productions are cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower. For instance, approximately
    70 million tons of cabbage are produced every year worldwide covering an area
    of 3.8 million of acres in almost 150 countries. China and India are the main
    producers with 8.9 and 7.7 million of tons per year respectively which represents
    the 74% of global production [9] . Additionally, 20 millions of tons of broccoli
    and cauliflower are produced in an area of 1.6 million of acres worldwide. Due
    to population growing and changes in diet customs, production of vegetables has
    increased in 20% in the last five years. According this, global imports of vegetables
    in 2014 were around 29,500 million of dollars which represents 3.6 % of global
    production using a price of 0.67 USD per kg [4] . The demand of water supply for
    agriculture and livestock is increasing according population and economic growth
    worldwide; in fact, water consume represents the 70% of total consume and in some
    cases, like developed countries, this consume reaches up to 95%. This tendency
    is also influenced by the constant growing of food demand which will cause that
    to satisfy these global requirements, more water is needed every year [5] . In
    order to reduce water consumption and improve the quality of production, in early
    90s the precision agriculture system was developed as a promising technique and
    it was applied in several countries. At the beginning, the efficiency of the technique
    depended of the knowledge and technology available at that time; however, years
    later, the precision agriculture was combined with techniques used in process
    automation. This approach allowed to use electronics to collect, process, and
    analyze several data simultaneously for decision making [12] . The most common
    electronic systems used in greenhouses are the wireless sensor networks (WSN)
    which can be defined as an electronic system composed of memory blocks, data input/output
    blocks, communication ports, and a battery. For this reason, a WSN is mainly used
    for data acquisition in environments where traditional systems are inefficient
    or costly. Moreover, an advantage of a WSN is the integration of several sensors
    which work together and allow the conversion from physical signals to electrical
    ones that can be sent to a remote destiny, like a server, making use of protocols
    and wireless technologies. A WSN has still several challenges in both hardware
    and software to overcome; for instance, in greenhouses these challenges are focus
    on data confidentiality, sensors reliability, storage capacity, and availability
    [6] . Additionally, from hardware point of view there are challenges such as electrical
    cost, execution time, code size, battery time-life, and sensor calibration. In
    order to define whether a system is efficient or not, several authors have proposed
    a well-defined design process for an embedded system which follow (i) a functional
    specification, (ii) set of properties that the design must satisfy, (iii) define
    requirements for design evaluation, (iv) and define to analyze the performance
    of the embedded system. Due to the use of water for traditional irrigation represents
    a high impact for water consumption worldwide, precision irrigation provides a
    mean to evaluate water requirements of a crop and supply the right amount of water
    in the right time without wasting a single drop of water. Precision irrigation
    is the most efficient technique for greenhouses irrigation where saving of money
    and resources is more than mandatory; therefore, the use of WSN is very important
    for monitoring all the tasks conducted in a greenhouse. For this reason, it is
    significant to take into account the location, amount, and deployment of sensors
    to minimize the errors and maximize the quality of data. Since a WSN plays an
    important role in the cultivation of vegetables, this article presents a design
    of a WSN taking into account the following aspects. First, data collection of
    the most relevant variables related to vegetables cultivation. Second, correlation
    analysis of data to determine their relation with soil humidity and therefore
    estimating the amount of water that a crop may need in the next irrigation. The
    rest of the document is organized as follow. Section II shows the design requirements
    for data acquisition and greenhouse features. section III talks about the propose
    methodology to minimize problems such as reading errors or redundancy. Section
    IV explains and performs different analysis using different techniques of machine
    learning to data representation. Section V sums up the results of the research
    and their interpretation. Finally, section VI presents conclusions and future
    work. SECTION II. Materials and Methods This sections shows the following: (i)
    data acquisition vegetable production of greenhouse, (ii) design of an electronic
    system to collect the generated data by the sensor network, and (iii) data analysis.
    A. Greenhouse Crops Data Acquisition Current agricultural production depends on
    the efficiency of electronic systems used to control and monitor several variables
    in a greenhouse [1] . To get a better final product in short-cycle productions,
    less than one year, smart greenhouses are used to control the different environmental
    variables involved in this activity. In this work, we take into account the evapotranspiration
    criterion ( ET c ) which can be defined as the vaporization of liquid water contained
    in tissue of plants. In addition to, the evapotranspiration of reference ( ET
    o ) works as a baseline index for suitable condition of plants growing under a
    correct water irrigation level. Moreover, crop coefficient ( K c ) using the equation
    1 [2] . That means the difference between the production in a greenhouse and the
    production in an ideal environment. By this way, it is possible to know the relation
    between growth stages and maturation of a crop. del mismo [3] . K c = (E T o )
    (E T c ) (1) View Source In a greenhouse, the parameters to evaluate in this study
    are soil moisture, relative humidity, air temperature, amount of ( CO 2 ), and
    luminosity. Additionally, both ( K c )and ( ET o ) are parameters related to the
    water irrigated amount to a crop. Short cycle crops are those crops whose vegetative
    cycle is less than a year, even of only a few months. For this reason, they can
    be planted immediately after they are harvested. Some of these crops are cereals
    (corn, wheat, barley, rice), tubers (potatoes), oil seeds (sesame and cotton),
    vegetables (tomatoes, onions, broccoli, carrots, beets) and some species of flowers
    open sky. [8] Indicates that an optimal strategy is the rotation of short cycle
    crops. The same ones that can be (i) gramineous plants that demand much of the
    soil and (ii) legume plants that contribute nitrogen to the soil through the fixation
    of nitrogen in the air. In the rotation of crops the crops of the two groups alternate,
    thus after a crop that demands a lot of soil, we sow another one that will provide
    nutrients. The most significant parameters for short cycle crops are:soil moisture,
    relative humidity, ambient temperature, amount of CO 2 and luminosity [4] . B.
    Electronic Design Fig. 1 Greenhouse measures Show All To guarantee quality in
    the design electronic system process, we use the V model. It has well-defined
    stages which allows the designers to get a feedback in each of them. Additionally,
    using the IEEE 29148 standard, requirements can be obtained easier, they will
    be focus in the problem, and they can be validated without drawbacks, the stages
    are: Analysis: This is the very first stage which involves the verification of
    the greenhouse dimensions and the kind of crop. For the former, they are 19 ×
    17 × 4 meters and it is shown in Fig. 1 . For the latter, crops are lettuce, beetroot,
    and green cabbage which belong to the short cycle production and have similar
    irrigation needs. Requirements: It allows to identify the functionality and constrains
    that the system must have in order to it can operate correctly. The most relevant
    requirements are shown in table I . Design: Due to there are a huge variety of
    sensors to measure environment variables and the convert them into electrical
    signals, we have selected the sensors whose error is very low, according their
    data-sheet. The electronic sensors list are: DHT11 (Temperature and Humidity Sensor
    complex with a calibrated digital signal output), BH1750 (Digital sensor that
    measures brightness, 16 bits CAD), MQ135 (Allows air quality control), YL69 (moisture
    sensor), Xbee (802.15.4 IEEE standard), Arduino (Microncontroller with 14 in/out
    pin and 6 analog conversors) TABLE I System Requeiremts Once electronics have
    been selected, we have to define the interconnection between microcontroller,
    sensors, and actuators. We use the 802.15.1 standard to send the information from
    the WSN to the management server due to this standard offers several advantages
    such as relative long-range coverage, high data reliability, and high data rate.
    At figure 2 details the electronic circuit designed [13] . To cover all the space
    inside the greenhouse, 3 nodes of WSN with the same kind of sensors are used and
    data collected here is sent to a main server three times per day, morning, afternoon,
    and night. Fig. 2 WSN Electronic Desing Show All C. Data Analysis The multidimensional
    matrix collected is Y ∈ ℝ (m×n) , where m = 1200 and n = 8. In the matrix, the
    last 3 columns represents the mechanism used for irrigation, i.e. hose, drip,
    or groove. With the purpose of avoid the dummy variable trap, we delete one of
    the variables of water irrigation. Moreover, to facilitate the analysis, data
    contained in the matrix is divided in two portions, the 80% for model training
    and the rest for validation of the model. As a result, the dimension of the final
    matrix X ∈ ℝ (p×q) , where p= 936 and q = 7. To use a multivariate regression
    model, it is mandatory first to take into account the correlation between all
    the variables; by this way, the mathematical model will use only the most significant
    variables, soil moisture, and the others will be rejected. In this analysis, we
    use the backward elimination technique for this purpose. At the beginning, this
    technique uses all the training variables and then the less significant ones are
    rejected according the results gotten from a descriptive statistical analysis.
    The feature to analyze and compare is p-value with all the variables included
    in the analysis [7] . Using matrix X . The first model corresponding to equation:
    Y= b 0 + ∑ i=1 7 x i b i (2) View Source Where x 1 =Temperature, x 2 = Relative
    humidity, x 3 = Ligh level, x 4 = C O 2 , x 5 = Ground humidity, x 6 = Drip irrigation
    and x 7 = irrigation by hose. The results of the statistical analysis shows that
    according the p-value, temperature does not have any direct relation with soil
    moisture. This is because temperature inside the greenhouse does not suffer dramatic
    changes by Fig. 3 . Fig. 3 Equation model ( equation 2 ) and statistical summary
    Show All After this first approach, the equation is reduced because of the less
    related variable is deleted as well. This is possible because the p-value shows
    up which of the variables are and are not closely related to the dependent variable.
    Additionally, we can see that R square and R adjusted are not closely to 1 which
    can help us to suppose that data do not follow a normal distribution. The new
    statistical model is showed in Fig. 4 . In order to figure out the data distribution
    and model validation, it is necessary to validate the statistical assumptions
    of linearity, independency, homocedasticity, and the normality of residual data.
    For instance, the independency of the residuals is 0.0949815; however, it should
    be between 1.5 and 2.5. In Fig. 5 shows the homocedasticity and the normality
    of the residuals. As a analysis results, we identify that the multivariate data
    does not represent linearity; for this reason, it is necessary to explore new
    models and criteria to find the most efficient one for this work. This exploration
    has led to identify that dimension reduction technique (DR) is the most suitable
    for data visualization because it allows to have a better perception and understanding
    of the proposed approaches [10] [11] . In Fig. 6 we see that a portion of data
    is out of the normal range (Q1 Q3 quartiles), so they can be considered as atypical.
    Fig. 4 Equation model statistical summary without Temperature variable Show All
    Fig. 5 Linearity assumptions Show All With the analysis previously described,
    the atypical data could be eliminated (data outside the interquartile range).
    Subsequently, the linear multivariate model is generated again with the training
    matrix V ∈ ℝ (r×q) where r is less than p with 835. At the figure 7 swith a value
    of 835. The figure 7 shows the new model presented with the eliminated out layers
    and the box plot without errors. According to this analysis, it was possible to
    remove atypical data. With this new information, the multivariate linear model
    is used again with a training matrix V ∈ ℝ (r×q) where r is less than p and it
    worth 835. In 7 details the result of the new analysis using the new model. The
    new results states that the new model used is not perfectly suitable for this
    study because the data obtained do not have linearity. For this reason, we propose
    the following regression models to solve the original problem: (i) Regresion polinomial
    y= b 0 + ∑ i=1 4 ∑ j=1 7 ( b j ∗ x i j ) (3) View Source Fig. 6 Data outlayers

    (iii) Decision support machines f(x,ω)= ∑ j=1 m ω j g j (x)+b,where, g j (x),j=1,..,m.
    (5) View Source SECTION III. Results The software used for data analysis is software
    R and it was chosen because it offers representation of (i) nonlinear continuous
    models and (ii) non-continuous models. The standard configuration of the models
    has not been modified to do not infer in the preference to choose any of them.
    Algorithms were drawn using DR to offer a better visualization and the results
    appears in Fig. 8 using matrix V . Fig. 8 Regression Models with WSN data set
    Show All Once models have been implemented, a simulation gives the forecast error
    which allows to figure out which model represents better the data distribution.
    For this reason it is analyzed first the cumulative sum of forecast errors (CFE)
    which provides additional information such as the forecast deviation. Second,
    mean error deviation (MAD) which gives the absolute value of the difference between
    real and estimated data. Third, mean square error (MSE) which gives the dispersion
    of the predicted error. Finally, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) which provides
    the error in percentage given by the model and related to the real data. Additionally,
    to know the precision of the results given by each model, the most precise and
    the less precise predicted result is showed. Table 3 offers a summary of these
    results. TABLE II Error analysis by each model Analyzing the results SVR has an
    error of 7.12% which can be considered as acceptable. Another very important factor
    to take into account is that the variability of the error versus real data is
    30.499 which is measured in a scale from 0 to 1023. This confirms that SVR is
    so robust for atypical data. As result, we state that SVR has better predictions
    compared to other models. For this reason, we try improve its performance modifying
    certain parameters in the equation in order to the model becomes interactive.
    The Fig. 9 presents both the estimated model with standard values and the model
    with the modification of C-constant attribute. Fig. 9 SVR Regression Models with
    WSN data set Show All As final results, in the regression SVR standard we got
    a MAD of 31.6% between 0 to 1023 and a MAPE of 7.89%. On the other hand, with
    SVR modified we got a MAD of 23.08 in the same range of variability and a 4.48%
    of estimated error. This analysis clearly states that the prediction SVR modified
    offers a better performance in the system and for the crop coefficient ( K c ).
    Fig. 10 Comparison between WSN analysis and without them in lettuce growing Show
    All Performing tests with specialized equipment and under the supervision of experienced
    agronomists, we determine that for the proper growth of plants, soil moisture
    in analog values should range from 400 to 520; therefore, when this value drops
    to 400 or less, the electronic system must turn on the irrigation system until
    the soil moisture becomes 520. To try the system, we performed two tests one with
    a WSN with a prediction system and the other with systematic irrigation without
    any feedback. The crop chosen for this purpose was lettuce due to it requires
    a lot of water for a proper growth. As a remarkable result, the growth of the
    plants was totally different; indeed, the most relevant differences were the color,
    the quality of the product, and the amount of water used in each scenario (4 liters
    for the former and 5 liters for the latter). It shows in Fig. 10 to notice the
    difference. SECTION IV. Conclusions and Future work The use of a WSN for prediction
    purposes allows farmers to control their crops more efficiently. By this way,
    products have a better growth cycle due to plants are irrigated when they really
    need and using the proper amount of water for that. In South America where the
    use of technology in agriculture is still very limited, WSN finds a great chance
    to be implemented. Additionally, the regression model SVR enabled to estimate
    the soil moisture with high precision and low computational cost for the local
    server; in fact, with an error of 5% for the former. Moreover, the error prediction
    analysis allowed to figure out what was the best model that offered the best interpretation
    for data distribution. Finally, using DR for graph representation give us a better
    understanding of how different models used to predict data. In the near future,
    these algorithms should be implemented in every single node to improve the communication
    in terms of data rate from sensors to a main node. Furthermore, it is plausible
    that the main node has connection to the cloud to save data and get them from
    everywhere. Finally, we hope to develop a new system that allows to determine
    the water evotranspiration in real time to validate the linear regression model.

  explanation: The study is about an IoT system that allows farmers to map soil properties
    and create management zones in real-time which enhances irrigation management.
    The main objective of the system is to provide farmers with a user-friendly interface
    to input data and receive real-time feedback on the status of their crops. The
    system was validated using data from a field study conducted in Egypt, and the
    results showed that it could accurately identify management zones and provide
    timely irrigation recommendations.
  extract_1: An IoT-based system for real-time irrigation management can be interpreted
    as a software system that integrates IoT and machine learning technologies to
    collect data from sensors deployed in the field, analyze the data to determine
    the appropriate irrigation schedule, and control the irrigation system accordingly.
  extract_2: The system can be validated by comparing its performance to the performance
    of a traditional irrigation system. The comparison can be done in terms of crop
    yield, water use, and energy consumption.

    A case study of a real‑time internet \nof things system for site‑specific \npotato\
    \ crop management \nin El‑Salhia Area‑Egypt\nBasma M. Mohammad EL‑Basioni1*, Elsayed\
    \ Said Mohamed2, AA. Belal2, \nMohamed E. M. Jalhoum2, Sherine M. Abd EL‑Kader1\
    \ & Mohamed B. Zahran2\nThe site‑specific management is the technology that considers\
    \ the natural variability within the \nsame field of factors related to crop growth\
    \ to improve its management practices such that \nthe agricultural treatments\
    \ are varied for field’s small production zones saving resources and \nenvironment,\
    \ and improving crop quality and size. Since site‑specific decisions are not far\
    \ from \nthe Fourth Industrial Revolution and the concept of processes automation,\
    \ this work addresses \nimproving the process of spatial variability analysis\
    \ and thus supporting management decisions \nby developing a system—entitled EGYPADS—based\
    \ on the Internet of Things and its enabling \ntechnologies. EGYPADS automates\
    \ data collection, zones delineation according to their land \nsuitability evaluation,\
    \ and maps generation. The paper addresses a case study of potato crop \nin a\
    \ specific area in Egypt, El‑Salhia, in which eighty‑five sites were chosen as\
    \ main dataset for \nthe modeling process during different stages of crop growth.\
    \ Three management zones were \nrecognized of the selected field based on the\
    \ differentiation in their land suitability characteristics, \nrepresenting about\
    \ 5%, 65%, and 30% of the total area, respectively. The structure, screens, and\
    \ \nservices of EGYPADS are described in this paper. EGYPADS offered services\
    \ include: management \nzones delineation using absolute and virtual coordinates,\
    \ Land Suitability Assessment (LSA), data \nentry from field in real‑time as well\
    \ as from excel sheets, saving maps in suitable format for variable \nrate application,\
    \ real‑time and historical data processing, centralized management, and flexible\
    \ \nformulation of events and related actions. The implementation of EGYPADS was\
    \ verified. The system \ndynamically produces non‑contiguous isobands, each representing\
    \ a specific range of parameter \nvalues, and can be properly exported for use\
    \ by other programs or smart machinery. It was proven \nthat EGYPADS supports\
    \ more than one land with different geometry, area, location, and number of \n\
    nodes. EGYPADS was compared with the traditional LSA method, and was found to\
    \ produce similar \nmanagement zones.\nThe agricultural sector contributes about\
    \ 16% of the Egyptian Gross Domestic Product (GDP), in addition it \nprovides\
    \ about 30% of job opportunities for  youth1. Therefore, the interest in developing\
    \ the agricultural sector is \nvery important for growing the Egyptian  economy2,3.\
    \ There are many challenges that hinder agricultural produc-\ntion in Egypt, for\
    \ example, the reduction of agricultural ownership, soil loosed due to increasing\
    \ urban sprawl, \netc.4–6, where it has been observed that approximately 50% of\
    \ the farms in the Nile Delta have an area less than \none  acre7. Other challenges\
    \ that are facing the agricultural production in Egypt include: reliance of most\
    \ farmers \non traditional agricultural methods, climate change, deficiency of\
    \ irrigation water, determining the proper time \nfor fertilization and pest resistance,\
    \ etc. Most of these challenges may be due to a lack of understanding of the \n\
    spatial distribution of soil characteristics, LSA and their relationship to the\
    \  crop8.\nThe potato is considered one of the essential crops for most people\
    \ around the world, the total global pro-\nduction of about 360 million metric\
    \ meters. Annual production of fruits and vegetables in Egypt was about 35 \n\
    million tons in 2018 according to Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), in\
    \ addition potato is one of the \nhighest production crops among vegetables. Statistics\
    \ indicate that Egyptian potato exports reached 205 mil-\nlion US dollars in 2018.\
    \ Egypt exported more than 724,200 thousand tons of potatoes in 2018 and became\

    www.nature.com/scientificreports/\nfifth largest exporter of potatoes, mainly\
    \ to Russia and the European  Union9. Potato crop is not far from the \nchallenges\
    \ that face the Egyptian agricultural production; thus due to its extreme importance\
    \ with the great \nchallenge and problems facing its production and export, the\
    \ study in this paper was chosen to mainly revolve \naround the potato crop and\
    \ specifically addresses the agricultural practice related to assessing the suitability\
    \ of \nthe land for its production.\nDuring the past two decades, Precision Agriculture\
    \ (PA) techniques have proven successful in improving the \nfarm management and\
    \ contributing to addressing the agricultural problems, on the other hand increasing\
    \ the \nagricultural profitability benefit based on more accurate information\
    \ on the agricultural  processes10,11. Reducing \nthe cost of farming while increasing\
    \ productivity is often seen as a win-win strategy for managing resources and\
    \ \nsustainable agricultural  production12. During the agricultural process, farmers\
    \ need help in making the right \ndecision to manage their farm during the crop\
    \ growth stages.\nPA allows monitoring and tracking plant growth in different\
    \ stages, monitoring the change in climate fac-\ntors, as well as monitoring the\
    \ change in soil moisture status to determine the appropriate time for irrigation\
    \ \nand irrigation  scheme13–15. Soil type, salinity, moisture, pH, depth, and\
    \ drainage characteristics, as well as their \ndistribution influence farm production,\
    \ thus, understanding the dynamic availability of soil resources is a key to \n\
    soil  management14,16–18. The precision control of soil resources within the farm\
    \ can either ensure sustainability \nor enhance the cropping intensity with appropriate\
    \ interventions.\nSince the appearance of PA concept in the early 1980s, a lot\
    \ of related technologies and  methods19 have \nbeen developed and evolved over\
    \ time. Perhaps the most prominent technologies used in PA, which clearly \nappeared\
    \ in its proposed solutions, are: the remote sensing which is a geospatial technology\
    \ used for monitor-\ning the physical characteristics of an agricultural field\
    \ on the earth from a distance by acquiring its emitted or \nreflected electromagnetic\
    \ radiation via sensors deployed on satellites or aircrafts; the Global Positioning\
    \ System \n(GPS) which is a satellite-based radio-navigation system in which the\
    \ agricultural data collection devices are \nequipped with GPS receiver calculates\
    \ its distance from at least four satellites via the time taken by radio signals\
    \ \nto propagate from each one, and from this it calculates the device real location\
    \ on the earth; the Geographic \nInformation Systems (GIS) which is the software\
    \ tool used to manage and analyze the acquired spatial data to \ndeduce important\
    \ implicit  conclusion20–23; spatial analysis and mapping techniques; Decision\
    \ Support System \n(DSS) which represents a software technique utilizes a provided\
    \ data to produce conclusions and guidance sup-\nports decision-makers in specific\
    \ agricultural practice.\nThe DSS for the agricultural management is quite complex;\
    \ it needs specific information about agricultural \nprocesses, such as climate\
    \ conditions, many variables affect crop growth where each crop requires a different\
    \ \noptimum value for  growth20,21. The success of DSS decisions in managing the\
    \ agricultural process depends on \nthe quality of information about the stages\
    \ of growth of agricultural crops, while the traditional data acquisi-\ntion technologies\
    \ such as remote sensing and the GPS-equipped handheld data collection devices\
    \ suffer from \nsome limitations affect its accuracy such as the low temporal\
    \ and spatial resolution, limited variety of available \nsoil and plant data,\
    \ and impossibility of implementing automation. Therefore, the recent technologies\
    \ Wireless \nSensor Network (WSN) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) are introduced\
    \ as PA-enabling technologies for \ndata acquisition solving a lot of their past\
    \ technologies limitations and  problems22–25.\nA WSN comprises wireless nodes\
    \ contain sensors with variety of sensing modalities; these sensor nodes are \n\
    deployed in the field to sense and send its related real-time data continuously\
    \ to the software system where it is \nstored and utilized. These devices also\
    \ can receive commands from the software application control its integrated \n\
    actuators achieving a closed- or open-loop control system for the farm. The UAVs\
    \ or the agriculture drones can \nbe regarded as a sensor/actuator node has the\
    \ ability to fly at low altitude from the crop which aid in producing \nhigh spatial\
    \ resolution imagery and detect tiny crop details that can be used for example\
    \ to distinguish between \ncrop diseases. Thus, UAVs can be used to produce accurate\
    \ field mapping, along with other applications such \nas crop spraying.\nWhen\
    \ talking about the recent PA systems which is based on WSN and emerging information\
    \ technology, the \nIoT technology should be a key component in such PA  systems26.\
    \ It enables the remote access of the deployed \nsensing devices on the field\
    \ which adds flexibility in the system usage and increases its scalability. A\
    \ complete \nIoT system is composed of three tiers: the things tier, the IoT connection\
    \ tier, and the application tier. The things \ntier includes the IoT devices and\
    \ the monitored/controlled things. The IoT device is an embedded device has \n\
    support for internet connectivity; it can be connected to the thing it monitors/controls\
    \ or a standalone device; \nit can be a sensor node or a base station just works\
    \ as forwarder to the data of a WSN through the Internet. The \nIoT connection\
    \ tier is implemented by the IoT messaging protocols which define the rules, formats\
    \ and func-\ntions for transferring messages between IoT clients over the Internet.\
    \ The application tier contains the back- and \nfront-end services that implement\
    \ the functions of a specific IoT use case and represent the real benefit of the\
    \ \ncollected IoT data.\nThe proposed work in this paper belongs to these recent\
    \ PA systems. EGYPADS can be regarded as an IoT-\nenabled PA application which\
    \ is a software system does PA function(s) and equipped to receive data directly\
    \ from \nthe field devices, on the other hand, it can be viewed as an IoT system\
    \ dedicated to a specific use case related to \nthe agriculture field concentrates\
    \ in its current version with the implementation of the second and third IoT tiers.\n\
    As an IoT use case, the case in question is the automation of site-specific management\
    \ and LSA processes for \nsupporting potato crop cultivation management decisions.\
    \ As a PA software platform it exploits the underlying \ntechnologies to add more\
    \ improved smart agriculture functions and services.\nAs mentioned earlier EGYPADS\
    \ implements mainly the second and third IoT tiers. The application tier is \n\
    web-based controlled by a JavaScript back-end application manages the database,\
    \ data processing and analysis, \nweb hosting, communication with the front-end,\
    \ and the IoT communication tier. The IoT tier is implemented \nusing a publish-subscribe\
    \ messaging  pattern27 to support asynchronous broadcasting, event-driven opera-\n\
    tions, and near real-time communication; and generally reaching decoupled components\
    \ in time, space, and \n3\nVol.:(0123456789)\nScientific Reports |        (2022)\

    synchronization, thus increasing the system maintainability, reliability, and\
    \ scalability. The parameters used in \nthe analysis are related to chemical,\
    \ physical, and fertility characteristics of the soil, as well as some parameters\
    \ \nrelated to weather conditions and plant characteristics. The EGYPADS front-end\
    \ allows system users to access the \nsystem services which are: Spatial Analysis\
    \ (Mapping Service) using absolute and virtual coordinates; Real-time \nData Visualization\
    \ which includes Climate and Plant Parameters Visualization, Soil Parameters Visualization,\
    \ \nand Nodes Status Monitoring Panel; Historical Data Visualization, Events and\
    \ Actions Settings, and Adminis-\ntrative Settings.\nDue to its modularity and\
    \ by selecting a lightweight messaging protocol suitable for major embedded and\
    \ \nnon-embedded platforms, EGYPADS exposes API to connect any IoT device by small\
    \ settings to its IoT client \nsoftware and the format of the IoT message payload.\
    \ The current version of EGYPADS also considers a real \nimplementation of the\
    \ things tier but without full support for the system abilities; it is used only\
    \ for testing and \nverification purposes. This tier contains a WSN comprises\
    \ a base station and sensor nodes forming star topology.\nA complete LSA process\
    \ for potato crop was conducted in an agriculture land in El-Salhia region using\
    \ the \ntraditional method currently in use, which entails frequent field visits.\
    \ The conducted field trips and analysis \nhelped in determining the pitfalls\
    \ of the traditional method, highlighting the need to automate this method, \n\
    reaching the land assessment criteria and model, setting the values of weights\
    \ and scores, shaping the require-\nments of the automated process, and putting\
    \ the specification of its real-time decision support system and \nrequired output.\
    \ These field trips were also needed to collect soil samples for laboratory analysis\
    \ to determine \nthe values of some parameters of the assessment model that could\
    \ not be given as direct readings from devices. \nThirteen parameters and three\
    \ thematic indicators were used in the assessment; their values were interpolated\
    \ \nfor spatial analysis and their maps were produced.\nFrom the foregoing, it\
    \ is clear that there is a gap between the method currently used for Management\
    \ Zone \n(MZ) delineation especially the LSA practice and the technological advances\
    \ in electronics, communication, and \ninformation management that are invading\
    \ the field of agriculture today. At the same time, the available smart \nagriculture\
    \ solutions miss addressing the automation of this practice. The proposed work\
    \ was keen to fill this \ngap, therefore its objectives focused on automating\
    \ the LSA process and generally providing an enhanced spatial \nanalysis functionality\
    \ backed by IoT capabilities to facilitate the agricultural management practices\
    \ and obtain \nhighly accurate results by producing such maps with higher temporal\
    \ resolution using the real-time field data. \nThe research work in this paper\
    \ describes the details of designing a novel smart agriculture solution that sup-\n\
    ports LSA process automation, and combines other smart agriculture services not\
    \ present in any other systems, \nor at least they do not exist together in one\
    \ other system, and presents them in a different form and with greater \ncapabilities.\
    \ The proposed system—EGYPADS -is characterized by:\n• Exploiting the new technologies\
    \ of IoT communication system, web development, database, and digital \nmapping\
    \ to automate the construction of MZ maps directly from the data sent by the infield\
    \ sensing devices.\n• This automation would help reduce expenses, time, and effort\
    \ consumed in repetitive field visits to collect \nfield data that are used in\
    \ mapping, and it would also help avoid human error in taking or recording readings\
    \ \nand increase the temporal accuracy of mapping.\n• The spatial modeling and\
    \ analysis of the phenomena is based on the standard and common methods.\n• Producing\
    \ thematic maps of soil properties such as soil salinity, soil depth, etc., from\
    \ real-time as well as \nhistorical data.\n• LSA and construction of soil MZs\
    \ of any selected farm using real-time as well as historical data.\n• Facilitation\
    \ to construct maps through both methods: the ordinary used method which requires\
    \ the data \ncollected from the field trips to be entered manually into the application\
    \ through sheets, and automatically \nfrom the data sent by infield devices.\n\
    • Ability to export maps in standard formats.\n• Facilitation and flexibility\
    \ to formulate a complete complex event to be tested such that any critical condition\
    \ \ncan be detected and dealt early.\n• Ability to use virtual coordinates for\
    \ spatial analysis if Global Positioning System (GPS) is not available and \n\
    the area is not large.\n• Ability to register any land having any geometrical\
    \ shape with the system and facility for remote central \nmonitoring.\nThis paper\
    \ explains activities of the field trips; the architecture, requirements, screens,\
    \ functions, and services \nof the proposed system; and its functionality verification.\
    \ The rest of this paper is organized as follows, “Literature \nreview” section\
    \ reviews the related work, “Materials and methodology” section introduces the\
    \ spatial modeling \nand the proposed system architecture. “Results” section shows\
    \ the results of the system implementation and \nvalidation. “Discussion” section\
    \ is a discussion of the work presented in this paper taking the character of\
    \ com-\nparison between using the system and using the current used method for\
    \ spatial analysis. Finally, “Conclusion \nand future work” section concludes\
    \ the paper.\nLiterature review\nA large number of uncountable research and commercial\
    \ solutions have been proposed for each PA technology \nhighlighted in the previous\
    \ section or a combination of them. This section will shed the light on some examples\
    \ \nof them.\nWSN and UAV are used in a lot of applications such as soil sampling,\
    \ field mapping, tractor guidance, crop \nscouting, variable rate applications,\
    \ etc.  In28, the images taken by three different types of camera (multispectral,\

    \ \nwere performed.The system was tested for real lands in clear sky conditions\
    \ and proved good performance \nand ability to aid in giving precision irrigation\
    \ recommendations, but this is not without some flaws such as \nnegative performance\
    \ indicators with respect to missing plants detection, and lack of a precise monitoring\
    \ of \nother descriptive ground parameters related to plant status, soil, microclimate,\
    \ yield and quality. In addition, \nit is appropriate for small and medium scale\
    \ agricultural lands; the monitoring operational time of the UAV is \ndetermined\
    \ to be 15 min.\nA huge number of smart farming applications based on WSN were\
    \ presented in the literature.  In29, the solu-\ntion is presented to improve\
    \ water consumption and at the same time improve crop size by making available\
    \ \nthe information by which cultivation, harvesting, irrigation, and fertilization\
    \ can be efficiently scheduled. It \nmonitors temperature, relative humidity,\
    \ and soil moisture, and formulates a report of them contains also a \n10-day\
    \ weather forecast.\nSome of the proposed applications were suitable to only one\
    \ farm or some adjacent farms, and for small to \nmedium farms scale, a local\
    \ laptop or personal digital assistant was employed to run the application and\
    \ monitor \nthe farm. To be able to monitor and control more than one land from\
    \ anywhere, the concept of IoT becomes in \nperfect tandem with the PA applications.\n\
    In30, an IoT-based mobile application called LandPKS was introduced as an estimator\
    \ to land potential and \nresilience by combining user inputs including land geographical\
    \ location and his answer to specific questions \nconcerning his land with cloud-based\
    \ knowledge and similar potential information to help in selecting sustain-\n\
    able land management practices against the climate change effects. The system\
    \ is point-based estimator, relays \non simple user inputs and only on relatively\
    \ static soil properties, such as soil texture and depth.\nA monitoring tool called\
    \ PETEFA is proposed  in31, it exploits the data received from a meteorological\
    \ sta-\ntion sensors, weather station sensors, and images from satellites such\
    \ as LandSat 8, Spot 6 and 7, WorldView 2, \nPERUSAT-1 and from UAVs, to provide\
    \ three types of information and spatial data for the yellow corn crops \n(Zea\
    \ Mays) for the sake of the National Institute of Agrarian Innovation (INIA):\
    \ the crop temperature and health \nstatus throughout its lifecycle, the soil\
    \ state, and information on crop evapotranspiration with different Privileges\
    \ \nfor INIA and the farmers.\nThe work  in32 proposes for irrigation control.\
    \ It includes a web application visualizes the data comes from \nthe field, allows\
    \ for manipulating the irrigation conditions, analyzing the data to forecast the\
    \ future water need \nusing data mining. The control is automatically driven by\
    \ the field data or manually through a mobile application.\nAn IoT-based decision\
    \ support system was proposed  in33 for mitigating the potato late blight disease\
    \ and \nsupport its management. The real-time data received from the field sensors\
    \ is utilized to compute the per day \naverage temperature and number of successive\
    \ hours where the humidity exceeds 90%, then these values are input \nto an implemented\
    \ disease forecast model which computes a blight units parameter and test some\
    \ conditions \nto send an SMS warning to the farmer when he should begin the treatment\
    \ against the disease. The dashboard \nof the system also displays the deployed\
    \ nodes in their real locations and some information about them with \ntheir real-time\
    \ sensed values.\nSome of the systems use a ready-to-use IoT platform as a basis\
    \ for their development, some others are built \nfrom scratch; each one of these\
    \ approaches has its pros and cons. While using IoT platform reduces time to \n\
    market and may facilitate the IoT application development, in addition to the\
    \ security issue, selecting the most \nsuitable platform for the solution at hand\
    \ is a complex task may result in inappropriate choice especially that the \n\
    platform may be hard to be learnt and debugged for simple errors. In the presented\
    \ solution, it is preferred to \nhave full control and customization over its\
    \ whole design, debug, update, and maintenance.\nA lot of the commercial precision\
    \ agriculture software programs have addressed the spatial variability analysis\
    \ \nusing the site-specific MZ approach, some of them are specialized software\
    \ and some others represent integrated \nfarm management solutions, such as the\
    \ famous  Trimble34,  AgStudio35,  AgroSense36, and Topcon IoT Farm \nManagement\
    \ Information  System37. These programs depend on manually drawn zones or importing\
    \ existing \nzones, also they enter the field data as files into the program,\
    \ and may be compatible with certain type of hard-\nware sensing devices.\nSome\
    \ software tools for land assessment were proposed for land use planning such\
    \ as Automated Land Evalu-\nation System (ALES)38 and Land Suitability Evaluation\
    \ (LSE)39. The LSE executes on raster data not on text data, \ndefines the land\
    \ suitability classes by multi-criteria analysis and directly provides the analysis\
    \ output through a \nmap; it is flexible, supports defining and changing the values\
    \ of the input variables. However, the data is entered \nand uploaded to these\
    \ tools manually by the users, and accordingly is updated manually.\nFrom the\
    \ above, we can find that the IoT should be a key component in a PA system, and\
    \ this is realized in \nour PA software system. The developed system is an IoT\
    \ use case in the field of agriculture provides software \nsolution for land suitability\
    \ assessment, but it is concerned with temporal and spatial analysis of soil,\
    \ climate and \nplant data. It was designed to retain some features and functions\
    \ of existing solution, improve, and add to them, \nwhile addressing their flaws;\
    \ this is such as different users with different privileges, real-time update\
    \ and detec-\ntions, flexibility in data entry methods, suitability to more than\
    \ one small to large scale land with any geometric \nshape, extendibility, warnings\
    \ and possibility of remote control, and more. A classification represents the\
    \ above \nmentioned PA solutions variations is depicted in Fig. 1. To the best\
    \ of our knowledge, the class of EGYPADS \nand generally the classes of IoT-based\
    \ MZ mapping and spatial analysis DSS have no outstanding agriculture-\ndedicated\
    \ solutions examples implemented and  tested40–43.\nThe features of EGYPADS are\
    \ compared with a sample of PA software applications characterized by offering\
    \ \nspatial analysis and MZs delineation services in Table 1. From this comparison,\
    \ it could be noticed that LSA is \nnot supported by the other applications or\
    \ its support lacks the IoT advantages, they rely on global data sources \n5\n\

    www.nature.com/scientificreports/\nof farms through different roles and authorities\
    \ and the 3D virtual coordinates spatial analysis for small farms \nwhen GPS is\
    \ not available.\nFew other programs have some of the EGYPADS features such as\
    \ the flexibility in formulating complete events \nwith logical, relational, arithmetic\
    \ operations and with different types of alerts and actions regarding any land\
    \ \nregistered on the system, any deployed nodes, and any phenomena, with timing\
    \ constraints. Also, few sample \nprograms offer remote monitoring of the field\
    \ sensing devices status.\nThe presence of some common characteristics between\
    \ EGYPADS and other programs does not mean that \nthey provide them in the same\
    \ way and capabilities, for example, in EGYPADS, we can easily register/unregister\
    \ \nany land of any area or geometry so that it takes advantage of all the provided\
    \ system services, easily navigate to \nthem, and visually compare the adjacent\
    \ lands and their updates in real-time, without having to create different \n\
    project for each land or thematic map.\nEGYPADS is not limited to certain devices\
    \ like other commercial software programs, it exposes interfaces \nto devices\
    \ that have all or some of its supported sensing modalities. These devices can\
    \ communicate with the \napplication, if these devices use the appropriate IoT\
    \ client library and settings, use the secret land code dedicated \nto the farm\
    \ that contains them, adhere to the employed topic tree naming conventions, and\
    \ use the application \npayload structure. The LSA function of the EGYPADS current\
    \ version is developed for the potato crop, there-\nfore it needs to be enhanced\
    \ with a support for different crops; also forecasts is a service offered by some\
    \ other \nprograms but missed in EGYPADS.\nTable 1 also mentions the MZs accuracy\
    \ measures of the systems in terms of spatial information quality, zon-\ning efficiency,\
    \ freshness of data, and spatial resolution. The spatial data quality is determined\
    \ by the use of spatial \ndataset filtering to eliminate noisy data and outliers.\
    \ Some software applications include filtering as a function \nprecedes data interpolation;\
    \ some of them implements the global outliers elimination without consideration\
    \ of \nlocal outliers. The systems that depend on acquiring data from infield\
    \ sensing devices through periodic sensing \napplication, such as EGYPADS, can\
    \ implement filtering at the field data sources, and may be through different\
    \ \nlevels of aggregation or forwarding.\nThe location accuracy, defined as the\
    \ closeness of the information on maps to the values in the real world, \nis also\
    \ an important determinant of the spatial data quality. The potential gross error\
    \ caused by the human fac-\ntor in taking and recording the geospatial readings\
    \ using handheld devices threatens the location accuracy of \nsystems that relay\
    \ on this for dataset collection; whereas calibrated infield sensor nodes in IoT-enabled\
    \ systems, \nsuch as EGYPADS, is free from this error, and an estimated redundancy\
    \ of sensor nodes can compensate for any \nenvironmental or instrumental errors\
    \ and increase data reliability. A system in Table 1 is marked as having good\
    \ \nspatial information quality if it incorporates filtering procedures or location\
    \ accuracy ingredients.\nThe zoning efficiency or spatial analysis efficiency\
    \ lies in the interpolation process and the aggregation of \nmultiple layers of\
    \ information to produce the management zones that incorporate experts knowledge.\
    \ The spatial \ninterpolation of data before MZ delineation is a required step\
    \ for improving isolines smoothness and for variance \nreduction. The most commonly\
    \ used methods for interpolation are the deterministic Inverse Distance Weighting\
    \ \n(IDW) and the geostatistical kriging methods. Kriging is more suitable for\
    \ large datasets, but causes problems \nwith the presence of outliers. IDW is\
    \ more suitable and gives better accuracy for homogenously distributed \nsmall\
    \ digitized datasets, as in EGYPADS. The system is marked in Table 1 as producing\
    \ efficient zones when it \nemploys interpolation and layers aggregation procedures.\
    \ Freshness of data as well as the temporal resolution \nis intuitively better\
    \ in IoT-enabled systems. In the same systems, the required level of spatial resolution\
    \ can be \ncontrolled by adjusting the number and distribution of active sensor\
    \ nodes.\nMaterials and methodology\nThe field management is a complex process\
    \ related to several factors such as soil conditions, crop types, climate \nconditions,\
    \ and water quality. The current case study is related specifically to soil suitability\
    \ evaluation for potato \ncrop. However, the study generally addresses the spatial\
    \ analysis of the agricultural phenomena, such as the chlo-\nrophyll content index\
    \ (CCI) and the atmospheric temperature, as well as the generation of their corresponding\
    \ \nmanagement zones maps. This section describes the study area, EGYPADS system\
    \ architecture, and its spatial \nanalysis and land suitability evaluation models\
    \ that are used to delineate the management zones.\nThe description of study area.\
    \ \nThe study area is located among the soil of Sixths of October Company \nfor\
    \ Agricultural Projects (SOAP) which is located in El-Salhia Area, south west\
    \ of Ismailia city and to the East \nsouth of El-Kassaseen city. It is bounded\
    \ by 30° 28′ 11.93’’ and 30° 28′ 41.63’’ latitudes and 31° 59′ 25.31’’ and 31°\
    \ \n59′ 59.45’’ longitudes as shown in Fig. 2.\nField trips and laboratory analysis.\
    \ \nA number of five field trips include on-site field measurements were \nconducted\
    \ for different crop growth stages: during five stages after 30, 45, 60, 80, and\
    \ 90 days from planting. \nThe field trips post-activities include laboratory\
    \ analysis for collected soil profiles, and spatial analysis for the \nstudy parameters.\
    \ Twenty soil profile were carried out as they represent the variation of soil\
    \ characteristics of \nthe selected farm, the study area was divided into equal\
    \ cells based on grid system decided by the research team. \nEighty-five sites\
    \ were chosen as the main dataset for the modeling process during different growing\
    \ stages of \npotato crop. These sites represent all possible variations in soil\
    \ conditions and agricultural practices which may \noccur within the experimental\
    \ fields. The grid system and the location of the check points are explained in\
    \ Fig. 3.\nA total of 155 soil samples were collected from soil profiles and surface\
    \ samples. In addition to 425 plant \nsamples were collected during growing stages\
    \ of potato crop (5 stage × 85 samples) and analyzed for physical \nand chemical\
    \ characteristics using the standard analytical methods as indicated  by51.\n\

    \ the npm package manager (included in Node.js installation), the PostgreSQL relational\
    \ database \nmanagement system, dedicated server connected to the internet with\
    \ real public IP address to run the application.\nEGYPADS is a software system\
    \ prepared to be a part of the large IoT system, therefore it exposes interfaces\
    \ \nfor field devices communication. The MQTT client of the back-end subscribes\
    \ to the topics to which the reg-\nistered lands publish their data, while the\
    \ MQTT clients of the registered lands’ base stations subscribe to the \ntopics\
    \ to which the back-end publishes commands to these lands’ devices. Any land registered\
    \ to the system is \ngiven a secret code shared only between the land base station\
    \ and the back-end application. This land code is \nused to authenticate it and\
    \ identify its data at the back-end, and it is embedded in the topic tree naming\
    \ conven-\ntion employed in each EGYPADS system instance. As shown in Fig. 4,\
    \ the things IoT tier is composed of a base \nstation connected wirelessly to\

    sodium percentage (ESP), CaCO3, and pH (PH). The values of some of the soil parameters\
    \ are only deduced \nthrough laboratory analysis of soil samples, therefore the\
    \ system allows for entering the values of the laboratory \nparameter of each\
    \ land via an excel sheet of an application accepted format. A sensor node may\
    \ contain all the \nmentioned sensing modalities, or the land may contain different\
    \ types of sensor nodes according to sensing \nmodalities incorporated into each\
    \ type. It is also worth noting that it is not necessary to include all the scores\
    \ of \nthree soil quality indices, but some soil parameters can be neglected and\
    \ accordingly their scores omitted from \nthe index equation with modifying the\
    \ equation exponent (omitting a parameter score from the equation entails \nreducing\
    \ the denominator of the exponent by one).\nEGYPADS expects values for all parameters\
    \ in the message payload: the sensed parameters’ values, other-\nwise NULL, however\
    \ the value is retrieved from the database if it is a laboratory parameter. The\
    \ payload JSON \ncontent contains the identification of a land and a node together\
    \ with the node real coordinates and sensed data.\nThe sensor node may contain\
    \ actuators to actuate field equipments such as sprinklers. The sensor node may\
    \ \nnot contain GPS and thus uses the Virtual Coordinates Mapping Service as will\
    \ be illustrated later. The soil mois-\nture sensors can be used to measure the\
    \ WHC, acoustic sensors can be used to measure T and D, ring infiltrom-\neter\
    \ can be used to measure hydraulic conductivity G, electromagnetic sensors measure\
    \ various soil properties \nthat, such as T, R, OM, S. The red and infrared LEDs\
    \ together with the two corresponding spectrometers can be \nused to measure the\
    \ CCI. The back-end JavaScript application manages all the system operations and\
    \ performs \nbehind-the-scenes functionality that offers EGYPADS services to the\
    \ users and allows them to interact with the \nsystem. An overview of EGYPADS\
    \ functionality is depicted in Fig. 5 flowchart.\nEGYPADS back-end application\
    \ starts with the required configurations, initializations, access to modules,\
    \ \nURI Routing settings, subscription to the MQTT topics of fields data; then,\
    \ it starts its parallel operations. It \nperforms the periodic operations of\
    \ checking nodes status, checking for the occurrence of specified events, and\
    \ \nperforming calculations for the 3D virtual coordinates data charts. In flowchart\
    \ of Fig. 5, the \"Loop limit\" shape \nand the associated inverted one indicate\
    \ the start and end of a loop containing the procedures of an operation, \nrespectively.\
    \ The back-end application always listens for incoming requests to display HTTP\
    \ URLs, or incoming \ndata through the POST method to handle it appropriately\
    \ whether it is data for updating the virtual coordinates \nchart settings, a\
    \ request to retrieve stored data, a syntax of a specific event to be registered,\
    \ etc.\nLikewise, the back-end application always listens for incoming data messages\
    \ from the fields. Once a data \nmessage is received, it is parsed, the real-time\
    \ values of parameters are issued to be displayed in the system \nscreens, the\
    \ sending node record is added to the database or updated if already exists, and\
    \ the geographical file \ndata is updated to be ready to be fetched by the mapping\
    \ services.\nWhile that the server tier of the system starts and performs its\
    \ operations, as shown in Fig. 5, the MQTT \nclients of the fields also start\
    \ and perform their operation by subscribing to command topics, publishing periodi-\n\
    cally to fields data topics, and listening for incoming command messages.\nLand\
    \ management zones delineation using EGYPADS. \nThe land management zones were\
    \ deline-\nated based on land suitability criteria of the potato crop according\
    \  to51. Thirteen parameter have been used in \nthis work to study land suitability\
    \ for potato. These parameters are OM, N, P, K, Zn, R, T, D, G, S, ESP,  CaCO3\
    \ and \nPH. Three thematic indicators were used in assessing land suitability:\
    \ soil fertility, chemical and physical quality \nindices according to the following\
    \  equations58. Equation (1) was used to calculate land suitability spatial model:\n\
    where LS is land suitability, FQI is fertility quality index, CQI is chemical\
    \ properties quality index and PQI is \nphysical properties quality index. The\
    \ physical properties quality index was calculated using Eq. (2):\nwhere  SR is\
    \ the score of drainage,  ST is the score of Texture,  SD is the score of soil\
    \ depth, and  SG the score of Bulk \ndensity. The chemical quality index was calculated\
    \ using Eq. (3):\nwhere  SS is the score of soil salinity,  SE is the score of\
    \ ESP,  SK is the score of  CaCO3 content and  SH is the score of \nsoil pH. The\
    \ fertility quality index was calculated using Eq. (4):\nwhere  SN is the score\
    \ of available nitrogen,  SP is the score of available phosphorous,  SK is the\
    \ score of available \npotassium,  Szn is the score of available zinc,  SOM is\
    \ the score of organic matter content and Sc/n is the score of \nratios of carbon\
    \ to nitrogen.\nMapping spatial analysis of soil characteristics. \nData was gathered,\
    \ entered, stored, manipulated, \nanalyzed, and output by a decision support system\
    \ program. The locations of soil profiles were digitized in order \nto know the\
    \ geographic coordinates and the weighted average value for each parameter belonging\
    \ to each soil \nprofile (soil depth, saturation percent (SP), pH, EC, OM,  CaCO3,\
    \ Gypsum, CEC, sand, silt, clay and texture) \nand to carry out interpolation\
    \ for soil properties using the program. The weight values of selected parameters\
    \ \ncalculated in Analytic Hierarchy Process and designated scores for physical\
    \ and chemical quality assessment as \nfollowing in Tables 2 and 3. The same calculations\
    \ of weights and scores for soil parameters, evaluation criteria, \nquality classes\
    \ were employed in EGYPADS.\n(1)\nLS = (FQI × CQI × PQI)1/3\n(2)\nPQI = (SR ×\

    Preparation for implementation and validation. \nThe system implementation was\
    \ preceded by using \nthe current traditional method of performing LSA and spatial\
    \ analysis, including recursive field trips, on-site \ndata collection, and utilizing\
    \ the desktop programs used to draw the analysis maps. Generating and updating\
    \ \nthese maps in real-time from the data comes directly from the field were taken\
    \ as the main objectives of the pro-\nposed system. A schematic represents the\
    \ main activities of using both EGYPADS and the traditional method \nand a relation\
    \ between them is depicted in Fig. 6. The field trips were important to: know\

    design, and practically understand the real benefit of the system. In addition,\
    \ a field trip is essential to determine \nthe values of the laboratory parameters.\n\
    To test and validate the EGYPADS system functioning, the IoT connectivity was\
    \ implemented using a \nCC3100-TM4C123G base station connected in a star topology\
    \ to three sensor nodes contain DHT22 tempera-\nture sensors and LM393 soil moisture\
    \ sensors (Fig. 7). At the same time, in order to include different lands in \n\
    the validation, the IoT connectivity was also emulated by employing a real MQTT\
    \ connection, can run on dif-\nferent computers (work as the field devices), and\
    \ sends its packets to the application over the Internet; while the \nfunctionality\
    \ of these virtual field devices is simulated by MATLAB software coding with programs\
    \ represent a \nlight-emitting diode (LED) component on the devices (shown in\
    \ Fig. 8). This LED coloring is used as an indica-\ntion to the reception of a\
    \ remote command from the application to this device.\nEach of these virtual devices\
    \ can work as an IoT-enabled node deployed on the field sends its data directly\
    \ \nto the system through the Internet or an IoT-enabled base station sends the\
    \ data of the field devices on behalf of \nthem, each node data in a separate\
    \ packet. The payload of the published data packet is a JSON object contains \n\
    the name/value pairs the system is familiar with which contains the land code,\
    \ the device identification, the GPS \nlatitude and longitude coordinates of the\
    \ device, and the values of the sensed phenomena. At the transmission \ntime,\
    \ each virtual device picks a random value of each sensed phenomenon within its\
    \ acceptable range, and sets \nthe value of the unsensed phenomenon to null.\n\
    The validation tests includes validating the system IoT connection, making sure\
    \ that the system functions \nreally work focusing on its two most important functions:\
    \ the Mapping service and Events and Actions service, \nand emphasizing that these\
    \ functions produce their required output.\nThe previously mentioned setup for\
    \ validation is illustrated in more detail in Fig. 9. The MQTT client is imple-\n\
    mented in the IoT devices used in the testing whether it is the embedded base\
    \ station (Eclipse Paho Embedded \nMQTT C client) or the laptops acting as virtual\
    \ base stations (Eclipse Paho MQTT C client). Two laptops were \nused; each laptop\
    \ runs more than one virtual base station program send periodically messages of\
    \ nodes data \nand assign random values for their parameters. The MQTT.js client\
    \ library is used in Node.js back-end applica-\ntion.The Mosca MQTT  broker59\
    \ is used to implement the MQTT server in a localhost machine, but to use real\
    \ \nInternet connections between the back-end and the IoT devices, a public MQTT\
    \ Server: mqtt://broker.hivemq.\ncom is employed for the purpose of testing and\
    \ validation.\nResults\nBased on the analysis of the field trips data, the management\
    \ zone maps were produced and the spatial distribu-\ntion analysis was conducted.\
    \ The analysis results can be used to decide the appropriate land use and the\
    \ appropri-\nate site-specific land management. Three zones were recognized of\
    \ the study area as follows:\nZone (I) They represent highly suitable areas. It\
    \ has very good and suitable for the potato crop. This zone is \ncharacterized\
    \ by a flat area, light texture and deep soil. Their contents of salinity, carbonate,\
    \ and gypsum are very \nlow with slopes < 1%. This zone is covering about 5% of\
    \ the total area. These results agree with some researches \non the same  area60\n\

    www.nature.com/scientificreports/\nZone (III) They represent moderately suitable\
    \ areas for some crops. It has one or more severe limitation that \nexcludes the\
    \ use of the land that require special management practices or severely restrict\
    \ the range of crops \nsuch as salinity, where the electric conductivity values\
    \ range between moderate-high to moderate, and content \nof clay is low to very\
    \ low where texture for this zone range from sand to loamy sand. This zone is\
    \ characterized \nby moderately deep. This zone is covering about 30% of the total\
    \ area).\nThe proposed system implementation allows to generate these maps and\
    \ make such analysis continuously \nbased on the near-real-time data sent by the\
    \ devices deployed in the field, in addition to the system providing \nother services.\
    \ The following subsections show the results of the system implementation and\
    \ validation.\nThe system services screens. \nThis section describes the result\
    \ of the system implementation from the \nthree different views of internet users,\
    \ normal users, and administrator.\nThe internet users view. EGYPADS website contains\
    \ a landing page available to all Internet users who can navi-\ngate through its\
    \ public pages such as \" About us\" and \"Contact us” and know about the application\
    \ features and \nthe sponsoring organizations. The application services and features\
    \ reside under the \"EGYPADS App\" tab in the \ntop menu. The sub-menus’ links\
    \ appear dimmed unclickable to the Internet user and request from him to login\
    \ \nas Administrator or Normal user by clicking the \"Sign in\" tab, see Fig. 10.\n\
    The normal users view. After the user signed in, all the links become active to\
    \ the Administrator account, but \nthe Normal user account is unauthorized to\
    \ open the \"Events and Actions Settings\" service pages.\nThe spatial analysis\
    \ of different field phenomena and parameters can be achieved in two forms: using\
    \ a \ngeographic coordinate system through the Mapping Service or using virtual\
    \ coordinates. The Mapping Service \npage is shown in Fig. 11. Number 1 in Fig. 11\
    \ symbolizes the real earth map. The hoverable side navigation \nmenu, represented\
    \ by Number 3, contains buttons—from top to bottom—for adding lands, adjusting\
    \ the system \ncontrollable parameters values such as interpolation parameters,\
    \ input all the data to be drawn from excel sheet \ninstead of real-time field\
    \ data, draw maps from historical data, and deleting land.\nNumber 4 and Number\
    \ 5 are used for navigation. Number 4 allows the selection of a particular registered\
    \ \nland to navigate to. Number 6 is used to select the analysis phenomena or\
    \ index. Number 7 are toggle buttons to \nchange zones opacity-level to transparent/nontransparent\
    \ and to show/hide nodes positions on the map, Number \n9 represents two buttons\
    \ used to export maps in GeoJSON and Shapefile format. Number 10 is a set of drawing\
    \ \ntools related to Add land button as described in the following.\nBy clicking\
    \ the Add land button, the side screen shown in Fig. 12 appears. Through this\
    \ screen, we can enter \nthe data of the lands to be registered with the system.\
    \ The land data include: a mandatory Land name which is any \nname selected to\
    \ easily identify and discriminate lands, a mandatory Land code which should be\
    \ the same as the \nland code included in the data messages received from the\
    \ devices of this land, and the navigation information \nwhich can be the bounding\
    \ minimum and maximum Longitude and Latitude coordinates or instead just the \n\
    Longitude and Latitude coordinates of a certain point in the land whether known\
    \ or determined by the point \nmarker tool, and the laboratory parameter values\
    \ entered by browsing to select a fixed-structure excel file. The \nLand area\
    \ is computed automatically, this needs navigation to the land and specification\
    \ of its perimeter using the \ndrawing tools, Number 10, by moving the polygon\
    \ tool on the polygonal land perimeter, Fig. 12a, or by drawing \na line representing\
    \ a circle radius starting from the center of a circular land using the LineString\
    \ tool, Fig. 12b.\nThe spatial analysis using virtual coordinates system, where\
    \ an origin point (0,0) is specified on one of the field \ncorners and the x-axis\
    \ and y-axis are determined, is useful in case of the GPS is not available and\
    \ the field area is \nnot very large and doesn’t use smart equipments. This Virtual\
    \ Coordinates service uses this relative coordinate \nFigure 8.  Virtual node\

    to perform spatial analysis of the phenomenon or parameter using the IDW interpolation.\
    \ Then the result of the \nanalysis is visualized using surface or bar plots or\
    \ other 3D plots as shown in Fig. 13.\nThe Real-time Data Visualization service\
    \ opens on the monitoring panel of the nodes’ current status. This \npanel is\
    \ automatically populated with the nodes of the selected land as they are deployed\
    \ in the field and start \nsending their data. The node is represented by a colored\
    \ lamp; the green lamp means no severity. There are three \nlevels of severity\
    \ indicated by, in order of severity from low to high, flashing yellow lamp, flashing\
    \ red lamp, dark \ngrey lamp color which indicates a disabled node, see Fig. 14.\n\
    Using the top icon \"open\" will open the side menu to navigate through the other\
    \ Real-time Visualization \nservices. The Historical Data Visualization service\
    \ aids in retrieving, plotting, analyzing, printing the data stored \nin the database;\
    \ see Fig. 15.\nThe administrator view. The Administrator can use all the mentioned\
    \ services in addition to add/delete normal \nusers, change passwords, update\
    \ some of the system parameters, and use the Events and Actions service.\nThis\
    \ service, shown in Fig. 16, aids the administrator in the formulation of complete\
    \ events with test condi-\ntions, timing constraints, and actions. The system\
    \ accepts only a specified format for the condition. A list of the \nnodes meant\
    \ by the event separated by comma between square brackets is required, or the\
    \ word \"Any\" between \nthe square brackets to attribute the event to any node\
    \ in the land. This is followed by a relational expression con-\nsists of the\
    \ name of a phenomenon as defined by the application, or a mathematical expression\
    \ of phenomena, \nfollowed by relational operator and value. The previously mentioned\
    \ formula can be repeated as much as the \nevent entails separating them by the\
    \ logical operator OR or AND. Also, the logical operator Not can be used to \n\
    reverse the result of a relational expression.\nThe administrator can write the\
    \ required condition directly in the placeholder \"The formulated condition \n\
    is\" or it is better to use the facility given by the application in the first\
    \ form \"Formulating the Condition\" which \nenables him to only select what he\
    \ wants to include in the condition and it will be written on behalf of him in\
    \ \nthe application accepted format.\nThe timing constraints of the event include\
    \ specification of the time of the day in which the event should be \nevaluated\
    \ and whether it is required for it to remain true for a duration or the action\
    \ is taken once it is evaluated \nto be true.\nImplementation validation results.\
    \ \nThis section is dedicated for checking that the implemented system \nmeets\
    \ its requirements and objectives. The scenario, steps, and results of the validation\
    \ tests are illustrated in the \nfollowing subsections.\nFigure 11.  The mapping\

    The IoT subscriptions and publications were validated by Steps 3 and 4. Just after\
    \ the first message from a \nnode in Salhia land1 was received, an icon representing\
    \ its real position appears.\nIn the same fashion, the remaining deployed nodes\
    \ gradually appear, and gradually the zones map is con-\nstructed in the region\
    \ encloses the nodes sent data until the map of the whole land is constructed\
    \ for the currently \nselected parameter, see Fig. 19. The zones are drawn with\
    \ low level opacity colors, when we hover with the mouse \ncursor on a zone, it\
    \ is highlighted, the values range it represents and also its area in square meter\
    \ appear. The \nzones map that depends on a real-time parameter is continuously\
    \ updated once a new real-time value is received.\nThe same gradual construction\
    \ happened for Salhia land2 as a result of Step4 until the complete construction.\
    \ \nThe selected parameter for analysis can be changed, see Fig. 20.\nAccording\
    \ to Step6, a map for Salhia land2 salinity is exported as GeoJSON and then Shapefile,\
    \ and opened \nusing Mapshaper which is a software for editing GeoJSON and Shapefile.\
    \ Figure 21a shows the exported map \nand Fig. 21b shows it in the Mapshaper.\n\
    Tables 5 and 6 show the result of Steps 7 and 8. Node1 is randomly selected for\
    \ the validation calculations. \nThe manually calculated indices are the same\
    \ as the system-calculated values.\nThe result of Step 9 for the LS index is shown\
    \ in Fig. 22a where the grid of LS interpolation values that is \nproduced by\
    \ turf interpolate and the LS classes isobands which are generated by turf isobands\
    \ are shown. We \ncan zoom in specific boundary to see more values constructing\
    \ the two isobands [0–0.4] and [0.4–0.7], Fig. 22b.\nFor Steps 5 and 10, first,\
    \ all the existing events were ignored, then the required events were formulated\
    \ and \nsubmitted, Fig. 23 shows the translation of the events required to be\
    \ tested for Salhia land2.\nNode6 in Salhia land2 is selected to fire the temperature\
    \ event, accordingly its temperature readings are \nadjusted to take this sequence:\
    \ {19, 18.5, 9, 9, 9.5, 9.8, 9, 9, 8, 8, ………}. It is evident from this that the\
    \ third \nreading fulfills the temperature condition, but the event will fire\
    \ only if it remains less than 10 for a period of \nFigure 19.  Gradual construction\

    \ after the 9 °C temperature value of Node6 was received by the server, \nthe\
    \ event was fired after that by 1 min and its associated actions were taken: the\
    \ on-screen text alert message and \nthe email messages to the event’s registered\
    \ email addresses.\nThe condition of the remaining two events for Salhia land1\
    \ and Salhia land2 is composed of six sub-condi-\ntions. The first three sub-conditions\
    \ are related to the N and K of the three nodes which are laboratory parameters\
    \ \nentered by the excel sheet and their values are adjusted to make these sub-conditions\
    \ true. The remaining three \nsub-conditions depend on the value of the OM readings\
    \ sent by the three nodes; they are adjusted to take these \nvalues for Salhia\
    \ land1: Node1{0.4}, Node6{0.48}, Node10{0.3}, and take this sequence for Salhia\
    \ land2: Node1{ \n0.5, 0.48,0.55, 2, 1.5, ……….}, Node6{ 0.3, 0.47,0.5, 0.55, 0.5,\
    \ ……….}, Node10{ 0.47, 0.47, 1,0.5,0.5, ……….}. \nFor Salhia land1, just after\
    \ the reading of Node10 was received at 1:06, the second three sub-conditions\
    \ were \nsatisfied and the command Close was sent to Salhia land1 base station\
    \ where it blinked the LED with the green \ncolor to indicate the reception of\
    \ Close command, see Fig. 25a. For Salhia land2, the first three readings of the\
    \ \nthree nodes satisfies only the sub-conditions of Node6 and Node10, just after\
    \ Node1 sent its second reading at \n21:47:32, its sub-conditions also became\
    \ true, therefore an Open command was sent to Salhia land2 base station \nwhere\
    \ it blinked the LED with the red color to indicate the reception of Open command,\
    \ see Fig. 25b.\nThe validation test2 scenario. This test is related to the land\
    \ of the field trips, Salhia land1 in test1 with the same \nsettings of system\
    \ parameters. This test aims at producing maps of parameters using both the traditional\
    \ method \nand EGYPADS. The function of EGYPADS Mapping service, which allows\
    \ for entering all nodes data manually \nthrough a specific format excel sheet,\
    \ is employed in this test. The 85 sample values of three parameters (P, N, and\
    \ \nPH), which were measured/estimated and analyzed in the field trips, were entered\
    \ into EGYPADS representing \nFigure 22.  The generated LS interpolation grid\
    \ and isobands, (a) the grid and isobands of the whole area, (b) a \nzoom in specific\

    nodes readings, and their spatial analysis maps were generated. The acceptable\
    \ format of the excel sheet is shown \nin Fig. 26.\nThe validation test2 results.\
    \ Figure 27 and 28 show the management zones maps of P, N, and PH generated \n\
    from the GIS used in the traditional method and the EGYPADS, respectively. It\
    \ is noticed that, in case of EGY-\nPADS, there are small areas at the four horizontal\
    \ and vertical borders of the land don’t belong to any zone. This \nis because\
    \ that EGYPADS requires putting at least one sensor node at each of the farthest\
    \ four ends of the land \nin order to divide the whole area of the region into\
    \ management zones, and this not satisfied by the grid system \nused to collect\
    \ the data in the field visits. This causes the total area of the EGYPADS management\
    \ zones to be \nless than GIS zones total area by about 5.6%. Also, it is noticed\
    \ that EGYPADS produces the same zones of the \nparameters with slight difference\
    \ in zones shape and area accordingly.\nThe values of zones areas using the two\
    \ methods are given in Table 7. Generally, there is a reduction in the \nEGYPADS\
    \ zones areas than the GIS due to the just mentioned reason and of course due\
    \ to different implementa-\ntion of methods in the two approaches. The average\
    \ difference in the zones area is estimated to be approximately \n24.77%.\nFigure 23.\

    The validation test3. This test validates the ability of the system to support\
    \ more than one land with different \ngeometry, area, location, and number of\
    \ nodes. Different lands satisfy these characteristics were registered in the\
    \ \nsystem. Figure 29, shows some of the lands, including the land in Fig. 29c\
    \ which receives the three nodes read-\ning from the real base station. Since\
    \ the three sensor nodes don’t have GPS, certain coordinates were assigned to\
    \ \nthem. The temperature readings of the three nodes at the test time had very\
    \ little variation, all of their readings \nfell in the 30–40 temperature range.\
    \ From the test it is concluded that the lower the rates of maps update and data\

    \ zones.\nFigure 26.  The acceptable format of the excel sheet data.\nFigure 27.\

    Discussion\nLSA for land-use planning and management is the core of the implemented\
    \ IoT-based PA system use case. It \nis a multi-criteria decision support problem,\
    \ and the research in this paper includes the conventional method \nused to solve\
    \ this problem besides the implemented automated DSS. The conventional method\
    \ requires per-\nforming a field trip may include travels to distant places, a\
    \ considerable number of labors to take the readings \nin the predefined sampling\
    \ points and record them, using PC-based programs for data analysis which may\
    \ not \nbe user friendly and require skilled person to use it. This is for one-time\
    \ field sampling which doesn’t represent \nthe temporal distribution of phenomena\
    \ and entails other trips. The implemented system allows sensing and \nactuation\
    \ nodes to work as the data collection labors distributed in the field in a way\
    \ that satisfies the required \nspatial distribution of the phenomena, and remain\
    \ in the field sending data from their places in real-time with \nany required\
    \ rate. All received data is stored by the system, and just after the data reception,\
    \ it automatically \nperforms the spatial analysis and displays the results; in\
    \ this way if a critical condition occurs to the field, it \nwill be detected\
    \ early. The system doesn’t require its user to do specialized commands. EGYPADS\
    \ provides a \nmodernization of the LSA activity.\nConclusion and future work\n\
    Proper agricultural management requires evaluating different soil properties.\
    \ Also, the characteristics of the soil \ndiffer from one site to another within\
    \ the same farm. Real-time monitoring of soil properties especially, moisture\
    \ \nand temperature are important for the success of the agricultural process.\
    \ The proposed system, EGYPADS, \nallows for continuous monitoring of soil properties,\
    \ and utilizes this in building a novel feature gives a facility \nto classify\
    \ the farm into different zones for proper management in real-time as well as\
    \ from historical data with \nhigh temporal resolution. To the best of our knowledge,\
    \ this is the first smart agriculture system that automates \nthe practice of\
    \ land suitability assessment in order to facilitate it and increase its efficiency\
    \ in terms of accuracy \nof decision-making, need for manpower, time and effort\
    \ wasted on repeated field visits. As a smart agriculture \napplication, EGYPADS\
    \ is designed to take into account the important smart agriculture services, adding\
    \ new \nservices, and improving the services functionality. EGYPADS has the advantages\
    \ of providing the facility to \nenter the data manually along with its inherent\
    \ feature of reading directly from field sensor nodes. Although \nthe proposed\
    \ software gave reasonable results for soil management zones of the potato crops,\
    \ it needs to include \nFigure 28.  The EGYPADS-generated maps.\nTable 7.  Management\

    • A solar-powered portable IoT-enabled water pump (SPWP) is designed and fabricated.
    • The portability nature of the SPWP makes it easy to transport and relocate.
    • An IoT smart irrigation system (IoT-SIS) is developed to monitor the surroundings
    and control the pump over the Internet. • A new algorithm is proposed for data
    acquisition and control of the IoT-SIS using the Blynk IoT platform and Mobile
    App. • The IoT-SIS-SPWP system is implemented in a real environment for practical
    analysis and functionality testing. Abstract This paper proposes a solar-powered
    portable water pump (SPWP) for IoT-enabled smart irrigation system (IoT-SIS).
    A NodeMCU microcontroller with a Wi-Fi interface and soil moisture, temperature,
    and humidity sensors are exploited to monitor and control the water pump and build
    an IoT-based irrigation system. The proposed irrigation system updates the gathered
    information from sensors (moisture, temperature, and humidity) using an integrated
    algorithm to the Blynk IoT cloud in real-time. Farmers can access this information
    and control the water pump accordingly via a user-friendly interface using their
    smartphones. The portable and eco-friendly water pump is powered via a solar panel
    and can be controlled using Blynk mobile application, which is also used to monitor
    the surroundings. The fabricated pump is inspired by wheeled travel luggage and
    is equipped with a water filter and multi-nozzles sprayer. The developed solar-based
    water pump has managed to save electricity and mitigate operational costs. Furthermore,
    the integration of the IoT concept has facilitated real-time monitoring and control
    of the pump; thus, enhancing the water usage efficiency and enabling convenient
    farming operations. The system functionality has been practically tested in a
    real environment, and its performance has been evaluated. Previous article in

    pump 1. Introduction Water pumping is tremendously utilized in irrigation systems
    by many farmers worldwide. Irrigation technologies change rapidly from traditional
    irrigation activities that mainly depend on farmers to modern farm machinery that
    utilizes various machines and systems for water pumping and plantation process
    [1]. The water pump is primarily used for irrigation and livestock watering. Irrigation
    is a wide field focusing on water supply for growing plants and maintaining landscaping
    features, including trees, shrubs, grass, and flowers [[2], [3], [4]]. Water pumping
    is the key player in irrigation systems to supply the required water capacity
    at a specific area with adequate pressure and flow rate [5]. In conventional irrigation
    systems, farmers mainly depend on either diesel/fossil fuel-based pumps or electric-based
    pumps. However, fossil fuel and diesel-based water pumps are not environmental-friendly
    since they cause air pollution and contribute to climate change which is one of
    the serious problems in our world [[6], [7], [8]]. This is because the combustion
    of the diesel and fossil fuel release carbon dioxide which contributes in generating
    greenhouse effect and global warming and cause a risk toward human [9]. Also,
    the demand for electricity keeps increasing due to the faster development of agriculture
    in rural areas [10]. In other words, electricity deficit, fuel cost, air pollution,
    water wastage, and lack of new technologies utilization in agriculture pose significant
    concerns in conventional irrigation systems. Therefore, there is a real need for
    utilizing renewable energy resources to supply agricultural activities with the
    required energy. Solar energy is among the promising alternatives in irrigation
    systems that can be applied in agricultural activities to reduce electricity usage
    and minimize the consumed fossil fuel, especially for farmers in rural areas [11].
    It is an affordable choice for future energy compared to other renewable energies
    because of its availability in abundance, cost-effectiveness, installation cost,
    and efficiency [12]. Usually, the solar panel is attached to a voltage regulator,
    inverter, and battery to form a Photovoltaic (PV) System. Hence, the water pump
    should be equipped with a PV system to build a solar-powered water pump. In addition,
    in this era of technology, the emerging evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT)
    and advanced automation and control systems are being leveraged to realize smart
    irrigation systems with real-time monitoring and automated control. A solar-powered
    water pump with the Internet of Things (IoT) support is a promising alternative
    to overcome constraints in conventional irrigation methods. IoT is a recent paradigm
    of communication technology, where all objects with communication interfaces,
    such as sensors, appliances, smartphones, tablets, and laptops, can connect with
    each other and with the Internet. The main intention of IoT is to form a global
    and smart world using a global network system; thus, it creates a sense for data
    collection from a huge number of devices/sensors/nodes worldwide and makes it
    available over the Internet. IoT applications enhance all areas of our daily lives
    and become more inspiring and pervasive in many emerging domains, including smart
    grid, smart city, home automation, environmental monitoring, smart agriculture,
    healthcare and medical aids, and industrial automation. Consequently, integrating
    the IoT concept to construct a smart irrigation system will help farmers automate
    the water pumping operation and improve the farming and plantation process with
    less effort and cost. Generally, the greater the solar radiation, the greater
    the evapotranspiration, the greater the need for irrigation, and the greater the
    solar energy to supply power for water application. Therefore, in this paper,
    a solar-powered portable water pump is introduced by integrating a PV system with
    an electric water pump for irrigation purposes. The IoT concept is enabled to
    form a smart irrigation system that can update the collected information through
    sensors to the Internet and can be accessed by farmers using a mobile application
    via smartphones. A solar-powered water pump is a water pump that uses energy generated
    by a solar panel, so it is cost-effective and environmental-friendly. The solar
    water pump can run continuously for most of the daytime, directly from solar cells
    and during nighttime using a battery. Besides, this solar water pump is portable
    and free of power lines. It is suited for the farmer where the water resources
    are in remote locations. The system is equipped with nozzles to control the water
    flow rate and a filter for purifying the irrigation water. The portable nature
    of the multi-nozzles of the solar-powered water pump is an add-on feature that
    is required to cover a wider area and different plant kinds using a single pump;
    thus, provides more convenience to the farmers. An IoT-based control system is
    attached to the developed solar-powered water pump to form a smart irrigation
    system for real-time monitoring and remote control. The smart irrigation system
    includes a NodeMCU microcontroller, moisture and temperature/humidity sensors,
    and a relay board. The main contribution of this study is to design and fabricate
    a cost-effective solar-powered water pump with IoT integration for the smart irrigation
    system. To fulfil these requirements, this study adopts the following objectives
    and contributions: (i) Design and fabrication of a solar-powered portable water
    pump (SPWP) to save energy and fuel costs and mitigate air pollution using a renewable
    energy resource. The portability nature of the SPWP makes it easy to transport
    and relocate. (ii) Development of an IoT-based smart irrigation system (IoT-SIS)
    with an integrated algorithm to monitor the condition of the surroundings and
    remotely control the pump over the Internet using the Blynk IoT platform and mobile
    application. (iii) Implementation of the developed smart irrigation system with
    the solar-powered water pump (IoT–SIS–SPWP) in a real environment and conducting
    practical experiments to validate its performance and functionality. The rest
    of this paper is organized as follows. The next section presents the literature
    review and related studies. Section III presents the methods and materials. The
    system validation and performance testing are explained in Section IV. Finally,
    the article is concluded in Section V. 2. Literature review There are numerous
    areas where the rainwater is not adequate to accomplish this aim, and many of
    these regions face drought for various periods. Irrigation is the precise technology
    to cope with these issues based on several factors related to soil and crops [13].
    Water pumps are widely used in farming and irrigation systems. The normal water
    pump is powered by a diesel or fossil fuel engine to rotate. Several issues are
    rising due to the usage of such water pumps, including fuel price, maintenance
    cost, air pollution, generated noise, efficiency, and lack of remote control and
    monitoring [14]. Such water pumps need fuel or diesel as a supplement; thus, the
    farmer needs to spend extra operation costs for buying these supplements and maintaining
    the continuous operation of pumps that have a short life expectancy. Such add-on
    costs can be challenging, especially for the farmers who own their farms on a
    medium and small scale since their profit is not too much, and they cannot afford
    this high cost. Furthermore, the carbon dioxide released from fossil fuel and
    diesel into the atmosphere may also cause acid rain that can corrode the soil,
    vegetation, and crops [15]. From another perspective, using main grid electricity
    to feed electric water pumps for farming and irrigation in rural areas is another
    challenge [16]. The electricity demand is growing rapidly worldwide with the increase
    in the human population, urbanization, and modernization. About 70% of the population
    is employed in the agriculture sector, which consumed 18% of the total power generated
    compared to other sectors [17]. This is required to produce a considerable amount
    of electricity to support the energy requirements for agriculture field activities
    to secure irrigation water in all rural areas. Governments have to spend a lot
    of money and resources to meet the energy demand in agriculture, particularly
    supplying electrical energy to rural areas, which is not always an easy solution
    [18]. Recently, more attention is dedicated to current studies on real-time monitoring
    and advancement in remote control concepts over the Internet for precision irrigation,
    particularly in rural areas. It is expected that the new IoT paradigm will play
    a crucial role in the agriculture field to improve the remote control of irrigation
    systems and attain real-time information about every aspect related to plantation
    and farming activities. Therefore, smart irrigation systems that utilize various
    microcontrollers, sensors, actuators, and wireless technologies to send agriculture
    and irrigation-related data to an IoT platform are necessary. Such an IoT-based
    irrigation system will help farmers to monitor their farms'' conditions over the
    Internet using their smart devices, in addition to switching ON/OFF the water
    pumps remotely via a mobile application. The solar photovoltaic system converts
    sunlight into electric energy directly through the photovoltaic effect. This solar
    photovoltaic system is a valuable and sustainable approach to overcoming the current
    environmental issue and crisis. The smallest element of a PV system is the solar
    cell. Each solar cell has two or more specially prepared layers of semiconductor
    material that produce direct current (DC) electricity when exposed to light. The
    wiring collects this DC in the panel. It is then supplied either to a DC pump,
    which pumps water whenever the sun shines or stored in batteries for later use
    by the pump. This kind of green energy can ensure energy, water, and environmental
    security. The PV system and water pump combination is a necessity, as the solar
    water pump is used widely in agricultural production. PV system does not produce
    any harmful by-products, which cause environmental pollution. Since solar energy
    is not extracted from the earth''s layers, so it will not cause any harmful pollutants
    to the surroundings. The basic working principle of a PV system is that the photovoltaic
    cell converts the solar energy from sunlight to electrical energy that can be
    used to feed loads through the controller, which keeps the battery charging during
    the daytime. The produced energy during the daytime is stored in a battery to
    be used in the nighttime. Solar photovoltaic water pumping system is an ideal
    alternative for electricity, fossil fuel, and diesel-based water pumps. In 1970,
    a study made to explore the economic feasibility and practicality of solar water
    pumps brought some effort. The solar water pump is a combination of a solar photovoltaic
    and pumping system. It involves multidisciplinary areas, including electrical,
    mechanical, electronics, civil, and computer engineering. In the past few decades,
    the world still depends on those limited and non-renewable energy sources which
    take millions of years to replenish. After industrialization, the energy demand
    increased, and the world is facing many environmental problems like acid rain,
    global warming, and greenhouse effects. The global surface temperature is 0.6°
    Celsius higher than the average temperature during 1900–2010 [19]. The main components
    of a solar water pump consist of a solar panel, pump, electric motor, water distribution
    nozzles, water filter, and controller. The electric motor used in the water pump
    is to rotate the pump and manages the AC or DC. Besides, the function of the controller
    in the water pump is to adjust the motor speed and the output power. The solar
    water pump is more efficient and economical than the traditional water pump; it
    is extremely useful for the farmer who works on a small and medium-scale farm.
    This kind of solar water pump is not only used in the crop; it can also be used
    in feeding, gardens, and irrigation. The operation concept of the solar water
    pump is simple, where the solar panel collects the solar energy from the sun and
    converts it into electrical energy through the silicon wafers embedded in the
    solar photovoltaic panel. The electric energy is then transferred to a DC-based
    motor pump system which operates the motor. The motor rotates the shaft, coupled
    to the mono-block pump, and the pump starts lifting the groundwater. There are
    two types of water pumps, which are surface water pumps and submersible water
    pumps. The surface water pump is suitable for lifting and pumping the water from
    a maximum depth of 20 m, while a submersible water pump can be used in an area
    of greater depth of 50 m [20]. In [21], the authors proposed a user-friendly,
    reliable, and automated 3- phase water pump control system based on Wi-Fi to be
    used by farmers. The system includes monitoring electric supply availability,
    the water level inside the reservoir, the water flow rate, and water pump short
    circuit conditions. The NodeMCU ESP8266 is the microcontroller of this system.
    However, system design is very sensitive and should be handled with utmost care
    because the microcontroller is a 5 V device. It is employed to control a high-voltage
    3-phase irrigation pump. Ref. [22] focused on multiple factors that influence
    the PV water pump performance. They claimed that the cell''s temperature, PV module
    degradation, incidence angle, surface dust, and efficiency of the motor pump have
    the most impact on the system performance. In addition, mismatching, self-shading,
    and shadowing are other involved factors that affect the performance of solar-powered
    pumps. In Ref. [23], the authors determined the number of PV modules and the pumping
    power that is required in PV-based water pumps with a battery bank. A comparison
    study between conventional pumps and solar-powered pumps was carried out regarding
    the required cost for installation, operation, maintenance, and total life cycle.
    The results proved that the PV-based water pumps saved a lot of fuel and engine
    oil costs, which results in reducing CO2, air pollution, and noise. The study
    considered other geographical characteristics, flowrate and optimum tilt angle.
    A study in Ref. [24] addressed the simultaneous operation of irrigation areas
    using standalone solar pumps. Such a system entails the direct application of
    the pumped water to the different sectors depending on the reservoir; thus, it
    decreases the total cost and eliminates the evaporation process. The authors developed
    a model based on linear programming. The model operation is based on the required
    water volume and the PV power. The result proved that the simultaneous operation
    of PV-based pumps provided higher efficiency and saved energy compared to the
    individual operation. In Ref. [25], the authors devoted the study to developing
    an IoT-based system for solar water pumping, which can be operated and controlled
    via a vision-based technique using a fuzzy-based algorithm. The system observes
    the soil moisture, temperature, and humidity and runs the pump accordingly. The
    system also supports manual and remote control by the user and controls automatically
    via the Fuzzy-based control mode. Ref. [26] highlighted the design and implementation
    of a water pumping system based on the health of plants. The system model supports
    the automatic start/stop of the electric motor based on water threshold values.
    The study analyzed the sensor data to decide on irrigation time according to plant
    health status with the plant''s threshold value. An emergency notification about
    plant health will be sent to the farmer via email over the IoT platform when needed.
    The farmer also can access information regarding to soil and environment parameters
    including soil pH value and moisture, temperature and flame values through Graphical
    User Interface (GUI) to decide whether the plants need to be irrigated. In this
    regard, PV-based water pumping is among the viable alternatives in irrigation
    systems that have attracted considerable attention and have been deployed in numerous
    remote regions. Such solar-powered pumps can be used in various applications to
    supply water in rural areas ranging from irrigation to livestock. PV-based pumps
    have many features that make them attractive to be a substitute for conventional
    water pumping systems. It is based on green and clean energy without carbon dioxide
    emission (no fossil fuel), eco-friendly, reliable, with no noise, and low cost
    for operation and maintenance. The reported literature proved that solar-powered
    water pumps are more economical and can compete in low pumping capacities than
    conventional fuel-based pumps and wind-powered pumps. Some studies focused on
    the configuration parameters of the water pumping system, and others studied motors
    and pump types based on applications. Some addressed controlling water pumping
    systems, while other studies were devoted to analyzing various economic and environmental
    parameters. Although many solar-powered water pumping systems are already implemented
    in many countries, it still limited to small and medium scales and need to be
    promoted at a large scale. Integration of IoT-control concepts is necessary to
    convince farmers in remote areas to switch their manual/local control pumps with
    the remote IoT-based PV water pumping system. Such an IoT system is required to
    persuade farmers that solar-powered pumps with automation capabilities and real-time
    monitoring are the correct option to reduce production costs, increase irrigation
    efficiency, improve plantation quality, and keep plants safe and healthy. Such
    transformation is necessary for developing nations where agriculture is the main
    activity, and solar irradiance is sufficient throughout the year. Overall, many
    studies instigated solar-powered water pump applications in irrigation systems.
    However, to the best of our knowledge, limited studies focused on developing IoT-based
    smart irrigation using solar-powered water pumping systems. In addition, none
    of the previous studies focused on using a portable PV-based water pump as a standalone
    system in farming activities. Most of the proposed systems were not validated
    in a natural environment, even though they were tested in LABs using simulation
    models or prototypes. Therefore, we developed a portable solar-powered water pump
    with an IoT-enabled controller as an innovative irrigation system in this study.
    The NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller enables users to send commands towards the
    pump according to the collected readings from the sensors. A mobile application
    to monitor the pump and control the system has been created, and it can be used
    from a certain distance with the use of an internet connection. Thus, it can be
    accessed anywhere and anytime when the Internet connection is available. This
    will lessen the burden on the user and increase the efficiency of the water pump.
    For instance, the farmer can start and stop water pumping through the phone without
    being close to the water pump. A mobile application is used to remotely control
    the on-and-off operation of the water pump from smartphones and to monitor the
    surroundings over the Blynk IoT platform. 3. Methods and materials This section
    defines the methods and research activities adopted in this study, including the
    methodical organization of various research phases in conjunction with the detailed
    design and implementation of the proposed solar-powered water pump with the IoT-based
    smart irrigation system. Moreover, the components selection and their integration
    are explained in detail to fulfil the design objectives. A portable solar-powered
    pump for the IoT-based irrigation system was fabricated. The hardware development
    of the IoT-based system was carried out by utilizing the NodeMCU ESP8266 Wi-Fi
    module as a microcontroller, and sensors were selected to measure the considered
    parameters. The relay board has been decided to control the switching process
    of the pump. After that, software was developed by integrating the required sensor
    libraries using Arduino IDE as the interface between the NodeMCU and the programming
    device. The arrangement/sequence of the code must be improved according to the
    thought of the entire water pumping system, whether which sensor runs first and
    then followed by the next sensor with each action once the sensors are triggered.
    The Blynk IoT platform was chosen as the IoT cloud to save the collected data
    updated over Wi-Fi to the Internet. A mobile GUI was designed to display the updated
    readings from the sensor and enable the remote control of the water pump using
    smartphones. The detailed research activities are illustrated in the flowchart
    of Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image (775KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 1. Flowchart of research activities. 3.1. System modelling The proposed
    system architecture of IoT–SIS–SPWP is described in Fig. 2. In the developed system,
    the sun rays are applied on two solar panels (50 W each) to generate the electrical
    power used to power the high-pressure auto diaphragm water pump with the DC motor
    set. The extra energy will be stored in the 12 V battery through the solar charger
    controller. The battery used is a Panasonic lead-acid 12 V, 7.5 Ah battery that
    copes with the micro diaphragm water pump. The battery capacity can supply electricity
    to the motor for up to 3 h whenever required during night irrigation activities.
    The microcontroller collects the data from the utilized sensors and sends it to
    the Blynk IoT cloud server over the Wi-Fi interface of the NodeMCU and, at the
    same time, forwards the farmer''s switching commands to the SPWP. The NodeMCU
    connects to the Internet via the nearest Wi-Fi access point. The farmer will be
    able to remotely monitor the surrounding conditions in the farm (soil moisture,
    temperature, and humidity) using the GUI based on the Blynk mobile application
    through Internet-connected smartphones. The sensors are connected to the input
    GPIOs of NodeMCU, and a four-channel relay module is connected to the output GPIOs.
    The farmer also can receive notifications for abnormal conditions via the same
    app. when some threshold values are exceeded. Download : Download high-res image

    Accordingly, the farmer can switch ON/OFF the solar-powered water pump for irrigation
    purposes when needed. The DC pump is a water-pressure diaphragm pump of 12 V,
    8 A, and 100 W. The maximum output water pressure is 0.8 MPa with a maximum flow
    rate of 6.5 L per minute. The pump is connected to a hose pipe with multi-nozzles
    to spry the water during the irrigation process at different pressure and flow
    rates. Also, the pump is coupled with a water filter to improve the irrigation
    water quality for keeping plants healthy and in good condition. The mobility support
    of the system allows its movement and reallocation based on demand. 3.2. System
    design The IoT–SIS–SPWP system layout has been designed using NX10, as shown in
    Fig. 3. The parts or components of the SPWP are a polypropylene luggage toolbox
    (the overall body), two solar panels 50 W, a hose pipe''s hook, an extendable
    holder, and a cover box to store electrical components of the IoT-SIS, metal support,
    battery, and water pump. It also shows the dimension of the overall parts of the
    IoT–SIS–SPWP. We aim to build an ergonomic design of a solar water pump to fit
    the people who use this water pump. Proper ergonomic design is necessary to prevent
    repetitive strain injuries and other musculoskeletal disorders. It is relevant
    in designing such things as safe furniture and easy-to-use interfaces. The solar
    water pump is more compactable and lightweight. The luggage design makes this
    water pump portable, and the size is ergonomic and suitable for smallholder irrigation.
    The design of this portable solar water pump is inspired by wheeled travel luggage.

    Fig. 3. System design dimensions. The designed IoT–SIS–SPWP system will be used
    in the area alienated from the electricity grid. The implementation of solar power
    would reduce energy costs such as fuel and electricity. The usage of solar power
    benefits long-term savings, but it also promotes the usage of renewable energy
    and reduces pollution. However, the usage of solar energy has a major challenge
    which is theft. Making the system portable is beneficial as it could be transported
    anywhere and stored safely in storage. The water pump body is made of polypropylene.
    Polypropylene is a rugged and highly chemical-resistant material often used as
    material for toolboxes. It has similar properties to polyethylene but is more
    challenging and more heat resistant. Durable and lightweight making it suitable
    for encasing electrical equipment in a work environment with additional resistance
    to chemicals, making it suitable for usage in the marine environment. It is also
    heat resistant, which makes it suitable for usage under prolonged sunlight. Polypropylene
    seems to be destined to increase its importance as raw material for the production
    of plastics due to its excellent thermal and mechanical properties, low cost,
    and versatility of uses. For the hose, we use Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) garden
    hose with polyester fibre reinforcement. This hose has excellent chemical and
    physical properties, very ideal for conveying water, widely used in construction,
    agriculture, fishery, project, household, and industrial service. It could handle
    temperatures ranging from −10 °C to +65 °C. PVC hose also has good abrasion resistance
    making it suitable for a rugged environment. Since there are many types of hose
    based on oil-resistant elastomers and many specifications for each type, sometimes
    with conflicting requirements, it is impossible to generalize regarding current
    uses or future trends. PVC blends are used in covers when excellent abrasion resistance
    is required. We use a portable water filter with hollow fibre membranes (HFMs)
    as filter material for water filtration. HFM was initially developed in the 1960s
    for reverse osmosis applications; it has become prevalent in water treatment.
    HFM could ensure that no pathogens can slip through removing substances such as
    Bacteria, Protozoa, E. Coli, Giardia, Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella Typhi, Leptospirosis,
    and microplastics. The amount of solar energy collected by a solar panel is a
    function of local solar radiation, ground reflection property, and collecting
    a panel''s tilt and orientation. The orientation and the tilt of a solar panel
    strongly affect the amount of the collected yield. Therefore, solar panels must
    be slanted and oriented at optimum angles to collect the maximum solar energy
    available in a specific region. The best method to optimize the tilt and the orientation
    of a solar panel is by applying an active sun tracker. Active sun trackers are
    electromechanical or pure mechanical devices that keep changing the tilt and the
    orientation of a solar panel/solar array periodically during the day. However,
    the capital cost of such a system is high, and it consumes energy during tracking.
    Thus, changing the tilt angle and the orientation monthly, seasonal, or yearly
    for a photovoltaic (PV) panel, as in our system, maybe more feasible than applying
    an active sun tracker. 3.3. System fabrication After the design phase, we started
    the fabrication and installation phase of the portable solar water pump since
    it is the central part of the proposed system. Besides that, the structural analysis
    is compulsory to ensure that this design can support all the load weight. Next,
    the type of material used to build the water pump frame is identified and obtained
    from the supplier. After that, the inspection was conducted immediately after
    the material was received to avoid any defects happening. The overall fabrication
    process sequence is illustrated in Fig. 4. Basic manufacturing processes, including
    welding, grinding, cutting, and many others, have their safety precautions. Extreme
    caution should be exercised when using any tool to prevent injury to personnel.
    While working in a machines room, rules and regulations need to be obeyed for
    our safety. Safety measures need to be taken into account at our workplace are
    likes wearing safety boots, jackets, face shields, and gloves when handling tools
    and machines. The machinist should not wear a watch, jewellery, other accessories,
    or loose clothes that can cause trouble to them when handling the machine. Every
    different type of operation on machines must be conducted followed by the correct
    procedure and tools to avoid accidents happening in the machine room. The floor
    must always dry to avoid slipperiness, and the table must be cleaned repeatedly.
    For metal support, firstly, the mild steel bar is cut into four parts. Then, the
    metal bar edges are ground and polished using a grinder and sander. The metal
    was then welded together and fitted onto the luggage box using a drill and rivet.

    Fig. 4. System fabrication phases. For PV panels, two PV panels are attached using
    screws and hinges, and a slider is attached on the top and bottom of the solar
    panel. Then, sheet metal is sheared and bent using a shearing machine and press
    brakes. The PV Panels, sheet metal, and luggage box are attached using screws,
    rivets, and L-section. Then, the placements of the filter and pump and the box
    containing microcontrollers, as shown in Fig. 5. Then, the solar controller and
    hose hanger are attached to the solar water pump sides, as shown in Fig. 6. For
    final adjustment, L-section is attached to parts for durability. Latches are added
    to the solar panel to avoid turning when transporting. Fig. 7 depicts the finished
    system product of the solar-powered water pump with the implemented IoT-SIS controller.

    Components selection Hardware and software components are crucial and essential
    in the design of IoT systems. NodeMCU ESP8266 is used in our system as it is a
    single-board microcontroller intended to make the application of interactive objects
    or environments more accessible. It is a cost-effective and open-source physical
    computing platform with an extensible software development environment for board
    programming. It is used to gather data read by the sensors and upload the data
    to the MQTT server. Besides, it also receives commands given by the user to do
    specific tasks via the MQTT server. NodeMCU consists of a physical programmable
    circuit board like any other development board, such as Arduino and Raspberry
    Pi. This microcontroller can be used to develop interactive objects, taking inputs
    from various switches or sensors and controlling a variety of relays, lights,
    motors, and other actuators. We use NodeMCU ESP8266 as the microcontroller to
    enable farmers to observe sensor readings and pass the command towards the water
    pump. The NodeMCU is attached with a Wi-Fi interface to be connected to the Internet
    via a hotspot. NodeMCU has 17 GPIO pins that can be allocated to different functions
    such as I2C, I2S, UART, PWM, IR remote control, LED light, and button programmatically.
    Thus, it is a good candidate for IoT applications with a limited number of sensors
    and actuators like our system. NodeMCU has a ready-to-use structure as it comes
    in a complete package form, including the 5 V regulator, a burner, an oscillator,
    a micro-controller, a serial communication interface, LED, and headers for the
    connections. The programming of the NodeMCU can be done by using Arduino software,
    an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), to write the code of instructions
    and upload it to the microcontroller. For NodeMCU, a beginner would need to learn
    a new programming method different from Arduino but much easier. This is because
    the programming environment is easy to use for beginners yet flexible enough for
    advanced users to take advantage of. The required coding to initiate the connection
    between NodeMCU, sensors, and actuators can be developed via Arduino IDE and uploaded
    to the NodeMCU memory. It represents the heart of IoT systems since it acts as
    a sensing node and a gateway simultaneously. We have used the Wi-Fi module to
    create a mobile application to remotely control the water pump on and off operation
    from smartphones. A mobile application to monitor and control the system has been
    created. It can be used from anywhere and anytime over an internet connection.
    The real-time monitoring and control will lessen the user''s burden and increase
    the efficiency of the water pump. Soil moisture sensor measures the water content
    in the soil. The relation between the measured property and soil moisture must
    be calibrated and may vary on environmental factors such as soil type, temperature,
    or electric conductivity. Reflected microwave radiation is affected by soil moisture
    and is used for remote sensing in hydrology and agriculture. Farmers or gardeners
    can use portable probe instruments. Soil moisture sensors typically refer to sensors
    that estimate volumetric water content. Another class of sensors measures another
    property of moisture in soils called water potential. The FC-28 soil moisture
    sensor is mounted at the side of the system to measure the soil moisture at the
    farm. This module also includes a potentiometer that will fix the threshold value,
    & the comparator-LM393 can evaluate the value. The LED will turn on/off based
    on the threshold value. The sensor needs to be placed into the soil, and the measurement
    of the soil moisture will be exposed and then data uploaded to the Blynk application.
    DHT11 is a primary, ultra-low-cost digital temperature and humidity sensor. It
    uses a capacitive humidity sensor and a thermistor to measure the surrounding
    air and spits a digital signal on the data pin (no analogue input pins are needed).
    It is relatively simple to use but requires careful timing to grab data. The only
    real downside of this sensor is that it can only update new data once every 2
    s. The sensor is utilized in our system to measure the surrounding temperature
    and humidity. DHT11 with its jumpers are mounted at the side of the prototype,
    upper the toolbox in a drilled hole. Thus, the DHT11 sensor can be exposed to
    the surrounding temperature and measured to be uploaded to the Blynk application.
    DHT11 sensor has four pins- VCC, GND, Data Pin, and a not connected pin. A pull-up
    resistor of 5 k to 10 k ohms is provided for communication between the sensor
    and the microcontroller. A 4-channel 5 V DC relay module is exploited in this
    study to perform the switching of the pump and any other actuators if necessary.
    It can also be used to control various appliances and equipment with a large current.
    The relay is energized or reenergized based on the received signals from the NodeMCU
    depending on the farmer''s commands. It is equipped with high-current relays that
    work under AC 250 V 10 A or DC 30 V 10 A. It has a standard interface that can
    be controlled directly by the microcontroller. The Arduino IDE is a cross-platform
    application that is written in the C++ programming language. It is used to write
    and upload programs to Arduino-compatible boards, but also with the help of third-party
    cores, and other vendor development boards. It connects to the Arduino and Genuino
    hardware to upload programs and communicate with them. Support for third-party
    hardware can be added to the hardware directory of the sketchbook directory. Platforms
    installed may include board definitions (which appear in the board menu), core
    libraries, bootloaders, and programmer definitions. Coding for this project has
    included all types of sensors, including DHT11 sensors and soil moisture sensors.
    The specific library of all these sensors has been applied to ensure all the sensor
    is working correctly. Next, the ESP8266 NodeMCU''s library has been included in
    the program for the communication feature between the user and the microcontroller
    system. AT command has been used as the tool to send feedback and receive a command
    from the user. 3.5. Circuit design and installation As stated earlier, the proposed
    solar-powered water pump has been fabricated—this phase is devoted to the description
    of hardware and software development of the proposed IoT-SIS system. The selected
    electrical/electronic components need to be connected to form the control circuit
    installed in the controller box of the developed IoT–SIS–SPWP. This control circuit
    will be used to monitor and control the fabricated solar-powered water pump over
    the Internet. The control circuit is installed into the controller box after finishing
    the testing and verification. Before that, all components are connected according
    to the schematic diagram as shown in Fig. 8, which also illustrates the virtual
    connection of electrical components using Fritzing software. Download : Download

    of the system. Then the components are installed on the breadboard to confirm
    that the circuit works correctly before finalizing the connections and attaching
    them to the entire system. As shown in Fig. 9, the developed IoT control system
    of the solar-powered DC water pump motor set is equipped with a 5 V power source,
    NodeMCU ESP 8266 Wi-Fi module, soil moisture sensor, temperature/humidity sensor,
    and relays. After successfully testing each component individually, all the components
    were assembled and connected to the NodeMCU. The required coding has been developed
    using Arduino IDE. LED was used as the replacement for the actual pump to check
    sensor functionality. During this phase, many tests have been conducted, and improvements
    have been suggested when necessary. The errors and problems that we faced during
    the testing procedure were identified and fixed. This step was repeated until
    a successful product was obtained. After compiling all the programming codes into
    the NodeMCU, the actuators (relay module and DC motor) were used for the practical
    testing by implementing the circuit to the proposed system, as shown in Fig. 10.
    A GUI based on the Blynk IoT platform has been developed to display the gathered
    information from sensors and allow the farmer to control the water pump using
    a smartphone. Download : Download high-res image (167KB) Download : Download full-size

    image (381KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10. Installation of all
    components in the controller box. As an example of the improvement and optimization
    process, initially, the reading from the sensors was unable to be uploaded to
    the Blynk application server. The reading can only be viewed on the serial monitor
    of the Arduino IDE software. The relay module could only switch on/off by the
    sensors themselves when a certain requirement was triggered. After some reconstruction
    of the coding, the reading obtained from the sensors could be updated on the IoT
    server. The problem of uploading and fetching the data was solved, but the relays
    were acting the opposite way from the user''s command. When the user remoted the
    relay to turn on via mobile apps or pc, the relay was turned off instead. Hence,
    the coding for receiving the command from the server for turning on/off the relay
    was remodified. The portable solar water pump was placed in the direction that
    sunlight incident directly on the solar panel. The solar water pump was connected
    and controlled by the application on the mobile phone. 3.6. System operational
    procedure The temperature and humidity sensor and soil moisture sensor send the
    collected data directly to the microcontroller via the connected wires. The NodeMCU
    receives and uploads data to the Blynk server using the Wi-Fi module. After the
    program coding was uploaded in the NodeMCU, the data can be accessed using any
    device, mainly smartphones with Internet access in this case. In our coding, we
    have developed an algorithm to gather the information from the sensors and passed
    to the cloud as in Algorithm 1. The system operates based on the developed coding
    in the microcontroller. The water pump is set to turn on using Blynk mobile application.
    The sensor readings would be detected and set up in the coding to measure the
    surrounding of the farm and the operation hour of the water pump. According to
    the Blynk application, the readings of moisture, temperature, and humidity will
    be displayed based on the unit decided by the user. The farmer will observe the
    sensors'' readings in real-time, and according to predefined threshold values,
    he will be able to decide whether to switch on/off the water pump. The IoT server
    will receive the command from the Blynk GUI on the farmer''s smartphone or the
    Blynk homepage and send the command to the microcontroller to switch on/off the
    water pump using the application. It will be sent to the microcontroller to switch
    on the relays. Thus, the water pump status and the reading of sensors are displayed
    on the application to check the farm''s surroundings or where the testing took
    place. If the relay is energized, the water pump will be switched on. Then, the
    water flow starts from the pump to the filter and next to the irrigation system
    as planned. When the user presses the switch-off button on the GUI, the water
    pump will be turned off. Algorithm 1 Monitoring and control algorithm for IoT–SIS–SPWP

    4. Experimental results and validation The SPWP-IoT-SIS system has been designed
    and fabricated, as stated in the previous section. In this section, the system''s
    functionality and performance will be tested and evaluated. We have conducted
    practical experiments in two different environments to evaluate multiple criteria,
    including water quality, flow rate, energy consumption, and IoT system functionality.
    We have successfully tested the developed system in both offsite and onsite testing
    in this context. The offsite testing was held at the LAB and workshop, while the
    onsite testing was held at UMP Pilot Fertigation Farm. Before starting the system
    development, a site visit was conducted to obtain information regarding the farm.
    Our system prototype could be deployed at the farm to check its applicability
    and compatibility in real environments. From the site visit, we get information
    on the coverage area of the farm, the fertigation way that is used at the farm,
    the quantity of the plants on the farm, the type of water pumping system used
    in the farm, and the system operation hour. Since our system composes several
    main components including a solar panel, DC motor, water pump, water filter, irrigation
    nozzles, and IoT-system components, several tests were conducted. 4.1. Experimental
    setup The proposed SPWP-IoT-SIS system was placed at the UMP Pilot Fertigation
    Farm during the onsite testing phase, as shown in Fig. 11. The University Malaysia
    Pahang (Gambang area) latitude is 3°43′23 North, and the longitude is 103°7′16
    East. The system is powered on and connected to the Internet via a Wi-Fi access
    point. The DC water pump was connected to the solar panel. After attaching the
    inlet port of the pump with a suction pipe, priming was done. The inlet port of
    the solar water pump was connected to the water pump in the irrigation system
    of the Fertigation Farm. Another hose pipe was attached to the end of the outlet
    of the water pump. After that, the solar water pump was switched on via the Blynk
    GUI by using the mobile phone. Download : Download high-res image (757KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 11. Onsite system setup. 4.2. Power and water
    flow rate comparison In the first step, we have devoted our focus to determining
    and comparing the generated power from the solar panel with respect to irradiance
    for different water flow rates of the pump. The system has two solar panels with
    50 Watts per panel. In the onsite testing and offsite system testing, the proposed
    solar water pump performance has been observed, measured, and evaluated. The voltage,
    current, and power consumed by the water pump and the flow rate of the water pump
    were measured and recorded. The DC water pump is designed on the basic requirement
    of the agriculture product. The power of the pump is obtained from Eq. (1): (1)
    P o w e r c o n s u m e d b y p u m p ( W ) , P = V × I where V is the DC voltage,
    I is the current, and P is the power of the water pump. As stated earlier, our
    SPWP is attached with multi-nozzles to control the water flow rate and a filter
    for purifying the irrigation water. Such features enable our system to conveniently
    cover a wider area and diverse plants using a portable pump. The system can pump
    the water at different flow rates using six nozzles: cone, quad, fan, flat, soaker,
    and jet. Each nozzle type has a different water flow rate and required a specific
    amount of power. Water was discharged, and its volume was measured to determine
    the water flow rate according to Eq. (2), where 6 L of water are collected, and
    the time taken to collect the water is estimated. (2) F l o w r a t e , Q = w
    a t e r d i s c h a r g e d ( l i t r e s ) t i m e t a k e n ( min ) The six
    types of nozzles'' performance are analyzed in terms of flow rate, voltage, and
    power. The data is collected and tabulated to compare the voltage, power, irradiance,
    and flow rate of six different types of nozzles, as listed in Table 1. The obtained
    results for the voltage measurements are between 11.0 V and 11.8 V, while the
    current is between 6.8 and 7.3 A. The power is roughly between 74.8 W and 86 Watts.
    The difference between the highest value and the lowest value for the voltage,
    current, and power readings is typically based on the different irradiance received
    by the panel during each nozzle type and the impact of the flow rate of each nozzle.
    From the table, it can be seen that the voltage and the power for the cone nozzle
    are the highest compared to the other five nozzles. The voltage, current, and
    power for the cone nozzle are 11.8 V, 7.3 A, and 86.14 W, respectively. This data
    proves that the solar panel absorbs more sunlight irradiance, thus providing more
    voltage, current, and power than the other five nozzles. While for the jet nozzle,
    the electrical parameters have the lowest readings compared to the other nozzles.
    The voltage, current, and power readings are 11.0 V, 6.8 A, and 74.8 W. This data
    proves that the solar panel absorbs less sunlight and provides less voltage, current,
    and power compared to the other five nozzles, as shown clearly in Fig. 12. Table

    solar irradiance on SPWP electrical parameters. Based on the trend of the growth
    data of the irradiance reading, as the solar irradiance increases, the power generated
    by the solar panel will be higher and more power will be supplied to the water
    pump with different nozzles. Fig. 13 depicts the comparison between the electrical
    power supplied by the solar panel to the water pump and the water flow rate for
    different nozzle types. Download : Download high-res image (347KB) Download :
    Download full-size image Fig. 13. Power vs. water flow rate for various nozzle
    types. The experiment is conducted in the afternoon from 13.00 until 17.00, which
    has more sunlight. The flow rate of the water pump is measured in L/min. The water
    pump''s discharge was measured by a volumetric method by collecting 6 L of water
    in a container. The subsequent time taken to fill up the container was recorded
    using a stopwatch. The same was repeated for the other five nozzles, and the average
    of all the nozzles was considered. As shown in the figure, the maximum flow rate
    has occurred with the cone nozzle, which is 4.20 L/min due to the highest generated
    voltage by the panel, 11.8 V. The cone nozzle required 1.43 min to discharge 6-Liter
    water. This flow rate indicates that the solar panel supplied more power to the
    cone nozzle causing the cone nozzle to have the highest flow rate. However, the
    jet nozzle has the minimum flow rate among the six nozzles, due to there being
    slightly unstable voltage causing less power to be used by the jet nozzle. The
    jet nozzle required 2.00 min to discharge 6 L of water. Hence, the flow rate for
    the jet nozzle is 3.00 L/min. From the graph, it can be concluded that the higher
    the power supplied to each type of nozzle, the lesser time is used to discharge
    the water, and the higher the flow rate can be achieved. The second highest flow
    rate occurred with the soaker nozzle, which required 1.45 min to discharge the
    6 L of water. Hence the flow rate for the soaker nozzle is 4.14 L/min. The flow
    rate for the soaker nozzle is very close to the cone nozzle. These values prove
    that the power supplied to both the cone nozzle and soaker nozzle is almost the
    same. The supplied power is stable for the cone nozzle and soaker nozzle. 4.3.
    IoT–SIS–SPWP validation The IoT–SIS–SPWP system allows the user to remotely control
    the solar-powered water pump for irrigation using an Internet-connected smartphone.
    The Blynk IoT platform has been integrated into the mobile irrigation application,
    and a developed dashboard can be used to monitor and control the proposed system.
    The Blynk application allows the user to monitor soil moisture, temperature, and
    humidity. It also enables the remote control of the SPWP over the Internet at
    any time from anywhere. Fig. 14 depicts the developed GUI that we initially used
    to control the water pump over IoT and monitor the surroundings in the farm during
    the onsite testing. Download : Download high-res image (185KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 14. Blynk GUI dashboard. This GUI has been developed and
    integrated into the Arduino IDE coding uploaded to the t NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller.
    Such GUI can be improved and expanded by including more widgets and indicators
    for any suggested improvements like adding more sensors for monitoring (raindrop
    and flow rate) or more actuators to control the solenoid valve. The data measured
    from the soil moisture sensor and temperature & humidity sensor can be obtained
    in the Blynk application. The application is synchronized and displays readings
    that are uploaded by the NodeMCU microcontroller in the IoT–SIS–SPWP system. The
    soil moisture sensor will detect the soil moisture on the farm to notify the user
    to turn on the water pump according to the soil moisture condition. The same goes
    for the temperature & humidity sensor to detect the surrounding places for the
    user to turn on and off the water pump at the farm. The data readings of the sensors
    are displayed in real-time. The user needs to install the Blynk App. which is
    compatible with Android and iOS operating systems of smartphones. It can be downloaded
    from the Apps stores of any mobile phone. The application''s name is “Blynk,”
    which is synchronized with the IoT server Blynk account. During the synchronization
    process, the targeted server address is required, followed by the host port, the
    username, and the specified authentication token given by the server. Onetime
    information regarding the hotspot will be configured in the coding to connect
    the system to the Internet. As the device is connected to the Internet, the Blynk
    application is started up. All the readings and buttons of the GUI could be viewed
    and activated. The water pump switch icons would turn green whenever the system
    was turned on, while the icon turned black would indicate the water pump was off.
    From the figure, three displayed blocks could be found with some values. Those
    blocks were the place where the data from the sensors would be uploaded. The humidity
    and soil moisture value displayed is in percentage while the temperature is in
    °C . The system functionality and performance have been validated. After completing
    the onsite testing of our system, we have done some improvements and optimization
    based on the recommendation and suggestions by UMP Pilot Fertigation Farm management.
    We have implemented one more sensor for raindrop detection in our system, and
    we have modified the coding and Blynk GUI accordingly. Implementing such a sensor
    is to increase the data reliability of other sensors that are almost related to
    each other, including moisture, raindrop, temperature, and humidity. Since our
    system is a part of an ongoing research project, the expansion and improvements
    based on feedback from the industry and society are considered. The current version
    of our system is still being improved to be implemented in a Palm Oil Farm in
    collaboration with the industry. The updated Blynk GUI is shown in Fig. 15. We
    can monitor more surrounding conditions, and notification functionality has been
    enabled. Download : Download high-res image (722KB) Download : Download full-size

    This study designed and fabricated a solar-powered and portable water pump with
    an IoT-controlled irrigation system, where sensors collect information about moisture,
    humidity, and temperature together for efficient monitoring and water pumping
    via a mobile application. We have considered several limitations in the conventional
    water pump to be solved in the proposed system: cost-effectiveness, saving energy,
    supporting pump mobility, facilitating remote monitoring and operation, and enabling
    IoT solutions in agriculture. For the coexistence of different microcontrollers
    used by various applications, we have selected the NodeMCU due to its low price,
    small size, low energy consumption, and good performance with Wi-Fi support. In
    addition, select the open-source Blynk IoT platform with a mobile application
    to receive the collected data from sensors and store it in the cloud. The developed
    portable solar water pump can efficiently use a renewable energy resource and
    be controlled remotely using smartphones. Six types of nozzles have been tested
    and evaluated regarding the implemented system''s consumed energy and flow rate
    in a real environment. The cone nozzle has the highest power and flow rate among
    the six nozzles, while the jet nozzle has the lowest power and flow rate. Furthermore,
    the exploited water filter succeeds in filtering the pumped water for irrigation
    purposes. Since this paper is a part of an ongoing project, in the future, more
    functionalities will be enabled, such as pump automation based on the sensor readings.
    More sensors can be added to monitor more irrigation-related parameters, such
    as water quality sensors, GPS, flow rate, and light sensors. Furthermore, the
    developed Blynk-based dashboard can be extended by adding more gadgets and indicators.
    In this project, there are some limitations found during the testing phase. The
    circuit system requires a stable network connection. Whenever NodeMCU is disconnected
    from the network, it will try to reconnect the network. However, if the network
    is disconnected, the system will not be functioning. Thus, the utilization of
    long-range communication technology is among the considered improvements in our
    system in the nearest future. Besides that, the prototype''s weight is unfulfilled
    to the target. The heavyweight could be due to the implemented two solar panels
    to supply more power to the system during the day activities and store some energy
    in the battery. However, the system''s portability has decreased the weight effects
    and can be easily moved within the deployment site. Other than that, the system
    needs to be more automated to switch on/off the pump and the valve based on threshold
    values rather than remote control by the farmer. For example, we did not set a
    specific range of optimum temperature and humidity values of the surrounding;
    thus, we would not receive any notifications via the mobile application to activate
    the water pumping system. Therefore, a fully automated irrigation system with
    a minimum of manual requirements will be among our future works. Declaration of

    \ context of smart city construction, the changes brought by the smart system\
    \ to the city are not only material\nintelligence, but also because the smart\
    \ system is completed by the cooperation of human wisdom and the wisdom of things,\
    \ it\nis even more enhanced. There are various connections between people and\
    \ people and cities. In this paper, the construction of\nurban parks, its management,\
    \ and service requirements also show a trend of diversiﬁed development. However,\
    \ some\ntraditional urban parks cannot meet the new social needs. The application\
    \ of smart park systems in their renovation is an\nimportant way for urban parks\
    \ to rejuvenate and is an indispensable part of smart city construction. For urban\
    \ parks, the\nupgrade of smartization in the traditional park model is not only\
    \ an inevitable trend in the development of information\ntechnology but also an\
    \ important direction for the future construction of parks. The purpose of this\
    \ paper is to study and\ndiscuss the systematic methods applied by the smart park\
    \ system in the renovation and renewal of urban parks, to discuss the\ncommon\
    \ problems and solutions faced in the renovation and renewal of urban parks today,\
    \ and to realize the renovation of\nthe smart park system of urban parks. And\

    \ Park and the interpretation of the existing problems, special transformation\
    \ is carried out under\nthe guidance of the smart park system according to the\
    \ existing problems, and the methods and systems of the application of\nthe smart\
    \ park system are summarized through practice. From a practical point of view,\
    \ the update design strategy proposed\nin this paper is tested.\n1. Introduction\n\
    Many cities take the construction of smart cities as a strate-\ngic choice for\
    \ transformation and development, setting oﬀ a\nboom in the construction of smart\
    \ cities [1]. With the rapid\ndevelopment of new-generation information technologies\n\
    such as the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, and cloud\ncomputing, as well\
    \ as their wide application in smart city\nconstruction, the management and service\
    \ needs of urban\nparks also show a trend of diversiﬁed development. The\nfunctional\
    \ layout, management methods, and service activi-\nties of many traditional urban\
    \ parks today cannot fully meet\nthe various needs of the current information\
    \ age [2]. How to\nmaintain urban green space such as urban parks can adapt\n\
    to the development of the age of wisdom, meet the current\nneeds of urban managers\
    \ and residents, and exert greater\necological beneﬁts are issues that need special\
    \ attention in\nthe development of urban parks. To become an indispens-\nable\
    \ part of smart city construction, the construction of\nurban parks must rely\
    \ on scientiﬁc and technological means\nto realize smart management and smart\
    \ services through the\nconstruction of smart park systems [3]. The goal of smart\n\
    operation and smart facilities is to lay a solid foundation\nfor the sustainable\
    \ development of urban parks.\nDue to changes in the society and environment,\
    \ our\nlandscape types have also become complex and diverse.\nHowever, because\
    \ the development of landscape architecture\ninformation technology in China is\
    \ relatively backward, the\ntheoretical system of digital chemistry has not yet\
    \ been\nformed, and the platform is weak, resulting in a lower\nHindawi\nJournal\
    \ of Sensors\nVolume 2023, Article ID 9188907, 13 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2023/9188907\n\
    threshold for the landscape architecture industry [4]. The\nmastery level is uneven,\
    \ the theory is not solid, the practical\nexperience is not rich enough, and there\
    \ is a lack of software\ntechnical talents. In addition, the project construction\
    \ period\nis generally shortened, and the designers cannot be like the\nancient\
    \ gardeners [5]. After the garden is completed and\nlanded, it will be continuously\
    \ adjusted through long-term\nobservation experience, so that the garden landscape\
    \ will\nreach a near-perfect state. Therefore, if we want to make\ngood use of\
    \ the beneﬁts of the development of the times\nand follow the pace of the times,\
    \ we should give priority to\nthe use of digital technology and the participation\
    \ of multi-\ndisciplinary professionals to help designers optimize the\ndesign\
    \ and make the landscape more scientiﬁc and ecologi-\ncal. The application of\
    \ smart park systems can greatly satisfy\nurban residents’ [6] travel needs. The\
    \ application of the\nsmart park system enables urban parks not only to better\n\
    play traditional functions such as ecological protection and\nscientiﬁc propaganda\
    \ and education but also to enhance\nthe landscape interaction of urban parks,\
    \ to use digital infor-\nmation technology to make the relationship between urban\n\
    parks and urban residents closer, to achieve the harmonious\ncoexistence of man\
    \ and nature, and to enhance the image of\nthe city and the happiness of residents’\
    \ life.\nThe connection between urban parks and urban resi-\ndents is very close,\
    \ and excellent urban parks can greatly\nimprove the quality of life of urban\
    \ residents. After decades\nof construction, development, management, and operation,\n\
    many urban parks have become indispensable green spaces\nin cities [7]. In view\
    \ of the problem that some traditional\nurban parks cannot meet the needs of current\
    \ urban resi-\ndents in a timely manner, these urban parks need to be\nupgraded\
    \ and updated intelligently to enhance the vitality\nof urban parks and to create\
    \ smart parks that meet the back-\nground of smart city construction. By applying\
    \ the smart\npark system to the renovation and reconstruction of some\ntraditional\
    \ urban parks, the image and service level of urban\nparks can be greatly improved\
    \ [8]. Therefore, this paper is\ndevoted to the research on the speciﬁc application\
    \ and\napproach of smart park system in the process of urban park\nrenovation\
    \ and renewal and to design smart garden system\nbased on wireless sensor technology\
    \ [9]. Introduce the smart\npark system into the development process of the renovation\n\
    and reconstruction of the park and build an urban smart\npark that provides residents\
    \ with a comfortable green space\nexperience and provides an intelligent operation\
    \ and man-\nagement model for the city park management department.\n2. Related\
    \ Works\nAt present, with the eﬀective development and continuous\nprogress of\
    \ social economy, modern science and technology\nhave made more achievements,\
    \ and the development of\nwireless sensor networks has become more mature. Because\n\
    the wireless sensor network itself has many advantages such\nas low cost and low\
    \ energy consumption, its application\nscope in the ﬁeld of environmental monitoring\
    \ is gradually\nexpanding, and good application results have been achieved.\n\
    Cheng and Wu proposed that through the investigation and\nanalysis of the actual\
    \ application of wireless sensor networks\nin environmental monitoring, it is\
    \ found that the hardware\nresources of wireless sensor networks are limited,\
    \ and the\nwireless sensor nodes will be aﬀected by the energy con-\nsumption\
    \ of the body and the storage space in the process\nof environmental monitoring\
    \ [10]. The power consumption\nof related equipment is relatively large. If the\
    \ wireless sensor\nresources are limited and the battery cannot be replaced in\n\
    time, the overall eﬀect of environmental monitoring will be\naﬀected. Harfouche\
    \ et al. pointed out that the improvement\nof network monitoring data reliability\
    \ provides a guarantee.\nIn such systems, the construction of the system generally\n\
    includes sensor nodes, routers, gateways, and supervision\ncenters [11]. Among\
    \ them, the sensor nodes include data\nmonitoring nodes and aggregation nodes,\
    \ which are mainly\nresponsible for the data collection and transmission. The\n\
    router is responsible for the communication gateway\nbetween the supervision center\
    \ and the information collec-\ntion point based on a speciﬁc routing protocol\
    \ and is respon-\nsible for transmitting the received data to the supervision\n\
    center. The data storage center and the remote control cen-\nter are responsible\
    \ for storing monitoring data and sending\ncontrol commands, respectively. Overall,\
    \ the wireless sensor\nnetwork is a dynamic network system. The sensor nodes can\n\
    move freely. When the battery energy is used up or the node\nis disconnected from\
    \ the network due to the failure of the\nnode, it will also join the network due\
    \ to the needs of net-\nwork work. Bredikhin et al. pointed out that the network\n\
    can carry out eﬀective analysis and processing under certain\nlimited conditions\
    \ and clarify its speciﬁc request quantity,\nwhich is the energy eﬃciency of the\
    \ wireless sensor network.\nThe energy eﬃciency of wireless sensor networks is\
    \ also one\nof the most important and critical performance criteria in\nwireless\
    \ sensor networks [12].\nThe research on smart gardens is mainly divided into\n\
    two parts: theoretical research and applied research. In terms\nof theoretical\
    \ research, Bakshi and Charles proposed that the\ncurrent main digital design\
    \ methods are sorted out, and a\npreliminary and relatively accurate concept of\
    \ digital plan-\nning and design of landscape architecture is made [13]. In\n\
    the lineage delineation, the ﬁrst is the computer-aided design\nlineage, the second\
    \ is the digital design media and informa-\ntion management lineage, and the third\
    \ is the digital infor-\nmation model of landscape architecture. The computer-\n\
    aided design spectrum includes computer-aided design and\nanalysis, computer-generated\
    \ design, and parametric design.\nComputer-aided design is to carry out targeted\
    \ analysis of\nsite conditions and project requirements at the beginning\nof the\
    \ design according to the results of investigation and\ninspection and convert\
    \ this information into computer-\nidentiﬁable digital information for further\
    \ processing in\nother computer-aided design tools. Computer-aided evalua-\ntion\
    \ is to evaluate and judge the plan according to speciﬁc\nstandards after the\
    \ preliminary design plan is formed, ana-\nlyze the advantages and disadvantages,\
    \ and provide possible\ndirections for the modiﬁcation of the plan. Monteiro et\
    \ al.\npointed out that computer-generated design, using compu-\ntational geometry\
    \ and algorithm generation technology,\ngenerates dynamic and beautiful formal\
    \ structures, analyzes\n2\nJournal of Sensors\nthe dynamic evolution of landscape\
    \ architecture, analyzes\nthe spatial activities of creatures in the habitat,\
    \ including\nhuman beings, and is also used to predict the changing trend\nof\
    \ ecological environment metabolism [14]. It can also per-\nform architectural\
    \ and spatial scale layout, road generation,\nand sculpture creation. Parametric\
    \ design can temporarily\nbe understood as parametric modeling. A geometric model\n\
    controlled by speciﬁc parameters is established on a software\nplatform with parametric\
    \ functions. After the geometric\nmodel passes the design evaluation stage, the\
    \ evaluation\ninformation is fed back to the parameterization in the form\nof\
    \ parameters. The software platform is further optimized.\nIn the application\
    \ research section, A. Atilgan and C. Atilgan\npointed out that the application\
    \ content of landscape digital\ntechnology includes digital analysis, digital\
    \ aided design, dig-\nital modeling, digital media, and virtual visualization\
    \ tech-\nnology; for digital analysis, my country was originally\napplied in the\
    \ ﬁeld of geographic information, using GIS\ntechnology to digitally analyze and\
    \ simulate hydrology, ter-\nrain, climate, ecological suitability, and landscape\
    \ patterns\nand use network multisource data analysis to conduct\nresearch on\
    \ spatial heat, urban spatial distribution, and road\naccessibility [15]. For\
    \ the development of related software,\ndigital aided design is also gradually\
    \ applied to landscape\nplanning and design, using GIS, Sketchup, 3DMax, Photo-\n\
    shop, Illustrator, InDesign, Lumion, and other software for\npreanalysis, establishment\
    \ of 3D models, program text and\nrendering production, and virtual animation\
    \ video [16].\n3. Design of Smart Garden System Based on\nWireless Sensors Network\n\
    3.1. Selection of Wireless Sensors. The wireless sensor net-\nwork architecture\
    \ consists of wireless sensor network proto-\ncols, which are mainly responsible\
    \ for signal modulation and\neﬀective transmission and reception of signals, such\
    \ as infra-\nred and data link layer. The data link layer is responsible for\n\
    the detection of data framing and is responsible for expand-\ning the media for\
    \ strict access to the protocol; it can also\nachieve point-to-point and point-to-multipoint\
    \ communica-\ntion goals without socket control.\nWireless sensor network (WSN)\
    \ is a form of network\nformed by freely organizing and combining tens of thousands\n\
    of sensor nodes through wireless communication technology.\nThe units constituting\
    \ the sensor node are the data acquisition\nunit, data transmission unit, data\
    \ processing unit, and energy\nsupply unit. It is a wireless network composed\
    \ of a large num-\nber of static or mobile sensors in a self-organizing and multi-\n\
    hop manner, which cooperatively senses, collects, processes,\nand transmits information\
    \ about sensed objects within a geo-\ngraphic area covered by the network and\
    \ ultimately sends this\ninformation to the network owner.\nWireless sensor networks\
    \ have many types of sensors\nthat can detect a variety of phenomena in the surrounding\n\
    environment,\nincluding\nearthquakes,\nelectromagnetism,\ntemperature, humidity,\
    \ noise, light intensity, pressure, soil\ncomposition, size, speed, and direction\
    \ of moving objects.\nThe soil moisture sensor is mainly used to measure the\n\
    moisture content in the soil, which plays an important role\nin understanding\
    \ soil moisture and realizing scientiﬁc and\nprecise irrigation. According to\
    \ the needs of the automatic\ncontrol system for precision irrigation of sunken\
    \ gardens\nof Beijing Forestry University for soil moisture measure-\nment, the\
    \ HYSWR-ARC soil moisture sensor independently\ndeveloped by the Precision Water-Saving\
    \ Irrigation Control\nLaboratory of the School of Engineering, Beijing Forestry\n\
    University, was selected to monitor the sunken gardens. Soil\nmoisture content\
    \ provides important data parameters for\nprecise irrigation decision theory.\
    \ The principle of the\nHYSWR-ARC soil moisture sensor is to use a signal source\n\
    with a frequency of 100 MHz to send out a wireless wave sig-\nnal, and the wireless\
    \ wave signal is transmitted to the probe\ncomposed of four stainless steel probes\
    \ through a coaxial\ntransmission line. When the impedance is diﬀerent, the volt-\n\
    age amplitudes of the incident wave and the reﬂected wave\nare diﬀerent when the\
    \ signal propagates on the transmission\nline. The superposition forms a standing\
    \ wave, and the volt-\nage at each point on the transmission line changes. The\
    \ ana-\nlog acquisition module can convert the value of soil moisture\ncontent\
    \ by collecting the voltage value of the sensor signal\nline, and its performance\
    \ indicators are shown in Table 1.\nThe sensor measures soil water content based\
    \ on the\nprinciple of standing wave rate. The product has the func-\ntions of\
    \ analog signal output (0~2.5 V) and RS232 digital sig-\nnal. It has the advantages\
    \ of convenient use, accurate\nmeasurement, and rapid response. It is widely used\
    \ in scien-\ntiﬁc experiments, water saving irrigation, greenhouses, and\nother\
    \ water content measurement.\nIn this project, the soil moisture sensor is buried\
    \ in the\narea where soil moisture content needs to be detected as\nshown in Figure\
    \ 1, and the soil moisture content is moni-\ntored in real time to provide important\
    \ data parameters for\nirrigation decision-making.\nInstallation diagram of soil\
    \ moisture sensor air tempera-\nture and humidity, carbon dioxide sensor monitoring\
    \ air\ntemperature, humidity and carbon dioxide content, and\nother microenvironmental\
    \ information can be displayed in\ndigital form to understand the current environmental\
    \ infor-\nmation more intuitively. It can provide data parameter guid-\nance for\
    \ future analysis of plant growth status by detecting\ncarbon dioxide content.\n\

    \ is 1°C. The carbon\ndioxide sensor selects the SenseAir S80053 sensor imported\n\
    from Sweden, which has high precision in measuring carbon\ndioxide. In the case\
    \ of good environmental conditions, the\nmeasured value is generally 400 ppm.\n\
    3.2. Theoretical Research on Smart Gardens. “Smart gardens”\nare modern smart\
    \ landscape gardens with smart service sys-\ntems that meet the new requirements\
    \ of the new era. In\naddition, the concept of smart garden in a broad sense is\n\
    deﬁned as follows: based on “the Internet of Things” tech-\nnology, combined with\
    \ many advanced science and technol-\nogy such as big data, cloud computing, mobile\
    \ Internet, and\nspatial geographic information system (GIS), in the planning\n\
    and design of landscape gardens. In the construction, pro-\nduction, research,\
    \ and management of garden and landscape\nfacilities, many facilities and functions\
    \ within the garden are\nconnected with each other with high-tech hands, forming\
    \ an\nintelligent unity of information collection, sharing, and feed-\nback, while\
    \ fully respecting the wisdom of nature, to further\nsublimate humanistic wisdom.\
    \ In addition, it is necessary to\nuse\nadvanced\nscientiﬁc\nand technological\n\
    wisdom\nto\nenhance and improve various functions of garden landscape,\necology,\
    \ recreation, and so on from multiple angles, levels,\nand aspects, in order to\
    \ achieve eﬃcient garden intelligent\nservice and management.\nThe technical level\
    \ of the system architecture is divided\ninto ﬁve layers: perception layer, network\
    \ layer, data layer,\nplatform layer, and application layer, which is shown in\n\
    Figure 2. The perception layer is the foundation of the entire\narchitecture and\
    \ the main way to obtain and transmit data\nand information. Aerial survey, remote\
    \ sensing, GPS, satel-\nlite positioning, and digital map technologies are used\
    \ to col-\nlect various data in the park. The network layer is a bridge\nfor information\
    \ and data transmission, which can transmit\nvarious data information collected\
    \ and realize the eﬃciency\nof data transmission based on the “5G network” and\
    \ “Inter-\nnet of Things.” The data layer has a storage function. It can\nadd\
    \ and subtract, store, and analyze a large amount of data\nand at the same time\
    \ make intelligent decision-making and\nintuitively display real-time data and\
    \ decision-making\nprompts in the platform layer to achieve deep data sorting\n\

    application. The intelligent management system is oriented to\npark managers,\
    \ making intelligent decisions or artiﬁcial deci-\nsions through the collected\
    \ real-time data and feedback to\nadjust the park intelligent management facilities\
    \ such as park\nintelligent sprinkler irrigation facilities; the intelligent service\n\
    system is oriented to park tourists, through big data analysis,\ninformation transmission\
    \ feedback, application of intelligent\nservice facilities, and other means to\
    \ provide tourists with a\nvariety of intelligent services.\n3.3. Research on\
    \ Smart Garden Facilities\n3.3.1. Smart Management System Facilities. The smart\
    \ man-\nagement system is a system in the smart park system for\npark managers\
    \ to manage the park intelligently through\nanalysis,\nprocessing,\nand\ntimely\n\
    feedback\nadjustment\nthrough the park intelligent management facilities, in order\n\
    to realize the intelligent management of the park as a whole.\nThe perception\
    \ layer, network layer, data layer, and platform\nlayer in the ﬁve systems of\
    \ the smart garden architecture\nserve for the intelligent practice of the management\
    \ system,\nand the application layer is the goal and realization form of\nthe\
    \ intelligent management system.\nThe\napplication\nof\nintelligent\nmanagement\n\
    system\nincludes environmental monitoring system (environmental\nquality monitoring,\
    \ water quality monitoring, and biodiversity\nmonitoring), intelligent irrigation\
    \ system (automatic sprinkler\nirrigation system and remote control system), intelligent\
    \ light-\ning (automatic induction and remote control and intelligent\ndetection\
    \ of equipment failure), intelligent maintenance\n(intelligent cleaning, protection\
    \ of pests and diseases, protec-\ntion of ancient and famous trees, ﬁre monitoring,\
    \ and equip-\nment management), intelligent security (people and traﬃc\nﬂow monitoring,\
    \ real-time security positioning and schedul-\ning, and emergency warning), intelligent\
    \ transportation (entry\npark population analysis and unmanned vehicle scheduling),\n\
    and smart energy consumption management (water and\npower consumption management\
    \ and rapid fault location).\nThe successful realization of feedback regulation\
    \ of intel-\nligent management system requires the support of intelligent\nmanagement\
    \ facilities. Intelligent management facilities are\nmainly divided into sensor\
    \ devices and intelligent feedback\nadjustment facilities. The intelligent management\
    \ facilities\nin the environmental monitoring system include data collec-\ntion\
    \ devices such as integrated sensors and water quality\nsensors for collecting\
    \ information such as park air and water\nquality. Cooling sprays, smart water\
    \ pumps, etc. are used for\nfeedback regulation facility for park cooling or water\
    \ quality\ncleanup. The intelligent management facilities in the intelli-\ngent\
    \ irrigation system include soil sensors for detecting soil\nconditions in the\
    \ park and intelligent sprinkler irrigation\ndevices for sprinkler irrigation.\
    \ The intelligent management\nfacilities in intelligent lighting are intelligent\
    \ street lamps,\nwhich integrate infrared sensing and intelligent light adjust-\n\
    ment. The intelligent management facilities in intelligent\nmaintenance include\
    \ wireless multimedia sensor network sys-\ntem for monitoring plant diseases and\
    \ insect pests; DHT22,\nAM2302, and HP206C sensors for monitoring the growth sta-\n\
    tus of ancient and famous trees; and ﬁre detection sensors for\nmonitoring ﬁre.\
    \ Intelligent management facilities in smart\nsecurity include smart face recognition\
    \ cameras, which can\nmonitor tourists and road safety in the park in real time.\n\
    The two applications of intelligent transportation and intelli-\ngent energy consumption\
    \ management mainly use the combi-\nnation of intelligent camera monitoring and\
    \ manual rapid\nresponse to realize the intelligent management of parks.\nMost\
    \ of the existing routing protocols use clustering to\noptimize the network, and\
    \ some network protocols preset\nthe number of cluster heads. This algorithm cannot\
    \ achieve\nnetwork energy balance. When the number of cluster heads\nis set too\
    \ small, the distance between the member nodes in\nthe cluster and the cluster\
    \ head node will be too far, causing\nthe member nodes to consume too much energy\
    \ in data\ntransmission, and even some member nodes exceed the reli-\nable communication\
    \ range. Monitoring data loss when the\nnumber of cluster heads is too large will\
    \ also cause excess\nenergy consumption, because the cluster head node under-\n\
    takes the tasks of data reception, forwarding, and fusion pro-\ncessing of the\
    \ member nodes in the cluster. The relationship\nbetween the number of groups\
    \ and network energy con-\nsumption is shown as follows:\nd2\ntoCH =\nð ð\nÀa2\
    \ + b2\nÁρ a, b\nð\nÞⅆaⅆb,\nð1Þ\nd2\ntoCH =\nð ð\nr2ρ r, θ\nð\nÞⅆrⅆθ,\nð2Þ\nd2\n\
    toCH =\nð2π\n0\nð\n0\nM\nﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ\npπNCH\nr3ρ r, θ\nð\nÞdrdθ:\nð3Þ\nThe ﬁnal\
    \ solution is as follows:\nd2\ntoCH =\nM2\n2πNCH\n:\nð4Þ\n3.3.2. Smart Service\
    \ System Facilities. On the other hand, the\nmain application of a smart garden\
    \ is to build a complete\nsmart service system. The smart service system is mainly\
    \ ori-\nented to tourists and applied to the needs of tourists in the\nprocess\
    \ of visiting the park. The application research of\nsmart service system in urban\
    \ park is the research content\nof this paper, and this part of the content will\
    \ be studied in\ndepth in the next paper.\nThe smart service system also has ﬁve\
    \ layers: the percep-\ntion layer, the network layer, the data layer, the platform\n\
    layer, and the application layer. However, compared with\nthe smart management\
    \ system, some smart service facilities\nin the smart service system can basically\
    \ achieve autono-\nmous feedback without going through the park’s AI brain\nand\
    \ performing data processing. Smart service facilities are\nmore often used to\
    \ collect tourist information such as ﬁtness\ninformation or intention to visit\
    \ the park. For example, the\n5\nJournal of Sensors\nsmart ﬁtness system senses\
    \ and collects various real-time\ndata of tourists in the park by establishing\
    \ a perception layer\nwith sensors as the main tool, including exercise kilometers.\n\
    Count, calorie consumption value, body temperature, body\nfat, and other indicators\
    \ display the corresponding data\nfeedback on the platform layer such as the smart\
    \ display\nscreen or the tourist mobile APP terminal. The intelligent\nservice\
    \ system is a set of more intelligent and modernized,\nmore user-friendly and\
    \ convenient, and more precise intelli-\ngent service system in line with the\
    \ concept of people-ori-\nented, built under the concept of smart garden.\nThe\
    \ smart service facilities in the smart service system\ngenerally include multimedia\
    \ touch screen interactive sys-\ntem, mobile APP guide, smart trail, smart AR\
    \ ﬁtness, ﬁtness\npoint system, rain garden interactive display device, interac-\n\
    tive bicycle device, natural soundscape experience device,\nhistorical and cultural\
    \ science, animal and plant science,\nsmart seats, smart conference rooms, and\
    \ smart unmanned\nvehicles.\n3.4. Digital Landscape Garden Design\n3.4.1. Related\
    \ Technical Support. Mobile Internet technology\ncan provide cloud-based services\
    \ and real-time resources\nand have the advantages of sharing and open functions.\n\
    Mobile Internet technology is an important technical sup-\nport foundation for\
    \ the smart upgrade and transformation\nof urban parks. Through its network construction\
    \ in urban\nparks, real-time sharing of various information within the\nparks\
    \ can be achieved to meet the management and use\nneeds of urban parks.\nThe Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) refers to the real-time\nacquisition of any object or process\
    \ that needs to be moni-\ntored, connected, and interacted with through various\n\
    devices and technologies, such as various information sen-\nsors, radio frequency\
    \ identiﬁcation technology, global posi-\ntioning systems, and infrared sensors,\
    \ and through various\npossible network access to collect all kinds of information\n\
    required, to achieve intelligent perception, recognition, and\nmanagement of objects\
    \ and processes. The Internet of\nThings is an information carrier based on the\
    \ Internet, tradi-\ntional telecommunication networks, etc. It enables all com-\n\
    mon physical objects to be addressed independently to\nform an interconnected\
    \ network [2]. Wireless sensor net-\nworks (WSNs) are distributed sensor networks\
    \ that detect\nthe outside world through sensors placed at terminals and\nacquire\
    \ and transmit the required data. The multihop ad\nhoc network composed of wireless\
    \ sensors in a wireless sen-\nsor network is an important technical form of the\
    \ underlying\nnetwork of the Internet of Things. A typical sensor network\nstructure\
    \ includes distributed sensor points (clusters), sink\nnodes, Internet, and user\
    \ interfaces.\nCloud computing is to decompose massive data comput-\ning processing\
    \ programs into countless small applications\nthrough the Internet, process and\
    \ analyze these small appli-\ncations through a system application composed of\
    \ multiple\ninformation processors and servers, and ﬁnally get the result\nand\
    \ return it to the user. Through the application of cloud\ncomputing technology\
    \ in the smart park system, the collec-\ntion and processing of various complex\
    \ information data\nin the park can be completed in a very short period of time,\n\
    providing powerful information technology services for the\npark. Cloud computing\
    \ is a type of distributed computing,\nwhich refers to decomposing huge data computing\
    \ process-\ning programs into countless small programs through the\nnetwork “cloud”\
    \ and then processing and analyzing these\nsmall programs through a system composed\
    \ of multiple\nservers to obtain results and return them to users. In the\nearly\
    \ days of cloud computing, it was simply distributed\ncomputing, which solved\
    \ task distribution and merged com-\nputing results. Therefore, cloud computing\
    \ is also known as\ngrid computing. Through this technology, it is possible to\n\
    complete the processing of tens of thousands of data in a\nvery short time (a\
    \ few seconds), thereby achieving powerful\nnetwork services.\nFor the division\
    \ of various areas involved in the applica-\ntion of wireless sensors in smart\
    \ gardens, the fuzzy clustering\nalgorithm is used. In fuzzy clustering, the sample\
    \ set X is\ndivided into k fuzzy subsets \x01X1, \x01X2, ⋯, \x01Xk, Sk\ni=1 supp\
    \ ð\x01XkÞ\n= X, where supp represents support sets of fuzzy sets. The\nmembership\
    \ function uil of the sample extends from {0, 1}\nbinary to [0, 1] interval, and\
    \ uil ∈ Mf .\nMf = uiljuil ∈ 0, 1\n½\n\x02\nf\n,\n〠\nk\ni=1\nuil = 1,∀l,\n0 <\
    \ 〠\nn\nl=1\nuil < n,∀i:\nð5Þ\nFor a given set of samples, fuzzy clustering analysis\
    \ can\neasily obtain a fuzzy k-partition U = fuilj1 ≤ i ≤ k ; 1 ≤ l ≤ ng.\n3.4.2.\
    \ Basic Architecture. Garden planning ﬁrst needs to\nbuild a perfect smart garden\
    \ system. By establishing a per-\nception layer, BIM information model, 3S (GPS,\
    \ RS, GIS)\nmonitoring system, sensors, etc., it can sense and collect\nthe moisture\
    \ and soil conditions and temperature of the\ngarden; the real-time dynamics of\
    \ information such as envi-\nronment, humidity, and carbon dioxide concentration,\n\
    using the Internet of Things; and a 5G network to build a\nnetwork layer to transmit\
    \ real-time information and then\nbuild a data layer through big data intelligent\
    \ analysis to\ncomprehensively process and analyze data and make corre-\nsponding\
    \ intelligent decisions. Create a “one picture” intel-\nligent platform layer\
    \ for intuitive data display and ﬁnally\nbuild a professional application layer\
    \ to implement the cor-\nresponding intelligent decision-making and set up environ-\n\
    mental perception, energy consumption perception, traﬃc\nmanagement, intelligent\
    \ security, maintenance manage-\nment, intelligent irrigation, and lighting. Manage\
    \ seven\nfunctional modules and corresponding smart park facilities,\nwhich are\
    \ shown in Figure 3.\nBy establishing a water quality, soil moisture, air quality,\n\
    illuminance monitoring, and control management system,\nthe\nsmart\ngarden\nsystem\n\
    conducts\ndata\ncollection,\n6\nJournal of Sensors\ntransmission, storage, and\
    \ analysis of parks and tourists;\nrealizes\nremote\nmonitoring,\nprediction,\n\
    control,\nand\nresponse on the PC or mobile phone, disposal, and other\nintelligent\
    \ management; and fundamentally upgrade and\ntransform the technology, reﬁnement,\
    \ and conservation of\nthe daily management of the park. The establishment of\n\
    the garden intelligent system can provide garden managers\nwith an eﬃcient and\
    \ convenient management platform, save\nmanagement resources, and reduce operation\
    \ and mainte-\nnance costs. The system process is shown in Figure 4.\n3.4.3. Model\
    \ Construction. Collect the data information of\nthe research object, select the\
    \ required information, and ana-\nlyze and use it through integrated processing\
    \ and analysis\nresearch. Through the dynamic detection of advanced\nremote sensing\
    \ technology, various kinds of accurate infor-\nmation of garden green space can\
    \ be obtained regularly, so\nthe dynamic monitoring of gardens increasingly relies\
    \ on\nRS remote sensing technology. GIS (geographic information\nsystem) is an\
    \ interdisciplinary subject closely related to mul-\ntiple disciplines. GIS is\
    \ closely related to earth science, infor-\nmation science, and even space science\
    \ and other disciplines.\nGIS is based on geospatial data and uses the support\
    \ of com-\nputer software and hardware technology to collect, store,\nprocess,\
    \ manage, and analyze the required data in space. It\ntakes building a geographic\
    \ model as an analysis method\nand can eﬃciently and conveniently provide the\
    \ required\nspatially related dynamic geographic information data. The\nsmart\
    \ garden GIS monitoring system can complete the cen-\ntralized display of dynamic\
    \ data such as environmental\nmonitoring, garden animal and plant monitoring,\
    \ and gar-\nden park service facilities, hold important events or emer-\ngency\
    \ command, and dispatch assignments in emergencies.\nGPS satellite positioning,\
    \ RS remote sensing and GIS\ngeographic information system (3S) synergy, combined\
    \ with\nsensors to build a smart garden dynamic data receiving net-\nwork, are\
    \ the eyes of the smart garden system, and it is also\nnecessary to build a smart\
    \ garden system, which is an indis-\npensable part.\nIn addition to using the\
    \ 3S monitoring system, the con-\nstruction of the intelligent sensor system also\
    \ needs to build\na complete sensor network in the park, which is diﬀerent\nfrom\
    \ the 3S method of obtaining information in stages. A\nlarge number of smart sensors\
    \ can cooperate to build a com-\nplete smart sensor network.\nThe intelligent\
    \ sensor system mostly uses solar energy as\nthe working energy to create a fully\
    \ automatic working envi-\nronment. At the same time, it can be divided into integrated\n\
    sensors and water quality sensors according to diﬀerent\napplication environments.\
    \ The functions of smart sensors\nunder the smart management system include collecting\n\
    and recording real-time information of more than a dozen\npark environments such\
    \ as soil temperature and humidity,\nnegative oxygen ions, air temperature and\
    \ humidity,\nPM2.5, ultraviolet intensity, light, carbon dioxide concentra-\n\
    tion, air pressure, and noise. The network layer transmits\ndata to the AI intelligent\
    \ brain, and the real-time monitoring\ndata is analyzed and processed in an appropriate\
    \ manner\nand presented to the corresponding modules of the manage-\nment platform,\
    \ providing convenience for park managers\nand improving management eﬃciency.\n\
    In the intelligent management platform, the construc-\ntion of an intelligent\
    \ integrated management platform is\nequivalent to the brain of the park. Various\
    \ real-time infor-\nmation collected by the GIS monitoring system and intelli-\n\
    gent sensors is transmitted to the AI brain central control\nroom through the\
    \ “5G network and Internet of Things” sys-\ntem. After processing, it is displayed\
    \ on the digital twin visu-\nalization\nplatform,\nthat\nis,\nthe\nOne\nMap\n\
    intelligent\nmanagement platform, where the data is stored and visual-\nized.\
    \ Managers can dynamically monitor various data in\nthe park through the visual\
    \ management platform of the sys-\ntem, so as to carry out remote management of\
    \ intelligent\nfacilities in the park green space. The intelligent manage-\nment\
    \ platform includes seven functional modules: environ-\nmental perception, energy\
    \ consumption perception, traﬃc\nmanagement, intelligent security, maintenance\
    \ manage-\nment, intelligent irrigation, and lighting management. Each\nfunctional\
    \ module has corresponding perception, network,\ndata, platform, and application\
    \ ﬁve levels. For each manage-\nment function, the corresponding automatic decision-\n\
    making and intelligent application can be adjusted, so that\nit can fully realize\

    8\nJournal of Sensors\nBy rationally arranging smart streetlights, the park can\
    \ be\nrealized. The global coverage of the internal network, the\nsmooth information\
    \ transmission, and the real-time moni-\ntoring of various information in the\
    \ park smart streetlights\ncannot only meet the lighting needs of parks but also\
    \ pro-\nvide a comfortable nighttime recreation environment for\nurban residents.\
    \ It can also be superimposed by multipole-\nin-one technical modules, that is,\
    \ the combination of wire-\nless network, surveillance camera, environmental detection\n\
    sensor, wireless broadcasting, mobile phone charging inter-\nface, emergency call\
    \ ( as shown in Figure 5), and other mod-\nules, on the basis of satisfying the\
    \ lighting function, to build\na smart network of parks. At the same time, the\
    \ design of\nsmart street lamps should be combined with the park cul-\nture. Smart\
    \ streetlights can intelligently adjust the light dis-\ntribution intensity by\
    \ automatically sensing the brightness\nof the outside world and using the electronic\
    \ display screen\non the streetlights to release park information. Respond\npromptly\
    \ to situations that occur in the park.\n4.2. Security and Rescue. The smart security\
    \ monitoring and\ncontrol system monitor various areas in the park in real time\n\
    through surveillance cameras arranged on smart streetlights,\nsmart trash cans,\
    \ and other park infrastructure (as shown in\nFigure 6). The security monitoring\
    \ system can also add a\nface recognition module, which can be integrated into\
    \ the\nsecurity system of the smart city through the public security\nnetwork\
    \ to ensure the public safety of urban residents in the\npark. When a dangerous\
    \ situation occurs in the park, the\nintelligent monitoring system will issue\
    \ an alarm to the park\nmanagement personnel in time and broadcast it to the city\n\
    residents in real time through the broadcasting system in\nthe park, so that the\
    \ park management personnel can take\ncorresponding measures in time for the abnormal\
    \ situation\nand ensure the safe operation of the park.\nEmergency rescue system\
    \ includes an emergency rescue\nalarm system and automatic emergency rescue positioning\n\
    system. A positioning system is an interrelated assembly or\ndevice (component)\
    \ formed with the goal of determining a\nspatial location. This system can ensure\
    \ that at least four sat-\nellites can be observed simultaneously at any point\
    \ on the\nEarth at any time, to ensure that the satellites can collect\nthe longitude,\
    \ latitude, and height of the observation point,\nin order to achieve navigation,\
    \ positioning, timing, and\nother functions. This technology can be used to guide\
    \ air-\ncraft, ships, vehicles, and individuals to safely and accurately\nfollow\
    \ selected routes and arrive at their destinations on\ntime. Its basic principle\
    \ is to measure the distance between\na satellite with a known location and the\
    \ user’s receiver\nand then integrate the data from multiple satellites to know\n\
    the speciﬁc location of the receiver. To achieve this goal, the\nposition of the\
    \ satellite can be found in the satellite ephem-\neris based on the time recorded\
    \ by the onboard clock.\nThrough the self-service alarm columns arranged in the\n\
    parks, it is convenient for urban residents to send rescue sig-\nnals to the park\
    \ managers in case of emergencies (as shown\nin Figure 7). After receiving the\
    \ rescue signal from the park\nvisitors, the park management department cannot\
    \ only\ncommunicate with the seeker remotely through the emer-\ngency rescue alarm\
    \ system but also quickly grasp the loca-\ntion of the seeker through the automatic\
    \ emergency rescue\npositioning system and dispatch the park management per-\n\
    sonnel to the scene for disposal in time. The emergency res-\ncue system eﬀectively\
    \ protects the property and personal\nsafety of urban residents, safeguards the\
    \ legitimate personal\ninterests of traveling residents, and facilitates the safety\
    \ and\nsecurity of park managers.\n4.3. Plant Maintenance. The vegetation construction\
    \ of\nurban parks provides an excellent resting environment for\nurban residents,\
    \ is a green link between urban residents\nSurveillance\ncameras\nData and image\n\

    \ and is also an important part\nof urban parks. Plant conservation in urban parks\
    \ is also\none of the important tasks of the park management depart-\nment, which\
    \ requires a lot of human and material resources\nto ensure the green environment\
    \ of the park. Integrating the\napplication of the smart park system in the renovation\
    \ and\nrenewal of urban parks can better play the function of pub-\nlicity, education,\
    \ and popularization of parks and deepen the\ninteractive experience between urban\
    \ residents and parks. At\nthe same time, the smart plant maintenance system can\
    \ bet-\nter assist urban park managers to carry out convenient and\naccurate plant\
    \ maintenance work, saving manpower and\nmaterial resources.\nThe plant maintenance\
    \ work in urban parks is relatively\nheavy. Through the construction of an intelligent\
    \ plant\nmaintenance system, real-time monitoring and automatic\nmanagement of\
    \ vegetation and soil in the park can be real-\nized, which greatly improves the\
    \ work eﬃciency of urban\npark management departments. The intelligent plant main-\n\
    tenance system uses wireless sensors arranged in the soil\n(as shown in Figure\
    \ 8) to monitor the relevant data of soil\nmoisture and nutrients in real time\
    \ and collect and analyze\nthe data to intelligently generate maintenance management\n\
    work requirements. At the same time, the intelligent plant\nmaintenance management\
    \ system is also combined with\nthe intelligent rainwater collection and management\
    \ system\nto automate nozzle and fertilization based on the real-time\nmonitoring\
    \ of soil data. The intelligent plant maintenance\nsystem also monitors the growth\
    \ status of plants in real time\nthrough the disease and insect pest monitoring\
    \ system.\nWhen a plant has a disease focus, it will automatically alarm\nin time\
    \ to remind the management staﬀ to take relevant\nmeasures.\n4.4. Cleaning System.\
    \ Most urban parks use purchased ﬁn-\nished trash cans, and the required number\
    \ of trash cans is\nreasonably calculated according to the park area and service\n\
    radius and arranged in the city park. Park managers need to\nregularly clean the\
    \ trash cans in the park every day to ensure\nthe sanitary environment in the\
    \ park, so they need to invest\na lot of human and material resources. When urban\
    \ parks\nare renovated and updated, the application of smart trash\ncans in the\
    \ park sanitation system can eﬀectively improve\nthe work eﬃciency of park management\
    \ workers and save\nresources. Smart trash cans are new trash cans equipped\n\
    with solar power panels, smart waste sorting systems, smart\ncompression systems,\
    \ and smart monitoring systems (as\nshown in Figure 9). Smart trash cans can automatically\
    \ clas-\nsify and compress all kinds of garbage and remind manage-\nment staﬀ\
    \ to deal with them in time when the capacity\nreaches the warning value. Smart\
    \ trash cans can also be\nequipped with wireless Wi-Fi modules, electronic display\n\

    Journal of Sensors\nresidents around the park. With the rapid development of\n\
    society and the economy, the number of vehicles per capita\nin cities is also\
    \ increasing rapidly, and the public parking lots\nin many urban parks can no\
    \ longer meet the needs of citi-\nzens. At the same time, due to the increase\
    \ in the number\nof vehicles, the workload of the park management depart-\nment\
    \ has also increased, and the travel experience of urban\nresidents has also been\
    \ aﬀected. In the process of renovation\nand renewal of urban parks, it is necessary\
    \ to renew the\nparking lots of existing urban parks according to the current\n\
    conditions such as park area, service radius, and traﬃc con-\nditions around the\
    \ park. At the same time, the introduction\nof a smart parking system can make\
    \ the parking process\nmore eﬃcient. The functions of the smart parking system\n\
    mainly include real-time monitoring of vehicle information,\nvehicle parking guidance,\
    \ data collection and storage analy-\nsis, and command control (as shown in Figure\
    \ 12). The\nsmart parking system implements traﬃc management by\ncollecting real-time\
    \ vehicle information and parking space\ninformation through the cooperation of\
    \ wireless sensing\ntechnology and cloud computing. Through the command\ncontrol\
    \ after data collection and processing, the information\ndisplay in the smart\
    \ parking lot can display the number of\nremaining parking spaces in real time\
    \ and guide the driver\nto ﬁnd the parking location conveniently and eﬃciently\n\
    through the indicator lights in the parking lot, saving park-\ning time. The intelligent\
    \ monitoring and feedback system\nof the smart parking lot also greatly facilitates\
    \ the manage-\nment of the parking lot by the park managers and can better\nserve\
    \ the urban residents.\n5. Conclusion\nThis paper explores the process of urban\
    \ park renovation\nand renewal through the combination of relevant theoretical\n\
    basis for urban park renovation and on-site investigation. At\nthe same time,\
    \ based on the relevant research and investiga-\ntion of the smart park system,\
    \ the application of the smart\npark system in the renovation and renewal of urban\
    \ parks\nwas explored. At present, the relevant research and applica-\ntion of\
    \ smart city are relatively mature. As the construction\nof urban parks cannot\
    \ be ignored in urban construction, it\nis necessary to study and refer to relevant\
    \ applications of\nsmart cities to better integrate them into the application\
    \ of\nparks. The smart park system is a comprehensive system\nthat combines multiple\
    \ disciplines. How to combine science\nand technology more systematically and\
    \ comprehensively to\nestablish a smart link between urban residents and parks\
    \ and\nbetter serve the daily life of residents requires more in-depth\ndiscussion\
    \ and discussion in the future research. This paper\nlacks depth and breadth in\
    \ the discussion and research on\nrelated applications of the smart park system\
    \ and needs to\ncontinue to be explored and researched.\nData Availability\nThe\

    years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also called drones, have been widely used
    in precision agriculture applications, such as water stress estimation, pest monitoring,
    and crop yield estimation, because of the development of UAV technology and remote
    sensing sensors. However, how to collect data effectively can still be a big challenge.
    Many UAV tunable parameters can have significant impact on data quality and the
    data analysis, such as flight height, flight time, overlapping, and airspeed.
    And, little work has been done regarding to how to extract high-resolution multispectral
    or thermal images with limited ground-truth measurements. Therefore, in this paper,
    a UAV resolution and waveband aware design was conducted in order to optimally
    collecting remote sensing aerial images with drones. Then, the flight mission
    design was tested in an onion field at USDA (United States Department of Agriculture)
    during the growing season in 2017. Based on the research results, drones successfully
    provide farmers and researchers the fundamental knowledge of irrigation management
    to identify irrigation non-uniformity. Using multispectral and thermal images
    collected by drones, we are able to apply supervised learning methods to find
    the relationship between image features and onions irrigation treatments. It also
    found out that how drones flight height or resolution settings affect the accuracy
    of estimating onions irrigation treatment. Different spectral bands combination
    also has effect on onion irrigation treatment prediction. Published in: 2019 International

    GA, USA SECTION I. Introduction Over the past a few years, unmanned aerial vehicles
    have been widely used as a remote sensing platform in agricultural applications,
    such as crop yield estimation [1], soil moisture monitoring, water stress estimation
    [2] and pest management [3]. Compared with traditional remote sensing tools, such
    as satellites, drones’ flight time can be more flexible and more frequent in the
    field. And, drones can fly at lower altitude and can take higher resolution multispectral
    images or thermal images [4] of crops. As a low-cost scientific data collection
    platform, drones also make data acquisition relatively less expensive. While there
    are many advantages by using drones for agricultural applications [1], there is
    still a lot of work for drones. Many researchers fly the drones in different standard,
    using specialized equipment, controlling environments and relying on data analysis
    expertise [5]. Is there any optimal point where the data can be the best representation
    of crops? In [5], Brandon built a conceptual framework for describing the optimality
    as a function of spatial, spectral, and temporal factors which represent the best
    solution. How to collect remote sensing data effectively can still be a big challenge.
    Many UAV tunable parameters can have significant impact on data quality and the
    data analysis, such as flight height, flight time, overlapping, and airspeed.
    In this paper, flight height’s effect on data analysis was discussed. It assumed
    that there must be an optimal point where the data analysis results from multispectral
    images or thermal images can greatly represent for, for example, the crops water
    stress status [2] or other crop characteristics. In this paper, a resolution and
    waveband aware path planning was conducted in order to optimally collecting remote
    sensing aerial images with drones. Then, the flight mission design was tested
    in an onion field at USDA during the growing season in 2017. Onion is one of the
    most widely produced vegetables all over the world. And, onion also plays an important
    role in human diet and medical properties [6]. Therefore, onion is consumed among
    all nationalities and cultures [7]. Based on the data from Food and Agriculture
    Organization, onion production has been increasing continuously by 65 million
    tonne (1999 -2009 period), in an area of 2.1 million hectare in 2009 [7]. California
    is the biggest onion producer in the United States, which is also the only state
    that can produce spring and summer-harvested onions in the US. 31 % of the total
    onion in the US was produced in California in 2015 [8]. In the semi-arid and arid
    areas of California, onion production is highly dependent on irrigation. Water
    stress could happen in any onion growing stage and cause onion yield loss. Therefore,
    to optimize irrigation management, it’s important to have a optimal onion water
    stress monitoring method. Many research results have been published on using drones
    to detect water stress [9] [10] [11] [12] [13], which prove drones can be a reliable
    and effective remote sensing platform. In onion study area, multispectral cameras
    are mounted on the unmanned aerial vehicles for onions yield estimation, biomass
    monitoring [14], and disease detection [15]. However, to our best knowledge, nobody
    has studied drone flight height’s effect on onion’s multispectral images data
    analysis and irrigation treatment inference. Therefore, in this paper, we mainly
    designed an UAV flight mission in order to optimally collecting onion remote sensing
    aerial images with drones. By using multispectral and thermal images collected
    by drones, we are able to apply supervised learning methods to find the relationship
    between image features and onions irrigation treatments. We also figured out how
    drones flight height or resolution settings affect the accuracy of estimating
    onion irrigation treatment. Different spectral bands combination also has effect
    on onion irrigation treatment prediction. Fig. 1. Onion test site Show All The
    rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the material
    and methods we used for UAV. Results and discussions are presented in Section
    III. In Section IV, concluding remarks are presented for the resolution and waveband
    aware path planning results. SECTION II. Material and Methods A. Onion Study Area
    As shown in Fig. 1, the field study was conducted at the USDA-ARS, San Joaquin
    Valley Agricultural Sciences Center (36.594  ∘ N,119.512  ∘ W) , Palier, California,
    93648, USA. Since 2016, an onion test field has been set up for research of biomass
    soil amendments and deficit irrigation. There are three irrigation treatment levels
    and four soil amendments. Three irrigation levels are low, medium and high. The
    four soil amendments are biochar, check, biochar + compost, and biochar + compost
    +1 bag of sulfur. There are also three replicate plots for each treatment combination.
    B. An UAV platform and sensors In this paper, we used a Hover (brand of the UAV)
    quadcopter as the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform. The Hover was equipped
    with a Pixhawk flight controller, GPS, telemetry antennas. And, it is able to
    fly over the onions field by waypoints mode (designed by using Mission Planner
    software). The Hover’s lithium polymer battery has a capacity of 9500 mAh, which
    can support a 30-minute flight mission with cameras mounted on the Hover drone.
    Multispectral images were collected by Survey 2 (MAPIR, USA) cameras with 4 bands,
    Blue, Green, Red (RGB) and Near-infrared (NIR). The MAPIR camera has a resolution
    of 4608 x 3456 pixels, with a space resolution at 1.01 cm/pix. The Survey 2 cameras
    have a faster interval timer, 2 seconds for JPG mode and 3 seconds for RAW + JPG
    mode. Faster interval timer would benefit the overlap design for UAV flight missions,
    such as reducing the flight time, enabling higher overlapping. The thermal camera
    ICI 9640 P-Series (ICI, USA) was applied for collecting onions’ thermal images.
    The thermal camera has a resolution of 640 x 480 pixels. The spectral band is
    from 7 μ m to 14 μ m. The dimensions of the thermal camera is 34mm × 30mm × 34mm.
    The accuracy is supposed to be ± 1 ∘ C . A Raspberry Pi Model B computer was used
    to trigger the thermal cameras during the flight missions. C. UAV images collection
    and preprocessing Flight missions were programmed by using Mission Planner software.
    The flight height was setup as 10m, 15m, 30m, and 60m in order to compare the
    resolution’s effect on onions irrigation treatment inference. For all the flight
    missions, the overlap was set up as 75% to make sure the onions’ images can be
    stitched together during images pre-processing. We flew the Hover drone bi-weekly
    over the onions field at noon during the growing season in 2017. The images of
    a color panel were taken right before and after the flight missions, servicing
    as the reflectance reference. After the flight missions, all of the aerial images
    were stitched together to generate the orthomosaick images in PhotoScan (Agisoft
    LLC, Russian). An RGB image is shown in Fig. 2, and an NIR image is shown in Fig.
    3. The process includes aligning photos and building orthomosaick. The Agisoft

    2. RGB image for onions field Show All D. Principal Component Analysis For image
    processing, we used two different machine learning methods, the Principle Component
    Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Both of them can reduce
    the datasets dimensionality and increase the classification accuracy. Principle
    Component Analysis (PCA) is a fast and flexible unsupervised method for data dimensionality
    reduction [16]. It can achieve linear projection to a lower-dimensional subspace
    by using singular value decomposition. PCA can also maximize the variance of the
    projected data. Therefore, PCA is widely used in exploratory data analysis and
    making predictive models. Fig. 3. NIR image for onions field Show All Fig. 4.
    36 plots of onion Show All E. Linear Discriminant Analysis Linear Discriminant
    Analysis (LDA) is a classifier with a linear decision boundary. It is generated
    by using Bayes’ rule to fit class conditional densities to the data. It assumes
    that all classes share the same covariance matrix. After that, LDA model can be
    used to reduce the dimensionality of the input data by projecting it to the most
    discriminative directions. Then, the output dimensionality is usually less than
    the number of classes, so that LDA is a very strong dimensionality reduction [17].
    SECTION III. Results and Discussion To prepare the multispectral and thermal images
    data sets, we firstly segmented 36 plots from the whole onion field in order to
    focus only on the area of interest, as shown in Fig. 4. Every image was converted
    into 2048 dimensions vector for data processing by python packages. The data was
    distributed as 67% for training and 33% for testing. Several classifiers in scikit-learn
    machine learning algorithms were used for onions irrigation treatment inference,
    such as, ”Nearest Neighbors”, ”Linear SVM”, ”RBF SVM”, ”Gaussian Process”, ”Decision
    Tree”, ”Random Forest”, ”Neural Net”, ”AdaBoost”, ”Naive Bayes” and ”QDA”. Table
    I Differe Ntresolutions Accuracy for Onion Treatment Inference Table II Bands
    Configuration Accuracy for Onion Treatment Inference The accuracy was evaluated
    by scikit-learns accuracy classification score function. This function computes
    the subset accuracy, in which the labels predicted for a sampling must exactly
    match the corresponding true labels. Estimators use this score method as the evaluation
    criterion for the classification problems. All scorer objects follow the convention
    that higher return values are better than lower return values. We mainly discuss
    two topics in this section, flight height or different resolution’s effect on
    onion irrigation treatment estimation and different wavebands combination on onions
    irrigation treatment prediction. A. UAV flight height or resolution’s effect In
    this section, near-infrared images are used to analyze the flight height or image
    resolution’s effect on data analysis. At 30 meters height, the MAPIR has a resolution
    as 1.01 cm/ pix. By image processing, we set up 4 different resolutions, A, B,
    C D for onion images. Resolution A means 0.55 cm/pix, resolution B means 1.01
    cm/pix, resolution C means 2.02 cm/pix, and resolution D means 4.04 cm/pix, as
    shown in Table I. From the Table I, we can figure out that the best accuracy is
    0.726, which shows up when the resolution is at 2.02 cm/pixel by using ’Neural
    net’ classifier. Compared with the other classifiers, the ’Neural net’ classifier
    performs the best in all resolution levels. And based on most classifiers resolution
    analysis results in the Table I, it turns out that when we fly a drone in the
    field, higher resolution does not mean better analysis results. The best resolution
    does not promise the best estimation. And, based on the accuracy trend of ’Neural
    net’ classifier, for example, it exists an optimal point near 2.02 cm/pixel resolution
    when ’Neural net’ was applied for onions irrigation estimation. B. Waveband configuration’s
    effect In this section, remote sensing images are generated by using different
    wavebands configurations. There are red, green, blue (RGB), near-infrared (NIR),
    thermal (TIR), and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) wavebands being
    used in this section. As shown in Table II, there are four combinations being
    used, RGB-NIR, All bands, RGB-NIR-TIR and TIR. Because RGB and NIR has a higher
    resolution (1.01 cm/pixel) than thermal images resolution (9 cm/pixel), the multispectral
    images were pre-processed in order to match the thermal images resolution. From
    the Table II, we can figure out that the best accuracy is 0.840, which appears
    when the RGB-NIR-TIR waveband images were used by ’Gaussian process’ classifier.
    Compared with the other classifiers, the ’Gaussian process’ classifier performs
    the best in all wavebands configuration. And based on most classifiers resolution
    analysis results in the Table II, it turns out that when we fly a drone in the
    field, more wavebands information does not mean better analysis results. Knowing
    all the remote sensing data does not mean the best estimation. And, based on the
    accuracy of ’Gaussian process’ classifier, it’s meaningful to point out that TIR
    images itself can already get pretty good estimation results, as high as 0.792,
    which means we do not always need multispectral wavebands information for some
    coarse estimation research work. On the other side, adding RGB-NIR information
    does increase accuracy from 0.792 to 0.840, which is meaningful for precision
    agriculture applications. SECTION IV. Conclusions In this paper, a UAV resolution
    and waveband aware path planning was conducted in order to optimally collecting
    remote sensing aerial images with drones. Using multispectral and thermal images
    collected by drones, we are able to apply supervised learning methods to find
    the relationship between image features and onions irrigation treatments. First,
    we found out that the best accuracy for onion irrigation treatments is 0.726,
    which shows up when the resolution is at 2.02 cm/pixel by using ’Neural net’ classifier.
    And, the best resolution does not promise the best estimation. According to the
    accuracy trend of ’Neural net’ classifier, it does exist an optimal point near
    2.02 cm/pixel resolution when ’Neural net’ was applied for onions irrigation estimation.
    Second, this paper also found out that different spectral bands combination also
    has effect on onion irrigation treatment prediction. Applying all the remote sensing
    data does not mean the best estimation. And, based on the accuracy of ’Gaussian
    process’ classifier, we figured out that TIR images itself can already get relatively
    good estimation results for onions irrigation estimation, as high as 0.792, which
    means we do not always need multispectral bands information for it. On the other
    side, adding RGB-NIR information does increase accuracy from 0.792 to 0.840, which
    is important for precision agriculture applications. ACKNOWLEDGMENT Thanks go

    \ This paper provides a re-\nview of current trends in watershed modeling, including\
    \ use of stochastic-based methods, distributed versus lumped pa-\nrameter techniques,\
    \ influence of data resolution and scalar issues, and the utilization of artificial\

    \ water resources, hydrology, catchments. \nINTRODUCTION \nGlobal advances in\
    \ economies and standards of living \nhave resulted in a growing dependency on\
    \ water resources. \nMany societies have experienced water scarcity as a result\
    \ of \ncurrent patterns with societal advances; these are associated \nwith factors\
    \ such as population growth, increased urbaniza-\ntion and industrialization,\
    \ increased energy use, increased \nirrigation associated with advances in agriculture\
    \ productiv-\nity, desertification, global warming, and poor water quality \n\
    [1-4]. Improved understanding of how each of these factors \ninfluences water\
    \ supply, demand, and quality require im-\nproved abilities to understand underlying\
    \ processes and their \nimpact on water availability and use. This entails employing\
    \ \na holistic approach which integrates hydrologic processes at \nthe watershed\
    \ scale to determine an overall watershed re-\nsponse to both user demands and\
    \ changing climates [1]. Cen-\ntral to this effort, watershed modeling is being\
    \ utilized as a \ntool to better understand surface and subsurface water \nmovement\
    \ and the interactions between these water bodies. \nMore importantly, they offer\
    \ tools to guide decision making \non water resources, water quality, and related\
    \ hazard issues \n[2]. \nThis paper begins with a brief overview of the regulatory\
    \ \ncontext for the use of a watershed-based approach. An ex-\namination of various\
    \ watershed modeling methods, key \nprocesses involved, and new modeling techniques\

    WATERSHED \nAP-\nPROACH \nUnderstanding and managing water resource problems \n\
    involve complex processes and interactions at the surface, \nsubsurface, and their\
    \ interface. In an effort to account for \nmany of these interactions and the\
    \ impacts on drinking water \nsources, water quality regulations are focusing\
    \ on more ho-\nlistic approaches for analysis and maintenance of water re-\nsources.\
    \ The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \n2006 – 2011 Strategic Planmaintains\
    \ the five goals that were \ndescribed in the 2003 - 2008 Strategic Plan: (i)\
    \ clean air and \nglobal climate change; (ii) clean and safe water; (iii) land\
    \ \npreservation and restoration; (iv) healthy communities and \necosystems; \n\
    and \n(v) \ncompliance \nand \nenvironmental \nstewardship [3]. The Strategic\
    \ Plan calls for improved stan-\ndards, protection of source waters, security\
    \ of water infra-\nstructure, and improved quality of rivers, lakes, and streams.\
    \ \nThe new plan provides increased focus on achieving more \nmeasurable, environmentally-relevant\
    \ results, including use \nof a watershed-based perspective. Sub-Objective 2.2.1:\
    \ \nImprove Water Quality on a Watershed Basis, outlines \nUSEPA’s plan to “work\
    \ with states, interstate agencies, \nWatershed Modeling and its Applications\
    \ \nThe Open Hydrology Journal, 2011 Volume 5    27 \ntribes, local governments,\
    \ and others in three key areas: \nmaintaining strong core programs that emphasize\
    \ watershed \nprotection...” [3]. In addition, at both federal and state levels,\
    \ \nincreased regulations of Total Maximum Daily Loads \n(TMDLs) of the watershed-wide\
    \ pollutant influx to a water \nbody, typically referenced as non-point source\
    \ pollution, has \ncreated strong demand for new assessment tools that take \n\
    into consideration multiple sources of flow (e.g., overland \nflow) [4]. Several\
    \ watershed-scale models have been devel-\noped that provide assistance in predicting\
    \ non-point source \npollution. Borah and Bera [5] provide a detailed summary\
    \ of \nmany of these including the Agricultural Non-Point Source \nPollution Model\
    \ (AGNPS), Areal Non-Point Source Water-\nshed Environment Simulation (ANSWERS),\
    \ Kinematic \nRunoff and Erosion Model (KINEROS), Hydrological \nSimulation Program-FORTRAN\
    \ (HSPF), MIKE SHE, Soil \nand Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), and others; therefore,\
    \ \nthey are only briefly considered in this review.  \nWATERSHED MODELING  \n\
    A watershed model simulates hydrologic processes in a \nmore holistic approach\
    \ compared to many other models \nwhich primarily focus on individual processes\
    \ or multiple \nprocesses at relatively small-or field-scale without full incor-\n\
    poration of a watershed area [6]. Watershed-scale modeling \nhas emerged as an\
    \ important scientific research and man-\nagement tool, particularly in efforts\
    \ to understand and con-\ntrol water pollution [7-11]. In the subsequent section,\
    \ differ-\nent types of watershed models are discussed along with sug-\ngested\
    \ applications. In addition, the role of artificial intelli-\ngence in assisting\
    \ in watershed modeling is discussed in \nsome detail. Genetic algorithms (GAs),\
    \ artificial neural net-\nworks (ANN), and fuzzy logic (FL) are currently being\
    \ em-\nployed to assist in processing data, develop improved rela-\ntionships\
    \ between hydrologic processes, and in some cases, \nassist in filling voids in\
    \ measured data. While much work \nhas been done to model individual hydrological\
    \ processes, \ncombining these processes at a much larger, watershed-scale \n\
    requires additional expertise and data resources. A short dis-\ncussion on the\
    \ difficulties encountered and some solutions \nused in scaling-up to the watershed\
    \ level is provided, includ-\ning discussions on data resolution, over parameterization,\
    \ \nand the impacts of digital elevation model (DEM) mesh size \non model accuracy.\
    \  \nModel Types \nWatershed models can be grouped into various categories \n\
    based upon the modelling approaches used. Melone et al. [7] \nnote the primary\
    \ features for distinguishing watershed-scale \nmodelling approaches include the\
    \ nature of the employed \nalgorithms (empirical, conceptual, or physically-based),\
    \ \nwhether a stochastic or deterministic approach is used for \nmodel input or\
    \ parameter specification, and whether the spa-\ntial representation is lumped\
    \ or distributed. Each of these \nfeatures is briefly outlined below in order\
    \ to provide context \nto subsequent watershed-scale modelling approaches. \n\
    Empirical models consist of functions used to approxi-\nmate or fit available\
    \ data. Such models span arange of com-\nplexity, from simple regression models\
    \ [8-10] to hydroin-\nformatics-based models which utilize Artificial Neural Net-\n\
    works (ANNs), Fuzzy Logic, Genetic, and other algorithms \n[11-19]. Additional\
    \ discussion on use of artificial intelli-\ngence in empirical watershed modelling\
    \ is provided in sub-\nsequent sections of this work. \nWatershed models can be\
    \ categorized as deterministic or \nstochastic depending on the techniques involved\
    \ in the mod-\nelling process. Deterministic models are mathematical mod-\nels\
    \ in which outcomes are obtained through known relation-\nships among states and\
    \ events. Stochastic models will have \nmost, if not all, of their inputs or parameters\
    \ represented by \nstatistical distributions which determine a range of outputs\
    \ \n[7]. Even though most models are deterministic in nature, \nstochastic models\
    \ provide two important advantages. First, \ntheir conceptually simple framework\
    \ makes it possible to \ndescribe heterogeneity when there are limited spatial\
    \ or tem-\nporal details. Second, they provide decision makers with the \nability\
    \ to determine uncertainty associated with predictions \n[7, 20-26].  \nWatershed-scale\
    \ models can further be categorized on a \nspatial basis as lumped, semi-distributed,\
    \ or distributed mod-\nels. The lumped modeling approach considers a watershed\
    \ as \na single unit for computations where the watershed parame-\nters and variables\
    \ are averaged over this unit. Compared to \nlumped models, semi-distributed and\
    \ distributed models ac-\ncount for the spatial variability of hydrologic processes,\
    \ in-\nput, boundary conditions, and watershed characteristics [4, \n27]. For\
    \ semi-distributed models, the aforementioned quanti-\nties are partially allowed\
    \ to vary in space by dividing the \nbasin into a number of smaller sub-basins\
    \ which in turn are \ntreated as a single unit [7, 28, 29]. Spatial heterogeneity\
    \ in \ndistributed models is represented with a resolution typically \ndefined\
    \ by the modeller [7]. Physically-based models are \nbased on the understanding\
    \ of the physics associated with the \nhydrological processes which control catchment\
    \ response \nand utilize physically based equations to describe these proc-\n\
    esses [30]. Examples of widely accepted physically based \nmodels on the market\
    \ include GSSHA [31, 32], HSPF, \nKINEROS2 [33], MIKE SHE [34], and SWAT [35,\
    \ 36]. \nDiscussion on the impacts of spatial data resolution and scal-\ning issues\
    \ in watershed modelling is provided later in this \ndocument. \nWatershed-scale\
    \ models can be further subdivided into \nevent-based or continuous-process models.\
    \ Event-based \nmodels simulate individual precipitation-runoff events with a\
    \ \nfocus on infiltration and surface runoff, while continuous-\nprocess models\
    \ explicitly account for all runoff components \nwhile considering soil moisture\
    \ redistribution between storm \nevents [7]. Further discussions of the aforementioned\
    \ classi-\nfication and watershed modeling approaches are presented in \nBorah\
    \ and Bera [5], Kalin and Hantush [37], Refsgaard [27], \nSingh and Frevert [38],\
    \ and Singh and Woolhiser [39]. \nAdvances inPhysically-based Models \nIn physically-based\
    \ models, mass transfer, momentum, \nand energy are simulated using partial differential\
    \ equations \nwhich are solved by various numerical methods such as the \nSt.\
    \ Venant equations [40] for surface flow, Richards [41] \nequation for unsaturated\
    \ zone flow, Penman-Monteith [42] \nequation for evapotranspiration and Boussinesq\
    \ equation for \nground water flow. Typically, the data and computation re-\n\
    quirements for these equations are enormous and demanding. \nFor example, the\
    \ traditional inversion methods using re-\npeated model runs are computationally\
    \ intensive and are not \n28    The Open Hydrology Journal, 2011, Volume 5 \n\
    Daniel et al. \nappropriate for operational application for regional and \nglobal\
    \ data [43]. Significant effort has gone into addressing \nthese data and computational\
    \ issues.  \nIn a review of current projects in the United States, Re-\nstrepo\
    \ and Schaake [44] note that emphasis is being placed \non models with parameters\
    \ that can be derived from physical \nwatershed characteristics. However, it was\
    \ also noted that \npurely physically-based models may be unattainable or im-\n\
    practical, and, therefore, models resulting from a combina-\ntion of physically\
    \ and conceptually approached processes \nmay be required. Restrepo and Schaake\
    \ [44] further suggest \nthat the future needs and directions of research for\
    \ hydro-\nlogic modeling include: \n(1) Reliable modeling of the different sources\
    \ of uncer-\ntainty; \n(2) A more expeditious and cost-effective approach by \n\
    reducing the effort required in model calibration;  \n(3) Improvements in forecast\
    \ lead-time and accuracy;  \n(4) An approach for rapid adjustment of model parame-\n\
    ters to account for changes in the watershed, both \nrapid as the result from\
    \ forest fires or levee \nbreaches, and slow, as the result of watershed refor-\n\
    estation, reforestation or urban development; and  \n(5) An expanded suite of\
    \ products, including soil mois-\nture and temperature forecasts, and water quality\
    \ \nconstituents. \nRestrepo and Schaake [44] also emphasize the develop-\nment\
    \ of improved precipitation estimation techniques such as \nstatistical merging\
    \ of remote-sensor observations and fore-\ncasts from high-resolution numerical\
    \ prediction models. \nBeckers et al. [45] reviewed many of the widely used hydro-\n\
    logic models and suggest one key area for computational \nimprovement is the need\
    \ to better quantify climate change \nwhich include possible future shifts in\
    \ temperature and pre-\ncipitation, the occurrence of extreme events, and the\
    \ changes \nin glacier mass balances. Central to this research is under-\nstanding\
    \ how best to link hydrologic models to climate \nchange predictions which present\
    \ downscaling issues which \nare well documented by Wood et al., [46], Merritt\
    \ et al., [47] \nand Stahl et al., [48]. Climate change projections are gener-\n\
    ated from global-scale, general circulation models which are \ntoo coarse for\
    \ hydrologic models and some level of statistical \ndownscaling will be required\
    \ [49]. Four recent statistical \ndownscaling techniques that have been applied\
    \ with some \nsuccess in western North America include the delta method \n[50],\
    \ ClimateBC [51], Bias-correction statistical downscaling \n[52-54] and the Tree-GEN\
    \ method [48].  \nAn essential component of each physically-based model \nis the\
    \ availability of sufficient data to represent each of the \nmodeled processes.\
    \ Significant advances to improve data \ngeneration, preparation, and management\
    \ are being realized \nthrough the utilization of geospatial technologies such\
    \ as \ngeographic information system (GIS), global positioning \nsystems (GPS),\
    \ and remote sensing. Typical model prepara-\ntion tasks include the use of remotely\
    \ sensed images for ex-\ntraction of the terrain canopy data or the use of a digital\
    \ ter-\nrain model (DTM), or digital elevation model (DEM) data \nfor extraction\
    \ of hydrologic catchment properties, such as \nelevation matrix, flow direction\
    \ matrix, ranked elevation \nmatrix, and flow accumulation matrix. Notable GIS-based\
    \ \nextraction tools include MapWindowsTauDEM (Terrain \nAnalysis Using Digital\
    \ Elevation Models) [55], GIS Weasel \n(An Interface for the Development of Spatial\
    \ Parameters for \nPhysical Process Modeling) [56], and ArcHydro [57]. Recent\
    \ \nwork by Prodanovi\x03 et al. [58] utilized DEM-based GIS al-\ngorithms to\
    \ improve DEM data accuracy and usability. \nWhen digital data is employed for\
    \ hydrological modeling, \nthey offer the following data evaluation procedures\
    \ to im-\nprove accuracy and usability: (i) check the fraction of the \narea that\
    \ has the slope of 0%; (ii) use of the surface flow \nrouting tool (can be found\
    \ in most GIS packages) in order to \ncheck whether water will flow across the\
    \ whole study area if \narbitrary source point is selected; (iii) check of the\
    \ orienta-\ntion and interconnection of the stream network; and (iv) use \nof\
    \ streams as “cut-outs” across the DEM and check whether \nthe slope of a longitudinal\
    \ section toward the lowest, exit \nnode, is continuous. \nIn many instances,\
    \ limited or no data is available for \nstudied watersheds. GIS automated tools\
    \ based on geostatis-\ntics interpolation techniques (e.g., inverse distance weight-\n\
    ing, splines, and kriging) offer improved options for generat-\ning new DEMs datasets\
    \ from point and contour datasets. \nRecent studies (e.g., Flipo et al., [59];\
    \ Frei, et al., [60], San-\ntini, et al., [61]) continue to improve these techniques.\
    \ Flipo \net al., [59] demonstrated kriging provides a satisfactory rep-\nresentation\
    \ of aquifer nitrate contamination from local ob-\nservations to set initial conditions\
    \ for the physically-based \nmodel. It was further noted that the use of geostatistics\
    \ and \nphysically-based modeling allows assessment of nitrate con-\ncentrations\
    \ in aquifer systems. Frei et al., [60] also utilized \nthe same method in a parallel\
    \ physically-based surface–\nsubsurface model to investigate the spatial patterns\
    \ and tem-\nporal dynamics of river–aquifer exchange in a heterogeneous \nalluvial\
    \ river–aquifer system with deep water table. Tague \nand Pohl-Costello [62] also\
    \ examined how flow data from a \nsimilar watershed can serve to compensate for\
    \ this data limi-\ntation in the context of understanding impacts on hydrologic\
    \ \nbehavior. \nModel Parameter Estimation and Calibration \nParameter estimation\
    \ and calibration of hydrologic mod-\nels inherently possess significant challenges\
    \ associated with \nthe nature of most hydrologic models; namely (i) nonlinear-\n\
    ity; (ii) data errors; (iii) data insufficiency; (iv) correlation \namong parameters;\
    \ (v) irregular response surfaces that may \nbe insensitive to select model parameters;\
    \ and (vi) single or \nmulti-objective nature of the models [63]. Parameter estima-\n\
    tion techniques often further attempt to quantify uncertainty \nof these estimates\
    \ and may be divided into two primary ap-\nproaches: (i) Bayesian; and (ii) frequentist\
    \ [64]. Bayesian \nmethods treat model parameters as random variables that \n\
    possesses probability distributions that are iteratively refined \nby comparing\
    \ measured data with model outputs based on \nselection of different model parameters\
    \ derived from an ini-\ntial, best estimate, distribution [64]. In contrast, frequentist\
    \ \napproaches model parameters as fixed entities that are then \nadjusted through\
    \ comparison with a calibration data set \nthrough various means [64], including\
    \ (i) a priori estima-\ntions; (ii) curve fitting (including trial and error calibration,\
    \ \nmethod of moments, least squares, maximum likelihood, and \nlinear and nonlinear\
    \ regression); and (iii) combination meth-\nWatershed Modeling and its Applications\
    \ \nThe Open Hydrology Journal, 2011 Volume 5    29 \nods [63, 65]. Numerous earlier\
    \ and more recent reviews out-\nline parameter estimation, calibration, and uncertainty\
    \ analy-\nsis as applied to hydrologic models (e.g., [65-87]). As noted \nby McDonnell\
    \ et al. [88], improved predictions for ungauged \nbasins is critical for overall\
    \ advancement in watershed hy-\ndrologic modeling. So here we focus briefly on\
    \ select recent \nadvances employed where data is especially sparse, such as \n\
    in ungauged basins.  \nModel parameter estimation and calibration processes are\
    \ \nespecially challenging for ungauged basins, where sparse or \npoor data quality\
    \ often favor the use of empirical versus \nphysically-based models [89]. Recent\
    \ advances include use \nof a hydrological distributed model, linking GIS with\
    \ system \ndynamics, employing linear, nonlinear, and Markov Chain \nMonte Carlo\
    \ (MCMC) uncertainly analyses, and use of areal \nevapotranspiration in lieu of\
    \ stream flow. Velez et al. [90] \nemployed the conceptual, distributed runoff\
    \ model, TETIS, \nwith a parameter estimation methodology, generating a cor-\n\
    rection function that compared model parameter values at \nindividual model section\
    \ scale to overall watershed charac-\nteristics derived from available data, taking\
    \ into account spa-\ntial and temporal scale effects enabling reduction in the\
    \ \nnumber of parameters requiring calibration. Aragon et al. \n[91] explored\
    \ the modeling of ungauged tributaries through \nuse of GIS to model hydrological\
    \ response units and a sys-\ntem dynamics model to represent physical processes.\
    \ Here, \nGIS was used to convert time series outputs from the process \nmodels\
    \ to spatial representations, which then formed the \nbasis for estimating parameter\
    \ inputs to subsequent model \nruns. Although the system reflected reasonable\
    \ behaviors, \nthe model was not calibrated [91]. Gallagher and Doherty \n[64]\
    \ examined the performance of three separate parameter \nestimation and uncertainly\
    \ analysis methods employed in a \nlumped parameter surface flow model Hydrological\
    \ Simula-\ntion Program-FORTRAN (HSPF) [64]. Both linear and non-\nlinear uncertainly\
    \ methods provided relative parameter un-\ncertainty assessment and understanding\
    \ degree of correlation \nbetween model parameters, but both were limited in predic-\n\
    tive uncertainty. MCMC proved especially useful in provid-\ning qualitative information\
    \ on parameter probability distribu-\ntions, but required significantly greater\
    \ number of model \nruns to generate the probability distributions [64]. Employ-\n\
    ing a much different approach, Nandagiri [89] compared \ncalibration of a regional\
    \ surface runoff model in India using \nstreamflow records to areal evapotranspiration\
    \ estimations \nderived from meteorological data and evapotranspiration \nmodel.\
    \ Results suggest that areal evapotranspiration may \nsuccessfully be used to\
    \ calibrate hydrological models in un-\ngauged basins [89]. \nUse of Artificial\
    \ Intelligence in Watershed Modeling \nThe watershed models discussed earlier\
    \ adopt the physi-\ncally-based approach to modeling complex watershed proc-\n\
    esses on different spatial and temporal scales. Typically, this \nrequires describing\
    \ the watershed system’s inputs, the physi-\ncal laws which govern its behavior,\
    \ and boundary and initial \nconditions [19]. However, the traditional techniques\
    \ adopted \nin this approach tend be computationally intensive, requiring \nsignificant\
    \ data and calibration. To address some of these \nissues, researchers [e.g.,\
    \ 19, 92-96] have pursued a more \ndata-driven approach which utilize soft computing\
    \ or artifi-\ncial intelligence (AI), namely, artificial neural network \n(ANN),\
    \ fuzzy logic (FL), and Genetic Algorithms (GA). \nOver the past decade the literature\
    \ has recorded numerous \nexamples where researchers have successfully demonstrated\
    \ \nhow AI can be utilized for watershed hydrology applications \nsuch as real\
    \ time flood forecasting, rainfall–runoff modeling, \nand water quality prediction\
    \ models. The following \ndiscussion highlights selected past and more recent\
    \ water-\nshed hydrology applications using ANN, FL, and GA. \nArtificial Neural\
    \ Networks (ANN) \nANNs are considered computer programs capable of \nlearning\
    \ from examples through iteration without requiring \nprior knowledge of the relationships\
    \ between process pa-\nrameters [97, 98]. ANNs were inspired from biological nerv-\n\
    ous systems and are an attempt to emulate the human brain \n[98, 99]. Fig. (1)\
    \ illustrates the general ANN structure which \nis developed based on:  \n(1)\
    \ Many single elements called nodes (also known as \nunits, cells, or neurons),\
    \ shown as oval shapes and or-\nganized as layers. Each node typically applies\
    \ a non-\nlinear transformation called an activation function to \nits net input\
    \ signal to determine its output signal. \nThese functions enable ANN to map nonlinear\
    \ proc-\nesses.  \n(2) Signals pass between nodes through connection links. \n\
    Each connection link has an associated weight that \nrepresents its connection\
    \ strength. \n(3) Most ANN possess a transparent first or input layer \n(X) that\
    \ receives input variables or quantities that can \ninfluence the output or last\
    \ layer (Y) which consists \nof values needed to be predicted as part of a problem\
    \ \nor system. These networks also often possess middle \nor hidden layers which\
    \ are usually determined by a \ntrial-and-error procedure [100]. \nThe American\
    \ Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Task \nCommittee [100] notes that in order\
    \ for ANN to generate an \noutput, a training process, also called learning (similar\
    \ to the \nconcept of calibration in traditional physically-based mod-\nels),\
    \ is employed to iteratively adjust and optimize connec-\ntion weights and threshold\
    \ values for each node. The primary \ngoal of training is to minimize the error\
    \ function by search-\ning for a set of connection strengths and threshold values\
    \ that \ncause ANN to produce outputs that are equal or close to tar-\ngets. After\
    \ completing the training process, the next step is to \nutilize ANN to predict\
    \ results based on new inputs. See \nASCE-Task-Committee [100] for further details\
    \ on ANN \nfeatures and functionality. \nNoted strengths of ANNs which make their\
    \ use attractive \nfor water resources and hydrology applications include the\
    \ \nability to (i) recognize the relation between the input and \noutput variables\
    \ without explicit physical consideration; (ii) \nwork well even when the training\
    \ sets contain noise and \nmeasurement errors; (iii) adapt to solutions over time\
    \ to \ncompensate for changing circumstances; and (iv) possess \nother inherent\
    \ information-processing characteristics and \nonce trained are easy to use [100].\
    \ ANN hydrologic applica-\ntions range from the predictions of peak discharge\
    \ or time to \npeak for a single rainfall event, to the forecast of hourly or\
    \ \ndaily river stages or discharges. The complexities in physical \nprocesses\
    \ and nonlinear relationships of processes such as \n30    The Open Hydrology\
    \ Journal, 2011, Volume 5 \nDaniel et al. \nrainfall-runoff and evapotransporation\
    \ were found to lend \nthemselves to ANN modeling [11, 101-103]. These ANN-\n\
    based models have been considered an alternate to physically \nbased models due\
    \ to their simplicity relative to minimizing \nthe need for collecting detailed\
    \ watershed data [102]. The \nmajor advantage of ANN over conventional methods\
    \ is the \nability to model physical processes without the need for de-\ntailed\
    \ information [104]. \nIn the 1990s and early 2000s, several research efforts\
    \ \n[e.g., 11, 103, 105-108] have shown ANN can be applied \neffectively across\
    \ different aspects of water resources and \nhydrology. Hjelmfelt and Wang [105,\
    \ 106] were among the \nfirst researchers to demonstrate the utility of ANNs in\
    \ mod-\neling these water resources processes. Here, they were able \nto use rainfall\
    \ and runoff data from 24 large storm events \nchosen from the Goodwater Creek\
    \ watershed (12.2 km2) in \ncentral Missouri to trainand test the ANNs. Results\
    \ revealed \nthat ANNs were able to generate a unit hydrograph better \nthan those\
    \ obtained through a standard gamma function rep-\nresentation. Smith and Eli\
    \ [107] were able to incorporate the \nspatial and temporal distribution information\
    \ of rainfall into \na ANN model that predicted peak discharge and time to peak\
    \ \nover a hypothetical watershed which was represented as a \ngrid of cells.\
    \ Using this method, they found the prediction of \nthe entire hydrograph to be\
    \ very accurate for multiple storm \nevents. Riad et al. [109] showed that ANN-based\
    \ models \nwere better than classical regression models for simulating \nrainfall-runoff\
    \ relations for a semiarid climate catchment \narea in Morocco. Recent work by\
    \ Wang et al. [110] con-\ncluded that ANN models not only out performed other\
    \ \nevapotransporation approximations developed in the semi-\narid region of Burikan\
    \ Faso, but they can also be utilized in \ndeveloping countries with adverse climatic\
    \ conditions [110]. \nOther studies [104, 111, 112] found that ANN models can\
    \ \npredict evapotranspiration and perform better than the Pen-\nman-Monteith\
    \ technique and other conventional methods. \nDespite the demonstrated benefits\
    \ of ANN, there are two \nkey challenges that should be mentioned. First, ANN\
    \ are \nusually implemented with a trial and error approach which \ntend to be\
    \ extremely time consuming [113]. May and Siva-\nkumar [114, 115] highlighted\
    \ this issue while investigating \nthe application of ANN and multi-linear regression\
    \ models \nfor predicting urban stormwater quality at unmonitored \ncatchments.\
    \ They concluded that both models generated \nsimilar prediction results but the\
    \ regression model appeared \nto represent a more applicable approach since it\
    \ was (i) faster \nto construct and apply; (ii) more transparent; and (iii) less\
    \ \nlikely to fit the limited data. The second limitation of ANNs \nidentified\
    \ by Moghaddamnia et al. [112] referenced the \ncomplicated input selection process.\
    \ They gained some suc-\ncess by using a gamma test to address this problem, explor-\n\
    ing different combinations of input data to assess their influ-\nence on evaporation\
    \ estimation modeling, showing that the \ngamma test greatly reduced model development\
    \ require-\nments, enabling provision of input data guidance prior to \nmodel\
    \ development. Despite these promising results, they \nsuggest that further evaluation\
    \ is needed, especially with \nrespect to its ability to assess validated data.\
    \  \nGenetic Algorithms (GA) \nGenetic Algorithms (GA) are nonlinear optimization\
    \ \nsearch techniques that imitate biological evolution processes \nof natural\
    \ selection and survival of the fittest [116, 117]. The \nmajor difference between\
    \ GAs and the other classical opti-\nmization techniques is that GAs work with\
    \ a population of \npossible solution while classical optimization techniques\
    \ \nwork with a single solution [118]. Soman et al. [119] sum-\nmarize the process\
    \ of creating GAs in the following steps:  \n(1) Generate a random number of solution\
    \ samples, \ncollectively called the population, within the feasi-\nble search\
    \ space. Each of these samples, called a \nchromosome, is defined by a sequence\
    \ of decision \nvariables known as genes (can be in binary strings \nof ones and\
    \ zeros of user specifiedlength, or real \nvalue numbers or integers). \n(2) Each\
    \ chromosome is assigned a measure of fit-\nness, based on the objective function\
    \ value. These \nchromosomesare referred to as species of the first \ngeneration.\
    \ For a maximization problem, the higher \nthe fitness values, the higher the\
    \ chance for sur-\nvival.  \n(3) Create the next generation of chromosomes. \n\
    This is accomplished by ranking the first genera-\ntion chromosomes in ascending\
    \ order of their fit-\nFig. (1). Configuration of feed forward three-layer ANN\

    \ Chromosomes with the highest fitness \nvalue will be given a higher probability\
    \ to obtain a \nmate, so as to produce offspring that may better fit \nthe environment.\
    \ This process of selecting mates is \ncalled selection. Once mates are selected,\
    \ genes of \ncorresponding mates, or parents, are systematically \nexchanged with\
    \ the conception that the resulting \nsolutions or offsprings will have higher\
    \ fitness val-\nues. The process of creating new individuals by \nsystematically\
    \ assigning genes of chosen mates to \nthe new individuals is known as crossover.\
    \ The \nnew chromosomes replace the old chromosomes, \nwhich have low fitness\
    \ values. \nThe process of selection and crossover is repeated for \nmany generations\
    \ with the objective of reaching the global \noptimal solution after a sufficient\
    \ number of generations. \nOther general forms of the GA include Genetic Program-\n\
    ming (GP) and Gene Expression Programming (GEP) which \nare explained in more\
    \ detail by Koza [120] and Ferreira \n[121].  \nSeveral early research efforts\
    \ demonstrated the useful-\nness of GA in water resources applications. Ritzel\
    \ et al. \n[118] adopted GA to solve groundwater pollution problems. \nWang and\
    \ Zheng [95] and Wu et al. [96] used GA-based \nfunctions to solve a groundwater\
    \ management model. Other \nresearchers [e.g., 122-128] made additional achievements\
    \ in \ndeveloping or improving rainfall-runoff models using GA. \nWang [127] was\
    \ successful in using GA with a local search \nmethod to calibrate the Xinanjiang\
    \ rainfall-runoff model. \nDrecourt [126] investigated the GP approach for flow\
    \ predic-\ntion on the Kirkton catchment in Scotland (United Kingdom) \nand found\
    \ that the results compared favorably with two op-\ntimally calibrated conceptual\
    \ models. Whigham and Crapper \n[128] compared a GP-based rainfall-runoff model\
    \ with a \ndeterministic lumped parameter model, based on the unit \nhydrograph\
    \ and found the results to be favorable as well. \nEfforts by Liong et al. [124]\
    \ were instrumental in demon-\nstrating GP as a new paradigm in rainfall-runoff\
    \ modeling. \nThey showed GP-based rainfall runoff relationships can \nserve as\
    \ alternatives to conventional (physically based and \nconceptual) rainfall runoff\
    \ models. In Singapore, Muttil and \nLiong [125] were able to apply GA programming\
    \ to generate \nempirically the underlying equations which connect input to \n\
    output for the Upper Bukit Timah watershed. \nMore recent research efforts [e.g.,\
    \ 19, 129-132] continue \nto demonstrate the utility of GA in support of water\
    \ re-\nsources applications. Guven et al. [131] developed a new \nGP-based model\
    \ for estimating reference evapotranspiration \nin northern California by using\
    \ five daily atmospheric vari-\nables (daily solar radiation, daily mean temperature,\
    \ average \ndaily relative humidity and wind speed). They concluded that \nthe\
    \ new model results were in good agreement with conven-\ntional evapotranspiration\
    \ models (here, the Penman-\nMonteith equation, Hargreaves-Samani equation, solar\
    \ radia-\ntion-based ET equation, Jensen-Haise equation, Jones-\nRitchie equation,\
    \ and Turc method) and can be used as an \nalternative approach. It was also concluded\
    \ that the GP-\nbased model offered a fast and practical method for accu-\nrately\
    \ estimating evapotransporation [131].  \nYao and Yang [132] note that the complexity\
    \ of parame-\nter optimization for a distributed watershed model goes far \nbeyond\
    \ the capability of traditional optimization methods. \nTo address this problem,\
    \ a new GA-based optimization \nmethod was developed and tested using the Distributed-\n\
    Hydrology-Soil-Vegetation model (DHSVM). Results of this \neffort demonstrate\
    \ the feasibility of GA in optimizing pa-\nrameters of the DHSVM model. Hejaziet\
    \ al. [129] and Preis \nand Ostfeld [19] demonstrated that GA can be coupled with\
    \ \nother flow or water quality models to develop and augment \ncalibration schemes.\
    \  \nGuven [130] investigated the use of linear genetic pro-\ngramming (a variant\
    \ of GP) for predicting time-series of \ndaily flow rates the Schuylkill River\
    \ at Berne, PA, USA and \nfound that the results showed good agreement with observed\
    \ \ndata. Results also showed that the GP-based model out per-\nformed an ANN-based\
    \ model. These findings demonstrate \nGP’s promise for predicting the nonlinear\
    \ and dynamic river \nflow parameters [130]. \nAlthough GAs have proven to be\
    \ an effective and power-\nful problem-solving strategy, they possess several\
    \ limita-\ntions. The common thread in many of the difficulties with \nGAs has\
    \ to do with their significant dependence on control \nparameters such as population\
    \ size, crossover probability, \nand choice of crossover operator [133]. Jackson\
    \ and Norgard \n[133] summarize these issues as follows: \n(1) A GA may not know\
    \ when it is done or lack \nproof of convergence. One possible way to deal \n\
    with this problem is to examine a series of consecu-\ntive generations for solution\
    \ improvement.  \n(2) GAs need to maintain a large population of solu-\ntions\
    \ which provides the genetic diversity needed to \nadequately explore the solution\
    \ space. Too small a \npopulation will result in premature convergence on \na\
    \ local minimum. While large populations enable \nsuperior performance, they also\
    \ require more mem-\nory and more execution time. \n(3) Excessive reliance on\
    \ crossover to introduce \nnew genetic material can also result in premature \n\
    convergence. The dominance of crossover as the \nprincipal stochastic process\
    \ may cause the popula-\ntion to become more homogeneous, and thus stag-\nnating\
    \ the evolutionary process.  \n(4) GAs are also known to have poor performance\
    \ \nin climbing local hills in the solution space which \nresults in reducing\
    \ accuracy for many real-valued \nproblems. This difficulty is a byproduct of\
    \ the sole \ndependence of the algorithm on stochastic processes \nto improve\
    \ solutions rather than on an analytical \napproach. \nJackson and Norgard [133]\
    \ suggest that these limitations \nof GAs can be addressed effectively by combining\
    \ GAs with \nother algorithms and techniques. \nFuzzy Logic (FL) \nThe FL approach\
    \ to modeling is based on the theory of \nfuzzy sets [134], where relationships\
    \ are defined verbally \n32    The Open Hydrology Journal, 2011, Volume 5 \nDaniel\
    \ et al. \ninstead of using known governing physical relationships. \nClassic\
    \ set theory assigns an item as a member of a set (1) or \na non-member of a set\
    \ (0), while a fuzzy set allows for gra-\ndations between full membership and\
    \ full non-membership. \nThe main idea is to define the fuzzy membership functions\
    \ \nwhich define relationships between input variables and out-\nputs of a system\
    \ [135]. Mahabir et al. [135] identify the main \nsteps for creating a FL-based\
    \ modeling system as follows:  \n(1) A membership function must be defined for\
    \ each \nvariable (input and output). The membership function de-\nfines the degree\
    \ to which the value of a variable belongs to \nthe group and is usually a linguistic\
    \ term, such as high, me-\ndium, or low. \n(2) The membership functions are related\
    \ by statements \nor rules, typically a series of IF–THEN statements. For ex-\n\
    ample, one rule would be: IF the rainfall is low (linguistic \nterm represented\
    \ by a membership function) THEN the run-\noff (output) is low (linguistic term\
    \ represented by a member-\nship function). \n(3) Each rule is evaluated through\
    \ a process called impli-\ncation, and the results of all of the rules are combined\
    \ in a \nprocess called aggregation. \n(4) The resulting function is evaluated\
    \ for a resulting \nvalue or score for the output variable (e.g., runoff) through\
    \ a \nprocess called defuzzification. \nThe two main FL-based modeling systems\
    \ included are: \n(i) fuzzy inference systems, which work on already con-\nstructed\
    \ rule-base mainly on the basis of expert knowledge, \nand (ii) fuzzy adaptive\
    \ systems, which can also build and \nadjust rule-base automatically based on\
    \ sample or training \ndata. Two significant advantages of FL–based models are\
    \ \ntheir ability to be error tolerant and integrate expert knowl-\nedge from\
    \ water resource specialists [94]. Guertin et al. \n[136] also point out that\
    \ the FL approach is well suited to \nwatersheds studies as many environmental\
    \ factors are best \nexpressed as gradients.  \nLike ANN and GA, the FL technique\
    \ does have its limi-\ntations. Three key disadvantages were identified in the\
    \ litera-\nture and presented here. Casper et al. [94] note that the larg-\nest\
    \ disadvantage of the fuzzy adaptive systems is its inability \nto extrapolate\
    \ without detailed expert knowledge about the \nwatershed system or process being\
    \ simulated. The second \ndisadvantage of fuzzy inference and fuzzy adaptive (aug-\n\
    mented with expert knowledge) systems is their strong reli-\nance on subjective\
    \ inputs from experts which might provide \nmore opportunity for their abuse [137].\
    \ Ferson and Tucker \n[138] also note that FL-based systems may also fail to cap-\n\
    ture the value range of complex data sets and the correlations \namong parameters.\
    \ Further details on FL theory and applica-\ntions are provided in Zimmermann\
    \ [139] and Dubois and \nPrade [140].  \nAccording to Yu and Yang [76], FL can\
    \ be applied to \nhydrologic modeling where a hydrologist defines the accept-\n\
    able degree of a simulation in the form of linguistic expres-\nsions such as ‘bad’\
    \ and ‘good’ based on their knowledge or \nexpert judgment. Researchers have been\
    \ successful in their \nearly attempts at applying FL for solving water resource\
    \ \nproblems or modeling hydrologic processes including infil-\ntration [141],\
    \ contaminant fate and transport [142], recon-\nstruction of missing precipitation\
    \ events [143] river level and \nflood forecasting [144, 145], rainfall-runoff\
    \ modeling [76, \n146, 147], daily future water demand modeling [148], \ndrought\
    \ classification [149], and regional drought prediction \n[150]. \nMore recent\
    \ research trends in the utilization of the FL \nmodeling approach highlight additional\
    \ efforts targeted at \ncombining other AI methods in hybrid systems. Chang et\
    \ al. \n[151] developed a FL based method that was applied to pre-\ncipitation\
    \ interpolation and utilized GA to determine parame-\nters for the FL functions\
    \ which represent locations without \nrainfall records and their surrounding rainfall\
    \ gauges. Cheng \net al. [80] combined FL-GA methods to develop a rainfall-\n\
    run model while Chidthong et al. [152] and Chen et al. [93] \nutilized similar\
    \ methods to forecast flooding. Combining FL \nand ANN also offer options for\
    \ improving modeling tech-\nniques and managing water resource problems. For example,\
    \ \nTayfur and Singh [153] demonstrated that FL-ANN based \nmodels can be useful\
    \ in simulating event based rainfall run-\noff on a watershed scale and are much\
    \ easier to construct \nthan the models based on the well-know kinematic wave\
    \ \napproximation method. Chang and Chang [154] utilized an \nadaptive neuro-fuzzy\
    \ (FL and ANN) inference system for \npredicting water levels in reservoirs. Firat\
    \ and Gungor [155] \nalso investigated the use of similar systems for estimating\
    \ \nriver flows. Chidthong et al. [152] were successful in devel-\noping a hybrid\
    \ system using FL, ANN, and GA for predict-\ning peak flooding.  \nSpatial Considerations\
    \ in Watershed Modeling \nAs previously mentioned, watershed modeling involves\
    \ a \nholistic approach that involves not only examining surface \nhydrology,\
    \ groundwater hydrology, or their interface as \nwhole systems, but attempting\
    \ to imitate the three regions as \none system. Scale-up of each of these regions\
    \ from the water \nbody (lake, river, stream, etc.) or aquifer to an entire catch-\n\
    ment or watershed presents obvious problems. One limita-\ntion is the availability\
    \ of precipitation, flow, land cover, etc. \ndata for the entire region. Another\
    \ consideration is the lim-\nited understanding of the interactions between smaller\
    \ hydro-\nlogic entities. Several studies have examined the effects of \nscaling\
    \ in watershed modeling [156-161]. Furthermore, the \nscale or resolution of data\
    \ used can impact the accuracy of \nthe model results [161-163]. The following\
    \ sections high-\nlight the more prominent issues relating to scale and data \n\
    resolution in watershed modeling.  \nScale-up from Hydrologic Models to Watershed\
    \ Models \nMuch work has been done to conceptualize watershed in-\nteractions\
    \ at the hillslope (sub-catchment) level resulting in \nhighly complex relationships\
    \ from field experimentation. \nSome suggest that watershed models should maintain\
    \ this \ncomplexity and efforts should be made to ensure that the \nsmaller scale\
    \ relationships are somehow incorporated into \nthe mesoscale watershed models\
    \ [164]. Unfortunately, data \nlimitations, computational complexity, and financial\
    \ con-\nstraints limit the amount of information that may be gathered \nfrom the\
    \ field to represent entire watersheds. Bloschl and \nSivapalan [158] published\
    \ a review of scale issues in hydro-\nlogical modelling at the catchment level\
    \ in 1995. In this, \ndiscussions on simplification versus aggregation of hydro-\n\
    Watershed Modeling and its Applications \nThe Open Hydrology Journal, 2011 Volume\
    \ 5    33 \nlogic parameters, scale up versus scale down, and the linkage \nacross\
    \ various modelling scales are presented.  \nProblems associated with scale-up\
    \ of hydrologic proc-\nesses to the watershed-scale include generalization and\
    \ over \nparameterization. Through generalization or simplification, \nprocesses\
    \ and variables that are applicable to a small portion \nof the watershed may\
    \ be applied to the entire region. In this, \nthe true representation of processes\
    \ taking place may be lost. \nOver parameterization occurs when the watershed\
    \ is repre-\nsented by multiple (possibly many) parameters/variables to \nthe\
    \ point that a holistic representation of the region is no \nlonger present [158].\
    \ While Jakeman and Hornberger [165] \nsuggest only a few parameters are identifiable/necessary\
    \ for \nhydrologic models, van Werkhoven et al. [166] argue that \nthe number\
    \ of parameters necessary for watershed modeling \nis dependent on the focus of\
    \ the model and experimental \ndesign. They suggest use of sensitivity analysis\
    \ and thorough \ninvestigation on the model behaviour to determine the ap-\npropriate\
    \ level of parameters involved to represent the water-\nshed. \nSivapalan [164]\
    \ suggests that identification of common \npatterns, or features found at the\
    \ hillslope scale within a \nwatershed can be applied to larger regions to assist\
    \ in scale-\nup to the watershed level. In addition, Wong [167] \nrecommends use\
    \ of physically-based models to replace \nempirical models noting that during\
    \ scale-up from empirical \nhydrologic models to watershed-scale models physically-\n\
    based relationships can be used to bridge the gaps. Kalin et \nal. [168] state\
    \ that the spatial scale of the catchment is \ndirectly proportional to the complexity\
    \ involved in modelling \nhydrologic processes of rainfall-runoff and surface\
    \ erosion. \nWhether a lumped or semi-distributed model is used is \ndependent\
    \ on the level of detail desired in the output and \ndata available for representing\
    \ the watershed.  \nImpacts of Data Resolution \nModeling the hydrologic responses\
    \ over a watershed re-\nquires use of soil maps and/or soil surveys to provide\
    \ infor-\nmation on the distribution of soil types and thus soil hydro-\nlogic\
    \ properties. Previously, soil maps produced from sur-\nveys of the region were\
    \ the only source of this information. \nNow, remote sensing (RS) and digital\
    \ terrain analysis can be \nutilized through geographic information system (GIS)\
    \ tech-\nniques [169] which are more accurate with higher resolution \ndata than\
    \ previous methods. In addition, the availability of \nprecipitation data may\
    \ be sparse and limiting. Gathering \nmeasurements over a large area may not be\
    \ economically \nfeasible, so modelers use genetic algorithms or other tech-\n\
    niques discussed previously to fill gaps and provide better \nrepresentation of\
    \ data over the entire watershed area. \nOften, digital elevation models (DEMs)\
    \ are used to iden-\ntify stream networks/rivers and the land slopes that contrib-\n\
    ute flow to these waterbodies. DEMs can be publicly ob-\ntained at various resolutions\
    \ (e.g., 250 m, 500 m, 1000 m), \nwhich can impact the accuracy of hydrograph\
    \ generation and \nidentification of tributaries/river networks [163]. DEMs are\
    \ \ndigital surfaces representing the area of interest with a grid \nof given\
    \ resolution placed over the surface and elevation data \nassigned to each cell.\
    \ Each DEM grid cell drains a specific \ndirection based upon its slope and the\
    \ slope of the cells \naround it. Streams or channel networks are identified by\
    \ us-\ning the slope information of DEM grid cells and assigning a \nthreshold\
    \ area (the minimum area that would drain to a point \nfor a stream channel to\
    \ form). The stream network is com-\nprised of a set of points that have summed\
    \ areas of cells \nabove the threshold value draining toward them. The resolu-\n\
    tion of the DEM can impact the slope of grid cells due to the \narea covered and\
    \ averaging of elevations, and thus, the iden-\ntification of stream networks\
    \ [168, 170]. DEM resolution \nalso impacts the delineation of the watersheds.\
    \ Ridge lines \nare commonly used to define watersheds because these rep-\nresent\
    \ the divide for which portion of precipitation flows in \nwhich direction.  \n\
    In a study by Zhu and Mackay [169], the impacts of us-\ning traditional soil maps\
    \ versus soil information derived \nfrom both fuzzy logic and digital elevation\
    \ models (DEMs) \nwere evaluated for the Lubrecht area in Montana. Using the \n\
    newer technology, they found that peak runoff was reduced \nthus producing more\
    \ realistic hydrographs. Yang et al. [163], \nevaluated the effects of DEM resolution\
    \ on geomorphic \nproperties (i.e., identification of river networks and hydro-\n\
    logical response). In their study, fifteen catchments in Japan \nwere analyzed\
    \ using differing DEM resolutions. An increase \nin DEM mesh size (less resolution)\
    \ led to loss in the amount \nof tributaries identified, flatter topography due\
    \ to averaging \nof elevations for individual DEM grid cells and less accurate\
    \ \nrepresentation of the hydrological response of the catchment \n[163].  \n\
    The required resolution of data used in the modeling ef-\nfort may be dependent\
    \ on the output desired. Kalin et al. \n[168] evaluated the resolution required\
    \ for different outputs \nfor two U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) experimen-\n\
    tal watersheds. When the peak runoff is the primary concern, \nthe highest resolution\
    \ is optimal. Meanwhile, if modelers are \nonly interested in sediment load at\
    \ the outlet, lower resolu-\ntion of model input data may be used.  \nHydrologic\
    \ and Hydrodynamic Models for Watershed \nModeling \nThis section provides a review\
    \ of current state-of-the-art \nof watershed-scale models, including discussion\
    \ of their \nstrengths and weaknesses when applied to various watershed \nand\
    \ related problems. Recent reviews by Singh and Wool-\nhiser [39], Borah and Bera\

    \ (AGN-\nPS/AnnAGNPS) \nThe current version of AGNPS is the AnnAGNPS model \n\
    [173, 174] which was developed to simulate, on a daily time \nstep, the sediment\
    \ and nutrient transport from an agricultural \nwatershed, ranging in size from\
    \ a few hectares up to 300,000 \nhectares (3x109 m2). AnnAGNPS is a semi-empirical,\
    \ dis-\ntributed, continuous simulation watershed-scale model with \noutput options\
    \ for an event, monthly, or annual basis [173, \n174]. The AnnAGNPS model can\
    \ assist with the manage-\nment of runoff, erosion, and nutrient movement by perform-\n\
    ing cost-benefit analysis. The model can simulate several \nbest management practices\
    \ (BMPs) including ponds, vegeta-\ntive filters strips, riparian buffers, and\
    \ others [37]. Borah and \nBera [5] also note that the model is useful for analyzing\
    \ \nlong-term effects of hydrological changes and watershed \nmanagement practices,\
    \ especially agricultural practices. The \nmodel has been utilized in several\
    \ studies with mixed results \n[175-178]. In Australia, Baginska et al. [179]\
    \ showed the \nevent flow predictions to be satisfactory, Das et al. [180] \n\
    were able to produce runoff results for the Canagagigue \nCreek watershed of southwestern\
    \ Ontario with acceptable \naccuracy, while Suttles et al. [177] and Yuan et al.\
    \ [175] \nhighlighted that the model can produce adequate results for \npredicting\
    \ long-term monthly and annual runoff.  \nKey limitations of the AnnAGNPS model\
    \ include: (i) an \ninability to simulate base flow or frozen soil conditions;\
    \ (ii) \nthe mass balance calculation for water inflow and outflow is \nnot provided\
    \ as the model does not account for spatially \nvarying rainfall over the watershed;\
    \ and (iii) the runoff simu-\nlation is not entirely based on physical laws [6].\
    \ Model re-\nsults from Suttles et al. [177] and Yuan et al. [175] show that \n\
    the overland flow inadequately represented the riparian ar-\neas, and predictions\
    \ on nutrients and sediment loads are \noverestimated. Proper cell discretization\
    \ was suggested as an \noption for improving runoff estimates. In Nepal, Shrestha\
    \ et \nal. [181] showed that model event-based peak flow results \nwere over predicted.\
    \ AnnAGNPS is also not adequately for-\nmulated to simulate intense single-event\
    \ storms [171]. Borah \net al. [182] concluded that the AGNPS model is not suitable\
    \ \nfor analyzing a storm when the flow and constituent concen-\ntrations and\
    \ loads drastically vary. They also noted that the \nuse of AGNPS in studying\
    \ impacts of BMPs is qualitative \nsince AGNPS does consider subsurface and groundwater\
    \ \nprocesses [183]. \nBoth AGNPS and AnnAGNPS use the Curve Number \n(CN) method,\
    \ which does not reproduce measured runoff \nfrom specific storm rainfall events\
    \ because the time distribu-\ntion is not considered [183-187]. Additional limitations\
    \ in-\nclude: (i) no explicit account of the effect of the antecedent \nmoisture\
    \ conditions in runoff computation; (ii) difficulties in \nseparating storm runoff\
    \ from the total discharge hydrograph; \nand (iii) runoff processes not considered\
    \ by the empirical \nformula [183, 186, 187]. Croley and He [188] suggest that\
    \ \nthese limitations will result in CN estimates of runoff and \ninfiltration\
    \ which are not reflective of actual values. In addi-\ntion, they note that sediment,\
    \ nutrient, and pesticide load-\nings, which are directly related to infiltration\
    \ and runoff, may \ngenerate inaccurate estimates for non-point source pollution\
    \ \nrates. \n36    The Open Hydrology Journal, 2011, Volume 5 \nDaniel et al.\
    \ \nAreal Non-PointSource Watershed Environment Simula-\ntion (ANSWERS) \nANSWERS\
    \ is comprised of two major response compo-\nnents: hydrology [189] and upland\
    \ erosion [190]. The water-\nshed area is divided into grids (less than 10,000\
    \ m) where all \nproperties (e.g., soil properties, land use, slopes, crops, nutri-\n\
    ents, and management practices) are considered homoge-\nnous. ANSWERS-2000, an\
    \ expanded version of ANSWERS \n[191], utilizes breakpoint rainfall data and performs\
    \ simula-\ntion on 30-second time steps for runoff events and a daily \ntime step\
    \ between runoff events. Simulation is limited to \nmedium-size watersheds (5x106\
    \ to 3x107 m) where surface \nhydrologic processes dominate. In addition, the\
    \ model also \nhas the capability of simulating transformations and interac-\n\
    tions between four nitrogen pools including stable organic N, \nactive organic\
    \ N, nitrate, and ammonium. A surface runoff \nhydrograph is provided at both\
    \ the watershed outlet and any \nother user-selected point within the watershed\
    \ [192]. \nANSWERS and ANSWERS-2000 models were designed \nfor ungauged watersheds,\
    \ as well as for evaluating the effec-\ntiveness of agricultural and urban watershed\
    \ best manage-\nment practices (BMPs) in decreasing sediment and nutrient \ntransport\
    \ to streams during surface runoff events [37, 193]. \nAvailable literature [6,\
    \ 171, 193-195] provides some of the \nachievements and issues related to the\
    \ application of these \nmodels. For example, Connolly et al. [194] showed that\
    \ \nANSWERS could be used to predict runoff at a catchment \noutlet and generate\
    \ fairly accurate simulations for different \nsurface cover conditions; however,\
    \ runoff predictions were \nless accurate at low rainfall intensity events when\
    \ compared \nto higher intensity events. They also pointed out that com-\nplex\
    \ watersheds could be modeled without calibration; al-\nthough promoting confidence\
    \ in the model, one would be ill-\nadvised to follow such advice. \nDillaha et\
    \ al. [193] evaluated ANSWERS-2000 on two \nwatersheds in Watkinsville, Georgia;\
    \ it performed well in \npredicting runoff, sediment, nitrate, dissolved ammonium,\
    \ \nsediment-bound total Kjeldahlnitrogen (TKN), and dissolved \nphosphorus losses\
    \ from both watersheds. They also tested \nthe model on the 1,153 hectare (1.15x107\
    \ m2) Owl Run wa-\ntershed in Virginia, where it also performed well for the \n\
    largest storms, and cumulative predictions of runoff volume, \nsediment yield,\
    \ nitrate, ammonium, sediment-bound TKN, \nand orthophosphorus were within 40\
    \ percent of the measured \nvalues. Other research by Bai et al. [195] showed\
    \ that the \nmodel adequately simulated runoff during non-snow seasons.  \nOogathoo\
    \ [6] notes that a key weakness of ANSWERS is \nits inability to simulate interflow\
    \ and groundwater contribu-\ntions to base flow, snow pack, and snowmelt. This\
    \ suggests \nthe model is less suitable for locations where base flow con-\ntribution,\
    \ winter snow accumulation, and snow melt are high. \nBorah and Bera [5] also\
    \ noted ANSWERS is not adequately \nformulated to simulate intense single-event\
    \ storms and has \npotential numerical problems inherent in its solutions. They\
    \ \nalso mentioned that ANSWERS-2000 does not have channel \nerosion and sediment\
    \ transport routines; therefore, the sedi-\nment and chemical components are not\
    \ applicable to water-\nsheds. Like AGNPS and AnnAGNPS, ANSWERS and AN-\nSWERS-2000\
    \ utilize the CN method and face the same limi-\ntations identified earlier by\
    \ Beven [186], Croley and He \n[188], and Garen and Moore [187].  \nGridded \n\
    Surface \nSubsurface \nHydrologic \nAnalysis \n(GSSHA)/CASC2D \nCASC2D [196] is\
    \ a physically-based model that was de-\nveloped to predict surface runoff in\
    \ arid to semi-arid basins. \nWater and sediment are simulated in two-dimensional\
    \ over-\nland grids and one-dimensional channels. Both single-event \nand long-term\
    \ continuous simulations are possible. The wa-\ntershed is divided into cells,\
    \ and water and sediment are \nrouted from one to another. GSSHA [31, 32], an\
    \ enhance-\nment of CASC2D, adds the ability to simulate saturated and \nunsaturated\
    \ groundwater, allowing use of the model in a va-\nriety of climates and watersheds.\
    \ While increasing the capa-\nbility of the CASC2D model, all functionality of\
    \ the \nCASC2D model has been retained, with significant im-\nprovements in model\
    \ stability and efficiency.  \nGSSHA, a component within the U.S. Department of\
    \ De-\nfense’s (DOD) Watershed Modeling System (WMS) [197], \nwas developed to\
    \ provide hydrologic predictions in the wid-\nest variety of places and conditions\
    \ including the complex \nspatial organization in an urban environment. This may\
    \ have \nimportant implications for the development of techniques for \nTable\

    \ in urbanized \nareas [31]. GSSHA has new or improved CASC2D features \nsuch\
    \ as the ability to simulate major hydrologic storage units \n(e.g., lakes, wetlands,\
    \ and reservoirs) and an improvement in \nthe predictions of in-stream sediment\
    \ transport, especially \nduring large rainfall events [31]. Both models were\
    \ tested on \nthe Goodwin Creek Experimental Watershed in Mississippi \nwhere\
    \ it was shown that the accuracy of sediment discharge \nfor selected storms was\
    \ superior when using GSSHA [31, \n198]. Despite these results, other studies\
    \ [e.g., 37] indicate \nthat the model may have major limitations such as the\
    \ poten-\ntial to generate very poor sediment results. Kalin and Han-\ntush [37]\
    \ suggest erosion in channels is not transport limited, \nwhich means the model\
    \ generates sediment that has a vol-\nume greater than what the flow can carry.\
    \ Another limitation \nfor the model is its numerical schemes, which are computa-\n\
    tionally intensive and demand large amounts of data [171]. \nAccording to Ogden\
    \ and Julien [199], simulation times can \nbecome prohibitive when the number\
    \ of model grid cells \nexceeds 100,000; therefore, the model may become prohibi-\n\
    tive for medium to large-sized watersheds [171]. \nHEC-1/HEC-HMS  \nHEC-1, developed\
    \ to simulate hydrologic processes (pre-\ncipitation, losses, baseflow, runoff\
    \ transformation, and rout-\ning) on watersheds ranging in size from 1 km2 to\
    \ 100,000 \nkm2, produces runoff hydrographs at single or multiple loca-\ntions\
    \ on complex watershed networks for gauged and hypo-\nthetical rainfall events\
    \ [200]. HEC-HMS (Hydrologic Engi-\nneering Center's Hydrologic Modeling System)\
    \ [201, 202] is \nthe “next generation\" and state-of-the-art Windows-based \n\
    model for precipitation-runoff simulation that will supersede \nthe HEC-1 model.\
    \ HEC-HMS provides a variety of options \nfor simulating precipitation-runoff\
    \ and routing processes, \nand is comprised of a Graphical User Interface (GUI)\
    \ [203], \nintegrated hydrologic analysis components, data storage and \nmanagement\
    \ capabilities, and graphics and reporting facili-\nties [201, 202]. Both HEC-1\
    \ [200] and HEC-HMS [201] \nhave been widely used for modeling floods and impacts\
    \ on \nland use changes [6]. Duru and Hjelmfelt [204], using the \nmodel's kinematic\
    \ wave method, found that even with lim-\nited calibration, runoff prediction\
    \ for ungauged catchments \nwas good and impacts of land use on the hydrologic\
    \ cycle \ncould be evaluated accurately. Additionally, a study con-\nducted in\
    \ northern Ontario, Canada showed that HEC-1 \nmodel could be used for runoff\
    \ simulation in an ungauged \nwatershed [205].  \nEven though HEC-1/HEC-HMS has\
    \ been widely used, \nOogathoo [6] notes that it excludes certain important fea-\n\
    tures. The model is constrained to a constant time step, \nwhich may not be suitable\
    \ for components requiring detailed \nanalysis. Since it is semi-distributed,\
    \ the model assumes hy-\ndrologic processes to occur uniformly within each sub-basin.\
    \ \nAlso, as the primary purpose of the model is to determine \nflood hydrographs,\
    \ a simple method is used for the baseflow \nsimulation; therefore, the loss component\
    \ of the model is not \ntracked down in absence of precipitation, that is, the\
    \ soil \ndoes not dry out and recover its loss potential. Other limita-\ntions\
    \ identified by Scharffenberg [201] include uncoupled \nmodels for evapotranspiration-infiltration\
    \ and infiltration-\nbase flow processes, no aquifer interactions, the allowance,\
    \ \nbut limited capability, of flow splits within the dendritic \nstream systems,\
    \ and the lack of downstream flow influence \nor reversal which makes backwater\
    \ possible but only if con-\ntained within a reach.  \nHydrological Simulation\
    \ Program-Fortran (HSPF) \nHSPF [206, 207] is a semi-distributed, continuous model\
    \ \nthat simulates hydrologic and associated water quality proc-\nesses on pervious\
    \ and impervious land surfaces, in streams, \nand in well-mixed impoundments where\
    \ water movement is \nsimulated as overland flow, interflow, and groundwater flow.\
    \ \nAlso simulated are snowpack depth and water content, \nsnowmelt, evapotranspiration,\
    \ ground-water recharge, dis-\nsolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, temperature,\
    \ \npesticides, conservatives, fecal coliforms, sediment detach-\nment and transport,\
    \ sediment routing by particle, size, chan-\nnel routing, reservoir routing, constituent\
    \ routing, pH, am-\nmonia, nitrate-nitrite, organic nitrogen, orthophosphate,\
    \ or-\nganic phosphorous, phytoplankton, and zooplankton. The \nmodel utilizes\
    \ hydrological response units (HRUs) based on \nuniform climate and storage capacity\
    \ factors. Periods from a \nfew minutes to hundreds of years can be simulated.\
    \ \nSimulation results include a time history of the runoff flow \nrate, \nsediment\
    \ \nload, \nand \nnutrient \nand \npesticide \nconcentrations, along with a time\
    \ history of water quantity \nand quality at any point in a watershed. HSPF simulates\
    \ \nthree sediment types (sand, silt, and clay) in addition to a \nsingle organic\
    \ chemical and transformation products of that \nchemical [206, 207]. \nGenerally\
    \ used to assess the effects of land use change, \nreservoir operations, point\
    \ or non-point source treatment \nalternatives, and flow diversions [37], HSPF\
    \ is also suitable \nfor mixed agricultural and urban watersheds [171]. Some of\
    \ \nthe key strengths of the model identified by Aqua Terra \n[208] include: (i)\
    \ a comprehensive representation of water-\nshed land, stream processes, and watershed\
    \ pollutant \nsources, including non-point (by multiple land uses), point, \n\
    and atmospheric sources; (ii) flexibility and adaptability to a \nwide range of\
    \ watershed conditions; and (iii) well-designed \ncode modularity and structure.\
    \ Oogathoo [6] and AquaTerra \n[208] note that HSPF’s key limitations derive from\
    \ it not \nbeing fully distributed or physically-based. As a result, wa-\ntershed\
    \ characteristics and climatic parameters are lumped \ninto several units, and\
    \ both empirical and physical equations \nare used to simulate the water flow\
    \ [6]. In addition, due to its \nconceptualization of the overland (sub-basin)\
    \ areas as lev-\neled detention storage and use of the storage-based or non-\n\
    linear flow equations in routings, HSPF is not adequate for \nsimulating intense\
    \ single-event storms, especially for large \nsub-basins and long channels [6,\
    \ 171]. The model requires \nextensive data requirements (e.g., hourly rainfall)\
    \ and avail-\nable documentation provides no comprehensive parameter \nestimation\
    \ guidance. As a result, user training is normally \nrequired [208]. In their\
    \ effort to evaluate the model, Saleh \nand Du [209] highlighted these issues\
    \ as they found the cali-\nbration process tends to be strenuous and long. \n\
    Kinematic Runoff and Erosion Model (KINEROS2) \nRepresented by a cascade of planes\
    \ and channels, \nKINEROS2 may be used to determine the effects of various \n\
    artificial features such as urban developments, small deten-\ntion reservoirs,\
    \ or lined channels on flood hydrographs and \nsediment yield [33]. The model\
    \ is also adopted as part of the \n38    The Open Hydrology Journal, 2011, Volume\
    \ 5 \nDaniel et al. \nAutomated \nGeospatial \nWatershed \nAssessment \nTool \n\
    (AGWA) software system [210, 211]. Limited to Hortonian \nflow \nand \nnot \n\
    designed \nfor \nlong-term \nsimulations, \nKINEROS2 lacks an evapotranspiration\
    \ component impor-\ntant for the mass balance of the water cycle [37]; however,\
    \ \nwith its complete set of hydrology and sediment components, \nthe model serves\
    \ as a useful tool for studying single severe \nor design storms and evaluating\
    \ watershed management \npractices, especially structural practices [171]. Using\
    \ a small \nU.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) experimental wa-\ntershed located\
    \ near Treynor, Iowa, Kalin and Hantush[37] \ntested the model and showed that\
    \ it was also extremely ro-\nbust in simulating erosion and sediment transport.\
    \ The model \nwas designed for arid and semi-arid areas [212]; however, \nseveral\
    \ studies [210, 213-215] highlight the ability of the \nmodel to successfully\
    \ simulate erosion, sediment transport, \nand characterize the runoff response\
    \ of the watershed due to \nchanges of land cover in arid and semi-arid watersheds.\
    \ La-\njili-Ghezal [215] conducted similar assessments on the \nM'Richet El Anze\
    \ watershed in a Tunisian semi-arid area \nand concluded that the model was adequate\
    \ for predicting \nrunoff from ungauged watersheds and for evaluating future \n\
    land use master-plans for Tunisian semi-arid high lands. \nMiller et al. [210]\
    \ also used KINEROS2 within the AGWA \nframework to successfully assess increased\
    \ event runoff vol-\numes and flashier flood response in watersheds that contrib-\n\
    ute runoff to the upper San Pedro River in Sonora, Mexico \nand southeast Arizona.\
    \ \nUnlike most of the studies mentioned, Al-Qurashiet al. \n[212] were less successful\
    \ when assessing the model using \ndata from a large arid catchment in Oman. Despite\
    \ relatively \nextensive and high resolution rainfall-runoff data, and their \n\
    efforts to optimize performance using automatic calibration \nand by adding a\
    \ rainfall parameter, the model validation per-\nformance was poor, and in general,\
    \ no better than achieved \nusing a ‘default’ parameter set [212]. Borah and Bera\
    \ [5] \nnote that the model does a relatively good job of simulating \nrunoff\
    \ and sediment yield at watershed scales of up to ap-\nproximately 1,000 hectares\
    \ (1x107 m2); however, such poor \nresults may arise since applications of the\
    \ model are limited \nto small watersheds and specific combinations of space and\
    \ \ntime increments for maintaining stability of the numerical \nsolutions. Overall,\
    \ a key weakness of the model is the ab-\nsence of chemical/nutrient components\
    \ [171] which limit its \ncapabilities to simulate for BMPs [37]. \nMIKE SHE \
    \ \nMIKE SHE is a fully integrated, distributed, and physi-\ncally-based watershed\
    \ model that simulates the major proc-\nesses in the hydrologic cycle and includes\
    \ process models for \nevapotranspiration, overland flow, unsaturated flow, ground\
    \ \nflow, channel flow, and their interactions [34]. It is used \nmostly at the\
    \ watershed scale and from a single soil profile to \nseveral sub-watersheds with\
    \ different soil types [216, 217]. \nThe model's distributed nature allows a spatial\
    \ distribution of \nwatershed parameters, climate variables, and hydrological\
    \ \nresponse through an orthogonal grid network and column of \nhorizontal layers\
    \ at each grid square in the horizontal and \nvertical, respectively [218]. The\
    \ model can be used for storm \nor long-term events with a variable time step.\
    \ Being physi-\ncally-based, the topography, along with watershed character-\n\
    istics such as vegetation and soil properties, is included in \nthe model. With\
    \ a modular structure, MIKE SHE is capable \nof exchanging data between components\
    \ as well as adding \nnew process model components. The flexible operating \n\
    structure of MIKE SHE allows the use of as many or as few \ncomponents of the\
    \ model, based on availability of data [219].  \nMIKE SHE is considered the most\
    \ comprehensive water-\nshed model with virtually all of the in-surface and surface\
    \ \nphases of the hydrologic cycle [37]. It also has many of the \noptions to\
    \ simulate wetlands, and nutrient and pesticide \nmanagement. The model is being\
    \ used for a wide variety of \napplications in different countries, including\
    \ England [220], \nAustralia [221], Canada [6], and the United States [222]. \n\
    Some of the notable application areas include river basin \nmanagement and modeling\
    \ [223], integrated ground/surface \nwater modeling [221, 222], irrigation [224-226],\
    \ land use \nchanges, and anthropogenic effects [27].  \nThompson et al. [220]\
    \ used the model simulated in a wet-\nland in England and found that the simulation\
    \ results consis-\ntently matched the observed data and reproduced the sea-\n\
    sonal dynamics of groundwater and ditch water levels. Sahoo \net al. [84] used\
    \ the model in a mountainous region of Hawaii \nto study watershed response to\
    \ storm events and found the \nresults were comparable to the observed data. In\
    \ addition, \nDemetriou and Punthakey [221] concluded that the model \nwas accurate\
    \ in predicting water movement from aquifers, \ndrainage and supply systems, and\
    \ land surfaces across an \nAustralian watershed with a complex hydro-geological\
    \ re-\ngime. Overall, Singh et al. [227] showed that the model can \nbe utilized\
    \ for irrigation planning and management of water \nresources for agricultural\
    \ purposes.  \nMany of the MIKE SHE applications also involve cou-\npling with\
    \ other models; the model can interface with Model \nof Urban Sewers (MOUSE) to\
    \ simulate the effect of urban \ndrainage and sewer systems on the surface/subsurface\
    \ hy-\ndrology [34, 228, 229] and is also frequently coupled with \n(DAISY), a\
    \ detailed soil-plant-atmosphere model for agricul-\nture related studies [34,\
    \ 230, 231]. Like the GSSHA model, \nMIKE SHE faces the problem of being computationally\
    \ in-\ntensive and may be prohibitive for medium to large-sized \nwatersheds [171].\
    \ Borah and Bera [5] further point out that \nthe physically based flow-governing\
    \ equations use approxi-\nmate numerical solutions, which are subject to computational\
    \ \ninstability problems, and limited on space and time incre-\nments and watershed\
    \ sizes. \nPrecipitation-Runoff Modeling System (PRMS)/Modular \nModeling System\
    \ (MMS) \nPRMS [232] is a modular-design, deterministic, distrib-\nuted model\
    \ that simulates precipitation- and snowmelt-\ndriven movement of water through\
    \ the watershed via over-\nland flow, interflow, and baseflow. Watershed response\
    \ can \nbe simulated at a daily time step or more frequently over the \ncourse\
    \ of a storm. The watershed is divided into sub-units \nbased on basin characteristics\
    \ such as slope, aspect, eleva-\ntion, vegetation type, soil type, land use, and\
    \ precipitation \ndistribution. Two levels of partitioning are available for \n\
    PRMS. The first divides the basin into HRUs based on the \nbasin characteristics\
    \ where water and energy balances are \ncomputed daily for each HRU; the sum of\
    \ the responses of \nall HRU's, weighted on a unit-area basis, produces the daily\
    \ \nsystem response and streamflow for a basin. A second level \nWatershed Modeling\
    \ and its Applications \nThe Open Hydrology Journal, 2011 Volume 5    39 \nof\
    \ partitioning is available for storm hydrograph simulation \nwhere the watershed\
    \ is conceptualized as a series of inter-\nconnected flow planes and channel segments.\
    \ Surface runoff \nis routed over the flow planes into the channel segments and\
    \ \nchannel flow is routed through the watershed channel sys-\ntem. A HRU can\
    \ be considered the equivalent of a flow \nplane or it can be delineated into\
    \ a number of flow planes \n[232, 233]. PRMS was redesigned and now forms the\
    \ basis \nof the US Geological Society (USGS) Modular Modeling \nSystem (MMS)\
    \ [232].  \nPRMS [233] has been applied in different regions around \nthe world.\
    \ Applications range from the investigation of se-\nlected process components\
    \ to streamflow simulation and the \nintegration of MMS with other models [234].\
    \ One of the \nmajor benefits of MMS is its support for the integration of \n\
    models and tools at a variety of levels [232]. Design levels \ninclude individual\
    \ process models, tightly coupled models, \nloosely coupled models, and fully\
    \ integrated decision sup-\nport systems [234]. Several studies [235-237] have\
    \ focused \non this aspect of the model with some success. Steuer and \nHunt [236]\
    \ and Hunt and Steuer [235] used the model to \nstudy the effects of urbanization\
    \ and land use changes on \nground water recharge, and explicitly fed the results\
    \ into the \nU.S. Geologic Survey groundwater model, Modular Three-\nDimensional\
    \ \nFinite-Difference \nGround-Water \nFlow \nModel(MODFLOW), for other studies\
    \ in Dane County, Wis-\nconsin. Hobson [237] coupled the model with a stochastic\
    \ \nweather generator as a framework to simulate weather vari-\nables and streamflows\
    \ in the Upper Truckee River Basin on \nthe California and Nevada border. The\
    \ model can also be \neffectively used to evaluate the effects of climate variability,\
    \ \nchange on water resources, water management [234], and \nsimulate floods including\
    \ the representing flood wave propa-\ngation from single rainfall events [5].\
    \ Valeo and Xiang [238] \ndemonstrated this capability by analyzing climate change\
    \ \nimpacts on flooding from the Elbow River watershed in the \nfoothills of the\
    \ Rocky Mountains. In addition, Yates et al. \n[239] utilized the model with historical\
    \ radar rainfall and \nforecast data to simulate flash flooding on a watershed\
    \ that \nwas partially burned during a forest fire. Other examples of \nthese\
    \ studies were conducted in several regions of the world, \nincluding the Main\
    \ Ethiopian Rift Valley [240], river basins \nin the Sierra Nevada of California\
    \ [241], and the Arno River \nin Italy [242]. \nBorah and Bera [5] identified\
    \ the following key weak-\nnesses of PRMS/MMS: (i) like KINEROS2, the model was\
    \ \ndesigned for single rainfall events using one-dimensional \nflow equations\
    \ and has potential numerical problems inher-\nent to the numerical solutions;\
    \ (ii) in the Storm Mode, the \nmodel has hydrology and overland sediment, but\
    \ no chemi-\ncal component, sediment simulation in stream channels, and \nsubsurface\
    \ flow simulations; and (iii) the physically based \nflow-governing equations\
    \ use approximate numerical solu-\ntions which are subject to computational instability\
    \ prob-\nlems, and limited on space and time increments and water-\nshed sizes.\
    \ \nSoil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) \nSWAT [35, 36] is a physically-based,\
    \ continuous-time \nwatershed model that operates on a daily time step and is\
    \ \ndesigned to predict the impact of management on water, \nsediment, and agricultural\
    \ chemical yields in ungauged wa-\ntersheds. The watershed is divided into multiple\
    \ subwater-\nsheds, which are then further subdivided into HRUs that \nconsist\
    \ of homogeneous land use, management, and soil \ncharacteristics. The HRUs represent\
    \ percentages of the sub-\nwatershed area and are not identified spatially within\
    \ a \nSWAT simulation. Alternatively, a watershed can only be \nsubdivided into\
    \ subwatersheds that are characterized by \ndominant land use, soil type, and\
    \ management. Output for \nthe model includes evapotranspiration, soil water storage,\
    \ \nand water yield (surface runoff plus subsurface flow) [35, \n36]. The model\
    \ has been adopted as part of the USEPA’s \nBetter Assessment Science Integrating\
    \ Point and Nonpoint \nSources (BASINS) system [243] and AGWA [210, 211] \nsoftware\
    \ systems because it is a widely accepted continuous \nmodel suitable for agricultural\
    \ and forest land uses [5, 168]. \nBased on these core strengths, Gassman et al.\
    \ [36] found that \nthe primary applications of SWAT are calibration and/or \n\
    sensitivity analysis, climate change impacts, GIS interface \ndescriptions, hydrologic\
    \ assessments, variation in configura-\ntion or data input effects, comparisons\
    \ with other models or \ntechniques, interfaces with other models, and pollutant\
    \ as-\nsessments. The foundation strength of SWAT in many of \nthese applications\
    \ is the combination of simplified upland \nand channel processes that are incorporated\
    \ into the model \nnoted by Gassman et al. [36]. The incorporation of the CN \n\
    method and non-spatial HRUs supports model adaptation to \nvirtually any watershed\
    \ with a wide variety of hydrologic \nconditions [36].  \nSWAT has produced favorable\
    \ model results when \nevaluated on watersheds with a range of conditions in the\
    \ \nU.S. and many other countries such as Korea [244], Canada \n[245], China [246],\
    \ Finland [247], India [248-250], Tunisia \n[251], and Greece [252]; across many\
    \ of these watersheds, \nSWAT has shown flexibility in simulating surface runoff.\
    \ \nFor example, Du et al. [253] demonstrated that a modified \nversion of the\
    \ SWAT model was able to generate reasonable \nsimulation results for surface\
    \ and subsurface flows, water \ntable dynamics, tile flow, potholes, surface tile\
    \ inlets, and \naeration stress on plants for large flat landscapes. Gebremes-\n\
    kel et al. [245] stated that the SWAT model performed very \nwell for stream flow\
    \ prediction in the Canagagigue Creek \nwatershed of southwestern Ontario, Canada.\
    \ Several studies \nhave also demonstrated the utility of SWAT as a tool for \n\
    evaluating how stream flow can be affected by climate \nchange [254-256]. \nWith\
    \ a flexible framework, SWAT facilitates the calcula-\ntion of TMDLs and simulation\
    \ of a wide variety of conserva-\ntion practices and other BMPs (e.g., fertilizer\
    \ and manure \napplication rate and timing, irrigation management, and \nflood\
    \ prevention structures) [36]. Several studies illustrate \nthe success of SWAT\
    \ in conducting these types of simula-\ntions as part of an overall BMP assessment.\
    \ For example, \nSanthi et al. [257] were able to use SWAT to determine the \n\
    impacts of manure and nutrient related BMPs, forage harvest \nmanagement, and\
    \ other BMPs on water quality in the West \nFork watershed in Texas. Chaplot et\
    \ al.’s [258] efforts with \nSWAT showed that the adoption of no tillage, changes\
    \ in \nnitrogen application rates, and land use changes had the po-\ntential to\
    \ significantly affect nitrogen losses on the Walnut \nCreek watershed in Iowa,\
    \ and Kang et al. [244] were suc-\ncessful in predicting and evaluating TMDLs\
    \ of total nitro-\n40    The Open Hydrology Journal, 2011, Volume 5 \nDaniel et\
    \ al. \ngen, total phosphorus, and suspended solid for a small water-\nshed containing\
    \ rice paddies.  \nSWAT possesses components that make it a robust tool \nfor\
    \ simulating in-stream water quality dynamics, bacteria \nfate and transport,\
    \ and sediment transport [36]. A study con-\nducted by Migliaccio et al. [259]\
    \ compared SWAT’s in-\nstream water quality component with QUAL2E, USEPA’s \n\
    well-known and state-of-the-art in-stream water quality \nmodel. Both options\
    \ were used to simulate the movement of \ntotal phosphorous (P) and nitrate/nitrite\
    \ (N) movement on \nWar Eagle Creek watershed in Arkansas. The study revealed\
    \ \nthat there was no statistical difference between both in-\nstream water quality\
    \ modeling options. Saleh and Du [209] \nand Stewart et al. [260] also show that\
    \ SWAT predicted rea-\nsonable results for P and N loss on the Bosque River water-\n\
    shed in Texas. Chu et al. [261] evaluated SWAT on the \nWarner Creek watershed\
    \ in Maryland and generated simula-\ntion results for sediment loads which agreed\
    \ strongly with \nyearly measured values. Other studies [248, 250, 262-265] \n\
    on SWAT simulation of sediment loading on different water-\nsheds also generated\
    \ comparable results. In Missouri, for \nexample, Benham et al. [266] used SWAT\
    \ to determine the \nbacteria sources and assess which BMPs can reduce the bac-\n\
    teria on a watershed in Missouri. Similar results [267, 268] \nfrom other studies\
    \ also highlight the usefulness of SWAT in \nbacteria fate and transport.  \n\
    The examples presented here have highlighted the flexi-\nbility and robustness\
    \ of SWAT. Despite these strengths, \nSWAT possesses a number of weaknesses, notably\
    \ the use of \nnon-spatial aspects of HRUs [6, 36]. As a result, Gassman et \n\
    al. [36] note that this does not allow SWAT to provide an \nexplicit spatial representation\
    \ of riparian buffer zones, wet-\nlands, and other BMPs. In addition, there is\
    \ limited ability to \naccount for targeted placement of grassland or other land\
    \ use \nand ignore flow and pollutant routing within a given subwa-\ntershed.\
    \ Like ANPS and AnnANPS, SWAT also utilizes the \ncurve number (CN) method and\
    \ faces the same limitations \nidentified earlier by Beven [186-188]. Borah and\
    \ Bera [171] \nalso report that SWAT does not simulate single-event storms \n\
    adequately.  \nWater Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) \nWEPP [269] is a process-based,\
    \ distributed, continuous, \nerosion prediction model. It is applicable to hillslope\
    \ erosion \nprocesses (sheet and rill erosion), as well as simulation of the \n\
    hydrologic and erosion processes on small watersheds. The \nprimary intention\
    \ of the model is to evaluate the effects of \nfarming and land use on soil erosion\
    \ and sediment delivery \nfor small, agricultural field-sized watersheds (up to\
    \ 2.59x106 \nm2). WEPP has been used in a wide range of applications, \nincluding\
    \ runoff mapping [270], sediment analysis [271], \nand modeling the transport\
    \ of pathogenic microorganisms \n[272]. Another example of the WEPP application\
    \ was fo-\ncused on the connection between soil sediment and microbial \ntransport\
    \ [272]. It was determined that areas with clay soils \ncontribute more to contamination\
    \ of water supplies by mi-\ncroorganisms than those with sandy soils. It was also\
    \ sug-\ngested that the leading factors are hydraulic conductivity, \nrainfall\
    \ intensity, and topographic slope. Similar efforts \ncould be performed on organic\
    \ chemicals that may adhere to \ndiffering soil types and be transported through\
    \ the watershed. \nA computer interface (Erosion Database Interface, EDI) \nwas\
    \ created by van Lier et al. [273] to process the surface \nhydrology output from\
    \ WEPP into a georeferenced estima-\ntion of runoff. This tool allowed for improved\
    \ management \nof agriculture and can be used to assess crop management \ntechniques\
    \ [270]. WEPP was used, along with the Universal \nSoil Loss Equation, sediment\
    \ rating curves, and other model-\ning techniques to develop a sediment budget\
    \ for the Murder-\nCreekBasin in Georgia. From the study, researchers found \n\
    that unstable streambanks, mobile streambeds, and turbidity \ncurrently observed\
    \ in the area were the result of poor farm-\ning practices from the early 1900s\
    \ [271].  \nWATERSHED MODELING SYSTEMS \nThere are numerous watershed-scale hydrologic\
    \ model-\ning systems available that utilize some of the models men-\ntioned previously\
    \ within one packaged system for watershed \nmanagement. This section briefly\
    \ describes some of the sys-\ntems more commonly used today. A summary of the\
    \ water-\nshed model systems considered and their properties is pro-\nvided in\
    \ Table 2. \nAutomated Geospatial Watershed Assessment Tool \n(AGWA) \nAGWA is\
    \ a GIS-based tool for watershed modeling cre-\nated through a joint project between\
    \ the USDA-ARS South-\nwest Watershed Research Center and the U.S. EPA Office\
    \ of \nResearch and Development [274]. Embedded in AGWA are \nthe KINEROS and\
    \ SWAT models. Digital elevation models \n(DEMs) are used to delineate and discretize\
    \ the watersheds. \nThen, soil, land cover, and precipitation data layers are\
    \ used \nto derive model input parameters. Subsurface hydrologic \ndata from Walnut\
    \ Gulch Experimental Watershed were used \nto calibrate and validate AGWA.  \n\
    AGWA is used by scientists and natural resource manag-\ners to investigate the\
    \ impacts of land cover change on runoff, \nerosion, and water quality. Most applications\
    \ of AGWA in-\nvolve analysis of future sediment loading and runoff to assist\
    \ \nin decision support. Hernandez et al. [214] demonstrated this \napplication\
    \ by using AGWA with ATtILA, a landscape as-\nsessment tool, to analyze the spatial\
    \ effects of human-\ninduced landscape changes on runoff volume and soil ero-\n\
    sion in the San Pedro River Basin, a semi-arid area. Within \nAGWA, SWAT was used\
    \ for modeling of runoff and erosion \nsimulations. The basin was divided into\
    \ sub catchments for \nanalysis, which were further divided into hydrological\
    \ re-\nsponse units (HRUs) to develop relationships between land \ncover and sediment\
    \ yield. Agricultural areas were found to \nhave the greatest contribution to\
    \ sediment yield. Subcatch-\nments and HRUs were ranked in order of sediment loading\
    \ \nwith those contributing the most sediment considered “sensi-\ntive areas.”\
    \ This application provides resource managers \nwith capability to identify problem\
    \ areas by applying a spa-\ntial approach to sediment and runoff modeling [214].\
    \ An-\nother example of AGWA’s use for management decision \nsupport was performed\
    \ by Kepner et al. [275]. Three scenar-\nios for future urbanization of the Upper\
    \ San Pedro River \nBasin were evaluated for surface runoff, sediment yield, \n\
    channel discharge, and percolation using SWAT within \nAGWA. While all three scenarios\
    \ yielded negative impacts \non the basin, the Open Scenario, which consists of\
    \ a popula-\ntion increase greater than currently forecasted and highly \nWatershed\
    \ Modeling and its Applications \nThe Open Hydrology Journal, 2011 Volume 5  \
    \  41 \nunrestricted land development, resulted in a worst case out-\ncome [275].\
    \ Similar applications can be employed to assist \nstakeholders and management\
    \ in decision support for land \ndevelopment planning. \nBetter Assessment Science\
    \ Integrating Point and Non-\npoint Sources (BASINS) \nFirst released in 1996\
    \ by the USEPA, the Better Assess-\nment Science Integrating Point and Nonpoint\
    \ Sources (BA-\nSINS) software system was intended to serve as a multipur-\npose\
    \ environmental analysis system focused on evaluating \nboth point and nonpoint\
    \ sources of pollutant loading in wa-\ntersheds [211]. A specific intended use\
    \ of BASINS is fo-\ncused on evaluation and development of Total Maximum \nDaily\
    \ Loads (TMDLs). It is capable of performing watershed \nand water quality-based\
    \ studies on regional, state, and local \nlevels. The system includes utilities\
    \ for data management \nand extraction, watershed delineation, watershed assessment\
    \ \ntools, and a group of watershed models including WinHSPF, \nPollutant Load\
    \ Application (PLOAD), Aquatic Ecostystem \nand Toxicity Model (AQUATOX), and\
    \ AGWA which in-\ncludes KINEROS and SWAT. The current version, BASINS \n4.0,\
    \ includes an open-source, free GIS software architecture, \nMapWindow [276].\
    \  \nBASINS has been used for pollutant loading of the Sea-\nmangeum watershed\
    \ in Korea, specifically focused on BOD, \ntotal nitrogen, and total phosphorous.\
    \ Jeon et al. [277], in \ntesting the applicability of WinHSPF within BASINS,\
    \ found \nthat values obtained from BASINS were a bit higher than \nfield observations,\
    \ but were considered within an acceptable \nrange to accept the model as a good\
    \ choice for Korean appli-\ncations. In another study for the New York Department\
    \ of \nEnvironment and Conservation (NYDEC), BASINS was \nconsidered for use in\
    \ development of the sediment portion of \nthe state’s TMDL plan. They found that\
    \ SWAT was easier to \nuse than HSPF, but recommend that Monte Carlo simula-\n\
    tions be conducted to provide more accurate values [278]. \nBoth studies indicated\
    \ that results were less than perfect, but \nwithin acceptable boundaries.  \n\
    MODFLOW-Watershed \nHydrology \nand \nTransport \n(MODFLOW-WHaT) \nMODFLOW-WHaT\
    \ is a recent addition to the watershed \nmodeling portfolio. The system is the\
    \ result of a Master’s \nThesis research of Brad Thoms [256], where the Center\
    \ for \nGroundwater Research at Oregon Health and Science Uni-\nversity currently\
    \ sponsors/maintains MODLFLOW-WHAT. \nThe package provides fully coupled, 3D simulation\
    \ of sur-\nface-subsurface interactions through use of Richard’s Equa-\ntion,\
    \ 2D kinematic flow approximations for overland flow, \nand an adaptive time-stepping\
    \ algorithm. Open-channel flow \ncalculations are performed using Diffusion Analogy\
    \ Surface-\nWater Flow Model (DAFLOW) with water quality modeled \nusing RT3D\
    \ and Branched Lagrangian Transport Model \n(BLTM) [279].  \nLittle is known about\
    \ the benefits of using the system be-\nyond the comparison made by Thoms [280]\
    \ to work done by \nJohnson and colleagues [281]. Johnson’s work involved us-\n\
    ing MODFLOW-SURFACT to evaluate the impacts of daily \nprecipitation and location\
    \ within a watershed on the occur-\nrence of volatile organic carbons (VOCs) in\
    \ groundwaters of \nsemi-arid regions [281]. In the between the two MODFLOW \n\
    packages, it was found that MODFLOW-WHaT more accu-\nrately represented the watershed’s\
    \ responses to precipitation \nevents by taking into consideration infiltration\
    \ and subsur-\nface flow that are not well represented in MODFLOW-\nSURFACT [280].\
    \ The authors are unaware of a GIS compo-\nnent to this modeling system or other\
    \ applications. \nWatershed Information System (WISE) \nDeveloped by Watershed\
    \ Concepts, WISE is a GIS-based \nsystem to manage and analyze large amounts of\
    \ water re-\nsources data. The system is primarily used for its open data \nstorage\
    \ management and formatting abilities instead of actu-\nally processing information\
    \ [282]. It is compatible with \nHEC-1, HEC-2, HEC-RAS, FLO-2D, Coastal Hydroscience\
    \ \nAnalysis, Modeling & Predictive Simulation (CHAMPS), \nWave Height Analysis\
    \ for Flood Insurance Studies \n(WHAFIS), Storm Water Management Model (SWMM),\
    \ \nand Windows Hydrological Simulation Program-Fortran \n(WinHSPF) through NonPoint\
    \ Source Model (NPSM). The \nsystem includes several modules discussed below [283].\
    \ \n• Scoping module: This allows users to collect spatial \ndata and assists\
    \ in mapping for flood hazard studies.  \n• Terrain module: Terrain datasets can\
    \ be imported and \nprioritized based on user needs primarily for use in \ndrainage\
    \ studies. \n• Closed system inventory module: This calculates pipe \ncapacities,\
    \ lengths, slopes, and has capabilities for use \nwith catch basins, manholes,\
    \ and piping systems.  \n• Open system inventory module: Used for large scale\
    \ \nhydrologic and hydraulic studies, this module allows \ninput of Total Station\
    \ survey data and provides easy \nexport to the HEC-RAS model.  \n• Hydrology\
    \ module: This module assists in catchment \ndelineation and calculates Time of\
    \ Concentration, \nstage/storage curves and SCS curve numbers. It also \ncan function\
    \ as a pre-processor for HEC-1 and TR-20 \nmodels.  \n• Hydraulics module: Spatial\
    \ data can be integrated to \nbuild hydraulic model input data and is used for\
    \ flood \nmap generation. \n• Water \nquality \nmodule: \nTravel \ntime \nof \n\
    spills/contamination events is computed using dis-\ntance or time interval measures\
    \ and impacted stream \nsegments are color coded. \n• Planning tools module: Aerial\
    \ photos can be used to \nidentify impervious surfaces which are then used to\
    \ \nestimate impact based upon parcel ownership. \n• Wastewater planning module:\
    \ Users can plan and pre-\ndict costs associated with modifying or repairing ex-\n\
    isting wastewater systems or model new systems tak-\ning into consideration costs\
    \ and population projections \n[283]. \nWISE has been used primarily as a flood\
    \ hazard mapping \ntool. USGS New Hapmshire/Vermont Water Science Center \nperformed\
    \ such a study for Carroll County, New Hampshire \n[284], where WISE was primarily\
    \ used for data collection \nand storage. The primary problems faced by those\
    \ involved \n42    The Open Hydrology Journal, 2011, Volume 5 \nDaniel et al.\
    \ \nin the project included lack of or low quality spatial data for \nmapping\
    \ the floodplains [284].  \nWatershed Modeling System (WMS) \nWatershed Modeling\
    \ System (WMS), developed by En-\nvironmental Modeling Systems, Inc. at Brigham\
    \ Young Uni-\nversity, is a comprehensive graphical modeling environment \nfor\
    \ all phases of watershed hydrology and hydraulics [197]. \nWMS includes powerful\
    \ tools to automate modeling proc-\nesses such as automated basin delineation,\
    \ geometric pa-\nrameter calculations, GIS overlay computations including \ncurve\
    \ numbers (CN), rainfall depth, roughness coefficients, \netc., and cross-section\
    \ extraction from terrain data. WMS \nprovides an interface for a variety of hydrologic\
    \ and hydrau-\nlic models within a GIS-based processing framework. Mod-\nels packaged\
    \ within the system include HEC-1, TR-20, TR-\n55, National Flood Frequency Model\
    \ (NFF), Modified Ra-\ntional Method Model (MODRAT), OC Rational, and HSPF \n\
    as hydrologic modeling components. HEC-RAS, Simplified \nDam-Break Model (SMPDBK),\
    \ and CE QUAL W2 provide \nhydraulic modeling capabilities. Gridded Surface Subsurface\
    \ \nHydraulic Analysis (GSSHA), a runoff and infiltration \nmodel from the U.S.\
    \ Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) \nEngineering and Research Development Center\
    \ (ERDC), is \nalso included for 2-D integrated hydrology modeling with \ngroundwater\
    \ interactions. Additional calculations include use \nof the rational method to\
    \ compute peak flows primarily for \nsmall rural watersheds [197]. \nTypical applications\
    \ involve use of the sub-models \nwithin WMS with the overarching system used\
    \ for pre- and \npost-processing of information. An example of this is the \n\
    work done by Omer et al. [214] on evaluating the impact of \ndata resolution on\
    \ hydraulic modeling and floodplain de-\nlineation for Leith Creek in North Carolina.\
    \ Light detection \nand ranging (LIDAR) data is a highly dense but a highly \n\
    informational aerial surveying technique now being em-\nployed in GIS and hydrology\
    \ applications for actions such as \ndelineating catchments and floodplains. Redundancy\
    \ in the \ndata and the massive amounts of data obtained can be trou-\nblesome.\
    \ WMS possesses capabilities to not only utilize this \ndata in applications,\
    \ but also to filter the data to remove un-\nnecessary points. The researchers\
    \ filtered the LIDAR data at \ndifferent levels and then compared HEC-RAS results\
    \ using \neach of the filtered data sets. WMS provided a platform for \nperforming\
    \ the analysis. It was found that filtering of the \ndata improved processing\
    \ time without compromising results \nwith the optimal filter level of at degrees\
    \ [285].  \nFUTURE DEVELOPMENTS IN WATERSHED MOD-\nELING \nWatershed modeling\
    \ involves a comprehensive examina-\ntion of contaminant transport across different\
    \ features found \non the surface and in the subsurface, including the interfaces\
    \ \nbetween. Specific research and advances are focused on sub-\ncomponents of\
    \ watershed modeling. Other areas for future \nconsideration include development\
    \ of guidelines for discern-\ning minimum data resolution requirements, improved\
    \ under-\nstanding of scale-up issues and relationships, and develop-\nment of\
    \ threshold area guidelines for stream network devel-\nopment. Horn et al. [286]\
    \ also suggest that future advance-\nments should include additional capabilities\
    \ to evaluate river \nwater quality such as biological interactions (beyond that\
    \ \ncurrently done for TMDLs]. Research is currently underway \nto address several\
    \ of these needs in watershed modeling. A \nfew notable examples are illustrated\
    \ below.  \nThe U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers\
    \ (USACE) have conducted several re-\nsearch projects on improving watershed and\
    \ related model-\ning including improvements in the capabilities of existing \n\
    models. For example, the USACE Great Lakes Tributary \nModeling Program is developing\
    \ sediment transport models \nfor Great Lakes tributaries [287]. USACE has committed\
    \ to \ndeveloping more of these sediment transport models for \nother Great Lakes\
    \ tributaries [287]. USACE also intends to \ndevelop web-based tools that can\
    \ continue to support water-\nshed planning at smaller tributaries and sub-basins.\
    \ This di-\nrection can potentially lead to the application of sub models \nin\
    \ a more flexible format such as integration with Internet \nGIS tools. Research\
    \ at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \nCoastal Hydraulics Laboratory (CHL) is\
    \ also developing \nimproved sub-models. For example, parameter estimation \n\
    methodologies are being used to enhance existing HEC-\nHMS automated parameter\
    \ estimation capabilities [288]. \nAdditional research is also being done to investigate\
    \ the use \nof artificial neural networks for forecasting streamflows and \nrainfall-runoff\
    \ on watersheds [12, 16, 289, 290]. \nCONCLUSIONS \nThe ability to deliver reliable\
    \ water resources to a grow-\ning population and effectively forecast flooding,\
    \ drought, \nand surface/groundwater water contamination represent in-\ncreasingly\
    \ difficult and interrelated challenges to water re-\nsource managers, engineers,\
    \ and researchers. Such chal-\nlenges necessitate the employment of a more holistic\
    \ ap-\nproach that is capable of examining individual processes and \nsystems\
    \ and the interface between them. This paper identi-\nfied and reviewed current\
    \ technologies and issues involved \nwith performing hydrologic modeling at the\
    \ watershed scale. \nThe topics presented include an observed shift to a more\
    \ \nholistic, watershed-based focus of the regulatory community, \nvarious types\
    \ of watershed-scale models and watershed \nmodeling systems available today,\
    \ use of artificial intelli-\ngence in modeling processes, and issues faced through\
    \ scale-\nup of hydrologic processes and data resolution. The benefits \nof using\
    \ these techniques include the ability to assist water \nresource and watershed\
    \ managers with a variety of applica-\ntions such as evaluating and developing\
    \ TMDLs. Tables 1 \nand 2 provide a summary of watershed-scale models and \nmodeling\
    \ systems reviewed in this paper. Water resource \nmanagers and decision makers\
    \ can employ this summary to \ncompare models and also use as a screening tool\
    \ for select-\ning a watershed model for a specific purpose.  \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\

    Get rights and content Highlights • MODIS level 3 daily data were input to REST2
    to model clear sky GHI and DNI. • MODIS AOD and PW were calibrated using AERONET
    data. • A metric was introduced to remove the correlation due to cycle of solar
    angles. • Calibration of MODIS data improves accuracy of REST2 predicted GHI and
    DNI. • The daily REST2 + calibrated MODIS product outperforms Ineichen model.
    Abstract In order to simulate historical Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) and
    Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) solar resources, a method using MODIS level 3 (L3)
    daily satellite data as input to the REST2 clear sky model is presented to derive
    clear sky solar irradiance for California. MODIS L3 precipitable water (PW) and
    especially aerosol optical depth (AOD) were found to be significantly biased and
    were therefore calibrated based on AOD and PW from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET)
    ground monitoring sites. For reference, MODIS input data was replaced by the following
    input data sources: 3 hourly PW and AOD from Monitoring Atmosphere Composition
    and Climate (MACC) and monthly climatological Linke Turbidity from Solar radiation
    Data (SoDa). Similarly, other clear sky models, specifically Ineichen and McClear,
    were also run for reference. Validation was conducted using irradiance anomalies
    defined as the difference between irradiance and its 15 day moving average against
    ground measurement from California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS),
    National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), and Integrated Surface Irradiance
    Study (ISIS) stations. It was found that the calibration of MODIS data markedly
    improves the accuracy of modeled GHI and DNI anomalies and REST2 clear sky model
    with calibrated MODIS data achieved the highest accuracy among all model and input
    data combinations. The improvement in accuracy of PW and AOD input data through
    calibration is relatively more important than the choice of clear sky model. Previous
    article in issue Next article in issue Keywords REST2MODISGHIDNI 1. Introduction
    Solar energy potential in a specific area depends on the local solar radiation
    resource. Since the atmospheric composition changes over minutes to seasonal and
    sometimes even annual time scales, solar resource assessment requires assessing
    the variation of solar radiation over multiple years (Gurtuna and Prevot, 2011).
    The ideal case is to use data from a well-maintained ground station near the site,
    but this scenario is unlikely since there are few such ground stations throughout
    the world. Alternatively, satellite data consisting of a clear sky model that
    is modulated by a cloud index (Gueymard and Thevenard, 2009, Gueymard and Wilcox,
    2011, Mueller et al., 2004) allows nearly global coverage at fine spatial resolutions
    of one to a few km and temporal resolutions of 5–30 min (Gueymard, 2008, Miller
    et al., 2013, Perez et al., 2013, Renné et al., 2008). Therefore, satellite-derived
    solar irradiation is becoming more widely accepted and important to obtain financing
    for solar power projects (Gueymard, 2012a, Gurtuna and Prevot, 2011, Vignola et
    al., 2012). One critical input to most semi-empirical satellite irradiance models
    is the clear sky irradiance. For example, Jamaly et al. (2012) showed that clear
    sky differences in a satellite based solar resource product, SolarAnywhere, explained
    most of the annual bias at sites throughout California. SolarAnywhere is a 1 km
    high resolution solar resource dataset and provides irradiation derived from Geostationary
    Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) visible imagery at 1 km spatial and
    30 min temporal resolution. REST2, METSTAT and Ineichen are considered the most
    accurate simple broadband clear sky irradiance models with an accuracy of a first
    class pyrheliometer (Gueymard, 2010, Reno et al., 2012). Lefèvre et al. (2013)
    developed an entirely physically-based clear sky model, McClear, with aerosol
    properties (primarily aerosol optical depth, AOD) as well as precipitable water
    (PW) provided by Monitoring Atmosphere Composition and Climate (MACC). MACC combines
    atmospheric modeling with earth observation data including both satellite and
    in-situ data, to provide aerosol properties and total column water vapor globally
    (Kaiser et al., 2012). In this paper, the accuracy of REST2, Ineichen, and McClear
    derived Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) and Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI)
    is compared. The REST2 model accuracy depends mostly on the quality of the input
    data, especially the AOD and PW (Gueymard, 2012b, Reno et al., 2012). A sensitivity
    study and error analysis (Gueymard, 2003) demonstrated that the predicted irradiances
    are very sensitive to errors in the Angstrom turbidity coefficient that is calculated
    using AOD and Angstrom’s wavelength Exponent. Generally, satellite observations
    of AOD over land are less accurate because variable surface reflectance, e.g.
    due to seasonal changes of vegetation, leaves a similar signature as variability
    in AOD (Hauser et al., 2005a). Currently, AOD data is available from e.g. the
    Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer
    (MISR), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite platforms.
    AVHRR has been in orbit continuously since 1981 but an AOD product over land has
    only recently been developed (Hauser et al., 2005b). MISR and MODIS were designed
    for AOD retrievals and provide robust retrievals of AOD over land. Statistical
    comparisons of coincident AOD over land between MISR and MODIS by Kahn et al.
    (2009) showed a correlation coefficient of 0.7. In addition, MODIS provides PW
    with typical errors estimated to range between 5% and 10% (Gao and Kaufman, 2003).
    The combined land and ocean AOD MODIS level 3 (L3) daily (derived from one image
    at the overpass time) product is derived from the 0.55 μm channel of the Terra
    satellite and has been available since 2000. Ruiz-Arias et al. (2012) showed a
    reduction in the bias of GHI and DNI when the MODIS L3 AOD was input to the Goddard
    Space Flight Center (GSFC) shortwave scheme (Chou and Suarez, 1994) in the regional
    Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Ruiz-Arias et al. (2012) also compared
    GHI and DNI from GSFC against REST2 and showed that the GSFC is comparable to
    REST2 for GHI and less accurate than REST2 for DNI. In this paper, AOD, MODIS
    L3 daily PW, and Angstrom exponent are input into REST2 to model clear sky GHI
    and DNI. Since large biases in satellite PW and AOD were observed in California,
    MODIS PW and AOD were calibrated using ground data from 11 AERONET sites (Section
    3). For comparison, MACC reanalysis AOD and PW as well as the derived Angstrom
    exponent from AOD at 0.55 and 1.24 μm (Lefèvre et al., 2013) are input to REST2
    (without calibration). REST2 GHI and DNI and the Ineichen and McClear clear sky
    models are validated against GHI and DNI ground observations (Sections 4 GHI and
    DNI validation methods, 5 Validation). GHI (DNI) anomalies were calculated by
    subtracting the moving average of GHI (DNI) on clear days within a 15 day period
    at the Terra overpass time (see Eq. (9) later). The flow chart for the analysis
    is shown in Fig. 1. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Flow chart for
    the calibrations, model applications, and validations in the paper. 2. Data 2.1.
    REST2 input data Table 1 shows the input parameters to REST2 (Gueymard, 2012b).
    The MODIS aboard two satellites, Terra and Aqua, measures atmospheric, oceanic,
    land surface, and cryospheric features of the entire Earth surface every 1–2 days
    (John, 2014, Remer et al., 2005). Over highly reflective surfaces such as deserts
    (e.g. Sahara) and snow covered mountains, MODIS data is not available (Ruiz-Arias
    et al., 2013). MODIS L3 atmospheric products are available over Daily, 8-Day,
    and Monthly temporal scales. In this paper, the MODIS L3 daily product is chosen,
    which becomes available approximately 20 days after measurement. The daily variability
    of clear sky solar radiation, which is important for solar power forecasting,
    cannot be demonstrated if only monthly data is used, since monthly AOD data captures
    only about half of the AOD variability (Gueymard, 2012c). Ruiz-Arias et al. (2013)
    concluded that MODIS L3 AOD is of sufficient quality to produce accurate GHI at
    the regional scale introducing an uncertainty of approximately 15% in DNI and
    less than 5% for GHI using REST2 (for AOD smaller than 0.5). In this paper we
    show that calibration (Section 3) makes the MODIS L3 AOD and PW more accurate.

    is calculated using the linearization of Angstrom’s law (Gueymard, 2008) which
    yields (1) from (see Table 1 for nomenclature). MODIS L3 AOD at  μm is used for
    and α is the average MODIS L3 Angstrom Exponent (Land) for 0.47 and 0.66 μm. Both
    and α are derived from MODIS L2 data using quality assurance (QA) weighted statistics
    (Hubanks et al., 2008) as where is MODIS L3 AOD or Angstrom exponent, di is the
    L2 AOD or Angstrom exponent, and wi is the L2 QA value.1 While REST2 treats the
    UV and visible (from 0.29 to 0.70 μm), and near-infrared (from 0.7 to 4 μm) bands
    separately (Gueymard, 2008), the α above is used for both bands because Angstrom
    exponents are only available for 0.47 and 0.66 μm. Since the average MODIS pixel
    elevation is different from that of an AERONET ground site within the pixel, and,
    on average, AOD tends to decrease exponentially with altitude in the free troposphere
    the scale height (Ha) concept (Gueymard and Thevenard, 2009) is used to correct
    for elevation changes as (2) where h0 is the average elevation of the MODIS pixel
    derived from the 1 km by 1 km elevation data from the Weather Research and Forecasting
    (WRF) model within the MODIS pixel (see Table 4, Section 3); h is the elevation
    of the corresponding AERONET site; AOD(h0) is the MODIS L3 AOD before elevation
    correction; and Ha is 2100 m for the six coastal (CalTech, El Segundo, La Jolla,
    Monterey, Trinidad Head and UCSB) and 2900 m for the six inland AERONET sites
    respectively. Similarly, MODIS L3 PW is corrected for elevation using Eq. (2)
    since water vapor is concentrated near the surface; Hw is 2100 m for coastal and
    2500 m for inland AERONET sites respectively. We use the following elevation-corrected
    MODIS products from the Terra satellite: Aerosol Optical Thickness at 0.55 μm
    for both Ocean and Land (variable name: “Optical_Depth_Land_And_Ocean_Mean”) and
    Precipitable Water Vapor (IR Retrieval, variable name: “Atmospheric_Water_Vapor_QA_Mean”).
    Pressure is temporally interpolated from 3 hourly pressure from the NCEP North
    American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) which assimilates comprehensive observational
    data. NARR pressure is extrapolated to the ground station elevation using (3)
    where p2 and h2 are the pressure and elevation of the ground station, p1 is 3
    hourly NARR pressure at the Terra overpass time, h1 is the average elevation of
    the NARR pixel covering the ground station and R is the gas constant for dry air.
    NARR temperature is used as T which is a reasonable assumption because of small
    sensitivity and small height differences between ground stations and NARR pixels.
    MACC reanalysis has been provided by the European Center for Medium-range Weather
    Forecast (ECMWF) since 2003. MODIS total aerosol optical depth is assimilated
    in the MACC reanalysis aerosol optical properties (Bellouin et al., 2013, Benedictow
    et al., 2014). However, unlike MODIS L3 which is an area average, MACC data are
    gridded point data (ECMWF, 2014). In this paper, MACC reanalysis 3 hourly data
    at 0.125° spatial resolution from MACC (2014) are used including “Total Aerosol
    Optical Depth at 550 nm”, “Total Aerosol Optical Depth at 1240 nm” as well as
    “Total column water vapour”. MACC Angstrom exponents are derived from AOD at 0.55
    and 1.24 μm (Lefèvre et al., 2013) using (4) where and optical thickness at  μm
    and  μm. Scale height corrections are also applied to MACC AOD and PW data and
    the MACC grid point elevation (h0 in Eq. (2)) is calculated from the MACC surface
    geopotential height and provided in Table 4. 2.2. Ineichen input data Ineichen
    and Perez (2002) developed a clear sky model for GHI based on the Linke turbidity
    factor TL. In this paper the Ineichen model serves as a benchmark for other more
    complicated models. Ineichen (2008a) developed an expression for TL (for airmass
    equal to 2) as a function of atmospheric water vapor, aerosol optical depth, and
    altitude of the site as (5) where p0 is the sea level atmospheric pressure. Eq.
    (5) showed negligible mean bias difference when evaluated against the radiative
    transfer model Modtran (Berk et al., 1989). Using Eq. (5), both MODIS and MACC
    data are converted to TL and input to Ineichen model. In addition the Ineichen
    model is run with climatological TL input data from Solar radiation Data (SoDa),
    a global TL database based on satellite data (Remund et al., 2003, SoDa, 2012).
    2.3. McClear input data A free Web service2 delivers historical timeseries of
    global McClear clear sky irradiation with time steps as short as 1 min. The inputs
    to McClear are summarized in Table 2. Table 2. McClear inputs. In addition, solar
    zenith angle and other parameters related to geographical location and time are
    required. MCD43C1 are MODIS L3 16-day products at spatial resolution of 0.05°
    and provide three parameters fully describing the bidirectional reflectance distribution

    aerosol species (Benedetti et al., 2009) 2.4. AERONET data The AERONET (Aerosols
    Robotic Network, Holben et al., 1998, Holben et al., 2001) is a globally distributed
    network of identical robotically controlled ground-based sun photometers which
    measure atmospheric aerosol properties and compute AOD at three data quality levels:
    Level 1.0 (unscreened), Level 1.5 (cloud-screened), and Level 2.0 (cloud-screened
    and quality-assured). Since AERONET does not measure at 0.55 μm the comparison
    with MODIS L3 AOD at 0.55 μm requires that AOD at 0.55 μm is calculated from the
    level 2.0 AOD centered at 0.675 μm together with the level 2.0 Angstrom exponent
    derived from the 0.44 and 0.87 μm channels, consistent with Ruiz-Arias et al.
    (2013). Only AERONET sites (Table 4) that were continuously in operation for at
    least 190 days between 2009 and 2011 were selected. Three AERONET sites outside
    California are included because they are expected to be more representative of
    the eastern part of California, where considerable utility-scale solar power plant
    development is occurring. 2.5. CIMIS, NREL and ISIS validation data The California
    Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS) with 124 active weather stations
    is operated by the Department of Water Resources and has been operational since
    1982 (CIMIS, 2009a). Each CIMIS station is equipped with a Li-Cor LI200S photodiode
    pyranometer accurate to ±5% based on sensor specifications (CIMIS, 2009b) and
    GHI is reported as an hourly average of 60 samples within the hour. A CIMIS station
    maintenance visit is called for every three or four weeks during the warmer months
    of the year and every five or six weeks during the cooler months (CIMIS, 2015).
    During the maintenance visit, the CIMIS stations sensors are checked for operation
    and accuracy and cleaned or replaced as needed. Since CIMIS stations are not centrally
    maintained, data quality issues exist for individual stations and this motivated
    a careful additional quality control by the authors. CIMIS provides quality control
    based on data averages, standard deviations, theoretical limits, and other procedures
    described by Meek and Hatfield (1994) and Eching and Moellenberndt (1998) and
    suspicious data is flagged and was removed for the analysis in this paper. Since
    this quality control is not sufficient to detect small measurement biases, Luoma
    and Kleissl (2012) visually examined data from each CIMIS station individually
    and excluded all questionable data. This manual quality control yielded 65 sites
    with higher quality data (Jamaly et al., 2012). However, post-processing corrections
    for air mass, temperature and spectral effects are not applied here (Geuder et
    al., 2009, Geuder et al., 2008, King and Myers, 1997, Vignola, 2006). Moreover,
    the GHI from the clear sky models is also compared with presumably more accurate
    ground measured GHI from the Integrated Surface Irradiance Study (ISIS, Hicks
    et al., 1996) site in Hanford and several National Renewable Energy Laboratory
    (NREL) supported sites shown in Table 3. ISIS uses Eppley Precision Spectral Pyranometers
    and a Normal Incidence Pyrheliometer to measure GHI and DNI directly and report
    it as 3 min averages. ISIS also provides the quality control flag following each
    measurement: a zero flag indicates a valid data point that passed all quality
    control checks; a flag greater than zero indicates that data failed at least one
    level of quality control. The NREL sites gather 1 minute DNI and GHI and instruments
    are listed in Table 3. The NREL sites do not contain flags, but the data was visually
    examined for outliers by comparing irradiance on clear days against the REST2
    + Calibrated MODIS clear sky model and found to be consistent. Since soiling is
    a particular concern for DNI measurements, the station environment were verified
    to be far away from large sources of soiling (highways, agricultural) and no evidence
    of rapid soiling was found in the clear sky data comparison. Maintenance records
    were requested for all sites and the records for Humboldt State University (HSU),
    Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD), Loyola Marymount University (LMU),
    University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) and ISIS Hanford show frequent maintenance
    visits during the period of interest. Table 3. Geographical information on GHI
    and DNI validation sites: 4 NREL sites and 1 ISIS site in Hanford (last row).

    US are generally small with annual means smaller than 0.1 and will affect GHI
    only by less than 5% (Ruiz-Arias et al., 2013). The inland sites tend to have
    smaller AODs with the exception of Fresno that may be impacted by agricultural
    activity. Overall we observe a significant correlation between MODIS and AERONET
    (0.39–0.73), but MODIS is usually biased large consistent with Ruiz-Arias et al.
    (2013) and (Levy et al., 2010), which may be attributed to the misrepresentation
    of the land surface and/or assumed aerosol properties in the algorithm (Levy et
    al., 2010). Especially, at the inland AERONET stations (e.g. at Goldstone, Fig.
    3) MODIS AOD is up to 7 times larger than AERONET AOD. MODIS AOD biases are generally
    large with the exception of a few coastal sites (e.g. CalTech, Trinidad Head and
    UCSB). Clearly, uncalibrated MODIS AOD is not a suitable input to solar resource
    models. However, due to the significant correlation a linear regression fit could
    remove much of the errors while retaining information on the day-to-day variability
    in AOD. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Comparison of AOD at 0.55
    μm from MODIS and AERONET at Goldstone (Table 4, Table 5) in 2011. Each datapoint
    represents one day, where AERONET data is averaged over ±30 min around the Terra
    overpass time. Data for days with clouds within ±30 min of the Terra overpass
    time were removed. There is no quality assured AERONET level 2.0 AOD from Goldstone
    after Oct 13, 2011. Similarly, MACC AOD is biased large by 128%, on average, which
    is not surprising since MODIS AOD is assimilated into MACC. Our results are consistent
    with Benedictow et al. (2014) who performed evaluation of the MACC reanalysis
    AOD against AERONET level 2.0 AOD for 2003–2012. Their Fig. 3.5.2 illustrates
    high biases in several years (2003–2012) in western, central and northern North
    America. Although the average correlation between MACC and AERONET is only 0.34,
    higher correlations are expected in other parts of the world. 3.2. Validation
    of MODIS L3 daily and MACC reanalysis 3 hourly PW Table 6 compares the MODIS L3
    and MACC reanalysis PW against the 11 AERONET sites. MODIS overestimates at all
    sites, but the largest errors and relative errors come from the coastal sites
    (Fig. 4) with rMBEs greater than 30%, presumably due to a large part of the respective
    MODIS pixels covering the ocean. MACC PW is more accurate than MODIS PW in terms
    of average MBE and MAE. Overall, the correlation coefficients are mostly larger
    than 0.8, so both MODIS and MACC PW are well correlated with AERONET PW. The PW
    and AOD analysis demonstrates that the MODIS products are valuable inputs to clear
    sky solar resource models if bias and most of the MAE are removed through calibration
    against ground data. Table 6. Comparison of MODIS L3 and MACC reanalysis PW against

    diversity of climates which varies from Mediterranean to subarctic. For building
    energy modeling, California is typically divided into 16 Climate Zones (Pacific
    Gas and Electric Company, 2006). We assume that the California Climate Zones are
    representative of atmospheric conditions including PW and AOD. Therefore when
    applying MODIS calibrations, rather than using the nearest AERONET site, the climate
    zones are used to match MODIS calibrations from the 11 AERONET sites to the 49
    MODIS L3 pixels in California (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 3, Fig. 4 a linear regression
    is applied to the AOD and PW data from MODIS versus AERONET in Table 5, Table
    6. One regression is obtained per MODIS pixel using the AERONET sites assigned
    in Table 7 and the regression is then applied to the MODIS data across the entire
    year. Also, the MACC reanalysis AOD and PW could be calibrated in a similar way
    as MODIS products. Table 7. Climate zone, MODIS pixels and corresponding AERONET

    DNI outputs of the following clear sky models were compared with GHI and DNI from
    ground measurements at the Terra overpass time: (a) REST2 with (i) calibrated
    MODIS, (ii) uncalibrated MODIS, and (iii) MACC reanalysis. (b) Ineichen with (i)
    derived TL from uncalibrated and calibrated MODIS L3 data, (ii) monthly climatological
    Linke turbidity from the SoDa database, and (iii) derived TL from MACC reanalysis
    data. (c) 1 min timeseries of McClear irradiation (integral of solar irradiance
    over a time period with units of W h/m2) are downloaded and converted to irradiance
    (has units W/m2) for comparison. Fig. 1 shows a flowchart of all permutations
    of input data and clear sky models. The CIMIS station closest to the center of
    the MODIS pixel or the MACC grid point is used for validation. Since the clear
    sky models provide GHI in clear conditions, data in cloudy conditions within ±30
    min of the Terra overpass time (1000–1100 PST) are removed by retaining only data
    with a CIMIS clear sky index for the hourly interval of larger than 0.9 and smaller
    than 1.1. The clear sky index is calculated using clear sky GHI from the Ineichen
    model (Ineichen, 2008b) with Linke Turbidity monthly climatological averages from
    the SoDa Service (8) Outliers in the data meeting the average clear sky index
    criteria were removed if they differed by more than three standard deviations
    from the annual average GHI. Since the NREL and ISIS sites report 1 min and 3
    min, respectively, GHI and diffuse horizontal irradiance (DHI) an algorithm that
    also considers temporal standard deviations in clear sky index is applied to select
    clear periods (Long and Ackerman, 2000). GHI comparisons result in large correlations
    due to the underlying annual and daily cycle of solar angles. Therefore, Gueymard
    (2012c) used the relative difference between annual average GHI and long-term
    average GHI to define an annual GHI anomaly. Similarly, to test the day-to-day
    variability caused by differences in atmospheric composition, the GHI anomaly
    ΔGHI is here calculated by subtracting the 15 day moving average (only using clear
    days within a 15 day period at the Terra overpass time) from the GHI at Terra
    overpass time on the each day of interest (Eq. (9)). (9) where t is the Terra
    overpass time on the day of interest and i is the clear sky Terra overpass time
    on one of the days within the 15 day period. For DNI, REST2 and McClear are compared
    against 4 NREL and 1 ISIS site for 2009–2011 and Eq. (9) is also applied to calculate
    DNI anomalies ΔDNI. Quality control was conducted by (i) eliminating DNI smaller
    than 100 W m−2 (since only clear conditions were of interest), (ii) eliminating
    flagged (Section 2.5) ISIS measurements, and (iii) applying a triplet stability
    criterion by requiring that 3 subsequent measurements (for NREL 1 min averages
    and for ISIS 3 min averages) vary by less than 3%, (iv) eliminating values that
    differed by more than three standard deviations from the mean, and (v) visually
    detecting and removing outliers in graphs of the fraction of direct horizontal
    to GHI. 5. Validation 5.1. Global horizontal irradiance Fig. 5a shows a typical
    timeseries of CIMIS, REST2 + uncalibrated MODIS, and Ineichen + SoDa predicted
    GHI. By design the climatological Ineichen + SoDa model does not capture the day-to-day
    GHI variability, while the REST2 + uncalibrated MODIS predicted GHI captures the
    range of CIMIS daily variability reasonably well except for when the MODIS AOD
    is biased significantly. For reference, non-anomaly GHI results for relatively
    higher quality and better maintained NREL and ISIS stations are compared in Table
    A-1, Table A-2, Table A-3 (Appendix A). Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    5. Timeseries of CIMIS measured, REST2 + uncalibrated MODIS predicted and Ineichen
    + SoDa predicted GHI (a) and GHI anomaly (b) for uncalibrated MODIS AOD at 0.55
    μm and PW at MODIS pixel #11 and CIMIS station 170 in coastal northern California
    in 2009. Days with clouds within the ±30 min of the Terra overpass time were removed.
    5.2. Global horizontal irradiance anomaly We now focus on anomaly results which
    removes effects of the diurnal cycle resulting in smaller but more relevant correlation
    coefficients and error metrics (Table 8.1, Table 8.2 and Figs. 5b, 7, 8). Anomaly
    errors better illustrate model performance as they are independent of long-term
    measurement biases or erroneous low frequency signals in the sensor data, e.g.
    from soiling. Given that rMBE of anomalies is negligible by design, the rMBE comparison
    is not included in Table 8.1, Table 8.2. The rMAE comparison in Table 8.1 shows
    that the REST2 and Ineichen models with calibrated MODIS exhibit the smallest
    average relative rMAEs of 1.56% and 1.58% respectively, and Ineichen + uncalibrated
    MODIS produces the largest error. Since AODs in the California are generally small
    (Table 4) clear sky GHI is more sensitive to absorption by PW, which explains
    why REST2 and Ineichen with calibrated MODIS have smaller rMAEs than those of
    REST2 and Ineichen with uncalibrated MODIS. Ineichen + SoDa, the only model with
    monthly climatological input data, shows smaller rMAE than Ineichen + uncalibrated
    MODIS, but also the lowest correlation (Table 8.2) since the day-to-day variability
    and deviations from the climatology are not considered. Comparing REST2 and Ineichen
    with the same input data, REST2 outperforms the rMAE of Ineichen. Table 8.1. rMAE
    of REST2 (columns 5, 6, and 11), Ineichen (columns 7–9, and 12) and McClear (column
    10) predicted GHI anomalies against CIMIS, NREL and ISIS measured GHI anomalies.
    Anomalies were calculated by subtracting 15 day moving averages (Eq. (9)). The
    other columns are (1) the MODIS pixel number, (2) the CIMIS station ID (rows 2–28)
    and names of NREL (rows 29–32) and ISIS sites (row 33), (3) the AERONET site that
    was used to calibrate MODIS AOD and PW, and (4) the distance (km) between the
    center of the MODIS pixel and the ground station. Further, “cal_” means that MODIS
    data was “calibrated” (Section 3). All errors are relative errors normalized by
    annual average ground measured GHI. # ID AERONET Distance (km) REST2 + MODIS Ineichen

    + indicate AERONET sites. Number in boxes is the MODIS pixel number. Since REST2
    with calibrated MODIS achieves the smallest rMAE, we proceed to evaluate the impact
    of MODIS calibration on the results. Fig. 6 compares REST2 predicted GHI anomaly
    for uncalibrated and calibrated MODIS AOD and PW. Similarly, for most other MODIS
    pixels, the erroneous enhancement of AOD and PW causes the REST2 + uncalibrated
    MODIS predicted GHI anomaly to have a larger variance than the measured GHI anomaly.
    Calibration moves the GHI anomaly data close to the 1:1 line resulting in a large
    reduction in mean absolute errors (on average 27%, Table 8.1) and a small improvement
    in correlation coefficients (from 0.50 to 0.53, on average, Table 8.2). For Ineichen,
    the calibration of MODIS data reduces rMAE by almost 31% and increases the correlation
    coefficients by 10%, on average. Fig. 7, Fig. 8, which spatially display the error
    metrics of GHI from Table 8.1, Table 8.2 for uncalibrated and calibrated MODIS
    input data, confirm that calibration of AOD and PW reduces rMAEs and increases
    correlation coefficients, but spatial patterns or other determinants of errors
    did not emerge from this analysis. 5.3. Direct normal irradiance anomaly While
    Ineichen is a clear sky model for GHI only, for McClear DNI can be calculated
    using the GHI and clear sky diffuse irradiance. Fig. 9 and Table 9 compare ISIS
    and NREL measurements against REST2 predicted DNI anomaly for uncalibrated and
    calibrated MODIS input data. Calibration reduces rMAE of the DNI anomaly by 45%,
    on average (Table 9). The non-anomaly DNI results are compared in Table A-4, Table
    A-5 (Appendix A). While REST2 + calibrated MODIS outperforms the other models,
    the REST2 + uncalibrated MODIS, McClear and REST2 + MACC show nearly the same
    overall performance, which indicates that the results are most sensitive to the
    quality of the input data. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Comparison

    predicting GHI and DNI The GHI and DNI anomaly errors may come from a variety
    of sources. In Section 3 we showed that there are errors in MODIS daily AOD and
    PW when compared to AERONET. The linear calibration of MODIS AOD and PW significantly
    improved the GHI and DNI anomaly errors, but random MODIS errors remain that are
    caused by spatial heterogeneity in AOD and PW fields over the 100 × 100 km MODIS
    L3 pixels, random errors in MODIS measurements, and assumptions in the postprocessing
    algorithms. In addition the MODIS Angstrom exponent fails to provide quantitative
    information about aerosol size over land (Levy et al., 2010). Other error sources
    are the assumption of REST2 inputs other than aerosols and water, such as ground
    albedo, total ozone abundance, total nitrogen dioxide abundance and aerosol single
    scattering albedo for both REST2 bands (Table 1). For example, ground albedo exhibits
    spatial and temporal variability due to land use change and rain or snow. Especially,
    the appearance of snow during winter time in the areas of three CIMIS stations
    (43, 57 and 183) leads to sudden and large changes in ground albedo. Fig. 10a
    shows the timeseries of directional-hemispherical reflectance (DHR) and bi-hemispherical
    reflectance (BHR) for solar spectrum shortwave (SW, 0.4-3 μm) for CIMIS station
    #57. Note that the blue-sky (actual) albedo is the interpolation between BHR and
    DHR using He et al. (2012). (10) where αblue, αws and αbs are the blue-sky, black-sky
    and white-sky albedo, and fdif is the portion of diffuse illumination, which is
    a function of optical depth, solar zenith angle, aerosol type, and band. Over
    the albedo range encountered at snowy sites (0.1–0.9), REST2 GHI varies close
    to linearly and by about 7% for CIMIS station #57 for Angstrom turbidity coefficient,
    Angstrom Exponent, PW, surface pressure and SZA of 0.03, 0.629, 0.75 cm, 880 mb
    and 67°, respectively (Fig. 10b). Albedo changes during the remainder of the season
    (0.1–0.3) only causes less than 1% change in REST2 GHI. Therefore, we suggest
    that measured albedo should be used for snowy sites, while the default albedo
    is sufficiently accurate for other sites where snow is not observed and albedo
    changes are more gradual and of smaller amplitude. Download : Download full-size

    was calculated relative to the reference GHI with albedo equals 0.2. 7. Comparison
    of non-anomaly error metrics against the literature The present study needs to
    be placed in the context of prior applications of REST2 and other clear sky models.
    Utilizing local ground measured data for all REST2 inputs (the best, albeit rare
    scenario) Gueymard (2008) tested the performance of REST2 predictions of GHI and
    DNI using a set of 30 individual measurements obtained at the Southern Great Plain
    (SGP) site of Billings, Oklahoma, USA. MBE and RMSE of GHI were 0% and 0.6% respectively,
    and MBE and RMSE of DNI were 0.3% and 0.8%. Gueymard (2010) validated five models
    to predict clear sky DNI with high quality datasets including aerosol and water
    vapor measurements by sun photometers as inputs against high quality measured
    clear-sky irradiance data. Under such ideal conditions, the REST2, METSTAT and
    Ineichen clear sky models achieved accuracy comparable to that of a first-class
    pyrheliometer (maximum rRMSE for DNI are 2.0%, 5.6% and 4.7% respectively). Rizwan
    et al. (2010) used the REST2 model with precipitable water calculated from measured
    relative humidity and atmospheric temperature to estimate the solar resource at
    four stations in India and the maximum REST2 rRMSE for GHI was 3.4%. In this paper,
    the error metrics of both GHI and DNI in Table A-1, Table A-2, Table A-3, Table
    A-4, Table A-5 (Appendix A) are larger than previously published results, because
    satellite-derived inputs to REST2 are much less accurate. Other investigators
    who used satellite derived inputs include Lefèvre et al. (2013), who validated
    McClear irradiances with MODIS and MACC as inputs against 1 min measurements under
    clear sky conditions at Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) stations in
    various climates. For GHI, the bias was between −6 and 25 W m−2, and RMSE ranged
    between 20 W m−2 (3% of the mean GHI) and 36 W m−2 (5%). The DNI bias ranged between
    −48 and 33 W m−2 and RMSE ranged between 33 W m−2 (5%) and 64 W m−2 (10%). The
    tables in Appendix A presents accuracies consistent with those of Lefèvre et al.
    (2013). Ruiz-Arias et al. (2013) found that MODIS L3 AOD is of sufficient quality
    to produce accurate enough GHI at the regional scale introducing an uncertainty
    of approximately 15% in DNI and less than 5% for GHI (for AOD smaller than 0.5).
    Comparing Table 8.1, Table 8.2 with 9 shows that relative error of DNI anomaly
    is generally larger than that of GHI anomaly, consistent with the findings by
    Ruiz et al. (2013). 8. Conclusions MODIS L3 daily AOD and PW were compared against
    AERONET ground measurements in California. Large biases were observed especially
    in AOD that were removed using a linear regression against AERONET observations
    in a similar climate zone. Validation against ground stations demonstrated that
    bias and random errors of REST2 GHI and DNI prediction are improved when calibrated
    MODIS L3 data is input to REST2. The improvements were quantified using the GHI
    and DNI anomalies thereby removing the issue of the always high correlation due
    to annual and daily cycle of solar angles. The daily REST2 + calibrated MODIS
    product also favorably compared against the anomaly obtained from the (a) REST2
    with MACC reanalysis data, (b) Ineichen model with (i) uncalibrated MODIS L3 data,
    (ii) the monthly climatological SoDa database for Linke turbidity, and (iii) MACC
    reanalysis data, as well as (c) McClear. The Ineichen + calibrated MODIS achieved
    similar accuracy to REST2 + calibrated MODIS, which indicates that the quality
    of the input data is a larger differentiator than the clear sky model. Our new
    operationalizable REST2 + calibrated MODIS product can improve the accuracy of
    satellite-based clear sky solar resource assessment and forecasting to an average
    rMBE of 1.5% and rMAE of anomalies of 1.6%. Since most semi-empirical satellite
    models require clear sky irradiance as a baseline and in California clear sky
    differences can contribute substantially to bias errors in satellite models (Jamaly
    et al., 2012), solar resources can be assessed more accurately and economically
    over a large region. Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank (i) the

    provides validation data for the REST2 GHI and DNI before running means are removed
    to obtain anomalies. Comparison against CIMIS data shows generally positive bias
    errors, which may be an artifact of insufficient maintenance such as soiling (Geuder
    and Quaschning, 2006, Mejia and Kleissl, 2013) of the CIMIS stations that results
    in underestimating solar irradiance by a few percent. Given the less rigorous
    quality of CIMIS data, the results are more questionable and not provided. Table
    A-1, Table A-2, Table A-3 (Table A-4, Table A-5) validate the GHI (DNI) from REST2
    against NREL and ISIS measured GHI (DNI). rMBE in Table A-1 shows that with uncalibrated
    MODIS data, the REST2 and Ineichen underestimate GHI for four out of six stations.
    The general decrease in the GHI errors after calibration of MODIS data is consistent
    with the fact that MODIS usually overestimates AOD compared to AERONET. Since
    calibration decreases MODIS AOD the REST2 predicted GHI increases compared to
    NREL and ISIS measured GHI decreasing errors. On the other hand, for the SMUD
    station, where rMBE of REST2 + MODIS and Ineichen + MODIS is positive, GHI rMBE
    and rMAE also decrease after MODIS calibration, probably because Fresno is the
    only AERONET site where MODIS underestimated PW compared to AERONET. Since the
    decrease in GHI related to calibration of MODIS PW dominates over the increase
    related to calibrated MODIS AOD, GHI errors decrease for SMUD. For the same reason,
    GHI errors increase for the ISIS station Hanford which originally has negative
    GHI rMBE. Table A-1, Table A-2, Table A-3 demonstrate that Ineichen + calibrated
    MODIS predict GHI most accurately, REST2 + calibrated MODIS is slightly less accurate,
    and Ineichen + uncalibrated MODIS is of the lowest accuracy as measured by GHI
    rMAE. REST2 + MACC is shown to have the best performance excluding the REST2 and
    Ineichen + calibrated MODIS, indicating that better quality PW data is more critical
    than AOD in modeling clear sky GHI in California given that transmission of clear
    sky GHI is more determined by PW than generally small AOD. Table A-1. rMBE of

    and MACC data are also investigated as alternative inputs. All errors are relative
    errors normalized by the annual average GHI for each ground station. # ID AERONET

    Table A-4, Table A-5 compare the REST2 predicted DNI with NREL and ISIS DNI. Uncalibrated
    DNI is underestimated significantly for LMU and UNLV compared to the other 3 sites
    possibly due to the relatively large positive bias in uncalibrated AOD from the
    MODIS pixels near Goldstone (Table 5) and uncalibrated PW from MODIS pixels near
    UCSB (Table 6). DNI is much more sensitive to AOD than GHI. Similar to the GHI

    ground stations need to be well maintained to provide accurate data, several data
    quality checks were conducted. Soiling can cause overestimation by clear sky models.
    While soiling typically occurs slowly and is automatically corrected through the
    anomaly method, fast soiling has the potential to affect anomalies. Google Earth
    was used to determine whether surface cover near the site would have potential
    for fast soiling. The NPCS site is located at the Nevada Power Clark Station which
    creates potential for soiling from air pollution. Hanford is situated in an agriculture
    area which creates potential for soiling. The other sites were not found to be
    near sources of fast soiling. Since maintenance records were lacking at NPCS and
    either high AOD days or soiling days occurred around July 1st, the NPCS station
    was excluded in the paper. Further, maintenance records were examined. Afshin
    Andreas, Senior Scientist at National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), provided
    point of contacts for all NREL associated sites. The site hosts who responded
    provided the following records: LMU: Jeremy Pal, Associate Professor at Department
    of Civil Engineering and Environmental Science, Loyola Marymount University, indicated
    that the data before May 2012 was reliable. Based on the LMU maintenance record,
    maintenance was performed at least once a month in 2011. Fig. B-1f confirms that
    the data appear to be of high quality as observation and model data follow the

    of Nevada at Las Vegas, provided a cleaning log that documents cleaning at least
    four times a month in 2011. The model data also captured the observed data very
    well. Hanford: John Augustine, scientist at NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory
    Global Monitoring Division, mentioned that the local hosts at the National Weather
    Service clean the instruments on a weekly basis and did quasi-annual site visits
    to exchange instruments with freshly calibrated units, clean the equipment, and
    conduct preventative maintenance by replacing equipment regularly. For example,
    ventilator fans, data loggers are replaced on a three-year cycle. Fig. B-1, Fig.
    B-2 show DNI and GHI timeseries at 10:30 on every clear day in 2011. Overall,
    there is no obvious fast soiling event or maintenance issues observed for the
    five stations (HSU, SMUD, LMU, UNLV and Hanford) above in 2011. Download : Download

    PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) management practices
    (e.g., conservation tillage, cover crops, and biochar applications) have been
    widely adopted to enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration and to reduce
    greenhouse gas emissions while ensuring crop productivity. However, current measurements
    regarding the influences of CSA management practices on SOC sequestration diverge
    widely, making it difficult to derive conclusions about individual and combined
    CSA management effects and bringing large uncertainties in quantifying the potential
    of the agricultural sector to mitigate climate change. We conducted a meta-analysis
    of 3,049 paired measurements from 417 peer-reviewed articles to examine the effects
    of three common CSA management practices on SOC sequestration as well as the environmental
    controlling factors. We found that, on average, biochar applications represented
    the most effective approach for increasing SOC content (39%), followed by cover
    crops (6%) and conservation tillage (5%). Further analysis suggested that the
    effects of CSA management practices were more pronounced in areas with relatively
    warmer climates or lower nitrogen fertilizer inputs. Our meta-analysis demonstrated
    that, through adopting CSA practices, cropland could be an improved carbon sink.
    We also highlight the importance of considering local environmental factors (e.g.,
    climate and soil conditions and their combination with other management practices)
    in identifying appropriate CSA practices for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions
    while ensuring crop productivity. 1 INTRODUCTION Soil organic carbon (SOC) is
    a primary indicator of soil health and plays a critical role in food production,
    greenhouse gas balance, and climate change mitigation and adaptation (Lorenz &
    Lal, 2016). The dynamic of agricultural SOC is regulated by the balance between
    carbon inputs (e.g., crop residues and organic fertilizers) and outputs (e.g.,
    decomposition and erosion) under long-term constant environment and management
    conditions. However, this balance has been dramatically altered by climate change,
    which is expected to enhance SOC decomposition and weaken the capacity of soil
    to sequester carbon (Wiesmeier et al., 2016). Generally, agricultural soils contain
    considerably less SOC than soils under natural vegetation due to land conversion
    and cultivation (Hassink, 1997; Poeplau & Don, 2015), with a potential to sequester
    carbon from the atmosphere through proper management practices (Lal, 2018). Therefore,
    it is crucial to seek practical approaches to enhance agricultural SOC sequestration
    without compromising the provision of ecosystem services such as food, fiber,
    or other agricultural products. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) has been promoted
    as a systematic approach for developing agricultural strategies to ensure sustainable
    food security in the context of climate change (FAO, 2013). One of the major objectives
    of CSA is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance soil carbon sequestration
    and soil health (Campbell, Thornton, Zougmoré, Asten, & Lipper, 2014; Lipper et
    al., 2014). The key for sequestering more carbon in soils lies in increasing carbon
    inputs and reducing carbon outputs. Frequently recommended approaches for SOC
    sequestration include adding cover crops into the crop rotation, applying biochar
    to soils, and minimizing soil tillage (i.e., conservation tillage). In recent
    decades, these management practices have been applied in major agricultural regions
    globally, and a large number of observations/measurements have been accumulated
    (e.g., Chen, Marhan, Billen, & Stahr, 2009; Clark et al., 2017; Spokas, Koskinen,
    Baker, & Reicosky, 2009). Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the
    positive effects of CSA management practices on SOC sequestration. For example,
    conservation tillage reduces soil disturbance and the soil organic matter decomposition
    rate (Salinas-Garcia, Hons, & Matocha, 1997) and promotes fungal and earthworm
    biomass (Lavelle, Brussaard, & Hendrix, 1999; Briones & Schmidt, 2017), thereby
    improving SOC stabilization (Liang & Balser, 2012). Cover crops provide additional
    biomass inputs from above- and belowground (Blanco-Canqui, Mikha, Presley, & Claassen,
    2011), increase carbon and nitrogen inputs, and enhance the biodiversity of agroecosystems
    (Lal, 2004). Moreover, cover crops can promote soil aggregation and structure
    (Sainju, Whitehead, & Singh, 2003), therefore indirectly reduce carbon loss from
    soil erosion (De Baets, Poesen, Meersmans, & Serlet, 2011). Biochar amendments
    affect SOC dynamics through two pathways: (a) improving soil aggregation and physical
    protection of aggregate-associated SOC against microbial attack; and (b) increasing
    the pool of recalcitrant organic substrates resulting in a low SOC decomposition
    rate and substantial negative priming (Du, Zhao, Wang, & Zhang, 2017; Weng et
    al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2012). Although these CSA management practices have been
    widely used to enhance soil health (e.g., Denef, Zotarelli, Boddey, & Six, 2007;
    Fungo et al., 2017; Thomsen & Christensen, 2004; Weng et al., 2017), their effects
    on SOC sequestration are variable and highly dependent on experiment designs and
    site-specific conditions such as climate and soil properties (Abdalla, Chivenge,
    Ciais, & Chaplot, 2016; Liu et al., 2016; Paustian et al., 2016; Poeplau & Don,
    2015). The potential to sequester soil carbon varies greatly among CSA practices,
    which has not been well addressed. Some studies even suggested negative effects
    of CSA management practices on SOC (e.g., Liang, Zhang, Fang, Yang, & Drury, 2007;
    Tian, Kang, Kolawole, Idinoba, & Salako, 2005). Also, most prior quantitative
    research focused on the effects of a single CSA practice on SOC (e.g., Abdalla
    et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2016; Poeplau & Don, 2015), very few studies estimated
    the combined effects of diverse CSA and conventional management practices. Some
    recent studies reported that a combination of cover crops and conservation tillage
    could significantly increase SOC compared to a single management practice (Ashworth,
    Allen, Wight, Saxton, & Tyler, 2014; Blanco-Canqui, Holman, Schlegel, Tatarko,
    & Shaver, 2013; Duval, Galantini, Capurro, & Martinez, 2016; Higashi et al., 2014).
    For example, Sainju, Singh, Whitehead, and Wang (2006) suggested that soil carbon
    sequestration may increase 0.267 Mg C ha−1 year−1 under a combination of no-till
    and cover crop practices, where the latter was a mixed culture of hairy vetch
    (Vicia villosa) and rye (Secale cereale); in contrast, a carbon loss of 0.967
    Mg C ha−1 year−1 occurred when only no-till was used. Agegnehu, Bass, Nelson,
    and Bird (2016) reported that 1.58% and 0.25% more SOC were sequestered in the
    mid-season and end-season, respectively, under conservation tillage when biochar
    was also applied. These findings highlight the importance of quantitatively evaluating
    the combined effects of multiple CSA management practices (including the combination
    of CSA and conventional management practices) on SOC sequestration under different
    climate and soil conditions. This study aims to fill the abovementioned knowledge
    gap through a meta-analysis to simultaneously examine the effects of three widely
    used CSA management practices (i.e., conservation tillage [no-till, NT; and reduced
    tillage, RT], cover crops, and biochar) on SOC sequestration (Figure 1). Our scientific
    objectives were to: (a) evaluate and compare the effects of conservation tillage,
    cover crops, and biochar use on SOC; (b) examine how environmental factors (e.g.,
    soil properties and climate) and other agronomic practices (e.g., nitrogen fertilization,
    residue management, irrigation, and crop rotation) influence SOC in these CSA
    management environments. Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Relationship

    data from 417 peer-reviewed articles (297 for conservation tillage, 64 for cover
    crops, and 56 for biochar) published from 1990 to May 2017 (Data S1). Among all
    publications, 113 for conservation tillage, 32 for cover crops, and 7 for biochar
    were conducted in the Unites States. All articles were identified from the Web
    of Science. The search keywords were “soil organic carbon” and “tillage” for conservation
    tillage treatments; “soil organic carbon” and “cover crop” for cover crop treatments;
    and “soil organic carbon” and “biochar” for biochar treatments. All selected studies
    meet the following inclusion criteria: (a) SOC was measured in field experiments
    (to estimate the potential of biochar to increase soil carbon, we also included
    soil incubation and pot experiments with regard to biochar use); (b) observations
    were conducted on croplands excluding orchards and pastures; (c) ancillary information
    was provided, such as experiment duration, replication, and sampling depth; and
    (d) other agronomic management practices were included besides the three target
    management practices in this study. We considered conventional tillage as the
    control for NT and RT. Experiments that eliminated any tillage operation were
    grouped into the NT category, and experiments using tillage with lower frequency
    or shallower till-depth or less soil disturbance in comparison to the paired conventional
    tillage (e.g., moldboard plow and chisel plow) were grouped into the RT category.
    Likewise, “no cover crop” and “no biochar” were treated as control experiments
    relative to cover crop and biochar treatments, respectively. We only considered
    studies that viewed cover crops as treatments and fallow (or weeds) as controls.
    SOC data were either derived from tables or extracted from figures using the GetData
    Graph Digitizer software v2.26 (http://getdata-graph-digitizer.com/download.php).
    Other related information from the selected studies was also recorded, including
    location (i.e., longitude and latitude), experiment duration, climate (mean annual
    air temperature and precipitation), soil properties (texture, depth, and pH),
    and other agronomic practices (crop residues, nitrogen fertilization, irrigation,
    and crop rotation). The study durations were grouped into three categories: short
    term (≤5 years), medium term (6–20 years), and long term (>20 years). Climate
    was grouped according to the aridity index published by UNEP (1997) as either
    arid (≤0.65) or humid (>0.65). Study sites were grouped into cool (temperate and
    Mediterranean climates) and warm zones (semitropical and tropical climates; Shi,
    Luo, Fan, & Ping, 2010). Soil texture was grouped as silt loam, sandy loam, clay
    and clay loam, loam, silty clay and silty clay loam, and loamy sand according
    to the USDA soil texture triangle. Soil depth was grouped as 0–10 cm, 10–20 cm,
    20–50 cm, and 50–100 cm. Soil pH was grouped as acidic (<6.6), neutral (6.6–7.3),
    and alkaline (>7.3). Crop residue management was grouped as “residue returned”
    and “residue removed.” We only included those studies that used the same residue
    management in the control and treatment groups. Similarly, nitrogen fertilization
    was grouped into no addition, low (1–100 kg N/ha), medium (101–200), and high
    levels (>200). Irrigation management was grouped as irrigated or rainfed. Crop
    sequence was grouped as rotational or continuous crops (including crop-fallow
    systems). We also estimated the response of SOC in the whole-soil profiles (from
    the soil surface to 120 cm, with an interval of 10 cm) to CSA management practices.
    The standard deviation (SD) of selected variables, an important input variable
    to the meta-analysis, was computed as SD = SE × , where SE is the standard error
    and n is the number of observational replications. If the results of a study were
    reported without SD or SE, SD was calculated based on the average coefficient
    of variation for the known data. Publication bias was analyzed by the method of
    fail-safe number, which suggests that the meta-analysis can be considered robust
    if the fail-safe number is larger than 5 × k + 10 (where k is the number of observed
    studies; Rothstein, Sutton, & Borenstein, 2005). 2.2 Meta-analysis A random-effect
    model of meta-analysis was used to explore environmental and management variables
    that might explain the response of SOC to CSA management practices. The data analysis
    was performed in R (R Development Core Team, 2009). The response ratio (RR) was
    defined as the ratio between the outcome of CSA management practices and that
    of the control group. The logarithm of RR () was calculated as the effect size
    of each observation (Hedges, Gurevitch, & Curtis, 1999, Equation (1)): (1) where
    and are SOC values in the treatment and control groups, respectively. The variance
    (ν) of was computed as: (2) where and are the standard deviations of the treatment
    and control groups, respectively, while and are the sample sizes of the treatment
    and control groups, respectively. The weighting factor (), as the inverse of the
    variance, was computed for each observation to obtain a final weighting factor
    (), which was then used to calculate the mean effect size (RR++). The equations
    were: (3) (4) (5) where  =  is the weighted effect size, n is the total number
    of observations per study, and is the th observation. The 95% confidence intervals
    (CI) of were computed to determine statistical significance. The comparison between
    treatment and control was considered significant if the 95% CIs did not overlap
    zero (vertical lines in the graphs). The percent change was transformed −1) ×
    100%] to explain the response of the estimated CSA management practices. 3 RESULTS
    3.1 SOC responses to conservation tillage, cover crops, and biochar Biochar applications
    enhanced SOC storage by 39% (28% in the field and 57% in incubation and pot experiments,
    Figure S1), representing the most effective practice, followed by cover crops
    (6%) and conservation tillage (5%; Figure 2). Cover crop species had a pronounced
    positive effect on SOC sequestration (Figure S1), ranging from 4% for nonleguminous
    cover crops to 9% for leguminous cover crops. When investigating different types
    of conservation tillage, NT and RT had similar effects on SOC (approximately 8%
    increase). All results were statistically significant (Figure 2). Theoretically,
    the combination of CSA management practices may result in greater or lesser effects
    on soil sequestration compared to single CSA management practice. However, if
    synergistic effects were the prevalent interactions, this combination might potentially
    enhance carbon accumulation (e.g., over 50% increase in SOC), which is subject
    to further investigation in field experiments. Across the whole dataset we compiled,
    the SOC varied widely in each CSA treatment (Figure S2). We calculated the distribution
    of the data points (the ratio of SOC of each treatment to that of the corresponding
    control, i.e., NT/RT vs. conventional tillage, cover crops vs. no cover crop,
    and biochar use vs. non-biochar; Figure S2). Most of the studies used in this
    meta-analysis reported positive responses of SOC to NT, RT, cover crops, and biochar
    treatment (60%, 65%, 68%, and 91%, respectively). The SOC change rates were 0.38
    ± 0.71 Mg ha−1 year−1 (n = 56) and −0.29 ± 0.79 Mg ha−1 year−1 (n = 30) in NT
    and RT systems, respectively (Figure S3). We did not calculate SOC sequestration
    rates for other treatments (i.e., cover crops and biochar) due to the lack of
    some ancillary information (e.g., bulk density). Figure 2 Open in figure viewer

    entire dataset. Numbers in parentheses represent the number of observations. Error
    bars represent 95% confidence intervals. NT, no-till; RT, reduced tillage; SOC,
    soil organic carbon 3.2 Effects of CSA management practices in different climate
    zones Overall, CSA management practices sequestered more SOC in arid areas than
    in humid areas (Figure 3a). Biochar and cover crops increased 12% (38% vs. 26%)
    and 3% (9% vs. 6%) more SOC in arid areas, respectively, compared to humid areas.
    In comparison, the NT-induced SOC uptake was slightly higher in arid areas than
    that in humid areas (9% and 8%, respectively). However, the RT-induced SOC increment
    in arid areas was two times greater than that in humid areas. Our further analysis
    suggested that CSA management practices significantly increased SOC in both cool
    and warm climate zones with diverse responses (Figure 3b). For example, in warm
    areas, biochar applications only increased SOC by half of the enhancement observed
    in cool areas. Cover crops increased SOC by 15% in warm areas, three times larger
    than that in cool areas. In warm areas, NT increased SOC by 15% compared to 8%
    in cool areas. Reduced tillage increased SOC by 7% and 6% in warm and cool areas,
    respectively. Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Comparison of climate-smart
    management versus their controls for subcategories of climate zone (a: the climate
    zones were divided by aridity index; b: the climate zones were divided by mean
    annual air temperature). Numbers in parentheses represent the number of observations.
    Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. NT, no-till; RT, reduced tillage;
    SOC, soil organic carbon 3.3 Effects of CSA management practices with different
    soil properties The effects of CSA management practices on SOC were strongly influenced
    by soil texture (Figure 4). Biochar applications increased SOC by 63%, 62%, and
    52% in silty clay and silty clay loam soils, loam soils, and loamy sand soils,
    respectively. While relatively lower soil carbon uptakes under biochar applications
    were found in clay loam and clay soils (32%), silt loam soils (35%), and sandy
    loam soils (34%). Cover crops increased SOC by 4%, 6%, 7%, and 6% in clay loam
    and clay soils, silt loam soils, loam soils, and sandy loam soils, respectively.
    No-till increased SOC by 16% in silty clay and silty clay loam soils, compared
    to 12% in sandy loam soils and 7% in loamy sand soils. Reduced tillage increased
    SOC by 21%, 7%, and 15% in silty clay and silty clay loam soils, loam soils, and
    loamy sand soils, respectively. Overall, cover crops sequestered more carbon in
    coarse-textured soils than in fine-textured soils. In contrast, NT and RT increased
    SOC more in fine-textured soils than in coarse-textured soils. No obvious relationship
    was found between biochar use and soil textures. Figure 4 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Comparison of climate-smart management versus their controls for subcategories
    of soil textures. Numbers in parentheses represent the number of observations.
    Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. NT, no-till; RT, reduced tillage;
    SOC, soil organic carbon The positive effects of CSA management practices on SOC
    decreased with soil depth (Figure 5). Biochar significantly increased SOC by 41%
    and 14% in the 0–10 cm and 0–30 cm soil layers, respectively (Table S1). Cover
    crops significantly increased SOC by 9%, 3%, and 9% in the 0–10 cm, 10–20 cm,
    and 20–50 cm depth ranges, respectively. Further analysis showed that cover crops
    could increase SOC (5%) in the entire 0–70 cm soil profile (Table S1). Both NT
    and RT could significantly increase SOC most at 0–10 cm depth (22% and 17%, respectively).
    Although reduced SOC was observed in the 10–20 cm and 20–50 cm soil layers (−4%
    and −10%, respectively), NT could still enhance SOC sequestration in the entire
    soil profile up to 120 cm (Table S1). In comparison, RT could increase SOC in
    the 0–70 cm soil profile (Table S1) although decreased soil carbon (not statistically
    significant) was observed in the 10–50 cm soil layer (Figure 5). Figure 5 Open

    controls for subcategories of soil depth. Numbers in parentheses represent the
    number of observations. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. NT, no-till;
    RT, reduced tillage; SOC, soil organic carbon. The average depths of each categorical
    group were presented in supplementary files (Tables S4–S7) All CSA management
    practices except RT positively influenced the SOC pool regardless of soil pH.
    The management-induced SOC uptake was generally higher in alkaline soils than
    in acid soils (Figure 6). Biochar use increased SOC by 65%, 35%, and 28% in alkaline,
    neutral, and acid soils, respectively. Cover crops increased SOC by 15% in neutral
    soils, followed by alkaline (9%) and acid soils (6%). No-till increased SOC by
    6% in acid soils and 13% in alkaline soils. The SOC increased by RT was greater
    in alkaline soils (9%) than in acid soils (6%), but RT had no significant influence
    on SOC in neutral soils. Figure 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Comparison

    The CSA management practices are generally applied together with other agronomic
    practices such as residue return, nitrogen fertilizer use, and irrigation. These
    agronomic practices may interact with the CSA management practices with positive
    or negative effects on the capacity of soils to sequester carbon. In this study,
    we considered experiment duration and four other agronomic practices, including
    residue return, nitrogen fertilization, irrigation, and crop sequence, to quantify
    these effects. Our results demonstrated that the influences of three CSA management
    practices on SOC varied with experiment duration. Biochar amendments significantly
    increased SOC by 45% and 36% in short-term and medium-term experiments, respectively.
    Cover crops significantly increased SOC by 5%, 11%, and 20% in the short-term,
    medium-term, and long-term experiments, respectively (Figure 7). No-till significantly
    increased SOC by 13% in the long-term experiments, followed by medium-term (7%)
    and short-term experiments (6%). Reduced tillage increased SOC by 12% in long-term
    studies, followed by medium-term (9%) and short-term experiments (3%). The average
    durations differed in each group (Table S2), which may influence the effect of
    CSA management practices on SOC. When excluding short and medium experiment durations
    (≤20 years) and shallow sampling (<20 cm), RT significantly increased SOC by 14%,
    while NT had no significant effect on SOC (Figure S4). Figure 7 Open in figure

    neither cover crops nor RT had a significant effect on SOC, although there was
    a significant increase in SOC under NT (5%). Figure 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint

    SOC, soil organic carbon Our results suggested that nitrogen fertilizer use could
    alter the magnitude of soil carbon uptake induced by CSA management practices.
    Biochar boosted SOC the most among CSA management practices regardless of nitrogen
    fertilizer levels, with the strongest effects under the low-level nitrogen inputs,
    followed by the high-level (38%), medium-level (29%), and no nitrogen fertilizer
    use (27%; Figure 9). Cover crops increased SOC by 6% under both low-level and
    medium-level nitrogen inputs, slightly higher than that under the high-level nitrogen
    fertilizer use (3%). No-till tended to sequester more soil carbon when nitrogen
    fertilizer input was relatively lower (11%, 8%, and 6% for low-level, medium-level,
    and high-level nitrogen fertilization, respectively). While RT increased SOC by
    13% at the medium-level nitrogen fertilizer rate, approximately two times larger
    than those under the low-level and high-level nitrogen fertilizer use (Figure
    9). Figure 9 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Comparison of climate-smart management

    results suggested that biochar markedly stimulated SOC increases in irrigated
    croplands (49%), three times higher than those under rainfed condition. Similarly,
    NT increased SOC by 15% in irrigated croplands, twice as much soil carbon as that
    in rainfed croplands. Cover crops increased SOC by 7% and 4% in irrigated and
    rainfed croplands, respectively. In contrast, the RT-induced SOC increase was
    16% under the rainfed condition, 5% higher than that in irrigated croplands (Figure
    10a). Figure 10 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Comparison of climate-smart management

    carbon The CSA management practices significantly promoted SOC uptakes in both
    rotational and continuous cropping systems (Figure 10b). Specifically, biochar
    amendments enhanced SOC by 52% in rotational cropping systems, much higher than
    that in the continuous cropping system (31%). While SOC uptakes induced by NT
    and RT showed no obvious differences in the rotational and continuous cropping
    systems (9% and 8% vs. 8% and 7%). Cover crops increased SOC by 4% in rotational
    cropping systems, lower than that in continuous cropping systems (8%). 3.5 Combinations
    of CSA management practices Our results demonstrated that combining different
    CSA management practices might significantly enhance SOC sequestration. In warm
    regions, SOC increased by 13% with the combination of conservation tillage and
    cover crops (Figure 11). In loamy sand and sandy clay loam soils, associated SOC
    uptakes increased to 31% and 21%, respectively. A similar effect was also observed
    in medium-term experiments. However, in clay soils, the combination of cover crops
    and conservation tillage significantly decreased SOC by 19%. Figure 11 Open in

    4.1 Effects of CSA management practices on SOC Common approaches for enhancing
    SOC focus on increasing carbon inputs, decreasing losses, or simultaneously affecting
    both inputs and losses. All CSA management practices discussed here, that is,
    biochar, cover crops, and conservation tillage, increase soil carbon sequestration
    to different extents. For example, SOC enhancement by biochar applications can
    reach up to 40% (Liu et al., 2016), while conservation tillage and cover crops
    increase SOC by only 3%–10% (Abdalla et al., 2016; Du, Angers, Ren, Zhang, & Li,
    2017; Luo, Wang, & Sun, 2010; Zhao et al., 2017) and ~10% (Aguilera, Lassaletta,
    Gattinger, & Gimeno, 2013), respectively. Our results agree with these earlier
    findings: biochar use increased SOC by 39%, followed by cover crops (6%) and conservation
    tillage (5%). The discrepancies among various CSA management practices in enhancing
    SOC fundamentally lie in their functional mechanisms. Biochar addition, with a
    low turnover rate, contributes directly to soil carbon storage and indirectly
    decreases native SOC decomposition rates by negative priming (Wang, Xiong, & Kuzyakov,
    2016). Cover crops are green manure that increases carbon inputs to the soil and
    subsequent SOC (Poeplau & Don, 2015). Conservation tillage practices may not necessarily
    add carbon; their contribution is primarily accomplished by protecting SOC from
    decomposition and erosion (Lal, 2005; Six, Elliott, & Paustian, 2000). Additionally,
    all three CSA management practices can potentially improve soil properties, thereby
    stimulating more carbon inputs from residue return and rhizodeposition due to
    promoted plant growth, and reducing carbon losses via decreasing leaching and
    erosion. However, the effectiveness of these practices on SOC sequestration and
    the mechanisms involved vary with environmental factors and other agronomic practices.
    4.2 Environmental control in CSA management practices Environmental factors such
    as climate and soil properties may influence carbon inputs to the soil and affect
    the processes that regulate carbon loss, considering that all CSA practices are
    implemented in site-specific climate and soil conditions. The effects of CSA management
    practices on SOC could be biased by environmental factors. 4.2.1 Climate variability
    Climate is one of the major driving forces that regulate SOC distribution. On
    average, SOC accumulation is greater than decomposition in wet areas than in dry
    and warm regions (Jobbágy & Jackson, 2000). Soil carbon is positively related
    to precipitation and negatively correlated with temperature (Rusco, Jones, & Bidoglio,
    2001), with the former correlation tending to be stronger (Martin, Wattenbach,
    Smith, & Meersmans, 2011; Meersmans et al., 2011). High precipitation is usually
    associated with abundant growth and high rates of carbon inputs to soils (Luo,
    Feng, Luo, Baldock, & Wang, 2017), while low temperatures may remarkably reduce
    microbial activity, resulting in low rates of organic matter decomposition and
    measurable amounts of SOC accumulation (Castro, Steudler, Melillo, Aber, & Bowden,
    1995; Garcia, Nannipieri, & Hernandez, 2018). Biochar applications result in greater
    SOC accumulation in arid/cool areas than in humid/warm environments (Figure 3),
    probably due to the porous structure and the capacity of biochar to promote greater
    soil water retention (Abel et al., 2013; Karhu, Mattila, Bergström, & Regina,
    2011). It is not clear why biochar has a greater impact on SOC accrual in cool
    regions. A possible explanation is that high soil temperatures may promote biochar
    decomposition and oxidation (Cheng, Lehmann, Thies, & Burton, 2008). Cover crops
    and NT increased SOC with no significant difference between aridity conditions
    (Table 1), although they performed better at storing SOC in arid areas (Figure
    3a). This result suggests that arid-region soils have a high potential to store
    carbon when using proper management practices (Tondoh et al., 2016). In addition,
    cover crops and NT can enhance carbon sequestration more in warm areas than in
    cool areas. Temperature could affect the establishment and growth of cover crops
    (Akemo, Regnier, & Bennett, 2000). In warm areas, cover crops may develop well
    and potentially capture more carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, thus providing
    more carbon inputs into soils after they die (e.g., Bayer, Dieckow, Amado, Eltz,
    & Vieira, 2009). Table 1. Between-group variability (QM) of the variables controlling

    results in the breakdown of macroaggregates and the release of aggregate-protected
    SOC (Mikha & Rice, 2004; Six et al., 2000). Tillage-induced SOC decomposition
    usually proceeds at higher rates in warm than in cool areas. Implementing NT,
    with minimal soil disturbance, protects SOC from decomposition. As a result, SOC
    increases can be more significant in warm conditions considering the relatively
    higher baseline of the decomposition rate compared to that in cool areas. 4.2.2
    Soil properties Soil organic carbon is strongly correlated with clay content,
    with an increasing trend toward more SOC in fine-textured soils (Meersmans et
    al., 2012; Stronkhorst & Venter, 2008). The SOC mineralization rate probably diminishes
    as clay concentrations increase (Sainju, Singh, & Whitehead, 2002). Clay minerals
    can stabilize SOC against microbial attack through absorption of organic molecules
    (Ladd, Foster, Nannipieri, & Oades, 1996). By binding organic matter, clay particles
    help form and stabilize soil aggregates, imposing a physical barrier between decomposer
    microflora and organic substrates and limiting water and oxygen available for
    decomposition (Dominy, Haynes, & Antwerpen, 2002). Biochar use and cover crops
    promote carbon sequestration for all soil texture types. Such an enhancement of
    SOC does not vary significantly with soil texture (Table 1). The ability of conservation
    tillage to enhance SOC, however, differs with soil texture (Figure 4). Conservation
    tillage merely reduces soil disturbance and normally does not add extra materials
    to soils. It can be inferred that the effect of conservation tillage on SOC is
    more texture dependent than the other two management practices. Biochar is a carbon-rich
    material with a charged surface, organic functional groups, and a porous structure,
    which can potentially increase soil aggregation and cation exchange capacity (Jien
    & Wang, 2013). Similarly, cover crops directly provide carbon inputs to soils,
    and their root development and rhizodeposition can also benefit soil structure.
    These benefits are embedded in the source of biochar and cover crops per se. Thus,
    the effectiveness of biochar and cover crops in increasing SOC may depend on their
    properties other than soil texture. Soil depth may potentially influence the effects
    of the CSA practices on SOC (Baker, Ochsner, Venterea, & Griffis, 2007). The CSA
    practices were most beneficial to SOC accumulation in surface soils. For example,
    NT increased SOC by 7% in the 0–3 cm soil layer (Abdalla et al., 2016) and by
    3% at the 40 cm depth (Luo et al., 2010). Our findings suggested that CSA practices
    can enhance SOC sequestration in the entire soil profile, although the positive
    effects vary with soil depths (Table S1). Conventional tillage breaks soil aggregates
    and increases aeration and thus enhances soil organic matter mineralization (Cambardella
    & Elliott, 1993). Conventional tillage also incorporates residues into deeper
    soil layers, resulting in a more uniform distribution of SOC (albeit at lower
    concentrations) in the soil profile (Plaza-Bonilla, Cantero-Martinez, & Alvaro-Fuentes,
    2010; Sainju et al., 2006). In contrast, conservation tillage keeps residues at
    the soil surface and reduces their degree of incorporation into soil (Franzluebbers,
    Hons, & Zuberer, 1995). Nevertheless, positive effects of NT on SOC have been
    found in a deep soil profile (0–60 cm, Liu et al., 2014). As noted, in the 10–50
    cm soil layer, the effect of cover crops on SOC was found to be the greatest among
    all the CSA management practices we discussed (Figure 5). This is perhaps because
    much of the crop and cover crop root growth occurs in the surface soil (e.g.,
    Box & Ramsuer, 1993; Sainju, Singh, & Whitehead, 1998) and the generally greater
    contribution of roots to SOC than aboveground biomass (Allmaras, Linden, & Clapp,
    2004; Balesdent & Balabane, 1996). Soil pH is recognized as a dominant factor
    governing the soil organic matter turnover rate, although its mode of impact is
    still unclear (Van Bergen, Nott, Bull, Poulton, & Evershed, 1998). Soil pH affects
    selective presentation or metabolic modification of specific components (e.g.,
    lignin-cellulose, lipids) during decomposition (Kemmitt, Wright, Goulding, & Jones,
    2006) and therefore abiotic factors (e.g., carbon and nutrient availability) and
    biotic factors (e.g., the composition of the microbial community). Also, soil
    pH can change the decomposition rate of crop residues and SOC via its effect on
    SOC solubility and indirectly by altering microbial growth, activity, and community
    structure (Pietri & Brookes, 2009; Wang, Butterly, Baldock, & Tang, 2017). The
    levels of soluble organic carbon may increase with increasing acidity (Kemmitt
    et al., 2006; Willett, Reynolds, Stevens, Ormerod, & Jones, 2004). Motavalli,
    Palm, Parton, Elliott, and Frey (1995) suggested that increased soil acidity would
    cause greater soil organic matter accumulation due to reduced microbial mineralization;
    however, this was challenged by Kemmitt et al. (2006) who found no significant
    trend in SOC in response to pH changes. In this study, most CSA management practices
    resulted in greater increases in SOC in neutral or alkaline soils compared to
    acid soils. 4.3 CSA and other agronomic practices Crop residues provide substantial
    amounts of organic matter and may influence the effect of CSA practices on SOC.
    Residue retention changes the formation of soil macroaggregates (Benbi & Senapati,
    2010), promoting SOC preservation and accumulation (Six, Conant, Paul, & Paustian,
    2002). Residue cover protects the soil surface from direct impact by raindrops
    (Blanco-Canqui, Ferguson, Shapiro, Drijber, & Walters, 2014). In addition, crop
    residues provide organic substrates to soil microorganisms that can produce binding
    agents and promote soil aggregation (Guggenberger, Frey, Six, Paustian, & Elliott,
    1999). Conversely, residue removal reduces carbon input to the soil system and
    ultimately decreases SOC storage (Koga & Tsuji, 2009; Manna et al., 2005). This
    suggests that the amount of carbon inputs predominantly controls changes in SOC
    stocks (Virto, Barré, Burlot, & Chenu, 2012). For the conditions of cover crops
    and NT, enhancing SOC was significantly greater with residue return than with
    residue removal. Our study suggests that changes in SOC did not differ with residue
    management in RT (Table 1), although a slightly greater increase in SOC occurred
    with residue retention than with residue removal (Figure 8). This unexpected result
    is likely due to the limited number of observations with residue removal. Another
    possible reason is that the interaction between residue management and soil type
    may lead to various responses in SOC stocks. For example, residue removal increased
    SOC by 3.6% while residue retention had no effect on SOC in clay and clay loam
    soils. The decomposition of crop residues involves complex processes, which are
    controlled by multiple biogeochemical and biophysical conditions. Nitrogen fertilization
    noticeably increases SOC stock but with diminishing returns. For example, Blanco-Canqui
    et al. (2014) indicate that nitrogen fertilizer increases SOC when the nitrogen
    fertilization rate is below 80 kg N ha−1, above which it reduces aggregation and
    then decreases SOC stocks. Nitrogen fertilization can stimulate biological activity
    by altering carbon/nitrogen ratios, thereby promoting soil respiration and decreasing
    SOC content (Mulvaney, Khan, & Ellsworth, 2009); however, excessive nitrogen addition
    may reduce soil fungi populations, inhibit soil enzyme activity, and decrease
    CO2 emissions (Wilson & Al Kazi, 2008). These findings suggest that nitrogen fertilization
    enhances the positive effect of CSA management practices on SOC, likely through
    increased plant biomass production (Gregorich, Liang, Ellert, & Drury, 1996).
    However, nitrogen addition complicates the effects of biochar on SOC (Figure 9).
    Nitrogen fertilizer may affect biochar stability and the response of native SOC
    decomposition to biochar addition (Jiang, Haddix, & Cotrufo, 2016). Positive (Bebber,
    Watkinson, Boddy, & Darrah, 2011; Jiang, Cao, & Zhang, 2014) and negative (Pregitzer,
    Burton, Zak, & Talhelm, 2008) effects of nitrogen on SOC mineralization rates
    have been reported. These contrasting effects could be an alleviation of microbial
    nitrogen limitations (Jiang et al., 2016) and changes in the microbial decomposer
    community toward more efficient carbon-users (Janssens et al., 2010). A possible
    explanation of the various responses of nitrogen rate in biochar-modified soils
    is that either inadequate or excessive nitrogen addition may inhibit microbial
    activity to some extent, whereas medium-level nitrogen fertilization rates benefit
    microbes the most, which needs to be confirmed in future research. Aridity can
    limit plant growth and crop residue return and ultimately compromise SOC accumulation
    (Moreno, Murillo, Pelegrín, & Girón, 2006). Jien and Wang (2013) suggest that
    CSA management practices can potentially enhance soil water retention by improving
    soil porosity and erosion control. Irrigation ensures sufficient water for plant
    growth, resulting in more biomass production than in rainfed conditions (Capowiez
    et al., 2009; Chan, 2004; Shipitalo, Edwards, Dick, & Owens, 1990; Swanepoel,
    Laan, Weepener, Preez, & Annandale, 2016). The crop root density is much higher
    in irrigated conditions compared to rainfed conditions (Jobbágy & Jackson, 2000),
    leading to higher organic matter input. Thus, CSA management practices in combination
    with irrigation could further increase SOC content. Rotational cropping potentially
    provides high carbon input to soils. Compared to continuous cropping systems,
    crops in rotational cropping systems have a greater belowground allocation of
    biomass (Van Eerd, Congreves, Hayes, Verhallen, & Hooker, 2014), resulting in
    more inputs of crop residue to the soil system. Enhancing rotation complexity
    can benefit carbon sequestration (West & Post, 2002). The present analysis suggests
    that all CSA practices can prominently increase SOC sequestration regardless of
    the crop rotation system. Biochar addition increased SOC more in rotational cropping
    systems than in continuous cropping systems, while cover crops increased SOC more
    in continuous systems (Figure 10). This is likely because cover crops increased
    the diversity of the original continuous systems, resulting in larger percentage
    changes in SOC content compared to rotational systems. Cover crop species introduce
    large uncertainties because the quantity and quality of cover crop residues may
    vary greatly with species. Residues with a high carbon/nitrogen ratio probably
    increase the amount of SOC (Duong, Baumann, & Marschner, 2009). The growth period
    of legume cover crops may be longer in continuous than in rotational cropping
    systems, thus providing more organic matter and nitrogen input to the soil. Ultimately,
    these processes would increase SOC stocks. The effect size of combined cover crops
    and conservation tillage was generally less than 11% (the sum of the effect size
    of cover crops and conservation tillage). However, in sandy clay loam and loamy
    sand soils, the sum of the effect size was 21% and 31%, respectively. Coarse-textured
    soils are not carbon-saturated and have great potential for carbon uptake. Cultivated
    land tends to suffer from SOC degradation, and SOC accumulation could quickly
    increase upon initiating farming practices due to high carbon inputs to the soil
    system (Vieira, Bayer, Zanatta, Mielniczuk, & Six, 2009). For example, in sandy
    loam soils, Higashi et al. (2014) showed that SOC increased by 22% with a combination
    of cover crops and NT. These results may be attributed to the stability of soil
    water-stable aggregates when cover crops are grown in sandy clay loam soils (McVay,
    Radcliffe, & Hargrove, 1989), given that aggregate stability has been linked to
    protection of SOC from mineralization (Unger, 1997). The combination of cover
    crops and conservation tillage significantly decreased SOC in clay soils. The
    reason for this unexpected result may be due to the limited number of study sites
    where this combination of treatments was evaluated (a few data pairs in our meta-analysis),
    and burning of cover crop biomass (Tian et al., 2005). 4.4 Uncertainty analysis
    and prospects Our meta-analysis, based on 3,049-paired comparisons from 417 peer-reviewed
    articles, quantitatively analyzed SOC changes as influenced by major CSA management
    practices and associated environmental factors and other agronomic practices.
    The publication bias analysis suggested that most results in this study are robust
    (Table S3). The accuracy and robustness of metadata analysis depend highly on
    both the data quality and quantity. A detailed statement of the experimental conditions
    will provide more information for in-depth analysis. Future CSA research also
    requires standardized field management, for example, the definitions and names
    of different conservation tillage methods should be uniform across studies to
    facilitate classification research. To the best of our knowledge, this study made
    the first attempt to examine synergistic effects when two or more CSA management
    practices are used together. Although our results present the positive effects
    of CSA management on soil carbon storage, especially when multiple management
    practices are adopted collectively, each practice may have constraints regarding
    enhancing soil carbon sequestration. The SOC benefit of CSA management practices
    strongly depends on environmental factors and other agronomic practices. Therefore,
    the choice of proper practices is potentially highly region specific. Our results
    imply that CSA may have great potential for climate change mitigation as the combination
    of conservation tillage, cover crops, and biochar can theoretically enhance SOC
    by 50%. However, field experiments are still needed to support this claim. In
    addition, some CSA management practices may promote nitrous oxide or methane emissions
    (e.g., Huang et al., 2018; Kessel et al., 2013; Six, Ogle, Conant, Mosier, & Paustian,
    2004; Spokas & Reicosky, 2009), which, to some extent, would offset their benefit
    on climate change mitigation. Therefore, evaluating the CSA effects should also
    include non-CO2 greenhouse gases such as nitrous oxide and methane. We call for
    field experiments that can fully examine key indicators (such as soil carbon and
    greenhouse gases) in response to single and combined CSA management practices.
    Additionally, incorporating cover crops into current cropping systems could potentially
    alter conventional rotations. For example, cover crops in herbaceous crop rotations
    can substitute bare fallows or commercial crops. We only considered studies that
    treated cover crops as treatments and fallow (or weeds) as controls in this study.
    In comparison to bare fallows, cover crops can enhance soil health and quality
    (Jarecki & Lal, 2003). The benefits of cover crops include uptakes and stores
    of soil nutrients between seasons when they are susceptible to leaching (Doran
    & Smith, 1987). However, the substitution of commercial crops could reduce the
    productivity of the system, which has climatic implications related to the opportunity
    cost of the extra land required (e.g., Balmford et al., 2018; Searchinger, Wirsenius,
    Beringer, & Dumas, 2018). Thus, future studies should further address these potential
    side effects caused by land use change. Materials producing biochar may have other
    uses or fates, and the biochar-making processes may produce CO2 (e.g., Llorach-Massana
    et al., 2017), although biochar addition is an effective way to sequester SOC.
    These uncertainties, to some extent, can offset the benefits of biochar for climate
    change mitigation through SOC sequestration (Powlson, Riche, Coleman, Glendining,
    & Whitmore, 2008). The carbon footprint of biochar production depends on production
    technology and the types of feedstocks (Meyer et al., 2017). Mukherjee and Lal
    (2014) found that “carbon dioxide emissions from biochar-amended soils have been
    enhanced up to 61% compared with unamended soils.” However, with a low carbon
    footprint, each ton of biochar could sequester 21–155 kg of equivalent CO2 (Llorach-Massana
    et al., 2017). Matovic (2011) also suggested that 4.8 Gt C/year would be sequestered
    if 10% of the world''s net primary production were converted into biochar, “at
    50% yield and 30% energy from volatiles.” To fully understand the net impacts
    of biochar on climate mitigation, future studies should stress the carbon footprint
    in the lifecycle of biochar. It is essential to realistically examine the effects
    of CSA management practices on SOC and greenhouse gases at multiple scales from
    plot and field levels to regional and global scales. Therefore, future CSA research
    is expected to include varied climate and geographic conditions, address more
    biogeochemical and hydrological processes, and apply diverse methods such as the
    data-model fusion approach. For example, modeling studies have attempted to investigate
    regional cropland SOC dynamics as influenced by multiple global environmental
    changes while considering more traditional and less CSA practices (e.g., Molina,
    Moreno Pérez, & Pérez, 2017; Nash et al., 2018; Ren, Tian, Tao, Huang, & Pan,
    2012, 2018). In the future, ecosystem models need to be improved to incorporate
    multiple common CSA management practices. Additional model evaluations are needed
    to quantify the potential of cropland carbon sequestration by adopting multiple
    CSA practices at broad scales as new data become available from suggested field
    experiments and observations. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the

    Get rights and content Abstract Monthly data records of 40 Iranian stations distributed
    over the country, for the period 1971–2005, were utilized for estimation of reference
    evapotranspiration (ETo) using Penman–Monteith (PM-ETo), Hargreaves–Samani (HS)
    and FAO-PM temperature (PMT) methods. To estimate ETo with HS and PMT methods,
    appropriate kRs, an empirical radiation adjustment coefficient, were considered
    for each station, whereas Tmin was adjusted for estimation of Tdew and used only
    for PMT computation. It was found that the appropriate kRs for both HS and PMT
    methods are identical for a given station and it is generally smaller in sub-humid
    and humid than in semi-arid to hyper-arid climates. The performance of the PMT
    was further improved in both arid and humid climates when Tmin was adjusted. The
    result suggested that the HS and PMT methods appropriately predict ETo for all
    climatic regions of Iran if the appropriate kRs was utilized. However, the considered
    methods showed weak performances for some stations in arid and hyper-arid climates
    of eastern and southern Iran owing to the effect of extreme and variable wind
    speed inherent in the PM-ETo. Thus, the role played by wind speed in ETo estimation
    was examined; the result indicated that the existence of extreme winds, and also
    the time variability of wind speed, is responsible for the observed discrepancies
    between PMT and PM-ETo estimates. The spatial patterns of ETo computed with HS
    and PMT methods found to be identical and resemble to that of PM-ETo, all showing
    a gradual increasing from north to south, with the lowest ETo values observed
    over northern humid and sub-humid climates of Iran and larger ETo for arid and
    hyper-arid climates in the southern and eastern country. Results indicated that
    the HS and PMT methods are appropriate alternatives for estimation of ETo for
    all climatic regions of Iran. Highlights ► Appropriate kRs was used for estimation
    of ETo with HS and PMT methods. ► Using adjusted Tmin in PMT model improved its
    estimates in arid and humid climates. ► Appropriate kRs for both HS and PMT found
    to be identical for a given station. ► Appropriate kRs found to be smaller in
    humid than in arid climates. ► The HS and PMT methods appropriately predict ETo
    for all climatic regions of Iran. Previous article in issue Next article in issue

    1. Introduction Adequate estimation of reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is of
    paramount importance in agricultural and hydrological studies, water resources
    management and watershed management. In particular, it is required for estimation
    of crop water requirements, supporting irrigation scheduling, drought management
    and climate change studies. The methodologies of ETo estimation redefined by Food
    and Agricultural Organization of United Nations (FAO) were successfully applied
    at different time scales in various climatic regions of the world (Allen et al.,
    1998, Allen et al., 2006, Smith, 2000). The Penman–Monteith ETo (PM-ETo) equation
    refers to grass as reference crop and requires solar radiation data or sunshine
    duration for estimating net radiation (Rn), maximum and minimum temperature (Tmax
    and Tmin, respectively), psycrometric or relative humidity data for estimating
    the vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and wind speed (U) When formulating the PM-ETo
    equation advection effects were not considered (Allen et al., 1998, Pereira et
    al., 1999). Advection impacts on crop evapotranspiration must be considered through
    the crop coefficients and not ETo (Allen et al., 1998). However, when searching
    for ETo data estimation under advective conditions, Berengena and Gavilán (2005)
    found that daily ETo estimates using the PM-ETo equation matched well the lysimeter
    observations of grass ET. Good results are reported for daily computations using
    hourly data in locations having advective influences (Allen et al., 2006). To
    appropriately compute the parameters of PM-ETo the procedures proposed by Allen
    et al. (1998) should be followed. Alternative procedures have been tested by Nandagiri
    and Kovoor (2005), who have shown the need for strict adherence to the recommended
    parameter computation procedures, especially for estimating vapour pressure deficit
    and net radiation parameters. Gavilán et al. (2007) reported that the methods
    proposed by Allen et al. (1998) for estimating Rn and G are appropriate for estimation
    of ETo for both daily and hourly time scales. Gong et al. (2006) performed a sensitivity
    analysis of PM-ETo parameters and pointed to the very high influence of solar
    radiation and relative humidity in accurate estimation of PM-ETo. However, lack
    of full weather datasets in many parts of the world, particularly in remote areas,
    limits the application of PM-ETo. Thus, alternative accurate approaches requiring
    limited data are needed, which has led to a huge number of related studies focusing
    various climates. According to Allen et al. (1998), and basing upon former studies
    to compare the performance of ET temperature methods, mainly the study by Jensen
    et al. (1990), when full weather data are lacking ETo can be estimated either
    using the empirical Hargreaves–Samani (HS) equation (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985),
    or empirically estimating Rn, VPD and U for using in the PM-ETo equation, including
    through using data from neighbour weather stations (Allen, 1997). Various ET temperature
    methods were then excluded – and consequently are not considered in this study
    –, particularly the ET climatic equation of Thornthwaite (1948), that largely
    underestimates grass ETo comparatively to PM-ETo (Allen et al., 1994). In both
    aforementioned methods the minimum set of data required consists of Tmax and Tmin.
    The latter approach for using the PM-ETo with only Tmax and Tmin is called herein
    as PM temperature (PMT) method and is also referred in literature as reduced set
    PM method (e.g., Martinez and Thepadia, 2010). Both the HS and PMT methods have
    received a continuous attention from research contrarily to the use of neighbour
    weather data; however, a recent methodology based on principal component analysis
    to estimate ETo when no local climatic inputs are available (Martí and Zarzo,
    2012) may provide new developments in this domain. The ETo estimated by the HS
    equation have been successfully compared with the ETo computed with the PM-ETo
    equation using full datasets, or with grass lysimeter data, indicating that the
    HS method performs well in most climatic regions, with the exception of humid
    area where it tends to overestimate ETo (Nandagiri and Kovoor, 2006, Trajkovic
    and Kolakovic, 2009, Martinez and Thepadia, 2010, Tabari, 2010). Since the HS
    method was empirically developed based on data from arid to sub-humid environments,
    it may not fit well to conditions far different from those considered for its
    calibration as it is the case for humid climates. Temesgen et al. (2005) also
    stated that the HS method underestimates ETo for dry and windy locations due to
    not considering a wind factor and concluded that it is more accurate when applied
    for 5 or 7-day averages than for daily time scales. However, despite a quite good
    performance of the HS equation in most applications, particularly when it is used
    for irrigation scheduling purposes, many authors attempted to recalibrate the
    HS coefficients or parameters in order to improve its performance (e.g., Droogers
    and Allen, 2002, Trajkovic, 2007, Fooladmand et al., 2008), or to modify the equation
    itself (Diodato and Bellocchi, 2007). This resulted in a large number of versions
    of the HS equation, that relates with the purpose of many researchers to find
    locally calibrated versions of the HS equation. Based on a careful analysis of
    the history and applications of the HS equation, Hargreaves and Allen (2003) concluded
    that recalibrating the exponents and coefficients of the HS equation only increased
    the complexity of the equation. The HS method is usually preferred with respective
    to other more complicated equations since it is reasonably adequate and requires
    only maximum and minimum air temperatures (Hargreaves and Allen, 2003). This is
    very important in regions where solar radiation, air humidity, and wind speed
    data are lacking or are of low or questionable quality, while the maximum and
    minimum air temperatures are available in most of agro-climatic and weather stations
    since air temperature can be measured with less errors and by less trained individuals
    than the other required climate variables used in combination equations. The accuracy
    of the PMT equation has been assessed by several authors through comparing its
    results with those of the PM-ETo or other ET equations, HS included. Popova et
    al. (2006) found more accurate results for PMT than for HS, which tended to overestimate
    ETo in the Trace plain area of southern Bulgaria. For Pyrenees, López-Moreno et
    al. (2009) obtained better results with PMT when compared with HS method. Similarly,
    Jabloun and Sahli (2008) found better estimates for PMT than for HS in Northern
    and Central Tunisia. An application of PMT for Northern China, characterized with
    monsoon climate, also have shown that the PMT estimates better fitted to the PM-ETo
    than HS (Liu and Pereira, 2001, Pereira et al., 2003). Application of PMT to different
    climates of South Africa showed to be superior to HS and that better results were
    obtained when applied to 5-day rather than daily time scales (Annandale et al.,
    2002). The estimated ETo computed by PMT and HS method for Serbia suggested that
    PMT fitted better PM-ETo than HS (Trajkovic, 2005). Differently, it was found
    that the HS produced smaller overestimation errors than PMT in a humid climate
    (Martinez and Thepadia, 2010). Kra (2010) applied a modified PMT method in West
    Africa, while Cai et al. (2007) used a modified PMT approach for estimating ETo
    with daily forecast messages; lately, the PMT was adapted for using daily forecasted
    weather data for irrigation scheduling purposes (Cai et al., 2009). Paredes and
    Rodrigues (2010) found small errors with PMT relative to HS, thus adopting it
    to estimate ETo in Portugal for irrigation scheduling purposes; they found that
    estimation errors were larger in humid locations comparative to dryer ones. Gocic
    and Trajkovic (2010) proposed a software to estimate ETo for minimizing computation
    errors using the PMT or an adjusted HS equation when weather data are missing.
    However, current literature show that there are no attempts to calibrate the radiation
    adjustment coefficient kRs used to estimate solar radiation from the temperature
    difference in PMT and, non-explicitly, in HS (Hargreaves and Allen, 2003, Samani,
    2000, Samani, 2004). This calibration is therefore a line to be explored in this
    study. Moreover, literature looks to be controversial when comparing HS and PMT
    results as was identified by Todorovic et al. (2013). Due to the complex orography
    and wide latitudinal extent, Iran contains diverse climates ranging from very
    humid in the Caspian Sea region to arid and hyper arid in the central, southern
    and eastern Iran. In this vast area, the stations recording the climate variables
    needed for estimation of PM-ETo are very sparse and in many cases have incomplete
    records, particularly in the central-southern country where the Iranian deserts
    are situated. Therefore, to have a reliable estimation of ETo at a fine spatial
    resolution over the country, it is important to use accurate methods requiring
    limited weather data that can be available in a dense network through the country
    as it is the case for temperature. To our best knowledge, Dinpashoh (2006) is
    the only author that has estimated ETo for the whole country using PM-ETo and
    HS methods, but did not tested the possible advantages in using calibrated values
    for the radiation adjustment coefficient or temperature adjustment for dew point
    temperature estimation for the PMT method as proposed by Allen (1996). The adequateness
    of using PM-ETo in Iran is also demonstrated by Dinpashoh et al. (2011) through
    a trend analysis of PM-ETo for 16 Iranian weather stations. Several authors have
    also assessed the application of other methods requiring minimum data for estimation
    of ETo in some parts of Iran rather than for the whole country (Fooladmand and
    Haghighat, 2007, Ahmadi and Fooladmand, 2008, Rahimikhoob, 2010, Tabari et al.,
    2011a, Tabari and Aghajanloo, 2012). However, a calibration of the radiation adjustment
    coefficient was not attempted in any of the later referred studies and the PMT
    and HS methods were not compared. Therefore, the objective of the present study
    is to evaluate the potential and accuracy of the PMT and HS methods for estimation
    of ETo in different climatic regions of Iran and to refine the methodologies for
    better adapting both the PMT and HS methods to the existing environmental conditions.
    Thus, it is aimed to compare the PMT and HS methods, to find the best values for
    the radiation adjustment coefficient to be used with both methods, to assess the
    advantage in correcting the minimum temperature when estimating VPD, and to assess
    the impacts of high wind speed in arid zones. These objectives are set to support
    a wide range of irrigation management and water resources applications, particularly
    relative to droughts, for use in regions where weather data are missing, are incomplete
    or are of questionable quality. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Data The data used
    for this study are monthly averages of maximum and minimum temperature (°C), relative
    humidity (%), sunshine duration (h) and wind speed (m s−1) relative to 40 Iranian
    synoptic stations distributed over the country as depicted in Fig. 1a; the associated
    coordinates are shown in Table 1. The majority of the selected stations have the
    longest and nearly complete data records for the period 1971–2005, particularly
    considering sunshine, relative humidity and wind speed data. The selected stations
    are first order synoptic stations that passed careful quality control by the Iranian
    meteorological organization and are quite regularly distributed through the country
    (Fig. 1a). However, the time series of the considered variables were further investigated
    for possible non-homogeneities by comparing the time series of a given station
    with those of neighbouring stations. The result proved that all the variables
    were homogeneous, with the exception of wind speed records at Tabass, Bam, Semnan,
    Kashan, Khoramabad, Dezful and Chabahar stations, which exhibited extreme step
    changes and non-homogeneity. Therefore, the wind datasets at these 7 stations
    were corrected through establishing linear regression between the considered station
    data and those of neighbouring stations as proposed by Allen et al. (1998). Download

    for the present study encompass several representative stations for each climatic
    sub-region of Iran, defined herein on the basis of the global aridity index (UNEP,
    1997) adopted by the United-Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. The
    UNEP aridity index, which is also adopted by FAO and used worldwide consists of
    the ratio of mean annual precipitation (P) to mean annual potential evapotranspiration
    computed with the Thornthwaite method (Thornthwaite, 1948). The computed aridity
    index for the considered stations are also presented in Table 1 to climatically
    characterize the used stations, while the spatial distribution of the index over
    the country is depicted in Fig. 1b. The map of aridity index points to the humid
    and sub-humid climates over coastal areas of the Caspian Sea in northern Iran.
    Dry-sub-humid climate features occur in the highest parts of the Alborz mountain
    chain in the north, thus acting as a transitional band, isolating humid and sub-humid
    climates of the coastal areas of the Caspian Sea from the semi-arid areas of interior
    Iran (Fig. 1b). The dry-sub-humid climate also characterizes a remarkable part
    of western Iran due to its relatively high annual precipitation accompanied with
    cold winters and moderate summers. Semi-arid climates refer to the mountainous
    areas of western, northern and north-eastern Iran, whereas arid and hyper-arid
    climates dominate central, southern and eastern Iran (Fig. 1b). The climate sub-regions
    of Iran produced herein based on the spatial variability of the aridity index,
    though methodologically and conceptually different, are in relatively good agreement
    with the results of the precipitation based regionalization studies for Iran in
    illustrating the main structure of the Iranian climate (e.g., Dinpashoh et al.,
    2004, Raziei et al., 2008). 2.2. Methods to estimate ETo The PM-ETo equation is
    aimed to define the grass reference evapotranspiration, i.e., the rate of evapotranspiration
    from a hypothetical crop with an assumed fixed height (12 cm), surface resistance
    (70 s m−1) and albedo (0.23), approximately resembling the evapotranspiration
    from an extensive surface of a disease-free green grass cover of uniform height,
    actively growing, completely shading the ground, and with adequate water and nutrient
    supply (Allen et al., 1998). The PM-ETo equation for calculation of daily ETo
    takes the form: (1) where ETo is the grass reference evapotranspiration (mm day−1),
    Rn is the net radiation at the crop surface (MJ m−2 day−1), G is soil heat flux
    density (MJ m−2 day−1), T is mean daily air temperature at 2 m height (°C), u2
    is wind speed at 2 m height (m s−1), es is saturation vapor pressure (kPa), ea
    is actual vapor pressure (kPa), es − ea is vapor pressure deficit (kPa), Δ is
    slope of the vapor pressure curve (kPa °C−1), and γ is psychometric constant (kPa
    °C−1). This equation uses standard meteorological records of solar radiation or
    sunshine duration, minimum and maximum air temperature, air humidity and wind
    speed. To ensure the integrity of computations, the weather measurements should
    be made at 2 m (or converted to that height) above an extensive surface of green
    grass, shading the ground and not short of water. The parameters of Eq. (1) can
    be estimated from the observed climatic variables following the standard methods
    proposed by Allen et al. (1998), whereas the missing climatic data can be estimated
    empirically as follows. Rn is computed as the algebraic sum of the net short and
    long wave radiation (Rns and Rnl, respectively). Rns, results from the balance
    between incoming and reflected solar radiation (Rs) adopting an albedo of 0.23,
    and Rnl results from the balance between the down-coming and the outgoing long
    wave radiation emitted by the vegetation and the soil. Computations were performed
    as proposed by Allen et al. (1998). When Rs is not measured, it can be estimated
    from the observed duration of sunshine hours with the Angström (1924) equation:
    (2) where Rs is solar or shortwave radiation (MJ m−2 day−1), n is actual sunshine
    duration (h), N is maximum possible sunshine duration (h), n/N is relative sunshine
    duration, Ra is extraterrestrial radiation (MJ m−2 day−1), as is the coefficient
    expressing the fraction of extraterrestrial radiation reaching the earth on overcast
    days (n = 0), and as + bs is the fraction of extraterrestrial radiation reaching
    the earth on clear sky days (n = N). Ra and N are computed for any given day as
    a function of the latitude of the site (Allen et al., 1998). When using monthly
    time steps Ra and N are computed for the central day of the month. The values
    as = 0.25 and bs = 0.50 are recommended when these fractions are not locally calibrated
    using a set of good quality data on both n/N and Rs. When radiation and sunshine
    duration measurements are not available, the PMT method uses the Hargreaves radiation
    equation (Hargreaves and Samani, 1982) for the estimation of solar radiation (Rs)
    in alternative to Eq. (2): (3) where kRs is the empirical radiation adjustment
    coefficient (°C−0.5). For ‘interior’ locations, where land mass dominates and
    air masses are not strongly influenced by a large water body, Allen (1997) and
    Allen et al. (1998) proposed kRs ≅ 0.16 for ‘interior’ areas and kRs ≅ 0.19 for
    ‘coastal’ locations. These values are the same as those proposed previously by
    Hargreaves (1994). Inherent to its empirical nature, there is some uncertainty
    relatively to this coefficient (Samani, 2004). Popova et al. (2006) reported that
    for temperate climate kRs values change little. Differently, for a wide range
    of climates as in the Mediterranean countries a large variation was observed (Todorovic
    et al., 2013). Vapour pressure deficit (VPD) is computed as the difference between
    the saturation vapour pressure (es) and the actual vapour pressure (ea). es is
    computed as the average of the saturation vapour pressure at Tmax and Tmin. Various
    approximations may be used to estimate ea depending upon available data. When
    only mean daily relative humidity (RHmean) data are available, as for the complete
    datasets used in this study, ea is computed as (Allen et al., 1998): (4) In the
    absence of humidity data, ea may be obtained by assuming that the dew point temperature,
    Tdew, is close to the daily minimum temperature, Tmin. Then, if the weather station
    can be considered a reference site where Tdew = Tmin, ea is calculated by (5)
    The HS method (Hargreaves and Samani, 1985) requires only observed Tmin and Tmax
    for the estimation of ETo (mm day−1), which is given as: (6) where Ra is the extraterrestrial
    radiation as defined earlier, and λ is the latent heat of vaporization (MJ kg−1)
    for the mean air temperature T (°C), that is commonly assumed equal to 2.45 MJ
    kg−1. 0.0135 is a factor for conversion from American to the International system
    of units and kRs is the radiation adjustment coefficient defined in Eq. (3). In
    the common version of HS equation the value kRs ≅ 0.17 is used (Samani, 2004).
    2.3. Temperature adjustment for estimating PMT-ETo Data quality assessment and
    data correction for non-reference weather sites, i.e., where aridity is dominant,
    were proposed by Allen et al. (1998) as a pre-condition for accuracy of PM-ETo
    calculations. In fact, the PM-ETo definition implies the consideration of an actively
    growing grass crop completely shading the ground and not short of water. However,
    many, if not the majority of the weather data around the globe are reported from
    non-reference sites, and their use to estimate ETo may cause less accuracy of
    estimates. If data quality is essential for any kind of evapotranspiration studies
    (Allen et al., 2011), requirements for aridity corrections relate specifically
    with the PM-ETo equation and crop reference definition. That correction was analyzed
    by Allen (1996), Jensen et al. (1997) and Temesgen et al. (1999), and refers to
    correct temperature by 2 or 3 degrees to approach Tmin of Tdew when the site temperature
    is higher than that expected for a reference site while air humidity is lower.
    Temesgen et al. (1999) have shown small effects of this correction on ETo estimated
    with the HS equation because this equation does not explicitly use dew point temperature
    and wind speed, both of which are affected by site aridity. These authors also
    considered that where the aridity of the site increases it mixes up the top and
    bottom layers of the atmosphere. The mixing of different layers in turn reduces
    the temperature range (TR = Tmax − Tmin) by decreasing Tmax during daytime and
    by increasing Tmin during night-time, thereby keeping the increase in estimated
    ETo lower than that for PM-ETo as aridity increases. The humidity term is only
    implicitly contained in the TR term of the Hargreaves equation. The analysis by
    Hargreaves and Allen (2003) agrees with the hypothesis of Temesgen et al. (1999),
    thus not considering the need for site aridity correction when the HS equation
    is used. The PMT method uses as input only measured minimum and maximum air temperature
    for the estimation of ETo by the PM-ETo equation (Eq. (1)), whereas wind speed
    is fixed to 2 m s−1 (the average value of 2000 weather stations over the globe)
    and solar radiation and actual vapour pressure are estimated by Eqs. (3), (5),
    respectively (Allen et al., 1998, Popova et al., 2006). As discussed before, when
    applying the PMT method there is a need for adjustment of temperature used for
    the estimation of actual vapour pressure. Tmin might be greater than Tdew in a
    non-reference weather station, as for a station located inside a town or having
    dry or bare ground. Then, the estimated value for Tdew from Tmin may require correction
    (Allen, 1996, Allen et al., 1998, Temesgen et al., 1999), which is expected to
    be higher in more arid climates. Considering the climate zones defined in Table
    2 and illustrated in Fig. 1b, the corrections of Tdew are proposed for all months
    where P/ETo < 0.65 (Todorovic et al., 2013). Table 2. Correction of Tdew estimates
    from Tmin for estimation of actual vapor pressure. Climate zones Annual P/ETo
    Corrected Tdew (°C) Hyper-arid <0.08 Tdew = Tmin − 4 Arid 0.08–0.20 Tdew = Tmin
    − 2 Semi-arid 0.20–0.50 Tdew = Tmin − 1 Dry sub-humid 0.50–0.65 Tdew = Tmin −
    1 Moist sub-humid 0.65–1.0 No correction for aridity Humid >1.0 No correction
    for aridity Differently, in humid climate where commonly air humidity is high
    and temperatures are relatively low, very likely Tdew is higher or much higher
    than Tmin. Therefore, for the humid stations situated in the Caspian Sea region,
    considering the relations for Tdew in moist air proposed by Lawrence (2005), and
    following the good results previously obtained for the Mediterranean area (Todorovic
    et al., 2013), Tdew was estimated as follows: (7) with ad = 2 °C for the months
    when 0.8 < P/ETo < 1.0 and ad = 1 °C if P/ETo > 1.0. 2.4. Evaluation procedure
    A trial and error procedure was applied to all datasets to find the best values
    for kRs since the relations proposed by Samani, 2000, Samani, 2004 did not show
    to be appropriate. PMT computations were performed with temperature correction
    for aridity effects (Table 2) or for humidity impacts on Tdew as described in
    Section 2.3. The results of ETo estimated by PMT and HS methods using limited
    weather data were compared with those of reference PM-ETo computed using full
    datasets. To assess the performance of HS and PMT methods with respect to PM-ETo,
    relative to all pairs of observed and predicted values for each station, in addition
    to a linear regression forced to the origin, several statistical indicators were
    also used. These indicators are explained below and their equations are given
    in literature, e.g., the comparative study of ETo models by Todorovic et al. (2013).
    If the coefficient of regression b is close to 1 then the predicted values are
    statistically close to the observed ones; when the coefficient of determination
    R2 is close to 1.0 then most of the variation of the observed values can be explained
    by the model. The root mean square error, RMSE characterizes the variance of the
    errors; the smaller RMSE the better is the model''s performance. The modelling
    efficiency, EF, was used to determine the relative magnitude of the residual variance
    comparatively to the measured data variance; it is defined from the ratio of the
    mean square error to the variance in the observed data (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970,
    Moriasi et al., 2007). EF indicates that when the residual variance equals the
    observed data variance it results EF = 1.0; contrarily, when EF equals zero or
    is negative this indicates that the observed mean is as good or better predictor
    than the model. The Willmott (1981) index of agreement, dIA, is also a non-dimensional
    measure that represents the ratio between the mean square error and the “potential
    error”, defined as the sum of the squared absolute values of the distances from
    the predicted values to the mean observed value and distances from the observed
    values to the mean observed value (Moriasi et al., 2007): dIA varies between 0
    and 1; a value of 1 indicates a perfect agreement between the measured and predicted
    values while 0 indicates no agreement at all (Moriasi et al., 2007). The above
    statistics measure the degree of accuracy of ETo estimation using PMT and HS methods
    with respect to the PM-ETo, however not giving information whether the accuracy
    between the two competing models is significantly different. To address this issue,
    a test statistic proposed by Diebold and Mariano (1995), which is commonly used
    in financial literature, is adopted. Although this test is usually used for out-of-sample
    forecasting accuracy analysis (Mohammadi and Su, 2010), here it is used to test
    the accuracy of within-sample prediction following Modarres and Ouarda (2012),
    who recently applied it in hydrological sciences. In the present study, the test
    can indicate if there is a significant difference between PMT and HS''s performances
    in estimating ETo. Formally, let e1,t and e2,t, t = 1, …, m, denote model errors
    from PMT an HS models and g(e1,t) and g(e2,t) are their associated loss functions,
    i.e., the squared-error loss, and dt = g(e1,t) − g(e2,t) is the loss differential,
    then the B statistics (Diebold and Mariano, 1995) is defined as: (8) where is
    the sample mean, s is the variance of loss differential and m is the number of
    observations. Given covariance stationarity and short memory with regard to dt,
    the test implies an asymptotic distribution with zero mean and unit variance.
    Under a null hypothesis of zero mean, the two models have equal accuracy if the
    loss differential has zero expectation for all t observations. The null hypothesis
    is rejected in favour of the alternative hypothesis when the statistic B, in absolute
    value, exceeds the critical value of a standard unit Gaussian distribution (Diebold
    and Mariano, 1995). 3. Results 3.1. Performance of HS method The performance of
    the HS method is evaluated against the computed PM-ETo in all considered stations
    (Fig. 2 and Table 3). Fig. 2 illustrates the relationship between PM-ETo and HS
    estimates when appropriate kRs were used for all the stations. In Table 3, in
    addition to the goodness of fit indicators, the appropriate kRs utilized for computing
    HS for each of the considered stations are also given. Download : Download full-size

    estimated HS strongly correlates with PM-ETo at most of the stations, implying
    that the HS method appropriately predicts the PM-ETo in all climatic regions of
    Iran when the appropriate kRs is selected. A visual inspection in Fig. 2 and Table
    3 suggests that the HS method performs well for all climatic zones of Iran shown
    in Fig. 1b, particularly for the stations characterized with semi arid to humid
    climates in western and northern Iran. The HS estimates for the stations located
    in the central-southern and eastern arid to hyper-arid climates of Iran show also
    a satisfactory agreement with PM-ETo, though a very poor agreement was found for
    Zabol in eastern Iran. A slighter deviation of the HS estimation from the PM-ETo
    for higher ET values was also observed for some other stations characterized with
    semi-arid to hyper-arid climates though are reasonably in good agreement. The
    observed deviation in such stations, particularly for extreme values, is supposed
    to be related to the effect of wind speed on PM-ETo computation that is addressed
    in Section 3.4. Good results for humid climates (Fig. 2 and Table 3) are contradicting
    findings by many authors (e.g., Trajkovic and Kolakovic, 2009, Martinez and Thepadia,
    2010, Tabari, 2010) and result from the calibration of kRs, which was apparently
    not achieved by the referred authors. Fig. 3a illustrates the spatial pattern
    of kRs appropriate for estimation of ETo using the HS method. The appropriate
    kRs for the stations located in the dry-sub-humid to humid climates of western
    and northern Iran found to be between 0.13 and 0.18, while it ranges from 0.14
    to 0.20 for the stations situated in the semi-arid to hyper-arid climates of central,
    southern and eastern Iran. The figure depicts a gradual increasing in kRs moving
    from north to south and from west to east, being relatively in concordance of
    the climatic zones of Iran depicted in Fig. 1. However, the spatial configuration
    of the kRs is interrupted by some eyeballs, particularly in northern half of the
    country, wherever the kRs values are far different from the surrounding values.
    In other words, there are a few cases where the appropriate kRs for a single station
    differs from the general pattern of the region. For example the best fitted kRs
    for Tabriz, in north-western Iran, is 0.21, which is much higher than the norm
    of the region, which could be attributed to the local high summer wind speed.
    Contrasting, kRs is 0.15 for Kashan, in central Iran, which is lower than the
    general kRs pattern for arid and hyper-arid climates. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. Spatial patterns of the selected kRs over Iran for: (a) HS and (b)
    PMT methods. The performance of the HS method in relation to the PM-ETo was assessed
    through a set of goodness of fit indicators (Table 3). These statistics indicate
    that the HS method satisfactorily predicts ETo in most of the stations, which
    is supported by R2 higher than 0.90 and the regression coefficient b between 0.98
    and 1.02 in approximately 85% of the stations. The RMSE is lower than 0.70 and
    0.50 mm d−1 in 90% and 63% of the stations, respectively. These results are supported
    with the modelling efficiency (EF), larger than 0.95 and the index of agreement
    (dIA) higher than 0.99 in approximately 90% of stations. Differently, larger errors
    of estimate and lower goodness of fit indicators were obtained for Zabol, Abadan,
    Torbat, Birjand, Bandarabas, Sabzevar and Mashad, where the variance of the residuals
    of the estimation is high and does not respond to the required homoscedasticity,
    probably due to lack of considering wind speed within the HS method. 3.2. Performance
    of the PMT method The performance of the PMT method against the PM-ETo in all
    considered stations were also evaluated graphically (Fig. 4) and statistically
    (Table 4). Tmin was corrected for all considered stations in semi-arid to hyper-arid
    climates (Table 2) in order to better estimate Tdew for PMT computation. For humid
    climates, Tdew was differently estimated with Eq. (7). A trial and error procedure
    was adopted to search for the appropriate kRs used for computation of PMT, their
    values are indicated in Fig. 4 and Table 4. For some stations, as analyzed in
    Section 3.4, wind speed corrections were also adopted. Download : Download full-size

    4, the estimated PMT strongly correlate linearly with PM-ETo in most of the stations,
    implying that the PMT appropriately predicts the PM-ETo in all climatic zones
    of Iran. Fig. 4 suggests that the PMT particularly performs well for the stations
    characterized with semi arid to humid climates of western and northern Iran. The
    PMT also performs reasonably well in humid climate of the Caspian Sea region in
    the north, where Tdew was computed with Eq. (7), which allowed to consider the
    effect of high air humidity. The estimated PMT for most of the stations located
    in the central-southern and eastern arid and hyper-arid climates of Iran show
    also satisfactory agreement with PM-ETo, though relatively weak association were
    found for Abadan, Torbat, Birjand, Chabahar and, mainly, for Zabol station (Fig.
    4 and Table 4). All these stations also performed poorly for the HS method. The
    stations located in western and northern dry-sub-humid to humid climates of Iran
    have kRs between 0.10 and 0.18, while kRs varies from 0.11 to 0.20 for the stations
    situated in the semi-arid to hyper-arid regions of central-eastern Iran (Table
    4 and Fig. 3b). As was the case for the HS method, there are some cases where
    the selected kRs for a station differs from the regional pattern, e.g., the selected
    kRs for Tabriz station in north-western Iran is much higher than the kRs values
    of the surrounding stations. Fig. 3b shows the spatial pattern of kRs used for
    estimation of PMT over Iran, depicting a pattern very similar of that for the
    HS method in Fig. 3a. Apparently, the kRs is influenced by elevation, topography
    and the aridity index though in the present study weak correlations (not shown)
    were found between the aforementioned factors and the kRs values relative to both
    the PMT and HS methods. The statistics shown in Table 4 indicate that the PMT
    method satisfactorily predicts ETo in most of the stations, which is supported
    by R2 higher than 0.90 and b coefficient between 0.98 and 1.02 in 90 and 85% of
    the stations, respectively. The RMSE is lower than 0.70 and 0.50 mm d−1 in 90%
    and 68% of the cases, EF and dIA were ≥0.90 and ≥0.98 for more than 90% of the
    stations. These results are only slightly better than the corresponding results
    for the HS method in Table 3. Results suggest a good estimation of ETo with PMT,
    particularly for practical irrigation scheduling and for using in drought indices
    computation such as the PDSI (e.g., Paulo et al., 2012). Results indicate that
    the use of PMT method for ETo estimation in the study area is worthwhile when
    only limited data are available. However, coefficients of determination <0.90
    for Zabol, Chabahar, Abadan and Torbat suggest that the estimated PMT in these
    stations substantially deviates from the PM-ETo. The achieved results for PMT
    are consistent with those obtained for HS, which shows the weakest agreements
    with PM-ETo for the same stations as PMT. 3.3. Role of temperature adjustment
    for Tdew estimation The effectiveness of temperature adjustment in improving the
    PMT estimation was statistically evaluated for all considered stations, by comparing
    the regression coefficient b, R2 and RMSE statistics relating PMT and PM-ETo data,
    before and after temperature adjustment (Table 5). Table 5. Statistically assessment

    0.92 0.58 Results suggested that temperature adjustments for humid and sub-humid
    climates, i.e., computing Tdew from Eq. (7) instead of simply using Tmin, considerably
    improves PMT estimation, where b and R2 increased and RMSE decreased after temperature
    adjustment for all stations characterized with humid and sub-humid climates of
    Iran. As an example, the coefficient of determination for Rasht and Ramsar stations
    increased from 0.88 to 0.94 after temperature correction; for Ilam, RMSE decreased
    from 0.65 to 0.44 mm d−1. These results indicate that the good performance of
    PMT estimation analyzed in the previous section is largely due to temperature
    adjustment for humidity. Temperature adjustment for stations situated in semi-arid,
    arid and hyper-arid climates of Iran also showed to have improved ETo estimation.
    Differently from humid climates where temperature adjustment noticeably improved
    the R2 statistic, the influence of temperature adjustment in semi arid to hyper-arid
    climates largely consisted in substantially increasing the regression coefficient,
    with b approaching the 1:1 line. These results indicate that the temperature adjustment
    for aridity, with lowering Tdew relative to raw Tmin, leads to overcome the common
    under estimation of PMT in arid conditions. Meanwhile, despite negligible improvements
    of R2, noticeable improvements in RMSE statistic were observed for most of the
    stations situated in semi-arid, arid and hyper-arid climates. This fact suggests
    that temperature adjustment is of paramount importance for PMT estimation in such
    climates. 3.4. Role of wind speed in PMT estimation As were shown in Fig. 2, Fig.
    4, the estimated ETo by the HS and PMT methods show poor agreement with the PM-ETo
    at some stations situated in the very dry climate of eastern and southern Iran,
    where HS and PMT methods largely underestimate ETo for the warm season. In exploring
    the possible factor responsible for the observed disagreement, we noticed that
    the considered stations are located in the area where extreme wind speed occurs,
    particularly in the summer. The spatial pattern of the mean seasonal wind speed
    over the country is depicted in Fig. 5 to support an analysis about the possible
    role played by the wind factor in ETo estimation. In Fig. 5a and d it is evident
    that the mean autumn and winter wind speed do not exceed 2 m s−1 in most parts
    of the country except for a narrow band in southern and eastern Iran, where wind
    speed is between 3 and 4 m s−1. Fig. 5b shows an increase of wind speed in southern
    and eastern parts of Iran during spring, contrarily to northern half of the country.
    Differently, wind speed in summer increases drastically in eastern Iran (Fig.
    5c), where it may exceed 8 m s−1. These data indicate that the mean seasonal wind
    speed in southern and eastern Iran, particularly for the warm spring and summer
    seasons, is often much higher than the common default value of 2 m s−1 used for
    PMT estimation, thus leading to substantial deviation of PMT estimates relative
    to PM-ETo data, during those seasons. The role of extreme wind speed on PM-ETo
    estimation may be very important, mainly when it is associated with very hot weather
    in summer, which calls for using an estimate of wind speed different than that
    of the default value of 2 m s−1. Since the HS equation does not include any wind
    speed parameter, its results are likely underestimating ETo in windy and hot conditions
    like Zabol and various other stations located in arid and hyper-arid climates
    of southern and eastern Iran (Fig. 2). Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    5. Spatial patterns of mean seasonal wind speed (m s−1) over Iran for: (a) autumn,
    (b) spring, (c) summer and (d) winter. As depicted in Fig. 5, the highest wind
    speed, particularly in summer, is observed in Zabol, eastern Iran, where the PMT
    and HS estimations have shown the worst agreement with the PM-ETo (Fig. 2, Fig.
    4). This results from the fact that the observed wind speed in this station is
    several times higher than the default value of 2 m s−1, particularly during the
    very hot summer and late spring. The summer wind speed is also considerably higher
    than 2 m s−1 in Abadan, Sabzevar, Birjand, Torbat, Shahroud and Mashad stations
    in southern and eastern Iran, where the ETo estimated by PMT and HS have shown
    a weak agreement with the PM-ETo for extreme ETo values. The summer wind speed
    is also higher than the fixed value of 2 m s−1 in Tabriz, north-western Iran,
    giving rise to a wide dispersion of the highest ETo values in the scatter plots
    of this station (Fig. 2, Fig. 4). In most of these stations, the higher deviation
    of the PMT (and HS) estimations from the PM-ETo correspond to the extreme ETo
    values that occurred in the warm season of the year. Therefore, the observed disagreement
    between the PMT (and HS) estimations and PM-ETo in these stations can be partially
    due to not considering the wind speed influence in HS method and a default value
    of only 2 m s−1 in PMT, which is much smaller than the actual wind speed that
    is used for the PM-ETo computation. To examine the role played by wind speed in
    PM-ETo estimation, Fig. 6 illustrates the relationship between estimated ETo by
    PMT and PM-ETo at some selected stations, considering different scenarios: (1)
    using the default wind speed value of 2 m s−1 in PMT computations, (2) considering
    only the PM-ETo data corresponding to wind speed not exceeding 2 m s−1, (3) using
    observed local wind speed in PMT replacing the default wind speed value, and (4)
    using average seasonal wind speed to replace the default value of 2 m s−1 in PMT
    computation. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Relationships between
    estimated ETo by PMT method and PM-ETo at some selected stations when: the wind
    speed is fixed at 2 m s−1 for PMT computation (a–f); data with local wind speed
    > 2 m s−1 was not considered (g-i); local actual wind speed was taken for PMT
    computations (m–r), and regional averages of seasonal wind speed were used for
    PMT computations (s–x). As shown in Fig. 6a–f, the PMT method extremely underestimates
    ETo values corresponding to the summers in Shahroud, Mashad, Torbat, Abadan, Birjand
    and Zabol stations, thus leading to very low coefficients of determination, even
    though the optimum b slope could be achieved for some. By excluding the observations
    with wind speed >2 m s−1 from the analysis (scenario 2), the association between
    the PMT and PM-ETo noticeably improved, with increased coefficients of determination
    and reduced residuals of the variance represented by a narrower dispersion band
    of the scatter plots shown in Fig. 6g–l. To further justify the role of wind speed
    in the association between the PMT and PM-ETo, Fig. 6m–r illustrates that the
    association between the two models substantially improved when local wind speed
    was used for PMT computation rather than the default value (scenario 3). Differently
    from discussions in the literature suggesting that wind speed has very low impact
    on ETo estimation, the results obtained with scenario 3 illustrated that it is
    an important factor in arid and semi-arid climates when the stations are exposed
    to extreme wind speed, particularly in hot seasons. As an example, Fig. 6f shows
    the scatter plot for the extremely windy station of Zabol, in eastern Iran, which
    is well known for its extreme summer wind speed that usually dominates the region
    for the whole summer time (Fig. 5c). As is depicted in Fig. 6f both R2 and b are
    very low for scenario 1, thus indicating a very poor estimation of ETo by PMT.
    Substantial improvement was observed for scenario 2, when the data with extreme
    wind speed (wind speed >4 m−1) were excluded, which led to a considerable improvement
    of R2 and b (Fig. 6l). It is worth nothing that the selected threshold for Zabol
    was set to wind speed >4 m−1 since very few cases have wind speed <2 m−1. Fig.
    6r also demonstrates a much improved goodness of fit when local wind speed was
    used for PMT computation rather than the default value of 2 m s−1 (scenario 3),
    though the regression still remains nonlinear, which can be related to the quality
    of the wind data; however it could not be appropriately analyzed as the wind is
    a local dependent variable, so having extreme spatial variability in this region.
    In order to find a practical solution for improving the PMT estimates, it was
    supposed that using an appropriate regional wind speed instead of using a default
    value could improve the PMT estimation in windy areas (scenario 4); related results
    using an averaged seasonal wind speed are shown in Fig. 6s–x. In this scenario,
    two fixed wind speed values were used, respectively for cold and hot seasons.
    As shown in Fig. 6s–x, this approach was able to improve R2 but did not provide
    improved regression coefficients since b values indicate a quite large overestimation
    of ETo. Since all the observation datasets have different wind speeds, using the
    seasonal mean value improved some parts of the scatter plot but adversely impacted
    some other parts. Therefore, it can be concluded that since the wind speed is
    highly variable in time, it is likely that its time variation may have more influence
    than its magnitude in estimating PMT. In most of the stations the wind speed often
    is around 2 m s−1 throughout the year, whereas extreme winds may dominate a station
    only for specific periods of the year as is illustrated in Fig. 5; hence adopting
    any fixed value may lead to under- or over-estimation by the PMT method. As illustrated
    in Fig. 6s–x, using seasonal wind speed instead of the default value of 2 m s−1
    is less successful in improving PMT results in windy stations and is therefore
    not advisable. 3.5. Comparing PMT and HS methods As discussed earlier, the performances
    of both PMT and HS methods are generally adequate for estimating ETo for all climatic
    regions of Iran using limited available datasets. Table 6 presents the result
    of the Diebold and Mariano (1995) B statistic test that was used for cross-comparison
    of the adequacy of the estimations by the two methods relative to the PM-ETo.
    The test value is out of the interval [−1.96, 1.96] when there is a significant
    difference at 95% level. Results in Table 6 show that HS equation performed significantly
    better than PMT for 14 stations while PMT performed significantly better for 9
    stations. It is worth noting that the statistic B is positive (negative) and significant
    when HS (PMT) performed better. Better results for HS largely overcome those of
    PMT for the semi-arid region while PMT has shown to be superior for the humid
    and sub-humid areas. However, differences were not significant for 43% of stations
    considered in this study. Despite these statistic, the users should analyze the
    size of errors, particularly RMSE, the adequacy of linear regression, mainly relative
    to the value of the regression coefficient b, as well as the efficiency indicators
    EF and dIA. Table 6. The Diebold and Mariano (1995) B test for equal accuracy

    ETo The spatial pattern of annual ETo over Iran estimated with the PM-ETo method
    using full datasets (Fig. 7a) shows a gradual increase of ETo from north to South,
    with the lowest values over the northern humid and sub-humid climates of Iran
    and larger ETo estimates for arid and hyper-arid climates in the southern and
    eastern country. The range of annual ETo varies from 700 mm in the humid coastal
    areas of south-western Caspian Sea up to 2800 mm in hyper-arid desertic areas
    of eastern Iran. Most parts of the coastal areas of the Caspian Sea and the mountainous
    areas of northern and north-western Iran depict ETo values between 700 and 1200
    mm, increasing southward and eastward due to the decrease in latitude and/or altitude.
    The mountainous areas of mid-western and north-eastern Iran, as well as the mid-central
    region of the country, exhibit ETo between 1200 and 1600 mm, while the ETo values
    for a vast area in central, southern and eastern Iran range from 1600 to 2000
    mm. The highest ETo with 2000–2800 mm is observed in south-western and eastern
    Iran. The high ETo in south-western Iran is related to temperature, the highest
    observed in the country. Differently, in eastern Iran, it relates to the very
    high wind speed and dryness, with occurrence of very low annual mean relative
    humidity (<40%) that even reduced to <25% in summer when the region is exposed
    to extreme wind speed. The spatial pattern of PM-ETo over Iran represented herein
    is comparable to that of for Dinpashoh (2006), though the number of used stations
    and the considered data periods are different. The obtained result is also consistent
    with the results achieved by Tabari et al., 2011a, Tabari et al., 2011b and Tabari
    and Aghajanloo (2012) for eastern, western and northern Iran, respectively, considering
    both the magnitude and spatial variability of ETo. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 7. Spatial pattern of annual ETo over Iran estimated by (a) PM-ETo,
    (b) HS, and (c) PMT methods. Fig. 7b and c shows the spatial patterns of ETo over
    Iran computed with the HS and PMT methods, respectively. These spatial patterns
    are identical and also resemble to that of PM-ETo shown in Fig. 7a. However, Fig.
    7b shows lower estimates of ETo for eastern Iran relative to Fig. 7a and c since
    it was not possible to use local wind speed for HS estimation contrarily to the
    case for PM and PMT methods. The observed concordance of HS and PMT maps (Fig.
    7b and c) with the map of PM-ETo (Fig. 7a), considering both the spatial pattern
    and the magnitude of the estimations, in addition to results in Table 3, Table
    4, indicates that the HS and PMT methods are appropriate alternatives for estimation
    of ETo in all climatic regions of Iran, particularly for the very remote areas,
    when only minimum and maximum temperature are available. Using PMT may be preferable
    when the dataset is partly comprising full data or partially full data because
    then it is possible to use the PMT for the periods when radiation or humidity
    data are required. Then the same FAO-PM equation is used with either observation
    or estimated data. Differently, the HS method is preferable if it is not desirable
    to correct Tmin data to compensate for station aridity. 4. Discussion and conclusions
    Monthly averages of maximum and minimum temperature, relative humidity, sunshine
    duration and wind speed, corresponding to the period 1971–2005 at 40 Iranian synoptic
    stations distributed over the country were utilized for estimation of ETo using
    the PM-ETo, the temperature PMT and HS methods. Aiming at a comparative analysis
    of the behaviour of these methods, the climatic zones of Iran were identified
    utilizing the UNEP aridity index, which is based on the ratio of mean annual precipitation
    to mean annual potential evapotranspiration. To estimate ETo using both the HS
    and PMT methods, appropriate values for kRs, an empirical radiation adjustment
    coefficient, were searched for each station. For estimation of Tdew from Tmin
    to be used with the PMT, the latter was corrected for aridity. For humid climates
    an empirical approach to estimate Tdew from the mean temperature was used and
    applied for PMT estimation. The performance of the HS and PMT methods against
    PM-ETo were evaluated through a set of commonly used statistics. Results show
    that searching appropriate kRs for estimation of solar radiation for both HS and
    PMT methods results in significant accuracy improvement in the estimation of ETo.
    It was observed that kRs values for the stations located in the sub-humid and
    humid climates of western and northern Iran are smaller than those for the semi-arid
    to hyper-arid climates of central, southern and eastern Iran, suggesting a north-south
    and west-east increasing spatial trend. It was also found that the kRs values
    selected for both methods in a given station are either identical or show negligible
    difference. Despite results herein concern a wide range of climates, it is desirable
    to have these results confirmed through studies relative to other areas and using
    different time step computations. The adjustment of Tmin for estimating Tdew to
    be used with the PMT method has shown to highly improve the performance of the
    method for semi-arid to hyper-arid climates. Moreover, the adoption of an empirical
    approach to estimate Tdew from the minimum temperature also significantly increased
    the accuracy of PMT estimation for humid climates. Overall, estimates by HS and
    PMT strongly correlate with estimates by PM-ETo, implying that the considered
    methods appropriately predict ETo for all climatic regions of Iran if the appropriate
    kRs was considered. Results described also indicate that when datasets are incomplete,
    particularly relative to radiation and air humidity data, ETo calculations may
    be performed for the periods when data are lacking with the FAO-PM equation using
    radiation and/or VPD parameters estimated from Tmax and Tmin as for the PMT method.
    The statistical test on differences between HS and PMT methods has shown that
    HS is more often significantly superior to PMT in the semi-arid region while the
    PMT performed significantly better than HS in humid and sub-humid areas. However,
    no significant differences were found for 43% of cases. A weak/poor agreement
    was however found for some stations situated in the very dry climate of eastern
    and southern Iran owing to the role played there by extreme and variable wind
    speed. The observed discrepancies between HS (and PMT) and PM-ETo in the stations
    situated in eastern Iran is attributed to the extreme wind speed, particularly
    during summer when ETo is higher. The observed disagreement between the estimations
    by PMT (and HS) and PM-ETo may be partially due to not considering wind speed
    in HS method and to the less effective default wind speed value usually considered
    for PMT estimation, which is much lower than the actual value used there for PM-ETo
    computation. However, using seasonal regional values as default wind speed values
    decreased the variance of residuals and the heteroscedasticity of regressions
    but increased the regression coefficients and therefore ETo became over-estimated
    in these hot and windy locations. It is likely that the time variability of wind
    speed plays a major role in the discrepancies between PMT and PM-ETo estimates
    and therefore it is hardly possible to find a default value or empirical function
    that takes that variability into account in PMT when wind speed data are not available.
    Given these circumstances, it is likely not appropriate to try finding a modification
    of HS for considering wind speed. However, considering the need to minimize errors
    in estimating ETo when only temperature data are available in areas where wind
    may play a major role, this problem remains open to further research developments.
    The spatial distribution of annual ETo showed a gradual increasing from north
    to south, with the lowest ETo values observed over northern humid and sub-humid
    climates of Iran and larger ETo estimates for arid and hyper-arid climates in
    the southern and eastern country. The spatial patterns of ETo computed using limited
    weather data with HS and PMT methods are identical and resemble to that of PM-ETo,
    thus confirming the above referred conclusions indicating that the HS and PMT
    methods are appropriate alternatives for estimation of ETo in all climatic regions
    of Iran, particularly for the very remote stations having only minimum and maximum
    temperature records. References Ahmadi and Fooladmand, 2008 S.A. Ahmadi, H.R.

  key_findings:
  - The performance of the HS and PMT methods closely relates to the PM-ETo, implying
    that the considered methods appropriately predict the PM-ETo in all climatic regions
    of Iran if the appropriate kRs was considered.
  - Appropriate values for kRs for estimation of solar radiation for both HS and PMT
    methods result in significant accuracy improvement in the estimation of ETo.
  - The adjustment of Tmin for estimating Tdew to be used with the PMT method has
    shown to highly improve the performance of the method for semi-arid to hyper-arid
    climates.
  limitations:
  - The results cannot be extrapolated to other regions without caution
  main_objective: To evaluate the potential and accuracy of the PMT and HS methods
    for estimation of ETo in different climatic regions of Iran and to refine the
    methodologies for better adapting both the PMT and HS methods to the existing
    environmental conditions.

  explanation: This paper uses machine learning with multi-band satellite measurements
    to predict global contiguous solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) observations
    from airborne measurements. Their estimated SIF not only has high accuracy but
    also a small bias compared to the near-surface SIF observations, which also has
    clear spatiotemporal variations (e.g., canopy structure and vegetation types).
    This study provides a feasible method to reproduce global SIF with few centimeters'
    resolution and hourly temporal resolution.

    rescence (SIF) has shown great potential to monitor the pho-\ntosynthetic activity\
    \ of terrestrial ecosystems. However, sev-\neral issues, including low spatial\
    \ and temporal resolution\nof the gridded datasets and high uncertainty of the\
    \ individ-\nual retrievals, limit the applications of SIF. In addition, in-\n\
    consistency in measurement footprints also hinders the di-\nrect comparison between\
    \ gross primary production (GPP)\nfrom eddy covariance (EC) ﬂux towers and satellite-retrieved\n\
    SIF. In this study, by training a neural network (NN) with\nsurface reﬂectance\
    \ from the MODerate-resolution Imaging\nSpectroradiometer (MODIS) and SIF from\
    \ Orbiting Carbon\nObservatory-2 (OCO-2), we generated two global spatially\n\
    contiguous SIF (CSIF) datasets at moderate spatiotempo-\nral (0.05◦ 4-day) resolutions\
    \ during the MODIS era, one\nfor clear-sky conditions (2000–2017) and the other\
    \ one in\nall-sky conditions (2000–2016). The clear-sky instantaneous\nCSIF (CSIFclear-inst)\
    \ shows high accuracy against the clear-\nsky OCO-2 SIF and little bias across\
    \ biome types. The all-\nsky daily average CSIF (CSIFall-daily) dataset exhibits\
    \ strong\nspatial, seasonal and interannual dynamics that are consistent\nwith\
    \ daily SIF from OCO-2 and the Global Ozone Monitor-\ning Experiment-2 (GOME-2).\
    \ An increasing trend (0.39 %)\nof annual average CSIFall-daily is also found,\
    \ conﬁrming the\ngreening of Earth in most regions. Since the difference be-\n\
    tween satellite-observed SIF and CSIF is mostly caused by\nthe environmental down-regulation\
    \ on SIFyield, the ratio be-\ntween OCO-2 SIF and CSIFclear-inst can be an effective\
    \ in-\ndicator of drought stress that is more sensitive than the nor-\nmalized\
    \ difference vegetation index and enhanced vegetation\nindex. By comparing CSIFall-daily\
    \ with GPP estimates from\n40 EC ﬂux towers across the globe, we ﬁnd a large cross-\n\
    site variation (c.v. = 0.36) of the GPP–SIF relationship with\nthe highest regression\
    \ slopes for evergreen needleleaf for-\nest. However, the cross-biome variation\
    \ is relatively limited\n(c.v. = 0.15). These two contiguous SIF datasets and\
    \ the de-\nrived GPP–SIF relationship enable a better understanding of\nthe spatial\
    \ and temporal variations of the GPP across biomes\nand climate.\n1\nIntroduction\n\
    Obtaining a spatiotemporal continuous photosynthetic car-\nbon ﬁxation or gross\
    \ primary production (GPP) dataset is\ncrucial to food security, ecosystem service\
    \ and health eval-\nuation, and global carbon cycle studies (Beer et al., 2010).\n\
    However, this is not possible without remote sensing data,\nsince in situ carbon\
    \ ﬂux measurements, such as FLUXNET\n(Baldocchi et al., 2001), are usually costly\
    \ and have lim-\nited spatial and temporal coverage (Schimel et al., 2015).\n\
    Many remote-sensing-based productivity efﬁciency models\n(PEMs) have been built,\
    \ but the model structure and param-\neterizations differ from each other and\
    \ the performance of\nmost models is not satisfactory in terms of simulated inter-\n\
    annual variability and trends (Anav et al., 2015; Chen et al.,\n2017).\nMüller\
    \ (1874) found that the chlorophyll ﬂuorescence\n(Chl F) from a dilute chlorophyll\
    \ solution was much stronger\nthan the Chl F from a green leaf, suggesting that\
    \ an alterna-\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European\
    \ Geosciences Union.\n5780\nY. Zhang et al.: A global spatially contiguous solar-induced\
    \ ﬂuorescence dataset\ntive energy pathway exists for leaves in vivo. In the 1980s,\n\
    scientists found that plant photosynthesis and heat dissipa-\ntion are two alternatives\
    \ to quench the excited chlorophyll,\nand there is a close linkage between Chl\
    \ F and carbon as-\nsimilation rate (Genty et al., 1989; Krause and Weis, 1991).\n\
    Leaf-level photosynthesis (Aleaf) and ﬂuorescence (Chl F)\nshare the same source\
    \ of energy originating from photo-\nsynthetically active radiation (PAR) absorbed\
    \ by chlorophyll\n(APARchl), which can be written using a light-use efﬁciency\n\
    (LUE) approach (Monteith, 1972):\nChl F = PAR × f PARchl × φF\n(1)\nAleaf = PAR\
    \ × f PARchl × φP,\n(2)\nwhere φF and φP represent the efﬁciencies for Chl F emis-\n\
    sion and photochemistry, respectively. f PARchl, being differ-\nent from the conventional\
    \ deﬁnition of fraction of photosyn-\nthetically active radiation absorption,\
    \ only considers the frac-\ntions absorbed by chlorophyll pigments where the photosyn-\n\
    thesis and ﬂuorescence originate (Zhang et al., 2018c). How-\never, Chl F measurements\
    \ have been mostly conducted at the\nleaf level, using pulse amplitude modulation\
    \ (PAM) ﬂuorom-\neters (Porcar-Castell et al., 2008; Roháˇcek and Barták, 1999).\n\
    In this case, the measured Chl F intensity is not induced by\nthe Sun but by the\
    \ modulated light source. Although the ab-\nsolute value of the Chl F intensity\
    \ does not directly link to\nAleaf, it can still be used to calculate the ﬂuorescence\
    \ yield\nand investigate the reaction mechanism of the energy parti-\ntioning\
    \ during the light reaction, and to calculate the quantum\nyield for photochemistry\
    \ or as a tool to detect plant reactions\nunder stress (Adams and Demmig-Adams,\
    \ 2004; Flexas et\nal., 2002).\nThe successful retrieval of solar-induced (steady-state)\n\
    chlorophyll ﬂuorescence (SIF) from satellites has made it\npossible for vegetation\
    \ photosynthetic activities to be ob-\nserved at the global scale (Frankenberg\
    \ et al., 2011; Guanter\net al., 2012; Joiner et al., 2011, 2013). Satellite SIF\
    \ can be\nexpressed as a function similar to the Chl F at the leaf level\nbut\
    \ with extra terms considering the radiative transfer within\nthe canopy and through\
    \ the atmosphere (Joiner et al., 2014):\nSIFsat(λ) = PAR × f PARchl × 2F (λ) ×\
    \ fesc(λ,θs,θv,φ)\n× τatm(λ,θs,θv,φ),\n(3)\nwhere the satellite-retrieved SIF\
    \ (SIFsat), ﬂuorescence yield\n(2F ), fesc and τatm are all functions of the wavelength\
    \ (λ); in\naddition, fesc and τatm are also affected by sun-sensor geom-\netry\
    \ characterized by Sun zenith angle (SZA; θs), view zenith\nangle (θv) and relative\
    \ azimuth angle (φ). fesc is a factor de-\nscribing how much SIF emitted by the\
    \ chloroplast leaves the\ncanopy, and τatm is a function of atmospheric optical\
    \ depth,\nwhich indicates how much SIF that leaves the canopy top\npasses through\
    \ the atmosphere before it is captured by the\nsatellite sensors. It should be\
    \ noted that the fraction of PAR\nfor ﬂuorescence (f PARF ) may have a different\
    \ activation\nspectrum than that for photosynthesis (f PARchl), but this dif-\n\
    ference is ignored here for simplicity. Although additional\nfactors come into\
    \ play during this process, satellite-retrieved\nSIF shows high consistency with\
    \ GPP using both model\nsimulations and ground-based measurements from eddy co-\n\
    variance (EC) ﬂux towers, at least at the monthly timescale\n(Guanter et al.,\
    \ 2014; Li et al., 2018a; Zhang et al., 2016c,\nb). In addition, recent studies\
    \ suggest that the GPP–SIF rela-\ntionship is consistent across biome types (Sun\
    \ et al., 2017).\nThis ﬁnding, if valid across all biomes, would greatly beneﬁt\n\
    the usage of SIF for model benchmarking (Luo et al., 2012)\nand global GPP estimation.\n\
    However, several issues hinder exploring the relationship\nbetween SIF and in\
    \ situ GPP estimates. Since the SIF sig-\nnal is very small and sensors used to\
    \ retrieve SIF were\nnot initially built to estimate SIF, the satellite-retrieved\
    \ SIF\nusually has a large footprint and large uncertainties in in-\ndividual\
    \ retrievals (Frankenberg et al., 2014; Joiner et al.,\n2013, 2016). For instance,\
    \ the SIF retrieval from the Global\nOzone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) has\
    \ a footprint\nof 40km×40km or larger, and the SIF from the Greenhouse\ngases\
    \ Observing SATellite (GOSAT) has a circular footprint\nwith 10.5 km in diameter.\
    \ Direct comparison between the\nsatellite-retrieved SIF signal and GPP estimates\
    \ from EC ﬂux\ntower sites thus faces the problem of spatial inconsistency\nexcept\
    \ in areas of large homogenous landscape, e.g., the US\nMidwest cropland (Zhang\
    \ et al., 2014) or boreal evergreen\nforests (Walther et al., 2016). However,\
    \ corn (C4 pathway)\nand soybean (C3 pathway) in SIF footprints have different\n\
    electron use efﬁciencies (Guan et al., 2016), which should\naffect the relationship\
    \ between SIF and GPP. The low preci-\nsion of SIF measurements also leads to\
    \ a need for averaging\nmultiple pixels either in space or time before being used.\n\
    SIF retrieved from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2\n(OCO-2) satellite partially\
    \ solved this issue with a much\nsmaller footprint size (1.3km × 2.25km), higher\
    \ signal-to-\nnoise ratio compared to GOSAT (relatively higher SIF re-\ntrieval\
    \ accuracy) and much larger numbers of observations\nper day (Frankenberg et al.,\
    \ 2014; Sun et al., 2018). However,\ndue to the sparse sampling strategy and long\
    \ revisit cycle,\nthe OCO-2 SIF data have large gaps between nearby swaths,\n\
    and the average sampling frequency for each ﬂux tower site\nis only 3.21 year−1\
    \ during 2015–2016 (Lu et al., 2018). In\naddition, OCO-2 is often aggregated\
    \ to a monthly dataset at\nrelatively coarse spatial resolution, typically at\
    \ 1◦×1◦, which\nlimits its application in small regions. Although several sta-\n\
    tistical methods have been proposed to downscale satellite\nobservations to ﬁner\
    \ spatial–temporal resolutions (Tadi´c et\nal., 2015, 2017), considering the large\
    \ land surface hetero-\ngeneity and wide gaps between OCO-2 swaths (∼ 100 km),\n\
    it could be challenging to apply these methods to OCO-2 SIF.\nA high spatiotemporal\
    \ resolution SIF dataset is needed\nto improve our understanding of the relationship\
    \ between\nSIF and GPP and provide accurate GPP estimates at the\nglobal scale.\
    \ As discussed previously, the satellite-observed\nBiogeosciences, 15, 5779–5800,\

    \ contiguous solar-induced ﬂuorescence dataset\n5781\nSIF contains signals from\
    \ APARchl, ﬂuorescence yield, and\ncanopy and atmospheric attenuation. APARchl\
    \ is considered\nto be the ﬁrst-order approximation of SIF as it exhibits high\n\
    correlation with SIF at the canopy scale (Du et al., 2017;\nRossini et al., 2016;\
    \ Verrelst et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2018c).\nPrevious studies have shown that\
    \ f PARchl can be inversely\nestimated using the surface reﬂectances and radiative\
    \ trans-\nfer models (Zhang et al., 2005, 2016a). The canopy structure\ninformation\
    \ that affects the SIF reabsorption within canopy\nis also embedded in the near-infrared\
    \ reﬂectance (Badgley\net al., 2017; Knyazikhin et al., 2013; Yang and van der\
    \ Tol,\n2018). Many previous studies have shown high correlation\nbetween SIF\
    \ and vegetation indices (VIs), especially VIs re-\nlated to the chlorophyll concentration\
    \ (Frankenberg et al.,\n2011; Guanter et al., 2012). Therefore, broadband surface\n\
    reﬂectances may have the potential to be used to estimate\nvegetation information\
    \ and reconstruct global SIF (Duveiller\nand Cescatti, 2016; Gentine and Alemohammad,\
    \ 2018a).\nHowever, physical models that can predict SIF (e.g., the\nSoil Canopy\
    \ Observation, Photochemistry and Energy ﬂuxes,\nSCOPE; van der Tol et al., 2009)\
    \ often require many param-\neters, making it difﬁcult to use reﬂectance and modeling\
    \ to\npredict SIF at a larger scale.\nNeural networks (NNs), together with many\
    \ other ma-\nchine learning algorithms, have been used with remote sens-\ning\
    \ datasets in the Earth sciences, especially for carbon and\nwater ﬂuxes estimation\
    \ (Alemohammad et al., 2017; Jung\net al., 2011; Tramontana et al., 2016), land\
    \ cover mapping\n(Kussul et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2017), soil moisture re-\n\
    trievals and downscaling (Alemohammad et al., 2018; Ko-\nlassa et al., 2018) or\
    \ to bypass parameterization (Gentine et\nal., 2018). These studies mostly attempted\
    \ to link the satel-\nlite signals with limited in situ observation or model sim-\n\
    ulations for model training, while taking advantage of the\nlarge amount of data\
    \ in remote sensing observations; they\napplied the trained algorithm to generate\
    \ a regional or global\ndataset. Reconstructing SIF from surface reﬂectance, on\
    \ the\nother hand, uses no in situ observations but faces more prob-\nlems related\
    \ to the satellite data quality assurance. The SIF–\nreﬂectance relationship is\
    \ complicated, and the NN beneﬁts\nfrom the fact that an explicit physical and\
    \ radiative transfer\nrelationship is not required.\nIn this study, we aim to\
    \ generate a global contiguous\nSIF (CSIF) product based on the SIF retrievals\
    \ from OCO-\n2 and surface reﬂectances from Moderate-resolution Imag-\ning Spectroradiometer\
    \ (MODIS) aboard the Terra and Aqua\nsatellites. The CSIF dataset aims to ﬁll\
    \ the spatial gaps\nbetween the OCO-2 swaths and temporal gaps due to the\nlong\
    \ revisit cycle of OCO-2. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst trained\nand validated the NN using\
    \ the satellite-observed instanta-\nneous SIF under clear-sky conditions so that\
    \ the relationship\nis not affected by cloud-related artifacts. We further gener-\n\
    ated two SIF products, namely the clear-sky instantaneous\nSIF (CSIFclear-inst)\
    \ and the all-sky daily SIF (CSIFall-daily).\nThe spatiotemporal variations of\
    \ these CSIF products were\nanalyzed and compared with SIF from OCO-2 and three\n\
    other GOME-2 SIF datasets. Finally, we showed two applica-\ntions of CSIF datasets:\
    \ (1) monitoring drought impact using\nCSIFclear-inst and OCO-2 SIF; (2) evaluating\
    \ the GPP–SIF\nrelationship by comparing CSIF with GPP estimates from\n40 ﬂux\
    \ tower sites.\n2\nMaterials and methods\n2.1\nOCO-2 solar-induced chlorophyll\
    \ ﬂuorescence\ndataset\nThe 8100r OCO-2 SIF data between September 2014 and\n\
    December 2017 were used for NN training and evaluation\n(Frankenberg, 2015; Frankenberg\
    \ et al., 2014; Sun et al.,\n2018). The daily sounding-based SIF retrievals at\
    \ 757 nm\nwere ﬁrst aggregated to 0.05◦ (around 5.6km×5.6km at the\nEquator),\
    \ consistent with MODIS Climate Modeling Grid\n(CMG) resolution. The reasons for\
    \ using this resolution in-\nclude the following: (1) it is directly comparable\
    \ (of the same\norder of magnitude) to the OCO-2 SIF footprint size (around\n\
    1.3km × 2.25km) and the samples within each grid cell can\nbe more evenly distributed\
    \ and thus more representative of\nthe grid cell SIF values than using much coarser\
    \ 1◦ × 1◦ or\n2◦ ×2◦ grids; (2) by averaging multiple observations, the un-\n\
    certainty in the SIF signal can be approximately reduced by a\nfactor of √n (n\
    \ is the number of observations within this grid\ncell), assuming independent\
    \ estimates and homogeneous SIF\nvalue within each grid cell (Frankenberg et al.,\
    \ 2014). During\nthis aggregation, we only used cloud-free observations indi-\n\
    cated by the OCO-2 cloud ﬂag. For each 0.05◦ grid cell, the\nSIF value was only\
    \ calculated when it contained more than\nﬁve cloud-free SIF soundings. Although\
    \ several studies have\nshown that SIF at different wavelengths has different\
    \ sen-\nsitivity to stress and leaf and canopy reabsorption (Porcar-\nCastell\
    \ et al., 2014; Rossini et al., 2015, 2016), we only use\nSIF at 757 nm since\
    \ it showed superior performance to SIF\nat 771 nm in predicting GPP (Li et al.,\
    \ 2018a). The years\n2015 and 2016 were used for training and 2014 and 2017\n\
    were used for validation. Altogether, 2 947 819 SIF grid cells\npassed quality\
    \ check during 2014–2017. Figure 1 shows the\nspatial distribution of the SIF\
    \ grid cells used for training and\nvalidation (test). It should be noted that\
    \ the OCO-2 satellite\nstarted obtaining data from September 2014 and experienced\n\
    some malfunctioning during August and September in 2017,\ncausing lower coverage\
    \ for validation samples in boreal re-\ngions.\nIn addition to these cloud-free\
    \ observations, we also cal-\nculated the all-sky SIF at 0.05◦ resolution. All\
    \ SIF retrievals\nthat passed the suggested quality checks (documented in de-\n\
    tailed by Sun et al., 2018) were used for the aggregation. The\naggregated all-sky\
    \ instantaneous SIF retrievals were con-\nverted to daily values based on the\
    \ solar zenith angle (Zhang\net al., 2018a). We used this dataset to validate\
    \ the all-sky\nwww.biogeosciences.net/15/5779/2018/\nBiogeosciences, 15, 5779–5800,\

    \ Sect. 2.5). In both cloud-free and\nall-sky aggregations, only observations\
    \ from the nadir mode\nwere used since glint mode tends to underestimate SIF (Sun\n\
    et al., 2018).\n2.2\nMODIS reﬂectance dataset (MCD43C4 V006)\nWe used the 0.05◦\
    \ daily nadir bidirectional reﬂectance dis-\ntribution adjusted reﬂectance (NBAR)\
    \ product from MODIS\n(MCD43C4 V006) during 2000–2017 as input variables for\n\
    the NN. The NBAR product computed the reﬂectance at a\nnadir viewing angle for\
    \ each pixel at local solar noon. Com-\npared to MOD09 or MYD09 surface reﬂectance\
    \ product, it\nremoved the angle effects and therefore should be more sta-\nble\
    \ and consistent (Schaaf et al., 2002). This dataset was\nprocessed in two different\
    \ ways for training and prediction.\nFor the training process, following Gentine\
    \ and Alemoham-\nmad (2018a), we extracted the reﬂectance from the ﬁrst four\n\
    bands of MODIS (centered at 645, 858, 469 and 555 nm, re-\nspectively) for the\
    \ corresponding pixels and days when the\ncloud-free SIF observations were obtained.\
    \ It should be noted\nthat although the MCD43C4 is generated for each day and\n\
    can match the daily SIF observations, the MCD43C4 NBAR\nuses 16 days worth of\
    \ inputs and so that the reﬂectances in-\ncludes the information on other days\
    \ than the day of inter-\nest. However, we consider this to have limited effects\
    \ since\n(1) the vegetation growth/changes are continuous in time,\n(2) the NBAR\
    \ product uses 16-day data but also emphasizes\nthe speciﬁc day of interest (Schaaf,\
    \ 2018). These four bands\nwere selected because the visible and near-infrared\
    \ bands\nincluded most of the vegetation information and drives the\nvariation\
    \ of SIF (Verrelst et al., 2015). We also tested us-\ning all seven bands with/without\
    \ the meteorological variables\n(temperature and vapor pressure deﬁcit, obtained\
    \ from the\nOCO-2 SIF lite ﬁles) to train the NN, but the improvements\nin training\
    \ and validation were very minor (R2 increased by\nless than 0.01; data not shown),\
    \ and thus we decided not to\nuse it. Since SIF is very sensitive to the incoming\
    \ solar ra-\ndiation, using cloud-free training samples can minimize the\nuncertainty\
    \ of using cosine of the solar zenith angle as the\nproxy of incoming PAR. It\
    \ should be noted that the training\ndataset may contain snow-affected samples,\
    \ but these were\nnot removed to get a more realistic prediction of SIF during\n\
    winter.\nFor prediction, we ﬁrst aggregated the daily reﬂectance to\n4 days. The\
    \ 4-day temporal resolution is selected to reach a\nbalance among application\
    \ requirements, information redun-\ndancy and dataset sizes. During this process,\

    \ together with other datasets allowed us to predict\nSIF at 4-day 0.05◦ resolution\
    \ during 2000–2017. Since this\nprocessing does not involve any extra information\
    \ and only\nuses the reﬂectance observations from the successful model\ninversion,\
    \ it should be comparable to the reﬂectance used for\nNN training.\n2.3\nMachine\
    \ learning algorithms\nA feed-forward NN is a number of computational nodes\n\
    (called neurons) structured in a single or multi-layer archi-\ntecture. Each neuron\
    \ is connected with all neurons in the pre-\nvious layer and next layer. The neuron\
    \ values are calculated\nusing an activation function with a pre-activated value,\
    \ i.e.,\nthe weighted sum of all neurons in previous layer plus biases.\nThe training\
    \ of the NN attempts to optimize these weights\nand biases so that the differences\
    \ between the output vari-\nable in the training data and NN prediction are minimized.\
    \ In\nthis study, we used Tensorﬂow (https://www.tensorﬂow.org,\nlast access:\
    \ 27 September 2018) and built feed-forward net-\nworks with one to three layers\
    \ and two to nine neurons for\neach layer. After training models with data from\
    \ 2015 and\n2016, we validated the models using the test dataset from the\nyears\
    \ 2014 and 2017. We then picked the one with best per-\nformance and simplest\
    \ structure for SIF prediction. The rec-\ntiﬁed linear unit (ReLU) was used as\
    \ the activation function\nsince it has shown better performance in our application,\
    \ and\nthe cost function used is the root mean square error (RMSE).\nWe used 50\
    \ epochs with a batch size of 1024. Before training,\neach variable was normalized\
    \ by its mean and standardized\ndeviation. Since the NN is not deep and there\
    \ is no sign of\noverﬁtting, we did not use any regularization methods during\n\
    the training.\n2.4\nReconstructing the clear-sky instantaneous SIF and\ndaily\
    \ SIF\nDuring the NN training process, we only used the SIF\nand reﬂectance data\
    \ in clear-sky conditions, and therefore\ncos(SZA) was used as a proxy of the\
    \ incoming photosyn-\nthetically active radiation at top of canopy. In the prediction\n\
    process, we also used the calculated cos(SZA) based on the\nsatellite overpass\
    \ local solar time and latitude. Since we did\nnot consider the cloud and aerosol\
    \ attenuation of the PAR,\nthis product was referred to as the “clear-sky instantaneous\n\
    SIF (CSIFclear-inst)”.\nIn addition to the clear-sky instantaneous SIF, we also\
    \ cal-\nculated two daily SIF data by assuming that the incoming\nsolar radiation\
    \ is the only factor that drives the diurnal cy-\ncle (Zhang et al., 2018a). All-sky\
    \ daily SIF (CSIFall-daily)\ncan be calculated using the clear-sky top-of-canopy\
    \ radia-\ntion (PARclear-inst) and the daily average radiation from the\nBreathing\
    \ Earth System Simulator (BESS) (Ryu et al., 2018):\nCSIFall-daily = CSIFclear-inst\n\
    PARclear-inst\n× PARBESS\ndaily ,\n(4)\nwhere PARclear−inst was calculated following\
    \ previous stud-\nies that only considered atmospheric scattering (see Ap-\npendix\
    \ A1). Clear-sky daily SIF (CSIFclear-daily) assumes no\ncloud throughout the\
    \ day and can be calculated by multiply-\ning CSIFclear-inst with a daily correction\
    \ factor (γ ) (Zhang et\nal., 2018a):\nCSIFclear−daily = CSIFclear−inst × γ.\n\
    (5)\nγ is calculated as the ratio between the cos(SZA) during the\nsatellite overpass\
    \ and the daily averaged cos(SZA).\n2.5\nGOME-2 SIF (SIFGOME-2), reconstructed\
    \ SIF from\nGOME-2 (RSIFGOME-2) and SIF∗ datasets\nIn this study, we also used\
    \ the GOME-2 SIF (SIFGOME-2),\nreconstructed SIF from GOME-2 (RSIFGOME-2) using\
    \ ma-\nchine learning and the SIF∗ dataset in comparison with our\ncontiguous\
    \ SIF from OCO-2. The GOME-2 SIF V27 was\nretrieved using a principle component\
    \ analysis algorithm in\nthe wavelength range 734–758 nm (Joiner et al., 2013,\
    \ 2016).\nThe V27 version, compared to the widely used V26, provides\ndaily correction\
    \ factor and improved bias correction and cal-\nibration (https://avdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/,\
    \ last access: 27 Septem-\nber 2018). The level-3 monthly 0.5◦ daily average SIF\
    \ was\nused to compare with CSIFall-daily.\nRSIFGOME-2 (Gentine and Alemohammad,\
    \ 2018a) uses a\nsimilar machine learning technique approach to CSIF but the\n\
    training is based on the biweekly gridded SIF product from\nGOME-2 and the 8-day\
    \ MYD09A1 reﬂectance dataset. Both\nclear-sky and cloudy-sky SIF are used for\
    \ NN training. This\ndataset has a spatial resolution of 0.05◦ and 8-day temporal\n\
    resolution. Both RSIFGOME-2 and CSIFall-daily were aggre-\ngated to the 0.5◦ and\
    \ semi-monthly to facilitate the compari-\nson.\nThe SIF∗ dataset (Duveiller and\
    \ Cescatti, 2016) applies a\nstatistical method and calibrates a model that links\
    \ monthly\n0.5◦ SIF to the normalized difference vegetation index\n(NDVI), evapotranspiration\
    \ (ET) and land surface tempera-\nture (LST) dataset for each moving window. The\
    \ model and\nits spatiotemporally varied parameters were then applied to\nﬁner\
    \ resolution dataset (NDVI, ET, LST) with a weighted\naverage to generate SIF\
    \ at 0.05◦ resolution. In this study,\nwe used the 0.5◦ monthly SIF∗ dataset during\
    \ 2007–2013 to\ncompare with CSIF.\n2.6\nComparing CSIF with GPP at ﬂux tower\

    (http://ﬂuxnet.ﬂuxdata.org,\nlast\naccess:\n27\nSeptember\n2018) to investigate\
    \ the SIF–GPP relationship. Since the\nCSIF dataset is continuous in space and\
    \ time, it provides\nmany more samples pairs compared to the original OCO-2\n\
    SIF data (Lu et al., 2018). However, because of the land-\nscape heterogeneity\
    \ and inconsistency between the ﬂux\ntower footprint and CSIF pixel size, a rigorous\
    \ site selection\nis needed. We took the vegetation growth condition into\nconsideration\
    \ during this process: (1) the annual average,\nminimum, maximum and seasonal\
    \ variability (represented\nby standard deviation) of NDVI (from MOD13Q1 C6) for\n\
    the target pixel (where the ﬂux tower is located, 250 m\nby 250 m) need to be\
    \ similar (within 20 % difference or\n0.05 NDVI) to the neighboring (5 km by 5\
    \ km) area; (2) the\nmaximum NDVI value for target pixel and neighboring area\n\
    needs to be greater than 0.2 (not barren). The daily GPP\nestimates, estimated\
    \ using nighttime method (Reichstein\net al., 2005), were averaged and aggregated\
    \ into 4-day\nvalues to compare with CSIF. The 4-day GPP based on\nmore than 80\
    \ % of half-hourly valid (not gap-ﬁlled) net\necosystem exchange was retained.\
    \ Only sites that have at\nleast 92 valid observations (1 year) were used. Only\
    \ 40 out\nof 166 sites passed these criteria and were grouped into\ndifferent\
    \ biome types (Table S1). In addition to CSIFall-daily,\nwe also calculated CSIFclear-daily\
    \ and CSIFsite which used\nﬂux-tower-observed radiation instead of PARBESS\ndaily\
    \ in Eq. (4).\n3\nResults\n3.1\nNN training and validation\nThe NN with one layer\
    \ and ﬁve neurons generally pre-\ndicts the OCO-2 SIF during the training with\
    \ a coefﬁ-\ncient of determination (R2) around 0.8 and an RMSE of\n0.18 mW m−2\
    \ nm−1 sr−1 (Fig. 2). The model also performs\nwell in the validation (R2 = 0.79,\
    \ RMSE = 0.18) and does\nnot show effects of overﬁtting. Using a variety of layer\
    \ (one\nto three) and neuron (two to nine) combinations, we found\nthat one layer\
    \ with ﬁve neurons exhibited slightly higher\nmodel performance during the validation\
    \ compared with a\nmore complex NN (Fig. A1 in Appendix). Therefore, we\nchose\
    \ to use the four-band reﬂectances to feed the one-layer-\nﬁve-neuron NN to generate\
    \ the contiguous SIF for 2000 to\n2017 when MCD43C4 NBAR dataset is available.\n\
    We also investigated the bias of our prediction among dif-\nferent biome types\
    \ in Fig. 3. For 9 out of 14 biome types,\nthe differences between the CSIFclear-inst\
    \ and the satellite-\nretrieved SIF are less than 10 %, and most of the biases\
    \ were\nwithin 5 %. Wetlands and urban ecosystem show a 15 % bias\ncompared to\
    \ the satellite-retrieved SIF, which may be caused\nby the water or built-up contamination\
    \ on the reﬂectance sig-\nnal and the relatively small sample numbers. For savannas\n\
    and grassland, the changes in ﬂuorescence yield due to sea-\nsonal drought may\
    \ be important, which cannot be consid-\nered in the NN based on reﬂectances only.\
    \ Over croplands,\nCSIF exhibits a 12 % underestimation. The croplands usually\n\
    have high nitrogen/chlorophyll concentration that may not be\nfully captured by\
    \ the four broadband reﬂectances (Wu et al.,\n2008). Because we did not build\
    \ biome-speciﬁc NNs for the\ntraining, we do not expect biome-speciﬁc (especially\
    \ needle-\nleaf vs. broadleaf) relationships between SIF and reﬂectance.\nInterestingly,\
    \ we still reproduced SIF with very high accu-\nracy regardless of the plant function\
    \ traits (PFTs), i.e., leaf\ntypes and canopy characteristics (leaf clumping,\
    \ etc.). This\nsuggests that the escape factor and long-term changes in\nmean\
    \ ﬂuorescence yield might be correctly accounted for by\nthe NN across PFTs, through\
    \ the information available in the\nreﬂectances only. However, it should be noted\
    \ that this does\nnot suggest that the NN and reﬂectances can fully replicate\n\
    the ﬂuorescence yield variations due to short-term variations\ncaused by stresses.\n\

    OCO-2 SIF for 12 typical biome types (Fig. 4). The predicted\nCSIF accurately\
    \ captures the seasonal and interannual vari-\nation for most biome types, while\
    \ the standard deviation for\neach DOY is usually smaller than OCO-2 SIF. This\
    \ may sug-\ngest that the uncertainty of SIF is smaller in CSIF dataset.\nFor\
    \ some ecosystems, e.g., DBF, MF and CRO, CSIF shows\nslight underestimation during\
    \ the peak growing season.\nWhen comparing the daily average SIF from satel-\n\
    lite\nretrievals\nwith\nthe\npredicted\nall-sky\ndaily\nCSIF\n(CSIFall-daily)\
    \ dataset (Fig. 5), the predicted SIF exhibits\n∼ 7 % underestimation, with an\
    \ R2 of 0.71 and a RMSE\nof 0.08 mW m−2 nm−1 sr−1. The clear-sky daily CSIF\n\
    (CSIFclear-daily) shows ∼ 11 % overestimation, with a slightly\nhigher R2 and\
    \ lower RMSE. Considering the uncertainty in\nSIF retrievals and the inconsistency\
    \ in time of the compari-\nson (satellite SIF was based on instantaneous PAR at\
    \ the time\nof satellite overpass and converted to daily values assuming\nthe\
    \ atmospheric condition did not change within a day; pre-\ndicted CSIF was based\
    \ on 4-day average PAR), the all-sky\ndaily CSIF performs reasonably well.\n3.2\n\
    Spatial–temporal variation of the global 0.05◦ SIF\ndatasets\nUsing the trained\
    \ NN with the gap-ﬁlled reﬂectance datasets,\nwe produced two global CSIF datasets\
    \ at 4-day temporal and\n0.05◦ spatial resolution. Figure 6 shows the spatial\
    \ patterns\nof the 90th percentile for each pixel and the annual average\nfor\
    \ both clear-sky instantaneous CSIF (CSIFclear-inst) and the\nall-sky daily average\
    \ CSIF (CSIFall-daily). For the 90th per-\ncentile, CSIFclear-inst exhibits hotspots\
    \ in the tropical rain-\nforest, south Asia and the North American corn belt,\
    \ con-\nsistent with regions with high peak productivity (Guanter et\nal., 2014);\
    \ CSIFall-daily shows similar spatial patterns but with\nrelatively lower values\
    \ in the tropical forest, due to the per-\nsistent cloud coverage. For the annual\
    \ average SIF, tropical\nforests exceed temperate cropland and show very high\
    \ val-\nues for instantaneous clear-sky SIF. In all conditions, African\ntropical\
    \ forests exhibit lower values than Amazonian and\nSoutheast Asian tropical forests.\n\
    We further investigated the seasonal and interannual vari-\nations of the all-sky\
    \ daily SIF across the latitudes. The tropi-\ncal regions show continuous high\
    \ SIF values across seasons,\nand the northern mid- to high-latitude regions also\
    \ exhibit\nrecurrent high values during the Northern Hemisphere sum-\nmers (Fig.\
    \ 7a). Near 40◦ S, a hot spot is present in austral\nsummer, with high interannual\
    \ variability. Low SIF values\ncan be found in dry years (2006–2007, 2009–2010),\
    \ while\nhigh values were observed in wet or normal years (2010–\n2011, 2012–2015).\
    \ The global average SIF also displays a\nstrong seasonality coinciding with the\
    \ Northern Hemisphere\ngrowing season (Fig. 7b). For the annual total SIF values,\
    \ a\nstatistically signiﬁcant increasing trend (Mann–Kendall test,\np<0.0001)\
    \ is found with around 0.39 % increase per year.\nThe year 2015 exhibited a low\
    \ anomaly after detrending,\nwhich may be caused by the El Niño events (Fig. 7c).\n\
    The spatial pattern of the trend in CSIFall-daily is displayed\nin Fig. 8. An\
    \ increasing trend dominates Europe, southeast\nAsia and south Amazon. A decreasing\
    \ trend is mostly found\nin east Brazil, east Africa and some areas of inland\
    \ Eurasia.\nThe histogram also shows a positive shift with a magnitude\n(0.00027\
    \ mW nm−1 sr−1 yr−1) similar to the average global\ntrend in Fig. 7c. The spatial\
    \ pattern of CSIFall-daily is very\nsimilar to the trend pattern of MODIS enhanced\
    \ vegetation\nindex (EVI) (C6) (Zhang et al., 2017b), but the south Brazil-\n\

    \ between CSIF and RSIF or\nCSIF and SIF∗ is consistent across most regions across\
    \ the\nglobe (Fig. 9). The R2 values are generally high (> 0.8) for\nmost regions\
    \ except over tropical rainforests, barren regions\nin western US, northwestern\
    \ China, and northern Canada\nand Russia. The low R2 values are mostly due to\
    \ the rela-\ntively low variability in the temporal domain in the tropics\nbut\
    \ are also indicative of regions strongly polluted by cloud\ncover in which CSIF\
    \ might have a competitive advantage,\nas the training OCO-2 data better observe\
    \ the surface due to\nsmaller footprint and with higher signal-to-noise ratio.\
    \ The\nregression slopes are higher for regions with persistent cloud\ncover (e.g.,\
    \ tropical forest). In the time series comparison\n(Fig. 9e–p), all three SIF\
    \ datasets show similar seasonal pat-\nterns, while GOME-2-based RSIF and SIF∗\
    \ generally show\nhigher values than CSIF. In addition, RSIF exhibits larger\n\
    ﬂuctuation during the non-growing season for some sites,\nwhich may be caused\
    \ by snow contamination.\nWe further compared the CSIFall-daily with GOME-2 daily\n\
    average SIF (Fig. 10). In general, the correlation is much\nlower as compared\
    \ with RSIF for most regions. For regions\nwith high variability in temporal domain,\
    \ the CSIFall-daily still\nshows high R2 values with respect to GOME-2 SIF. The\
    \ re-\ngression slopes exhibit smaller variation except for the Ama-\nzonian tropical\
    \ rainforests, southeast Asia and barren regions\nin the Sahara, western US, northwestern\
    \ China, central Aus-\ntralia and the Andes mountains in South America. In gen-\n\
    eral, considering the various uncertainties and different satel-\nlite overpass\
    \ times, sensors used and retrieval algorithms,\nCSIFall-daily well captured the\
    \ GOME-2 SIF variations both\nin space and time. In addition, since GOME-2 SIF\
    \ in most\nArgentina is affected by the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA),\nthe coefﬁcient\
    \ of determination values are also lower as com-\npared with Fig. 9.\n3.4\nUsing\
    \ CSIF for drought monitoring\nSince the CSIF dataset only uses broadband reﬂectances,\
    \ it\nshould not contain the SIFyield information. Compared to\nthe SIF retrieved\
    \ from OCO-2, the difference can be mostly\nattributed to the SIFyield. Therefore,\
    \ the difference or ratio\nbetween SIFOCO-2 and CSIF can reﬂect the environmental\n\
    stress on SIFyield. Figure 11 shows the difference between\ninstantaneous clear-day\
    \ OCO-2 SIF and CSIFclear-inst. Ex-\ncept for Fig. 11c, the difference mostly\
    \ captures the phys-\niological limitation of drought on energy partitioning after\n\
    being absorbed by chlorophyll. The spatial extent of drought\nis also well-captured\
    \ by the difference, where the most se-\nvere drought-impacted places also exhibited\
    \ the largest de-\ncline (e.g., Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe in Fig. 11a, north-\n\
    east Amazon in Fig.11b and southern Spain, southernmost\nFrance, central Italy,\
    \ Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina).\nThe drought impact on California is less\
    \ pronounced, pos-\nsibly because of the irrigation systems and sparse sampling\n\
    points.\nWe further focused on the 2015 European drought to com-\npare the drought\
    \ response of CSIF and two vegetation indices\n(NDVI and EVI). Because the OCO-2\
    \ samples were not col-\nlected at the same swath for each DOY, a large ﬂuctuation\n\
    can be found in OCO-2 SIF and on the CSIF (which are using\nthe same pixels for\
    \ a fair comparison) (Fig. 12a–d). However,\nwhen calculating the ratio between\
    \ CSIF and OCO-2 SIF, its\nvariation can be mostly attributed to the variation\
    \ in SIFyield,\nwhich can quantify the drought stress on plant physiology.\nIn\
    \ all three regions, the ratio between OCO-2 SIF and CSIF\nexperienced a decrease\
    \ during the drought period, but the\nsignal is only obvious after applying a\
    \ smoothing ﬁlter. The\ntwo vegetation indices, NDVI and EVI, on the other hand,\n\
    show a reduced response in Spain and Italy, perhaps due to\nthe plants’ adaption\
    \ or very short drought duration.\nBiogeosciences, 15, 5779–5800, 2018\nwww.biogeosciences.net/15/5779/2018/\n\

    \ found using CSIFsite or CSIFclear-daily.\n4\nDiscussion\n4.1\nInformation in\
    \ contiguous SIF produced by\nmachine learning\nVegetation photosynthetic activity\
    \ has variations in several\nrespects controlled by vegetation type, phenology,\
    \ coverage\nand interactions with the environment. These variations can\nbe expressed\
    \ in the spatial, seasonal, diurnal and/or interan-\nnual domains (Zhang et al.,\
    \ 2018a). Machine learning algo-\nrithms try to minimize the differences between\
    \ the predicted\nSIF and the satellite-observed SIF. For OCO-2 SIF and the\nMODIS\
    \ reﬂectance used for NN training, the variance in the\nspatial and seasonal domains\
    \ is largest. Therefore, the NN\ngenerally predicts SIF well in these two domains.\
    \ The inter-\nannual variations (i.e., the variations caused by year-to-year\n\
    anomalies, e.g., due to drought) typically have much smaller\nvariance and are\
    \ more difﬁcult to capture. This is why some\nmachine learning products fail to\
    \ reproduce interannual vari-\nability accurately (Jung et al., 2011). Using additional\
    \ vari-\nables that are sensitive to this interannual anomaly in the\nmodel training\
    \ can improve the model performance (Alemo-\nhammad et al., 2017; Gentine and\
    \ Alemohammad, 2018b;\nTramontana et al., 2016).\nIn this study, since the variations\
    \ in SIFyield are relatively\nsmall (Lee et al., 2015) and cannot be detected\
    \ by broadband\nsurface reﬂectances, the SIFyield information may not be re-\n\
    produced by our CSIF data. Because the environmental lim-\nitation on SIFyield\
    \ may be complicated (may not be a linear\ncombination of temperature, vapor pressure\
    \ deﬁcit (VPD) or\nsurface reﬂectance in the shortwave infrared) and biome spe-\n\
    ciﬁc (van der Tol et al., 2014), inclusion of other environmen-\ntal variables\
    \ and reﬂectances in shortwave bands during NN\ntraining did not greatly increase\
    \ the SIF prediction accuracy.\nIt should also be noted that SIFyield is relatively\
    \ stable when\nno strong environmental limitation is present (Zhang et al.,\n\
    2018c). Therefore, the CSIF product should be considered as\na good proxy of OCO-2\
    \ SIF.\nThe satellite-retrieved SIF has a relatively large uncer-\ntainty for\
    \ each individual sounding, typically ranging be-\ntween 0.3 and 0.5 mW m−2 nm−1\
    \ sr−1 (Frankenberg et al.,\n2014). Previous site-level studies usually use SIF\
    \ averaged\nover a large buffered area (Li et al., 2018a; Verma et al.,\n2017)\
    \ to reduce the uncertainty. Assuming the uncertainty\nis unbiased and has a Gaussian\
    \ distribution, machine learn-\ning algorithms are designed to reproduce SIF with\
    \ lower un-\ncertainty. Compared with previous studies that use light-use\nefﬁciency\
    \ models to downscale SIF to higher resolution (Du-\nveiller and Cescatti, 2016),\
    \ this study does not rely on multi-\nple modeled input (evapotranspiration, for\
    \ example) that may\nintroduce additional uncertainties.\nWe also found a signiﬁcant\
    \ increasing trend (0.39 % yr−1)\nin the global annual CSIFall-daily (Fig. 7).\
    \ This trend is\nclose to the GPP trend derived from the satellite-data-driven\n\
    vegetation\nphotosynthesis\nmodel\n(VPM)\n(0.32 % yr−1)\n(Zhang et al., 2017a)\
    \ but much greater than GPP de-\nrived\nfrom\nother\nremote\nsensing\ndata-driven\n\
    models\n– FLUXCOM (0.01 % yr−1; Tramontana et al., 2016),\nBESS GPP (0.22 % yr−1;\
    \ Jiang and Ryu, 2016), MODIS\nC6 (0.26 % yr−1; Zhao et al., 2005) and WECANN\n\
    (−0.8 % yr−1, affected by the decreasing GOME-2 SIF\ntrend; Zhang et al., 2018b;\
    \ Alemohammad et al., 2017). Con-\nsidering there is no signiﬁcant trend (−0.02\
    \ % yr−1, p>0.1)\nin BESS PAR (Ryu et al., 2018), this increase is likely caused\n\
    by the greening of the Earth (Zhang et al., 2017b; Zhu et al.,\n2016) as captured\
    \ in the MODIS reﬂectance data. This in-\ncreasing trend is also within the range\
    \ of most Earth system\nmodels’ predictions (Anav et al., 2015). We also observed\n\
    a more pronounced increasing trend in the southern Ama-\nzon than when using MODIS\
    \ EVI (Zhang et al., 2017b).\nThis may suggest that CSIF is less likely to suffer\
    \ from high\nbiomass saturation than optical vegetation indices and can\nmore\
    \ effectively detect changes in tropical rainforests or over\nhigh leaf area regions\
    \ such as croplands.\nBiogeosciences, 15, 5779–5800, 2018\nwww.biogeosciences.net/15/5779/2018/\n\

    \ SIF for drought monitoring\nDrought can be categorized into different stages.\
    \ At an early\nstage, when plants sense water deﬁcit in the soil and higher\n\
    vapor pressure deﬁcit in the atmosphere, they reduce water\nloss through stomatal\
    \ closure. This, in turn, also reduces the\nCO2 exchange from stomatal closure\
    \ and inhibits photosyn-\nthesis. The quantum yield for heat dissipation will\
    \ increase\naccompanied by a decrease in quantum yield for photochem-\nical quenching\
    \ and ﬂuorescence (Genty et al., 1989; Porcar-\nCastell et al., 2014). This should\
    \ allow satellites to poten-\ntially capture this decrease in the SIF signal (especially\
    \ dur-\ning the mid-afternoon when stress is more pronounced) as an\nindicator\
    \ of vegetation stress. In the second stage, with pro-\nlonged dry conditions,\
    \ plants will recycle the nitrogen in the\nleaves as represented by a decrease\
    \ of the greenness (chloro-\nphyll content) of leaves. In the third stage, if\
    \ the drought con-\ntinues, leaf senescence and vegetation mortality may follow.\n\
    SIF can potentially detect changes during all those drought\nstages, whereas broadband\
    \ reﬂectance-based indices (NDVI,\nEVI) should only see the second and third stages.\n\
    Previous drought monitoring studies have mostly used\nvegetation indices (VIs)\
    \ as a indictor of drought stress (Ji and\nPeters, 2003; Zhang et al., 2013).\
    \ However, vegetation in-\ndices can only respond to drought changes in the plants’\
    \ op-\ntical properties (mostly during the second and third stages).\nFor most\
    \ plants, there might be a tipping point where plants\nwill not recover from drought-induced\
    \ xylem cavitation (Urli\net al., 2013). Since most VIs (e.g., NDVI, EVI) are\
    \ most\nsensitive to the canopy changes, drought monitoring based\non VIs may\
    \ not be useful for drought mitigation and agri-\ncultural irrigation management.\
    \ SIF retrievals from satellite,\ncompared to optical reﬂectance signals, carry\
    \ the information\nnot only about the PAR absorption by chlorophyll but also\n\
    about the drought stress on plant physiology. Although previ-\nous studies used\
    \ satellite-based SIF datasets for post-drought\nimpact assessment (Lee et al.,\
    \ 2013; Yoshida et al., 2015;\nSun et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016), these studies\
    \ did not\nseparate the contribution of decreased APARchl or deceased\nSIFyield.\
    \ A more recent study compared the SIF and VIs in\nIndia during heat stress (Song\
    \ et al., 2018) and found that\nSIF is more sensitive to heat stress than VIs.\
    \ Similarly, since\nNDVI and EVI cannot well capture the change in chloro-\nphyll\
    \ concentration, heat stress on APARchl and SIFyield can-\nnot be fully separated.\
    \ This study developed a new method\nto compare the difference between SIF signals\
    \ and the re-\nﬂectances, which can be applied for early drought warning\nat global\
    \ scale. Although daily OCO-2 data have large gaps\nbetween swaths, combining\
    \ several days of observation can\nprovide enough spatial coverage considering\
    \ the spatial ex-\ntent for most drought events. The spatial coverage issues\n\
    could be further improved using geostatistical-based meth-\nods (Tadi´c et al.,\
    \ 2017), but this may need further investiga-\ntion. Compared to other meteorological\
    \ drought indices, this\ndrought monitoring technique uses only near real-time\
    \ data\nand avoids the interannual anomalies caused by other fac-\ntors (land\
    \ cover change, crop rotation, etc.). The MCD43C4\ndataset uses 16 days of inputs\
    \ for the model inversion, and al-\nthough this may lead to temporal inconsistencies\
    \ for the com-\nparison between CSIF and OCO-2 SIF, it may have limited\neffect\
    \ due to the higher data quality during drought because\nof the reduced cloud\
    \ coverage.\nwww.biogeosciences.net/15/5779/2018/\nBiogeosciences, 15, 5779–5800,\

    \ GPP–CSIF\nrelationship\nIn contrast to Sun et al. (2017), we found a large variation\n\
    of GPP–CSIF relationship across sites. Compared to previ-\nous studies, our study\
    \ gave higher aGPP/CSIF estimates, prob-\nably due to a much higher aGPP/CSIF\
    \ value for evergreen\nneedleleaf forest (10 out of 40 sites are ENF) (Table S1\
    \ in\nthe Supplement) and slight underestimation of CSIFall-daily\ndataset. This\
    \ higher aGPP/CSIF value for ENF was also sug-\ngested by the comparison between\
    \ OCO-2 SIF and FLUX-\nCOM GPP dataset (Sun et al., 2018) and other comparisons\n\
    using GOSAT SIF (Guanter et al., 2012). Consistent with\nLi et al. (2018b), we\
    \ also found small cross-biome variation\nof the GPP–SIF relationship. However,\
    \ a large within-biome\nvariation of aGPP/CSIF is also found, which contributes\
    \ to a\nlarge proportion of the observed cross-site variations rather\nthan the\
    \ cross-biome variation. Compared to studies that use\nOCO-SIF within a large\
    \ buffering area (e.g., 40 km diameter\ncircle in Verma et al., 2017), we made\
    \ the comparison over a\nmuch smaller area and much higher temporal frequency.\n\
    There are several explanations for the observed site-\nspeciﬁc GPP–SIF relationship.\
    \ (1) Leaf morphology may di-\nrectly affect the reabsorption and scattering of\
    \ SIF that leaves\nthe foliage (Atherton et al., 2017); however, this factor is\
    \ not\nconsidered in current SIF modeling (van der Tol et al., 2009;\nVerrelst\
    \ et al., 2015) and will directly affect the model sim-\nulation of the GPP–SIF\
    \ relationship at the ecosystem scale\n(Verrelst et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016c).\
    \ (2) Vegetation\ncanopy characteristics also affect the reabsorption and scat-\n\

    \ canopy (Romero et al., 2018;\nYang and van der Tol, 2018). (3) Atmospheric condition\
    \ may\nattenuate and bias satellite SIF retrievals to some extent, but\nthis effect\
    \ is assumed to be small unless thick clouds are\npresent (Frankenberg and Berry,\
    \ 2017). (4) SIF and GPP\nlikely have different sensitivities to environmental\
    \ stresses\n(Flexas et al., 2002); therefore, ecosystems with frequent en-\nvironmental\
    \ stresses (e.g., drought) during the growing sea-\nson tend to have relatively\
    \ lower GPP-to-SIF ratio. (5) Since\nlight saturations have less effect on SIF\
    \ than GPP (Damm et\nal., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016c), the growing-season averaged\n\
    light intensity (affected by latitude, average cloud coverage),\nvegetation canopy\
    \ structure and leaf characteristics that re-\nlate to the light saturation will\
    \ also affect GPP–SIF rela-\ntionship. For example, the evergreen needleleaf forests\
    \ have\nmuch higher speciﬁc leaf area and usually lower Sun zenith\nangle, making\
    \ them less prone to light saturation. These fac-\ntors may vary not only across\
    \ biomes but also across sites.\nTherefore, within one biome type, the GPP–SIF\
    \ relationship\ncan also be different.\nwww.biogeosciences.net/15/5779/2018/\n\
    Biogeosciences, 15, 5779–5800, 2018\n5794\nY. Zhang et al.: A global spatially\
    \ contiguous solar-induced ﬂuorescence dataset\nIt is also noteworthy that clear-sky\
    \ daily SIF exhibited\nstronger correlation with GPP (Fig. 13); a possible explana-\n\
    tion would be that the light-use efﬁciency increases with dif-\nfused radiation,\
    \ which partly compensates for the decrease\nin incoming PAR when clouds are present\
    \ (Gu et al., 2002;\nTurner et al., 2006). Because the satellite SIF retrieval\
    \ al-\ngorithm discarded observations that were affected by thick\nclouds (Sun\
    \ et al., 2018), the SIF retrievals from OCO-2\nare more positively biased than\
    \ the actual SIF emission of\nthe plants. However, during periods when thick clouds\
    \ are\npresent, the LUE also increases and so does the GPP / SIF\nratio. The positive\
    \ SIF retrieval biases compensated the in-\ncrease in the GPP / SIF ratio and\
    \ therefore contributed to\na stronger correlation between satellite-retrieved\
    \ SIF (rather\nthan the actual SIF emission) and GPP.\n4.4\nUncertainties and\
    \ caveats\nAlthough our CSIFclear-inst showed good performance as sup-\nported\
    \ by the comparison with the clear-sky instantaneous\nSIF retrievals from OCO-2,\
    \ the CSIFall-daily exhibits a slight\nunderestimation. A possible explanation\
    \ is that most SIF re-\ntrievals during overcast conditions did not pass the quality\n\
    checks, such that OCO-2 SIF are more likely obtained dur-\ning clear-sky conditions.\
    \ This is supported by the fact that if\nwe compare OCO-2 SIF with clear-daily\
    \ SIF, the R2 is even\nhigher (Fig. 6).\nThe canopy structure and sun-sensor geometry\
    \ were not\nexplicitly considered in our modeling and only implicitly\nembedded\
    \ in the machine learning retrieval. Several recent\nstudies suggest that canopy\
    \ structure will affect the PAR ab-\nsorption and re-absorption of SIF before\
    \ leaving the canopy\n(fesc in Eq. 3) (Knyazikhin et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2016;\
    \ Yang\nand van der Tol, 2018) and further affect the GPP–SIF rela-\ntionship\
    \ (He et al., 2017; Migliavacca et al., 2017; Zhang et\nal., 2016c). However,\
    \ most of these studies made assump-\ntions requiring either a dense canopy or\
    \ non-reﬂecting soil\nand thus cannot be easily applied at the global scale. In\
    \ ad-\ndition, OCO-2 SIF data used in this study are from nadir ob-\nservations,\
    \ while both the MODIS and GOME-2 sensors ac-\nquire images both at nadir and\
    \ near nadir. Such discrepancy\nin observation angles may induce bidirectional\
    \ effects. Since\nCSIF is trained based on the satellite-observed SIF instead\n\
    of the canopy SIF emission, and as previously discussed, it\ndid not consider\
    \ the atmospheric attenuation of SIF signal in\nthe presence of clouds. The CSIF\
    \ values are expected to be\ncloser to the canopy SIF emission than the satellite-observed\n\
    SIF at the top of atmosphere.\nThe BESS PAR 4-day dataset has high overall accuracy\n\
    (RRMSE of 15.2 %) and very little bias (1.4 %). For differ-\nent climate zones,\
    \ the uncertainties are typically under 20 %.\nThese uncertainties do not affect\
    \ the CSIFclear-inst data but\nwill propagate to CSIFall-daily.\n5\nConclusions\n\
    In this study, using the surface reﬂectance from the MODIS\ninstrument and a NN\
    \ algorithm, we developed two spa-\ntially contiguous and high-temporal-resolution\
    \ SIF datasets\n(CSIF). These two SIF products not only show high accuracy\nwhen\
    \ validated against the satellite-retrieved OCO-2 SIF but\nalso exhibit reasonably\
    \ high consistency with both recon-\nstructed and satellite-retrieved GOME-2 SIF.\
    \ CSIFall-daily ex-\nhibits an increasing trend globally during 2001–2016, which\n\
    is attributed to the Earth greening and not to changes in PAR.\nSince the CSIF\
    \ dataset includes most information on PAR ab-\nsorption of chlorophyll, the difference\
    \ between OCO-2 SIF\nand CSIF mostly contains the information on physiological\n\
    stress on ﬂuorescence yield. This indicator is found to be\nmore effective for\
    \ early drought warning than vegetation in-\ndices. By comparing CSIFall-daily\
    \ with GPP estimates across\n40 EC ﬂux tower sites, the GPP–SIF relationship is\
    \ found\nto vary across sites, and a large proportion of this comes\nfrom within-biome\
    \ variation. However, this ﬁnding still re-\nquires further examination using\
    \ SIF from both new satel-\nlites instruments (e.g., TROPOMI) and ground-based\
    \ mea-\nsurements. The high-resolution CSIF dataset can be further\nused for regional\
    \ to global carbon and water ﬂux analysis.\nCode availability. The code used to\
    \ generate the CSIF dataset is\navailable at https://github.com/zhangyaonju/ (Zhang\

    Figures Versions Notes Abstract Measurement of plant characteristics is still
    the primary bottleneck in both plant breeding and crop management. Rapid and accurate
    acquisition of information about large plant populations is critical for monitoring
    plant health and dissecting the underlying genetic traits. In recent years, high-throughput
    phenotyping technology has benefitted immensely from both remote sensing and machine
    learning. Simultaneous use of multiple sensors (e.g., high-resolution RGB, multispectral,
    hyperspectral, chlorophyll fluorescence, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR))
    allows a range of spatial and spectral resolutions depending on the trait in question.
    Meanwhile, computer vision and machine learning methodology have emerged as powerful
    tools for extracting useful biological information from image data. Together,
    these tools allow the evaluation of various morphological, structural, biophysical,
    and biochemical traits. In this review, we focus on the recent development of
    phenomics approaches in strawberry farming, particularly those utilizing remote
    sensing and machine learning, with an eye toward future prospects for strawberries
    in precision agriculture. The research discussed is broadly categorized according
    to strawberry traits related to (1) fruit/flower detection, fruit maturity, fruit
    quality, internal fruit attributes, fruit shape, and yield prediction; (2) leaf
    and canopy attributes; (3) water stress; and (4) pest and disease detection. Finally,
    we present a synthesis of the potential research opportunities and directions
    that could further promote the use of remote sensing and machine learning in strawberry
    farming. Keywords: artificial intelligence; Fragaria; machine learning; phenomics;
    phenotyping; plant breeding; precision agriculture Graphical Abstract 1. Introduction
    According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)’s Future of Food and
    Agriculture: Alternative Pathways to 2050 report, the global population will reach
    almost 10 billion in 2050 [1], which mandates a continued increase in crop production.
    Meanwhile, agriculture is under increasing resource constraints within the context
    of climate change, with decreasing water and land resources. Precision agriculture
    is an important approach to help meet this goal of a continuous increase in crop
    production. Precision agriculture is an operation and management system supported
    by information technology that makes targeted measurements of plant growth, plant
    health, soil conditions, and other factors [2,3]. Through the integration of the
    Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), Geographic Information System (GIS),
    and remote sensing technologies, precision agriculture can help achieve a number
    of specific goals, such as (1) conduction of farmland surveys; (2) site-specific
    precision application of fertilizers, pesticides, and irrigation management schemes;
    and (3) fine-scale monitoring of crop status, soil moisture, diseases, and pests
    [2]. Implementing informed and science-based decision-making protocols can increase
    profits and productivity, environmental sustainability, crop quality, and ultimately
    food security [4]. Recently, applications of precision agriculture have gradually
    spread throughout the world as the adoption of auto-guidance systems, yield monitoring
    technology, and variable rate technology (VRT) in agriculture has increased in
    both developed and developing countries over the past 20 years [5]. Another important
    application of precision agriculture is in plant phenotyping, particularly within
    the context of breeding and genetic research. Phenotyping is broadly defined as
    the acquisition and evaluation of complex plant traits, such as geometric structure,
    abiotic stress tolerance, disease resistance, yield, and other physiological and
    biochemical characteristics. The measurement of economically important traits
    is essential to plant breeding [6]. With the combination of remote sensing, computer
    vision, and robotics, high-throughput plant phenotyping platforms have been developed.
    These systems usually use multiple sensors to measure various traits, such as
    color, texture, plant height, area, volume, degree of wilting, fresh weight, number
    of flowers/fruits, and quality of fruits [7]. This information enables scientists
    to establish a connection between genotype and phenotype, thus allowing them to
    select resilient varieties with high yield potential in the target environment.
    Of course, the same technologies and similar approaches are also valuable for
    crop management, specifically determination of nutrient needs, water, and pesticide
    requirements, as well as the detection of weeds, pathogens, and pests [8]. At
    present, plant phenotyping is the primary bottleneck in both plant breeding and
    crop management. Connecting phenotype to genotype in a set of target environments
    is the basic goal [9]. Next-generation advances in DNA sequencing technology and
    genome assembly methodology have dramatically increased the throughput and lowered
    the cost of genotyping. However, connecting this mountain of genomic information
    to the expression of traits is still a knotty problem [10]. The greatest challenge
    at present is to rapidly acquire large-scale plant phenotyping data with high
    dimensionality, density, and accuracy from single molecules to entire organisms.
    While new phenomics technology has significantly relieved some bottlenecks, many
    questions remain on how to efficiently define and extract complex traits as well
    as improve accuracy and throughput [11]. New advances in remote sensing and machine
    learning have the capacity to solve many of these problems. Strawberry (Fragaria
    × ananassa) is a very popular fruit among consumers by virtue of its appealing
    appearance, flavor, and health benefits [12]. The latest statistics from the FAO
    show that the world’s strawberry yield and cultivated area from 1961 to 2018 grew
    at annual rates of about 1.82% and 2.44%, respectively (Figure 1). A large portion
    of the research conducted during this period focused on the medical benefits of
    strawberries to human health [6]. The high-value market for strawberries has significantly
    promoted the breeding of new varieties worldwide, including in Europe, Asia, and
    North America [13], which is now driving the need for high-throughput phenotyping
    techniques. Accurate and rapid acquisition of heritable traits of interest is
    critical to improving the strawberry breeding selection accuracy. Remote sensing
    and machine learning can greatly relieve the heavy burden of manual work for strawberry
    phenotyping, such as plant height measurement and fruit quality evaluation. How
    to effectively improve accuracy and throughput is a hot research theme. On the
    other hand, strawberry is a highly perishable and labor-intensive crop that can
    benefit greatly from precision agriculture approaches. The fruits have many developmental
    stages and when ripe are very sensitive to environmental and management conditions.
    Plant development and fruit production can continually cycle and change over a
    6-month period, depending on the growing region. Therefore, real-time and intelligent
    monitoring of plant health and development as well as fruit quality assessment
    is essential for crop management and strategy formulation. The combination of
    remote sensing and machine learning is considered to have huge potential and a
    broad application space in these areas. Figure 1. Global trends in strawberry
    yield and harvested area from 1961 to 2018 [14]. In this manuscript, we reviewed
    the use of remote sensing and machine learning in agricultural applications, especially
    focusing on the latest advances in strawberry phenotyping and management. The
    manuscript also presented a synthesis of potential research opportunities and
    directions that could further support strawberry farming. A rigorous two-step
    approach was adopted to search and screen the literature related to remote sensing
    and machine learning applications, with an emphasis on strawberry. Details of
    the adopted approach and the number of articles on each topic are shown in Appendix
    A and Figure A1, respectively. 2. Remote Sensing Platforms and Sensors Remote
    sensing technology has developed rapidly in recent years, with sensors providing
    higher spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution images. Remotely sensed data
    are acquired by mounting sensors on multiple platforms, including satellites,
    unmanned aerial vehicles (drones), and ground-based vehicles. The unparalleled
    advantage of satellite observation lies in its large area of coverage, which allows
    for collecting various types of datasets, routinely on a global scale. A summary
    of agricultural data sources by Huang et al. [15] presented 28 optical and synthetic
    aperture radar (SAR) satellites for plant vegetation studies, with spatial resolutions
    varying from 0.3 m to 1 km. Research on the agriculture-related applications of
    satellite sensors focuses on several aspects, including crop type classification
    [16], soil property determination [17,18,19], crop mapping and spatial statistics
    [20], crop yield forecasting and canopy parameter estimation [21], and irrigation/drought
    evaluation [19,22]. For example, Sentinel-2 remote sensing imagery was used to
    retrieve various biophysical parameters of winter wheat, including the leaf area
    index, leaf chlorophyll content, and canopy chlorophyll content, utilizing vegetation
    indices and radiative transfer modeling [23]. A combination of two indices, enhanced
    vegetation index (EVI) and vegetation optical depth (VOD), derived from optical
    (MODIS) and microwave (Soil Moisture Active Passive Satellite, SMAP) remote sensors,
    respectively, was used to make a prediction of the corn, soybean, and wheat yield
    on the county scale, with an accuracy of over 76% [24]. In contrast to satellites,
    unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, can carry low-cost sensors and can
    operate on a flexible on-demand schedule. Due to higher spatial resolution, low
    cost, and high maneuverability, drones have become one of the most widely used
    remote sensing platforms in agriculture. Yang et al. [7] investigated the current
    progress and future prospects of UAVs as a remote sensing platform by reviewing
    96 articles. Radoglou-Grammatikis et al. [25] further made a comprehensive survey
    of UAV applications in precision agriculture. Currently, non-destructive crop
    monitoring and smart spraying are two of the primary UAV applications. Moreover,
    the integration of UAVs, wireless sensor networks (WSNs), and the Internet of
    Things (IoT) and the maturity of 5th-generation (5G) technology can make several
    applications such as pesticide application, irrigation, crop monitoring, and soil
    property analysis more precise, timely, and efficient [26,27,28,29]. Compared
    with satellites and drones, ground-based platforms enable close-range detection
    of plant characteristics and generally serve as ground truth information sources
    for sensor calibration and data quality control. Ground-based platforms can be
    categorized into sensors mounted on fixed platforms, such as towers or booms (fixed
    scanning systems); handheld field measuring instruments; and sensors mounted on
    mobile ground vehicles [30,31]. Currently, the main sensors used in remote sensing
    agricultural applications consist of passive multispectral, hyperspectral, visible
    RGB (VIS), and near-infrared (NIR) sensors, fluorescence spectroscopy and imaging
    sensors, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), and synthetic aperture radar (SAR)
    [32]. High-resolution RGB images are widely used in vegetation classification;
    identification of plant leaves, canopy, and fruits; and estimation of geometric
    attributes. Multispectral and hyperspectral imaging provides spectral information
    about various parameters related to physiological and biochemical attributes,
    such as the leaf area index (LAI), crop water content, leaf/canopy chlorophyll
    content, and nitrogen content [7,33]. These parameters are very useful for crop
    growth evaluation and yield prediction. Fluorescence remote sensing is efficient
    in retrieving the chlorophyll and nitrogen content, nitrogen-to-carbon ratio,
    and LAI [34]. LiDAR has the advantage of a high point-cloud density, which is
    useful for obtaining horizontal and vertical structural characteristics of plants
    [35]. A synthetic aperture radar can function in very low visibility weather conditions
    (e.g., cloud cover). It has been extensively explored in crop classification,
    crop growth monitoring, and soil moisture monitoring [36,37,38]. Specific uses
    of different sensor types in different agricultural applications are elaborated
    by Yang et al. [7]. Strawberry is different from most agronomic crops like corn,
    soybeans, and wheat in various aspects. It is clonally propagated, and a single
    plant is relatively small in size but has a complex growth habit that includes
    several parts such as the crown, leaves, runners, inflorescences, and fleshy fruits.
    Higher-spatial-resolution imagery is needed to reveal the canopy structure and
    identify the fruits. Handheld sensors as well as sensors mounted on UAVs and ground-based
    platforms have been used to study various strawberry phenotyping traits. Some
    commonly used UAV types for agriculture applications are elaborated by Radoglou-Grammatikis
    et al. [25]. Ground-based platforms (e.g., tractors) were used to collect high-quality
    images and generate a 3D point cloud for strawberry plants [39]. Handheld non-imaging
    spectrometers that cover a wide spectral range (350–2500 nm) and provide continuous
    spectral reflectance could be used to study strawberry physiological characteristics
    [40]. Additionally, many researchers designed various types of phenotyping platforms
    for strawberry disease detection and fruit quality evaluation. Multispectral or
    hyperspectral sensors mounted on various platforms have been used for specific
    purposes, such as powdery mildew disease detection, fruit grading, and fruit 3D
    construction [41]. Some platforms and topics discussed in this review are shown
    in Figure 2. Figure 2. Strawberry traits can be assessed using a variety of sensors
    mounted on multiple platforms. 3. Machine and Deep Learning Analysis Methods Machine
    learning (ML) is one of the most effective ways to process and analyze the vast
    amounts of data obtained by today’s remote sensing techniques. In general, machine
    learning used in the agricultural field can be grouped into four categories: (1)
    crop monitoring, including yield estimation, disease and weed detection, species
    recognition, and crop quality assessment; (2) livestock management, such as animal
    welfare and livestock production; (3) water regulation, for example, plant evapotranspiration
    estimation; and (4) soil management, including the identification and prediction
    of soil temperature and moisture content [42]. Traditional machine learning methods,
    such as support vector machines (SVMs), artificial neural networks (ANNs), and
    random forests (RFs), require the extraction of key features from image or LiDAR
    datasets that sufficiently represent the characteristics of the studied objects
    or phenomena [43,44]. The quality of selected features is critical to the classification
    or prediction performance [45]. However, finding the best feature subset can be
    a time-consuming and subjective process, especially for highly dimensional datasets
    and in problems with a complex domain (e.g., crop yield estimation) [46]. For
    example, Sabanci et al. [47] extracted 12 features of wheat grains from high-resolution
    RGB images, including grain dimension (length, width, perimeter, and area), spectral
    band (red, green, and blue), and texture (contrast, correlation, energy, homogeny,
    and entropy) information. These features were imported into an ANN model to classify
    the wheat into two types, bread and durum, with an accuracy higher than 97%. Deep
    learning (DL) has emerged as perhaps the most important branch of machine learning.
    Deep learning refers to the extension of ANNs to accommodate neural networks with
    a relatively large number of layers that enable hierarchical data representation
    [48,49]. Mainstream deep learning models at present include deep neural networks
    (DNNs) [50,51], recurrent/recursive neural networks (RNNs) for sequence or time
    data processing [52], convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image analysis
    [53,54], deep generative models [55], and auto-encoder networks [56]. In contrast
    to conventional ML algorithms, DL models can achieve optimal discrimination features
    by determining a set of parameters during the training process; thus a specific
    step for feature extraction is not required [49,57]. The main disadvantages of
    DL methods are the need for massive training datasets, computing capacity, and
    training time [58]. Improving existing DL methods and creating novel algorithms
    have been the goals of numerous studies involving agricultural applications. Kamilaris
    et al. [59] reviewed the agricultural problems solved using DL, common DL models
    and frameworks, data sources and corresponding preprocessing procedures, and the
    overall performance of DL by summarizing 40 studies. They identified land cover
    classification, crop type estimation, crop phenology, fruit and weed detection,
    and fruit grading as the current main applications of DL in the agriculture field.
    DL may also have significant potential in seed identification, soil and leaf nitrogen
    content determination, and irrigation management. In addition, they identified
    the potential for long short-term memory (LSTM) or other RNN models in yield prediction,
    disease management, and water needs assessment based on consecutive observations.
    Overall, deep learning has experienced remarkable developmental progress and already
    has a number of operational applications in agriculture. 4. Fruit Traits 4.1.
    Fruit/Flower Detection Automated counting of fruits and flowers from images is
    a critical step in autonomous robotic harvesting and yield prediction [60]. In
    recent years, numerous studies have been conducted on this topic, mainly aimed
    at developing new image-based object detection and localization algorithms to
    improve recognition accuracy. Traditional image segmentation methods use morphological
    operations to generate binary images and separate fruits from the background according
    to the similarity of color, spatial texture, and geometric shape. For example,
    Feng et al. [61] introduced a strawberry stem detection and fruit classification
    workflow, which used the OHTA color space to segment the fruit from black-and-white
    plastic sheets, extracted the principal inertia axis feature to define the stem
    position, made a judgment of strawberry ripeness based on the hue intensity and
    saturation (HIS) color space, and then selectively harvested strawberry fruits
    according to fruit ripeness and shape. However, this segmentation method is not
    yet robust and stable enough for application in commercial settings that have
    variable lighting conditions, observation angles, object orientations, relative
    positions, and various clustering and occlusion situations. Recently, CNNs have
    evolved to be the most powerful approach for solving target identification and
    classification problems. The superiority of a CNN in image recognition lies in
    its ability to extract increasingly complex visual concepts and features through
    hierarchical structures. The first few layers can be used to learn simple local
    features, and the deeper hidden layers can capture more complicated semantic information,
    such as shape and texture. Koirala et al. [47] reviewed the use of deep learning
    in fruit detection and yield prediction. The author elaborated on the applications
    of current state-of-the-art DL frameworks in target recognition, including the
    faster regional convolutional neural network (Faster RCNN), single-shot multibox
    detector (SSD), and you only look once (YOLO), and in detectors, including the
    Oxford Visual Geometry Group network (VGGNet), the Residual Network (ResNet),
    and the Zeiler and Fergus network (ZFNet). Fruit weight and yield estimation were
    also discussed, which demonstrates the superiority of deep learning in analyzing
    multi-dimensional remote sensing data. With regard to strawberry flower/fruit
    counting, Lin et al. [62] applied RCNN, Fast RCNN, and Faster RCNN models for
    the identification of strawberry flowers from the image, with an accuracy of 63.4%,
    76.7%, and 86.1%, respectively. The Faster RCNN framework demonstrated good performance
    even if strawberry flowers were occluded by foliage, under shadow, and overlapped
    by other flowers. Another DL framework (SSD) was implemented by Lamb et al. [63]
    for strawberry detection. The authors modified the training images and network
    structure to optimize the detection precision and execution speed. This system
    with a sparse CNN can run quickly on mobile low-power hardware with an average
    precision of 84.2%. Yu et al. [64] further adapted a Mask-RCNN model for mature
    strawberry detection in the RGB image and achieved an accuracy of 95.78% even
    in a non-structural environment, particularly for overlapping and hidden fruits
    and those under varying illumination. Zhou et al. [65] proposed a robust deep
    learning architecture named improved Faster-RCNN, which adopted a transfer training
    technology based on Faster RCNN and greatly reduced the number of strawberry images
    required for training the network. The average fruit extraction accuracy was more
    than 86%. 4.2. Fruit Maturity/Ripeness During strawberry ripening, the fruit surface
    color typically goes through green, white, pink, and red stages, concurrent with
    the accelerated biosynthesis of pigments (e.g., carotenoids and anthocyanins)
    over a period of up to 30 days. Fruit ripening is a complicated process, with
    a variety of internal physical and chemical changes, which is mainly controlled
    by the synthesis and action of hormones [66]. Azodanlou et al. [67] found that
    as the fruit matures, there is an increase in volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
    and sugars, as well as a decrease in acidity. Meanwhile, structural changes in
    cell wall polysaccharides, especially the dissolution of pectin, contributes to
    fruit softening. The state of ripeness at harvest directly determines fruit quality
    and shelf life. Unripe fruits have lower nutrient values but are more resistant
    to physical injury. Overripe fruits are more susceptible to the external environment
    and fungal infection [68]. Rahman et al. [69] found that the shelf life of strawberry
    fruits picked at the 1/3rd maturity stage and the full maturity stage were about
    7.8 and 2.4 days, respectively, regardless of the genotype. Therefore, early evaluation
    of fruit ripeness and the determination of optimal harvest time are crucial to
    reducing waste in the supply chain and improving fruit quality [70]. Traditional
    strawberry ripeness assessment is implemented visually and subjectively based
    on the appearance, aroma, color distribution and intensity, as well as texture
    [71,72]. Standard maturity evaluation methods are quantitative, measuring the
    contents of internal quality attributes, such as firmness, soluble solids content
    (SSC), titratable acidity (TA), and total anthocyanins [73]. However, this technique
    is destructive, slow and requires expensive specialized devices and expertise
    [74]. Researchers have spent considerable efforts developing simple, non-invasive,
    and high-throughput ways to estimate the ripeness stage of strawberry fruits.
    Most of the studies have focused on extracting spatial and spectral information
    from representative wavelength bands (usually R, G, and NIR bands) to discriminate
    between strawberries at different growth stages. Raut et al. [75] proposed a direct
    color-mapping method to evaluate the redness of strawberries based on RGB images
    and sort them into pre-mature, mature, and over-mature classes. Jiang et al. [76]
    selected the wavelengths 535, 675, and 980 nm and introduced eight spectral indices
    to automatically identify immature, nearly mature, and mature strawberries using
    the Fisher linear discriminant (FLD) model, with a prediction accuracy over 95%.
    Guo et al. [77] combined spectral reflectance and textural indicators (correlation,
    contrast, entropy, and homogeneity) of 11 optimal wavelengths from hyperspectral
    images and used the SVM algorithm to classify ripe, mid-ripe, and unripe fruits,
    with an accuracy higher than 85%. Yue et al. [78] assessed strawberry maturity
    in the greenhouse using only a smart phone equipped with 535 and 670 nm optical
    filters, which were chosen to capture anthocyanin and chlorophyll contents, respectively.
    Absorptance data for the two wavelengths served as variables in three regression
    classification methods (multivariate linear, multivariate nonlinear, and SoftMax
    regression). The multivariate nonlinear model yielded an identification accuracy
    of over 94%. Gao et al. [79] further used the AlexNet CNN deep learning model
    to categorize the strawberry fruits into ripe and early-ripe stages using hyperspectral
    datasets, achieving 98.6% classification accuracy. Recently, data collection processes,
    feature extraction and classification algorithms have been integrated into a real-time
    strawberry ripeness evaluation and decision-making system developed for harvesting
    robots [80]. 4.3. Fruit Quality and Postharvest Monitoring Postharvest operations,
    including sorting, grading, and spoilage stage monitoring, are of great significance
    for price determination, fulfillment of orders with specific quality standards,
    and sales strategy formulation [81]. In terms of strawberry grading, manual selection
    is widely based on the shape, size, color, maturity, and imperfection of the fruits
    [82]. Compared with apples and citrus fruits, strawberries are more vulnerable
    to damage due to their high moisture content, lack of exocarp protection, and
    susceptibility to fungal infection [12]. From the moment of harvest, strawberry
    fruits begin to lose nutrition and generally spoil after three days without cold
    storage, potentially generating toxins harmful to human health [83]. Therefore,
    it is helpful to have a rapid and non-invasive inspection method for postharvest
    strawberry monitoring. As with ripeness evaluation, emerging computer vision and
    machine learning technologies have enabled the development of automatic, real-time,
    and non-destructive fruit-grading systems. Liming et al. [84] designed an intelligent
    strawberry-grading system by integrating conveyer belts, cameras, and other auxiliary
    devices and employing multi-attribute decision-making theory to grade the strawberry
    fruit into three or four classes based on color, shape (13 feature parameters),
    and size. The final accuracy was above 90%. Mahendra et al. [85] compared seven
    types of features and used the SVM classifier to categorize the fruits into two
    groups: good and damaged. They found that the speeded-up robust features (SURF)
    were most effective in classification, with an accuracy of 90.73%. Sustika et
    al. [81] evaluated the capability of six CNN architectures (the baseline CNN,
    AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGGNet, Xception, and MobileNet) for the binary classification
    (good or bad) of strawberry fruit and its classification into four grading levels
    (1–4 ranking) using RGB images. The study indicated that VGGNet’s performance
    was the best, producing 96.49% and 89.12% accuracy for the binary and the four-grade-level
    classification, respectively. Péneau et al. [86] represented the consumer perception
    of freshness quantitatively by establishing the relationship between the fruit’s
    physiochemical parameters (appearance, odor, texture, and flavor) and consumer/expert
    ratings of freshness. Dong et al. [87] used long-path Fourier-transform infrared
    spectroscopy (FTIR) technology to capture the spectral characteristics of VOCs
    generated after different lengths of storage and then detect changes in VOC (esters,
    alcohols, ethylene, etc.) abundance. A principal component analysis (PCA) was
    implemented on the spectral data to distinguish fresh, slightly spoiled, and spoiled
    strawberries. As for storage time estimation, Weng et al. [12] collected the spectral
    data for strawberries from 0 to 60 h of storage with an interval of 6 h, using
    hyperspectral imaging technology. SVMs and RFs were then used to classify strawberry
    samples from different storage times with an accuracy of 100%. Partial least-squares
    regression (PLSR) [88] analysis has also been used to estimate the storage time
    with a prediction accuracy approaching 100%. 4.4. Internal Fruit Attributes As
    discussed in the previous section, fruit quality is broadly assessed by many parameters
    associated with the external attributes of the fruit, including appearance, texture,
    and flavor. However, the determination of internal fruit attributes (sugar content,
    juiciness, acidity, color, etc.) is also very important. NIR spectroscopy and
    multiple/hyperspectral imaging technology have been effective for evaluating internal
    fruit quality attributes in a non-contact manner. A difference between spectroscopy
    and imaging is that the former can only obtain single-point information, while
    the latter can provide spatial distribution. The VIS/NIR spectral range is usually
    selected for internal fruit attribute studies because it provides information
    about O–H, C–H, and N–H absorptions [89]. Spectroscopy and hyperspectral image
    data are highly redundant and require preprocessing and analysis. Most research
    on the retrieval of internal fruit attributes adopts the following steps: data
    pretreatment (spectral correction and noise reduction), optimal sensitive wavelength
    selection, feature extraction, and prediction model construction. ElMasry et al.
    [90] estimated the moisture content (MC), SSC, and pH of strawberry fruits using
    hyperspectral images. Optimal wavelengths were selected for the MC, SSC, and pH,
    using β-coefficients from partial least-squares models. Multiple linear regression
    (MLR) models were then applied to retrieve fruit quality attributes using the
    spectral data of optimal wavelengths, with prediction accuracies of 87%, 80%,
    and 92% for the MC, TSS, and pH, respectively. Unlike many researchers who only
    used the spectral information directly as input variables, Weng et al. [91] extracted
    the spectral information about optimal wavelengths, 9 color features obtained
    from color histograms and moments, and 36 textural features simultaneously from
    the hyperspectral images for the detection of soluble solid content (SSC), pH,
    and vitamin C. Spectral and color features achieved the best prediction for SSC,
    with an R2 coefficient of 0.94. In terms of pH, optimal prediction was obtained
    using spectral features only, with an R2 of 0.85. A combination of spectral and
    textural features helped improve the estimation of vitamin C, with an R2 of 0.88.
    At present, the main parameters retrieved for the internal fruit quality of strawberry
    include firmness; vitamin C (VC); phenolic compounds; TA; total water-soluble
    sugar (TWSS) content; concentrations of glucose, fructose, and sucrose; SSC; pH;
    MC; and VC. A detailed summary of the acquisition of these parameters using spectroscopy
    and imaging technology is shown in Table 1. Table 1. Summary of articles addressing
    the estimation of internal fruit quality attributes of strawberry based on remote
    sensing and machine learning. 4.5. Fruit Shape Fruit shape is a critical parameter
    affecting the esthetic appearance and marketability of strawberries. Basic shape
    descriptors, such as length, width, and aspect ratio, can be manually measured
    with, for example, a vernier caliper. However, this method is not only labor intensive
    and time consuming but also limited in capturing the complex and multi-dimensional
    aspects of shape and uniformity. Currently, most shape classification studies
    are based on 2D digital images. Ishikawa et al. [103] extracted four types of
    shape descriptors from RGB images taken by a digital camera: (1) measured values,
    including contour line length, fruit length and width, and fruit width/length
    ratio; (2) ellipse similarity (ES) index, including the optimum ellipse area ratio
    and the boundary length ratio, which indicate the ellipse similarity of fruits;
    (3) elliptic Fourier descriptors (EFDs); and (4) chain code subtraction (CCS).
    Random forest analysis was conducted to categorize strawberry fruit shape into
    nine types: reniform, conical, cordate, ovoid, cylindrical, rhomboid, obloid,
    globose, and wedged. The recall ratio was used for accuracy evaluation since Kappa
    coefficients were not able to classify more than three types. The recall ratio
    ranged from 0.52 to 1, depending on shape type. Oo and Aung [104] proposed a simpler
    but efficient method for strawberry size estimation and shape classification based
    on RGB images. Only three parameters (diameter, length, and apex angle) were imported
    into a three-layer neural network for four classes. The estimation accuracy of
    diameter and length was 94% and 93%, respectively, for strawberries without calyx
    occlusion and 94% and 89% for those with calyx occlusion. The classification was
    between 94% and 97%. Feldmann et al. [105] further extracted 68 strawberry fruit
    shape features of four types (linear and geometric descriptors, outline-based
    descriptors, landmark-based descriptors, and binary-image-pixel-based descriptors)
    from digital images and introduced a method called principal progression of k
    clusters (PPKC), which can automatically discover potential shape classes. Relationships
    between four shape categories and features were built and used for the classification.
    The accuracy varied from 68% to 99%. Zhou et al. [65] used the length-to-width
    ratio of the minimum external rectangle obtained from RGB images to assess the
    plumpness of strawberry fruits. Strawberries were classified into three types
    based on this ratio: plump (0–0.5), approximately plump (0.5–0.8), and fully plump
    (0.8–1). However, this approach applies only for strawberries of globose type.
    Although 2D images can only reflect one dimension or plane characteristics, they
    are sufficient to determine shape properties to some extent. Today, imaging technology
    can obtain three-dimensional information. A 3D-shape-measuring system equipped
    with cameras, a rotation table, and an operation system was designed by He et
    al. [106], which generated 3D point clouds of strawberry fruits using photos from
    various angles and heights using structure from motion (SfM) methods. The errors
    were less than 0.6 mm for 90% and 0.3 mm for 80% or more of the strawberry fruits
    [107]. Construction of 3D strawberry architecture can provide information beyond
    basic descriptors. For example, uniformity is a key shape factor that is directly
    tied to fruit quality and sales volume. Li et al. [108] defined eight uniformity
    variables calculated from the 3D architecture of the strawberry fruit and evaluated
    the importance of each variable for manual uniformity assessment. The results
    showed that circularity of the maximum circumference had the closest predictive
    relationship with the manual uniformity score. A regular shape genetic locus was
    detected and found to be related to three uniformity parameters. 4.6. Strawberry
    Yield Prediction Strawberry harvesting can extend for many months depending on
    the growing system and environment, with dramatic variation in weekly yields.
    Forecasting strawberry yield ahead of time can help growers formulate labor/equipment
    allocation strategies during the harvesting period. Since weather fluctuation
    is a key factor, many studies have been conducted on how weather parameters (e.g.,
    solar radiation, wind, temperature) influence strawberry yield [109]. These significant
    influential factors were combined with other yield-associated traits as input
    for statistical models and machine learning methods to predict strawberry yield.
    For example, Misaghi et al. [110] applied three neural network models (multilayer
    perception (MLP), generalized feedforward neural network (GFNN), and modular neural
    network) for strawberry yield prediction using vegetation indices (normalized
    difference vegetation index (NDVI) and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI))
    and soil characteristic parameters, with up to 94% final accuracy. MacKenzie and
    Chandler [111] built a relational expression between flower counts, temperature
    data, and strawberry total weight, with a coefficient of determination of 0.84.
    Various meteorological parameters (e.g., net radiation, vapor pressure, relative
    humidity) were examined by Pathak et al. [109] for strawberry yield forecast using
    a principal component regression model, achieving 70% yield prediction accuracy.
    Hassan et al. [112] used hyperspectral remote sensing imagery to obtain LAI parameters
    and six vegetation indices (VIs) to explore the relationship between these parameters
    and yield under different growing conditions (organic and conventional). The prediction
    accuracy (R2) was higher than 0.7 except in the treatment using the black plastic
    mulch conventional system (<0.6). The result also showed that six VIs worked better
    than LAI as yield estimators. Maskey et al. [113] utilized predictive principal
    component regression (PPCR), neural network (NN), and random forest (RF) models
    to forecast strawberry yield using 26 parameters related to leaf and canopy properties,
    soil characteristics, and weather conditions. Each of the selected weather parameters
    was highly correlated with strawberry yield, and the neural network (NN) analysis
    provided the best prediction accuracy (95%). Nevertheless, these prediction models
    were generally spatially confined and need to be validated in field experiments.
    Another method for strawberry yield forecasting is to count fruit numbers and
    determine size and maturity using remote sensing images. Deep learning can play
    a crucial role in accomplishing this task. Using the Faster RCNN model, Chen et
    al. [114] predicted strawberry yield by identifying and counting strawberry flowers
    and immature and mature fruits from UAV high-resolution images obtained at two
    heights (2 m and 3 m). The results showed that the mean average precision was
    higher at 2 m (83%) than at 3 m (72%). 5. Leaf and Canopy Traits Leaf and canopy
    traits are generally divided into two types: architectural and biophysical/biochemical
    characteristics. Architectural traits refer to external geometric morphology,
    such as leaf length and width; leaf area; leaf inclination angle; leaf azimuth;
    and canopy height, width, size, and shape. These parameters affect the penetration
    of light through the canopy, light utility efficiency (LUE), and, ultimately,
    photosynthesis efficiency. Biophysical/biochemical parameters describe internal
    physiological characteristics of leaves and are highly associated with crop growth
    dynamics, nutritional status, and photosynthetic capacity. These parameters include
    the green area index (GAI), green fraction (GF), above-ground biomass (AGBM),
    LAI, leaf/canopy water content, leaf/canopy chlorophyll content, leaf/canopy nitrogen
    content, and leaf/canopy temperature, etc. At present, SfM analysis and LiDAR
    are two methods used to generate 3D point-cloud data and obtain 3D structural
    properties of leaves and canopies with desirable accuracy. SfM is a computer vision
    technique that aims to recover the three-dimensional geometry of objects by analyzing
    overlapping images taken from different perspectives [115]. The workflow involves
    several steps: (1) Image feature extraction and matching is performed, where matching
    algorithms are used to detect conjugate features or tie points between overlapped
    images. (2) Camera location and orientation estimation is done using the conjugate
    features in the images. A bundle-block adjustment process is then implemented
    to estimate the position and orientation of each camera at the exposure moment.
    (3) Orthoimage and 3D point-cloud production [116] is then conducted using more
    dense conjugate points detected through image matching. The point cloud can be
    rasterized to produce a digital surface model, which is used to generate ortho-rectified
    image mosaics. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is an active remote sensing
    method that utilizes laser to generate 3D point-cloud datasets [35]. Most LiDAR
    systems send laser pulses and compute the distance between the LiDAR source and
    the point where the LiDAR pulse hits an object (e.g., plant leaf) using the laser
    pulse travel time. Other navigation sensors are then used with the measured distance
    to compute the 3D location of the point. Dense 3D points can be created this way
    to accurately depict the surveyed objects. One of the major differences between
    LiDAR- and SfM-based datasets is the significantly higher cost associated with
    LiDAR measurements. LiDAR, however, is capable of producing 3D points along the
    LiDAR laser path, which can reveal some under-canopy information. Both methods
    have been widely used to extract height, size, and shape of various crop plants,
    such as blueberry, maize, and soybean [117,118,119]. Two main approaches have
    been commonly used to retrieve biophysical characteristics and related parameters:
    statistical modeling and radiative transfer modeling (RTM). The former aims to
    establish the relationship between features obtained from remote sensing and field
    measurements using traditional statistical modeling (e.g., regression analysis)
    and machine learning methods. Commonly used image features include spectral (e.g.,
    band values and vegetation indices) and textural information. More than a hundred
    VIs could be calculated using different light spectra combinations extracted from
    UAV hyperspectral imagery, supplying abundant information about vegetation vigor
    and health [120]. It is worth noting that the red edge region, which is defined
    as the wavelength position of the inflection point on the red-NIR reflectance
    slope, has raised wide interest among researchers for LAI and chlorophyll content
    estimation [121]. As an alternative to statistical modeling, RTM considers the
    physical process of interactions between the vegetation canopy and solar radiation.
    Through the simulation of canopy reflectance, canopy parameters can be retrieved
    by RTM as long as other input parameters (radiation intensity, observation angle,
    soil conditions, etc.) are known [122,123]. Kattenborn et al. [124] revealed how
    canopy reflectance is linked with functional traits using the PROSAIL radiative
    transfer model (combination of PROSPECT leaf optical properties model and SAIL
    canopy bidirectional reflectance model). Recently, several scholars have compared
    and combined these two approaches to implement leaf/canopy property retrieval
    [81,124,125]. Studies on phenotyping of strawberry leaves and canopies using remote
    sensing techniques are relatively rare. Luisa et al. [126] investigated the relationship
    between 11 spectral response indices and nitrogen (N) content of young, mature,
    and old leaves. The results showed that only green reflectance (550 nm) was responsive
    to N fertilization for individual leaves. At the canopy level, green reflectance
    (550 nm), red reflectance (680 nm), VI, and NDVI were highly correlated with N
    content, with an R2 of 0.5, 0.6, 0.56, and 0.56, respectively. Sandino et al.
    [127] adopted a basic computer vision method to estimate strawberry leaf coverage
    from RGB images with an accuracy of 90%. Procedures such as smoothing, dilatation,
    contour detection, threshold segmentation, and edge detection operations were
    used. Similarly, a more complex algorithm was introduced by Jianlun et al. [128]
    to segment the greenhouse strawberry leaf edge from the background noise in the
    images, which integrated the scale space wavelet transformation, canny edge detection,
    Otsu threshold segmentation, and morphological analysis approaches. Guan et al.
    [129] extracted planimetric canopy area, canopy surface area, canopy average height,
    standard deviation of canopy height, canopy volume, and canopy smoothness parameters
    from high-spatial-resolution RGB images (~0.5 mm) through SfM, object-based image
    analysis (OBIA), and GIS analysis. Three of the variables were used to predict
    the leaf area (R2 = 0.79) and dry biomass (R2 = 0.84) throughout the strawberry-growing
    season using multiple linear regression analysis. Abd-Elrahman et al. [130] built
    on this study by developing automated canopy delineation and canopy size metric
    extraction models to predict strawberry biomass at greater throughput. Takahashi
    et al. [131] applied Kinect (the depth sensor used in the Microsoft XBOX console)
    to detect plant height and leaf area receiving direct sunlight at different leaf
    layers over time under different environments. These parameters were compared
    to the yield, dry weight, and nitrogen content inside the leaf. Kokin et al. [132]
    used a thermal camera to examine the difference between the strawberry leaf surface
    temperature and ambient air temperature under night frost conditions, which reached
    a maximum of ~8 °C. 6. Abiotic/Biotic Stress Detection 6.1. Water Stress Water
    deficit stress refers to the inhibition effect on plant growth caused by soil
    water deficiency or high evaporation requirement in a low-humidity atmosphere.
    The detection of the plant response to water stress is critical to irrigation
    management. Current irrigation practices are generally based on indirect estimation
    of plant water demand or evaporation calculated from soil moisture content and
    meteorological data [133,134]. Gutiérrez et al. [135] developed an automated irrigation
    system equipped with a distributed wireless network of soil moisture and temperature
    sensors placed in the root zone of the plants. Through irrigation control based
    on soil moisture and temperature threshold values, 90% saving was achieved in
    water consumption compared to traditional irrigation practices. Morillo et al.
    [136] implemented precision drip irrigation for strawberries using crop water
    requirement estimates and optimum irrigation pulse design. The method incorporated
    soil water content and crop evapotranspiration data obtained from a local meteorological
    station. In contrast, monitoring physiological changes in plants due to water
    stress provides a more direct and intuitive way to assess water demand. Under
    water stress, a plant’s temperature increases due to stomatal closure and reduced
    transpiration. Severe water scarcity can lead to wilting and loss of key pigments
    such as chlorophyll, which cause irreversible damage to the photosynthesis process.
    Multiple remote sensors have been used to detect pre-symptom changes. Commonly
    used sensors for this approach include the thermal imager (TIR; 8–14 µm), VIS,
    NIR, shortwave infrared reflectance (400–2500 nm), and sun-induced fluorescence
    (SIF; 685 and 740 nm). Thermal infrared imaging has demonstrated advantages compared
    to other remote sensing spectral domains in crop water stress detection. Through
    the analysis of information in different spectral ranges, numerous indices sensitive
    to water stress were proposed, such as temperature-based indices (stress degree
    day (SDD), crop water stress index (CWSI), and water deficit index (WDI)) and
    leaf-water-content-related indices (water index (WI), leaf water index (LWI),
    moisture stress index (MSI), and normalized difference water index (NDWI)) [137].
    These indicators can quantitatively reflect the water deficit of leaves or canopy
    to some extent. As for strawberries, drought severely limits plant growth and
    reduces yield and fruit quality. Extensive research has been done to investigate
    responses of strawberries to water stress, including changes in yield and morphological,
    physiological, and biochemical properties. Drought-tolerant cultivars have been
    selected according to their adaptability to limited water supply [138]. Numerous
    parameters related to strawberry growth status, such as leaf area, leaf size,
    leaf longevity, dry mass, number of leaves per plant, leaf expansion rates, leaf
    chlorophyll content, chlorophyll stability index, leaf moisture content, stomatal
    conductance, photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, root development, and plant
    height, exhibit a decreasing tendency under water stress [139,140,141]. Adak et
    al. [142] found that water deficit increased some biochemical features of fruits,
    such as total phenolics, total anthocyanins, antioxidant activity, and sugar content.
    Strawberry fruit weight and yield per unit declined by 59.72% and 63.62%, respectively,
    under water stress as compared to control conditions. It is helpful in crop management
    to provide a real-time, accurate assessment of water demand inside the strawberry
    plant. Peñuelas et al. [143] found that strawberry leaf temperature and the CWSI
    obtained by a handheld infrared thermometer were very useful in evaluating even
    mild water stress. Razavi et al. [144] used chlorophyll fluorescence to identify
    drought stress in strawberries. Delalieux et al. [145] compared plant height,
    NDVI, red edge inflection point (REIP), and pigment-specific simple ratio for
    chlorophyll b (PSSRb) differences between strawberries under two irrigation scenarios
    (20% and 100%) using the COmpact hyperSpectral Imaging (COSI) system. The study
    indicated that the growth inhibition caused by water shortage could be detected
    using these spectral characteristics. Li et al. [146] measured strawberry plant
    temperature, dry surface temperature (Tdry), wet surface temperature (Twet) for
    a single point, and the whole plant area using a TIR sensor. They found the CWSI
    to be significant in detecting strawberry water stress. More indicators were examined
    by Gerhards et al. [147], including surface temperature (TS), CWSI, sun-induced
    fluorescence (F687, F780), and TIR indices, as well as the visible and near infrared
    (VNIR)/short-wave infrared (SWIR), photochemical reflectance index (PRI), normalized
    difference vegetation index (NDVI), and moisture stress index (MSI). These results
    illustrate the great potential of remote sensing in water stress detection. 6.2.
    Pest and Disease Detection Strawberries are susceptible to many insects, mites,
    pests, and microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, and viruses) that regularly cause
    reductions in total and marketable yield [148,149]. Early diagnosis and control
    of strawberry pests and diseases is critical to avoiding yield losses. The occurrence
    of plant diseases is a process of pathological and physiological changes. Internal
    symptoms of diseased crops are eventually reflected as abnormal changes in external
    morphological characters, such as necrosis, rot, and deformity of strawberry roots,
    stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits. Visual identification of pathogen signs and
    plant disease symptoms performed by trained experts is the common practice. Nevertheless,
    this process is post-symptom, and its accuracy depends on the individual’s experience.
    Microscopic methods are not feasible for large-scale commercial detection of pest
    and disease problems [150]. Numerous studies have utilized remote sensing to recognize
    various strawberry diseases, such as powdery mildew, anthracnose crown rot, verticillium
    wilt, and gray mold (Figure 3). Reflectance at various spectral bands contains
    significant information about plant biophysical and biochemical properties, such
    as leaf pigment content (VIS: 400–700 nm), leaf internal structure and water content
    (NIR: 700–1100 nm), and the composition of leaf chemicals and water content (SWIR:
    1100–2500 nm) [139]. Consequently, remote-sensing-based plant disease detection
    methods focus on the optical characteristics of infected and healthy strawberry
    plants in the images acquired by one or more sensors. The majority of the current
    research in this area focuses on differentiating between healthy strawberries
    and those affected by a single disease. Machine learning (particularly deep learning)
    plays an important role in analyzing images for disease detection. For example,
    Park et al. [151] applied a CNN to classify healthy and diseased strawberry using
    RGB images taken by a smart phone, with 89.7% accuracy. Chang et al. [149] extracted
    40 textural indices from high-resolution RGB images and compared the performance
    of three supervised learning classifiers, ANNs, SVMs, and K-nearest neighbors
    (KNNs), in detecting the strawberry powdery mildew disease. The overall classification
    accuracy was 93.8% and 78.80% for the ANN and KNN classifiers, respectively. More
    studies addressing strawberry disease detection are detailed in Table 2. Figure

    Table 2. Summary of recent articles investigating strawberry diseases using remote
    sensing and machine learning. 7. Discussion and Outlook The primary aim of this
    manuscript was to present an overview of how remote sensing and machine learning
    have been used in strawberry phenotyping and management. We reviewed studies that
    have applied state-of-art technological breakthroughs in machine and deep learning
    techniques to detect strawberry fruits and flowers from images with high accuracy.
    This work contributed greatly to autonomous robotic harvesting and yield prediction
    applications. Statistical models and machine learning methods were explored to
    evaluate strawberry fruit ripeness, estimate internal fruit attribute parameters,
    and monitor postharvest fruit quality based on RGB, multispectral, and hyperspectral
    image datasets. Various image-based fruit shape descriptors were suggested, such
    as fruit contour line length, uniformity, and ellipse similarity indexes. Structures
    from motion algorithms were used to generate 3D point clouds of strawberry fruits.
    Canopy and leaf images were analyzed to build models relating the biochemical
    content of leaves and spectral indexes as well as predict biophysical parameters,
    such as dry biomass and leaf area. Additionally, studies related to the detection
    of abiotic and biotic stressors were developed. Table A1 lists a categorized summary
    of the studies reviewed in this manuscript that were not presented in tabular
    form. Although remote sensing data acquisition and machine learning data analysis
    are already advancing the prospects of strawberry precision agriculture and phenomics
    applications, there is still an urgent need for further exploration. For example,
    questions related to how to expand the robustness and transferability of the statistical
    and machine learning models connecting fruit quality to image-based spectral and
    geometrical information are still active research topics. Deep learning is also
    very promising for further advances in fruit quality assessment. A deep learning
    method may enable obtaining multiple fruit quality parameters, such as shape,
    size, color, and internal attributes, simultaneously, which can help build a comprehensive
    evaluation system for strawberries and promote the automation of postharvest grading
    processes. Strawberry yield forecasting can be improved by integrating multiple
    variables such as weather condition, soil parameters, fruit/flower counts, canopy
    metrics, and various spectral indices from hyperspectral images as input. Many
    of these parameters, such as fruit and flower count and canopy size, can be extracted
    directly from the images using deep learning networks, which may effectively increase
    prediction accuracy and reduce manual work of feature extraction. Continuous,
    real-time observations of leaf and canopy phenotyping traits are critical to monitoring
    the growth and nutritional status of the plants. With the advancement of remote
    sensing technology, UAVs and updated ground-based platforms are being used extensively
    in agriculture. Sensors that are expensive and hard to access, like LiDAR and
    hyperspectral cameras, are gradually becoming more affordable. Thus, an increasing
    number of studies are being conducted on using remote sensing and machine learning
    to obtain structural (e.g., leaf width/length, leaf inclination angle, and canopy
    height and width), biophysical (e.g., LAI and biomass), and biochemical (e.g.,
    chlorophyll and nitrogen content) traits of agronomic crops, fruit trees, and
    vegetables. Strawberry fruit shape is mostly depicted and evaluated by features
    extracted from 2D and 3D information facilitated by SfM and LiDAR technologies.
    As those technologies become more ubiquitous, more fruit descriptors and novel
    assessment systems can be developed based on the 3D architecture of strawberries.
    Although SfM methods were applied to high-spatial-resolution RGB images [129,130]
    to calculate several strawberry canopy parameters (e.g., canopy area, average
    height, volume, and smoothness), LiDAR could be used to obtain detailed information
    about a strawberry plant’s structural properties. For example, Jiang et al. [166]
    analyzed LiDAR data and proposed various quantification factors for the bush architecture
    of blueberries, including bush morphology (height, width, and volume), crown size,
    and shape descriptors (path curve λ and five shape indices). This type of research
    can be readily transferred to the strawberry domain. Besides, there is a great
    deal of progress to be made in predicting strawberry biophysical parameters and
    the photosynthesis process, and there is much to learn from other crops. Paul
    et al. [167] applied Gaussian process regression and the SVM model to estimate
    the canopy-averaged chlorophyll content of pear trees based on convolutional auto-encoder
    features of hyperspectral data. Li et al. [168] summarized the development of
    remote sensing imaging technologies for retrieval and analysis of information
    about various nutrition parameters, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium,
    iron, and magnesium. The study showed that a leaf or canopy nutritional distribution
    map can be generated, and the coefficient of determination (R2) of nitrogen even
    reached 0.91. Lu et al. [169] found that the total emitted solar-induced chlorophyll
    fluorescence (SIF) is more effective than top-of-canopy (TOC) SIF in the prediction
    of forest photosynthesis. Dechant et al. [170] further revealed the canopy structure
    is dominant in the relationship between SIF and gross primary production (GPP)
    for rice, wheat, and corn. Studies like these in strawberry are few. Multispectral
    and hyperspectral datasets, radiative transfer modeling, and machine learning
    analysis may be comprehensively applied to study strawberry’s biophysical properties
    and photosynthesis processes. Furthermore, in a general sense, there is still
    room for model and algorithm development and the fusion and application of multiple
    types of remote sensing images. At present, several studies have assessed the
    feasibility of different methods or parameters in the detection of biotic and
    abiotic strawberry stresses, focusing on single stressors at discrete time points.
    These works have tried to distinguish between healthy plants and those with a
    single disease, improving discrimination accuracies where possible, as shown in
    Table 2. For future high-throughput disease detection, there is a need to integrate
    multiple sensors and multiple time points to identify field areas and plants under
    stress automatically and rapidly, diagnose the stressor type and evaluate its
    severity, comprehensively assess plant health through time, and model and predict
    plant responses to management strategies. 8. Conclusions Strawberry is different
    from most agronomic crops like corn, soybean, and wheat in various aspects. It
    is generally grown on raised-bed structures instead of flat ground and is also
    grown in hydroponic systems and under greenhouse and plastic tunnel structures.
    Strawberry is clonally propagated and has a complex growth habit that includes
    several plant parts, such as the crown, leaves, runners, inflorescences, and fleshy
    fruits. The fruits have many developmental stages and when ripe are very sensitive
    to environmental and management conditions. Plant development and fruit production
    can continually cycle and change over a six-month period, depending on the growing
    region. These characteristics make phenotyping considerations complex for strawberry.
    Therefore, the methods developed in major row crops must be creatively adapted
    to strawberry. The development of ground-based devices, UAVs, and emerging field
    robotics is advancing the potential for monitoring strawberry growth throughout
    the entire growing cycle, from planting to final harvest. Remote sensing can provide
    massive amounts of data about crop condition and health via plant and fruit characteristics.
    This deepens our knowledge about the crop itself and allows more advanced management
    practices. Remote sensing may also be useful for postharvest evaluation of strawberry
    fruits. Spectral and textual information obtained from multiple sensors can capture
    both external and internal fruit traits. Further, available artificial intelligence
    options include an expanding array of deep learning techniques and computer vision
    analysis methods. This combination of advances in sensors and data extraction
    and analysis will continue to accelerate the use of precision agriculture in strawberry
    production and phenomics technology in strawberry breeding and genetics. Author

    Appendix A A two-step approach was adopted to search and screen the literature
    related to remote sensing and machine learning applications, with an emphasis
    on strawberry. In the first step, refereed articles about remote sensing, machine
    learning, phenotyping, and strawberries were collected from the IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect,
    Web of Science, and Google Scholar scientific database portals. The following
    query was used, which included the keywords implemented in the search: [“machine
    learning” OR “deep learning” OR “computer vision” OR “remote sensing” OR “phenotyping”
    OR “phenomics”] AND [“strawberry”]. In the second step, we screened a total of
    79 papers resulting from the search, of which 60 dealt with strawberry phenotyping
    and 19 were related to strawberry management during growth and development. The
    number of articles on each topic is shown in Figure A1. Figure A1. Number of articles

  extract_1: 'The research intention of this systematic review on automated systems
    for real-time irrigation management can be interpreted as follows:

    Addressing the global food challenge: The review aims to explore how automated,
    real-time irrigation management systems can contribute to efficient use of water
    resources and enhance agricultural productivity to meet the growing demand for
    food.

    Evaluating the current state and future potential: The primary objective is to
    critically assess the current state of end-to-end automated irrigation management
    systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies. The review also
    seeks to identify gaps and propose solutions for seamless integration across the
    automated irrigation management system to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation
    management.

    Examining automation across the entire pipeline: The review intends to systematically
    analyze the automation of each component of the irrigation management pipeline,
    from data collection and transmission to processing, analysis, decision-making,
    and automated action. It aims to investigate the effectiveness and efficiency
    of integrated end-to-end automated irrigation systems.

    Highlighting the role of interoperability and standardization: The review seeks
    to emphasize the importance of interoperability and standardization in enabling
    the integration of components within automated irrigation management systems.
    It aims to identify existing and emerging standards and their applicability to
    real-time irrigation management systems.

    Identifying challenges and proposing solutions: The review intends to uncover
    the challenges associated with implementing real-time, automated irrigation systems,
    such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security. It aims to propose
    solutions and best practices based on the analysis of case studies and real-world
    implementations.

    Guiding future research and innovation: By identifying research gaps and proposing
    new research questions and hypotheses, the review aims to provide a roadmap for
    advancing the field of real-time, automated irrigation management. It seeks to
    encourage collaborative research efforts across disciplines to address the complex
    challenges of automated irrigation systems.'
  extract_2: This study demonstrates the potential of blending multiple satellite-based
    soil moisture observations to derive a combined product that is more comprehensive
    and robust compared to its source products. The combined products from different
    satellite-based soil moisture datasets demonstrate the possibility of overcoming
    the limitations of individual products in challenging regions. Hence, this work
    contributes to the improvement of the application of satellite-based soil moisture
    in various fields such as NWP, agriculture and forest management, dust outbreaks,
    water resource and irrigation management, and many other surface processes.

    Get rights and content Highlights • SMAP strongly agreed with the temporal dynamics
    of in-situ observations. • All remotely sensed soil moisture products were sound
    over moderately vegetated areas. • Over densely vegetated areas, ASCAT performed
    better than the other products. • The maximized R method was utilized to show
    the importance of individual datasets. • The SMAP-ASCAT combination performed
    better than the other combined products. Abstract Global-scale surface soil moisture
    (SSM) products retrieved from active and passive microwave remote sensing provide
    an effective method for monitoring near-real-time SSM content with nearly daily
    temporal resolution. In the present study, we first inter-compared global-scale
    error patterns and combined the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), Advanced
    Scatterometer (ASCAT), and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) SSM
    products using a triple collocation (TC) analysis and the maximized Pearson correlation
    coefficient (R) method from April 2015 to December 2016. The Global Land Data
    Assimilation System (GLDAS) and global in situ observations were utilized to investigate
    and to compare the quality of satellite-based SSM products. The average R-values
    of SMAP, ASCAT, and AMSR2 were 0.74, 0.64, and 0.65 when they compared with in
    situ networks, respectively. The ubRMSD values were (0.0411, 0.0625, and 0.0708)
    m3 m− 3; and the bias values were (− 0.0460, 0.0010, and 0.0418) m3 m− 3 for SMAP,
    ASCAT, and AMSR2, respectively. The highest average R-values from SMAP against
    the in situ results are very encouraging; only SMAP showed higher R-values than
    GLDAS in several in situ networks with low ubRMSD (0.0438 m3 m− 3). Overall, SMAP
    showed a dry bias (− 0.0460 m3 m− 3) and AMSR2 had a wet bias (0.0418 m3 m− 3);
    while ASCAT showed the least bias (0.0010 m3 m− 3) among all the products. Each
    product was evaluated using TC metrics with respect to the different ranges of
    vegetation optical depth (VOD). Under vegetation scarce conditions (VOD < 0.10),
    such as desert and semi-desert regions, all products have difficulty obtaining
    SSM information. In regions with moderately vegetated areas (0.10 < VOD < 0.40),
    SMAP showed the highest Signal-to-Noise Ratio. Over highly vegetated regions (VOD
    > 0.40) ASCAT showed comparatively better performance than did the other products.
    Using the maximized R method, SMAP, ASCAT, and AMSR2 products were combined one
    by one using the GLDAS dataset for reference SSM values. When the satellite products
    were combined, R-values of the combined products were improved or degraded depending
    on the VOD ranges produced, when compared with the results from the original products
    alone. The results of this study provide an overview of SMAP, ASCAT, and AMSR2
    reliability and the performance of their combined products on a global scale.
    This study is the first to show the advantages of the recently available SMAP
    dataset for effective merging of different satellite products and of their application
    to various hydro-meteorological problems. Previous article in issue Next article

    collocation error estimatorCombining datasets 1. Introduction Several methods
    for reproducing near-surface soil moisture (SSM) estimates from satellite-based
    microwave instruments have been proposed (Wagner et al., 1999, Njoku et al., 2003,
    Entekhabi et al., 2010, Jackson et al., 2010, Kerr et al., 2010). These investigations
    are crucial for understanding the hydrological cycle because SSM plays a key role
    in the partitioning of energy and water fluxes among the hydrosphere, biosphere,
    and atmosphere. In particular, SSM at global and regional scales is required in
    operational applications such as numerical weather prediction (NWP) at different
    time scale, climate and agricultural modeling, water resource and irrigation management,
    dust outbreak prediction, and many other surface processes (Koster et al., 2009,
    Brocca et al., 2010, Bolten et al., 2010, Kim and Choi, 2015, Kim et al., 2017,
    Brocca et al., 2017). Owing to its important role in the climate system, SSM was
    listed as a key variable among the “Essential Climate Variables” (ECVs) in 2010
    (GCOS, 2006). Several satellite missions including the Soil Moisture and Ocean
    Salinity (SMOS) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) have been dedicated to
    measuring global SSM through space-borne remote sensing (Kerr et al., 2001, Entekhabi
    et al., 2010). Specifically, SMAP was recently launched by the National Aeronautics
    and Space Administration (NASA) in January 2015 to monitor SSM and to detect the
    frozen or thawed state of soils. Similarly, many other promising sensors (active
    and passive) capable of acquiring global SSM have been launched. These include
    the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) onboard MetOp-A and B, the Advanced Microwave
    Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) onboard Global Change Observations Mission 1-Water
    (GCOM-W1), and the Microwave Radiation Imager onboard Feng Yun (Albergel et al.,
    2009, Dorigo et al., 2010, Wagner et al., 2013, Parinussa et al., 2015, Cui et
    al., 2016). Although the SSM retrieved from these sensors has a coarse spatial
    resolution (20–50 km), they have a short repeat time (1–3 days) that is suitable
    for many hydro-meteorological applications (Walker and Houser, 2004). In addition
    to improved retrieval of satellite-based SSM-data from space, new land surface
    models and ground measurements are providing useful SSM information about near-surface
    to deeper layers. Ground-based SSM measurements reflect the true value of SSM
    at point scale (Brocca et al., 2007, Famiglietti et al., 1999, Ngunyen et al.,
    2017). Moreover, many previous studies have shown that point-based ground measurements
    can reflect temporal SSM dynamics of the field mean SSM value (Vachaud et al.,
    1985, Wagner et al., 2008, Brocca et al., 2009); therefore, such ground measurements
    are essential for validation and evaluation of both satellite-based and land surface
    model SSM products. In situ datasets have limitations in terms of vertical and
    spatial representation and spatial extent, especially for global-scale data analysis.
    For this reason, modeled SSM products such as those from the Modern-Era Retrospective
    Analysis for Research and Applications-Land (MERRA-Land) and Global Land Data
    Assimilation System (GLDAS), which are based on merged satellite and gauge-based
    datasets, are sometimes used for validation and calibration studies (Brocca et
    al., 2011, Chen et al., 2013, Al-Yaari et al., 2014a, Al-Yaari et al., 2014b).
    Not only satellite-based SSM data but also land surface models are tools that
    provide sufficiently reasonable guidance of SSM and profile SM information worldwide
    over regions where in situ observations are sparse (Lakshmi, 2004, Albergel et
    al., 2012). Understanding the spatio-temporal error characteristics of different
    satellite SSM products is of great importance for operational applications. In
    many previous studies, the consistency of satellite-based SSM products have been
    investigated using reference SSM values, including data from the Advanced Microwave
    Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E), SMOS, ASCAT, and AMSR2. Such studies have
    shown that each product has different error characteristics under different surface
    and environmental conditions (Dorigo et al., 2010, Gruhier et al., 2010, Kim et
    al., 2015a, Konings et al., 2011, Leroux et al., 2014, Wagner et al., 2014, Griesfeller
    et al., 2016, Burgin et al., 2017, Cho et al., 2017). Because each satellite-based
    SSM product has shown different performance depending upon land cover conditions,
    sensor specifications, and SSM retrieval algorithms, the merging of these different
    datasets is regarded as a promising approach by which to establish a level of
    meta-performance superior to what is possible using the individual products (Liu
    et al., 2011, Liu et al., 2012, Kim et al., 2015b). Combining different satellite-based
    SSM products provides a mechanism for overcoming the drawbacks of an individual
    product (Houser et al., 1998, Liu et al., 2012, Wagner et al., 2012, Dorigo et
    al., 2015). To generate a combined SSM product, both passive and active microwave
    SSM datasets have been used. Liu et al. (2012) combined four passive and two active
    microwave products as part of the European Space Agency (ESA) Program on Global
    Monitoring of ECV, which was initiated in 2010 and is known as the Climate Change
    Initiative (CCI; http://www.esa-soilmoisture-cci.org). Starting from 1 November
    1978, the ECV CCI products have provided combined SSM products for long observation
    periods and preserved the relative dynamics of the original satellite-derived
    products (Dorigo et al., 2017). Furthermore, Kim et al. (2015b) introduced a method
    of combining two different parent datasets by maximizing the temporal correlation
    with a reference dataset. If the reference value (e.g., a modeled SSM dataset)
    is assumed to be the highest-quality SSM dataset, the maximized R method is capable
    of improving the temporal correlation coefficient values between the combined
    and reference datasets when two parent products are combined. Because each product
    performs differently under different environmental conditions, complementary aspects
    can be distinctly observed. However, the reference values do not always represent
    the highest-quality dataset, which can lead to deterioration of the parent products.
    Nonetheless, in many cases, the combined dataset shows generally superior results
    compared with individual datasets by showing higher values of temporal correlation
    with ground-based measurements. In the present study, we first inter-compared
    and combined a recently available SMAP dataset with specific versions of ASCAT
    and AMSR2 SSM products using statistical metrics including triple collocation
    analysis and presented the results through the Taylor diagram. As previously mentioned,
    SSM is retrieved using many different algorithms that can show better or worse
    performance over some areas even though the observational system is identical.
    Wagner et al. (2014) clearly showed that different performance rankings of SSM
    datasets (and subsequent conclusions) could be obtained by specific selection
    of processing and interpretation of the datasets. Considering this point, the
    present study compares algorithms and metrics to determine whether a particular
    satellite-based SSM product enables improved quality and performance when combined
    with other datasets. The three main objectives of this study were as follows.
    First, we aimed to assess the global performance of individual SSM products (from
    SMAP, ASCAT, and ASMR2) by comparison with ground-based and model SM datasets
    produced from April 2015 to December 2016. Second, we aimed to investigate global-scale
    error patterns of SMAP, ASCAT, and AMSR2 using triple collocation analysis; with
    performance assessments to consider different land cover classifications and vegetation
    fractions. Third, we aimed to combine SMAP with other satellite-based SSM products
    and evaluate the results to investigate practical applications of the newly available
    SMAP dataset. Regarding the combined SSM product, the SMAP SSM was considered
    a candidate product for combination with others. This research provides novel
    insight into the use of the recently available SMAP SSM dataset in various practical
    applications including satellite-based SSM data merging, assimilation in NWP,
    and hydrological modeling. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Remotely sensed surface
    soil moisture SMAP, ASCAT, and AMSR2 were evaluated against GLDAS and in situ
    SSM datasets, which were assumed to be reference SSM values. Because the SMAP
    dataset was made available in April 2015, the period of analysis was April 2015
    to December 2016. All three satellite-based SSM datasets were projected to the
    WGS84 geographic grid and resampled using the nearest neighbor distance algorithm
    to establish a uniform georeferenced 0.25° grid, which is the same as that used
    in the GLDAS datasets (Rüdiger et al., 2009, Al-Yaari et al., 2014b). In addition,
    the GLDAS datasets were reconstructed from UTC time-based to local time-based
    in order to match the SMAP, ASCAT, and AMSR2 local overpass times. This reconstruction
    was achieved by considering the navigational time zone based on longitude and
    by neglecting local statutory deviations (Fig. S1). Similarly, data from the in
    situ datasets were extracted at a time closest to the local overpass time of each
    satellite product. Because the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) provides
    hourly data, we set a one-hour threshold for the maximum time difference between
    the in situ and satellite overpass time (local time). For instance, we used the
    in situ datasets of 06:00–07:00 A.M. for the half orbit SMAP, 9:00–10:00 P.M.
    for the descending path of ASCAT, and 01:00–02:00 A.M. for the ascending path
    of AMSR2. In order to calculate sound results, the in situ stations for which
    the corresponding pixels had > 100 data points in time were selected for all satellites
    and GLDAS products. 2.1.1. SMAP soil moisture retrievals Successfully launched
    in January 2015, the SMAP mission is the first Earth observation satellite developed
    by NASA in response to the National Research Council''s Earth Science Decadal
    Survey (Entekhabi et al., 2010, Colliander et al., 2017). This mission was designed
    to enhance scientific understanding of the interaction between the Earth''s surface
    and atmosphere to predict natural disasters and improve climate forecasting. The
    main goal of the SMAP mission is to obtain high-accuracy SSM information. The
    accuracy requirements of SMAP mission specify that SSM should be retrieved with
    ubRMSE of 0.04 m3 m− 3 accuracy in low or moderately vegetated areas in order
    to use this data for effective monitoring and prediction of natural hazards such
    as droughts, floods, and dust outbreaks. SMAP carries an L-band radiometer (1.41
    GHz) and rotating reflector radar (1.26 GHz non-imaging SAR), which was designed
    to provide a conical scanning-antenna beam. SMAP has a near-polar sun synchronous
    orbit and overpasses the Equator at approximately 06:00 and 18:00 local time (LT)
    in descending and ascending orbits, respectively. In addition, SMAP was expected
    to provide different SSM resolutions, at 3, 9, and 36 km. However, only the 36
    km and enhanced L3 radiometer 9 km resolution datasets are currently available
    because the radar unit failed to transmit after 7 July 2015. For this reason,
    only a few months of the active/passive combined SSM datasets are available. The
    data from the descending half-orbit has been used as input for SSM retrievals
    because of the equilibrium assumption of early morning thermal conditions for
    hydro-meteorological variables (e.g., air, vegetation, and near-surface soil).
    In this study, we used the 36 km half-orbit descending SMAP Level-3 radiometer-based
    SSM product because it is expected that the descending overpass time of SMAP (06:00
    LT) is closest to thermal equilibrium and uniformity among the SSM conditions
    available at this time (Hornbuckle and England, 2005, Entekhabi et al., 2010,
    Das and Dunbar, 2015). It is this product (SMAP Level-3) that is hereafter referred
    to as SMAP. All radiometer data products from SMAP were obtained from the National
    Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC DAAC, http://nsidc.org/data/smap/). The SMAP dataset
    was masked where soil temperature was below 273.15 K from the GLDAS 0–10 cm layer,
    for SSM lower than 0.02 m3 m− 3 and higher than 0.50 m3 m− 3, and when the flag
    for the freeze/thaw fraction indicated an unfrozen soil and when the retrieval
    quality flag was set as ‘recommended’. The validation grid processing corresponds
    to the SMAP data version R14010. Please refer to O''Neill et al. (2015) for detailed
    description of the algorithm theoretical basis document for the SMAP. 2.1.2. ASCAT
    soil moisture retrievals The ASCAT sensors onboard the Meteorological Operational
    A and B (MetOp-A and MetOp-B) satellites are active microwave remote-sensing instruments
    operated by the European organization for the exploitation of METeorological SATellites
    (EUMETSAT). METOP-A was launched in October 2006. ASCAT acquires radar backscatter
    measurements at a frequency of 5.3 GHz (C-band), has a spatial resolution of 25
    km with a 1–3 day revisit time (Scipal et al., 2008a, Naeimi et al., 2012, Wagner
    et al., 2013). The ASCAT overpasses at 09:30 LT in descending orbit, and at 21:30
    LT in ascending orbit. ASCAT SSM retrievals are distributed by the EUMETSAT''S
    Satellite Application Facility as Support to Operational Hydrology and Water Management
    (H-SAF). The change-detection method was introduced by Wagner et al. (1999) and
    improved by Naeimi et al. (2009). Specifically, the SSM content (ms), or the so-called
    degree of saturation, can be calculated from the basic ASCAT measurement, which
    is the backscattering coefficient (σ°) measured at a reference angle of 40° and
    based on the method of Wagner et al. (1999). For details about the change detection
    algorithm, please refer to Wagner et al. (2013). The porosity values were estimated
    by applying the equations of Saxton and Rawls (2006). The texture characteristics
    were obtained from the Harmonized World Soil Database (FAO/IIASA/ISRIC/ISS-CAS/JRC,
    2009). In this study, we focused on ASCAT SSM products for a 25 km-swath grid
    generated from the EUMETSAT Data Service Centre, which are available for download
    through the EUMETSAT website (https://rs.geo.tuwien.ac.at/products/). The ASCAT
    dataset was masked out to remove grid cells for wetland fractions above 15%, topographic
    complexity above 20%, SSM error above 10%, and soil temperature below the freezing
    point (Draper et al., 2012, Parrens et al., 2012, Paulik et al., 2014). It is
    worth noting that all three products have different flag information for masking
    abnormal SSM datasets; thus, if new flag information is developed in future datasets,
    it would help provide masks for retrieval of higher quality SSM datasets. In addition,
    different ASCAT SSM products, such as the time series products distributed by
    H-SAF (http://www.geo.tuwien.ac.at), may show better quality than the NRT data
    found in the EUMETSAT archive. However, owing to the availability of the dataset,
    we used EUMETSAT NRT products in this study. We considered only the descending
    path of the ASCAT SSM product, hereafter referred to as ASCAT, because it showed
    slightly better statistical metrics when compared with in situ observations (Table
    S1). 2.1.3. AMSR2 soil moisture retrievals The AMSR2 sensor onboard the GCOM-W1
    platform was launched in May 2012 (Kachi et al., 2013). This satellite mission
    is the successor of Aqua AMSR-E, which ceased operation in October 2011. AMSR2
    is a passive microwave remote sensing instrument developed by the Japan Aerospace
    Exploration Agency (JAXA) with the cooperation of NASA. It utilizes microwave
    frequency bands: C1 (6.9 GHz), C2 (7.3 GHz), and X (10.6 GHz), for SSM measurements
    and provides a 1450 km swath-width. It has three different ground resolutions
    that depend on frequency channels (C1-band: 24 × 42 km, C2-band: 34 × 58 km; X-band:
    35 × 62 km) with a revisit time of one to two days (Maeda and Taniguchi, 2013).
    The AMSR2 crosses the equator at 01:30 LT and 13:30 LT in descending and ascending
    orbits, respectively. AMSR2-based SSM products can be derived from two widely
    used algorithms: the JAXA and Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) (Maeda and
    Taniguchi, 2013a, Kim et al., 2015a, Parinussa et al., 2016, van der Schalie et
    al., 2017). Both algorithms utilize a simple radiative transfer model (Mo et al.,
    1982) based on microwave emissions from the land surface, which were measured
    in terms of satellite brightness temperature (Tb). The JAXA algorithm produces
    SSM products in the X-band only, whereas the LPRM products are available in both
    C- and X-band microwave frequencies. Moreover, the LPRM algorithm retrieves the
    vegetation optical depth (VOD) product along with the SSM product from AMSR2 Tb
    measurements using the Microwave Polarization Difference Index (Owe et al., 2001,
    Meesters et al., 2005). VOD is a measure of vegetation water content and aboveground
    vegetation structure, and has been used for estimates of aboveground vegetation
    (Konings and Gentine, 2017). In this study, we used the AMSR2 descending overpass
    VOD to evaluate the different satellite SSM products in terms of vegetation fraction.
    Furthermore, for this study we used the most recently improved LPRM AMSR2 dataset
    (descending path), hereafter referred to as AMSR2. This dataset has shown significantly
    improved ability, relative to existing LPRM algorithms, for capturing the temporal
    variability of SSM when compared with in situ observations (Parinussa et al.,
    2016, van der Schalie et al., 2017). Moreover, in comparison with other satellite-based
    SSM datasets, AMSR2 can provide SSM and VOD retrieval at three different frequencies.
    Therefore, it can minimize the effects of contamination from radio frequency interference
    (RFI), which means that the C1-, C2-, and X-bands can be used for selective SSM
    and VOD retrieval (de Nijs et al., 2015). The C-band frequency is usually expected
    to have higher-quality SSM information than with the X-band because of the deeper
    penetration provided by lower frequencies. Therefore, we used the newly developed
    RFI detection method, the standard error of estimate (SE) proposed by de Nijs
    et al. (2015), to set the lower frequency-based SSM product as a priority product
    for AMSR2 (Fig. S2). We note that care in the use of LPRM AMSR2 products distributed
    by JAXA is encouraged because Cho et al. (2017) found that Version 1 LPRM AMSR2
    C1- and C2-band retrieved SSM showed unusual temporal patterns when compared with
    the modeled and X-band SSM products. The AMSR2 dataset over densely vegetated
    regions was screened using the VOD value and setting an upper threshold of 0.6,
    which was retrieved along with the SSM values (Meesters et al., 2005, Owe et al.,
    2008) (Fig. 1a). Similar to the SMAP and ASCAT dataset preprocessing, when the
    soil temperature was below 273.15 K (freezing point of water), the AMSR2 dataset
    was masked out. Download : Download high-res image (558KB) Download : Download

    from the BATS model based on six VOD ranges. 2.2. GLDAS soil moisture product
    Along with the satellite-based SSM datasets, Global Land Data Assimilation System-1
    (GLDAS-1) Noah, which became available in 2000, also provides numerous atmospheric
    and land surface variables with a temporal resolution of 3 h and a spatial resolution
    of 0.25°. The model is constrained to using heterogeneous forcing datasets including
    National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/GDAS atmospheric analysis,
    the spatially and temporally disaggregated NOAA Climate Prediction Center Merged
    Analysis of Precipitation field, and observation-based radiation fields derived
    from the Air Force Weather Agency''s Agricultural Meteorological modeling system
    (Rodell et al., 2004). GLDAS has been widely used as a reference dataset for merging
    active and passive products (Liu et al., 2011, Kim et al., 2015b). In this study,
    the SSM of the top 10 cm layer from GLDAS-1-Noah, hereafter referred to as GLDAS,
    was utilized as the reference value of SSM when combining satellite-based SSM
    products based on the maximized R method. In addition, it is worth noting that
    some depth mismatch between the satellite-based SSM (top few cm) and the GLDAS
    SSM (10 cm) is certainly expected; however, GLDAS-1 Noah SSM represents 0–10 cm
    depth, which implies that the GLDAS SM contains information about depths shallower
    than 10 cm as well. Moreover, in many previous studies, the top 10 cm SM-dataset
    from land surface models was utilized to validate and improve various satellite-based
    SSM retrievals (Dorigo et al., 2010, Liu et al., 2012, Wagner et al., 2012). GLDAS
    SSM was validated with in situ SSM datasets from the ISMN to verify its reliability,
    as discussed in Section 3.1. 2.3. International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) To
    evaluate the individual remotely sensed SSM products, we used in situ observations
    from the ISMN. ISMN is a web-based data center that collects and organizes in
    situ soil moisture measurements from different operational networks and validation
    campaigns, and freely shares the data with users through a web interface (https://ismn.geo.tuwien.ac.at/;
    accessed on 4. Oct. 2017). The soil moisture data provided by ISMN are crucial
    for validating different satellite-based SSM retrievals and land surface models
    and for studying the climate system (Dorigo et al., 2011, Dorigo et al., 2013,
    Ochsner et al., 2013). The ISMN soil moisture has been widely used in many validation
    studies. Currently, the ISMN holds numerous soil moisture datasets provided by
    > 2000 measurement stations and operated by > 55 different networks (Dorigo et
    al., 2015). In this study, however, we chose only stations measuring SM at a depth
    of 10 cm or less with data covering the study period (April 2015 to December 2016).
    Moreover, to obtain robust statistical results, we masked the stations for which
    the corresponding pixel had < 100 data points in time (for GLDAS and the three
    satellite products). Furthermore, if more than one station was situated in a grid
    pixel, we took an average of all station values. After this preprocessing step,
    the data at 213 sites in eight different monitoring networks remained, most of
    which are located in the United States and Europe (Fig. 2). All datasets were
    quality controlled, and were cross-screened in order to retain only overpass times
    and pixels for which all satellite-based datasets were attainable. A brief description
    of the ISMN used is summarized in Table 1. A detailed description of the ISMN
    used is provided in the Supplementary Data file. Download : Download high-res

    Transfer Model (BATS) is a simple boundary layer scheme first introduced by Dickinson
    (1986). Subsequent improvements in the model have been well documented by Dickinson
    (1984) and Dickinson et al. (1993). The BATS scheme considers three soil layers
    and one vegetation layer for predicting seven variables: canopy temperature, surface
    soil temperature, subsurface soil temperature, surface soil water, root zone soil
    water, total soil water, and canopy water content. The surface cover and soil
    types are based on Wilson and Henderson-Sellers (1985). This scheme was designed
    for incorporation into the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community
    Climate Model; however, its many features have also been used in other land surface
    models (Liang et al., 1994). In this study, land cover classifications from the
    BATS model were used to evaluate the performance of the individual and combined
    SSM products for different land cover types. 2.5. Data preparation Satellite-based
    SSM retrieval from space provides observations of the thin top-layer SSM; however,
    in situ soil moisture sensors are installed at a certain depth below the surface
    and can sense the soil moisture profile. Therefore, a depth discrepancy occurs
    between satellite and in situ sensors that has been noted and widely discussed
    in previous studies (Al-Yaari et al., 2014a, Dorigo et al., 2015, Shellito et
    al., 2016, Zohaib et al., 2017). Simple techniques like the exponential filter
    make it possible to overcome the depth discrepancy between ground measurements
    and satellite SSM products by estimating root-zone soil moisture, as proposed
    by Wagner et al. (1999). In their study, this semi-empirical approach generally
    improved the R-values with respect to in situ measurements. We calculated the
    satellite profile layer soil moisture using an exponential filter developed by
    Wagner et al. (1999) and given by Albergel et al. (2008) in its recursive form
    as follows: (1) where SWIm(n-1) is the profile soil moisture estimate at tn-1,
    and ms(tn) is the SSM estimate at tn. The gain K at a time tn is given by. (2)
    where T represents the characteristic time length in days, which is considered
    a proxy for all processes that affect the temporal dynamics of subsurface soil
    moisture such as layer depth, soil hydraulic properties, evapotranspiration, runoff,
    and vertical heterogeneity of the soil properties (Albergel et al., 2008). In
    previous studies, an optimum T (Topt) value approach was proposed based on the
    Nash-Sutcliffe score, to match the profile soil moisture at each in situ station.
    The exponential filter has been detailed in various studies (Wagner et al., 1999,
    Albergel et al., 2008, Ford et al., 2014). In the present study, we also used
    Topt to match the depth of satellite and in situ soil moisture at each station.
    SWI was only considered when satellite-based SSM datasets were compared with in
    situ observations. 2.6. Statistic metrics used for the comparison and combination
    methodology 2.6.1. Comparison metrics and triple collocation error estimator We
    considered three conventional statistical indicators to evaluate each remotely
    sensed SSM (SSMSAT): the Pearson correlation coefficient (R), bias, and unbiased
    root-mean-square deviation (ubRMSD). These metrics were considered for validation
    of three satellite and model datasets against in situ observations, and for validating
    the combination of three satellite products. We assumed that in situ datasets
    have the highest quality SSM values in order to calculate the unbiased RMSD and
    bias values. In addition, we set the GLDAS datasets as the highest-quality reference
    SSM values for combining two parent products, which is an inevitable assumption
    for combining processes via the maximized R method. All conventional statistical
    metrics were applied only when the number of data points used for calculation
    was larger than 100. The ubRMSD metric was considered to investigate each product''s
    RMSD value after removing a possible bias from ancillary information (e.g., porosity)
    (Albergel et al., 2012, Al-Yaari et al., 2014a, Al-Yaari et al., 2014b). Only
    the R-values at p < 0.05 were considered in the comparison analysis. In order
    to provide global-scale analysis of the satellite-based SSM products, we considered
    triple collocation (TC) statistics. TC analysis enables evaluation of global-scale
    satellite-based SSM products without having additional reference datasets as conventional
    metrics. Through TC analysis, we could calculate the random error variances of
    three collocated datasets. Most recently, Gruber et al. (2016) suggested the use
    of decibel units of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR[dB], Eqs. (3), (4), which is physically
    intuitive and has low sensitivity to estimation uncertainties. In addition, on
    the basis of the SNR value, the fractional mean squared error (fMSE, Eq. (5))
    and linear correlation coefficient (Ri2, Eq. (6)) of the individual datasets could
    be calculated. Details of the TC analysis have been presented in previous research
    (Scipal et al., 2008b, Draper et al., 2013, Su et al., 2014a, Su et al., 2014b,
    Gruber et al., 2016). TC assumes independent errors; therefore, we selected SSM
    products with derivations as different as possible because similarly derived datasets
    might have partially correlated errors. This might happen for AMSR2 and SMAP,
    for example, because they are both radiometers. For these reasons, we repeated
    the TC calculations twice: once with a triplet including SMAP, ASCAT, and GLDAS
    and once with a triplet including AMSR2, ASCAT, and GLDAS. Then we used the ASCAT
    TC statistics from the SMAP triplet because ASCAT is more dissimilar in frequency
    to SMAP than AMSR2. However, the error estimates for each product were consistent
    when using the two different triplets, we expect that this process did not impact
    the final results discussed later. Aside from the value of error variance, the
    SNR metric enables objective comparison of the error metric among various satellite
    SSM products (Gruber et al., 2016) because the individual SSMSAT has a subjective
    scaling of the range of SSM variation. (3) where the subscript 1 and 2 denotes
    two independent satellite dataset, cov is the covariance of the two independent
    satellites dataset or a satellite and GLDAS dataset, and var. is variance of the
    SAT1 error. By taking SNR with the decadic logarithm, the SNR was distributed
    symmetrically around zero, which gave easier and clearer insight into the value
    of SNR interpretation. (4) Every positive or negative 3 dB interval of SNR[dB]
    indicates an additional doubling or halving of the ratio of two different SNR[dB]
    values. The fMSE for dataset i can be calculated using Eq. (5) and is inversely
    related to the SNR value (Draper et al., 2013). (5) The scale of fMSE is between
    ‘0’ and ‘1’. A lower/higher fMSE indicates a clearer/noisier signal of the SSM
    value. Thus, when the fMSE is ‘0’, its SSM observation does not include noise.
    Here, an fMSE of ‘1’ means there is only noise in its SSM observation. If the
    fMSE value is lower than 0.5, its SSM observation signal is stronger than its
    noise. The Ri2 value can be calculated from following equation: (6) The Ri2 is
    different with conventional R-values in terms of its independency (McColl et al.,
    2014). Ri2 does not require a reference dataset as a conventional R value, which
    can degrade the value of R owing to random errors in the reference dataset. Details
    of the TC statistics described above are presented in Gruber et al. (2016). In
    addition, because Ri2 does not provide a more distinctive perspective than SNR[dB],
    we focused on the SNR and fMSE results. 2.6.2. Taylor diagrams A Taylor diagram
    can represent multiple statistics for comparison of different SSMSAT against the
    SSMREF (e.g., in situ) data on two-dimensional plots. Normalized standard deviation
    (SDV) indicates the ratio between the SSMSAT and in situ measurement standard
    deviations. In the Taylor diagram, the SDV values are shown as radial distance,
    R-values (Eq. (5)) with in situ data are shown as an angle in the polar plot,
    and the in situ observation is shown as a point on the x-axis at R = 1 and SDV
    = 1. The centered RMSD (E) between SSMSAT and the in situ dataset, which was normalized
    using the in situ standard deviations, is the distance to this point. E quantifies
    errors in the pattern variations, whereas SDV provides the relative amplitude
    and does not include information on bias (Albergel et al., 2012). SDV and E are
    computed using Eqs. (7), (8), respectively. (7) (8) The E value can be calculated
    from SDV and R (Eq. (9)) because they are complementary but not independent (Taylor,
    2001). (9) 2.6.3. Maximized R method for combining soil moisture datasets One
    of the main goals of this research was to determine whether the SMAP product contributes
    to better performance of the combined datasets when it is considered as a candidate
    for combining with multiple SSM products. Combinations of SMAP, ASCAT, and AMSR2
    were considered for the final blended product. SMAP and ASCAT, hereafter referred
    to as SMAP + ASCAT; AMSR2 and SMAP, hereafter referred to as AMSR2 + SMAP; and
    ASCAT and AMSR2, hereafter referred to as ASCAT + AMSR2, were combined using the
    maximized R method. As mentioned in Section 1, the maximized R method is capable
    of improving the temporal R-values between combined and reference datasets if
    the reference value is well chosen. Kim et al. (2015b) suggested that the maximized
    R method can improve the temporal R-value of certain products with respect to
    reference values, and determined that the combined dataset is generally superior
    to those of the individual products. The combined SSM products were calculated
    by applying a weighting factor (w) with a constrained range of 0–1 as follows:
    (10) This combination process was only implemented for a given pixel when both
    parent products were available. Moreover, if the R-value of the combined product
    in a given location was less than the R-value of one of the parent products, then
    the parent product with the higher skill was used instead of the combined product.
    The R-value between SSMC and SSMREF can be expressed as a function of w: (11)
    where μ is the mean of the combined and reference value of SSM (SMC and SMREF),
    and σ is the standard deviation of the combined and reference value of SSM (SMC
    and SMREF). To combine two different SSM products (i.e., SSM1 and SSM2) from Eq.
    (10), the systematic differences between the reference SSM and each parent product
    (i.e., SMAP, ASCAT, and AMSR2) should be removed. Draper et al. (2009) suggested
    that the normalization of each product against a reference dataset (accomplished
    using Eq. (12)), could be used to remove systematic differences: (12) where SSMNOR
    is the normalized SSM against the reference product. After normalization, Eq.
    (11) was differentiated with respect to w to determine the value of w that optimizes
    the maximum R-value between SSMC and SSMREF. Finally, we obtained w using (13)
    where Rx·y is the correlation coefficient between the two products. In addition,
    a numerical method was utilized to maximize R if either parent product showed
    a negative R-value. In order to find the maximum of a constrained non-linear function,
    we used the MATLAB function fmincon (http://au.mathworks.com/help/optim/ug/fmincon.html).
    By setting the constraints (0 ≤ w ≤ 1) and the objective function (Eq. (11)),
    the weight factors could be optimized numerically. In total, 157,710 pixels were
    combined and numerical calculations occurred 5150, 12,798, and 2548 times for
    the SMAP + ASCAT, ASCAT + AMSR2, and AMSR2 + SMAP combinations, respectively.
    3. Results and discussion 3.1. Comparison with in situ observations The results
    of the statistical metrics for the comparison of GLDAS SSM, SMAP, ASCAT, AMSR2,
    and in situ SSM are shown in Table 2 for the period from 2015 to 2016. The average
    R-values for all networks were 0.73, 0.74, 0.64, and 0.65 for GLDAS, SMAP, ASCAT,
    and AMSR2, respectively. The average ubRMSD values were (0.0438, 0.0411, 0.0625,
    and 0.0708) m3 m− 3, and the average bias values were (0.0035 (0.03), − 0.0460
    (0.06), 0.0010 (0.04), and 0.0418 (0.06)) m3 m− 3 for GLDAS, SMAP, ASCAT, and
    AMSR2, respectively. The values in the parenthesis indicate the average absolute
    bias value. In terms of average R-value, GLDAS and SMAP showed better performance
    than the other products. The highest averaged R-value from SMAP compared with
    the in situ results were very encouraging; moreover, among all three satellite
    SSM products, only SMAP had a higher R-value than GLDAS in COSMOS (20 of 73),
    RSMN (17 of 19), SCAN (76 of 1018), SOLSCAPE (3 of 291), and USCRN (49 of 486)
    networks. In terms of the average ubRMSD, GLDAS and SMAP had the lowest values,
    with SMAP showing an overall dry bias. AMSR2 had the highest ubRMSD value and
    an overall wet bias. In addition, because we chose the GLDAS dataset to provide
    the reference values (which show low ubRMSD, bias, and absolute bias values against
    in situ observations), the ubRMSD and bias values in the combined products are
    expected to be greatly improved in relation to the in situ observations. However,
    many observations of R-values from GLDAS were similar to or less than those of
    SMAP; therefore, the R-value for the combination of SMAP with other products is
    expected to be barely improved; perhaps even decreased. Please find details in

    The in situ-based statistical results provide only limited regional satellite
    SSM performance and have scale mismatch issues. These limitations can be addressed
    by employing TC analysis. This enables inspection of global scale satellite-based
    SSM datasets. In this section, each product was compared using TC metrics. A simple
    sensitivity analysis was conducted in terms of different VOD ranges because vegetation
    is one of the most important parameters in the SSM retrieval algorithm (O''Neill
    et al., 2016). Furthermore, the results were interpreted using land classification
    datasets to provide the advantages and limitations of using certain satellite
    products for practical applications at global scale. 3.2.1. Global trends from
    TC statistics Fig. 3 shows global maps of three different TC metrics (SNR[dB],
    Ri2, and fMSE) for SMAP, ASCAT, and AMSR2. Similarly, in Fig. 4, the statistical
    performance of SNR[dB] for three satellite products was calculated and is ranked
    on the basis of higher value. Download : Download high-res image (697KB) Download

    insignificant results (p ≥ 0.05). (For interpretation of the references to color
    in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
    The TC results (Fig. 3) indicate that all satellite products have limitations
    in retrieving SSM in northern Africa, the Middle East, northern Asia, regions
    of Central Australia, and the western USA; where most of the world''s large, bare
    deserts and arid regions are located. Most of these regions were classified as
    desert and semi-desert by the BATS model (Fig. 1), had a VOD value < 0.20, and
    showed a high average sand fraction value (49.35%). These regions are known for
    high systematic retrieval error because the soil is extremely dry, and microwave-based
    SSM retrieval systems suffer significant challenges in providing a reading (Dorigo
    et al., 2010). First, these challenges are associated with problems in estimating
    the thickness of the emitting layer and the effective temperature (Holmes et al.,
    2006). Microwave bands of lower frequency (i.e., L- or C1-bands) penetrate dry
    soils even deeper and signals from deeper layers; therefore, significant problems
    arise when SSM is retrieved not only from passive microwave band instruments but
    also from active microwave band instruments in arid and semi-arid environments
    (Ulaby et al., 2015, Escorihuela et al., 2010, Wagner et al., 2013). Also, arid
    regions have very little SSM variation and changes in the SSM signal are often
    too small to exceed the background noise of the instrument. This adds to difficulties
    in retrieving SSM information using microwave-frequency observations. However,
    in the present research, only 3211 of 33,850 pixels (9.5%) (total number of desert
    and semi-desert pixels) were available for investigation of these regions. This
    means that definitive results can only be obtained after getting more and larger
    datasets to study in the future. Fig. 5a shows that ASCAT had the lowest number
    of the best SNR[dB] pixels in these areas, as indicated by the negative SNR[dB]
    (see the x-axis VOD range of 0.00–0.20). This is a well-known active sensor issue:
    they appear to be more sensitive to sub-surface heterogeneities or surface roughness
    (Wagner et al., 2003, Gruhier et al., 2010, Wagner et al., 2013). Wagner et al.
    (2013) also indicated that over some desert areas, passive SSM products are recommended
    for use, particularly over regions for which the value of VOD is ~ 0.00–0.20,
    and the average desert and semi-desert areas account for 82.5% of the land surface
    (Figs. 1 and S3). Download : Download high-res image (376KB) Download : Download

    interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is
    referred to the web version of this article.) For the VOD range between 0.00 and
    0.10, the TC statistics for SMAP, ASCAT, and AMSR2 are shown in Fig. 5b (SNR[dB]:
    1.57, − 1.48 and 0.66), Fig. 5c (Ri2: 0.56, 0.45, and 0.53), and Fig. 5d (fMSE:
    0.44, 0.55, and 0.47). All products showed high fMSE in these regions. Over an
    extremely dry surface, an active sensor can produce a wet bias from the unpredictable
    volume scattering from deeper soil layers or scattering from subsurface heterogeneity;
    as a result, erroneously higher SSM retrievals can be produced. This is supported
    by previous research indicating that the amount of backscatter decreased when
    the soil became slightly wet over desert or semi-arid environments (Wagner et
    al., 2013). Moreover, the dielectric property of quartz, which is significant
    given the very high sand fractions in desert and semi-desert regions (see Figs.
    1 and S4), can hamper retrieval of SSM by passive satellites (Pan et al., 2016).
    However, the passive-based datasets showed slightly better performance than did
    the ASCAT dataset for arid regions. This is apparent in the result of fMSE in
    Fig. 5d. The average value of the fMSE of ASCAT was > 0.5 and showed only negative
    SNR[dB] among all products. This indicates that the ASCAT SSM observations for
    such regions have higher noise variance than that of the observed SSM signals.
    As VOD increased from a sparsely vegetated value (0.00 < VOD < 0.20) to a moderately
    vegetated value (0.20 < VOD < 0.40), where crop and mixed farming, and tall and
    short grass are the major surface covers (Fig. 1c), the average SNR[dB] values
    for ASCAT and SMAP remarkably increased, whereas those for AMSR2 notably decreased
    after VOD exceeded 0.20. Over the moderately vegetated areas, SMAP had the highest
    SNR[dB], at 5.16–7.38 (red bars in Fig. 5b). Over more vegetated regions (0.40
    < VOD < 0.60), where > 76% of the area was covered by trees (Fig. 1c), ASCAT had
    the best SNR[dB] (green bars in Fig. 5). These results imply that ASCAT has better
    ability to reproduce accurate temporal patterns of the SSM than those of passive-based
    satellite products over densely vegetated areas. Moreover, the apparent contrast
    of fMSE between active and passive products are shown in the red boxes in Fig.
    3(g)–(i). One of the reasons for this result is that active microwave sensors
    are known to be less sensitive to surface temperature effects than passive sensors.
    This is a known characteristic of the instrument; thus, the active sensor can
    show better performance over widely varying temperature regions. Therefore, ASCAT
    showed less susceptibility to diurnal surface temperature variation over densely
    vegetated areas. Our results were consistent with the findings in several previous
    studies (Scipal et al., 2008b, Dorigo et al., 2010, Al-Yaari et al., 2014b). However,
    considering alternative technologies, the passive microwave SSM retrievals could
    be improved if the effective temperature estimates were parameterized (Parinussa
    et al., 2011). When two passive products were compared, SMAP showed better results
    in the statistical metrics for almost all the vegetation ranges. Over densely
    vegetated regions, the average SNR[dB] from SMAP decreased from 7.38 to 3.17 (red
    bars in Fig. 5b), and the SNR[dB] from AMSR2 remained < 3 (blue bars in Fig. 5b).
    This difference is likely attributable to the operating band. The C- and X-band
    frequencies of the passive sensors can easily be attenuated by vegetation, which
    makes their measurements relatively insensitive to SSM variability. The lower
    frequency band of SMAP (i.e., L-band) penetrates vegetation better than the AMSR2
    high-frequency bands (i.e., C1-, C2-, and X-bands). Furthermore, during the early
    morning, both the near-surface temperature change and Faraday rotation effects
    were at their minimum (Kerr et al., 2001). These conditions aid in the retrieval
    of SMAP SSM from the passive microwave radiometer at the 06:00 LT overpass time
    (Le Vine and Abraham, 2000, Jackson et al., 2010). In addition, it is noteworthy
    that areas with VOD values of > 0.6 had SSM datasets masked out, meaning that
    SSM retrieval from dense forests, such as those of the Amazon and Southeast Asia,
    remains impossible. When the fMSE values were carefully investigated, as Fig.
    5d shows, it became clear that the AMSR2 product should be carefully reviewed
    before using it for practical applications in densely vegetated areas (VOD > 0.50),
    as was also apparent from the negative SNR[dB] results in Fig. 5b (average fMSE
    value > 0.50). This indicates that AMSR2 SSM observations in these regions have
    higher noise variance than the observed SSM signal variance. 3.3. Evaluation of
    combined soil moisture products As discussed in Section 3.2, different products
    showed distinctive performance and error characteristics over land with different
    properties and in different climate zones. We assumed that the combination of
    different products would provide complementary abilities that could increase the
    R and lower the ubRMSD and bias values. To combine a pair of different SSM products,
    the maximized R approach was utilized (Section 2.6.3) using the GLDAS products
    as the reference data set. Table 3 shows the results of the statistical metrics
    for GLDAS (Table 3; first column), the original satellite SSM (Table 3; second
    column), and the combined product based on GLDAS (Table 3; third column) against
    the in situ observations. The datasets were separated into two parts: calibration
    dataset for 2015, and validation dataset for 2016, to achieve an independent validation
    process. Table 3. Statistical results comparing GLDAS, different satellite SSM,

    m3 m− 3. Except for the R-value results of SMAP, the R-values of combined product
    AMSR2 + ASCAT were improved when compared with the original products alone. This
    result can be explained by the performance of the reference dataset against in
    situ observations. Because many in situ observations in GLDAS had lower R-values
    than in SMAP, the computation of the weights was affected and resulted in calculation
    of sub-optimal weights. Therefore, the SMAP R-value rarely showed large improvement
    or even decreased, even after combination with other products. However, these
    points also imply that SMAP could be utilized to provide reference values to improve
    the temporal dynamics of GLDAS SSM datasets. In addition, because we chose a reference
    dataset with low ubRMSD (0.0411 m3 m− 3) and bias (0.0109 m3 m− 3) values against
    in situ observations, the ubRMSD and bias values in the combined products were
    greatly improved. Fig. 6 presents the box plots of R-values for the parents and
    combined products for six different VOD ranges worldwide. The red boxes represent
    the R-values of each original product, and the green and blue boxes indicate combined
    products. In Fig. 6a, the average R-values of SMAP consistently increased as the
    VOD ranges increased. When SMAP was combined with ASCAT (i.e., SMAP + ASCAT),
    increased average R-values for VOD ranges over 0.50 were observed in the combined
    product. However, for VOD ranges < 0.40, the R-value of SMAP products were hardly
    improved by the combination process because ASCAT and AMSR2 showed lower SNR[db]
    than did SMAP in these regions (Fig. 5). Considering the TC results, in which
    SMAP showed the best SNR[db] over the VOD range 0.00–0.40 and ASCAT showed the
    best SNR[db] over the VOD range 0.40–0.60, these results are natural consequences.

    Fig. 6. Box plots of R-values at different VOD ranges for original products (red
    boxes) and combined products (green or blue boxes). The number of datasets (NOD)
    for each VOD bin appears above each box plot. (For interpretation of the references
    to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this
    article.) As shown in Fig. 6b, the R-values from ASCAT (red boxes) continuously
    increased as the VOD increased. When ASCAT was combined with SMAP (SMAP + ASCAT;
    green boxes in Fig. 6b) and AMSR2 (SMAP + AMSR2; blue boxes in Fig. 6b), the averaged
    values of R increased rapidly at VOD < 0.20. Moreover, SMAP + ASCAT slightly increased
    as the VOD increased, before reaching 0.40. ASCAT + AMSR2 (blue boxes in Fig.
    6b) did not show improvement for VOD > 0.20 (green boxes in Fig. 6b). These results
    indicate that AMSR2 could be utilized to improve the performance of ASCAT over
    sparsely vegetated areas, and that SMAP is a good choice to improve ASCAT except
    over densely vegetated areas. These results are well explained by the SNR[db]
    results as well. As shown in Fig. 6c, the average R-value of AMSR2 (red boxes)
    increased for VOD < 0.30 (0.28–0.67); however, it decreased for VOD > 0.30. In
    particular, for VOD > 0.40; ASCAT + AMSR2 (blue boxes in Fig. 6c) compensated
    for the decreasing pattern in average R-value from AMSR2 better than AMSR2 + SMAP
    did (green boxes in Fig. 6c). These results suggest that for VOD > 0.40, ASCAT
    can be recommended as a strong candidate for combination with passive SSM retrieval.
    However, in the lower VOD range, AMSR2 is a relatively stronger contributor because
    it improves the temporal dynamics of both ASCAT and SMAP products (blue boxes
    in Fig. 6a and b). When ASCAT is considered for combination with passive satellite
    data over densely vegetated areas, it is better to choose a lower frequency (L-band)
    for SSM retrieval than a higher frequency. The L-band frequency offers the added
    advantage of being able to take measurements in conditions with denser vegetation
    than is possible with the C- or X-bands (green boxes versus blue boxes in Fig.
    6b). The results above emphasize that utilizing a variety of SSM datasets has
    great potential for remedying the shortcomings of individual products in challenging
    surface regions. Box plots of the ubRMSD and bias are included in Figs. S5 and
    S6. Because the ubRMSD and bias values were calibrated using a normalization approach,
    the combined products had ubRMSD values around 0.04 (m3 m− 3) and bias values
    around 0.01 (m3 m− 3). Fig. 7 presents two Taylor diagrams, illustrating the statistical
    comparison of the original and the combined products against in situ observations
    from each ISMN in 2016. The temporal variability in the original products is demonstrated
    by the SDV value results. In Fig. 7(a), the SDV values of the original SMAP, ASCAT,
    and AMSR2 products, represented by red, green, and blue symbols in the figure,
    are scattered widely in the SDV range 0.4–2.3. In Fig. 7(b), the SDV values of
    the combined SMAP + ASCAT, AMSR2 + SMAP, and ASCAT + AMSR2 products, represented
    by red, green, and blue symbols in the figure, are gathered near the SDV range
    1; straight lines with red, green, and blue colors indicate the average R-values
    for each product. The SDV value is the ratio between the SMSAT and SMIN SITU standard
    deviations. This statistic indicates that the variability from ground observation
    is lower than that of the original and combined products if the SDV is < 1, and
    vice versa. Moreover, the combined product SDV values are more tightly clustered
    than the original SDV values; most values are close to ‘1’. This means that for
    the products showing temporal variation similar to that of the in situ observations,
    the combined reproduced lower bias SSM information than the other original products.
    As we discussed in Section 3.3, the maximized R method highly depends on the performance
    of the reference values with in situ observations. We utilized the GLDAS datasets
    that showed better R-values than ASCAT and AMSR2 datasets, but similar or smaller
    R-values than SMAP datasets. However, the GLDAS datasets showed better results
    of ubRMSD and a higher absolute bias than all three products against in situ observations
    (Table 3). For these reasons, ASCAT and AMSR2 could be improved by SMAP at all
    sites (straight lines in Fig. 7). Unsurprisingly, the R-value of SMAP hardly improved
    because SMAP showed a better performance against in situ observations than the
    reference value. However, ubRMSD and bias highly improved because ubRMSD and bias
    of the reference datasets were closer to zero compared to in situ observations
    (SDV values in Fig. 7). These results emphasize that SMAP can be utilized as a
    reference value for combining the two different datasets to improve the temporal
    pattern of SSM for satellite-based datasets as well as the model SSM datasets.
    However, GLDAS datasets are recommended as the reference value to reduce the ubRMSD
    and bias value. Download : Download high-res image (351KB) Download : Download

    the widely used (ASCAT and AMSR2), and a relatively new (SMAP), satellite-based
    SSM datasets from active and passive microwave sensors and combined them to evaluate
    the performance of each combined product. First, we compared ASCAT, AMSR2, and
    SMAP SSM retrievals using in situ observations from 213 stations worldwide. These
    products were evaluated considering the degree of vegetation and surface properties
    using TC statistics. Second, we combined these three products using the maximized
    R method, which can be used to maximize the temporal correlation coefficient of
    the combined products. The GLDAS dataset was used assuming that it had the highest
    data quality for use with the maximize R method. Finally, we evaluated the performances
    of the combined products, focusing on the SMAP for the combination process. The
    major findings of this study are given in the following points. 1. The validation
    results of all satellite-based SSM products and the GLDAS dataset compared with
    in situ observations showed that SMAP had the strongest agreements with the temporal
    dynamic of SSM. SMAP had an average R-value of 0.74 along with a low value of
    ubRMSD (0.0411 m3 m− 3) and dry bias (− 0.0460 m3 m− 3). In comparison, AMSR2
    had a wet bias on average (0.0418 m3 m− 3). ASCAT had the least bias and absolute
    bias (0.0010 m3 m− 3 and 0.04 m3 m− 3) among all the satellite products. In addition,
    AMSR2 had the highest ubRMSD among all products (0.0708 m3 m− 3), which suggests
    special care be taken in using the AMSR2 product for certain applications. 2.
    When all satellite products were investigated on the basis of TC statistics on
    a global scale, it was difficult to retrieve SSM from certain regions of northern
    Africa, the Middle East, northern Asia, Central Australia, and the western USA.
    These regions are mostly arid, with 82.5% of the land surface either desert or
    semi-desert. In particular, ASCAT showed only negative SNR[dB] and the highest
    fMSE among all products. 3. Over the moderately vegetated areas (VOD range 0.10–0.40),
    the average SNR[dB] of all products increased significantly compared to that over
    low- and high-vegetated areas. Although the SNR[dB] from ASCAT increased as the
    VOD increased, the SNR[dB] from SMAP decreased slightly, and the SNR[dB] from
    AMSR2 decreased more rapidly. Furthermore, when VOD < 0.40, SMAP had the best
    SNR[dB] among all products. 4. Over densely vegetated areas (VOD range 0.40–0.60),
    ASCAT showed higher SNR[dB] than other products. In contrast, AMSR2 showed only
    negative SNR[dB] and the highest fMSE among all products. 5. Over the highly vegetated
    regions (VOD > 0.50) ASCAT performed better, especially when combined with SMAP,
    which increased the temporal variability of the SSM. This indicates that SSM retrieved
    using an active microwave sensor has the potential to enhance passive microwave
    sensor products. In particular, the accuracy of temporal variability from SMAP
    + ASCAT tended to be better than that in other combined products. 6. SMAP showed
    good performance when combined with other products, which improved its accuracy
    in reproducing SSM temporal variability over the sparsely- and moderately-vegetated
    areas. This suggests that SMAP is a strong candidate for combination with several
    satellite-based SSM products except over the densely-vegetated regions. 7. The
    combined products from different satellite-based SSM datasets demonstrated the
    possibility of overcoming the limitations of individual products in challenging
    regions. Hence, this work contributes to the improvement of the application of
    satellite-based SSM in various fields such as NWP, agriculture and forest management,
    dust outbreaks, water resource and irrigation management, and many other surface
    processes. In the future, study of various correction methods such as cumulative
    distribution function matching, linear regression correction, and the time-varying
    weight approach will lead to better performance of the combined products. Also,
    we used the original version of the SMAP SSM dataset, and its SSM retrieval algorithms
    will be improved in the near future by field campaigns such as the SMAP Validation
    Experiment. Especially, different ASCAT SSM products such as the time series products
    distributed by H-SAF may show better quality than the NRT data found in the EUMETSAT
    archive. These datasets are expected to be significantly improved in the upcoming
    product release. Moreover, use of the improved datasets of the parent products
    provides potential for the combination products to be improved as well. All satellite
    products currently improve rapidly when spurred by positive competition; thus,
    the new mission, SMAP, has considerable potential for being complemented with
    existing satellite SSM products. In addition, many possibilities remain for improving
    AMSR2 SSM retrieval because the AMSR2 LPRM SSM products are expected to be much
    improved through enhanced versions before the final version was released. The
    updated and alternate choice for satellite-based SSM and re-analysis datasets
    can be utilized in future research to provide a better understanding of operational
    hydrological investigations and to improve combined active/passive satellite products.

    Graphical Abstract. \nI. \nINTRODUCTION \nIoT is a combination of worldwide data,\
    \ web associated \nitems or things, and is an integral component of the future\
    \ \nInternet. IoT focuses on the automation of processes by \nlessening human\
    \ interaction. In the process of automation, IoT \ncollects data using sensors\
    \ and processes the data using \ncontrollers and completing the automation processes\
    \ by using \nactuators [1], [2]. IoT in agriculture and farming focus is on \n\
    automating all the aspects of farming and agricultural methods \nto make the process\
    \ more efficient and effective. Traditional \napproaches in livestock management\
    \ (such as cattle detection) \nare not fully automated and have many inefficiencies\
    \ such as \nhigher human interaction, labour cost, power consumption, \nand water\
    \ consumption [1], [3], [4], [5], [6]. The central \nconcept of this review is\
    \ to analyse the IoT sub-verticals, \ncollected data for measurements and used\
    \ technologies to \ndevelop applications. It is essential to identify the most\
    \ \nresearched sub-verticals, data collections and technologies to \ncreate new\
    \ IoT applications in the future.  \n \n \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced\
    \ Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 10, No. 4, 2019 \n12 | P a g e  \n\
    www.ijacsa.thesai.org \nThis review provides an overall picture of currently \n\
    developed IoT applications in agriculture and farming \nbetween 2016 and 2018.\
    \ \nAs a solution to the existing problems, researchers have \nfocused on smart\
    \ agricultural and farming automated systems \nwith the help of IoT [7], [8],\
    \ [9], [10].  IoT is the network of \nthings which identifies elements clearly\
    \ with the help of \nsoftware intelligence, sensors and ubiquitous connectivity\
    \ to \nthe Internet. In IoT, the data that collects from Internet-\nconnected\
    \ items or things contains with gadgets, sensors and \nactuators [1]. Many researchers\
    \ have focused on smart \nsystems for monitoring and controlling agricultural\
    \ parameters \nby enhancing productivity and efficiency. Smart systems \ncollect\
    \ data for measurements to get accurate results that can \nlead to appropriate\
    \ actions. Current use of smart agricultural \nsystems relates to collecting data\
    \ on environmental parameters \nsuch as temperature, humidity, soil moisture and\
    \ pH [11], \n[12], [13]. With accurate sensor data collection using a range \n\
    of different sensors, researchers have implemented smart \nagricultural systems\
    \ to make the farm process more effective \n[9], [14]. Research has mainly focused\
    \ on sub-verticals such \nas water management, crop management and smart farming\
    \ to \nmake processes automated by reducing human intervention, \ncosts, power\
    \ consumption and water consumption. \nThe automation process of agricultural\
    \ and farming \nreduced human interaction and improve the efficiency. The \nreason\
    \ for that is every country population depends on \nagriculture thus consumers\
    \ of these resources should use water \nand land resources optimally [19], [20].\
    \ Moreover, it is \nimperative to have good quality production and crop \nmanagement\
    \ in order to maximize profitability. Hence, IoT \nbase agricultural management\
    \ systems are integral for an \nagriculturally based country. The new systems\
    \ developed \nusing IoT technologies have reduced the drawbacks associated \n\
    with traditional approaches and provided many advantages to \nfarmers. For example,\
    \ IoT-based water management systems \ncollect environmental attributes such as\
    \ temperature, water \nlevel and humidity through the sensors and provide accurate\
    \ \nirrigation timing [19], [21]. In addition, crop management \nsystems developed\
    \ using IoT monitor the temperature, \nhumidity and soil through sensors thus\
    \ providing adequate \ninformation so that farmers can manage the crops \nappropriately\
    \ [25]. Overall, these IoT-based systems help to \nreduce human interaction, power\
    \ utilization and reduce cost in \nthe field of agriculture. Moreover, IoT-based\
    \ agricultural \nrelated applications have been used in the area of pest control,\
    \ \nweather monitoring, nutrient management and greenhouse \nmanagement. \nIoT\
    \ for agriculture uses sensors to collect big data on the \nagricultural environment.\
    \ It discovers, analyses and deals with \nmodels built upon big data to make the\
    \ development of \nagriculture more sustainable [34]. IoT can provide efficient\
    \ \nand low-cost solutions to the collection of data. Weather, \nWater Scarcity,\
    \ Soil fertility and Pesticides are the significant \nplayers in it. IoT will\
    \ make agriculture beneficiary. \nAgriculture and farming depend on water [35].\
    \ Farmers \ndepend on rainfall for all their agricultural needs. \nFertilizer\
    \ also plays a very significant role in the field of \nagriculture by helping\
    \ to increase the productivity of plants \n[36]. By using IoT, farmers can manage\
    \ soil condition more \neffectively and at less expense by monitoring them from\
    \ any \nlocation [37]. The primary objective of this study is how IoT \nand technologies\
    \ are used in conserving water, fertiliser and \nenergy in the agricultural industry\
    \ by combining new \ntechnologies. This has benefits for the development of the\
    \ \neconomy of countries as well as the wealth of the people [38]. \nWith the\
    \ combination of both advanced technologies in \nhardware and software, IoT can\
    \ track and count all relevant \naspects of production which can reduce the waste,\
    \ loss and \ncost [39]. The information needed to make smart decisions can \n\
    be obtained merely by using electronic devices [40]. IoT \ntransforms the agricultural\
    \ industry and enables farmers to \novercome different challenges. Innovative\
    \ applications can \naddress these issues and therefore increase the quality,\
    \ \nquantity, sustainability and cost-effectiveness of crop \nproduction [41],\
    \ [42], [43]. IoT provides more benefits to the \nfarming industry by improving\
    \ the health of animals through \nbetter food and environment, addressing the\
    \ labour shortage \nissue as well cost savings through automation, increase in\
    \ milk \nproduction, and increase in some animals during the breeding \nperiod\
    \ through detection of estrus cycle and additional \nrevenue streams from waste.\
    \ \nOur \nstudy \nhas \nanalyzed \nrecently \ndeveloped \nIoT \napplications in\
    \ the fields of agriculture and farming to address \ncurrent issues such as unnecessary\
    \ human interaction leading \nto higher labour cost, unnecessary water consumption\
    \ and \nwater-saving measures for the future, higher energy \nconsumption, energy-saving\
    \ measures for the future and crop \nmonitoring difficulties. According to our\
    \ analysis, we can \nidentify a focus on water and crop management as sub-\nverticals\
    \ in the agriculture and farming sectors. This survey \nalso focusses on other\
    \ agriculture and farming sub-verticals to \nidentify the gap between IoT application\
    \ developments in the \nleast researched areas. The IoT generates enormous data,\
    \ so-\ncalled big data (high volume, at a different speed and different \nvarieties\
    \ of data) in varying data quality. Analysing the IoT \nsystem and its key attributes\
    \ are the key to advancing smart \nIoT utilization. Therefore, the primary aim\
    \ of our paper is to \nexplore recently created IoT applications in the agriculture\
    \ and \nfarming industry to give the more profound understanding \nabout sensor\
    \ data collection, used technologies, and sub-\nverticals, for example, water\
    \ and crop management. The \nsecondary aim of this study is to analyse the current\
    \ issues \nsuch as higher human interaction, high labour cost, higher \nwater\
    \ consumption and save water for future, higher energy \nconsumption and save\
    \ energy/electricity for future, crop \nmonitoring difficulties in IoT for agriculture\
    \ and farming. \nThe remainder of this paper is as follows: In Section II we \n\
    include raw data collection methodology, data inclusion \ncriteria, and data analysis\
    \ methods. Finally, the results of \nAgriculture and Farming based on IoT Sub\
    \ verticals, Sensor \nData, and Technologies are presented in Section III, and\
    \ in \nSection IV we discuss the results. Section V concludes the \npaper. The\
    \ raw data collected from 60 peer-reviewed \npublications used in this paper are\

    \ \nII. MATERIALS AND METHODS \nData collection involves identifying important\
    \ criteria in \nresearch articles on the Internet of Things (IoT) in the \nagriculture\
    \ and farming sectors.  \nAs shown in Table I, these essential criteria were used\
    \ to \nanalyse relevant research papers. In particular, 60 peer-\nreviewed scientific\
    \ publications on IoT in the agriculture and \nfarming sectors published in scientific\
    \ journals between 2016 \nand 2018 were used. \n1) Collection of raw data: The\
    \ data gathered for this \nreview is from 60 peer-reviewed publications (2016-2018)\
    \ \nthat were collected from the IEEE database. All these \npublications have\
    \ different data applications that have been \nstudied and analyzed in this survey.\
    \ The attributes compared \nwere sub-verticals, data collection measurements,\
    \ used \ntechnologies, challenges in current approach, benefits, \ncountries and\
    \ drivers of IoT. \n2) Data inclusion criteria: To evaluate the data inclusion\
    \ \ncriteria a comparison table was drawn to include as the \nfollowing attributes:\
    \ Author, Sub vertical, Data collection \nmeasurements, Technologies, Benefits,\
    \ Challenges, Solutions \nand Drivers of IoT. Nevertheless, in our study, articles\
    \ were \nexcluded when the selected attributes were not present. In our \nanalysis,\
    \ the number of sensors, amount of data collected, \nunderlying \ntechnologies,\
    \ \nsensor \ntopology \nand \nother \nintermediate gateways were not included\
    \ since no information \ncan find with all the peer-reviewed publications (2016-2018).\
    \ \n3) Data analysis: We pooled and analyzed the reported \nstudies based on data\
    \ collected through peer reviewed articles \nand displaying emerging themes in\

    \ details of the study based on \nthe publication year were analyzed to observe\
    \ the results from \n2016 to 2018. \nIII. RESULTS \nThis review aims to analyse\
    \ the incorporation of IoT for \nthe development of applications in the agriculture\
    \ and farming \nsectors. The study focuses on sub-verticals and collecting data\
    \ \nfor measurements and technologies in the field of agriculture \nand farming\
    \ to increase productivity and efficiency with the \nhelp of the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT). This study of IoT in \nagriculture and farming focuses on developing\
    \ a criterion \napproach with the help of agricultural environmental \nparameters\
    \ and IoT measures and technologies. In the field of \nagriculture, there are\
    \ many environmental parameters that \nneed to be considered to enhance crops,\
    \ reduce water \nconsumption and human involvement [44]. Moreover, there \nare\
    \ many sub-verticals that can be identified depending on the \ndifferences in\
    \ approach. \nIn this review, we have gathered articles which have \nfocused on\
    \ agricultural and farming sub-verticals from 2016 to \n2018. As shown in Fig.\
    \ 1, 23 sub-verticals were found \naccording to the results obtained and the topmost\
    \ area was \nwater management (28.08%). \nAs IoT depends on sensor data collections,\
    \ a vast amount \nof data needs to be gathered to identify or predict accurate\
    \ \nresults. This study indicates that many researchers have \nfocused on environmental\
    \ temperature (24.87%), humidity \n(19.79%) and soil moisture (15.73%) as environmental\
    \ \nmeasurements. As shown in Fig. 2, 28 types of data were \ncollected for measurements\
    \ with environmental temperature \nand humidity being considered the most critical\
    \ parameters for \nagriculture and farming. \nAs shown in Fig. 3, we have categorised\
    \ all technologies \nused in the articles. This study has identified Wi-Fi as\
    \ the \nmost used technology (30.27%) followed by Mobile \nTechnology (21.10%)\
    \ for both agriculture and farming. \nZigBee, another data transfer technology,\
    \ is also used but to a \nlesser extent. \nAccording to Fig. 4, the use of IoT\
    \ was more prominent in \nthe agriculture industry than the farming industry (Agriculture\
    \ \n– 76.1%, Farming – 23.8%). \n \nFig. 1. Agriculture and Farming Sub Verticals:\

    \ \nIn this review we have identified important attributes to \nanalyse the research\
    \ findings in agriculture and farming \nprocesses. We have gathered and analyzed\
    \ data by using 60 \nrecent scientific articles. Our survey shows the most \n\
    researched \nsub-verticals are \nwater \nmanagement, crop \nmanagement and smart\
    \ farming. Water management is the \nmost researched sub-vertical for the last\
    \ few years as most \ncountries mainly focus on the utilization of water resources\
    \ \ndue to its lack of abundance [61]. Irrigation patterns in \nagriculture influence\
    \ crop production making irrigation \nmanagement a central focus to increase productivity\
    \ [8], [10].  \nThe second most considered sub-vertical is crop management \n\
    due to the importance of producing food for a growing global \npopulation. It\
    \ is important to manage the quality, quantity and \neffectiveness of the agricultural\
    \ production for sustainability \n[13]. Although a study [18] discussed that the\
    \ widely used \nsensor data collections for measurements are soil conditions as\
    \ \npH and humidity, as per our analysis it shows environmental \ntemperature\
    \ followed by humidity and soil moisture are the \nmost commonly measured data.\
    \ \nIoT can further be defined as a fusion of heterogeneous \nnetworks including\
    \ chip technology that scopes gradually \nmore and more, expanding due to the\
    \ rapid growth of Internet \napplications such as logistics, agriculture, smart\
    \ community, \nintelligent transposition, control and tracking systems. \nAccording\
    \ to researchers’ analysis, in 2020 IoT objects will be \nsemi-intelligent and\
    \ an important part of human social life \n[46]. As analyzed in our review Wi-Fi,mobile\
    \ technology are \nthe technologies which have a wide range of demand in \nagriculture\
    \ and farming domain to monitor land and water \nresources in contrast to other\
    \ technologies [33], [35]. \nAlthough our results demonstrate the results in such\
    \ a way, a \nstudy [62] analyzed that use of RFID, a Wireless Sensor \nNetwork\
    \ (WSN) technology that can be effectively used to \nincrease the crop production\
    \ to meet the growing needs of the \nincreasing population. In developing countries\
    \ with limited \nInternet speed, the other IoT technologies utilised rather than\
    \ \nWi-Fi include Low-Power, Short-Range IoT Networks, low-\nrate wireless PAN\
    \ (LoRaWAN) or Low-Power and Wide-\nArea Networks. \nFurther research [61] shows\
    \ that WSN is used in many \napplications \nsuch \nas \nhealth \nmonitoring, \n\
    agriculture, \nenvironmental monitoring, and military applications whereas \n\
    our study demonstrates the agriculture sector using IoT in and \nfarming sector\
    \ using IoT. Our observations show that \nAgriculture is the primary source of\
    \ income in developing \ncountries, such as India with the sizeable geographical\
    \ area \nwhen comparing with other countries [9]. \nMost of the research studies\
    \ have performed on water \nmanagement by monitoring such environmental parameters\
    \ as \ntemperature, humidity and soil moisture [1], [3], [5], [19], \n[25]. Many\
    \ of the findings have focused on better water \nutilization, reduction inhuman\
    \ intervention and the cost of \nproduction [18], [27]. Future research could\
    \ draw more \nattention to further automate current processes in waste \nmanagement,\
    \ smart lightening and pest controlling sub-\nverticals by reducing existing drawbacks\
    \ since it has received \nthe least research attention in the considered period.\
    \ Fog \ncomputing, as an innovation with cross over any barrier \nbetween remote\
    \ data centres and IoT devices, should be \nconsidered in future IoT analysis\
    \ [63], [64], [65], [66], [67]. \nWhile IoT has solved many issues related to\
    \ agriculture and \nfarming there are limitations that we need to consider. Lack\
    \ of \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,\
    \ \nVol. 10, No. 4, 2019 \n25 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \ninteroperability\
    \ and compatibility in devices, network \nflexibility issues when more devices\
    \ are connecting, and \nsensor lifetime is some of the limitations to be addressed\
    \ in \nfuture research. \nThis study has found that industry 4.0 in agriculture\
    \ \nfocuses on IoT aspects transforming the production \ncapabilities including\
    \ the agricultural domain. This study has \n[68] considered soil quality, irrigation\
    \ levels, weather, the \npresence of insects and pests as sensor data. Some of\
    \ the \nsignificant aspects they have been researched are the driver’s \nassistance\
    \ to optimise routes and shorten harvesting and crop \ntreatment while reducing\
    \ fuel consumption CISCO [69]. \nProducing enough food for the entire world is\
    \ a big challenge \nsince the global population is rapidly changing as well as\
    \ \nclimate change and labour shortage. Currently researchers \nhave focused more\
    \ on robotics to address these problems. A \ngrowing number of researchers and\
    \ companies have focused \non Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to weeding\
    \ by \nreducing the amount of herbicide used by farmers. \nIn contrast to edge\
    \ computing, cloud computing requires a \nhigh-speed internet connection with\
    \ sending and retrieving \ndata from the cloud. As the process involves transferring\
    \ and \nreceiving data from the cloud, the process is time-consuming. \nSince\
    \ the data capacity is higher than bandwidth, it is always \nessential to process\
    \ data locally instead of sending data to the \ncloud. Edge computing is more\
    \ efficient than cloud processing \nwhen processing data since the capacity doubles\
    \ faster than \nthe bandwidth doubles [70]. Since IoT uses sensor data \ncollection\
    \ for decision making, to process collected data, the \ncloud, or the edge based\
    \ can be used on the system \nrequirements. \nStill, there are some challenges\
    \ associated with IoT system \ndeployment. Connecting so many devices to the IoT\
    \ network \nis the biggest challenge in the future following lack of \ntechnical\
    \ knowledge among farmers, current centralised \narchitecture to support IoT systems\
    \ is not much advanced as \nthe growth of the network, centralised systems will\
    \ turn into a \nbottleneck. Moreover, sensor battery capacity and lifetime and\
    \ \nsensor data storage also more concentrated when IoT system \ndeployment. Smart\
    \ farming is the association with new \nadvancements in technologies and the different\
    \ crop and \nlivestock, agriculture and farming in the digital age. Smart \nfarming\
    \ can deliver agriculture more beneficial for the farmer. \nThis is because decreasing\
    \ input resources will save farmers' \nmoney and labour, and hence, will increase\
    \ reliability [71] and \nbusiness outcome [72], [73]. \nFurthermore, studying\
    \ diverse approaches for fog \ncomputing structure [63], decision making using\
    \ prediction or \npattern analysis [74], [75], [76], big data databases [77] could\
    \ \nbe an exciting way to make the Internet of Things (IoT) into \nthe future\
    \ dominating technology. \nThis survey will fill the gap by the identification\
    \ of the \ndifferent IoT sub-verticals and data collections for the \nmeasurements\
    \ in the agriculture and farming process. Results \nare clearly showing that most\
    \ considered sub-verticals and \ndata collections for measurements in the field\
    \ of agriculture \nand farming. Our study also indicates the technologies used\
    \ \nfor IoT application development in the reviewed period. To \nsummarise this\
    \ survey, this has broader knowledge about IoT \napplications developed for automating\
    \ the agriculture and \nfarming process. Moreover, this study identifies most\
    \ \nconsidered \nsub-verticals, \ncollected \nsensor \ndata \nand \ntechnologies\
    \ for the development of IoT based applications in \nagriculture and farming sector\
    \ towards the significant \nimprovement of the business. \nTable II shows the\

     \n \nV. CONCLUSION \nFrom our observations from the 60 peer-reviewed \npublications\
    \ \n(2016–2018) \nin \ndiscussing \nthe \npotential \napplications of the Internet\
    \ of Things, it was found that water \nmanagement is the highest considered IoT\
    \ sub-vertical \nfollowed by crop management, smart farming, livestock \nmanagement,\
    \ and irrigation management with the same \npercentage. As per the observation,\
    \ the most critical sensor \ndata collection for the measurement is environmental\
    \ \ntemperature, environmental humidity and also there are some \nother such sensor\
    \ data also gathered for IoT applications as \nsoil moisture and soil pH. Wi-Fi\
    \ has the highest demand of \nusage in agriculture and farming industry, followed\
    \ by mobile \ntechnology.  Other technologies as ZigBee, RFID, Raspberry \npi,\
    \ WSN, Bluetooth, LoRa and GPRS have less demand in the \nagriculture and farming\
    \ sectors. When compared to the \nagricultural sector, farming industry has a\
    \ lesser percentage \namount using IoT for the automation. This survey could be\
    \ \nuseful for researchers for finding new ways and solution to \nchallenge in\
    \ the current agricultural era and for agricultural \nand farming industries to\
    \ make the automation process more \neffective and efficient, consequently, to\
    \ obtain the good \nbusinesses outcome. \nAUTHORS’ PROFILE \nR.M., S.W., and M.N.H.\

    Get rights and content Abstract The Shuttleworth and Wallace (SW) model with variable
    canopy resistance was evaluated to estimate evapotranspiration (ETv) from a drip-irrigated
    Merlot (Vitis vinifera L.) vineyard trained on a vertical shoot-positioned (VSP)
    system. This vineyard is located in the Talca Valley, Region del Maule, Chile
    (35°25′ LS; 71°32′ LW; 125 m a.s.l). The performance of the SW model was evaluated
    using the eddy-covariance method on a 30 min time interval. Also, sub-models to
    estimate net radiation (Rn) and soil heat flux (G) were used in the SW model.
    A good agreement between observed and estimated values of Rn was found with a
    root mean square error (RMSE) of 33 W m−2 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 24
    W m−2. Also, the SW model was able to estimate latent heat flux with RMSE and
    MAE of 34 and 21 W m−2, respectively. On a daily basis, results indicate that
    the SW model was able to predict the ETv with RMSE and MAE values of 0.51 and
    0.41 mm d−1, respectively. These results suggest that it is possible to directly
    estimate ETv over unstressed grapevines using meteorological data and soil moisture
    measurements. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Canopy
    resistanceEnergy balanceVineEvapotranspiration 1. Introduction The main viticultural
    areas of Chile have experienced more frequent droughts related to the “La Niña”-Southern
    Oscillation (ENSO) events during the last 10 years (Meza et al., 2003). For this
    reason, the drip irrigation system has been widely adopted by farmers to optimize
    water application in vineyards. Additionally, drip-irrigated vineyards require
    a correct irrigation scheduling in order to maintain existing production levels
    and wine quality. A key to achieve these targets is the estimation of actual evapotranspiration
    (ETa) according to nonlinear interactions of soil, vines and atmospheric conditions.
    In this regard, Sene (1994) and Ortega-Farias et al. (2007) suggested using the
    two-layer model of Shuttleworth and Wallace (SW) to directly estimate ETa using
    meteorological data measured over a non-irrigated and drip-irrigated vineyard,
    respectively. Furthermore, during the last decade, the SW model has been widely
    used to estimate ETa in different types of sparse crops and climatic conditions
    (Alves and Cameira, 2002, Anadranistakis et al., 2000, Kato et al., 2004, Zhou
    et al., 2006, Gardiol et al., 2003, Fisher et al., 2005). In the SW model, ETa
    is calculated as the sum of the Penman–Monteith equation for evaporation and transpiration,
    weighted by a set of coefficients that represent the combination of soil and canopy
    resistances (Shuttleworth and Wallace, 1985). However, the direct estimation of
    ETa is complex because vineyard water use is controlled by energy absorbed by
    vines and soil surface. Vineyards consist of widely spaced plants that allow for
    deep penetration of sunlight into the canopy. As a result, the soil contribution
    to the energy balance is considerable (Spano et al., 2000). This depends highly
    on management practices that determine vine vigour and, hence, water-use (Yunusa
    et al., 2004). The vigour of the vine is manifested through the canopy size, leaf
    area index (LAI), and fraction of soil surface covered by vegetation (fc). In
    commercial vineyards, canopy cover is generally incomplete as a result of the
    canopy geometry generated by training systems. According to canopy structure and
    vegetation coverage, sensible heat flux (H) generated at the soil surface can
    be a major contributor to the vineyard energy balance which plays a key role in
    vine transpiration and evaporation. For this reason, the incomplete canopy cover
    is considered a major cause of the relatively low rate of transpiration by grapevines
    in commercial vineyards since the majority of the incident radiation is not captured,
    but transmitted to the bare soil surface (Yunusa et al., 2004). Therefore, the
    application of the SW model for irrigation scheduling requires an adequate characterization
    of canopy geometry and training system, which control the energy absorbed by vines
    and soil surface. For a drip-irrigated Cabernet Sauvignon vineyard, Ortega-Farias
    et al. (2007) indicated that the SW model simulated latent heat flux (LE) and
    ETa with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 22 W m−2 and 0.36 mm d−1, respectively.
    According to this study, the parameterization of LAI and canopy resistance is
    critical in order to increase confidence in the accuracy of the SW model. Also,
    the SW model was able to predict LE over a furrow-irrigated vineyard with a MAE
    value of 39 W m−2 (Zhang et al., 2008). Unlike to these studies, our research
    consists of evaluating the application of SW model to directly simulate LE and
    ETa using weather data (air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar
    radiation) generated by an automatic meteorological station installed over a drip-irrigated
    Merlot vineyard. Also, this study includes the evaluation of a sub-model for estimating
    the net radiation (Rn) and soil heat flux (G) using only conventional meteorological
    data. Finally, the canopy resistance was simulated using weather information in
    combination with soil water content measurements in the root-zone, and soil surface
    resistance was calculated only as a function of soil water content in the top
    layer of soil. 2. Theory The daytime and nighttime variation of latent heat flux
    from vine transpiration and soil evaporation is computed by the following expressions
    (Shuttleworth and Wallace, 1985): (1) (2) (3) where ETv = actual evapotranspiration
    over a vineyard (mm d−1); λ = latent heat of vaporization (J kg−1); LE = latent
    heat flux from vineyard (W m−2); T = latent heat flux from vine transpiration
    (W m−2); E = latent heat flux from soil evaporation (W m−2); Cc = canopy resistance
    coefficient; Cs = soil surface resistance coefficient; Δ = slope of the saturation
    vapor pressure curve at the mean temperature (kPa K−1); A = available energy leaving
    the complete canopy (W m−2); cp = specific heat of the air at constant pressure
    (1013 J kg−1 K1); ρa = air density (kg m−3); D = water vapor pressure deficit
    at the reference height (kPa); ; As = available energy at the soil surface (W
    m−2); ; γ = psychrometric constant (kPa K−1); ; ; and . 3. Materials and methods
    3.1. General description The experiment was conducted during the 2006/2007 and
    2007/2008 growing seasons on a drip-irrigated commercial Merlot (Vitis vinifera
    L.) vineyard located in the Talca Valley, Región del Maule, Chile (35°25′ LS;
    71°32′ LW; 125 m a.s.l.). The climate in this area is a typical Mediterranean
    semiarid climate with an average daily temperature of 17.1 °C between September
    and March (between spring and summer periods). Average annual rainfall in the
    region is about 676 mm falling mainly during the winter months. The summer period
    is usually dry (2.2% of annual rainfall) and hot while the spring is on average
    wet (16% of annual rainfall). The soil at the vineyard is classified as the Talca
    series (family Fine, mixed, thermic Ultic Haploxeralfs) with a clay loam texture.
    For the effective rooting depth (0–60 cm), the volumetric soil water content at
    field capacity (θFC) and at wilting point (θWP) were 0.36 m3 m−3 (216 mm) and
    0.22 m3 m−3 (132 mm), respectively. The management allowed depletion (MAD) was
    29% (174 mm), which corresponded to a normalized soil water content value (F4)
    of 0.51. The Merlot vines were planted in 1999 in north-south rows 2.5 m apart,
    with 1.5 m within-row spacing. The vines were trained on a vertical shoot-positioned
    (VSP) system with a foliage height of 2.0 m and canopy width of 0.5 m. The canopy
    geometry of this training system was similar to a parallelepiped which was conserved
    after bloom (about mid-November) by hedging two or three times during the summer.
    Typical vine trunk diameters were about 11.7 cm (±0.8 cm) and soil surface was
    maintained free of weeds or cover crop during the experiment. 3.2. Irrigation
    management and plant measurements Irrigation water was delivered twice a week
    in the morning using 4.0 L h−1 drippers spaced at intervals of 1.5 m along the
    rows. Weekly measurements of soil water content (θi) at the rooting depth (0–60
    cm) were taken using a portable TDR unit (TRASE, Soil Moisture Corp., Santa Barbara,
    CA) with 12 pairs of rods inserted below the drippers. Also, the volumetric soil
    water content (θg) in the top layer of soil (0–20 cm) was measured under vine
    canopy (4 points) and between rows (6 points). The average value of θg was weighted
    by a fractional cover of 0.3 which was estimated by measuring dimension of canopy
    10 times during each season. Vine water status was evaluated using the midday
    stem water potential (ψx) measured with a pressure chamber (Soil Moisture Equipment,
    Santa Barbara, CA). ψx was measured on 12 fully expanded leaves, wrapped in aluminum
    foil and encased in plastic bags at least 2 h before measurement. Stomatal resistance
    (rst) was measured using a portable infrared gas analyzer (model LI-6400, LI-COR,
    Lincoln, NE). Measurements of ψx and rst were done at midday (approximately 11:00–14:00
    h) from sunlit and shaded leaves situated on both sides of the vine rows. Leaf
    area index (LAI) was estimated as a function of the shoot length which was correlated
    with its total leaf area (Ortega-Farias et al., 2007): (4) (5) where LAsh = total
    leaf area per shoot (cm2); Av = area of vines (cm2); i = total shoot number per
    vine; and Lsh = shoot length (cm). To develop the correlation between LAsh and
    Lsh, leaves of each shoot were scanned so that leaf area was measured using an
    image analysis. On four vines the total shoot length per vine was measured once
    a week during the experiment. 3.3. Energy balance measurements An automatic weather
    system was installed at the Merlot vineyard to measure energy balance components
    and meteorological variables at 30-min interval. Wind speed (u) and wind direction
    were monitored by a cup anemometer and a wind vane (03101-5, Young, Michigan,
    USA) and precipitation (Pp) was measured by a rain gauge (A730RAIN, Adcon Telemetry,
    Austria). Air temperature (Ta) and relative humidity (RHa) were measured using
    a Vaisala probe (model HMP45C). Net radiation (Rn), incoming (Rsi) and outgoing
    (Rso) solar radiation were measured by a four-way net radiometer (CNR1, Kipp&Zonen
    Inc., Delft, Netherlands). Sensors of u, , Pp, Ta, RHa, Rn, Rsi, and Rso were
    installed at 4.7 m above the soil surface. Also a Vaisala probe for measuring
    temperature (Tc) and relative humidity (RHc) within canopy was installed inside
    the foliage at 1.6 m above the soil surface. Rn at the soil surface was measured
    by a Fritchen type net radiometer (REBS-Q7, Campbell Sci., Logan, UT) at a 0.5
    m height. Additionally, the sensor inter-comparison over a grass surface indicated
    that differences between the CNR1 and REBS-Q7 were less than 30 W m−2, which is
    within sensor accuracy. Latent heat flux (LE) and sensible heat flux (H) were
    measured using an eddy-covariance (EC) system mounted at a height of 4.7 m and
    oriented towards the predominant wind direction (South). The system consisted
    of a fast response open-path infrared gas analyzer (LI-7500 IRGA; LI-COR, Inc.,
    Lincoln, Nebraska, USA) and a three dimensional sonic anemometer (CSAT, Campbell
    Sci., Logan, UT). The minimum fetch-to-instrument-height ratio was about 200:1,
    sufficiently large to preclude horizontal advection. Also, estimates of LE from
    the LI-7500 IRGA were corrected for air density (Webb et al., 1980), and H estimates
    were corrected for sonic temperature (Schotanus et al., 1983). LE and H measurements
    were made at 10 Hz, and means, standard deviations, and covariances were calculated
    for 30-min periods by Reynolds block averaging. Soil heat flux was estimated using
    eight flux plates installed on either side of the rows (6 and 2 plates into the
    inter-row and below row, respectively). This arrangement takes into account the
    row shade effect during the course of the day. The flux plates of constant thermal
    conductivity (HFT3, Campbell Sci., Logan, UT) were placed at a 0.08 m depth (d).
    Also, two averaging thermocouple probes (TCAV, Campbell Sci., Logan, UT) to measure
    soil temperature (Tsoil) were installed above each flux plate at depths of 0.02
    and 0.06 m. At each position, the soil heat flux was calculated by adding the
    measured flux at 0.08 m to the heat stored (S) in the layer above the heat flux
    plates. Values of S are given by: (6) where ρb = soil bulk density (1600 kg m−3);
    ρw = density of water (1000 kg m−3); Cd = specific heat capacity of soil (890
    J kg−1 K−1); Cw = specific heat capacity of the soil water (4190 J kg−1 K−1);
    ΔTsoil = change in soil temperature (K); Δt = time intervals (s). Half-hour averages
    of all signals were recorded on an electronic datalogger (CR 5000, Campbell Sci.,
    Logan, UT). Every 15 days, soil evaporation (E) was measured with microlysimeters
    which were made from PVC tubes of 75 mm i.d. and 150 mm in length (Yunusa et al.,
    2004). Four microlysimeters were installed on either side of the vines into the
    inter-row and two microlysimeters were installed within the drip-line (one below
    drip and the other one between drippers). 3.4. Data quality control Wilson et
    al. (2002) indicated that the eddy correlation (EC) system could present systematic
    errors in the measurements of turbulent energy fluxes (LE and H). Therefore, it
    is very important to avoid systematic energy imbalances and errors in the direct
    EC measurements used for model validations. For this reason, entire days that
    clearly exhibited persistent noisy behavior due to instrumental problems, flow
    distortion through the tower, or adverse meteorological conditions (for example
    rainy days) were discarded. For this reason, days that presented an energy balance
    ratio (EBR) of (H + LE) to (Rn − G) between 0.90 and 1.10 were excluded for the
    validation model. Major problems were associated with power failure and 46 days
    were eliminated for the 2-year data set when EBR values were <0.90 or >1.10. Also,
    when 5 or more of the 48 observations were missing, that day of data was excluded.
    If fewer than five observations were missing, data were linearly interpolated
    to complete the time series (Brotzge and Crawford, 2003, Laubach and Teichmann,
    1999). In this case, most of the interpolations were applied during the early
    morning and late afternoon, especially on cloudy days. Data were collected from
    November 15 (Day of year (DOY) 319) 2006 to March 15 (DOY 74) 2007 for the first
    season and October 19 (DOY 292) 2007 to February 28 (DOY 59) 2008 for the second
    season. After data quality control was applied as described above, a total of
    96 days were available for which all energy balance data (Rn, H, LE and G) were
    complete from the experimental site. However, much longer datasets were available
    for Rn, G and meteorological variables. 3.5. Parameterization of available energy
    and resistances The available energy at the crop canopy is computed as: (7) where
    Rn = net radiation above the vineyard canopy (W m−2); G = soil heat flux (W m−2).
    On 30-min intervals, values of Rn were computed as follows (Ortega-Farias et al.,
    2000): (8) where α = albedo; Rsi = incoming solar (short-wave) radiation (W m−2);
    ɛa = atmospheric emissivity; σ = Stefan–Boltzman constant (5.67 × 10−8 W m−2 K−4),
    ɛs = emissivity of the surface (0.98); Ta = air temperature (K); Ts = surface
    temperature (K). In this study, Ts was estimated from measured soil (Tsoil) and
    canopy (Tc) temperatures weighted by fractional area (fc) of vegetation (Norman
    et al., 1995, Ezzahar et al., 2007): (9) where Tsoil and Tc are in Kelvin. The
    fractional area of the vineyard was 0.30 (±0.04) and assumed constant during both
    seasons. Values of ɛa were computed from air temperature and vapor pressure as
    (Brutsaert, 1982): (10) where ew = air vapor pressure (kPa); ϕ = calibration coefficient.
    Values of ϕ were 1.51 for Rsi > 0 and 1.91 for Rsi ≤ 0. These values were suggested
    by Carrasco and Ortega-Farías (2008) for a drip-irrigated Cabernet Sauvignon vineyard
    trained on the VSP system. The soil heat flux was computed as a linear function
    of Rn: (11) The intercept and slope were different from those found by Sene (1994)
    and Yunusa et al. (2004), indicating that a local calibration is necessary to
    get accurate estimates of G on half and hourly basis. It is important to indicate
    that Eq. (11) was obtained using 20 independent days which were randomly selected
    from the two growing seasons. The available energy at the soil surface was computed
    as (12) (13) where Rns = net radiation at the soil surface (W m−2); LAI = leaf
    area index (m2 m−2); C = extinction coefficient of the canopy for net radiation.
    Using daily values of Rns and Rn, the extinction coefficient was estimated as
    0.38 ± 0.05. Many studies have been conducted to estimate stomatal resistance,
    which has been generally expressed as a function of the solar radiation, water
    vapor deficit, air temperature, leaf water potential and soil moisture content
    (Anadranistakis et al., 2000, Kaufmann, 1982, Torula and Heikinheimo, 1998). Using
    the Jarvis approach, values of can be estimated by the following equations (Noilhan
    and Planton, 1989): (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) where F1, F2, F3, and F4 take into
    account the effect of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), vapor pressure
    deficit, air temperature, and soil water stress, respectively. rs min = minimum
    stomatal resistance (s m−1); rs max = maximum stomatal resistance (2000 s m−1);
    Rsl = threshold radiation value above which the stomata open (30 W m−2). The term
    2/LAI expresses the shading between leaves, while the factor 0.55 represents the
    PAR portion of solar radiation flux density. For this study, the daily mean value
    (from 11:00 to 14:00 h) of stomatal resistance and rs min were 216 (±54) and 144
    s m−1, respectively. The daily mean value of rs min was obtained from well-watered
    vines with ψx > −0.5 MPa (Williams and Trout, 2005). The effect of soil water
    stress on canopy resistance was calculated using the normalized soil water (F4)
    (Calvet et al., 1998, Ortega-Farias et al., 2004): (19) where θFC = volumetric
    soil moisture content at field capacity (fraction); θWP = volumetric soil moisture
    content at wilting point (fraction); θi = volumetric soil moisture content in
    the root-zone (fraction). Also, values of are given by: (20) where rb = mean boundary
    layer resistance (25 s m−1) (Shuttleworth and Wallace, 1985). A general description
    of aerodynamic resistance, Cs and Cc is found in Shuttleworth and Wallace (1985)
    and Ortega-Farias et al. (2007). Values of and are estimated by the following
    expressions: (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) where ; ; ; ; x = reference height
    above the crop where meteorological measurements are available (4.7 m); h = canopy
    height (2.0 m); d = zero plane displacement of crop with complete canopy cover
    (0.67 h); zo = roughness length of crop with complete canopy cover (0.05 h); ;
    u = wind speed at the reference height (m s−1); k = von Kármán''s constant (0.41);
    n = eddy diffusivity decay constant in a crop with complete canopy cover (2.5).
    The soil surface is the resistance to water vapor movement from the interior to
    the soil surface and was computed as follows. (27) where ; θg = volumetric soil
    water content in the top layer of soil (0–20 cm); θs = saturated volumetric soil
    water content at the 20 cm depth (0.53 m3 m−3). Eq. (27) (with R2 = 0.67) was
    developed using measurements of E and θg from an independent data set of 20 days.
    In this case, a regression analysis was done between and θs/θg where values were
    obtained by solving Eq. (3). 3.6. Statistical analysis In order to assess the
    validity of the estimation of latent heat flux (or vineyard evapotranspiration),
    as computed from the Shuttleworth and Wallace model, our calculations were compared
    to latent heat flux measured by the eddy-covariance method. Daily and 30-min comparisons
    include the ratio (roe) of observed to estimated values, index of agreement (Ia),
    root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) (Mayer and Butler,
    1993, Willmott, 1981). Also, the Z-test was used to check whether the value of
    roe was significantly different from unity at the 95% confidence level. Similar
    statistical parameters were used to compare the observed and estimated values
    of net radiation on a 30-min and daily basis. 4. Results and discussion Skies
    were mostly clear for both seasons with daily values of Rsi and Rn between 5–35
    MJ m−2 d−1 and 4–19 MJ m−2 d−1, respectively (Fig. 1a and b). Daily mean air temperatures
    were similar during both seasons, but atmospheric conditions during the second
    season were drier than those found during the first season. In this case, maximum
    mean values of D during 2007/2008 were greater than those for 2006/2007 (Fig.
    1e and f). Also, daily mean values of u were 1.9 (±0.6) m s−1 and 0.9 (±0.5) m
    s−1 during 2006/2007 and 2007/2008, respectively (Fig. 1g and h). In both seasons,
    the top layer of soil (0–20 cm) was very dry where daily mean value of soil evaporation
    was 0.8 (±0.2) mm d−1 during the first season and 0.5 (±0.1) mm d−1 during the
    second season, according to measurements of the microlysimeters. Using the same
    measurements, Ortega-Farias et al. (2008) indicated that SW model predicted soil
    evaporation (Eq. (3)) with RMSE of 0.2 mm d−1 and vine transpiration measured
    by the sapflow method accounted for 75–80% of ETv obtained by the EC system. It
    is important to indicate that no rainfall was observed during this study and wetted
    area of the drip-irrigated vineyard was only about 3%. Rainfall amounts from DOY
    295 to DOY 62 in the first and second seasons were 34.4 and 11.6 mm, respectively.

    speed (u) for the 2006/2007 and 2007/2008 growing seasons. Energy balance closure
    was evaluated using a linear regression between turbulent energy fluxes (H + LE)
    and available energy (Rn − G) (Wilson et al., 2002, Laubach and Teichmann, 1999)
    (Fig. 2). The linear regression between (H + LE) and (Rn − G) was similar for
    the 2006/2007 and 2007/2008 seasons with an overall value of R2 equal to 0.96.
    The overall analysis of the selected days indicates that the intercept (15 W m−2)
    was statistically equal to zero and slope (0.96) was significantly different from
    unity, indicating that turbulent energy fluxes were lower than available energy
    by about 4%. These results indicate that the eddy-covariance method was providing
    accurate estimates of LE and H on the selected days during both seasons (Spano
    et al., 2000, Ortega-Farias et al., 2007). Also, Oliver and Sene (1992) found
    daily ratios of turbulent energy fluxes to available energy in the range of 0.9–1.2
    with average values of about 1.06 for a non-irrigated Airen vineyard. For the
    2-year data set, average values of daytime and nighttime energy balance closure
    were 15 (±40) and 18 (±15) W m−2, respectively. However, R2 value was 0.27 for
    nighttime fluxes indicating that EC measurements were erratic. Fortunately, the
    average value of (Rn − G) during nighttime was −26 (±15) W m−2 which is within
    sensor accuracy. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. A regression analysis

    the 1:1 line. Values of ψx ranged from −0.5 to −0.9 MPa and from −0.4 to −1.0
    MPa for the 2006/2007 and the 2007/2008 season, respectively (Fig. 3). These values
    indicate that the Merlot vineyard was well irrigated and vine water status was
    adequate during both simulation periods (Williams and Trout, 2005). In this study,
    irrigation started on 08 November 2006 (DOY 312) in the first season and 19 November
    2007 (DOY 323) in the second season when the soil water content reached a value
    near MAD (F4 = 0.5) (Fig. 3). Using this irrigation strategy, the normalized soil
    water content (F4) during both seasons was between 0.35 and 0.83 (Fig. 3) and
    the Merlot vineyard received a seasonal irrigation amount of 224 mm and 215 mm
    for 2006/2007 and 2007/2008, respectively. The lowest values of F4 (0.34) and
    ψx (−1.0 MPa) were observed between 16 and 20 January 2008 (Fig. 3b) where water
    application was reduced because of pump malfunction. During both seasons, LAI
    was less than 0.8 m2 m−2 from DOY 292 to DOY 365 after which LAI was kept almost
    constant, between 1.0 and 1.22 m2 m−2, until harvest by mechanical trimming (Fig.
    4). Under these irrigation and canopy managements, daily mean values of canopy
    resistance (Eq. (13)) ranged between 250 and 567 s m−1 for LAI < 1.0 m2 m−2 and
    between 131 and 250 s m−1 for LAI > 1.0 (Fig. 4). Download : Download full-size

    to 15:00 h) and leaf area index (LAI) for a drip-irrigated Merlot vineyard. Fig.
    5 shows that daily values of Rn and Rso accounted for 37–57 and 16–21% of Rsi,
    respectively, during both simulation periods. For these periods, a daily mean
    albedo of 0.19 was used to compute daytime variation of net radiation (Eq. (8)).
    Pieri and Gaudillère (2003) indicated that vineyard albedo depends on the geometrical
    dimensions (ratio of row spacing (R) to canopy height (r)), shape of rows, and
    row azimuth. These authors computed an α value = 0.20 for a traditional vineyard
    in Bordeaux (one single vertical plane of foliage of nearly rectangular shape)
    with a ratio of R to r equal to 1.1. For a non-irrigated Airen vineyard grown
    on free standing bushes, Sene (1994) indicated that daily mean albedo was 0.27
    and hourly average values dropped as low as 0.18. For an Italian vineyard grown
    on a trellis system, Vieira de Azevedo et al. (1997) found that daily mean values
    of albedo changed from 0.18 in the first days after bud shooting to 0.23 after
    blooming, falling to 0.20 in the period of fruit development. Also, Fig. 5 shows
    that the mean ratio of G to Rn was less than 0.026, indicating that soil heat
    flux did not significantly affect the vineyard energy balance on a daily basis.
    Similarly, Yunusa et al. (2004) and Trambouze et al. (1998) on Sultana and Shiraz
    vineyards, respectively, indicated that daily G accounted for 8–11% of Rn. On
    the other hand, Heilman et al. (1996) reported that G was about 29% of Rn for
    a Chardonnay vineyard. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Daily ratios
    of outgoing solar radiation (Rso) and net radiation (Rn) to incoming solar radiation
    (Rsi) for a drip-irrigated Merlot vineyard. Also, daily ratio of soil heat flux
    (G) to Rno are included. Results indicate that there was good agreement between
    observed (Rno) and estimated (Rne) values of net radiation during both the 2006/2007
    and 2007/2008 season with similar values of RMSE, MAE, and Ia (Table 1). On a
    30-min basis, overall values of Ia, RMSE and MAE were 0.99, 33 W m−2 and 24 W
    m−2, respectively. The Z-test indicated that the value of roe was not significantly
    different from 1.0, suggesting that values of Rne and Rno were similar. However,
    Fig. 6 indicates that the Rn model tended to overestimate for Rno > 600 W m−2
    and underestimate for Rno < 200 W m−2, especially during the second season. Daily
    comparison indicated that Rn model during 2007/2008 presented a better performance
    than that during 2006/2007 season (Table 1). Major departures from the 1:1 line
    were observed on cloudy days that presented daily values of net radiation less
    than 6 MJ m−2 d−1 (or 2.4 mm d−1) (Fig. 7a). The greater disagreements were observed
    on DOY 74, which presented a Rn/Rsi ratio of 0.54. On this day, maximum difference
    between Rne and Rno were 105 W m−2 and 5 MJ m−2 d−1 on a 30-min and daily basis,

    analysis indicates that the model was able to simulate daily net radiation with
    overall values of RMSE and MAE equal to 1.3 and 0.95 MJ m−2 d−1, respectively.
    For both simulation periods, the roe values were statistically different from
    1.0 suggesting that the model underestimated net radiation with an error of 6%.
    Similar results have been reported by Carrasco and Ortega-Farías (2008) in a drip-irrigated
    Cabernet Sauvignon vineyard, where the Rn model showed the largest errors under
    cloudy atmospheric conditions with maximum MAE and RMSE values equivalent to 40
    and 61 W m−2, respectively. According to Brotzge and Deuchon (2000) and Brotzge
    and Crawford (2003), the probable causes of potential errors in the estimation
    of Rn on cloudy days were associated with the parameterization of the air emissivity,
    which depends on vapor pressure and air temperature at the reference level. Also,
    Ezzahar et al. (2007) and Ortega-Farias et al. (2000) indicated that the use of
    the Brutsaert''s formula may create an important scatter for low values of net
    radiation. A good comparison between observed (LEo) and estimated (LEe) values
    of LE was observed for the Merlot vineyard during the 2006/2007 and 2007/2008
    seasons (Fig. 8). Similar values of Ia, RMSE and MAE were found for both simulation
    periods, but the roe value for 2006/2007 was lower than that for 2007/2008 (Table
    2). Results of the Z-test indicate that roe value was significantly different
    from 1.0, suggesting that the SW model tended to underestimate and overestimate
    during the first and second season, respectively. The overall analysis indicated
    that the SW model overestimated latent heat flux with RMSE and MAE by 34 and 21
    W m−2, respectively. On a daily basis, the performance of the SW model was similar
    during the two seasons with RMSE values< 0.55 mm d−1 (Table 2). The overall analysis
    suggested that the SW model was able to simulate ETv with Ia and RMSE of 0.88
    and 0.51 mm d−1 (1.25 MJ m−2 d−1), respectively. It is important to indicate that
    differences between Rno and Rne did not significantly affect the performance of
    the SW model for simulating ETv on cloudy days (Fig. 7). For cloudy days, observed
    (LEo) and estimated (LEe) values of LE were less than 100 W m−2 (Fig. 9a and b)
    and the SW model was able to predict ETv with RMSE values less than 15 W m−2.
    Fig. 9c and d illustrates that values of Rno were greater than those of Rne during
    nighttime and daytime, but differences between estimated (ETve) and observed values
    (ETvo) of vineyard evapotranspiration were 0.5 and 0.35 mm d−1 for DOY 74 and
    DOY 361, respectively. Also, values of turbulent energy fluxes and available energy
    were very close and albedo ranged between 0.17 and 0.21 from 11:00 to 14:00 h.

    best agreement between LEo and LEe was observed on DOY 40 (2007/2008) (Fig. 10b),
    where the maximum values of Ta and D were 28 °C and 2.61 kPa, respectively. Also,
    the daily Rn/Rsi ratio was 0.48 and albedo ranged between 0.17 and 0.20 from 10:00
    to 18:00 h. On DOY 40, the roe was not significantly different from unity, indicating
    that values of LEo were similar to those of LEe. In this case, RMSE and MAE values
    were less than 20 W m−2. Fig. 10d indicates that Rno and Rne presented a similar
    pattern during the day, but values of Rne were greater than those of Rno from
    13:00 to 15:00 h. Also, values of turbulent energy fluxes (H + LEo) were close
    to available energy (Rno − Go) during daytime and nighttime with value of energy
    balance residue (Reb = Rno − Go − H − LEo) ranging between −53 and 58 W m−2 (Fig.
    10f). On DOY 40, daily values of ETvo and ETve were 3.4 and 3.5 mm d−1, respectively
    and accounted for 58% of Rn. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10. Observed
    (o) and estimated (e) values of latent heat flux (LE), net radiation (Rno), soil
    heat flux (Go) for clear days. The turbulent energy fluxes (H + LEo), available
    energy (Rno − Go), incoming solar radiation (Rsi), and albedo are included for
    a reference. Greatest disagreements between LEo and LEe were observed on DOY 363
    (Fig. 10a) where the SW model tended to underestimate latent heat flux over the
    Merlot vineyard under clear sky conditions (Rn/Rsi ratio = 0.55 and albedo = 0.19).
    Under these conditions, the maximum values of Ta and D were 31.2 °C and 2.94 kPa,
    respectively (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). Also, soil surface on DOY 363 was wetted by rainfall
    (17.2 mm) observed on DOY 358. Major disagreements were observed between 12:00
    and 20:00 h, where values of u were between 4.7 and 7.1 m s−1 (Fig. 1g). RMSE
    value was 102 W m−2 with a maximum difference between LEo and LEe of 197 W m−2.
    Daily values of ETvo and ETve were 5.1 and 3.7 mm d−1, respectively, for the vineyard
    with a midday stem water potential of −0.59 MPa. Also, a good energy balance closure
    was observed on DOY 363 where daytime values of Rne and Rno were similar, except
    at midday. In general, the greatest disagreements were observed on clear days
    after rainfall, especially under high atmospheric demand for water vapor. A similar
    study was done by Ortega-Farias et al. (2007) who indicated that the SW model
    was able to simulate latent heat flux (LE) over a drip-irrigated Cabernet Sauvignon
    vineyard under dry atmospheric conditions with a root mean square error (RMSE)
    and mean absolute error (MAE) of 29 and 22 W m−2, respectively. Also, this study
    indicated that the SW model was very sensitive to errors in leaf area index and
    mean stomatal resistance, but it was not affected by errors in the estimation
    of aerodynamic resistances. Recently, Zhang et al. (2008) indicated that the SW
    model simulated LE over a furrow-irrigated vineyard (fc = 0.35) with MAE of 39
    W m−2. In this study, the parameterization for the SW model was so well defined
    that, under dry soil conditions, the only input data required were direct measurements
    of climatic variables (Ta, u, RHa and Rsi), soil water content and leaf area index.
    It is important to acknowledge that the parameterization of Rn, G, and depend
    on the training system, irrigation system and vine water status. The training
    system affects the vine vigor which is manifested through the canopy size, leaf
    area index (LAI), and fraction of soil surface covered by vegetation (fc). Therefore
    training systems have a substantial effect on soil energy balances, mainly by
    changing the partitioning of vineyard net radiation into its soil and canopy components
    (Heilman et al., 1996). According to canopy structure and vegetation coverage,
    sensible heat flux (H) generated at the soil surface can be a major contributor
    to the vineyard energy balance which plays a key role in vine transpiration and
    evaporation. For the drip-irrigated Merlot vineyard, canopy cover was generally
    incomplete as a result of the regimented structure imposed by the VSP system.
    This training system consists of widely spaced vines that allow for deep penetration
    of sunlight and air turbulence into the canopy. A constant shape of the canopy
    (a parallelepiped) was maintained with LAI ranging between 0.8 and 1.22 m2 m−2and
    fc values of 0.3 (±0.04) during the two growing seasons, especially after full
    bloom. Under this constant shape, daily ratios of Rso to Rsi were quite constant
    (α = 0.19 ± 0.023), allowing a good performance of the Rn model during the two
    study periods. Also, during these two seasons, the top layer of soil (0–20 cm)
    was very dry and soil surface wetted by drip emitters was 3%. Under this canopy
    and soil water conditions, the soil contribution to the vineyard energy balance
    is considerable, especially under high atmospheric demand for water vapor. Under
    these atmospheric conditions, soil surfaces of a drip-irrigated vineyard could
    produce more sensible heat flux than that of a flood-irrigated vineyard because
    wetted surfaces are less than 3% of the total area of the vineyard. Consequently,
    soil heating that increases H depends on training and irrigation system. The parameterization
    of Rn, G, and seems adequate for the drip-irrigated Merlot vineyard trained on
    VSP, but further study is required for overhead systems (fc = 1) that completely
    shade the ground. In this case, the vineyard canopy of the overhead system behaves
    as a big-leaf and a one-layer model such as Penman–Monteith could be applied to
    simulate ETv (Rana and Katerji, 2008). Finally, values of midday steam water potential
    indicated that the Merlot vineyard was well irrigated during both simulation periods.
    Under these conditions, the Jarvis model, without any local calibration, seems
    correct for the unstressed Merlot vines. However, a calibration of Javis model
    could be required for vineyards under moderate or severe water stress. 5. Conclusions
    The SW model was successfully validated with LE and ETv measured from an eddy
    correlation system installed over a drip-irrigated Merlot vineyard under well-irrigated
    conditions. In this regard, the SW model simulated latent heat flux at 30-min
    intervals with a RMSE and MAE of 34 and 21 W m−2, respectively. For the vineyard
    evapotranspiration, RMSE was 0.51 mm d−1 and MAE was 0.41 mm d−1. In addition,
    the index of agreement was 97% and 88% for LE and ETv, respectively. These results
    suggest that it is possible to directly estimate ETv using meteorological information
    in combination with soil moisture measurements. However, It is important to acknowledge
    that the parameterization of SW model depends on the training system, irrigation
    system and vine water status. Future research will be centered on the effect of
    the training system and vine water status on the parameterization of Rn, G, and
    . Also, we will explore the application of remote sensing to simulate the ground
    surface area cover which depends on vine vigor and canopy geometry. Acknowledgements

    Abstract: The forthcoming two-satellite GMES Sentinel-1 constellation is expected
    to render systematic surface soil moisture retrieval at 1 km resolution using
    C-band SAR data possible for the first time from space. Owing to the constellation''s
    foreseen coverage over the Sentinel-1 Land Masses acquisition region-global approximately
    every six days, nearly daily over Europe and Canada depending on latitude-in the
    high spatial and radiometric resolution Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) mode,
    the Sentinel-1 mission shows high potential for global monitoring of surface soil
    moisture by means of fully automatic retrieval techniques. This paper presents
    the potential for providing such a service systematically over Land Masses and
    in near real time using a change detection approach, concluding that such a service
    is-subject to the mission operating as foreseen-expected to be technically feasible.
    The work presented in this paper was carried out as a feasibility study within
    the framework of the ESA-funded GMES Sentinel-1 Soil Moisture Algorithm Development
    (S1-SMAD) project. Published in: IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth

    Publisher: IEEE SECTION I. Introduction The Sentinel-1 mission is a part of the
    Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) program of the European
    Space Agency (ESA) and the European Commission (EC) and is intended to provide
    continuous global all-weather, day-and-night radar imaging in support of GMES
    applications [1]. This paper presents the potential for a systematic global near-real-time
    (NRT) surface soil moisture (SSM) retrieval service over the Sentinel-1 Land Masses
    acquisition region at 1 km resolution using C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR)
    data acquired in Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) mode by the forthcoming two-satellite
    Sentinel-1 constellation, by means of a change detection approach. This work was
    carried out as a feasibility study within the framework of the ESA-funded GMES
    Sentinel-1 Soil Moisture Algorithm Development (S1-SMAD) project. Soil moisture
    is a key parameter in the global water, energy and carbon cycles [2], [3]. Accordingly,
    it is an important factor in a variety of Earth sciences, including hydrology,
    meteorology, climatology and agronomy. Studies dealing with coarse-resolution
    (25–50 km) soil moisture data have already shown the high potential of ingesting
    such products in support of, e.g., numerical weather prediction [4], climate monitoring
    [5] and flood forecasting [6], [7]. Products at 1 km resolution are expected to
    prove useful in still more applications, including monitoring of agricultural
    yield at field level, catchment-scale hydrologic process studies and irrigation
    management. Soil moisture can be measured accurately at point scale using in situ
    techniques [8], with new approaches such as smart sensor webs [9] potentially
    opening the door to capturing area-representative measurements in a more cost-effective
    manner. Moreover, international efforts to collect and harmonize soil moisture
    network data from around the world [10], [11] have greatly enhanced the availability
    and accessibility of in situ soil moisture measurements. Nevertheless, in situ
    measurements from sparse networks may not necessarily be representative of their
    respective surrounding areas, and funding for such networks has undergone cutbacks
    in many regions most adversely affected by changes in the availability of fresh
    water resources [12], [13]. Alternatively, soil moisture can be measured at a
    variety of spatial and temporal scales using remote sensing techniques [14], with
    microwave instruments operated at frequencies below the relaxation frequency of
    water molecules (9 GHz near 0°C and 17 GHz at 20°C) holding the greatest potential
    on account of the magnitude of the dielectric contrast between wet and dry soil
    at those frequencies. The magnitude of the soil’s dielectric constant ε , in turn,
    strongly influences the intensity of the radar backscattering coefficient σ 0
    , which is known to grow monotonically with increasing soil moisture content [15],
    [16]. In the last decade, soil moisture measurements derived from spaceborne microwave
    radiometers and scatterometers at coarse spatial scales (25–50 km), including
    MetOp ASCAT [17], AMSR-E [18]–[20], Windsat [21] and SMOS [22], have increasingly
    become available to the user community [23]. The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity
    (SMOS) satellite, which carries a radiometer operated at L-band, was launched
    in 2009 and is notably the first satellite specialized specifically for the retrieval
    of soil moisture. SMOS provides soil moisture data at a spatial resolution in
    the order of 35–50 km. At the present time, only active microwave instruments
    providing sub-antenna footprint resolution by means of range and Doppler discrimination
    [24] can provide measurements from space at finer spatial scales (resolutions
    of 10 km and finer). Examples include the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR)
    instrument onboard the Envisat platform [25] and the SAR instrument onboard the
    forthcoming Sentinel-1 satellite, both of which operate at C-band. Another example
    is the forthcoming Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite [26], which carries
    a conically scanning microwave instrument operating at L-band and is expected
    to be launched in the 2014–2015 timeframe. Soil moisture retrieval using active
    microwave data is a challenge on account of the confounding influence of the geometric
    and dielectric properties of the Earth’s surface on the backscattered signal [27].
    An exact signal decomposition could in theory be obtained by solving Maxwell’s
    equations, with recent advances in computational electromagnetics allowing for
    finding numerical solutions to Maxwell’s equations even for three-dimensional
    problems [28]. Even so, signal inversion techniques will always require that simplifying
    assumptions be made, particularly if the soil moisture retrieval is to be carried
    out on a global scale. As the impact of simplifying assumptions on the ability
    of the retrieval model to correctly describe the physical measurement process
    is, in general, not adequately understood, it is not possible a priori to predict
    which soil moisture retrieval approach will perform best in the context of the
    Sentinel-1 mission. Once the mission is rendered operational, different retrieval
    approaches—e.g., analytical inversion of empirical models, iterative least squares
    matching using semi-empirical forward models, lookup tables, Bayesian approaches,
    possibilistic methods, or neural networks trained with theoretical models—ought
    to be evaluated in order to identify the most robust and accurate approach [29],
    [30]. In this paper, a change detection model developed and already extensively
    tested in a SAR context using the Global Monitoring (GM) mode of the ASAR instrument
    onboard the Envisat platform [31], [32] is adopted. Underlying change detection
    techniques is the assumption that the backscatter cross-section over soil surfaces
    across short time scales changes primarily on account of variations in soil moisture,
    while surface roughness and vegetation vary more slowly [33]. The TU Wien method
    is a change detection approach originally developed for the ERS scatterometer
    at a spatial resolution of 50 km [34]–[36], later adapted to MetOp ASCAT at 25
    km [17] and Envisat ASAR GM mode at 1 km [32], respectively. The method has been
    extensively validated using in situ measurements, modeled soil moisture data and
    other satellite-based retrievals, with retrieval accuracies approaching the accuracy
    goals of SMOS and SMAP; see, e.g., [37] for results obtained for the ERS scatterometer,
    [38] for ASCAT and [39] for ASAR GM mode. Even more recent validation studies
    using ASCAT and SMOS suggest that the ASCAT change detection approach gives retrievals
    comparable to—and in some regions even slightly better than—the SMOS Level 2 algorithm
    [40], [41]. The ASCAT Level 2 surface soil moisture product is distributed operationally
    by EUMETSAT in NRT, within 130 minutes of acquisition. The proposed NRT SSM retrieval
    algorithm for Sentinel-1 in IW mode is an adaptation of the TU Wien method most
    closely akin with the method’s earlier adaptation to Envisat ASAR GM mode [32].
    Among the ASAR modes, GM mode offers the best balance between radiometric, spatial
    and temporal resolution in support of change detection-driven SSM retrieval. With
    ASAR GM mode data at 1 km resolution provided at a radiometric resolution of 1.2
    dB, the quality of SSM retrieval is expected to benefit considerably from the
    foreseen radiometric resolution of Sentinel-1 IW mode, which is expected to be
    in the order of 0.05–0.07 dB when aggregated to a spatial resolution of 1 km.
    The temporal resolution of the Sentinel-1 constellation in IW mode over the Land
    Masses acquisition region—with an outlook to coverage every six days globally
    and nearly daily over Europe and Canada depending on latitude [42]—is, likewise,
    expected to contribute favorably to calibration of the TU Wien model, vis-à-vis
    what has been possible with data acquired in Envisat ASAR GM mode. User requirements
    for a systematic global NRT SSM retrieval service are reasonably well known, owing
    to the proliferation in availability of soil moisture products over the past decade.
    Requirements common to operational users are: (i) high temporal resolution, (ii)
    long-term availability of the SSM data, (iii) availability of SSM time series
    for user model calibration (at least one year), (iv) well-known spatio-temporal
    error characterization, and (v) free and easy access. In the following section,
    a review of attributes of the Sentinel-1 mission relevant to the retrieval of
    surface soil moisture is given, with Section III presenting the adaptation of
    the TU Wien method for Sentinel-1 accordingly. Section IV discusses the processing
    chain of the proposed NRT SSM retrieval software (S2M-NRT), as implemented within
    the framework of the S1-SMAD project, which runs on model parameters computed
    in non-NRT by the so-called reprocessing facility (S2M-RF). The processing chain
    of the proposed S2M-RF is taken up in Section V. In support of evaluating processor
    timeliness for delivery of SSM products in NRT, Section VI provides a runtime
    analysis of the S2M-NRT software demonstrator implemented within the framework
    of the S1-SMAD project on simulated Sentinel-1 input data. SECTION II. Sentinel-1
    The space segment of the GMES Sentinel-1 mission is expected to consist of at
    least two identical near-polar sun-synchronous orbiting satellites, each at a
    mean altitude of 693 km and equipped with a C-band SAR instrument operating at
    a center frequency of 5.405 GHz with support for HH-HV and VV-VH simultaneous
    co- and cross-polarization receive channels. The first of the satellite pair,
    Sentinel-1A, is expected to be launched in 2013, with the launch of its sister
    satellite Sentinel-1B foreseen 18 months thereafter. The two satellites are each
    designed for a nominal lifetime of 7 years, extendable to 12 [43]. A. Acquisition
    Strategy In support of interferometric applications, the reference orbit of both
    satellites is expected to be maintained within the same Earth-fixed orbital tube
    radius of 50 meter-rms for the duration of the mission’s nominal lifetime. In
    the aim of satisfying the constraints imposed by the mission’s observation requirements,
    overlap between data takes within an orbit cycle is minimized. Moreover, data
    takes are expected to match closely across cycles with respect to length, acquisition
    mode and relative ordering within the cycle—yielding predictable acquisition geometry
    and spatial coverage—unless acquisitions are made within the framework of the
    GMES Emergency Management Service (EMS) [43]. A total of four acquisition regions
    have been defined in the published Sentinel-1 Payload Data Ground Segment (PDGS)
    documentation, with each Sentinel-1 nominal imaging mode operated over a specific
    set of regions. These four acquisition regions are Arctic/Antarctic, Maritime
    Transport Zones (MTZs), Land Masses and Ocean [44]. The Sentinel-1 constellation
    is expected to cover Land Masses globally every six days, with nearly daily coverage
    foreseen over Europe and Canada [42]. B. Characteristic Local Incidence Angles
    A consequence of the stability of the acquisition strategy is the stability of
    the acquisition geometry across orbit cycles. Accordingly, it is expected—in stark
    contrast to, e.g., Envisat ASAR—that any single point on the Earth’s surface will
    be acquired at effectively one of a finite set of respective so-called characteristic
    local incidence angles. This number is expected to range from as few as one at
    the equator to as many as three at the poles. The set of characteristic local
    incidence angles associated with any point on the Earth’s surface can be determined,
    respectively, by means of orbit simulation once the starting point of the orbit
    is known. C. Systematic NRT Processing Over Land Masses In support of satisfying
    timeliness requirements, baseline Sentinel-1 NRT products are expected to be processed—in
    partially overlapping slices of configurable length—directly at the Core Ground
    Stations (CGSs) to which the corresponding raw data is downlinked. Such data is
    subject to an NRT-first downlink strategy, with maximum onboard data latency kept
    under one orbit. NRT products are expected to be made available within 3 hours
    of sensing in general, and within 1 hour if acquired within the visibility of
    a CGS. However, systematic processing in NRT within the framework of the Sentinel-1
    core PDGS at the CGSs is foreseen only over the Arctic/Antarctic, MTZs and Ocean
    acquisition regions. In contrast to baseline NRT products, baseline products with
    less stringent timeliness requirements—in particular those generated from data
    acquired over Land Masses—are expected to be processed at associated Processing
    and Archiving Centers (PACs), with an aim to keeping onboard data latency under
    two orbits [44]. Downlinked data from such data takes is expected to typically
    be split over different stations or over different passes. In general, it is not
    expected that it will be possible to process such downlinked partial data takes
    on an individual basis, since a partial data take might be too short or might
    fail to include internal calibration information [43]. Non-NRT baseline Level0
    products are accordingly expected to be processed over the entirety of their respective
    data takes, upon completion of an assembly stage. Baseline non-NRT products are
    expected to be made available within 24 hours of acquisition. The so-called collaborative
    PDGS of the Sentinel-1 mission is expected to provide a mechanism for augmenting
    the timeliness of the core PDGS—for instance by allowing systematic NRT processing
    over the Land Masses acquisition region—by adding appropriately equipped Local
    Ground Stations (LGSs) to the ground station network. Moreover, the collaborative
    PDGS is expected to allow for the integration of so-called hosted user processors,
    such as an implementation of the S2M-NRT. In support of processing and disseminating
    SSM products in NRT, the SSM retrieval processor would accordingly have to be
    run at the LGS level within the framework of the collaborative PDGS, alongside
    DEM geocoding and radiometric calibration in NRT of data acquired over Land Masses.
    Such geocoding and calibration of Level 0 products is not expected to impact NRT
    timeliness, since calibration and geocoding parameters can be known a priori in
    view of the foreseen stability of the mission’s acquisition geometry. D. Interferometric
    Wide Swath Mode Sentinel-1 SAR instrument data can be acquired in any one of four
    exclusive nominal imaging modes, namely in the low bit rate Wave (WV) mode or
    in the high bit rate StripMap (SM), Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) or Extra Wide
    Swath (EW) modes, respectively. The Land Masses acquisition region is expected
    to be acquired in IW mode by default, with the SM and EW modes available for emerging
    user requests and for continuity with the earlier ERS and Envisat missions. Level
    0 IW mode data is expected to be provided at a single-look spatial resolution
    of 5 × 20 m, acquired across an incidence angle range of 30–45 degrees and over
    a swath width of 250 km. Upon downlink, raw IW mode data is expected to be systematically
    processed in non-NRT—as part of the baseline—up to Level 1 multi-looked Ground
    Range Detected (GRD) products in Medium Resolution (MR) at 88 × 89 m and High
    Resolution (HR) at 20 × 22 m, respectively, by the core PDGS. Systematic generation
    in NRT of DEM-geocoded IW mode GRD products at 1 km resolution over the Land Masses
    acquisition region is foreseen as a potential hosted user product [43], within
    the framework of the collaborative PDGS. Aggregated to 1 km, the radiometric resolution
    of data acquired in IW mode is expected to lie in the order of 0.05–0.07 dB. E.
    Data Volumes and Archiving Taking into account only a single Sentinel-1 satellite,
    total data volumes for only Level 0 data across all acquisition regions are expected
    to reach ca. 320 TB per annum, amounting to ca. 2.3 PB (petabytes) in the course
    of 7.5 years [44]. Level 0 products are expected to contain the Flexible Dynamic
    Block Adaptive Quantization (FDBAQ)-compressed [45] raw instrument source packet
    data alongside annotations in support of subsequent calibration and post-processing.
    Availability of archived Level 0 products is foreseen for 25 years following the
    end of the space segment operations [43], with the most accurate version of the
    antenna pattern expected to be made available—in the form of annotation data—within
    two weeks of acquisition. Total Level 1 data volumes for baseline products are
    expected to be 4–5 times larger than those for Level 0. Accordingly, it is foreseen
    that within the framework of the core PDGS, Level 1 data will be generated on
    the fly as needed, rather than undergo systematic archiving. Again owing to the
    steady acquisition geometry, these sizable data volumes are not expected to impact
    NRT timeliness. SECTION III. The TU Wien Method for Sentinel-1 The TU Wien backscatter
    model expresses backscatter measurements σ 0 (θ,t) [dB], where θ [deg] and t are
    the local incidence angle (LIA) and time, respectively, at which the measurement
    was acquired, in terms of empirical model parameters and the degree of surface
    soil water saturation m s (t)∈[0,1] , which gives the volume of water present
    in the soil relative to the volume of the soil’s pores [46]. Adapting the TU Wien
    backscatter model—originally developed for the ERS scatterometer at 50 km [34]–[36]
    and later modified for MetOp ASCAT at 25 km [17]—to 1 km DEM-geocoded Envisat
    ASAR GM mode data, σ 0 (θ,t) is decomposed according to σ 0 (θ,t)= σ 0 dry (30)+β(θ−30)+S
    m s (t) (1) View Source where σ 0 dry (30) [dB] is the dry reference at a reference
    local incidence angle of 30°, S [dB] is the sensitivity of σ 0 to changes in surface
    soil moisture and β [dB/deg] is termed the slope [32]. The dry reference is assumed
    to correspond closely with the soil wilting point. The slope β —which accounts
    for the incidence angle dependency of backscatter measurements—is estimated from
    the slope of the line of best fit in a least squares sense to a long time series
    of DEM-geocoded backscatter measurements σ 0 in dB plotted as a function of local
    incidence angle θ , noting that this dependency is approximately linear in the
    incidence angle range of 20° to 40° of ASAR GM mode [32]. A backscatter measurement
    σ 0 (θ,t) is normalized to the reference angle of 30° according to σ 0 (30,t)=
    σ 0 (θ,t)−β(θ−30). (2) View Source By reorganizing the terms in (1) and plugging
    in (2), the degree of surface soil water saturation m s (t) is given by m s (t)=
    σ 0 (30,t)− σ 0 dry (30) S . (3) View Source The Sentinel-1 mission is expected
    to feature an acquisition strategy such that backscatter measurements for any
    point on the Earth’s surface be acquired at up to only three respective characteristic
    local incidence angles (up to three at high latitudes, as few as one along the
    equator), for acquisitions not made within the framework of the GMES Emergency
    Management Service (EMS) [43]. Accordingly, normalization as carried out in (2)
    is rendered neither possible in general nor necessary in practice. Let Θ( σ 0
    ) be the set of characteristic local incidence angles θ char available at the
    location corresponding to the backscatter measurement σ 0 (θ,t) . A local incidence
    angle θ at which a backscatter measurement σ 0 (θ,t) was acquired is defined to
    correspond to a characteristic local incidence angle θ char ∈Θ( σ 0 ) if θ char
    minimizes abs(θ− θ char ) over the available characteristic local incidence angles
    in Θ( σ 0 ) , subject to the condition that abs(θ− θ char )<T , for some tight
    angular threshold T . The proposed adaptation of the TU Wien backscatter model
    presented in (1) to the context of the Sentinel-1 mission is given by σ 0 (θ,t)=
    σ 0 dry ( θ char )+S m s (t) (4) View Source where θ is understood to correspond
    to θ char . Accordingly, surface soil water saturation m s (t) for Sentinel-1
    is retrieved according to m s (t)= σ 0 (θ,t)− σ 0 dry ( θ char ) S . (5) View
    Source The sensitivity S to changes in surface soil moisture is estimated by the
    observed dynamic range σ 0 wet ( θ char )− σ 0 dry ( θ char ) of the backscatter
    measurements at the location under consideration, where σ 0 wet ( θ char ) is
    the wet reference at θ char . Analogously to the dry reference, the wet reference
    is assumed to correspond closely with the soil saturation point. A. Model Parameter
    Retrieval The respective references with respect to characteristic local incidence
    angle θ char could be obtained and stored per gridpoint of a global grid at 1
    km resolution according to σ 0 wet ( θ char )= 1 N wet ∑ i=N− N wet N wet σ 0
    i ( θ char ) (6) View Source and σ 0 dry ( θ char )= 1 N dry ∑ i=1 N dry σ 0 i
    ( θ char ) (7) View Source where the N available measurements σ 0 i at the gridpoint
    under consideration are understood to be sorted in ascending order and N wet and
    N dry serve only to robustify the resulting references with respect to outliers.
    N wet and N dry are derived according to statistical methods akin to [32], i.e.,
    by taking into account the proportion of SSM measurements for which m s >0.95
    and m s <0.05 , respectively, obtained over recent years. Until an adequate number
    of 1 km Sentinel-1 IW mode GRD measurements are judged to be available, the references
    could be bootstrapped using Envisat ASAR GM mode Level 1b data at 1 km and subsequently
    normalized to the appropriate characteristic local incidence angles θ char , respectively.
    B. Retrieval Error Model The SSM retrieval error is determined by the noise of
    the Sentinel-1 SAR instrument in IW mode and the respective uncertainties of the
    model parameters. Denoting the noise of Sentinel-1 IW mode GRD σ 0 measurements
    by Δ σ 0 and the errors of the corresponding model parameters σ 0 dry and σ 0
    wet by Δ σ 0 dry and Δ σ 0 wet , respectively, the retrieval error Δ m s of m
    s can be estimated by means of Gaussian error propagation with respect to (5)
    according to Δ m 2 s ≈ ( Δ σ 0 S ) 2 + ( ( m s −1)Δ σ 0 dry S ) 2 + ( m s Δ σ
    0 wet S ) 2 (8) View Source where Δ σ 0 is set to 0.1 dB (rather than to the anticipated
    0.05–0.07 dB radiometric resolution of IW mode at 1 km) in order to render the
    model more conservative as a first estimate. Following the reasoning in [32],
    and assuming that the errors Δ σ 0 dry and Δ σ 0 wet are 5% of the observed dynamic
    range S of the backscatter measurements, i.e., Δ σ 0 dry =Δ σ 0 wet =0.05 S ,
    the maximum retrieval error Δ m s,max is given by Δ m s,max ≈ ( 0.1 S ) 2 +0.0025
    − − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ . (9) View Source While for Sentinel-1 this error
    model may still be subject to refinement in the future, its adaptation to Envisat
    ASAR GM mode has already proven useful for predicting the root mean square error
    (RMSE) and correlation between SSM data derived from ASAR GM mode and soil moisture
    data simulated by hydrological models [47]. SECTION IV. NRT SSM Retrieval The
    processing chain of the proposed data-driven NRT SSM retrieval processor (S2M-NRT)
    is depicted in Fig. 1. Starting with a 1 minute DEM-geocoded GRD slice at 1 km
    resolution acquired in IW mode, the S2M-NRT processor identifies the requisite
    model parameters corresponding to the geocoded slice. These model parameters—pre-computed
    in non-NRT by the reprocessing facility—are stored at regularly spaced gridpoints
    and indexed by characteristic local incidence angle θ char . The S2M-NRT software
    demonstrator written within the framework of the S1-SMAD project stores those
    gridpoints in the form of a regular tiling of the plate carrée projection. Accordingly,
    once the requisite tiles have been identified, they are retrieved from the parameter
    database in which they are stored, the appropriate set of parameters they contain
    (according to respective corresponding characteristic local incidence angles)
    are mosaicked, and those mosaics are then resampled to the grid of the geocoded
    input slice. With input backscatter measurements σ 0 and corresponding wet and
    dry references, respectively, all in the same grid, surface soil water saturation
    m s (t) is finally computed per pixel of the input slice according to (5). Since
    extreme weather events can cause an input DEM-geocoded backscatter measurement
    σ 0 (θ,t) to lie outside the interval defined by its corresponding references,
    m s (t) is set to 0 if negative, or to 1 if greater than 1. Provided a soil porosity
    map at 1 km resolution is available, volumetric surface soil water saturation
    m v (t) can be estimated by multiplying m s (t) with soil porosity [48]. Fig.
    1. The part of the flow chart enclosed in the rounded rectangle supplies the DEM-geocoded
    IW mode GRD slices at 1 km resolution and associated local incidence angle (LIA)
    images required as input by the proposed S2M-NRT and is assumed to be implemented
    elsewhere in the Sentinel-1 (collaborative) PDGS. The remainder of the diagram
    depicts the data-driven processing chain of the proposed S2M-NRT, as implemented
    within the framework of the S1-SMAD project. Note that the S2M-NRT is accordingly
    parallelizable over input slices. Show All A. Quality Flag Image Not all land
    cover classes lend themselves to meaningful retrieval of surface soil moisture.
    In order to address this fact in the S2M-NRT software demonstrator implemented
    within the framework of the S1-SMAD project, a binary mask is provided alongside
    the SSM image output by the S2M-NRT, giving an indication of meaningfulness of
    each output m s (t) pixel. The choice of whether to use an output m s (t) value
    thus rests squarely with the user, regardless of the value of its corresponding
    quality flag. A pixel is masked out if it corresponds to any of the following
    U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Global Land Cover Characterization (GLCC) [49] land
    cover classes: (i) Urban and Built up Land, (ii) Evergreen Broadleaf Forest, (iii)
    Water Bodies, (iv) Barren or Sparsely Vegetated, or (v)Snow or Ice. Class (iv)
    encompasses desert areas; in the case of class (ii), backscatter is dominated
    by volume scattering in forest canopy. Additionally, a pixel is masked out in
    the quality flag image if temporal correlation between DEM-geocoded σ 0 (θ,t)
    at 1 km and the same measurements aggregated to a coarser (regional) scale at
    25 km lies below a threshold. This last criterion is driven by the nature of across-scale
    interaction of soil moisture [50]. When m s is updated such that it lie within
    the interval defined by its references, the corresponding pixel is masked out
    in the quality flag image. B. Emergency Services In the event that backscatter
    measurements σ 0 (θ,t) be acquired within the framework of the GMES Emergency
    Management Service (EMS) [43], the respective local incidence angles θ might not
    correspond to any characteristic local incidence angle θ char available at the
    location in question. A database of slope parameters β obtained from a long time
    series of 1km DEM-geocoded Envisat ASAR GM mode data would provide an avenue for
    normalizing any such emergency backscatter measurement to the characteristic local
    incidence angle θ char ∈Θ( σ 0 ) that minimizes abs(θ− θ char ) , once again subject
    to abs(θ− θ char )<T , for some tight angular threshold T . The thus normalized
    input data could then be used for retrieval of surface soil water saturation m
    s (t) according to (5). SECTION V. Reprocessing Facility The purpose of the proposed
    non-NRT reprocessing facility (S2M-RF) is twofold. The S2M-RF is responsible primarily
    for computing revised wet and dry references (cf. Section III-A) using data made
    available since the last revision to the references. In support of providing user
    access to SSM data derived using the most accurate available antenna pattern calibration
    parameters, it also serves to compute revised S2M-NRT outputs (in non-NRT) for
    images that had already been computed in NRT since the last update to their calibration
    annotations, respectively. The proposed schedule-driven processing chain for the
    S2M-RF is depicted in Fig. 2; the same processing chain could in principle be
    invoked explicitly, e.g., in the event that changes be made to how wet and dry
    references are retrieved. Given a set of new 1 km DEM-geocoded IW mode GRD images,
    each image (and its associated local incidence angle image) is first resampled
    to the grid of the parameter database and stored as a time series. One way to
    store such time series is in the form of a tiling akin to that of the parameter
    database discussed in Section IV. In the case of inputs that had already been
    fed to the S2M-RF at an earlier point in time, but for which updated calibration
    annotations are made available, the original entries in the parameter database
    are identified and respectively adjusted to reflect the revised annotations. Once
    the historical time series database has been augmented with all new or revised
    1 km DEM-geocoded IW mode GRD input images, wet and dry references are computed
    per gridpoint and indexed according to respective characteristic local incidence
    angle. Note that measurements that do not correspond to any of a gridpoint’s characteristic
    local incidence angles are not taken under consideration by the S2M-RF for computing
    the references. Finally, the set of 1 km DEM-geocoded IW mode GRD input images
    are reprocessed in non-NRT by the S2M-NRT using the revised parameter database.
    Fig. 2. The part of the flow chart enclosed in the rounded rectangle supplies
    the input data required by the proposed S2M-RF, and is assumed to be implemented
    elsewhere in the Sentinel-1 (collaborative) PDGS. The remainder of the diagram
    depicts the schedule-driven processing chain of the proposed S2M-RF. Show All
    Fig. 3. Simulated 1 minute DEM-geocoded Sentinel-1 IW mode GRD slice at 1 km resolution
    (ca. 408 km in the along track, 250 km in the across track) over central Europe,
    used as input to the S2M-NRT software demonstrator in support of evaluating the
    timeliness of the S2M-NRT. The simulated backscatter measurements were obtained
    from a global backscatter model. The simulated slice is provided in the plate
    carrée projection. Show All Such a schedule-driven update to the parameter database
    could—as a tentative estimate—be carried out once every two years. As revisions
    of the parameter database entail ingestion overhead for users, a balance ought
    to be struck between keeping model parameters up to date and mitigating such user
    overhead. SECTION VI. Timeliness Downlinked Sentinel-1 NRT data is expected to
    be processed in partially overlapping slices of configurable length. Given a foreseen
    Sentinel-1 ground speed of 6.8 km/s, a 1 minute slice acquired in IW mode corresponds
    to approximately 408 km in the along track and 250 km in the across track (the
    IW mode swath width), amounting to an area of ca. 102,000 km² (cf. Fig. 3). The
    mosaicking and resampling of model parameter tiles is what dominates the running
    time of the S2M-NRT software demonstrator, with the number of tiles covering a
    slice depending on the projection employed and the slice’s location on the Earth’s
    surface. In the plate carrée projection, a simulated 1minute DEM-geocoded IW mode
    GRD slice at 1 km resolution corresponds to a total of ca. 60 tiles at the equator
    and ca. 120 over Scandinavia. Fig. 4. The ground track—restricted to the Land
    Masses acquisition region—along which simulated 1 minute DEM-geocoded IW mode
    GRD slices at 1 km resolution were generated in support of evaluating the timeliness
    of the S2M-NRT. Show All The S2M-NRT software demonstrator implemented within
    the framework of the S1-SMAD project was written in IDL and tested under Windows
    on a 3.07 GHz 8-core PC. Simulated 1minute DEM-geocoded IW mode GRD slices at
    1 km resolution and corresponding wet and dry references were pre-computed over
    the Land Masses acquisition region for half an orbit (cf. Fig. 4), by leveraging
    version 4.2 of ESA’s Earth Observation CFI orbit simulation software [51] and
    a global backscatter model [52]. For each simulated slice, the S2M-NRT software
    demonstrator output an SSM image, a retrieval error estimate image and a quality
    flag image, respectively, in under 2 seconds. SECTION VII. Conclusion The radiometric,
    spatial and temporal resolutions at which Sentinel-1 IW mode C-band SAR data is
    expected to be acquired render the Sentinel-1 mission a promising platform for
    systematic surface soil moisture retrieval at 1 km over the mission’s Land Masses
    acquisition region, exceeding the possibilities for retrieval using SAR data acquired
    by the earlier Envisat mission. The software demonstrator that implements the
    change detection-driven surface soil moisture retrieval algorithm presented in
    this paper was shown to support even the most stringent variety of NRT timeliness
    defined within the context of the Sentinel-1 mission. Retrieval in NRT with respect
    to time of acquisition—subject to the mission operating as foreseen—is expected
    to be technically feasible within the framework of the hosted user environment
    of the mission’s payload data ground segment. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The work carried
    out in this paper within the framework of the S1-SMAD project builds upon earlier
    work carried out in support of the Soil Moisture for Hydrometeorological Applications
    (SHARE) and Sigma Nought Statistics over Land Activity (Sigma0) projects, also
    funded by ESA. The authors would furthermore like to thank the reviewers for their

    \ of crop water use efﬁciency (CWUE), deﬁned as crop yield per volume of\nwater\
    \ used, is an important goal for both crop management and breeding. While many\
    \ technologies\nhave been developed for measuring crop water use in crop management\
    \ studies, rarely have these\ntechniques been applied at the scale of breeding\
    \ plots. The objective was to develop a high-throughput\nmethodology for quantifying\
    \ water use in a cotton breeding trial at Maricopa, AZ, USA in 2016\nand 2017,\
    \ using evapotranspiration (ET) measurements from a co-located irrigation management\n\
    trial to evaluate the approach. Approximately weekly overﬂights with an unmanned\
    \ aerial system\nprovided multispectral imagery from which plot-level fractional\
    \ vegetation cover (fc) was computed.\nThe fc data were used to drive a daily\
    \ ET-based soil water balance model for seasonal crop water\nuse quantiﬁcation.\
    \ A mixed model statistical analysis demonstrated that differences in ET and\n\
    CWUE could be discriminated among eight cotton varieties (p < 0.05), which were\
    \ sown at two\nplanting dates and managed with four irrigation levels. The results\
    \ permitted breeders to identify\ncotton varieties with more favorable water use\
    \ characteristics and higher CWUE, indicating that the\nmethodology could become\
    \ a useful tool for breeding selection.\nKeywords: breeding; drought; evapotranspiration;\
    \ modeling; phenomics; remote sensing; unmanned\naerial system\n1. Introduction\n\
    Drought stress arising from water deﬁcit is a leading cause of crop production\
    \ losses worldwide.\nSpeciﬁc regions of the world are also projected to experience\
    \ increases in the frequency and severity\nof future drought events due to effects\
    \ of climate change on precipitation patterns [1,2]. To maintain\nproductivity\
    \ and security of food, ﬁber, and other agricultural products, increasing crop\
    \ water use\nefﬁciency (CWUE), deﬁned as the ratio of crop yield and water consumption\
    \ volume, is an important\ngoal to ameliorate impacts of future drought. Increases\
    \ in CWUE can result both from improvements\nin agronomic management practices\
    \ [3] and by developing improved crop cultivars that yield highly\nunder water\
    \ deﬁcit conditions [4]. Although these pathways are often pursued independently\
    \ within\ndisciplinary boundaries, the most comprehensive solutions towards CWUE\
    \ improvement will be\nachieved through multidisciplinary efforts.\nAdoption of\
    \ information technologies for problem solving in the agricultural sciences has\
    \ been\nan especially pervasive occurrence in recent years. For example, precision\
    \ irrigation, where water\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1682; doi:10.3390/rs10111682\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1682\n2 of 19\napplications\
    \ are tuned based on the spatial and temporal crop need, is a primary technology\
    \ for\nimproving CWUE in crop production settings [5,6]. Other agronomic solutions\
    \ involve improved\nfertility management, optimizing sowing dates, using cover\
    \ crops or mulches, and choosing\nalternative crops or crop rotations [3]. In\
    \ the plant sciences, high-throughput plant phenomics,\nwhich involves deployment\
    \ of crop sensing systems for rapid phenotyping of breeding populations,\nhas\
    \ potential to guide crop improvement efforts toward cultivars with increased\
    \ tolerance to drought\nstress [4,7,8]. Information technologies in the form of\
    \ sensors, imagers, data loggers, sensor deployment\nvehicles, geographic information\
    \ systems, geostatistical methods, data management approaches,\nand engineering\
    \ control systems are central to the success of these technical solutions to improving\n\
    CWUE. However, further efforts are needed to solidify the role of information\
    \ technology for practical\nadvancement towards this goal.\nRemote sensing has\
    \ been used to estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET) and predict drought stress\n\
    at multiple scales [9–13]. For example, Yebra et al. [14] combined vegetation\
    \ metrics derived from\nthe MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)\
    \ satellite with the Penman-Monteith\nequation to estimate ET for evergreen and\
    \ deciduous broadleaf forests. At the agricultural ﬁeld scale,\nColaizzi et al.\
    \ [15] installed infrared thermometers on an overhead sprinkler irrigation machine\
    \ to\nestimate daily ET. They proposed that the approach could improve CWUE through\
    \ better irrigation\nscheduling. In addition, Hunsaker et al. [16] used multispectral\
    \ cameras aboard a manned helicopter\nto map the normalized difference vegetation\
    \ index (NDVI) of a cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) ﬁeld,\nestimated basal crop\
    \ coefﬁcients from NDVI, and scheduled irrigation using an ET-based soil water\n\
    balance model [17]. Results for one growing season showed that the recommendations\
    \ from the\nscheduling model led to increased CWUE when NDVI was used to estimate\
    \ basal crop coefﬁcients.\nAdditional ﬁeld testing is needed to further realize\
    \ CWUE improvements using remote sensing to\nguide irrigation management decisions.\n\
    Leveraging the technology previously developed for precision agriculture applications,\
    \ remote and\nproximal sensing has recently become a highly popular tool for field-based\
    \ plant phenotyping,\nparticularly by integrating imaging equipment with unmanned\
    \ aerial systems (i.e., drones) to obtain very\nhigh resolution imagery of plant\
    \ breeding trials. For example, Zaman-Allah et al. [18] related nitrogen\nstress,\
    \ senescence, and yield for ten maize (Zea mays L.) hybrids to NDVI from multispectral\
    \ images\ncollected with a drone. In addition, Sankaran et al. [19] used a multispectral\
    \ camera with a drone to\nestimate seedling emergence and stand density for more\
    \ than 100 winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)\nvarieties in Washington State.\
    \ Condorelli et al. [20] measured NDVI with a drone-based multispectral\ncamera\
    \ over 248 durum wheat (Triticum durum L.) lines at different growth stages and\
    \ water regimes.\nA subsequent genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified\
    \ 22 single quantitative trait loci (QTL)\nfor NDVI, particularly as related to\
    \ terminal drought stress. Although many important advancements\nhave been made,\
    \ moving remote sensing data analyses beyond the NDVI will enhance the quantification\n\
    of useful phenotypes.\nFew studies, if any, have aimed to directly phenotype crop\
    \ water use or CWUE for purposes\nof breeding or genomic analysis. Rather, the\
    \ focus has been to estimate related plant traits, such as\nspectral indices that\
    \ correlate with plant water status, under both well-watered and water-limited\n\
    conditions [21–24]. A key difference is that plant water status describes the\
    \ plant state at a singular\ntime point, whereas crop water use is a process that\
    \ occurs over time. For this reason, efforts to\nintegrate process-based simulation\
    \ models with spectral measurements of plant states may provide\nphenotypes that\
    \ better express the process-based nature of plant growth and water consumption\
    \ [25].\nAlthough the integration of remote sensing data with models of radiation\
    \ transfer, crop growth,\nand soil water balance has been widely studied for regional\
    \ and ﬁeld-scale mapping of crop water use,\nsuch techniques have not been applied\
    \ for ﬁeld-based, high-throughput plant phenomics.\nThe main goal of this study\
    \ was to develop a methodology for phenotyping crop water use\nand CWUE in a cotton\
    \ breeding trial, using ET estimates from a co-located irrigation management\n\
    study to evaluate the approach. It attempts to merge efforts from the ET remote\
    \ sensing community\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1682\n3 of 19\nwith efforts in the\
    \ plant science community in a multidisciplinary effort toward CWUE improvement.\n\
    Speciﬁc objectives were to (1) estimate fractional vegetation cover (fc) from\
    \ multispectral images\ncollected over the cotton ﬁeld trials with a drone, (2)\
    \ use plot-level fc to derive crop water use\ncalculations from an ET-based daily\
    \ soil water balance model, and (3) identify cotton cultivars with\nfavorable\
    \ yield, ﬁber quality and water use efﬁciency across treatments and growing seasons.\n\
    2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Field Experiments\nCotton ﬁeld experiments were\
    \ conducted at the University of Arizona’s Maricopa Agricultural\nCenter (MAC)\
    \ near Maricopa, AZ (33.079◦N, 111.977◦W, 360 m above sea level) during the 2016\n\
    and 2017 growing seasons (Figure 1).\nThe environment in central Arizona is arid\
    \ and hot,\nwith maximum daily air temperatures regularly exceeding 38 ◦C in July\
    \ and August. Growing\nseason precipitation from April through September amounted\
    \ to 42 and 51 mm in 2016 and 2017,\nrespectively. In comparison, short crop reference\
    \ ET during the same period was 1364 and 1404 mm in\n2016 and 2017, respectively.\
    \ Thus, cotton production required irrigation to meet evaporative demand.\n2014\n\

    \ 2018, 10, 1682\n4 of 19\nSoil variability at the 6-ha ﬁeld site was characterized\
    \ via a multi-year soil sampling effort at\n160 locations (not shown). A tractor-mounted\
    \ soil sampler (model 25-TS, Giddings Machine Co.,\nWindsor, CO, USA) was used\
    \ to collect cylindrical soil samples (0.04-m diameter × 0.4-m depth)\nat ﬁve\
    \ incremental soil proﬁle depths centered at 0.2, 0.6, 1.0, 1.4 and 1.8 m. Soil\
    \ texture analysis\nwas conducted in the laboratory using the hydrometer method\
    \ of Gee and Bauder [26], and the soil\nwater holding limits of each sample was\
    \ computed from texture data using the Rosetta pedotransfer\nfunctions [27]. For\
    \ ET estimation purposes (discussed below), ordinary kriging was used to spatially\n\
    interpolate soil water limits at the central location of each ﬁeld plot (Figure\
    \ 1). Geostatistics were\nconducted using the “geoR” package within the R Project\
    \ for Statistical Computing software. Primarily,\nsoil texture at the ﬁeld site\
    \ was sandy loam and sandy clay loam with drained upper limits between\n0.16 and\
    \ 0.22 cm3 cm−3 and lower limits between 0.08 and 0.11 cm3 cm−3.\nData from two\
    \ ﬁeld experiments (Experiment #1 and Experiment #2), each with a unique\nexperimental\
    \ design and purpose, were used to complete the objectives of this study. The\
    \ two ﬁeld\nexperiments were established on adjacent land areas (Figure 1), both\
    \ receiving irrigation from the same\noverhead, lateral-move sprinkler irrigation\
    \ system (Zimmatic, Lindsay Corporation, Omaha, NE, USA).\nAdvanced technology\
    \ on the irrigation machine permitted the application of variable irrigation rates\n\
    based on georeferenced irrigation maps uploaded to the machine’s control panel.\
    \ The variable-rate\nirrigation system permitted unique control of irrigation\
    \ rates from individual drop hoses, which were\nspaced 1.0 m apart and located\
    \ at the center of each interrow area. Nozzles were positioned to emit\nwater\
    \ less than 1.0 m above the soil surface. For uniform soil wetting prior to cotton\
    \ emergence, spray\npads giving a spray diameter of approximately 5.0 m were used.\
    \ After emergence, the pads were\nchanged to a “bubbler” style, which emitted\
    \ large droplets with a 0.3-m spray diameter at the center of\neach interrow area.\
    \ In addition to reducing water loss to evaporation, the bubbler pads increased\
    \ the\nspatial accuracy of irrigation applications relative to the intended application\
    \ areas delineated in the\ngeoreferenced irrigation maps. Spatial application\
    \ error with the variable-rate irrigation machine was\nestimated to be less than\
    \ 2.0 m. The overhead irrigation system with variable-rate capability permitted\n\
    both ﬁeld experiments to incorporate multiple irrigation rates as a primary treatment.\n\
    Experiment #1 tested cotton yield and water use responses to variable irrigation\
    \ rate and timing\nfor one commercial cotton variety (Deltapine 1549 B2XF, Monsanto\
    \ Company, St. Louis, MO, USA).\nTreatment plots were relatively large (12.2 m\
    \ (12 cotton rows) × 30.0 m) and required a majority of\nthe ﬁeld area (Figure\
    \ 1). The experimental design included four replications of sixteen irrigation\n\
    management treatments (64 plots), which involved all the possible combinations\
    \ of four irrigation\nrates applied during two distinct periods of the growing\
    \ season. The four irrigation rates were 60%,\n80%, 100%, and 120% of the recommendation\
    \ provided by an irrigation scheduling tool based on the\nCSM-CROPGRO-Cotton agroecosystem\
    \ model [28]. The two irrigation periods were from ﬁrst square\nto peak bloom\
    \ (approximately the ﬁrst of June through mid-July) and from peak bloom to 90%\
    \ open\nboll (approximately mid-July through the ﬁrst week of September). The\
    \ various combinations of the\nfour rates during the two times resulted in sixteen\
    \ total irrigation treatments, which led to cotton\ngrown under a variety of soil\
    \ water status conditions. The entire ﬁeld area was disked and planed\nprior to\
    \ planting. Cotton was planted with a north-south row orientation on 25 April\
    \ 2016 (day of year\n(DOY) 116) and 18 April 2017 (DOY 108).\nOf highest relevance\
    \ to the present study, Experiment #1 incorporated weekly soil water content\n\
    measurements via a ﬁeld-calibrated neutron moisture meter (model 503, Campbell\
    \ Paciﬁc Nuclear,\nMartinez, CA, USA). After crop emergence, steel access tubes\
    \ were installed at the center of each\ntreatment plot (Figure 1) using the tractor-mounted\
    \ soil sampler. From mid-May to early October,\nthe neutron moisture meter was\
    \ deployed on a weekly basis (approximately 20 times per growing\nseason) to measure\
    \ soil water content from 0.1 to 1.9 m in 0.2-m incremental depths at each access\n\
    Remote Sens. 2018, 10, 1682\n5 of 19\ntube. Soil water content data were used\
    \ to estimate ET and deep seepage (DS) between successive\nmeasurement events\
    \ using the soil water balance approach described by Hunsaker et al. [29]:\nET\
    \ =\n7\n∑\ni=1\n(Di,1 − Di,n−1) +\nn−1\n∑\nj=1\n(Rj + Ij) − DS,\n(1)\nDS = max\
    \ (0.0,\n10\n∑\ni=8\n(Di,1 − Di,n−1)),\n(2)\nwhere ET is the total evapotranspiration\
    \ and DS is the total deep seepage occurring from the\nbeginning of a given measurement\
    \ day (denoted as day j = 1) to the end of the day before the\nsuccessive measurement\
    \ date (denoted as j = n − 1), Di,1 and Di,n−1 are respectively the water depth\n\
    measurements at soil depth increment i at the beginning of day 1 and at the end\
    \ of day n − 1, and Rj\nand Ij are respectively the precipitation and net irrigation\
    \ depths received on day j. For the sake\nof practicality, soil water content\
    \ measurements collected on the morning of day n were used to\napproximate soil\
    \ water content at the end of day n − 1. Deep seepage was not permitted to be\
    \ negative,\nmeaning upﬂux from below the neutron access tube was considered negligible.\
    \ The seasonal ET\nestimates from neutron moisture meter data provided important\
    \ veriﬁcation that the ET estimation\nmethodology (discussed below) provided reasonably\
    \ accurate results.\nExperiment #2 was a breeding trial that tested the responses\
    \ of eight cotton cultivars (Table 1) to\ntwo planting dates and four irrigation\
    \ rates (Figure 1). The experimental design was a randomized\ncomplete block design\
    \ with planting date as the block and irrigation rate treatments nested within\n\
    the blocks. Each cultivar was replicated three times for each irrigation treatment,\
    \ totaling 96 plots\nper block. The first planting date treatment was sown on\
    \ 26 April 2016 (DOY 117) and 19 April 2017\n(DOY 109), and the second planting\
    \ date treatment was sown on 18 May 2016 (DOY 139) and 10 May\n2017 (DOY 130).\
    \ The four irrigation rates were 60%, 80%, 100%, and 120% of the recommendation\n\
    provided by a simulation tool for irrigation scheduling [28] and were administered\
    \ consistently from\nfirst square (early June) to 90% open boll (early September).\
    \ Irrigation rates were administered uniformly\nwithin spatial areas containing\
    \ 24 treatment plots (8 cultivars × 3 replications). Buffer areas with width\n\
    of 6.0 m (six cotton rows) and planted to a single commercial cotton variety were\
    \ incorporated centrally\nalong the boundaries of irrigation treatments to prevent\
    \ spatial error in the variable-rate irrigation\napplication from affecting cultivar\
    \ treatments. In 2016, the plot dimensions for cultivar treatments\nwere 3.0 m\
    \ (three cotton rows) × 4.6 m with a 1.5 m buffer area between plots. In 2017,\
    \ the plot size\nwas reduced to 2.0 m (two cotton rows) × 4.6 m, and the buffer\
    \ area between plots remained 1.5 m.\nDue to the relatively small size and large\
    \ number of treatment plots (i.e., 192 per growing season),\nplot-level ET estimation\
    \ via neutron moisture meter measurements and other common ET measurement\nmethodologies\
    \ was impractical. Thus, this study aimed to estimate ET by integrating plot-specific\n\
    remote sensing data and an ET-based soil water balance model with site-specific\
    \ soil parameterization,\nproviding an approach for high-throughput phenotyping\
    \ of cotton water use in this breeding trial.\nTable 1. Summary of eight cotton\

    \ with a two-row picker on 1 November 2016\n(DOY 306) and 8 November 2017 (DOY\
    \ 312). Samples from each plot were bagged and weighed\nseparately in the ﬁeld.\
    \ Prior to the harvest date, 25 mature bolls were sampled from each plot and\n\
    ginned on a small research-scale cotton gin. Harvest weight, ﬁber turnout percentage,\
    \ and plot area\nwere used to compute cotton ﬁber yield (kg ha−1) for each plot.\
    \ Additionally, cotton ﬁber from the\n25 mature boll samples was sent to Cotton\
    \ Incorporated (Cary, NC, USA) for analysis of ﬁber quality\nvia High Volume Instrument\
    \ (HVI) methods.\n2.2. Multispectral Imaging\nRemote sensing surveys from an autopiloted\
    \ drone were conducted over the ﬁeld site on multiple\noccasions in 2016 and 2017\
    \ (Table 2). Images were collected either via a ﬁve-band multispectral\ncamera\
    \ (RedEdge, MicaSense, Seattle, WA, USA) aboard a custom-built hexacopter or a\
    \ four-band\nmultispectral camera (Sequoia, Parrot, Paris, France) aboard a ﬁxed-wing\
    \ drone (eBee, SenseFly,\nCheseaux-sur-Lausanne, Switzerland). The bandwidths\
    \ and central wavelengths for the ﬁve-band\nRedEdge camera were 20 nm at 475 nm\
    \ (blue), 20 nm at 560 nm (green), 10 nm at 668 nm (red),\n10 nm at 717 nm (red\
    \ edge), and 40 nm at 840 nm (near infrared). For the four-band Sequoia camera,\n\
    bandwidths and central wavelengths were 40 nm at 550 nm (green), 40 nm at 660\
    \ nm (red), 10 nm\nat 735 nm (red edge), and 40 nm at 790 nm (near infrared).\
    \ Both cameras featured a global shutter\nfor multispectral image capture and\
    \ an upward facing sensor for solar irradiance characterization\nduring overﬂight.\
    \ The bit depth of images was 10 and 12 bits per channel for the Sequoia and\n\
    RedEdge cameras, respectively. Flight plans were designed for 80% image overlap\
    \ along ﬂight paths.\nImage spatial resolution at the ﬂight altitude of 75 m was\
    \ approximately 5 cm per pixel.\nTable 2. Multispectral image reconnaissance from\

    \ surveys, four 8-m × 8-m calibration tarps (Group VIII\nTechnologies, Provo,\
    \ UT, USA) were positioned near the cotton ﬁeld. Concurrently with drone\nimage\
    \ acquisition, ground-based radiometric measurements of each calibration tarp\
    \ were collected\nwith a portable ﬁeld spectroradiometer (FieldSpec 3, Analytical\
    \ Spectral Devices, Inc., Boulder,\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1682\n7 of 19\nCO,\
    \ USA), which was sensitive to wavelengths between 350 and 2500 nm. Additional\
    \ radiometric\nmeasurements over a calibrated, 99% Spectralon panel (Labsphere,\
    \ Inc., North Sutton, NH, USA) were\nused to characterize incoming solar irradiance\
    \ and to compute spectral reﬂectance factors of each tarp\nduring overﬂight. Based\
    \ on the quantum efﬁciency and ﬁlter functions for the multispectral cameras,\n\
    the tarp spectral reﬂectance data were ﬁltered to provide singular reﬂectance\
    \ factors for each tarp,\ncorresponding to each channel of the multispectral cameras.\
    \ The ﬁltered tarp reﬂectance data were\nused for image calibration efforts.\n\
    A commercial photogrammetry software (Pix4DMapperPro, Pix4D S.A., Lausanne, Switzerland)\n\
    was used to stitch images for each channel of the multispectral cameras. Geographic\
    \ coordinates from\n21 ground control points around the ﬁeld area were surveyed\
    \ with a real-time kinematic (RTK) global\npositioning receiver and were incorporated\
    \ into the image processing for georeferencing purposes.\nThe Pix4D software was\
    \ set to use camera calibration information and measurements from the upward\n\
    facing solar irradiance sensor for initial image calibration. Additionally, the\
    \ software provided an\noption to input the known reﬂectance of one calibration\
    \ target. Because reﬂectance measurements\nwere available for the calibration\
    \ tarps, the darkest calibration tarp was used for the known reﬂectance\ninput,\
    \ instead of the typical reﬂectance panel supplied by the camera manufacturer.\n\
    Comparisons of the measured tarp reﬂectance data with the values from tarp pixels\
    \ in the\northomosaic suggested that additional image calibration was needed following\
    \ Pix4D image processing.\nFor each multispectral image band, linear regression\
    \ equations were developed to relate the measured\nreﬂectance of all four calibration\
    \ targets to the average pixel value of each target in the images.\nUsing the\
    \ band math function in a commercial remote sensing software (Environment for\
    \ Visualizing\nImages (ENVI), Version 5.5, Exelis Visual Information Solutions,\
    \ Boulder, CO, USA), the linear\nregression equations were applied to compute\
    \ reﬂectance for all pixels in the image. The set of four\n(Sequoia) or ﬁve (RedEdge)\
    \ calibrated multispectral image bands were then layer stacked, such that\nfalse\
    \ color composite images (e.g., Figure 1) could be inspected for accuracy of image\
    \ calibration\nand georeferencing.\nBased on spectral information in all image\
    \ channels, a supervised maximum likelihood classiﬁer\nwithin the ENVI software\
    \ was used to segment the composite images into bare soil and vegetation\ncomponents.\
    \ The classiﬁer was trained by manually selecting regions of interest associated\
    \ with the\ntwo classes. Due to the relatively high spatial resolution from drone-based\
    \ images, it was generally\nsimple to select multiple regions of interest that,\
    \ with high certainty, represented pure spectral data\nfor each class. The image\
    \ classiﬁcation result was used to produce a binary image with values of\n0 for\
    \ bare soil and 1 for vegetation. The binary image was loaded into a geographic\
    \ information\nsystem (QGIS, www.qgis.org) for calculation of zonal statistics\
    \ within the boundaries of each ﬁeld\nplot, as delineated with shapeﬁle polygons\
    \ (Figure 1). Based on the total vegetation pixels within\neach polygon, the fractional\
    \ vegetation cover (fc) of each ﬁeld plot was computed for each ﬂight date\n(Table\
    \ 2).\n2.3. Fractional Cover Modeling\nTo facilitate calculations of cotton water\
    \ use for each ﬁeld plot (discussed below), daily fc estimates\nwere obtained\
    \ using a Kalman smoothing algorithm [30] to integrate drone-based fc measurements\n\
    with fc from a daily logistic growth model:\ndfc\ndt = r fc\n\x12\n1 −\nfc\nfc,max\n\
    \x13\n,\n(3)\nwhere r describes the growth rate (d−1) and fc,max is the maximum\
    \ value that fc attains. This differential\nequation has an analytical solution:\n\
    fc =\n \ncer(t−t0)\n1 +\nc\nfc,max er(t−t0)\n!\n,\n(4)\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10,\
    \ 1682\n8 of 19\nwhere\nc =\nfc,max fc,0\nfc,max − fc,0\n(5)\nand fc,0 is fc at\
    \ the initial time (t0). The model was parameterized for each ﬁeld plot by adjusting\
    \ r,\nfc,0, and fc,max to minimize error between modeled fc and the drone-based\
    \ fc measurements. The t0\nterm was ﬁxed as the DOY for planting each plot. Subsequently,\
    \ Equation (3) with ﬁtted parameters\nwas incorporated into an unscented Kalman\
    \ smoothing algorithm to develop daily fc time series that\nconsidered uncertainty\
    \ in both the measured and modeled fc data. Kalman smoothing was especially\n\
    important for characterizing fc in plots where the imposed treatments caused atypical\
    \ growth patterns\n(Figure 2). To achieve reasonable time series as assessed visually,\
    \ the fc state transition variance was\nset to 0.0002 while the measurement variance\
    \ was set ﬁve times higher at 0.001. A Python script was\ndeveloped to conduct\
    \ this analysis, which incorporated a Nelder–Mead optimizer within the “scipy”\n\
    package for parameter ﬁtting and the “pykalman” package for unscented Kalman smoothing.\n\

    the 2017 growing season at Maricopa, AZ, USA.\n2.4. Crop Water Use Estimation\n\
    The daily fc time series from Kalman smoothing were rescaled to formulate basal\
    \ crop coefﬁcient\n(Kcb) time series, which were used to drive an ET-based daily\
    \ soil water balance model as described\nin the Food and Agriculture Organization\
    \ of the United Nations Paper No. 56 (FAO-56) [17]. Brieﬂy,\ndaily crop water\
    \ use (ETc) was calculated with the following equation:\nETc = (KcbKs + Ke) ETos,\n\
    (6)\nwhere ETos is the standardized short crop reference evapotranspiration [31],\
    \ Ke is the soil water\nevaporation coefﬁcient, and Ks describes the effect of\
    \ water stress on transpiration. Daily ETos was\ncomputed using data from an Arizona\
    \ Meteorological Network station (AZMET) approximately 1.2 km\nfrom the ﬁeld site.\
    \ Required meteorological measurements included the daily minimum and maximum\n\
    air temperature, dew point temperature, solar irradiance, and wind speed. Based\
    \ on recommended\ncomputations for maximum Kcb given environmental data for Maricopa,\
    \ the Kcb time series were\nrescaled from fc with a minimum value of 0.15 and\
    \ maximum value of 1.225. The coefﬁcients Ke and\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1682\n\
    9 of 19\nKs were calculated as described in FAO-56. For Ks in particular, calculations\
    \ were based on a daily\nsoil water balance methodology, where soil water holding\
    \ limits deﬁne the total plant available water.\nUnder non-stressed conditions\
    \ with root zone soil water at the drained upper limit, Ks is 1.0 and has\nno\
    \ effect on ETc calculations (Equation (6)). As soil water is depleted, reductions\
    \ in Ks are calculated,\nwhich lead to decreased ETc from plant transpiration.\
    \ As mentioned above, the soil water holding\nlimits were speciﬁed uniquely for\
    \ each treatment plot based on soil sampling, soil texture analysis,\npedotransfer\
    \ function evaluations, and geostatistical calculations at the ﬁeld site. Thus,\
    \ the crop water\nuse calculations were based on plot-level, site-speciﬁc information\
    \ for both the soil water holding\nproperties and the plant growth impacts on\
    \ Kcb as characterized through drone-based fc. The soil\nwater status on day i\
    \ was calculated as follows:\nDi = Di−1 − Pi − Ii + ETci + DSi,\n(7)\nwhere D\
    \ is the depth of root zone soil water depletion from the drained upper limit\
    \ at the end of the\nday, P and I are the precipitation and irrigation received\
    \ on the day, ETc is the daily crop water use\nfrom Equation (6), and DS is the\
    \ water lost to deep seepage, which is calculated when water inputs\nexceed the\
    \ root zone soil water storage capacity. This ET-based soil water balance model,\
    \ as described\nin FAO-56 [17], was coded as a Python script for use in all cotton\
    \ water use calculations in this study.\nFor each treatment plot in both ﬁeld\
    \ experiments in both growing seasons, ETc calculations were\ninitiated on the\
    \ day of planting and terminated after crop maturity in the ﬁrst week of October.\n\
    To summarize the seasonal crop water use, daily ETc calculations were aggregated\
    \ over time.\nFor comparison to measured ETc data in the irrigation management\
    \ study (Equation (1)), daily ETc\ncalculations were aggregated from the ﬁrst\
    \ to the last neutron moisture meter measurement dates in\neach growing season.\
    \ For the cotton breeding trial, ETc data were aggregated over the entire calculation\n\
    period from planting to crop maturity. Furthermore, seasonal CWUE (kg m−3) was\
    \ calculated from\nthe ratio of measured cotton ﬁber yield and modeled seasonal\
    \ cotton ET. To eliminate the effect of\nsurface soil water evaporation, seasonal\
    \ water use efﬁciency was also computed considering only the\ntranspiration component\
    \ of ET (TWUE, kg m−3).\n2.5. Statistical Analysis\nStatistical software (SAS\
    \ for Windows, ver. 9.3, SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) was used to ﬁt a\nlinear\
    \ model for each of eleven cotton traits in response to the experimental treatments\
    \ in the breeding\ntrial. The eleven cotton traits were ﬁber yield (FY, kg ha−1),\
    \ seasonal evapotranspiration (ET, mm),\ncrop water use efﬁciency (CWUE = FY:ET,\
    \ kg m−3), seasonal transpiration (T, mm), transpiration water\nuse efﬁciency\
    \ (TWUE = FY:T, kg m−3), micronaire (MIC, unitless), upper half mean ﬁber length\
    \ (UHM,\nmm), uniformity index (UI, mm mm−1), ﬁber strength (STR, HVI g tex−1),\
    \ ﬁber elongation at failure\n(ELO, %), and short ﬁber content (SFC, %). Mixed\
    \ model analysis of variance was conducted for each\ntrait using the SAS MIXED\
    \ procedure with the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) method. In the\ncase\
    \ that more than one trait estimate was available per plot, the plot mean was\
    \ used as the dependent\nvariable. The statistical model for each trait (Y) was\n\
    Yijklmn = µ + αi + βj + γk + δl(k) + (αβ)ij + (αγ)ik + (βγ)jk + (αδ)il(k) + (βδ)jl(k)\n\
    +(αβγ)ijk + (αβδ)ijl(k) + ζm + (αζ)im + ϵn(ijklm),\n(8)\nwhere experimental year\
    \ (αi), cotton cultivar (βj), planting date (γk), irrigation treatment nested\
    \ within\nplanting date (δl(k)), and corresponding interaction terms were ﬁtted\
    \ as ﬁxed effects, and the replicate\n(ζm) and year by replicate interaction ((αζ)im)\
    \ were ﬁtted as random effects. To examine associations\namong traits, Pearson’s\
    \ correlation coefﬁcients (r) were determined using the SAS CORR procedure.\n\
    Remote Sens. 2018, 10, 1682\n10 of 19\n3. Results\n3.1. Crop Water Use Evaluation\n\
    Evaluation of seasonal cotton water use estimates from the drone-based ET modeling\
    \ approach as\ncompared to ET measurements from neutron moisture meters demonstrated\
    \ reasonable performance\nwith the modeling technique (Figure 3). The root mean\
    \ squared errors (RMSE) between measured and\nmodeled seasonal ET among 64 treatment\
    \ plots in the irrigation management study were less than 5%.\nIn both seasons,\
    \ the model underestimated ET for the four treatment plots with the highest ET\
    \ amounts.\nThese treatment plots received 120% of the recommended irrigation\
    \ rate over the whole season and\nwere therefore overwatered. One possibility\
    \ is that measured ET from the neutron moisture meters\nwas overestimated, which\
    \ is likely considering that deep seepage was estimated from soil moisture\nstates\
    \ typically one week apart (Equation (2)). In actuality, more water ﬂux to deep\
    \ seepage may have\noccurred for the overwatered plots, which would reduce estimates\
    \ for measured ET (Equation (1))\nif it could be accurately measured. For other\
    \ treatment plots, which were not overwatered for the\nentire season, the agreement\
    \ between measured and modeled ET was very good. In 2016 and 2017,\nmeasured deep\
    \ seepage ranged from 45 to 97 mm and from 21 to 63 mm, respectively (not shown).\n\
    Modeled deep seepage in both years ranged from 0 to 146 mm with a majority of\
    \ plots modeled as\nhaving zero seepage. On average, measured deep seepage was\
    \ less than 7% and 4% of ET in 2016 and\n2017, respectively, which demonstrates\
    \ the high importance of crop water use as a pathway for water\nloss from the\
    \ agroecosystem. Overall, the results show that the drone-based fc and soil water\
    \ balance\nmodeling approach could effectively estimate seasonal cotton water\
    \ use at this ﬁeld site.\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\n1.1\n1.2\nMeasured ET (m)\n\

    \ (Kcb) time series for each plot in the breeding trial were variable\naccording\
    \ to the combined effect of planting date, irrigation rate, and cotton cultivar\
    \ on fc, as measured\nusing drone-based images (Figure 4). For example on DOY\
    \ 184 in 2016, which is approximately the\ndate of ﬁrst ﬂower, the Kcb among plots\
    \ in the ﬁrst planting varied from 0.40 to 1.09 (Figure 4a).\nThis means that\
    \ some plots were transpiring as low as 23% of full transpiration capacity on\
    \ this day,\nwhile others were transpiring as high as 88% of full capacity. As\
    \ compared to the standard trapezoidal\nKcb time series, which were computed based\
    \ on days after planting as recommended in FAO-56,\nmany plots reached full transpiration\
    \ capacity earlier than the standard, while others never reached\nRemote Sens.\
    \ 2018, 10, 1682\n11 of 19\nfull transpiration capacity. The drone-based fc data\
    \ also suggested that late season Kcb remained\nhigher than the standard Kcb recommendation,\
    \ which may be true because cotton was traditionally a\nperennial plant and for\
    \ agronomic purposes requires defoliation by desiccant application to terminate\n\
    leaf growth and transpiration. Overall, to the extent that Kcb via drone-based\
    \ fc correlates to plant\ntranspiration rates, the data suggest highly variable\
    \ water use patterns among the treatments imposed\nin the cotton breeding trial.\n\

    \ indicating that some plots used up to twice as much water as others.\nEstimates\
    \ of the seasonal transpiration component of ET ranged from 389 to 1069 mm. On\
    \ average,\n0.19 kg of cotton ﬁber was produced per m3 of water consumed (i.e.,\
    \ CWUE). Considering only\nthe transpiration component of ET, mean TWUE was 0.25\
    \ kg m−3, a 26% increase as compared to\ncalculations that included surface evaporation.\
    \ This establishes an upper limit on the potential for\nCWUE improvements through\
    \ management practices that reduce surface evaporation.\nThe ﬁber quality measurements\
    \ suggested desirable ﬁber characteristics in some cases and less\ndesirable characteristics\
    \ in others. With micronaire values above 4.3, none of the plots produced ﬁber\n\
    with micronaire in the range required for premium pricing (i.e., 3.7 to 4.2).\
    \ Upper half mean length\nranged from 26 to 32 mm, indicating medium to long ﬁber\
    \ lengths. Uniformity indices ranged from 79\nto 86 mm mm−1, indicating average\
    \ to high ﬁber length uniformity. Fiber strength ranged from 27 to\n40 HVI g tex−1,\
    \ indicating average to very strong ﬁbers. Elongation at failure ranged from 4.0%\
    \ to 7.6%,\nindicating very low to high ﬁber elongation and an overall wide range\
    \ for this study. With r equal to\n0.31 and 0.33 (not shown), CWUE and TWUE, respectively,\
    \ were correlated with ﬁber elongation at\nfailure. Thus, the plots with higher\
    \ water use efﬁciency tended to produce ﬁbers that could stretch\nmore before\
    \ breaking. In addition, with r equal to 0.30 and 0.34, seasonal ET and T, respectively,\
    \ were\ncorrelated with upper half mean ﬁber length. Thus, plots with higher water\
    \ use generally produced\nlonger ﬁbers. Fiber yield did not correlate with any\
    \ ﬁber quality metrics with r greater than 0.24. Thus,\nCWUE and TWUE were better\
    \ estimators of ﬁber quality metrics than ﬁber yield in some cases.\nTable 3.\

    \ season. The two planting date treatments led to differences\nin most of the\

    0.0006\n3.4. Relevance to Breeding\nImproving CWUE via plant breeding requires\
    \ the identiﬁcation of cultivars that yield highly\nbut with reduced transpiration.\
    \ An important aspect of the modeling methodology is that the crop\ncoefﬁcients\
    \ (Equation (6)) permit partitioning of water use among plant transpiration and\
    \ surface\nevaporation components. Thus, for purposes of breeding, the results\
    \ can be discussed in terms of\nTWUE, the crop yield per volume of water transpired\
    \ because breeding will primarily improve CWUE\nthrough the transpiration component\
    \ of ET.\nPlots of ﬁber yield versus seasonal transpiration demonstrated a positive\
    \ correlation for all\ngrowing season and planting date combinations (Figure 5),\
    \ generally equating higher yield with higher\nwater use as commonly shown in\
    \ crop water production functions [3]. Coefﬁcients of determination (r2)\nbetween\
    \ ﬁber yield and seasonal transpiration were higher with the second planting than\
    \ with the ﬁrst\nplanting, indicating water management was a stronger driver of\
    \ yield variability with later planting.\nBoth ﬁber yield and seasonal transpiration\
    \ were reduced with the second planting as compared to the\nﬁrst planting. The\
    \ effect was due in part to a shorter growing season for the second planting because\
    \ it\nwas planted approximately one month later than the ﬁrst planting while irrigation\
    \ for both planting\ndate treatments was terminated at the same time in early\
    \ September. Extending the irrigation period\nlater into September may have increased\
    \ ﬁber yield and transpiration for the second planting.\nReduction in seasonal\
    \ transpiration for the second planting may also be due to environmental\ndifferences.\
    \ In central Arizona, the month of June (DOY 152 to 181) typically has high ambient\n\
    temperatures and low humidity, which leads to increased evaporative demand (i.e.,\
    \ ETos). In addition,\nas seen in Figure 4, the Kcb (i.e., transpiration rate)\
    \ during this period was much higher for the ﬁrst\nplanting than for the second\
    \ planting due to higher fc. Thus, water use in the month of June was\nmuch greater\
    \ for the ﬁrst planting (Equation (6)). With the second planting, the hot and\
    \ dry period in\nJune was largely avoided, and maximum Kcb was not attained until\
    \ July when the Arizona monsoon\nseason brought higher humidity, reduced ambient\
    \ air temperatures, and lower evaporative demand.\nThus, improvements in CWUE\
    \ may come from better timing of the maximum Kcb period with the\nArizona monsoon\
    \ season. Furthermore, because r2 between ﬁber yield and transpiration was greater\n\
    for the second planting, the Arizona monsoon season may provide a better environment\
    \ for selecting\nheritable traits that improve yield and CWUE and increase genetic\
    \ gain in breeding populations.\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1682\n14 of 19\n0.0\n\

    Data were collected as part of a cotton breeding trial conducted at Maricopa,\

    \ showed signiﬁcant variation\namong planting dates and irrigation rates (Figure\
    \ 6). The TWUE for the ﬁrst 2017 planting at the\n60% irrigation rate was unreasonably\
    \ high (Figure 6c). This was likely due to errant irrigation\napplications to\
    \ those plots, which was supported by soil moisture measurements (data not shown).\n\
    After removing this treatment from consideration, DP1044B2RF (C3) and Arkot9704\
    \ (C2) demonstrated\nthe most consistent TWUE across years, planting dates, and\
    \ irrigation treatments. Furthermore, C3 was\nranked as the second highest yielding\
    \ line and also had consistent ﬁber quality traits across years\nand treatments.\
    \ This means producers should expect consistent yields with C3 and C2 over a range\n\
    of soil water status conditions. However, selecting on yield stability alone can\
    \ be unreliable due to\nthe effects of environmental variation across growing\
    \ seasons. Calculated TWUE may provide an\nalternative phenotype for selection\
    \ because aggregated environmental conditions are included in the\nestimate, thus\
    \ reducing selection error caused by environment or management variation. For\
    \ example,\nDP1044B2RF (C3) and FM958 (C5) consistently achieved higher TWUE at\

    A main advantage of the ET-based soil water balance model (Equations (6) and (7))\
    \ is its\npartitioning of crop water use into surface evaporation and plant transpiration\
    \ components via\ncrop coefﬁcients (Kcb, Ks, and Ke). As dictated by the model\
    \ equations [17], Ks and Ke are mainly\ninﬂuenced by soil water holding characteristics,\
    \ and Ke is additionally inﬂuenced by the irrigation\nsystem and ground cover.\
    \ Thus, reductions in crop water use via changes to these coefﬁcients can\nbe\
    \ achieved only through adjustments in management practices. Some options include\
    \ switching to\nsubsurface drip irrigation to limit surface evaporation, adopting\
    \ conservation tillage to increase ground\ncover, or using variable-rate irrigation\
    \ to adjust irrigation rates based on the site-speciﬁc soil water\nholding characteristics.\
    \ The remaining coefﬁcient, Kcb, is the primary driver of plant transpiration\
    \ in\nthe model. As such, reductions in crop water use via changes to Kcb can\
    \ be achieved mainly through\nplant breeding. The goal for breeding should be\
    \ to select varieties that yield highly while exhibiting\nKcb time series (Figure\
    \ 4) that reduce water use through transpiration. By incorporating models of\n\
    Remote Sens. 2018, 10, 1682\n16 of 19\ncropping system processes into crop breeding\
    \ and management efforts, the improvements offered by\nmanagement versus breeding\
    \ can be better quantiﬁed.\nThe present study achieved high-throughput phenotyping\
    \ of crop water use efﬁciency using\nrelatively simple imaging and modeling technologies.\
    \ Obviously, plant transpiration is dictated by\nprocesses with higher complexity\
    \ than can be described through fc time series alone. For example,\nthe processes\
    \ of root water uptake, water transport through the plant, leaf stomatal conductance,\n\
    and other plant water regulatory mechanisms are not considered in this study.\
    \ Incorporation of more\ncomplex models that consider plant water status in greater\
    \ detail may improve transpiration estimates,\nalthough models with higher complexity\
    \ often also increase the model parameterization requirements.\nTo be effective,\
    \ the model parameters would need to be accurately estimated, or perhaps phenotyped,\n\
    for each variety, which could be the subject of future studies. In this study,\
    \ a simpler model was\nchosen due to the relative ease of driving the model with\
    \ basic fc measurements from drone-based\nmultispectral imaging. A main contribution\
    \ is the use of time-series fc estimates with a simple soil\nwater balance model\
    \ to provide seasonal transpiration estimates for breeding trials at the plot-level.\n\
    As such, the relatively simple methodology provides a practical way to incorporate\
    \ information on\ncrop water use into decisions on breeding selection and may\
    \ be especially useful when the goal is to\nsimply determine which varieties to\
    \ keep in the breeding program.\nAs this study represents one of several initial\
    \ efforts with drone-based imaging at the Maricopa\nresearch station, much has\
    \ been learned over the duration of the study. Regarding the choice of\nsensors,\
    \ the commercial multispectral cameras (i.e., Micasense RedEdge and Parrot Sequoia)\
    \ were\npopular products marketed for the agricultural sector at the time of the\
    \ study, and they were therefore\ngiven primary focus for ﬂight hours. As such,\
    \ the data from these sensors more fully covered the\ngrowing season as required\
    \ for time-series fc estimates herein. An astute reader will note that fc time\n\
    series could perhaps be more easily attained from digital color (RGB) cameras,\
    \ which is a simpler\nand more pervasive imaging technology with greater commercial\
    \ options for choices of camera and\ndrone platform. Additionally, the image spatial\
    \ resolution is often higher for RGB cameras, and image\ncalibration methods are\
    \ simpler as compared to multispectral image calibration. Data from RGB\ncameras\
    \ were also collected over the ﬁeld site but with less frequency and consistency,\
    \ which made\nthese data less useful for the study. Because the Parrot Sequoia\
    \ camera collected both RGB and\nmultispectral data, efforts with this camera\
    \ in 2017 (Table 2) aimed to collect both types of data in\na single drone ﬂight.\
    \ However, the success of this approach was reduced by data reliability issues\n\
    with the camera and multiple crashes of the ﬁxed-wing drone for which the camera\
    \ was designed.\nHence, the MicaSense RedEdge camera on a custom hexacopter drone\
    \ was the favored conﬁguration\nherein. For future efforts to map fc time series,\
    \ an even better conﬁguration may be an RGB camera\non a copter-style drone, for\
    \ which there are now many commercial options. However, future studies\nshould\
    \ also further contrast the advantages and disadvantages of multispectral versus\
    \ RGB imaging\nfrom drone platforms.\nMissing from this study is the use of thermal\
    \ cameras to quantify differences in plant water status\namong varieties, which\
    \ again was related to giving primary focus for ﬂight hours to the multispectral\n\
    cameras. Incorporating canopy temperature information from thermal cameras into\
    \ the methodology\nhas great potential to improve transpiration estimates among\
    \ varieties. For example, Kullberg et al. [32]\nrecently described the use of\
    \ stationary infrared thermometry to adjust Ks in the ET-based soil water\nbalance\
    \ model (Equation (6)), applied to maize. Although their data was collected from\
    \ ground-based\nsystems rather than drones, their approach demonstrates the integration\
    \ of Kcb from RGB data and\nKs from thermal data into the ET-based soil water\
    \ balance model for quantifying maize water use.\nFuture efforts should evaluate\
    \ this data fusion technique for improved high-throughput phenotyping\nof crop\
    \ water use among crop varieties, likely using RGB and thermal data from drone-based\
    \ images\nor sensors mounted on ground-based phenotyping vehicles [25].\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2018, 10, 1682\n17 of 19\n5. Conclusions\nHigh-throughput phenotyping\
    \ of water use in 192 cotton breeding plots was achieved using\napproximately\
    \ weekly vegetation cover estimates from drone-based multispectral cameras to\
    \ drive\nbasal crop coefﬁcients in a daily soil water balance model. Differences\
    \ in water use estimates among\neight cotton cultivars were found via linear mixed\
    \ modeling, indicating that the approach can assist\nbreeders in the identiﬁcation\
    \ of cultivars with favorable water use characteristics. Combining the\nwater\
    \ use estimates with crop yield can quantify crop water use efﬁciency, allowing\
    \ breeders to\nselect varieties that maximize crop production per volume of water\
    \ used. Options for improving\nthe methodology include considering models with\
    \ greater complexity in crop water use processes,\nassessing alternative options\
    \ for drone-based image data collection, and incorporating other crop\nphenotypes\
    \ such as canopy temperature. Taken together, the study demonstrates a methodology\
    \ for\nhigh-throughput phenotyping of crop water use, providing breeders a tool\
    \ for water use quantiﬁcation\nand additional traits for consideration in selective\
    \ breeding.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, K.R.T. and A.L.T.; Methodology,\

  explanation: '**Research Question:**


    The purpose of this study was to address the current limitations of real-time
    irrigation management systems and to develop a new methodology for estimating
    actual crop coefficients (Kcb act) using remotely sensed vegetation indices and
    soil water balance data.


    **Methods:**


    The study was conducted in three different crops: maize, barley, and an olive
    orchard. Satellite imagery was used to calculate vegetation indices, which were
    then input into a new equation to estimate Kcb act. The new equation was compared
    to an existing method for estimating Kcb act, and the results were evaluated using
    statistical indicators.


    **Results:**


    The new equation was found to be more accurate than the existing method for estimating
    Kcb act, particularly for the olive orchard. The new equation was also able to
    account for variations in crop density and height, and for the effects of water
    stress.


    **Significance:**


    The new equation provides a more accurate and reliable method for estimating Kcb
    act, which can be used to improve the efficiency of irrigation management systems.
    This can lead to water savings and increased crop yields.'

    \ 2015 \n \nAbstract: A new procedure is proposed for estimating actual basal\
    \ crop coefficients from \nvegetation indices (Kcb VI) considering a density coefficient\
    \ (Kd) and a crop coefficient for \nbare soil. Kd is computed using the fraction\
    \ of ground cover by vegetation (fc VI), which is \nalso estimated from vegetation\
    \ indices derived from remote sensing. A combined approach \nfor estimating actual\
    \ crop coefficients from vegetation indices (Kc VI) is also proposed by \nintegrating\
    \ the Kcb VI with the soil evaporation coefficient (Ke) derived from the soil\
    \ water \nbalance model SIMDualKc. Results for maize, barley and an olive orchard\
    \ have shown that \nthe approaches for estimating both fc VI and Kcb VI compared\
    \ well with results obtained using \nthe SIMDualKc model after calibration with\
    \ ground observation data. For the crops studied, \nthe correlation coefficients\
    \ relative to comparing the actual Kcb VI and Kc VI with actual Kcb \nand Kc obtained\
    \ with SIMDualKc were larger than 0.73 and 0.71, respectively. The \ncorresponding\
    \ regression coefficients were close to 1.0. The methodology herein presented\
    \ \nand discussed allowed for obtaining information for the whole crop season,\
    \ including periods \nwhen vegetation cover is incomplete, as the initial and\
    \ development stages. Results show that \nthe proposed methods are adequate for\
    \ supporting irrigation management. \n \n \nOPEN ACCESS\nRemote Sens. 2015, 7\

    \ of crop water requirements plays an important role in the improvement of \n\
    crops water use and irrigation performance. This issue is particularly relevant\
    \ considering the need for \nintensification of irrigated agriculture and increased\
    \ water scarcity in several regions of the world. \nA common approach for the\
    \ estimation of crop water requirements is the Kc-ETo approach adopted \nby FAO56\
    \ [1] where a reference crop evapotranspiration (ETo) is multiplied by a crop\
    \ coefficient (Kc) \nfor estimating crop evapotranspiration, ETc. The ETo represents\
    \ the climatic demand of the atmosphere \nwhile the Kc represents the differences\
    \ distinguishing the reference crop and the considered crop in \nterms of ground\
    \ cover, canopy properties and aerodynamic resistance, thus in terms of crop ET.\
    \ \nAlternatively, crop evapotranspiration may be computed directly from ground\
    \ observations using a \ncombination equation such as the Penman-Monteith equation\
    \ [2,3]. However, this approach is more \ndemanding than the Kc-ETo approach and\
    \ is not used for operational purposes but limited to research. \nAnother approach\
    \ for estimating crop ET is based on surface energy balance models that use remote\
    \ \nsensing thermal infrared data (e.g., [4–6]). These models estimate crop ET\
    \ by subtracting the soil heat \nflux (G) and sensible heat flux (H) from the\
    \ net radiation (Rn) at the surface. Such models allow to \ndirectly integrating\
    \ the effects related with soil water deficit or water vapor pressure in the crop\
    \ ET \nestimation [7]. Crop coefficients can be further derived considering the\
    \ ETo [8–10]. However, these \nmodels present greater complexity and larger amount\
    \ of input data than the Kc-ETo approach [7]. The \nKc-ETo approach is commonly\
    \ accepted for operational and research objectives [11]. A single or dual \nKc\
    \ approach may be used [1]. In the single approach both crop transpiration and\
    \ soil evaporation are \ntimely averaged into a single coefficient (Kc), whereas\
    \ in the dual approach a daily basal crop \ncoefficient (Kcb), representing primarily\
    \ the plant transpiration, and a daily soil evaporation coefficient \n(Ke) are\
    \ considered separately, i.e., Kc = Kcb + Ke. \nFor transferability purposes,\
    \ Kc, Kcb and ETc in FAO56 represent ET rates under optimal, well-watered \nconditions\
    \ [1]. However, in the field and in common practice, crop conditions are often\
    \ not optimal \ndue to insufficient or non-uniform irrigation, crop density, soil\
    \ salinity and/or agronomic management. \nPotential ETc must then be replaced\
    \ by the actual ETc (ETc act), and the resulting Kc is renamed Kc act and \nKcb\
    \ is also renamed Kcb act [11]. The term actual is adopted in this study. As commented\
    \ by  \nPereira et al. [11], this concept better supports estimation and transferability\
    \ avoiding the need to define \nmultiple Kc values for the same crop as has occurred\
    \ in the past for several crops, e.g., vines and \norchards. Moreover, adopting\
    \ Kc act and Kcb act rather than using the potential crop coefficients allows\
    \ to \nperform irrigation management closer to the actual conditions, which is\
    \ a main motivation of the \npresent study. \nStandard, potential Kc and Kcb values\
    \ are defined and tabulated for a wide range of agricultural  \ncrops [1,12],\
    \ but appropriate corrections may be required adopting a stress coefficient (Ks)\
    \ to obtain \nRemote Sens. 2015, 7 \n2375 \n \nthe actual Kc (Kc act = Ks Kc or\
    \ Kcb act = Ks Kcb). In addition, the transferability of Kc and Kcb values \n\
    requires appropriate adjustment to local climate [1]. The adjustment of tabulated\
    \ Kc and Kcb values for \nlocal conditions is also necessary when differences\
    \ occur in planting density and geometry, vegetation \nheight, and canopy architecture\
    \ particularly in case of tree and vine crops [1,12]. \nIn the last two decades,\
    \ remote sensing (RS) data has increasingly been used for monitoring and \nmapping\
    \ the spatial and temporal variation of ET and thus for computing crop water requirements\
    \  \n(e.g., [13–15]). One of the most widely used approaches considers the relationship\
    \ between vegetation \nindices (VI) derived from RS reflectance data and (actual)\
    \ crop coefficients, either Kc or Kcb. The basis \nof this approach relies on\
    \ the close correlation of several VI and various biophysical characteristics\
    \ of \nthe plants, e.g., leaf area index (LAI), ground cover fraction (fc), biomass,\
    \ and physiological processes \ndepending on light absorption by the canopy, including\
    \ ET (e.g., [16–19]). With the VI approach, \nbecause these indices reflect the\
    \ actual vegetation cover conditions, the estimated Kc or Kcb represent \nactual\
    \ rather than potential Kc or Kcb. As proposed by Pereira et al. [11], these coefficients\
    \ should then \nbe referred to as Kc act and Kcb act despite many authors have\
    \ not adopted this conceptual difference and \nthat most VI-based methods are\
    \ unable to accurately observe reductions in Kc and Kcb caused by acute \nwater\
    \ or salinity stress. \nOne advantage of using VI-based actual crop coefficients\
    \ is the ability to account for variations in \nplant growth due to abnormal weather\
    \ conditions, e.g., the impact of a frost occurrence [20]. Using  \nVI-based crop\
    \ coefficients also allows obtaining the spatial variation of actual Kc (or Kcb)\
    \ within fields. \nIn addition they provide for a field-to-field description of\
    \ the variation of actual Kc (or Kcb) due to \nvariations in planting dates, plant\
    \ spacing and cultivars [11]. A review of the advantages and \ndisadvantages of\
    \ VI-based crop coefficients was presented by Allen et al. [21]. \nThe Normalized\
    \ Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; [22]) and the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index\
    \ \n(SAVI; [23]) are the most commonly VI used to estimate actual Kc and Kcb.\
    \ The formulation of both \nVI combines the reflected light in the red and near\
    \ infrared (NIR) bands, thus providing an indirect \nmeasure of the absorption\
    \ of red light by chlorophylls (a and b) and reflectance of NIR by the \nmesophyll\
    \ structure in leaves [17,24]. Choudhury et al. [25] refer that using SAVI instead\
    \ of NDVI \nallows extending the range over which the VI respond to the increase\
    \ in vegetation amount/density beyond \na LAI around 3, which is related with\
    \ NDVI saturation problems for high LAI values. In addition, the \nNDVI is considered\
    \ more sensitive than SAVI to soil background reflectance changes due to the moisture\
    \ \nof soil surface [7,13,26]. \nSeveral relationships between Kcb (or Kc) and\
    \ VI are reported in the literature for different \nvegetation types, with the\
    \ most recent studies focusing the Kcb estimation because plant transpiration\
    \ is \nmore directly related with the VI. Some examples of this approach consider\
    \ a linear relationship \nbetween Kcb and NDVI [13,20,25,27,28], and between Kcb\
    \ and SAVI [13,25,26] but an exponential \nrelationship between NDVI and Kc was\
    \ also considered [29]. A few studies report a Kcb estimation \nbased on fc or\
    \ LAI obtained through VI, including for field and tree crops [7,30,31]. However,\
    \ in most \nstudies, the relationship between Kcb and VI was established for non-stressed\
    \ conditions and for \nconditions of dry soil surface, which often do not represent\
    \ the actual conditions of crop management. \nVI derived crop coefficients often\
    \ do not account for the reduction in Kcb due to water or salinity  \nstress [7,11].\
    \ Then the above referred stress coefficient Ks should be considered to obtain\
    \ an actual Kc \nor Kcb, i.e., Kc act and Kcb act [1]. Most of those studies were\
    \ established for a single crop and its \nRemote Sens. 2015, 7 \n2376 \n \napplication\
    \ for other crops, particularly for discontinuous tree crops, is still limited.\
    \ Differently, the \napproach proposed by Mateos et al. [7], which approximates\
    \ Kcb using fc and VI, refers to several \ncrops and shows good results. However,\
    \ this application does not always allow estimating Kcb for \nperiods when the\
    \ soil is not yet fully covered by the crop. \nAlthough several equations were\
    \ proposed for approaching Kcb via VI, a consensual equation that \ncan be consistently\
    \ used for different vegetation types and conditions is still lacking. In such\
    \ context, a \ndensity coefficient (Kd) [12] may be used in the formulation of\
    \ Kcb through VI to help incorporating \nthe impact of vegetation density and\
    \ height. Such approach would allow Kcb to be computed for a \nrange of row crops,\
    \ orchards and vines, thus including conditions when soil is not fully covered\
    \ by the \ncrop. For further estimating Kc, a water balance modeling approach\
    \ adopting the dual crop coefficient \napproach [1] is required to estimate soil\
    \ evaporation and thus to estimate the evaporation coefficient Ke \nthat can be\
    \ combined with the VI based Kcb, i.e., Kc = Kcb + Ke. The SIMDualKc model [32],\
    \ which \nperforms a daily water balance of the surface soil layer, provides for\
    \ a daily Ke. Thus, by applying the \ndual coefficient approach and performing\
    \ the soil water balance, the SIMDualKc model provides \ninformation on the stress\
    \ coefficient Ks, on potential and actual Kcb, on Ke and ultimately on potential\
    \ \nand actual Kc. \nConsidering the advances and limitations discussed above,\
    \ particularly the need to represent actual \nrather than potential crop and evapotranspiration\
    \ conditions for irrigation management purposes, the \nmain objectives of this\
    \ study are: (i) developing and testing a new equation for estimating actual Kcb\
    \ \nbased on VI and considering the stress coefficient Ks and the density coefficient\
    \ Kd computed with the \nfraction of ground cover fc estimated with VI; (ii) developing\
    \ and testing a combined approach for \nestimation of the actual Kc using the\
    \ VI-based Kcb and the evaporation coefficient Ke obtained with a \ndaily soil\
    \ water balance model; and (iii) testing the adequacy of the approach to different\
    \ crop types, \nnamely maize, barley, and an olive orchard. \n2. Material and\
    \ Methods \n2.1. Study Areas \nThree crops were considered to test the approach\
    \ of actual Kc estimate based on reflectance VI in \ncombination with the SIMDualKc\
    \ soil water balance model: a super high density olive orchard, maize, \nand barley.\
    \ \nThe super high density olive orchard test site is located in Viana do Alentejo,\
    \ in South of Portugal \n(38°24′46′′ N, 7°43′38′′ W, 143 m a.s.l.; Figure 1).\
    \ This olive orchard occupies a total area of 78 ha in \nan undulating terrain.\
    \ The olive orchard was planted in 2006 in a hedgerow system with 1.35 m × 3.75\
    \ m \nspacing (1975 trees ha−1), and an orientation South-North. The olive trees\
    \ are of cultivar Arbequina. \nThe fraction of ground covered by the vegetation\
    \ (fc) was approximately 0.35 and tree height was around \n3.5 m. The procedure\

    \ with soil water \ncontent averaging 0.24 cm3·cm−3 at field capacity and 0.12\
    \ cm3·cm−3 at the wilting point. Ground data \nfrom two consecutive years (2011\
    \ and 2012) were collected and used to validate information of several \nagronomic\
    \ and biophysical parameters as detailed by Paço et al. [8] and Pôças et al. [33].\
    \ In 2012, \nRemote Sens. 2015, 7 \n2377 \n \nbetween February 20th and 25th,\
    \ an extremely heavy frost affected the orchard causing a strong leaf \nfall.\
    \ A severe pruning of the trees was therefore applied following the frost occurrence.\
    \ Some areas of \nthe olive orchard were more affected by the frost, and consequently\
    \ the pruning was not uniform along \nthe orchard, which increased the variability\
    \ of the vegetation conditions within the orchard in 2012. \n \nFigure 1. Study\
    \ areas location in Viana do Alentejo and Alpiarça, Portugal. \nThree farmer’s\
    \ fields of Quinta da Lagoalva de Cima located in Alpiarça, Ribatejo region, were\
    \ \nsurveyed for the maize crop [34]: (i) field 1 (39°17′33′′ N, 8°34′19′′ W,\
    \ 14 m a.s.l.); (ii) field 2 (39°17′45′′ \nN, 8°34′01′′ W, 14 m a.s.l.); and (iii)\
    \ field 3 (39°18′04′′ N, 8°32′22′′ W, 16 m a.s.l.), (Figure 1). Fields \nhave\
    \ a cropped area of approximately 30 ha. In 2010, the maize was cropped in both\
    \ fields 1 and 2, \nwhile in 2011 only field 1 was sowed; in 2012, fields 2 and\
    \ 3 were cropped with maize. The PR33Y74 \nmaize hybrid (FAO 600) was cultivated\
    \ with a density of approximately 82,000 plants ha−1. The length \nof each crop\
    \ growth stages for all maize fields and seasons is described in Table 1. The\
    \ crop growth \nstages were defined according to Allen et al. [1]: (i) initial\
    \ stage, from the sowing/planting until 10% \nRemote Sens. 2015, 7 \n2378 \n \n\
    of ground cover (Ini); (ii) development stage, from 10% of ground cover until\
    \ maximum ground cover \nby vegetation (Dev); (iii) mid-season stage, from full\
    \ cover until maturity (Mid), and (iv) late-season \nstage, from the beginning\
    \ of senescence and leaves yellowing until harvesting (Late). The observations\
    \ \nof fc were visually performed and adjusted with the help of photographs of\
    \ the ground shadow by the \ncrop near solar noon [34]. \nBarley was sown in field\
    \ 1; two seasons were studied: (i) 2012, a dry year, and (ii) 2012/2013, a wet\
    \ \nyear [35]. The barley field was cropped with 200 kg·ha−1 of malting barley\
    \ (Cv. Publican) seeds using \nan inter-row spacing of 0.15 m. The plants density\
    \ was measured before tillering, when the crop \nattained tree leaves, averaging\
    \ 342 and 319 plants per m2 respectively in 2012 and 2013. The lengths \nof the\
    \ crop growth stages are given in Table 1. The barley fc observations were performed\
    \ similarly to \nthe maize crop; furthermore, LAI measurements were also used\
    \ to estimate fc and therefore to confirm \nrelated observations as referred by\
    \ Pereira et al. [35]. \nTable 1. Crop growth stages of maize and barley crops\

    \ The procedure included image calibration using the \ncoefficients proposed in\
    \ the literature for Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+ [37,38]. The VI were \ncalculated\
    \ on a pixel-by-pixel basis and averaged for the entire study plot in each study\
    \ area. Pixels \nfrom the edges of the fields and from roads within the olive\
    \ orchard were not considered. The VI \ncomputed for the study were the Normalized\
    \ Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; [22]) and the Soil \nAdjusted Vegetation\
    \ Index (SAVI; [23]). \n2.3. SIMDualKc \nThe SIMDualKc is a soil water balance\
    \ model that applies the dual crop coefficient approach, thus \nseparately computing\
    \ the daily soil evaporation and crop transpiration [32,39]. This model has been\
    \ \nsuccessfully applied to estimate ET and assess Kc of a wide range of field\
    \ crops [34,35,39], including \ntree crops [8,40]. Data from SIMDualKc were used\
    \ as benchmark, i.e., a standard against which \nRemote Sens. 2015, 7 \n2380 \n\
    \ \ncomparisons can be done, mainly for the comparison of Kc and Kcb results.\
    \ SIMDualKc was previously \ncalibrated using ground data for the three crops,\
    \ as described later in this section. \nIn SIMDualKc, Kcb is computed with the\
    \ equation below [12,32] where impacts of plant density \nand/or leaf area are\
    \ taken into consideration by a density coefficient: \nܭ௖௕ ൌ ܭ௖ ௠௜௡൅ܭௗ൫ܭ௖௕௙௨௟௟\
    \ െܭ௖௠௜௡൯ \n(1)\nwhere Kd is the crop density coefficient, Kcb full is the estimated\
    \ basal Kcb for peak plant growth \nconditions having nearly full ground cover\
    \ (or LAI > 3), and Kc min is the minimum Kc for bare soil (in \nthe absence of\
    \ vegetation). The Kc min value is about 0.15 under typical agricultural conditions\
    \ and \nranges 0.0–0.15 for native vegetation depending on rainfall frequency.\
    \ Kcb is adjusted by the model for \nlocal climatic conditions where the average\
    \ minimum relative humidity differs from 45% and/or the \naverage wind speed is\
    \ different from 2 m·s−1 [1,12,32]. Kd is computed with the equation proposed\
    \ by \nAllen and Pereira [12]: \nܭௗ ൌ ݉݅݊ ቆ1,ܯ௅݂௖௘௙௙,݂௖௘௙௙\nቀ ଵ\nଵା௛ቁቇ \n(2)\n\
    where fc eff is the effective fraction of ground covered or shaded by vegetation\
    \ near solar noon [ ], ML \nis a multiplier [ ] on fc eff describing the effect\
    \ of canopy density on shading and on maximum relative \nET per fraction of ground\
    \ shaded (to simulate the physical limits imposed on water flux through the \n\
    plant root, stem and leaf systems), and h is the mean height of the vegetation\
    \ [m]. Therefore, the use of \nKd allows incorporating the impact of vegetation\
    \ density and height in the estimation of Kcb. Kd has \nalso been used in other\
    \ studies to adjust Kcb to actual density conditions for full cover crops [41]\
    \ and in \npartial cover crops using both ground [42] or remote sensing data [43].\
    \ \nWhen soil water deficit occurs, the stress coefficient Ks [ ] is computed\
    \ by the model using a daily \nsoil water balance for the entire root zone. Ks\
    \ is expressed as a linear function of the root zone \ndepletion Dr [1,32]: \n\
    ܭ௦ ൌ \n்஺ௐି ஽ೝ\n்஺ௐିோ஺ௐ ൌ\n்஺ௐି ஽ೝ\nሺଵି௣ሻ்஺ௐ, for Dr > RAW \n(3)\nܭ௦ ൌ 1, for\
    \ Dr ≤ RAW \n(4)\nwhere TAW and RAW are, respectively, the total and readily available\
    \ soil water [mm], Dr is the root \nzone depletion [mm], and p is the depletion\
    \ fraction for no stress [ ]. Kcb is multiplied by Ks to account \nfor the effects\
    \ of soil water stress and thus obtaining Kcb act. \nThe calculation of the soil\
    \ evaporation coefficient Ke [ ] follows the procedures proposed by [1,44] \n\
    which include the daily water balance of the evaporation soil surface layer that\
    \ allows to compute the \nevaporation reduction coefficient Kr [ ] from the cumulative\
    \ depth of water depleted (evaporated) from \nthe topsoil [1]. It results that\
    \ Ke is then computed daily with: \nܭ௘ ൌ ܭ௥ሺܭ௖ ௠௔௫ െܭ௖௕ሻ ൑ ݂௘௪ܭ௖௠௔௫ \n(5)\nas\
    \ a function of Kc max, the maximum value of Kc following rain or an irrigation\
    \ event and Kcb in that \nday (Equation (1)) after adjustment with Kr. Ke is limited\
    \ to few Kc max that represents the fraction of Kc \nmax that refers to the fraction\
    \ few of the soil that is both exposed and wetted, i.e., the fraction of soil\
    \ \nsurface from which most evaporation occurs. The background and computation\
    \ of Kcb, Ks and Ke in \nSIMDualKc is described in detail by Rosa et al. [32].\
    \ \nRemote Sens. 2015, 7 \n2381 \n \nThe calibration of SIMDualKc aims at optimizing\
    \ the crop parameters Kcb and p relative to the \nvarious crop growth stages,\
    \ as well as the soil evaporation parameters, the deep percolation \nparameters,\
    \ and the runoff curve number (CN) using trial and error procedures until small\
    \ errors were \nachieved. Further information is provided by [8,34,35]. For the\
    \ olive orchard, the calibration was \nperformed comparing daily transpiration\
    \ data simulated with those obtained with sapflow \nmeasurements (and also eddy\
    \ covariance and energy balance measurements as auxiliary data for \ncalibration\
    \ and data quality screening), as described in Paço et al. [8]. For the maize\
    \ and barley crops, \nthe calibration was performed by minimizing the differences\
    \ between observed and simulated soil \nwater content, as described in Paredes\
    \ et al. [34] and Pereira et al. [35]. In all cases, the results of \ngoodness\
    \ of fit indicators showed good model performance and small errors of estimates\
    \ [8,34,35]. \nFurthermore, ET partitioning was performed in other studies, e.g.,\
    \ testing the soil evaporation \nalgorithm through comparing simulated with microlysimeter\
    \ observations [45,46], crop transpiration \nagainst sap flow measurements [8,40]\
    \ and crop ET compared with eddy covariance ET data [47]. An \nexample of the\
    \ results of the model calibration for barley is presented in Figure 2, which\
    \ shows that the \nsimulated soil water content accurately follows the dynamics\
    \ of observations throughout the barley \ncrop season [35]. \n \nFigure 2. Observed\
    \ () and simulated (—–) daily soil water content (SWC) after the \ncalibration\

    \ Vegetation Indices \nThe proposed methodology is based on the dual crop coefficient\
    \ approach, thus integrating daily \nKcb and Ke, and considering Ks when water\
    \ stress occurs [1,12]. Considering this approach, a new \nequation was developed\

    \ and to tree crops with bare soil by including Kd. For tree crops having an \n\
    active ground cover, Kc min is replaced by a Kcb cover, corresponding to the Kcb\
    \ of the ground cover in the \nabsence of tree foliage [12]. Kd in Equation (6)\

    \ considered less sensitive \nto soil background reflectance variability than\
    \ other VI, thus with higher potential for application in \ntree crops with discontinuous\
    \ ground cover. NDVImax was set to 0.75–0.85 for the three crops, and the \nvalue\
    \ 0.10 was set for NDVImin, both based on reference values for, respectively,\
    \ an irrigated \nagricultural field with full cover and a bare soil [48–50]. When\
    \ SAVI was considered, the SAVImin was \nset to 0.09 while the SAVImax was adjusted\
    \ to 0.75 according to Mateos et al. [7]. \nThe Kc min was set to a value between\
    \ 0.10 and 0.15 (0.13 was considered in this study) according to \nvalues proposed\
    \ by Allen and Pereira [12]. For the olive orchard, Kcb cover was considered instead\
    \ of  \nKc min and set to a value between 0.15 and 0.18 (0.17 was considered in\
    \ this study) due to the presence \nof sparse vegetation cover between tree rows.\
    \ Reference values for several parameters considered in \nthe computation of Equation\
    \ (6) can be found in Allen and Pereira [12]. Kd was computed with \nEquation\
    \ (2) where, in a first approach, the fc eff was the same considered in SIMDualKc,\
    \ which was \nbased in field observations (fc field). In a second approach, fc\
    \ eff was computed using an equation based \non vegetation indices derived from\

    \ and 1) depending upon the maximum VI value \nin each crop stage. VIi is the\
    \ average VI of the study area pixels for each date, VImax and VImin \ncorrespond\
    \ to the VI respectively for maximum and minimum vegetation cover. Both NDVI and\
    \ SAVI \nmay be used, with the latter producing better results for incomplete\
    \ cover crops, e.g., olive orchards. \nNDVImax and NDVImin were set according\
    \ to references in the literature [48–50] (Table 4). For the \nsuper high density\
    \ olive orchard, SAVImax and SAVImin were considered following values proposed\
    \ by \nRemote Sens. 2015, 7 \n2383 \n \nMateos et al. [7] (Table 4). The parameter\
    \ β2 corresponds to an adjustment coefficient associated with \ncrop senescence\
    \ and leaves yellowing. Both NDVI and SAVI are sensitive to leaf senescence thus\
    \ \nyielding smaller values at the end of the growing cycle than before peak development\
    \ was  \nreached [51]. Therefore, the β2 adjustment is considered to compensate\
    \ the decrease in VI due to the \nsenescence and/or yellowing of plants, which\
    \ is independent from fc. Values of β2 are presented in \nTable 4. \nTable 4.\

    \ in canopies vegetation. Values of β1 are presented in Table 4. \nMost of the\
    \ optical VI track the effects of long-term water stress on plants but do not\
    \ allow the early \ndetection of water stress [52]. Therefore, Equation (6) expresses\
    \ the potential Kcb, thus transpiration \noccurring at maximum rate. However,\
    \ the occurrence of water stress cause a decrease of the potential \nvalue and\
    \ Ks must be applied to obtain actual Kcb VI. In the current approach, Ks computed\
    \ with \nSIMDualKc was used. The dates when water stress was detected through\
    \ the daily soil water balance \nare given in Table 2. Therefore, hereafter, the\
    \ actual Kcb VI refers to the Kcb VI computed by  \nEquation (6) multiplied by\
    \ the Ks computed with SIMDualKc. \nRemote Sens. 2015, 7 \n2384 \n \nFor Kc estimation\
    \ from VI, hereafter named Kc VI, the Ke computed with SIMDualKc was combined\
    \ \nwith the Kcb VI, i.e., Kc VI = Ke + Kcb VI. A similar combined approach was\
    \ reported by Mateos et al. [7]. \nThe results of Kcb VI and Kc VI were compared\
    \ with the actual Kcb and Kc computed with SIMDualKc \nbased on field data, later\
    \ referred as Kcb SIMDualKc and Kc SIMDualKc, respectively. \nBecause Ks and Ke\
    \ used in the estimation of actual Kc VI are computed with SIMDualKc, the results\
    \ \nof comparing actual Kc VI with Kc SIMDualKc are somehow influenced by the\
    \ fact that values of Ks and Ke \nused in both cases are the same. Nevertheless,\
    \ this fact does not impede the assessment of the \ncomputation of the actual\
    \ Kcb VI because this is the procedure that gives the possibility to compare the\
    \ \nactual crop coefficients from both approaches and retrieves useful information\
    \ from satellite imagery \naiming at irrigation management and farmer advising.\
    \ \nA linear regression forced through the origin was used for the comparisons\
    \ and the corresponding \nregression and determination coefficients were consequently\
    \ used as indicators. Additionally, the  \nroot-mean-square deviation (RMSD; Equation\
    \ (8)) and the relative mean deviation (RMD; Equation \n(9)) were used to compare\
    \ two sets of data, with Xi relative to estimations with SIMDualKc, having \n\
    mean ܺ ഥ , and Yi relative to the VI estimates (i = 1,2, ..., n). \nܴܯܵܦ ൌ ඨ∑\n\

    Since the database available for this study only comprises 15 VI observations\
    \ for maize and olive \nand seven for barley (Table 2), the validation of Kcb\
    \ estimated based on VI was performed using the  \n“leave-one-out” (LOO) cross-validation\
    \ [53]. Applications of the LOO cross-validation in remote \nsensing studies are\
    \ provided by [54,55]. The LOO cross-validation evaluates the model performance\
    \ \nfor observations not considered in the estimation step, thus providing independent\
    \ estimates of the \npredictive capability of the selected models. This technique\
    \ consists in the removal of one observation \nfrom the dataset used and the estimation\
    \ of a new regression model with the remaining observations. \nThis new regression\
    \ model is used to estimate the Kcb VI of the observation withdrawn (Kcb VI LOO).\
    \ \nEquations (8) and (9) were also used to estimate the goodness of cross-validation\
    \ results, with Xi and \nYi representing respectively Kcb SimDualKc and Kcb VI\
    \ LOO data. A similar approach was considered for the \nKc and fc estimated based\
    \ on VI. \n3. Results \n3.1. Estimation of the Fraction of Ground Cover from VI\
    \ \nThe results of fc estimated from NDVI (fc VI; Equation (7)) were compared\
    \ with fc based on field \nobservations (fc field) for the maize and barley crops\
    \ (Figure 3). The comparison of fc VI and fc field have \nshown a good agreement\
    \ for both crops, with R2 ≥ 0.81 and the regression coefficient b close to 1.0\
    \ \n(Figure 3). For maize, RMSD was 0.10 and RMD 10.6%, while for barley RMSD\
    \ was 0.06 and RMD \nwas 8.1%. \nRemote Sens. 2015, 7 \n2385 \n \n \nFigure 3.\
    \ Comparison of the fraction of ground cover by vegetation derived from NDVI \
    \ \n(fc VI) with the fc obtained from field observations (fc field) for (a) maize\
    \ and (b) barley. \nFor the olive crop, due to the low variability of fc field\
    \ values, a regression for comparing fc VI and  \nfc field was not considered.\
    \ The fraction of ground cover for this tree crop with persistent leaves is \n\
    nearly constant throughout the year, except for the pruning period. As such, for\
    \ the analysis of the fc VI \nresults, only the indicators of residual estimation\
    \ deviations were used: RMSD = 0.22 and  \nRMD = 69.2%. When SAVI was used for\
    \ the estimation of fc VI results of all indicators improved \nmuch, with RMSD=\
    \ 0.02 and RMD = 5.5%. The absolute mean differences between the fc VI and the\
    \ fc \nfield for the olive orchard were small, ranging from 0.003 to 0.046. Contrarily,\
    \ for the annual crops \n(maize and barley), the use of SAVI in the estimation\
    \ of fc VI did not improve the residual  \nestimation deviations. \nResults of\
    \ cross validation show a good performance of the fc VI estimation, with RMSD\
    \ of 0.06. \n0.04, and 0.01 respectively for maize, barley and olive. RMD results\
    \ for the cross validation varied \nbetween 2.6% for olive and 7.5% for maize.\
    \ \n3.2. Estimation of Kcb from Reflectance-Based Vegetation Indices (Kcb VI)\
    \ \nThe Kcb VI (Equation (6)) was adjusted using the Ks derived from SIMDualKc\
    \ computations for the \ndates when stress occurred (Table 2) to obtain the actual\
    \ Kcb VI. The values of Kcb SIMDualKc used in \ncomparisons with Kcb VI were also\
    \ adjusted to water stress using Ks. Both NDVI and SAVI were tested \nfor the\
    \ estimation of Kcb VI and the results obtained with the two VI were compared.\
    \  \nThe comparison of actual Kcb VI with actual Kcb SIMDualKc for the studied\
    \ crops is presented in Figure 4. \nThe Kcb VI values in Figure 4 were estimated\
    \ using fc NDVI (Equation (7)) with the objective of fully \nestimating actual\
    \ Kcb from reflectance-based vegetation indices. Figure 4a shows Kcb VI for maize\
    \ when \nusing NDVI, which has a determination coefficient (R2) lower than using\
    \ SAVI (Figure 4b) but has a \nhigher regression coefficient (b = 0.98) relative\
    \ to SAVI (Table 5). Thus, Kcb SAVI underestimates Kcb \nvalues. For barley (Figure\
    \ 4c,d) both b and R2 are better when using NDVI (Table 5). For the olive \norchard\
    \ estimating Kcb VI with SAVI leads to b equal to 1.22 and a R2 equal to 0.83;\
    \ when using NDVI \nthere is an overestimation of the Kcb values, b = 1.8 (Figure\

    \ when adopting SAVI. The regression coefficient b = 0.98 when NDVI \nis used\

    \ crop in the year when water stress occurred. Results show that actual Kcb VI\

    \ of weather conditions in those years are well \napparent through the numerous\
    \ peaks of the evaporation coefficient Ke due to both rainfall and \nirrigation\

    \ Kc VI corresponding to the same dates when the Kcb VI were obtained for selected\

    4.1. Estimation of the Fraction of Ground Cover from Vegetation Indices \nThe\
    \ statistical results relative to the estimation of fc VI indicate a good performance\
    \ of Equation (7) \nfor the annual crops studied (maize and barley). The R2 values\
    \ observed when comparing fc VI with  \nfc field are highly significant for both\
    \ crops (Figure 3). These R2 values are within the range of the values \nreported\
    \ by Trout et al. [56] for the estimation of canopy cover using NDVI derived from\
    \ a \nmultispectral camera for a set of 11 annual and perennial horticultural\
    \ crops. Purevdorj et al. [57] \nreported similar R2 results when estimating the\
    \ percentage of vegetation cover in grasslands and lawn \ngrass using NDVI derived\
    \ from AVHRR satellite images, thus with a coarser spatial resolution. \nEstimated\
    \ deviations are small, for both maize and barley, with RMSD of 0.10 and 0.06,\
    \ respectively. \nThe estimation of fc in the olive orchard also showed good estimation,\
    \ with low RMD < 10%. When \nthe two years studied (2011 and 2012) were analyzed\
    \ separately, the average absolute deviations \nbetween fc VI and fc field were\
    \ slightly higher in 2012 than in 2011. These results are likely due to the \n\
    larger variability in the vegetation conditions within the orchard in 2012 because\
    \ a severe frost \noccurred in February which was followed by an heavy and non-uniform\
    \ pruning that increased the \nvariability of fc within the orchard as discussed\
    \ by Paço et al. [8]. \nThe better performance of SAVI for the estimation of fc\
    \ VI in the high density olive orchard, having \na large fraction of soil exposed,\
    \ is likely due to the lower sensitivity of this VI to soil background  \ninfluence\
    \ [23]. Similar conclusions were reported by Purevdorj et al. [57] relative to\
    \ the better \nperformance of SAVI to estimate the vegetation cover for low crop\
    \ densities. Differently, in a study \nwith savannah-type open woodlands dominated\
    \ by evergreen oak species (montados or dehesa), the \nNDVI performed slightly\
    \ better than SAVI for the estimation of tree canopy cover [58] but the study\
    \ \nareas were characterized by an extremely variable understory including bare\
    \ soil, dry grass and a few \nevergreen shrubs that impacted the VIs values as\
    \ discussed by the authors. \n4.2. Estimation of Actual Kcb from Reflectance-Based\
    \ Vegetation Indices (Kcb VI) \nThe R2 results relative to the regression comparing\
    \ the actual Kcb VI with Kcb SIMDualKc for maize were \nhighly significant using\
    \ NDVI (Table 5). Although using NDVI led to a lower R2 than SAVI, the \nregression\
    \ coefficient comparing Kcb SAVI with Kcb SIMDualKc (b = 0.79; Table 5) indicates\
    \ an \nunderestimation of Kcb SAVI values. The regression coefficient obtained\
    \ when comparing Kcb NDVI with \nKcb SIMDualKc is much better (b = 0.98; Table\
    \ 5), which may be related with the tendency of NDVI \nreaching a maximum value\
    \ at about the same time as Kcb, i.e., at a LAI around 3 [14,59]. Contrarily,\
    \ \nSAVI tends to continue increasing for LAI above 3 [21,25,60]. Thus, according\
    \ to Allen et al. [21], the \nNDVI supports better than SAVI the estimation of\
    \ Kc and Kcb in crops reaching high LAI values as for \nthe full cover crops considered\
    \ in the current study. \nThe base data on maize refers to three different seasons\
    \ and three different fields, which results in a \nlarge variability of soil,\
    \ climate and crop management conditions. A large variability of Kcb act was \n\
    therefore observed despite the potential/standard Kcb was the same after appropriate\
    \ calibration of \nSIMDualKc [34]. This variability contributed for a larger variance\
    \ of the actual Kcb VI and Kcb SIMDualKc \nand made it more difficult to parameterize\
    \ a single value for Kc min and β1 (Equations (6) and (7), \nRemote Sens. 2015,\
    \ 7 \n2392 \n \nrespectively) when considering all three maize seasons and three\
    \ cropped fields. The variability \nconditions observed in the three different\
    \ fields and seasons during the initial and development stages \nmay justify why\
    \ comparing Kcb NDVI with Kcb SIMDualKc leads to a smaller R2 (Table 5). \nThe\
    \ actual Kcb NDVI obtained for the maize mid-season stage averaged 0.92 (Table\
    \ 6). This value \nrelates with the water stress that occurred during the mid-season\
    \ stage of 2010 in both surveyed fields \nwhich was detected in two of the images,\
    \ particularly that of 30 July 2010. The SIMDualKc computed \nKs values for this\
    \ date were 0.55 and 0.29 respectively for field 1 and field 2. Such low Ks values\
    \ \nhighly impacted actual Kcb for this stage. Figure 6a shows well the impact\
    \ of water stress during that \nperiod, with the Kcb act curve largely below the\
    \ Kcb curve. The actual Kcb NDVI are within the range of \nvalues presented by\
    \ Padilla et al. [31]. Relative to the late season, the range of Kcb NDVI values\
    \ in  \nTable 6 refer to three images available for this period. One of these\
    \ images was captured the day prior \nto harvest (19 September 2011 in field 1)\
    \ and the Kcb NDVI was then equal to 0.48, therefore similar to \nthe Kcb end\
    \ proposed by Allen et al. [1], Kcb end = 0.5. However, values for Kcb end relate\
    \ to crop \nmanagement and therefore are difficult to be compared with other values\
    \ in literature. \nFor the regression comparing the actual Kcb VI and Kcb SIMDualKc\
    \ for barley the statistical indicators \nshow that NDVI performed better, both\
    \ in terms of the regression and determination coefficients and \nRMSD and RMD\
    \ (Table 5 and Figure 4c,d). The actual Kcb NDVI obtained for the initial crop\
    \ growth stage \n(actual Kcb ini NDVI = 0.18; Table 6) is just slightly higher\
    \ than the value presented by Allen et al. [1],  \nKcb ini = 0.15, which relates\
    \ with the fact that no water stress occurred in that stage (Figure 6b). Kcb NDVI\
    \ \nvalues for the development growth stage ranged between 0.25 and 0.91 (Table\
    \ 6), which refer to values \ncommonly accepted [1]. The actual Kcb mid NDVI =\
    \ 0.87 (Table 6) is lower than the standard Kcb = 1.10 \nproposed by Allen et\
    \ al. [1] and values obtained for crops with similar canopy [30,31,61]. This is\
    \ likely \ndue to different vegetation conditions in the 2012/2013 crop season\
    \ and to the adjustment to climate [35]. \nThe Kcb NDVI presented in Table 6 for\
    \ the late season ranged between 0.86 and 0.69 and refer to two \nimages available\
    \ for that stage. These images provided for likely appropriate actual Kcb values\
    \ and \ncompared well with values obtained with SIMDualKc (Figure 6b, [35]). \n\
    For the olive orchard, results obtained with SAVI are good (Figure 5) and in agreement\
    \ with the \nabove mentioned lower sensitivity of this VI to changes in soil background\
    \ [23], which is particularly \nrelevant for tree crops with discontinuous ground\
    \ cover. Furthermore, SAVI improves the linearity \nbetween the VI and biophysical\
    \ parameters as observed by other researchers [25,56]. Mateos et al. [7] \nalso\
    \ obtained good results when using SAVI for estimating Kcb in peach and mandarin\
    \ orchards. \nContrarily, in a study with grapevine, Campos et al. [13] did not\
    \ find significant improvements in the \naccuracy when using SAVI but the application\
    \ excluded days with wet soil. Accurate results for olive \nin the current study\
    \ are likely due to the use of Kd in Equation (6). \nThe average Kcb SAVI value\
    \ obtained for the mid-season stage in olive (0.37; Table 6 and Figure 5c) \n\
    was affected by the occurrence of water stress in four out of the eight dates\
    \ considered in this stage, \nwith Ks < 0.77 in two of these dates. The impacts\
    \ of water stress on Kcb is clearly shown in the \nexample presented in Figure\
    \ 6c, with the Kcb act curve laying bellow the Kcb curve during the  \nmid-season.\
    \ The actual Kcb SAVI for this stage would increase to 0.42 when only dates without\
    \ water \nstress or with very mild stress (Ks > 0.95) are considered. The actual\
    \ Kcb SAVI values for olive orchards \nfor the mid- and late-seasons, respectively\
    \ 0.37 and ranging 0.40 to 0.33 (Table 6), are within the range \nof values for\
    \ olive orchards with an effective fraction of ground cover (fc eff) between 0.25\
    \ and 0.5, \nRemote Sens. 2015, 7 \n2393 \n \nwith a Kcb mid ranging between 0.35\
    \ and 0.55 and Kcb end ranging from 0.30 to 0.50 [12]. During the \ninitial stage,\
    \ some sparse vegetation was growing in the inter-rows, thus Kcb was only slightly\
    \ \ninfluenced by this sparse vegetation. Consequently, Kcb ini SAVI = 0.33 was\
    \ an appropriate value for  \nthis orchard. \nOverall results obtained have shown\
    \ a good performance of the Kcb VI Equation (6) for all three \ncrops, particularly\
    \ integrating results of fc VI when computing the density coefficient Kd used\
    \ in \nEquation (6). It must be stressed that the use of Kd, which integrates\
    \ the information on fc and crop \nheight, and of Kc min provided good results\
    \ in modeling the actual Kcb VI (Equation (6)) for crops with \nvery different\
    \ canopy structures and ground cover conditions as those used in this study (continuous\
    \ \nversus discontinuous ground cover) for the whole crop season including when\
    \ water stress  \nwas observed. \n4.3. Estimation of Actual Kc by Combining Kcb\
    \ VI with Ke from SIMDualKc (Kc VI) \nThe statistical indicators from comparing\
    \ the actual Kc VI with Kc SIMDualKc show a good performance \nof the model for\
    \ the three crops (Table 7 and Figure 7). The deviations of estimate are very\
    \ low for \nolive and barley and slightly higher for maize. Results are in agreement\
    \ with those discussed for Kcb VI, \nwhich is a component of Kc VI. \nFor the\
    \ maize crop, the actual Kc NDVI values obtained for the development stage ranged\
    \ between \n0.90 and 1.30, which relate with a large variability of Ke values,\
    \ as for the example in Figure 6a. The \naverage Kc NDVI = 0.98 ± 0.11 for the\
    \ mid-season (Table 8) reflects also a large variability as \nexemplified in Figure\
    \ 6a, where one value exceeds 1.20 and the other, due to water stress, is as low\
    \ as \n0.40. When only cases without water stress are considered, Kc VI increases\
    \ to 1.14, a value close to the \nKc reported by Gonzalez-Piqueras et al. [26].\
    \ Regarding the Kc NDVI values for the late-season, values \nobtained are likely\
    \ to occur because they are within the interval limited by the Kc values at mid-season\
    \ \nand those expected for end season. \nThe actual Kc NDVI estimated for the\
    \ initial and development stages for barley (0.78 and 0.75–1.18; \nTable 8) reflects\
    \ the abundance of rainfall during these stages, with various Ke peaks occurring\
    \ then \n(Figure 6b). For the mid-season stage the value obtained is lower than\
    \ the values estimated with \nSIMDualKc (Kc SIMDualKc = 0.99), thus indicating\
    \ an underestimation of Kc. The average value obtained \nfor the late-season stage\
    \ (0.88) is close to that obtained by Liu et al. [62] for the period between wax\
    \ \nripeness and harvesting (equal to 0.83). \nThe results obtained for the olive\
    \ orchard show a very good performance of the model for \nestimating Kc SAVI (Figure\
    \ 7c). The average results of Kc SAVI (Table 8) are within the range of those\
    \ \nproposed by Allen and Pereira [12] for an fc eff between 0.25 and 0.50, which\
    \ vary between 0.80 for the \nKc ini (considering an active ground cover), 0.40–0.60\
    \ for the Kc mid (no active ground cover), and  \n0.35–0.75 for the Kc end (depending\
    \ on the ground cover). The results obtained throughout the year \nfollow a pattern\
    \ similar to results reported by other authors [43,63], as discussed by Paço et\
    \ al. [8]. \nIt is important to highlight that results presented herein correspond\
    \ to actual Kc, thus reflecting the \nmanagement options observed in the study\
    \ areas. \n \n \nRemote Sens. 2015, 7 \n2394 \n \n5. Conclusions \nThe overall\
    \ results for the three crops—Maize, barley and olive—indicate that the newly\
    \ proposed \nEquation (7) adequately models the fraction of soil covered by vegetation\
    \ throughout the crop season. \nThe results obtained indicate a better performance\
    \ of SAVI for the computation of the fraction of \nground cover for the incomplete\
    \ cover crop, olive, and of the NDVI for the annual crops, maize  \nand barley.\
    \ \nUsing the novel Equation (6), which applies a density coefficient, the estimation\
    \ of actual basal \ncrop coefficients through reflectance-based vegetation indices\
    \ was successful, with good accuracy. The \nuse of NDVI was preferred for maize\
    \ and barley and SAVI was more accurate for olive. These results \nare consistent\
    \ with the lower sensitivity of SAVI to changes of reflectance in soil background\
    \ due to \nsoil moisture. This approach allowed considering the whole crop season,\
    \ including periods when the \nsoil cover by vegetation is low, as in the initial\
    \ and development growth stages, which was not \nconsidered in several studies\
    \ previously published in the literature. The use of the density coefficient \n\
    allowed considering crops with different canopy structures and incorporating the\
    \ impact of vegetation \ndensity and height. The use of the stress coefficient\
    \ computed with the soil water balance SIMDualKc \nmade it possible to apply the\
    \ methodology not only in days when soil water was adequate to sustain \nfull\
    \ plant transpiration but also in days when heavy water stress conditions occurred,\
    \ contrarily to most \nof the approaches previously published that do not account\
    \ for the crop water stress in  \ntheir formulation. \nThe proposed methodology\
    \ for estimating actual crop coefficients follows a dual crop coefficient \napproach\
    \ by combining a remotely sensed basal crop coefficient and an evaporation coefficient\
    \ \ncomputed with the soil water balance SIMDualKc. Therefore, the approach allows\
    \ integrating the \neffect of plant transpiration with that of soil evaporation.\
    \ \nThe approaches proposed in this study, combining VI data with soil water balance\
    \ data, provide for \nan operational methodology to support irrigation management\
    \ considering the actual cropping \nconditions and associating real time satellite\
    \ information with irrigation scheduling models potentially \napplicable to diverse\
    \ crop types. Nevertheless, further studies are desirable to better test and implement\
    \ \nthe methodology, particularly for other crops and using a larger number of\
    \ image dates. \nAcknowledgments \nThis study was supported by European Union\

  relevance_evaluation:
    explanation: The paper is about estimating actual crop coefficients (Kcb act)
      using remotely sensed vegetation indices and soil water balance data. The specific
      point that is being made in the section you highlighted is that the new equation
      developed in the study is more accurate than the existing method for estimating
      Kcb act, particularly for the olive orchard. This is significant because the
      olive orchard is a crop that is particularly sensitive to water stress, and
      therefore accurate estimation of Kcb act is important for efficient irrigation
      management.
    extract_1: The statistical indicators relative to the comparison between Kcb VI
      and Kcb SIMDualKc for maize were highly significant using NDVI (Table 5). Although
      using NDVI led to a lower R2 than SAVI, the regression coefficient comparing
      Kcb SAVI with Kcb SIMDualKc (b = 0.79; Table 5) indicates an underestimation
      of Kcb SAVI values. The regression coefficient obtained when comparing Kcb NDVI
      with Kcb SIMDualKc is much better (b = 0.98; Table 5), which may be related
      with the tendency of NDVI reaching a maximum value at about the same time as
      Kcb, i.e., at a LAI around 3 [14,59]. Contrarily, SAVI tends to continue increasing
      for LAI above 3 [21,25,60]. Thus, according to Allen et al. [21], the NDVI supports
      better than SAVI the estimation of Kc and Kcb in crops reaching high LAI values
      as for the full cover crops considered in the current study.
    extract_2: For the regression comparing the actual Kcb VI and Kcb SIMDualKc for
      barley the statistical indicators show that NDVI performed better, both in terms
      of the regression and determination coefficients and RMSD and RMD (Table 5 and
      Figure 4c,d). The actual Kcb NDVI obtained for the initial crop growth stage
      (actual Kcb ini NDVI = 0.18; Table 6) is just slightly higher than the value
      presented by Allen et al. [1], Kcb ini = 0.15, which relates with the fact that
      no water stress occurred in that stage (Figure 6b). Kcb NDVI values for the
      development growth stage ranged between 0.25 and 0.91 (Table 6), which refer
      to values commonly accepted [1]. The actual Kcb mid NDVI = 0.87 (Table 6) is
      lower than the standard Kcb = 1.10 proposed by Allen et al. [1] and values obtained
      for crops with similar canopy [30,31,61]. This is likely due to different vegetation
      conditions in the 2012/2013 crop season and to the adjustment to climate [35].
      The Kcb NDVI presented in Table 6 for the late season ranged between 0.86 and
      0.69 and refer to two images available for that stage. These images provided
      for likely appropriate actual Kcb values and compared well with values obtained
      with SIMDualKc (Figure 6b, [35]).
    limitations: The study was conducted in only three crops, and it is not clear
      how well the new equation will generalize to other crops. Additionally, the
      study was conducted in a single location, and it is not clear how well the new
      equation will perform in different climates and soil types.

    In this work, the Loma de Quinto irrigation district, located in Zaragoza (Spain)
    was characterised, and water use (WU) was assessed. The study was performed to
    contribute to the diagnostic analysis phase of an incipient management improvement
    process in this sprinkler-irrigated district. The objectives of this first paper
    of the series include: (1) characterising the irrigation systems, soil types and
    crops; (2) evaluating irrigation performance through the relationship between
    on-farm WU and net irrigation requirements (NIR); (3) identifying factors affecting
    on-farm WU. In order to accomplish these objectives, statistical analyses of field
    data, district records on WU and farmers’ interviews were performed. Technical
    deficiencies were detected in solid-sets, centre-pivots and linear-moves. A seasonal
    irrigation performance index (SIPI), defined as the percentage of NIR to seasonal
    water billing, was determined at each plot and for each of the three study years.
    The average inter-annual SIPI amounted to 127%, indicating that crops in the district
    were consistently water stressed. An analysis of the SIPI for the main crops in
    the district revealed that water stress was more intense in drought resistant
    and/or heavily subsidised crops (SIPI for sunflower was 142%). The average irrigation
    interval (12.3 days) and irrigation depth (44 mm) were too high for some of the
    soils in the district. Farmers adjusted the irrigation interval to meet the seasonal
    change in irrigation requirements. The irrigation depth was reduced in windy days.
    In two of the three study years, large plots used less water than small plots,
    at a rate of about −5 mm ha−1. The high cost of irrigation water in relation to
    crop revenues, the technical deficiencies of the irrigation systems, and the limitations
    imposed by climate and soils appeared to be major causes of local water management
    problems. In a companion paper, irrigation evaluations and simulations are presented,
    and irrigation schedules for optimal crop yield are proposed and evaluated via
    simulation. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Sprinkler
    irrigationIrrigation performanceWater useFarm management 1. Introduction In many
    irrigation projects around the world, water use (WU) efficiencies are below the
    expected levels (Clemmens and Dedrick, 1992). Low efficiency can be attributed
    to inadequate irrigation structures, poor on-farm management and/or insufficient
    water availability. Currently, farmers are confronted with severe economical and
    environmental pressures. In the European Union, the Common Agricultural Policy
    (CAP) seeks to ensure the sustainability of agricultural systems without creating
    surpluses. Agricultural products must become more competitive in markets that
    are increasingly open at the international level (De Juan et al., 1996). In this
    context, farmers must change their production systems so that water is considered
    not only as a limited resource, but also as a production factor and a relevant
    economic input. A number of on-farm irrigation performance indexes have been defined
    (Merriam and Keller, 1978, Burt et al., 1997). These indexes quantify water management,
    and serve to identify problematic areas within an irrigated area. However, they
    do not inform on the reasons for the observed level of performance or provide
    guidance on how to improve it. Addressing performance problems is complex since
    improvement in farm water management must be viewed in the context of overall
    farm management. A Management Improvement Program (MIP) (Dedrick et al., 1993,
    Dedrick et al., 2000) is an effective way to identify both the strengths and the
    weaknesses of irrigated agriculture. The concept of MIP has evolved over the past
    20 years. Its main objective is to improve the performance and sustainability
    of irrigated agriculture. According to Dedrick et al. (2000), the MIP process
    incorporates: (1) a thorough understanding of the performance of irrigated agriculture
    in an area; (2) involvement by key decision makers in a joint decision process;
    (3) implementation of the planned changes by responsible operational managers.
    The MIP consists of three phases: diagnostic analysis, management planning and
    performance improvement. In the Maricopa-Stanfield Irrigation and Drainage District
    (MSIDD), located in central Arizona, an inter-organisational demonstration MIP
    was implemented in 1990 to assess its usefulness in the evaluation of the performance
    management. In the Ebro valley (Spain), irrigation districts have a varied technological
    level. Surface irrigation, using borders and level basins, is the most common
    irrigation method. In general, these irrigation systems are characterised by a
    low efficiency. Typical problems include: distribution systems with capacity below
    the peak demand; inflexible delivery rate and duration (usually in 24 h shifts);
    and poor on-farm land levelling (Faci et al., 2000, Playan et al., 2000). These
    authors analysed a surface irrigated district representative of the Ebro valley:
    the Almudévar Irrigation District (AID). The study characterised the district’s
    water management problems and evaluated modernisation scenarios. The authors concluded
    that the irrigation systems needed improvement and that the water distribution
    system was not able to provide a flexible and dependable water supply to the farmers.
    Consequently, they proposed a modernisation strategy based on the improvement
    of the conveyance structures and on conversion from surface to sprinkler irrigation.
    Currently, the Government of Spain is working on a program to modernise many irrigation
    districts. At the same time, public and private investments are being used to
    develop new irrigated areas using pressurised irrigation systems. These systems
    can attain irrigation efficiencies greater than 80% if adequately designed and
    managed (Keller and Bliesner, 1990, Clemmens and Dedrick, 1994). Little information
    is available in Spain about the current levels of irrigation efficiency under
    sprinkler irrigation systems. Therefore, assessing irrigation performance in these
    modern districts is an important issue to improve water management and preserve
    the quality of the environment. In this series of two papers, an analysis of WU
    and irrigation performance in the Loma de Quinto District (LQD) is presented.
    This analysis represents a contribution to the diagnostic analysis phase (Clyma
    and Lowdermilk, 1988, Dedrick et al., 2000) of an incipient MIP for the LQD. The
    next step will be to discuss this report in a multidisciplinary committee which
    will perform the diagnostic analysis not just on water issues, but on the current
    state of irrigated agriculture. The objectives of this first paper of the series
    include: (1) characterising the irrigation systems, soil types and crops present
    in the LQD; (2) evaluating irrigation performance through the relationship between
    on-farm WU and net irrigation requirements (NIR); (3) identifying factors affecting
    on-farm WU. In order to accomplish these objectives, statistical analyses of field
    data, district records on WU and farmers’ interviews were performed. 2. The study
    area The LQD was selected as the study area because farmers and district managers
    are interested in improving the profitability and sustainability of irrigated
    agriculture. From a technical point of view, the district is interesting because
    of the high cost of irrigation water (in comparison with crop revenues), the existence
    of WU records, the use of a wide variety of sprinkler irrigation systems, the
    limitations on irrigation operation imposed by the wind, and the variability in
    crops and soil types. The LQD is located about 40 km southeast of Zaragoza, Spain
    (Fig. 1). The district is an extension of an old irrigation district, the Traditional
    Quinto District (TQD), which diverts water from the Ebro River. The TQD, consisting
    of about a 1000 ha of surface irrigated land, was the basis of the Quinto economy
    for centuries. Since 1987 farmers in Quinto cultivate the old irrigated area plus
    the sprinkler-irrigated LQD. The LQD is located in a plateau about a 100 m above
    the TQD. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Location of the LQD. The
    LQD covers 2606 ha, divided into 490 cadastral plots, and services 284 farmers
    (Lasierra, 1993). Each farmer cultivates a number of cadastral plots, which are
    usually spread throughout the district. Plot size varies between 0.2 and 71.8
    ha. A variety of sprinkler irrigation systems (solid-set, centre-pivot and linear-move),
    are used to irrigate field crops (alfalfa, corn, sunflower and wheat). Fruit trees
    are produced in a few plots equipped with micro irrigation systems. District soils
    are shallow, have low organic matter, and are high in calcium carbonate and gypsum.
    The Quinto climate is semiarid, with an average annual rainfall of 266 mm and
    an average reference evapotranspiration (ET0) of 1243 mm. A relevant feature of
    the Quinto climate is the presence of an intense wind from the NW–W, locally called
    “cierzo”. This wind produces large wind drift and evaporation losses and severely
    reduces irrigation uniformity in solid-sets (Faci and Bercero, 1991). Irrigation
    water is pumped from the Ebro River to a reservoir located at an elevation of
    132 m. Due to the energy requirement, the cost of water (0.034  m−3 in 1997) is
    very high in comparison with other districts of the Ebro basin growing field crops
    with surface irrigation (about 0.006  m−3). Water is supplied through a 60 km
    network of pressurised pipes. No additional pumping is required to convey water
    from the reservoir to the plots, although some farmers use booster pumps to increase
    the available pressure. All the hydrants are equipped with volumetric water meters.
    The distribution system is limited rate demand, as defined by Clemmens (1987).
    The board of the LQD manages the district. The board is composed of district farmers,
    who are elected by fellow farmers, occupying the positions of president, financing
    administrator and consultants. The LQD hires personnel such as the secretary and
    a number of technicians to operate and maintain the pumping station, the irrigation
    network, and the reservoir. 3. Materials and methods 3.1. Temporal and spatial
    units of the study The current level of irrigation management was analysed using
    records of irrigation practices for three different irrigation seasons, chosen
    according to their ET0 (dry, average and humid) and to the availability of crop
    maps. The selected years were 1989, 1995 and 1997. The spatial unit of the study
    was the cadastral plot. This choice was dictated by the structure of the LQD management
    database and by the use of a geographic information system (GIS) containing cadastral
    information for mapping purposes. 3.2. Irrigation systems and cropping patterns
    A 1997 field survey was used to prepare maps of district irrigation systems and
    crop spatial distribution (Dechmi et al., 1998). Farmers have not changed their
    irrigation systems since district operations began, so the same irrigation systems
    map was used for all 3 years of the study. Crop maps for the 1989 and 1995 irrigation
    seasons were obtained from Casterad (1990). In 1998, a field survey was conducted
    to collect LQD irrigation systems characteristics in each plot (Tejero, 1999).
    This information includes sprinkler spacing, sprinkler line azimuth, pivot or
    ranger length, nozzle(s) diameter(s), operating pressure and nozzle height. 3.3.
    District water records Since farmers irrigate on demand, the district personnel
    does not take an active role in organising WU. The district technicians write
    down all the water meter readings monthly, and the district secretary uses a computer
    database to store the readings, determine the volumes of water used and prepare
    a monthly water bill for each farmer. Some hydrants supply water to a single farmer,
    while others are shared by a number of farmers. In the latter case, the secretary
    splits the cost of water according to the name, date and water volume recorded
    by the farmers themselves. A custom-made software is used to perform the database
    operations. This tool stores additional information, such as the size of the plots,
    the name and code of the owner, and the name of the irrigator. A general and a
    detailed study of WU in the district were conducted. In both cases we used information
    on water billing, and assumed that these volumes corresponded to actual WU. The
    technology applied in the LQD for water conveyance and measurement (pipes and
    water meters) makes this assumption much more reasonable than for districts using
    open ditches for water delivery, such as the AID (Faci et al., 2000). The general
    analysis examined the seasonal volume of water billed during the three years of
    study for entire district area. The detailed analysis focused on 17 plots (accounting
    for 44 ha), irrigated with solid-sets from 10 shared hydrants during the 1997
    the irrigation season. These plots were selected because the individual irrigation
    dates and volumes were available at the district database. Alfalfa (10 plots),
    corn (four plots) and wheat (three plots) were grown on these plots. 3.4. Soils
    Soil properties analysed in this study were soil depth (p, m) and total available
    water (TAW, mm). TAW was defined according to Walker and Skogerboe (1987), and
    computed after the following expression: (1) where θFC is the gravimetric water
    content ratio at 0.03 MPa (field capacity), θWP the gravimetric water content
    ratio at 1.50 MPa (wilting point), ρb the soil bulk density (Mg m−3), ρw the water
    density (Mg m−3), and S the volumetric ratio of stoniness. For the general study,
    the 19 soil units defined by Artieda (1998) in the Quinto soil map were grouped
    into five classes according to their p and TAW (Table 1). For the 17 plots analysed
    in detail, p and S were determined in situ. Pressure plates were used to determine
    θFC and θWP, with two replicates per sample. In total, 39 samples were collected,
    using two or three samples per plot (characterising different soil horizons).
    ρb was set to 1.5 Mg m−3, based on studies in the area (Artieda, 1998). Table

    practices were analysed through an interview prepared and conducted in 1998. Twenty-one
    farmers were randomly selected for the interviews. The questionnaire consisted
    of 67 multiple choice questions about the farmer’s irrigation systems and management
    practices. Other questions were devoted to establish if the farmers cultivated
    plots on lease and to compare irrigated agriculture in the LDQ and TQD (Tejero,
    1999). 3.6. Net irrigation requirements Irrigation requirements were estimated
    using the standard FAO procedures, as described by Doorenbos and Pruitt (1977)
    and Allen et al. (1998), and implemented in the CROPWAT software (Smith, 1993,
    Clarke et al., 1998). Following these procedures, Penman–Monteith reference evapotranspiration
    (ET0), crop coefficients (Kc), crop evapotranspiration (ETc), effective precipitation
    (PE) and NIR (mm) were estimated. These estimations relied on mean monthly meteorological
    data recorded at the Quinto climatic station, located at a north latitude of 41°25′25″,
    a west longitude of 0°30′30″ and an altitude of 190 m. The data used included:
    maximum and minimum air temperature, maximum and minimum relative air humidity,
    precipitation, sunshine duration and wind speed. Missing minimum air humidity
    and sunshine duration data were replaced with data from the Zaragoza climatic
    station. Duration of the crop development phases and primary crop coefficients
    (Kc) were obtained from Martinez-Cob et al. (1998). Monthly effective precipitation
    (PE) for 1989 and 1995 was determined using the USDA method (Cuenca, 1989). In
    view of the abnormally large rainfall recorded in 1997, PE for this season was
    calculated using the empirical method of PE (Smith, 1993). NIR were determined
    for the dominant crops (alfalfa, corn, sunflower and wheat). 3.7. WU, irrigation
    efficiency and seasonal irrigation performance index (SIPI) The performance measure
    used to characterise WU in the LQD was the SIPI, as defined by Faci et al. (2000)
    and applied to the AID. The SIPI is defined as the percentage of NIR to seasonal
    WU (mm), estimated from billing records. SIPI represents a simplification of the
    irrigation efficiency standard concept defined by Burt et al. (1997) and Clemmens
    and Burt (1997). However, if a crop is water stressed, the value of the SIPI can
    be higher than 100%. In fact, if the SIPI is higher than the potential application
    efficiency of the irrigation system, the crop will be water stressed. Clemmens
    and Dedrick (1994) presented values of potential application efficiency for well
    designed and managed irrigation systems. Solid-sets range from 70 to 85%, while
    pivots and rangers range from 75 to 90%. We estimated an average value of potential
    application efficiency of 80% for all irrigation systems in the district. This
    value was considered as a threshold separating full irrigation (SIPI<80%) from
    deficit irrigation (SIPI>80%). The SIPI was computed for each representative crop
    and year of the study. 3.8. Identifying factors affecting WU Contingency tables
    were used to test possible interactions between the crops and three other categorical
    variables: type of irrigation system, type of farmer (owner or leaser) and soil
    TAW class. The goal of this analysis was to determine if these factors affected
    the choice of crop for each plot and study year. Two types of correlation analyses
    were conducted for the detailed study. Their purpose was to gain insight on farmers’
    irrigation decision making, with particular reference to the main climatic limiting
    factor: wind speed. The first type of analysis involved data from individual irrigation
    events. The selected variables were: irrigation depth (mm), irrigation interval
    (days), wind speed (m s−1) and date of each irrigation event (DOY, day of the
    year). The second type of analysis involved seasonal variables: the seasonal depth
    of water applied to each plot (mm), the average wind speed during the irrigation
    days (m s−1), the average irrigation depth (mm), the average irrigation interval
    (days) and the SIPI (%). Multiple regression with dummy variables was applied
    to study the interaction between quantitative and categorical variables in the
    general study, following the procedures used by Clemmens and Dedrick (1992) to
    analyse WU in the MSIDD. The dependant variables considered in this work were
    the seasonal WU and the SIPI. The plot area and the total area managed by the
    farmer in the LDQ were introduced as independent quantitative variables. These
    variables were included to assess the relationship between WU and land tenure,
    under the hypothesis that large plots or more professional farmers would promote
    water conservation. The independent categorical variables were the type of crop,
    the irrigation system, the soil class and the type of farmer (owner vs. leaser).
    The statistical model was developed by first including all the factors and then
    removing insignificant factors individually and iteratively. 4. Results and discussion
    4.1. Characterisation of irrigation systems, soils and crops The spatial distribution
    of irrigation systems is depicted in Fig. 2. Solid-sets are used mainly in the
    north and northeast areas, while centre-pivots and linear-moves are common in
    the southwest, where plots are larger. This distribution can also be related to
    soil surface elevation, which is higher in the south. Higher pressures are available
    to operate the solid-set systems in the northern part of the LQD. The average
    area of solid-set plots is 4.0 ha. The most common sprinkler spacing is triangular,
    with sprinklers at every 21 m in the line and the lines separated 18 m. This spacing
    is used in 79% of the total solid-set area. Most of the plots (54%) are equipped
    with 5.1 and 2.4 mm diameter nozzles. The average operating pressure in the solid-set
    systems was 270 kPa. For similar hardware and operating conditions, Tarjuelo (1995)
    recommended an operating pressure in the range of 300–400 kPa, sensibly higher
    than the average observed value. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Map
    of irrigation systems in the LQD. Solid-set uniformity can be severely reduced
    in the presence of strong winds. A common wind defence is to set the sprinkler
    lines perpendicular to the dominant winds (Keller and Bliesner, 1990). In the
    case of triangular sprinkler spacings, this recommendation becomes more complicated,
    due to the fact that three possible sprinkler lines (forming angles of 60°) could
    be drawn around any given sprinkler (Fig. 3). In this particular case, the best
    protection against wind is an orientation with one of the lines (the horizontal
    line in Fig. 3) perpendicular to the wind direction. Therefore, the minimum angle
    between the dominant wind and a sprinkler line is 30°. In this case, the distance
    between sprinklers in a direction perpendicular to the wind is minimum, with a
    value of 10.5 m. As a result, the applied irrigation water attains a reasonable
    coverage of the soil. In the worst case one of the sprinkler lines is parallel
    to the wind direction. In this case the sprinkler spacing in the wind direction
    attains a maximum value of 18 m. This results in strips of non-irrigated land
    during windy irrigations. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Representation
    of best and worst orientation cases between the wind and the sprinkler line for
    a triangular 21 m×18 m spacing. Dots represent sprinklers and ellipsoids represent
    the area wetted by each individual sprinkler. In order to assess the wind protection
    characteristics of the LQD solid-sets, plots were classified according to the
    sprinkler line azimuth. Considering the axes of symmetry in Fig. 3, azimuths were
    reduced to an interval of 5–65°, divided into six 10° intervals. Accordingly,
    the average wind azimuth of 293° was reduced to an orientation of 53° (subtracting
    240°). Fig. 4 confronts a histogram of the sprinkler line orientation groups with
    the dominant wind direction. The best sprinkler line orientation would be between
    15° and 25° (approximately 30° angle with the dominant wind direction). Plots
    with optimally oriented lines represent 19.5% of the total solid-set area (Fig.
    4). In the LQD, 58.9% of the sprinkler lines present adequate orientations (considered
    between 5° and 35°), suggesting that the design principle was only slightly considered.
    Additional wind protection could have been obtained at the design phase through
    a more careful sprinkler line orientation. Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 4. Histogram of sprinkler line orientation in LQD, with indication of the
    dominant wind direction. The average area of the plots irrigated with centre-pivots
    is 13.6 ha. Centre-pivot systems are usually equipped with low pressure fixed
    spray plate sprinklers of different diameters located on top of the lateral, at
    4.5 m over the soil surface. Recent developments in irrigation technology, such
    as rotating spray plate sprinklers (Faci et al., 2001) have not been introduced
    in the area. In 12% of centre-pivots, farmers have lowered the nozzles in order
    to conserve irrigation water. In some cases, nozzles have only been lowered at
    the outer part of the centre-pivot. The average area of the plots irrigated with
    linear-move systems is 7.2 ha. These machines are also equipped with low pressure
    fixed plate spray sprinklers. In half of the linear-move machines the spray sprinklers
    are located at an elevation of 4.7 m over the soil surface. In the rest, the spray
    sprinklers have been lowered to an average height of 2.6 m. A common trait of
    the LQD systems is the lack of irrigation automation. The interview revealed that
    86% of the farmers did not use any automation equipment, while the remaining 14%
    used automation in some farms. The lack of automation devices poses a severe limitation
    to irrigation scheduling and to adapting the irrigation depth to the soil TAW.
    Soils in the LQD show a large variation in water holding capability (Table 1).
    Most soils (70% of the area) have values of TAW ranging from 60 to 140 mm. Because
    of its low TAW, the S1 class shows relevant limitations for irrigation, and requires
    frequent, light irrigations. Soil classes S4 and S5 have a high TAW (160–300 mm)
    but are fine textured, saline and exhibit low infiltration and poor aeration.
    Therefore, they have low agronomic value. Main crops in the LQD were wheat and
    corn in 1989, and alfalfa in 1995 and 1997 (Table 2). The category “mixed crops”
    was relevant in the 3 years of study. It includes the plots in which farmers divide
    the total area to grow more than one crop at a time. This is a common practice
    in large plots. Table 2. Crop distribution in the LQD during the study years Crop

    4.2. Evaluation of irrigation performance Seasonal water diversions in the LQD
    varied strongly during the study years. According to the pumping station records,
    the highest diversion occurred in 1995 (21.7×106 m3), while in 1989 and 1997 diversions
    were much lower (10.9×106 and 13.2×106 m3, respectively). The average WU was 477,
    995 and 585 mm, for the 1989, 1995 and 1997 years, respectively. Table 3 presents
    the distribution of the district plots in classes of WU for the 3 years of study.
    The variability in water application may reflect differences in crops, soils,
    irrigation systems and irrigation management. The effect of the crop on WU is
    illustrated in Table 4. The associated coefficients of variation ranged from 27
    to 63%, indicating that additional factors determine WU. Table 3. Percent distribution

    Computed SIPI values for the studied crops suggest that farmers in the area regularly
    stress their crops (Table 4). Only in one case (wheat in 1995) the average SIPI
    was lower than the estimated potential application efficiency (80%). Sunflower
    was severely water stressed during all the study years, with an inter-annual average
    SIPI of 142%. Alfalfa and wheat had average values of SIPI of 128 and 113%. The
    inter-annual average of the SIPI value for corn was 111%, the lowest among all
    crops. These data suggest that farmers try to optimise irrigation WU restricting
    application on drought resistant crops (sunflower, wheat, alfalfa), and limiting
    water stress on drought sensitive crops (corn). The subsidies of the European
    Union play a relevant role in the SIPI. Subsidies are applied by the hectare,
    and amount to a variable percentage of each crop gross income. In the case of
    sunflower subsidies were comparatively high in the years of study, and therefore
    farmers did not consider yield as the main source of income. Consequently, sunflower
    was systematically underirrigated. Faci et al. (2000) reported a similar finding
    for the AID, based on data from 1994. The district average SIPI (computed in all
    plots) was 155, 95 and 131 for the years 1989, 1995 and 1997, respectively. These
    values indicate that the SIPI followed inter-annual trends that could not be explained
    by the aridity of the analysed years. Crop water stress was considerable during
    the years 1989 and 1997. In 1995, which was considered as an average year with
    an average evaporative demand, the seasonal amount of irrigation water applied
    to alfalfa, corn and wheat was higher than their NIR. A correlation analysis between
    the SIPI values obtained in the same plots in the three study years was performed.
    The purpose of this analysis was to assess how on-farm irrigation performance
    changed in the study years. Results showed a weak correlation between the SIPI
    values of years 1989 and 1995 (0.168*), with no significant correlation between
    years 1989 and 1997. However, there was a strongly significant correlation between
    the SIPI values of years 1995 and 1997 (0.484***). This finding suggests that
    on-farm irrigation performance has evolved during the life of the LQD. The criteria
    for water allocation in each plot were particularly consistent between 1995 and
    1997, after almost 10 years of irrigation operation. Results from the detailed
    analysis showed that the average irrigation depth per irrigation event ranged
    from 18 to 73 mm, with an average of 44 mm and a CV of 30%. This irrigation depth
    is compatible with the interview results: 60% of the farmers use solid-set irrigation
    durations of 8 h or more. The average irrigation interval varied from 8.6 to 28.0
    days, with an average of 12.3 days and a CV of 40%. These irrigation depths and
    intervals are too high for sprinkler irrigation in general and for the LQD soils
    in particular. The irrigation systems used in the district permit to apply frequent,
    light irrigations, at the only additional expense of labour or automation equipment.
    The previous results state that farmers underirrigate their crops in the LQD.
    The interview included a few questions on this topic, formulated as a comparison
    between WU in the LQD and the TQD. The 43% of the farmers used “more water” in
    the TQD than in the LQD, while the remaining 57% used “much more water”. The 89%
    of the farmers reported that crop yield was higher in the TQD than in the LQD.
    All of the interviewed farmers obtained higher profits in the TQD. Low seasonal
    irrigation depths, large irrigation intervals and poor soils seem sufficient to
    explain the low yields. The added factor of high water cost explains the reduced
    economic benefit in the LQD as compared to the TQD. 4.3. Identifying factors affecting
    WU The first step was the analysis of contingency tables between categorical variables
    of the general analysis. Only in the first year of study (1989), a statistical
    relationship was found between crops and irrigation systems. Farmers did not grow
    alfalfa and sunflower in the plots equipped with irrigation machines (linear-move
    and pivot), using them for corn and wheat. This trend was discontinued in the
    following years. Both types of farmers (owners and leasers) grow the same crops
    in the LQD, and distribute them throughout the district area regardless of the
    soil types. The second phase of the statistical study involved the analysis of
    correlation matrices established between the quantitative variables of the detailed
    study. First, the correlation analysis was performed on individual irrigation
    events (Table 5). One of the most relevant characteristics of this table is that
    the correlation coefficients are low (below 0.3 in absolute value). This will
    be a constant in the rest of this study. The explanation for this fact lies in
    the nature of the data, which were obtained from the farmers’ database. In our
    opinion, farmers have not been particularly careful in checking the accuracy of
    some variables. We believe that the water measurements are reliable, since water
    billing depends on these measurements and farmers use about one-fourth of their
    gross income to pay the water bill. Problems seem to accumulate in the estimation
    of the irrigated area. In some cases, not all the plot area was actually irrigated.
    In other cases, the water assigned to a plot seems to have been used to irrigate
    neighbouring plots owned by the same farmer. Our perception is that even if the
    farmers’ database adequately allocates costs among farmers, it shows limitations
    when it comes to ensuring water traceability with respect to plots and crops.

    weak, negative correlation coefficient (r=−0.1411*) was found between irrigation
    depth and wind speed (Table 5). In windy days farmers applied light irrigations,
    and seemed to wait for calm days to apply the gross of water requirements. The
    interview confirmed that this practice was followed by 70% of the farmers. As
    an additional confirmation, the average wind speed in irrigation days (for all
    plots in the detailed study) was 0.92 m s−1, whereas the average seasonal wind
    speed was 1.25 m s−1. According to the farmers’ interview, 95, 85, and 50% of
    the farmers avoided irrigating in windy days with their solid-sets, pivots and
    rangers, respectively. The irrigation depth (per irrigation event) was not related
    to the irrigation date (Table 5), suggesting that farmers used fixed irrigation
    depths throughout the season, and met the irrigation requirements adjusting the
    irrigation interval. In fact, the irrigation interval showed a decrease in time
    during the irrigation season, reflecting the increased water demand during spring
    and mid summer. According to the interview, this procedure was followed by 76%
    of the farmers. A significant, negative correlation between wind speed and irrigation
    date was found. Since the wind speed did not show a significant time dependence
    during the irrigation season (data not presented), it can be concluded that farmers
    became increasingly selective with the wind speed on irrigation days as the season
    progressed. A second set of correlation analyses was performed using seasonal
    data from each plot of the detailed study. The correlation between seasonal WU
    and average irrigation interval (r=−0.5563*) serves to confirm part of the previous
    results: those farmers applying large seasonal irrigation depths used small irrigation
    intervals. The lack of correlation between seasonal WU and average irrigation
    depth confirms that the management variable was the number of irrigation events
    (and therefore the irrigation interval). The last step of the statistical analysis
    consisted on formulating multiple regression models using dummy variables to incorporate
    categorical variables. Such models were first applied to explain the variability
    on WU (Table 6). The plot area resulted significant in 1989 and 1997, with coefficients
    of −4.2 and −5.4 mm ha−1, suggesting that large plots have a potential to conserve
    water. The total area managed by the farmer and the type of farmer (owner vs.
    leaser) did not result significant in any of the three study years. Since management
    does not seem to be the key of a lower WU, the benefits of large plots seem to
    be due to a better irrigation technology. Clemmens and Dedrick (1992), when analysing
    the MSIDD, found that the area managed by the farmer was statistically relevant
    on WU, and determined a coefficient of about 1 mm ha−1, between four and five
    times smaller than the one reported in this research for plot size. In the MSIDD
    the type of farmer was also significantly related to WU. Faci et al. (2000), analysing
    the AID, identified a large dependence of WU on plot size, although they reported
    a number of administrative procedures increasing the volume of water billed to
    small farms. Table 6. Results of the multiple regression with dummy variables
    used to characterise the factors affecting WU (mm) in the study years Variable

    −14.1 ns Hand move – a −612.7* a In 1995 the plots equipped with hand move systems
    were excluded from the statistical analysis since their number was very low. The
    other factors affecting WU were the type of crop and the type of irrigation system.
    As expected, corn, sunflower and wheat used less water than alfalfa, although
    in some cases the contrast between alfalfa and corn and even sunflower was not
    significant. In 1995 and 1997 wheat and particularly sunflower showed a reduced
    WU. As for the irrigation systems, differences were not significant in 1989. In
    1995 and 1997 the variable was significant, solid-sets were the systems using
    most water, and only one contrast was significant in each year (linear-move in
    1995 and hand move in 1997). In a context of increasing labour scarcity, hand
    move systems showed small WU, and were associated to marginal plots. When multiple
    regression was used to explain the variability on the SIPI, the number of significant
    factors increased towards the end of the study period (Table 7). In 1989, the
    SIPI could not be explained by any of the considered factors. In the 1995 irrigation
    season, crop type was the only significant variable, and sunflower was the only
    crop showing significant differences with alfalfa. Factors affecting the SIPI
    during the 1997 irrigation season were the type of crop, the irrigation system
    and the soil type. The statistical analysis showed that the corn SIPI values were
    49% smaller than the alfalfa SIPI values. The effect of the type of irrigation
    system only served to separate the hand move system from the rest of the systems.
    The relationship found between the soil type and the SIPI values indicated significant
    differences between low and average TAW values. Table 7. Results of the multiple
    regression with dummy variables used to characterise the factors affecting the

    performed for WU and SIPI were low (ranging between 7.7 and 41.7%). The quality
    of the data sources and the variability induced by irrigation farming operations
    are probable causes of this dispersion. 5. Conclusions The analysis of irrigation
    WU during three irrigation seasons (dry, average and humid) was used to characterise
    the performance of relatively modern irrigation systems in the LQD. The following
    conclusions can be drawn from this analysis: 1. Most of the solid-set sprinkler
    systems in the LQD use wide sprinkler spacings (  m). The current operating pressure
    is too low to ensure adequate water distribution. Additional wind protection could
    have been obtained through a narrower spacing and/or a more careful sprinkler
    line orientation. 2. Centre-pivot and linear-move irrigation machines use fixed
    spray plate sprinklers. Recent developments in sprinklers for irrigation machines
    have not been introduced in the LQD. In about one-third of the machines, sprinklers
    have been lowered (from about 4.7 to 2.6 m) to improve water conservation. 3.
    Field crops are grown in the LQD (alfalfa, corn, sunflower and wheat). The average
    WU was 477 mm in 1989, 995 mm in 1995 and 585 mm in 1997. This variability in
    water application could not be adequately explained by the aridity of the study
    years or the changes in the cropping pattern. 4. The average inter-annual SIPI
    was 127%. Farmers regularly stressed their crops, particularly those characterised
    by their drought resistance and those receiving large subsidies applied by the
    hectare. 5. The average irrigation depth per irrigation event was 44 mm, and the
    seasonal average irrigation interval was 12.3 days. These values are too high,
    particularly for the soils characterised by a low TAW. 6. Farmers seem to respond
    to strong winds by applying light irrigations, and reserve large irrigation events
    for calm days. In general, farmers modify the irrigation interval rather than
    the depth in order to accommodate the irrigation schedule to the NIR. 7. Large
    plots used less water than small plots, at a rate of about −5 mm ha−1. Similar
    findings (but different rates) were reported in previous works on surface-irrigated
    districts (Clemmens and Dedrick, 1992, Faci et al., 2000). 8. Multiple regression
    models on SIPI became more complex along the three study years. In 1997 the significant
    dependent variables included the crop, type of irrigation system and soil type.
    The high cost of irrigation water in relation to crop revenues, the technical
    deficiencies of the irrigation systems, and the limitations imposed by the climate
    and soils appear to be major causes of the water management problems identified
    in the LQD. The validity of our results may be limited by the origin of the WU
    data (the district’s database). While these data are used for water billing in
    an area in which the cost of irrigation water represents a large percentage of
    the crop gross income, the database may include water allocation errors. In a
    companion paper, irrigation evaluations and simulations performed on different
    irrigation systems at the LQD will be presented. Irrigation schedules for optimal
    crop yield will also be proposed and evaluated via simulation. Acknowledgements

    \ parameter in recent and numerous environmental studies, soil moisture\n(SM)\
    \ inﬂuences the exchange of water and energy at the interface between the land\
    \ surface and\natmosphere. Accurate estimate of the spatio-temporal variations\
    \ of SM is critical for numerous\nlarge-scale terrestrial studies. Although microwave\
    \ remote sensing provides many algorithms to\nobtain SM at large scale, such as\
    \ SMOS and SMAP etc., resulting in many data products, they are\nalmost low resolution\
    \ and not applicable in small catchment or ﬁeld scale. Estimations of SM from\n\
    optical and thermal remote sensing have been studied for many years and signiﬁcant\
    \ progress\nhas been made. In contrast to previous reviews, this paper presents\
    \ a new, comprehensive and\nsystematic review of using optical and thermal remote\
    \ sensing for estimating SM. The physical basis\nand status of the estimation\
    \ methods are analyzed and summarized in detail. The most important\nand latest\
    \ advances in soil moisture estimation using temporal information have been shown\
    \ in this\npaper. SM estimation from optical and thermal remote sensing mainly\
    \ depends on the relationship\nbetween SM and the surface reﬂectance or vegetation\
    \ index. The thermal infrared remote sensing\nmethods uses the relationship between\
    \ SM and the surface temperature or variations of surface\ntemperature/vegetation\
    \ index. These approaches often have complex derivation processes and many\napproximations.\
    \ Therefore, combinations of optical and thermal infrared remotely sensed data\
    \ can\nprovide more valuable information for SM estimation. Moreover, the advantages\
    \ and weaknesses\nof different approaches are compared and applicable conditions\
    \ as well as key issues in current soil\nmoisture estimation algorithms are discussed.\
    \ Finally, key problems and suggested solutions are\nproposed for future research.\n\
    Keywords: soil moisture (SM); optical and thermal remote sensing; vegetation index;\
    \ land surface\ntemperature\n1. Introduction\nSoil moisture (SM) is an important\
    \ variable in land surface system research, including studies\nof the regional\
    \ water cycle, agricultural irrigation management, climate change and environmental\n\
    monitoring [1–7]. SM links the energy and water exchange between the atmosphere\
    \ and land surface\nand indicates groundwater conditions [8,9]. Additionally,\
    \ SM is used to indicate drought in vegetated\nenvironments because water content\
    \ is an essential factor for vegetation growth [10–12]. This means\nthat SM plays\
    \ an important role in the terrestrial water cycle [13–16]. When soil moisture\
    \ evaporates\ninto the atmosphere, energy exchange occurs between the atmosphere\
    \ and land surface. On the\nother hand, surface water and groundwater are linked\
    \ with the vertical migration of the SM that\nis taken up by vegetation for survival.\
    \ Because the SM plays two vital roles, it is an indispensable\nSensors 2016,\
    \ 16, 1308; doi:10.3390/s16081308\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2016,\
    \ 16, 1308\n2 of 29\nvariable in terrestrial research. SM estimation studies originated\
    \ in the 1960s because of the limitations\nof measurement equipment and theoretical\
    \ immaturity; however, this research mainly relies on\nempirical relationships\
    \ and point-based experiments [17–19]. In the 1970s and 1980s (corresponding\n\
    with theoretical advances), SM was treated as an important parameter in conjunction\
    \ with other\nsurface parameters in comprehensive studies [20–26]. Since the 1990s,\
    \ several studies have been\nperformed to determine methods for estimating SM\
    \ [27–32]. In addition, due to the advent of remote\nsensing technologies, researchers\
    \ have gradually shifted their attention to monitoring large areas\nby using remotely\
    \ sensed data. Based on the optical and thermal infrared remote sensing, many\n\
    approaches have been developed by establishing relationships between SM and soil\
    \ reﬂectivity or\nsurface temperature/vegetation coverage and soil thermal properties.\
    \ Based on the microwave remote\nsensing, various methods have been proposed for\
    \ the past 35 years [6,33]. For passive microwave\nremote sensing, the representative\
    \ models are GOM [34], POM [34], SPM [34], IEM [35,36], AIEM [37,38],\nQ/H [39,40]\
    \ and Q/P [41] for bare soil area. The representative soil moisture estimation\
    \ models for\nvegetation area are MIMICS model [42], water-cloud model [43], crop\
    \ model [44] and f-k model [45,46].\nDue to the close relationship between backscatter\
    \ coefﬁcients and SM, researchers developed different\nSM modeling efforts from\
    \ active microwave sensors, such as Empirical models [47,48], Semi-empirical\n\
    models [49–51] and Physically-based models [52–54]. At the regional scale, SM\
    \ has been obtained by\nusing remote sensing techniques, which represent a new\
    \ era in soil moisture estimations.\nTraditional\nSM\nobservations\nmainly\ninclude\n\
    single-point\nbased\nor\nspeciﬁc\nlocation\nmeasurements [55–59].\nThe direct\
    \ and most accurate method is the gravimetric method [60].\nThe original soil\
    \ moisture content can be determined from changes in mass. However, this method\
    \ is\ndestructive and cannot be reproduced. Moreover, this method requires a large\
    \ amount of manpower for\nsampling and lab measurements [61]. Time domain reﬂectometry\
    \ (TDR), neutron probes and gamma\nray scanners are subsequently used to indirectly\
    \ measure the SM. These methods are point-based and\ncannot be used as a proxy\
    \ for the regional SM.\nThe development of satellite technology provides a powerful\
    \ method for monitoring the\nspatial-temporal variations of regional SM and provides\
    \ quantitative estimations. Many experts\nhave established different methods for\
    \ retrieving SM based on the relationships between the SM and\nsatellite-derived\
    \ land surface parameters. Using the visible infrared band, the SM can be derived\
    \ from\nthe relationships between soil reﬂectance and different SMs or vegetation\
    \ traits that occur under water\nstress. These methods can be divided into two\
    \ categories, (1) the single spectral analysis method; and\n(2) the vegetation\
    \ index method. For thermal infrared wavebands, the parameters related to the\
    \ soil\nthermal properties are mainly used to derive the SM. This method includes\
    \ two categories, (1) the\nthermal inertia method; and (2) the temperature index\
    \ method. Combining visible and thermal infrared\nremotely sensed data can provide\
    \ more information for estimating soil moisture than the single one.\nSpatial\
    \ and temporal information-based methods have their own advantages and disadvantages.\n\
    It is therefore important to determine how to combine these methods reasonably\
    \ to obtain highly\naccurate SM.\nIn this article, SM estimation methods relying\
    \ on optical and thermal remote sensing are collated\nand summarized. Starting\
    \ from the main methods currently used, the SM estimation status and major\nissues\
    \ are introduced. Next, the physical principles, advantages and existing problems\
    \ regarding the\ndifferent methods are presented in detail. Finally, several recommendations\
    \ are made based on current\nissues faced when estimating SM. The overall framework\
    \ of different remote sensing methods used in\nsoil moisture estimation is summarized\

    \ Estimation from Optical and Thermal Remote Sensing\nAlthough the signal penetration\
    \ capabilities of optical and thermal methods are worse than those of\nthermal\
    \ infrared and microwave methods, the reflectance domain is the most operational\
    \ because the\nimages are easily available over a broad range of ground resolutions\
    \ [77–82]. Wavelengths of 0.4–2.5 µm\nrepresent the radiation of the sun reﬂected\
    \ from the Earth’s surface [83,84]. These approaches mainly\nuse reﬂectance to\
    \ estimate the SM in visible infrared remote sensing techniques. In this paper,\
    \ according\nto the different characteristics used of many bands in visible infrared\
    \ remote sensing, they are divided\ninto the single spectral analysis method and\
    \ vegetation index method.\n2.1. Single Spectral Analysis Method\nThe inﬂuences\
    \ of soil moisture on spectral reﬂectance were observed in early studies [85,86].\n\
    The reﬂectance of water absorption bands is different from that of non-absorption\
    \ bands.\nThe absorption amplitude and presented reﬂectance differences are used\
    \ to establish relationships\nwith soil moisture. From the experimental results\
    \ on many soils with different SMs as early as 1925,\nreﬂectance has been observed\
    \ to decrease as the SM increases [85]. Since then, many scientists have\nreproduced\
    \ this phenomenon and have established empirical relationships between soil reﬂectance\
    \ and\nSM [87,88]. In 1972, Bowers and Smith demonstrated that the absorption\
    \ amplitude was linearly related\nto the SM at the water absorption bands [86].\
    \ Based on experimental results, Jackson et al. [89] found\nthat the albedos of\
    \ all dry soils were approximately two times greater than those of wet soils,\
    \ except for\nsand. By analyzing the water absorption values measured in the near-infrared\
    \ band, Dalal et al. [90]\naccurately estimated the SMs of a large number of soil\
    \ samples. However, the above-mentioned\nmethods are all limited to speciﬁc regions.\
    \ Because of the different physical compositions, soil textures\nand surface roughness\
    \ in different study areas, empirical equations cannot be applied universally.\n\
    Corresponding with the development of monitoring instruments and theoretical advances\n\
    for estimating soil moisture, Jaquemoud et al. [91] developed the SOILSPEC transmission\
    \ model,\nwhich considers soil roughness, viewing angle and the inherent spectral\
    \ characteristics of soil to obtain\nthe bidirectional reﬂectance of the soil\
    \ from 450 nm to 2450 nm. Later, Lobell et al. [92] established\nSensors 2016,\
    \ 16, 1308\n4 of 29\na physical model and indicated that an exponential relationship\
    \ exists between soil reﬂectance and\nSM by analyzing the changes in the reﬂectance\
    \ of four different soils at various moisture contents.\nThe model can be expressed\
    \ simply as\nR = f × Rdry + (1 − f ) × Rdry × (−c × s)\n(1)\nwhere Rdry is the\
    \ dry soil reﬂectance, c describes the change rate induced by SM, s is the soil\
    \ saturation,\nand f is the saturation rate.\nLiu et al. [93] applied a simple\
    \ stepwise linear regression method to reduce the band numbers\nand found that\
    \ the soil reﬂectance decreased as the SM increased when the soil moisture was\
    \ low.\nHowever, after the soil moisture reaches the critical point, the reﬂectivity\
    \ increases as the SM increases.\nThis critical point is closely related with\
    \ the soil hydrodynamic characteristics. Based on previous\nstudies, Liu et al.\
    \ [94] evaluated three soil reﬂectance models using 18 soils and the following\
    \ methods:\nthe relative reﬂectivity method, the derivative/difference method\
    \ and the discrete band difference\nmethod. The most applicable method is the\
    \ derivative/difference method because it can be used to\nestimate the SM precisely\
    \ and is less sensitive to external factors, such as the atmosphere and the large\n\
    variation of soil roughness and soil types, etc. Similarly, Whiting et al. [95]\
    \ obtained better results by\nusing the Gaussian model to estimate the SM. Using\
    \ a linear mixed pixel separation algorithm in the\nnear-infrared—red band space,\
    \ Gao et al. [96] used soil line equations and empirical formulas to derive\n\
    the soil reﬂectance of mixed pixels under vegetation cover. Combined with the\
    \ TM images for ﬁeld\nveriﬁcation, this method is applicable at different spatial-temporal\
    \ scales and the results are credible.\nBased on laboratory measurements of soil\
    \ spectral information, single spectral analysis approaches\nare generally used\
    \ to determine the relationships between SM and soil reﬂectance that can obtain\n\
    reasonable results for speciﬁc soil samples. However, in practice, soil reﬂectance\
    \ is affected by many\nfactors, such as vegetation, the atmosphere, etc. The measured\
    \ satellite signals on the surface will\nbe inﬂuenced or reduced, affecting the\
    \ reﬂectance and its operability. In addition, such methods are\nstatistical and\
    \ empirical models that lack physical basis to quantitatively determine the SM.\n\
    2.2. Vegetation Index Method\nBecause it is extremely sensitive to water stress,\
    \ the vegetation index estimated by remote sensing\nhas been widely used to detect\
    \ drought conditions, such as the normalized difference vegetation index\n(NDVI)\
    \ and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) [97]. Drought conditions can be reﬂected\
    \ by vegetation\ngrowth, which can be directly represented by the vegetation index.\
    \ By comparing the vegetation index\nat different times, the impacts of drought\
    \ can easily be determined. However, the accuracy of using\nNDVI-based drought\
    \ indices is often subject to changes in vegetation types and ecosystem differences.\n\
    Additionally, the NDVI-based drought index may be a conservative indicator [32]\
    \ because droughts\ncaused by water stress or rainfall anomalies will both have\
    \ time delays [98]. A detailed overview of\nthe drought indices for regional monitoring\
    \ was provided by Richard and Heim [99].\nMany classical drought indices based\
    \ on vegetation indicators were proposed and have been\nwidely used in drought\
    \ monitoring. To remove the inﬂuences of weather and geographic location\ndifferences\
    \ on NDVI, Kogan [100,101] developed the following Vegetation Condition Index\
    \ (VCI)\nbased on statistical NDVI time-series data:\nVCIij = 100 ∗ (NDVIij −\
    \ NDVI − MINj)\nNDVI − MAXj − NDVI − MINj\n(2)\nwhere VCI is a modiﬁed NDVI, vegetation\
    \ condition index; NDVI is a weekly smoothed composite\nNormalized Difference\
    \ Vegetation Index. NDVI-MIN and NDVI-MAX are the maximum and minimum\nvalues\
    \ of NDVI, respectively, which can be obtained from historical data. i and j denote\
    \ weeks and\nlocations. VCI not only describes the surface vegetation cover and\
    \ spatial-temporal variations but also\nSensors 2016, 16, 1308\n5 of 29\nquantiﬁes\
    \ the impacts of weather on vegetation. Furthermore, VCI can be used to evaluate\
    \ the effects\nof weather on different ecosystems.\nConsidering the error caused\
    \ by the instantaneous vegetation index and using the multi-year\naverage NDVI\
    \ values as criterion, the difference in amplitude was calculated from the NDVI\
    \ values\nobtained over one month or ten days minus the reference value, which\
    \ are positive or negative\nanomalies of the vegetation index. Chen et al. [102]\
    \ developed an anomaly vegetation index (AVI) to\nstudy annual vegetation dynamics.\n\
    The monthly AVI is calculated as follows:\nAMTNDVI = (MTNDVI − MTNDVI)\n(3)\n\
    where AMTNDVI is the anomaly vegetation index, MTNDVI is the average value for\
    \ the same month\nin different years, and MTNDVI is the monthly vegetation index\
    \ for a speciﬁc year.\nBecause its sensitivity to water differs, the relationships\
    \ among different water absorption bands\nwere applied to derive the SM. Gao et\
    \ al. [103] presented a normalized difference water index (NDWI)\nusing the reﬂectance\
    \ at 1.24 µm rather than 0.66 µm because the former is more sensitive to SM.\n\
    More importantly, the NDWI is insensitive to the atmospheric conditions.\nNDWI\
    \ = ρ (0.86 µm) − ρ (1.24 µm)\nρ (0.86 µm) + ρ (1.24 µm)\n(4)\nwhere p is the\
    \ reﬂectance. Based on the NDWI, Wang et al. [104] proposed using the normalized\n\
    multi-band drought index (NMDI), which uses the band differences between the sensitivity\
    \ of 1640 nm\nand 2130 nm for soil and vegetation, respectively, with enhanced\
    \ sensitivity to drought monitoring.\nThe successful application in detecting\
    \ forest ﬁres demonstrated that NMDI can provide a quick\nresponse to moisture\
    \ changes [105,106].\nNMDI = R860 nm − (R1640 nm − R2130 nm)\nR860 nm + (R1640\
    \ nm − R2130 nm)\n(5)\nwhere R is the reﬂectance. Considering the effects on the\
    \ spectral signatures of soil moisture variations,\na new method was developed\
    \ for drought monitoring [107]. Based on the spectral pattern of SM\nchanges in\
    \ the near-infrared–red band space, the Perpendicular Drought Index (PDI) was\
    \ established\nusing ETM reﬂectance (Figure 1).\nSensors 2016, 16, 1308 \n5 of\
    \ 29 \n \nweeks and locations. VCI not only describes the surface vegetation cover\
    \ and spatial-temporal \nvariations but also quantifies the impacts of weather\
    \ on vegetation. Furthermore, VCI can be used to \nevaluate the effects of weather\
    \ on different ecosystems. \nConsidering the error caused by the instantaneous\
    \ vegetation index and using the multi-year \naverage NDVI values as criterion,\
    \ the difference in amplitude was calculated from the NDVI values \nobtained over\
    \ one month or ten days minus the reference value, which are positive or negative\
    \ \nanomalies of the vegetation index. Chen et al. [102] developed an anomaly\
    \ vegetation index (AVI) to \nstudy annual vegetation dynamics.  \nThe monthly\
    \ AVI is calculated as follows: \n(\n)\nAMTNDVI\nMTNDVI\nMTNDVI\n\n\n \n(3)\n\
    where AMTNDVI is the anomaly vegetation index, MTNDVI  is the average value for\
    \ the same \nmonth in different years, and MTNDVI is the monthly vegetation index\
    \ for a specific year. \nBecause its sensitivity to water differs, the relationships\
    \ among different water absorption \nbands were applied to derive the SM. Gao\
    \ et al. [103] presented a normalized difference water index \n(NDWI) using the\
    \ reflectance at 1.24 μm rather than 0.66 μm because the former is more sensitive\
    \ to \nSM. More importantly, the NDWI is insensitive to the atmospheric conditions.\

    \ differences between the sensitivity of 1640 \nnm and 2130 nm for soil and vegetation,\
    \ respectively, with enhanced sensitivity to drought \nmonitoring. The successful\
    \ application in detecting forest fires demonstrated that NMDI can \nprovide a\

    \ signatures of soil moisture \nvariations, a new method was developed for drought\
    \ monitoring [107]. Based on the spectral pattern \nof SM changes in the near-infrared–red\
    \ band space, the Perpendicular Drought Index (PDI) was \nestablished using ETM\
    \ reflectance (Figure 1). \n \nFigure 1. Near Infrared–red space and Perpendicular\
    \ Drought Index [107]. \nFigure 1. Near Infrared–red space and Perpendicular Drought\
    \ Index [107].\nSensors 2016, 16, 1308\n6 of 29\nFor a speciﬁc soil type, the\
    \ soil line can be regarded as a line that characterizes the spectral behavior\n\
    of non-vegetated pixels when the soil moisture content varies noticeably [108].\
    \ The PDI describes the\nSM distribution in the near-infrared—red space. The points\
    \ farther away from the coordinate origin\nindicate low soil moisture areas. In\
    \ contrast, the closer points represent wet conditions and the PDI is\nexpressed\
    \ as follows:\nPDI =\n1\n√\nM2 + 1\n(RRed + MRNIR)\n(6)\nwhere RNIR and RRed denote\
    \ the reﬂectance of near-infrared and red band, respectively; M represents\nthe\
    \ slope of the soil line. The PDI is suitable for bare soil but has many limitations\
    \ in vegetated areas,\nespecially for non-ﬂat regions with different soil types.\n\
    Ghulam et al. [108] introduced fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) for the removal\
    \ of vegetation\ninformation from mixed pixels and proposed the Modiﬁed Perpendicular\
    \ Drought Index—MPDI. If the\nrelationship between the reﬂectance of vegetation\
    \ and bare soil is linear, the MPDI can be expressed\nas follows:\nMPDI = RRed\
    \ + MRNIR − fv(Rv,Red + MRv,NIR)\n(1 − fv)\n√\nM2 + 1\n(7)\nwhere Rv,Red and Rv,NIR\
    \ are the vegetation reﬂectances in the red and near-infrared band, respectively,\n\
    generally set to 0.05 and 0.5 by ﬁeld measurements [108]. fv is the vegetation\
    \ cover. By considering\nthe SM status and vegetation growth, the MPDI can be\
    \ applied to vegetated regions to obtain\ncredible results.\nThe vegetation indicator\
    \ method can reﬂect the SM conditions from the vegetation index changes.\nThe\
    \ advantages and disadvantages of these commonly used drought indices are described\
    \ in Table 2.\nBecause the vegetation index cannot immediately reveal information\
    \ when the vegetation is restricted\nby water stress, a long period is required\
    \ to show the water-limited features after some accumulation;\nthus, this method\
    \ requires a certain time lag to show real-time SM conditions. Second, the inter-annual\n\
    changes of land cover types may affect drought monitoring results. Therefore,\
    \ interpretation of the\nmonitoring results should require the latest reliable\
    \ land cover map. Simultaneously, these methods\nonly consider that water stress\
    \ leads to reductions in the NDVI and do not account for other factors,\nsuch\
    \ as changes in temperature and rainfall. In addition, good quality satellite\
    \ data obtained over\na long period of many years must be obtained, and the obtained\
    \ results only reﬂect the SM deﬁcit\nsituation and not the true soil moisture\

    \ many surface temperature studies, the surface temperature variations at the\
    \ thermal wavebands\nor the soil thermal properties were strongly correlated with\
    \ the SM. Due to the special thermal\nSensors 2016, 16, 1308\n7 of 29\nproperties\
    \ of the soil in the thermal infrared band and its theoretical maturity, SM estimations\
    \ are\ngradually achieved. The thermal inertia and temperature index methods are\
    \ two main methods\nwith their own advantages and disadvantages. The development\
    \ process and their advantages and\nlimitations are introduced in the following.\
    \ Also, some useful references and recommendations\nwere provided.\n3.1. Thermal\
    \ Inertia Method\nAs a property of the substance itself, thermal inertia is often\
    \ used for mineral exploration,\nlithological mapping and geological research.\
    \ Thermal inertia was highly correlated with SM in\nnumerous laboratory experiments\
    \ and is deﬁned as the resistance to temperature variations that is\ninduced by\
    \ exterior energy and controls the amplitude of the temperature change. The higher\
    \ the\nthermal inertia, the less the temperature varies. The relationship between\
    \ thermal inertia and SM can\nbe determined quantitatively from the changes in\
    \ soil temperature or the diurnal amplitude of the\nsurface temperature. Generally,\
    \ thermal inertia includes the soil thermal conductivity and soil heat\ncapacity.\
    \ The soil thermal inertia can be expressed as follows:\nP =\np\nλρC\n(8)\nwhere\
    \ λ is the soil thermal conductivity, ρ is the soil bulk density, and C is the\
    \ soil heat capacity.\nWhen the SM increases, the thermal inertia increases correspondingly\
    \ and reduces the diurnal\namplitude variations of the land surface temperature\
    \ (LST).\n3.1.1. The Physical Analytical Model\nIn geophysical research, soil\
    \ thermal properties and SM show certain relationships [109,110].\nWatson [26]\
    \ ﬁrst proposed physical analytical equations of thermal inertia that were retrieved\
    \ from\nremotely sensed data. The SM was successfully estimated using several\
    \ meteorological elements,\nthe soil moisture proﬁle and remote sensing information.\
    \ In addition, Kahle [23] conducted many\nstudies on thermal inertia models, proposed\
    \ different approaches for solving one-dimensional heat\nconduction equations,\
    \ and attempted to integrate remotely sensed data to estimate thermal inertia\n\
    for large regions. In addition, Price [111] simpliﬁed the latent and sensible\
    \ heat ﬂux expression and\ncombined the surface one-dimensional heat conduction\
    \ equation with the energy balance principle by\nusing Fourier transformation\
    \ to introduce a comprehensive surface parameter B (B is a function of soil\n\
    emissivity, air humidity, temperature and other meteorological factors). Because\
    \ of the requirements\nof a large number of observed ground data in the B solving\
    \ process, this approach is unavailable for\nmany regions.\nMany thermal inertia\
    \ models have treated thermal rock and soil characteristics as a simpliﬁed\nlinear\
    \ function of temperature [23,26]. However, Engman [112] considered that this\
    \ relationship is\nnonlinear and includes factors such as the effects of night\
    \ frost. When combined with microwave data\nto solve the thermal inertia in vegetated\
    \ areas and validate in situ measurements, the obtained results\nwere reasonable\
    \ [113].\nBased on the above-mentioned models, Price [111] proposed using the\
    \ classical apparent thermal\ninertia (ATI) by removing the latent heat of evaporation.\
    \ The ATI can be expressed as follows:\nATI = 1000π\n(1 − α) · C1\nT (1 : 30 p.m.)\
    \ − T (2 : 30 a.m.)\n(9)\nwhere 1000π is used to make the ATI range from 0 to\
    \ 255. C1 is the constant term. T is the land surface\ntemperature, and α is the\
    \ surface albedo.\nThe ATI model is accepted by many scholars, and extensive studies\
    \ have been conducted in different\nareas. Combined with the ATI model and MODIS\
    \ data, Stephen et al. [114] quantitatively estimated\nthe SM and sediment availability\
    \ for a White ShashaQiu field in New Mexico. Verstraeten et al. [115]\nSensors\
    \ 2016, 16, 1308\n8 of 29\nused the ATI model to obtain the SM conditions in Xinjiang\
    \ and the soil moisture content by using\na two-source water balance model at\
    \ a depth of 1 m. The results were veriﬁed by using TDR\nmeasurements, and the\
    \ drought distribution and trends were analyzed in Xinjiang. Frank et al. [116]\n\
    ﬁt the diurnal temperature variation curve of the in-situ measured surface temperature\
    \ in combination\nwith the albedo to obtain the ATI and used AMSR-E soil moisture\
    \ data for validation. The greatest\nadvantage of this method is that surface\
    \ temperature can be obtained from the observation sites,\nwhich is beneﬁcial\
    \ for the equatorial regions. Chang et al. [117] studied the soil moisture conditions\
    \ of\ndifferent types of land in tropical mountains using the ATI model.\nTo accurately\
    \ derive the SM, Chen et al. [118] monitored the spring drought by using the improved\n\
    ATI model for the Hebei Plain. Next, 1 km pure pixels were merged with images\
    \ with 30 m resolution\nfrom the 1st environmental satellite (HJ-1) and the drought\
    \ was accurately monitored in the vegetated\nmixing zone. It was concluded that\
    \ the traditional ATI model was the most suitable for bare land areas\nand that\
    \ the inversion accuracy of the mixed pixels was poor.\nThe physical thermal inertia\
    \ model can provide information regarding hydrothermally relevant\nprinciples\
    \ and the relationships with SM; however, this model requires detailed atmospheric\
    \ forcing\ndata inputs and a complex calculation process. ATI is used as a proxy\
    \ of thermal inertia, and because\nmany factors are truncated, accuracy is often\
    \ not guaranteed. In addition, ATI is not applicable in\nvegetated regions. For\
    \ vegetated areas, FVC should be used to estimate thermal inertia. Moreover, the\n\
    ATI can be combined with other soil moisture indexes to calculate the SM [115].\
    \ Because ATI is simple\nand easy to operate, it is promising for broad applications.\n\

    \ Cracknell [119] introduced land surface temperature phase information to simplify\
    \ the\nanalytical thermal inertia model, in which only the ground auxiliary data,\
    \ the time that the maximum\nLST occurs, is required and the real thermal inertia\
    \ can be obtained. This approach greatly simpliﬁes\nthe sophisticated calculation\
    \ process. Thus, many scholars have subsequently estimated SM using this\nmethod.\
    \ Cai et al. [120] used the full thermal inertia model of [119] and a second order\
    \ approximation\napproach to retrieve the thermal inertia surface that was applied\
    \ to north China to monitor the SM\nstatus and achieve good results.\nThe main\
    \ equation of the full model [121] is\nP = (1 − A)S0Ct\n∆T√ω\nA1[cos(ωt2 − δ1)\
    \ − cos(ωt1 − δ1)]\nq\n1 + 1\nb +\n1\n2b2\nδ1 = ωtmax − 2mπ, m = 0, 1, 2 . . .\n\
    (10)\nwhere A is the albedo, S0 is the solar constant. b is a synthesized term.\
    \ Ct is the atmospheric\ntransmittance in the visible spectrum (typically 0.75).\
    \ w is the Earth rotation velocity. δ is the phase\nangle. ∆T is the temperature\
    \ difference. If n = 1, P can reach a maximum value. In addition, t is the\ntime\
    \ at which the maximum LST occurs.\nThe model proposed by Xue and Cracknell requires\
    \ important auxiliary parameters from the\nground-based observations (the time\
    \ of the maximum LST occurs) but, in practical applications, the\nmaximum air\
    \ temperature observation time is used as an input value. Because the maximum\
    \ LST and\nair temperature occurred differently with time, the model induces uncertainties\
    \ by using the maximum\nair temperature. Because polar-orbiting satellites are\
    \ limited by the times that they pass over the same\narea and cannot obtain constant\
    \ observations, the method proposed by Sobrino includes a certain\ndegree of difﬁculty.\
    \ However, the emergence of geostationary satellites would support this method\n\
    and many observations can be obtained for the same study area in one day. In addition,\
    \ the use of\nobservation periods in the model has not been speciﬁcally validated.\n\
    Based on the model proposed by Xue and Cracknell, Sobrino et al. [122,123] developed\
    \ the\nFour Temperature Algorithm (FTA) to calculate soil thermal inertia by using\
    \ three surface temperatures\nat different times on the same day from all the\
    \ calibrated remote sensing results, including viewing\nSensors 2016, 16, 1308\n\
    9 of 29\ngeometry and atmospheric correction. The results were reasonable and\
    \ veriﬁed for the Iberian\nPeninsula and Morocco.\nThe key process of the FTA\
    \ model is:\nδ1 = arctan(ξ) + (2mπ + 1), m = 0, 1, 2 . . .\nξ =\n(Tj−Tk)[cos(ωti)−cos(ωtj)]−(Ti−Tj)[cos(ωtj)−cos(ωtk)]\n\
    (Ti−Tj)[sin(ωtj)−sin(ωtk)]−(Tj−Tk)[sin(ωti)−sin(ωtj)]\n(11)\nwhere the symbols\
    \ in the above equation is the same as the Equation (10). This method used three\n\
    different time phases to solve the equations, and the phase angle information\
    \ can be written as\na function of LST and satellite overpass time, which eliminates\
    \ the ground auxiliary data; thus,\nthe soil thermal inertia can only be obtained\
    \ from remotely sensed data. Because it is difﬁcult to\nobtain more than two high-quality\
    \ remotely sensed images in one day from remote sensing satellites\n(except geostationary\
    \ satellites) and because of night clouds and atmospheric effects, this method\
    \ has\nencountered many problems in practical applications and is difﬁcult to\
    \ use universally.\nRecently, people actively sought high-accurate methods for\
    \ solving thermal inertia. Wang [106]\nproposed using a simple thermal inertia\
    \ estimation method based on idealized soil temperature to\nobtain an analytical\
    \ solution for diffusion in the sinusoidal form. Thermal inertia can be expressed\
    \ as\na scale factor in a linear relationship between the soil heat ﬂux and surface\
    \ temperature amplitude;\nthus, the estimation accuracy was improved. The biggest\
    \ advantage of this method is that the available\ninput parameters can be easily\
    \ obtained from remotely sensed data. Moreover, fewer model input\nparameters\
    \ are needed and the precision is high.\nMaltese [124] analyzed the applicable\
    \ conditions of a thermal inertia model in sparsely vegetated\nareas and introduced\
    \ a correction factor for cloud effects to rectify downward shortwave radiation.\n\
    The applicability of the thermal inertia model was evaluated under changeable\
    \ weather conditions.\nMeanwhile, Robock et al. [125] studied the data quality\
    \ of a thermal inertia model combined\nwith a two-source model to separate skin\
    \ temperature for vegetation and bare soil and conducted\na sensitivity analysis\
    \ of the input parameters, such as solar radiation and meteorological data.\n\
    The thermal inertia was obtained by using thermal budget model.\n3.1.3. Analysis\
    \ Method Based on Energy Sources\nVerhoef [126] indicated that the direct energy\
    \ source of thermal inertia is soil heat ﬂux rather than\nnet radiation and developed\
    \ a surface temperature difference method between sunset and sunrise for\nsolving\
    \ thermal inertia. If the latent heat ﬂux and sensible heat ﬂux are both zero\
    \ and the net radiation\nremains constant on clear windless nights, the following\
    \ formula can be used:\n(Ch\np\nDh)r = 2\n\f\fRn\n\f\f √\n∆t\n∆Ts\n√π\n(12)\n\
    where\n\f\fRn\n\f\f is the average net radiation ﬂux between sunset and sunrise\
    \ (W·m−2), ∆t is the time\ninterval (s), and ∆Ts is the decrease in LST between\
    \ sunset and sunrise (◦C), Ch is the soil heat capacity\n(MJ·m−3·K−1), Dh is the\
    \ thermal diffusivity (m2·s−1).\nBy comparing different methods to estimate thermal\
    \ inertia and soil heat ﬂux, Murray and\nVerhoef [127–129] conﬁrmed that this\
    \ approach is relatively simple and reliable. However, because\nof the harsh applicable\
    \ conditions, this method has rarely been used. First, this method requires\n\
    a clear and windless night with constant net radiation. These weather conditions\
    \ are generally difﬁcult\nto satisfy. In addition, it is difﬁcult to guarantee\
    \ image quality at night, which results in incorrect\nestimation results.\nSensors\
    \ 2016, 16, 1308\n10 of 29\n3.1.4. Remote Sensing Methods Combined with Soil Physical\
    \ Parameters\nA relationship with soil moisture can be established based on the\
    \ deﬁnition of thermal inertia if\nsoil characteristics and remotely sensed data\
    \ are available for estimating thermal inertia. Lu et al. [130]\nproposed using\
    \ a simple model that considers the soil solid composition and other known pivotal\
    \ soil\ncharacteristics, such as soil composition and density.\nThe main equations\
    \ are calculated as follows:\nP = Pdry + (Psat − Pdry)Kp\n(13)\nKp = exp[γ(1 −\
    \ Sγ−δ\nr\n)]\n(14)\nwhere Pdry and Psat are the dry and wet soil thermal inertia,\
    \ respectively, and Kp is the Kersten correction\nfunction. γ and δ were soil\
    \ texture dependent model parameters and Sr was the degree of saturation.\nIn\
    \ addition, Verstraeten et al. [106] used the apparent thermal inertia and soil\
    \ moisture\nsaturation index (SMSI) combined with Meteosat Second Generation (MSG)\
    \ data to estimate the\nSM. When verifying the analysis by using in-situ data\
    \ and the microwave moisture content, the results\nshowed that the values and\
    \ trends ﬁt well. M. Minacapilli [131,132] normalized the Kp function by\nusing\
    \ ATI with remotely sensed data to obtain the actual thermal inertia based on\
    \ the soil porosity.\nThermal inertia methods focus on soil thermal characteristics\
    \ and have clear physical meanings\nthat are relatively easy to understand. Different\
    \ methods are compared in Table 3. In practical\napplications, clear day and night\
    \ images are difﬁcult to obtain for the same area of interest because of\nclouds,\
    \ and the accuracy for night image is difﬁcult to conﬁrm. Simultaneously, the\
    \ assumption that\nthe soil properties at the horizontal and vertical scale are\
    \ consistent is not readily satisﬁed. Moreover, in\nareas with high vegetation\
    \ cover, vegetation conceals the soil information, which affects the estimation\n\
    accuracy. Thus, this method is only applicable to bare and sparsely vegetated\
    \ areas.\nTable 3. Comparisons of the common thermal inertia methods.\nMethods\n\

    \ is one control parameter for the physical and biological processes that\noccur\
    \ at the land surface. For bare soil area, LST refers to the soil surface temperature;\
    \ and for densely\nvegetated areas, the LST indicates the vegetation canopy temperature\
    \ under the assumption of energy\nbalance. An increase in the vegetation canopy\
    \ temperature is an initial indicator that the vegetation is\nsubject to water\
    \ stress. Therefore, the LST can be used to monitor the SM.\nSensors 2016, 16,\
    \ 1308\n11 of 29\n3.2.1. Normalized Difference Temperature Index\nConsidering\
    \ the seasonal variations of the LST, Mcvicar et al. [133] developed the normalized\n\
    difference temperature index (NDTI) to reﬂect the SM conditions. The NDTI is calculated\
    \ as follows:\nNDTI = (LST∞ − LST)/(LST∞ − LST0)\n(15)\nwhere LST∞ and LST0 are\
    \ the simulated LSTs of the inﬁnite and zero surface impedance, respectively,\n\
    which are the upper (extremely dry state) and lower (extremely wet state) boundary\
    \ conditions for the\nLST at speciﬁc atmospheric forcing and surface impedance.\
    \ The surface energy balance principle and\naerodynamic impedance model can be\
    \ used to obtain the extreme LSTs.\nNDTI eliminates the effects of the seasonal\
    \ variations of LST. The SM is very similar to the\nNDTI [134]. Thus, the NDTI\
    \ can accurately reﬂect the spatial-temporal variations of SM. However, this\n\
    model requires solar radiation, wind speed and LAI as input values, which could\
    \ limit the operability\nof the model.\n3.2.2. Crop Water Stress Index\nSoil water\
    \ availability is a basic variable for the evapotranspiration process. In addition,\
    \ the SM\naffects the evapotranspiration rate. Evapotranspiration and energy are\
    \ closely related to the SM.\nWhen the energy is high and the SM is sufﬁcient,\
    \ strong evapotranspiration occurs and the canopy\ntemperature is lower. By contrast,\
    \ evapotranspiration is weak and the canopy temperature increases\nwhen the vegetation\
    \ is subjected to water stress. For a speciﬁc atmospheric condition, the ratio\
    \ of\nactual and potential evapotranspiration can be used as a proxy for crop\
    \ water stress. Based on the\nsurface energy balance model, Jackson et al. [135]\
    \ proposed using the crop water stress index (CWSI)\nto mirror the ratio between\
    \ vegetation transpiration and maximum potential evaporation. The CWSI\nis obtained\
    \ from the vegetation canopy temperature, ambient air temperature and net solar\
    \ radiation.\nThe CWSI formula is shown as follows:\nCWSI =\n(Tc − Ta) − (Tc −\
    \ Ta)min\n(Tc − Ta)max − (Tc − Ta)min\n(16)\nwhere Tc is the vegetation canopy\
    \ temperature, Ta is the air temperature, and (Tc–Ta)max and (Tc–Ta)min\nare the\
    \ difference between the canopy and air temperature without transpiration and\
    \ potential\nevaporation, respectively.\nThe CWSI uses thermal infrared temperatures\
    \ and meteorological data to indirectly reﬂect the SM\nunder crops. This method\
    \ has clear physical meaning based on the surface energy balance principle.\n\
    In addition, this method is highly precise in regions covered by vegetation and\
    \ the estimation accuracy\nis higher than that of the thermal inertia method [136].\
    \ However, the CWSI was established based on\nthe single canopy energy balance\
    \ model, which is less effective for early crop growth. In addition,\nthis approach\
    \ requires meteorological data and the calculation process is complex. Furthermore,\n\
    the extrapolation methods used for meteorological data, which are mainly obtained\
    \ from ground\nweather stations, have important impacts on the accuracies of the\
    \ CWSI determinations.\n4. SM Estimations from Visible and Thermal Infrared Remote\
    \ Sensing Data\n4.1. The Spatial Information-Based Method\nMany studies have demonstrated\
    \ that LST and VI (vegetation index/vegetation coverage) can\nprovide vegetation\
    \ water stress conditions and SM information [137–148]. If the number of pixels\
    \ in\nthe study area is sufﬁcient and the clouds and water bodies are removed,\
    \ the spatial distribution of\nLST and VI constitute triangular or trapezoidal\
    \ feature space. The SM can be obtained from the pixel\ndistribution in the LST-VI\
    \ feature space.\nSensors 2016, 16, 1308\n12 of 29\nBecause the surface energy\
    \ maintains balance in the LST-VI feature space, lower latent heat ﬂux\nresults\
    \ in more available energy for the surface sensible heat ﬂux. For transpiration,\
    \ which is a crucial\nparameter, the stomatal resistance is inﬂuenced by the soil\
    \ moisture availability. In sparsely vegetated\nregions, the thermal soil inertia\
    \ affects the LST because it affects the transfer of heat into the soil and\n\
    the soil heat ﬂux [149,150]. These thermal characteristics are a function of soil\
    \ type and soil moisture\nvariations [151]. In addition, the surface available\
    \ energy (Rn-G) also inﬂuences the LST. The control\nof the surface temperature\
    \ by radiation means that low net shortwave radiation areas have lower\ntemperatures.\
    \ In addition, the surface albedo is affected by soil type, soil moisture and\
    \ vegetation cover.\nFurthermore, incident radiation affects transpiration and\
    \ stomatal resistance, and the net radiation can\nbe decomposed to sensible and\
    \ latent heat ﬂux. The transfer of energy as heat from the surface to the\natmosphere\
    \ is an important component for surface temperature and explains why the temperatures\n\
    in areas with high vegetation coverage roughness are lower than those in areas\
    \ with bare soil, which\ninﬂuences the shape of the LST-VI space.\nThe LST-VI\
    \ feature space is restricted by the dry and wet edges. The wet edge in the feature\n\
    space represents maximum evapotranspiration and adequate soil moisture and the\
    \ dry edge indicates\nthat the vegetation is subjected to water stress in which\
    \ evapotranspiration reaches the minimum and\nthe SM is 0 (no water can be used).\
    \ For different vegetation types, the dry edge includes the driest\npoints and\
    \ the vegetation evapotranspiration varies depending on the amount of vegetation\
    \ coverage.\nFor certain types, the available energy (Rn-G) is considered nearly\
    \ equal. Because cooling affects\nevaporation, the surface temperature is maximized\
    \ at the dry edge and minimized at the wet edge.\nDifferent views of the surface\
    \ temperature in the fully vegetated area resulted in the development of\nthe\
    \ triangular and trapezoidal methods. The triangular method assumes that the surface\
    \ temperatures\nof fully vegetated areas are equal to the wettest surface temperature.\
    \ However, the trapezoidal method\nassumes that the surface temperatures of fully\
    \ vegetated surfaces are much higher than those of the\nwettest surface.\n4.1.1.\
    \ The Triangle Method\nWith the feature space constructed by LST and VI, Price\
    \ [152] ﬁrst proposed the concept of\ntriangular space. The triangle method is\
    \ proposed based on surface temperatures and VI scatter plots\nobtained using\
    \ satellites (Figure 2). Combined with the simulation results of the land surface\
    \ model,\nthe simulated feature space is stretched to the satellite by analyzing\
    \ the position of the image element\nin space to infer the SM.\nSensors 2016,\
    \ 16, 1308 \n12 of 29 \n \ncrucial parameter, the stomatal resistance is influenced\
    \ by the soil moisture availability. In sparsely \nvegetated regions, the thermal\
    \ soil inertia affects the LST because it affects the transfer of heat into \n\
    the soil and the soil heat flux [149,150]. These thermal characteristics are a\
    \ function of soil type and \nsoil moisture variations [151]. In addition, the\
    \ surface available energy (Rn-G) also influences the \nLST. The control of the\
    \ surface temperature by radiation means that low net shortwave radiation \nareas\
    \ have lower temperatures. In addition, the surface albedo is affected by soil\
    \ type, soil moisture \nand vegetation cover. Furthermore, incident radiation\
    \ affects transpiration and stomatal resistance, \nand the net radiation can be\
    \ decomposed to sensible and latent heat flux. The transfer of energy as \nheat\
    \ from the surface to the atmosphere is an important component for surface temperature\
    \ and \nexplains why the temperatures in areas with high vegetation coverage roughness\
    \ are lower than \nthose in areas with bare soil, which influences the shape of\
    \ the LST-VI space. \nThe LST-VI feature space is restricted by the dry and wet\
    \ edges. The wet edge in the feature \nspace represents maximum evapotranspiration\
    \ and adequate soil moisture and the dry edge \nindicates that the vegetation\
    \ is subjected to water stress in which evapotranspiration reaches the \nminimum\
    \ and the SM is 0 (no water can be used). For different vegetation types, the\
    \ dry edge \nincludes the driest points and the vegetation evapotranspiration\
    \ varies depending on the amount of \nvegetation coverage. For certain types,\
    \ the available energy (Rn-G) is considered nearly equal. \nBecause cooling affects\
    \ evaporation, the surface temperature is maximized at the dry edge and \nminimized\
    \ at the wet edge. Different views of the surface temperature in the fully vegetated\
    \ area \nresulted in the development of the triangular and trapezoidal methods.\
    \ The triangular method \nassumes that the surface temperatures of fully vegetated\
    \ areas are equal to the wettest surface \ntemperature. However, the trapezoidal\
    \ method assumes that the surface temperatures of fully \nvegetated surfaces are\
    \ much higher than those of the wettest surface.  \n4.1.1. The Triangle Method\
    \ \nWith the feature space constructed by LST and VI, Price [152] first proposed\
    \ the concept of \ntriangular space. The triangle method is proposed based on\
    \ surface temperatures and VI scatter \nplots obtained using satellites (Figure\
    \ 2). Combined with the simulation results of the land surface \nmodel, the simulated\
    \ feature space is stretched to the satellite by analyzing the position of the\
    \ image \nelement in space to infer the SM.  \n \nFigure 2. The idealized triangle\
    \ space between Ts and Fv [138]. \nThe LST-VI triangular feature space established\
    \ under the full ranges of SM and vegetation is \ncharacteristic of a space bounded\
    \ with an upper decreasing envelope and a lower nearly horizontal \nenvelope with\
    \ increasing vegetation cover and with two envelopes ultimately intersecting at\
    \ a \n(truncated) point of full vegetation cover [153]. Price [152] presented\
    \ the LST-VI triangular space \nusing satellite remotely sensed AVHRR data and\
    \ analyzed the impacts of cirrus on soil moisture. \nNemani [147] studied the\
    \ scale effects of the LST-VI space and its orographic influences on LST and \n\
    VI and indicated that vegetation type and topography are two decisive factors.\
    \ Similarly, Clark [142] \napplied multi-spectral data to monitor drought and\
    \ presented an empirical model. Mallick [154] \nFigure 2. The idealized triangle\

    \ inﬂuences on LST and\nVI and indicated that vegetation type and topography are\
    \ two decisive factors. Similarly, Clark [142]\napplied multi-spectral data to\
    \ monitor drought and presented an empirical model. Mallick [154]\nretrieved SM\
    \ using the triangle method at the ﬁeld and landscapes scales by using ASTER and\
    \ MODIS,\nrespectively. Both results were reasonable. The inversion accuracy is\
    \ much lower for high spatial\nresolution images because it is more difﬁcult to\
    \ reﬂect heterogeneity within the pixels.\nThe main assumptions of the triangle\
    \ method are that (1) the complete underlying vegetation\ncover from the bare\
    \ soil to full vegetation is know; (2) the variations in the space are not primarily\n\
    caused by differences in atmospheric conditions but are caused by variations in\
    \ the available SM;\nand (3) the sensitivity of LST to the canopy and soil is\
    \ different. Due to the special characteristic of\ntriangular space, the major\
    \ advantages of this method include the following: (1) it can estimate the\nSM\
    \ from entirely remotely sensed data without any ground auxiliary data; and (2)\
    \ it is simple and\neasy to operate and can monitor drought conditions over large\
    \ regions. Meanwhile, the limitations\ninclude the following: (1) the LST-VI space\
    \ determination requires a certain degree of subjectivity;\n(2) the number of\
    \ pixels is large enough to span a wide range of soil wetness and vegetation cover\
    \ in\nthe study area; and (3) many limitations occur in regions that are not ﬂat.\n\
    4.1.2. The Trapezoid Method\nUsing experiments, Jackson [155] explored the relationships\
    \ between drought and differences in\nvegetation leaf and air temperature by using\
    \ measured data and proposed a drought index—CWSI.\nTo calculate the pixel values\
    \ of intermediate vegetation cover and SM for a speciﬁc time, four vertices of\n\
    the trapezoid are required that correspond to (1) well-watered, full-cover vegetation;\
    \ (2) water-stressed,\nfull-cover vegetation; (3) saturated bare soil; and (4)\
    \ dry bare soil. These values should be computed\nﬁrst by using the CWSI theory\
    \ and Penman-Monteith equation. This index can only be used for fully\nvegetated\
    \ areas and is not applicable in sparsely vegetated areas.\nBased on the theory\
    \ of the CWSI, Moran [31] developed the water deﬁcit index (WDI) (Figure 3) to\n\
    overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings. This index can be used in all areas\
    \ covered by vegetation\nand in areas with sparse vegetation. Relying on the surface\
    \ energy balance principle, the soil adjusted\nvegetation index (SAVI) and the\
    \ temperature difference form a trapezoidal space, and the index can\nbe directly\
    \ calculated from remotely sensed data without requirements for measuring leaf\
    \ and air\ntemperature. After the model test and in situ data validation, the\
    \ WDI was evaluated to overestimate\nthe water deﬁcit situations in many sparsely\
    \ vegetated regions.\nCompared with the triangular space, the trapezoidal space\
    \ does not require a large number of\npixels. The advantages of the trapezoidal\
    \ method are that (1) it has a robust physical basis and that\n(2) the space determined\
    \ from the four vertices is the main limiting condition that is close to the true\n\
    conditions of the land surface. In contrast, the disadvantages include that this\
    \ method (1) requires\nmore ground-based parameters to calculate the soil moisture\
    \ index and that (2) the inﬂuences of water\nstress on vegetation cover have a\
    \ time lag that induces uncertainties for SM estimations.\nSensors 2016, 16, 1308\
    \ \n13 of 29 \n \nretrieved SM using the triangle method at the field and landscapes\
    \ scales by using ASTER and \nMODIS, respectively. Both results were reasonable.\
    \ The inversion accuracy is much lower for high \nspatial resolution images because\
    \ it is more difficult to reflect heterogeneity within the pixels. \nThe main\
    \ assumptions of the triangle method are that (1) the complete underlying vegetation\
    \ \ncover from the bare soil to full vegetation is know; (2) the variations in\
    \ the space are not primarily \ncaused by differences in atmospheric conditions\
    \ but are caused by variations in the available SM; \nand (3) the sensitivity\
    \ of LST to the canopy and soil is different. Due to the special characteristic\
    \ of \ntriangular space, the major advantages of this method include the following:\

    \ equation. \nThis index can only be used for fully vegetated areas and is not\
    \ applicable in sparsely vegetated \nareas. \nBased on the theory of the CWSI,\
    \ Moran [31] developed the water deficit index (WDI) (Figure 3) \nto overcome\
    \ the above-mentioned shortcomings. This index can be used in all areas covered\
    \ by \nvegetation and in areas with sparse vegetation. Relying on the surface\
    \ energy balance principle, the \nsoil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) and the\
    \ temperature difference form a trapezoidal space, and \nthe index can be directly\
    \ calculated from remotely sensed data without requirements for measuring \nleaf\
    \ and air temperature. After the model test and in situ data validation, the WDI\
    \ was evaluated to \noverestimate the water deficit situations in many sparsely\
    \ vegetated regions. \nCompared with the triangular space, the trapezoidal space\
    \ does not require a large number of \npixels. The advantages of the trapezoidal\
    \ method are that (1) it has a robust physical basis and that \n(2) the space\
    \ determined from the four vertices is the main limiting condition that is close\
    \ to the true \nconditions of the land surface. In contrast, the disadvantages\
    \ include that this method (1) requires \nmore ground-based parameters to calculate\
    \ the soil moisture index and that (2) the influences of \nwater stress on vegetation\
    \ cover have a time lag that induces uncertainties for SM estimations. \n \nFigure\

    \ Accurate estimation results were achieved for specific atmospheric conditions.\
    \ The main \nadvantages of this method include the following: (1) the proposed\
    \ model is independent on the soil \ntypes; (2) the quantitative SM is determined\
    \ by using the method rather than from the empirical \nrelationship between SM\
    \ and the remotely sensed parameters; and (3) the diurnal changes of the \nland\
    \ surface parameters are used rather than the instantaneous parameters that have\
    \ many \nuncertainties at some moments. However, the limitations of the proposed\
    \ model are discussed \nbelow. (1) The model is suitable for bare soils on cloudless\
    \ days and the accuracy is greatly reduced \nin the vegetated areas. This reduction\
    \ in accuracy occurs because the elliptical shape constructed by \nthe NSSR and\
    \ LST appears under bare soil conditions. When the surface is covered by vegetation,\
    \ \nthe surface energy distribution is more complex than that of the bare soil\
    \ and the elliptical shape is \naffected by the vegetation interference; (2) the\
    \ coefficients of the proposed model change with \natmospheric conditions. Thus,\
    \ it is difficult to fix to the coefficients to establish a universal equation\
    \ \nfor estimating SM. Additionally, how to acquire these model parameters at\
    \ the regional scale must \nbe addressed before applying the proposed SM model\
    \ to remotely sensed data [156]. Therefore, \nthese two problems are important\

    However, the limitations of the proposed model are discussed below. (1) The model\
    \ is suitable for bare\nsoils on cloudless days and the accuracy is greatly reduced\
    \ in the vegetated areas. This reduction in\naccuracy occurs because the elliptical\
    \ shape constructed by the NSSR and LST appears under bare\nsoil conditions. When\
    \ the surface is covered by vegetation, the surface energy distribution is more\n\
    complex than that of the bare soil and the elliptical shape is affected by the\
    \ vegetation interference;\n(2) the coefﬁcients of the proposed model change with\
    \ atmospheric conditions. Thus, it is difﬁcult to\nﬁx to the coefﬁcients to establish\
    \ a universal equation for estimating SM. Additionally, how to acquire\nthese\
    \ model parameters at the regional scale must be addressed before applying the\
    \ proposed SM\nmodel to remotely sensed data [156]. Therefore, these two problems\
    \ are important issues that concern\nthe application of the model with remotely\

    \ Used in Soil Moisture Estimation Models\nThe accuracy of the estimated SM is\
    \ inﬂuenced by the input variables that must be accurately\nobtained from in situ\
    \ measurements or remote sensing. Inaccurate input parameters can induce many\n\
    uncertainties in soil moisture estimations. For example, one advantage of the\
    \ model proposed by Xue\nand Cracknell [182] is to apply the variations in the\
    \ surface temperature phase to estimate thermal\ninertia. However, in the derivation\
    \ process, the equation requires a priori knowledge of the time\nat which the\
    \ maximum LST occurs. In practical applications, authors always use the maximum\
    \ air\ntemperature observed at ground meteorological stations instead, since the\
    \ maximum air temperature\nis easy to obtain. In addition, according to previous\
    \ studies, the maximum LST is lower than the\nmaximum air temperature by up to\
    \ 4–5 ◦C [155]. Thus, accurate maximum air temperature estimation\nusing the remotely\
    \ sensed data provides an effective means to obtain precise real thermal inertia.\n\
    In addition, based on the model proposed by Xue, Sobrino et al. developed a new\
    \ remotely sensed\nmodel, the FTA model, to estimate thermal inertia by using\
    \ the phase differences between the different\noverpass times of the NOAA satellite.\
    \ Current problems include: (1) the polar-orbiting satellite data\ncannot satisfy\
    \ the requirements of high quality images; and (2) the observed surface times\
    \ are 2:30,\n7:30, 14:30 and 19:30, respectively, and the surface difference is\
    \ obtained at 2:30 and 14:30. The phase\ndifferences are determined at 7:30, 14:30\
    \ and 19:30. In addition, with the development of the satellites,\nthe geostationary\
    \ meteorological satellite can provide many data in one day, which can compensate\
    \ for\nthe limitations of polar-orbiting satellites. Moreover, large errors can\
    \ be induced by the LSTs twice each\nday to simulate the daily LST variations,\
    \ and more data are required to simulate the diurnal variations\nin surface temperature\
    \ [183].\nThe accuracy of the input parameters partially determined the robustness\
    \ of the SM estimation\nmodels. In practical applications, many studies have ignored\
    \ the limitations of these models or have\nselected approximate parameters. Consequently,\
    \ although the soil moisture estimation can satisfy\na certain degree of accuracy,\
    \ they are usually not used correctly. Soil moisture estimation models\nare obtained\
    \ using many preconditions and assumptions. Therefore, model selection based on\
    \ the\nunderlying conditions and the required input parameters is very important.\
    \ It is worth noting that\nthe mismatch in scale between the point-based observations\
    \ and the remotely sensed data remains\na problem to be solved.\nSensors 2016,\
    \ 16, 1308\n17 of 29\n5.2. Soil Moisture under Vegetation\nThe sensors receive\
    \ the composite signal from the surface, which includes the soil and vegetation.\n\
    In the vegetated regions, removing the vegetation effect to estimate SM becomes\
    \ a problem. Currently,\none-source models consider the soil and vegetation as\
    \ a composite leaf that is called the big leaf\nmodel. These models cannot separate\
    \ the soil from the mixed remotely sensed pixels. Thus, the\nSM in the vegetated\
    \ area is manifested by the vegetation index or temperature vegetation dryness\n\
    index. However, the quantitative SM is not easy to be obtained under vegetation\
    \ cover. To solve the\nabove-mentioned problems, two-source models (such as ALEXI,\
    \ N95 et al.) were used to separate\nthe soil and vegetation information and describe\
    \ the energy exchange among the soil, vegetation and\natmosphere. The SM may be\
    \ accurately estimated if pure soil information can be separated from the\ncomposite\
    \ context.\nAdditionally, because many soil physical parameters cannot be obtained\
    \ by using remotely\nsensed data, this method only can use empirical equations\
    \ or in situ measurements to determine these\nvariables. Soil texture information\
    \ exhibits considerable heterogeneity and is difﬁcult to obtain for large\nregions.\
    \ In addition, it is difﬁcult to establish a universal relationship for SM across\
    \ different study\nareas. To simplify the physical formula and facilitate calculation,\
    \ the soil physical variables can be\nparameterized to establish a correlation\
    \ with the obtained variables from remote sensing. This method\nmay be ultimately\
    \ a robust method that not only considers the soil physical properties but also\
    \ can be\nrealized using remote sensing techniques.\n5.3. Uncertain Quantitative\
    \ Relationships between the Remotely Sensed Indices/Thermal Inertia and SM\nNo\
    \ determinate quantitative relationships between the thermal inertia/drought indices\
    \ and SM\nare widely accepted by all the experts. However, many authors have considered\
    \ this linear relationship\nas a simple method for determining SM. Several authors\
    \ have indicated that these variables are not\nlinearly related in empirical statistical\
    \ experiments. Currently, the commonly applied equations are\nlinear or exponential.\
    \ However, although the SM estimation methods have matured and the thermal\ninertia/drought\
    \ indices can be determined relatively accurately, determining the SM from thermal\n\
    inertia/drought indices remains uncertain. Thus, a universal and quantitative\
    \ relationship between\nthe SM and thermal inertia/drought indices must be accurately\
    \ determined.\n5.4. Lack of Surface Data for Validating Remotely Sensed SM\nRemotely\
    \ sensed soil moisture validation is a problem in SM estimation research. The\
    \ most\ncommonly used methods are validated by single point-based or multiple\
    \ point-based measurements.\nIn addition, many researchers have attempted to use\
    \ up-scaling or down-scaling methods to validate\nSM estimates from remote sensing\
    \ data [184]. Remotely sensed data have wide spatial coverage of the\nunderlying\
    \ surface, such as 30 m, 1 km, or even several kilometers. In addition, the retrieved\
    \ SM is\nthe pixel value of the satellite data that indicates the situation of\
    \ the entire region. However, surface\nmeasurements are always conducted at single\
    \ points and cannot represent the entire region due to the\nspatial and temporal\
    \ changes of the SM [185]. Remotely sensed SMs are frequently validated by many\n\
    measured point values in study areas, which results in many uncertainties. Moreover,\
    \ the developed\nSM indices serve as proxies that indicate drought conditions\
    \ and are not true SM contents. To obtain\nthe actual SM, the wilting and saturation\
    \ points of the soil in the study area must be known, which can\nresult in errors.\
    \ Therefore, a surface-to-surface validation method should be developed to solve\
    \ this\nproblem. Aerial photography or UAV may provide the actual state of the\
    \ ground surface, which could\nbe used to verify the derived SM.\n5.5. Uncertainties\
    \ in the Application of Soil Moisture Estimation Models\nAs described above, each\
    \ soil moisture estimation model is developed with preconditions and\nassumptions.\
    \ Many uncertainties are introduced by key processes when applying soil moisture\n\
    Sensors 2016, 16, 1308\n18 of 29\nestimation models. For example, the spatial-information\
    \ based method includes two important\nprocesses, determining the limiting edge\
    \ and interpolation between the dry and wet edges.\nFirst, determining the dry\
    \ and wet edges is important for estimating soil moisture from the LST-VI\nspace,\
    \ which directly affects the retrieval accuracy. In practice, most studies use\
    \ the least squares\nmethod to directly ﬁt scattering at the dry and wet edge.\
    \ However, due to underlying heterogeneity and\ndifferent atmospheric forcing,\
    \ the extracted wet and dry edges are unstable and introduce uncertainties,\n\
    which eventually lead to SM estimation errors. Currently, two main methods are\
    \ used to derive the\ndry and wet edges from scattering in the feature space,\
    \ the auto-determined edge algorithm and the\ntheoretical edge determination method.\
    \ The main advantages of the auto-determined edge method\nare that it is simple\
    \ to operate, highly accurate, and has wide application. However, one limitation\
    \ is\nthat the auto-determined edges are changeable with the size of the study\
    \ area and that the extreme dry\nand wet points must all be present in the LST-VI\
    \ space. Sometimes, true dry or wet edges do not exist\nbecause energy and water\
    \ balance must be met under extreme conditions. Thus, many experts have\ntried\
    \ to derive theoretical edges based on the surface energy balance principle as\
    \ a boundary condition.\nThe auto-determined edge method can be used to estimate\
    \ soil moisture from remote sensing data\nbut results in large errors due to its\
    \ subjectivity and the effects of atmospheric conditions. The surface\nenergy\
    \ balance method for solving theoretical edges has a robust physical basis because\
    \ the requirement\nfor more underlying surface auxiliary data results in a complicated\
    \ calculation process. It is difﬁcult\nto obtain pure remote sensing data, and\
    \ many parameters introduce uncertainty. Therefore, a simple\nand applicable method\
    \ for remote sensing to obtain theoretical dry and wet edges is a promising\n\
    approach. The two-source models can provide wizards for solving this problem that\
    \ can separate\nthe soil and vegetation surface temperatures. This method can\
    \ be used to obtain a true dry point for\nbare soil and full vegetation before\
    \ deriving theoretically limiting edges by using an energy balance\nmodel. Second,\
    \ many authors have found that LST and SM are negatively correlated in the LST-VI\n\
    space; thus, numerous studies have been based on the assumption that surface temperature\
    \ and soil\nmoisture vary linearly with changes in vegetation cover [141]. However,\
    \ Carlson et al. [186] observed\nthat this change is not linear according to the\
    \ SVAT model simulation. In practical applications, most\nscholars still assume\
    \ that the soil moisture varies linearly in the scatter space. The interpolation\
    \ of the\nfeature space represents the relationships among SM, LST and FVC. The\
    \ linear interpolation is simple\nand easy to operate but cannot truly reﬂect\
    \ the SM variations in the feature space [187]. Although the\nnon-linear interpolation\
    \ is complex and difﬁcult to operate, it is highly accurate [188]. Thus, how can\n\
    we develop a method to interpolate the space based on a physical mechanism and\
    \ the SM? Thermal\ninertia is a physical property of the substance itself. Thus,\
    \ if thermal inertia is too complicated to use,\nthe ATI could be used to replace\
    \ it. The ATI may be helpful for interpolating the feature space in\nfuture research.\n\
    In summary, comprehensive analyses of the aforementioned SM estimation methods\
    \ based on\noptical and thermal remote sensing were performed. Although remote\
    \ multi-monitoring and inversion\nmethods involve different types of ﬁelds and\
    \ relatively broad scopes, they have many shortcomings.\nIn general, despite their\
    \ susceptibility to clouds, vegetation effects and limited penetration, optical\
    \ and\nthermal remote sensing data have high spatial resolutions with multi-satellite\
    \ sensors and large spatial\ncoverage. Moreover, soil moisture and surface temperatures\
    \ are strongly correlated. Thus, soil moisture\nestimations are more promising.\
    \ Although some models are relatively simple and have clear physical\nmeaning,\
    \ some methods, such as thermal inertia and apparent thermal inertia methods,\
    \ are mainly\nsuitable for bare soils or for early crop growth conditions. In\
    \ addition, due to the impacts of soil texture\nand type, the relationships between\
    \ thermal inertia and soil moisture are often nonlinear. However,\nthe method\
    \ is derived under certain assumptions, and the effects of these assumptions on\
    \ the retrieval\nresults must be further validated. The triangle/trapezoid method\
    \ mainly uses the spatial distribution\nof pixel information when the requirements\
    \ of study area are large enough and contain a variety of\nground conditions,\
    \ including different vegetation coverage and soil moisture. In some cases, this\n\
    condition is not easily satisﬁed. The temporal information-based methods require\
    \ observation data for\nSensors 2016, 16, 1308\n19 of 29\nlong time series from\
    \ remote sensing on cloudy days. Additionally, the simulated model accuracy and\n\
    subjective cognitive and empirical descriptions for the study area affect the\
    \ inversion results. Due to\nexisting problems, some recommendations or solutions\
    \ may provide references for SM estimations,\nas described below.\n6. Conclusions\
    \ and Perspective\nWith the problems pointed out above, this paper proposes our\
    \ recommendation and potential\nsolution in SM estimations.\n6.1. Combining Optical\
    \ and Microwave Remote Sensing to Estimate SM\nVisible and thermal infrared remote\
    \ sensing has ﬁne spatial resolutions and broad coverage.\nThe primary differences\
    \ between these methods are the use of the electromagnetic spectrum and\nthe source\
    \ of the electromagnetic energy [84]. Visible infrared remote sensing uses characteristic\n\
    changes in the soil reﬂectance or vegetation physiology to estimate SM. By contrast,\
    \ thermal infrared\nremote sensing uses the responses of soil thermal properties\
    \ to soil moisture to determine SM.\nUsing integration, the SM may be estimated\
    \ from soil thermal properties (soil temperature, thermal\ninertia, etc.) and\
    \ soil spectrum differences (absorption amplitude, spectrum combination, etc.).\n\
    In addition, microwave remote sensing is less disturbed by the bad weather or\
    \ rain. However,\nit can be easily perturbed by vegetation, and optical and thermal\
    \ remote sensing can be helpful for\nremoving vegetation disturbances. Therefore,\
    \ the combination of optical and thermal and microwave\nremote sensing may have\
    \ broad application prospects. Additionally, microwave remote sensing can\nobtain\
    \ data all-time and all-weather, which can provide great help for soil moisture\
    \ products over long\ntime series, especially in humid tropical regions.\nMoreover,\
    \ the combination of the thermal inertia method and the LST-NDVI space method\
    \ may\nprovide a robust method for estimating the SM. Thermal inertia is a soil\
    \ physical property with\nsoil moisture, and the LST-NDVI method can restrict\
    \ changes in soil moisture in a speciﬁc space.\nThis combination has a strong\
    \ physical basis, is easy to operate, and may be promising.\n6.2. The Development\
    \ of Comparable Soil Moisture Indices\nCurrently, many drought indices are based\
    \ on instantaneous remotely sensed data that cannot be\ncompared with other data\
    \ because of the inﬂuences of different atmospheric conditions. For visible\n\
    infrared remote sensing, long time-series remote sensing data are difﬁcult to\
    \ obtain and the reference\nstandards are not properly determined. For thermal\
    \ infrared remote sensing, the derived indices\ncan represent the drought conditions\
    \ of the study area for a speciﬁc time but cannot be compared\nwith each other\
    \ day by day. The driest and wettest points may not exist in the study area. Thus,\n\
    determining the dry and wet edge is somewhat subjective and results in errors\
    \ in the soil moisture\nestimations. For this problem, the normalization method\
    \ can be used to normalize the indices to\na uniform reference or statistical\
    \ data can be used to standardize the indices. Only the drought indices\nfrom\
    \ a uniform reference can be physically compared with each other and accurately\
    \ reﬂect the true\nsoil moisture conditions.\n6.3. The Measured Surface Data for\
    \ True Validation\nTrue validation is the process of assessing the uncertainty\
    \ of the data products derived\nindependently from the system outputs for the\
    \ same scale, time and location. Without validation,\nany methods, models, algorithms,\
    \ and parameters derived from remotely sensed data cannot be\nused with conﬁdence\
    \ [189,190]. True validation must be conducted because validation can help\nunderstand\
    \ the uncertainties of the remotely sensed data, the errors in soil moisture inversion\
    \ models\nand uncertainty in the retrieved land surface variables.\nCurrently,\
    \ the estimated soil moisture is mostly validated by point-based measurements.\n\
    The surface SWC data derived from remote sensing are only validated by one or\
    \ several points’\nSensors 2016, 16, 1308\n20 of 29\ndata measured using techniques.\
    \ The scale differences can induce large errors in soil moisture retrieval\noutputs\
    \ and methods. So, a surface to surface or pixel to pixel validation method should\
    \ be developed\nto deal with this problem.\n6.4. Improvements to the Soil Moisture\
    \ Estimation Theory\nThe physical principles of many SM estimation methods include\
    \ energy balance equations that\nserve as boundary conditions. According to previous\
    \ studies, the energy balance is not always closed.\nThus, it is relatively easy\
    \ to induce uncertainties. Moreover, the SM is an important link in the water\n\
    cycle and the water balance for a speciﬁc region should be considered. In addition,\
    \ the laws and\ntheories regarding soil hydrothermal characteristic can be combined\
    \ with remotely sensed parameters\nto reveal the interaction mechanisms of soil\
    \ moisture. To accurately estimate the SM, the energy and\nwater balance should\
    \ be considered as well as the soil hydrothermal properties.\nTherefore, several\
    \ limitations exist in the current use of optical and thermal remote sensing SM\n\
    estimation methods. These methods are based on polar-orbiting earth observation\
    \ satellite advances,\nand polar-orbiting satellites usually obtain three or four\
    \ ground observations each day. Lacking data\nsources limits the development of\
    \ soil moisture retrieval methods. Fortunately, the geostationary\nmeteorological\
    \ satellites can achieve high frequency and continuous ground observations and\
    \ high\ntemporal resolution data that polar-orbiting satellites cannot do. Geostationary\
    \ meteorological satellites\ncan provide favorable conditions and opportunities\
    \ for estimating surface soil moisture [191–203].\nAcknowledgments: This paper\

  explanation: The study applies Gaussian Process (GP) models to accurately estimate
    daily reference evapotranspiration (ET) values for efficient irrigation management.
    GP models are utilized to capture the relationship between weather parameters
    and reference ET at non-agricultural weather stations and compare them to established
    reference ET values from nearby agricultural weather stations. The study assesses
    the accuracy of these models and discusses the relevance of data quality, accuracy,
    and reliability for fully addressing the challenges associated with implementing
    real-time, automated irrigation systems.

    Get rights and content Highlights • Accurate estimates of daily ref. ET are needed
    for efficient irrigation management. • Climate data from non-ET stations can be
    used to fill ET for sparse ET-based network. • GP models performed better than
    OLS regression models for daily ref. ET estimates. Summary Accurate estimates
    of daily crop evapotranspiration (ET) are needed for efficient irrigation management,
    especially in arid and semi-arid regions where crop water demand exceeds rainfall.
    Daily grass or alfalfa reference ET values and crop coefficients are widely used
    to estimate crop water demand. Inaccurate reference ET estimates can hence have
    a tremendous impact on irrigation costs and the demands on U.S. freshwater resources,
    particularly within the Ogallala aquifer region. ET networks calculate reference
    ET using local meteorological data. With gaps in spatial coverage of existing
    networks and the agriculture-based Texas High Plains ET (TXHPET) network in jeopardy
    due to lack of funding, there is an immediate need for alternative sources capable
    of filling data gaps without high maintenance and field-based support costs. Non-agricultural
    weather stations located throughout the Texas High Plains are providing publicly
    accessible meteorological data. However, there are concerns that the data may
    not be suitable for estimating reference ET due to factors such as weather station
    siting, fetch requirements, data formats, parameters recorded, and quality control
    issues. The goal of the research reported in this paper is to assess the use of
    alternative data sources for reference ET computation. Towards this objective,
    we trained Gaussian process models, an instance of kernel-based machine learning
    algorithms, on data collected from weather stations to estimate reference ET values
    and augment the TXHPET database. Results show that Gaussian process models provide
    much greater accuracy than baseline least square regression models. Previous article

    High Plains ET network 1. Introduction Accurate estimates of daily crop evapotranspiration
    (ET) are valuable for irrigation management within arid, semi-arid, and semi-humid
    regions where crop water demand exceeds rainfall. Daily grass/alfalfa reference
    ET (ETo) values are widely used in conjunction with crop coefficients (Kc) to
    estimate crop water demand. Hence, the impact of inaccurate ET estimates can hardly
    be overstated given the increased demands on U.S. freshwater resources, especially
    within the central Great Plains underlain by the vast but declining Ogallala groundwater
    aquifer. Reference ET can be estimated using the FAO-56 (Allen et al., 1998) or
    the recent ASCE Standardized Reference ET Equation (Allen et al., 2005). Areal
    coverage of ET networks is not universal and there are significant gaps in the
    spatial coverage. It is further complicated by high spatial variation in air temperature,
    wind speed, wind direction and other weather parameters due to regional effects
    such as atmospheric circulation patterns (Buishand and Brandsma, 1997, Knapp,
    1992) and local effects such as topography (Goovaerts, 2000), land use (Li et
    al., 2010), elevation (Dodson and Marks, 1997) and soil properties (López-Granados
    et al., 2005). It is therefore difficult to use one predetermined weather station
    for determining daily reference ET for irrigation management over large regions.
    A sufficiently dense network of weather stations can effectively capture the spatial
    variability of parameters for use in computing reference ET. However, funding
    and staffing issues are ongoing concerns of many ET networks, making it difficult
    to expand coverage through additional weather stations. Although remote sensing
    based ET estimates are showing promise of expanding areal coverage and integration
    capabilities, accuracy of these methods is dependent on accuracy of input (i.e.,
    weather data and/or reference ET). There is hence an immediate need for exploring
    alternative data sources capable of filling data gaps without high maintenance
    and field-based support costs. Fortunately, there are other (non-agricultural,
    non-ET) weather stations and data networks, and some of these networks make data
    publicly accessible. However, there are concerns that the data may not be appropriate
    for estimating reference ET due to factors such as weather station siting, data
    formats, parameters recorded, and data quality control issues. Fig. 1 from an
    article by Porter et al. (2012) illustrates the sensitivity of average daily grass
    reference ET to changes in air temperature, dew temperature, wind speed and solar
    radiation by 1 °C, 1 °C, 1 m s−1 and 25 W m−2 respectively, using the representative
    Bushland ET station in the Texas High Plains. The authors reported that grass
    reference ET calculations were most sensitive to errors in wind speed and air
    temperature, and that sensitivity was greater during the mid-summer growing season
    when greater accuracy levels are required for irrigation scheduling. For example,
    a 1 °C error in air temperature throughout the growing season in the Texas High
    Plains would yield ≈25 mm error in the total grass reference ET for the typical
    corn growing season. The cumulative effect of this error over the irrigated corn
    acreage within the Texas High Plains is approximately equivalent to the total
    drinking water consumption by the City of Houston for about 22 days (Marek et
    al., 2010). Erroneous selection of reference weather station and/or wrong values
    of reference ET rates can thus affect the water use efficiency and producers’
    net profits, in addition to the loss of mined water of the Ogallala aquifer. This
    illustrative example demonstrates the need for accurate reference ET data for
    irrigation scheduling and irrigation management. Download : Download full-size

    temperature, dew point temperature, wind speed, and solar radiation by 1 °C, 1
    °C, 1 m/s, and 25 W/m2 respectively, using data from Bushland ET station in the
    Texas High Plains (Porter et al., 2012). Most statistical models reported in the
    literature on irrigation management are based on ordinary least square regression.
    Popular models used in regression include: (1) linear; ; (2) exponential; ; (3)
    power or logarithmic; ; and (4) a quadratic polynomial; . In these models, represents
    the desired output vector (e.g., reference ET values from ET stations) and is
    a vector representing input values such as rainfall, irrigation amount, weather
    parameters or reference ET estimated at non-agricultural weather stations. Values
    of coefficients (vectors with the same dimension as ) and c are tuned on training
    data such that the computed values of output are as close as possible to the given
    (i.e., known ground truth) output values. The ordinary least squares regression
    formulations tend to fix the basis functions before observing the training data,
    and the number of basis functions grows exponentially with the dimensions of input
    space. Furthermore, the basis functions are not adaptable to data and the associated
    curse of dimensionality makes a strong case for the use of more sophisticated
    models (Bishop, 2008). In recent years, numerous statistical learning algorithms
    are being developed and used for inference and prediction. Examples of such methods
    include artificial neural network (ANN) (ASCE Task Committee on Applications of
    Artificial Neural Networks in Hydrology, 2000a, ASCE Task Committee on Applications
    of Artificial Neural Networks in Hydrology, 2000b, Buscema and Sacco, 2000, DeRoach,
    1989, Hornik et al., 1989), support vector machine (Vapnik, 1995) and Gaussian
    Process (GP) models (Williams and Rasmussen, 1996). These methods provide substantial
    benefits over linear (or other) regression models. For instance, ANNs readily
    adapt to data and can be used to model complex functions between input and output
    parameters. Although different algorithms can be used to learn ANNs based on a
    compromise between computational cost and performance, the most popular choice
    is the back propagation algorithm (Rumelhart et al., 1986). However, ANN formulations
    can result in local minima, lead to over-fitting, and become computationally expensive
    in high-dimensional spaces. Further, it is also not easy to extract an understandable
    interpretation of the functions learned. Support vector machines (SVMs) have a
    simple geometric interpretation, avoid overfitting and find global solutions.
    They project input features to high dimensions, resulting in sparse representations
    and robust decision boundaries. However, SVMs (and other similar algorithms) require
    that the parametric function that models the relationship between inputs and outputs
    be defined in advance—choosing an appropriate function from the infinite space
    of functions may be difficult in complex problem domains. Gaussian process is
    a non-parametric kernel-based machine learning algorithm. GP models are well-suited
    for the estimation step of our study and they capture the temporal evolution of
    normally-distributed random variables that represent the patterns being tracked.
    They have been successfully used for large-scale estimation problems with high-dimensional
    features, e.g., nuclear disasters, climate modeling and sensor placement for surveillance
    (Higdon et al., 2003, Kennedy and O’Hagan, 2001, Krause et al., 2008). To the
    best of our knowledge, only a few applications of GP models have been found in
    the research field of water resources management, including ground water transport
    (Marrel et al., 2009) and hydrological modeling (Song et al., 2011). The objective
    of the study reported in this paper is to identify, evaluate and use alternative
    meteorological data sources for accurately computing reference ET values, resulting
    in efficient irrigation management and water resources planning. We trained GP
    models to estimate reference ET values using data from non-ET National Weather
    Service (NWS) stations. Although our study focused on the Texas High Plains, the
    experimental methodology can be used for estimating reference ET from non-agricultural
    and non-ET weather stations elsewhere in the U.S. and the world. An initial version
    of this study was reported in (Holman et al., 2013). The remainder of the paper
    is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the geographic locations included
    in our study, while Section 3 presents an overview of the various steps involved
    in the study. Next, Gaussian processes and the underlying mathematical concepts
    are described in Section 4. The experimental setup and results are discussed in
    Sections 5 Experimental setup, 6 Experimental results respectively, followed by
    the conclusions in Section 7. 2. Study area This study covers a 39-county area
    of the Texas High Plains, as shown in Fig. 2. Most of this region is semi-arid
    with highly variable precipitation (both temporally and spatially), averaging
    400–560 mm from west to east. Most rainfall occurs in scattered thunderstorms—some
    areas may receive 50–100 mm of daily precipitation while areas a short distance
    away may not receive any rainfall. In 2010, the Lubbock weather station recorded
    a total of 672 mm of annual rainfall, while in 2011 the station only recorded
    149 mm. This region is also known to have high evaporative demand (approximately
    2500 mm/year Class A pan evaporation) due to high solar radiation, high vapor
    pressure deficit (VPD), and strong regional advection. The grass reference ET
    data from 15 weather stations managed by the TXHPET network (Porter et al., 2005)
    (Fig. 1) were used to train and evaluate GP models that estimate reference ET
    values based on meteorological data from non-ET NWS stations. Download : Download

    data sources and evaluate whether they provide sufficient data parameters, detail
    and quality for use in computing daily reference ET; (2) determine whether missing
    data can be estimated using other available data, trends and associative models
    and calculate the daily reference ET; (3) assess and validate the quality of reference
    ET values determined from these data sources compared with valid ET network data
    sources; and (4) develop and evaluate models based on statistical learning methods
    to calculate reference ET given data from non-agricultural, non-ET weather stations
    or networks. In the remainder of the paper, we refer to non-agricultural, non-ET
    weather stations as “non-ET stations”. The first step involved a thorough assessment
    of all the weather networks in the Texas High Plains for estimating daily reference
    ET. Selection criteria include: (a) timely and real-time availability of data
    to the public at no cost; (b) length and continuity of historic records; (c) availability
    of measurements of parameters needed for estimating reference ET; and (d) ability
    to accurately estimate parameters that are missing or not measured. Once suitable
    non-ET stations were identified, a map showing the location of these stations
    was used to create a Thiessen polygon map, which (in turn) was used to pair these
    stations with selected agricultural weather stations of the TXHPET network (i.e.,
    the “ET stations”) for model development and evaluation. The weather parameters
    considered include: daily maximum and minimum air temperatures, average dew point
    temperature, average wind speed, average relative humidity, barometric measure
    and solar radiation. The second step involved computing missing data using equations
    provided in the 2005 Standardized reference ET methodology (Allen et al., 2005).
    For instance, if the solar radiation values were not measured or missing for a
    non-ET station, they were estimated using the complex method equation provided
    below: (1) where and are daily maximum and minimum air temperatures, is extraterrestrial
    radiation, is an empirical coefficient for semi-arid climates, and is solar radiation.
    Barometric pressure is calculated using the elevation of the corresponding weather
    station. If the missing data cannot be estimated (e.g. wind speed) for a given
    day, then the data records for that day were removed. After verifying the weather
    dataset and filling the missing data, unit conversions of the weather parameters
    were performed (as necessary) to estimate daily reference ET using the ASCE Standardized
    ET equation-based Bushland Reference ET Calculator (Gowda et al., 2012). In the
    third step, statistical relationships were computed between daily reference ET
    estimates obtained from the ET stations and the corresponding non-ET stations
    to assess feasibility of using alternative data sources to expand (or increase
    data intensity within) the coverage area of the Texas High Plains ET network.
    Coefficient of determination ( ), slope and intercept of the regression line,
    Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and root mean square error (RMSE) were used to
    compare the reference ET values obtained from the ET stations and those obtained
    from the corresponding non-ET stations. The value of describes the proportion
    of variability in the observed data that is explained by the model— ranges from
    0 to 1, with a higher value indicating a better goodness of fit (model explanation).
    For instance, with an intercept of 0 and slope of 1 indicates a perfect fit between
    the observed and modeled data. The NSE is a common efficiency measure that compares
    variance in estimations with the measured data variance. NSE ranges between— and
    1—values closer to 1 are more accurate and an NSE of 1 represents an optimal model.
    Negative NSE values indicate that the mean of the observations is more accurate
    than the model estimation. An RMSE of 0 also indicates a perfect fit—it is usually
    computed as a of the observed mean, e.g., RMSE < 50% is usually considered low.
    The RMSE measure is appropriate for our study because it provides values in the
    same units as the values that are to be estimated (i.e., reference ET). More information
    on performance statistics can be found in Moriasi et al. (2007). In the fourth
    step, the Gaussian process models were trained and evaluated. These models capture
    the relationship between the meteorological data from non-ET stations and the
    corresponding reference ET values from the ET stations. The trained models can
    then be used to estimate reference ET values given new data from the non-ET stations.
    For evaluating the estimation ability of GP models, the daily reference ET database
    was divided into two parts. Data corresponding to odd-numbered days of the year
    were used for model development and data from even-numbered days of the year were
    used for validation. Performance statistics ( , NSE and RMSE) were used to evaluate
    and compare the estimation capabilities of the GP models with (baseline) linear
    regression (LR) models. 4. Gaussian processes Gaussian processes are sophisticated
    supervised learning models used for regression (Williams and Rasmussen, 1996)
    and classification (Williams and Barber, 1998). Supervised learning approaches
    infer a hypothesis function based on training data. Training data consists of
    a set of N vectors consisting of inputs: and corresponding target outputs: , to
    generate input–output pairs: . The supervised learner uses the training data to
    learn a model that approximates h. To evaluate the learned model’s estimation
    ability, a testing dataset consisting of previously unseen inputs and target outputs
    is defined: . The learned model processes input vectors of the testing dataset
    to estimate outputs: , which are compared with ground truth (i.e., actual) target
    outputs. Various statistical error measures can hence be used to compute the accuracy
    of values estimated by the learned model. For non-linear regression problems,
    the unknown function exists in the infinite-dimensional space of possible functions
    for , making it difficult to decide the range of possible non-linear functions.
    Standard parametric models such as ANNs, linear regression and polynomial regression
    require that have an explicitly defined functional form whose parameters are defined
    in advance—the values of parameters are assigned by learning weights . Choosing
    this function from the infinite space of function types and weights can be a challenge.
    Gaussian processes address this issue by placing a prior over the space of functions.
    GP models thus do not need an explicit parametric definition of the function ,
    i.e., they are non-parametric. Instead, (stochastic) random variables define priors
    for each input vector. Random functions defined over the space of inputs constitute
    the GP prior, as shown in Fig. 3. During the training phase, the discrete set
    of inputs are used to modify these functions to pass as close as possible to the
    target outputs, thus approximating the (unknown) underlying function. Gaussian
    processes can be viewed as a natural generalization of a Gaussian distribution
    over a finite vector space to an infinite space of functions. Just as a Gaussian
    distribution is defined by its mean vector and covariance matrix, a GP is defined
    by its mean and covariance functions and : (2) where the function f is distributed
    as a Gaussian process with mean function and covariance function . In our research,
    we define the mean function as the zero function. The covariance function expresses
    the expected covariance of the values at each pair of points and . Given N input
    vectors in the training data, the covariance function is a covariance matrix .
    This matrix can be used to estimate output values for new inputs. In general,
    the estimated distribution is Gaussian with mean and covariance: (3) where is
    a new input vector, are the training data input vectors, denotes the matrix of
    covariances between the input and training data, K is the covariance matrix for
    training data, and . This algorithm has time complexity due to the matrix inversion
    in Eq. (3). GP formulations can hence become infeasible for data with a large
    number of samples. Algorithms are being developed to enable GP formulations of
    domains with large datasets (Bishop, 2008). However, our experiments consist of
    a few thousand training samples per weather station and the time complexity is
    (currently) not an issue. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Illustrative
    (general) example of a Gaussian process prior—three random functions that define
    outputs as a function of the inputs. GP models use the input values in the training
    data to incrementally revise these functions with the objective of minimizing
    the error in estimating the corresponding output values. Many different options
    exist for selecting covariance functions for a Gaussian process. The main requirement
    is that the function should generate a non-negative definite covariance matrix
    for any set of inputs . Graphically, the goal is to define covariances such that
    points that are nearby in the input space produce similar output estimates. In
    the research reported in this paper, we chose the popular radial basis function
    (RBF) kernels (Musavi et al., 1992): (4) The key advantage of using a non-parametric
    model such as GP is that it does not require any manual parameter tuning. Instead,
    the covariance function contains hyperparameters that are tuned automatically
    to maximize the likelihood of training data. Eq. (4) contains a single hyperparameter
    . Assigning different values to the hyperparameter results in different GP models.
    We randomly initialize a finite set of hyperparameters over the space of possible
    hyperparameter values and compute the estimation error of the corresponding GP
    models on the training data. This training error is computed by building a GP
    model using the training data, and comparing the output values estimated by the
    GP model for the training data inputs with the actual outputs included in the
    training data. The hyperparameter value that results in the lowest error, or equivalently
    the highest accuracy, is chosen for subsequent experimental studies. Section 5
    illustrates this approach to compute a suitable value for the hyperparameter.
    5. Experimental setup The experiments performed for this project were implemented
    using the WEKA open source machine-learning library (Hall et al., 2009). WEKA
    includes Java implementations of popular machine-learning algorithms such as GP,
    SVM, linear regression and multi-layer perceptron (ANN). The library also has
    evaluation schemes that can be used to compare performance of different algorithms
    over different datasets. We adapted the existing implementation of GP to fit our
    needs. Our application first reads in the training data and trains different GP
    models corresponding to different values of the hyperparameter ( ). As described
    in Section 4, is selected based on the GP model that results in the lowest RMSE
    between the estimated reference ET and actual TXHPET reference ET over the training
    data. This GP model is chosen for further use as it is the most accurate model.
    The RMSE statistic was used because it represents the actual difference in ET
    in mm. Fig. 4 illustrates this approach to compute the value of for the data obtained
    from the paired non-ET station and TXHPET station in Lubbock. A linear regression
    (LR) model was also learned from the same training data to serve as a baseline
    for comparison. The estimation accuracy of learned GP models was then compared
    with the estimation accuracy of LR models on separate test data for each non-ET
    station. For instance, Fig. 4 also shows that the GP models result in significantly
    lower RMSE in comparison with the LR models. It is also possible to automatically
    select the best value of by computing error measures over a separate validation
    set (Bishop, 2008). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. RMSE of GP models
    trained using data from the paired non-ET station and TXHPET station in Lubbock
    for different values of the hyperparameter ( ). GP model with lowest RMSE can
    be selected automatically from training data and used to estimate outputs for
    the test data. All GP models perform much better than LR models. To ensure accurate
    estimates from the learned models, the test data must be drawn from the same space
    as the training data, i.e., the probability distributions underlying the datasets
    must be equivalent. Consider the Lubbock datasets over the years 2001–2010, and
    consider the data division scheme that uses data from 2001 to 2005 as the training
    set and data correspond to years 2006–2010 as the test set. Such a data division
    scheme will not work because the wet and dry years are typically inconsistent—the
    models trained with data corresponding to dry years will result in high errors
    on data corresponding to wet years. We therefore split the data evenly across
    all years by using odd days for training and even days for testing. Although such
    a division of data into training set and testing set makes it difficult to run
    a standard cross-validation analysis, we repeated the experiments after swapping
    the training and test datasets. Overall, we conducted experimental trials using
    data from 15 non-ET (i.e., NWS) weather stations matched with the TXHPET stations
    determined by the Thiessen polygon (Fig. 2). We used data consisting of daily
    measurements over a period of 10 years. Experimental trials were divided into
    two groups based on the inputs used to train GP models. In the first set of experiments,
    reference ET values were computed from non-ET station weather parameters (see
    Section 3) and used as inputs to GP models—each input is thus a single value.
    The corresponding GP models capture the relationship between these reference ET
    values from non-ET stations and the corresponding reference ET values from the
    paired TXHPET station. In the second set of experiments, weather parameters from
    non-ET stations were used as inputs to the GP models—each input is thus a vector
    of weather parameter values. The target outputs were the TXHPET reference ET values.
    We hypothesized that GP models trained in the second set of experiments would
    provide more accurate estimates because they can model and account for the uncertainty
    in computing reference ET from the unreliable observations of weather parameters
    at non-ET stations. For each station, the GP model was trained using training
    data (half the values from the total number of years for each station) and various
    values for the hyperparameter . Once a suitable GP model is selected for further
    use (as described above), error statistics are computed using the reference ET
    estimates provided by this trained model over the test set and the actual reference
    ET values from the paired TXHPET station(s). Measures used for comparison include
    , NSE, and RMSE. 6. Experimental results Fig. 5 summarizes the estimation capabilities
    of the linear regression and Gaussian process models using the measure. Models
    that provide highly accurate estimates will result in points that lie on (or very
    close to) the line. Fig. 5(a) and (b) shows results (for Lubbock non-ET and TXHPET
    stations) with LR models and GP models (respectively) that used the reference
    ET computed from non-ET station as inputs. Similarly, Fig. 5(c) and (d) shows
    results with LR models and GP models (respectively) that used the weather parameters
    recorded at the non-ET station as inputs. We observed that the estimates were
    more accurate when the weather parameters were used as inputs instead of the reference
    ET computed at the non-ET stations. This observation was true for both LR and
    GP models, and similar plots were obtained for other stations included in the
    experimental trials. As hypothesized in Section 5, using the weather parameters
    as inputs enables the learned models to account for the uncertainty in observations
    of weather parameters at the non-ET stations. In other words, the models were
    able to capture the correlations in the data more accurately. The results reported
    below therefore correspond to experiments in which the weather parameter measurements
    at non-ET stations were used as inputs to train and test the models. Download

    and LR models for the two sets of experiments using Lubbock-NWS and Lubbock TXHPET
    data. Another key observation based on the results in Fig. 5 is that the GP models
    in Fig. 5(b) and (d) result in much greater accuracy than the corresponding LR
    models. Furthermore, the best performance (i.e., most accurate estimates) were
    obtained using GP models trained using the weather parameters as inputs, as shown
    in Fig. 5(d) where most points are along the diagonal line. Similar results were
    obtained using the data from other stations included in the study. Fig. 6 summarizes
    the results obtained on test data from 15 non-ET (NWS) weather stations, using
    RMSE as the performance measure. We observe that GP models provide much lower
    RMSE in comparison with the LR models. In other words, the reference ET values
    estimated by GP models are much closer to the reference ET values obtained from
    the corresponding TXHPET stations. This performance improvement is statistically
    significant and GP models show significant promise in enabling the use of alternative
    data sources for accurately computing reference ET values. Download : Download

    models, with the results averaged over data from each of the non-ET stations used
    in the study. The GP models result in much lower RMSE compared with LR models.
    Although the improvement in the accuracy of GP models (compared with the LR models)
    is different at different stations, the improvement is significant in all stations
    considered in our study. Stations such as Lubbock and Dalhart produced highly
    accurate estimates: and respectively and and , whereas matching the non-ET (NWS)
    station at Lubbock with the Farwell (TXHPET) station obtained and RMSE of  mm
    for daily reference ET values. This represents error which is still significantly
    better than the LR models that result in an RMSE of with a relative error of .
    Future research could consider additional features for input (e.g., elevation)
    and other GIS selection methods for matching non-ET stations with TXHPET stations.
    For instance, although our analysis identifies a good correlation between the
    Farwell TXHPET station and the Lubbock non-ET station based on the Thiessen polygon
    map, including additional features may help identify stations that are strongly
    correlated. The GP models provide more accurate estimates of reference ET than
    LR models, and this improvement in accuracy has significant practical value. The
    average difference in RMSE for daily reference ET estimates provided by GP and
    LR models is ⩾0.2 mm. For a typical cropping season of about 200 days, this amounts
    to approximately 40 mm or  in. over the season. Although this difference may seem
    rather small, one acre-inch of water for all the fields of the Texas High Plains
    results in approximately 24.8 billion gallons of wasted water (Marek et al., 2010),
    which can be compared to the amount of water supplied to the entire city of Houston
    for about two and a half months! Table 1 summarizes the performance of the LR
    models and GP models at each non-ET station included in our study, using the performance
    measures ( , NSE and RMSE) described in Section 3. With the GP models, each station’s
    and NSE values are closer to 1 with a lower RMSE. The results show that GP models
    provide higher accuracy in estimating reference ET than LR models. Table 1. Performance

    Efficient water resource management represents a pressing need in agriculture.
    Accurate estimates of crop evapotranspiration (ET) are essential for irrigation
    management, especially in arid and semi-arid regions where crop water demands
    exceed rainfall. Existing ET stations do not provide the required areal coverage
    and also face funding challenges. This paper presented the results of a study
    conducted towards our long-term goal of using data from non-ET stations for filling
    data gaps in the ET networks. In the context of data collected in the Texas High
    Plains, we described the use of Gaussian process models, an instance of sophisticated
    kernel-based machine learning, to estimate the daily reference ET values based
    on the corresponding data obtained from National Weather Service stations. Our
    experiments show that GP models result in significantly more accurate estimates
    of daily reference ET values than the (popular) linear regression models. We also
    observe that using the daily weather parameter measurements from the non-ET stations
    as inputs (instead of the reference ET computed from the these measurements) results
    in more accurate estimates. The improvement (provided by the GP models) in accurately
    estimating the daily reference ET values addresses a critical need and has significant
    practical value. Errors in reference ET estimates can translate to huge costs
    associated with wasteful use of precious water resources (due to over-watering),
    in addition to crop stress and even crop loss (due to under watering). Although
    our study focused on the Texas High Plains, the models and experimental methodology
    can be adapted to regions elsewhere in the world. Furthermore, Gaussian process
    models and other similar stochastic machine learning algorithms are generic tools
    for classification and regression in high-dimensional input spaces, with significant
    potential for addressing key open challenges in water resources management and
    other sub-fields of agriculture. USDA EEO disclaimer The U.S. Department of Agriculture

    a Creative Commons license open access Highlights • SLR is conducted using PRISMA
    approach and148 articles are selected and critically analyzed. • The results show
    the extent of digital technologies adoption in agriculture. • The potential benefits
    of digital technologies and roadblocks hindering their implementation in agriculture
    sector are identified and discussed. • The study will positively impact the research
    around agriculture 4.0. Abstract Agriculture is considered one of the most important
    sectors that play a strategic role in ensuring food security. However, with the
    increasing world''s population, agri-food demands are growing — posing the need
    to switch from traditional agricultural methods to smart agriculture practices,
    also known as agriculture 4.0. To fully benefit from the potential of agriculture
    4.0, it is significant to understand and address the problems and challenges associated
    with it. This study, therefore, aims to contribute to the development of agriculture
    4.0 by investigating the emerging trends of digital technologies in the agricultural
    industry. For this purpose, a systematic literature review based on Protocol of
    Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses is conducted
    to analyse the scientific literature related to crop farming published in the
    last decade. After applying the protocol, 148 papers were selected and the extent
    of digital technologies adoption in agriculture was examined in the context of
    service type, technology readiness level, and farm type. The results have shown
    that digital technologies such as autonomous robotic systems, internet of things,
    and machine learning are significantly explored and open-air farms are frequently
    considered in research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). Moreover,
    it is observed that most use cases are still in the prototypical phase. Finally,
    potential roadblocks to the digitization of the agriculture sector were identified
    and classified at technical and socio-economic levels. This comprehensive review
    results in providing useful information on the current status of digital technologies
    in agriculture along with prospective future opportunities. Previous article in

    problem Food security is a multidimensional concept that alleviates hunger by
    ensuring a sustainable, nutritious food supply. It is characterized by a four-pillar
    model shown in Fig. 1, with each pillar intrinsic to ensure food security [1].

    full-size image Fig. 2. Agriculture value chain: stages and main functions. Due
    to several anthropogenic factors, such as rapid population growth, urbanization,
    industrialization, farmland loss, freshwater scarcity, and environmental degradation,
    food security is becoming a serious global issue. This is because these factors
    are also directly impacting agricultural industry which is a primary source of
    agri-food production around the world. It is anticipated that by 2050 global population
    will be increased from the current 7.7 billion to 9.2 billion, urban population
    will be rise by 66%, arable land will be declined by approximately 50 million
    hectares, global GHG emissions (source of CO2 – promote crop disease and pest
    growth) will be increased by 50%, agri-food production will be declined by 20%,
    and eventually, food demand will be increased by 59 to 98% – posing an imminent
    threat to food security and adequate food availability [2], [3], [4]. To satisfy
    the increasing food demands, agricultural practitioners worldwide will need to
    maximise the agricultural productivity involving crop and livestock farming. In
    this review paper, the focus is on crop farming that involves cultivation of both
    food and cash crops. A typical agri-food value chain depicting three primary stages,
    namely pre-field (pre-plantation stage), in-field (plantation and harvesting stage),
    and post-field (post-harvesting stage) involved in the production of agricultural
    products is shown in Fig. 2. All the stages play a vital role in the value chain
    but, in this review, the second stage ˝in-field˝ will be considered that involves
    several crop growing processes such as plowing, sowing, spraying, and harvesting,
    etc. These processes currently employ traditional agricultural practices that
    are labor-intensive, require arable land, time, and a substantial amount of water
    (for irrigation) – making it a challenge to produce enough agri-food [5]. A part
    of problem is also related to irregular use of pesticides and herbicides and misuse
    of available technology which cause harm to crop and eventually resulting in agricultural
    wastes [6]. These issues can be addressed by integrating sophisticated technologies
    and computer-based applications that ensure high crop yield, less water consumption,
    optimised pesticide/herbicide utilization, and enhanced crop quality. This is
    where the smart agriculture concept comes in. 1.2. Smart agriculture Industry
    4.0, also known as the fourth industrial revolution, is revolutionizing, and reshaping
    every industry. It is a strategic initiative characterized by a fusion of emerging
    disruptive digital technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), big data and
    analytics (BDA), system integration (SI), cloud computing (CC), simulation, autonomous
    robotic systems (ARS), augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), wireless
    sensor networks (WSN), cyber-physical system (CPS), digital twin (DT), and additive
    manufacturing (AM) to enable the digitization of the industry [7]. The integration
    of these technologies in agriculture is sparking the next generation industrial
    agriculture, namely, agriculture 4.0 – also termed smart agriculture, smart farming,
    or digital farming [7]. Smart agriculture provides farmers with a diverse set
    of tools (shown in Fig. 3) to address several agricultural food production challenges
    associated with farm productivity, environmental impact, food security, crop losses,
    and sustainability. For instance, with IoT-enabled systems consisting of WSNs,
    farmers can connect to farms remotely irrespective of place and time to monitor
    and control farm operations. Drones equipped with hyperspectral cameras can be
    used to collect data from heterogeneous sources on farmlands and autonomous robots
    can be used to support or accomplish repetitive tasks at farms. Data analytics
    techniques can be employed to analyze the gathered data with computer applications
    can be used to assist farmers in decision-making process. Likewise, a wide variety
    of parameters related to environmental factors, weed control, crop production
    status, water management, soil conditions, irrigation scheduling, herbicides,
    and pesticides, and controlled environment agriculture can be monitored and analyzed
    in smart agriculture to increase crop yields, minimize costs, enhance product
    quality, and maintain process inputs through the use of modern systems [8]. Download

    The concept of “Smart Agriculture”. 1.3. Research motivation and contribution
    The motivation for preparing this review stems from the fact that digital technologies
    in agricultural systems offer new strategic solutions for enhancing the efficiency
    and effectiveness of farms’ production. Moreover, digital transformation provides
    a way forward to implement modern farming practices such as vertical farming (hydroponics,
    aquaponics and aeroponics), which has the potential to overcome food security
    problems. But there is a set of problems and limitations associated with this
    transformation from the technical, socio-economic, and management standpoint that
    must be death to fully exploit the potential of agriculture 4.0 [9]. There are
    number of studies that have discussed emerging trends in the development of agriculture
    4.0 by providing succinct information on key applications, advantages, and corresponding
    research challenges of smart farming [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15],
    [16], [17], [18]. The research focus of these studies is limited to either explaining
    more generic technical aspects while paying attention to only one or few digital
    technologies, and/or enhancing agricultural supply chain performance, and/or developing
    agriculture 4.0 definition, and/or achieving sustainable agronomy through precision
    agriculture, and/or proposing a smart farming framework. Nevertheless, these studies
    do not involve explicit discussion on the tools and techniques used to develop
    different systems and maturity level of these systems. There is also a lack of
    studies considering modern soilless farms such as hydroponics, aquaponics and
    aeroponics (indoor/outdoor) and implications of digital technologies in these
    farms. Hence, it is necessary to analyse the evolution of agriculture 4.0 from
    different perspectives to stimulate the discussion in the area. This study aims
    to present a holistic overview of digital technologies implemented in second stage
    of agricultural production value chain (in-field) for different types of farms
    as mentioned in section 1.1. The main theoretical contribution of the study involves
    analysis and dissemination of the tools and techniques employed, the farm type,
    the maturity level of the developed systems, along with potential roadblocks or
    inhibiting factors in development of agriculture 4.0. The reflections presented
    in the review will support researchers and agricultural practitioner in future
    research on agriculture 4.0. 1.4. Paper organization Following the introduction,
    the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the approach used to gather
    the relevant literature; then, Section 3 presents the statistical results obtained
    after a general analysis of the selected research studies; next, Section 4 provides
    a detailed overview of the core technologies used in the digitization of agriculture;
    after, Section 5 highlights the technical and socio-economic roadblocks to digital
    integration in agriculture; next, Section 6 outlines a discussion about the research
    questions followed by added value, considerations and future prospects related
    to agricultural digitization, and transition to agriculture 5.0; and lastly, Section
    8 concludes the review. 2. Research methodology A systematic literature review
    (SLR) is a tool used to manage the diverse knowledge and identify research related
    to a predetermined topic [19]. In this study, SLR is conducted to investigate
    the status of Industry 4.0 technologies in agricultural industry. Particularly,
    cases are searched where the term ‘agriculture’ appeared concurrently in the title,
    abstract, or keywords of an article with any of the ‘Industry 4.0 technologies”
    mentioned in section 1.2. Before conducting the SLR, a review protocol is defined
    to ensure a transparent and high-quality research process, which are the characteristics
    that make a literature review systematic [20]. The review protocol also helps
    to minimize bias by conducting exhaustive literature searches. This includes three
    steps: the formulation of the research questions, the definition of the search
    strategy, and the specification of inclusion and exclusion criteria. This paper
    uses a preferred reporting item for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA)
    approach to conduct SLR. PRISMA is an evidence-based minimum set of items that
    are used to guide the development process of systematic literature reviews and
    other meta-analyses [19]. 2.1. Review protocol A review protocol (in Table 1)
    is defined before conducting the bibliographic analysis to identify, evaluate,
    and interpret results relevant to the research scope. First, research questions
    are formulated to provide insight into the analysis of published studies in the
    research area of interest from different dimensions. These questions need to be
    answered in the study. Next, the search strategy is defined, which helps identify
    appropriate keywords later in the search equation to identify the relevant information
    sources, such as academic databases and search engines that provide access to
    a massive amount of digital documentation. Three online research repositories
    are used to retrieve relevant studies: ScienceDirect1, Scopus2, and IEEE Xplore3.
    Finally, to refine the search results of each database, boundaries are set by
    predefining inclusion and exclusion criteria for further investigation and content
    assessments of selected publications. It involves, for instance, defining the
    time interval for the research process from 2011 to 2021 to limit the studies
    to those published in English, disregarding chapters of books and grey literature,
    such as reports and summaries of events and seminars. These last two steps of
    the review protocol allow the preliminary filtering of metadata sources and narrow
    down the scope of research. Table 1. Review protocol for systematic literature
    review. Review questions RQ1: Which Industry 4.0 technologies have been used in
    the literature for digitization of agriculture? RQ2: How and to what extent have
    these technologies been applied in the context of service type, tools and techniques

    search process is done in four stages: identification, screening, eligibility,
    and inclusion, as detailed by the PRISMA flow diagram shown in Fig. 4. After initial
    metadata filtering through the application of search expression, a total of 3165
    records are found (1690 from Scopus, 926 from ScienceDirect, and 549 from IEEE
    Xplore), which are then consolidated for the removal of duplicate items in the
    identification stage. The number of publications after this step is reduced to
    2876. In the screening stage, the titles and abstracts of the papers are analyzed,
    and only 498 papers are selected for integral reading. In the third stage, full-text
    screening of these articles is performed to verify their eligibility in relation
    to the objective of this paper, which is to answer the research questions mentioned
    in Table 1. Of the 498 papers, 137 are found to be relevant for this review. Another
    11 are added through a cross-referencing approach, adding up to 148 papers selected
    in the final stage for further analysis. Download : Download high-res image (624KB)

    search process (PRISMA). 2.3. Threats to validity i SLR replication: The presented
    SLR is susceptible to threats to validity because the current search is limited
    to only three online repositories. More publications could potentially be found
    if additional sources were explored. The process of SLR is described clearly in
    sub-sections 2.1 and 2.2, and hence, validity can be considered well addressed.
    However, in the case of replication of this SLR, it is possible that one can find
    slightly different publications. This difference would result from different personal
    choices during the screening and eligibility steps of PRISMA, but it is highly
    unlikely that the overall findings would change. ii Search string: the search
    string used to find the relevant studies cover the whole scope of SLR, but there
    is a possibility that valuable studies might have been missed. Additional keywords

    trends in agriculture The year-wise distribution of the 148 articles from 2011
    to 2021 is represented in Fig. 5. Around 22% of the scientific publications in
    the last ten years were published in 2018. This reflects that the agricultural
    industry is making considerable progress in the context of the implementation
    of digital technologies, but the pace is still slow as compared to other domains
    such as healthcare, manufacturing, mining, automotive, energy, etc.,[15]. Download

    of the 148 selected research studies. The farm type refers to the crop farming
    method considered while developing an application or framework. For instance,
    the farming method can be soil-based or soilless. The soil-based farming category
    involves open-air fields (traditional outdoor agricultural farms) and greenhouse
    farms (indoor). On the other hand, the soilless farming category involves modern
    farming practices such as aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics (mostly indoor).
    The numbers at the top of the stacked column in Fig. 6 indicate the total number
    of studies that have used the particular technology to develop a smart agriculture
    system, whereas different colors of columns indicate the respective farm types.
    Use cases are from these publications are analysed, and conclusions are drawn.
    For instance, it is found that autonomous robotics systems (including unmanned
    guided vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (drones)), internet of things, and
    machine learning appear to be the widely applied technologies in the agricultural
    domain in the last decade. The same illustration suggests that big data, wireless
    sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins are the emerging areas
    in agriculture. Moreover, open-air farms are the most frequently considered in
    research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). For soilless farming systems
    (aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics), only 22 publications are found, which
    insinuates that these modern farming practices are still in their infancy. Likewise,
    services of each use case are identified and are classified under nine different
    service categories, namely: i) crop management, CM (Estimation/ prediction of
    crop yield/ growth rate/ harvesting period and seed plantation/ harvesting/ pollination/
    spraying (fertilizer/ pesticide)); ii) crop quality management, CQM (fresh weight,
    green biomass, height, length, width, leaf density, piment content (chlorophyll)
    and phytochemical composition); iii) water and environment management, WEM (monitoring
    and control of flow rate, water level, water quality (nutrients), temperature,
    humidity, CO2, and weather forecast etc.); iv) irrigation management, IM (water
    stress detection and scheduling); v) farm management, FM (monitoring of farm operations,
    tracking and counting products, determining production efficiency, financial analysis,
    energy consumption analysis, technology integration and decisions implementation);
    vi) pest and disease management, PDM (pest identification and disease detection);
    vii) soil management, SM (moisture content, soil nutrients, fertilizer needs and
    application); viii) weed and unwanted vegetation management, WUVM (weed/unknown
    vegetation mapping, classification, and herbicides application); and ix) fruit
    detection and counting, FDC — as shown in Fig. 7. These categories illustrate
    the role of different digital technologies in smart farming. Upon analysis, it
    is found that crop management parameters, such as crop yield prediction, growth
    rate estimation, or evaluation of harvesting period are the most frequently researched
    areas for agriculture 4.0 in the last decade (29%), whereas very little heed is
    paid towards soil management (2%), fruit detection and counting (2%), and crop
    quality management (3%). Download : Download high-res image (561KB) Download :

    three generic levels [21]. The first level is conceptual, that represents European
    TRL 1–2 (use case is in conceptual phase), the second level is the prototype,
    which means European TRL 3–6 (use case is working even without the complete planned
    functionality), and the third level is deployed, that includes European TRL 7–9
    (use case is mature with all the possible functions). Fig. 8 depicts the TRL of
    each use case developed in selected studies. It is observed that little progress
    has been made in advancing smart agricultural systems beyond the concept and prototype
    levels to the commercial level. For instance, most use cases (129) are at the
    prototype level. Download : Download high-res image (269KB) Download : Download

    provides critical insights towards answering RQ1 and RQ2 from Table 1. 4.1. Internet
    of Things driven agricultural systems Internet of things (IoT) refers to a cosmos
    of interrelated computing devices, sensors, appliances, and machines connected
    with the internet, each having unique identities and capabilities for performing
    remote sensing and monitoring [21]. The reference architecture of IoT with six
    layers, namely perception layer (hardware devices), network layer (communication),
    middleware layer (device management and interoperability), service layer (cloud
    computing), application layer (data integration and analytics), and end-user layer
    (user-interface), is shown in Fig.9. In the agricultural domain, IoT devices in
    the physical layer gather data related to environmental and crop parameters such
    as temperature, humidity, pH value, water level, leaf color, fresh leaf weight,
    etc. The transmission of this data takes place in the network layer, the design
    of which depends on the selection of suitable communication technologies relevant
    to the field size, farm location, and type of farming method. For instance, ZigBee,
    LoRa, and Sigfox are widely used and employed in outdoor fields because they are
    cheaper and have low energy consumption and a good transmission range [22,23].
    Despite being a secure technology, Bluetooth is only used in indoor farms as it
    offers a short transmission range [22]. Wi-Fi is not a promising technology for
    agricultural applications due to its high costs and high energy consumption [22].
    RFID (radio frequency identification) and NFC (near field communication) technologies,
    on the other hand, are increasingly being implemented in agricultural systems
    for tracking agricultural products [24]. GPRS or mobile communication technology
    (2G, 3G, and 4G) are used for periodic monitoring of environmental and soil parameters.
    In addition, communication protocols mostly used in the agricultural scenarios
    are HTTP, WWW, and SMTP. Likewise, to ensure interoperability and system security
    to their context-aware functionalities, middleware HYDRA and SMEPP are mostly
    employed in agricultural systems [25]. To store data, cloud computing techniques
    are employed in the service layer. This data is then used in the application layer
    to build smart applications used by farmers, agriculture experts, and supply chain
    professionals to enhance farm monitoring capacity and productivity. Download :

    architecture of Internet of Things (IoT), (adapted) [26]. The integration of IoT
    in agriculture is meant to empower farmers with the decision tools and automation
    technologies that seamlessly integrate knowledge, products, and services to achieve
    high productivity, quality, and profit. A multitude of studies is performed and
    put forward concerning the incubation of the IoT concepts in the agricultural
    sector. The main findings of some of the studies are presented in Table 2. Multiple
    technological issues and architectural problems have been addressed through the
    development of IoT-based agricultural systems. But most of these systems are either
    in a conceptual stage or in a prototype form (not commercial) at the moment. Focus
    is mainly laid on-farm management, irrigation control, crop growth, health monitoring,
    and disease detection. Some of these studies have also explained IoT implementation
    in modern agricultural systems such as vertical farming (soilless farming - aquaponics,
    hydroponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). Moreover, most
    studies have focused on addressing a specific problem. Table 2. IoT-driven agricultural

    networks in agriculture Wireless sensor network (WSN) is regarded as a technology
    that is used within an IoT system. It can be defined as a group of spatially distributed
    sensors for monitoring the physical conditions of the environment, temporarily
    storing the collected data, and transmitting the gathered information at a central
    location [22]. The general architecture of WSN is shown in Fig. 10. A WSN for
    smart farming is made up of numerous sensor nodes connected through a wireless
    connection module. These nodes have a variety of abilities (e.g., processing,
    transmission, and sensation) that allow them to self-organize, self-configure,
    and self-diagnose. There are different types of WSNs, which are categorized depending
    on the environment where they are deployed. These include terrestrial wireless
    sensor networks (TWSNs), wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs), underwater
    wireless sensor networks (UWSNs), wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs),
    and mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs) [55]. In agricultural applications,
    TWSN and UWSN are widely used. In TWSNs, the nodes are deployed above the ground
    surface, consisting of sensors for gathering the surrounding data. The second
    variant of WSNs is its underground counterpart – WUSNs, where sensor nodes are
    planted inside the soil. In this setting, lower frequencies easily penetrate through
    the soil, whereas higher frequencies suffer severe attenuation [56]. Therefore,
    the network requires a higher number of nodes to cover a large area because of
    the limited communication radius. Many research articles are available in the
    literature that discusses the use of WSN for different outdoor and indoor farms’
    applications such as irrigation management, water quality assessment, and environmental
    monitoring. A summary of some of these articles is given in Table 3. These studies
    have focused on developing WSNs architectures that are simplified, low cost, energy-efficient
    and scalable. Yet, various factors associated with WSNs need further attention,
    such as minimum maintenance, robust and fault-tolerant architecture, and interoperability.

    [66] 4.3. Cloud computing in agriculture According to the National Institute of
    Standard and Technologies (NIST), cloud computing (CC) is defined as a model for
    enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of
    configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications,
    and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management
    effort or service provider interaction [67]. The main architecture of CC shown
    in Fig. 11 is comprised of four layers: datacenter (hardware), infrastructure,
    platform, and application [68]. Each of these layers is linked with specific cloud
    service models, which are classified as software as a service (SaaS), platform
    as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Cloud computing has
    gained great attention over the past decade in the agriculture sector because
    it provides: 1) inexpensive storage services for data gathered from different
    domains through WSNs and other preconfigured IoT devices, 2) large-scale computing
    systems to perform intelligent decision-making by transforming this raw data into
    useful knowledge, and 3) a secure platform to develop agricultural IoT applications
    [69]. In combination with IoT and WSN, CC is employed to develop different agricultural
    applications, most of which are presented in Tables 2 and 3. CC technology is
    also used to create operational farm management systems (FMSs) to support farmers
    and farm managers in efficient monitoring of farm operations Table 4. presents
    the salient features of some of these FMSs. Another topic of interest that is
    being explored in global research is related to the traceability of agri-product
    quality [70]. But only preliminary research has been attempted to explore traceability
    compliance with standards of food safety and quality. Download : Download high-res

    systems have the potential to solve problems of increasing food demands, environmental
    pollution caused by excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers, and the safety
    of agricultural products. These FMSs, however, do not have the capability to support
    run-time customization in relation to distinct requirements of farmers. Moreover,
    because most farm data is usually fragmented and dispersed, it is difficult to
    record farm activities properly in current FMSs applications [75]. 4.4. Edge/fog
    computing in agriculture The rapid development of IoT has led to the explosive
    growth of sensors and smart devices, generating large volumes of data. The processing
    and analysis of such an enormous amount of data in real-time are challenging because
    it increases the load on the cloud server and also reduces the response speed.
    Simply using a cloud server is not able to provide real-time response while handling
    such a large data set. Additionally, IoT applications are sensitive to network
    latency because they require a constant exchange of information between devices
    and the cloud, making CC unfeasible to handle these applications [23]. The emergence
    of the edge computing concept can resolve the problems associated with CC. This
    new computing model deploys computing and storage resources (such as cloudlets
    or fog nodes) at the edge of the network closer to data sources such as mobile
    devices or sensors. This way, it can facilitate real-time analytics while keeping
    data secure on the device [23]. Edge computing offers intriguing possibilities
    for smart agriculture, but the applications of this technology are only in their
    infancy in agricultural systems. Hence, few research studies are available in
    this area; see Table 5. Most of the edge computing-based agricultural systems
    discussed in these studies are prototypical and address a limited selection of
    problems in various agricultural domains. So far, interoperability and scalability
    issues have not received sufficient consideration. Table 5. Edge computing-based

    robot systems in agriculture Autonomous robot systems (ARS) are intelligent machines
    capable of performing tasks, making decisions, and acting in real-time, with a
    high degree of autonomy (without external influence or without explicit human
    intervention) [83]. Interest in agricultural ARS (AARS) has grown significantly
    in recent years because of their ability to automate some practices in outdoor
    and indoor farms - including seeding, watering, fertilizing, spraying, plant monitoring
    and phenotyping, environmental monitoring, disease detection, weed and pest controlling,
    and harvesting [15]. The agricultural robots use a combination of emerging technologies
    such as computer vision, WSNs, satellite navigation systems (GPS), AI, CC, and
    IoT, thereby facilitating the farmers to enhance productivity and quality of agricultural
    products. AARS in smart farming can be mobile AARS, which can move throughout
    the working field, or fixed AARS [84]. Mobile AARSs are further classified into
    unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and 2) unnamed aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are
    explained in the following sections. 4.5.1. Unmanned ground vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are agricultural robots that operate on the ground
    without a human operator. The main components of UGVs generally include; a platform
    for locomotive apparatus and manipulator, sensors for navigation, a supervisory
    control system, an interface for the control system, the communication links for
    information exchange between devices, and a system architecture for integration
    between hardware and software agents [85]. The control architecture of UGV can
    be remote-operated (controlled by a human operator via the interface) or fully
    autonomous (operated without the need for a human controller based on artificial
    intelligence technologies) [85]. Likewise, locomotive systems can be based on
    wheels, tracks, or legs [85]. Despite high ground adaptability, intrinsic omnidirectionality
    and soil protection of legged robots, they are uncommon in agriculture. However,
    when combined with wheels (wheel-legged robots), these robots offer a disruptive
    locomotion system for smart farms. In addition to their needed characteristics
    for infield operations, UGV should fulfill certain requirements such as small
    size, maneuverability, resilience, efficiency, human-friendly interface, and safety
    – to enhance crop yields and farm productivity. Table 6 summarizes the diverse
    range of UGVs designed for agricultural operations. Table 6. Different types of

    above have a 4WD locomotive system because it offers ease of construction and
    control. The drawback of 4WD is that the wheels are strongly affected by terrains
    containing stone elements and/or cavities [85]. Hence, it is significant to explore
    other mechanisms, such as legged or wheel-legged locomotive systems. Some robots
    have computer vision systems, but due to the difficulty of developing an accurate
    and reliable system that replaces manual labor, most of these robots are built
    with a low-cost computer vision system, that is, using conventional RGB cameras.
    Moreover, most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase,
    with no commercial use on a large scale. 4.5.2. Unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or aerial robots are aircrafts with no human pilot
    on board. Depending on the type of technology incorporated to fly (wing structure)
    and autonomy level, there is a wide variety of UAVs [96]. For instance, according
    to wing type, UAVs can be fixed-wing (planes), single-rotor (helicopter), hybrid
    system (vertical takeoff and landing), and multirotor (drone). Among these, drones
    (multi-rotor technology) which are lifted and propelled by four (quadrotor) or
    six (hex-rotor) rotors, have become increasingly popular in the agriculture sector
    due to their mechanical simplicity in comparison to helicopters, which rely on
    a much more sophisticated plate control mechanism [97]. Similarly, according to
    autonomy level, UAVs can be either teleoperated in which the pilot provides references
    to each actuator of the aircraft so as to control it, in the same manner, an onboard
    pilot would, or tele-commanded in which the aircraft relies on an automatic controller
    on board that is in charge of maintaining a stable flight [96]. Equipped with
    the appropriate sensors (vision, infrared, multispectral, and hyperspectral cameras,
    etc.), agricultural UAVs allow farmers to obtain data (vegetation, leaf area,
    and reflectance indexes) from their fields to study dynamic changes in crops that
    cannot be detected by scouting the ground [98]. This data permits farmers to infer
    information related to crop diseases, nutrient deficiencies, water level, and
    other crop growth parameters. With this information, farmers can plan possible
    remedies (irrigation, fertilization, weed control, etc.). Table 7 reviews some
    of the UAV-based systems used for different agricultural operations. Table 7.

    Most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase, with no commercial
    use on a large scale. Other problems with these UAVs are associated with battery
    and flight time [96]. At the moment, lithium-ion batteries are being used because
    their capacity is larger than that of conventional batteries. But an increase
    in battery capacity increases the drone weight, and now research is undergoing
    to address this issue. In addition, the existing UAVs have complex user interfaces,
    and only experts can use them to perform agricultural tasks. By improving the
    user interface making it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow people
    who are older or unfamiliar with UAV technology to control it more easily. 4.6.
    Big data and analytics in agriculture Rapid developments in IoT and CC technologies
    have increased the magnitude of data immeasurably. This data, also referred to
    as Big Data (BD), includes textual content (i.e., structured, semi-structured,
    and unstructured), and multimedia content (e.g., videos, images, audio) [119].
    The process of examining this data to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations,
    market trends, customer preferences, and other useful information is referred
    to as big data analytics (BDA). Big data is typically characterized according
    to five dimensions defined by five Vs, which are displayed in Fig. 12 [120]. The
    paradigm of BD-driven smart agriculture is comparatively new, but the trend of
    this application is positive as it has the capacity to bring a revolutionary change
    in the food supply chain and food security through increased production. Agricultural
    big data is usually generated from various sectors and stages in agriculture,
    which can be collected either from agricultural fields through ground sensors,
    aerial vehicles, and ground vehicles using special cameras and sensors; from governmental
    bodies in the form of reports and regulations; from private organizations through
    online web services; from farmers in the form of knowledge through surveys; or
    from social media [120]. The data can be environmental (weather, climate, moisture
    level, etc.), biological (plant disease), or geo-spatial depending on the agricultural
    domain and differs in volume, velocity, and formats [121]. The gathered data is
    stored in a computer database and processed by computer algorithms for analyzing
    seed characteristics, weather patterns, soil properties (like pH or nutrient content),
    marketing and trade management, consumers’ behavior, and inventory management.
    A variety of techniques and tools are employed to analyze big data in agriculture.
    A summary of some of the studies is given in Table 8. Machine learning, cloud-based
    platforms, and modeling and simulation are the most commonly used techniques.
    Particularly, machine learning tools are used in prediction, clustering, and classification
    problems. Whereas cloud platforms are used for large-scale data storing, preprocessing,
    and visualization. There are still many potential areas that are not adequately
    covered in existing literature, where BDA can be applied to address various agricultural
    issues. For instance, these include data-intensive greenhouses and indoor vertical
    farming systems, quality control and health monitoring of crops in outdoor and
    indoor farms, genetic engineering, decision support platforms to assist farmers
    in the design of indoor vertical farms, and scientific models for policymakers
    to assist them in decision-making regarding the sustainability of the physical
    ecosystem. Lastly, most systems are still in the prototypical stage. Download

    [125] 4.7. Artificial intelligence in agriculture Artificial intelligence (AI)
    involves the development of theory and computer systems capable of performing
    tasks requiring human intelligence, such as sensorial perception and decision-making
    [126]. Combined with CC, IoT, and big data, AI, particularly in the facet of machine
    learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), is regarded as one of the key drivers behind
    the digitization of agriculture. These technologies have the potential to enhance
    crop production and improve real-time monitoring, harvesting, processing, and
    marketing [127]. Several intelligent agricultural systems are developed that use
    ML and DL algorithms to determine various parameters like weed detection, yield
    prediction, or disease identification. These systems are discussed in the next
    two sub-sections. 4.7.1. Machine learning in agriculture Machine learning (ML)
    techniques are broadly classified into three categories: 1) supervised learning
    (linear regression, regression trees, non-linear regression, Bayesian linear regression,
    polynomial regression, and support vector regression), 2) unsupervised learning
    (k-means clustering, hierarchal clustering, anomaly detection, neural networks
    (NN), principal component analysis, independent component analysis, a-priori algorithm
    and singular value decomposition (SVD)); and 3) reinforcement learning (Markov
    decision process (MDP) and Q learning) [128]. ML techniques and algorithms are
    implemented in the agriculture sector for crop yield prediction, disease, and
    weed detection, weather prediction (rainfall), soil properties estimation (type,
    moisture content, pH, temperature, etc.), water management, determination of the
    optimal amount of fertilizer, and livestock production and management [129] Table
    9. presents a list of publications where different ML algorithms are utilized
    for various agricultural applications. From the analysis of these articles, “crop
    yield prediction” is a widely explored area, and linear regression, neural network
    (NN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) is the most used ML
    techniques to enable smart farming. The presented use cases are still in the research
    phase with no reported commercial usage at the moment. Moreover, it is also found
    that AI and ML techniques are sparsely explored in the greenhouse and indoor vertical
    farming systems, particularly hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. There are
    only a few publications available summarized in the same table where ML techniques
    are employed. Considering the digital transformation''s cyber-security and data
    privacy challenges, new approaches such as federated learning and privacy-preserving
    methods are being developed to enable digital farming [130]. These approaches
    build ML models from local parameters without sharing private data samples, thus
    mitigating security issues. Table 9. Machine learning-based agricultural systems.

    Prototype [148] 4.7.2. Deep learning in agriculture Deep learning (DL) represents
    the extension of classical ML that can solve complex problems (predictions and
    classification) particularly well and fast because more “depth” (complexity) is
    added into the model. The primary advantage of DL is feature learning which involves
    automatic extraction of features (high-level information) from large datasets
    [149]. Different DL algorithms are convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long
    short term memory (LSTM) networks, recurrent neural (RNN) networks, generative
    adversarial networks (GANs), radial basis function networks (RBFNs), multilayer
    perceptron (MLPs), feedforward artificial neural network (ANN), self-organizing
    maps (SOMs), deep belief networks (DBNs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs),
    and autoencoders. A detailed description of these algorithms, popular architectures,
    and training platforms is available at various sources [150]. Fig. 13 illustrates
    an example of DL architecture of CNN [151]. In the agriculture sector, DL algorithms
    are mostly used to solve problems associated with computer vision applications
    that target the prediction of key parameters, such as crop yields, soil moisture
    content, weather conditions, and crop growth conditions; the detection of diseases,
    pests, and weed; and the identification of leaf or plant species [152]. Computer
    vision is an interdisciplinary field that has been gaining huge amounts of traction
    in recent years due to the surge in CNNs. It offers methods and techniques that
    allow the processing of digital images accurately and enables computers to interpret
    and understand the visual world [153]. A summary of agricultural applications
    using DL and computer vision techniques is given in Table 10. Among all the DL
    algorithms, CNNs or Convet and its variants are the most used algorithms in agricultural
    applications. The variants of CNN are region-based CNNs (RCNN), Fast-RCNN, Faster-RCNN,
    YOLO, and Mask-RCNN, among which the first four are mostly used to solve object
    detection problems. Mask-RCNN, on the other hand, is used to solve instance segmentation
    problems. The reader could refer to the existing bibliography for a detailed description
    of these algorithms and their applications [152]. Few studies have also used other
    DL techniques. Talking about datasets, most DL models are trained using images,
    and few models are trained using sensor data gathered from fields. This shows
    that DL can be applied to a wide variety of datasets. It is also observed that
    most of the work is done on outdoor farms, whereas next-generation farms (environment-controlled)
    are not extensively explored. Though DL has the potential to enable digital farming,
    most systems are still in the prototype phase. Additionally, the new challenges
    imposed by cyber-security and privacy issues require optimization of current DL
    and computer vision approaches. Download : Download high-res image (334KB) Download

    decision support systems A decision support system (DSS) can be defined as a smart
    system that supports decision-making to specific demands and problems by providing
    operational answers to stakeholders and potential users based on useful information
    extracted from raw data, documents, personal knowledge, and/or models [170]. DSS
    can be data-driven, model-driven, communication-driven, document-driven, and knowledge-driven.
    The salient features of these DSSs are available at following source [171]. Fig.
    14 presents the general architecture of a DSS, consisting of four fundamental
    components, each having its specific purpose. Download : Download high-res image

    (adapted) [187]. Due to the evolution of agriculture 4.0, the amount of farming
    data has increased immensely. To transfer this heterogenous data into practical
    knowledge, platforms like agricultural decision support systems (ADSS) are required
    to make evidence-based and precise decisions regarding farm operation and facility
    layout [172]. Over the past few years, ADSSs are gaining much attention in the
    agriculture sector. A number of ADSSs have been developed that focus on a variety
    of agricultural aspects, such as farm management, water management, and environmental
    management. Table 11 presents a summary of the ADSSs found in the literature.
    From this analysis, most ADSSs have been found to not consider expert knowledge,
    which is highly valuable as it allows to development of systems as per user''s
    needs. The other reported issues with some of these ADDSs are complex GUIs, inadequate
    re-planning components, a lack of prediction and forecast abilities, and a lack
    of ability to adapt to uncertain and dynamic factors. It is also worth noting
    that all the ADSSs are for outdoor agricultural systems and are in the research
    phase. In comparison, the application of ADSS in indoor soilless farming is still
    very much unexploited. Table 11. Agricultural decision support systems. Use case

    As one of the main technologies of Industry 4.0, a cyber-physical system (CPS)
    refers to an automated distributed system that integrates physical processes with
    communication networks and computing infrastructures [184]. There are three standard
    CPS reference architecture models: namely, 5C, RAMI 4.0, and IIRA, and their detailed
    description is available at following source [185]. Among these, the 5C is a well-known
    reference model with widespread usage. The architecture of 5C consists of five
    levels which are represented in Fig. 15. CPS benefits from a variety of existing
    technologies such as agent systems, IoT, CC, augmented reality, big data, and
    ML [186]. Its implementation ensures scalability, adaptability, autonomy, reliability,
    resilience, safety, and security improvements. Download : Download high-res image
    (461KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 16. Schematic of a digital twinning
    process, (adapted) [199]. Agricultural field is regarded as one of the complex
    domains that can benefit from CPS technology. Agricultural cyber-physical systems
    (ACPSs) use advanced electronic technologies and agricultural facilities to build
    integrated farm management systems that interact with the physical environment
    to maintain an optimal growth environment for crops [188]. ACPSs collect the essential
    and appropriate data about climate, soil, and crops, with high accuracy and use
    it to manage watering, humidity, and plant health, etc. A variety of ACPSs has
    been developed for the management of different services, and their summary is
    given in Table 12. Looking at these ACPSs, most systems are still at the prototype
    and conceptual level. Moreover, most studies are conducted for outdoor farms,
    with only a few works published related to soil-based greenhouse systems. No study
    is found that is relevant to indoor soilless farming systems. ACPSs has attracted
    significant research interest because of their promising applications across different
    domains; deploying CPS models in real-life applications is still a challenge as
    it requires proper hardware and software [189]. Moreover, particular attention
    should be given to autonomy, robustness, and resilience while engineering ACPSs
    in order to handle the unpredictability of the environment and the uncertainty
    of the characteristics of agricultural facilities. There are multiple factors
    (humans, sensors, robots, crops, and data, among others) that impact ACPSs. To
    ensure a smooth operation while avoiding conflicts, errors, and disruptions, ACPSs
    need to be designed carefully and comprehensively. Table 12. Agricultural cyber-physical

    in agriculture Digital twin (DT) is a dynamic virtual replica of a real-life (physical)
    object of which it mirrors its behaviors and states over multiple stages of object''s
    lifecycle by using real-world data, simulation, and machine learning models, combined
    with data analytics to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning [198]. A
    complete description of the DT concept for any physical system requires consolidation
    and formalization of various characteristics, including the physical and virtual
    entities, the physical and virtual environments, the metrology, and realization
    modules that perform the physical to virtual and the virtual to physical connection
    or twinning, the twinning and twinning rate, and the physical and virtual processes
    [199]. The schematic showing the mapping of these characteristics is shown in
    Fig. 16. The DT concept has gained prominence due to the advances in the technologies
    such as the Internet of Things, big data, wireless sensor networks, and cloud
    computing. This is because these technologies allow real-time monitoring of physical
    twins at high spatial resolutions through both miniature devices and remote sensing
    that produce ever-increasing data streams [21]. The concept of DT in agricultural
    applications is rather immature as compared to other disciplines with its first
    references occurred in 2017; hence its added value has not yet been discussed
    extensively [21]. This is because framing is a highly complex and dynamic domain
    because of its dependence on natural conditions (climate, soil, humidity) and
    presence of living physical twins (plants and animals) and non-living physical
    twins (indoor farm buildings, grow beds, outdoor agricultural fields, agricultural
    machinery). The non-living physical twins interact directly or indirectly with
    plants and animals (living physical twins), thereby introducing more challenges
    for DT in agriculture. Whereas in other domains such as manufacturing DTs are
    mostly concerned with non-living physical twins. Table 13 summarises the agricultural
    DTs developed in the last 10 years. Table 13. Digital twins in agriculture Use

    have focused on open-air farming systems. Only one study is found that has proposed
    DT for soil-based vertical farming system and one study that implemented DT for
    soilless farming system (aquaponics). This might be because the design and management
    of modern farming systems are challenging. Moreover, most DTs are in the research
    phase with no commercial deployment at the moment. The reported benefits of the
    DT applications in agriculture are cost reductions, catastrophe prevention, clearer
    decision making, and efficient management operations, which can be applied to
    several agricultural subfields like plant and animal breeding, aquaponics, vertical
    farming, cropping systems, and livestock farming. While DT technology has great
    potential, achieving the synchronization between the physical entity and its digital
    counterpart is challenging. The complexity of this process is further amplified
    in agricultural systems due to the idiosyncrasies of living physical twins. Hence,
    implementation of agricultural DT should start with micro-farms, which can then
    be gradually enhanced to an intelligent and autonomous version by incorporating
    more components. 4.11. Roadblocks in digitization of agriculture industry This
    section provides an answer to RQ3 by listing a series of interconnected roadblocks
    hampering a larger adoption of digital technologies in the agriculture sector.
    After analysing 148 articles, 21 roadblocks are identified which can be categorized
    at technical and socio-economic levels. 4.12. Technical roadblocks • Interoperability:
    data is considered a cornerstone for the success of smart systems. Agricultural
    data usually comes from multiple heterogeneous sources such as thousands of individual
    farmlands, animal factories, and enterprise applications. This data can have diverse
    formats, making data integration complex. Hence, data interoperability is essential
    to enhance the value of this massively dispersed data after systematic data collection,
    storage, processing, and knowledge mining [208]. Likewise, for establishing effective
    communication between heterogeneous devices, they need to be interconnected and
    interoperable. With cross-technology communication, interoperability of the system
    can be improved [209]. • Standardization: to fully exploit the digital technologies
    for smart farming applications, standardization of the devices is essential. Output
    differences can occur because of misinterpretation and alterations from time to
    time. With standardization, the interoperability issues of the devices, applications,
    and systems can also be resolved [25]. • Dataquality: to produce meaningful results,
    data quality is also crucial along with data security, storage, and openness.
    The lack of decentralized data management systems is another roadblock hindering
    the adoption of smart farming practices [9]. This issue decreases the willingness
    of multiple actors to share agriculture data. • Hardwareimplementation: the deployment
    of a smart agricultural setup in large-scale open fields is extremely challenging.
    This is because all the hardware consisting of IoT devices, wireless sensor networks,
    sensor nodes, machinery, and equipment directly exposed to harsh environmental
    conditions such as heavy rainfall, high/low-temperature levels, extreme humidity,
    strong wind speeds and many other possible dangers which can destroy electronic
    circuits or disrupt their normal functionality [210]. A possible solution is to
    build an adequate casing for all the costly devices that is robust and durable
    enough to endure real field conditions [211]. • Adequatepower sources: typically,
    the wireless devices deployed at farms consistently operate for a long time and
    have limited battery life. A suitable energy saving scheme is necessary because,
    in case of any failure, instant battery replacement is complicated, especially
    in open-air farms where devices are strategically placed with minimum access [210].
    The possible solutions to optimize energy consumption are usage of low power sensors
    and, proper management of communication [24,212]. Wireless power transfer and
    self-supporting wireless system are other promising solutions to eliminate the
    need for battery replacement by recharging the batteries through electromagnetic
    waves. However, long-distance wireless charging is needed in most agricultural
    applications [9]. Ambient energy harvesting from rivers, fluid flow, movement
    of vehicles and, ground surface using sensor nodes offers another viable solution,
    but the converted electrical energy is limited at present – posing the need to
    improve power conversion efficiency [213]. • Reliability: The reliability of devices,
    as well as corresponding software applications, is crucial. This is because IoT
    devices need to gather and transfer the data based on which decisions are made
    using several software packages. Unreliable sensing, processing, and transmission
    can cause false monitoring data reports, long delays, and even data loss – eventually
    impacting the performance of agricultural system [25]. • Adaptability: agricultural
    environments are complex, dynamic, and rapidly changing. Hence, when designing
    a system, it is pertinent for the devices and applications to proactively adapt
    with the other entities under uncertain and dynamic factors - offering the needed
    performance [214]. • Robust wirelessarchitectures: wireless networks and communication
    technologies offer several benefits in terms of low cost, wide-area coverage,
    adequate networking flexibility, and high scalability. But dynamic agriculture
    environments such as temperature variations, living objects’ movements, and the
    presence of obstacles pose severe challenges to reliable wireless communication.
    For instance, fluctuations in the signal intensity occur due to the multipath
    propagation effects – causing unstable connectivity and inadequate data transmission
    [215]. These factors impact the performance of the agricultural system. Hence,
    there is a need for robust and fault-tolerant wireless architectures with appropriate
    location of sensor nodes, antenna height, network topology, and communication
    protocols that also require minimum maintenance [11]. • Interference: another
    challenge is wireless interference and degradation of the quality of service because
    of the dense deployment of IoT devices and wireless sensor networks. These issues
    can be mitigated with efficient channel scheduling between heterogeneous sensing
    devices, cognitive radio-assisted WSNs, and emerging networking primitives such
    as concurrent transmission [216]. Since agriculture devices are distributed at
    indoor greenhouses, outdoor farmlands, underground areas, or even water areas,
    cross-media communication between underground, underwater, and air is also required
    for the complete incorporation of smart technologies [217]. • Security and privacy:
    the distributed nature of smart agricultural systems brings potential vulnerabilities
    to cyber-attacks such as eavesdropping, data integrity, denial-of-service attacks,
    or other types of disruptions that may risk privacy, integrity, and availability
    of the system [218]. Cyber-security is a major challenge that needs to be addressed
    within the context of smart farming, with diverse privacy-preserving mechanisms
    and federated learning approaches [130]. • Compatibility: to achieve the standards
    of fragmentation and scalability, the models or software applications developed
    should be flexible and run on any machine installed in the agricultural system
    [13]. • Resource optimization: farmers require a resource optimization process
    to estimate the optimal number of IoT devices and gateways, cloud storage size,
    and amount of transmitted data to improve farm profitability. Since farms have
    different sizes and need distinct types of sensors to measure different variables,
    resource optimization is challenging [219]. Secondly, most of the farm management
    systems do not offer run-time customization in relation to the distinct requirements
    of farmers. Hence, complex mathematical models and algorithms are required to
    estimate adequate resource allocation [75]. • Scalability: the number of devices,
    machinery, and sensors installed at farms is increasing gradually due to advancements
    in technologies. To support these entities, gateways, network applications, and
    back-end databases should be reliable and scalable [220]. • Human-centereduserinterfaces:
    complex user interfaces of existing agricultural applications and devices are
    impeding smart farming practices. Most GUI is designed in a way that only experts
    can use to perform agricultural tasks. Improving the user interface by making
    it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow a larger group of people
    to use it to perform different agricultural operations [96]. 4.13. Socio-economic
    roadblocks • Gap between farmers and researchers: the participation of farmers
    is a key factor toward the success of the digitization of the agricultural industry.
    Farmers face a lot of problems during the agri-food production process, which
    smart technologies could fix, but agricultural experts are not usually aware of
    these issues [16]. Moreover, to devise an adequate smart solution, first, it is
    important to fully understand the nature of problems. Hence, it is essential to
    bridge the gap between farmers, agricultural professionals, and AI researchers.
    • Costs associated with smart systems: the costs associated with the adoption
    of smart technologies and systems are the major deterrent in the digitization
    of the agricultural sector. These costs usually involve deployment, operating,
    and maintenance costs. The deployment costs of smart systems are usually very
    high as they involve; i) hardware installation such as autonomous robots and drones,
    WSNs, gateways, and base station infrastructure, etc., to perform certain farm
    operations, and ii) hiring the skilled labour [221]. Likewise, to facilitate data
    processing, management of IoT devices and equipment, and knowledge exchange, subscription
    of centralized networks and software packages is required, which ultimately increases
    the operating costs [222]. Though sometimes service providers offer free subscription
    packages with restricted features, the amount of storage capacity is limited.
    To ensure the adequate operations of the smart system, occasional maintenance
    is required, which then also adds up to total costs. Other types of costs associated
    with smart systems deployment could be environmental, ethical, and social costs.
    To overcome cost related roadblocks, initiatives focusing on cooperative farming
    are needed that provide; i) support services for better handling of costs and
    needed investments, and ii) hardware solutions to transform conventional equipment
    into smart farm-ready machinery to reduce high initial costs [222]. • Digital
    division: another factor that is slowing the digitization of the agricultural
    sector is the lack of knowledge of digital technologies and their applications.
    The majority of farmers have no idea about the significance of digital technologies,
    how to implement and use them, and which technology is suitable for their farm
    and meets their requirements [14]. Hence, it is essential to educate farmers about
    modern farming technologies and systems. Moreover, different strategies are needed
    to build tools using natural language that farmers with low education levels can
    easily understand [223]. • Return on investment: in agriculture, the profit margin
    is very important like other sectors. When it comes to the implementation of advanced
    technologies, farmers have concerns related to the time to recover the investment
    and to the difficulties in evaluating the advantages [12]. • Trust building: unlike
    in other disciplines, building trust regarding the effectiveness of smart technologies
    in agriculture is difficult because many decisions affect systems that involve
    living and non-living entities, and consequences can be hard to reverse [16].
    Additionally, insufficient proof of the impact of digital tools on-farm productivity
    further intensifies the current challenges. • Laws and regulations: different
    regions and countries have different legal frameworks which impact the implementation
    of digital technologies in the agriculture sector, particularly in monitoring
    and agri-food supply [70]. Likewise, regulations related to resource allocation
    (spectrum for wireless devices), data privacy, and security also vary from one
    country to another [70]. • Connectivity infrastructure: most less-developed countries
    usually have insufficient connectivity infrastructure that limits access to advanced
    digital tools that would help to turn data from heterogenous sources into valuable
    and actionable insights [10]. 4.14. Discussion This section discusses the main
    conclusions of RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3. In addition, added value, considerations, and
    future directions are also presented to ensure higher accuracy and great advancements
    in agricultural industry. 4.15. RQ1, RQ2 and RQ3 The present study tried to articulate
    the emerging digital technologies being implemented in agricultural industry to
    anticipate the future trajectories of agriculture 4.0. By looking at Table 2,
    Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8, Table 9, Table 10, Table
    11, Table 12, Table 13 in section 4, it can be seen some technologies such as
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins are not significantly explored in agriculture. A reason for this
    gap could be that implementing advanced technologies with more complex operations
    can be expensive, at least in the early experimental phase of their adoption.
    Hence, the development of these technologies in agricultural industry should increase
    in the coming years. The results of SLR also show that IoT is significantly implemented
    in farms. This is due to the broad functionality of IoT such as in the monitoring,
    tracking and tracing, agriculture machinery, and precision agriculture [21]. It
    can be said that IoT is one of the main research objectives within the agriculture
    4.0 approaches. Nevertheless, only few studies have considered data security and
    reliability, scalability, and interoperability while developing an intelligent
    agricultural system. The research findings also demonstrated that most use cases
    are still in the prototype phase. The possible reason could be because most agricultural
    operations have to do with living subjects, like animals and plants or perishable
    products, and developing systems is harder than non-living human-made systems.
    Another reason might be that agriculture is a slow adopter of technology because
    of transdisciplinary nature of this field, and hence to develop intelligent systems,
    the agricultural community must become familiar will all the digital technologies.
    Lastly, variations in plant/crops’ species, and growth conditions also make digitization
    of agricultural systems complex [188]. The SLR findings also show that most of
    the systems are developed for open-air soil-based farms contrary to indoor farms
    (soilless and soil-based). This is due to complex design and management of indoor
    farms particularly soilless farms where parameters and factors (pH, air temperature,
    humidity, etc.) to be controlled are diverse [5]. But with introduction of digital
    technologies and data-driven computer applications in indoor farms, a more robust
    control of the process can be achieved. Furthermore, it is also revealed from
    SLR that limited research is conducted in three (soil management, fruit detection
    and counting and crop quality management) out of nine different service categories
    mentioned in section 3. This corroborates that substantial research and development
    is needed in some areas to ensure successful digitization of agriculture industry
    in developed countries as well as in developing countries. The complexity of agriculture
    ecosystem presents a series of interconnected roadblocks that hinder the full
    integration of digital technologies for agriculture 4.0 realization. Hence, it
    is essential to identify potential roadblocks in order to come up with strategic
    solutions to overcome them. This study is an attempt to explore what these roadblocks
    are. Based on analysis, 21 roadblocks were identified and classified at technical
    and socio-economic levels. These roadblocks are listed in section 5, which suggests
    what needs to be done for digitization of agricultural industry on larger scale.
    But it is still not known, to what extent elimination or mitigation of these roadblocks
    assist in successful integration of digital technologies. 4.16. Added value of
    agricultural digitization Based on analysis, several benefits that can motivate
    framers and other actors to support digitization of agricultural industry are
    identified and summarised below. The presented benefits have potential to maximise
    the farm''s productivity and enhance product quality, but they should not be considered
    a panacea for challenges associated with smart agriculture [222]. • Improved agility:
    digital technologies improve the agility of farm operations. Through real-time
    surveillance and forecast systems, farmers or agricultural experts can rapidly
    react to any potential fluctuations in environmental and water conditions to save
    crops [221]. • Green process: digital technologies make the farming process more
    environmentally friendly and climate-resilient by significantly reducing the usage
    of in-field fuel, nitrogen fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides [224]. • Resource
    use efficiency: digital platforms can improve resource use efficiency by enhancing
    the quantity and quality of agricultural output and limiting the usage of water,
    energy, fertilizers, and pesticides [3]. • Time and cost savings: digital technologies
    enable significant time and cost savings by automating different operations, such
    as harvesting, sowing, or irrigation, controlling the application of fertilizers
    or pesticides, and scheduling the irrigation [225]. • Asset management: digital
    technologies allow real-time surveillance of farm properties and equipment to
    prevent theft, expedite component replacement and perform routine maintenance
    [10]. • Product safety: digital technologies ensure adequate farm productivity
    and guarantee a safe and nutritious supply of agri-food products by preventing
    fraud related to adulteration, counterfeit, and artificial enhancement [218].
    4.17. Considerations and future prospects The upcoming initiatives would result
    in significant improvements in the agricultural sector. But in order to make things
    sustainable for small and medium-scale growers, roadblocks mentioned in section
    5 need to be addressed first. Awareness campaigns highlighting the significance
    of smart agriculture at every level of the agricultural value chain and promoting
    innovative ways (such as gamification) to encourage stakeholders to take on an
    active role in the digital revolution can mitigate some of the mentioned roadblocks
    [9]. Government level initiatives, grants and endowments, public-private partnerships,
    the openness of data, and regional basis research work can also assist in coping
    with potential roadblocks. Lastly, a roadmap can be adopted while developing a
    smart agriculture system, starting from basic architecture with few components
    and simpler functionality, gradually adding components and functionality to develop
    a complex system with the full potential of digitization [21]. These considerations
    can pave the way for successful implementation of agriculture 4.0. The future
    prospects of digital technologies in smart agriculture involve using explainable
    artificial intelligence to monitor crop growth, estimate crop biomass, evaluate
    crop health, and control pests and diseases. Explainable AI fades away the traditional
    black-box concept of machine learning and enables understanding the reasons behind
    any specific decision [15]. Description of big data through common semantics and
    ontologies and the adoption of open standards have great potential to boost research
    and development towards smart farming . Similarly, to ensure enhanced connectivity
    and live streaming of crop data, 5G technology need to be extensively explored
    [6]. 5G technology will minimize internet costs and augment the overall user experience
    of farm management and food safety by performing accurate crop inspections remotely
    [226]. Furthermore, it will significantly bridge the gap between stakeholders
    by keeping them well informed on produce availability. Lastly, blockchain in combination
    with IoT and other technologies can be implemented to address the challenges related
    to data privacy and security [227]. 4.18. Transition to Agriculture 5.0 The industrial
    revolutions have always brought a breakthrough in the agricultural sector. As
    formally discussed in previous sections, agriculture 4.0 has great potential to
    counterbalance the growing food demands and prepare for future by reinforcing
    agricultural systems with WSN, IoT, AI, etc. While the realization of agriculture
    4.0 is still underway, there is already a talk about agriculture 5.0. Agriculture
    5.0 extends agriculture 4.0 with inclusion of industry 5.0 principles to produce
    healthy and affordable food while ensuring to prevent degradation of the ecosystems
    on which life depends [228]. The European Commission formally called for the Fifth
    Industrial Revolution (industry 5.0) in 2021 after observing that industry 4.0
    focuses less on the original principles of social fairness and sustainability
    but more on digitalization and AI-driven technologies for increasing the efficiency
    and flexibility [229]. Industry 5.0 complements and extends industry 4.0 concept
    to recognize the human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience [230]. It involves
    refining the collaborative interactions between humans and machines, reducing
    environmental impact through circular economy, and developing high degree of robustness
    in systems to achieve optimal balance between efficiency and productivity. The
    enabling technologies of industry 5.0 are Cobots (collaborative robots), smart
    materials with embedded bio-inspired sensors, digital twins, AI, energy efficient
    and secure data management, renewable energy sources, etc [229].. In agriculture
    5.0 settings, farm''s production efficiency and crop quality can be enhanced by
    assigning repetitive and monotonous tasks to the machines and the tasks which
    need critical thinking to the humans. For this purpose, similar to manufacturing
    sector cyber physical cognitive systems (CPCS) that observe/study the environment
    and take actions accordingly should be developed for agricultural sector. This
    may include collaborative farm robots which will work in the fields and assist
    crop producers in tedious tasks such as seed sowing and harvesting etc. Likewise,
    digital twins in agriculture 5.0 can also offer significant value by identifying
    technical issues in agricultural systems and overcoming them at a faster speed,
    detecting crop diseases, and making crop yield predictions at a higher accuracy
    rate. This shows that agriculture 5.0 has potential to pave a way for climate
    smart, sustainable and resilient agriculture but as of now, it is in the developing
    phase. 5. Conclusions Increased concerns about global food security have accelerated
    the need for next-generation industrial farms and intensive production methods
    in agriculture. At the forefront of this modern agricultural era, digital technologies
    offered by Industry 4.0 initiative are suggesting a myriad of creative solutions.
    The scientific community and researchers integrate disruptive technologies in
    conventional agriculture systems to increase crop yields, minimize costs, reduce
    wastes, and maintain process inputs. An SLR discussing the prevailing state of
    these technologies in the agriculture sector is presented in this study. After
    applying SLR protocol, 148 articles were considered from the time frame of the
    year 2011 to 2021. Various research questions pertaining to i) current and continuing
    research trends, ii) functionality, maturity level, farm type and tools and techniques
    used, iii) primary roadblocks, and iv) added value of digital technologies; were
    put forward and answered. Several conclusions are drawn such as integration of
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins in agriculture is only in its infancy, and most use cases are in
    the prototype phase. Likewise, 21 roadblocks are identified and classified at
    technical and socioeconomic levels. To ensure the digitization of agricultural
    industry, these roadblocks must be analyzed and overcome. The added value of digital
    technologies in agriculture industry are also identified and presented in the
    study. Overall, this study contributes to the research being carried around agriculture
    4.0. The primary limitation of this review is twofold: firstly, only three online
    repositories are considered for literature search (Scopus, IEEE and Science Direct),
    and secondly additional keywords and synonyms might return more studies. In both
    scenarios, it is highly unlikely that the overall findings would change. For the
    future work, additional research databases and aspects can be considered to provide
    holistic overview of agricultural industry in terms of digitization. Moreover,
    studies targeting agriculture 5.0 in general will also be included. Declaration

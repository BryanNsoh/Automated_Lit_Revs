  explanation: The proposed system aims to overcome the data standardization and harmonization
    issues experienced by end-users, empowering them to create data analytic processes
    using self-service visual data analytic tools, and to do so, it provides a table-oriented
    structure view of IoT entities’ data in the current state and their history over

    as well as making it freely available to the community."'

  key_findings: '1) The proposed middleware provides a uniform mechanism for authentication
    and control access management, enabling users to be unaware of each context broker
    they use.


    2) The experiment demonstrated that end-users could easily consume data from an
    IoT ecosystem on-demand and autonomously without requiring the support of specialised
    IT teams, contrasting with related works in terms of work productivity and agility.


    3) This is an important feature in several use cases, such as smart industrial
    or agricultural.'
  limitations: 'The proposed system does not implement any mechanism of caching, as
    well as little concern for code optimization was taken into account. Thus, the
    real performance evaluation is out of the scope of the present work.


    Regarding security and access control, the applied security model was shown to
    be effective. The proposed system enabled users to consume IoT data of four distinct
    tenants in four distinct systems and versions of NGSI: Orion/ QuantumLeap, Orion
    LD/QuantumLeap, Scorpio and Stellio. We should notice that by using our system,
    the IoT ecosystem can be locked from the outside world. Only the endpoint discussed
    in Section 5.2 is available from the corporative network or the Internet. However,
    other scenarios involving public and corporate communities, as well as monetised
    approaches, will require more sophisticated security models.


    In the present security model, the data granularity access control is defined
    at the tenant level, thus granting access to all entities in a tenant. A more
    granular access control at the entity level is required. Each user should have
    access only to a set of entities of one or more tenants.'
  main_objective: The primary goal of the study is to provide a lightweight connector
    for data analytic tools and IoT ecosystems based on NGSI-v2/NGSI-LD/NGSI-TSDB.
    The proposed system provides web services based on JSON and CSV formats that those
    tools use without applying complex transformations in the data.
  relevance_evaluation: This paper is very relevant to the outline point because it
    specifically addresses the issue of data standardization and harmonization, which
    is a major challenge in enabling end-users to develop data analytic processes
    in NGSI-based ecosystems using self-service visual data analytic tools. The proposed
    system provides a solution to this problem by offering a table-oriented structure
    view of IoT entities’ data, which makes it much easier for end-users to consume
    and analyze the data.

    Water Things architecture for data standarization based on blockchain and digital
    twin technology. Journal of Advanced Research, xxx, xxx.
  explanation: 'The paper presents an innovative Industrial Internet of Water Things
    (IIoWT) architecture for data standardization and security improvements. It utilizes
    blockchain technology and digital twins to enhance the accuracy and reliability
    of data sharing among different water management nodes. The proposed CNN-LSTM
    and Blockchain Transactional Data (BCTD) schemes address data modality and security
    concerns, ensuring data validity and transparency.


    The key points of the paper are summarized as follows:


    1. The proposed IIoWT architecture employs a cross-platform runtime environment
    based on Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) to seamlessly process diverse
    data sources. This design facilitates interoperability and efficient data execution
    across heterogeneous computing nodes.


    2. The integration of blockchain technology into the architecture empowers the
    system with a secure and transparent framework for data management. The utilization
    of SHA-256 for data hashing, along with a proof-of-work mechanism, ensures data
    validity across different nodes in the IIoWT network.


    3. To address the challenge of data standardization, the paper presents a hybrid
    model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory
    (LSTM) networks (CNN-LSTM). This model effectively extracts and processes data
    from various sources, handling the issue of data modality.


    4. The paper highlights the limitations of existing blockchain schemes, such as
    proof of credibility, Byzantine fault-tolerant, and hash validation schemes, which
    often consume excessive resources and support only homogeneous nodes in distributed
    networks. The proposed BCTD scheme utilizes a lightweight blockchain approach
    that is more suitable for the resource-constrained nature of IIoWT nodes.


    5. The study leverages digital twin technology to create virtual replicas of physical
    water management assets. This virtualization enables real-time monitoring, analysis,
    and simulations, leading to improved decision-making, predictive maintenance,
    and optimization of water management processes.


    6. The combination of CNN and LSTM algorithms enables efficient feature extraction
    and sequencing of data dependencies within the IIoWT architecture. Physical servers
    are primarily responsible for data processing at the power plant, while virtual
    servers handle data management at various monitoring institutions. End-user computing
    interfaces solely receive validated data for drinking water quality monitoring
    in homes and institutions.


    7. The proposed architecture employs a hierarchical data validation approach.
    At the initial stage, data is encrypted using SHA-256, and then, blockchain technology
    is utilized to generate hash values for each data block. In the final stage, a
    proof-of-work mechanism is implemented to validate the legitimacy of each transaction.


    8. The paper emphasizes the need for standardized data formats and harmonization
    to facilitate seamless integration and interoperability among different water
    management systems. This standardization effort aims to improve data quality,
    enhance data sharing, and promote collaboration among stakeholders.


    9. The performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed IIoWT architecture
    outperforms existing water management architectures in terms of raw data processing,
    data modality processing, and data sharing accuracy. The integration of CNN-LSTM
    and BCTD schemes further enhances the accuracy of data standardization and sharing,
    achieving close to 99% accuracy.


    10. The study acknowledges limitations in the proposed IIoWT architecture, including
    the lack of consideration for component failure rates in large-scale setups and
    the absence of motor energy and power consumption analysis for computing nodes.
    These limitations provide avenues for future research and improvement.


    11. While the study utilizes existing Amazon industrial IoT water management simulator
    and incorporates digital twin and blockchain technologies, the source code is
    publicly available for further development and customization.


    12. The paper''s findings have significant implications for advancing the field
    of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems. The proposed
    IIoWT architecture, combined with CNN-LSTM and BCTD schemes, establishes a robust
    and reliable framework for data standardization, interoperability, and security
    in water management systems.'

  explanation: This study assesses the sustainability of shale gas exploitation in
    China, the United Kingdom, and the United States by integrating major sustainability
    parameters through a meta-analysis of environmental trade-off assessments, life
    cycle assessments, and reports. The results demonstrate higher environmental tradeoffs
    in China than the United States during shale gas exploitation but reveal that
    China maintains a relatively high social demand trend, especially under a balanced
    scenario. The analysis suggests that China has the potential to promote shale
    gas production for energy security while improving the environmental impact of
    its shale gas industry and continuously increasing natural gas imports for stable
    economic development.
  extract_1: While shale gas could complement the world's natural gas supply, its
    environmental tradeoffs and sustainability potential should be cautiously assessed
    before using it to satisfy future energy needs.
  extract_2: Although China has relatively low scores in the environmental aspect,
    large reservoirs and high future market demand make Chinese shale gas favorable
    in the social demand aspect.

  explanation: 'The Monitoring and Control Framework (MCF) is an architecture for
    IoT projects that provides a conceptual structure for their design and implementation.
    It aims to address common challenges in IoT systems such as scalability, interoperability,
    and security. The MCF is composed of three main subsystems: the monitoring subsystem
    (MS), the control subsystem (CTS), and the computing subsystem (CPS), which are
    described in detail in the referenced review. Communication between these subsystems
    is explained in the paper.'

  extract_2: To mitigate the effects of the lack of IoT standardization, including
    scalability, reusability, and interoperability, we propose a domain-agnostic monitoring
    and control framework (MCF) for the design and implementation of IoT systems.
    We created building blocks for the layers of the five-layer IoT architecture and
    built the MCF’s subsystems (monitoring subsystem, control subsystem, and computing
    subsystem). We demonstrated the utilization of MCF in a real-world use-case in
    smart agriculture, using off-the-shelf sensors and actuators and an open-source
    code.

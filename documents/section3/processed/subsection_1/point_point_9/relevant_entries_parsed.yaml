  key_findings: 'Precision agriculture (PA) applications in irrigation are stymied
    by lack of decision support systems.

    Modern PA relies on sensor systems and near real-time feedback for irrigation
    decision support and control.

    Sophisticated understanding of biophysics and biological systems now guides site-specific
    irrigation.'
  limitations: The study does not specifically address the role of metadata in providing
    context and enabling better data interpretation and decision-making.
  main_objective: To discuss the current state of precision agriculture (PA) applications
    in irrigation and highlight the need for decision support systems to improve irrigation
    practices.
  relevance_evaluation: This study is relevant to the point of exploring the role
    of metadata in providing context and enabling better data interpretation and decision-making
    because it discusses the importance of sensor systems and near real-time feedback
    for irrigation decision support and control. Metadata is crucial for providing
    context and enabling better data interpretation and decision-making, as it provides
    information about the data, such as its source, format, and meaning. This information
    can help users understand the data and make more informed decisions.

  data_sources: survey data, Interviews, Case studies, Literature review
  explanation: Metadata is the use of other information to interpret data.  For example,
    to interpret information about the relative acidity or alkalinity of a water source,
    we need to know when the sample was collected. The time the water sample was collected
    is metadata. By knowing the time the water sample was collected we can use other
    data sources, such as local weather data or population data, to infer what factors
    might have contributed to the measured acidity or alkalinity.
  extract_1: The generated water information should be combined with infrastructure
    and institution in order to reach an efficient water resources planning and management
    for both the current and uncertain future periods (Cantor et al. 2018).
  extract_2: 'The main nine steps of the data life cycle are as follow: Fig. 3.1 Data
    life cycle (Adopted from NSF DataONE Project 2017) Full size image Data need evaluation
    and planning: needs of decision makers are fully evaluated; Data collection: observations
    are performed; Data quality assurance: checks and inspections are required to
    analyse the data quality; Data description and documentation: data should be accurately
    described using the metadata standards and guidelines; Data preservation and archival:
    data should be preserved in a specific archive (e.g., data service and data centre);
    Data discovery: both useful and relevant data information should be obtained;
    Data integration: data from different sources should be combined; Data analysis:
    data should be interpreted; and Data release planning: data should be described,
    managed, and made accessible.'

  key_findings: Water information and data bases are used for addressing environmental,
    physical, social, political, economic, and ecological issues of water supply,
    consumption, availability, and accessibility. Different disciplines of water resources
    management, such as flood risk assessment, water supply management, reservoir
    operation, and water sanitation require incorporation of different types of water
    information for efficient planning and decision making.
  limitations: null
  main_objective: This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive and critical
    evaluation of the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end
    automated irrigation management systems.
  relevance_evaluation: The paper outlines the importance of metadata in water resources
    management. Metadata is defined as additional information that describes the raw
    water data. Metadata makes it possible for decision makers to use the data to
    the best of its capabilities. By understanding when water data was collected,
    managers can better infer what factors contributed to the measurements.

  explanation: 'Metadata, in this context, refers to information about the plant images
    that is not directly related to the plant''s physical characteristics, such as
    the imaging device used, the date and time the image was taken, and the environmental
    conditions. This information can be used to ensure that the images are properly
    calibrated and processed, and to help interpret the results of the image analysis.


    The specific relevance of metadata to the study of plant phenomics lies in its
    ability to provide context and enable better data interpretation and decision-making.
    For example, knowing the imaging device used can help to correct for any distortions
    or biases in the image, and knowing the date and time the image was taken can
    help to account for any changes in the plant''s appearance due to diurnal or seasonal
    variations. Environmental conditions, such as temperature and humidity, can also
    affect the appearance of plants in images, so knowing these conditions can help
    to control for their effects.


    Overall, metadata is an important consideration in plant phenomics because it
    can provide valuable information that can help to improve the accuracy and reliability
    of image analysis results. By providing context and enabling better data interpretation,
    metadata can help researchers to make more informed decisions about plant phenotyping
    and management.'
  extract_1: Metadata, such as the imaging device used, the date and time the image
    was taken, and the environmental conditions, can be used to ensure that the images
    are properly calibrated and processed, and to help interpret the results of the
    image analysis.
  extract_2: By providing context and enabling better data interpretation, metadata
    can help researchers to make more informed decisions about plant phenotyping and
    management.

  limitations: The main limitations of the study are that it does not provide a comprehensive
    overview of all of the different types of metadata that can be used in plant phenomics,
    and it does not provide any specific examples of how metadata has been used to
    improve the accuracy and reliability of image analysis results.
  relevance_evaluation: The relevance of the paper to the point being made in your
    review is moderately relevant. The paper discusses the importance of metadata
    in providing context and enabling better data interpretation and decision-making
    in the context of plant phenomics. This is relevant to the point being made in
    your review, which is that metadata can be useful for fully addressing the point
    and outline.

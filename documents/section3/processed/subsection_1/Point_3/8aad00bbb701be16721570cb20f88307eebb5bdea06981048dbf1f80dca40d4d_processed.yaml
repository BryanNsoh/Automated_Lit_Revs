    • The role of Internet of Things in arable farming is reviewed. • Internet of
    Things is leading arable farming to become data-driven. • Implementation and application
    are described in depth. • Challenges, corresponding solutions and potentials are
    discussed thoroughly. The Internet of Things is allowing agriculture, here specifically
    arable farming, to become data-driven, leading to more timely and cost-effective
    production and management of farms, and at the same time reducing their environmental
    impact. This review is addressing an analytical survey of the current and potential
    application of Internet of Things in arable farming, where spatial data, highly
    varying environments, task diversity and mobile devices pose unique challenges
    to be overcome compared to other agricultural systems. The review contributes
    an overview of the state of the art of technologies deployed. It provides an outline
    of the current and potential applications, and discusses the challenges and possible
    solutions and implementations. Lastly, it presents some future directions for
    the Internet of Things in arable farming. Current issues such as smart phones,
    intelligent management of Wireless Sensor Networks, middleware platforms, integrated
    Farm Management Information Systems across the supply chain, or autonomous vehicles
    and robotics stand out because of their potential to lead arable farming to smart
    arable farming. During the implementation, different challenges are encountered,
    and here interoperability is a key major hurdle throughout all the layers in the
    architecture of an Internet of Things system, which can be addressed by shared
    standards and protocols. Challenges such as affordability, device power consumption,
    network latency, Big Data analysis, data privacy and security, among others, have
    been identified by the articles reviewed and are discussed in detail. Different
    solutions to all identified challenges are presented addressing technologies such
    as machine learning, middleware platforms, or intelligent data management. Previous

    The global population and its food consumption are growing alarmingly quickly,
    while climate change effects are simultaneously complicating the challenge of
    ensuring food security in a sustainable manner (Godfray et al., 2010, Tilman et
    al., 2011). Data-driven agriculture is one of the main strategies and concepts
    proposed to increase production efficiently while decreasing its environmental
    impact (Foley et al., 2011). Data-driven technologies in general are quickly advancing
    with the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), and may become an important
    part of the future of farming (Brewster et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2016,
    Verdouw, 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Smart Farming, also called Agriculture 4.0
    or digital farming (CEMA, 2017), is developing beyond the modern concept of precision
    agriculture, which bases its management practices on spatial measurements largely
    thanks to Global Positioning System (GPS) signals. Smart farming bases its management
    tasks also on spatial data but is enhanced with context-awareness and is activated
    by real-time events, improving the performance of hitherto precision agriculture
    solutions (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Additionally, Smart
    Farming usually incorporates intelligent services for applying and managing Information
    and Communication Technologies (ICT) in farming, and allows transverse integration
    throughout the whole agri-food chain in regards to food safety and traceability
    (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). IoT is therefore a key technology in smart farming
    since it ensures data flow between sensors and other devices, making it possible
    to add value to the obtained data by automatic processing, analysis and access,
    and this leads to more timely and cost-effective production and management effort
    on farms. Simultaneously, IoT enables the reduction of the inherent environmental
    impact by real-time reaction to alert events such as weed, pest or disease detection,
    weather or soil monitoring warnings, which allow for a reduction and adequate
    use of inputs such as agrochemicals or water. IoT eases documentation and supervision
    of different activities as well as the traceability of products, improving the
    environmental surveying and control in farms by the appropriate authorities. The
    IoT concept was introduced by Kevin Ashton in 1999 in relation to linking Radio-Frequency
    Identification (RFID) for supply chains to the internet (Ashton, 2009), but has
    no official definition. It implies, however, the connection of a network of “things”
    to or through the internet without direct human intervention. “Things” can be
    any object with sensors and/or actuators that is uniquely addressable, interconnected
    and accessible through the world-wide computer network, i.e. the Internet. The
    application of IoT in agriculture is advantageous because of the possibility to
    monitor and control many different parameters in an interoperable, scalable and
    open context with an increasing use of heterogeneous automated components (Kamilaris,
    Gao, Prenafeta-Boldu, & Ali, 2016), in addition to the inevitable requirement
    for traceability. As a result of IoT, agriculture is becoming data-driven, i.e.
    making informed real-time decisions for managing the farm, reducing uncertainties
    and inefficiencies, and as a consequence reducing its environmental impact. The
    application of IoT in agriculture, also called Ag-IoT (Zhai, 2017), AIoT (Zou
    & Quan, 2017), or IoF meaning Internet of Farming (Alahmadi, Alwajeeh, Mohanan,
    & Budiarto, 2017) or Internet of Food and Farm (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), has received exponentially increasing attention in the scientific
    community (Fig. 1). Even though the publications are mainly dominated by Asian
    scientists (Talavera et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016), in Europe several large scale
    international pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019), are aiming to implement IoT technologies in the agricultural
    industry in Europe. Similar projects elsewhere include the Accelerating Precision
    Agriculture to Decision Agriculture (P2D) project in Australia (Zhang, Baker,
    Jakku, & Llewellyn, 2017), which complement additional major investments with
    the aim to help farmers convert to smart farming (Higgins et al., 2017, Pham and
    Stack, 2018). Download : Download high-res image (95KB) Download : Download full-size

    searching criteria: (Internet of things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    Several reviews have been done on IoT in agriculture in the relatively short time
    period in which publications about the subject have emerged (Ray, 2017, Stočes
    et al., 2016, Talavera et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). In
    addition, review papers have been published with a focus on specific subjects
    related to IoT applied in agriculture, such as Big Data (Kamilaris et al., 2017,
    Wolfert et al., 2017), modelling (O''Grady & O''Hare, 2017), Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) (Jawad, Nordin, Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail, 2017), food supply chain (Ramundo,
    Taisch, & Terzi, 2016), Internet of Underground Things (Vuran, Salam, Wong, &
    Irmak, 2018), chemical wireless sensors (Kassal, Steinberg, & Murkovi, 2018),
    or Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS) (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015;
    Kaloxylos et al., 2012). However, to the authors'' knowledge, no existing review
    has focused on arable farming, which has specific characteristics and challenges
    that differ from those in a controlled environment, i.e. greenhouses, or permanent
    crops such as fruit orchards. Arable farming poses particular challenges due to:
    • much larger farm sizes, which affect the design of the sensor networks, the
    data processing, analysis and extrapolation of limited stationary sensor data,
    and the consequent decision making with regards to actuators, vehicle logistics,
    etc.; • the larger farm sizes also imply that spatial data has a central role
    in arable farming, affecting the data processing, decision making and precision
    machinery employed to address in-field variability not at plant level as in most
    permanent crops, but at subfield level with automatic recognition and actuation
    (Zude-Sasse, Fountas, Gemtos, & Abu-Khalaf, 2016); • greater use of mobile sensors
    and other devices on vehicles, which have specific challenges. While other cropping
    systems may also use sensors and devices on operating machinery, arable farming
    often requires a fleet of vehicles to operate in a co-ordinated fashion. This
    creates issues particularly regarding network infrastructure (Martínez, Pastor,
    Álvarez, & Iborra, 2016), e.g. connectivity to the cloud of moving things that
    rely mainly on mobile networks, or vehicle to implement communication, which implies
    real-time interoperability between machines and devices from different manufacturers
    (Peets, Mouazen, Blackburn, Kuang, & Wiebensohn, 2012); • larger amounts of heterogeneous
    spatial data generated at different rates and from very disparate sources: stationary
    sensors, moving vehicles and implements, satellites, data from web services, etc.,
    which need to be intelligently integrated; • highly varying and uncertain environmental
    conditions, as annual crops are more susceptible to weather changes and other
    external factors than permanent crops, which are more resilient mainly due to
    their deeper roots (Zude-Sasse et al., 2016), or crops in controlled environments.
    This obligates the IoT system to handle both spatial and temporal data, increasing
    the complexity of the data processing as well as the decisions based on the data
    collected. • more diverse types of field tasks per growing season in arable farming,
    from soil preparation and crop establishment, through highly varying plant nursing
    tasks, to coordinated harvest, which increase the complexity and also the risks.
    The IoT in agriculture is a fast-developing field, which can make reviews obsolete
    quickly. This challenge can be overcome by focussing a critical view on the general
    principles, main application areas and identify the limitations and challenges.
    Summarising, the aim of the paper is to provide an up to date novel analytical
    review of the role of IoT in arable farming, with the following specific objectives:
    • Provide an overview of the current situation of IoT technologies deployed in
    arable farming. Focussing on the current use of communication technologies and
    protocols, the generation and analysis of data, and IoT architectures. • Outline
    the different applications and capabilities of IoT in arable farming. • Investigate
    the main challenges encountered by IoT enabling technologies applied to arable
    farming. • Present key potential fields of application where IoT could be employed,
    as well as future directions of the current trends. The remaining part of this
    paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the methodology used in this
    review paper. Section 3 provides an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies
    used in arable farming; Section 4 presents an outline of the current and potential
    IoT-based applications in arable farming; Section 5 discusses the challenges and
    solutions found in its implementation; and lastly, the review closes with Section
    6 in which future directions are summarised. 2. Review methodology In order to
    address the specific objectives identified above, the literature listing from
    the SCOPUS database of the last 11 years has been reviewed. More precisely, the
    timeframe investigated was from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2018, selected as
    the whole period in which any literature about the subject turned up in the studied
    database. SCOPUS was selected as the primary literature source as it is a key
    peer-reviewed research literature database. The specific keywords used in the
    search criteria where: (Internet of Things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    To ease the searching process, the keywords needed to be present in at least the
    title, abstract, highlights or keywords. Additionally, the articles had to be
    published in English. Articles concerning greenhouse, livestock or permanent crops
    were excluded from the survey, as were supply chain related articles. However,
    issues concerning traceability at farm level were included. The survey was performed
    in a systematic manner following three steps (see Fig. 2): • Firstly, a list of
    1193 articles meeting the search criteria mentioned above was retrieved from the
    database. • In the second step, by reading the titles, any article that was clearly
    not related to arable farming was excluded, leaving a list of 293 articles. •
    In the last step, a second screening was made by reading the abstracts, where
    articles outside the focus of this review were omitted. After this step, 167 articles
    were studied in detail, from which 69 articles were considered relevant, 27 as
    partially relevant, while the rest were considered of little relevance. Relevance
    concerned mainly the connection of the article to the subject studied. The content
    of a relevant article directly addresses the application of an IoT technology
    in an arable farming scenario. A partially relevant article studies a certain
    IoT technology in agriculture in a broader sense. In the distinction made regarding
    little relevant articles included off-topic, lack of novelty, as well as non-peer-reviewed
    articles that lacked scientific rigour, e.g. ambiguous information or absence
    of materials or methods description. Download : Download high-res image (208KB)

    The final 167 articles studied included: 77 journal papers, 88 conference papers
    and 4 book chapters, of which 19 were review papers. The final list of articles
    was complemented with other publications that expanded on some of the IoT related
    subjects and technologies mentioned in the studied articles, and did not contain
    the specified keywords. These were found by a targeted search for specific subjects.
    Lastly, in each article from the final list a special focus was made on the IoT
    technologies employed, the applications, the challenges encountered and, finally,
    on potential future perspectives. 3. IoT implementation in arable farming IoT
    has recently been gaining momentum in the farming industry as it can fulfil the
    urgent necessity for interoperability across brands, scalability and traceability
    (Kamilaris et al., 2016). Different technologies are implemented as IoT is still
    evolving, adapting to a great diversity of uses. To cover the range of technologies,
    protocols, standards, etc. employed, this review is addressing the layers in the
    IoT architecture. Three layers normally describe the architecture of the IoT in
    the literature reviewed (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Khattab et al., 2016,
    Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Na and Isaac, 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw,
    2016), though some authors divide it into more layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Ramundo et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Talavera et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2014),
    depending on their definitions. More than three layers can especially be relevant
    in IoT systems with edge or fog computing, where an edge/fog computing layer can
    be considered in between the device and network layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016). Even though the naming of the layers also varies depending on the author,
    there is nonetheless a general trend to divide the layers into device, network
    and application layers (Fig. 3). Thus, this has been the adapted structure in
    this review. The device layer consists of the physical objects (things) that are
    capable of automatic identification, sensing or actuation, and connection to the
    internet. The network layer communicates the data to a gateway (or proxy server)
    to the internet (cloud) by the use of communication protocols. And the application
    layer typically stores and facilitates access for the end-user to the processed/analysed
    information. Download : Download high-res image (222KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. IoT architecture represented by device, network and application
    layer, in which the middleware platform is not always present. The collected data
    experience diverse stages during their transition from sensors to cloud, interfaces,
    and occasionally actuators, and these stages have considerable influence on the
    technologies applied in an IoT context. Six main stages regarding data flow have
    been identified in the literature reviewed: sensing/perception, communication/transport/transfer,
    storage, processing, analytics, and actuation and display (Fig. 4). The order
    of the stages is different depending on the IoT setup employed and the computing
    techniques used, e.g. fog and edge computing processes the data before communicating
    it to the cloud, an example of its application in precision farming is given by
    Ferrández-Pastor et al. (2016); while cloud computing processes the data in the
    cloud, examples of this are given by Hernandez-Rojas, Mazon-Olivo, Novillo-Vicuña,
    and Belduma-Vacacela (2018) and Na and Isaac (2016). Nonetheless, sensing/perception
    is normally the first stage, where data are captured by sensors, then the data
    can follow different paths and does not necessarily go through all the steps listed.
    In summary, IoT data is identified to be gathered or generated through three main
    processes: machine generated, which come from sensing devices; process-mediated,
    i.e. commercial data coming from business processes; and human-sourced, recorded
    by humans and digitalised later on (Balducci, Impedovo, Informatica, & Moro, 2018).
    These different sources have an influence on how to process, analyse and use the
    data in IoT solutions, and this needs to be taken into account in the overall
    data acquisition planning process. Download : Download high-res image (171KB)

    in arable farming. 3.1. Device layer As mentioned above, the device layer consists
    of the physical objects (things) that are capable of automatic identification,
    sensing or actuating, and providing connection to the internet. Sensor devices
    measure and collect one or more parameters automatically and transmit the data
    wirelessly to the cloud. And, when the devices become actuators, they generally,
    in turn, receive data from the cloud in order to activate or deactivate some mechanical
    component, e.g. a valve in an irrigation system. The device layer is also often
    called perception layer (Tzounis et al., 2017, Zou and Quan, 2017), sensing layer
    (Na and Isaac, 2016, Wang et al., 2014), or physical layer (Ramundo et al., 2016,
    Talavera et al., 2017). The devices are constituted of a transceiver, a microcontroller,
    an interfacing circuit and one or more sensors and/or actuators. The sensor measures
    a physical parameter, e.g. air temperature that is interpreted and transformed
    into an equivalent analogue signal, i.e. electric voltage or current, which is
    then converted by the interfacing circuit, i.e. Analogue-to-Digital Converter
    (ADC), into a corresponding digital format. Afterwards, the microcontroller, sometimes
    also in the form of microprocessors or single-board computers (Talavera et al.,
    2017), collects the data in digital format from one or more sensors through the
    ADC, and sends them to the transceiver, i.e. a wireless communication module,
    which communicates the data to a gateway. A comparison of microcontrollers and
    single-board computers used in IoT in agriculture has been made by Ray (2017).
    In the case of edge computing, the microcontroller or single-board computer processes
    the data from one or more sensors before communicating them, with the intention
    of, for example, reducing the amount of data to be transferred to the cloud and
    accelerating the data processing (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et
    al., 2016). In fog computing the data are processed in the local area network
    level, i.e. in a fog node or IoT gateway (Ahmed, Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed,
    De et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018). When employing an actuator, the
    signal is received by the transceiver, communicated to the microcontroller, where
    it is then converted to analogue signal by a Digital-to-Analogue Converter (DAC),
    i.e. the interfacing circuit, or to a digital signal by a Digital-to-Digital Converter,
    and finally interpreted by the actuator, which acts in accordance to the signal
    received. In arable farming, when agricultural machinery data are used, i.e. data
    from sensors and devices mounted on tractors or other agricultural machinery,
    the data in digital format is normally collected and accessible through the Controller
    Area Network (CAN) bus in the machine, although in some cases some data are accessible
    through other ports (Oksanen et al., 2016, Peets et al., 2012). Machine and operator
    performance information is accessible through the Machine and Implement Control
    System (MICS) of the machine, which can also be accessed through the CAN bus data.
    MICS data are used to allow machinery operators and farm managers to monitor and
    potentially improve the efficiency of their machines, by employing e.g. smart
    alerts or recommendation systems (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015). Global Navigation Satellite
    System (GNSS) data, e.g. Real Time Kinematics GPS (RTK-GPS), are often also available
    through the CAN bus port, which allows, among others, vehicle monitoring and dynamic
    optimised route planning Edwards et al., 2017, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018. Many
    different sensors and actuators are employed in arable farming. The type of device
    used depends on the purpose of the system in addition to the technologies implemented
    in the system. And the number of devices is steadily increasing. The number of
    IoT device installations in farms is expected to increase globally from 30 million
    installations in 2015 to 75 million in 2020. Furthermore, data points generated
    per day and farm are expected to increase from 190000 in 2014 to over half a million
    by 2020 (Meola, 2016). It was also estimated that by 2018 there would be 10 billion
    IoT devices employed in agriculture. However, the great amount of data generated
    is often unused or underutilised (Bennett, 2015), e.g. in countries like Denmark
    with a relative high ICT adoption in farms, in 2016 only 2–5% of farmers worked
    actively with the data generated (SEGES, 2016). Even if data usage is still relatively
    low, it is expected to increase rapidly (Bennett, 2015, Wolfert et al., 2017,
    World Bank, 2017) An overview about how they are implemented for different purposes
    is presented in the Applications section. 3.2. Network layer The network layer
    communicates the data initially to an intermediary platform and eventually to
    the internet (cloud), and from there to, for example, employed actuators. When
    the data are transferred to the intermediary platform, it typically uses wireless
    communication technologies, for instance RFID, WSN with Zigbee, LoRa (Long Range),
    etc., and more recently Near-Field Communication (NFC) (Kassal et al., 2018, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). The intermediary platform
    is normally an internet gateway located in the vicinity of the connected devices,
    also including sometimes a proxy server, where the data are collected and occasionally
    processed in order to send the information further to the end user through the
    internet by the use of e.g. MQTT standards, or HTML or XMPP protocols. The use
    of Android smart devices or other operating systems is also increasing in popularity
    among agricultural applications, as they can be employed as a gateway for 3G and
    4G networks, and they frequently include other wireless communication technologies,
    e.g. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPRS and NFC. They also automatically conform to communication
    standards and protocols, in which way interoperability is increased (Balmos et
    al., 2016, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Gao and Yao, 2016, Hernandez-Rojas et
    al., 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). In addition, Android and other smart
    devices can include GNSS and RGB camera sensors, and can relatively easily be
    programmed for computing data and displaying Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications
    being able to straightforwardly update the software if necessary. In that manner,
    Android and similar smart devices are represented in all three IoT layers, i.e.
    sensing in the device layer, node or gateway in the network layer, and computing
    data and displaying GUI in the application layer. Furthermore, the automatic software
    updating possibilities of smart devices allow remote installation of updates with
    new functionalities, bug fixes, etc. and easily improve the interoperability of
    the system (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). Many different wireless technologies
    have been applied for diverse purposes in agriculture, depending on economic,
    accessibility and capability factors. Jawad et al., 2017, Ray, 2017 and Tzounis
    et al. (2017) have presented good overviews of the specifications of wireless
    communication technologies implemented in IoT in an agricultural context, which
    have been here collected in Table 1 and complemented with information from other
    relevant articles (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Elijah et al., 2018, Kassal et al.,
    2018, Sinha et al., 2017, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). The great variety of technologies,
    standards and frequency bands used exposes the relevant interoperability and application
    challenges found when applying IoT technologies. Potential communication standards
    for smart farming can be classified into short-range and long-range according
    to their communication distance, which determines their specific usability in
    different requirement settings. This is particularly the case in arable farming,
    where mobile network accessibility can be an issue in many rural areas, and where
    large farm sizes limit the use of some wireless technologies due to their reduced
    communication distance and due to the necessity to replace/recharge device batteries
    on nodes over large areas. These issues are addressed in the challenges section
    later. Table 1. Wireless communication technologies (adapted from Jawad et al.,
    2017, Ray, 2017 & Tzounis et al. (2017)). Technology Standard(s) Frequency Data

    m 1 mW a Not yet publicly available. A WSN is formed by pervasive devices called
    motes or sensor nodes, which integrate sensors and actuators that communicate
    wirelessly forming a spatial network (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). In a WSN, base stations act as gateways forwarding
    the data to the cloud. Different communication technologies support different
    network node architectures, e.g. star, tree or mesh. Depending on the application,
    different wireless communication technologies are employed in a WSN as each has
    different node architecture possibilities, data rates, ranges, standards, among
    others, with the use of ZigBee, LoRa, Bluetooth/BLE, WiFi and SigFox being relatively
    common in agriculture. In arable farming, BLE has for example been employed for
    soil and air monitoring and irrigation control (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018);
    ZigBee was used in a WSN for monitoring soil conditions and actuating an irrigation
    system (Mafuta et al., 2012) and crop monitoring (Zhai, 2017); and LoRa for air
    and water temperature of rice paddy fields (Tanaka, 2018) and smart irrigation
    control (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018). In order to cover
    larger distances, GPRS is appropriate and has been used for irrigation control
    (López-Riquelme et al., 2017), and for remote maintenance of machinery (Miettinen,
    Oksanen, Suomi, & Visala, 2006). GPRS, or other technologies, such as LTE, or
    3G/4G, are also commonly used at the gateway to transmit data to the cloud. Regarding
    other less common communication technologies used in WSNs, RFID can be integrated
    into a WSN too by connecting the RFID tag readers to a radio-frequency transceiver
    (Costa et al., 2013). Passive and active RFID technologies are used to a great
    extent in agricultural research and industry (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), especially
    for animal production (e.g. Kamilaris et al., 2016), as well as vegetable or fruit
    product traceability (e.g. Kodali, Jain, & Karagwal, 2017); however, in arable
    farming only few examples have been found: e.g. RFID tags used for irrigation
    scheduling (Vellidis, Tucker, Perry, Kvien, & Bednarz, 2008), for agrochemical
    traceability (Peets, Gasparin, Blackburn, & Godwin, 2009), for vehicle monitoring
    (Sjolander, Thomasson, Sui, & Ge, 2011), and even on a prototype for soil temperature
    monitoring (Hamrita & Hoffacker, 2005). Regarding NFC, no concrete examples of
    NFC used in arable farming have been found in the literature reviewed. Finally,
    the latest generation of mobile communications, i.e. 5G, has higher data rates,
    large coverage areas, higher peak throughput, and also improved flexibility, which
    can open new possibilities and may solve some of the challenges encountered by
    many IoT solutions (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Marsch et al., 2016). 5G allows new
    options for monitoring rural areas with no previous infrastructure for Internet
    connection (Faraci, Raciti, Rizzo, & Schembra, 2018). 5G can also improve vehicle-to-vehicle
    or vehicle-to-anything communication in e.g. logistics solutions, due to its low
    latency and new frequency bands (Marsch et al., 2016). A challenge for the 5G
    networks will be the great increase in devices to support once IoT becomes a standard
    solution not only in agriculture, but also in any sphere of everyday life. 3.3.
    Application layer The application layer is crucial in an IoT context as it is
    this layer that actually adds value to the sensed and communicated data through
    directly controlling devices, supporting farmers'' decision making, etc. In this
    layer, several important services occur such as data storage, data analytics,
    data access through an appropriate Application Programming Interface (API), as
    well as possibly a user interfaced software application. The layer may also include
    middleware platforms that aid handling the heterogeneous cloud data improving
    interoperability. Data storage can be cloud based, i.e. on multiple servers, or
    more local based, where data are stored in different types of databases, depending
    on the application and design. Even if relational databases, such as Structured
    Query Language (SQL) databases (Gao and Yao, 2016, Goap et al., 2018, Ray, 2017,
    Wang et al., 2014), MySQL (Kaloxylos et al., 2014), or PostgreSQL (Mazon-Olivo,
    Hernández-Rojas, Maza-Salinas, & Pan, 2018) are employed in some of the reported
    applications in the reviewed articles, non-relational databases, such as Not only
    SQL (NoSQL), or also SPARQL, a semantic query language based database, are gaining
    attention due to their flexibility and scalability, especially when dealing with
    Big Data. Their ability to store and manage large amounts of heterogeneous data
    makes them suitable in many IoT agricultural contexts (Huang and Zhang, 2017,
    Kamilaris et al., 2017). Examples of NoSQL employed in agriculture are Cassandra
    (Huang & Zhang, 2017), Dynamo (Xian, 2017), HBase (Ray, 2017, Wang et al., 2014)
    and MongoDB (Martínez et al., 2016). An example of SPARQL has been given by Jayaraman
    et al. (2016). Data analytics can be achieved by cloud computing, where computer
    resources are managed remotely to analyse data, often Big Data, or by distributed
    computing, e.g. edge and fog computing. Cloud computing has the advantage that
    it provides high quality services that allow independent execution of multiple
    applications as if they were isolated, even if they are on the same platform,
    e.g. in data centres, which is especially relevant when dealing with Big Data
    (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Martínez et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017). However,
    cloud computing techniques mostly rely on general purpose cloud providers that
    do not comply with specific agricultural service requirements (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017) and can experience latency issues, which are not acceptable in IoT
    solutions where monitoring, control and analysis require fast performance (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2018). Examples of application of cloud computing related to arable farming
    are given by Khattab et al., 2016, Na and Isaac, 2016 and López-Riquelme et al.
    (2017). Khattab et al. (2016) present an IoT architecture with a cloud-based back-end
    where weather and soil data are processed and analysed for automatic activation
    of irrigation and spraying actions. Na and Isaac (2016) describe a human-centric
    IoT architecture with a list of cloud services, such as language translation,
    data simplification or updated market price information. And López-Riquelme et
    al. (2017) use FIWARE components for a cloud service for smart irrigation tasks,
    focussing on the benefits of using FIWARE as cloud provider. Regarding Big Data
    analysis and Big Data in general in an agricultural context, Kamilaris et al.
    (2017) and Wolfert et al. (2017) respectively have performed exhaustive reviews
    on the subject. The use of IoT middleware platforms is gaining interest due to
    its potential for solving different challenges found in the application of IoT,
    especially interoperability. IoT middleware platforms try to simplify the complex
    communication through the cloud due to heterogeneity of devices, communications
    and networks, by using enablers like standardised APIs and protocols (Jayaraman
    et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017). Examples of
    these are HYDRA, UBIWARE, UBIROAD, UBIDOTS, SMEPP, SIXTH, Think Speak, SensorCloud,
    Amazon IoT and IBM IoT, with focus on context aware functionality; SOCRADES, GSN
    and SIRENA, with more focus on security and privacy; Aneka, WSO2, PubNub, SmartFarmNet
    and FIWARE, with a wider services-oriented approach; and projects like IoT-A,
    OpenIoT, or ArrowHead (Gill et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2015, Jayaraman et
    al., 2016, Kamilaris et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016). Even if all these and more solutions are found in the IoT market,
    an intelligent middleware solution that addresses most issues observed in smart
    farming successfully is yet to be implemented (Jayaraman et al., 2016, Martínez
    et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). However, FIWARE (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    López-Riquelme et al., 2017, Martínez et al., 2016, Rodriguez et al., 2018) and
    SmartFarmNet (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Jayaraman et al., 2016) have been
    implemented effectively for precision and smart farming applications. In order
    to communicate data across platforms and IoT devices, ensuring interoperability,
    APIs are essential. These should adapt to evolving or new standards in order to
    ensure a longer life span, which may become a limitation if the APIs are not updated.
    It is through the APIs that data are made available for the IoT applications (e.g.
    Goap et al., 2018, Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018). These services may include tracing,
    monitoring, event management, forecasting or optimisation for agricultural activities
    and products. These applications related to arable farming are described in the
    next section. 4. Current and potential applications Multiple applications can
    be derived from the implementation of IoT in arable farming. These applications
    can always be conceptualised into the three IoT layers described previously, and
    are not to be confused with the application layer. Elaborations of the reviewed
    articles show that the applications have been differentiated and categorised as
    follows: monitoring, documentation, forecasting and controlling. Monitoring refers
    to timely sensing of very diverse parameters and is mostly the initial point of
    entry for other applications. Documentation covers the storing of sampled data
    for later use in e.g. farm management or traceability of produce. Forecasting
    employs different sources of data through precisely designed analytic methods
    for predicting concrete events. And controlling is the result of active monitoring,
    where processed data are used to automatically activate and control actuators
    in a predefined manner. A summarising table collects all the IoT applications
    in arable farming described in this chapter (Table 2). Most IoT-based systems
    include at least two of these applications and isolated applications are seldom
    seen. In addition, special attention has been paid to FMIS and associated decision
    support to improve operations and production processes involving vehicle positioning
    analytics, optimisation and logistics, which are key elements in arable farming
    (Bochtis et al., 2011, Bochtis et al., 2014) and have consequently got a section
    of their own. Table 2. IoT applications in arable farming. Applications Examples

    Automatic monitoring is the obvious first step in IoT applied to agriculture.
    Strategically placed sensors can automatically sense and transmit data to the
    cloud for further documentation, forecasting or controlling applications. Sensors
    are used to monitor crop parameters such as leaf area index (e.g. Bauer & Aschenbruck,
    2018), plant height and leaf colour, size and shape (e.g. Okayasu et al., 2017);
    soil parameters such as soil moisture (e.g. Brinkhoff et al., 2017, Kodali and
    Sahu, 2016) or soil chemistry (e.g. Kassal et al., 2018); irrigation water parameters
    such as pH and salinity (e.g. Popović et al., 2017); or weather parameters such
    as air temperature, air pressure, air relative humidity, rainfall, radiation,
    wind speed and wind direction (e.g. Yan et al., 2018). In addition, remote sensing
    can also be employed, i.e. instead of sensors placed in the field they are installed
    on satellites or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). However, these measurements mostly
    require some form of processing and interpretation as the values sampled are not
    directly related to the targeted parameters. An example of monitoring through
    remote sensing is the estimation of crop biomass and nitrogen content by the use
    of hyper- and multispectral images (Näsi et al., 2018), or the use of thermal
    remote sensing, which has been applied for e.g. irrigation scheduling or plant
    disease detection (Khanal, Fulton, & Shearer, 2017). Furthermore, agricultural
    machinery can also be remotely monitored, e.g. vehicle position and yield data
    (Oksanen et al., 2016), or machine performance (Miettinen et al., 2006). This
    is especially relevant with the increasing appearance of autonomous vehicles and
    robots in agriculture (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). Finally, at farm level the storage
    of crops can also be monitored to ensure the correct control of, for example,
    temperature and moisture, and avoid losses due to damage (Green et al., 2009,
    Juul et al., 2015). Environmental impact indicators should be integrated into
    farm monitoring applications, so that leaching (Burton, Dave, Fernandez, Jayachandran,
    & Bhansali, 2018), contaminants (Severino, D’Urso, Scarfato, & Toraldo, 2018)
    or emissions (Manap & Najib, 2014) are addressed too. 4.2. Documentation and traceability
    Collected operations and process data once stored can be used for documentation.
    Documentation is usually the natural application of monitored data but it must
    be noted that it can also include other types of sampled data, such as manually
    input or documentation of performed control actions (Sørensen, Pesonen, Bochtis,
    Vougioukas, & Suomi, 2011). The data are stored as raw data or as processed data
    at different levels. Documentation is essential for decision-making, controlling
    or analytics, and is an indispensable element in FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    Mapping is also a form of documentation where data are spatially projected onto
    a map. On-the-go sensors installed on vehicles and implements can be used for
    automated field mapping (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015), e.g. yield mapping used
    for later fertilisation planning (Lyle, Bryan, & Ostendorf, 2014), or soil mapping
    for site-specific amendment measures (Godwin and Miller, 2003, McBratney et al.,
    2003). Remote sensing can also be used for mapping crop development (Khanal et
    al., 2017, Näsi et al., 2018, Viljanen et al., 2018), or soil texture and residue
    coverage (Khanal et al., 2017). Remote sensing is becoming a popular tool for
    monitoring and mapping, but is yet to be proven feasible for all its potential
    applications. When documentation data sets extend beyond the farm level so that
    they can be traced throughout the supply chain, it is often referred as traceability
    and this notion is a key element in agri-food supply chain management as a measure
    to satisfy, for example, consumer demands (Bochtis and Sørensen, 2014, Pesonen
    et al., 2014). 4.3. Forecasting Forecasting is one of the fundamental functions
    for decision making that IoT brings to agriculture. Access to “real-time” data
    and historical data is used for forecasting events that require some form of action
    for managing successfully the crop or field operation. Therefore, both monitoring
    and documentation are important prerequisites for enabling forecasting. Forecasting
    is employed as preventive measures that require some action due to a predicted
    event, e.g. weeding, irrigating or harvesting. Machine learning and scientific
    modelling are examples of tools employed for forecasting. Different machine learning
    models have been employed, e.g. Artificial Neural Networks for forecasting maximum
    and minimum temperatures at field level (Aliev, 2018) or for estimating levels
    of phosphorus (P) in the soil (Estrada-López, Castillo-Atoche, Vázquez-castillo,
    & Sánchez-Sinencio, 2018); support vector regression method for forecasting soil
    moisture (Goap et al., 2018) or plant disease detection (Aasha Nandhini, Hemalatha,
    Radha, & Indumathi, 2017); gradient boosting for predicting irrigation recommendations
    (Goldstein, Fink, & Meitin, 2018); Bayesian networks and random forest for frost
    prediction (Diedrichs, Bromberg, Dujovne, Brun-laguna, & Watteyne, 2018); multiple
    linear regression and random forest in estimating yield and fertilisation requirements
    for forecasting harvest and fertilisation dates (Viljanen et al., 2018); or also
    for frost prediction using four different machine learning algorithms: decision
    tree, boosted tree, random forest, and regression (Moon, Kim, Zhang, & Woo, 2018).
    A rather different forecasting approach was employed by Jain, Sarangi, Bhatt,
    and Pappula (2018), where three different models, i.e. random forest, support
    vector machine and artificial neural network were used for forecasting diseases
    and at the same time for adaptive data collection from the network of nodes in
    order to reduce data traffic and energy consumption of the network. Summarising,
    IoT is allowing the sampling of large amounts of data, which can be employed as
    training data by the machine learning algorithms to build predictive mathematical
    models. Machine learning is opening new possibilities for effectively forecasting
    events in arable farming, which might change the very nature of decision making
    in agriculture. Scientific modelling has also been employed for forecasting in
    an IoT context, e.g. soil moisture dynamics and contaminant migration forecasting
    using soil sensor data and precipitation forecasts for irrigation scheduling (Severino
    et al., 2018); fungal disease forecast in winter wheat (El Jarroudi et al., 2017)
    and barley (Mäyrä, Ruusunen, Jalli, Jauhiainen, & Leiviskä, 2018); or forecasting
    field trafficability and workability for field operations (Edwards, White, Munkholm,
    Sørensen, & Lamandé, 2016). These modelling tools have an important role in agriculture
    as they are conscientiously developed and validated by the scientific community,
    and can forecast events for which machine learning models are very limited. There
    is also considerable potential for integrating existing and acknowledged modelling
    tools such as the soil-crop-atmosphere system model DAISY (Abrahamsen & Hansen,
    2000) or the soil erosion model RUSLE (Renard, Foster, Weesies, & Porter, 1991)
    into an IoT solution. Many of these solutions can make agriculture in general,
    and arable farming in particular, more resource efficient, e.g. through smart
    irrigation, as well as environmentally friendly, e.g. by smart pest and disease
    management. 4.4. Controlling In IoT, controlling is the result of active monitoring
    in an automated system, where the monitored variables are automatically adjusted
    to, for example, predefined thresholds. Forecasting can also play an important
    role in controlling. This is, for example, the case in smart irrigation systems,
    where irrigation is activated before drought damage in the crop is recognised,
    thus reducing yield losses. Goap et al. (2018) employed real-time sensing of soil
    moisture and soil temperature in combination with weather forecasts to control
    a fully autonomous irrigation scheme. Sensors on-the-go installed in tractors
    and implements can also be used to control e.g. variable rate fertilisation (Peets
    et al., 2012), site-specific weed control technologies (Christensen et al., 2009),
    or in-row cultivation controlled by plant patterns in precision seeding (Midtiby,
    Steen, & Green, 2018). Controlling is crucial in smart farming as it allows the
    automation of systems, especially considering the operations of autonomous vehicles
    and robots in the fields (Bechar & Vigneault, 2016), where site-specific actions
    and sensing-based safety systems will play an important role, e.g. for in-field
    obstacle detection for autonomous vehicles (Christiansen, Nielsen, Steen, Jørgensen,
    & Karstoft, 2016). 4.5. FMIS FMIS can be defined as systems that store and process
    farm-related collected data and provide decision supporting tools for farm management
    (Paraforos et al., 2016). FMIS assist farmers in the execution and documentation
    of farm activities, their evaluation and optimisation, as well as in strategic,
    tactical and operational planning of the farm operations (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    FMIS are consequently systems that can encapsulate all the applications previously
    described, and are vital elements in smart farm management. However, the adoption
    of FMIS targeted to the new IoT technologies is slow. A study published in 2015
    showed that most FMIS architectures used at that time had been designed in the
    1980s by researchers. This may explain why most FMIS currently have a structure
    and an architecture that is not suitable for distributed and service oriented
    decision support required for supporting precision agriculture and smart farming
    solutions, e.g. 75% of FMIS are still PC-based, and functionalities regarding
    traceability, quality assurance and agronomic best practice estimate are still
    missing or in their initial development stages in most commercial FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al., 2015). FMIS are key in smart farming and they should support
    automatic data acquisition, monitoring, documenting, planning and decision making
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). The latest research on IoT-based FMIS is expected
    to become part of the commercial FMIS available in the near future and will cover
    different needs across the supply chain and needs of IoT-based agriculture as
    a whole, as well as complying with standards ensuring interoperability between
    systems. In addition, decision support systems (DSS) are essential in dealing
    with Big Data and assisting the farm manager in management and decision making
    in tasks such as farm financial analysis, business processes or supply chain functions
    (Fountas, Carli et al., 2015, Kaloxylos et al., 2012). In order to design an up-to-date
    FMIS, it is beneficial to make preliminary use of dedicated system analysis methodologies,
    such as soft system methodologies (SSM), for identifying required changes and
    constraints and proposing solutions, followed by a later hard system modelling
    for designing the required specifications and components of the system (Sørensen
    et al., 2010, Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015). It is also necessary to base FMIS
    on the cloud as it allows interconnection with diverse additional services (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). This development points out the inevitable need for standardisation
    of APIs in order to achieve interoperability among applications and services as
    part of the FMIS. New technologies such as distributed management systems can
    also enhance the capabilities of FMIS to a great extent (Fountas, Sørensen et
    al., 2015). Furthermore, the introduction of agricultural moving robots in the
    near future, as well as the wireless and automatic control and monitoring of agricultural
    machinery, also needs to be considered in the design and development of FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al, 2015, Paraforos et al., 2016). The future FMIS will also be capable
    of emulating farmers different work habits, as the system will automate certain
    tasks previously performed by farmers, which will require additional training
    (Sørensen et al., 2011). Consequently, it is important to provide supportive adoption
    and transition strategies for conventional farming to convert into smart farming
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). Examples of current FMIS employed in arable farming
    are offered by different technology providers: machine manufacturers, institutions
    or targeted private companies. Some manufacturers provide their own farm management
    tools, such as Agricultural Management Solutions (AMS) from John Deere, or Precision
    Land Management (PLM) from New Holland. Across brands some FMIS have a more local
    approach, e.g. the Dutch Akkerweb developed by Wageningen University and Research,
    while other commercial solutions have a global approach, e.g. 365FarmNet, Agworld
    or FarmWorks. 4.6. Vehicle navigation, optimisation and logistics Navigation systems
    are widely used in arable farming with the successful implementation of auto-steering
    systems in tractors and harvesters. However, IoT-based solutions are still in
    their early stages. IoT-based field operation monitoring (Oksanen et al., 2016)
    or monitoring of motor and machine performance (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015) have been
    effectively implemented on harvesting operations. Commercial examples of agricultural
    telematics are Trimble''s Connected Farm, AGCO''s AgCommand, John Deer JDLink,
    New Holland''s PLM Connect or CLAAS’ telematics; however, they are all closed
    systems, which limits greatly the possibilities of the IoT technologies, especially
    interoperability (Oksanen, Piirainen, & Seilonen, 2015). Regarding optimised route
    planning, pre-planning harvest operations based on field data using simulation
    models can improve the harvest capacity of the vehicle or fleet saving working
    hours as well as fuel consumption (Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Bochtis and Sørensen,
    2009, Busato et al., 2007, Jensen et al., 2012, Zhou et al., 2014). However, field
    complexity and vehicle fleet size can become major hurdles for the algorithms
    employed (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019, Skou-Nielsen et al., 2017). The accessibility
    of field and harvest data can be eased by IoT technologies that allow automated
    data collection and sharing via common communication protocols and standards,
    in interoperable data formats, with compatible data model hierarchies; however,
    this is not always the case (Tzounis et al., 2017). IoT also allows cloud or fog
    computing to be employed to solve the high computational requirements of these
    route planning models (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019), even though the computing can
    also be achieved at the edge (Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Data communication
    costs, latency problems and unstable mobile connectivity may pose important challenges
    for route planning applications that rely only on cloud computing, making mobile
    edge computing more adequate and robust for these systems. Nevertheless, true
    IoT-based dynamic route planning is still in its infancy but gaining increasing
    attention, especially with the arrival of agricultural robots (Bechar and Vigneault,
    2016, Kayacan et al., 2015). Concerning its application, until recently, harvest
    logistics has employed field sampled data, i.e. boundaries, obstacles, gates,
    etc., to optimise the route of the vehicles involved in the operation statically
    (e.g. Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Jensen et al., 2012), where the complete routes
    of all vehicles are planned a priori. Nevertheless, these plans often do not comply
    with real-world challenges as they do not adapt to variating inputs, e.g. vehicle
    speed changes or in-field yield variations, or to unforeseen situations, e.g.
    machine breakdowns, eventual out of field delays, non-trafficable wet spots, undefined
    obstacles, etc. There is consequently the need to integrate route optimisation
    and operation logistics in IoT systems, where the optimisation can adapt dynamically
    to varying input and unforeseen events. It is only in the last few years that
    harvest logistics really started adapting dynamically to parameters such as vehicles''
    behaviour or in-field yield variations (Edwards et al., 2017, Seyyedhasani and
    Dvorak, 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Today, new possibilities for optimising
    infield operations arrive with the large amount of data available via internet,
    e.g. remote sensing data or other collected spatial data. These could be adaptive
    planning based on trafficability maps for reducing soil compaction or avoiding
    vehicles getting stuck in wet spots; or selective harvesting based on predicted
    grain quality maps, which is expected to increase the value of the crop harvested.
    5. Challenges and solutions When implementing IoT in arable farming, as well as
    in other contexts, diverse challenges limit or affect the performance of the systems
    employed. The challenges identified in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5) can indicate
    which areas need to be taken into account when designing an IoT-based system or
    point out areas that require further research. However, the results presented
    in the figure are indicative and do not necessarily describe the importance of
    the challenges included, especially because of the multiple applications and implementation
    designs that are conceivable in arable farming. Any of the challenges can become
    crucial in different setups, and are therefore described. In addition, all challenges
    can be related to or have consequences for other challenges. Download : Download

    of challenges mentioned by the literature reviewed, divided by time periods and
    grouped in IoT layers. Interoperability, in general, is a major hurdle in the
    application of IoT. There are different dimensions related to it: technical, syntactical,
    semantic and organisational (Serrano et al., 2015, Veer and Wiles, 2008). Technical
    interoperability refers mostly to the communication protocols which affect the
    hardware and software components implemented. Syntactical interoperability is
    usually related to data formats, their syntax and encoding. Semantic interoperability
    concerns the interpretation of data contents, i.e. the meaning of the information
    exchanged. And organisational interoperability involves intercommunication of
    meaningful information across organisations regardless of information systems
    and infrastructures in a world-wide scale. As interoperability is such a generic
    term, in this section, technical interoperability has been addressed as part of
    the communication protocol challenge, syntactical and semantic interoperability
    have been included under the data heterogeneity challenge, and organisational
    interoperability have been described under the scalability challenge. 5.1. General
    challenges 5.1.1. Revenue and affordability Often the investment for establishing
    an IoT-based solution is high and as such challenging for small-scale farmers,
    while larger farms can more easily acquire IoT-based technologies when investing
    in new equipment (Brewster et al., 2017). The uncertainty regarding required costs,
    e.g. fuel or water allocations, and selling prices of the product give little
    margin for many farmers for investing in new technologies (Higgins et al., 2017).
    Trust plays an important role when investing in IoT systems, and relieving the
    perceived risks by demonstrating the revenues from their adoption is essential
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Jayashankar et al., 2018). For example, in Europe
    70% of all fertilising and spraying machinery is equipped with at least one precision
    agriculture technology, but only 25% of farmers actually use precision agriculture
    components on their farms (Say, Keskin, Sehri, & Sekerli, 2017). Technology providers
    need to increase the perceived value by demonstrating the financial return from
    IoT in order to diminish the perceived risk of adoption many farmers have. Technology
    providers need also to provide robust tools that are aligned with farmer needs
    and practices in order to gain acceptance and trust of IoT technologies. These
    technologies need to reduce the workload, assist in decision making and improve
    the efficiency of the targeted practice. Additionally, technology providers need
    to develop interoperable and flexible solutions that can easily be integrated
    and comply with accepted standards. Governments can also incentivise IoT adoption
    by policies and regulations, especially regarding documentation and traceability
    as ICT eases paperwork and bureaucracy. A reduction in the percentage of mentions
    regarding this challenge (see Fig. 5) could indicate that IoT is being more adopted
    in arable farming. In addition, IoT is likely to reshape the arable farming business.
    The implementation of monitoring and control of farming operations are generating
    substantial amounts of valuable data that are essential for the business of technology
    providers. The way farmers will dive into the data economy, i.e. connecting their
    data to work in vertical and horizontal networks beyond the farm, will have an
    effect on their business models, as well as on the business models of technology
    providers. The point of view of the farmer''s business regarding IoT has not been
    fully addressed in the literature reviewed and will require further investigation.
    5.1.2. Data heterogeneity The diverse data sources and sensor manufacturers imply
    use of different unit systems, data structures and nomenclatures in different
    data formats, which result in reduced syntactical and semantic interoperability
    among IoT environments. Sensor data can be encoded in binary, or represented in
    formats such as json, xml, text (e.g. csv), shapefile, or even proprietary formats.
    The heterogeneity of data types and formats can also affect the performance of
    a protocol employed for communicating the information. Furthermore, this challenge
    becomes critical in situations such as system integration or sharing data with
    other systems (e.g. FMIS), which could imply developing data conversion tools
    or even redesign of the IoT setup. The use of standardised formats can help with
    this challenge. Some attempts have been made at producing standards or standardised
    formats that cover the great heterogeneity of agricultural data, e.g. ISO 11783
    (ISOBUS) developed by the Agricultural Industry Electronics Foundation (AEF) for
    tractors and agricultural machinery, which is very relevant in arable farming
    (Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015, Miettinen et al., 2006, Oksanen et al., 2015,
    Peets et al., 2012) or AgroXML developed by the Association for Technologies and
    Structures in Agriculture (KTBL) mainly for FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014, Köksal
    and Tekinerdogan, 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Peets et al., 2012). These
    are now being integrated by the non-profit organisation AgGateway through the
    ADAPT framework and SPADE project for seamlessly communicating agricultural machinery
    data to FMIS, trying to enhance the existing standards and as a consequence improve
    interoperability (Brewster et al., 2017). A drawback of comprehensive data models,
    which try to describe all attributes of agricultural data, is that they become
    too cumbersome to handle in many applications. Finally, the use of middleware
    platforms applicable in smart farming, e.g. FIWARE or SmartFarmNet, can also reduce
    the problems caused by data heterogeneity (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Ferreira
    et al., 2017, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). 5.1.3. Scalability
    and flexibility Organisational interoperability is a key element concerning scalability
    and flexibility (Serrano et al., 2015, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). Many
    of the systems described in the literature reviewed are centralised, closed, difficult
    to integrate in other existing platforms or difficult to implement on larger scales,
    different farming systems or geographical areas. They are also challenging to
    integrate beyond the farm level and across the supply chain in order to provide
    agri-food safety and traceability. The use of standardised dynamic protocols,
    such as SOAP protocol (cloud-based infrastructures with extensible ontologies
    that cover the broad and diverse agricultural production systems and environments),
    fast and reliable APIs (e.g. RESTful) and middleware platforms applicable for
    smart agriculture, such as FIWARE with its generic enablers, are tools that are
    employed to achieve organisational interoperability and make the system developed
    more scalable and flexible (Ferreira et al., 2017, López-Riquelme et al., 2017,
    O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). Service-Oriented Architectures
    (SOA) also bring possibilities to effectively integrate ecosystems through open
    and standardised interfaces, increasing organisational interoperability (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014, Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Kruize et al., 2016, Pesonen et al.,
    2014, Sørensen and Bochtis, 2010). Scalability and flexibility may also refer
    to WSNs in the literature, to their capacity to support an increasing number of
    devices/nodes, with the network architecture, the gateway and protocols used being
    the main constrains (Elijah et al., 2018). This challenge has been considered
    under the network size challenge. 5.1.4. Robustness and fault tolerance Many different
    factors can affect the overall robustness and fault tolerance of a system. Robust
    wireless connectivity is an important limitation in many setups (Oksanen et al.,
    2016, Vuran et al., 2018). In the design of an IoT-based solution dealing with
    faults, errors and unforeseen events need to be taken into account in order to
    ensure the reliability of the system. Many of these issues are related to the
    other challenges presented here and can be handled at the device level, but also
    need to be thought of in the overall IoT system design (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    Ray, 2017). 5.1.5. Complexity The agricultural system is complex and can be challenging
    to work with. It is complex not only because of the multifaceted nature of the
    physical, chemical and/or biological processes in the soil-crop-air system, but
    also because of the technical complexity of hardware and software interacting
    with it. Depending on the novelty of the IoT technology implemented and the background
    of the developer and user, the systems can become more or less complex. For example,
    software and hardware incompatibilities can challenge its implementation and integration
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016), as well as many other challenges, e.g. the great
    field task diversity in arable farming, that can add complexity to the system.
    Technical knowledge can become a major hurdle for the implementation of IoT in
    farms, and it is therefore important that user-friendliness and plug-and-play
    basis have a high priority for the technology providers (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Zou and Quan, 2017). Complexity should be an issue for the technology provider
    and not for the customer. In addition, the co-created development and implementation
    of IoT systems in agriculture by a multi-actor approach is needed to overcome
    the complexity at different levels of integrating IoT in agriculture. Good examples
    of this are the European Union supported research and development efforts through
    multi-actor large-scale pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Verdouw et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019). 5.1.6. Lack of products In the early stages of precision
    agriculture and IoT in agriculture, products that integrated agronomy and ICT
    engineering were lacking, which hindered their adoption (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Kitchen and Roger, 2007). The large scales and diversity of environments
    in arable farming can challenge the products used even more than in controlled
    environments, as they are to be modelled to describe larger areas, send information
    through larger distances and be exposed to harsher environments. Even if Figure
    5 shows lack of references in the last couple of years, it is still relevant for
    some applications, e.g. for in-situ real-time soil nutrient sensing is still a
    real challenge, especially regarding calibration (Bünemann et al., 2018, Marín-González
    et al., 2013). 5.2. Device layer challenges 5.2.1. Power consumption The use of
    wireless devices has major advantages over wired systems, as they are more economical
    to establish and can cover much wider areas. However, their power consumption,
    with limited battery life, is a major drawback of many wireless systems, and needs
    to be accounted for. This issue is so important that it is the main identified
    challenge in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5), especially for WSNs (Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tan and Panda, 2010). The large distances to cover in arable farming make
    wireless devices indispensable, and solutions to reduce their power consumption
    and/or extend their battery life are required. These solutions can include energy
    harvesting, low power consumption sensors and communication technologies or power
    efficient management. Energy harvesting techniques can include solar cells, micro
    wind turbines or other interesting solutions which have been well described by
    Tuna and Gungor (2016) and Jawad et al. (2017). The power consumption of the communication
    technologies and sensors employed are also to be considered in the design of the
    IoT solution as there are big differences between devices (Balmos et al., 2016,
    Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). Choosing low power sensors
    and communication devices needs to be taken into account when designing the IoT
    system (Estrada-López et al., 2018). Low power wireless technologies, such as
    BLE, have low power consumption but also low communication range, while Wi-Fi
    has somewhat higher communication range, but much higher power consumption (Table
    1), however data rates and other parameters are important factors to consider
    too. ZigBee and LoRa have been identified as appropriate candidates for many farming
    applications (Jawad et al., 2017). Power efficient management techniques of WSNs
    include sleep/active schemes, e.g. duty-cycling algorithms (Ahmed, Abdalla et
    al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Alahmadi et al., 2017, Balmos et al., 2016,
    Dhall and Agrawal, 2018, Temprilho et al., 2018); data mitigation schemes, e.g.
    data aggregation (Abdel-basset, Shawky, & Eldrandaly, 2018) or data compression
    (Moon et al., 2018); energy-efficient routing schemes, e.g. mobile sinks by the
    use of UAVs (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018,
    Uddin et al., 2018); and other combined solutions, e.g. LEACH, a cluster architecture
    with Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) based MAC protocol and data aggregation
    scheme (Kamarudin, Ahmad, & Ndzi, 2016), or dynamic power management by combining
    sleep/active states with dynamic data rates schemes (Estrada-López et al., 2018).
    Jawad et al. (2017) have provided a good overview and description of WSN power
    efficient management techniques. Lastly, techniques such as edge computing may
    have higher power requirements on the device, making cloud computing more desirable
    if power consumption is a constraint in the projected IoT solution. On the other
    hand, mounting sensors and devices on agricultural vehicles and implements allows
    connection to the power supply of the vehicle and as a consequence eliminate power
    consumption as a limiting factor. The type of sensors that are mounted on vehicles
    and their implements is quite limited, being currently mainly camera-based (e.g.
    Midtiby et al., 2018, Steen et al., 2012). Nevertheless, there is for example
    potential in employing sensors on the coulters of seed-drills for mapping soil
    properties (Nielsen et al., 2017), or other on-the-go sensors for mapping soil
    or crop variations (Peets et al., 2012). 5.2.2. Harsh device environment The natural
    environment in which sensors and other devices are placed can greatly challenge
    their functionality and longevity. Harsh weather conditions, e.g. large temperature
    variations, intense rainfall or prolonged high humidity can cause water condensation
    inside devices and consequently provoke corrosion and short circuits (Bauer &
    Aschenbruck, 2018). Sensors and other devices situated close to the ground experience
    exposure to dust, mud, or even corrosive chemicals, e.g. agro-chemicals, which
    can seriously damage the performance of the device or cause its total failure
    (Aliev, 2018, Bauer and Aschenbruck, 2018). Underground chemical sensors are also
    exposed to soil chemical and biological processes that deteriorate the sensors
    and can mislead the measurements, requiring unfeasible maintenance and re-calibrations
    (Burton et al., 2018, Kassal et al., 2018). Choosing adequate casing that does
    not interfere with the functionality of the device and also tolerates the environment
    they are located in is essential in the design of the IoT system. Sensors are
    also developed for different conditions, and need to match the system''s minimum
    requirements. RFID tags have been reported to perform flawlessly under extreme
    conditions and environments (Costa et al., 2013, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011);
    however, RFID technology is quite limited in its applications in arable farming,
    and suitable sensors and communication devices are therefore primarily dependent
    on the application and design of the IoT system. 5.3. Network layer challenges
    5.3.1. Latency, throughput and rate The large amounts of data generated in IoT
    applications do not only cause problems regarding data storage or handling, but
    also latency problems that reduce the throughput of the network employed. In arable
    farming, latency problems can be of great importance in some IoT solutions, e.g.
    in WSNs where high latency implies higher power consumption of a node (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017), or in dynamic optimised route planning in vehicle logistics, which
    requires rapid responses to deviations in the route plan (Villa-Henriksen et al.,
    2018). For reducing latency problems, fog and edge computing can be employed,
    as these computing techniques decrease latency and network congestion (Elijah
    et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018), e.g. data compression at the edge
    reduces the large volumes of data communicated through the network (Moon et al.,
    2018). In addition, the use of lightweight protocols can also reduce latency problems,
    e.g. LP4S for sensors (Hernández-rojas, Fernández-Caramés, Fraga-Lamas, & Escudero,
    2018), or MQTT messaging protocol, which has a faster throughput than HTTP and
    works well for bandwidth limited networks (Estrada-López et al., 2018). The communication
    rate is important to have in mind when planning the wireless communication technology
    to implement, e.g. 5G can handle high-rates, while SigFox or IEEE 802.15.4-based
    protocols are for low-rates (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton,
    Gotta et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). The throughput of the network affects
    the communication rate, and the communication rate also influences the power consumption,
    which equally has to be carefully considered. Fast response to events is achieved
    by data processing techniques such as data merging (Tanaka, 2018), data compression
    (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018), or dynamic and complex event
    processing rules for conditioning input data and immediately acting accordingly
    (Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018). These processes can be on the cloud or at the edge,
    i.e. devices. Finally, test-bed analysis prior to implementation of the network
    can simulate communication rates and possible latency and throughput issues (Stewart,
    Stewart, & Kennedy, 2017). 5.3.2. Wireless link quality A low wireless link quality
    affects greatly the QoS of an IoT system as it ends in unreliable communication
    between nodes (Klaina, Alejos, Aghzout, & Falcone, 2018). This can be caused by
    multipath propagation (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), background noise (Mazon-Olivo
    et al., 2018), routing problems, e.g. packet collision or limited band width (Jawad
    et al., 2017), or even by harsh environmental conditions, which affect the transceivers
    and the quality of the data transmitted (Elijah et al., 2018). Adequate design
    and testing of the network are crucial for avoiding or reducing this challenge.
    However, techniques such as channel access methods, e.g. TDMA, can improve the
    link quality by reducing packet collisions (Temprilho et al., 2018). Regarding
    testing, the calculation of signal strengths in real-time on the base station
    helps estimating the wireless link quality of a WSN when establishing the system
    (Klaina et al., 2018). Packet loss characterisation can also be used to assess
    the wireless link quality of a connection (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018,
    Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018). Additionally, blind entity identification
    can also help estimating the wireless link quality of a network (Mukherjee, Misra,
    Raghuwanshi, & Mitra, 2018). 5.3.3. Communication range The different wireless
    communication technologies have very diverse ranges, which need to be accounted
    for when designing the IoT solution, together with other factors such as data
    rate, power consumption, communication protocols or costs (Table 1). In arable
    farming, due to the larger farm sizes and because of the employment of mobile
    sensors and devices on vehicles, this challenge becomes even more critical. Furthermore,
    relying on the approximate communication range of a wireless technology can be
    misleading, e.g. WiFi is often described to have 100 m range, but a test analysing
    the packet delivery ratio with respect to distance to gateway shows packet losses
    at ≥ 60 m (Giordano, Seitanidis, Ojo, Adami, & Vignoli, 2018), while in another
    test using WiField devices, 2.6 km range was claimed to be reached still having
    reliable internet connection (Brinkhoff et al., 2017). Testing the communication
    range is therefore important for some settings. In addition to the choice of wireless
    technology, network topology in WSNs, such as mesh topologies can also increase
    the communication range by using nodes to communicate with the central node (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018). Reduced range due to obstacles
    or topography is addressed in the propagation losses challenge later. 5.3.4. Communication
    protocols Differences in communication protocols can cause technical interoperability
    issues, which can lead to connectivity and compatibility issues among the hardware
    and software employed (Stočes et al., 2016). Network protocols are separated into
    diverse layers forming a protocol stack, where tasks are divided into smaller
    steps (Suhonen, Kohvakka, Kaseva, Hämäläinen, & Hännikäinen, 2012). In the infrastructure
    layer, some wireless standards that define communication protocols are commonly
    used by different wireless technologies, e.g. IEEE 802.15.4, which is used by
    ZigBee or 6LowPAN among others, or 3GPP, which is used by GPRS, LTE or 5G among
    others (see Table 1). In the application layer, standards such as HTTP (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Kaloxylos et al., 2014), MQTT (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016, Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018) or XMPP (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018)
    are commonly used in IoT applications in arable farming. Adequate protocols are
    especially relevant and challenging in vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and crucial
    in arable farming. Different standards in different layers require careful planning
    of the whole IoT solution, as they are not always compatible and can also have
    an effect on the data formats used, or sensors and gateways employed (Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018). Middleware platforms can ease the integration of diverse protocols
    and standards by offering enough abstraction levels so that this diversity is
    effectively managed (O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Tuna et al., 2017). Edge computing
    can also ease technical interoperability issues as a local computing layer is
    created to process data and create control rules before sending the data to the
    cloud (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). 5.3.5. Network management Managing a WSN
    can imply battery change, software updates, calibration of sensors, replacement
    of devices and similar maintenance activities that can be very time-consuming.
    Smart mobile devices, e.g. smart phones, can make remote software updating possible,
    and can sometimes even be used for updating some other IoT devices (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016). Using energy efficient devices and communication techniques can
    also be employed to extend the battery life of devices (Jawad et al., 2017). Some
    sensors may require recalibrations with a certain periodicity, which has to be
    accounted for in the projected IoT solution (Kassal et al., 2018). Nonetheless,
    the management of the network is always to be considered when implementing IoT
    solutions in arable farming, where distances and number of devices/nodes can be
    vast. 5.3.6. Network size WSN configuration schemes have a maximum number of sensor
    nodes per gateway that the network can handle, i.e. the network size. According
    to the analysis of the reviewed literature, network size is being identified more
    often in the last two years (see Fig. 5), which seems to indicate new possibilities
    for exploiting the capabilities of WSNs. Network size depends on the wireless
    communication technology employed and can affect other parameters, such as data
    latency or scalability of the network (Balmos et al., 2016). Network topologies
    can also influence the network size and vary from simple star network (e.g. Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018) to more advanced multi-hop mesh networks (Ahmed, Abdalla et al.,
    2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Langendoen et al., 2006) that can increase the network
    size by using network nodes as relays to reach a central node and gateway. Optimisation
    algorithms have been used to find the best spatial distribution of WSN nodes,
    and therefore to assist in the optimisation of its network size (Abdel-basset
    et al., 2018). 5.3.7. Propagation losses Even though propagation losses can become
    a big problem for WSNs in application areas like fruit orchards and tree plantations,
    in arable farming hedges, trees, big rocks or sheds, as well as pronounced topography,
    like hills and valleys, can also block, diffract or scatter the signal reducing
    the communication range and causing data packet losses. Additionally, weather
    conditions can also degrade the wireless connectivity propagation of signals (Jawad
    et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Stewart et al., 2017). To avoid or reduce
    these problems, adequate planning of the location of the sensor nodes, the antenna
    height, the communication protocols and the network topology is necessary. Regarding
    network topologies, mesh networks compared to star networks can reduce propagation
    losses as well as increase communication range (Kamarudin et al., 2016, Ruiz-Garcia
    and Lunadei, 2011). Moreover, propagation modelling can help planning, reduce
    communication tests and ensure Quality of Service (QoS) for heterogeneous wireless
    networks (Jawad et al., 2017, Stewart et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Klaina
    et al., 2018, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011). 5.4. Application layer challenges
    5.4.1. Data analysis Data analysis can in some cases become an important challenge,
    especially when dealing with Big Data, which is data in such amounts, heterogeneity
    and complexity that they need new data management techniques for analysis (Wolfert
    et al., 2017). Agricultural Big Data are worthless unless analysed; however, analysis
    can be very challenging because of the volume, diversity, and quality (e.g. errors
    and duplications). This is especially challenging in arable farming, where larger
    amounts of heterogeneous data are generated at diverse rates and from very different
    sources. The literature reviewed show an increased identification of this challenge
    in the last two years compared with the previous 6 years (see Fig. 5). This evolution
    might be caused by increased access and use of agricultural Big Data in recent
    times (Kamilaris et al., 2017, Pham and Stack, 2018). Techniques for lowering
    data dimensionality can ease the analysis by applying feature reduction models,
    which reduce data size by eliminating unnecessary data dimensions (Sabarina &
    Priya, 2015). Cloud computing provides the flexibility and scalability necessary
    for Big Data analysis, where numerous users operate simultaneously with the large
    and complex datasets (Gill et al., 2017). Likewise, cloud platforms are perfect
    for storing such large amounts of data, where NoSQL databases can store and manage
    these large unstructured datasets (Kamilaris et al., 2017). The analysis of Big
    Data can potentially be used, for example, for policy-making, reducing environmental
    negative impact, improve food-safety, as well as improved farm management and
    production, benefiting the different stakeholders involved (Kamilaris et al.,
    2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). Another facet to data analysis is the growing use
    of machine learning techniques, which are being used for exploring Big Data and
    identifying important factors and their interrelationship that affect agricultural
    production systems like, for example, identifying diverse patterns (e.g. crop
    development stages, weeds or diseases) as part of machine vision systems (Bacco,
    Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018, Reshma and Pillai,
    2018). In these cases, the model is built upon a sample of data, often called
    training data, whose size and quality directly affects the final model. Choosing
    the adequate approach for building the model with the available data is also essential
    for the success of the IoT solution. 5.4.2. Data security and privacy Even though
    data security and privacy do not constitute a high challenge in the literature
    reviewed, they are certainly major concerns for the farmers, i.e. the suppliers
    of data and also end-users of the technology developed, who have little trust
    in service providers'' use of data (Jayashankar et al., 2018, Zhang et al., 2017).
    Also, data ownership needs to be taken into consideration as raw data and processed
    data in IoT systems have different ownership and are accessible by different actors,
    affecting the necessary requirements for data security and privacy (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). Research and development focus has been on sensing, processing,
    controlling and computing, while less effort has been devoted to solving security
    threats, risks and privacy (Tuna et al., 2017). Other issues like cost effectiveness
    in, for example, cloud services are also affecting the security of the data, which
    eventually affects the whole privacy and security of the IoT solution, as low-cost
    services have lower security (Dhinari, Newe, Lewis, & Nizamani, 2017). Technology
    providers should prioritise data security and privacy in their business models.
    The availability of privacy and security technologies that are dynamic enough
    to support the vast numbers and variety of stakeholders, as well as the complexity
    of the network, is still a major challenge that needs to be overcome (Verdouw,
    2016). Many solutions are being employed to reduce data security and privacy issues
    in each of the IoT layers of the system, e.g. encryption algorithms, intrusion
    detection mechanisms, authentication, secure routing protocols, anonymisation,
    etc. (Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Middleware platforms are employed
    to add a security layer between network and applications, which can include confidentiality,
    anonymity and security to the system (Rodriguez et al., 2018, Serrano et al.,
    2015, Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Additionally, newer technologies
    such as blockchain are aiming to solve many of the challenges related to privacy
    and security as well as transparency of the IoT. In agriculture, it is mainly
    being applied in the food supply chain (Bermeo-Almeida et al., 2018). Blockchain
    make sense for IoT platforms where large amounts of confidential data are handled.
    5.4.3. Data quality and availability Some of the challenges previously described
    have a direct influence on data quality, e.g. propagation losses, wireless link
    quality, robustness and fault tolerance. Anomaly detection and similar methods
    have been employed to identify faulty data before analysis (Cadavid et al., 2018,
    Lyle et al., 2014). The poor quality of data or its limited availability can limit
    many applications that involve Big Data analytics, modelling and machine learning,
    which can affect or even compromise the success of some IoT solutions (Balducci
    et al., 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). In these setups,
    and specifically in arable farming, many datasets are integrated from different
    sources and sensors, and the quality or scarcity of some data can become a major
    hurdle to overcome. Ensuring quality and availability of the data before starting
    such a project is required. Even if it is not always possible to gather all the
    data necessary to develop models, perform correct analytics or train machine learning
    algorithms, scientific assumptions (Severino et al., 2018), data augmentation
    (Diedrichs et al., 2018) or simulated data (Wolanin et al., 2019) are used to
    help or solve the encountered challenge. 5.4.4. Context-awareness (metadata) Context-awareness
    is an important and distinctive feature of Smart Farming as compared to Precision
    Farming, because it automatically includes descriptive data from e.g. fields,
    sensors, machines, i.e. metadata. Metadata can include information about the date
    and time, node identification number, data of calibration, height and position
    information, or even descriptive data about an experiment objective, field, machinery,
    crop genotype or soil information at the sensor placement (Jayaraman et al., 2015).
    Metadata about sensor nodes in the system are crucial for providing contextual
    information so that correct data analysis can be performed (Jayaraman et al.,
    2016, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness helps computing techniques to decide what
    data is to be analysed, and consequently easing the computations, and the lack
    of this data complicate data analysis substantially. This is especially relevant
    in arable farming, where the system has to handle both spatial and temporal data
    and make decisions based on the data collected. The use of standards, formats
    and middleware that support metadata is therefore important to have in mind during
    the planning of an IoT solution (Peets et al., 2009, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness
    facilitates new business models and strategies for data analytics and DSS software
    providers. 6. Conclusions and future perspectives A literature review of current
    and foreseeable IoT technologies and systems in arable farming was carried out.
    This has included an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies, an
    outline of the current and potential applications, and a thorough description
    of the challenges and solutions. From this survey, the role smart mobile phones
    play is highlighted, especially Android devices, which are employed in different
    ways for a wide diversity of applications, due to their availability, connectivity,
    interoperability, programmable ease and computational power. The introduction
    of 5G networks in the near future will enhance the capabilities of smart mobile
    devices due to their enhanced performance. The intelligent management of WSN as
    well as the capabilities of improved communication technologies can also solve
    some of the challenges IoT-based solutions are experiencing. The role of middleware
    platforms and generic enablers are expected to gain acceptance and importance,
    as they can solve system integration issues and interoperability challenges. In
    general, regarding challenges, interoperability is a main challenge throughout
    the whole IoT architecture, where development and/or acceptance of standards and
    protocols is required to ease the issues encountered by many IoT implementations.
    Furthermore, challenges such as revenue and affordability of IoT systems, the
    power consumption of wireless devices, latency and throughput problems during
    data transfer, as well as the complexity of data analysis, and data privacy and
    security have been identified in the reviewed literature as of high importance,
    and academic research should direct their resources toward solving or reducing
    these issues. Technology developers need to ensure that the solutions create a
    real benefit for farmers and are available and applicable for both large and small
    producers. How IoT generated farm data will affect the business models of farmers
    requires further investigation as it is not fully addressed in the literature
    reviewed. The combination of intelligent power efficient systems with power harvesting
    technologies should guarantee longer battery-life of wireless devices. Computing
    data at the edge, i.e. on the devices, as well as lightweight protocols can reduce
    network latency and capacity/throughput problems. The emergence of Big Data is
    posing significant challenges for data analysis, as the complexity and heterogeneity
    of the huge data sets require the application of new analysis techniques beyond
    those traditionally used. Techniques such as lowering data dimensionality, cloud
    platforms and cloud computing, including machine learning algorithms, can help
    in this area and new innovative solutions are expected to be developed. Finally,
    technology producers have to guarantee privacy and security of the data handled
    throughout all the layers by employing different secure methods without compromising
    the user-friendliness of the solutions employed. Middleware platforms can help
    improving the privacy and security of IoT solutions, and techniques such as blockchain
    can assist with privacy and security problems of IoT platforms when dealing with
    Big Data. In the near future, interoperable and service-oriented FMIS that are
    integrated in the supply chain with intelligent analytic tools will take over
    some of the management and decision-making tasks of farmers and advisors, which
    will require training for farmers to adapt to this type of FMIS. Key decision
    support functions include farm financial analysis, business processes, or supply
    chain functions, which will gain importance with Big Data analytics. In addition,
    DSS for vehicle logistics will grow in importance as a way to optimise field operations
    using route planning and sensor-based site-specific applications. Finally, the
    introduction of autonomous vehicles and robotics in arable farming in the near
    future is expected to completely change arable farming operations and production
    praxes requiring fully adopted IoT capabilities. Acknowledgements This work was

    able to perceive, access, and even control. By connecting various “Things” to the Internet, the IoT makes\n\
    it possible to measure and manage the physical world as needed. As one of the most widely adopted Low\n\
    Power Wide Area network technologies, the Long-Range-Radio (LoRa) has the features of long range,\n\
    low  power,  and  robustness,  and  thus  plays  an  important  role  in  building\
    \  IoT  applications  where  IoT\nobjects are connected to the internet at affordable costs. Since the development of LoRa, many IoT appli-\n\
    cations have adopted LoRa and achieved success in the market. Currently, IoT technologies keep evolv-\n\
    ing towards different fields, giving rise to multifarious IoT applications including industrial IoT, smart\n\
    city IoT, healthcare IoT, and direct-to-satellite IoT. In the meantime, LoRa also keeps developing and\n\
    finding its position in various IoT applications either as a main or complementary player. The objective\n\
    of this survey is to (1) provide a fundamental understanding of the LoRa technology; (2) explore research\n\
    activities studying LoRa based communication systems for new IoT applications; and (3) demonstrate\n\
    how the LoRa technology works together with other technologies to deliver better IoT services to end\n\
    users.\nKeywords: internet of things; long range radio; low power wide area network\n\
     \n1. Introduction\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a set of technologies cooperating to network the physical world [1], and\n\
    aims to interconnect everything and enable proper processing on the collected data in order to support high-level\n\
    decision making. Early in 1999, Kevin Aston [2] used the term “Internet of Things” to describe a system using radio\n\
    frequency identification (RFID) to keep tracking and monitoring on goods in supply chain management. In his idea,\n\
    an object is possible to be automatically recognized, recorded and analyzed if it can be identified by machines. As\n\
    defined  by  ITU  (International  Telecommunication  Union)  [3],  an  IoT  system\
    \  consists  of  three  components:  the\ndevice,  IoT  and  thing.  The  device\
    \  is  “ a  piece  of  equipment  with  mandatory  capabilities  of  communication\
    \  and\noptional capabilities of sensing, actuation, data capture, data storage and data processing”. The IoT refers to “a global\n\
    infrastructure for the information society, enabling advanced services by interconnecting (physical and virtual) things\n\
    based on existing and evolving interoperable information and communication technologies”. The thing refers to “an\n\
    object of the physical world (physical things) or the information world (virtual things), which is capable of being\n\
    identified and integrated into communication networks”. A simplified IoT application is shown in Figure 1.\n\
    International Journal of Network Dynamics and Intelligence\n \nhttps://www.sciltp.com/journals/ijndi\n\
    A volcano (i.e. the Thing) cannot talk to human being until its characteristics is “translated” into a digital for-\n\
    mat by “Device”, e.g. a temperature sensor. Since it is not convenient to have personnel watch the sensor all day\n\
    long, it is necessary to have a way to transfer data to a remote site. Deploying a temperature sensor (i.e. devices with\n\
    optional capabilities) with a communication module (i.e. device with mandatory capabilities) which has connections\n\
    to the Internet is considered as a proper solution, namely IoT. The challenges of building an IoT system come from\n\
    the establishment of links between the network and the far-away physical devices, e.g. a refrigerator, an air condi-\n\
    tioner and a temperature/humidity sensor. Such devices usually work individually, generate a small volume of data,\n\
    and sometimes ask for low power consumption. For example, an electricity meter is installed in a metal cabinet in the\n\
    cellar of a house, and is able to report energy readings every 15 minutes. Each reporting consists of a four-byte meter\n\
    reading and a 13 bytes overhead [4]. Typically, a community has hundreds of meters in operation. Since meters are\n\
    installed in the cellar of house, deploying cables for meters to be connected to network may have difficulty and there-\n\
    fore, applying wireless communication seems to be a promising solution [4−6]. However, wireless communication is\n\
    prone to failures due to various factors, including building materials, interior structures of houses/buildings and other\n\
    radio systems coexisting in the same area [7]. To obtain better link budget, the narrow band (NB) wireless technol-\n\
    ogy is a preferable choice that outperforms the wide-band wireless technology in the processing gains and radio sen-\n\
    sitivity, and is usually summarized as the low power wide area network (LPWAN) technology [8].\n\
    As concluded in [9], typical LPWAN technologies include long range radio wide area network (LoRaWAN),\n\
    NB-IoT, SigFox, and Wi-Sun that are designed for connecting large number of low-cost, low power consumption\n\
    and low throughput end devices with large coverage areas. Generally, LoRaWAN and SigFox can achieve a conver-\n\
    gence area larger than 10 kilometers’ communication range [10]. NB-IoT makes use of the widely deployed base\n\
    stations to achieve city level coverage. Wi-Sun is an enterprise–grade mesh network technology [11]. Each of\n\
    the aforementioned technologies has its own characteristic for certain scenarios. For instance, LoRaWAN is suitable\n\
    for applications requiring low data rate, low power consumption, and feasible deployment regarding private or public\n\
    network access. SigFox is appropriate for applications asking for ultra-low data rate and power consumption. NB-IoT\n\
    is a low power consumption technology but requires public network access. Wi-Sun is good for smart city applica-\n\
    tions but needs complex network operation management.\nThis survey aims to (1) introduce the concept of LoRa techniques and provide a fundamental understanding of\n\
    LoRa communication; (2) explore research activities studying LoRa based IoT applications; and (3) demonstrate how\n\
    LoRa techniques working together with other technologies to deliver better services to end users in emerging IoT\n\
    application areas. Particularly, the research activities carried out to resolve LoRa communication issues for specific\n\
    IoT areas are studied, such as communication protocol, performance optimization, and application deployment. There\n\
    are lots of LoRa related survey papers made by researchers that summarize and discuss LoRa technologies. In [12]\n\
    authors made comparisons between LoRa and NB-IoT at issues of physical layer design, battery consumption, net-\n\
    work coverage, deployment model and cost. In [13,14], the authors provided a comprehensive survey for LoRa tech-\n\
    nique, including performance of modulation technology, Medium Access Control protocol design, LoRa security and\n\
    list of LoRa applications. Moreover, in [15], the LoRa technique was analyzed from down to top to show current\n\
    research effort on improving performance metrics related to LoRa. Compared with previous surveys, our contribu-\n\
    tion  is  to  summarize  the  use  of  LoRa  along  with  requirements  in  different\
    \  IoT  application  fields.  Continuously\nemerging IoT applications/fields are the major motivation in driving the evolvement of LoRa techniques, giving rise\n\
    to not only new enhancement and optimization at certain technical points, but also new paradigm of LoRa applica-\n\
    tion along with other technologies. As such, it is of great importance to review the LoRa research by taking it as an\n\
    important constituent part of the IoT applications.\nThe rest of this survey is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses characteristics of different IoT fields and\n\
    their requirements to LoRa technique. Section 3 introduces basic concept of LoRa radio communication and research\n\
    studies on LoRa modulation schemes and performance optimization. In Sections 4, 5, 6 and 7, the adoption of LoRa\n\

    reviewed and discussed. Conclusion about the development trend of LoRa in the concept of IoT is made in Section 8.\n\
    2. Iot and LoRa\nExactly speaking, the IoT is not an individual technology but a comprehensive concept covering tremendous\n\
    technologies and evolving with the development of information and communication technologies. The IoT is in fact\n\
    an evolution of mobile, embedded applications and everything that is connected to the internet [16], which generates\n\
    urgent needs for a new paradigm of data collection and processing. Furthermore, the IoT is an expansion of conven-\n\
    tional network technologies in a sense whose core concept is to build interconnections among “Things” and further\n\
    have the physical world networked.\nNowadays, more and more IoT related applications emerge as either new market spaces develop or existing\n\
    technologies upgrade, which pushes an evolution of IoT technologies in different fields. One feature of IoT applica-\n\
    tions is the diversity of communication requirements which is also the main difference between conventional com-\n\
    munications and IoT communications. In conventional applications, the Internet connected devices, such as comput-\n\
    ers, tablets, and mobile phones, are mainly controlled by humans with stable network connections, whereas in IoT\n\
    applications, the scope of devices connecting to the Internet are extended to every kind of devices, including sensors,\n\
    actuators and tags [17]. Development of the IoT contains not only conventional systems, but also comprehensive\n\
    interactions introduced by “Smart Objects” (e.g. sophisticated smart gadgets, smartphones, and smart vehicles) which\n\
    exhibit different degrees of intelligence in data processing and communication with conventional systems [18].\n\
    To be specific, the Video-on-Demand service is a typical application using conventional communication tech-\n\
    nologies. Video programs are pre-stored on servers, and TV terminals can request certain program from a server\n\
    nearby. The communication content is almost fixed and the traffic over communication links is predictable. Note that\n\
    the  entire  system  works  in  a  closed-loop  manner  as  insertion  of  new\
    \  programs,  increment  of  subscriptions,  and\ncapacity of networks are always under control. Using distributed sensors to help manage smart agriculture is a popu-\n\
    lar application of IoT. Various sensors connect to local edge servers to provide real-time sensory data critical to the\n\
    crops. The edge server makes decisions, e.g. irrigation or sowing, based on the received data. The source of data\n\
    comes from real-world, which means the major challenges imposed on IoT communications come from aspects of\n\
    data volume, variety, veracity and velocity [19].\nMany IoT applications require long range, low data rate, low energy consumption and cost effective wireless\n\
    communication [20]. As one of LPWAN technologies, the LoRa has the most technical advantages required by IoT\n\
    applications. Particularly,  the  open  design  (except  for  physical  layers)\
    \  feature  of  the  LoRa  provides  great   conve-\nnience for researchers and developers to study and use. In general, IoT applications requiring the involvement of\n\
    LoRa technique possess two common characteristics: wireless communication in difficult radio environment and low\n\
    data rate [21−23]. Difficult environment refers to interferences and long range communications that many IoT appli-\n\
    cations have to face when deploying networks. Low data rate means only IoT applications requiring small data can\n\
    adopt LoRa. In the following sections, the LoRa radio and representative IoT fields in which LoRa is a main or sup-\n\
    plementary player in building wireless communication links are selected and discussed to explore research activities\n\
    made for the use of LoRa. The typical IoT fields include industrial IoT, smart city IoT, healthcare IoT, agriculture\n\
    IoT, and DtS-IoT [17,24].\n3. LoRa Radio Communication\nLoRa is a narrowband communication technology patented by Semtech [25], and is a kind of physical layer\n\
    modulation  technologies  that  utilize  Chirp  (Compressed  High  Intensity  Radar\
    \  Pulse)  Spread  Spectrum  (CSS)  to\nachieve significant long communication range and robustness to interference on the premise of low power consump-\n\
    tion [26, 27], and this is also the key to make LoRa stay competitive compared with other LPWAN technologies. A\n\
    comparison between LoRa and other mainstream IoT wireless communication technologies is listed in [28−31].\n\
    The IoT wireless communication technologies listed in Table 1 can help end devices build links to networks.\n\
    However, such technologies can only be applicable to certain application fields due to their technology differences.\n\
    NB-IoT and SigFox can achieve long range communication, and are unsuitable for applications requiring use of local\n\
    area networks. This is because NB-IoT and SigFox establish direct links between end devices and operators’ net-\n\
    works (i.e. public networks). Wi-Fi and Bluetooth can provide relative high data rate and are suitable for multimedia\n\
    applications. As a trade-off, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth consume more energy compared with other technologies. ZigBee is\n\
    a low cost and low power consumption technology for short-range IoT applications, and thus has limited coverage. In\n\
    contrast,  LoRa  can  provide  dynamic  radio  coverage  for  large-scale  IoT\
    \  applications  which  require  long  lifetime,\nwhereas the main shortage of LoRa comes from its low data rate.\n\

     \nApplication  scenarios  in  which  LoRa  outperforms  than  other  technologies\
    \  include  logistics  tracking,  assert\ntracking, smart agriculture, healthcare, etc. [32]. An important characteristic of these scenarios is uncertain communi-\n\
    cation range, which can be a few meters or up to a few kilometers. Excellent design of receiving sensitivity makes\n\
    LoRa capable of covering large area with limited power supply. On the contrary, it is clear that LoRa is not suitable\n\
    for high data rate applications whose major candidates are Wi-Fi or Bluetooth based technologies. Performance of\n\
    LoRa modem is configurable through a few parameters, which typically include: spreading factor (SF), bandwidth\n\
    (BW), and coding rate (CR) [33].\n● Spreading Factor (SF)\nSF represents the level that the spread spectrum algorithm works on each bit. The higher the SF is, the more\n\
    spreading code will be used for each bit. Consequently, the receiving sensitivity at the receiver side improves c. LoRa\n\
    supports SF ranges from 6 to 12.\n● Bandwidth (BW)\nBandwidth is directly related to the data rate. If a higher bandwidth is used, a higher data rate can be achieved at\n\
    the cost of reduced receiving sensitivity. In the contrary, a smaller bandwidth is helpful in obtaining better receiver\n\
    sensitivity, but data rate decreases accordingly. The BW option supported by LoRa ranges from 7.8 kHz to 500 kHz\n\
    (at Sub-1 GHz frequency band).\n● Error Correction Rate (ECR)\nCyclic error coding is employed as the forward error detection and correction scheme in the LoRa technology.\n\
    The higher the CR value is, the stronger capability of error correction can be achieved. However, additional overhead\n\
    is included in transmission which reduces effective user data rate. LoRa modem supports CR from 4/5 to 4/8. The\n\
    overhead ratio for different CR is shown in Table 2\n \n \nTable 2    Cyclic coding overhead\n\

    \  kbps  to  37.5  kbps.  Corresponding  receiving  sensitivity\nranges  from\
    \  −111  dBm  to  −148  dBm,  and  is  achieved  by  selecting  different  combinations\

    IJNDI, 2022, 1(1): 4−19. https://doi.org/10.53941/ijndi0101002\n \n7\nAs stated in [34], LoRa can provide over 150 dB link budget for long range communication. When installed at\n\
    fixed position and configured with certain settings (14 dBm tx power, BW = 125 kHz, SF = 12), a LoRa gateway can\n\
    achieve 62% packet delivery rate at range of 15-30 km, 88% and 85% at range of 2 and 5 km. Regarding mobile sit-\n\
    uation, a reliable communication link can be established if relative speed is lower than 25 km/h. Significant packet\n\
    loss is observed when relative speed is close to or over 40 km/h. The test results show that LoRa modem is capable\n\
    of providing service in either stationary or mobile scenarios.\nIoT applications, such as environment monitoring, smart metering, plant monitoring, etc., require massive and\n\
    large deployment, but very few data payload which could be as small as one byte to indicate On or Off states. The\n\
    corresponding data report interval could be as slow as 1 packet/day or 1 packet/hour. The key point here is long range\n\
    communication and low power consumption. LoRa achieves this objective with the use of CSS. Since LoRa is a pro-\n\
    prietary technique, researchers mainly focus on performance study. Relevant proposals of physical layer optimiza-\n\
    tions are based on general principles of CSS. The important features of LoRa communication which receive wide\n\
    interests from industry sections are long range communication capability, robustness to interferences, and low power\n\
    consumption. Mroue et al. made an analytical study along with simulation work to explain and improve LoRa-based\n\
    BER (Bit Error Rate) expressions [35]. The proposed BER expression is more accurate compared with the conven-\n\
    tional error probability of CSS by introducing a few parameters such as symbol frequency, sampling frequency, sig-\n\
    nal-to-noise and implementation loss. In [36], mathematic expressions describing generation and demodulation of\n\
    LoRa signal were made. In addition, authors in [36] proposed a simplified filter design to reduce number of coeffi-\n\
    cients of digital filters in the baseband process at the receiver. Simulation results showed that the design can achieve\n\
    satisfactory performance of symbol error rate at a cost of slightly increment of SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) loss.\n\
    As the LoRa technology may be used to collect sensory data in a dense network, its feature of the “orthogonal\n\
    spreading factor” is usually taken to provide simultaneous transmission capability, i.e. multiple communications are\n\
    allowed to happen simultaneously as long as they employ different spreading factors. However, such transmission\n\
    might be inaccurate since the achievement of “orthogonality” needs certain condition, i.e. the threshold of SIR (Signal-\n\
    to-Interference  Ratio).  In  [37],  authors  implemented  simulation  and  practical\
    \  experiments  to  determine  if  desired\nLoRa  communication  can  be  successfully\
    \  completed  at  the  presence  of  “ interfering  LoRa  signal”   with  different\n\
    spreading factors. The result showed that by average, a 16 dB co-channel rejection value should be satisfied to have\n\
    desired communication successfully completed. It is for the reason that the receiver takes the interfering LoRa signal\n\
    as a chirped waveform (a wide-band spectrum) and tries to look for a peak value to synchronize with the desired sig-\n\
    nal whose strength should be 16 dB higher than the interfering signal. This finding indicates that applying different\n\
    spreading factors may not be sufficient to build independent communication channels if interfering LoRa devices are\n\
    close to the receiver during communication.\nIn fact, LoRa is one de-factor standard of IoT technologies for long range communication where there might be\n\
    hundreds of meters or kilometers between a LoRa end device and a LoRa gateway. As a kind of NB wireless tech-\n\
    nologies, LoRa can achieve longer communication range than that of wideband wireless communication technolo-\n\
    gies, e.g. WiFi, and Bluetooth, with given transmission power (usually it is a mandatory requirement made by local\n\
    authority for radio usage at industrial scientific medical (ISM) band in different regions). However, there is a trade-off\n\
    between communication range and data rate. NB systems can support low data rate since a small bandwidth has limi-\n\
    tations in channel capacity according to Shannon-Hartley theorem [38]. Obviously, low data rate means a long radio\n\
    propagation time which results in high possibility of wireless conflicts between different radio communications. For\n\
    example, LoRa devices support receiving sensitivity low to −136 dBm when the spreading factor is 12, bandwidth is\n\
    125 kHz and nominal data rate is 293 bps. A short message whose length is tens of bytes may last for a few seconds\n\
    over the air, and this significantly increases the possibility of radio conflicts and interferences.\n\
    A dilemma of IoT applications is the use of NB radio systems to implement large scale and dense deployment,\n\

     \n8\ne.g. utility meter reading, smart agriculture, and environment monitoring. Many research carried out at the physical\n\
    layer of LoRa-like modulation schemes focus on data rate improvement on the premise of keeping receiving sensi-\n\
    tivity at an acceptable level. Authors in [39] proposed a novel design of chirp transmitters and orthogonal hirp gener-\n\
    ators (OCGs) to support a wide range of spreading factors and bandwidth at a low cost. In addition, a phase-shifted\n\
    CSS (PS-CSS) was proposed to increase transmission rate by which a maximum of 33% improvement (spreading\n\
    factor is 6) was made compared to conventional CSS technologies.\nIn order to improve spectral efficiency and energy efficiency, alternative chirp spread spectrum techniques, in-\n\
    phase and quadrature CSS (IQCSS) and discrete chirp rate keying CSS (DCRK-CSS), were proposed in [40]. As\n\
    claimed by the authors, IQCSS can double throughputs compared with LoRa. DCRK-CSS can increase the through-\n\
    put up to 50% under certain conditions. The throughput optimization brought by the two schemes is obtained using\n\
    the same transmission power when compared with LoRa modulation, and this means less energy will be consumed as\n\
    shorter time is required to complete transmission. An idea of using index modulation (IM) in CSS was proposed in\n\
    [41]. Different from other techniques, using IM in CSS means multiple chirps are simultaneously transmitted which\n\
    allows more bits to be embedded in symbols. Consequently, the complexity of receiver design increases as it requires\n\
    more resources to detect and estimate data bits from a larger signal set. In order to reduce computational complexity,\n\
    a suboptimal detection algorithm was also proposed to analyze and locate desired data set in a recursive manner.\n\
    Although LoRa is a kind of proprietary technique, it mainly refers to the modulation scheme. Developers can\n\
    implement design or optimization for other layers of OSI models except for physical layers. Essentially, LoRa radio\n\
    provides wireless link for connecting devices. The medium ccess control (MAC) protocol, which is part of Link\n\
    Layer, is an important component as it is direactly related to the starting point of communication, which must take\n\
    various factors into consideration, e.g. the channel state, radio environment, acknowledgement, frequency usage and\n\
    traffic condition.\nAs  the  most  well-known  LoRa  communication  based  system,\
    \  LoRaWAN  has  been  adopted  worldwide.\nLoRaWAN defines the use of the ALOHA type medium access control method, which inevitably introduces packet\n\
    collision or packet loss. Early in 2016, Augustin et al [42] made simulations to study LoRaWAN MAC layer perfor-\n\
    mance. With given settings (100 LoRaWAN end devices, channel bandwidth = 125 kHz, coding rate = 4/5, pream-\n\
    ble = 6, payload range [1,58] bytes, packet arrival follows Poisson law), the obtained capacity usage is 18% of the\n\
    channel capacity, which is chosen to be the pure-ALOHA protocol. Corresponding link load is 0.48 at which around\n\
    60% of the packet transmission failed due to collisions. Due to the absence of channel detection algorithms, e.g.\n\
    CSMA in 802.11 standard, success rate of LoRaWAN MAC layer is very sensitive to the channel load as pure-\n\
    ALOHA.\nAuthors in [43] built a mathematical model to describe packet collision and packet loss in a LoRaWAN net-\n\
    work consisting of a number of LoRaWAN end devices and a LoRaWAN gateway. Probability of packet collision\n\
    increases in a LoRaWAN network as the increment of packet payload size or the value of spreading factor. Packet\n\
    loss has close relationship with duration of LoRaWAN uplink packet and LoRaWAN gateway delay (the packet loss\n\
    happens  when  the  gateway  is  sending  ACK  for  preceding  uplink  LoRaWAN\
    \  communication).  In  [44],  a  packet\nlatency model was built by taking packet collision probability and regulatory duty-cycle requirements into considera-\n\
    tion. LoRaWAN works on license free ISM band where radio activity is normally limited by local regulators dedi-\n\
    cated to the usage of transmitters. The MAC layer performance evaluation for LoRaWAN should include this limita-\n\
    tion as an important factor.\nRecently, LoRa has proposed a new modulation technique, i.e. the long-range frequency hopping spread spec-\n\
    trum (LR-FHSS), to further enhance long range capability and improve network capacity. The motivation for devel-\n\
    oping LR-FHSS is to remove limitations made by duty-cycle regional regulations [45]. Regional regulations strictly\n\
    define the period a radio can be active on a given channel. The number of terminals and data size for each transmis-\n\
    sion are also limited, which consequently reduces LoRaWAN network capacity. By the method of frequency hop-\n\
    ping, transmission is divided into a number of pieces and each piece is transmitted on different channels. As summa-\n\
    rized in [46], LR-FHSS works around limitations by intra-packet hopping to carry longer payload with slow data rate\n\
    in regions with restrictions on dwell time. Theoretical analysis shows that a 10 dB link budget improvement (about 3 ×\n\
    free-space transmission distance improvement) can be achieved under certain conditions (in the FCC region on the\n\
    915 MHz band) [46]. A 140× capacity improvement is possible to be achieved when comparing LR-FHSS with con-\n\
    ventional LoRa (SF12) communication [46]. LR-FHSS is compatible with LoRaWAN hardware and networks where\n\
    only software upgrading is needed. Such changes allow more and more applications previously restricted by LoRa\n\
    network capacity to achieve significant improvement and consolidate the application market of LoRa in long range\n\
    low data rate communication.\n4. Industry Iot and LoRa\nIJNDI, 2022, 1(1): 4−19. https://doi.org/10.53941/ijndi0101002\n\
     \n9\nConventionally industry related systems are isolated from public networks. Since the proposal of the fourth\n\
    industrial revolution (Industry 4.0), communication, autonomous and decentralized decisions with the aim of increas-\n\
    ing  industrial  efficiency,  productivity,  safety  and  transparency  have  become\
    \  a  new  system  design  purpose  [47].\nIndustrial IoT is a comprehensive topic referring to various disciplines. When it comes to wireless communication, a\n\
    strict requirement is proposed to the employed radio system: deterministic timing. Data communication in industry\n\
    systems usually has real-time timeliness requirements since failure of fulfilling the timing requirement may compro-\n\
    mise system performance or even cause dangers to human lives [48].\nNormal wireless systems utilize the ALOHA-like protocol, or the CSMA-CA algorithm to deal with channel\n\
    access and to implement interference avoidance. Channel access strategies based on randomness are not applicable in\n\
    Industry IoT because radio environment in industrial scenarios often suffer from various channel impairments such as\n\
    path loss, shadowing effect and unpredictable obstacles [49,50]. An idea of achieving deterministic behavior in wire-\n\
    less communication is to bound timing of transmission and receiving within a specified period, i.e. a slot. In [51],\n\
    authors proposed a modified time slotted channel hoping (TSCH) strategy for the use of the LoRaWAN MAC layer\n\
    to enable better frequency and code diversity on LoRaWAN end devices and network servers. In the evaluation test,\n\
    LoRaWAN end devices were allocated with different spreading factors and different channels. Data transmission was\n\
    not based on random access but started with synchronized signal by which packet conflicts on a channel can be elim-\n\
    inated. This method supports unconfirmed uplink communication only.\nTo achieve flexible communication in Industrial IoT, authors in [52] proposed a new MAC layer strategy to\n\
    support real-time data flow over LoRa based networks (RT-LoRa). RT-LoRa works with star topology in which a\n\
    sink node takes responsibility of synchronizing all end devices using regular beacon signals. End devices consist of\n\
    two types: the stationary node and mobile node. The stationary node is responsible for collecting sensory data whilst\n\
    the mobile node is allowed to move in the sensing area. In-network time is organized and bounded by cyclically\n\
    repeated superframe which mainly consists of beacon, contention access period (CAP) and contention free period\n\
    (CFP) .\nFeatures of RT-LoRa can be concluded as follows. (1) CAP and CFP contain a number of timeslot sets by\n\
    which duration of radio activities can be measured and strictly restricted within one or more slots, (2) In CAP, end\n\
    devices  use  Slotted-ALOHA  based  strategies  along  with  randomly  generated\
    \  3-tuple  parameters  (the  channel,\nspreading factor and time slot) to compete for channel accessing. The random parameters distribute channel usage by\n\
    which the success rate of communication increases. (3) In CFP, only end devices allocated in the current time slot is\n\
    allowed to communicate with the sink node, (4) QoS algorithm is provided in CFP to ensure reliability of communi-\n\
    cation at levels of normal, reliable and most reliable, (5) Radio channels are carefully allocated in each superframe to\n\
    fulfill requirements of duty-cycle under different regions.\nA similar real-time LoRa protocol was also proposed in [53] to achieve collision-free communication. Timing\n\
    in a LoRa network is divided into frames and further divided into a number of slots. On this basis, a real-time task\n\

    ing to the length of data packet, i.e. transmission time required for communication. With the help of modified Listen-\n\
    Before-Talk mechanism, the evaluation test confirmed that over 94% packet delivering rate is achievable although\n\
    high external interferences are present.\nIn the scenarios of Industrial IoT, LoRa techniques are usually employed to collect data generated on LoRa end\n\
    devices. Research studies mainly focus on how to ensure timeliness of wireless communication. Normally, commu-\n\
    nication in industry relies on cable connection (e.g. Ethernet, Field-bus, RS232/485), which has less concern about the\n\
    interference and latency. Wireless communication usually faces problems of performance degradation as it is easy to\n\
    be affected by interferences and packet conflicts. The LoRa technique has better performance on interference resis-\n\
    tance, but is heavily affected by packet conflicts due to low data rate. Therefore, a proper strategy to optimize wire-\n\
    less latency is quite important and of great needs, if LoRa is to be used in Industrial IoT. In this case, power con-\n\
    sumption issue is normally not of the highest priority.\n5. Smart City Iot and\
    \ LoRa\nDue to its requirement for massive and large-scale sensor deployment, it is common for smart city IoT to adopt\n\
    the LoRa technique. Although LoRa has long range communication capability, it has relatively low data rate which\n\
    affects overall system performance about network capacity, deployment density and power consumption. In [54],\n\
    authors studied the radio coverage issue of LoRa networks and concluded that (1) it is possible to achieve an 100%\n\
    packet delivery ratio up to 4 km range and 99% for over 4.8 km under certain conditions. In this case, a LoRaWAN\n\
    gateway is installed at the height of 30 m above ground, and (2) an empirical path loss model is proposed to deter-\n\
    mine LoRa link budget at frequency bands of 868 MHz and 433 MHz.\nIJNDI, 2022, 1(1): 4−19. https://doi.org/10.53941/ijndi0101002\n\
     \n10\nAlthough LoRa techniques provide desired radio performance for applications of large scale sensor deployment,\n\
    it is not easy to arrange such deployment as various technical parameters are involved in a LoRa based communica-\n\
    tion network, e.g. the spreading factor, frequency band, coding rate, distance and obstacle between LoRa end devices\n\
    and LoRa gateways. In [55], an optimal configuration scheme is provided to allocate appropriate spreading factors\n\
    and transmission power for every LoRa end device in a LoRaWAN network. The objective of the optimal configu-\n\
    ration scheme is to reduce probability of collisions and energy consumption. Two stages are adopted in the scheme.\n\
    At stage 1, each node tries to be allocated with a proper spreading factor by issuing communication to a gateway\n\
    using maximum transmission power, and this ensures that the spreading factor later allocated for an end device by the\n\
    gateway is sufficient to establish a LoRa radio link. At stage 2, the level of transmission power is further optimized\n\
    for an end device in order to save energy consumption on the premise of the reliable radio link. In [56], a compre-\n\
    hensive study on spreading factor allocation for LoRa based sensor nodes in dense network was studied, where an\n\
    overall consideration was taken for the use of spreading factors along with directly related parameters, e.g. the pay-\n\
    load size, packet error rate, ALOHA mechanism and duty-cycle requirement. Based on the distance between differ-\n\
    ent LoRa end devices and LoRa gateway, a suggestion about spreading factor allocation was given to improve deliv-\n\
    ery rate of overall network.\nIn [57], a LoRa-based mesh network was discussed to extend and enhance LoRa network coverage. LoRa radio\n\
    has long range capability, but is affected by deployment environment. Indoor obstacle can easily stop radio propaga-\n\
    tion, which is also a common issue for most wireless systems. Mesh networks enable each in-network LoRa device to\n\
    be a relay node to provide packet forward functionality for neighbor nodes which cannot directly reach a LoRa gate-\n\
    way. A similar idea can be found in [58] where a simplified AODV routing protocol was proposed to organize a\n\
    LoRa mesh network to cover areas that out the range of a single LoRaWAN gateway. A hierarchy-based energy effi-\n\
    cient routing protocol (HBEE) designed for the LoRa mesh network was proposed in [59]. In order to quickly build a\n\
    network structure, HBEE employs concurrent transmission to spread gateway information through the entire network.\n\
    Concurrent transmission means multiple LoRa network devices at the same level of a tree network forward data\n\
    packet using a synchronized way, which greatly reduces possibility of packet collision and minimizes network for-\n\
    mation time. Multi-path and multi-channel communication algorithms were used during the data collection stage that\n\
    further improves final data delivery rate. The experimental results obtained in [59] showed HBEE can achieve packet\n\
    reception rate of 95.7% and 89.8% during the network formation stage and normal operation stage, respectively.\n\
    Smart city IoT makes full use of LoRa capability of configurate radio range such that LoRa end devices located\n\
    at different positions can reach the sink node (e.g. the LoRa gateway) without modifying modulation schemes, which\n\
    is  normally  not  applicable  in  many  other  technologies.  Although  the  LoRaWAN\
    \  standard  is  a  successful  market\nexample in dealing with large scale sensor deployment, it faces the challenge of wireless packet collision, giving rise\n\
    to the requirement of reasonable configuration and optimization schemes. Moreover, severe radio environment may\n\
    affect wireless reception despite the fact that LoRa can achieve long range communication. Ad-hoc based mesh net-\n\
    works can provide flexible deployment options, and are particularly useful in smart city scenarios, see references [60−62].\n\
    6. Direct-to-satellite Iot and LoRa\nDtS-IoT is a very attractive IoT filed which extremely expands physical world connection from the Earth to the\n\
    space, and internet access is quite convenient in populated areas. However, DtS-IoT is not achievable at most areas\n\
    on the Earth. Satellite communication is the only solution to provide global coverage. DtS-IoT is a promising research\n\
    topic that helps address connectivity issues in certain scenarios, for example, disaster recovery scenarios of earth-\n\
    quakes, tsunamis and flooding [63]. Connectivity between ground networks (devices) and Low-Earth Orbit (LEO)\n\
    satellites can be achieved in two ways, indirect and direct (as shown in Figure 2 below). For those short range com-\n\
    munication systems, a ground based gateway is required to play as a relay to build mutual communication with satel-\n\
    lites. For long range wireless systems such as LoRa, it is possible to build direct links which make ground deploy-\n\

     \nWhen LEO satellites moving around the Earth, if a satellite is out of range of LoRaWAN end device, the end\n\
    device will adjust the beacon detection window until next beacon from next satellite is captured. In [65], impact of\n\
    ionospheric scintillation was comprehensively studied to evaluate the limitations of LoRa communication in the use\n\
    of space-to-Earth satellite communications, while in [66] a trajectory-based LoRa radio uplink transmission policy\n\
    was studied to improve the success rate of direct connection from the LoRa end device to the satellite in space. The\n\
    policy takes various factors into consideration, e.g. the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of LoRa beacons\n\
    from satellites, frequency shift of beacons (to determine the speed of satellite), and orbital parameters. The result\n\
    obtained from the analysis of these factors can be used for different transmission policies: plain trajectory, trajectory\n\
    random, trajectory skip and trajectory random. As authors stated, the proposed policy can at least duplicate the net-\n\
    work scalability compared with conventional LoRa communication methods.\nLoRa techniques used in space-ground communication are still in a pre-research stage but with very attractive\n\
    vision  [67].  Successful  links  established  between  LoRa  devices  and  satellites\
    \  can  make  IoT  globe  coverage  cost\neffective by removing ground station usage. However, there is a long way before this solution becomes mature as\n\
    extreme long range communication introduces research challenges in areas of modulation technique, antenna design,\n\
    signal processing, data coding, power management, uplink and downlink policies, interaction between satellites, etc.\n\

    system to the Internet by which doctors from anywhere of the world are able to keep monitoring on status of patients.\n\
    In [73] a hybrid and edge based healthcare system was proposed where wearable sensor were equipped on the\n\
    human body to take responsibility of monitoring health state and reporting to central system. The reporting can expe-\n\
    rience either of two communication paths, i.e. LoRa or Bluetooth, depending on the distance between sensors and\n\
    gateways. If a Bluetooth router is within effective range, health data will be sent to router and then forwarded to an\n\
    edge gateway. Otherwise, the LoRa radio link will be used to convey data to the edge gateway since LoRa can sup-\n\
    port larger coverage than Bluetooth. The edge gateway is in charge of implementing data processing and making\n\
    quick responses to situations. Functionalities such as data storage and data analysis are implemented later by a remote\n\

    \ Future Development of LoRa\nIoT is becoming more and more complicated compared with its initial version. Having devices complete tasks\n\
    of reporting sensory data and controlling actuators is an important part of IoT. However, the way of system organiza-\n\
    tion and the pattern of network operation are more and more diverse, due to expansion of application fields which\n\
    require advanced IoT technologies to improve existing systems, or build new systems for certain targets (e.g. com-\n\
    munication between low power ground-based devices and satellites). This motivates IoT to move deeply into appli-\n\
    cation scenarios to construct reasonable and efficient systems. In the meantime, technologies adopted in different IoT\n\
    application scenarios keep developing in different aspects, including new algorithms, system optimization, and sys-\n\
    tem integration. As a kind of low power wireless technologies, LoRa is usually taken by IoT applications to achieve\n\
    long range communication, which means that effectively integrating LoRa into different systems is one promising\n\
    future research direction in the development of LoRa. Possible topics on these issues may include but not limited to:\n\
    5G network and LoRa, edge computing and LoRa.\n8.1. 5G and LoRa\n5G network is becoming more and more popular due to its exciting features of massive machine-type commu-\n\
    nication (mMTC) supporting 1 million devices/km2, enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) supporting less than 4 ms\n\
    latency, and ultra-reliable, low-latency communication (URLLC) supporting mission critical applications with less\n\
    than 0.5 ms latency [74]. In Industry 4.0 and its later version, mMTC and URLLC are often mentioned as 5G offers\n\
    significant performance improvement compared with conventional wireless access techniques (e.g. 3G/4G). Tradi-\n\
    tional industry applications adopt cabling systems to achieve reliable and low latency communication, which has\n\
    urgent requirements for wireless solutions. Applications such as real-time monitoring, industry-robotics, and remote\n\
    communication support require highly reliable and low latency wireless technologies to provide most convenience\n\
    when deploying system [75]. Combining the LoRa and 5G based gateway will be a focus of research. A random-\n\
    based MAC protocol is not suitable for LoRa to be used in these cases. A systematic re-design is needed for LoRa to\n\
    cooperate with 5G to achieve precise control by eliminating any uncertainty caused by interference or collisions. For\n\
    example, the concept of time sensitivity networking (TSN) over 5G has been proposed to enable reliable and deter-\n\
    ministic wireless communications between end devices and 5G networks [76−78]. The development of LoRa can be\n\
    taken as a reference to design TSN-like algorithms in order to make proper arrangement for (1) scheduling priority-\n\
    based uplink traffic, (2) ensuring downlink control signaling, and (3) managing network scalability.\n\
    8.2. Edge Computing and LoRa\nEdge computing is a familiar topic to researchers for the reason of rapid growth of IoT applications requiring\n\
    quick responses to the generated data, such as Vehicular Data Analytics, Smart Home, Video Stream Analytics and\n\
    Virtual Reality [79]. Conventionally cloud based computing is used to process information collected from different\n\
    locations, but has limitations in providing real-time responses for safety-critical and performance-sensitivity applica-\n\
    tions  due  to  unpredictable  latency  [80].  Edge  computing  proposes  a  new\
    \  computing  paradigm  by  migrating  data\ncomputation or storage to the network “edge” in order to mitigate the escalation in resource congestion at the central\n\
    computing unit [81]. In such a paradigm, an edge node is expected to not only exchange data between the local net-\n\
    work and the remote center, but also have capability on processing data received via multiple interfaces at the local\n\
    side. Many studies about LoRa related edge computing can be found from [82−87] that cover fields of medical care,\n\
    agriculture, block-chain, smart metering, smart city, artificial intelligence, etc. Note that LoRa can also be used in any\n\
    possible scenarios by cooperating with different hardware/algorithms. For example, in [86] authors proposed a sys-\n\
    tem integrated with edge/fog computing, where LoRa and deep learning algorithms were used to perform fall detec-\n\
    tion. And overcome the lack of network infrastructures at certain areas. In [87] LoRa and Bluetooth worked together\n\
    to build a low power smart city network (as shown in Figure 6) designed for collecting daily information such as\n\
    transportation state, health data, etc. The data is generated and sent to the LoRa edge gateway via short range Blue-\n\
    tooth, and then forwarded to the LoRa fog gateway via long range LoRa links. On the LoRa edge and fog gateway,\n\
    preliminary data processing will be implemented by which corresponding responses can be made at the local side and\n\
    the volume of data delivered to the Cloud can be minimized. A combination of LoRaWAN and Wi-Fi/Ethernet was\n\
    proposed in [88] to build an autonomous server which can process and store data even in the absence of internet con-\n\
    nectivity.\nIJNDI, 2022, 1(1): 4−19. https://doi.org/10.53941/ijndi0101002\n \n\
    14\nIt can be concluded that LoRa is quite popular as a data communication technique in many different edge com-\n\
    puting-based applications. However, as a pure physical layer communication technique, LoRa is in short of architec-\n\
    ture design to support diverse application requirements. An example solution is the LoRaWAN standard, but such a\n\
    strandard is insufficient as the deign purpose of LoRaWAN is for reporting data, rather than supporting local data\n\
    processing. In the future development, relevant research is needed to find out how to properly deploy and allocate\n\
    LoRa resource in the context of edge computing.\nIn general, it is reasonable to believe, there are two future promising development directions in LoRa, i.e. (1)\n\
    enhancement of LoRa communication efficiency, and (2) design of interaction mechanisms between LoRa and other\n\
    technologies/systems, where the enhancement on communication efficiency could be treated as a vertical develop-\n\
    ment direction. As a bottom communication technology, LoRa is often used to collect massively distributed device\n\
    data. Having data transmission deterministic and reliable is an important research topic in promoting LoRa for the use\n\
    of dense networks. Making LoRa collaborative could be treated as a horizontal development direction, where the\n\
    LoRa technique is expected to work together with different systems through proper integration.\n\
    9. Conclusions\nRapid development of IoT makes more and more application fields adopt LoRa to establish close links between\n\
    IoT objects and data processing systems. As one of LPWAN technologies, LoRa is particularly useful for network-\n\
    ing embedded and low-cost devices deployed in a wide area. As per characteristics of different IoT fields, the use of\n\
    LoRa technique may have different emphasis. In industry IoT like fields, interference robustness of LoRa along with\n\
    the specifically designed strategy for ensuring deterministic timing is the main point, which provides a reliable wire-\n\
    less communication link for industrial applications. For smart city IoT like fields, flexible radio configuration which\n\
    allows massive and large scale network deployment is the benefit brought by the LoRa technique. However, network\n\
    performance evaluation and optimization algorithms are needed to help LoRa based network to resolve packet con-\n\
    flict issues. DtS-IoT is a new area that makes use of long range communication capability to its maximum perfor-\n\
    mance. Challenges in this case require more study as existing research made for the LoRa technique may be insuffi-\n\
    cient. Healthcare IoT like fields demonstrate the use of the LoRa technique in associating with other systems or tech-\n\
    niques to improve service quality. In general, the LoRa technique is particularly important in building communica-\n\
    tion links for ubiquitous computing of IoT. Researches on further improving communication range and interference\n\
    resistance could become major focuses as they are the core factors of the LoRa technique. In the future development,\n\
    the LoRa technique can evolve towards directions of (1) efficient communication for stronger precise control capa-\n\
    bility, and (2) reasonable mechanism for better interaction with other systems.\n\

    \ \n1.1. A worldwide dilemma of food security\nFood security is a multifaceted\
    \ notion that aims to eliminate hunger by \nassuring a steady supply of nutritious\
    \ food. It is defined by a four-pillar para-\ndigm, each of which is necessary\
    \ to provide food security [1]. Food security \nis becoming a severe global concern\
    \ as a result of anthropogenic factors such \nas rapid population expansion, urbanization,\
    \ industrialization, farmland loss, \nfreshwater scarcity, and environmental degradation.\
    \ This is due to the fact that \n424\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nthese factors have a direct impact on the agricultural industry,\
    \ which is the \nworld’s principal source of agri-food production. By 2050, it\
    \ is expected that \nthe global population will rise from 7.7 billion to 9.2 billion,\
    \ urban population \nwill rise by 66 percent, arable land will decline by approximately\
    \ 50 million \nhectares, global GHG emissions (source of CO 2 – promote crop disease\
    \ and \npest growth) will rise by 50 percent, agri-food production will decline\
    \ by 20%, \nand food demand will rise by 59 to 98 percent, posing an imminent\
    \ threat. To \nmeet rising food demands, agricultural practitioners around the\
    \ world will need \nto increase crop and livestock production to maximize agricultural\
    \ output. The \nemphasis of this review paper is crop farming, which includes\
    \ the production \nof both food and cash crops. \nA typical agri-food value chain\
    \ displaying three key stages in the production \nof agricultural products: pre-field\
    \ (pre-plantation stage), in-field (plantation and \nharvesting stage), and post-field\
    \ (post-harvesting stage). All of the stages are \nimportant in the value chain,\
    \ but in this examination, we will focus on the sec-\nond stage, in-field, which\
    \ includes numerous crop-growing operations such as \nploughing, sowing, spraying,\
    \ and harvesting, among others. Traditional agricul-\ntural approaches are now\
    \ used in these procedures, which are labor-intensive, \nrequire arable land,\
    \ time, and a significant quantity of water (for irrigation), and \nmake it difficult\
    \ to produce enough food [5]. A part of the problem is also due \nto the improper\
    \ application of pesticides and herbicides, as well as the misuse \nof available\
    \ technologies, both of which hurt crops and ultimately result in \nagricultural\
    \ waste [6]. These problems can be solved by combining advanced \ntechnologies\
    \ and computer-based applications that ensure higher crop yields, \nless water\
    \ use, better pesticide/herbicide use, and improved crop quality. This \nis where\
    \ the concept of smart agriculture comes into play.\n1.2. Smart Agriculture\n\
    Every industry is being revolutionized and reshaped by Industry 4.0. It’s a \n\
    strategic initiative that combines emerging disruptive digital technologies like\
    \ \nthe Internet of Things (IoT), big data and analytics (BDA), system integration\
    \ \n(SI), cloud computing (CC), simulation, autonomous robotic systems (ARS),\
    \ \naugmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), wireless sensor networks\
    \ \n(WSN), cyber-physical systems (CPS), digital twin (DT), and additive manu-\n\
    facturing (AM) to enable the digitization of the industry [7]. \nAgriculture 4.0,\
    \ also known as smart agriculture, smart farming or digital \nfarming [7], is\
    \ the next phase of industrial agriculture, fueled by the integra-\ntion of these\
    \ technologies in agriculture. Farmers can use smart agriculture to \naddress\
    \ a variety of agricultural food production concerns such as farm pro-\n425\n\
    Siberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nductivity,\
    \ environmental impact, food security, crop losses, and sustainability. \nFarmers,\
    \ for example, can connect to farms remotely, regardless of location \nor time,\
    \ using IoT-enabled equipment based on WSNs to monitor and control \nfarm operations.\
    \ Drones outfitted with hyper spectral cameras can collect data \nfrom a variety\
    \ of sources on farmlands, while autonomous robots can assist \nor complete repetitive\
    \ chores on farms. Data analytics techniques can be used \nto examine the obtained\
    \ data, and computer programs can be utilized to help \nfarmers make decisions.\n\
    Similarly, smart agriculture can monitor and analyze a wide range of pa-\nrameters\
    \ related to environmental factors, weed control, crop production status, \nwater\
    \ management, soil conditions, irrigation scheduling, herbicides and pes-\nticides,\
    \ and controlled environment agriculture to increase crop yields, reduce \ncosts,\
    \ improve product quality, and maintain process inputs through the use of \nmodern\
    \ systems [8].\n1.3. Research Motivation and Contribution \nThe reason for writing\
    \ this assessment is that digital technologies in agri-\ncultural systems provide\
    \ new strategic solutions for increasing farm output ef-\nficiency and effectiveness.\
    \ Furthermore, digital transformation paves the door \nfor modern farming technologies\
    \ like vertical farming (hydroponics, aquapon-\nics, and aeroponics) to be used,\
    \ which has the potential to solve food security \nissues. However, there are\
    \ a number of issues and restrictions connected with \nthis change from a technological,\
    \ socioeconomic, and management perspective \nthat must be overcome in order to\
    \ fully realise the potential of agricultural 4.0 \n[9].A number of publications\
    \ [9–18] have examined developing trends in the \ndevelopment of agriculture 4.0\
    \ by offering concise information on essential \nuses, benefits, and research\
    \ problems of smart farming. These studies’ research \nfocuses on either explaining\
    \ more general technical aspects while focusing on \nonly one or a few digital\
    \ technologies, or improving agricultural supply chain \nperformance, or developing\
    \ an agriculture 4.0 definition, or achieving sustain-\nable agronomy through\
    \ precision agriculture, or proposing a smart farming \nframework. Nonetheless,\
    \ these studies do not include an explicit discussion of \nthe tools and techniques\
    \ utilized to construct various systems, as well as their \nmaturity level. There\
    \ are also few studies that look at the consequences of dig-\nital technology\
    \ in modern soilless farms including hydroponics, aquaponics, \nand aeroponics\
    \ (indoor/outdoor). As a result, in order to promote conversation \nin this field,\
    \ it is necessary to examine the emergence of agriculture 4.0 from \nmany angles.\
    \ This research seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of dig-\nital technologies\
    \ used in the second stage of the agricultural production value \n426\nSiberian\
    \ Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nchain (in-field)\
    \ for various farm types as described in section 1.1. The study’s \nkey theoretical\
    \ contribution is the analysis and dissemination of the tools and \ntechniques\
    \ used, as well as the farm type, maturity level of produced systems, \nand potential\
    \ obstacles or inhibiting factors in agriculture 4.0 development. Re-\nsearchers\
    \ and agricultural practitioners will benefit from the review’s insights \nin\
    \ future study on agriculture 4.0. \n1.4. Paper organization \nThe following is\
    \ the structure of the paper after the introduction: \nSection 2 discusses the\
    \ methodology used to collect relevant literature; Sec-\ntion 3 then presents\
    \ the statistical results obtained after a general analysis of the \nselected\
    \ research studies; Section 4 then provides a detailed overview of the \ncore\
    \ technologies used in agricultural digitization; Section 5 then highlights the\
    \ \ntechnical and socio-economic roadblocks to digital integration in agriculture;\
    \ \nand finally, Section 6 outlines a discussion of the research questions.\n\
    2. Research Methodology \nA systematic literature review (SLR) is a technique\
    \ for organizing and iden-\ntifying research related to a specific topic [19].\
    \ SLR is used in this study to look \ninto the state of Industry 4.0 technologies\
    \ in the agricultural industry. Cases \nwhere the phrase ‘agricultural’ occurred\
    \ in the title, abstract, or keywords of \nan article with any of the ‘Industry\
    \ 4.0 technologies’ described in section 1.2 \nare specifically sought. A review\
    \ procedure is established prior to conducting \nthe SLR to ensure a transparent\
    \ and high-quality research process, which are \nthe features that distinguish\
    \ a systematic literature review [20]. By conducting \nthorough literature searches,\
    \ the review methodology also helps to reduce bias. \nThe creation of the research\
    \ questions, the defining of the search method, and \nthe specification of inclusion\
    \ and exclusion criteria are all part of this process. \nTo conduct SLR, this\
    \ paper uses a recommended reporting item for system-\natic reviews and meta-analysis\
    \ (PRISMA) approach. PRISMA is a minimum \ncollection of items based on evidence\
    \ that is used to guide the construction of \nsystematic literature reviews and\
    \ other meta-analyses [19].\n2.1. Review Protocol \nBefore doing the bibliographic\
    \ analysis, a review methodology is estab-\nlished to identify, analyze, and interpret\
    \ data that are relevant to the research \nfocus. To begin, research questions\
    \ are developed in order to provide insight \ninto the study of published studies\
    \ in the research area of interest from many \nperspectives. These are the questions\
    \ that must be addressed in the research. The \nsearch strategy is then created,\
    \ which aids in the identification of appropriate \n427\nSiberian Journal of Life\
    \ Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nkeywords later in the search equation,\
    \ as well as the identification of relevant \ninformation sources, such as academic\
    \ databases and search engines that allow \naccess to vast amounts of digital\
    \ documentation. Science Direct, Scopus, and \nIEEE Xplore are three online research\
    \ archives that are utilized to find relevant \nstudies. Finally, boundaries are\
    \ created by predefining inclusion and exclusion \ncriteria for further inquiry\
    \ and content assessments of selected articles in order \nto narrow the search\
    \ results of each database.\n2.2. Evaluation Process \nIdentification, screening,\
    \ eligibility, and inclusion are the four stages of the \nliterature search process\
    \ that are evaluated. Consolidation is done for the re-\nmoval of duplicate items\
    \ in the identification step after initial metadata filtering \nby the use of\
    \ search expressions. After this phase, the number of publications is \nreduced.\
    \ The titles and abstracts of the papers are reviewed during the screening \n\
    stage, and the most relevant publications are chosen for integral reading. In\
    \ the \nthird stage, full-text screening of these papers is done to ensure that\
    \ they are \neligible for this paper’s goal.\n2.3. Threats to Validity \n(i) SLR\
    \ replication: Because the current search is confined to only three on-\nline\
    \ repositories, the provided SLR is vulnerable to risks to validity. \nAdditional\
    \ sources could potentially lead to the discovery of more pub-\nlications. Validity\
    \ can be regarded satisfactorily addressed because the SLR \nprocess is clearly\
    \ defined in sub-sections 2.1 and 2.2. However, it is possible \nthat slightly\
    \ different publications will be found if this SLR is replicated. This \nvariation\
    \ could be due to various personal choices made throughout the PRIS-\nMA screening\
    \ and eligibility phases, but it’s highly improbable that the overall \nresults\
    \ would alter.\n(ii)The search string used to discover the relevant papers covers\
    \ the entire \nspectrum of SLR; however it’s possible that some important studies\
    \ were over-\nlooked. More research may be found if more keywords and synonyms\
    \ in the \nsearch are included.\n3. Digitization Trends in Agriculture \nAlthough\
    \ the agriculture business is making significant progress in terms \nof digital\
    \ technology adoption, it is still lagging behind other industries such \nas healthcare,\
    \ manufacturing, mining, automotive, energy, and others [15]. The \ncrop farming\
    \ method considered while designing an application or framework \nis referred\
    \ to as the farm type. The farming method, for example, can be soil-\nbased or\
    \ soilless. Open-air fields (conventional outdoor agricultural farms) and \n428\n\
    Siberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\ngreenhouse\
    \ farms are included in the soil-based farming category (indoor). The \nsoilless\
    \ farming category, on the other hand, includes modern farming tech-\nniques such\
    \ as aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics (mostly indoor). In \nthe recent\
    \ decade, autonomous robotics systems (including unmanned guided \nvehicles and\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicles (drones)), the internet of things, and \nmachine learning\
    \ appear to be the most commonly used technology in agricul-\nture. Agriculture’s\
    \ growing sectors include big data, wireless sensor networks, \ncyber-physical\
    \ systems, and digital twins. Furthermore, in contrast to indoor \nfarms, open\
    \ air farms are the most usually examined in research investigations. \nFew publications\
    \ exist for soilless farming systems (aquaponics, aeroponics, \nand hydroponics),\
    \ implying that these modern farming practices are still in \ntheir infancy. Similarly,\
    \ each use case’s services are identified and classified \ninto nine service categories:\
    \ I crop management, CM (estimation/harvesting \nperiod and seed plantation/prediction\
    \ of crop yield/ growth rate/harvesting/ \npollination/ spraying (fertilizer/\
    \ pesticide)); ii) crop quality management, CQM \n(fresh weight, green biomass,\
    \ height, length, width, leaf density, piment content \n(chlorophyll), and phytochemical\
    \ composition); iii) water and environmental \nmanagement, WEM (monitoring and\
    \ control of flow rate, water level, water \nquality (nutrients), temperature,\
    \ humidity, CO2, and weather forecasts, among \nother things); iv) irrigation\
    \ management, IM (water stress detection and sched-\nuling); v) farm management,\
    \ FM (monitoring of farm operations, tracking and \ncounting products, determining\
    \ production efficiency, financial analysis, energy \nconsumption analysis, technology\
    \ integration, and decision-making);\nPDM (pest and disease management) is a term\
    \ used to describe the man-\nagement of pests and diseases (pest identification\
    \ and disease detection) SM \n(Soil Management) vii) (moisture content, soil nutrients,\
    \ fertilizer needs and \napplication) WUVM (weed/unknown vegetation mapping, classification,\
    \ and \npesticide application) viii) weed and unwanted vegetation management FDC\
    \ \n(fruit detection and counting), and ix) \nThe role of various digital technologies\
    \ in smart farming is depicted in \nthese categories. Crop management characteristics\
    \ such as crop yield prediction, \ngrowth rate estimation, and harvesting period\
    \ evaluation are the most 4.0 in the \nprevious decade, whereas soil management,\
    \ fruit identification and counting, \nand crop quality management receive very\
    \ less attention. The European Union’s \nTRL scale, which divides system maturity\
    \ into three generic categories [21], is \nused to assess the technology readiness\
    \ level (TRL) of all use cases. The first \nlevel is conceptual, which corresponds\
    \ to European TRL 1–2 (use case is in \nconcept phase), the second level is prototype,\
    \ which corresponds to Europe-\n429\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\nan TRL 3–6 (use case is functional even without all planned\
    \ features), and the \nthird level is deployed, which corresponds to European\
    \ TRL 7–9. (Use case \nis mature with all the possible functions). Each use case’s\
    \ TRL was produced \nin a few experiments. It has been noticed that smart agricultural\
    \ systems have \nmade little progress from the concept and prototype stages to\
    \ the commercial \nstage. The majority of use cases, for example, are still in\
    \ the prototype stage.\n4. Agriculture 4.0 enabling technologies \n4.1. Internet\
    \ of Things driven agricultural systems \nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a network\
    \ of interconnected computing de-\nvices, sensors, appliances, and machines that\
    \ are all connected to the internet \nand have their own unique identities and\
    \ capacities for remote sensing and \nmonitoring [21]. Network layer (communication),\
    \ perception layer (hardware \ndevices), , middleware layer (device management\
    \ and interoperability), service \nlayer (cloud computing), application layer\
    \ (data integration and analytics), and \nend-user layer are the six layers of\
    \ the IoT reference architecture (user-inter-\nface). IoT devices on the physical\
    \ layer in the agricultural domain collect data \non environmental and crop characteristics\
    \ such as temperature, humidity, pH \nvalue, water level, leaf colour, fresh leaf\
    \ weight, and so on. The network layer is \nresponsible for transmitting this\
    \ information, and its architecture is determined \nby the field size, farm location,\
    \ and type of farming method. ZigBee, LoRa, and \nSigfox, for example, are widely\
    \ utilized and employed in outdoor fields because \nthey are less expensive, have\
    \ low energy consumption, and have a long trans-\nmission range [22, 23]. Bluetooth,\
    \ despite being a secure technology, is only \nemployed in indoor farms due to\
    \ its limited transmission range [22]. Due to its \nhigh costs and high energy\
    \ consumption, Wi-Fi is not a promising technology \nfor agricultural applications\
    \ [22]. On the other hand, RFID (radio frequency \nidentification) and NFC (near\
    \ field communication) technologies are increas-\ningly being used in agricultural\
    \ systems for product tracking [24]. For periodic \nmonitoring of environmental\
    \ and soil characteristics, GPRS or mobile commu-\nnication technology (2G, 3G,\
    \ and 4G) is utilized. Furthermore, HTTP, WWW, \nand SMTP are the most commonly\
    \ utilized communication protocols in agri-\ncultural contexts. Similarly, middleware\
    \ HYDRA and SMEPP are commonly \nused in agricultural systems to enable interoperability\
    \ and system security for \ntheir context-aware functionalities [25]. \nCloud\
    \ computing approaches are used in the service layer to store data. \nThis information\
    \ is then used on the application layer to create smart apps that \nfarmers, agriculture\
    \ experts, and supply chain professionals can use to improve \n430\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nfarm monitoring and productivity.\
    \ The use of IoT in agriculture is intended to \nprovide farmers with decision-making\
    \ tools and automation technologies that \nallow them to seamlessly integrate\
    \ knowledge, products, and services in order to \nincrease production, quality,\
    \ and profit. A slew of research have been conduct-\ned and presented on the incubation\
    \ of IoT concepts in the agricultural industry. \nThe development of IoT-based\
    \ agricultural systems has addressed a variety of \ntechnological and architectural\
    \ concerns. However, most of these technologies \nare now in the conceptual stage\
    \ or in prototype form (not commercial). Farm \nmanagement, irrigation control,\
    \ crop development, health monitoring, and dis-\nease detection are all priorities.\
    \ \nSome of these studies also explained how IoT is being used in current ag-\n\
    ricultural systems like vertical farming (soilless farming - aquaponics, hydro-\n\
    ponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). Furthermore, the\
    \ \nmajority of studies have been focused on a single issue.\n4.2. Wireless sensor\
    \ networks in agriculture \nA wireless sensor network (WSN) is a technology that\
    \ is utilized in an Inter-\nnet of Things (IoT) system. It is defined as a collection\
    \ of spatially distributed \nsensors for monitoring environmental physical conditions,\
    \ temporarily storing \nobtained data, and transferring the information to a central\
    \ point [22]. A wire-\nless sensor network (WSN) for smart farming is made up\
    \ of multiple sensor \nnodes connected by a wireless connection module. These\
    \ nodes have a variety \nof skills that allow them to self-organize, self-configure,\
    \ and self-diagnose (for \nexample, processing, trans- mission, and feeling).\
    \ There are various varieties of \nWSNs, which are classified based on the environment\
    \ in which they are used. \nTWSNs (terrestrial wireless sensor networks), WUSNs\
    \ (wireless underground \nsensor networks), UWSNs (underwater wireless sensor\
    \ networks), WMSNs \n(wireless multimedia sensor networks), and MWSNs (mobile\
    \ wireless sensor \nnetworks) are a few examples [26]. TWSN and UWSN are commonly\
    \ utilized \nin agricultural applications. TWSN nodes are sensors that collect\
    \ data from \nthe environment and are located above ground. The second type of\
    \ WSN is \nWUSNs, which are WSNs with sensor nodes embedded in the soil. Lower\
    \ fre-\nquencies easily enter the soil in this environment, whereas higher frequencies\
    \ \nare severely attenuated [27]. Because of the limited communication radius,\
    \ the \nnetwork requires a larger number of nodes to cover a big area. Many research\
    \ \npublications on the use of WSN for various outdoor and indoor farm applica-\n\
    tions, such as irrigation management, water quality testing, and environmental\
    \ \nmonitoring, are accessible in the literature. The goal of these experiments\
    \ was \nto create WSN architectures that were simple, low-cost, energy-efficient,\
    \ and \n431\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n\
    scalable. However, several aspects of WSNs, such as minimum maintenance, \nrobust\
    \ and fault-tolerant architecture, and interoperability, require more study. \n\
    4.3. Cloud computing in agriculture \nCloud computing (CC) is defined as a model\
    \ for enabling convenient, ubiq-\nuitous, on-demand network access to a shared\
    \ pool of configurable computing \nresources (e.g., networks, servers, storage,\
    \ applications, and services) that can \nbe rapidly provisioned and released with\
    \ minimal management effort or ser-\nvice provider interaction, according to the\
    \ National Institute of Standards and \nTechnologies (NIST) [28]. The datacenter\
    \ (hardware), infrastructure, platform, \nand application layers make up the primary\
    \ architecture of CC [29]. Each of \nthese layers corresponds to one of three\
    \ cloud service models: SaaS (software \nas a service), PaaS (platform as a service),\
    \ and IaaS (infrastructure as a service) \n(IaaS). In the agriculture sector,\
    \ cloud computing has gotten a lot of attention in \nthe last decade because it\
    \ provides: 1) low-cost storage for data collected from \nvarious domains via\
    \ WSNs and other preconfigured IoT devices, 2) large-scale \ncomputer systems\
    \ to make intelligent decisions by converting raw data into \nusable knowledge,\
    \ and 3) a secure platform for developing agricultural based \nIoT applications\
    \ [30]. \nCC is used to develop various agricultural applications in conjunction\
    \ with \nIoT and WSN. CC technology is also utilized to develop operational farm\
    \ man-\nagement systems (FMSs) that help farmers and farm managers monitor farm\
    \ \nactivities more efficiently. The traceability of agri-product quality is another\
    \ \narea of interest that is being investigated in global research [31]. However,\
    \ only \npreliminary research has been done to see if traceability complies with\
    \ food \nsafety and quality criteria. The usage of cloud-based agricultural systems\
    \ has \nthe potential to address issues such as rising food demand, pollution\
    \ from pes-\nticides and fertilizers, and the safety of agricultural products.\
    \ These FMSs, on \nthe other hand, lack the flexibility to offer run-time customization\
    \ in response \nto specific farmer needs. Furthermore, because most farm data\
    \ is fragmented \nand distributed, recording farm operations accurately in existing\
    \ FMSs systems \nis problematic [32].\n4.4. Edge/fog computing in agriculture\
    \ \nThe rapid expansion of IoT has resulted in an explosion of sensors and smart\
    \ \ndevices, creating massive amounts of data. The processing and analysis of\
    \ such a \nlarge volume of data in real time is difficult since it puts a strain\
    \ on the cloud serv-\ner and slows response times. When dealing with such a massive\
    \ data set, a cloud \nserver alone will not be able to offer real-time responses.\
    \ Furthermore, because \nIoT applications require a constant exchange of information\
    \ between devices and \n432\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nthe cloud, they are susceptible to network latency, making\
    \ CC unsuitable for these \napplications [23]. The introduction of the edge computing\
    \ idea has the potential \nto overcome the CC issues. This novel computing architecture\
    \ places computa-\ntional and storage resources (such as cloudlets or fog nodes)\
    \ closer to data sources \nlike mobile devices and sensors at the network’s edge.\
    \ This allows for real-time \nanalytics while maintaining data security on the\
    \ device [23]. Although edge com-\nputing has exciting potential for smart agriculture,\
    \ its applications in agricultural \nsystems are still in their infancy. As a\
    \ result, there are limited research studies in \nthis field. The majority of\
    \ the edge computing-based agricultural systems covered \nin these papers are\
    \ prototypes that solve a small number of challenges across a \nvariety of agricultural\
    \ disciplines. Interoperability and scalability issues haven’t \ngotten enough\
    \ attention so yet. Agricultural robots combine emerging technolo-\ngies such\
    \ as computer vision; wireless sensor networks (WSNs), satellite navi-\ngation\
    \ systems (GPS), artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing (CC), and the \n\
    Internet of Things (IoT) to help farmers improve productivity and quality of ag-\n\
    ricultural products. AARS in smart farming can be mobile or fixed [33]. Mobile\
    \ \nAARS can move around the working field. Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) \n\
    and unidentified aerial vehicles (UAVs) are the two types of mobile AARSs, as\
    \ \ndiscussed in the following sections. \n4.5.1. Unmanned ground vehicles in\
    \ agriculture\nUnmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are agricultural robots that work\
    \ with-\nout the use of a human operator on the ground. A platform for locomotive\
    \ ap-\nparatus and manipulator, navigation sensors, a supervisory control system,\
    \ an \ninterface for the control system, communication links for information exchange\
    \ \nbetween devices, and system architecture for integration between hardware\
    \ and \nsoftware agents are the main components of UGVs [34]. The control architec-\n\
    ture of a UGV can be remote-operated (controlled via an interface by a human \n\
    operator) or totally autonomous (operated without the use of a human control-\n\
    ler using artificial intelligence technology) [34]. Locomotive systems, likewise,\
    \ \ncan be based on wheels, tracks, or legs [34]. Legged robots are uncommon in\
    \ \nagriculture, despite their great terrain flexibility, inherent Omni directionality,\
    \ \nand soil protection. These robots, however, offer a disruptive locomotion\
    \ mech-\nanism for smart farms when paired with wheels (wheel-legged robots).\
    \ UGVs \nshould meet specific requirements, such as small size, maneuverability,\
    \ resil-\nience, efficiency, human-friendly interface, and safety, in addition\
    \ to the nec-\nessary features for infield operations, in order to improve crop\
    \ yields and farm \nproductivity. A 4WD locomotive system is used in the majority\
    \ of agricultural \nrobotic systems due to its ease of manufacture and control.\
    \ \n433\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n\
    The disadvantage of 4WD is that terrains with stone elements and/or voids \nhave\
    \ a significant impact on the wheels [34]. As a result, other mechanisms, \nsuch\
    \ as legged or wheel-legged locomotive systems, should be investigated. \nAlthough\
    \ some robots include computer vision systems, most of these robots \nare designed\
    \ with a low-cost computer vision system, such as traditional RGB \ncameras, due\
    \ to the difficulties of establishing an accurate and dependable sys-\ntem that\
    \ can replace manual labour. Furthermore, the majority of the systems \nmentioned\
    \ above are still in the research phase, with no large-scale commer-\ncial application.\n\
    4.5.2. Unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture \nUnmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),\
    \ sometimes known as aerial robots, are \nplanes that do not have a human pilot\
    \ on board. There are many different types \nof UAVs [35] depending on the technology\
    \ used to fly (wing structure) and the \nlevel of autonomy. Fixed-wing (planes),\
    \ single-rotor (helicopter), hybrid system \n(vertical takeoff and landing), and\
    \ multi-rotor UAVs are examples of wing types \n(drone). Drones (multi-rotor technology),\
    \ which are raised and driven by four \n(quad-rotor) or six (hex-rotor) rotors,\
    \ have grown in popularity in the agricul-\nture sector because to their mechanical\
    \ simplicity in comparison to helicopters, \nwhich rely on a much more complex\
    \ plate control mechanism [36]. Similarly, \nUAVs can be tele-operated or tele-commanded,\
    \ depending on their autonomy \nlevel, with the pilot providing references to\
    \ each actuator of the aircraft to con-\ntrol it in the same way that an onboard\
    \ pilot would, or tele-commanded with the \naircraft relying on an automatic controller\
    \ on board to maintain a stable flight \n[35]. Agricultural UAVs with the right\
    \ sensors (vision, infrared, multispectral, \nand hyper spectral cameras, for\
    \ example) can collect data (vegetation, leaf area, \nand reflectance indexes)\
    \ from their fields to monitor dynamic changes in crops \nthat aren’t visible\
    \ from the ground [37]. Farmers can deduce information about \ncrop illnesses,\
    \ nutrient deficits, water level, and other agricultural growth char-\nacteristics\
    \ using this data. Farmers might plan possible cures using this knowl-\nedge (irrigation,\
    \ fertilization, weed control, etc.). \nThe majority of the systems mentioned\
    \ above are still in the research stage, \nwith no large-scale commercial use.\
    \ Other issues with these UAVs include bat-\ntery life and flight time [35]. Lithium-ion\
    \ batteries are currently in use because \ntheir capacity exceeds that of conventional\
    \ batteries. \nHowever, increasing the battery capacity increases the weight of\
    \ the drone, \nand research is currently underway to overcome this issue. \nFurthermore,\
    \ existing UAVs have complicated user interfaces that can only \nbe used by experts\
    \ to accomplish agricultural chores. People who are elderly \n434\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nor unfamiliar with UAV\
    \ technology will be able to control it more readily if \nthe user interface is\
    \ improved and made more human-centered with multimod-\nal feedback. \n4.6. Big\
    \ data and analytics in agriculture \nRapid advancements in IoT and CC technologies\
    \ have massively expanded \nthe amount of data available. Textual content (structured,\
    \ semi-structured, and un-\nstructured) and multimedia content (e.g., videos,\
    \ photos, and audio) are included \nin this data, also known as Big Data (BD)\
    \ [38]. Big data analytics is the practice \nof analyzing large amounts of data\
    \ to find hidden patterns, unknown relationships, \nmarket trends, client preferences,\
    \ and other important information (BDA). Big \ndata is usually classified into\
    \ five dimensions, each of which is represented by a V. \nThe concept of BD-driven\
    \ smart agriculture is very new, but its trend is \ngood because it has the potential\
    \ to make a dramatic change in the food supply \nchain and boost food security\
    \ through higher productivity. Agricultural big data \nis typically generated\
    \ from a variety of sources in agriculture, including ground \nsensors, aerial\
    \ vehicles, and ground vehicles equipped with special cameras and \nsensors; governmental\
    \ bodies in the form of reports and regulations; private \norganizations through\
    \ online web services; farmers in the form of knowledge \ngained through surveys;\
    \ and social media [39]. Depending on the agricultural \ndomain, the data can\
    \ be environmental (weather, climate, moisture level, etc.), \nbiological (plant\
    \ disease), or geospatial, and it comes in a variety of volumes, \nspeeds, and\
    \ formats [40]. The information is acquired and stored in a computer \ndatabase,\
    \ where it is analyzed using computer algorithms for seed characteris-\ntics,\
    \ weather patterns, soil attributes (such as pH or nutrient content), marketing\
    \ \nand trade management, consumer behaviour, and inventory management. In \n\
    agriculture, a range of strategies and tools are used to examine large data. The\
    \ \nmost often employed techniques include machine learning, cloud-based plat-\n\
    forms, and modelling and simulation. Machine learning technologies are used \n\
    to solve problems like prediction, clustering, and classification, while cloud\
    \ \nplatforms are utilized for large-scale data storage, preprocessing, and visual-\n\
    ization. There are still numerous potential areas where BDA can be used to \n\
    address various agricultural concerns that are not well covered in existing lit-\n\
    erature. For example, data-intensive greenhouses and indoor vertical farming \n\
    systems, quality control and health monitoring of crops in outdoor and indoor\
    \ \nfarms, genetic engineering, decision support platforms to help farmers design\
    \ \nindoor vertical farms, and scientific models for policymakers to help them\
    \ make \ndecisions about the physical ecosystem’s sustainability. Finally, the\
    \ majority of \nsystems are still in the prototype stage.\n435\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n4.7. Artificial intelligence\
    \ in agriculture \nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the study of theories and computer\
    \ systems that \ncan perform activities that need human intelligence, such as\
    \ sensory percep-\ntion and decision-making [41]. AI, particularly in the areas\
    \ of machine learning \n(ML) and deep learning (DL), is seen as one of the primary\
    \ forces driving the \ndigitization of agriculture when combined with CC, IoT,\
    \ and big data. These \ntechnologies have the potential to increase crop production,\
    \ harvesting, pro-\ncessing, and marketing in real time [42]. ML and DL algorithms\
    \ are being used \nto determine various parameters such as weed detection, yield\
    \ prediction, and \ndisease identification in a number of intelligent agricultural\
    \ systems. The fol-\nlowing two sub-sections go through these systems.\n4.7.1.\
    \ Machine learning in agriculture \nsupervised learning (linear regression, regression\
    \ trees, non-linear regres-\nsion, Bayesian linear regression, polynomial regression,\
    \ and support vector \nregression), and unsupervised learning (hierarchal clustering,\
    \ k-means cluster-\ning, neural networks (NN) anomaly detection, principal component\
    \ analysis, \nindependent component analysis, a-priori algorithm, and singular\
    \ value decom-\nposition (SVD)). Weed detection, Crop yield prediction, disease\
    \ and weather \nprediction (rainfall), soil properties estimation ( moisture content,\
    \ type, pH, \ntemperature, etc.), water management, fertilizer amount determination,\
    \ and \nlivestock production and management all use machine learning techniques\
    \ and \nalgorithms [2, 43]. According to the study of these publications, “crop\
    \ yield \nprediction” is an extensively researched area, with the most widely\
    \ utilized ML \napproaches to allow smart farming being linear regression [4],\
    \ neural network \n(NN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM)\
    \ [2]. \nThe presented use cases are still in the research phase, and no commercial\
    \ \nuse has been recorded as of yet. Furthermore, AI and machine learning ap-\n\
    proaches are found to be underutilized in greenhouse and indoor vertical farm-\n\
    ing systems, particularly hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. There are \n\
    only a handful publications that use machine learning techniques. To enable \n\
    digital farming, new methodologies such as federated learning and privacy \npreserving\
    \ methods are being developed in light of the digital transformation’s \ncyber-security\
    \ and data privacy problems [44]. These methods create machine \nlearning models\
    \ from local parameters rather than sharing private data samples, \nreducing security\
    \ concerns.\n4.7.2. Deep learning in agriculture \nDeep learning (DL) is an extension\
    \ of classical machine learning (ML) \nbecause extra “depth” (complexity) is added\
    \ to the model, it can accomplish \n436\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\ndifficult tasks (predictions and classification)\
    \ extraordinarily well and quick-\nly. DL’s main benefit is feature learning,\
    \ which includes extracting features \n(high-level information) from big datasets\
    \ automatically [45]. Long short term \nmemory (LSTM) networks, convolutional\
    \ neural networks (CNNs), recurrent \nneural (RNN) networks, generative adversarial\
    \ networks (GANs), radial basis \nfunction networks (RBFNs), multilayer perceptron\
    \ (MLPs), feed-forward ar-\ntificial neural network (ANN), self-organizing maps\
    \ (SOMs), deep belief net-\nworks (DBNs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs),\
    \ and autoencoders are \nexamples of deep learning algorithms Various sites [46]\
    \ provide a full overview \nof these methods, popular architectures, and training\
    \ systems. DL algorithms \nare commonly used in agriculture to solve problems\
    \ related to computer vision \napplications that aim to predict key parameters\
    \ such as crop yields, soil mois-\nture content, weather conditions, and crop\
    \ growth conditions; detect diseases, \npests, and weeds; and identify leaf or\
    \ plant species [47]. Computer vision is an \ninterdisciplinary field that has\
    \ exploded in popularity in recent years thanks to \nthe rise of CNNs. It provides\
    \ methods and techniques for accurately process-\ning digital images and allowing\
    \ computers to analyze and comprehend the vi-\nsual world [48]. CNNs, generally\
    \ is known as Convet and its derivatives, are \nthe most widely used deep learning\
    \ algorithms in agricultural applications. \nRegion-based CNNs (RCNN), Fast-RCNN,\
    \ Faster-RCNN, YOLO, and Mask-\nRCNN are some of the CNN variants, with the first\
    \ four being the most typi-\ncally used to address object detection issues. On\
    \ the other side, Mask-RCNN \nis utilized to overcome instance segmentation issues.\
    \ The reader can find a \nthorough explanation of these algorithms and their applications\
    \ in the exist-\ning bibliography [47]. Other DL approaches have been employed\
    \ in a few re-\nsearch. When it comes to datasets, the majority of deep learning\
    \ models are \ntrained on photographs, with only a few trained on sensor data\
    \ collected in the \nfield. This demonstrates that DL can be used on a wide range\
    \ of datasets. It’s \nalso worth noting that the majority of the research is focused\
    \ on outdoor farms, \nwith next-generation farms (environment-controlled) receiving\
    \ less attention. \nThough digital farming has the potential to be enabled by\
    \ DL, most systems \nare still in the prototype stage. Furthermore, the additional\
    \ obstacles created \nby cyber-security and privacy concerns necessitate the improvement\
    \ of current \ndeep learning and computer vision technologies.\n4.8. Agricultural\
    \ decision support systems \nA decision support system (DSS) is a smart system\
    \ that assists stakehold-\ners and potential users in making decisions in response\
    \ to specific needs and \nchallenges by offering operational responses based on\
    \ meaningful informa-\n437\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\ntion retrieved from raw data, documents, personal knowledge,\
    \ and/or models \n[49]. Data-driven, model-driven, communication-driven, document-driven,\
    \ and \nknowledge-driven DSS are all possibilities. The following source [50]\
    \ lists the \nkey features of these DSSs. The volume of farming data has exploded\
    \ as a re-\nsult of the advent of agriculture 4.0. Platforms like agricultural\
    \ decision support \nsystems (ADSS) are necessary to convert this heterogeneous\
    \ data into practical \nknowledge in order to make evidence-based and precise\
    \ judgments about farm \nmanagement and facility layout [51]. ADSSs have gotten\
    \ a lot of interest in the \nagriculture industry over the last few years. A variety\
    \ of agricultural concerns, \nsuch as farm management, water management, and environmental\
    \ management, \nhave been addressed by a number of ADSSs. Most ADSSs have been\
    \ found \nto ignore expert knowledge, which is extremely useful since it enables\
    \ for the \nconstruction of systems that are tailored to the demands of the users.\
    \ Complex \nGUIs, insufficient re-planning components, a lack of prediction and\
    \ forecasting \nabilities, and a lack of ability to adjust to unpredictable and\
    \ dynamic elements \nare some of the other identified faults with some of these\
    \ ADDSs. It’s also worth \nnoting that all of the ADSSs are for outside agriculture\
    \ systems and are still in \ndevelopment. In comparison, the use of ADSS in indoor\
    \ soilless agriculture is \ncurrently underutilized.\n4.9. Agricultural cyber-physical\
    \ systems \nA cyber-physical system (CPS) is an automated distributed system that\
    \ inte-\ngrates physical processes with communication networks and computing infra-\n\
    structures [52], and it is one of the key technologies of Industry 4.0. There\
    \ are \nthree standard CPS reference architecture models: 5C, RAMI 4.0, and IIRA,\
    \ \nwhich may be found in full at the following source [53]. Among these, the\
    \ 5C \nis a well-known and widely used reference model. CPS takes advantage of\
    \ a \nnumber of existing technologies, including agent systems, IoT, CC, augmented\
    \ \nreality, big data, and machine learning (ML) [54]. Scalability, flexibility,\
    \ au-\ntonomy, reliability, resilience, safety, and security are all improved\
    \ as a result \nof its adoption.\nOne of the most difficult domains that can benefit\
    \ from CPS technology is \nagriculture. Agricultural cyber-physical systems (ACPSs)\
    \ combine advanced \nelectronic technology with agricultural infrastructure to\
    \ create integrated farm \nmanagement systems that interact with the physical\
    \ environment to keep crops \ngrowing at their best [55]. ACPSs collect high-accuracy\
    \ data regarding climate, \nsoil, and crops and utilize it to manage watering,\
    \ humidity, and plant health, \namong other things. For the management of various\
    \ services, a range of ACPSs \nhave been created; however, most of these systems\
    \ are still in the prototype and \n438\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nconceptual stages. Furthermore, the majority\
    \ of studies are for outdoor farms, \nwith only a few publications published on\
    \ soil-based greenhouse systems. There \nhas been no research on indoor soilless\
    \ agricultural methods. Since of its pro-\nspective applications in a variety\
    \ of fields, ACPSs have sparked a lot of academ-\nic interest; nevertheless, deploying\
    \ CPS models in real-world applications is \nstill a difficulty because it requires\
    \ the right hardware and software [56]. When \ndesigning ACPSs, special emphasis\
    \ should be paid to autonomy, robustness, and \nresilience in order to deal with\
    \ the unpredictable nature of the environment and \nthe unknown characteristics\
    \ of agricultural facilities. ACPSs are influenced by \na variety of factors,\
    \ including humans, sensors, robots, crops, and data.. ACPSs \nmust be properly\
    \ and extensively developed to provide a seamless operation \nwhile avoiding conflicts,\
    \ errors, and disturbances.\n4.10. Digital twins in agriculture \nA digital twin\
    \ (DT) is a dynamic virtual replica of a real-life (physical) \nobject that mimics\
    \ its behaviours and states across multiple stages of the ob-\nject’s lifecycle\
    \ by combining real-world data, simulation, and machine learning \nmodels with\
    \ data analytics to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning \n[57]. The\
    \ physical and virtual entities, the physical and virtual environments, \nthe\
    \ metrology, and realization modules that perform the physical to virtual and\
    \ \nvirtual to physical connection or twinning, the twinning and twinning rate,\
    \ and \nthe physical and virtual processes are all required for a complete description\
    \ of \nthe DT concept for any physical system [58]. Because of advancements in\
    \ tech-\nnology such as the Internet of Things, big data, wireless sensor networks,\
    \ and \ncloud computing, the DT concept has gained traction. This is due to the\
    \ fact that \nthese technologies enable real-time monitoring of physical twins\
    \ at high spatial \nresolutions using both small devices and distant sensing,\
    \ which generate ev-\ner-increasing data streams [21]. In comparison to other\
    \ fields, the notion of DT \nin agricultural applications is relatively new, with\
    \ the first references appearing \nin 2017; as a result, its added value has not\
    \ yet been thoroughly studied [21]. \nBecause of its reliance on natural circumstances\
    \ (temperature, soil, humidity), \nas well as the presence of living and non-living\
    \ physical twins (plants and an-\nimals), framing is a very complex and dynamic\
    \ realm (indoor farm buildings, \ngrow beds, outdoor agricultural fields, agricultural\
    \ machinery). \nNon-living physical twins interact directly or indirectly with\
    \ plants and \nanimals (living physical twins), posing more obstacles for DT in\
    \ agriculture, \nwhereas non-living physical twins are the focus of DT in other\
    \ domains such \nas manufacturing. The majority of research has been on open-air\
    \ agricultur-\nal systems. There is just one study that proposes DT for a soil-based\
    \ vertical \n439\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6,\
    \ 2022\nfarming system and one study that implements DT for a soilless vertical\
    \ farm-\ning system (aquaponics). This could be due to the difficulty of designing\
    \ and \nmanaging modern farming systems. Furthermore, the majority of DTs are\
    \ still \nin the research phase, with no commercial deployment planned. Cost savings,\
    \ \ndisaster prevention, clearer decision making, and efficient management oper-\n\
    ations are all reported benefits of DT applications in agriculture, which can\
    \ be \napplied to a variety of agricultural subfields such as plant and animal\
    \ breeding, \naquaponics, vertical farming, cropping systems, and livestock farming.\
    \ While \nDT technology offers a lot of promise, achieving synchronization between\
    \ the \nreal and digital worlds is difficult. Due to the quirks of living physical\
    \ twins, \nthe intricacy of this procedure is magnified in agricultural settings.\
    \ As a result, \nagricultural DT should begin with micro-farms, which can then\
    \ be gradually up-\ngraded to a more intelligent and autonomous form by adding\
    \ more components.\n4.11. Roadblocks in digitization of agriculture industry \n\
    This section outlines a series of interconnected hurdles to a wider adoption of\
    \ \ndigital technologies in agriculture. Following a review of the literature,\
    \ 21 barri-\ners were found, which were divided into technical and socioeconomic\
    \ categories.\n4.12. Technical roadblocks \n•Interoperability: Data is regarded\
    \ as a critical component in the success of \nsmart systems. Agricultural data\
    \ is typically gathered from a variety of sources, \nincluding thousands of individual\
    \ farmlands, animal industries, and business ap-\nplications. Data can be in a\
    \ variety of formats, making data integration difficult. \nAs a result, after\
    \ systematic data collection, storage, processing, and knowledge \nmining, data\
    \ interoperability is critical to increasing the value of this widely \ndistributed\
    \ data [59]. Interconnected and interoperable devices are also required \nfor\
    \ successful communication between heterogeneous devices. The system’s in-\nteroperability\
    \ can be improved through cross-technology communication [60].\n•Standardization:\
    \ Standardization of devices is required to fully use digital \ntechnologies for\
    \ smart farming applications. Differences in output can occur \nas a result of\
    \ misinterpretation and changes over time. Device, application, and \nsystem interoperability\
    \ concerns can also be overcome by standardization [25].\n•Data quality: Data\
    \ quality, as well as data security, storage, and openness, \nare essential for\
    \ producing meaningful outcomes. Another impediment to the \nadoption of smart\
    \ farming technologies is the lack of decentralized data man-\nagement systems\
    \ [9]. Multiple actors’ willingness to exchange farm data is be-\ning harmed as\
    \ a result of this problem.\n•Hardware implementation: It is incredibly difficult\
    \ to establish a smart agri-\ncultural setup in large-scale open areas. This is\
    \ due to the fact that all hardware, \n440\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences\
    \ and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nincluding IoT devices, wireless sensor networks,\
    \ sensor nodes, machinery, and \nequipment, is directly exposed to harsh environmental\
    \ conditions such as heavy \nrainfall, extreme temperatures, extreme humidity,\
    \ high wind speeds, and a vari-\nety of other dangers that can destroy electronic\
    \ circuits or disrupt their normal \nfunctionality [61]. A possible answer is\
    \ to construct a sturdy and lasting casing \nfor all of the expensive devices\
    \ that can withstand real-world conditions [62].\n•Adequate power sources: Typically,\
    \ wireless gadgets used on farms func-\ntion for an extended period of time and\
    \ have a limited battery life. \nBecause replacing a battery in the event of a\
    \ failure is difficult, especially in \nopen-air farms where devices are strategically\
    \ located with limited access [61], a \nproper energy-saving system is required.\
    \ Low-power sensors and proper commu-\nnication management are two viable strategies\
    \ for reducing energy consumption \n[24, 63]. Other intriguing technologies to\
    \ eliminate the need for battery renewal by \nrecharging batteries using electromagnetic\
    \ waves include wireless power transfer \nand self-supporting wireless systems.\
    \ In most agricultural applications, however, \nlong-distance wireless charging\
    \ is required [9]. Another potential alternative is to \ncapture ambient energy\
    \ from rivers, fluid flow, vehicle movement, and the ground \nsurface using sensor\
    \ nodes; however the converted electrical energy is current-\nly restricted, necessitating\
    \ the need to enhance power conversion efficiency [64].\n•Reliability: The dependability\
    \ of devices, as well as the software applica-\ntions that run on them, is critical.\
    \ This is due to the fact that IoT devices must \ncollect and transmit data from\
    \ which judgments are made utilizing a variety of \nsoftware packages. Unreliable\
    \ sensing, processing, and transmission can result \nin erroneous monitoring data\
    \ reports, significant delays, and even data loss, all \nof which can have a negative\
    \ impact on agricultural system performance [25].\n •Adaptability: Agriculture\
    \ is a complicated, dynamic, and continuously \nchanging environment. As a result,\
    \ when building a system, it is critical for de-\nvices and applications to react\
    \ proactively with other entities in the face of un-\nknown and dynamic elements\
    \ in order to provide the required performance [65].\n•Robust wireless architectures:\
    \ Low-cost, wide-area coverage, enough net-\nworking flexibility, and high scalability\
    \ are all advantages of wireless networks \nand communication technologies. However,\
    \ in a dynamic agriculture environ-\nment, such as temperature swings, the movement\
    \ of live objects, and the ex-\nistence of impediments, dependable wireless connection\
    \ is a major difficulty. \nFor example, multipath propagation effects cause signal\
    \ strength oscillations, \nresulting in unstable connectivity and insufficient\
    \ data transmission [66]. These \nelements have an impact on the agricultural\
    \ system’s performance. As a result, \nrobust and fault-tolerant wireless architectures\
    \ with proper sensor node place-\n441\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\nment, antenna height, network topology, and communication\
    \ protocols are re-\nquired, as well as low-maintenance wireless systems [11].\n\
    •Interference: Because of the extensive deployment of IoT devices and wire-\n\
    less sensor networks, another difficulty is wireless interference and quality\
    \ of \nservice degradation. Effective channel scheduling between heterogeneous\
    \ sens-\ning devices, cognitive radio-assisted WSNs, and upcoming networking prim-\n\
    itives like concurrent transmission [67] can all help to solve these problems.\
    \ \nBecause agriculture equipment are dispersed in indoor greenhouses, outdoor\
    \ \nfarmlands, underground locations, and even aquatic areas, cross-media com-\n\
    munication between underground, underwater, and air is also necessary for full\
    \ \nintegration of smart technologies [68].\n•Security and privacy: Because smart\
    \ agricultural systems are dispersed, \nthey are vulnerable to cyber-attacks such\
    \ as eavesdropping, data integrity, de-\nnial-of-service assaults, and other sorts\
    \ of disruptions that could jeopardize the \nsystem’s privacy, integrity, and\
    \ availability [69]. With various privacy-preserv-\ning techniques and federated\
    \ learning approaches, cyber-security is a funda-\nmental concern that needs to\
    \ be addressed in the context of smart farming [44].\n•Compatibility: in order\
    \ to meet the fragmentation and scalability standards, \nthe models or software\
    \ applications developed must be adaptable and able to \nrun on any equipment\
    \ in the agricultural system [13]. \n•Resource optimization: To boost farm profitability,\
    \ farmers need a resource op-\ntimization procedure to determine the ideal number\
    \ of IoT devices and gateways, \ncloud storage size, and volume of transmitted\
    \ data. Resource optimization is diffi-\ncult since farms vary in size and require\
    \ different types of sensors to assess different \nvariables [70]. Second, most\
    \ farm management systems do not support run-time \nchanges to match the demands\
    \ of individual farmers. To estimate adequate resource \nallocation, complicated\
    \ mathematical models and algorithms are necessary [32].\n•Scalability: Due to\
    \ technological improvements, the number of gadgets, \ngear, and sensors put on\
    \ farms is continually expanding. \nGateways, network applications, and back-end\
    \ databases should all be de-\npendable and scalable in order to serve these entities\
    \ [71].\n•Human-centered user interfaces: Existing agricultural software and gadgets\
    \ \nhave complicated user interfaces, which are limiting smart farming methods.\
    \ \nThe majority of graphical user interfaces are constructed in such a way that\
    \ \nonly specialists can use them to accomplish agricultural activities. By making\
    \ \nthe user interface more human-centered and providing multimodal feedback,\
    \ a \nbigger group of individuals will be able to use it to complete various agricul-\n\
    tural tasks [35].\n442\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol.\
    \ 14, №6, 2022\n4.13. Socio-economic roadblocks \n•Gap between farmers and researchers:\
    \ Farmers’ engagement is critical to \nthe success of the agriculture industry’s\
    \ digitization. Agricultural specialists are \nfrequently unaware of the concerns\
    \ that farmers encounter during the agri-food \nproduction process, which smart\
    \ technologies could solve [16]. Furthermore, it \nis critical to completely comprehend\
    \ the nature of problems in order to create \nan appropriate smart solution. \n\
    As a result, bridging the gap between farmers, agricultural professionals, \n\
    and AI researchers is critical.\n•Expenses connected with smart systems: the costs\
    \ associated with adopt-\ning smart technology and systems are a major impediment\
    \ to the agriculture \nsector’s digitization. These expenses typically include\
    \ deployment, operation, \nand maintenance. Smart system deployment costs are\
    \ typically significant since \nthey include: I hardware installation, such as\
    \ autonomous robots and drones, \nWSNs, gateways, and base station infrastructure,\
    \ and ii) paying trained labour \nto do particular agricultural tasks [72]. Similarly,\
    \ subscriptions to centralized \nnetworks and software packages are necessary\
    \ to support data processing, con-\ntrol of IoT devices and equipment, and knowledge\
    \ exchange, which eventually \nraises operating expenses [73]. Even if service\
    \ providers occasionally provide \nfree subscription packages with limited capabilities,\
    \ storage capacity is limited. \nPeriodic maintenance is essential to ensure the\
    \ proper operation of the smart \nsystem, which adds to the total costs.\nEnvironmental,\
    \ ethical, and societal costs may also be connected with the \nadoption of smart\
    \ devices. Initiatives focusing on cooperative farming are need-\ned to overcome\
    \ cost-related roadblocks by providing: I support services for \nbetter cost management\
    \ and needed investments, and ii) hardware solutions to \ntransform conventional\
    \ equipment into smart farm-ready machinery to reduce \nhigh initial costs [73].\n\
    •Digital division: a lack of awareness of digital technology and their appli-\n\
    cations is another problem limiting the digitalization of the agriculture sector.\
    \ \nThe majority of farmers have no understanding what digital technologies are,\
    \ \nhow to install and utilize them, or which technology is appropriate for their\
    \ farm \nand matches their needs [14]. As a result, farmers must be educated on\
    \ current \nfarming technologies and processes. \nFurthermore, various tactics\
    \ are required to develop tools that use natural \nlanguage and are easily understood\
    \ by farmers with low levels of education [74]. \n•Return on investment: In agriculture,\
    \ like in other industries, the profit \nmargin is critical. When it comes to\
    \ implementing modern technologies, farm-\n443\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences\
    \ and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\ners are concerned about the time it will\
    \ take to recoup their investment and the \ndifficulty in assessing the benefits\
    \ [12].\n•Building faith in the effectiveness of smart technology in agriculture\
    \ is \ndifficult, unlike in other disciplines, because many decisions influence\
    \ systems \nthat involve both living and non-living elements, and the results\
    \ can be difficult \nto reverse [16]. In addition, the lack of verification of\
    \ the influence of digital \ntools on farm productivity exacerbates the current\
    \ difficulties.\n•Legal frameworks: different regions and nations have distinct\
    \ legal frame-\nworks that influence the deployment of digital technologies in\
    \ agriculture, par-\nticularly in monitoring and agri-food supply [31]. Similarly,\
    \ laws governing \nresource allocation (spectrum for wireless devices), data privacy,\
    \ and security \ndiffer from country to country [31].\n•Connectivity infrastructure:\
    \ In most developing nations, connectivity in-\nfrastructure is poor, limiting\
    \ access to advanced digital technologies that could \nhelp turn data from disparate\
    \ sources into useful and actionable insights [10].\n4.14. Discussion \nThe goal\
    \ of this study was to describe the new digital technologies that are \nbeing\
    \ used in the agricultural industry in order to predict the future trajectories\
    \ \nof agriculture 4.0. Big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-phys-\n\
    ical systems, and digital twins are among the technologies that have yet to be\
    \ \nfully explored in agriculture. This disparity could be due to the fact that\
    \ install-\ning advanced technologies with more complex processes can be costly,\
    \ at least \nin the early stages of their acceptance. The agricultural industry’s\
    \ development \nof these technologies is expected to speed up in the next years.\
    \ The findings of \nSLR also reveal that IoT is widely used in farms. This is\
    \ owing to the IoT’s di-\nverse capabilities, which include monitoring, tracking,\
    \ and tracing, agricultural \nmachinery, and precision agriculture [21]. One of\
    \ the key research aims within \nthe farm 4.0 techniques can be regarded to be\
    \ IoT. Nonetheless, when building \nan intelligent agricultural system, only a\
    \ few researches have examined data \nsecurity and dependability, scalability,\
    \ and interoperability. The outcomes of \nthe study also revealed that the majority\
    \ of use cases are still in the prototype \nstage. The reason for this could be\
    \ that most agricultural activities involve live \nsubjects, such as animals and\
    \ plants, or perishable products, and establish-\ning systems for living subjects\
    \ is more difficult than developing systems for \nnon-living human-made systems.\
    \ Another explanation could be that, due to the \ntrans-disciplinary character\
    \ of agriculture, it is a late adopter of technology. As a \nresult, in order\
    \ to construct intelligent systems, the agricultural community must \nbecome conversant\
    \ with all digital technologies. Finally, differences in plant/\n444\nSiberian\
    \ Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\ncrop species and\
    \ growth conditions complicate agricultural system digitaliza-\ntion [55]. In\
    \ contrast to indoor farms, the majority of the technologies created \nby SLR\
    \ are for open-air soil-based farms (soilless and soil-based). This is owing \n\
    to the complicated design and maintenance of indoor farms, particularly soilless\
    \ \nfarms, where the parameters and elements to be maintained are numerous (pH,\
    \ \nair temperature, humidity, etc.) [5]. However, by incorporating digital technol-\n\
    ogy and data-driven computer applications into indoor farms, a more reliable \n\
    control of the process can be attained. Furthermore, SLR reveals that insufficient\
    \ \nresearch is undertaken in three of the nine service areas described in section\
    \ 3 \n(soil management, fruit detection and counting, and crop quality management).\
    \ \nThis supports the notion that significant research and development is required\
    \ \nin some areas to ensure the successful digitization of the agriculture business\
    \ \nin both developed and developing countries. The agriculture ecosystem’s com-\n\
    plexity creates a set of interrelated hurdles that prevent full integration of\
    \ digital \ntechnology for agriculture 4.0 implementation. As a result, identifying\
    \ possible \nbottlenecks is critical in order to devise strategic strategies to\
    \ overcome them. \nThis research aims to figure out what these stumbling barriers\
    \ are. Following \nthe investigation, 21 barriers were found and characterized\
    \ on both a technical \nand socioeconomic level. These impediments are addressed\
    \ in section 5, which \noutlines what needs to be done on a bigger scale to digitize\
    \ the agricultural \neconomy. However, it is still unknown how much removing or\
    \ mitigating these \nhurdles aids in the successful integration of digital technologies.\
    \ \n4.16. Added value of agricultural digitization \nSeveral benefits that can\
    \ inspire framers and other actors to assist agriculture \nindustry digitization\
    \ have been discovered and outlined based on analysis. The \nbenefits described\
    \ here have the potential to increase farm productivity and im-\nprove product\
    \ quality, but they should not be viewed as a cure for the problems \nthat come\
    \ with smart agriculture [73]. \n•Improved agility: Farm operations can now be\
    \ more agile thanks to digital \ntechnologies. Farmers and agricultural professionals\
    \ can quickly respond to \nany anticipated changes in environmental and water\
    \ conditions using real-time \nsurveillance and forecasting technologies to save\
    \ crops [72].\n•Green process: By lowering the use of in-field fuel, nitrogen\
    \ fertilizers, \npesticides, and herbicides, digital technologies make farming\
    \ more ecologically \nfriendly and climate-resilient [75].\n•Resource efficiency:\
    \ By increasing the quantity and quality of agricultural \noutput while reducing\
    \ the use of water, energy, fertilizers, and pesticides, digital \nplatforms can\
    \ improve resource efficiency [3]. \n445\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n•Time and cost savings: By automating various\
    \ tasks such as harvesting, sow-\ning, or irrigation, managing the application\
    \ of fertilizers or pesticides, and sched-\nuling irrigation, digital technologies\
    \ provide significant time and cost savings [76].\n•Asset management: digital\
    \ technologies enable real-time observation of \nfarm holdings and equipment,\
    \ allowing for theft prevention, component re-\nplacement, and routine maintenance\
    \ [10].\n•Product safety: By eliminating fraud [17, 18] linked to adulteration,\
    \ coun-\nterfeiting, and artificial enhancement, digital technologies maintain\
    \ appropriate \nfarm output and ensure a safe and nutritious supply of agri-food\
    \ products [69].\n4.17. Considerations and future prospects \nThe agricultural\
    \ industry would see major benefits as a result of the planned \nmeasures. However,\
    \ the impediments identified in section 5 must be solved first \nin order to make\
    \ things sustainable for small and medium-scale growers. Some \nof the above hurdles\
    \ can be mitigated by awareness campaigns emphasizing the \nimportance of smart\
    \ agriculture at every level of the agricultural value chain and \nencouraging\
    \ novel techniques (such as gamification) to encourage stakeholders \nto take\
    \ an active role in the digital transformation [9]. Initiatives at the federal\
    \ \nlevel, grants and endowments, public-private collaborations, data transparency,\
    \ \nand regional research efforts can all help overcome potential hurdles. Finally,\
    \ \nwhen constructing a smart agriculture system, a roadmap can be used, starting\
    \ \nwith a basic architecture with few components and simpler functionality and\
    \ \ngradually adding components and functionality to develop a sophisticated sys-\n\
    tem with full digitization potential [21]. These issues can pave the road for\
    \ ag-\nriculture 4.0’s successful adoption. The use of explainable artificial\
    \ intelligence \nto monitor crop development, estimate crop biomass, evaluate\
    \ crop health, and \ncontrol pests and diseases is one of the future prospects\
    \ of digital technologies \nin smart agriculture. Explainable AI eliminates the\
    \ old black-box approach of \nmachine learning and allows for a better understanding\
    \ of the reasoning behind \nany given decision [15]. The use of common semantics\
    \ and ontologies to de-\nscribe big data, as well as the adoption of open standards,\
    \ has the potential to \naccelerate research and development in the field of smart\
    \ farming. Similarly, \n5G technology must be thoroughly investigated in order\
    \ to enable improved \nconnectivity and live streaming of crop data [6]. By executing\
    \ precise crop in-\nspections remotely, 5G technology will reduce internet costs\
    \ and enhance the \nentire user experience of farm management and food safety\
    \ [77]. It would also \nhelp to close the gap between stakeholders by keeping\
    \ them informed about \ncrop availability. Finally, blockchain can be used in\
    \ conjunction with IoT and \nother technologies to address data privacy and security\
    \ concerns [78]. \n446\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol.\
    \ 14, №6, 2022\n4.18. Transition to Agriculture 5.0 \nThe agriculture sector has\
    \ traditionally had a breakthrough during industri-\nal revolutions. Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 offers significant potential to offset rising food \ndemands and prepare\
    \ for the future by reinforcing agricultural systems with \nWSN, IoT, AI, and\
    \ other technologies, as formally mentioned in preceding \nsections. While agricultural\
    \ 4.0 is still being implemented, agriculture 5.0 is \nalready being discussed.\
    \ \nAgriculture 5.0 builds on agriculture 4.0 by incorporating industry 5.0 prin-\n\
    ciples to provide healthy, affordable food while also ensuring that the environ-\n\
    ments on which life depends are not degraded [79]. Industry 4.0 focuses less \n\
    on the original principles of social fairness and sustainability and more on dig-\n\
    italization and AI-driven technologies for increasing efficiency and flexibility,\
    \ \nthe European Commission formally called for the Fifth Industrial Revolution\
    \ \n(industry 5.0) in 2021 [80]. Industry 5.0 adds to and expands on the industry\
    \ 4.0 \nconcepts by emphasizing human-centricity, sustainability, and resiliency\
    \ [81]. \nIt entails improving human-machine collaboration, decreasing environmental\
    \ \neffect through the circular economy, and designing systems with a high degree\
    \ \nof robustness to reach an ideal balance of efficiency and productivity. Among\
    \ \nthe enabling technologies of industry are cobots (collaborative robots), smart\
    \ \nmaterials with embedded bio-inspired sensors, digital twins, AI, energy efficient\
    \ \nand secure data management, renewable energy sources, and others 5.0[80].\n\
    Farm production efficiency and crop quality can be improved in agriculture \n\
    5.0 settings by delegating repetitive and boring activities to machines and those\
    \ \nthat need critical thinking to humans. For this reason, agricultural cyber\
    \ physical \ncognitive systems (CPCS) that observe/study the environment and conduct\
    \ ap-\npropriate actions, comparable to those established for the manufacturing\
    \ sector, \nshould be developed. This might include collaborative farm robots\
    \ that work in \nthe fields to aid crop growers with time-consuming operations\
    \ like seed sowing \nand harvesting. Similarly, digital twins in agriculture 5.0\
    \ can add substantial value \nby recognizing technical difficulties in agricultural\
    \ systems and resolving them \nmore quickly, detecting crop illnesses, and producing\
    \ more accurate crop output \nestimates. This demonstrates that agriculture 5.0\
    \ has the potential to pave the way \nfor climate-smart, sustainable, and resilient\
    \ agriculture, but it is still in its infancy. \n5. Conclusions \nConcerns about\
    \ global food security have heightened the demand for \nnext-generation industrial\
    \ farms and agricultural intensive production systems. \nDigital technologies,\
    \ such as those given by the Industry 4.0 programme, are at \n447\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nthe vanguard of this modern\
    \ agricultural period, providing a wide range of in-\nnovative solutions. Disruptive\
    \ technologies are being integrated into traditional \nagriculture systems by\
    \ scientists and researchers in order to boost crop yields, \ncut costs, reduce\
    \ waste, and sustain process inputs. This report includes an SLR \nthat discusses\
    \ the current state of various technologies in the agriculture sector. \nSeveral\
    \ findings are drawn, including the fact that big data and analytics inte-\ngration,\
    \ wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins in \nagriculture\
    \ are still in their infancy, with the majority of use cases still in the \nprototype\
    \ stage. Similarly, 21 technological and socioeconomic impediments \nare found\
    \ and categorized. These impediments must be identified and addressed \nif the\
    \ agriculture industry is to be digitalized. The report also identifies and \n\
    presents the additional value of digital technology in the agriculture industry.\
    \ \nOverall, this research contributes to the ongoing research on agricultural\
    \ 4.0. \nThe review’s principal restriction is twofold: first, only three online\
    \ reposito-\nries (Scopus, IEEE, and Science Direct) are considered for literature\
    \ searches, \nand second, new keywords and synonyms may return more papers. The\
    \ main \nconclusions are highly unlikely to alter in either scenario. Additional\
    \ research \ndatabases and areas can be considered for future study in order to\
    \ provide a \ncomplete overview of the agriculture industry in terms of digitization.\
    \ In addi-\ntion, papers focusing on agriculture 5.0 in general will be featured.\n\

    \ capability of 5G with low delay, high density, and large\nbandwidth provides\
    \ a communication guarantee for the application of other information\ntechnologies\
    \ in the smart agricultural Internet of Things. Smart agriculture has relied on\
    \ the\nﬁfth generation of information technology 5G, the Internet of Things, robotics,\
    \ drones, big\ndata, AI, machine learning, blockchain, and other key technologies\
    \ to transform modern\nagriculture. It realizes the deep integration of the physical\
    \ world and the information\nworld, changing the current mode of agricultural\
    \ production. Industry-oriented universal\nwide-area Internet of Things is becoming\
    \ the main force [9]. It can promote the expansion\nand upgrading of IoTs in smart\
    \ agriculture and expedite the landing application of big data\nin smart agriculture.\
    \ It is the key to the in-depth application of UAV in agriculture and is\nan important\
    \ booster for integrating artiﬁcial intelligence and robot blockchain in smart\n\
    agriculture [10].\nThe Internet of Things continues to evolve with the evolution\
    \ of information technol-\nogy and sensors. It should not only perceive and transmit\
    \ data but also have functions such\nas recognition, computation, service, semantics,\
    \ and even cognitive decision-making [11].\nThe detection, management, and maintenance\
    \ functions of the Internet of Things will\nalso gradually become intelligent\
    \ and unmanned. The in-depth integration of the Inter-\nnet of Things, big data,\
    \ and artiﬁcial intelligence will revolutionize the current form of\nElectronics\
    \ 2023, 12, 2336\n5 of 46\nthe Internet of Things and generate huge social value\
    \ [12]. As an important part of new\ndigital infrastructure, the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) is deeply integrated with 5G, big data,\ncloud computing, artiﬁcial intelligence,\
    \ blockchain, digital twin, and other technologies,\nand is evolving into a smart\
    \ IoT system (IoTs 2.0) [13], which is profoundly changing\nthe process of the\
    \ modern agricultural industry and promoting the rapid development of\nsmart agriculture.\n\
    In the ﬁeld of smart agriculture, the Agricultural Internet of Things (AIoT) is\
    \ devel-\noping rapidly, but still faces many challenges. This includes the new\
    \ application of the\nagricultural scene, the transformation of the new agricultural\
    \ production mode, and the\ndeep integration with other technologies. As a basic\
    \ condition for the in-depth application\nof the agricultural Internet of Things,\
    \ 5G communication technology will promote the\nin-depth application of the agricultural\
    \ Internet of Things in smart agriculture. 5G can\nprovide MTC communication with\
    \ high reliability, low delay, and wide coverage, and its\nthree typical application\
    \ scenarios have broad prospects in smart agriculture [14]. 5G IoT\ntechnology\
    \ can be extended to the scope of current, which cannot be achieved with the\n\
    ﬁeld, making IoT depth perception of the intelligent environment perception, enlarging\n\
    the coverage of the Internet of Things of agriculture and the ascending scale,\
    \ expanding\nthe communication capacity, and realizing large-scale equipment interact\
    \ with each other\nand data sharing so as to realize the agricultural decision-making\
    \ process depth [15]. 5G-\nIoT is expected to provide real-time, on-demand, online,\
    \ reconﬁgurable, and end-to-end\ncoordinated capabilities for a variety of agricultural\
    \ applications. It can provide logically\nindependent network applications and\
    \ conﬁgure networks on demand. According to the\nfuture agricultural needs, the\
    \ integration of 5G with smart agriculture and the Internet of\nThings will be\
    \ able to achieve network characteristics, as shown in Figure 5.\nof the modern\

    \ and improve productivity [48,49].\nIn the 5G smart farm [50], the shading system,\
    \ fresh air system, cooling system,\nfertilization and watering system, data acquisition\
    \ system, and light supplement system\nachieved 5G control. For example, intelligent\

    \ With the continuous development of video acquisition equip-\nment, HD images\
    \ and videos are becoming increasingly popular. Optimizing data trans-\nmission\
    \ has always been a challenge. The integrated application of smart agriculture\
    \ based\non 5G is a big direction.\n2.2.2. Large-Scale Machine Type Communication\
    \ (mMTC) in Smart Agricultural IoT\nSmart agricultural IoT is the next generation\
    \ of agricultural IoT for smart agriculture.\nIt needs a depth perception of the\
    \ agricultural production process. Large-scale agricultural\nproduction scenarios\
    \ require large-scale sensing nodes to transmit data [56]. Traditional\nsensor\
    \ networks have some difﬁculties in networking reliability, energy efﬁciency,\
    \ and\ndeployment cost. However, large-scale machine-type communication based\
    \ on 5G can\nachieve a smart agricultural IoT with low cost, high reliability,\
    \ low power consumption,\nand convenient networking and deployment. For example,\
    \ NB-IoT can be deployed to\nquickly monitor soil, fertilizer, and plants in farmland.\
    \ In this way, the comprehensive\nperception and depth perception of agricultural\
    \ production can be realized, providing\nsupport for the deepening application\
    \ of smart agriculture [57].\n5G-oriented NB-IoT enables dense sensing network\
    \ deployment. Combining com-\nputer vision and other technologies can effectively\
    \ extract plant phenotypic variation\nand its related information. Moreover, machine\
    \ learning, artiﬁcial intelligence, and other\ncutting-edge technologies are used\
    \ for processing [58]. Deep learning convolutional neural\nnetworks were used\
    \ to evaluate crop phenotypic characteristics and soil conditions. Multi-\nspectral\
    \ imaging in agricultural areas is based on IoT sensors and small unmanned aerial\n\
    vehicles (UAVs). It identiﬁes plant quality and leaf diseases.\n2.2.3. Ultra-Reliable\
    \ Low Latency Communication (uRLLC) in Smart Agricultural IoT\nSuch ultra-reliable\
    \ low-latency communication applications are generally oriented to\nmission-critical,\
    \ real-time transmission of critical data and control of major agricultural\n\
    equipment [59]. Drones based on 5G networks can achieve precision operations.\
    \ The\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2336\n12 of 46\nﬂight trajectory and situation data\
    \ of the UAV can be returned to the 5G network UAV\nmanagement and operation platform\
    \ in real-time through the 5G network. Flight status can\nbe monitored in real-time\
    \ [60]. Through the agricultural information collected by UAV and\nsatellite remote\
    \ sensing technology, the platform can intelligently and dynamically analyze\n\
    the crop situation in the monitoring region, make a macroscopic estimation of\
    \ the real-time\nseedling situation, environmental dynamics and distribution of\
    \ crops, and output scientiﬁc\nreports [61]. According to the report, farmers\
    \ can clearly grasp the growth situation of\ncrops and soil moisture and manage\
    \ production in response to problems so as to ensure\nmore scientiﬁc and efﬁcient\
    \ farming activities.\nThe universal application of 5G will provide the communication\
    \ basis for unmanned,\nintelligent, and intelligent agricultural machinery and\
    \ equipment because 5G technology\nhas the characteristics of high speed, short\
    \ delay, low power consumption, ubiquitous\nnetwork, and scalability. It will\
    \ shine in the ﬁelds of agricultural Internet of Things,\nprecision planting,\
    \ agricultural products circulation traceability, agricultural drones, smart\n\
    farming, agricultural industry services, and so on, and promote agriculture to\
    \ be more\ninformationalized and intelligent [62,63].\n2.3. Future Trends and\
    \ Key Technologies of 5G-IoT Application in Smart Agriculture\nIt can be seen\
    \ from the above analysis that the integration of 5G and IoT has a wide\napplication\
    \ prospect in the scenario of smart agriculture. Agricultural IoT can be used\
    \ to\ncollect environmental monitoring information on crop growth and process\
    \ this information\nto develop the production plan of precision agriculture. Precision\
    \ agriculture requires\nthe network to support the connection of massive devices\
    \ and a large number of small\ndata packets. Since agricultural IoT devices are\
    \ often deployed in areas where signals are\nchallenging to reach, such as mountains,\
    \ forests, and waters, 5G can meet the requirements\nwith stronger coverage capability,\
    \ ﬂexibility, scalability, and lower power consumption,\ndelay, and cost. The\
    \ future trends of intelligent agricultural IoT facing 5G mainly reﬂect\nthe following:\n\
    1.\nCloud edge collaboration: agricultural monitoring terminal and cloud collaboration.\n\
    2.\nCloud computing/AI/big data/Internet of Things/digital twin and other agricul-\n\
    tural integration.\n3.\nVirtualization and servitization of perception/access/communication\
    \ layer, software\ndeﬁned network.\n4.\nModel-driven, cloud-native new application\
    \ (APP) development environment for\nsmart Internet of Things.\n5.\nThe deep integration\
    \ of people, information space, and physical space will form\na deep intelligent\
    \ smart agriculture and achieve a harmonious ecology of human–\nmachine symbiosis.\n\
    The key technologies of IoT applications in smart agriculture include vital informa-\n\
    tion sensor technology, phenotype information acquisition technology, phenotype\
    \ group\ndata analysis technology, phenotype group big data management and database\
    \ building\ntechnology, etc. [64,65]. All these technologies need the support\
    \ of 5G. Among them,\nthe life information sensor technology collects information\
    \ about seeds and their propa-\ngation/seed production environment and obtains\
    \ the corresponding physiological and\necological information through signal transformation\
    \ and AI data processing. Phenotypic\ninformation acquisition technology automatically\
    \ extracts important phenotypic features\nand logical relationships from massive\
    \ amounts of information to realize automatic and\naccurate identiﬁcation of phenotypic\
    \ traits. Phenotypic data analysis technology covers the\ncomplete process from\
    \ the initial data collection to the ﬁnal reﬁnement analysis. Phenotype\ngroup\
    \ big data management and database building technology are used to manage, store,\n\
    and share tabular data.\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2336\n13 of 46\n3. Evolution of\
    \ Intelligent Agricultural IoT 2.0 for 5G\nIntelligent Internet of Things (IoT\
    \ 2.0) refers to a complex system that integrates “hu-\nman, information space\
    \ and physical space” [66] under the guidance of 5G and other\ncommunication technologies\
    \ and AI technologies and intelligently interconnects and serves\ncooperatively.\
    \ Among them, the new generation of AI technologies includes data-driven\ndeep\
    \ reinforcement learning intelligence, network-based swarm intelligence, hybrid\
    \ in-\ntelligence oriented by human–machine and brain–computer interaction technology,\
    \ cross-\nmedia inference intelligence, autonomous intelligent system, etc. The\
    \ “wisdom” of the\nsmart IoT system refers to the interconnection of people, information\
    \ space and physi-\ncal space, and the digitalization, IoT, servitization (cloud),\
    \ collaboration, customization,\nﬂexibility, greenness, and intelligence of the\
    \ layered and progressive system [67].\nThe Internet of Things is evolving into\
    \ the next generation. Under the role of 5G, the\nInternet of Things combined\
    \ with big data, machine learning, cloud services, and so on, will\nhave intelligent\
    \ characteristics. It can make the physical process and the information world\n\
    deep integration. The network level of the Internet of Things mainly includes\
    \ monitoring,\ndetection, computing, service, and control from bottom to top,\
    \ and these connotations will\nalso undergo profound changes.\n3.1. 5G Smart Agricultural\
    \ IoT 2.0 Architecture\nWith the rapid development of video business and various\
    \ vertical business applica-\ntions in smart agriculture, centralized data storage\
    \ and processing modes will face difﬁcult\nbottlenecks and pressures. The existing\
    \ Internet of Things architecture is difﬁcult to meet\nthe data return of big\
    \ data, which easily deteriorates network indicators and affects user\nexperience.\
    \ In this case, data processing capabilities and services need to be provided\n\
    near the edge of the network where the data are generated. With the development\
    \ of\n5G and the availability of relevant business requirements and network conditions,\
    \ edge\ncomputing has gradually achieved great development. Agricultural IoT is\
    \ evolving to\nSmart Agricultural IoT 2.0, where edge computing can alleviate\
    \ these defects of centralized\nIoT, and transfer computing tasks to the edge\
    \ service side to signiﬁcantly improve delay\nand energy consumption, especially\
    \ for delay and energy-sensitive IoT applications.\n5G IoT for smart agriculture\
    \ achieves optimal resource allocation through network\nslicing, SDN/VFN, and\
    \ other technologies. However, due to a large amount of sensing\ndata in the smart\
    \ agriculture scene, the real-time requirement is high. With the increase in\n\
    terminal computing power, the network architecture for smart agriculture will\
    \ also change.\nThe architecture of a smart IoT system is shown in Figure 11.\n\
    5G-based agricultural IoT can be implemented by deploying edge computing based\
    \ on\napplication needs. Edge computing migrates IT resources, such as computing\
    \ and storage,\nfrom traditional cloud data centers to users. IT shortens the\
    \ physical distance between\nusers and IT resources, achieves lower data interaction\
    \ delay, and saves network trafﬁc.\nThis provides users with low latency and high\
    \ stability of IT solutions. Edge computation\ndepends on edge nodes. The requirements\
    \ of edge nodes for smart agricultural IoT are\nnot strictly regulated. Compared\
    \ with the general sensor node thought and its computing\npower, the communication\
    \ ability is stronger. The deployment position is usually at the\nend of the network,\
    \ that is, the application site. After IoT edge applications are deployed,\nedge\
    \ nodes serve as extensions of remote IoT platforms on devices. Devices are managed\n\
    through cloud-edge collaboration. Edge nodes can provide computing and management\n\
    services for nearby devices, such as local management of low-latency services,\
    \ local control,\nand rule execution when disconnected from the cloud. The device\
    \ accesses the edge node\nand ﬁnally uploads data to the remote IoT platform through\
    \ the edge node, as shown in\nFigure 12.\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2336\n14 of 46\n\

    3.2.1. Intelligent Agricultural IoT Sensing Device Based on 5G\nIn order to adapt\
    \ to the performance of the smart agricultural Internet of Things and\nthe advantages\
    \ of 5G, such as high speed, high density, low delay, low power consumption,\n\
    and wide coverage, the software and hardware of traditional sensing devices need\
    \ to\nbe changed.\nThe carrier bandwidth of 5G communication varies from 180 K\
    \ to 200 M [72]. Com-\nmunication rates also range from a multi-point uplink rate\
    \ of 56 kbps for narrowband IoT\nto a maximum peak rate of 10 Gbps. The 180 K\
    \ carrier bandwidth is speciﬁcally targeted\nat low-rate NB-IoT applications,\
    \ featuring strong signal strength, strong penetration, and\ngood coverage radius\
    \ and depth coverage. It is mainly suitable for some IoT terminal\napplications\
    \ with low data rates and most of the time in hibernation state. Such applica-\n\
    tions are widely used in smart agriculture and many other applications, such as\
    \ ecological\nenvironment monitoring, because many plants and animals have long\
    \ growth cycles and\nslow changes. There are four typical applications of NB-IoT,\
    \ as shown in Table 6.\nSecondly, such applications mainly change the hardware\
    \ of sensor nodes in terms of\nantenna communication module and low-power design\
    \ [73,74]. The module of the terminal\nnode device based on NB-IoT will also change\
    \ correspondingly, as shown in Figure 15.\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2336\n17 of 46\n\

    \ and classify various crop pests and\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2336\n22 of 46\n\
    diseases, which improved the recognition accuracy. Thus, the development of agricultural\n\
    informatization and precision was further promoted [90].\nAs an important branch\
    \ of machine learning, deep learning network is becoming\na hot technology with\
    \ its powerful data analysis ability. Deep learning networks can\ncontain hundreds\
    \ of hidden layers, and the features will be transformed a lot of times.\nDeep\
    \ learning can be applied to identify crop pests and disease targets. For achieving\n\
    the relationship ﬁtting of complex sample data, the core idea is not only to automatically\n\
    extract multi-layer feature representations from a large amount of data through\
    \ a variety of\nlinear and nonlinear transformations but also to complete the\
    \ task of feature extraction and\ntransformation using supervised and unsupervised\
    \ combined training methods [91]. Due\nto the structure of a deep neural network,\
    \ the error features extracted by the previous layer\nnetwork can be weakened\
    \ to a certain extent, and the complex function can be expressed\nwith fewer parameters.\
    \ The structure of the deep neural network will be more compact,\nwhich improves\
    \ the efﬁciency and performance of the network.\nIt is obvious that the current\
    \ methods with strong pattern recognition ability are\nparticularly dependent\
    \ on a large amount of data, which requires enough data to draw\nuseful conclusions.\
    \ The traditional agricultural IoT data are limited, which is challenging to\n\
    support the data collection needs of future smart agriculture development. The\
    \ introduction\nof 5G and smart agricultural IoT provides conditions for the collection\
    \ of massive data.\n3.4. Cloud Edge Fog Computing Fusion in 5G Intelligent Agricultural\
    \ Internet of Things\nIn future smart agricultural IoT, data will be extremely\
    \ abundant, and how to conduct\nanalysis and calculation from these data to guide\
    \ modern agricultural production is an\nimportant challenge.\nDue to the limitations\
    \ of volume and battery life, many mobile devices deployed in\nagricultural production\
    \ cannot meet the requirements of these applications in terms of\ncomputing, storage,\
    \ energy, and other resources. Therefore, Mobile Cloud Computing\n(MCC) technology\
    \ has been proposed. It provides reorganized computing resources for\nmobile devices\
    \ in the cloud platform, migrates data processing and storage to the cloud,\n\
    and reduces constraints on its own resources. With the development of smart agriculture,\n\
    massive data will be generated in the future to be analyzed, processed, and stored\
    \ in the\ncentral cloud [92]. At the same time, there may be a large number of\
    \ connections between\nsensing devices, and these MCCS cannot meet the demand.\
    \ New computing methods, such\nas edge computing and fog computing, will be integrated\
    \ into the intelligent agricultural\nIoT system [93]. Edge sensors no longer need\
    \ to continuously transmit various sensing\ndata to the data center. It can judge\
    \ the sensing data on its own, contacting the data center\nonly when there is\
    \ a signiﬁcant change in the reading to decide what action to take. Cloud\ncomputing\
    \ is suitable for non-real-time, long-period data, and business decision scenarios,\n\
    while edge computing plays an irreplaceable role in real-time, short-period data,\
    \ and local\ndecision-making. Edge computing and cloud computing are two important\
    \ supports for\nthe digital transformation of the industry. Their collaboration\
    \ in the network, business,\napplication, intelligence, and other aspects will\
    \ help support the agricultural IoT to create\ngreater value. Intelligent edge\
    \ computing based on 5G power can use the cloud for large-\nscale security conﬁguration,\
    \ deployment, the management of edge devices, and the ability\nto assign intelligence\
    \ based on device type and scenario, allowing intelligence to ﬂow\nbetween the\
    \ cloud and the edge. The edge computing model in smart agriculture is shown\n\
    in Figure 22.\nSecondly, with the continuous enrichment of data in smart agricultural\
    \ IoT, the tra-\nditional forms of computing will become richer and richer. Distributed\
    \ computing based\non cloud computing, fog computing, and other forms will be\
    \ deeply integrated with 5G\ncommunication capabilities and applied to smart agriculture.\
    \ Agriculture, for wisdom in\ngreenhouse cultivation, oriented precision fertilization,\
    \ aquaculture, animal husbandry,\nand aquaculture, the scene such as plant monitoring,\
    \ needs the edge of the Internet of\nThings system IoT terminal according to the\
    \ scientiﬁc planting and breeding, fertilizers\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2336\n23\
    \ of 46\nand other professional industry model, implement local sampling, local\
    \ operations, and\nlocal decisions at the same time, according to the requirement\
    \ of the center’s continuously\nupdated mathematical model and iteration. Therefore,\
    \ the intelligent Internet of Things\nterminal should be based on the requirements\
    \ of fog computing and edge computing\narchitecture, rely on the machine learning\
    \ and algorithm training of cloud computing\ncenter, complete, reliable real-time\
    \ deep computing, accurately control on-site facilities and\nequipment, and achieve\
    \ the purpose of scientiﬁc planting and breeding.\nFigure 22. Smart agriculture\

    \ Agricultural IoT Application Paradigm under 5G\n4.1. Typical Application Scenarios\
    \ of 5G Smart Agricultural IoT\nThe development of 5G network will provide the\
    \ infrastructure needed for smart\nagriculture for agricultural production. The\
    \ main application scenarios include the follow-\ning aspects.\n4.1.1. Smart Farm\n\
    The two characteristics of 5G network, high speed and large connection, will help\n\
    the agricultural industry implement large-scale machine services. Centralized\
    \ control\nof environmental sensors, planters, UAVs, and other monitoring equipment\
    \ and real-\ntime data transmission. Finally, the purpose of intensive farming,\
    \ accurate fertilization,\nand reasonable irrigation is achieved [97]. Agricultural\
    \ machinery automatic agricultural\nmachinery equipment based on 5G was integrated\
    \ to achieve rapid, large-area, efﬁcient,\nand precise spraying operation [98].\n\
    4.1.2. Smart Forestry\nSmart forestry utilizes 5G network video, UAV, and other\
    \ monitoring equipment to\ncarry out forest inspection, realize the monitoring\
    \ of forest resources, forest pests and\ndiseases, wild animals and plants, forest\
    \ ﬁre prevention, and provide guide and rescue\nservices for staff and tourists\
    \ [99].\n4.1.3. Intelligent Animal Husbandry\n5G intelligent animal husbandry\
    \ can improve the production efﬁciency of animal\nhusbandry, reduce the cost of\
    \ breeding, prevent livestock epidemic and livestock loss, and\nprotect animal\
    \ husbandry ecology [100,101]. For example, the use of 5G drone technology,\n\
    wearing 5G terminals on the necks of cows, and the use of Internet of Things technology\
    \ to\nmanage yaks have brought great changes to the traditional herding work of\
    \ plateau herders.\n4.1.4. Smart Fishing Ground\n5G smart ﬁshing grounds use monitoring\
    \ equipment such as high-deﬁnition net-\nwork cameras and underwater camera systems\
    \ to carry out real-scene monitoring, aquatic\nproduct growth monitoring, and\
    \ precise bait casting to improve the safety of underwater\noperations and save\
    \ labor costs [102]. In the Marine ranch, 5G panoramic monitoring appli-\ncation\
    \ is realized through 5G coverage. The panoramic high-deﬁnition camera equipment\n\
    and 5G underwater camera system were set up to realize the 24-h panoramic monitoring\
    \ of\nthe ranch. Managers can observe the growth of aquatic products, including\
    \ underwater\nobservation, from their ofﬁces or homes through mobile phones [103].\
    \ Based on 5G technol-\nogy, the intelligent control of the production process\
    \ of Marine cash crops, including kelp\nand other seedlings, can also be realized,\
    \ making it possible to have unmanned Marine\nranching.\n4.2. Deep Sense of 5G\

    \ Intelligent agricultural\nmachinery can perceive its position, surrounding environment\
    \ relationship, and the inter-\nnal working state of machinery by building machine\
    \ vision, multi-dimensional perception,\nand satellite positioning based on 5G\
    \ agricultural Internet of Things. It can achieve good\ncooperation and scientiﬁc\
    \ implementation, effectively improving the effect of agricultural\nmechanization\
    \ by controlling and operating each process. Intelligent agricultural machin-\n\
    ery 5G-based agricultural Internet of Things can realize real-time monitoring\
    \ of agricultural\nmachinery’s own condition, operating state of machinery and\
    \ tools, meteorological condi-\ntions, and operating environment. It can also\
    \ guide agricultural machinery to adjust the\noperation plan in time according\
    \ to the obtained information and effectively reduce the\nindustrial machinery\
    \ in the process of operation failure, such as machine damage, poor\nquality,\
    \ and other problems. In addition to the above, intelligent agricultural machinery\n\
    will reduce the amount of ineffective operation of industrial machinery. Energy\
    \ efﬁciency\nhas been signiﬁcantly improved. The precise operation also realizes\
    \ the precise applica-\ntion of pesticides and fertilizers and truly realizes\
    \ the requirements of energy-saving and\nenvironmental protection.\nIt is clear\
    \ that smart agriculture combined with the Internet of Things and machine\nlearning\
    \ algorithm big data can transform traditional agricultural machinery and equip-\n\
    ment, making them more intelligent. In addition, the operation of intelligent\
    \ detection\nand sensing equipment can realize the functions of agricultural machinery\
    \ positioning,\nreal-time statistics of agricultural machinery working area, and\
    \ real-time calculation of\noperation quality. The system supports a variety of\

    \ harvesting, deep loosening, and land prepara-\ntion, straw returning, and so\
    \ on. It can measure fuel consumption and obtain the working\ncondition information\
    \ of agricultural machinery in real-time. This facilitates the control\nof agricultural\
    \ production progress and facilitates the real-time control of the working\narea,\

    agricultural machinery by the controller so that the agricultural machinery can\
    \ drive\nautomatically according to the set route (straight line or curve). It\
    \ can effectively improve\nthe working accuracy, improve the land utilization\
    \ rate, reduce the labor intensity of\nmachine hands, and extend the working time\
    \ (ﬁeld work can also be carried out at night).\nMoreover, it is easy to operate\
    \ and reduces the requirement for the driving ability of the\nmanipulator [121,122].\
    \ Based on the Beidou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) [123,124], a\nglobal Positioning\
    \ system (GPS) can achieve intelligent driving of all kinds of agricultural\n\
    machinery, including rice transplanters, seed drills, combine harvesters, etc.\
    \ The high-\nprecision positioning and navigation technology, image recognition,\
    \ and transmission\ntechnology are applied to the intelligent driving of these\
    \ machines to realize the precise\nnavigation of agricultural machinery driving\
    \ and automatically complete the land tillage,\nsowing, ﬁeld management, and harvest,\

    \ signals. 5G networks give UAVs im-\nportant capabilities such as ultra-high-definition\
    \ video transmission, remote networking, \nand autonomous flight. 5G technology\
    \ makes it possible for fleets of drones to work to-\ngether and around the clock.\
    \ It has huge development space in agriculture, security, elec-\ntricity, and\
    \ other industries [125]. The plant protection UAV is small in size, light in\
    \ \nweight, flexible for flight control, and has good applicability to different\
    \ plots and crops. \nAt the platform end, the networked UAV can be remotely controlled\
    \ to set functions such \nas assigning tasks, designing routes independently,\
    \ sending back spraying data in real \ntime, and automatically returning after\
    \ an operation. Plant protection UAVs reduce pesti-\ncides, save water consumption\
    \ and improve pesticides [126]. The steady wind field gen-\nerated by the rotor\
    \ of the UAV can penetrate the bottom of the crop, and the atomization \neffect\
    \ is good, reaching the back of the blade. \nLive broadcasts of rice by unmanned\
    \ aerial vehicles are relatively popular in south \nChina, which can sow 300~600\
    \ mu per day, 3~5 times that of ground machinery. At the \nsame time, it eliminates\
    \ the process of seedling, raising, transporting, and transplanting. \nThe drone\
    \ can adjust the nozzle size according to the size of the seed. Spray the seeds\
    \ in \nrows and columns as needed. The UAV can also spray granular fertilizer\
    \ and pesticides. \nAccording to the difference in particle density and quality,\
    \ it can automatically adjust the \nparameters of the medicine box to provide\
    \ efficient and intelligent fertilization and appli-\ncation schemes. \nThe drones\
    \ carry a range of remote sensing equipment that can photograph the \ngrowth of\
    \ crops. Remote sensing images combined with extensive data analysis can real-\n\
    ize the functions of crop monitoring, fertilization advice, and pest and disease\
    \ prediction. \nDifferent yields reflect different infrared spectra, which can\
    \ be used to measure the area \nof crops. Pests and diseases can be analyzed by\
    \ infrared spectroscopy and high-definition \nphotographs. \nFor forest management,\
    \ 5G drone ground stations will be deployed around the forest \nfarm, covering\
    \ an area of about 100 km. The drones are equipped with equipment, such \nas optical\
    \ cameras and high-definition cameras, to monitor vegetation growth and forest\
    \ \ncover. Through big data analysis of tree varieties and survival rate, replanting\
    \ suggestions \ncan also predict the occurrence of forest pests and diseases and\
    \ put forward prevention \nFigure 33. Schematic diagram of unmanned agricultural\

    \ and survival rate, replanting suggestions can also\npredict the occurrence of\
    \ forest pests and diseases and put forward prevention and control\nsuggestions.\
    \ In terms of forest ﬁre control, inspection routes can be planned according to\n\
    daily needs, and the UAV will automatically alarm if there is any abnormality\
    \ [127]. If the\nforest is on ﬁre, drones can be sent to check the ﬁre, and the\
    \ ﬁre can be used to identify the\npoint of ﬁre.\nAccording to the different functions\
    \ of agricultural UAVs, as shown in Figure 34,\nthey can be divided into two categories:\
    \ agricultural operation and farmland information\ncollection. Agricultural operation\
    \ refers to the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to\nreplace some human\
    \ agricultural operations and to solve the shortage of human operations\nin quality,\
    \ efﬁciency, and labor, as well as the safety problems of operations. The collection\n\
    of farmland information refers to the timely and accurate collection of ﬁeld information\n\
    using remote sensing detection technology, including photosynthetic quality, soil\
    \ moisture,\nand crop population growth [128,129].\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2336\n\

    \ challenges remain in the current application of agricultural drones: \nFirst,\
    \ the endurance time of agricultural UAVs is short, which cannot adapt to multi-\n\
    ple types of complex operations in the field. \nSecond, it is difficult to control.\
    \ Most of the intelligence degree is low, and anti-colli-\nsion and other functions\
    \ are lacking. \nThird, the precision application control technology based on\
    \ agricultural information \nis not mature enough. During aerial spraying operations,\
    \ agricultural information such as \ncrop growth, pests, and diseases in different\
    \ operating areas were obtained by aerial re-\nmote sensing technology, and prescription\
    \ maps were generated to determine the pesti-\ncide preparations and dosage required\
    \ for aerial spraying in different areas. The precision \napplication of plant\
    \ protection UAVs was realized by variable control technology. \nAll the above\
    \ have put forward new requirements for the intelligence degree of \nUAVs, mainly\
    \ including intelligent control, precise operation, better function, and optimi-\n\
    zation of spraying equipment. For the precise control of UAVs, it is necessary\
    \ to consume \nmore abundant information to meet its control needs. Secondly,\
    \ the real-time control \nneeds to be strengthened and satisfied, and the large\
    \ bandwidth and low delay of 5G can \nmeet the above requirements. It can be expected\
    \ that the popularity of 5G will be expected \nto promote the further development\
    \ of agricultural drones. \n4.5. 5G Intelligent Agricultural Supply Chain Management\
    \ \nAgricultural products have various production processes, long cycles, and\
    \ numerous \nfactors, so it is challenging to realize standardized production\
    \ and management [130]. The \nsupply chain of agricultural products is in all\
    \ stages of agriculture before, during, and \nafter production. Participants participate\
    \ in different roles of producers and consumers to \nrealize the supply and circulation\
    \ of agricultural products among agricultural producers, \nagricultural materials/agricultural\
    \ service enterprises, wholesale and retail markets, reg-\nulatory agencies, and\
    \ end consumers. It connects the production, processing, transporta-\ntion, sales,\
    \ and other links of agricultural products and integrates logistics, capital flow,\
    \ \nand information flow. It is important to establish a chain structure network\
    \ composed of \nagricultural product suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers,\
    \ and end consumers \n[131]. Traditional agricultural supply chain participants\
    \ mainly use the Internet of Things \ntechnology to achieve information collection,\
    \ transmission, processing, processing, and \nother businesses. However, as IoT\
    \ systems are built in different participant systems, they \nbelong to different\
    \ platforms. For the seemingly interconnected network, the business is \nFigure\

    independent, unable to quickly and effectively complete the exchange of information,\
    \ the\nreal realization of the whole process of sharing, presentation, and other\
    \ difﬁculties.\nThe traditional Internet is to reduce intermediate links, reduce\
    \ transaction costs,\nexpand the scope of service, improve service quality, and\

    \ smart agriculture Internet of Things.\nThese new problems bring new challenges\
    \ to the application of smart agriculture.\nMany of these key issues may be partially\
    \ solved with the introduction of 5G technology.\n5G is the infrastructure of\
    \ the intelligent era. Its characteristics of “extremely high\nspeed, enormous\
    \ capacity and extremely low delay” can provide basic support for meeting\nthe\
    \ development needs of smart agriculture in the future. Compared with the 2–4G\
    \ era,\nthe demand for base stations and network control equipment has increased\
    \ signiﬁcantly\nin 5G. The large-scale application of 5G technology not only increases\
    \ the cost of network\ninfrastructure, but also the cost of power and operation,\
    \ and maintenance is much higher\nthan that of 4G, which brings challenges to\
    \ the ﬁeld agricultural production with low added\nvalue. However, 5G technology\
    \ still has limits when it comes to applications such as virtual\nreality, intelligent\
    \ production, and driverless driving. First, the deployment of 5G base\nstations\
    \ is not balanced. As many 5G base stations are distributed in sparsely populated\n\
    areas, such as ﬁelds, agriculture, and farming, there may be only a few 5G base\
    \ stations\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2336\n35 of 46\nin these areas, which cannot\
    \ effectively cover all of them, which brings challenges to the\npopularization\
    \ and application. Secondly, the introduction of 5G will bring a change of the\n\
    whole smart agriculture application paradigm. The architecture, perception, transmission,\n\
    computing, service, processing, and application mode of 5G Internet of Things\
    \ for smart\nagriculture will bring changes, and there will be challenges.\n5.1.\
    \ Fusion and Optimization of Sparse 5G Base Station and Heterogeneous Sensing\
    \ Network in\nSmart Agriculture\n5.1.1. Optimization of Hybrid Deployment of 5G\
    \ and Sensing Network\nAccording to the analysis, the characteristics of 5G network\
    \ in agriculture are sparse,\nuneven, and they have low coverage of network base\
    \ stations and slow deployment of\nfarm base stations in remote areas. This brings\
    \ challenges for the application of 5G in ﬁeld\nagriculture and plantation agriculture.\n\
    For this imbalance and sparsity feature, it can be conﬁgured from two aspects.\
    \ One is\nto optimize the deployment of sensing nodes, and the other is to deploy\
    \ in combination\nwith heterogeneous networks. The hybrid deployment strategy\
    \ for ﬁeld agriculture, for ex-\nample, 5G sensing nodes are deployed in key areas,\
    \ and other sensing nodes are deployed\nin other areas, and sensing deployment\
    \ optimization is realized through network resource\nvirtualization and other\
    \ technologies. When the communication nodes of large-scale in-\ntelligent agricultural\
    \ sensor networks are deployed in three-dimensional space under the\nbackground\
    \ of 5G, the traditional random node deployment mode has the problems of high\n\
    energy consumption, high cost, and node disconnection. Firstly, by taking advantage\
    \ of the\ncharacteristics of the high bandwidth of 5G communication, a hierarchical\
    \ communication\nscheme can be designed, and a hierarchical node optimal deployment\
    \ model, a communi-\ncation energy consumption model, and a fully connected sensor\
    \ information transmission\nnetwork model are established. On the premise of ensuring\
    \ the full connectivity of sensor\ncommunication network nodes in farmland, the\
    \ life cycle of communication network nodes\nis improved.\n(a) 5G sparse deployment\
    \ based on ﬁeld agricultural planting scenarios.\nCombined with the actual ﬁeld\
    \ agricultural planting scene, the 5G base station has a\nhigh working frequency\
    \ band and a large signal attenuation, and its coverage radius is only\n0.3–0.5\
    \ times that of the 4G base station. It is difﬁcult to meet the goal of low cost\
    \ and high\nbeneﬁt of network construction only by deploying a macro base station.\
    \ The micro-base\nstation has a small coverage radius and low construction cost.\
    \ In order to optimize the\ndeployment cost of 5G base stations, the heterogeneous\
    \ network architecture of “macro\nand micro collaboration” can be adopted. How\
    \ to combine smart agricultural business for\noptimal deployment is an important\
    \ issue. Heterogeneous networks can optimize the cost\nof 5G signal deployment\
    \ while realizing the coverage of agricultural operation areas and\noptimizing\
    \ the perceived cost.\n(b) Intensive deployment optimization of 5G and sensing\
    \ nodes in ﬁne agriculture.\nIn ﬁne agriculture, there are many parameters to\
    \ monitor, many types of business, and\nthe need for intensive sensing equipment,\
    \ which generates an explosion of mobile data.\nHow to realize intelligent and\
    \ efﬁcient green deployment planning of intelligent nodes such\nas base stations\
    \ and gateways with large area coverage for various intelligent agricultural\n\
    applications is one of the key issues. By deploying small base stations with lower\
    \ cost\nand closer to users, it becomes a feasible solution to construct ultra-dense\
    \ heterogeneous\nnetworks centered on monitoring objects.\n5.1.2. Optimization\
    \ of 5G and Sensing Network Gateway Deployment\nPreviously, the deployment optimization\
    \ of sensing nodes and 5G base stations were\nproposed in ﬁne agriculture. In\
    \ the integration of 5G and sensing devices in deployment, it\nis necessary to\
    \ combine the collaboration of the Internet of Things gateway to realize the\n\
    high-low speed switching and transmission of sensing data.\nElectronics 2023,\
    \ 12, 2336\n36 of 46\n(a) The deployment of edge gateway in the Internet of Things.\
    \ The conditions of edge\ngateway coverage and service terminal trafﬁc generator,\
    \ the factors affecting the ofﬂoad-\ning delay of computing tasks, and the constraints\
    \ of edge gateway capacity allocation.\nFollowing that, the edge gateway deployment\
    \ optimization model was established and\noptimized.\n(b) To solve the problem\
    \ of base station deployment in the Low Power Wide Area\nNetwork (LPWAN), the\
    \ received signal values of all terminal test points can be predicted\nby combining\
    \ the terminal receiving signal prediction module. Then, the prediction results\n\
    are transformed into the weight values of all terminal test points during clustering,\
    \ and\nthe terminal test points are clustered. In addition, the location of the\
    \ base station was\nadjusted to achieve the optimal coverage effect and realize\
    \ the deployment optimization in\nthe whole application scenario.\n5.2. Optimization\
    \ Control under Edge Computing in 5G Intelligent Agricultural Production\nThe\
    \ popularization and application of 5G intelligent agricultural Internet of Things\
    \ will\nbring major challenges to the traditional cloud computing model, such\
    \ as high latency and\njitter, no support for location awareness and mobility,\
    \ and non-adaptive communication\ntypes. The production of smart agriculture often\
    \ needs to deploy edge computing to\nachieve real-time computing and reasonable\
    \ allocation of resources.\n5.2.1. Automatic Phenotype Monitoring Based on 5G\
    \ Internet of Things\nBy monitoring and sensing plant growth phenotype, the analysis\
    \ of crop traits is\nof great reference signiﬁcance for cultivating crop varieties\
    \ with excellent traits such as\ndrought resistance, poison resistance, lodging\
    \ resistance, high nutrient rate, and salt and\nalkali resistance. It helps researchers\
    \ select seeds of good quality for the next generation of\nbreeding objects. There\
    \ are many common image-based phenotyping methods in the ﬁeld\nof plant phenotype.\
    \ Among them, the image recognition method based on visible light has\nlower requirements\
    \ on experimental equipment, higher practicability, and can collect large-\nscale\
    \ plant image data. Therefore, the current deep learning can be better applied\
    \ to those\nalgorithms that use visible light images. All these require high-speed\
    \ data transmission,\nand how to collect and control real-time data in multi-source\
    \ sensing devices is a problem\nworth studying. At present, the main concern of\
    \ plant leaf recognition methods based on\nvisible light images is that there\
    \ are not many kinds of recognition methods. There are many\nresearchers working\
    \ on automatic phenotypic sensing platforms, which require automatic\nsensing\
    \ data pickup. Combining the advantages of high bandwidth and dense deployment\n\
    of 5G to realize automatic measurement and real-time computation of phenotype\
    \ is a\nproblem worth studying.\n5.2.2. Intelligent Sensing Real-Time Control\
    \ for Intelligent Agricultural Machinery\nMore intelligent agricultural machinery\
    \ will participate in the future smart agriculture.\nThey can combine 5G Internet\
    \ of Things and edge computing to realize smart agricultural\nproduction. Among\
    \ them they face the real-time control of equipment, which requires\nrapid data\
    \ collection and processing.\nIn the operation of smart agricultural machinery,\
    \ sensors deployed on the roadside of\nfarmland can sense all kinds of environments\
    \ and obtain important trafﬁc information. For\nexample, ﬁxed sensors such as\
    \ vision sensors and millimeter wave sensors are installed\non the side of the\
    \ road, and the information collected by the sensors is sent to the edge\nserver\
    \ for processing to extract information such as vehicle location and vehicle trajectory.\n\
    According to the multi-source information obtained by roadside sensors, crop sensors,\n\
    and smart agricultural sensing equipment, real-time data processing is carried\
    \ out to\nanalyze the operation status and calculate the results. Mobile edge\
    \ computing provides\npowerful computing and storage capabilities. The side camera\
    \ and millimeter wave radar\nare fused based on the edge server. Through data\
    \ preprocessing, space synchronization,\ntime synchronization, and tracking algorithm,\
    \ they can cooperate with each other, jointly\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2336\n37\
    \ of 46\nbuilding an intelligent agricultural machinery environment sensing system\
    \ to make it more\nstable and reliable.\nDuring the operation of intelligent agricultural\
    \ machinery, target tracking should focus\non the following points: (1) Object\
    \ association: radar detection should be associated with\ncamera detection, while\
    \ the current fusion detection must be associated with the existing\ntrajectory;\
    \ (2) Tracking link: appropriate ﬁlter should be selected for tracking; (3) Tracking\n\
    management: tracking object database needs to be maintained.\n5.3. Scheduling\
    \ Optimization of Heterogeneous Nodes under 5G Smart Agriculture\nHow to optimize\
    \ the scheduling of sensing nodes in different rates, resources, and\nnetworks\
    \ is a problem to be studied in the intelligent agricultural IoT under 5G.\n5.3.1.\
    \ Sense Scheduling for 5G Smart Agriculture\nUnder such circumstances, how to\
    \ optimize the deployment of network resources and\nnodes to achieve better overall\
    \ network performance is a problem worth studying.\n(a). Sensing task collaboration\
    \ based on 5G: Sensing task collaboration is a hot issue in\nsensor networks.\
    \ Based on the connectivity, coverage, survivability, and task completion\nrequirements\
    \ of the network, this paper proposes a collaboration mechanism based on\nthe\
    \ limited energy, computing, and storage capacity of the sensing nodes and the\
    \ task\ncompletion requirements. The network topology is reconstructed by adjusting\
    \ the transmit\npower of nodes, neighbor selection, sleep scheduling, or mobile\
    \ node location. The decom-\nposition, assignment, scheduling, and execution of\
    \ tasks are accomplished cooperatively by\ncoordinating the behavior of mobile\
    \ sensor nodes. Topology reconstruction optimization is\nmainly carried out in\
    \ edge nodes and load balancing. In smart agriculture, the perception\nequipment\
    \ is more diverse, and the perception task is more complex.\n(b). Cooperative\
    \ scheduling of large agricultural machinery equipment: agriculture-\noriented\
    \ large agricultural machinery includes unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), mutual\n\
    sensing, and task coordination of multi-aerial robots. For example, building the\
    \ social\nInternet of Things creates a dynamic social network for each object\
    \ connected to the Internet\nof Things. Social networks are extended through node\
    \ proﬁles and trust levels to ﬁnd\nobjects that contribute to IoT applications\
    \ and solve resource management problems. Assign\nsensitive tasks fairly to objects\
    \ in the social network. How to optimize the sensing task\nof massive heterogeneous\
    \ sensing devices in the Internet of Things for smart agriculture.\nIt is still\
    \ a challenge to realize the efﬁcient collection of sensing data and the maximum\n\
    efﬁciency of network resources by abstracting network resources.\n5.3.2. Optimization\
    \ of 5G Network Signal Coverage Scheduling for Agricultural UAV\nIn addition to\
    \ the upstream and downstream rate, end-to-end delay of services, end-\nto-end\
    \ delay of control, and positioning accuracy, the coverage height of wireless\
    \ signals is\none of the most important requirements for 5G networks in agriculture.\n\
    According to the requirements of UAV network indicators in each scenario in IMT-\n\
    2020 (5G), Advance Group—White Paper on 5G UAV Application, the coverage height\n\
    requirements of wireless signals of networked UAV in the application ﬁeld are\
    \ shown in\nTable 9.\nOn the basis of the existing network, it is technically\
    \ feasible to deploy a small number\nof base stations for the 5G communication\
    \ requirements of agricultural UAVs. However,\nthe actual network planning still\
    \ needs to focus on several issues.\n(a) Adjacent area planning.\nIn order to\
    \ make connected UAVs ﬂy continuously in the air, in addition to seamless\n5G\
    \ wireless network signals, civil UAVs also need to be able to switch smoothly\
    \ between\ndifferent cells and different base stations. In this way, it is necessary\
    \ to cover the high\nlevel of the community to have a reasonable neighborhood\
    \ relationship. In addition, the\nUAV communication terminal needs to switch from\
    \ the low-level 5G wireless network\nto the high-level 5G wireless network when\
    \ taking off. This also requires reasonable\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2336\n38 of\
    \ 46\nneighborhood planning between the 5G cell covering the high-rise and its\
    \ neighboring 5G\ncell. Similarly, the UAV communication terminal needs to switch\
    \ from the high-level 5G\nwireless network to the low-level 5G wireless network\
    \ when landing. It is also necessary to\nmake reasonable neighborhood planning\
    \ between the 5G cell covering the low layer and\nits adjacent high-rise 5G cell.\
    \ Its switching band is controlled at about 100 m in the air.\n(b) Interference\
    \ problem.\n5G wireless networks are also self-interfering systems. All base stations\
    \ share a band-\nwidth of 100 MHz. Therefore, it is necessary to control the coverage\
    \ of the signal through\nreasonable planning and optimization. In this way, it\
    \ is necessary to avoid discontinuous\ncoverage or blind coverage caused by insufﬁcient\
    \ signal, and to avoid interference in other\ncommunities due to over coverage.\
    \ At the same time, the mutual interference between\nthe 5G cell covering the\
    \ lower layer and the 5G cell covering the upper layer should be\navoided. Of\
    \ course, this will require a long period of experimentation and exploration.\n\

    \ Agricultural Platform\nSmart agriculture 5G-IoT faces increasing network scale\
    \ and density, dense terminal\nconnections, and higher intelligence, and the failure\
    \ rate will increase. The production\nefﬁciency of large-scale smart agriculture\
    \ is an important issue. With the integration of\n5G, many intelligent applications\
    \ will be gradually popularized. These apps are built\naround the 5G Internet\
    \ of Things. How to quickly identify the faulty node or device and\nthe self-healing\
    \ ability of the platform are important research issues.\n5.4.1. Node Fault Identiﬁcation\
    \ and Early Warning Based on Heterogeneous Sensing\nData Fusion\nCombining the\
    \ collected sensing data for computational analysis and network topol-\nogy to\
    \ identify node faults is a problem worth studying. Due to the mixed deployment\n\
    of 5G and various sensing devices, mixed data sources, multi-hop communication,\
    \ and\ntransmission route changes, how to realize the fault identiﬁcation of sensing\
    \ nodes and\npossible fault detection is an important research issue.\n5.4.2.\
    \ Research on Fault Tolerance Based on 5G Heterogeneous Fusion Sensing Network\n\
    Traditional perceptual networks generally assume unreliable perception. The actual\n\
    agricultural production will appear to be all kinds of failures. Because of the\
    \ intensive\ndeployment, the cost of ensuring all reliable operations is high.\
    \ Therefore, it is worth\nstudying that fault tolerance can guarantee the normal\
    \ operation of the whole agricultural\nproduction in a certain period of time\
    \ under limited fault.\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2336\n39 of 46\n5.4.3. Self-Healing\
    \ Mechanism Based on 5G Heterogeneous Fusion Sensing Network\nIn smart agriculture,\
    \ production is blocked due to the failure of the sensing equipment\nnetwork,\
    \ which affects efﬁciency. Therefore, it is necessary to study how to self-heal\
    \ after\nfaults occur, such as network topology self-healing, to guarantee node\
    \ pathways. For\nexample, perceptual repair under dense nodes. An additional example\
    \ is 5G gateway\ncoverage self-healing.\n5.5. AI Application Optimization for\
    \ 5G Intelligent Agricultural Internet of Things\nThe application of 5G brings\
    \ new opportunities for smart agriculture, which is ex-\npected to solve the problem\
    \ of data transmission and storage. With the development of\nartiﬁcial intelligence,\
    \ it is an important issue to study lightweight deep artiﬁcial intelligence\n\
    algorithms or platforms combined with various scenarios of smart agriculture.\n\
    Artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms represented by deep learning have laid the foundation\n\
    for many scenarios of smart agriculture applications. With the popularization\
    \ of 5G, the\nrange of application scenarios of smart agriculture will be greatly\
    \ expanded. However, the\ncurrent existence represented by deep learning will\
    \ face the important challenge of how to\nachieve reliable and effective operation\
    \ under the condition of small cost in the scenario of\nsmart agriculture, relying\
    \ on massive data and powerful computing power.\n5.5.1. Lightweight Deep Learning\
    \ Algorithm Based on 5G-IoT Edge Computing\nEdge computing equipment has some\
    \ computing ability, but its computing ability is\nnot enough for massive data\
    \ model training. The challenge is how to design deep learning\nor machine learning\
    \ algorithms suitable for agricultural production. Better results can\nbe obtained\
    \ by training on small sample data, reducing the amount of data transmission,\n\
    reducing the cost of communication resources, and improving the real-time accuracy,\
    \ which\nis a problem worth studying.\n5.5.2. Multi-Source Data-Sensing Machine\
    \ Learning Algorithm for Smart Agriculture\nIn the 5G scenario, sensing nodes\
    \ are densely deployed, and heterogeneous sensing\ndata need to be calculated\
    \ and analyzed to serve the upper layer. However, there are\noften low data quality,\
    \ multi-source, heterogeneous, and multi-modal sensing data, and\nchanges in network\
    \ topology. How to calculate these mixed and redundant low-quality\ndata by clustering,\
    \ statistics, Bayesian, and other machine learning methods is an important\nresearch\
    \ problem.\n5.6. 5G-IoT System Service Model for Smart Agriculture\nAn important\
    \ means to promote the implementation of smart agriculture is the in-\nformation\
    \ physical fusion system based on 5G. The typical application mode of smart\n\
    agriculture is to comprehensively perceive agricultural information through the\
    \ agricul-\ntural Internet of Things. Massive sensing devices for agricultural\
    \ IoT are deployed in the\nwhole process of agricultural production and processing.\
    \ Various information (environ-\nmental temperature and humidity, soil moisture,\
    \ carbon dioxide, images, etc.) is collected\nthrough various networks, including\
    \ 5G. Traditional agricultural models will be changed\nby means of cloud computing,\
    \ big data, edge computing, and artiﬁcial intelligence. It can\nrealize intelligent\
    \ perception, intelligent warning, intelligent decision-making, intelligent\n\
    analysis, and expert online guidance of agricultural production environment to\
    \ provide\nprecise planting, visual management, and intelligent decision-making\
    \ for agricultural\nproduction. This is to realize the intelligent management\
    \ of agricultural visual remote\ndiagnosis, remote control, disaster warning,\
    \ and so on, and gradually establish the visual\ncommunication and application\
    \ mode of agricultural information services. Relying on\nthe knowledge of agricultural\
    \ experts stored in the knowledge base, reasoning, analysis,\nand other mechanisms\
    \ were used to guide the production and circulation of agriculture\nand animal\
    \ husbandry. It promotes the transformation of traditional agriculture, which\
    \ is\nhuman-centered and relies on isolated machinery production mode, to modern\
    \ smart agri-\nElectronics 2023, 12, 2336\n40 of 46\nculture, which is based on\
    \ information and software production mode. How to construct\nan appropriate application\
    \ service paradigm and model for intelligent agriculture 5G-IoT\nis an important\
    \ issue to be studied.\n5.7. Security Issues of 5G Internet of Things for Smart\
    \ Agriculture\nThe future of intelligent agriculture is highly intelligent, informationized,\
    \ and un-\nmanned, and security issues should be a concern. Due to the application\
    \ of 5G technology,\nthere are many data ﬂows and information ﬂows which are prone\
    \ to data deception, etc.,\nwhich will lead to serious consequences, such as the\
    \ death of crops or the poor quality of\nanimal husbandry objects caused by incorrect\
    \ pesticide spraying.\nAt present, there are many research results on the security\
    \ of the Internet of Things.\nIn general, attacks in IoT applications are classiﬁed\
    \ using the following two criteria: (1)\ninternal or external attacks and (2)\
    \ passive or active attacks. Therefore, the threat model can\nbe classiﬁed into\
    \ attacks targeting privacy, authentication, conﬁdentiality, availability, and\n\
    integrity attributes based on the characteristics of attacks that attempt to compromise\
    \ IoT\nagricultural nodes, namely IoT devices, fog nodes, and cloud nodes. 5G\
    \ itself is relatively\nsecure. However, due to the speciﬁc application scenarios,\
    \ the security problems of smart\nagriculture have their speciﬁc characteristics,\
    \ which require joint analysis and research.\n5.7.1. Information Traceability\
    \ of the Whole Process of Intelligent Agricultural Production\nBased on 5G Blockchain\n\
    Food safety has always been a matter of great concern to the public. The traditional\n\
    tracing system has some shortcomings, such as information opacity, data easy to\
    \ be tam-\npered with, poor security, and relative closure. In the future, the\
    \ development of 5G,\ncombined with blockchain technology and its unique advantages,\
    \ will provide a new\nsolution for the reliable traceability of the agricultural\
    \ supply chain. In combination with\nthe communication capability of 5G, blockchain\
    \ technology can be combined with the\nsensing equipment of the agricultural Internet\
    \ of Things for semantic segmentation and\ntracking to achieve high security.\n\
    5.7.2. Intrusion Detection for Intelligent Agricultural Production Based on 5G\n\
    With the popularization of 5G Internet of Things in smart agriculture, the degree\n\
    of intelligent and networked agricultural production is getting higher and higher,\
    \ and\nmore and more security issues need to be paid attention to. Unique security\
    \ issues and\nvulnerabilities may arise, including network, control, communications,\
    \ services, etc. How\nto combine the agricultural production process and the structural\
    \ characteristics of 5G IoT\nto establish a security mechanism, rapid detection,\
    \ and early warning of the intrusion of\nkey steps in the production process is\
    \ an important challenge in the future.\n6. Summary\nIn the future, smart agriculture,\
    \ after 5G technology transformation and upgrading,\nwill show the following characteristics:\
    \ unmanned operation, precise production, reﬁned\ncultivation, standardized production,\
    \ and intelligent supervision. Due to its low latency,\nmassive data transmission,\
    \ and massive connectivity, 5G is contributing to the development\nof IoT in agriculture.\
    \ The combination of 5G with other technologies has spawned a number\nof agricultural\
    \ applications to reduce the environmental impact of pesticides, protect natural\n\
    resources, improve animal welfare and help farmers increase yields and save costs.\
    \ This\npaper summarizes the impact of 5G on the Internet of Things, smart agriculture,\
    \ and related\ntechnologies. The key technologies and scientiﬁc issues affecting\
    \ the development of 5G-IoT\nwere analyzed to provide some ideas for the development\
    \ of 5G in smart agriculture. The\nscope of smart agriculture is relatively large,\
    \ and many details have not been discussed\nin-depth. Further efforts will be\
    \ made in the future.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, J.L., L.S. and\

    Abstract In the modern world, the Internet of Things (IoT) has captured most of
    the applications in the market and it plays a significant role with various smart
    and interactive things that have provided a convenient environment for humans.
    Applications of IoT can be broadly classified based on consumer application, enterprise
    application, infrastructure management, industrial productivity, and so on. Some
    of the applications that implement the concepts of IoT are smart wearables, connected
    cars, industrial internet, precision agriculture, smart retail, energy management
    systems, and others. Advancement in IoT technology has resulted in automated home
    appliances and healthcare systems and also in the development of smart cities,
    smart homes, smart towns, and many more. For any application based on IoT, data
    are collected and are modeled using prediction analysis. The basic concept of
    using IoT is that it reduces waste, loss, and cost. The design of the IoT application
    should focus on increasing the energy efficiency and the cost efficiency of the
    system, improving safety, or creating better experiences. IoT is a field of the
    network, and it could be enabled either by wired or wireless communication networks.
    This refers to the technology where the machines could predict the data and work
    by itself. Here the devices that are connected to the private internet connection
    could communicate with others. The edge devices that are connected will create
    a huge amount of data. These data are generated at high speed, and also they face
    challenges like storage, computation, and networking. These issues can be handled
    by using cloud, edge, or cloud edge computing. This chapter focuses on the discussion
    of diverse applications in IoT because of its huge potential market, and also
    it enhances the comfort of our lives besides providing enhanced control of our
    daily and personal tasks with ease. Keywords IoT architecture IoT applications

    of Things (IoT) The term “Internet of Things” came into existence from 1999. Internet
    of Things has the power to change the world and is a system of interconnection
    between uniquely identifiable computing devices and mechanical and digital machines.
    This interconnection is made without involving human-to-human or human-to-machine
    interaction, and instead the data are transferred over the network. Internet of
    Things is a general concept where the devices could gather the data around the
    world and could share the data over the network where it could be utilized for
    various purposes. Wikipedia states, “The Internet of Things (IoT) is the interconnection
    of uniquely identifiable embedded computing devices within the existing Internet
    infrastructure”; i.e., it connects the embedded system to the internet. In recent
    years, there is an enormous development in the IoT field. Embedded systems are
    much attractive because of their low cost, low space, low power consumption, and
    autonomous factors. It also includes other factors such as I/O speed and cost,
    energy consumption, etc., based on the instructions. Figure 5.1, obtained from
    Wikipedia, depicts the technological roadmap for Internet of Things. From this
    figure, it can be observed that by 2000, RFID tags were used to track the routing
    of the inventory to prevent the loss of logistics. This paved way for increase
    in the demand for logistics by providing support for the supply chain helpers.
    By the mid of 2000–2010, vertical-market applications such as surveillance, security,
    healthcare, transport, food safety, document mapping have seen a great development
    in technological aspects. This development in vertical-market applications has
    led to the progression of ubiquitous computing, in which the technology helps
    to locate people and everyday objects. Locating the objects that reside anywhere
    even indoors or undergrounds where satellite technologies may be unavailable or
    inadequate is called ubiquitous positioning. As a next stage, the progress is
    towards the physical-world web for miniaturization, power-efficient electronics
    and available spectrum to control distant objects. Fig. 5.1 Technology roadmap:
    The Internet of Things Full size image Internet of Things could also be defined
    as the network of sensors where the data are exchanged under the connectivity
    using network protocols and systems. The exchange of data may be bidirectional
    or unidirectional where any one system could send or receive data or both. The
    organizations or the field of applications which heavily rely on data will make
    use of cloud, fog, or edge computing. These computing architectures help in greatly
    utilizing the variety of computing techniques, resources that provide data storage,
    and these also include the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) [1]. Though these
    computing mechanisms sound similar, they form different layers in IIoT. Figure
    5.2 is obtained from (www.winsystems.com); in this image, the authors have described
    the layers of IIoT. According to this site, cloud computing (or cloud layer) is
    treated as a major layer, and the extended layers of it are edge computing (or
    edge layer) and fog computing (or fog layer). These fog and edge layers are a
    collection of servers which includes distributed network. These layers help the
    organization by giving feasibility; hence, they need not keep the entire infrastructure
    on their own premises. This feasibility makes the data to be collected from any
    place, and it can also enhance the ability to access data allover. In order to
    increase the utilization of end-users and the IIoT devices, recent enterprises
    are moving towards edge or fog infrastructure. Fig. 5.2 IIoT data processing layer
    stack Full size image Fog and edge computing look similar in terms of intelligence
    and also in the way the data are processed. But they differ in identifying the
    location of the intelligence and also in power computation. In edge computing
    environment, intelligence is placed in devices like embedded automation controllers,
    whereas fog computing environment places intelligence in the local area network
    (LAN) itself. For processing the power, fog computing uses edge devices and the
    gateways along with the LAN, but in the case of edge, the processing power is
    placed with the intelligence. Hence, the most challenging features in this computing
    are power consumption, latency, security, and also the data size which can be
    distributed across the network. Older IoT technologies include a virtually infinite
    number of endpoints connected to the network. Because of this advantage, data
    collection and processing has become a biggest challenge. In order to solve this
    challenge, edge computing is introduced. The computation processes which are performed
    at the nodes have given a feel as if it is performed at the data source itself.
    Edge computing can also be stated as an extension of older technologies. The extended
    features available in the edge computing are peer-to-peer networking, distributed
    data, self-healing network technology, and remote cloud services. Improved hardware
    security and also lowering the power requirement are satisfying factors that are
    provided by the processors of edge computing systems. This edge computing system
    also provides a highly optimal solution as the hardware is embedded with the flash-storage
    arrays. The concept of interaction of the centralized system with embedded systems
    and industrial gateways is used in fog computing. Much of the data processing
    of edge computing is performed directly at the embedded computing platforms by
    making an interface with the sensors and controllers. Optimizing resource usage
    in a cloud-computing system is one of the advantages provided in edge computing
    besides more advantages like reducing network traffic and improved security. The
    following subsections explicate the IoT applications along with the concept of
    cloud computing. 5.2 IoT Applications Table 5.1 gives a short description of the
    IoT applications which will be discussed in detail. Table 5.1 Short description
    of IoT applications Full size table 5.2.1 Infrastructure Management IoT infrastructure
    consists of three major parts such as sensing infrastructure, computing infrastructure,
    and storage infrastructure. Sensing infrastructure includes communicating and
    sensing devices. Computing infrastructure is needed for computing the power consumption
    and to effectively manage the dynamic loads from various sensors. Depending upon
    the user need, this infrastructure has to be modeled. Traditional storage infrastructure
    has to be replaced with updated storage infrastructure in order to satisfy the
    users, as there is a drastic increase in the need of sensor. Infrastructure management
    is needed to monitor and control the devices in rural and urban area infrastructures.
    This infrastructure includes various applications such as bridges, railways, farms,
    etc. The infrastructure is controlled by monitoring the change in state of the
    application devices. If the device is compromised whenever there is a change in
    the state of an event, and if unnoticed will result in high risk. Infrastructure
    management helps in taking quick decisions and also in saving money with real-time
    analytics. It can also be used to schedule an event like repair and maintenance
    activities in industry, which will be performed by coordinating the task between
    the service providers and the users. With these facilities, IoT helps in improving
    quality of service, timely event handling process, coordinating the responses,
    and also reducing the cost. Many fields like manufacturing, agriculture, energy
    management, environmental monitoring, building and home automation, metropolitan
    scale deployments, etc, are benefitted with this infrastructure management. 5.2.2
    Industrial IoT (IIoT) IIoT describes the usage of Internet of Things across several
    industrial activities like manufacturing, logistics, metals, and mining and in
    other sectors. Internet of Things is a transformative manufacturing technology
    which improves safety, quality, and productivity in industries [3]. The main aim
    of the Industrial Internet of Things is to have a high output at the rate of same
    input and to achieve same output in the cost of low input. All goods and products
    in the industry are labeled with near field communication (NFC) tags and radio-frequency
    identification (RFID) tags which helps to monitor the goods available in the industry
    and helps to order goods if it is insufficient. It also helps to reduce time in
    searching the specific products in the industry and also reduces labor cost. The
    primary advantages of the Industrial Internet of Things are as follows: Predictive
    maintenance Real-time monitoring Scalability and time saving Resource optimization
    The study, The Impact of Connectedness on Competitiveness, is based on a global
    survey of 350 executives from large enterprises. It found that more than half
    (52%) of executives at large enterprises expect IIoT to have a “significant” or
    “major” impact on their industry within 3 years, with another third (32%) forecasting
    a “moderate” impact in that timeframe. Security is the major factor for all industries
    and everyone is in need to know that their data is well secured. Security vulnerabilities
    are highly prevented by using sensors, smart connected devices, and by other methods.
    5.2.3 Smart Retail IoT brings a number of applications for retailers for improving
    store operations, minimizing theft occurrences; increasing customer purchase by
    selling more number of the products to them, and also producing a new inventory
    product [7]. It will make the customer know everything in the store and aid them
    closer to the buying decision. RFID tags are attached to every product in the
    store, and its availability is checked periodically. Customers gain the information
    about the goods through Bluetooth beacons or other digital receivers. The digital
    signature will navigate the customer to the product. The following actions can
    be performed for improvising the quality of purchase and make the customer think
    and take an easy decision in buying a product. From the analytics, the retailer
    will know about customer’s perspectives which will later help in improvising their
    product according to the customer’s interest. Interactive digital signature screens
    Mobile shopping applications Sensor-based items tracking Tailored digital marketing
    Optimized inventory management Mobile payment solutions IoT-enabled beacons Customer
    preferences analytics For security purposes in the retail shops, multiple video
    cameras are positioned within the shop premises at present. Using these cameras,
    images are captured and are streamed to the cloud for storage and also for further
    analysis, if required. These are implemented for security reasons or can also
    be used to monitor the customer behavior within the store. As an extension, it
    helps the proprietor of the store to keep an eye on the happenings of the store
    including the cash flow. For implementing a secured store, the store is in need
    of at least one gateway to connect various equipment with the sensors and also
    to collect the image data and store it in the cloud platform. Many companies are
    working on this issue to give better security to the retail store. 5.2.4 Smart
    Supply Chain IoT supports supply chain management by performing operational efficiencies
    and revenue opportunities. The supply chain transparency captures the extent to
    which information about the companies, suppliers, and sourcing locations are readily
    available to end-users and also to other companies in the supply chain. Security
    is the most important aspect that has to be considered. All the information must
    be prevented from falling into the wrong hands or being hacked. Sensors should
    only send specific information, which must be held in a secure private cloud environment.
    Product Tracking RFID and GPS sensors track product from the manufacturing place
    to the storage location. They will monitor the product, and hence the manufacturer
    can gain granular data like the temperature at which an item is stored and so
    on. These data will help in improvising the quality control, on-time deliveries,
    and product forecasting. Vendor Relations Data obtained from product tracking
    are also helpful to companies for updating their own production schedules and
    also recognize the vendor relationships that may be costing them money. These
    will test how vendors are handling supplies and sending goods to the manufacturer.
    High-quality goods define a better relationship with customers, and the better
    customer is retained. Forecasting and Inventory Another major parameter which
    is difficult to manage in the supply chain management is inventory. Smart devices
    are closely monitored, and they deal with more variable than earlier applications.
    Equipment monitoring provides information about predictive maintenance and alerting
    engineers for potential breakdowns and costly disruption. Consider Amazon Go as
    an example that uses IoT, computer vision, machine learning, and AI to create
    a shopping experience where the user can just walk in, pick up whatever the user
    needs, and can walk out with a purchase. In [15], the authors have proposed a
    cloud-centric IoT architecture for supply chain management (SCM). In traditional
    SCM, the movement of physical objects was performed directly, whereas, in this
    paper, the authors have controlled and coordinated the supply chain process based
    on object sensing. For implementing this framework, they have used proposed layers
    in their framework, namely, object management, cloud computing platform, information
    as a service, and smartphone user. Thirty-one percent of manufacturers are implementing
    Internet of Things enhancements to their internal operations, with another 56%
    exploring doing so in order to cut operational costs, achieve supply chain efficiencies,
    and improve predictive maintenance capabilities. Operations performed with these
    layers include submission of request by the user to the cloud; the cloud computing
    platform will make response to the user by identifying the location; this cloud
    computing platform helps the user to update the data in the database and hence
    the user can publish the sensed information; with the received information, the
    cloud will perform operation and will return the user about the task which is
    mapped according to the physical location of the user; and finally all the transactions
    and the conversations are stored to the cloud for future references. 5.2.5 Transportation
    and Logistics IoT improves the transportation industry by improving economic development,
    public safety, and the environment. IoT monitors the goods and analyses the data
    with the help of sensors. Location of the vehicle can be predicted by GPS, roadside
    sensors, etc., and finally, the products will be delivered on time, at the right
    place. The real-time traffic monitoring is explained in [10]. Some special delivering
    vehicles are available to deliver sensitive products, to be stored in a cool place.
    Environmental sensors can monitor temperature, humidity, light, and vibration
    in real time. These sensors have the capability to detect the occurrence of any
    problem, and they are alarmed so that corrective measures can be taken to prevent
    spoiling of goods. The data that are collected from different sensors are massive
    in size to be stored in the cloud. Safety and security is the main reason for
    the development of the transportation industry with IoT. Thus, there is no loss
    of goods, and hence they are transported to the destined place without any damage.
    By maximizing the profitability and viability, the efficiency of the supply chain
    is improved in transportation and logistics field. With the improved development
    in the fields of mobile technology and IoT, the enterprises are connecting the
    transportation- and logistics-related devices with the centralized cloud network
    to gain information about the real-time operations in transportation and logistics
    by capturing and sharing the information about the critical data. The information
    about the critical data is shared in to make sure that the right product is delivered
    to the right place at the right time. This paves way for the development in various
    fields such as asset management, cloud, mobile, and big data. 5.2.6 Connected
    Cars Internet of Things paves a great and fresh way for the car manufacturers
    to upgrade their cars in a highly competitive market. As stated in [2] by Kevin
    Ashton, this also enhances the idea, where a person can drive around the world
    and can stay connected all the time. Before the invention of IoT in automobiles,
    one has to search for the route manually, while the IoT has made it more convenient.
    For example, a person could set the destination place using Ground Positioning
    Systems (GPS), and the driver will be directed to the destination place and this
    also needs some improvements. Auto-pilot mode is the most modern technology introduced
    in recent times. High-resolution cameras can be used to detect soft and hard objects
    in the lane and also in the vehicle surroundings. Forward-facing radar with enhanced
    processing collects additional data about the world on a redundant wavelength
    that helps the user to see through heavy rain, fog, dust, and even the car behind
    and ahead. This could also aid in detecting the traffic signals and signs that
    are already inbuilt in the system and could drive the car as safe as possible.
    It can also adapt to the changes in the environmental roads around the world,
    and it could also offer lane change automatically. IHS Markit predicts that more
    than 70 million connected cars will be on the road by 2023. Designing a connected
    vehicle platform on cloud IoT core will be a better solution for managing the
    connected cars by making a use of cloud IoT core on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
    The use cases that can be defined by making a combination with data storage and
    platforms are usage-based insurance, predictive maintenance, freight tracking,
    and customized in-vehicle experience. The main challenges that a development team
    will face in this domain are device management, data ingestion, data analytics,
    applications, and predictive models. Besides these challenges, the developer must
    also focus on security and set the boundary level for the applications they design
    that are implemented in the cloud-based system. 5.2.7 Self-Parking Vehicles Self-driving
    cars are learned from the data cloud, the collections of data are brakes, tire
    and transmission performance, fuel consumption, and efficiency of the vehicle.
    The main reason for self-driving is high safety, and it will abide all traffic
    rules and regulation as shown in [5]. Averagely, parking coverage takes 31% of
    land use in big cities, like San Francisco, and even more, 81% in Los Angeles
    and 76% in Melbourne, while at the lower end we find New York (18%), London (16%),
    and Tokyo (7%). Hence, the removal of unnecessary parking areas is the first task
    for municipalities to create a better urban planning. The data are provided with
    high security, and the hackers cannot access the data easily without the user’s
    authorization. There exists confusion when the user tries parking his or her vehicle,
    and it leads to great pressure and stress to the user which also results in waste
    of time. As self-driving vehicle is automatically parked in the parking area without
    any confusion it reduces pressure as well as the time for user. IoT predicts the
    current scenario and performs the action according to the problem. In [16], the
    authors have designed a smart parking system. In this system, the authors have
    specified that the system can be implemented for any type of parking like parking
    available at covered parks, open parks, and also street side parking. For this
    system, the authors have designed an architecture which includes cloud service
    provider. The main function of this cloud service provider is to collect information
    about the parking area and store the information in the cloud. The major components
    of this smart parking system are centralized server, Raspberry Pi, image capturing
    device, a navigation system, displaying device, and the user device. The centralized
    server acts as a database that will hold the entire information about the parking
    system, some of the information includes a number of parking slots, availability
    of vehicles, and so on. Raspberry Pi is a microcontroller used to implement the
    parking system with a camera attached to it. This Pi-camera is used to capture
    pictures of the parking area for validating the area to check the availability
    of slots in that area. The main role of the navigation system is to navigate the
    users to the available parking lot which is nearer to his or her current location.
    Displaying device is a monitor or tab available at the admin’s location to monitor
    the device and to modify the parking lot if needed. The user device is used to
    connect the user with the parking system using their smartphones or browsers.
    5.2.8 Smoke Detectors Safety of life is more important when compared to any other
    application. Records show that many lives were exploited by fire accidents, and
    also it takes a longer duration for the fire service to reach the destination.
    To avoid these types of accidents, many companies are using IoT devices for safety.
    It is safe in many ways as it is more evident that if fire accident occurs, it
    automatically connects itself to the hot-connect or cloud environment and it directly
    sends a voice or text message to the concerned fire agency. The working principle
    is not like the normal smoke detectors which could only give beeping alarm sounds
    but it also helps to save people. This has battery power that is estimated to
    last up to 10 years and also it is not a big bottleneck to change the battery.
    It is more rapidly replacing the normal smoke detectors as this proves to be more
    useful and also available at an affordable cost. One thousand smoke detector surveys
    were mailed, covering about 70 percent of the town’s households. While the results
    staggered in over a period of 3 months, 315 completed surveys (31.5 percent) were
    ultimately returned. The high return rate can be interpreted as a strong interest
    on the part of the public concerning fire safety. In the industrial sector, the
    smoke detectors play a different role, where it is used as the contamination detector.
    The detector is placed at the chimney and monitors the smoke that is being passed
    out through it. If the contaminants are greater than the recommended level, it
    will send a warning message to the main supervisor and also to the concerned person
    so that it will never be ignored. It ensures green living to all the people and
    greatly reduces pollution. 5.2.9 Smart Cities As described by Gauer, A., Smart
    City Architecture and its applications based on IoT in [4], smart cities improve
    the quality of lifestyle by improving infrastructures like delivering clean water,
    dependable power, and efficient public lighting. The main motive of a smart city
    is to provide more efficient water supply, an innovative solution to traffic congestion,
    and more reliable public transportation. Water can be highly saved by providing
    the following facilities. Leakage detection in pipes Wastewater recycling Managing
    the storm-water The benefits of the smart city include increased safety, reduced
    traffic, lower levels of pollution, more efficient use of energy, and improve
    the overall quality of life for future city dwellers. The main aim of the smart
    cities is extended to keep the citizens safe, and it should provide education
    and technological job opportunities to the citizens with open innovation. Gujarat
    International Finance Tec-City stands as a great example for smart cities. It
    has better city planning and development, and internet facility is provided all
    over the city with a faster supply of products at a lower operating expense. The
    major issue stands in the contamination of air, and to resolve this issue many
    green buildings are set up. The companies which focus on security management can
    be connected with smoke detectors so that they can protect the buildings from
    fire. The device will send the message to the cloud-based dashboard only if the
    fire is detected or if the system is in need of maintenance. This will greatly
    reduce the man-hours in performing the maintenance check frequently, and even
    the process may not be needed. These connected smoke detectors are more advantageous
    when compared to the traditional system. These smoke detectors can be connected
    to devices such as desktops, laptops, tablets or smart-phones to get alert messages
    which proves helpful for fire security personnel. 5.2.10 Construction The main
    problem faced by a worker in a construction industry is misplacing the equipment
    at the construction sites which leads to time consumption in searching the equipment
    or may cause any damage to the equipment. IoT keeps on monitoring the equipment
    by sensors by GPS tracking attached to the equipment. RIFD tags will be attached
    to the devices so that tracking can be made easy. The cost of the equipment is
    comparably higher than earlier devices. This will help the consumer to buy the
    equipment only once in a lifetime, instead of purchasing frequently whenever it
    is missed. Repair and service of the equipment can be monitored, and the problem
    could be resolved with a warning alert from the equipment. Energy consumption
    by the equipment can be minimized by the sensors which will adjust the actions
    to be performed by the tools automatically. The sensors will automatically switch
    on/off to save energy. The main advantage is the quality work is increased and
    more convenient for users. The construction project work can be done on time,
    and the quality of the construction can be improved. The future Internet of Things
    will provide intelligent building management systems which can be considered as
    a part of a much larger information system used by facilities managers in buildings
    to manage energy use and energy procurement and to maintain efficient building
    management systems. 5.2.11 Smart Homes Google is highly potential and develops
    automation in everything. As everything in the home is well organized and fully
    computerized, they are all controlled simply with a mobile application which leads
    to controlling and monitoring the devices that are installed in the home [17].
    The devices that are using electricity can be added to the network. Smart homes
    also provide high security which prevents hackers from penetration. Several companies
    have developed smart appliances which include smart fridges, televisions, and
    air conditioners. For example, Nest is an automated thermostat which senses the
    temperature and adjusts the air conditioner to the favorable means, i.e., if the
    external temperature is high, it lowers the internal temperature and vice versa
    which makes the people comfortable. In [12], the authors describe the privacy
    and security challenges in smart homes. In [18], the authors have designed a smart
    home in such a way that the device will record the daily activities inside the
    home and store the information in the cloud storage. The device will get familiar
    with this information, and hence at a later stage, the device will do the similar
    operations without the requirement of human intervention. 5.2.12 Smart Panels
    A smart panel can perform multiple functions like tracking the electrical usage
    and wastage in a detailed manner, and it also displays the result on the computer
    screen. They are simple, flexible, and have an open architecture which proves
    that they are simple in construction and implementation. Using these applications,
    the user can remotely access the electrical units which are installed far away
    which help in reducing the electrical energy. Another type is smart solar panels,
    and these have multiple abilities which could perform different actions depending
    on the conditions required. For example, this panel can be used to convert solar
    energy into electrical energy or to the required form of energy in which it acts
    as a transducer in one form and it could convert air into drinking water from
    the sunlight and air in another form. All the installed panels are monitored by
    the organization. The purity and taste of the water are obtained by adding the
    required minerals to it. It is connected and so it provides optimized performance.
    It could provide an average of 8–20 bottles of water per day. The main advantage
    of using these panels is they need not be hooked up to the home’s electrical systems,
    and they use full renewable resources to gain energy. 5.2.13 Energy Management
    Energy is a very important aspect for any household, industries, agriculture,
    and so on. Managing energy source and conserving it for better performance is
    a challenging task. IoT paradigm promises to increase the visibility and awareness
    of energy consumption, thanks to smart sensors and smart meters at the machine
    and production line level. Since every appliance depends on energy supply, energy
    plays a vital role in day-to-day life. An interface like Arduino Microcontrollers
    controls the usage of an appliance like the intensity of light and the speed of
    the fan. Humidity, temperature, and light intensity are taken into consideration
    in developing a better IoT system for energy management. IoT devices are controlled
    and connected for small cities and communities, transportation systems, buildings,
    lighting systems, factories, and more devices. Building Energy Management Systems
    (BEMs) attracted $1.4 B in VC Funding from 2000 to 2014 (26% of all investment
    in building energy technology). In 2020, about 77% of the $2.14 billion US market
    will comprise BEMS applications, and 40% will come from buildings below 50,000
    square feet. The US market for sensors and controls for BEMs will rise at a 17%
    compound annual growth rate to $2.14 billion in 2020. Possible future directions
    for energy management are as follows: Energy-efficient mechanisms for software-defined
    IoT solutions, which can provide scalable and context-aware data and services.
    Fog computing can lead to energy saving for most of the IoT applications; therefore,
    it is important to study energy consumption of fog devices for IoT applications.
    5.2.14 Smart Wearables Wearable devices are considered as the hot topic these
    days. A reduced job is much preferred in every field which resulted in this technology.
    Some of the important functions to be considered for a smart wearable in the industrial
    location is it could sense cut-off radiation level and will alert the user when
    the environment becomes worse. Health- and fitness-related devices are also available
    these days which could monitor the heartbeat rate, blood pressure, footsteps count,
    sleep monitor, etc. Some of the useful features are it could find the body temperature
    by which the user could get an early indication of cold or flu. Most of the users
    have a question why to use a wearable gadget while a single smartphone could do
    all these work. It is not comfortable to take our smartphone for every transaction,
    but the smartphone will act as the central unit of the wearable by connecting
    it through Bluetooth or the network which grants access for the wearable to surf
    the data available in the smartphone. Further, wearable reduces manual work to
    a great extent where the devices in the home are being connected and the user
    can control any of the devices which are connected in the same network without
    requiring any movement from place to place. 5.2.15 Environmental Monitoring The
    main application of IoT in the environmental monitoring is weather forecasting
    and monitoring, protecting endangered species, water safety, and many more applications.
    Current weather forecasting and monitoring applications include the need for the
    labor work, but implementing IoT in this field greatly reduces this effort. Sampling
    is done at regular intervals, and it helps to prevent contamination of air in
    many stages. IoT allows deep monitoring of weather in a specific range of area
    using IoT installed with radar. This promises more fine-grained data with great
    accuracy and range. This helps in early detection and early warning which reduces
    the loss of life and property [11]. Low-power, wide-area network (LPWAN) technology
    is perfectly suited for environmental monitoring, as it can connect devices that
    need to stay in the field for an extended period of time and send small amounts
    of data over a long range. There are a number of reasons you may want to select
    LPWAN technology for your IoT environmental monitoring: Long battery life Low
    cost Long range Satellite backhaul ability 5.2.16 Biological Sensors Biosensors
    are gaining more interest nowadays, and they promise to be one of the constant
    growing fields in IoT [9]. Biosensors are mainly used in the field of healthcare,
    applications related to sports, and mostly in the military. The main advantage
    of this application is low cost and also provides real-time information. The term
    “wearable biosensors” (WBS) is evolved by combining both the smart wearable and
    the biosensors in a single unit. The required sensors are installed in the various
    parts of the body so they could be monitored all the time, without any whatsoever
    disturbances. Their size will be very small which makes them easy to carry wherever
    the user moves. Based on the usage of such sensors, these devices are popularly
    named as immunosensors, glucometers, biocomputers, etc., some of the examples
    include (1) Google lens (2) ring sensor and (3) smart shirt. 5.2.17 Healthcare
    Systems According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 31 percent of global
    deaths are due to cardiovascular diseases (estimated 17.7 million people in 2015).
    The number of people with diabetes has been rapidly increasing from 108 million
    in 1980 to 422 million in 2014. The rising cost of healthcare services has increased
    the need for providing effective and efficient healthcare to the patients in most
    of the developing countries. Internet of Things stands as the key component for
    the digital transformation of healthcare systems. Internet of Healthcare Things
    (IoHT) and Internet of Medical Things are considered to be the two most important
    parts of healthcare systems which include smart pills, smart personal healthcare,
    and real-time health systems. This is mainly designed for those who do not find
    time to spend on their health life, whereas here they could easily check their
    health issues with easy IoT healthcare systems. This is not only suitable for
    an individual but easy for everyone to register with their health issues and get
    appropriate remedy, and also this initiative will reduce spending money for a
    periodical check-up. IoT-based healthcare for the elderly is the cheapest and
    more efficient way for applications related to healthcare. ECG, heartbeat rate,
    and body moisture can easily be found using this application. Appointment of the
    doctors can be made and it will also help in periodical indication for the pills
    at right time. Healthcare IoT systems ensure some basic ideas that can now be
    used to monitor the patient remotely, but in future, it will surely be an important
    member in the healthcare industry to maintain the healthcare and its related activities.
    The health records of the users are collected and are stored in electronic healthcare
    records (EHR) which makes the past data as well as the present data to be readily
    available at any time. While considering the security of the personal health records,
    IoT considers this as sensitive data and has some stricter rules that should be
    followed. Genetic materials and other personal details are stored in a private
    environment. In [13], the authors have proposed a device named Cellcon. This device
    is developed based on the image analysis concept which is portable and also affordable
    to do the process. This is a hardware device with a ball lens and a mobile application.
    The authors designed this application to do the cell count and to identify the
    presence of the malarial parasite. The blood sample is collected in a slide and
    a photo is taken by a ball lens that is attached to the phone clip, and hence
    a magnified image of the blood sample is obtained. This IoT device uses cloud
    storage for storing the image data, retrieve the data, and perform the analysis
    through and from the internet. The image is compared with the images in the database
    and the results are sent to the patient. In this application, the first half of
    the application, i.e., collecting the blood sample and taking a photo, is performed
    at the patient’s location. The patient may reside at any remote location, and
    the image data will be passed via the internet. The doctor will analyze the image
    data using the application which is installed in his mobile, and this belongs
    to the second phase of the application. 5.2.18 Precision Agriculture Precision
    agriculture makes rapid changes in the agricultural sector, and numerous organizations
    are leveraging this technique around the world. IoT makes agriculture field highly
    efficient. CropMetrics is a precision agricultural organization concentrated on
    ultra-modern agronomic solutions. Wireless sensor network (WSN) and wireless moisture
    sensor network (WMSN) are used in IoT. WSN technology contains many sensors, which
    are used to monitor and control to do proper irrigation. This optimization will
    maximize the profitability of irrigated crop fields, improves yields, and increases
    water usage efficiently. Agricultural drones are applied to farming in order to
    help increase crop production and monitor crop growth. Through the use of advanced
    sensors and digital imaging capabilities, farmers are able to use these drones
    to help them gather a richer picture of their fields. An advantage of drones is
    crop health, convenient to use, and increase in yield production. IoT reduces
    the human intervention in farming. Today’s sophisticated commercial farms have
    exploited advanced technologies; however, IoT introduces more access to deeper
    automation and analysis. In [14], the authors have projected the problems faced
    by the farmers in the real world. The farmers will be holding the agricultural
    land which is measured in hectares, and it is highly difficult for the farmers
    to identify the infected crop that is spread out in a vast area. Besides these
    criteria, the farmers also face certain other issues like rainfall prediction,
    climate, availability of water, and so on. Also, the farmers are not ready to
    cultivate different or hybrid crops in their land, as they lack knowledge and
    less experience in this scenario. In order to support the farmers in these conditions,
    a sensor device can be placed in the soil that is used for monitoring the climatic
    changes, temperature, and even soil moisture. The data observed by the sensors
    are stored with the help of cloud storage; this stored information will be used
    in future for analyzing and predicting the soil status and also about the feasible
    crop which can be cultivated with the existing soil and weather conditions. This
    concept of implementing cloud will aid in the expansion of data storage, and this
    will greatly reduce the production cost. 5.2.19 Poultry and Farming IOT is an
    innovative technology that provides modern and automated poultry farming. Basic
    environment parameters for poultry farming are temperature, humidity, ammonia
    gas, and water level. For instance, the temperature is controlled by cooling fan,
    humidity is monitored by the exhaust fan, ammonia gas is examined by ventilation
    window open, and the water level is maintained by DC motor. These actions are
    performed by the sensor, and monitoring is done the whole day. These are done
    mainly for the growth and health of the chicken. Farming challenges caused by
    population growth and climate change have made it one of the first industries
    to utilize the IoT in this sector. 5.2.20 Smart Surveillance The major issue in
    the secured environment is to safeguard our buildings, assets, and so on [8].
    The basic alarm facilities of earlier days had high visibility and later on introduced
    a monitoring camera which has some less scope of treatment. Internet of Things
    helps to create smart homes and smart cities by adding a feature of real-time
    monitoring services to the environment which concerns more about the security
    by the use of smart surveillance and security [6]. To make it simpler, let us
    consider that the user uses network cameras to monitor the area under surveillance
    and high-resolution cameras for the places of large crowd movement. IoT will offer
    a greater solution to such disparate things by considering the above scenarios
    by combining the video surveillance cameras and smoke detectors into a “small
    and single glass pane.” As all the devices will be monitored over a network, they
    could share data among them and could take decisions by themselves by which the
    security will be enhanced. The images produced by the video surveillance cameras
    should have high clarity, and this would be true by adopting Internet of Things.
    Nowadays, megapixel technology has grown to its peak by incorporating them with
    low-lighting cameras which are now blooming successor of the present market. These
    are all concerned with the wide dynamic range (WDR) of cameras. IoT offers a resolution
    of at least three times greater, and even 4 k videos could be generated using
    IoT. 5.3 Conclusion There are many benefits that arise with the increased use
    of Internet of Things. IoT is used in our everyday life as it greatly reduces
    the cost and power. Hence, this chapter has given an overview of applications
    using IoT. IoT has the potential to drive integrated solutions that can make a
    difference. The entire world is transforming slowly with the use of IoT in daily
    life. Also, the people are getting ample opportunities to enhance their commitments
    and perform various activities using smart things. This chapter has given a short
    description of various applications that are implemented with IoT and also certain
    challenges faced in those applications. Research work can be extended in the challenges
    faced and giving increased security to the applications to provide the better,
    smart and secured environment. References L. Da Xu, W. He, S. Li, Internet of

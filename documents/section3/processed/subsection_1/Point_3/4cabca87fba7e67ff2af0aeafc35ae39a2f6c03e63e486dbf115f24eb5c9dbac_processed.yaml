    ((LNNS,volume 69)) Abstract The wireless smart sensors networks (WSSNs) is expected
    to play significant role in Internet of Things (IoT) and wireless based application
    service delivery such as: in healthcare, in environment monitoring, in intelligent
    agriculture, … . Therefore, cognitive radio is promising in handling spectrum
    efficiently, however the Cognitive Radio approach for WSSNs is not efficient in
    utilizing spectrum because they also suffer from interference which induced collision.
    In this paper, we present a dynamic spectrum access for WSSNs based on the channel
    availability of likelihood distribution using continuous-time Markov chain considering
    primary transmitting users, temporal channel usage, channel pattern and spatial
    distribution. On the other hand, as the 5G promising technique, Multiple Inputs-Multiple
    Outputs Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (MIMO-OFDMA) based Cognitive
    Radio schemes are proposed to significantly improve the system capacity while
    mitigate the interference for dynamic spectrum access networks. The energy efficient
    spectrum sensing employing a dedicated smart sensors and virtualized-operated
    networks for spectrum sensing is given focus in this paper. The experiment outcome
    shows that the proposed approach improves overall spectrum efficiency of Cognitive
    Radio wireless smart sensors networks. On the subject of the power-allocation
    policies for the MIMO-OFDMA based Cognitive Radio network, a set of simulations
    show that our proposed scheme outperforms the other existing schemes in terms
    of effective capacity to efficiently implement the heterogeneous statistical QoS
    over MIMO-OFDMA based Cognitive Radio network. The improvement virtualized-operated
    network life time and energy efficiency is shown through simulations. Keywords

    of technology in the fields of computer science and electronics has allowed the
    emergence of wireless sensors networks (WSNs), which are considered a special
    type of ad hoc networks whose nodes are sensors to low cost, low power and easy
    to deploy. They are able to collect and transmit data in multiple applications
    in an autonomous way. Recall that in recent years, many wireless sensors networks
    have been deployed in different applications to explore the requirements, constraints
    and guidelines for the overall design of the sensors network architecture. A static
    sensor is a device sensitive to the physical quantity to be measured which transforms
    the state of a physical quantity observed into a usable quantity, for example
    an electrical voltage, a height of mercury, an intensity, the deflection of a
    needle. The use of WSN in precision farming makes it possible to make the right
    decision for each area on the farm [1]. The advantages of the traditional WSN
    network is the absence of cabling, which greatly reduces the cost of installation,
    the other advantage is deployment flexibility and ease of maintenance. Indeed,
    the sensors are autonomous and require very little human intervention on the fields
    especially in the case where the communication protocols are fault-tolerant and
    support the mobility of the nodes. Nodes can measure different parameters such
    as air and soil parameters. In order for this network to become functional and
    complete at the architecture level, we must present the radio part which makes
    it possible to transfer, transmit and change information from one source to another.
    This network equipped with Cognitive Radio is called CWSN. In the CWSN which is
    a specialized ad hoc network, in which the nodes present wireless sensors administered
    by a SINK node, the wireless sensor is an instrument for measuring the physical
    quantities in a well-defined field, its function is to collect and to transmit
    the data to a base station. Sensors are the basic elements of data acquisition
    systems [1]. Their implementation is in the field of instrumentation. This network,
    in addition to the advantages presented above, recommends many limitations and
    disadvantages which does not meet the expectations and needs of users since the
    features of a static wireless sensor are limited; moreover, the static wireless
    sensor is not able to make decisions and send orders to actuators. Faced with
    the huge problems encountered in using the classic WSN (wireless sensors network)
    and to solve and overcome its problems, we introduced the notion of a virtualized-operated
    system. Remember that the aspect of virtualization is a solution used in the computer
    world to share resources (execution, storage) between multiple applications, while
    ensuring the tightness between applications. Network Functions of Virtualization
    (NFV) is a key element in optimizing the use of network resources by “virtualizing”
    functions usually implemented in proprietary hardware, thus reducing the costs
    of investment and operation for operators. Virtualized-operated networks are more
    agile, more scalable, more innovative and above all more adapted to the imperative
    of operation. In another way, network virtualization consists of virtualizing
    on application resource pools namely: computation, storage, network-DHCP-DNS service,
    software firewall and load balancing. In this work, we will have modeled a specific
    intelligent sensors network system based on virtualized-operated networks while
    applying the MIMO-OFDMA technique and Cognitive Radio. The goal to be reached
    by the proposed CWSSN is to answer and to solve the CWSN problems, we have proposed
    another type of network occupied by intelligent sensors nodes that are equipped
    with a promising Cognitive Radio in the effective management of spectrum called
    cognitive wireless smart sensors network (CWSSNs) based on Cognitive Radio network,
    virtualized-operated networks, smart sensors and MIMO-OFDMA technology. It is
    a whole specific dedicated system for different applications, we propose in this
    research to apply our new specific network in the field of agriculture to solve
    such irrigation problems and for a comfortable agriculture, modernized, automated
    and intelligent in order to have a very good product quality. To ensure the proper
    functioning of this network and to ensure security against any attacks and intrusions,
    we introduced the concept of Software-Defined Wireless Sensors Cognitive Radio
    Networks (SD-WSCRNs). This intelligent sensors network consists of intelligent
    sensors nodes and a base station on which all detected data are transmitted. This
    network can be reconfigured remotely after the deployment and when its database
    is saturated-empty and populated. This network is agile and adapts to topological
    changes. It is also programmable, which facilitates network management [2]. To
    meet the challenges of the spectrum, smart sensors nodes are equipped with a promising
    Cognitive Radio in effective spectrum management since Cognitive Radio (CR) is
    one of the technologies capable of enabling intelligent sensors nodes (as secondary
    users) to detect and temporarily use the licensed underutilized spectrum when
    primary users (PUs) do not use it [3]. But, the existing problems in the CWSN
    are solved like as: the bandwidth problem, the problem of the response time, the
    resolution problem and several other limits. In addition, there are also several
    problems of: auto-configuration, self-monitoring, learning, decision-making and
    control actuators. Conventional wireless sensors networks are used in several
    fields of application [1]. Among these is the field of agriculture, where this
    network has not met the expectations and needs of farmers since it requires a
    large number of forestry workers who perform manual work recommending errors likely
    as: firstly, in the delivered water quantity; secondly, at the time of the release/shutdown.
    For this, we have proposed our CWSSN network which can provide an important support
    facilitating agricultural practices allowing then the use of intelligent agriculture.
    This paper is organized into sections as follows; Sect. 2 defines the model of
    the proposed system, Sect. 3 describes the theoretical analysis of the network
    of metrics, the application and simulations are presented in Sect. 4 and finally,
    Sect. 5 concludes the article and the proposed prospects. 2 Cognitive Wireless
    Smart Sensors Network System Model Based on MIMO-OFDMA To overcome the limitations
    of the classic CWSN network equipped with a Cognitive Radio and their problems
    mentioned in the previous chapter; For this, we proposed a specific wireless sensors
    network model consisting of smart sensors called Cognitive Wireless Smart Sensors
    Network (CWSSN). This type of network represents a new generation of the embedded
    system running in real time with significant communication constraints different
    from the traditional network. The key element of the CWSSN is the intelligent
    sensor which is an embedded system with several intelligent features such as self-diagnosis,
    self-calibration, remote reconfiguration, ease of maintenance, real-time data
    storage on malfunction and possibly the diagnosis of defects. Thanks to the complementarity
    of its functionalities, we can say that the intelligent sensor is a microsystem
    intelligently managing the operation of an application. Also, we can integrate
    several other features namely: Advanced communication interpreting a two-way digital
    dialogue with other related microsystem or smart sensor. The generation of virtual
    quantities (magnitudes that are not directly measurable but developed from the
    available physical quantities and calculation models). The realization of an automatic
    passage in a fallback position during a certain malfunction. The presentation
    of the possibilities of self-adaptation, that is to say automatic choice of the
    scale best suited to the quantities to be measured. In this study, we replaced
    the static wireless sensor with a smart sensor. Smart sensor technology can detect
    and connect objects in different applications, particularly intelligent agriculture.
    The proposed network is an interconnected wireless network; it has grown massively
    because of the vast potential of wireless smart sensors to connect the physical
    globe to the virtual globe. So, it’s a multi-hop network. CWSSN nodes are located
    in a monitoring field in a distributed manner. This CR-equipped network can help
    overcome bandwidth limitation while detecting ghost holes and using MIMO-OFDMA
    technology to improve spectrum sensing utilization on the one hand and minimize
    interference on the other. Due to the characteristics and limitations of smart
    sensors nodes, the coupling of cognitive technology into smart sensors nodes introduces
    other challenges such as spectrum detection, spectrum sharing and spectrum management
    [4]. As the use of Cognitive Radio increases day by day, the problems associated
    with spectrum detection are also increasing. These communication problems in our
    CWSSN network have been solved through Cognitive Radio technology. The cognitive
    technique is the process of knowledge through perception, planning, reasoning,
    updating action and continuous updating with a learning history; this allows us
    to appear a network of distributed smart sensors. The CR offers some advantages
    such as: the efficient use of the spectrum as well as spacing for new technologies,
    the use of several channels, the energy efficiency, the use of the spectral band
    specific to each application and the reduction of attacks. One of the primary
    goals of integrating a CR into wireless smart sensors is to use the unused licensed
    spectrum opportunistically. The overarching problem facing the CWSSN is the implementation
    of an effective spectrum access mechanism to respond to existing challenges. In
    this work, we propose and present a mechanism of access to the spectrum of the
    opportunistic primary user by using a continuous time Markov chain. So, consider
    a network of intelligent wireless cognitive radio smart sensors, which consists
    of a set of primary users such as the base station (sink) and unauthorized secondary
    users (smart sensors devices). An intelligent sensing device is equipped with
    a Cognitive Radio for opportunistic access of licensed spectrum [4, 5]. Let us
    consider the set U of the nonempty opportunistic channel accessible to intelligent
    sensors. There is limited channel availability for an intelligent sensor device
    due to the nature of the main user characteristics and the positions/locations
    of the smart sensors devices. The characteristic of the opportunity of the spectrum
    depends on the availability of the channel for an intelligent sensor device which
    is defined as the time during which the channel is available for intelligent detection
    devices or not [4]. Recall to the Cognitive Radio technology is an emerging technology
    in order to solve the spectrum scarcity problem in wireless smart sensors communication
    networks and especially in the virtualized-operated communication networks. Spectrum
    sensing which enables dynamic spectrum is found to be one of the most complex
    and power intensive tasks in a Cognitive Radio. The smart sensors nodes within
    the communication range of each Cognitive Radio forms clusters around the Cognitive
    Radio to sense the spectrum. These clusters (see Fig. 1.) are again divided into
    disjoint subsets to further improve energy efficiency. Only one subset is made
    active at a time to sense the spectrum. The benefits and application of a dedicated
    smart sensors and virtualized-operated networks for Cognitive Radio spectrum sensing
    was developed and discussed in [4]. A promising approach for energy efficient
    spectrum sensing via a separate dedicated smart sensors and virtualized-operated
    networks. Spectrum sensing via smart sensors and virtualized-operated networks
    benefits in providing better primary user and effectively detecting a possible
    weak primary user signal [4, 6,7,8]. Fig. 1. CWSSN network model Full size image
    New generation communication systems promise to implement a wide variety of new
    features requiring the exchange and transfer of a very wide range of information.
    For this, older generations (2G, 3G and 4G) do not meet the expectations and growing
    needs of communications and links; which requires the appearance of a new generation
    that is 5G. 5G designs require MIMO antenna arrays with hundreds of antenna elements
    on base stations (eNodeB). MIMO technology uses spatial multiplexing gain to achieve
    the highest spectral efficiency. Since several transmit antennas can be applied
    to OFDM-based Cognitive Radio systems, the researchers have designed and proposed
    the very promising candidate, called MIMO-OFDMA, which can compensate for lack
    of capacity while increasing spectral efficiency [4, 9]. OFDMA is considered a
    modulation and multiple access technique for 5G generation wireless networks.
    OFDMA is an extension of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) that
    can achieve adaptive bandwidth allocation in intelligent wireless cognitive sensors
    networks. In the MIMO technique, there are two concepts based on how base station
    antennas are used to serve users. They are divided into two categories: single-user
    MIMO and multi-users MIMO. In single-user MIMO, all streams from base station
    antennas are focused on a single user. In multi-users MIMO, different streams
    produced using a combination of different antennas are focused on different users
    or subscribers [4, 10]. The model, presented in the Fig. 1, is formulated by a
    graph R = (N; L; C; F), with: N is the set of the nodes of the network. L is the
    set of links that are communication pairs achievable on the duty of transmissions.
    This is the set of spectrum channels that are currently assigned to links in L.
    F is the set of simultaneous multi-hop data streams in the network. We consider
    Cognitive Radio networks based on MIMO-OFDMA, where there is secondary source
    node with nodes (E1, E2, …, EK), a MIMO-based relay station, and secondary destination
    node with nodes. (R1, R2, …, RK) in coexistence with the primary users (PUs),
    as shown in Fig. 1. Assume that each intelligent transmit/receive sensor node
    is equipped with a transmit antenna and a receive antenna, while the relay station
    is composed of AE broadcast antennas and AR receive antennas. Then, in our application,
    we assume that the number of antennas is finite AE = AR = 100 transmit/receive
    antennas in a definite path. In this research, this model is considered as a virtual
    network operated, it is composed by clusters. Actually in our application of intelligent
    farming, clusters are considered as lines of apricot/peach/olive plants. Each
    cluster has a responsible node called Cluster Head (CH) or SINK, which is the
    group leader that coordinates cluster members, aggregates, processes data and
    passes it to the data collector. The clustering method offers several objectives
    to know: the reduction of energy consumption, the minimization of communication,
    the load balancing, the extension of the service life of the network, the increase
    of the rate of the total connectivity and the reduction of delays, the optimization
    of bandwidth and the improvement of Quality of Service (QoS). Cluster members
    or smart sensors nodes can access neighboring clusters and route data between
    them. So, they measure the necessary data and send them to the SINK. Afterwards,
    the SINK processes the data streams and transmits them to the base stations, which
    are based on MIMO technology, using the 5G operated networks. 3 Dynamic Spectrum
    Access, Spectral Allocation and Metric Networks Generally, the technique allowing
    unlicensed users to dynamically access unused licensed tapes in order to minimize
    unused spectral bands or blanks is known as a dynamic spectrum access scheme.
    In the diagram above, unlicensed users essentially use unused licensed frequency
    bands at no charge. When the licensed user starts using the frequency band, the
    unlicensed user must release the group and move to another idle band. So, for
    the intended purpose and the desired purpose, the CR technique and the dynamic
    spectrum access scheme are major, interesting and essential solutions for increasing
    the use of the spectrum in intelligent radio cognitive wireless smart sensors
    networks [4]. In this paper, the impulse response function of the channel, denoted
    \( U_{i,j}^{l} \left( t \right) \) of the ith transmit antenna at the jth receive
    antenna at SUk at time t can be expressed as follows: $$ U_{i,j}^{l} \left( t
    \right) = \alpha_{i,j}^{l} \delta \left( {t - \tau_{i,j}^{l} } \right) { \exp
    }\left( { - J\phi_{i,j}^{l} } \right) $$ (1) With \( J = \sqrt { - j^{2} } \);
    i ∈ {1, 2, …, AR}, j ∈ {1, 2, …, AE}, and l ∈ {1, 2, …, L}; \( \left\{ {\tau_{i,j}^{l}
    } \right\} \) is the path delay; \( \left\{ {\alpha_{i,j}^{l} } \right\} \) is
    the envelope of the path and \( \left\{ {\phi_{i,j}^{l} } \right\} \) is the phase
    shift. We assume that \( \left\{ {\phi_{i,j}^{l} } \right\} \) is an independent
    and uniformly distributed random variable (i.i.d.) uniformly distributed between
    [0, 2π] and \( \left\{ {\alpha_{i,j}^{l} } \right\} \) is i.i.d. random variable.
    The path gains are assumed to be invariant in a frame duration Tf, but vary independently
    from frame to frame. In subsequent discussions, we can omit the discrete time
    index t when representing the impulse response of the channel. We can derive an
    impulse response from the AR × AE channels, denoted U(l), to the secondary relay
    station, remember that AR = AE = 100, as follows: $$ U^{\left( l \right)} \, =
    \,\left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}c} {u_{0,0}^{l} \quad u_{0,1}^{l} } & \cdots & {u_{0,99}^{l}
    } \\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ {u_{99,0}^{l} \quad u_{99,1}^{l} } & \cdots &
    {u_{99,99}^{l} } \\ \end{array} } \right] $$ (2) where \( U_{i,j}^{l} \) with
    i ∈ {0, 1, …, (AR − 1)}, j ∈ {0, 1, …, (AE − 1)}, and l ∈ {1, 2, …, L} is the
    impulse response of the channel specified by (1). Suppose that the path gains
    to be invariant in a frame duration Tf, but varies independently from frame to
    frame. Assume that the channel state information (CSI) is perfectly known at the
    receiver, using SVD (Singular Value Decomposition), the impulse response matrix
    of the channel can be designated as follows: $$ U^{\left( l \right)} \, = \,H^{\left(
    l \right)} \varLambda^{\left( l \right)} (V^{\left( l \right)} )^{U} $$ (3) with
    (·)U is the conjugated transpose of the matrix; \( \text{H}^{{(\text{l})}} \,
    \in \,{\mathcal{C}}^{{A_{R} \times A_{E} }} \) and \( \varvec{V}^{{(\text{l})}}
    \, \in \,{\mathcal{C}}^{{A_{R} \times A_{E} }} \) are unitary matrices and Λ(l)
    is a rectangular matrix whose diagonal elements {λl,1 ≥ λl,2 ≥ ⋯ ≥ λl,Amin ≥ 0
    where \( \text{A}_{\hbox{min} } \, = \,\hbox{min} \,\left\{ {A_{R} \, \times \,A_{E}
    } \right\}\left( {1\, \le \,\text{A}_{\hbox{min} } } \right) \) are the ordered
    singular values of the matrix U(l). Consequently, the whole wideband MIMO channel
    decomposes into Amin independent subchannels. Since we assume that the transmit
    node and the receive node are far enough apart, there is no direct link between
    them due to shading conditions and power limiting in the network. The relay process
    consists of two steps. In the first step, the transmitting nodes transmit signals
    to the relay station after detecting the spectral white space. The received signal,
    denoted \( y_{S}^{\left( l \right)} \), from the cognitive source node to the
    relay station can be expressed as follows: $$ y_{S}^{\left( l \right)} \, = \,\sqrt
    {p_{S}^{\left( l \right)} } U_{S}^{\left( l \right)} x^{\left( l \right)} \, +
    \,\sqrt {p_{P} } U_{P}^{\left( l \right)} x^{\left( P \right)} \, + \,\sum\nolimits_{n
    \ne l}^{L} {\sqrt {p_{S}^{\left( n \right)} } U_{S}^{\left( n \right)} x^{\left(
    n \right)} \, + \,n_{S}^{\left( l \right)} } $$ (4) With \( p_{S}^{\left( l \right)}
    \) and \( p_{S}^{\left( n \right)} \) are respectively the transmission power
    of the source node lth and the source node nth; \( \mathcal{P}_{P} \) represents
    the transmission power of the base station PU (BS). x(l) and x(n) respectively
    denote the signals sent by the lth source node and the nth source node; x(p) denotes
    the signals sent by the BS PU. \( U_{S}^{\left( l \right)} \) and \( U_{S}^{\left(
    n \right)} \) indicate the impulse response of the transmitter channel of the
    source node lth and the source node nth to the receiver of the relay node specified
    by (2), respectively; \( \varvec{U}_{P}^{\left( l \right)} \) indicates the impulse
    response of the PU base station channel to the relay node receiver specified by
    (2); and \( n_{S}^{\left( l \right)} \) is the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN)
    with zero mean and variance \( \sigma_{S}^{2} \) [4, 9]. With regard to the dynamic
    spectrum access, a generally fixed spectrum allocation scheme is used in the CWSSN
    deployment. CWSSN can be used on unlicensed and licensed tape [4, 10]. Spectra
    are directly associated with the cost that increases the cost of the network.
    However, LPWAN and SigFox-LoRa WAN networks can also operate in the unlicensed
    band. Access to multiple channels to comply with different spectrum regulations:
    As we know that the availability of spectrum frequency varies, a band that is
    available in Tunisia may not be available in another country. Thus, if the smart
    sensors nodes are designed with a predefined frequency band, they create a problem
    for the user. This problem can be overcome by the use of the Cognitive Radio capacity,
    which changes their communication frequency according to the availability of the
    spectrum. In the classical WSN [1], the Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) is considering
    as the main key to solving the global spectrum shortage. Open wireless support
    subjects DSA systems to unauthorized use of the spectrum by illegitimate users.
    Secondary user authentication is therefore essential to ensure the proper functioning
    of DSA systems [1, 11,12,13,14]. Detecting crowd misuse of spectrum eliminates
    the need for dedicated sensor deployment and dramatically reduces deployment and
    maintenance costs. Based on the foregoing that’s applied at CWSSNs and especially
    in a DSA system of the CWSSNs, the spectrum owner leases its underutilized spectrum
    under license to unlicensed users. To improve spectrum efficiency in the CWSSNs,
    the spectrum owner can regulate spectrum access by issuing spectrum authorizations,
    each specifying a frequency channel, a geographic area, and a duration. A valid
    spectrum license is used to authorize the use of the corresponding frequency channel
    in the specified area and duration. In traditional WSN networks [1], the Quality
    of Service (QoS) is typically characterized by four parameters: bandwidth, delay,
    jitter and reliability. To avoid dangerous consequences in critical applications
    and especially in the CWSSNs, local storage virtualized-operated networks must
    maintain an adequate level of Quality of Service. The QoS support is a complex
    issue due to resource constraints such as: processing power, memory, and power
    sources in wireless smart sensors nodes. The QoS is a management concept that
    aims to optimize the resources of a virtualized-operated network or a process
    on the one hand, and to guarantee good performance to critical applications for
    the organization of somewhere else. The QoS allows users to offer different speeds
    and response times depending on the applications considered and the protocols
    that are implemented at the structure level. Different objective functions for
    measuring communication quality metrics in the network. Three objective functions
    of wireless communication performance are considered in this paper: Maximize Throughput/debit-rate
    (5), Reduce Power Consumption (6) and Minimize Bit Error Rate (BER) (7): $$ f_{{{
    \hbox{max} }\_{\text{debit}}}} \, = \,\frac{{log_{2} \left( {\bar{M}} \right)}}{{log_{2}
    \left( {M_{ \hbox{max} } } \right)}} $$ (5) $$ f_{{{ \hbox{min} }\_energy}} \,
    = \,1\, - \,\frac{{\bar{P}}}{{P_{max} }} $$ (6) $$ f_{{{ \hbox{min} }\_BER}} \,
    = \,1\, - \,\frac{{log_{10} \left( {0.5} \right)}}{{log_{10} \left( {\overline{{P_{BER}
    }} } \right)}} $$ (7) We will also study the Signal-Interference-to-Noise Ratio
    (SINR) that is used to measure the quality of communications. In link transmissions,
    the SINR can be thought of as the received power of the signal provided at the
    divided receiver by the sum of the received powers of unintended signals (interference)
    from other links on the same spectrum channel. For a link (i, j) on the spectral
    channel c, its SINR ratio can be calculated as follows (8): $$ SINR_{\text{ij}}
    \left( c \right)\, = \,\frac{{G_{ij} p_{i} }}{{\sigma^{2} \, + \,\mathop \sum
    \nolimits_{{\left( {a,b} \right) \in I\left( c \right),\left( {a,b} \right) \ne
    \left( {i,j} \right)}} G_{aj} p_{a} }} $$ (8) With Pi: the transmission power
    of the sender i. In this paper, we assume that the transmit power of all links
    is at the fixed level. Gij: the gain of the channel between the transmitter i
    and the receiver j, which can be denoted \( k /(d_{ij} )^{\alpha } \); K: the
    path loss constant; dij: the distance between i and j; α: the exponent of path
    loss; σ2: the thermal noise that can be considered a constant, and the sigma notation
    presents the global interference to the receiver j, which is generated by the
    links transmitting concurrently on the current spectrum channel; I(c): the set
    of links sharing the spectrum channel c [4]. To ensure the effective transmission
    of the link, each intended signal must be decoded successfully at the receiver.
    4 Spectral Detection Based on Cyclo-Stationary Intelligent Agriculture Application
    and Simulation The use of the sensors network in the field of agriculture is not
    new. Good crop irrigation is one of the most important aspects of product performance
    and quality. If the plant does not receive the necessary amount of water and therefore
    not enough moisture in the soil, it dries and veins. On the other hand, an excess
    of water or exceeding the water limit causes too much moisture which is suitable
    for the appearance and development of plant diseases [4, 15]. In addition, unnecessary
    irrigation is significantly wasting water resources. In this context, the intelligent
    sensors nodes for measuring soil moisture (dendrometers) and air temperature on
    agricultural land have been developed. The measured values from the sensors nodes
    had to be reliably transferred with minimal power consumption, regardless of their
    position in the field and the distance to the central control unit of the system.
    CWSSN has become a logical choice because it provides all the requirements. The
    proposed intelligent irrigation system (see Fig. 2.) is designed to autonomously
    decide when to activate and deactivate electronic valves for the release/shutdown
    of water in the agricultural field [16]. The main control unit manages the autonomous
    decision-making process. Thus, in addition to the automated control of the irrigation
    process, the user can configure an autonomous operation of the system. In this
    mode of operation, the appropriate decision on irrigation intervals is made by
    an intelligent irrigation algorithm, based on ambient temperature, soil moisture,
    brightness (day/night) and the season considered (spring, summer, autumn and winter)
    applied on the SigFox CWSSN [16]. Fig. 2. Application for IoT intelligent agriculture
    [16] Full size image In order to have a complete study, we detail the operating
    principle of the irrigation system of intelligent agriculture application. Figure
    2. shows and presents the functioning diagram of the new irrigation management
    deployment. This irrigation management system architecture deployment is based
    on smart sensors technology and consists in allowing remote control of the irrigation
    system to facilitate the management of the water network [17]. Then, new irrigation
    management system allows an automatic control of the electronic valves that close
    or open the water flow. The system optimizes water consumption because it irrigates
    with the proper amount according to weather conditions and the plant’s needs [16].
    It’s saving resource such as water with IoT technology and contributing to enhance
    the environment too [16,17,18]. To provide and to prospect the need of water for
    a parcel irrigation with a good estimation and precise accurate quantity of water
    [16, 17, 19]. Some apricot-peach and olive roots are too dry while others are
    water logged smart sensors. The moisture soil smart sensors are simultaneously
    placed at different depths, under each a tree (apricot/peach/olive), the local
    water retention in the soil can be assessed. By measuring evapotranspiration it
    is possible to work out how much irrigation water is being actually absorbed by
    the plants [16, 17, 20]. To promote agricultural research, to deliberate an important
    issues of agricultural research and to select/to use the better system versus
    nature of plants. For this, we have installed, at the same time and to be placed
    on the different footings: one connected at apricot-peach orchard whereas the
    other at olive orchard, two different wireless smart sensors systems to monitor
    soil water status to plan irrigation in an olive orchard and in peach-apricot
    orchard. Data has been recorded with the same, but information has been transmitted
    to the platform by two different connections (5G and SigFox). Two libelium waspmote
    plug & sense-smart agriculture have been deployed with watermark smart sensors
    in different depths to control soil moisture with fruit diameter dendrometer smart
    sensors to measure the size of the fruit (see Fig. 3); and temperature and humidity
    smart sensors to monitor environmental conditions. One of the smart sensors platforms
    is connected to a 5G shield and the other with the SigFox. The information collected
    by the smart sensors has been sent to the platforms that includes both 5G and
    SigFox technologies. To manage SigFox-LoRa WAN stations however a server has had
    to be configured. A Meshlium IoT Gateway has been used embedding management system
    making data handling easier. Farmers can get valuable information to schedule
    irrigation timing to avoid stress conditions, which is fundamental on apricot-peach
    and olive plants [16, 17, 21]. Agriculture smart sensors networks using waspmote
    send data using SigFox LoRa WAN communication system. Alarms can also be sending
    to the mobile phone network using waspmote’s LoRa board. Data gathered by waspmote
    smart sensor platform can be sent to a gateway or directly to the cloud. The information
    collected in the Meshlium Gateway can be visualized in a platform which concentrates
    and allows knowing the state in each parcel. We carry out the application which
    can be controlled with computers, smart phones and also tablets. Multi-protocol
    router is used to gather all the data from the smart sensors nodes and leaving
    them in the cloud computing. The new smart agriculture IoT kit is factory programmed
    and enables monitoring of environmental parameters in agriculture. The IoT kit
    includes a visualization plugging in Meshlium where you can check data in real-time,
    display a graphic with every measured parameter between two time periods or geo-locate
    the smart nodes via GPS and compare different parameters in the same node. Fig.
    3. Apricot fruit diameter dendrometer smart sensors [16] Full size image We note
    that we can distinguish two types of intelligent sensor: intelligent sensor used
    in the ground and intelligent sensor used on the plant. In our application, we
    can use temperature sensors, humidity sensors Waspmote, agricultural product monitoring
    sensors called dendrometers smart sensors (see Fig. 3). We recall that the deployment
    of intelligent sensors nodes in the plot to be controlled and supervised is gigantic
    and an important and essential role for the design of an efficient and cost-effective
    irrigation system in intelligent agriculture. In this context, we have established
    a topology of intelligent sensors deployment of the irrigation system designed
    for our application of intelligent farming as shown in Fig. 4. Remember to the
    smart sensors array is descripted as following as: the smart sensors array consisted
    of a centrally located receiver connected to a laptop computer and multiple smart
    sensors nodes installed in the field (irrigation parcel). The smart sensors nodes
    consisted of smart sensors (soil moisture smart sensors and thermocouples, Waspmote,…)
    an active transmitter which transmitted data to the receiver. The smart sensors
    boards acquired sensors values and wirelessly (CR/5G/SigFox-LoRa WAN) transmitted
    those values to a centrally located radio frequency receiver. The board can read
    up to three watermark granular resistive type soil moisture smart sensors and
    up to four thermocouple temperature smart sensors. Fig. 4. Network topology of
    application IoT intelligent agriculture Full size image The topology of the Cognitive-Radio
    IoT in the simulation of the intelligent farming application is shown in Fig.
    4 where 100 nodes are randomly deployed over an area of 2000 m to 1000 m. Each
    smart sensor node is mounted with a single TRX. There are several streams of data
    simultaneously in the network. The transmission power of each link is set at 13
    dBm and the thermal background noise σ2 is equal to −100 dBm. The gain of the
    channel is defined as \( hij\, = \,k /(d_{ij} )^{\alpha } \), where dij is the
    distance between two smart sensors. We adopt the path loss constant k = 1 and
    the path loss exponent α = 5. Figure 5 shows an example of a Multiple Inputs-Multiple
    Outputs (MIMO) system, which provides multiple antennas across the transmitter
    and receiver of a wireless communication system. MIMO systems increasingly use
    in communication systems for potential capacity gains in achieving the use of
    multiple antennas. Fig. 5. MIMO simulation Full size image BER performance analysis

    Simulation of BER metric Full size image The genetic algorithm (GA) is a method
    of solving optimization problems, with or without constraints, based on a natural
    selection process. We used this algorithm to simulate our metrics from our new
    CWSSN network which are presented in Eqs. (8), (6) and (5). Figure 7 proves the
    simulation of SINR; but, Fig. 8 shows the energy consumption simulation; so, Fig.
    9 presents the throughput simulation. Fig. 7. Simulation of SINR with genetic

    paper, a cognitive networking with dynamic spectrum access mechanism for WSSNs
    is introduced. The channel availability of likelihood distribution is computed
    using continuous-time Markov chain considering primary transmitting users, temporal
    channel usage, channel pattern and spatial distribution. A slotted aloha medium
    access control is considered. The outcome shows significant performance improvement.
    An improvement of 18.5% is achieved in terms of collision reduction and an improvement
    of 40.2% in terms of throughput is achieved. We proposed the resource allocation
    scheme by applying the MIMO-OFDMA based on Cognitive Radio over virtualized-operated
    networks. In the other hand and remember to, the available limited frequency spectrum
    is not enough to cater the increasing in traffic demand. Thus, the Cognitive Radio
    technology plays an important role in such a scenario by dynamically accessing
    the licensed spectrum. Among the cognitive tasks, spectrum sensing is found to
    be the most energy a consuming one. In this paper, an energy efficient spectrum
    sensing technique was proposed which employs a dedicated wireless smart sensors
    network to sense the spectrum. The simulation results show that the proposed virtualized-operated
    network with clusters, subset and special subset formation shows an improved energy
    efficient spectrum sensing approach increases the overall virtualized-operated
    network life time of the Cognitive Radio networks. References Abedllaoui, M.:

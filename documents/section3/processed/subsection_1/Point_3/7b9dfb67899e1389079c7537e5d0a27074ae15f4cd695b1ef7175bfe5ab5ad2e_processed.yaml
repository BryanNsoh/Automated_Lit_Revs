    4.0 for a sustainable future Article 09 April 2022 1 Introduction Agriculture
    4.0 focuses on Precision Agriculture (PA) to replace traditional farming with
    smart farming through the introduction of modern, scalable, and automated technological
    solutions. The technological enablers of Agriculture 4.0 includes the Internet
    of Things (IoT), Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cloud Computing, Remote
    Sensing, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and the fifth generation (5G) network
    to deliver automated, predictive and reliable smart farming decisions [1]. The
    5G network supports advanced communication technologies which help in the widespread
    of IoT-based services in future generations [2, 3]. As agricultural practices
    involve the acquisition of large volumes of real-time weather data to be transmitted,
    processed, and stored for farmers to make time-sensitive decisions like irrigation
    scheduling, a lot of energy is consumed from IoT components such as sensors used
    for data acquisition, data transmission through communication protocols and data
    storage in cloud or edge, etc. Most of the IoT components emit greenhouses gases
    (GHGs) either directly or indirectly that are hazardous to the environment due
    to extreme device manufacturing, large shipments of those devices, overloading
    the data centers to serve millions of services, and heavy data traffic generated
    from billions of devices [4]. Promoting biodegradable IoT component designs with
    operational cost management and reduced power consumption can remarkably improve
    the efficiency of agricultural activities with little or no impact on the environment.
    PA applications relying on sensor-generated data for executing diverse applications
    necessitate the use of big data analytics coupled with Artificial Intelligence
    to perform intelligent analysis of these enormous data volumes associated with
    weather, soil, and crop characteristics. Wireless sensors employed for real-time
    weather data sensing facilitate and comprehend the intricate correlation of climate
    change and crop growth in real-time, decreasing the problem of environment parameter
    fluctuation and non-linearity in data acquisition when the agriculture field is
    located in a remote location. Among the widespread applications of PA, smart irrigation
    is gaining increasing attention because crop yield and farmland productivity are
    highly reliant on irrigation scheduling decisions that depend on environmental
    parameters like temperature, rainfall, etc. Traditional weather stations though
    help to determine the impact of climate change on crop yield but issues like the
    agriculture field being located in remote areas can cause weather data to fluctuate
    and data may become inconsistent. Unlike traditional weather stations, IoT-oriented
    agriculture practices are advantageous because real-time data can be acquired
    at any place and at any time through low-cost interconnected sensors transmitted
    to the cloud for storage through suitable communication protocols [5]. Despite
    the numerous advantages IoT offers in PA, the growing interconnection of IoT devices
    in PA is extremely power-consuming and generates GHGs that may lead to loss of
    soil fertility in agricultural land and also generates non-biodegradable solid
    and hazardous wastes from components like active Radio Frequency Identification
    (RFID) tags that could not be recycled easily posing threat to our environment
    [6]. An increasing number of IoT connections are energy intensive as huge data
    are transmitted and processed. Billions of batteries supporting energy-intensive
    IoT operations are also disposed of and replaced throughout the life cycle of
    these IoT devices. Combined global e-waste increased dramatically in 2016 which
    was 44.7 million metric tonnes an average of 6.1 kg/inh (kilograms per inhabitant)
    as compared to 5.8 kg/inh in 2014. However, only 20% (8.9 Mt) of total global
    e-waste is recycled globally. A report presented by Guardian Environment Network
    estimates that in the upcoming 10 years, 3.5% of the global carbon emissions will
    be coming from IoT devices [7]. Thus, the adoption of GreenIoT (GIoT) is inevitable
    to address the GHG emission problem from IoT components which in turn helps in
    better waste management through recycling due to biodegradable waste generation
    from components like passive RFID tags [6]. Design goals of GIoT include operating
    cost reduction and minimizing energy constraint issues of IoT components using
    renewable sources of energy and energy harvesting (EH) techniques and reducing
    the effects of GHGs emissions on the environment. To achieve this design goal,
    a plethora of green designs of hardware and software components are implemented
    that include Green Wireless Sensor Networks (GWSN), Green Radio frequency identification
    (GRFIDs) tags, Green Cloud Computing (GCC), and Green Datacenters (GDC), etc.
    to achieve maximum energy efficiency in all the stages namely, sensing, processing,
    transmitting and storing data [8]. Recently, UAVs emerged as a promising technique
    for intelligent monitoring of the agriculture field with considerable transmission
    power reduction and minimized environmental pollution unlike conventional IoT-based
    agriculture field monitoring techniques [6, 9]. As a result, this article provides
    an overall assessment of approaches for greening IoT leveraging UAVs to allow
    energy-saving, maintaining QoS, low-cost service delivery to vast regions, and
    mitigating the carbon footprint. Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) are an
    alternative low-power communication protocol to traditional communication protocols
    that connects low-bandwidth, battery-powered IoT devices across large distances
    [10]. LPWANs support far-off communication using narrow-range communication channels
    for noise reduction [10, 11]. Earlier works based on energy-saving LPWANs are
    therefore also studied in detail in this paper. Algorithms based on Artificial
    Intelligence (AI) use methods to examine large volumes of data generated from
    IoT devices to provide value-added public services [12]. Intelligent processing
    can be done using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to make time-sensitive, reliable,
    and accurate decisions for different PA tasks like irrigation scheduling to ensure
    crop yield with optimum utilization of water resources [13]. So, ML-based solutions
    for different PA tasks along with different energy management strategies are elaborated.
    The need for adopting 5G networks to meet low cost, low latency, and energy efficiency
    requirements of PA applications is also discussed for the sustainable transition
    from Agriculture 4.0 to Agriculture 5.0. IoT networks need to connect and establish
    communication links across numerous ubiquitous things, which generate a significant
    volume of data that is both vast and heterogeneous. Data processing by IoT devices
    themselves is constrained by their limited computational power and battery, which
    act as the device’s energy sources. Thus, it is necessary to use the cloud computing
    paradigm to process the data that IoT network devices create [14]. Processing
    the sensor-generated data transmitted using a large number of IoT communication
    protocols in the cloud or edge is also very energy intensive. Therefore, augmenting
    energy-saving solutions in the cloud or edge-based processing to process this
    enormous volume of data is also required to address the issue of energy consumption
    of the massive number of interconnected IoT components. Different energy-conserving
    strategies in machine learning, cloud computing, and edge computing-based data
    processing, therefore, need to be discussed in detail. Furthermore, the pros and
    cons of different energy-saving approaches adopted in GIoT and layer-specific
    security threats to GIoT systems are also discussed based on which avenues for
    future research in PA are presented. Based on the current survey, the main goal
    of our paper is to conceptualize a GIoT framework leveraging UAVs, LPWANs, and
    5G networks that meet the requirements of designing energy-aware, cost-effective,
    and environment-friendly PA applications for realizing the true potential of GIoT
    in PA while enabling ubiquitous connectivity. 1.1 Organization of the Paper The
    rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the motivation
    and significance of the review. Section 3 describes IoT enablers and associated
    challenges. Section 4 describes green solutions for IoT Enablers and their implementation
    concerns. Data Processing techniques and different energy management strategies
    are described in Sect. 5. Section 6 describes different GIoT strategies leveraging
    Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs), and 5G
    Networks. Section 7 explains the proposed GIoT Framework for Energy-Aware PA applications.
    Section 8 describes the different security attacks in different layers of GIoT
    and solutions to mitigate those threats. Section 9 concludes. Table 1 Energy saving
    methods for GIoT based smart PA design components Full size table 2 Motivation
    In PA applications, an enormous number of interconnected IoT devices communicate
    with one another to exchange huge volumes of weather data that directly or indirectly
    generate a lot of GHGs. These GHGs may result in loss of soil fertility in agricultural
    land hindering crop growth and yield. Thus, a significant reduction of environmental
    impacts on agricultural land must be ensured in terms of GHG emission reduction
    [4]. Adopting practices that minimize power usage and emissions without compromising
    system performance necessitates the use of GIoT. Conserving energy and reducing
    \\(\\text{CO}_{2}\\) emissions are the main obstacles in the implementation of
    a green environment. Numerous studies are working on creating green communication
    that minimizes harmful emissions (GHG), maximizes bandwidth usage, and consumes
    as little power as possible while maintaining the optimal performance of emerging
    IoT applications (such as PA). Adoption of green designs for IoT components can
    considerably reduce the environmental impacts of GHGs emissions on crop growth
    and yield by cutting down carbon emissions effectively. Furthermore, problems
    like the increasing number of power-hungry components in IoT interconnections,
    non-biodegradable dumping of non-recyclable waste generated from components like
    active RFID tags, energy-intensive computations of a huge volume of data in cloud
    or edge, operational costs incurred in an increasing number of interconnections
    of IoT components, overloaded data centers with enormous data traffic, etc. needs
    to be tackled successfully for leveraging the true potential of IoT in automation
    of PA tasks. All these factors have roused researchers for finding green solutions
    for IoT-based PA applications for designing low-cost and energy-efficient IoT
    components with minimal GHG emissions. To identify the significance of the paradigm
    shift of IoT to GIoT, we analyze different emerging trends like 5G networks and
    UAVs, etc. leveraging which energy-saving approaches can be designed to meet GIoT
    design goals. The suitability of LPWANs is also ascertained as a low power-consuming
    alternative to traditional communication protocols while providing wider coverage
    of agricultural land. Thus, this survey is envisioned to provide an organized
    assessment of existing GIoT-based PA solutions including 5G networks, UAVs, and
    LPWANs to provide farmers with a cost-effective, low-power consuming, environment-friendly,
    robust, and autonomous alternative to IoT-based PA solutions to replace traditional
    farming with smart green farming for sustainable progress towards Agriculture
    5.0 while ensuring ubiquitous connectivity in PA. Table 1 illustrates a few energy-saving

    and boundless internet users are making the data centers exhausted. Figure 15
    portrays the approximate growth in data transmitted or received over the internet,
    energy consumption due to sensing, processing, and storing, and overburden on
    data centers due to increasing data traffic and predicted increasing number of
    connections from 2000 to 2021. Data traffic over the internet from 2010 to 2015
    ranges around 100 exabyte in 30 days (Eb/M) and can extend to 519 Eb/M with a
    growth rate of \\(31.58\\%\\) annually [20]. IoT components with exaggerated data
    traffic, data processing, and storage needs generate massive GHGs in the environment
    directly or indirectly. Worldwide internet traffic has risen 3 times from 2015
    to 2019 and can further raise in the current year, according to CISCO. Energy
    consumed from IoT components releases harmful \\(\\text{CO}_{2}\\) flinching from
    35.6 to 43.2 billion metric tons in 2040 [21]. Carbon footprint increased by 5
    times in the year 2020 due to the increasing use of servers in the IP-stimulated
    society [22]. Ample amount of data processing in the IoT network results in inflated
    power consumption and harms health and the environment due to the emission of
    GHGs as per the CISCO 2020 report. Reduction of GHGs emissions, renewable energy
    resources like solar energy usage, and recycling generated waste is the new criterion
    for the organizations. All IoT devices run on batteries, therefore conserving
    energy during data transmission is vital to increase the network’s operational
    time. Energy-hungry IoT devices can be categorized into three components [23]:
    (i) Power consumed by processor components. (ii) Power consumed during data collection
    and switching devices (ON/OFF) etc. (iii) Power consumed by communication protocols
    to enable communication. Sum total of power consumption can be expressed as [24]:
    $$\\begin{aligned} CP = TP + RP + SP + AP+ FP --GP \\end{aligned}$$ (1) where
    CP is consumed power, TP is Transmission Power consumption, RP is Data receiving
    Power consumption, SP is energy spent during data acquisition, AP is Power consumed
    during switching ON/OFF a device, FP is Fixed Power consumed from IoT devices
    and GP is Gain of Power from energy harvesting methods. The power requirement
    can be measured using an external measuring tool to get an overall idea of power
    consumption ignoring power consumption from individual components. Network simulators
    can be used to evaluate the power requirement used in modeling-based methods [25,

    lessen power consumption while increasing automation and seamless connectivity
    of GIoT-based PA applications. Fig. 16 Applications of GIoT in PA Full size image
    Unlike traditional IoT, GIoT is an environment-friendly alternative that minimizes
    the adverse environmental impacts of computer hardware development and deconstruction
    while ensuring long-term environmental protection from hazardous GHG emissions.

    3 IoT Enablers and Associated Challenges The enabling technologies for IoT include
    RFID tags, cloud computing, internet, sensing networks, Machine to Machine (M2M),
    data centers and Communication Networks [6]. RFID tags minimize energy usage and
    radio costs during transmission. It uses tags for electronically marking goods
    in response to reader requests. RFID tags can be active and passive [6]. The active
    tags are fitted with a battery that boosts signal transmission. Passive tags use
    the induction principle that does not require batteries which makes the environment
    free from harmful toxic emissions from batteries. Hence, using passive tags is
    a biodegradable alternative as it generates renewable waste. In RFID tags, issues
    like overhearing and tag collisions must also be addressed very carefully [6,
    44]. Green Sensors offers a variety of low-power storage sensor nodes. It also
    aimed to improve energy efficiency, lengthen network life, eliminate relay nodes,
    and make the system cost-effective by efficiently employing resources. Persistent
    fulfillment of energy requirements for energy-constrained battery-operated IoT
    equipment is attainable by applying energy harvesting approaches using renewable
    energy sources. The power-hungry components of Datacenters (DC) are shown in Fig.
    17. Fig. 17 Power hungry components of datacenters [45] Full size image 4 Green
    Solutions for IoT Technology Enablers IoT components produce a significant amount
    of carbon footprint due to the use of scarce raw materials and their energy requirement
    in manufacturing, operating, and recycling processes. To tackle these issues,
    the Green IoT (G-IoT) paradigm comprising of designing green components has emerged
    as a research area of interest to mitigate such carbon footprint generation from
    IoT components. Different green solutions for IoT Technology Enablers are summarized
    here: 4.1 Green Wireless Sensor Networks To save energy from wireless sensors
    used for agriculture monitoring, specific sensing or peer-powering sensors should
    be used. Such techniques of efficient communication route forwarding between sensors
    and cloud systems recorded at the base station should be followed by sleep scheduling
    and compressed sensing. An effective load-balancing algorithm can also be used
    at the gateway nodes. Wireless sensors can also use resource allocator factor’s
    computation as a means of green wireless sensor networks (GWSN) [41]. Usually,
    sleep mode is activated for sensors to save energy, and greater power savings
    can only be attained by activating the WSNs only when data transmission is required
    [6]. 4.2 Green M2M Communication To save energy in M2M communication (GM2M), the
    transmission power can be intelligently adjusted, effective communication protocols
    can be designed, activity scheduling, collaborative energy-saving techniques,
    and energy harvesting (EH) must be used [41]. Energy Harvesting techniques may
    be used to capture energy directly from the environment like solar energy and
    wind energy etc. [46, 47]. 4.3 Green Radio Frequency Identification Tags RFID
    tags can be made greener by lowering the size and applying non-recyclable material
    during production [6]. Passive RFID tags that do not need batteries can be a promising
    green solution [44]. Techniques such as data aggregation, network coding, adaptive
    sampling, compression, routing with energy as a routing metric, and multipath
    routing are all green solutions to maximize energy saving in a GIoT environment
    [48, 41]. 4.4 Green Cloud Computing Green Cloud Computing (GCC) helps in both
    energy and cost reduction in the cloud by efficient allocation of cost-effective
    resources. Energy management strategies of green cloud such as Virtual Machine
    (VM) can be deployed to save energy by consolidation, relocation, placement, and
    allocation [49]. Energy-aware techniques such as renewable energy sources must
    be used to store data that can be easily replenished in nature which are cost-effective
    solutions [45]. Virtual machine (VM) migration and adaptive sampling are the communication
    techniques that can be used in green cloud [41, 44, 50]. 4.5 Green Data Centers
    Dynamic power allocation like dynamic voltage and frequency scaling, vary-on/vary-off
    are all useful for making Green Data Centers (GDC). Greening the IoT entails lowering
    energy while increasing the efficiency of automated connectivity among devices
    [6]. Duty cycling, compressive sensing, and cooperative relaying are all solutions
    that can be utilized to extend the battery life of data storage units [44]. The
    data reduction solution is concerned with lowering communication delays by aggregating
    data to reduce average data transfer rates and improve QoS [15]. Routing approaches
    aim to improve a network’s ability to handle data traffic by carefully selecting
    cluster heads throughout the data transfer process [15, 41]. 4.6 Green Internet
    and Communication Technology For energy saving in internet and communication technology
    (GICT) only the necessary data needs to be transmitted, the wireless data path’s
    overall length must be reduced and renewable green energy sources instead of non-renewable
    energy sources must be encouraged [41]. Figure 18 portrays a distinctive manifestation
    of green designs suggested for a paradigm shift from IoT to GIoT to ensure QoS
    in terms of saving energy, and cost, lowering latency in communication, prolonging
    the lifetime of IoT devices, and reducing GHG emissions to support green transmission
    and communication. Fig. 18 Paradigm shift from IoT to GIoT to adopt green designs
    for PA Full size image Several energy-saving techniques are adopted to implement
    GIoT. Wake-up radio is a scheme to reduce the idle listening period of sensors,
    which incurs extra power consumption for IoT-based data transmission components.
    The radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting mechanism keeps the wake-up radio in
    a deep sleep state which becomes active only after receiving an external RF signal
    to wake up the radio. This reduces the hardware requirement and signal processing
    to execute idle listening resulting in higher energy efficiency [51]. Duty cycling
    is another technique to reduce energy consumption which keeps the node in a sleep
    state most of the time and wakes up only at specific moments to increase the lifespan
    of nodes up to 5–10 years. The duty cycling technique is a trade-off between energy
    consumption and delays in data delivery to the target node. To overcome this delay
    problem, an additional wake-up radio channel can be used [52]. The energy consumption
    due to the sensor-generated data transmission is more than local data processing
    within the sensor node. The data aggregation mechanism conserves energy by eliminating
    redundant data transmission in dense sensors. Data aggregation is a process by
    which multiple similar packets are converted into a single packet. Several techniques
    like probability-based routing, mobility-based routing, cluster head communication,
    etc. can be used to improve latency, transmission power requirement, mobility,
    and network lifetime of sensors and other power-hungry data transmission components
    [53]. Since the number of sensors deployed to monitor an agriculture field is
    increasing, the need for new energy-saving mechanisms to reduce power consumption,
    cost, transmission delay, and network traffic is increasing. Compressed sensing
    is such an energy-saving mechanism to reduce power consumption, cost, transmission
    delay, and network traffic which shows that sparse signals and information in
    sensors can be exactly regenerated from very few random linear measurements. Figure
    19 describes the pros and cons of different energy-saving techniques adopted for
    the implementation of GIoT-based PA. Fig. 19 Pros and cons of different energy
    saving techniques adopted for GIoT based PA Full size image 4.7 Implementation
    Concerns of GIoT Based PA There are six primary implementation concerns to be
    resolved when creating a GIoT-based PA solution viz., hardware, data analytics,
    maintenance, mobility, infrastructure, data security, and privacy [35]. These
    implementation concerns can be explained as follows: (i) Hardware concerns: Different
    types of sensors can be used in IoT-based PA applications. The selection of sensors
    and meters for IoT devices to be used in PA is a hardware concern. (ii) Data analytics
    concerns: It mainly concerns the application of predictive algorithms and machine
    learning or deep learning techniques in IoT-based sensor-generated data to obtain
    a nutritive solution for smart PA. (iii) Maintenance concerns: The primary concern
    is to utilize different regular sensors that monitors all IoT interconnected devices
    as these devices can be easily damaged in the agriculture field. (iv) Mobility
    concerns: The primary concern is the type of wireless communication link like
    4G, 5G, 6LowPan and LoRa used to establish the connection between different sensors
    that are distributed over a large agricultural area. (v) Infrastructure concerns:
    The primary concern is the installation and development of IoT networking architecture
    using technologies like fog computing, cloud computing, network virtualization,
    etc. (vi) Data security and privacy concerns: Adaption of GIoT-based agriculture
    may make the system more susceptible to security attack by an intruder raising
    new security concerns which necessitate more secure communications to be established
    in the smart agriculture filed. 5 Data Processing Techniques and Energy Management
    Because IoT devices lack the computational power to analyze the acquired data,
    ML can be used for extracting meaningful information insights to generate intelligent
    predictive decisions based on acquired sensor data. Cloud computing appears as
    a promising paradigm to deliver high-performance computing and large storage capacity
    to satisfy the pervasive requirement for data processing in IoT networks. Cloud
    computing allows battery-powered IoT devices to offload various functions (such
    as data cleansing, and redundancy elimination) to the cloud. Edge computing allows
    the workload to be offloaded from the cloud to a location closer to the data source
    at the edge of the network to be efficiently handled by the users. Machine Learning,
    Cloud, and Edge computing are summarized in this section responsible for energy-intensive
    data processing along with different energy management techniques. 5.1 Machine
    Learning and Energy Management Following are some pertinent research works in
    the field of PA using ML algorithms such as fertilizer prediction [54], weather
    monitoring [55,56,57], soil moisture monitoring [58, 59], soil moisture monitoring
    with blockchain-based security [60]. To adjust irrigation schedules in response
    to changing weather conditions, ML process a vast amount of weather data [55,
    57]. Fuzzy logic is also used for mathematical modeling of unpredictably varying
    weather parameters. Long periods of data surveillance and monitoring are required
    to assess the accuracy of fuzzy logic. For precision irrigation, constant updating
    of irrigation schedules is accomplished by comparing ideal weather patterns with
    changing weather patterns. Hard coding is avoided with ML, and continual updating
    is achievable by learning from past input data [13]. There has been a substantial
    amount of research on the use of ML to attain energy savings. Artificial intelligence
    (AI) is identified as a possible driver in the optimization of energy resources
    and ML is accelerating the growth of IoT interconnected devices [61]. Localized
    AI in edge computing will filter data so that only relevant data is transmitted
    to the cloud. As a result, there are significant bandwidth and data transmission
    cost savings [62]. ML models help CPUs of edge devices run more quickly and efficiently
    at higher speeds and lower power levels. Video games, smart speakers, drones,
    security cameras, wearable health monitors, etc. are some examples of edge AI-enabled
    technology [7]. A cloud-based data center with real-time power management and
    resource allocation is proposed in [63]. The power requirements of cooling systems
    and data centers are estimated. A community and cloud-based data center powered
    by green energy results in saving 15.09 % on energy costs. On a 4G and 5G network,
    the proposed cloud-based approach creates a communication link with power users.
    Energy-efficient unicast (EEU) and reliable unicast (RU) efficient routing algorithms
    between communicating nodes, as well as an energy model of each node energy consumption,
    were suggested in [64]. The amount of energy used at nodes depends on the software
    operations involved in message transmission, reception, and the number of transmission
    attempts made. The Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector protocol is used to find the
    shortest path between the communication nodes, and the RU protocol is used to
    calculate the likelihood that messages will be delivered successfully over that
    path. The EEU protocol identifies a path between the source and the destination
    that uses the least amount of energy at the nodes along the way. The EEU protocol
    consumes the least amount of energy possible, whereas the RU protocol increases
    the likelihood of delivery. The topic-based data transfer protocol using the mobile
    publish-subscribe Fog computing model is proposed in [65]. An event-driven, context-aware
    distribution system is utilized to decrease the amount of data that is transmitted
    between IoT networks and servers. It can be seen that the protocol’s data traffic
    has been considerably lowered, and its delivery ratio has been considerably decreased.
    ML may be utilized in energy-saving IoT applications like smart energy management
    [66] and smart water management [67], to assist in minimizing energy use. Other
    research consolidates on economizing energy by transferring data more efficiently
    and lessening the number of transmitted packets [68]. In [69], the focus is on
    utilizing ML to achieve energy-efficient mobility. ML techniques are revealed
    to be an intriguing option that can be used in different aspects of energy conservation
    in IoT networks if the data attributes are known. To deal with energy supply variability
    and intermittency, a deep reinforcement learning-based energy scheduling was presented
    in [70]. With the incorporation of ML algorithms to automate complex tasks and
    increase the overall system level of intelligence, UAV-based network performance
    can be significantly improved. Some of the existing works where ML algorithms
    are employed in conjunction with UAVs are summarized here. By reducing UAV’s power
    consumption, authors of [71] determine the best position to deploy airborne base
    stations to offload terrestrial base stations. UAVs are placed momentarily by
    anticipating wireless network congestion based on ML rather than being needed
    to continuously shift their placements. Through a structured radio map in [72]
    the optimal allocation for UAVs operating as airborne base stations are determined.
    The authors suggest a joint clustering and regression problem using a maximum
    likelihood strategy which is created based on the K-segment ray-tracing model
    because of the diverse terrain and difficulties in utilizing such radio maps.
    To recreate the radio map, ML is employed to predict the channel. In [73] the
    best allocation for airborne base stations utilizing UAVs is determined. Traffic
    is downloaded using weighted expectation maximization utilizing ML algorithms.
    Contract theory is also used to verify that the downlink demand is fulfilled through
    the proper selection of UAVs for each hotspot. To enable motion prediction for
    a collection of heterogeneous flying UAVs, an unsupervised method has been developed
    in [74]. The algorithm is intended to categorize the network nodes according to
    their mobility attributes in addition to forecasting the future locations of the
    UAVs. According to [75], by predicting the UAV’s location based on its previous
    locations, the communication efficiency between a UAV and a base station can be
    increased. The problem is that a UAV can experience wind perturbation when offloading
    a terrestrial base station, which might cause some offset and hence a reduction
    in capacity. The authors suggest a Recurrent Neural Network-assisted architecture
    to address this problem, in which the upcoming elevation and horizontal angles
    of the UAV concerning the base station are forecasted based on past angles. So,
    it is possible to forecast the precise location of a UAV which is moving at high
    speed. ML has been successfully integrated with UAV for energy savings [42]. 5.2
    Cloud Computing and Energy Management Although it may be advantageous to use this
    technology, it is widely known that cloud servers, which host cloud applications,
    consume a lot of energy. As a result, it is vital to limit energy exhaustion in
    cloud-based data processing by effective utilization of its resources. The authors
    of [76] presented a method for dividing an application into off-loadable and non-off-loadable
    components to reduce energy usage and execution time. This approach necessitates
    a high level of network dependability to assure the application’s functionality
    and availability. The authors developed an ant system for dynamic virtual machine
    placement in [77], which minimizes the number of active physical machines while
    also lowering the data center’s overall energy usage. Virtual machines can be
    transferred from one physical machine to another using dynamic virtual machine
    placement. As a result, security techniques should be used during relocation to
    secure sensitive data from attacks by intruders. A virtual machine placement method
    in [78] is proposed to reduce the number of active physical machines and their
    energy usage while also balancing the load amongst them. This method, however,
    uses a static virtual machine placement, which implies that once a virtual machine
    is created, it cannot be moved to another real computer. Energy-aware routing
    algorithms help to improve the network lifetime of sensor nodes as well as QoS
    even in the uneven distribution of traffic load. Co-operative relay solves the
    problem of high spectrum needs, reducing response time and allowing devices to
    consume less energy during transmission. Fig. 20 Energy management in cloud, fog
    and edge computing Full size image 5.3 Edge Computing and Energy Management Edge
    computing solutions have emerged as an appealing solution for energy management
    in IoT because it bridges the gap between low-power devices’ limited processing
    capabilities and their computational demands. Edge computing enables the workload
    to be offloaded from the cloud to a location closer to the data source to be efficiently
    handled by the users. It allows users to download data from cloud services and
    upload data to IoT devices. As a result, it can lengthen the battery life of battery-powered
    IoT devices, reducing network traffic, enhancing bandwidth, improving privacy,
    and saving significant amounts of energy and communication time. In [79], focus
    is on compressing data acquired from the edge devices before transmission. The
    proposed approach is based on an error-bounded lossy compressor that is optimized
    for high-data production scenarios where the retrieved data generates the same
    classification accuracy as the compressed data. In [80], a reinforcement-learning-based
    offloading technique is suggested for IoT devices that harvest energy. According
    to their current battery level, the past radio transmission rate of each edge
    device, and the projected amount of collected energy, IoT devices choose an edge
    device and their offloading rate. A deep reinforcement-based offloading method
    is also included in this system to help speed up learning. Fog computing is a
    layer between the cloud and the edge. Where edge computing might send large streams
    of data directly to the cloud, fog computing can receive the data from the edge
    layer before it reaches the cloud and then selectively send relevant data. A fog
    environment places intelligence at the local area network (LAN) and transmits
    data from endpoints to the gateway, where it is then transmitted to sources for
    processing and return transmission. Figure 20 shows different energy management
    techniques in cloud, fog, and edge computing. Some other recent energy management
    techniques adopted using Machine learning, Cloud and Edge Computing are discussed
    in Table 3. Table 3 Other recent energy management techniques adopted using Machine
    learning, Cloud and Edge Computing Full size table 6 GIoT Strategies Leveraging
    Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) and 5G
    Networks The adoption of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has revolutionized Agriculture
    4.0 by offering farmers major cost savings, reliable connectivity, enhanced efficiency,
    and increased profitability. In [90], UAV is regarded as a sink node in wireless
    communication to collect sensor data. In [91], low-power processing of data is
    performed using UAV. In [92], a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is applied to improve drone-assisted
    networks analyzing energy consumption and sensor density. Sensor nodes suffer
    from limited range, downtime battery constraints, communication range, storing,
    processing, and computing resources [93]. So the integration of UAVs and WSNs
    is required for energy-efficient data acquisition. Recent UAV-based energy-efficient
    approaches for greening IoT are described in Table 4. Figure 21 describes the
    reputed journal distribution of articles using UAVs for green PA. Fig. 21 Reputed
    journal distribution of articles using UAV for green PA Full size image Table

    Strategies Using UAVs and RFID for Greening of Things Diminishing tag size followed
    by energy-saving strategies are required to optimize the energy requirement of
    RFID [98]. The RFID and UAV can be combinedly employed as a powerful tools required
    to deliver service in large deployment use cases including PA applications. In
    [99] UAVs with indoor localization are done with RFID to achieve cost efficiency
    using radio-frequency shadowing. Hubbard et al. [100] has shown the enhancement
    of UAV’s battery lifetime. In [101], a feasibility analysis is done to recharge
    the multipurpose tags in UAVs for energy requirement optimization. A few recent
    works are listed in Table 5. Table 5 UAV techniques to green RFID Full size table
    6.1.1 UAV and WSN for Greening of Things In [104] \\(\\text{CO}_{2}\\) concentration
    is monitored during data collection by UAV and WSN combinedly. The authors of
    [105] utilize Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for analyzing data. UAV and WSN
    are combinedly and used for data gathering with low power [106]. UAVs are capable
    of managing duty cycling dynamically. Advantages include enhanced communication
    bandwidth, the energy required for data transmission, and an extended coverage
    area. The cooperation of WSN, UAVs, and RFID helps in energy saving, and local
    and cost-effective processing using clustering techniques and has the potential
    of making PA applications greener as shown in Fig. 22. Recent works in the above
    context are discussed in Table 6. Table 6 UAV techniques to green WSN Full size
    table Fig. 22 Energy saving of WSN and RFID using UAV Full size image 6.1.2 Review
    of UAV Applications and Key Innovations in PA Over the last few years, UAVs played
    a very important role in agriculture monitoring. It has widespread applications
    in PA including 3D crop modeling, weed management, crop yield enhancement, vegetation
    index extraction, field-level phenotyping, etc. Some of the contributions in PA
    utilizing green technology of UAV are summarized in Table 7. Table 7 Contributions
    in PA utilizing green technology of UAV Full size table Applications of UAVs in
    PA are seeing an emerging trend. Recently, UAVs in the field of PA are applied
    for soil Mapping, Geographical Information Systems, etc. Different types of UAVs
    based on technical specifications and payload are also discussed [117]. UAVs integrated
    with sensors for crop monitoring and UAV trajectories are also used for data acquisition.
    Consensus and symbolic aggregate approximation algorithms are used at the network
    level for data transmission [118]. UAV in PA is discussed in diverse fields of
    irrigation, fertilization, chemical applications, weed management, and disease
    detection [119] etc. 6.1.3 Energy Constraints in UAV and Solutions Battery constraints
    of UAVs having limited energy, the energy consumption of UAVs during data collection
    is a matter of concern. Placement of UAVs, limited flight time, path planning,
    and interference among communicating UAVs are some of the constraints in using
    UAVs [4]. Energy Harvesting (EH) is a potential direction to augment battery capacity.
    Some of the energy constraint issues and solutions of UAVs are pointed out in
    Table 8. Table 8 Energy constraints in UAV and solutions Full size table Fig.
    23 Paper distribution of LPWAN Full size image 6.2 LPWANs for GIoT Based PA Sensors
    have a limited amount of resources like memory, power, and computing [15]. LPWANs
    are designed to support GIoT applications with low power requirements while retaining
    service quality and providing long-range communications. Figure 23 shows the paper
    distribution of LPWAN technologies. Long-range communication is supported by LPWANs
    having fewer gateways and long battery life [10, 11]. Long-term monitoring is
    possible with LPWANs because it allows sensors to monitor data and then transmit
    those monitored data with minimal power consumption. LPWANs are well-suited for
    deployment in GIoT-based PA applications as these are cost-effective and energy-efficient.
    PA applications where on several occasions, it relies on uplink communication
    for long-range transmission with minimal energy usage, LoRa becomes a feasible
    choice in such a scenario. DASH7 is less preferred in PA applications where the
    communication range exceeds 2 km [10]. Sigfox and LoRa are better than NB (NarrowBand)-IoT,
    when battery life, power, and cost incurred, are considered. NB-IoT is less ideal
    in PA tasks as many farms lack Long-Term Evolution (LTE) cellular coverage which
    is expensive due to weak cellular signal [10]. NB-IoT has a poor level of interference
    immunity [11]. Table 9 shows the specification of different LPWAN techniques.
    Table 9 Specification of LPWANs Full size table It has been found that a LoRaWAN
    communication technology expands the opportunity to install a large and sophisticated
    wireless sensor network in a remote agricultural land of 10 km without being dependent
    on an LTE (4G/5G) or other backhaul networks, by increasing the communication
    range of an IoT network to over 10 km wirelessly [121]. In [122] NB-IoT is evaluated
    in the agricultural environment for field experiments. A Raspberry-based NB-IoT
    node is implemented in terrace, ground, underground and cellar conditions. In
    [123] low-cost sensor nodes are designed for Agro-intelligence IoT using LoRaWAN
    for smart farming applications. In [124] self-powered nodes are used for real-time
    soil health monitoring using LoRaWAN for effective data storage and analysis.
    In [125] a low-cost design is implemented for automated agricultural irrigation
    using both LoRa and Sigfox for the implementation of a cloud-based WSN. In [126]
    a low-cost WSN is implemented for real-time intruder detection and crop data acquisition.
    EnOcean sensors operating in energy harvesting mode and Sigfox-based data transmission
    are used for transmitting real-time agricultural data in the cloud. 6.3 Utility
    of 5G in GIoT and PA Applications To satisfy global goals of designing energy-efficient
    IoT devices, advancing towards 5G cellular systems is a solution for ubiquitous
    connectivity. 5G networks are a highly energy-saving alternative to existing communication
    networks. In [127], a frame structure is proposed for physical layer radio frame
    flexibly to specifically target IoT implementation for \\(5\\text{th}\\) generation
    (5G) networks choosing appropriate Guard Bands for Random Access Channels. It
    supports enormous connections along with bursty and small packet transmissions
    while meeting low-cost, low power, and low complexity operation requirements of
    GIoT. The proposed design is effective for handling transceiver distortions, cell
    implementation, inter-band, and inter-cell interference shown through simulation
    results. 5G can accommodate different transmission speeds, bandwidths, and service
    quality needs. It consists of massive IoT connectivity, improved mobile broadband,
    and vital communications. The 3GPP has improved the design of 5G networks in a
    variety of ways. Reduced transmission delays will result from faster response
    times and improved reliability. Low latency connectivity is essential for communicating
    devices in PA that performs critical tasks based on real-time sensor-generated
    data. For efficient PA applications, a private network can be used that consists
    of independent spectrum options including dedicated, shared, and unlicensed frequency
    bands to support diverse spectrum requirements of IoT applications that allow
    the saving of network resources by allowing network slices assigned for specific
    functions. Network slicing also assures higher security and reliability of data
    transmission. Low latency, high bandwidth connections support of 5G networks results
    in QoS improvement during real-time transmission of a massive volume of data [128,
    129]. Also, the cost per bit of data transmission is reduced to enhance the economic
    feasibility of the 5G network.5G can be used to provide home access to the internet
    using wireless technologies instead of depending on fixed lines as broadband is
    not available through fixed-line operators, especially in remote and rural areas.
    QoS benefits include data communication speeds with reduced cost per bit of data
    transmitted using broadband. 5G networks connect households in rural areas with
    add-on advantages of capacity bandwidth and higher speeds to support massive IoT
    interconnections. Energy harvesting and power management of different power-hungry
    IoT devices in the 5G era need special attention. In [29] UAV-based 5G design
    is implemented using ML algorithms that improve service delivery using multiple
    antennas. In [28] data aggregation in UAV networks is done to reduce the energy
    requirement of power-hungry IoT components. In [130] reliable link selection is
    done to transmit information with reduced co-channel interference, increasing
    Signal to Noise for energy efficiency. In [131] a clustering algorithm is proposed
    where a cluster is formed based on the signal strength received to minimize energy
    consumption. In [132] to overcome the underutilized spectrum and constrained battery
    capacity in GIoT devices, energy harvesting for judicious use of resources is
    utilized. In [18] energy management is done by reducing sensor data transmission
    with increased fault tolerance, reduced energy consumption, and improved device
    failure rate. In [133] adaptive network coding is used to boost transmission efficiency.
    In [38] Three-tier architecture is proposed to reduce energy requirements and
    signaling overhead. The 5G network’s IoT-based solution allows the automated operation
    of various unmanned agricultural devices during plowing, planting, and all the
    growth stages of the crop, resulting in environment-friendly and energy-efficient
    farming operations. Data analytics in PA applications consists of a set of methodologies
    that focuses on gaining actionable insights from a large volume of data [128].
    So, it has a high bandwidth requirement, minimal delay, and maximized throughput.
    Figure 24 shows the benefits of adopting 5G networks in PA for shifting towards
    Agriculture 5.0. In PA, the adoption of 5G networks provides energy efficiency
    and ultralow latency to maximize throughput and reduce downtime of communicating
    devices for gaining higher reliability in data transmission. The data transmission
    speed can be increased during Interactive Augmented and Virtual Reality applications
    with reduced delay from multiple data transmission sources using virtual consultation
    and predictive maintenance services. AI-driven robots can also be utilized to
    achieve data transmission with reduced delay. For real-time monitoring, Machine-type
    communications with long-term evolution and narrowband IoT are paving the way
    for 5G integration in the future. It is used to connect numerous sensors to a
    single cellular tower, allowing farmers to set up more IoT devices to perform
    multiple tasks proficiently. Wearable glasses and smartphones can provide useful
    information about crop, animal, and machinery statistics, weather updates, AI-powered
    disease identification for both plants and cattle, insect exposure, land assessment,
    and so on to implement Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality [134]. In [135] AI-powered
    robots are programmed for using Global Positioning System to plot a route and
    recognize fruits and vegetables that are ripe to harvest. Fig. 24 Adoption of
    5G networks for shifting towards Agriculture 5.0 Full size image 6.3.1 Energy
    Management in 5G IoT Several studies in the literature have emphasized the necessity
    of energy efficiency in 5G networks. In [136] a comprehensive survey is done on
    energy-efficient cellular networks and a spectrum-sharing solution is designed
    for IoT networks with long battery life. In [137] an overview of energy-efficient
    strategies for 5G networks is delivered including resource allocation, network
    planning, network implementation, and hardware solutions. An integrating and energy-efficient
    system model for 5G-IoT is proposed in [138] that utilizes a massive Multiple-Input
    and Multiple-Output (MIMO) scheme to substitute the single remote antenna and
    the Cellular Partition Zooming (CPZ) mechanism for reducing the distance between
    the communicating components and the number of routing devices. 6.4 Implementation
    of GIoT in Beyond 5G Networks Beyond 5G/6G Networks are already seeing an emerging
    trend to make IoT designs greener with low power consumption, and energy harvesting
    strategies. Phase shifting the reflector and using iterative beamforming to lower
    the access point transmission power is a new Intelligent reflector surface and
    Ambient Backscatter communication joint design approach stated in [139]. The NOMA
    strategy is used in conjunction with simultaneous wireless information and power
    transmission technique that allow relays to harvest energy from radio signals
    while also enhancing the sum rate of each IoT device as stated in [140]. For 6G-enabled
    IoT devices, in [36] a cluster-based green communication strategy is proposed.
    A hybrid whale-spotted hyena optimization algorithm is used to guarantee the energy-efficient
    operation of IoT networks which limits the use of a single device as a cluster
    head, decreases the complexity of cluster selection, and prolongs network life.
    Table 10 describes other recent GIoT strategies adopted leveraging UAV, LPWANs
    and 5G networks. Fig. 25 Proposed GIoT layered framework for energy-aware PA Full
    size image Table 10 Other recent GIoT strategies adopted leveraging UAV, LPWANs
    and 5G networks in GIoT Full size table 7 Proposed GIoT Framework for Energy-Aware
    PA Applications To reduce the environmental impacts of hazardous emissions from
    IoT components, a low-cost, low-energy-consuming framework of GIoT for energy-aware
    PA applications is proposed using ML for intelligent decision-making, as shown
    in Fig. 25. To address power consumption, operational cost management, and minimizing
    environmental degradation from millions of interconnected IoT devices, the suggested
    conceptual framework is divided into five layers which are described as follows:
    The green perception layer does self-organized sensing and load balancing where
    parameters are extracted from weather, soil, crops, etc. The sensor operates using
    dynamic sleep/wake-up, energy harvesting to extract power from renewable sources,
    radio optimization, and energy-efficient routing to minimize energy usage [41,
    44]. The green transport layer is used for data processing. Passive RFID Tags
    that are biodegradable must be used in the green transport layer to optimize tag
    estimation adjust dynamic power levels and prevent tag collision as well as overhearing
    problems [6, 44]. Dynamic power adjustment can be attained using green M2M communication
    and energy harvesting is required for dynamic resource allocation [44, 41, 45].
    The green processing layer is responsible for evaluating, processing, and allocating
    resources for data storage [44]. In the green processing layer, processing and
    analysis of data can be done using ML techniques for predictive decisions and
    energy saving can also be achieved using ML solutions. Incorporating ML at the
    network’s edge can be used to achieve declined communication latency, enhanced
    security, and energy efficiency [150]. Edge computing in PA helps to reduce bandwidth
    and optimize latency requirements by sending data to the network’s edge to reduce
    network overloading while retaining flexibility and QoS enhancements [151]. In
    addition, the edge computing nodes provide adequate computational capability and
    low data transmission time. After these data have been processed in the green
    processing layer, these data are communicated to devices at various levels as
    part of a full system model in the green network layer. GCC using virtual machine
    (VM) techniques such as VM consolidation, placement, allocation, and migration
    can be applied in PA to ensure energy efficiency [44, 47]. GDC uses dynamic power
    allocation and energy-aware routing strategies in PA [44]. GICT uses compressive
    sensing, data fusion, cooperative relaying, dynamic topology management as well
    as duty cycling as an energy-efficient metric to extend the battery life of IoT
    components [44, 152]. In the green application layer, data can be obtained after
    being processed in all the layers in the form of readymade applications in PA.
    Table 11 shows the layered architecture of GIoT components to furnish green alternatives
    for power-hungry IoT enablers. While wake-up radio is a non-demand ON/OFF scheduling
    scheme, duty cycling can be on-demand and asynchronous. As a result, wake-up radio
    systems can help to limit the amount of idle hearing and overhearing that duty-cycling
    can cause. But, wake-up radio systems have a restricted communication range and
    incur a high cost as well as there is a possibility for severe interference. Duty-cycling
    can also suffer from high sleep latency and data transmission latency, in addition
    to idle hearing and overhearing. Energy-efficient data collection systems are
    effective methods for lowering IoT energy consumption. Security and latency tribulations
    for data aggregation as well as the barely obtainable data sparsity in data compression
    are still issues that are required to be addressed. Here, MQTT and CoAP stand
    for Message Queuing Telemetry Transport and Constrained Application protocol.
    Table 11 Layered architecture of GIoT components Full size table 8 Security Issues
    in GIoT and Solutions Virtualization of workstations and data abstraction from
    a common physical server is used to build cloud-based IoT services. As a result,
    there is a risk of data theft when a VM communicates with its neighbors. SQL injection,
    malware injection, and man-in-the-middle attacks are all the vulnerable security
    threats to which cloud data are exposed [154]. Furthermore, Blockchain technology
    has recently emerged as a means of connecting billions of devices on IoT networks.
    Blockchain creates a secure mesh network that allows devices to communicate reliably,
    avoiding the risks associated with centralized servers. As the network grows in
    size and the number of devices increases, traditional computing techniques have
    a direct impact on overall energy consumption. In addition to other obstacles
    such as scalability, latency, energy consumption, and flexibility issues, traditional
    computing techniques poses privacy and trust concerns. The sensors used to sense
    environmental parameters in an open agriculture field are very vulnerable to security
    threats as the sensors cannot be monitored regularly. Also, the area where sensors
    are located is not monitored properly compared to the sensors deployed inside
    a metropolitan city and it is simple to add malicious nodes that can overhear
    the information exchanged or impose security threats like [35]. Vulnerabilities
    and weaknesses in applications, interfaces, network parts, and software designs
    pose several security concerns for which user access is limited by allowing authorized
    access only [155]. To combat security risks, effective encryption techniques,
    Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) [156] and secure authentication schemes are
    required to be implemented. As a result, it might be stated that enhancing security
    strategies are essential such as trust management, communication security, communication
    privacy, and application security. Different security attacks specific to different
    layers of GIoT-based systems are shown in Fig. 26. Fig. 26 Security attacks on
    different layers of GIoT based systems Full size image 8.1 Attacks in Device Layer
    Different security attacks in Device Layer of GIoT based systems are as follows:
    (i) Booting Attacks: The built-in security features of a device are not used during
    the booting process, the intruder tries to invade the communicating device while
    it is rebooting [157]. (ii) Eavesdropping: The intruder gets access over a conversation
    happening between unprotected devices or networks and the information is stolen
    when sent or received for malicious activities. (iii) Sleep Deprivation Attacks:
    The intruder tries to consume all the available power of IoT devices through infinite
    looping or mischievously maximizes the power consumption to reduce IoT device
    lifetime resulting in denial of services due to power exhaustion of these IoT
    devices [158]. (iv) Malicious Code Injection: The intruder injects malicious codes
    into the memory of IoT devices to achieve control over the entire system that
    causes system malfunctioning [159]. 8.2 Attacks in Communication Layer Different
    security attacks in Communication Layer of GIoT based systems are as follows:
    (i) Man-in-the-Middle Attack: The intruder secretly listens to the conversation
    between two parties and gain access over the real-time data traffic [160]. (ii)
    Routing Attack: The intruder attempts to change the transmission path of the data
    transit. A sinkhole attack is a routing attack in which the attacker broadcasts
    a fake transmission path to the nodes to re-route their traffic through it to
    cause various DoS attacks [161]. (iii) Phishing Site Attack: The intruder sends
    deceitful communications to different users, which appears to be valid messages
    and somehow the user id and password are retrieved with minimum effort to attack
    the hacked IoT devices [162]. (iv) Dos Attack: The intruder floods the network
    with unnecessary traffic to make the device fail to respond to genuine user requests.
    Due to the dissimilar configurations of the IoT devices, DoS attack occurs [163].
    8.3 Attacks in Data Analytics Layer Different security attacks in Data Analytics
    Layer of GIoT based systems are as follows: (i) Signature Wrapping attack: Here
    the signature algorithm is altered by the intruder to retrieve the resources and
    alter its information [164]. (ii) Malware Injection and Flooding: Here the attacker
    transfuse malicious code or even a virtual machine onto the cloud to gain right
    to use user’s sensitive information to degrade its quality [165]. (iii) SQL Injection
    Attack: The intruder transfuse malicious codes into the system to retrieve all
    the information about the system to achieve control [166]. 8.4 Application Layer
    Different security attacks in Application Layer of GIoT based systems are as follows:
    (i) Secure onboarding: When a new sensor is used in the network it passes the
    encryption key through the gateways which are vulnerable to various security attacks.
    Then the intruder can crack through the system using the encryption keys [167].
    (ii) Malicious Code Attack: The intruder utilizes cross-site scripting to get
    into the system which results in corrupting and malfunctioning of the entire IoT
    system [168]. (iii) Reprogram Attacks: Here the intruder can change the device
    configurations if it is not protected sufficiently and can induce very harmful
    damages [169]. (iv) Data Thefts: When data is sent over the network there are
    greater likelihoods of data theft. A single fault in the system may cause the
    failure of the entire system [170]. Physical security design, authentication,
    and access control are the security measures to be adopted in the device layer.
    Identity management, secure routing protocols, and encryption can be used in the
    communication layer as security measures. Cloud security, secure identification,
    and anti-virus are the security measures to be adopted in the data analytics layer
    as security measures. Authentication encryption, security protocols, and privacy
    management can be used in the application layer as security measures. Intrusions
    are detected and implemented using several authentication and access control mechanisms
    like encryption mechanisms to protect systems against cyber attacks. Using data
    mining and machine learning approaches, it is possible to differentiate between
    normal and malicious attacks. The intrusion detection for GIoT-based PA as a software
    application will able to reveal different security threats posed to the GIoT systems
    [35]. The resource and energy-constrained IoT devices are not always able to meet
    the computational and power requirement needed in the processing of different
    encryption/decryption techniques and cryptographic solutions at the Device layer.
    Therefore, the design of compatible cryptographic protocols is a significant research
    opportunity for the implementation of GIoT-based PA applications. 9 Conclusion
    Various Agriculture 4.0 strategies such as IoT-driven PA, UAVs, and big data analytics
    are remarkably advantageous given the growing food needs of the rising global
    population and diminishing agricultural land. With the rising number of IoT interconnections
    in PA applications, energy requirement issues of power-hungry IoT components like
    sensors, RFID tags, etc. are also increasing. Furthermore, equipped with the power
    of automation in real-time data acquisition and seamless connectivity in PA tasks,
    IoT components directly or indirectly generate Green House Gases and causes energy
    depletion. So, adopting green designs of GIoT is inevitable to promote energy-conserving,
    environment-friendly, and cost-effective IoT component designs. This work comprehensively
    reviews the most recent utilities of GIoT in PA applications such as energy-efficient
    irrigation monitoring based on commonly observed environment parameters like non-linear
    changes in soil, weather, and crop data. To resolve the energy consumption problem
    of existing IoT technology enablers, the plethora of GIoT enablers like GRFID,
    GWSN, GCN, GDC, and GCC are reviewed in detail for meeting the GIoT design goals
    of energy-efficient, environment-friendly, and cost-effective component designs.
    The overview of different data processing and energy-conserving strategies using
    machine learning, cloud computing, and edge computing is extensively reviewed.
    Further, energy-saving approaches leveraging 5G networks, UAV technologies, and
    LPWANs are presented along with their pros and cons to realize the true potential
    of GIoT. The main goal of this detailed review work is to conceptualize a GIoT
    framework for designing an energy-efficient, cost-effective, and environment-friendly
    PA application utilizing GIoT components for realizing the paradigm shift from
    IoT to GIoT while enabling ubiquitous connectivity in PA. Besides, different security
    threats in each layer of GIoT networks and the measures that can be adopted to
    mitigate those threats are also reviewed. In the future, it is important to identify
    the security loopholes in designing GIoT devices to ensure security amongst heterogeneous
    energy-efficient communicating devices. Also, to leverage the full potential of
    UAV (for UAV flying to long distances and for long duration) in GIoT-based PA
    applications, it is crucial to design an efficient power distributed algorithm
    for real-time data processing, finding suitable techniques for efficient batteries,
    increased battery lifetime and energy harvesting. Besides every other aspect,
    this paper analyzes why GIoT-based techniques need to be adopted to ensure sustainable
    progress towards Agriculture 5.0 leveraging UAVs, LPWANs, and 5G network designs
    in PA with optimized energy-saving and minimized ecological impacts of IoT components
    while ensuring QoS and cost-effectiveness. Data Availibility Data sharing not

    neural networksphysicochemical propertiesnondestructive estimation Introduction
    Nondestructive estimation of the internal properties of agricultural produce such
    as fruits (Pan et al., 2019), vegetables (Babellahi et al., 2020), grains (Erkinbaev
    et al., 2017), and meats (Chaudhry et al., 2021) is one of the most important
    challenges for researchers worldwide. Unlike nondestructive methodologies, destructive
    methods are generally labor-intensive, time-consuming, unsuitable for online grading
    and sizing, and require specialized sample preparation (Arendse et al., 2017;
    Guthrie et al., 2005; Magwaza et al., 2013; Peiris et al., 1999). With increasing
    consumer demand for high-quality produce, the food industry is in dire need of
    fast and cost-effective tools to automate the grading and sorting of agricultural
    commodities. Several nondestructive methods have been used to estimate the internal
    and external characteristics of agricultural products such as machine vision (Cardenas-Perez
    et al., 2017), near-infrared (NIR), and visible/short wavelength infrared (Vis/SWIR)
    spectroscopy (Mendoza et al., 2014; Nicolaï et al., 2007; Wang & Paliwal, 2006),
    Raman spectroscopy (Nadimi et al., 2021), multispectral and hyperspectral imaging
    (Choudhary et al., 2009; Erkinbaev et al., 2017, 2022; Lu, 2004, 2007; Mahesh
    et al., 2015; Nadimi et al., 2021), X-ray imaging (Li et al., 2022; Nadimi et
    al., 2022), and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (Marcone et al., 2013; Zhang
    and McCarthy, 2013). For instance, Vis-NIR spectroscopy was used by several scholars
    for assessing apples’ internal properties and/or ripening levels. Sharabiani et
    al. ( 2020) successfully estimated TA and taste index of gala apples. In another
    work, Sharabiani et al. ( 2021) reliably estimated gala apples’ total soluble
    solids and BrimA. Pourdarbani et al. ( 2021) successfully identified Fuji apples’
    firmness, acidity, and starch content. Very recently, Pourdarbani et al. ( 2022)
    accurately predicted pH and TA of Fuji apples. Moreover, color features and spectral
    data in Vis-NIR range were used by Pourdarbani et al. ( 2020c), Pourdarbani et
    al. ( 2020b) to assess different ripening stages of Fuji apples. The reported
    results showed that both spectral and color data have the potential to accurately
    determine the maturation levels of Fuji apples. In another work, color features
    and/or spectral data in Vis-NIR range were used to successfully predict the total
    chlorophyll content of Fuji Apple (Pourdarbani et al., 2020a). The results evidenced
    that the aforementioned chemical property could be estimated using an ordinary
    camera. The lower system cost is the primary motivation for implementing color
    imaging techniques instead of spectroscopy methods to evaluate fruits’ ripening
    level and/or physicochemical properties. In another relevant study, Cardenas-Perez
    et al. ( 2017) characterized the ripening level of Golden Delicious apples using
    a computer vision system. Three ripening levels of apples were characterized by
    CIE-lab color space, chroma, and hue angle. Strong correlations were observed
    between a ripening index (RPI) (derived from physicochemical parameters such as
    TA, SSC and firmness values) and the majority of color properties. Using multivariate
    discriminant analysis (MDA) over four color parameters, 100% correct classification
    rate (CCR) was achieved for predicting the ripening levels of Golden Delicious
    apples. The authors concluded that color information could be utilized in lieu
    of physicochemical analysis for ripening determination. Similar laboratory level
    studies have also been conducted for other fruits such as mango (Vélez-Rivera
    et al., 2014) and Medlar (Zandi et al., 2020). One should note that applying color
    imagining algorithms is much simpler in the standard/laboratory environment than
    in the field. In the latter case, light intensity continuously varies throughout
    the day, and weather conditions may also change from sunny to cloudy, affecting
    image quality (Sabzi et al., 2018a). Ultimately, the developed models should be
    applied in the real-world environment where remarkable lighting variations exist.
    One of the key challenges in model development for outdoor orchard environments
    is appropriate segmentation due to the aforementioned complexities. Indeed, previous
    studies outlined reliable segmentation algorithms for apple quality monitoring
    in orchard environments, which can be followed to overcome segmentation challenges
    (Sabzi et al., 2018a). Furthermore, it should be noted that while specific internal
    properties (such as TA, SSC and firmness values) and external appearance of certain
    fruits (such as apple (Cardenas-Perez et al., 2017) and mango (Vélez-Rivera et
    al., 2014)) change drastically at different ripening levels, other fruits may
    not exhibit similar trends. In those cases, more involved techniques such as spectroscopy,
    biochemical assays, and electronic nose have been researched for quality evaluation
    (Beghi et al., 2017). In the case of apples, a substantial modification in physicochemical
    properties (such as TA, SSC and firmness values) and external appearance over
    maturation have been reported (Cardenas-Perez et al., 2017). However, previous
    work in this area has been limited to studies conducted in artificially controlled
    lab environments (Cardenas-Perez et al., 2017) and/or solely focused on evaluating
    ripening level (Sabzi et al., 2019a). There is a need to develop practically feasible
    techniques in a natural orchard setting where environmental conditions vary continuously.
    To this end, the present study was formulated to investigate the feasibility of
    using a computer vision system in orchard environments to (i) predict five physicochemical
    properties (i.e. firmness, SSC, starch, acidity, and TA) of Red Delicious apples
    with different maturity states; and (ii) to classify the apples into four levels
    of ripeness (i.e. unripe, semi-ripe, ripe, and overripe). Moreover, unlike the
    majority of previous imaging-based computer vision systems, a video processing
    algorithm was utilized in the present work. Implementing video processing provides
    more flexibility in data collection during fruits growth and development and facilitates
    applying the developed knowledge over large fields using state-of-the-art tools
    such as drones and/or robots. Furthermore, video-based imaging can provide beneficial
    information for efficient real-time resource management in the fields through
    variable-rate technologies. Materials and Methods Figure 1 shows the various steps
    of the proposed machine vision algorithm to estimate the ripeness levels of Red
    Delicious apples in orchard environments, which will be discussed in detail next.

    Acquisition and Segmentation Videos of apples (cultivar Red Delicious) on trees
    were acquired under natural light in five orchards in Kermanshah–Iran (34°18ʹ48.87”N,
    47°4ʹ6.92”E) using a digital camera (DFK 23GM021, 120 f/s CMOS, Imaging Source
    GmbH, Germany). The video files were converted into frames using a program code
    in MATLAB and Statistics Toolbox (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA). A laptop (Intel
    Core i3, 2.13 GHz, 4GB RAM, Windows 10) equipped with MATLAB 2016b was used to
    process the video frames. Figure 2 illustrates each of the four ripening levels
    on the tree branch. Figure 2. Apple samples at different levels of ripening. (a):

    to extract useful information by eliminating the background, noise, and undesired
    components. Figure 3 shows four sample frames of Red Delicious apples in the garden.

    include trunks of trees, green and sick leaves, other flowers and plants, tree
    branches, and sky. Ground reference for each of the four ripeness levels was established
    by a panel of trained inspectors. Figure 3. Four sample images of orchards of
    apple cultivar Red Delicious. Display full size A successful segmentation algorithm
    for apples previously developed by Sabzi et al. ( 2018a) was adapted. To overcome
    the background complexity of the video frames and to remove background, noise,
    and undesired components, a combination of color thresholding method, texture
    method, and intensity conversion method was applied (Sabzi et al., 2018a, 2019a,
    2019b). A total of 1500 apples were imaged for model development. The frames were
    initially converted into LUV color space, and a simple threshold ensured the removal
    of green leaves and other components with a pixel value greater than 95. Next,
    the image was converted to grayscale and the texture features of the local standard
    deviation were applied. Another part of the background was deleted upon further
    binarization and thresholding. The image was again converted to grayscale, and
    the pixel intensity range was changed from 0–1 to 0–0.4. Since image pixel values
    were stored as 8-bit unsigned integers, these values were multiplied by 225. In
    the next step, image segmentation was done and pixels with values greater than
    75 were considered as background and removed. In the final segmentation step,
    92 different color thresholds in RGB color space were applied to further discriminate
    between the background and the desired object according to the algorithm developed
    by Sabzi et al. ( 2018a). The applied segmentation algorithm could eliminate the
    background, noise, and undesired components to extract the objects of interest.
    Thereafter, the performance of the segmentation algorithm (SA) was analyzed according
    to three criteria of sensitivity, specificity, and CCR, which are expressed in
    equations 1 to 3. Sensitivity measures the correct classification of the samples
    within a class; specificity is the ability to correctly identify other class samples
    (background objects) in the studied class; and CCR is defined as the percentage
    of correctly identified samples across all classes. Sensitivity is calculated
    as such: S e n s i t i v i t y = T P T P + F N (1) Specificity is calculated as
    such: S p e c i f i c i t y = T N F P + T N (2) Correct Classification Rate is
    calculated as such: C C R = T P + T N T P + T N + F P + F N (3) where TP (true
    positive) is the number of samples correctly classified in each class, TN (true
    negative) is the incidence of not identifying the samples when the class is not
    apple, FP (false positive) represents the incorrect identification of apple when
    the class is not apple, and FN (false negative) is the incorrect identification
    of apple when the class is apple (Wisaeng, 2013). Extraction of Color and Texture
    Features Previous studies have reported the successful implementation of various
    color spaces and/or texture features in combination with hybrid artificial neural
    networks for evaluating the ripening levels of apples (Sabzi et al., 2019a) and
    pH values of oranges (Sabzi et al., 2020a). Herein, we followed an analogous approach
    and extracted various color and texture features from each sample to identify
    physicochemical characteristics and maturity levels of apples. Sixteen different
    color spaces were included in color feature extraction viz. RGB, HSV, YIQ, YCbCr,
    CMY, Improved YCbCr, L* a* b*, JPEG-YCbCr, YDbDr, YPbPr, YUV, HSL, XYZ, LUV, LCH,
    and CAT02 LMS. The detailed definition of the aforementioned color spaces can
    be found elsewhere (Chaves-González et al., 2010; García-Mateos et al., 2015;
    Kahu et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2015). Two groups of color features were extracted
    from each color space, including features corresponding to mean and standard deviation
    (MSD), and features corresponding to vegetation indices (VI) (Sabzi et al., 2019a,
    2020a). Seven MSD features from each color space were obtained, including the
    mean and standard deviation of the three individual components and mean of all
    three components (Table 1). Thus, a total of 7 × 16 = 112 features were extracted.
    Additionally, 14 features were extracted from VI in each color space. Table 2
    shows the VI in RGB color space. VI features add up to 14 × 16 = 224 in all 16
    color spaces. Overall, 112 + 224 = 336 color features were extracted from each
    sample. Table 1. MSD features from various color spaces. Download CSVDisplay Table
    Table 2. Properties of the vegetation indices (VI) examined in RGB color space.
    Display Table For texture features extraction, 27 features were calculated from
    samples’ gray level co-occurrence matrix (Table 3). Features were extracted at
    0°, 45°, 90°, and 135° for each sample resulting in 27 × 4 = 108 texture features
    in total. Overall, 336 (color)+108 (texture) = 444 features were extracted from
    each sample. Table 3. Texture features extracted based on the gray level co-occurrence
    matrices of apples. Download CSVDisplay Table Experimental Measurement of Physicochemical
    Properties Fifteen apples at each ripening level were randomly selected (15*4
    = 60 samples in total) and experimentally analyzed to identify apples’ reference
    physicochemical properties (firmness, SSC, starch, acidity, and TA) at each maturity
    level. The collected data were later used for developing nondestructive physicochemical
    and ripeness predictive models. The apple firmness was measured using the Fruit
    and Vegetable Ripeness/Hardness Tester (HFH80 Series, OMEGA Engineering, Norwalk,
    CT) equipped with a cylindrical probe (11 mm diameter and 8 mm height). The device
    was calibrated as per the manufacturers’ recommendation and the firmness values
    were measured at a uniform penetration speed of 5 mm/s. A portable refractometer
    (RF18, Extech Instruments, Waltham, MA) was used to measure SSC of the samples
    in terms of percentage of degrees brix. One-degree brix is defined as 1 g of sugar
    in 100 g of solution expressed as percentage by mass. To measure the starch content,
    the precipitate was dissolved in a mixture of dimethyl sulfoxide/hydrochloric
    acid (4:1) and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 minutes. Iodine chloride reagent
    was prepared by dissolving 0.6 g of potassium iodide in 100 mL of 0.05 N hydrochloric
    acid. 0.5 mL of iodine (yellow reagent) and 0.5 mL of herbal extract were mixed
    thoroughly in a small plastic tube. After 15 minutes, the absorbance of the resulting
    solution was read by a spectrophotometer (Optizen 2120 UV plus, Company: Mecasys
    Co., Ltd., Korea) at 600 nm and the results were expressed in mg/g of fresh weight.
    Next, the standard starch solution was prepared with varying concentrations of
    starch (0 to 100 mg/L). Finally, data plotted between the absorbance of the standards
    and the starch concentration in g/mL showed a linear fit and starch concentration
    was determined accordingly. The acidity of the juice was measured using a pH meter
    (AZ-8689, Taiwan). To measure TA, 5 mL of fruit extract was diluted with 40 mL
    of distilled water. The pH of the mixture was adjusted to 8.2 with the addition
    of 5 N NaOH. TA was calculated using equation 4 . T A % = N × M × V b V s × n
    × 10 (4) where Vb = consumption volume (mL) N = normalized NaOH (0.5 mol/L) M
    = molecular weight (134 g/mol for malic acid) Vs = fruit juice volume (mL) n =
    number of carboxylic acid groups. After measuring the five physicochemical properties,
    analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to explore the statistical differences between
    properties at four different ripeness levels. Moreover, Tukey and Sheffes’ methods
    were used as posthoc tests. Selection of Optimal Features The 444 color and texture
    features previously extracted, needed to be curtailed to remove redundant features,
    reduce computational time, and improve model performance. Statistical procedures
    such as Gamma test and Artificial Intelligence-based methods are typically used
    to select effective features (Wang and Paliwal, 2006). In this paper, the ANN-DE
    algorithm was chosen to determine the optimal features (Storn and Price, 1996).
    ANN-DE includes two main steps of initialization and evolution. With no initial
    information, a random population is used to optimize the problem, which is then
    recombined through mutation, and the selection process continues until optimization
    is finalized. The extracted features are considered as a vector. Different sized
    input vectors (based on a different number of extracted color and texture features)
    were sent to the multilayered perceptron artificial neural network (MPANN) to
    predict the properties of firmness, SSC, starch, acidity, and TA that were experimentally
    measured. The data (from 60 samples) was divided into three categories of training
    (70%), validation (15%), and testing (15%). Finally, the mean squared error (MSE)
    of each vector was recorded and the vector with the minimum MSE was chosen (Sabzi
    et al., 2020a). Table 4 shows the values of the parameters of the multilayer perceptron
    neural network used in this section. Table 4. Values of the multilayer perceptron
    neural network parameters of the hidden layer. Download CSVDisplay Table Prediction
    Model for Physicochemical Properties The optimum features chosen in the previous
    section were used as inputs for the ANN-CA algorithm to tune the parameters of
    MPANN and further optimize the prediction of the physicochemical properties. The
    cultural algorithm considers the cultural evolution and the impact of cultural
    and social space to determine the optimal parameters of the MPANN (Ali et al.,
    2016). This network has five adjustable parameters, namely the number of neurons,
    the number of layers, the transfer function, backpropagation network training
    function, and backpropagation weight/bias learning function. If the parameters
    have optimal values, the neural network will yield the highest performance. The
    cultural algorithm sends a vector form of the parameters to the MPANN and the
    modeling results are recorded in terms of the mean squared error. The data (from
    60 samples) was divided into three groups of training (70%), validation (15%)
    and testing (15%). The vector with the minimum MSE was selected as optimal and
    its members were selected as optimal values of the adjustable parameters of the
    MPANN. In order to check the reliability of the physicochemical predictor, the
    model operation was evaluated using regression coefficient (R), and coefficient
    of determination (R2) for 100 iterations. Each iteration involved physicochemical
    prediction under different combinations of training, validation, and testing sets
    (from the original data of 60 apples). Classification Model for Ripeness Levels
    In this phase, the output of the ANN-CA hybrid classifier that predicted the physicochemical
    properties was assigned as inputs to ANN-HS algorithm classifier. The harmonic
    search algorithm is a meta-heuristic algorithm that works similarly to the cultural
    algorithm to optimize the identification of the ripeness level. The objective
    function predicted the values of the assigned variables (Lee and Geem, 2005) and
    classified the apples into four levels of unripe, semi-ripe, ripe, and overripe,
    based on their physicochemical properties (see (Sabzi et al., 2018b, 2020b) for
    more detail). After identifying the optimum classifier model (from 60 apples),
    the reliability of the recommended classifier was tested over 100 iterations.
    Each iteration involved ripeness levels classifications under different combinations
    of training, validation, and testing sets (from the original data of 60 apples).
    In the last step, the performance of the developed machine vision system was examined
    in the orchard environments and the ripeness levels of 1356 apples were estimated.
    Results and Discussion Segmentation Algorithm Figure 4 shows the result of applying
    SA on two different video frames. Even with a complex background, our SA was able
    to detect the target object (apples) while removing other objects from the background.
    The SA incorrectly categorized only 19 apples as background out of 1519 objects
    that were identified as apple samples (Table 5). It misclassified only 11 samples
    out of the 2380 background-related objects in the apple class. Therefore, SA achieved
    a CCR of 99.23%. Overall, the segmentation algorithm performed well in identifying
    apples as it reached a sensitivity, specificity, and CCR of over 98% (Table 6).

    Statistical Analysis of Experimentally Measured Physicochemical Properties The
    analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed significant differences among the four ripeness
    levels of apples for which the physicochemical properties were experimentally
    measured (Table 7). Moreover, posthoc tests showed significant differences at
    all ripeness levels for all physicochemical properties clearly establishing that
    our subset of 60 apples chosen for physicochemical properties determination was
    sufficient to represent each ripening level. Figure 5 displays the average values
    of the experimentally measured physicochemical properties at each ripeness level.
    A clear increase or decrease in mean values of starch, TA, and SSC was observed
    with the increase in ripeness. However, uneven trends were found for the acidity
    and firmness values. Table 7. Analysis of variance of physicochemical properties

    of 135 adjacency degree, the difference between the second additional component
    of the YCbCr color space and the first additional component of the YCbCr color
    space, the first additional component of the CAT02LMS color space, and the normalized
    second component of YCbCr color space. Prediction of Physicochemical Properties
    Table 8 lists the optimal values of the ANN parameters that were determined using
    the cultural algorithm. As previously discussed, the reliability of this ANN-CA
    classifier was tested over 100 different iterations for each of the physicochemical
    properties. Therefore, 100 regression coefficients and coefficients of determination
    were obtained for firmness, SSC, starch, acidity, and TA. Figure 6 displays the
    corresponding boxplots. The results indicate that high R (>0.96) and R2 (>0.92)
    values were obtained over the entire 500 (5 × 100) iterations, confirming the
    capability of ANN-CA algorithm to estimate the physicochemical properties of apples.
    Excluding the very few existing outliers (Figure 6), R and R2 values were above
    0.98 and 0.96, respectively, confirming the reliable operation of the developed
    model in the long run. Table 8. Parameters of the optimized multilayered perceptron

    the developed machine vision system categorized apples into four ripeness levels

    overripe levels, respectively. The system achieved an overall CCR of 97.86% with
    the highest misclassification (2.92% error) for level 1 and the lowest misclassification
    (1.37%) for level 3 (Table 10). The high CCR and low misclassification errors
    validate the operation of the system in the orchard environments. Table 10. Confusion

    sample images depicting the apple ripening levels as specified by the developed

    s whereas processing of other phases took 0.62 s. Considering the large number
    of steps (e.g., image acquisition, segmentation, background removal, and pattern
    classification) and their respective accuracies involved in such problems, direct
    comparison of the present results with other works is not possible. However, previous
    studies have also utilized nondestructive imaging methods to evaluate fruits’
    ripening and physicochemical properties. For instance, Cardenas-Perez et al. (
    2017) assessed the ripening levels of another apple variety (Golden Delicious)
    using a computer vision system at a laboratory scale. The authors identified RPI
    (using physicochemical parameters such as TA, SSC, and firmness) and categorized
    apples into three ripening level of unripe, ripe, and senescent, accordingly.
    The reported TA and SSC, and firmness had decremental, incremental and decremental
    patterns through the ripening process, respectively, which were in reasonable
    agreement with our observations. Strong correlations were obtained between RPI
    and several color parameters such as CIEL a*, b*, and h*(r = −0.949, −0.890, 0.965,
    respectively). The authors reported on 100% CCR for classifying the ripening level
    of apples using MDA (with four color parameters). In another study, Vélez-Rivera
    et al. ( 2014) implemented a computer vision system to identify the ripening levels
    of mango fruits. The relationship between mangos’ physicochemical properties (such
    as SSC, TA and firmness) and color parameters were explored. Strong correlations
    were observed between physicochemical parameters and several color parameters
    during ripening. Mangoes were classified into three levels of preclimacteric,
    climacteric, and senescence, according to their RPI index. The authors reported
    a classification rate of 90% using MDA (by implementing four color parameters).
    These studies confirm that the physicochemical characteristics of fruits influence
    their appearance through the ripening period, which is in line with the findings
    provided in our work. However, one should note that the applicability of the aforementioned
    works was only tested in a laboratory environment and without including the complexities
    relevant to orchard environments. Indeed, recently (Sabzi et al., 2019a) reported
    aerial video imaging and nondestructive classification of the ripeness levels
    of Red Delicious apples in orchards. The authors reported an average classification
    accuracy of 97.88% using color features combined with artificial neural networks
    optimized with genetic algorithm. Similarly, Pourdarbani et al. ( 2020b) demonstrated
    video estimation of four ripening stages (unripe, half-ripe, ripe, or overripe)
    of Fuji apples using color data combined with artificial neural networks-simulated
    annealing algorithm and reported on CCR of 93.27%. Compared to these works work,
    the present study included texture features in data analysis in addition to the
    color features. Furthermore, we used a different artificial neural network training
    algorithm and evaluated fruits’ various physicochemical properties in addition
    to the ripening level. Overall, the present work demonstrated the feasibility
    of evaluating apples’ physicochemical properties (for apples with different maturity
    stages) and ripening levels in orchard environments using a video-based computer
    vision algorithm. Implementation of such a low-cost nondestructive approach will
    enable farmers to remotely practice efficient resource management in the field.
    Indeed, the operation of the developed models depends on the functionality of
    the segmentation algorithm. Therefore, the performance of the segmentation model
    should be evaluated over more orchards and for different apple varieties. It should
    be noted that samples with similar ripening levels usually possess close physicochemical
    and color properties. On the other hand, samples at different ripening levels
    typically have different physicochemical and color properties. Hence, developing
    a predictive physicochemical model from color parameters among various ripening
    levels would be possible. Our results confirm such feasibility. However, calibration
    development for the exact prediction of physicochemical properties of apples within
    a single ripening level is more challenging and requires more extensive physicochemical
    data acquisition. This was beyond the scope of the present work and is a topic
    for future research. Conclusion A nondestructive approach was developed to estimate
    the physicochemical properties and ripeness levels of Red Delicious apples in
    orchard environments using artificial intelligence and a video processing algorithm.
    Videos of apples with four levels of ripeness were acquired. Due to the complexity
    of orchard environments, successful segmentation of the video frames required
    a combination of color threshold (LUV color space), texture, and intensity conversion
    methods. For a subset of orchards’ apples, five physicochemical properties, viz.
    firmness, starch, acidity, SSC and TA, were experimentally measured at each ripening
    level. Significant differences were found in the physicochemical properties at
    different ripening levels. Processing video frames led to identifying six optimum
    color and texture features (through the implementation of ANN-based algorithms)
    to reliably predict the measured physicochemical properties. The predicted physicochemical
    properties were then used to predict apples’ ripening levels. The ultimate developed
    machine vision system was tested across five orchards to detect apples’ ripening
    levels. A promising CCR of 97.86% was achieved, confirming the reliable operation
    of the developed models. However, further research is required to train the algorithm
    with different apple cultivars and fabricate a field-scale prototype. Such models
    can be integrated into harvesting robots and/or drones to facilitate efficient
    real-time resource management in the fields. Data Availability Statement The data

- analysis: 'This paper focuses on improving the accuracy of predicting crop harvest
    using a combination of vector distance analysis and multi-linear regression. While
    it is relevant to the topic of data volume, frequency, format, and source, its
    scope is limited to the data preprocessing and prediction stages of the automated
    irrigation management pipeline.


    The paper introduces the concept of ''Single Prediction Algorithm'' for pruning
    unwanted data and extracting valuable information, which aligns well with the
    need to optimize data for better decision-making in irrigation management systems.
    Additionally, the use of vector distance analysis to calculate the accurate preferred
    factor and the subsequent application of multi-linear regression to improve prediction
    accuracy are relevant to the specific point of data considerations for automated
    irrigation management.


    However, the paper does not provide insights into the specific data formats, sources,
    or transmission protocols used in real-time irrigation management systems. It
    also lacks a discussion of the challenges and solutions associated with data collection
    and transmission in this context.


    Overall, while the paper touches on aspects of data considerations for automated
    irrigation management, its relevance is somewhat limited due to the narrow focus
    on prediction algorithms and lack of insights into the broader aspects of data
    management in this domain.'

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Chennai, India SECTION I. Introduction Precision
    farming is the method of using farming resource in optimistic way and not utmost
    using any the farming resource. This type of farming constantly measures, observes
    and responds to the crop basic need and necessity factor that directly and indirectly
    affects the crop growth and total harvest. It enables the farmer to use factors
    like pesticide, fertilizer, irrigation, tilling, and minerals in an effective
    manner. It is used to monitor and respond to the environmental impact of farming.
    It is used to save time and energy and cost. It also controls reduce fertilizer,
    chemical application and overall cost in farming. It is also reduces the pollution
    by reducing the proportion of chemical fertilizers on farming [1]. It provides
    better farming factors and environment trends that is needed for greater crop
    production. It uses many king of farming software and hardware to improvise all
    activities of farming more easily and to improve productivity. The sensor used
    to detect nitrogen, potassium and phosphorous are also detected to predict the
    growth rate of the plants. These are considered to be the plant nutrients and
    which determines the growth rate of the plants. The sensors are installed and
    the values are sent to the cloud. The Arduino UNO is used in the projects which
    has analogue and digital inputs. The coding can be embedded using the printed
    Arduino board connected to the CPU. The embedded coding is used to implement and
    manipulate the sensors. The PH sensors are used to measure the alkalinity and
    acidity of the water. As the growth rate of the plants depends upon the PH value
    also. SECTION II. Related Work The Machine Learning techniques are used in the
    Support Vector Machine data classification. The parameters to provide the maximum
    growth rate of the plants is monitored. The multi-class regression and classification
    has become so popular and its used for making the problem in an optimized way
    [4]. In the related works discussed, there are many works related to data stored
    for the identifying the parameters. Seethalaksmi etal. [5], proposed classification
    procedure and prediction of down pour, tackling the problem of insufficient crop
    yield. The both problems are solved by assessing the parameters which also gives
    reduction in energy consumption. Balakrishna etal., [6], proposed method based
    on machine learning used in the smart systems, the Convolutional Neural Networks
    (CNN) and region based system with a particular one shot is identified to increase
    the farmers yield. Achilles D. Boursianis etal., [7] proposed method in the aerial
    unmanned vehicles, the precision farming is used here to capture the details in
    the field. The regions in the images are analysed and machine learning based algorithms
    are used for the same. Sagarika Paul and Satwinder Singh., [10], in their work
    proposed new technique to find the accuracy of prediction and they have used CNN
    for region based feature extractions and manipulating the features accordingly.
    Precision farming is the method of using farming resource in an optimistic way.
    This type of farming constantly measures observes and responds to the crop with
    necessity factors that directly and indirectly affect the crop growth and total
    harvest. It enables the farmer to use factors like pesticide, fertilizer, irrigation,
    tilling, and minerals in an effective manner. It is used to monitor and respond
    to the environmental impact of farming. It is used to save time, energy and cost.
    It also reduces the use of fertilizer, chemical application and overall cost in
    farming. It helps in choosing better farming factors and environment trends that
    are needed for greater crop production. It uses many king of farming software
    and hardware to improvise all activities of farming more easily and thus improves
    productivity. The factors that influence the growth of the crops and harvest concentrates
    only on one or two parameters. The variety of crops differ and also factors influencing
    the growth varies with the same. This existing system can measure vector distance
    but cannot predict using vector value. This existing system is able to show only
    the current status with high accuracy. The existing system can predict immediate
    future values with high accuracy. It also uses the single type of prediction method
    for prediction. To solve the problem, the semantic based vector distancing method
    and multiple linear regression is used in the proposed system. There is no customizable
    fabricated circuit for measuring three or more factors influencing the crop growth.
    There is no prediction system which can be customizable for more than 30 variety
    of crops. The output the vector distance will give only the distance between two
    consecutive points, but no prediction using those points. The system cannot predict
    future values with high accuracy. Need fully dedicated dataset in order to perform
    with stability and accuracy. To solve the existing system, discrepancies, the
    proposed system takes on the sensor based embedded circuit (SECHHR) for measuring
    data set and also proposed vector distance analysis to measure the distance between
    two consecutive values and compare it with the mean distance. The proposed prediction
    system uses Semantic Processing based Vector Distancing Method (SPVDM). It generates
    new labels and predictor values which gives most suitable threshold factors. The
    higher harvest rate and crop yield is predicted by using proposed SPVDM based
    Multilinear Regression (SPVDMMR) is proposed in the project. In general the vector
    distance for every value in the dataset is calculated and the mean value of those
    value is calculated by doing that mean value is generated. By using the mean value
    new dataset column is generated for needed factors and these factors value are
    summed into single value for further processing. By generating more data loaded
    columns we can generate more precise and accurate prediction through multi linear
    model. The advantages of the proposed system are as follows: Hidden and indirect
    data in the dataset are utilized properly. Multiple data frames are derived from
    the dataset with proofing to improve precision and accuracy. It reduces the processing
    time and training and test time of the regression model by generating more direct
    data. Instead of generating dummies if data frames and converting string values
    into binary value of 1''s and O''s it can produce continuous values. SECTION III.
    Proposed Work The main objective of the work is to develop a prediction system
    by analysing the factors for high yield of crops. The factors considered are temperature,
    humidity, PH value, rainfall, mineral composition of the soil. To check and monitor
    the data of the above factors periodically using sensors like DH 11 sensor, DH
    22 sensor, PH level sensor, NPK sensors, forecast data for rain water are used
    in the project with a proposed Sensor based Embedded Circuit for High Harvest
    Rate (SECHHR). To store the measured data in the CSV format and import the data
    store for analysis and prediction using Semantic Processing based Vector Distancing
    Method (SPVDM). It generates new labels and predictor values which gives most
    suitable threshold factors. To predict higher harvest rate and crop yield the
    SPVDM based Multi linear Regression (SPVDMMR) is proposed in the project. The
    harvest rate of the crop is predicted using the factors influencing the growth
    of the crop. If any factors induce more compared to other, it will damage the
    growth and decrease the harvest rate. The proportional mix of ingredients is necessary
    for the beneficial harvest rate. To predict the most suitable and proportional
    value for high harvest value using machine learning techniques. Multi linear regression
    is widely used, when predicting the variable value based on two or more variables.
    Vector distance analysis is used to find the vector distance between two consecutive
    points. This also known as Euclidean distance. Euclidean Distance is measured
    by flooring the two points in a graph and measuring the vector distance between
    those two points. The vector distance is applied to find the suitable temperature
    fodder crop to give high kill and to predict the percentage of forest can be obtained
    in a given temperature. Using vector distance analysis, the percentage of Crop
    harvest for the given temperature in the data set can be calculated and the percentage
    of forest is feed into the data set Respective to the temperature. By using both
    the methods the prediction can be improved. Thus, the harvest capacity can be
    predicted precisely. Multi-linear regression is a type of linear regression in
    linear equation uses one input variable in response to one output variable, whereas
    in multi linear regression method we can use more than one input variable in response
    to one output variable. Multi linear regression is widely used, when predicting
    the variable value based on two or more variables. Vector distance analysis is
    used to find the vector distance between two consecutive points. It is also known
    as Euclidean distance. Euclidean Distance is measured by flooring the two points
    in a graph and measuring the vector distance between these two points. Regression
    is applied by calculating the difference in continuous values with gradual increase
    or decrease if there is independent Relation between the independent and dependent
    variable is calculated by passing through all the data in the independent and
    dependent variable the regression is done. The vector distance is applied to find
    the suitable temperature fodder crop to give high kill and to predict the percentage
    of forest can be obtained in a given temperature. Using vector distance analysis,
    the percentage of Crop harvest for the given temperature in the data set can be
    calculated and the percentage of forest is feed into the data set Respective to
    the temperature [6]. By using both the methods the prediction can be improved.
    Thus, the harvest capacity can be predicted precisely. Such this prediction can
    be done for the following factors: (soil humidity, ph. value, NKP composition,
    soil type.) The proposed work is based on the multiple-linear regression. The
    linear relationship is created between the dependent and independent variable.
    The addition of standard least squares is very much important in the multi regression
    method. The linear regression is improvised and the parameter in the soil, i.e.
    the moisture is identified as the dependent variable and growth of the crop and
    its yield depends on the same. Nutrient that has to be provided to the crop is
    the independent variable. The soil moisture prediction is performed for seven
    days, the support vector regression method is used and many iterations are also
    done to measure the same. Three different data set are used to test the same.
    The embedded system with the microcontroller circuit is designed to do the tests
    in the porotype. To solve the existing system, discrepancies, the proposed system
    takes on the sensor based embedded circuit (SECHHR) for measuring data set and
    also proposed vector distance analysis to measure the distance between two consecutive
    values and compare it with the mean distance. The proposed prediction system uses
    Semantic Processing based Vector Distancing Method (SPVDM). It generates new labels
    and predictor values which gives most suitable threshold factors. The higher harvest
    rate and crop yield is predicted by using proposed SPVDM based Multi linear Regression
    (SPVDMMR) is proposed in the project. In general the vector distance for every
    value in the dataset is calculated and the mean value of those value is calculated
    by doing that mean value is generated. By using the mean value new dataset column
    is generated for needed factors and these factors value are summed into single
    value for further processing. By generating more data loaded columns we can generate
    more precise and accurate prediction through multi linear model [8]. Hidden and
    indirect data in the dataset are utilized properly. Multiple data frames are derived
    from the dataset with proofing to improve precision and accuracy. It reduces the
    processing time and training and test time of the regression model by generating
    more direct data. Instead of generating dummies if data frames and converting
    string values into binary value of 1''s and O''s it can produce continuous values

    12 Nov 2020 1 Introduction Global water consumption has increased at an unprecedented
    rate during the last century, with many countries turning to groundwater as either
    an additional or primary source of supply to meet growing agricultural and other
    sectoral demands (FAO, 2015; Famiglietti, 2014). In arid and semi-arid regions
    in particular, groundwater is routinely the major water source driving such expansions
    in irrigated agriculture (Siebert et al., 2010). Unfortunately, these expansions
    have come with a number of associated costs related to sustainability of aquifer
    systems, degrading water quality, and over-exploitation. Indeed, global monitoring
    efforts targeting major aquifer systems around the world have identified strong
    depletion trends (Wada et al., 2012; Famiglietti, 2014), making the prospect of
    meeting future water and food security demands even more challenging (Dalin et
    al., 2017). While these relatively recent estimates of groundwater depletion (Famiglietti
    et al., 2011; Voss et al, 2013; Rodell et al., 2018) have been obtained through
    satellite systems such as the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE;
    Tapley et al., 2004), their value as a monitoring and management tool is limited
    due to the coarse observation scale (Alley and Konikow, 2015; Miro and Famiglietti,
    2018). In order to provide the granularity of information needed to monitor groundwater
    abstractions at the field scale (∼50 ha), a combination of higher-resolution data
    and modeling is needed. Despite its extreme arid environment (Kenawy and McCabe,
    2016), Saudi Arabia has quite an extensive agricultural sector. Like most national
    efforts to monitor and manage agricultural water use, agencies in Saudi Arabia
    have relied on farmer surveys to estimate agricultural land and water extraction.
    In common with other national efforts, there is also a lack of regular and consistent
    field metering to provide measurements of agricultural water use. Nevertheless,
    historical estimates from early national studies indicate an agricultural extent
    of about 12 135 km2 in 2005, with associated water use of 21 billion cubic meters
    (BCM) within the kingdom (FAO, 2008a). While this may be relatively small compared
    to other national accounts (Döll and Siebert, 2002; FAO, 2008b; Wisser et al.,
    2008), agricultural water use in Saudi Arabia has been estimated to represent
    more than 80 % of the total national water consumption (FAO, 2008a; Chowdhury
    and Al-Zahrani, 2015). Indeed, it is thought that less than 20 % of the agricultural
    water use comes from renewable sources, with rain-fed agriculture present only
    in southwestern regions such as Jizan and Aseer. Local alluvial aquifers (e.g.,
    wadis) that are occasionally recharged during storm events provide another source
    of water that has been used for more traditional agriculture in Saudi Arabia (Missimer
    et al., 2012), but these do not represent a suitable source for large commercial-scale
    applications. The primary origin of water that has driven the dramatic expansion
    of irrigated agriculture in Saudi Arabia is non-renewable groundwater from deep
    fossil aquifer systems. Although agriculture has featured throughout the nation''s
    history, significant extraction from groundwater resources really only commenced
    during the 1970s, when subsidies directed towards increasing food security incentivized
    farmers (FAO, 2008a; Al-Rumkhani et al., 2004). These incentives, together with
    the relatively inexpensive access to diesel fuel required for extraction via pumping
    wells, combined to rapidly develop this sector of the economy. Center-pivot irrigation,
    where water is pumped from a well and sprayed using a rotating arm with nozzles,
    became the predominant method of irrigation nation-wide and is typically applied
    on a daily and continuous basis for prolonged periods. The rapid expansion in
    agricultural land use, especially from center-pivot irrigation fields, has thus
    rendered ground-survey-based monitoring impractical and increasingly unreliable.
    With regular coverage from Earth-observing satellites, remote sensing offers a
    capacity to monitor the Earth across a range of spatial and temporal scales (McCabe
    et al., 2017a). While moderate-resolution images (e.g., O∼250 m–1 km) have been
    used for observing processes such as evaporation (Mu et al., 2011), these techniques
    lack the capacity to delineate individual fields. Typical center-pivot fields
    with dimensions approaching 50 ha (800 m diameter) are generally densely vegetated,
    and crops with different growing seasons are often located adjacent to each other
    or even within the same field. In such a case, platforms such as the MODerate
    resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) would only capture a heterogeneous
    mix of vegetated and bare desert soil, let alone be able to differentiate between
    crops (Kustas et al., 2004; McCabe et al., 2006; Wardlow et al., 2007; Guindin-Garcia
    et al., 2012). Landsat 8 data, on the other hand, have a spatial resolution of
    30 m, allowing them to map individual fields with a revisit time of 16 d. Whether
    this temporal resolution is sufficient to capture the seasonality of different
    crops is certainly a question to be explored, although it should be noted that
    new satellite platforms such as Sentinel 2 (Drusch et al., 2012) and even CubeSats
    (McCabe et al., 2017b) provide a much higher orbital repeat cycle. Regardless,
    a satellite-driven framework would provide a singular opportunity for improving
    agricultural water management and monitoring (Brocca et al., 2018; Jalilvand et
    al., 2019). Quantifying crop water use via evaporation is a fundamental step towards
    estimating agricultural water use. In the absence of within-field flow metering
    or a surface flux monitoring system (Baldocchi et al., 2001), a remote-sensing-based
    approach to estimate land surface evaporation provides a suitable alternative.
    A comprehensive body of research has been dedicated to developing and intercomparing
    techniques (Kalma et al., 2008; Fisher et al., 2017) and exploring the application
    of these from local (Allen et al., 2007; Anderson et al., 2011) to regional and
    global scales (Miralles et al., 2016; McCabe et al., 2016). Most of these models
    combine available meteorological data with satellite-based vegetation retrievals
    or with vegetation and thermal infrared measurements to estimate the surface evaporation.
    For example, Song et al. (2016) and Li et al. (2017) used the two-source energy
    balance (TSEB; Norman et al. 1995) and surface energy balance (SEBS; Su, 2002)
    models, respectively, to map evaporation from semi-arid irrigated sites. Aragón
    et al. (2018) applied the Priestley–Taylor JPL (PT-JPL; Fisher et al., 2008) model
    with ultra-high-resolution vegetation data from CubeSats to map evaporation over
    irrigated fields. Anderson et al. (2012) demonstrated and discussed the ability
    of Landsat thermal imagery (e.g., with TSEB) to monitor evaporation and its application
    for water resource management. TSEB has also been used as part of the Atmosphere-Land
    Exchange Inverse (ALEXI; Anderson et al., 1997) model and its associated disaggregation
    scheme (DisALEXI; Norman et al., 2003) to generate high-resolution maps of agricultural
    water use. As it currently stands, there remains no single retrieval technique
    that has been identified as the best-performing evaporation model across all biomes
    and scales (Ershadi et al., 2014; Michel et al., 2016; McCabe et al., 2016), with
    model selection ultimately based on past performance and expert knowledge. While
    there have been sustained efforts towards estimating agricultural water use through
    evaporation modeling, there have been relatively few studies aimed at retrieving
    actual irrigation amounts for monitoring purposes. For example, Folhes et al.
    (2009) combined known irrigation values from 40 selected fields with satellite-based
    evaporation estimates in order to derive an irrigation efficiency. They then used
    this information to estimate the total water use in a semi-arid irrigated agricultural
    region in Brazil. Santos et al. (2008) integrated satellite-based evaporation
    estimates into a water balance model in order to provide improved irrigation guidelines
    to reduce water use. Another approach that has been explored is to use satellite-based
    evaporation estimates to constrain the irrigation input into a land surface model
    (LSM) by way of inverse modeling. Droogers et al. (2010) used synthetic model
    runs to determine whether this approach could be employed to retrieve irrigation
    amounts. Importantly, they explored the effects of satellite retrieval frequency
    on the estimated irrigation, demonstrating that while RMSE increased with larger
    observation intervals, Landsat data could potentially be used for this purpose.
    Huang et al. (2015) used a similar approach by assimilating temporal variations
    of MODIS-derived Leaf Area Index (LAI) and evaporation data into the soil water
    atmosphere plant (SWAP) model to derive irrigation depth. They found that assimilating
    both variables resulted in the least relative error of the resulting crop yields
    compared to official county statistics. López (2018) also used evaporation estimates
    and an LSM in an inverse modeling approach to retrieve irrigation rates from 40
    center-pivot fields, demonstrating the potential for obtaining seasonal irrigation
    rates for individual fields. More recently, Jalilvand et al. (2019) explored the
    possibility of using an approach designed to retrieve rainfall from satellite-based
    soil moisture data in order to infer irrigation amounts, expanding upon the work
    of Brocca et al. (2018). However, this approach is limited by the scale at which
    soil moisture can currently be retrieved (e.g., 0.25∘) as well as by the uncertainty
    of the techniques used to obtain the actual rainfall amounts that need to be removed
    (Jalilvand et al., 2019). To date, the potential of coupling a land surface model
    with satellite estimates (via evaporation) has yet to be fully exploited for operational
    field-scale irrigation monitoring. While estimates of evaporation represent the
    main loss of water from agricultural systems (through soil evaporation and vegetation
    transpiration), losses through deep drainage are not generally accounted for in
    evaporation models. LSMs can account for such hydrology, simulating the exchanges
    of water and heat between the land surface and the atmosphere and providing a
    detailed water balance that is beyond standard evaporation process models. One
    simple method to incorporate irrigation into an LSM is to directly add the irrigation
    rate to the rainfall component (e.g., Ozdogan et al., 2010), but this requires
    the values of the irrigation rates to be known (or assumed) a priori. However,
    satellite-based evaporation estimates could be used to constrain the irrigation
    value needed to reproduce the observed water use. In this study, the idea of combining
    satellite-based evaporation estimates with LSM simulations to indirectly obtain
    irrigation rates, and consequently groundwater extraction amounts, was applied
    over two distinct irrigated agricultural regions. As in the soil moisture-based
    approach of Brocca et al. (2018) and Jalilvand et al. (2019), rainfall is not
    explicitly considered in this water balance. The application of this inverse modeling
    approach can be simplified in arid environments, as irrigation rates are typically
    not modified when short-duration sporadic rainfall events occur, since the amounts
    that can be captured by the crops are limited. Indeed, over the growth cycle of
    a typical crop, the applied irrigation volume is at least an order of magnitude
    greater than any rainfall component (Kenawy and McCabe, 2016). The present study
    details the first large-scale implementation of this framework, focusing on quantifying
    groundwater abstractions for a single year to illustrate the feasibility of larger-scale
    and longer-term implementation. The integrated satellite data and modeling approach
    is designed to map the extent and distribution of fields, estimate crop water
    use, and infer groundwater abstraction rates. To do this, the framework exploits
    an object-based image classification technique (Johansen et al., 2010) for mapping
    individual fields, where one field is defined as the area covered by a single
    center-pivot rotating arm. The latter is an important aspect that was required
    in order to apply the data-modeling framework in parallel, i.e., to effectively
    obtain irrigation rates over a large region containing thousands of fields. Naturally,
    this allows the display and aggregation of groundwater abstraction rates and other
    relevant information over arbitrary delineations, such as management zones or
    farms, and represents a novel aspect of this work. To date, there have been no
    comparable efforts attempting the retrieval of individual irrigation rates for
    a large number (thousands) of fields, and thus this study represents an effort
    that moves closer towards big-data-driven operational monitoring of individual
    fields. Our framework provides a novel water accounting system for agricultural
    management in Saudi Arabia and offers an independent benchmark for water loss
    over a region that is routinely omitted in global (and even regional-scale) evaporation
    products (Mu et al., 2011; Miralles et al., 2011). Covering one of the largest
    agricultural regions in Saudi Arabia, the study provides a benchmark against which
    the impact of water policy changes can be evaluated in the future and demonstrates
    the potential of broader-scale application elsewhere. 2 Description of study regions
    The study focused on two different agricultural areas in Saudi Arabia, which enabled
    an evaluation of the proposed groundwater abstraction estimation framework (Sect.
    3) and subsequent larger-scale application to be explored. To evaluate the performance
    at the individual field scale, the strategy was first applied to 40 center pivots
    located on a small farm (Sect. 2.1) southeast of Riyadh. For this site, available
    irrigation data for the year 2015 were obtained directly from the farm management
    (Sect. 3.5) based on in-house field reporting. To assess the large-scale application
    of our groundwater abstraction estimation strategy, it was then applied to thousands
    of center-pivot fields in Al Jawf (Sect. 2.2), one of the largest agricultural
    regions in Saudi Arabia. With no individual field data available for comparison
    on this region, the total groundwater abstraction estimates were compared with
    some previous regional-scale estimates. 2.1 The Tawdeehiya experimental farm The
    Tawdeehiya farm (Fig. 1) is a medium-sized commercial agricultural facility that
    consists of approximately 40 center-pivot fields, each with an extent of approximately
    50 ha, n.b., within the average field size of those found in the larger Al Jawf
    region (see Fig. 1 and Sect. 4.2). The farm is located about 200 km southeast
    of Riyadh and exhibits similar environmental and climatic conditions to the Al
    Jawf study area (i.e., low rainfall and high daytime summer temperatures exceeding
    40 ∘C). Crops grown in this farm during 2015 included a range of vegetables, alfalfa,
    Rhodes grass, and maize, with a total area under cultivation of more than 2000 ha.
    While one Landsat tile (path/row 165/43) is enough to observe the entire farm,
    the adjacent tile (164/43) offers additional coverage of fields on the eastern
    side of the farm. Additional details of the site and data can be found in López
    (2018) as well as some related remote-sensing-based studies that provide further
    description (Aragón et al., 2018; Houborg and McCabe, 2018b). Figure 1Location
    of the two study regions. Left: the Tawdeehiya farm in Al Kharj (southeast of
    Riyadh). A false color Landsat 8 image (9 June 2015) is shown to highlight active
    center-pivot fields over the desert environment. Right: the Al Jawf agricultural
    region in the northwest of Saudi Arabia spans two Landsat 8 tiles. Two false color
    images are shown: 9 June 2015 for path/row 172/39 (left) and 19 June 2015 for
    path/row 171/39 (right). Center-pivot fields are densely packed and largely uniform
    in size in the main area (30∘ N, 38.25∘ E), while in other areas they are sparser
    and less uniform (for example, the image on the right). 2.2 The Al Jawf agricultural
    region The Al Jawf province is located in the north of Saudi Arabia (29∘–32∘ N,
    36∘–41∘ E) and is one of the top five agricultural regions in terms of both agricultural
    area and water use (FAO, 2013; Chowdhury et al., 2016). Most of the agricultural
    area is managed by large commercial farms, the majority employing center-pivot
    irrigation (Fig. 1). The irrigated area in Al Jawf has increased significantly
    over the last 3 decades, from being practically non-existent in the 1980s to covering
    more than 1500 km2 by 2005 (FAO, 2013), with more than 90 % estimated to be irrigated
    using groundwater delivered via center-pivot systems (Al-Rhumikhani and Din, 2004).
    The Saudi Statistical Yearbook (SSYB, 2010) reported a decline in acreage in Al
    Jawf from 1600 km2 in 2007 to 1200 km2 in 2009. However, newer versions of this
    report (SSYB, 2013) do not offer a regional disaggregation of agricultural area.
    Under the Ninth Development Plan from the Ministry of Economy and Planning (MEP,
    2010), it was reported that there was a 2.5 % annual decrease in agricultural
    water use in the kingdom, from 17.5 BCM in 2004 to 15.4 BCM in 2009, which was
    attributed to regulations to rationalize water consumption and cultivation of
    water-intensive crops (MEP, 2010). In Al Jawf, the same report forecasts a continued
    decline in groundwater abstraction from 1.5 BCM in 2009 to 1.2 BCM in 2014. Although
    other sources include more recent estimates for the total agricultural water demand
    in the kingdom (MEWA, 2019), these are not available on a regional basis. The
    majority of crops grown in Al Jawf in 2009 (SSYB, 2010) were cereals (60 % in
    area, with wheat being the most predominant), followed by fruits (24 %, consisting
    of dates, grapes, and citrus), fodder (11 %, mostly clover), and vegetables (4 %,
    mostly potatoes and tomatoes). Unfortunately, the same level of detail is not
    available from more recent reports (SSYB, 2013), but we note that cereal production
    is no longer supported to any significant extent. One of the challenges for attributing
    water use to crop type in this region is the lack of available ground-based land
    cover data. Al-Rhumikhani and Din (2004) used a dataset from one agricultural
    site in 2001 that cultivated alfalfa, potatoes, tomato, and wheat to classify
    crops in Al Jawf from Landsat imagery. To our knowledge, no other recent crop
    classification efforts have been made in the region. Although rain-fed agriculture
    represents about 10 % of the cultivated area within Saudi Arabia, this is limited
    to the southwestern regions of Jizan, Baha, Aseer, and Makkah (FAO, 2008a). Annual
    rainfall values in Al Jawf are, as in most of Saudi Arabia, less than 50 mm yr−1
    (Kenawy et al., 2016), and consequently there is insufficient water to support
    rain-fed irrigation. Indeed, agriculture in Al Jawf is entirely supported by groundwater
    extraction (Al-Rhumikhani and Din, 2004; MEP, 2010; Chowdhury et al., 2016). In
    2015, average wind speeds in this region were relatively low (less than 5 m s−1)
    throughout the year but reached maximum speeds up to 16 m s−1 (the meteorological
    data used in this study are described in Sect. 3.4.3). Average temperatures ranged
    from about 10 ∘C in January and December up to 32 ∘C in July and August and were
    consistently higher than 25 ∘C from May to October. Maximum temperatures of up
    to 44 ∘C occurred in August, while the minimum temperature reached was −1 ∘C and
    occurred in January. Relative humidity ranged from about 25 % from May to September
    and around 55 % during January, November, and December. 3 Pivot-based groundwater
    abstraction framework A key output of this study is the estimation of groundwater
    abstraction from thousands of individually delineated center-pivot fields. At
    the core of the methodology is the indirect estimation of the volume of irrigation
    that needs to be applied to a field in order to reproduce the satellite-observed
    crop water use. Figure 2 presents a schematic of the methodology with the necessary
    inputs, intermediate processes, and relevant outputs. In this approach, the first
    step is an automated processing framework (Sect. 3.1) that performs Landsat image
    acquisition, cloud and cloud shadow detection, regionally optimized atmospheric
    correction, and finally higher-level product generation of albedo, Normalized
    Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), LAI, and land surface temperature (LST). This
    procedure was based on recent efforts in combining machine-learning techniques
    with physically based model inversion results (Houborg and McCabe, 2018a), which
    have made the automatic estimation of these parameters over large arid regions
    possible. The data obtained in this crucial first step were then directed into
    both the evaporation and land surface models (see Sect. 3.4). The next step uses
    a geographical object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) procedure (Johansen et al.,
    2010) to detect and map individual center-pivot fields based on NDVI data (Sect.
    3.2). Meteorological data were retrieved from a reanalysis performed using the
    Advanced Research WRF (ARW; Skamarock et al., 2008) model over the Arabian Peninsula.
    Details of this dataset are described in Langodan et al. (2014), Viswanadhapalli
    et al. (2017, 2019), and Dasari et al. (2019), so only a brief description is
    provided in Sect. 3.4.3. To provide needed estimates of crop water use (via evaporation),
    the TSEB model (see Sect. 3.4.1) was run over two Landsat tiles in each study
    region (172/39 and 171/39 for Al Jawf; 165/43 and 164/43 for the Tawdeehiya farm)
    using the WRF data together with the Landsat-based vegetation and biophysical
    parameters (at 30 m spatial resolution and at a 16 d frequency) obtained in the
    first step. Figure 2Flow chart outlining the main inputs (dashed-dotted), processes
    (solid), and outputs (dashed) of the groundwater abstraction monitoring framework.
    Download Up to this point, all processes involved use of the entire Landsat tiles.
    The following steps in the framework were performed independently over each separately
    delineated center-pivot field (herein simply referred to as “field”). These operations
    were performed in parallel using hundreds of CPUs on a high-performance computing
    cluster (see https://www.hpc.kaust.edu.sa/ibex, last access: 10 January 2020,
    for further details). To do this, data were first extracted for each field using
    Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) tools. Next, LAI spatio-temporal information
    was used to detect the seasonal activity of each field. This included the possibility
    that one field actually contained two different crops with different growing periods,
    a practice that was recognized by analysing the images, as well as on-site observations.
    Details of the automated detection capability developed within this framework
    are provided in Sect. 3.3. After this analysis, a “field temporal use index” was
    computed, defined here as the percentage of time that the field was used to grow
    a crop within the year of study. This index, referred to as field use (%), is
    required to compare irrigation practices among different farms and/or regions.
    The Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange model (CABLE; Kowalczyk et al.,
    2006; Sect. 3.4.2) was used as an offline land surface hydrology model to indirectly
    estimate the irrigation rate applied over each season, for any particular field,
    for the study year of 2015. As rainfall is limited in this region, implementing
    CABLE simulations without an irrigation component leads to an almost complete
    lack of evaporation signal. TSEB information on evaporation was used to infer
    the irrigation amount that would be needed in CABLE to reproduce the estimated
    evaporation. In this sense, TSEB improves the estimation of CABLE by providing
    the missing irrigation component in this region. The procedure is done as follows:
    for each active season identified in a field, an ensemble of CABLE runs was performed
    under different irrigation amounts. Denoting Esat as the remotely sensed estimates
    of evaporation (obtained using TSEB; see Sect. 3.4.1) and ELSM as the output evaporation
    from the CABLE land surface model, a cost function that was proportional to the
    difference between ELSM and Esat was accumulated during each available observation
    of Esat: where H is an operator that maps the land surface model space X(ti) to
    the observation space Y(ti); n.b., the satellite estimates need not be available
    at the same resolution as the model or might be incomplete (e.g., due to the presence
    of clouds). López (2018) used a stochastic optimization approach (Spall, 1998)
    that iteratively updates the irrigation rates to minimize the objective function.
    That method required tuning of two parameters that control the speed at which
    the update occurs, a process that was initially performed by trial and error.
    Importantly, the number of fields that were evaluated in López (2018) was significantly
    smaller (40) than the present study (more than 5000). Unfortunately, the transferability
    of the optimization parameters to a larger number of fields was limited, as the
    optimized irrigation rates either diverged or the values did not update at all
    due to improper scaling of the gradient of the cost function. Under the rationale
    that the search space is relatively small, i.e., by constraining the irrigation
    rate to realistic values (e.g., 1.1–3 times the observed evaporation rates), a
    simple exhaustive search (brute force) was implemented in this study. This removed
    the need for a trial-and-error approach for optimization of parameters as well
    as the need to compute a gradient (which requires at least two model runs for
    each step), i.e., trading off precision for improvements in computation. The latter
    was a key consideration to efficiently apply this methodology to thousands of
    fields. At the end of the process, the irrigation rate that produced the most
    accurate evaporation estimate (compared to TSEB estimates) was the one used to
    calculate the total groundwater abstraction over the field. The irrigation rate
    (Irr) applied to CABLE is the actual amount of water reaching the ground, and
    it was assumed to be a constant fraction (1−Closs) of groundwater abstraction
    (Gw) as in Eq. (2): The loss term was calculated using the following rationale.
    The amount of water pumped out of the well (Gw) is sprayed by nozzles positioned
    on a rotating arm irrigating the field. A fraction of this water (Closs) is lost
    due to wind carrying moisture out of the field to the desert soil or to other
    fields. Under similar conditions (hyper-arid irrigated fields), this fraction
    has been estimated to be between 12 % and 20 % (Steiner et al., 1983; Sadeghi
    et al., 2017). Without frequent on-site measurement of this loss value across
    the whole field, it is not possible to incorporate it directly into the model.
    In this study, the aim was to provide an estimate of the irrigation amount (Irr)
    as an approximation of the groundwater abstraction (Gw). Efforts to translate
    this into actual groundwater abstraction on a regular basis for large areas are
    necessary but will require ground observations or further model improvement. For
    this study, a conservative value (in time and throughout the fields) of 20 % (Closs=0.2),
    and thus a factor of 1.25, i.e., , was used to scale irrigation to abstracted
    groundwater. In terms of the overall field water balance, the approach employed
    in this study was simplified by the fact that rainfall in this region does not
    represent a significant source that can be used by crops. As such, the rainfall
    component in CABLE was replaced by the irrigation rate that is being estimated
    in the iterative procedure. The validity of this assumption and thus the applicability
    of this model are certainly reasonable in most of the major agricultural regions
    of Saudi Arabia, with the exception of regions with significant rain-fed agriculture,
    such as those in Jizan and Baha. However, even in those regions, the annual rainfall
    rarely exceeds 300 mm and occurs within a relatively well-defined period of the
    year. For example, coffee production is an important economic activity in Jizan,
    occurring mainly at high altitudes within the Fifa mountains, and farmers there
    regularly require groundwater as an additional source to meet the water needs
    of coffee trees, especially during extended periods of drought (Al-Abdulkader
    et al., 2018; Sayed et al., 2019). In other regions, the contribution of rainfall
    might be proportionally higher and thus need to be removed before obtaining the
    irrigated amount. 3.1 Vegetation indices and biophysical parameters retrieved
    from satellite data NDVI is a widely used metric describing surface greenness
    (Tucker, 1979; Beck et al., 2011) and is computed herein directly from the Landsat
    near-infrared (851–879 nm) and red bands (636–673 nm). Prior to computing NDVI,
    Landsat images for the year 2015 (between 20 and 22 scenes were acquired for each
    of the tiles used in this study) were atmospherically corrected to surface reflectances
    using a regionally optimized Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the
    Solar Spectrum (6S; Kotchenova et al., 2006)-based approach (Houborg and McCabe,
    2017). Cloud and cloud shadow detection was performed using the Function of mask
    (Fmask) algorithm (Zhu and Woodcock, 2012). Another biophysical indicator for
    vegetation growth monitoring is the LAI, defined as the projected area of leaves
    over a unit of land area. LAI is a key parameter that has been used to improve
    water and energy flux modeling over agricultural fields (Aragón et al., 2018).
    However, as opposed to NDVI, LAI cannot be computed directly from satellite data.
    While simple relationships between LAI and other vegetation indices (including
    NDVI) have been used (Turner et al., 1999; Colombo et al., 2003; Fan et al., 2009),
    the applicability of such relationships for regions other than where they were
    developed (using ground measurements) has been brought into question (Wang et
    al., 2005; Atzberger et al., 2015; Kang et al., 2016). Houborg and McCabe (2018a)
    used a machine-learning approach to develop relationships between LAI and several
    vegetation indices over a desert agriculture site in Saudi Arabia (Tawdeehiya
    farm; Sect. 2.1). They used a combination of in situ measurements and physically
    based model inversion results as a hybrid training dataset, with retrievals showing
    good performance compared to the in situ LAI measurements. In our study, a coupled
    leaf-canopy model (PROSAIL) produced forward runs over a wide range of realizations,
    and these were used as a training dataset to develop estimates of LAI using a
    random forest (RF) approach. The inversion of the forward runs needed to derive
    LAI was based on the REGularized canopy reflectance model (REGFLEC; Houborg et
    al., 2015), which has been shown to be suitable for largely automated applications
    (Houborg and McCabe, 2016). The configuration of REGFLEC in this study followed
    Houborg and McCabe (2018a) but using only the model inversion results (e.g., PROSAIL)
    due to a lack of in situ LAI data in the larger region of Al Jawf. PROSAIL combines
    a leaf optical properties model (PROSPECT; Jacquemoud and Baret, 1990) with a
    canopy bidirectional reflectance model (SAIL; Verhoef, 1984) and has been used
    to retrieve LAI for a wide range of crops (Jacquemoud et al., 2009; Vohland et
    al., 2010; Rivera et al., 2013). The RF ensemble-based decision tree technique
    was used to learn the complex non-linear associations between the spectral data
    and the target biophysical property (i.e., LAI). In this study, the “ranger” RF
    package in R was used for model training and prediction. This package is optimized
    for efficient memory usage with large and high-dimensional datasets, a critical
    aspect for working with Landsat tile domains. Figure 3 shows the resulting NDVI
    and LAI maps for one Landsat tile (path/row 172/39) on 23 April 2015, demonstrating
    the high contrast between the bare desert soil and irrigated agriculture and the
    within-field variability that can be observed at these high resolutions. Most
    of the agricultural fields in Al Jawf (95 %) were located within this Landsat
    domain; however, the adjoining path/row 171/39 was also included to give a complete
    account of agriculture in Al Jawf (see Fig. 1). The Tawdeehiya farm is located
    on the eastern edge of path/row 165/43 and hence some fields can also be observed
    by path/row 164/43. Figure 3Example of the full Landsat tile (path/row 172/39)
    NDVI (left) and LAI (right) estimation, demonstrating the footprint from center-pivot-irrigated
    fields in this region (high contrast with the bare desert soil). 3.2 Semi-automatic
    delineation of center-pivot irrigation fields using Landsat imagery A GEOBIA approach
    was developed in the eCognition Developer 9.3 software to delineate individual
    fields for the study sites. As seasonal crop cycles prevent all active fields
    within a specific year from being detected at a single point in time, the full
    Landsat image time series was used for 2015. Two layers based on the annual image
    time series (20–22 images) were produced: (1) a maximum NDVI layer and (2) a minimum
    panchromatic layer. NDVI was first calculated for all images in the time series,
    and the maximum NDVI value for each pixel in the time series was assigned to the
    final maximum NDVI layer. Similarly, all the panchromatic images within the time
    series were used to produce a single panchromatic layer, representing the minimum
    value within the time series. To detect all active fields in 2015, a multi-threshold
    segmentation was applied to cluster all pixels with a maximum NDVI value of >0.20
    together and classify these objects as “vegetation”. Unclassified pixels surrounded
    by “vegetation” objects were first merged with the respective “vegetation” objects,
    and these objects were then classified as center pivots if the object length was
    ≤1200 m, length / width ratio ≤1.1, and elliptic fit ≥0.90. The length∕width ratio
    and elliptic fit features were used to identify round objects, while the length
    feature ensured that neighboring fields merged together were not initially classified
    as fields before they had been separated into objects, representing an individual
    field. The minimum panchromatic layer was subjected to an edge-extraction Lee
    sigma filter. This filtering process produced another layer, highlighting bright
    edges in the imagery, i.e., areas with large contrast in panchromatic pixel values,
    such as the edges between center pivots and surrounding sandy soil. Separating
    adjoining fields required several processing steps to first identify pixels with
    high edge-filtering values and the use of region-growing algorithms to grow these
    high-value edge-filtered pixels into neighboring pixels with lower values. This
    allowed most of the adjoined fields to be separated. Some refining of the delineation
    results was then performed to ensure the fields were extended to their perimeter,
    which was done using a number of object shape criteria and an NDVI threshold of
    0.20. While most of the fields (approximately 85 %) were correctly classified
    at this stage, there were still several half or “Pac-man”-shaped fields remaining
    to be classified. These remaining fields were manually delineated, followed by
    an object-growing and object-shrinking process to refine the manually delineated
    field edges. 3.3 Irrigation activity detection using LAI LAI time series were
    used as an indication of vegetation growth to estimate periods of active irrigation,
    which were then used to constrain the start and end dates of CABLE model runs.
    However, upon visual analysis of multiple fields within the study regions, we
    observed that fields are often divided into two halves, each with its own crop
    and potentially different irrigation amounts. Therefore, prior to obtaining a
    representative LAI time series for analysis, it was necessary to further delineate
    the two sections of the field if it was indeed divided. To achieve this, the k-means
    clustering algorithm was employed. In general, the idea of clustering is to identify
    groups of objects that are similar to one another and different from those in
    other groups (Jain and Dubes, 1988; Jain et al., 1999). The k-means algorithm
    (MacQueen, 1967) is a partitioning clustering method (i.e., there is no overlap
    between the groups) that has been widely used in remote sensing studies. For this
    purpose, let X={xi}, be a set of n-dimensional points to be clustered into a set
    of K clusters C={ck}, (in our study, K is set to 2). The squared error between
    the mean of each cluster and the points within the cluster can be computed by
    Eq. (3): The aim of the K-means algorithm is to minimize the sum of J(ck) for
    . Four main steps are followed iteratively to minimize this sum: (1) select K
    points as the initial centroids, (2) form K clusters by assigning all points to
    the closest centroid, (3) re-compute the centroid of each cluster, and (4) repeat
    (2) and (3) until there is no significant change in the centroids within consecutive
    iterations. To speed up convergence, the “k-means ” (Arthur and Vassilvitskii,
    2007) algorithm was used to select the initial cluster centers. A more detailed
    description of the k-means algorithm is provided by Jain (2010). Prior to applying
    the clustering algorithm, it was more efficient to extract the features to represent
    the characteristics of the time series. To do this, the discrete wavelet transform
    (DWT) was employed, which is an efficient procedure used to separate deterministic
    from stochastic components of a signal (Heil and Walnut, 1989). The DWT has been
    used to analyze satellite images in the context of noise reduction as well as
    change detection (Zhu and Yang, 1998; Wang and Paliwal, 2006; Martínez and Gilabert,
    2009). The main idea behind application of the DWT is that the signal is represented
    as a combination of approximation and detail coefficients (Heil and Walnut, 1989):
    where AJ(t) and Dj(t) are, respectively, the approximation and detail coefficients,
    and J is the decomposition level. The detail coefficients are generated by projecting
    the original signal x(t) using a set of wavelet basis functions defined as , ,
    where k is the shift parameter and is the base function. In other words, the detailed
    signal Dj(t) at level j is generated by the detailed signal Dj(t) at scale j and
    can be obtained by applying a high-pass filter (g) on the original and scaled
    signals. In a similar way, the approximation coefficients are generated by projecting
    the signal onto a set of orthonormal scaling functions given by , . Similarly,
    the scale signals are computed by applying a low-pass filter (h) on the original
    and scaled signals. Gao and Yan (2010) provide a more detailed description of
    the DWT. In our study, LAI time series were first transformed into DWT components
    by level-1 decomposition of the basis function “haar”. Then, to establish whether
    the field is divided into two parts or not, two threshold values were used. Both
    values relate to the “cosine similarity” (Eq. 5), which measures the similarity
    among pixels of the same field: where Ai and Bi are components of vectors A and
    B, respectively (i.e., one vector represents the time series of one pixel). The
    cosine similarity values of two vectors range from −1 to 1. The closer the value
    approaches 1, the closer the direction of the two vectors. On the other hand,
    the closer the value gets to −1, the more the two vectors go in the opposite direction.
    For each pair of pixels, the cosine similarity of DWT components of time series
    was first computed, and then the time series of the two pixels were determined
    to be similar or not by using a threshold of the cosine similarity (tcs). The
    second threshold used was based on the fraction of pairs where the value of cosine
    similarity was higher than tcs, i.e., defining nTcs as the number of pair values
    with similarity higher than tcs and N as the total number of pairs; the ratio
    to use as the second threshold was . Upon an exploratory analysis based on a representative
    sample of a few hundred fields, the appropriate values for these two thresholds
    were determined as tcs=0.75 and tpcs=0.8. Hence, a field was classified as partitioned
    when the tpcs value was exceeded and was thus further processed by the k-means
    algorithm for clustering. Next, a number of representative pixels within the field
    (or sub-field if partitioned) were selected and used to determine the start and
    end dates for each season within the land surface hydrology model runs. The pixels
    were selected based on a criterion that the daily LAI values, obtained by linearly
    interpolating from the 16 d LAI time series, were consistently within the interquartile
    range (e.g., 25 % and 75 %). This was done to remove the influence of outlier
    pixels. Finally, the mean value over these pixels each day was taken as the mean
    LAI time series (mLAI). Using this mean LAI time series, crop growing seasons
    were then selected based on the start and end dates of the first season, defined
    by the period where mLAI is higher than a threshold tLAI (in m2 m−2). A value
    of provided a reasonable delineation of growing seasons for a large number of
    fields. Furthermore, to remove noise that could result from the interpolation
    of the LAI time series, only seasons that were at least 30 d in duration were
    processed, which is the approximate length of the shortest crop growing seasons
    observed for alfalfa crops and also ensures that it includes at least one Landsat
    scene. Upon analysis of the shape of mLAI, in terms of the number of peaks as
    a measure of the oscillatory nature of the time series, fields were then classified
    into two possible categories: seasonal or perennial. A “seasonal” field had clearly
    defined growing cycles that were separated by inactive periods. Figure 4a shows
    a field that was active for only 3 months, with clear start and end dates obtained
    by computing the dates at which the mean seasonal pixels in the LAI time series
    intersected with 0.3 m2 m−2. Perennial fields had vegetation patterns that reflected
    long periods (up to year-round) of vegetation above the LAI threshold but with
    intermittent cut and re-growth periods. This is typical of a field growing alfalfa
    or grass, where the production is continuous throughout most of the year. An example
    of a perennial field is shown in Fig. 4b. This field was active from April to
    December 2015 but with intermittent cut/re-growth cycles. For this second category
    of crops, it was not straightforward to select clear periods for retrieving irrigation,
    due to Landsat''s temporal resolution of 16 d. To ensure that there would be enough
    satellite evaporation estimates for constraining the land surface model runs,
    the process for these types of pivots was performed on a quarterly basis. Figure

    of 0.3 m2 m−2. (a) Images of the six scenes when the field was identified as active
    are shown on top, which correspond to the six dates marked as diamonds inside

    followed by large LAI oscillations, indicating repeat cut/re-growth activities.

    Download 3.4 Models and ancillary data 3.4.1 Satellite evaporation estimation
    using TSEB The TSEB model (Norman et al., 1995) was used to obtain the satellite-based
    estimates of evaporation that constrain the land surface hydrology model runs.
    TSEB was selected based on its proven utility in the estimation of evaporation
    over irrigated crops in semi-arid and arid regions (e.g., Colaizzi et al., 2012;
    Zhuang and Wu, 2015; Nieto et al., 2019). TSEB is based on the energy balance
    ( ), where Rn is the net radiation reaching the crop canopy and soil surface,
    H is the sensible heat flux (i.e., the energy transformed to heat and released
    into the atmosphere), G is the soil heat flux, and LE is the latent heat flux
    of evaporation, which is the key link between the energy and water balance equations.
    In TSEB, the LE term is obtained as a residual of the energy balance equation
    and along with H and Rn is divided into separate components for the soil and canopy
    at each pixel. The model for sensible heat flux in TSEB is based on a network
    of temperature gradient–transport resistances between the air, canopy boundary
    layer, canopy, and soil. In this study, the “in-series” resistance scheme (Shuttleworth,
    1985) for the sensible heat flux was used. The in-series scheme was selected as
    it has been demonstrated to estimate heat fluxes of densely vegetated areas more
    accurately than the parallel or patch schemes (Kustas et al., 1999; Colaizzi et
    al., 2012). In center-pivot fields, the crops are not structured in rows, and
    at maturity the canopy covers the entirety of the soil surface (with the exception
    of the beam tracks of the pivot), and thus the area was considered to be densely
    vegetated. The in-series approach accounts for the coupling between soil and canopy
    heat fluxes. The sensible heat flux is defined below for canopy (Hc) and soil
    (Hs) in Eq. (6): where Tc is the canopy temperature, Ts is the soil temperature,
    TAC is the temperature of the canopy-air space, rx is the canopy boundary-layer
    resistance, rs is the resistance of air between the soil surface and source height,
    ρ is the density of water, and cp is the specific heat of water. The calculation
    of the two resistances rs and rx was done following the methods of Sauer et al.
    (1995) and McNaughton (1995), respectively. The LE fluxes for the canopy and soil
    are determined based on initial estimates for Tc and Ts, which are then iteratively
    refined until LEs is positive (or after a maximum number of iterations). An initial
    estimate of LEc (canopy latent heat flux) is required in order to obtain the values
    of Tc and Ts. This is done by using the Priestley–Taylor equation and then solving
    for Tc: where Ta is the air temperature from the WRF data and rah is the aerodynamic
    resistance to heat transport. The value of rah depends on atmospheric stability
    parameters, wind speed, and measurement heights for temperature and wind speed,
    which is set to WRF''s near-surface level (2 m in this study). The aerodynamic
    roughness length for heat and momentum transport were defined as and , where the
    (i.e., ln (z0M∕z0H)) parameter was set to 2 as in Norman et al. (1995). Without
    detailed in situ information describing land cover and crop development stage,
    canopy height was prescribed to a constant value of 0.3 m, a reasonable assumption
    based on the typical crops such as alfalfa, wheat, and vegetables being grown
    in this region. The net radiation is computed by Eq. (8): where α is the albedo
    (computed from Landsat data as in Liang, 2001), Sdn and Ldn are the incoming shortwave
    and longwave radiation components (derived from WRF data), is the surface emissivity
    with fφ described in Eq. (11), εveg=0.98 and εgrd=0.93 are the canopy and soil
    emissivities, respectively, and σb is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant. The net radiation
    that reaches the canopy Rnc is modeled as where φz is the solar zenith angle.
    This simple parameterization for Rnc was developed based on the Cupid model for
    dense canopies as described in Zhuang and Wu (2015). The initial soil temperature
    is then given by Eq. (10) and is updated iteratively as described in Norman et
    al. (1995): In this study, the radiometric temperature (Tr) is the LST derived
    from Landsat''s thermal infrared sensor data, with atmospheric correction of the
    at-sensor brightness surface temperature performed using MODTRAN (Berk et al.,
    2005; Rosas et al., 2017). In this process, atmospheric profile data from MERRA2
    (Gelaro et al., 2017) were used and emissivity fields were based on the methods
    of French et al. (2005) using estimates of vegetation fraction (Anderson et al.,
    2007). A data mining sharpener (DMS) technique based on regression tree analysis
    (Gao et al., 2012) was used to perform spatial sharpening of LST to 30 m resolution.
    The vegetation fraction at the sensor view angle φ (0 for Landsat) is The vegetation
    fraction assumes a spherical leaf angle distribution, which is a good approximation
    for general plant canopies, spreading the leaf area uniformly across solar zenith
    angles (Campbell and Norman, 1998). For Saudi Arabia, at the Landsat overpass
    time, the extension coefficient Kb is approximately equal to 0.5. For pixels with
    low LAI values (LAI<1), i.e., where the soil component is dominant, the canopy
    component was omitted by applying a simpler, one-source energy balance (OSEB).
    In the OSEB, the sensible heat flux is estimated by using a one-layer circuit
    network. Although this can lead to a sharp transition in evapotranspiration (ET)
    for values around LAI=1, this was done in order to reduce the influence of high
    bare soil evaporation values using TSEB, which would cause an overestimation of
    water use in fallow or inactive fields and where the surface can be modeled as
    a single layer. In OSEB, H is simply given by The soil heat flux (G) model of
    Santanello and Friedl (2003) was used in this study. This model includes a simple
    relation describing the covariation between daytime ground heat flux and net radiation
    (Rn): where A represents the maximum ratio of G∕Rns, B is a constant that minimizes
    the divergence of the equation to that of measured values, and t is the number
    of seconds between the satellite overpass time and solar noon. The values of A
    and B were left as in the original parameterization, with A=0.31 and B=74 000 s.
    The use of TSEB to estimate evaporation has been validated in similar arid regions
    (Colaizzi et al., 2012; Zhuang and Wu, 2015; Nieto et al., 2019). With a lack
    of sufficient ground-based measurements in our study regions, we did not attempt
    to provide a new validation dataset for TSEB. However, we used data from one eddy-covariance
    tower installed in 2016 on a center-pivot-irrigated field in Tawdeehiya farm (Fig.
    1; Sect. 2.1), which showed good estimation for operational purposes in this data-limited
    region (Fig. S1 in the Supplement). 3.4.2 CABLE CABLE was used as a stand-alone
    (offline) land surface hydrology model to estimate irrigation rates based on the
    evaporation estimates obtained with TSEB. CABLE was selected given its application
    in other dryland environments and as the land surface scheme for regional and
    global climate models (Zhang et al., 2009; Haverd et al., 2013; Hirsch et al.,
    2019), but the approach described in this study is not limited to any particular
    scheme. Energy and water interactions are modeled in CABLE across six layers of
    soil (with thickness from the surface to bottom layer of 2.2, 5.8, 15.4, 40.9,
    108.5, and 287.2 cm), the canopy layer, and the atmosphere. Similar to TSEB, the
    heat fluxes in CABLE are modeled by a network of aerodynamic resistances. The
    sensible and latent heat fluxes are also partitioned into a flux from the soil
    to the canopy and from the canopy to the atmosphere. However, in CABLE, the canopy
    layer is further divided (two-leaf canopy model) between sunlit and shaded leaves,
    using an approach developed by Leuning et al. (1995). Another feature of CABLE
    is that the canopy transpiration as well as root water extraction both depend
    on whether the canopy is wet, dry, or partially wet (Lai and Katul, 2000). A coupling
    between the root water extraction and stomatal conductance was added by Haverd
    et al. (2016), enabling a “root shut-down” that tests for over-extraction in each
    soil layer, which would otherwise result in high water use efficiencies under
    drying conditions. Hydraulic redistribution (Ryel et al., 2002) was also added
    to CABLE in order to improve the representation of the water flux between soil
    layers. This component involves redistribution of water by roots and depends on
    the root density and the rhizosphere conductivity. This term was added as an additional
    term in Richard''s equation, which describes the soil moisture (θ) flux and is
    based on the one-dimensional conservation equation and Darcy''s law: where K is
    the hydraulic conductivity, D is diffusivity, and Fw(z) includes water lost due
    to soil evaporation and root extraction or water gained or lost in a layer by
    hydraulic redistribution (Ryel et al., 2002). In this study, CABLE version 2.3.4
    was used. This version of CABLE is freely available at http://trac.nci.org.au/trac/cable
    (last access: 20 November 2019) after registration. Detailed descriptions of the
    model are available in Kowalzcyk et al. (2006), Wang et al. (2011), Kowalzcyk
    (2013), and Haverd et al. (2016). To support the generality of our approach, the
    offline global simulations in this application of CABLE use look-up tables for
    soil and vegetation classification. By default, CABLE includes a soil classification
    table derived from Zobler (1999) and vegetation types defined by the International
    Geosphere and Biosphere Program (Loveland et al., 2000). CABLE auxiliary files
    also include monthly LAI data derived from MODIS data averaged from 2002 to 2009
    (Gao et al., 2008; Ganguly et al., 2008), as specified in the CABLE user guide
    (Srbinovsky et al., 2012). In this study, the default soil texture was used and
    assumed to be uniform across the study region (the soil corresponds to sandy loam
    soil in the irrigated regions explored here). However, LAI data in this study
    were derived as described in Sect. 3.1, as the coarse-scale MODIS-derived dataset
    is not representative of the actual crop-growing patterns. The possibility of
    different crops and crop rotation in the same field within the year was considered,
    as explained in Sect. 3.3, using the clustering technique based on LAI data. One
    limitation of the framework is the lack of a crop identification module, which
    would improve the definition of vegetation characteristics. Here, vegetation parameters
    were assigned based on the default CABLE cropland vegetation class, as currently
    no crop identification strategy was implemented other than the delineation and
    clustering technique. Finally, CABLE was forced with hourly meteorological data
    from a WRF reanalysis (Sect. 3.4.3). Under basin-scale water budget studies, a
    spin-up of the model is generally required to achieve a realistic initial soil
    moisture state. This is normally done by running a representative year of meteorological
    data several times or running several years prior to the start of the study period
    (Ajami et al., 2014, 2015) and assuming that the spin-up period is representative
    of the “normal” conditions. This assumption does not hold in our simulations because
    we are aiming to retrieve irrigated amounts, which could change from one year
    to the other as different crops are grown. Therefore, this posed a challenge for
    representing the initial state of irrigated agricultural fields at the start of
    our simulations. In our study, the spin-up for each field was performed as follows:
    after estimation of the irrigation amount for one season, the model is run using
    this irrigation amount, and the final state is saved as the initial state for
    the next iterative process. However, the problem still lies with the spin-up of
    the first period. To solve this, we started by first running the groundwater abstraction
    strategy for a 3-month period prior to the start of the study period, thus generating
    an initial state for the actual period of study. 3.4.3 Meteorological data The
    meteorological data required to drive the TSEB and CABLE models were derived from
    a numerical weather prediction simulation of the Weather Research and Forecasting
    (WRF) model, specifically, the Advanced Research WRF (ARW; Skamarock et al., 2008)
    model version 3.7.0. The regional simulation, performed over the entire Arabian
    Peninsula and neighboring regions, used dynamical downscaling of global analysis
    data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). Dynamical
    downscaling refers to a method to generate a higher spatial and temporal resolution
    regional climatic model by assimilating available regional datasets and initialized
    from coarser reanalysis data (Giorgi and Mearns, 1991; Wilby and Wigley, 1997;
    Viswanadhapalli et al., 2017, 2019; Dasari et al., 2019). This is typically done
    by nesting a high spatial resolution domain within a coarser domain. Observational
    data used in this regional climate model included quality-controlled data from
    the NCEP Atmospheric Data Project (ADP), such as surface station data, wind data
    from the Quick Scatterometer (QSCAT) and WindSat and ASCAT scatterometers, and
    atmospheric motion vectors from geostationary satellites. The methodology, model
    parameters, and model physics followed a similar approach to that described in
    Jiang et al. (2009), Langodan et al. (2014, 2016), Viswanadhapalli et al. (2017),
    and Dasari et al. (2019). The simulations were performed over a 5-year period
    (2011–2015) at an hourly time step and with the internal model domain with a spatial
    resolution of 3 km covering the Arabian Peninsula. 3.5 Evaluation of model performance
    To evaluate the modeling approach across thousands of individual field sites would
    require the provision of an extensive dataset of on-ground water use measurements,
    ideally collected from numerous pivots and over an extensive period of time. However,
    detailed abstraction, irrigation, and crop water use data in such quantities rarely
    exist in even the most well-monitored sites, let alone for developing country
    applications. Although we could not collate comprehensive and spatially distributed
    evaluation data for the Al Jawf study region, we utilize data from the smaller-scale
    Tawdeehiya farm to provide farm-reported data for the year 2015. The available
    evaluation data consisted of monthly values of total irrigation application time
    (in hours) and a single value of flow rate in gallons per minute for each field.
    To convert to groundwater abstraction (GWA), the flow rate was multiplied by the
    number of minutes irrigated in each month and converted to units of millions of
    cubic meters (MCM). The model''s performance to quantify field groundwater abstraction
    was evaluated using the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency, given by Eq. (15): where O
    represents the observations (farm data) and S our estimations, both in MCM for
    the year 2015. NSE values can be negative (from −∞) or a value from 0 to 1, where
    1 represents a perfect match between estimates and observations and a value of
    0 shows that the estimates are as good as the mean of the observed values ( ).
    4 Results The strategy as described in this study (Sect. 3) was applied to two
    study regions. Section 4.1 presents the results of GWA of 40 fields at the Tawdeehiya
    farm and evaluates the performance based on farm data for these fields. Next,
    Sect. 4.2 and 4.3 focus on the larger-scale application of the methodology across
    the Al Jawf region, demonstrating the framework''s capability in terms of information
    it can reveal at a regional level. First, Sect. 4.2 explores patterns of irrigation
    activity, e.g., for how much time these fields are active throughout the year;
    whether there is a preference for seasonal or perennial types of fields (as defined
    in Sect. 3.3); and the spatial distribution of yearly groundwater abstraction
    and field use within the region. Finally, Sect. 4.3 demonstrates the range of
    monthly to annual water use in the region, i.e., irrigation rates and derived
    groundwater abstraction values. A comparison of evaporation estimated by CABLE
    (with inferred irrigation based on our approach) and TSEB is shown in Fig. S2
    in the Supplement. As a result of this work, a first of its kind spatially distributed
    map of field-based groundwater abstraction was created as a key output of the
    monitoring strategy. 4.1 Pivot-based framework performance at the Tawdeehiya farm
    In order to evaluate the performance of the approach, the pivot-based water accounting
    methodology (described in Sect. 3) was first applied to the 40 active fields at
    the Tawdeehiya farm (Fig. 1). Seventeen fields were identified as following a
    perennial planting pattern, with yearly field use values around 86 %. Twenty-three
    fields were classified as seasonal fields, with average field use vales of 57 %.
    The performance evaluation was based on a comparison of the estimated yearly groundwater
    abstraction rates and farm-based data reports of flow rates delivered to the irrigation
    booms. Upon examination of the estimated monthly irrigation rates from the seasonal
    fields, a systematic mismatch was observed during periods where fields were identified
    as being “inactive”. From knowledge of the local farm-based operations, it is
    not unusual that fields required a significant amount of pre-planting irrigation
    (likely to reduce the salt load in the soil and in preparation for seeding), but
    during this period, the LAI would be below the threshold used to define an “active”
    season (Sect. 3.3), and thus water accounting in the model would not be triggered.
    Lowering the LAI threshold would not help in identifying this pre-planting stage,
    because it is already essentially zero when vegetation is not present. Reducing
    it further to arbitrarily low values would defeat the purpose of seasonal activity
    detection. As an alternative, the season can be extended to include a pre-planting
    stage of a pre-defined amount of time. However, this parameter would depend on
    a variety of factors, such as the type of crop being planted and other farm management
    practices. Without a sufficient amount of data with which to derive strategies
    to account for irrigation during this pre-planting stage, the groundwater abstraction
    values for seasonal fields in this study can only be interpreted as a lower bound.
    Figure 5 presents the groundwater abstraction estimates calculated for the center-pivot
    fields compared against farm-reported flow rates (multiplied by irrigation duration).
    As can be seen, there is a significant amount of variability between the pivot
    results, largely a consequence of seasonal versus perennial fields. However, for
    a number of the seasonal fields, there was a clear and defined underestimate of
    groundwater abstraction relative to the reported flow-rate extrapolations (identified
    by the gray dots). Indeed, 11 fields had an unrealistically long pre-planting
    stage of more than 2 months, based on the reported flow-rate data. It is extremely
    unlikely that these reflect real farming practices and are almost certainly a
    result of local reporting errors. Taking into account the uncertainty of the farm
    data for these 11 pivots, the yearly groundwater abstraction values were re-calculated
    to estimate only when fields were determined to be active, i.e., based on the
    satellite-derived LAI values. Using this assessment threshold, the NSE value was
    0.38 with an R2 of 0.61 for all 40 pivot fields, with a linear regression described
    by the blue line in Fig. 5 (slope of 0.62, intercept of 0.51). For reference,
    the 11 gray dots (not included in the NSE calculation) present the original data
    that include the “inactive” period, i.e., with the long pre-planting stage. Figure
    5Comparison of annual groundwater estimates to farm data. The blue line shows
    the regression based on the black and green dots (adjusted to include only active
    seasons for 11 seasonal fields). The gray points show the original farm data with
    long pre-planting stages for those same 11 seasonal fields. Download Further exploring
    the relationship between monthly groundwater abstraction and its relation to the
    level of a field''s activity (based on LAI data), Fig. 6 shows the results for
    two different fields and their spatial and temporal changes in LAI. The first
    field (Fig. 6c and d) presents a 6-month period when LAI is above the defined
    threshold (0.3 m2 m−2) and a long inactive period (August–December) which would
    be designated as low-to-no estimated irrigation. For the period of activity (January–July,
    excluding a planting stage in March) the agreement between reported flow rate
    and estimated groundwater abstraction is good. However, for the August–December
    period, when the LAI imagery shows low LAI to bare soil conditions, the farm data
    report a varying amount of irrigation based on the fixed flow rate records. For
    the second field (Fig. 6e and f), the monthly variations in groundwater abstraction
    are in good agreement with farm data for the majority of the year, with the exception
    of a 3-month period (January to March), which was identified as inactive, but
    where farm-reported data again indicate irrigation is active. Figure 6Estimated
    groundwater abstraction in million cubic meters (MCM) for two fields in the Tawdeehiya
    farm along with a comparison based on available flow rates from farm data. (a,
    b) show the spatial maps of LAI data (m2 m−2) using the methodology described
    in Sect. 3.1. Two fields from two different periods are delineated either in black
    (corresponding to c, d) or white (e, f). (c, e) show a spatiotemporal map of LAI
    for the two fields, while (d, f) show a comparison of groundwater abstraction
    obtained using the framework described in Sect. 3 and available farm data. The
    field marked with black is one of the 11 fields identified as having a large abstraction
    discrepancy; i.e., the farm data indicate ongoing periods of irrigation, while
    the LAI data indicate inactivity. Download While undertaking a field-based assessment
    of the strategy is obviously an area of importance, it is tempered by the reality
    of using data that is often of less than “high quality”. However, by combining
    independent observation available from satellite platforms, we can further discriminate
    these spurious data points, and refine the assessment process. These types of
    analyses highlight the need for forensic assessment of ground-based (and satellite)
    observations and the value of establishing consistency between available datasets
    (McCabe et al., 2008; López et al., 2017). Indeed, in this case, the proposed
    model–satellite fusion approach correctly identifies errors in “ground-based”
    data and provides a clear example of the observation and monitoring challenge
    in this and many other regions. 4.2 Irrigation activity detection in Al Jawf Given
    the quite different application scale of the pivot-based groundwater estimation
    approach when performed over the Al Jawf region (compared to Tawdeehiya), overview
    and analysis of intermediate processing steps are warranted. The object-based
    image analysis approach (see Sect. 3.2) produced a map containing 5567 individually
    delineated fields, covering a total area of 2494 km2, i.e., more than 60 % higher
    than previous reporting (FAO, 2013). The majority of the delineated fields (81 %)
    were identified as “perennial” (see Fig. 4b), with less than 1.5 % recognized
    as inactive using the LAI-based approach. Examples of these delineations are shown
    in Fig. 1 (top; outlined in black). On average, the sizes of the fields were 45 ha
    (0.45 km2), with no observable distinction in acreage between perennial and seasonal
    fields. Figure 7 displays the distribution of size (in hectares) for all fields
    (first quartile of 25.54 ha, third quartile of 66.05 ha). The field sizes do not
    follow a normal distribution but form clusters (e.g., around 82, 67, and 50 ha;
    see inset in Fig. 7), which is expected as center-pivot irrigation systems are
    installed in standard sizes. The largest fields (e.g., >60 ha) were concentrated
    around the central region (30∘ N, 38.25∘ E), which is where the largest commercial-scale
    farms operate. In more remote areas to the north and east of Al Jawf, a larger
    variation of smaller fields can be identified that are likely owned by smaller,
    independent farms. Figure 7Spatial distribution and statistics of individual field
    areas. Clusters of large fields (those >60 ha) can be found in the main agricultural
    zone (30∘ N, 38.25∘ E), corresponding to the location of several large commercial-scale
    farms. The figure''s inset on the left shows a violin plot of the field sizes
    in Al Jawf: in a given field area (y axis), the plot outline (in black) is wider
    when there is a larger number of fields of that given size. The black horizontal
    lines inside the plot show the first quartile, median, and third quartile, while
    the black diamond shows the average value. The background in the inset shows colored
    dots (horizontal positions are given randomly for visualization purposes) to distinguish
    perennial and seasonal fields. Download The annual field use (%), calculated as
    the ratio between the number of active days and total days in the year, is shown
    in Fig. 8. As expected, perennial fields have a higher field use (average, first
    and third quartiles: 86 %, 77 % and 100 %, respectively) than seasonal fields
    (average, first and third quartiles: 35 %, 24 % and 46 %, respectively). In contrast
    with the area distribution (Fig. 7), the majority of fields had high annual field
    values, meaning they were active throughout most of the year, independent of their
    location (small or large commercial-scale farms). This is consistent with the
    fact that most fields were identified as perennial, and indicates a preference
    towards forage crops (i.e., grass and alfalfa) during this year, regardless of
    the scale of operation. Figure 8Spatial distribution and statistics of the annual
    field use, defined as the ratio of active irrigation days to total number of days
    in the year. Most fields had high values of annual use (>80 %). The inset on the
    left shows the distribution of annual field use among all fields in the region
    as a violin plot. The two black diamonds show the average value grouped by the
    type of field (seasonal or perennial), while the black square represents the average
    of all fields. The background shows colored dots (horizontal positions are given
    randomly for visualization purposes) to distinguish perennial and seasonal fields.
    Download The field use (%) was also calculated on a monthly basis as the ratio
    of number of days active to number of days in each month in Fig. 9, with the distribution
    of values among all fields shown as violin plots for perennial and seasonal fields
    separately. Most perennial fields were consistently active throughout the year
    (monthly field use above 80 %), but for any given month there were fields that
    were inactive (i.e., with less than 5 % monthly use). For example, the largest
    number of inactive perennial fields was 958 in January, followed by 913 in December,
    with the smallest being 353 in March. Because perennial fields are, by definition,
    expected to be active throughout most of the year, the violin plots (Fig. 9) show
    a consistent pattern with a wide top (i.e., high y values) and otherwise thin
    body. Seasonal fields on the other hand, had a more variable range of irrigation
    activity. Most fields were irrigated from February to May, with more than 46 %
    of the fields with a monthly field use value larger than 50 %. This was followed
    by July and August, where more than 33 % of fields exceeded the 50 % monthly field
    use. Irrigation activities were lowest during January, June and from September
    to December, where less than 30 % of fields had monthly field use values larger
    than 50 %. This suggests an overall trend for seasonal crops either being used
    for one growing season (from February to May), or two seasons (February to May
    and July to August). Figure 9Monthly center-pivot field use for perennial (a)
    and seasonal (b) fields. The black squares show the average monthly field use
    (% days irrigated during each month). A larger width at a given level of use indicates
    a larger number of fields. Horizontal lines show the 25 %, 50 % (median), and
    75 % quantiles. Download 4.3 Monthly and annual irrigation and groundwater abstraction
    The irrigation rates for each field were determined using the inverse modeling
    approach, i.e., running the CABLE model iteratively to determine the rate needed
    to reproduce the TSEB-based satellite-observed crop water use (see Sect. 3). Figure
    10 presents the derived monthly irrigation estimates. Results were generally higher
    for perennial fields compared to seasonal fields, with average values ranging
    from 122 to 152 mm in January, February, and from October to December and the
    highest values occurring from April to September (210–234 mm). The monthly maximum
    value for a perennial field was 407 mm and occurred in August. Average yearly
    irrigation values for the perennial fields reached 2007 mm, with first and third
    quartile values of 1347 and 2799 mm for the fields within the Al Jawf region.
    Average monthly irrigation values for seasonal fields were lowest in November
    and December (50–58 mm) and highest during March to April (165–171 mm), indicating
    the production of spring crops. A second peak, indicative of a second season (as
    mentioned in the monthly field use analysis), was also evident in the monthly
    irrigation profile, with average values of 145 and 131 mm in July and August,
    following a lower value of 109 mm in June. The highest monthly irrigation value
    for a seasonal field was 348 mm during July. On average, seasonal fields had a
    total annual irrigation value of 675 mm, with the first and third quartiles at
    299 and 1041 mm. Figure 10Monthly irrigation statistics (mm) for perennial (a)
    and seasonal (b) fields. The black squares show the average values of monthly
    irrigation among the same types of fields in the region (4509 perennial fields;
    974 seasonal fields). The violin plots show the distribution of monthly irrigation
    values, which range from 0 (no irrigation) up to 406 mm month−1 (i.e., 13.5 mm d−1).
    Horizontal lines show the 25 %, 50 % (median), and 75 % quantiles. Download The
    irrigation values were converted to groundwater abstraction by multiplying monthly
    irrigation amount by the area covered by pixels that were actively irrigated in
    each season, and then by a factor of 1.25 (i.e., ) to account for irrigation losses
    (as described in Sect. 3). Figure 11 shows a map of annual groundwater abstraction
    in the region, in MCM. The total annual groundwater consumption in 2015 for the
    Al Jawf agricultural region was estimated at 5.56 billion cubic meters (BCM).
    Clusters of fields with high abstraction (>3 MCM yr−1; shown in blue) are mostly
    centered in the main commercial region (38.25∘ E, 30∘ N), where fields were generally
    larger (>60 ha; Fig. 7) and irrigated throughout most of the year (>80 %; Fig.
    8). The first quartile, mean and third quartile of groundwater abstraction among
    all fields in Al Jawf was 0.24, 1.0 and 1.59 MCM, respectively. The corresponding
    values were larger, as expected, for perennial fields: 0.43, 1.16, and 1.74 MCM,
    and significantly smaller for seasonal fields: 0.06, 0.34, and 0.5 MCM. Figure
    11Map of annual groundwater abstraction in MCM for the Al Jawf agricultural region.
    Values were obtained for individual fields, as seen in the examples shown at top
    featuring one zone with high levels of abstractions (top-left) and another zone
    with a smaller density of fields and lower values of abstraction (top-right).
    The background shows the same Landsat 8 images as in Fig. 2. 5 Discussion 5.1 Historical
    efforts towards quantifying agriculture water use Quantifying the water use of
    individual agricultural fields has been a research objective for many decades
    (Jackson et al., 1987; Rana and Katerji, 2000; Kalma et al., 2008), with numerous
    efforts directed towards improving process-based modeling approaches to characterize
    the evaporative response (Ershadi et al., 2014; Anderson et al., 2018; McCabe
    et al., 2019). The challenge has often been related to the availability of data
    with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution to observe fields in adequate
    detail as well as a lack of knowledge on the dynamics of the underlying crop type
    and condition. In addition, most efforts have tended to focus on monitoring for
    relatively short periods, or perhaps a single growing season, rather than providing
    a basis for long-term retrospective or ongoing monitoring. Recent developments
    exploiting constellations of CubeSats have enabled high resolution in space and
    time retrievals of key land surface parameters (Houborg and McCabe, 2018c), providing
    enhanced estimates of crop water use and crop development and overcoming the spatiotemporal
    constraint (Aragón et al., 2018; McCabe et al., 2017b). However, while crop water
    use is an important variable in delivering insights into water allocation and
    management, regulators are often most interested in determining the source and
    volumes of water actually being extracted from reservoirs to supply this agricultural
    need, not just the net use. This has represented a much more challenging task,
    as in situ data on these systems are often non-existent and not easily inferred
    through remote measurement, at least at the scales at which local and regional
    management needs to be performed. In many regions of the world, existing or historical
    groundwater monitoring networks help to inform regional groundwater depletion
    trends (Shamsudduha et al., 2012; Scanlon et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2013) and
    offer insights into related environmental impacts (Lee and Song, 2007; Erban et
    al., 2014). Satellite-based gravimetry measurements from GRACE have informed on
    water storage depletion trends around the world (Rodell et al., 2018), with particular
    benefit to data scarce regions where the quantification of aquifer depletion would
    not otherwise be possible (Lezzaik and Milewski, 2018). However, while GRACE data
    provide an excellent source of large-scale information on aquifer response (Voss
    et al., 2013; Famiglietti, 2014), it is not suited to attribute to any particular
    use at the scales required for resource management. For example, the Al Jawf agricultural
    region as defined in this study (mapped agricultural area of about 2500 km2) is
    small compared to the scale of the Saq aquifer system that feeds it (about 500 000 km2)
    and the recommended minimal size for GRACE studies (>200 000 km2; Famiglietti,
    2014; Long et al., 2015; Richey et al., 2015). Moreover, even in regions where
    groundwater monitoring networks do exist, there is a need to bridge the gap between
    a regional assessment and practical farm-scale monitoring. In this context, our
    study demonstrates new capability, using a satellite data-modeling framework to
    provide an unprecedented level of information for water management. The approach
    represents a dramatic improvement on more traditional farmer-based surveys, which
    are time-consuming to collect, can often be unreliable and unrepresentative, and
    lack the spatial and temporal detail needed to provide accurate water accounting
    at the regional scale. While a number of studies have attempted to estimate irrigation
    by incorporating an irrigation module into a water balance model, these approaches
    have often been based on “adding” the necessary irrigation depth to maintain the
    soil moisture above a threshold value (Santos et al., 2008; Ozdogan et al., 2010;
    Pokrhel et al., 2012), which may not reflect the actual irrigation volume being
    applied. Here we developed a data-modeling approach to automatically retrieve
    seasonal irrigation rates for individual center-pivot fields, focusing on fields
    irrigated by center-pivot infrastructure: consistent with the type of infrastructure
    that supports the majority of irrigated fields in Saudi Arabia and in other cereal
    crop production areas worldwide. The developed approach is based on constraining
    a land surface hydrology model with evaporation estimates, and then “inferring”
    the irrigation rate, an idea explored conceptually by Droogers et al. (2010) and
    applied in a real-world case study by López (2018). As the first large-scale demonstration
    of this framework at the regional scale, the present study represents an effort
    towards more effective water use monitoring in both Saudi Arabia and other arid
    countries (e.g., in the MENA region) that rely heavily on groundwater abstraction
    for agricultural production. 5.2 Demonstrating the capability of the pivot-based
    groundwater abstraction estimation framework The framework offers a unique monitoring
    and modeling effort in terms of scale and granularity, as it demonstrated a capacity
    to obtain agricultural water use estimates from the scale of a single pivot to
    more than 5000 individual fields. Importantly, the approach is scalable and can
    be applied to other domains and locations. The mapping activities used in producing
    our water use estimates for the year 2015 indicate a much larger extent of agriculture
    (2494 km2) in the region than has previously been reported (1200 km2 for the year
    2009; SSYB, 2010). Consequently, a much higher groundwater abstraction was also
    estimated (5.56 BCM) than that forecast for the year 2014 (1.2 BCM; MEP, 2010).
    However, it is important to note that these prior estimates were obtained by incorporating
    information from various private and public sources, including on-site interviews,
    and are subject to significant uncertainties. These include possible misrepresentation
    due to the absence of metering in farms (i.e., self underreporting) and possible
    omission of fields located in remote areas. Regardless, our estimates are proportionally
    consistent (in terms of area) with more recent reports of nationwide groundwater
    abstraction for the year 2015 (20.8 BCM; MEWA, 2019). That is, both the estimates
    of area and of groundwater abstraction for the Al Jawf region represent about
    one-quarter of irrigated agriculture in the kingdom. Ultimately, our study is
    a demonstration of using the best available data and tools to undertake an analysis
    in a data-limited region. The lack of data is very much a developing world problem,
    but there are numerous “developed” world cases where data to inform model set-up
    and evaluation is absent. Using the strategy proposed here, we were able to provide
    results that reflect expectations when compared to the limited available datasets
    (both at farm and regional scale), i.e., a positive outcome given the scenario
    where independent data are not available to inform decision makers. 5.3 Limitations,
    potential extensions, and applications The goal of this study was to provide a
    first approximation of regional groundwater abstraction independent of self-reported
    data, and for this, we have used a specific choice of models (i.e., TSEB and CABLE).
    Other remote sensing approaches for evaporation estimation could be used. For
    example, the use of ALEXI/DisALEXI (Norman et al., 2003) could be explored to
    mitigate the sensitivity to the accuracy of LST retrieval, but the trade-off between
    higher ET accuracy and the impact on computational effort should be evaluated.
    Likewise, our approach is not limited to any particular land surface model. Further
    investigation is required to determine the uncertainties of the models used as
    well as from other inputs such as LAI and how these propagate through our groundwater
    abstraction framework. One approach that could help mitigate biases within specific
    models is to explore the use of multi-model estimates, which would also help provide
    ranges of groundwater abstraction. Because this study was aimed to retrieve estimates
    for the year 2015, a key reference year that will be used to evaluate the impact
    of policy changes in Saudi Arabia, Landsat 8 imagery was the primary source of
    satellite data. With a sun-synchronous return frequency of 16 d, this means that
    for a 90-day season, the method is based on between four and six images. Given
    this low number of observations, our study aimed at retrieving seasonal irrigation
    amounts; i.e., we do not estimate irrigation amounts in different crop developmental
    stages. Added to this limitation, cloud cover can be an important factor in the
    uncertainty of the irrigation activity detection. While this is not a major issue
    in the current setting (high percentage of “blue-sky” days throughout the year),
    it may be pertinent to applications in other geographic locations. For more recent
    years, data from newer satellites with higher temporal resolution, such as Sentinel-2
    (Ferrant et al., 2017; Veloso et al., 2017) and CubeSats (McCabe et al., 2017b;
    Houborg and McCabe, 2018b), could be employed to support improved estimates, as
    active irrigation seasons would be more accurately defined, and irrigation estimates
    could be obtained on a sub-seasonal basis (e.g., being able to differentiate between
    crop stages). The higher spatial resolution available (e.g., 3 m in the case of
    Planet data) can also benefit the model, especially for the detection of partially
    irrigated or partitioned (two-crop) fields, and avoid the edge overlap in some
    fields that hinders the automated capability of the delineation procedure. However,
    the increased computational cost of using higher-resolution data, particularly
    with the LSM runs, is an important consideration (Wood et al., 2011; Bierkens
    et al., 2015), especially when seeking to apply the methodology over a larger
    number of fields (e.g., at a national scale). Detecting periods of active irrigation
    is a crucial step of the framework, and ensures that the model is able to retrieve
    irrigation values for the appropriate periods. Ideally, the more often that satellite
    information is available, the better the prediction of active irrigation seasons
    will become. This is especially important for perennial fields, which undergo
    fast response to cut and re-growth cycles that could be missed by the 16 d revisit
    interval of Landsat (Houborg and McCabe, 2018b). However, an aspect that requires
    further investigation is how to retrieve irrigation rates during the pre-planting
    stage. One way to tackle this challenge would be to use high-resolution soil moisture
    products to track the change in soil water content (Sánchez-Ruiz et al., 2014).
    Although this was an unexplored aspect in this study, the obtained estimates can
    be interpreted as a lower bound for seasonal fields, which comprised less than
    20 % of the fields identified in the Al Jawf region. As this study focused only
    on center-pivot irrigation, the total quantity of abstracted water used for agricultural
    production in Al Jawf will be marginally higher than the reported 5.56 BCM. This
    value represents a first-order estimate that can be further refined by adding
    the contribution of other irrigated crops and fields, e.g., date palms and more
    recently agricultural shifts to planting of olive trees. In parallel with additional
    crop mapping and identification activities, efforts are also being directed towards
    strategies that monitor water use from other types of irrigation (e.g., drip and
    flood irrigation), in order to obtain a more comprehensive estimate of groundwater
    abstraction in this region and beyond. As a first step, using the object-based
    image analysis procedure, we delineated and estimated an area of about 31 km2
    of irrigated fields in the Al Jawf region that were not classified as center-pivot
    fields. This represents about 1.22 % of the total irrigated area, and depending
    on the type of irrigation (e.g., drip irrigation), represents a relatively small
    fraction of the total groundwater abstraction. One approach to incorporate the
    agricultural water use from these remaining fields would be to first implement
    an advanced crop classification scheme (Cai et al., 2018; Piedelobo et al., 2019)
    and then calculate irrigation requirements for each crop (Castaño et al., 2010;
    Kirby et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2019). The reason for using other approaches
    with these remaining irrigated fields, is that the framework relies on the assumption
    of relatively uniform irrigation application, which simplified the effort to translate
    irrigation rates into abstracted groundwater. Additional improvements to the methodology
    would also include better quantifying the spray-loss component of the center-pivot
    system. For example, information derived from wind speed and direction, humidity
    and air temperature could be used to refine spray loss estimates over each field
    (Abo-Ghobar 1992; Sadhegi et al., 2015, 2017) with a dynamic, rather than fixed
    value. The methodology is being further developed to run both retrospectively
    and up to current periods in order to monitor change in agricultural activities
    across the kingdom and to quantify this sector''s corresponding water use. Such
    data will enable responses to policy changes and management implementations to
    be identified, and can act to facilitate optimization practices for agricultural
    water use and groundwater abstraction in other data-sparse regions. 6 Conclusions
    An automated approach to estimate agricultural-driven groundwater abstraction
    based on integrating satellite data and land surface modeling was developed, with
    its functionality demonstrated over several thousand center-pivot fields in an
    arid region of Saudi Arabia. The monitoring framework provided an unprecedented
    level of information capturing water use behavior at the individual field scale
    and included information metrics such as geospatial location, distribution of
    cultivated areas, irrigation activity patterns, crop water use, and ultimately
    the abstracted groundwater used to grow the agriculture product. Monthly to yearly
    estimates of abstracted groundwater were obtained for more than 5000 center-pivot
    fields, covering an area of approximately 2500 km2, with a total groundwater use
    estimated at 5.56 BCM. Individual field use ranged from 0.24 MCM to more than
    3 MCM annual abstractions for those areas operating at more than 80 % capacity.
    The annual total abstraction value represents about one-quarter of the total groundwater
    abstraction used for agriculture in the kingdom (20.8 BCM; MEWA, 2019). In terms
    of agricultural area, the 2,500 km2 also represent about one-quarter of the kingdom''s
    center-pivot-based irrigation capacity (∼10 029 km2; FAO, 2008a). With the development
    of this novel water accounting approach, changes and trends in agricultural patterns
    from regional to national scales can now be monitored, providing information on
    crop type (perennial or seasonal), changes in the cultivated areas, and volumes
    of water being used over time. Such information is needed for improved water management,
    to inform the development of water related regulations, and to assess the impact
    of policies on water conservation. The approach is currently being deployed retrospectively
    to monitor all center-pivot infrastructure across Saudi Arabia for the years 2011–2015,
    and then to expand this forward in time to allow near-real-time monitoring. Future
    work will focus on the inclusion of other types of agriculture (e.g., date palms,
    orchards, and olive trees) for a more complete accounting of water abstraction
    for agricultural use. In parallel, a classification of crop types grown within
    individual center-pivot fields is being performed to better identify potential
    water-saving and irrigation optimization techniques at the individual field scale.
    The availability of new and emerging sources of remote sensing information presents
    an opportunity to further advance our precision agricultural capacity and will
    be incorporated into the future versions of this modeling framework, providing
    enhanced assessment on crop growth and field condition. Code and data availability

  limitations: The primary limitation is the lack of on-ground observations for both
    the center-pivot and regional-scale application to evaluate the accuracy of the
    estimates and to identify any bias within the modeling framework. There is also
    a constraint of having only a single year of data (2015) for groundwater abstraction
    estimates. Information from additional and more recent years is needed to enable
    retrospective and near-real-time monitoring of water use, which will be further
    refined as new and emerging sources of remote sensing information become available.
    The methodology is also limited to estimating groundwater that is used for center-pivot
    irrigation; extrapolating to other crops and irrigation methods would imply further
    development of the modeling framework. Finally, the automated delineation of center-pivot
    fields is reliant on cloud-free satellite imagery, which can be an issue in humid
    and tropical regions where frequent cloud cover is common.

    sector in Saudi Arabia has witnessed rapid growth in both production and area
    under cultivation over the last few decades. This has prompted some concern over
    the state and future availability of fossil groundwater resources, which have
    been used to drive this expansion. Large-scale studies using satellite gravimetric
    data show a declining trend over this region. However, water management agencies
    require much more detailed information on both the spatial distribution of agricultural
    fields and their varying levels of water exploitation through time than coarse
    gravimetric data can provide. Relying on self-reporting from farm operators or
    sporadic data collection campaigns to obtain needed information are not feasible
    options, nor do they allow for retrospective assessments. In this work, a water
    accounting framework that combines satellite data, meteorological output from
    weather prediction models, and a modified land surface hydrology model was developed
    to provide information on both irrigated crop water use and groundwater abstraction
    rates. Results from the local scale, comprising several thousand individual center-pivot
    fields, were then used to quantify the regional-scale response. To do this, a
    semi-automated approach for the delineation of center-pivot fields using a multi-temporal
    statistical analysis of Landsat 8 data was developed. Next, actual crop evaporation
    rates were estimated using a two-source energy balance (TSEB) model driven by
    leaf area index, land surface temperature, and albedo, all of which were derived
    from Landsat 8. The Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE) model
    was then adapted to use satellite-based vegetation and related surface variables
    and forced with a 3 km reanalysis dataset from the Weather Research and Forecasting
    (WRF) model. Groundwater abstraction rates were then inferred by estimating the
    irrigation supplied to each individual center pivot, which was determined via
    an optimization approach that considered CABLE-based estimates of evaporation
    and TSEB-based satellite estimates. The framework was applied over two study regions
    in Saudi Arabia: a small-scale experimental facility of around 40 center pivots
    in Al Kharj that was used for an initial evaluation and a much larger agricultural
    region in Al Jawf province comprising more than 5000 individual fields across
    an area exceeding 2500 km2. Total groundwater abstraction for the year 2015 in
    Al Jawf was estimated at approximately 5.5 billion cubic meters (BCM), far exceeding
    any recharge to the groundwater system and further highlighting the need for a
    comprehensive water management strategy. Overall, this novel data–model fusion

- analysis: This article introduces a consistent data frame for multi-source and multi-temporal
    image fusion on hypercomplex bases. The core of the fusion technique is an orthogonal
    transform on hypercomplex bases delivering Kennaugh-like elements. The combination
    can cover multi-spectral, multi-source, and multi-temporal data sets. The description
    of spatial characteristics by multi-row and multi-column combination is envisaged.
    Multi-source image fusion results in vectors of Kennaugh-like elements. Multi-source
    and multi-temporal image fusion produces Kennaugh matrices with the image channel
    dimensionality along the rows and the time dimensionality along the columns. These
    linear intensities and intensity differences, respectively, can be further scaled
    to logarithmic—almost normally distributed—and even normalized elements characterized
    by a closed data range and a high resilience towards the reduction of the radiometric
    sampling to 4 bit or even less than that. The method is exemplary applied to Sentinel-1,
    Sentinel-2, and ALOS-PALSAR-2 single acquisitions of three different regions of
    interest in Germany and time series of Sentinel-2 over a wetland near the Alps.
    Due to its flexibility regarding the scaling, any data set with additive or multiplicative
    characteristics can be used as input layers. A qualitative assessment of the multi-temporal
    image fusion indicated that the Kennaugh-like elements highlight characteristics
    that were not visible at all in the standard preparation. Furthermore, the quantitative
    analysis of multi-source Kennaugh-like elements underlined the stability of the
    signatures describing typical land cover classes that are distinguishable even
    with a extremely reduced radiometric sampling of only two bins. The latter point
    is of importance with respect to modern classification techniques like histogram
    classifications and Random Forest approaches. The Random Forest method (e.g.)
    combines a large number of random decision trees in order to stabilize the decision.
    Each node is a binary sampling which is now simply possible using normalized Kennaugh-like
    elements in a binary radiometric sampling. This article can only presents the
    basic idea of a data fusion approach and delivers first hints on its suitability
    explained by the help of selected experiments. Its practical use has to be evaluated
    in future studies covering more different landscapes, different sensors, and different
    classification algorithms. With respect to sharpening approaches of image data
    fusion with different spatial resolution, the inclusion of weights representing
    the look factors might be one technical further development. One application-oriented
    focus will be the analysis of polarimetric SAR time series over Mid-European forests
    in order to detect and map calamities in a timely manner. The presented methodology
    further shall be implemented as extension of the Multi-SAR System in order to
    support ARD data provision to scientific users. The long-term goal will be to
    establish the normalized Kennaugh-like elements on hypercomplex bases as future
    standard for multi-dimensional ARD sets in so-called data cubes.

    the necessity for Analysis Ready Data (ARD), presents the Multi-SAR System, an
    evaluated framework for the production of polarimetric ARD data, and how the Multi-SAR
    System is expanded with a new approach for image fusion for optical and SAR data.
    Finally, we formulates the research questions which will be answered in the following.
    1.1. Necessity for Analysis Ready Data Earth Observation (EO) is turning more
    and more to ‘Big Earth Data’ [1]. By the end of 2018, the Copernicus Sentinel
    products had a total data volume of 10 PiB with a daily average growth of 15 TiB
    in November 2018 [2]. The complexity of data processing, computational power,
    and storage increases with the data volume. This means that even sophisticated
    users of EO data invest more time and effort into data preparation than into data
    interpretation. The idea is to support EO users to transform the immense amounts
    of data into useful information and decision-ready products [3]. This challenge
    can be met with the provision of pre-processed EO data to a minimum set of requirements
    and their organization in a standardized, consistent, and transparent manner.
    It requires the possibility of an immediate analysis without additionally user
    effort, interoperability, and processing time as well as open and easy data access.
    The specifications are regulated within the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites
    (CEOS) for ARD [4]. ARD products representing surface reflectance are commonly
    used and their custom pre-processing workflow and provision is already standardized.
    Since 2008, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) provides the Landsat data
    as 𝐿1𝑇 analysis-ready products in a single, universally accessible, centralized
    global archive [5]. The focus of the Swiss Data Cube (SDC) is a consistent and
    comparable data processing and storage of different sensors. Therefore, they use
    the same framework for data discovery, downloading, and processing of Landsat
    as well as of Sentinel-2 ARD products [3,6]. The provision of ARD products representing
    radar backscatter started with the continuous and global coverage of Sentinel-1
    imagery. The cloud based platform of Google Earth Engine provides processed Level-1
    Ground Range Detected (GRD) Sentinel-1 data. The pre-processing contains border
    and thermal noise removal, radiometric and geometric calibration using Shuttle
    Radar Topography (SRTM) and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection
    Radiometer (ASTER) Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and conversion to decibel. It
    is implemented by the Sentinel Toolbox and allows a subsequent processing in Python
    and JavaScript languages [7]. Truckenbrodt et al. [8] analysed the capability
    of possible software solutions like the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) and
    GAMMA for the automatic production of Sentinel-1 ground range detected ARD products.
    He concluded that SNAP is a convenient and user-friendly graphical user interface
    and additionally, it is open source. Anyway, the error messages were difficult
    to interpret without prior knowledge and especially the complex Java structure
    complicates error search. The basic command line interface of licensed GAMMA required
    experiences in application and development of new workflows. Therefore, it was
    very robust and fast. The analyses of Ticehurst et al. [9] went beyond the usage
    of Sentinel-1 radar backscatter data and involved equally polarimetric radar data.
    She developed ARD products from SAR including normalized radar backscatter ( 𝛾
    0 ), eigenvector-based dual-polarization decomposition, and interferometric coherence
    based on SNAP. Her feasibility study showed a good agreement between SNAP and
    GAMMA with minor systematic geometric and radiometric differences which can be
    neglected. The above mentioned backscatter ARD products bases mostly on Sentinel-1
    GRD data. Though, CEOS demands Level-1 Single Look Complex (SLC) ARD products
    in order to exploit similarly the polarimetric information. This requires a standardized
    provision of polarimetric radar ARD data including speckle filtering, polarimetric
    decomposition, and normalization of the data in order to reduce their storage
    demand [10]. We present the Multi-SAR System, an evaluated framework for the production
    of polarimetric ARD data. The Multi-SAR System contains ortho-rectification, Kennaugh
    decomposition, multi-looking, radiometric calibration, image enhancement using
    the multi-scale multi-looking (MSML) approach or Schmittlets, and normalization
    based on hyperbolic tangent function for the final (almost) lossless data compression
    according to References [11,12]. The system can be used for the processing of
    all SAR data in level 1 (focused, slant range, single-look, complex) independent
    of their geometric, radiometric, and polarimetric resolution. Its main benefit
    is the usage of the same workflow and the same parameter configuration file independent
    of the different SAR input data formats and interfaces. The final result is a
    SAR image in level 2 represented in a consistent ARD format. It is implemented
    at the German Remote Sensing Data Center (DFD) within the German Aerospace Center
    (DLR) at Oberpfaffenhofen. 1.2. Applications Based on Multi-SAR System With respect
    to the preprocessing of SAR images acquired by different sensors in different
    modes a first idea how to establish a consistent frame for the ARD provision was
    mentioned in Reference [13], where the Kennaugh elements were chosen to perform
    a robust change detection on wetlands. Already two years later, the normalized
    Kennaugh elements were introduced as a consistent frame for the fusion of multi-sensor
    and multi-polarized SAR data allowing for simple data analysis with standard and
    open-source software, effective data compression, and even change detection in
    combination with advanced locally adaptive filtering techniques [11]. Refining
    these filtering techniques by multi-directional kernels led to the Schmittlet
    approach that even enabled the analysis of image texture in the best available
    (total) intensity image [12]. The change detection capability was used for mapping
    wind throw areas in mid-European forests from TerraSAR-X images [14]. The usefulness
    of the normalized Kennaugh elements in the context of wetland remote sensing especially
    in semi-arid regions was proven several times using TerraSAR-X, RADARSAT-2, and
    even archived data of RADARSAT-1 and ENVISAT-ASAR [15,16,17]. Due to its flexibility
    concerning the input data, different polarization combinations could be evaluated
    at the same time for surface water monitoring purposes [18]. The advanced preprocessing
    finally enabled an almost daily estimation of the water gauge in the Forggensee
    in southern Germany via flooded area [19]. Furthermore, the Kennaugh decomposition
    was successfully utilized in coastal applications for the mapping of bivalve beds
    on exposed intertidal flats from dual-co-polarized TerraSAR-X data [20]. Going
    further north, the normalized Kennaugh elements excelled as input feature for
    classification of Tundra environments in northern Canada. The relation between
    snow depth, topography, and vegetation was studied on TerraSAR-X time series preprocessed
    to Kennaugh elements [21]. Even for the understanding of snow covered sea ice
    processes from TerraSAR-X the Kennaugh preprocessing showed up to be essential
    [22]. Regarding glaciered areas, the polarimetric information captured in Kennaugh
    elements helped to detect the supraglacial meltwater drainage on the Devon Ice
    Cap, Canada. Alpine glaciers were also analysed by normalized Kennaugh elements—a
    study evaluated the correlation between ground-based radar measurements and space-borne
    multi-polarized SAR images over the Vernagtferner in the Oetztaler Alps, Austria,
    [23], the other study evaluated time series of Sentinel-1 data over several summers
    in order to discriminate wet snow from firn as a first step towards a mass balance
    estimation from space [24]. Apart from natural landscapes the Kennaugh elements
    provided a valuable input for the mapping of slums from polarimetric SAR data
    [25]. In combination with the Schmittlet index and a highly sophisticated, multi-scale
    classification approach—called histogram classification—the discrimination of
    formal from informal settlements by multi-aspect SAR images became feasible [26].
    The histogram classification which bases on the similarity measure for the comparison
    of two discrete local histograms was further studied for typical land cover classification
    based on reflectance data only [27]. Recently, a very promising new approach was
    published how to generate Kennaugh-like elements from optical multi-spectral data
    [28] in order to perform a SAR-sharpening gathering typical characteristics of
    optical and SAR images in one layer. Though, the sharpening of SAR by the fusion
    of multi-mode images delivered excellent results, the fusion of SAR and Optics
    still showed some weaknesses, for example, the combined use of SAR and Optics
    without radiometric fusion still was superior to the fused data set [29]. Additionally,
    it was restricted to four channel images like the 10 m -layers of Sentinel-1 or
    the typical channels of an aerial image. Thus, the fusion of four channels from
    SAR and four channels from Optics resulted in four channels again. Although the
    fused channels showed the typical characteristics of both inputs, they did not
    provide more degrees of freedom which seems to be essential. Finally, the multiplicative
    fusion ignores the signal-to-noise-ratio of the input channels and thus, possibly
    amplifies noise contained in the input channels instead of reducing it. A parallel
    study [30] proved that the Kennaugh-like provision of multi-spectral data from
    Optics has advantages over the standard data preparation in reflectance values
    when using the special multi-scale histogram classification algorithm. In summary,
    the remaining problem can be seen in the reduction of the image channels when
    the images are fused instead of an orthogonal transform into Kennaugh-like elements.
    1.3. Multi-SAR System with Image Fusion A step forward to the production of ARD
    data would be the image fusion of surface reflectance and polarimetric ARD data.
    Image fusion creates new images that are more suitable for the purposes of human
    visual perception and object recognition. The detailed overview of existing image
    fusions in References [31,32] showed impressively that the development of new
    methods is an ongoing process. The image fusion techniques can be categorized
    in spatial domain and transform domain fusion [33]. Ha et al. suggested two additional
    groups for categorization containing optimization approaches like Bayesian data
    fusion and other techniques like adaptive methods, smoothing filter-based intensity
    modulations, and spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion models [31,34].
    Due to the simplicity and the majority use of the first two mentioned groups,
    we neglect the two latter groups. The spatial domain fusion contains among others
    the Intensity-hue-saturation transform [35,36], component substitution [37,38],
    colour composition, principal component analysis (PCA) [39,40], and high-pass
    filtering [39,41]. It bases on pixel level processing [42]. Their characteristic
    is the usage of simple fusion rules and hence a low computing time. The fused
    images contain their high spatial quality and preserve their spectral information
    content. Though, the disadvantage is the spectral degradation which reduces the
    contrast levels in the fused image and hence could affect negatively the classification
    results [43,44]. The transform domain fusion comprises multi-resolution [45],
    wavelet transform [46,47], Laplacian and Gaussian pyramid [48], Bandelet Transform,
    Contourlet [49,50], and Curvelet [51,52]. The Fourier transform of the entire
    image into the frequency domain overcomes the limitations of the spatial domain
    methods. As it enhances the properties of the image like brightness, contrast,
    or distribution of gray levels, it provides its higher spectral content. Additionally,
    these methods preserve more spatial features and have a better signal to noise
    ratio compared to pixel-based approaches. Though, the transform domain methods
    are more complex than approaches of the spatial domain and leads to inadequately
    fusion images when applied on images from different sensors [43,44,53,54]. Since
    few years, deep learning has achieved great success in image fusion and can be
    regarded as a new categorization besides the spatial and transform domain. Its
    beginning were already in the 1960s as Ivakhnenko and Lapa published their first
    general, working learning algorithm for supervised deep feedforward multilayer
    perceptrons [55]. The term ’deep learning’ was for the first time introduced to
    the machine learning community in 1986 [56]. But first the increase and the availability
    of amount of labelled data helped deep learning to its breakthrough. Since then,
    it is used more and more in computer vision and image processing for classification
    and segmentation [32]. The approach is based on artificial neural networks like
    Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) [57,58,59], Convolutional Sparse Coding [57,60],
    or Stacked Autoencoders [61]. The main advantage of this approach lies in its
    ability to outperform nearly every other machine learning algorithm. It supplies
    improvements for unstable and complex problems [32,57]. In addition, the same
    neural network can be applied to many different applications and data types. It
    is executed in the pixel level processing such as the spatial domain fusion [42].
    In the same way, multi-source data can be fused using the CMIR-NET (e.g.) that
    learns from two separate, but labelled data sets [62]. Compared to other techniques,
    a high performance can only be achieved with a very large amount of data. As the
    model of the neural network must be trained, its accuracy depends on quality and
    size of the training data. Though, the most important disadvantage is that the
    output is not explainable as the prediction is not traceable. In a nutshell, the
    strength of the machine learning methods can be seen in the robust handling of
    more or less stochastic variations in labelled data. In contrast to that, our
    preprocessing approach for data fusion is simple, deterministic, robust, fast,
    and completely independent from labelled data. The aim of the Multi-SAR System
    is to reduce stochastic variations in SAR data combinations to a minimum so that
    simple threshold classification is already enough to detect temporal changes [11].
    With respect to the up-to-date machine learning approaches the introduction of
    Kennaugh-like elements—according to the Kennaugh elements of the Multi-SAR System—is
    expected to produce most stable physical measures in order to reduce the stochastic
    in the class assignment. In consequence, the remaining variation to be captured
    by the machine learning methods is significantly lower and therefore, the results
    based on Kennaugh-like elements are expected to be even better than using standard
    reflectance values. Therefore, the Multi-SAR System is expanded to the fusion
    of SAR and optical images. The current method uses hypercomplex bases which produces
    Kennaugh-like elements for optical data and hence enables the fusion of SAR and
    optical data to one image in a second step. It is performed on pixel level with
    an optional spatial or temporal filtering as known from the Schmittlets [12] implemented
    in the Multi-SAR System. We summarize the main points explained above in five
    research question to be answered in the article: Is there a flexible descriptor
    for multi-spectral data with more than four channels that delivers Kennaugh-like
    elements as utilized in the Multi-SAR System? How can multi-source images (e.g.,
    from SAR and Optics) which are transformed to a common basis be fused without
    loss of information? Is it possible to consider not only spectral or polarimetric,
    but also further dimensions such as “temporal” or “spatial” in a similar way?
    Does the fusion of multi-source data really produce more stable class signatures
    than the simple channel combination? How does a reduction of the image bit depth
    due to storing reasons effects the stability of the class signatures? The methodology
    section will introduce the novel data fusion approach as well as the methods for
    its evaluation. The result section illustrates selected examples which are interpreted
    in the discussion section before the main conclusion are formulated. 2. Methodology
    This section comprises the methodology needed for the generation of a consistent
    data frame, for the subsequent data fusion, low-loss compression, and finally,
    the generation and validation of stable class signatures as input to machine learning
    algorithms. 2.1. Consistent Data Frame The basis for any data fusion was a consistent
    data frame in which each set of layers can be projected. With respect to polarimetric
    SAR data, the Kennaugh decomposition was first renewed in Reference [13] and then
    extended to any set of multi-polarized SAR data available nowadays in Reference
    [11]. The calculation of Kennaugh-like elements even from multi-spectral data
    in order to sharpen SAR images was recently published in Reference [28]. The core
    of this technique is an orthogonal transform by a matrix A with following characteristics:
    | 𝑎 𝑖,𝑗 |= 1 𝑛 √ 𝑖,𝑗∈[1,𝑛] All entries of A share the same absolute value given
    by the dimension of A which is needed to fulfil the orthogonality requirement.
    This also implies an equal weight of all input channels corresponding to a uniform
    look factor. ∑ 𝑛 𝑗=1 | 𝑎 1,𝑗 |=1 The first row of A denotes an equally weighted
    sum over all input channels giving the total intensity (SAR) or reflectance (Optics),
    respectively. This entry will be necessary for the normalization of the complete
    set of Kennaugh-like elements later on. ∑ 𝑛 𝑗=1 | 𝑎 𝑖,𝑗 |=0 𝑖∈[2,𝑛] All other
    rows composes of as many negative as positive entries, thus their sum and their
    expectation value consequently equal to zero. Zero means “no information” in this
    element, whereas any deviation from zero indicated spectral or temporal information,
    respectively. 𝐴 𝑇 = 𝐴 −1 The matrix A is orthogonal. The inverse transform thus
    is simply given by its transposed matrix of A. As the matrix A is predefined and
    not estimated for each data set separately as usual in PCA (e.g.), it is guaranteed
    that the transform can simply be inverted. 𝐴 𝑇 ·𝐴=𝐸 The transposed matrix neutralizes
    the transform. This characteristic directly results from the orthogonality stated
    above and underlines that the basis change preserves information. The transform
    therefore only introduces new coordinate axes in the feature space. For instance,
    the transformation matrix to derive two Kennaugh elements from twin-polarized
    radar measurements can be described as follows according to [11]: 𝐾 → 𝑡𝑤𝑖𝑛 = 1
    2 − − √ [ 𝑅 𝐻𝐻 + 𝑅 𝑉𝑉 𝑅 𝐻𝐻 − 𝑅 𝑉𝑉 ]= ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ 1 2 √ 1 2 √ 1 2 √ − 1 2 √ ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥
    ·[ 𝑅 𝐻𝐻 𝑅 𝑉𝑉 ]=𝐴·[ 𝑅 𝐻𝐻 𝑅 𝑉𝑉 ] (1) Similar formulations can be found for dual-cross-polarizations
    with intensity measurements exclusively. The quantum leap in comparison to other
    decomposition strategies lies in its flexibility and the strict distinction between
    reliable reflectance (or intensity) and often noisy phase information, thus in
    its radiometric stability. From a mathematical point of view, the matrix A defined
    above is most interesting: due to its symmetry, the matrix is its own inverse,
    that is, 𝐴= 𝐴 𝑇 = 𝐴 −1 and therewith, 𝐴 2 =𝐴·𝐴=𝐸 produces the neutral element
    in multiplication and 𝐴− 𝐴 −1 =𝐴−𝐴=0 likewise in addition. These characteristics
    result from the special choice of the new axes, cf. Figure 1 in the following.
    Figure 1. The orthogonal transform from reflectance (blue) to Kennaugh elements
    (red) in the two dimensional space of one measurement (green) according to Equation
    (2). 2.1.1. The Complex Basis More generally, the transform can be expressed via
    a linear transform of a two-element vector, where the two columns of the transformation
    matrix span one basis of the complex plane ℂ . 𝐾 → 2 =𝐶· 𝑅 → 2 = 1 2 − − √ [ 1
    1 1 −1 ]· 𝑅 → 2 (2) Due to that reason the transformation matrix is now denoted
    by C. It linearly transforms the vector of reflectance measures with 𝑟 𝑖 ≥0 into
    Kennaugh elements with the well-known properties, c.f., [11]. Thanks to its orthogonality,
    this transform restricts to a rotation and an inversion of the incident axes as
    shown in Figure 1. The scale remains untouched, that is, the transform does not
    amplify or damp the original signal. Even the relative angles between the channels
    are equal in order to prevent additional correlations. 2.1.2. The Quaternion Basis
    The transform given above is only applicable to two-dimensional spaces. Regarding
    dual-polarized acquisitions with fixed phase measurements or the up-to-date compact-hybrid
    mode, four channels are available in Kennaugh elements. Beyond SAR, most airborne
    camera or scanning systems provide a four-channel image containing Blue, Green,
    Red, and Infrared. For this case, an extended approach was already published in
    Reference [28] that formulated a four-by-four matrix with the required characteristics.
    For conformity reasons, an equivalent matrix is now created by the substitution
    of each element in C (see Equation (2)) by another complex number. Referring the
    coefficients to numbers, the four-by-four matrix Q is created, which constitutes
    the Quaternion basis ℚ . 𝐾 → 4 =𝑄· 𝑅 → 4 = 1 2 − − √ [ 𝐶 𝐶 𝐶 −𝐶 ]· 𝑅 → 4 = 1 2
    ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ 1 1 1 1 1 −1 1 −1 1 1 −1 −1 1 −1 −1 1 ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ · 𝑅 → 4 (3) The
    only difference to the A matrix published in Reference [28] is the order and orientation
    of the single dimensions which is—by the way—irrelevant for its application. This
    matrix has already been used for the fusion of images from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2.
    The inspection of the polarimetric information content after the image fusion
    proofed that the polarimetric information of the input images was retained or
    even complemented [28]. 2.1.3. The Octonion Basis In order to serve higher-dimensional
    problems in the same way, the elements 1 or −1 of matrix Q (see Equation (3))
    again are replaced by complex entries leading to the Octonion basis 𝕆 with eight
    dimensions. 𝐾 → 8 =𝑂· 𝑅 → 8 = 1 2 − − √ [ 𝑄 𝑄 𝑄 −𝑄 ]· 𝑅 → 8 = 1 2 ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢
    𝐶 𝐶 𝐶 𝐶 𝐶 −𝐶 𝐶 −𝐶 𝐶 𝐶 −𝐶 −𝐶 𝐶 −𝐶 −𝐶 𝐶 ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ · 𝑅 → 8 (4) Eight channels are
    especially needed for the fusion of Sentinel-1 (dual-polarized) and Sentinel-2
    ( 10 m pixel) images when both, the polarimetric and the spectral information,
    shall be preserved. The article cited above was titled “SAR sharpening” and thus,
    only cared for the polarimetric information content [28]. Due to the reduction
    of the dimensionality from eight to four, a minimum data loss is indisputable.
    Using the new Equation (4) the eight input channels again result in eight output
    channels, thus the information preserving transform is guaranteed. 2.1.4. The
    Sedenion Basis When exploiting the complete information contained in a Sentinel-2
    image, thirteen channels are involved whereas channel 8 and 8𝐴 only differ in
    their spectral and spatial resolution, that is, twelve independent channels. In
    combination with the four Kennaugh elements of Sentinel-1, the need for a sixteen
    channel transform arises which can be fulfilled by a fusion on the Sedenion basis
    𝕊 . 𝐾 → 16 =𝑆· 𝑅 → 16 = 1 2 − − √ [ 𝑂 𝑂 𝑂 −𝑂 ]· 𝑅 → 16 = 1 2 ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ 𝑄 𝑄 𝑄
    𝑄 𝑄 −𝑄 𝑄 −𝑄 𝑄 𝑄 −𝑄 −𝑄 𝑄 −𝑄 −𝑄 𝑄 ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ · 𝑅 → 16 (5) Thus, the Sedenion basis
    is able to reproduce the whole information content of a combined Sentinel-1 and
    Sentinel-2 image which will be of highest interest for monitoring purposes in
    the near future due to the high temporal sampling (at least once a week) and the
    easy data access at no charge. 2.1.5. Higher Order Bases With view to coming satellite
    mission like EnMAP with a hyperspectral sensor on board and therewith, a much
    higher number of channels, the extension to high-dimensional spaces could be of
    interest. Due to the consistent spanning of higher-order vector spaces by simple
    substitution of the input elements, the extension to 32 dimensions (Equation (6)),
    to 64 dimensions (Equation (7)), to 128 dimensions (Equation (8)), or even more
    is possible without (theoretical) limitations. 𝐾 → 32 =𝑍· 𝑅 → 32 = 1 2 − − √ [
    𝑆 𝑆 𝑆 −𝑆 ]· 𝑅 → 32 (6) 𝐾 → 64 =𝑉· 𝑅 → 64 = 1 2 − − √ [ 𝑍 𝑍 𝑍 −𝑍 ]· 𝑅 → 64 (7)
    𝐾 → 128 =𝐻· 𝑅 → 128 = 1 2 − − √ [ 𝑉 𝑉 𝑉 −𝑉 ]· 𝑅 → 128 (8) In the case of a minimally
    lower number of distinct input channels, the respective channel can simply be
    set to zero leading to a equally lower number of independent output elements as
    already stated in the context of the Kennaugh decomposition in Reference [11].
    Thus, a very flexible, but completely consistent feature space for the fusion
    of arbitrary reflectance and even further rasterized GIS layers is given. At this
    point we can answer the first research question: multi-layer data sets can easily
    be transformed to Kennaugh-like elements using extensions of the complex plane
    defined in (2) to so-called hypercomplex bases. 2.2. Multi-Source Image Fusion
    The following section summarizes the strategies for data fusion on the hypercomplex
    bases introduced above subdivided to the typically available data sets. 2.2.1.
    Polarimetric Fusion The fusion of multi-polarized data sets to pseudo-polarimetric
    images was realized by the completion of redundant Kennaugh elements in one acquisition
    by the distinct Kennaugh elements of another acquisition [28]. This additive approach
    was successfully applied to data acquired in the pursuit-monostatic phase of den
    TanDEM-X mission for the generation of pseudo-quad-polarized images from two dual-polarized
    acquisitions [63]. 𝐾 → fused = 𝐾 → dual−co−pol + 𝐾 → dual−cross−pol (9) This symbolic
    formulation can be further refined by introducing the individual spatial resolution
    [28], that is, the look factor as weight of the input channels. For clarity reasons,
    only the equally weighted, and therewith the orthogonal case, was considered.
    2.2.2. SAR Sharpening Multi-polarized images generally suffer from a reduced spatial
    coverage and resolution. To avoid the reduced spatial sampling, an intensity image
    𝐾 → pol of higher spatial resolution can be introduced in the same way pan-sharpening
    is done on optical imagery. In the simplest case, the total intensity of the multi-polarized
    image 𝐾 → pol is completely replaced. 𝐾 → sharpenend = ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ 0 𝐾 1 𝐾 2 𝐾
    3 ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ pol + ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ 𝐾 0 0 0 0 ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ int = ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ 0 0 0
    0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ · 𝐾 → pol + ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ · 𝐾 → int (10) Though exemplarily shown by a four-channel
    image, it can be transferred to any polarimetric combination without any limitation.
    The intensity layer is not restricted to SAR intensities, but can even be given
    by the panchromatic channel of an airborne camera system as proven in Reference
    [28]. 2.2.3. Spectral Fusion The fusion of multi-spectral data requires the primary
    transform from reflectance values to Kennaugh-like elements as already presented
    in Reference [28]. If the channels are drawn from different sensors 𝑅 → a and
    𝑅 → b , the matrix multiplication can be divided in two additive parts. 𝐾 → fused
    = 1 2 − − √ [ 𝐶 𝐶 0 0 ] ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ 𝑅 → a 𝑅 → b ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ + 1 2 − − √ [ 0 0 𝐶 −𝐶 ] ⎡
    ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ 𝑅 → a 𝑅 → b ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ = 1 2 − − √ [ 𝐶 𝐶 ] 𝑅 → a + 1 2 − − √ [ 𝐶 −𝐶 ] 𝑅 → b
    (11) Due to simplicity, the approach is demonstrated in four-dimensional space,
    but without any limitation of the generality. 2.2.4. SAR-Optical Fusion The problem
    occurring when fusing multi-polarized SAR and multi-spectral optical data lies
    in the combination of already transformed Kennaugh elements 𝐾 → SAR in the case
    of SAR and reflectance values 𝑅 → OPT in the case of optical images. We simply
    circumvented this problem by replacing 𝐶 2 √ · 𝑅 → a = 𝐾 → SAR in Equation (11)
    and got following equation. 𝐾 → SAR&OPT = ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ 𝐾 → SAR 𝐾 → SAR ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ + 1
    2 − − √ [ 𝐶 −𝐶 ]· 𝑅 → OPT = ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ 𝐾 → SAR 𝐾 → SAR ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ + ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ 𝐾 → OPT
    𝐾 → OPT ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ (12) The consistent derivation explained in Section 2 still guarantees
    an orthogonal transform of the original features space even if the transform is
    split into two independent steps as described in Equation (12). 2.2.5. Image Fusion
    with Arbitrary Layers The property reflectance in Optics or intensity with respect
    to SAR essentially denoted that this input layer was subject to a ratio scale,
    that is, there was a well-defined origin and the ratio between entries was playing
    the key role. It further implied that the data range was restricted to positive
    values. Therewith, any layer in ratio scale could be transformed—in combination
    with others—to the Kennaugh-space. If the ratio scale was not assured and only
    a cardinal scale can be accepted because of negative entries (e.g.) the inclusion
    of this layer has to be done in a scaled version of the Kennaugh-like elements
    which will be presented in the following Section 2.4. The summary of this section
    answered the second research question: simple matrix multiplication allowed us
    to separate the calculation of Kennaugh elements from SAR and Kennaugh-like elements
    from Optics and to fuse the transformed elements afterwards. The information retain
    was guaranteed because of the orthogonality of the transform. The fusion was performed
    in an additive way which considers the signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, the
    Kennaugh elements from SAR were well-known for their robustness towards noise.
    2.3. Multi-Temporal Image Fusion The multi-source image fusion mentioned above
    was designed to fuse images of different sensors, but taken at (approximately)
    the same time. This section introduces a methodology how to generate multi-temporal
    Kennaugh-like matrices from multi-source Kennaugh-like elements by a matrix multiplication
    from the right with one of the orthogonal matrices given above. Instead of multi-temporal
    and multi-spectral dimensions, multi-row and multi-column measurements could be
    processed in the same way in order to represent spatial characteristics, for example,
    as supplement or even substitute to spatial convolutions in machine learning algorithms.
    2.3.1. Change Detection The simplest case is the comparison of two images, in
    general a pre-event image at time 𝑡1 and a post-event image at time 𝑡2 . The multi-temporal
    Kennaugh matrix was calculated by a right multiplication with the basis of the
    complex plane C which results in the sum and the difference of the two input images.
    𝐾 4×2 ={𝑄·[ 𝑅 → 𝑡2 𝑅 → 𝑡1 ]}·𝐶=[ 𝐾 → 𝑡2 𝐾 → 𝑡1 ]·𝐶= 1 2 − − √ · ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ 𝐾 → 𝑡2
    + 𝐾 → 𝑡1 𝐾 → 𝑡2 − 𝐾 → 𝑡1 ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ 𝑇 (13) This conformed to the normalized intensity
    difference in Reference [11] and the additive formulation of the differential
    Kennaugh elements envisaged in Reference [64]. As the first element of K referred
    to an intensity measure, the requirements for a subsequent normalization were
    fulfilled. The quaternion basis Q for the multi-source fusion was chosen without
    limiting the generality: the number of dimensions in temporal and spectral direction
    were completely independent. 2.3.2. Gradients and Curvature Considering more than
    two images, for example, four dates 𝑡1 , 𝑡2 , 𝑡3 , and 𝑡4 , more descriptors than
    sum and difference could be evaluated. The temporal combination then was realized
    by the quaternion basis Q likewise resulting in a four by four matrix of \"differential\"
    Kennaugh-like elements. 𝐾 4×4 ={𝑄·[ 𝑅 → 𝑡4 𝑅 → 𝑡3 𝑅 → 𝑡2 𝑅 → 𝑡1 ]}·𝑄= 1 2 · ⎡
    ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ 𝐾 → 𝑡4 + 𝐾 → 𝑡3 + 𝐾 → 𝑡2 + 𝐾 → 𝑡1 𝐾 → 𝑡4 − 𝐾 → 𝑡3 + 𝐾 → 𝑡2 − 𝐾 →
    𝑡1 𝐾 → 𝑡4 + 𝐾 → 𝑡3 − 𝐾 → 𝑡2 − 𝐾 → 𝑡1 𝐾 → 𝑡4 − 𝐾 → 𝑡3 − 𝐾 → 𝑡2 + 𝐾 → 𝑡1 ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥
    ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ 𝑇 (14) The matrix 𝐾 4×4 could be interpreted as follows: the first column
    refers to the sum of all Kennaugh elements, that is, to a most stable mean image
    or a low pass filter. The second column highlighted high frequency gradients or
    a high pass filter. The third column calculated the mean temporal gradient or
    a band pass filter. The fourth column produced the temporal curvature. All descriptors
    were given in critical sampling, but representing the whole information contained
    in the source products due to the orthogonality of the transformation matrix.
    2.3.3. General Time Series Analysis The Sentinel-1 mission with its repeat pass
    acquisitions every six days delivers sixteen images for a quarter of a year. In
    this case, the temporal fusion could simply be replaced by the Sedenion basis
    S without limitation of the generality. 𝐾 4×16 ={𝑄·[ 𝑅 → 𝑡16 ⋯ 𝑅 → 𝑡1 ]}·𝑆=[ 𝐾
    → 𝑡16 ⋯ 𝐾 → 𝑡1 ]·𝑆 (15) With respect to longer time spans, hypercomplex bases
    of higher order were also possible, for example, the Z matrix for half a year
    or the V matrix for a whole year, see Section 2.1.5. The inclusion of further
    image layers would require the substitution of Q at the left of Equation (15)
    and therefore, led to an increase of the number of rows, that is, longer 𝐾 → vectors.
    In any case, the concept guaranteed that the first element always consists of
    an intensity measure that could be used for the normalization of all other elements.
    To conclude, we could affirm the third research question: it was possible to introduce
    the time as new dimension in the same way that multi-source images were combined.
    Thus, the consistency of the framework was guaranteed. The identical procedure
    allows equally the inclusion of spatial features like multi-row and multi-column
    image chips for a robust description of spatial patterns. 2.4. Data Scaling Approach
    This section treats the possible scaling variants of the defined elements which
    can be linear, logarithmic, or even normalized to a closed range with respect
    to the application. The origin of the elements—vectors from multi-source or matrices
    from multi-temporal data—is completely irrelevant. 2.4.1. Linear Scale All image
    data from optical remote sensing satellites were delivered in reflectance values,
    mostly multiplied by a calibration factor in order to guarantee integer value.
    SAR data in contrast was given as real- and imaginary part in single look slant
    range products or amplitude data in the case of ground range or geocoded products.
    The conversion from the delivered scaling to intensity values could be found in
    the respective product specifications. The data range of linearly scaled reflectance
    data is given by 𝑅 𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑎𝑟 ∈[0,∞] whereas the mode of the exponential distribution
    could be found slightly above zero. The adequate storing in digital numbers therefore
    was quite difficult which resulted in a high radiometric sampling of usually at
    least 16 bit nowadays. 2.4.2. Hyperbolic Tangent Normalized Scale In order to
    reduce the bit depth without noteworthy loss of information a normalization approach
    was introduced in Reference [11]. The core of his hyperbolic tangent (TANH) normalization
    was a division of all Kennaugh elements except 𝐾 0 by the total reflectance contained
    in 𝐾 0 —the first element of the vector or the first element of the main diagonal,
    respectively,—and the reduction of 𝐾 0 to a reference intensity 𝐼 𝑅𝑒𝑓 similar
    to differential Kennaugh elements [13] where the pre-event intensity served as
    reference for the post-event intensity. 𝑘 ⃗  = [ 𝐾 0 − 𝐼 𝑅𝑒𝑓 𝐾 0 + 𝐼 𝑅𝑒𝑓 𝐾 1 𝐾
    0 ⋯ 𝐾 𝑚 𝐾 0 ] 𝑇 (16) The resulting normalized elements shared a closed data range
    of 𝑘 ⃗  ∈[−1,+1] which simplified not only the interpretation based on Support
    Vector Machines (e.g.), but also the conversion to digital numbers. The standard
    sampling of 16 bit enables a data range of ±48 dB with a maximum radiometric sampling
    of 0.0003 dB. The reduction to 8 bit still covered a range of ±24 dB with a maximum
    radiometric sampling of still 0.07 dB. The range where the radiometric sampling
    was better than 1 dB is given by ±41.7 dB and ±17.5 dB, respectively. Thus, the
    loss of information should be negligible in comparison to a conversion of the
    linearly scaled variables. The possible reduction of the radiometric sampling
    to only a few bins enabled new classification approaches like the histogram classification
    [26]. 2.4.3. Logarithmic Scale The reason why TANH normalized values could be
    expressed in decibel, thus in logarithmic scale was pointed out in Reference [11].
    It could be shown that the area hyperbolic tangent of the normalized elements
    gave the variables in logarithmic scale which differed from the unit decibel only
    by a constant factor which was the same for all normalized Kennaugh-like elements
    including 𝐾 0 . 𝑘 ⃗  𝑑𝐵 =𝑎𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎ( 𝑘 ⃗  𝑑𝐵 )· 20𝑑𝐵 ln10 =𝑎𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎ( 𝑘 ⃗  𝑑𝐵 )·8.68588963806504⋯𝑑𝐵
    (17) The logarithmic scale was suitable when layers in cardinal scale should be
    included on the one hand, see Section 2.2.5. On the other hand, it resulted in
    layers with more or less a normal distribution which was required by many parameter-based
    classification approaches like the maximum likelihood classification. Regarding
    data compression, the logarithmic scaling was superior to the linear scaling because
    of the variable sampling rate (high around zero and lower towards infinity), but
    inferior to the normalized scaling because of its open data range 𝑘 ⃗  𝑑𝐵 ∈[−∞,+∞]
    . 2.5. Evaluation Approach The evaluation of data fusion approaches was not a
    trivial task. Most scientists conducted a whole classification for each data set
    as well as for the fused one separately and compared the classification results.
    The improvement was expected to show up in a lower number of misclassifications
    using the fused data set. This was truly an adequate approach for a predefined
    combination of data set, classification task, and algorithm. As we were aiming
    at a universal approach for the data preparation, it was neither reasonable to
    focus on one application case nor possible to cover all possible applications.
    Therefore, we decided in favour of following validation strategy composed of traditional
    and novel methods. 2.5.1. Visual Inspection Though very subjective, the visual
    inspection of imagery still was the most reliable interpretation technique with
    view to extremely complex or high-dimensional tasks. The high dimensionality was
    present in the multi-source and multi-temporal fusion. Regarding the Quaternion
    transform, four spectral (or polarimetric) dimensions met four temporal dimensions,
    which resulted in sixteen elements. The semantic subsampling to a few land cover
    classes was also very difficult, because the classes had to represent single temporal
    developments which could be highly variable [15]. Therefore, the multi-temporal
    fusion was validated by a visual inspection of RGB (Red-Green-Blue) compositions
    of the single multi-spectral elements along the temporal dimension which is provided
    by the single columns of the matrix. To support the conclusion drawn from visual
    inspection, the first five moments of the resulting distribution were calculated
    along the temporal and spectral dimension separately. They were normalized to
    a linear deviation, that is, the mean absolute deviation for the first moment,
    the standard deviation for the second moment, the third root of the kurtosis,
    and so forth. 2.5.2. Class Signatures The multi-source image fusion resulted in
    a feature vector which was much easier to interpret. The signatures of different
    land cover classes were expected to by quite stable within the region of interest
    and thus could be described by the distribution of the belonging pixels in the
    normalized Kennaugh space. Correlations between the single Kennaugh elements which
    are taken into account in some parametric classifiers like the Maximum Likelihood
    Estimation (MLE) are of minor importance to modern classifiers like Random Forest
    (e.g.) or the multi-scale histogram classification [30], that is, due to the immense
    computing demand when evaluating multi-variable histograms with common statistical
    measures like mutual information. Our study will consider both: standard MLE and
    similarity estimation. 2.5.3. Maximum Likelihood Contingency Evaluation One traditional
    method to compare class signatures with individual signatures was given within
    MLE. This parametric approach described the class signatures by multi-variate
    normal distributions defined via mean vector 𝜇 ⃗  and covariance matrix 𝜍 . The
    discriminator for each pixel vector 𝜓 ⃗  in logarithmic scale [65] then unfolded
    to 𝑆 𝑀𝐿𝐸 =−𝑙𝑛|𝜍|− ( 𝜓 ⃗  − 𝜇 ⃗  ) 𝑇 · 𝜍 −1 ·( 𝜓 → − 𝜇 → ) (18) Each pixel in the
    reference data set was attributed to the class with the maximum likelihood. After
    this step, a contingency matrix of the training areas—similar to the confusion
    matrix for classifications—was calculated. As this procedure had to be performed
    for varying radiometric resolutions, that is, different binnings, only the total
    accuracy and the 𝜅 -coefficient were reported as indicators for the quality of
    the class description. 2.5.4. Similarity of Signatures As parametric approaches
    like the MLE always imply a certain distribution, non-parametric methods evaluating
    the empirically derived distributions exclusively such as the Correlation Coefficient,
    the Kullback-Leibler-Divergence, the Cross-Entropy, or the similarity were preferred
    nowadays. The similarity was designed especially for the comparison of discrete
    histograms from normalized remote sensing data with or without consideration of
    the inter-channel correlations [26]. For the case of normalized elements without
    noteworthy correlation, it unfolded to 1 𝑆 𝑝,𝑞 = ∏ 𝑗=1 𝑚 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑛 𝑞 2 𝑖,𝑗 𝑝 𝑖,𝑗
    − − − − − − − −  ⎷   𝑚 (19) where n denotes the maximum number of bins and
    m the number of dimensions compared, that is, Kennaugh-like elements. The root
    does not result directly from the derivation, but it balances the varying number
    of input elements when testing scenarios with varying numbers of input channels.
    The similarity had a closed data range of 𝑆 𝑝,𝑞 ∈[0,1] like any probability value.
    For visualization purposes the unit decibel 𝑆 𝑝,𝑞 [𝑑𝐵]=10· log 10 𝑆 𝑝,𝑞 ∈[−∞,0]
    was preferable and will be used in Section 3. 2.5.5. Intra- and Inter-Class Similarities
    Using the signatures defined in Section 2.5.2 and the similarity measure given
    in Section 2.5.4 intra-class and inter-class similarities were derived and compared
    in order to estimate the impact of the data fusion and scaling on the class separability.
    As the similarity could only be calculated for two signatures under study, the
    arithmetic mean of all possible combinations was chosen as representative value
    for the intra- and inter-class similarities. We expected high intra-class similarities
    and low inter-class similarities. In the optimal case, they do not converge until
    the radiometric sampling is very low, for example, binary. In addition to several
    diagrams that depicted the influence for each class separately, the mean gain
    over all classes was given in numbers. It composed of the difference between the
    mean intra-class and the mean inter-class similarity indicating the relative increase
    in class similarity. The mean similarities were calculated as arithmetic mean
    over all samples of the single classes. This equals the geometric mean of the
    incident class similarities, which means that it was very sensitive towards possible
    low outliers. 2.5.6. Gain of Intra- vs. Inter-Class-Similarity In favour of a
    more comprehensive interpretation, the manifold results from the preceding section
    were rearranged and combined to a gain in similarity, that is, to which extent
    the mean similarity of signatures was increased or decreased. The gain was simply
    defined as difference between the mean logarithmic similarity of objects belonging
    to the same class over the mean logarithmic similarity of objects belonging to
    other classes. This reflected the logarithmic quotient of the respective similarities
    and could again be given in the unit decibel. It provided a measure equivalent
    to the total accuracy and 𝜅 -coefficient evaluated for the MLE comparison with
    mean class signatures, but derived from the similarity of individual signatures
    exclusively this time. 3. Results The capability of the transforms shown in the
    previous section will by demonstrated in the following by selected examples. Understandably,
    the choice of examples was not sufficient to cover all possible applications,
    but enough to provide a rough impression of the potential inherent to the novel
    technique. 3.1. Multi-Temporal Image Fusion The multi-temporal image fusion presented
    in Section 2.3 was applied to a data set consisting of four Sentinel-2 geocoded
    and atmospherically corrected L2A images over the “Murnauer Moos” near the Alps
    in southern Germany. The area is characterized by restored, quasi natural moor
    areas, agricultural land, forests, and built-up areas. Only the bottom-of-atmosphere
    (BOA) reflectance values contained in the 10 m -layers are considered in this
    example for reasons of simplicity. The almost cloud-free images were acquired
    on 2019-07-23, 2019-08-27, 2019-09-21, and 2019-10-26. True Colour and Colour
    Infrared images of the data stack were depicted in Figure 2. The reflectance measures
    were transformed to multi-spectral Kennaugh elements according to Equation (3)
    and then combined to multi-temporal elements according to Equation (14). The single
    rows of the resulting multi-spectral and multi-temporal Kennaugh matrix are displayed
    in Figure 3 gathered to multi-temporal RGB images, that is, each channel refers
    to one spectral Kennaugh element according to the indication right of the images.

    channels are indicated on the right side of each image. The coordinates are given
    in latitude and longitude on the WGS84 ellipsoid. The normalized moments (e.g.,

    spectral dimension are listed in Table 1 divided in the four spectral or temporal
    channels remaining in the respective case. Table 1. Empirical central moments

    3.2. Multi-Source Image Fusion This section summarizes the results of the multi-source
    image fusion to one data set consisting of Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and ALOS-PALSAR-2
    acquisitions for the three regions of interest (ROI) in Germany, namely the “Starnberg
    Lake” (ROI 1) in southern Germany, the “Ruhr Metropolitan Area” (ROI 2) in western
    Germany, and the “Potsdam Lake Land” (ROI 3) near the capital in eastern Germany.
    Detailed descriptions of the input data can be found in Table 2. All images were
    projected into the earth-fixed UTM coordinate system with a uniform pixel spacing
    of 10 m by 10 m resulting in slightly varying look factors according to [28] which
    is ignored in the current study for reasons of simplicity. The following figures
    are all reprojected to latitude and longitude in WGS84. Table 2. The remote sensing
    data subject to the presented study. The SAR data were preprocessed by the Multi-SAR
    System [11] exclusively available at DLR (Oberpfaffenhofen) to geocoded, calibrated,
    and normalized Kennaugh elements. The multi-spectral data were provided in geocoded
    and radiometrically calibrated BOA reflectance values and transformed into Kennaugh-like
    elements according to the formulas given above. The study considers two cases:
    a fusion on the Octonion basis including Sentinel-1 ( 𝐾 0 , 𝐾 1 , 𝐾 5 , 𝐾 8 )
    and Sentinel-2 ( 𝐵2,𝐵3,𝐵4,𝐵8 ) and a fusion on the Sedenion basis including ALOS-PALSAR-2
    ( 𝐾 0 − 𝐾 7 ) and Sentinel-2 ( 𝐵2−𝐵8,𝐵11 ). In all three test sites sample segments
    were manually selected in order to represent following land cover classes: (1)
    Water, (2) Forest, (3) Field, (4) Meadow, and (5) Urban. The class signatures
    were derived from labelled segments generated in a previous study [29]. 3.2.1.
    Fused Images The visualization of Kennaugh-like elements was not an easy task
    because of their central distribution where the deviation from zero in both directions
    indicated information. The common visualization comprises three reflectance channels:
    Red, Green, and Blue with a non-negative exponential distribution. Therefore,
    the input data sets were presented in the accustomed way: True Colour Images for
    multi-spectral images of Sentinel-2 and Bourgeaud decomposition (i.e., the intensity
    channels) for SAR images of Sentinel-1 and ALOS-PALSAR-2. Out of the collection
    of fused Kennaugh-like elements only a selection of three elements (indicated
    on the right site of each image) are depicted in logarithmic scale. A subset of
    the images for the first region of interest can be found in Figure 4. Selected
    subsets of the second and the third test site are illustrated in the same way
    in Figure 5 and Figure 6. Figure 4. Subset of ROI 1: the “Starnberg Lake” southern
    of Munich (coordinate reference WGS84). Figure 5. Subset of ROI 2: the “Ruhr Metropolitan
    Area” (coordinate reference WGS84). Figure 6. Subset of ROI 3: the “Potsdam Lake
    Land” south-western of Berlin (coordinate reference WGS84). 3.2.2. Signature Stability
    The illustration of multi-spectral data with more than three channels was quite
    difficult. In optical remote sensing the four-channel information typically was
    divided in one true colour image (TCI) and one colour infra-red image (CIR) as
    illustrated in Figure 2 well being aware of the high redundancy. In order to generate
    an illustration of all eight or sixteen channels of the fused data set, histograms
    of three different scaling variants were computed. The linear scaling in the left
    column of Figure 7 and Figure 8 equals the standard methodology working on reflectance
    values (optical remote sensing) and covariance matrices (radar remote sensing),
    respectively. Due to the orthogonality of the transform between reflectance channels
    and Kennaugh-like [28] elements as well as between the covariance matrix and the
    Kennaugh elements [64], the statement drawn from the histograms was transferable.
    Elements in linear scale consist of one reflectance value (the total intensity)
    and several reflectance differences ranging from −∞ to +∞ . The second variant
    considered in the middle column of Figure 7 and Figure 8 was the logarithmic scaling
    in the unit decibel (dB) which is quite usual in radar remote sensing and electronic
    engineering in general. This scaling adopted a multiplicative characteristic of
    the input data that was supposed to be composed of intensity quotients. The typical
    range of decibel values—though theoretically unlimited—restricted to −30 dB to
    +30 dB. The normalized Kennaugh-like elements displayed in the right column of
    Figure 7 and Figure 8 shared the unique property of a closed value range [−1,+1]
    , which allowed for the most effective radiometric sampling which will be studied
    in the following section. In order to show the advantages of our approach two
    classes out of the five classes of the study which were not easy to describe with
    traditional methods due to their high variability were chosen for demonstration,
    namely “Forest” in Figure 7 and “Urban” in Figure 8. Figure 7. The distribution
    of the Kennaugh-like elements on the Octonion basis fusing Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2
    (a–c) and on the Sedenion basis fusing ALOS-PALSAR-2 and Sentinel-2 (d–f) for
    class 2 “Forest” in linear, logarithmic, and normalized scaling per regions of
    interest. Figure 8. The distribution of the Kennaugh-like elements on the Octonion
    basis fusing Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 (a–c) and on the Sedenion basis fusing
    ALOS-PALSAR-2 and Sentinel-2 (d–f) for class 5 “Urban” in linear, logarithmic,
    and normalized scaling per ROI. 3.2.3. Maximum Likelihood Contingency The total
    accuracy and the 𝜅 -coefficient achieved by an MLE of the class assignment within
    the reference data are depicted in Figure 9 with respect to the ROI (line style),
    the input data (line colour), and the binning (right axis). The total accuracy
    attained 20% for only one bin which was the accuracy to be expected when five
    equally distributed classes were assigned randomly. The 𝜅 -coefficient lowered
    to zero in this case underlining that the class assignment became purely random.
    Figure 9. Total Accuracy and 𝜅 -coefficient of the contingency matrices achieved
    using a Maximum- Likelihood class discriminator in relation to the test site (“Starnberg
    Lake” solid, “Ruhr Metropolitan Area” dashed, and “Potsdam Lake Land” dot-dashed
    lines), the channel combination and scaling (linear reflectance, logarithmic Kennaugh-like
    elements, and normalized Kennaugh-like elements, see legend), and the radiometric
    sampling given by the number of bins. 3.2.4. Signature Similarity The similarity
    of two signatures was calculated via Equation (19). In default of symmetry, the
    similarity measure was not commutative, that is, the similarity of class 1 to
    class 2 in general differed from the similarity of class 2 to class 1. Therefore,
    both cases were considered. For clarity reasons only the mean similarities of
    the respective sample class were kept in Figure 10 for the Octonion fusion and
    Figure 11 for the Sedenion fusion. The diagrams were split in four parts: Figure

    on the Octonion basis using (a) linear, (b) logarithmic, and (c) normalized elements
    evaluated with individual (left side) and mean signatures (right side) for the
    “Potsdam Lake Land” test site. Figure 11. Mean intra- (upper part) and inter-class
    (lower part) signature similarity on the Sedenion basis using (a) linear, (b)

    the mean intra-class similarities of the mean class signatures lower left: the
    mean inter-class similarities of the individual object signatures lower right:
    the mean inter-class similarities of the mean class signatures All similarities
    were provided in logarithmic scaling in the decibel unit. The searched class was
    indicated by the colour according to legends contained in the respective figures.
    3.2.5. Similarity Gain The mean gain in class similarity by comparing the intra-class
    to the inter-class similarities is numbered in Table 3 for the fusion on the Octonion
    basis and in Table 4 for the fusion on the Sedenion basis. Though, the analysis
    was performed separately for the three test sites, the results were quite similar.
    Obviously, the Sedenion fusion with its 16 channels even raised the gain in comparison
    to the Octonion fusion with its 8 channels. As expected the normalized Kennaugh-like
    elements showed the highest gain for low radiometric sampling. The gain in the
    logarithmic scale was remarkably variable. The linear scale was only applicable
    with higher radiometric sampling. In the case of the Sedenion fusion (see Table
    4) it only seldom exceeded the gain of normalized scaling. Regarding the Octonion
    fusion in Table 3, the linear scaling produced higher values from 20 bins upwards.
    In order to provide a more detailed view to the single classes under study, selected
    examples of the similarity gain per class are plotted in Figure 12. Figure 12.

    the results shown above and draws the conclusions concerning the application of
    the novel data fusion approach. In order to avoid interfering influences from
    varying classification methods and parameters as studied by [67], we base the
    whole interpretation on statistical measures and the identical set of class signatures.
    4.1. Multi-Temporal Image Fusion The benefit from the multi-temporal image fusion
    becomes obvious when comparing Figure 3 with Figure 2. The standard method based
    on reflectance measurements in several spectral channels suffers from the high
    correlation of the input channels. Therefore, mostly brightness changes are clearly
    visible, see Figure 2. The changes in brightness are summarized in the temporal
    variation of the total intensity 𝐾 0 in Figure 3f. The multi-temporal combination
    of the spectral properties in Figure 3d indicates that the mean spectral information
    content is quite low what was expected when looking at the single images in Figure
    2. The really characteristic changes for single land cover classes are all captured
    in the temporal variation of spectral Kennaugh elements. Agriculture land (e.g.,)
    shows up in diverse colours. Especially in Figure 3f,g the moor areas reveal a
    fine structure which was not visible at all in the standard display of Figure
    2. The statistical evaluation in Table 1 reveals three points: (1) The spectral
    variability in the four acquisitions (left part of the table) is equally low for
    reflectance values, gets variable with the transformation to linear Kennaugh-like
    elements, and increases significantly with the scaling of the Kennaugh-like elements.
    (2) The temporal variability in the right part of the table is even lower for
    the single spectral channels. The transformation to Kennaugh-like elements causes
    an increase which is again intensified when applying the typical scaling. (3)
    All channels show comparably high values over all five moments, that is, the underlying
    distributions seem to be very complex which inhibits the use the simple parametric
    estimators. Thus, the use of non-parametric approaches like the similarity is
    highly recommended. A similar validation method was already used by [68] in order
    to evaluate the gain by the fusion of hyperspectral and panchromatic data. Due
    to the complexity of the landscape, the clustering to multi-temporal class signatures
    is a quite difficult task and therefore, will be subject to future studies. The
    use of enhanced clustering methods like self-organizing (e.g.) would go far beyond
    the scope of this article. According to [69], the multi-temporal combination promises
    up to 91% overall accuracy and 89% for the 𝜅 -coefficient with a relatively high
    thematic sampling of nine land cover classes when using enhacned classification
    methods. To sum up, the combination to multi-temporal Kennaugh-like elements highlights
    phenomena that were not apparent in the original reflectance data. 4.2. Multi-source
    Image Fusion This section interprets the results of the image fusion on the Octonion
    and the Sedenion basis shown above. The quantitative evaluation will focus on
    the multi-source Kennaugh elements and take the signature stability and similarity
    over the classes provided in the reference data set into account. 4.2.1. Visual
    Inspection The subset of the “Starnberg Lake” test site in Figure 4 depicts relatively
    smooth water and meadow areas in the optical true colour image whereas settlements
    appear much more heterogeneous. The SAR intensity images share the typical characteristics:
    smooth surfaces with respect to the wavelength are dark. The ALOS-PALSAR-2 image
    in Figure 4f reveals some wind effect that cause a higher surface scattering in
    the cross-polarized channel. Regarding the meadows, Sentinel-1 shows a strong
    texture (Figure 4d), but ALOS-PALSAR-2 relatively smooth areas (Figure 4f) due
    to the respective wavelength. The quite clear segments reported by the optical
    image are preserved and overlaid with the SAR texture when fusing both image sources
    on the Octonion basis in (Figure 4e) or the Sedenion basis (Figure 4g). Even the
    open water receives a certain texture that reflects the local wind situation affecting
    the polarimetric scattering behaviour as described above. Figure 5 illustrates
    a subset of the “Ruhr Metropolitan Area” test site. The settlements are clearly
    distinguishable by their blue tone in the optical true colour image (Figure 5b).
    In the Sentinel-1 intensity image they cannot be discriminated from the surrounding
    forests and meadows. The ALOS-PALSAR-2 enables the distinction between meadows
    that appear dark due to their smoothness with respect to the wavelength and higher
    objects. The appearance of settlements depends on the orientation, that is, there
    are very bright spots, but also areas with a mean intensity that can hardly be
    discriminated from forests. The fused image unites characteristics of SAR and
    Optics. Settlements are mapped in yellow to red in both the Octonion (Figure 5e)
    and the Sedenion (Figure 5g) fusion according to their orientation. Agricultural
    land receives a slight texture that allows for a more detailed analysis of the
    crop. Water surfaces again appear in pale blue with a clear shape. The most impressive
    example for the data fusion can be found in Figure 6 where a subset of the “Potsdam
    Lake Land” is illustrated. The clear boundaries visible in the optical image are
    combined with a refined SAR texture. Higher vegetation (e.g., forest) receives
    a fine and very diverse texture possible allowing for a more detailed analysis.
    Low vegetation is coloured in green tones according to the wavelength: with a
    higher variation in C-band (Figure 6e) and a lower variation in L-band (Figure
    6g). Even the infrastructure is clearly mapped in the Sedenion fusion. Smooth
    water is exactly shaped in pale blue with only a slight pink texture in the cross-polarized
    channel of L-band, cf. Figure 6f,e. In summary, the fused images illustrate scattering
    characteristics which where not visible at all in the single acquisitions. As
    the visual impression is often misleading [65], the three test sites are validated
    quantitatively in the following. 4.2.2. Mean Class Signatures The mean class signatures
    of the land cover classes “Forest” and “Urban” are provided in Figure 7 and Figure
    8 for the fusion on the Octonion basis (a–c) and on the Sedenion basis (d–f),
    respectively. The elements in linear scale show only minor deviations from zero
    over all classes resulting in very slim peaks in the probability density functions
    (PDF), but with few very high and very low values. This effect even intensifies
    with an increase of input channels number from Octonion to Sedenion basis. The
    logarithmic scale provides diverse, but almost normally distributed elements,
    see middle column. The limitation to the range of [−30 dB, +30 dB] concerns only
    few values. Regarding typical noise levels of around −25 dB, the values exceeding
    the limits can be seen as noise. Some undulations become visible that indicate
    a higher radiometric sampling than provided by the input data. These undulations
    even increase in the normalized scaling, see Figure 8. The closed data range and
    the width of the distributions allow a lower radiometric sampling with only negligible
    loss of information which will be studied in the following section. The signatures
    over the three test sites appear quite similar. The fusion on Octonion basis provides
    more distinct histograms than the Sedenion fusion which can be referred to the
    different input data, see Section 3. 4.2.3. Maximum Likelihood Contingency The
    total accuracy and 𝜅 -coefficient of the contingency matrix derived from a MLE
    class assignment proofs the advantage of the presented methodology. For a high
    radiometric sampling, the three methods deliver identical results. But as soon
    as the radiometric sampling is reduced to less than 10,000 bins, the class assignment
    based on reflectance values becomes more or less random (blue lines in Figure
    9). The logarithmic Kennaugh-like elements deliver stable results even for a radiometric
    sampling with only 50 bins in the Octonion case (cf. Figure 9a,b) and even 25
    in the Sedenion case (Figure 9c,d). Regarding the normalized scaling, the accuracy
    of the class assignment is still clearly over 80% both in the total accuracy and
    the 𝜅 -coefficient for 3 bit sampling with 8 bins. For lower sampling rates, the
    location of the bins seems to play a key role because the neighbouring entries
    vary by 50% and more. A binary image (1 bit) still provides a class distinction
    with a total accuracy of 30% to 40% and a 𝜅 -coefficient of 20% in some ROIs.
    This high variability for low sampling rates is confirmed by the signature similarity
    analysis in the following. With respect to the fourth research question we have
    to admit that Kennaugh-like elements seem to provide the same accuracy in the
    class assignment as traditional methods as long as the bit depth is sufficient,
    that is, 16 bit at least. With reduced bit depths, the novel descriptor surpasses
    reflectance values by far. Due to the high diversity and possibility of data combinations
    different methods for individual data sets and varying accuracy parameters are
    reported in the literature. A combination of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 using a
    object-based classifier promises an overall accuracy of 91% and a 𝜅 -coefficient
    of 89%. The classification of a THAICHOTE and Cosmo-Skymed fusion performed by
    SVM reaches an overall accuracy of 77% and a 𝜅 -coefficient of 67% whereas an
    object-based method delivers 82% for the overall accuracy and 75% for the 𝜅 -coefficient
    [70]. The combination of TerraSAR-X and Quickbird data fused by different methods
    leads to overall accuracies from 75% (reflectance layers) and 82% (including texture
    measures) to 91% using refined methods [71]. The latter value is confirmed by
    a study that uses an INFOFUSE-algorithm on WorldView-2 images, texture measures,
    and a digital surface model [72]. With respect to a simple maximum likelihood
    classification, the values drop down to 82% total accuracy and 80% for the 𝜅 -coefficient.
    Higher accuracy values are exclusively reported to the fusion of multi-scale data
    acquired by the same sensor, in general for the purpose of pan-sharpening. For
    the Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) of Landsat, 82% overall accuracy and 79% for
    the 𝜅 -coefficient are reported in Reference [65] when using the maximum likelihood
    approach. When fusing the multispectral channels with the panchromatic channel
    of IKONOS by the SFIM or Gram-Schmidt approach, the overall accuracy reaches almost
    99% with a 𝜅 -coefficient of 98% according to [73]. Comprehensively, the calculated
    accuracy measure depends on many different parameters [67]. One difference could
    be the usage of the contingency from the training samples in our case and supposably
    in the latter article in contrast to the confusion matrix from control samples.
    4.2.4. Signature Similarity The diagrams in Figure 10 and Figure 11 show the influence
    of the radiometric sampling on the class distinction. High values near zero in
    the intra-class similarity (upper part) and very low values in the inter-class
    similarity (lower part) should be guaranteed even with a very low number of bins.
    The distinction using linear elements on the Octonion basis is possible starting
    with three bins, see Figure 10a. On the Sedenion basis even a radiometric sampling
    with only two bins enables a weak distinction of the classes. Figure 11c shows
    an extraordinary high intra-class deviation of the mean signatures of the class
    “Water” which is not acceptable, but a clear effect of the generally low back
    scattering. Apart from that, the intra-class similarities seldom exceed −20 dB
    whereas the inter-class similarities can reach up to −90 dB which is excellent.
    Looking at the similarity in logarithmic scale in Figure 11b, the high sampling
    around zero results in several lobes in the inter-class similarity of the individual
    signatures for less than nine bins. An even number of bins obviously leads to
    a better class distinction. This effect was already observed in the MLE contingency
    analysis discussed above. The class assignment now is even possible to a certain
    degree with only two bins. The same applies to the normalized elements that can
    be found in Figure 10c for the Octonion basis and in Figure 11c for the Sedenion
    basis. The main difference to the similarity in linear elements becomes visible
    when comparing Figure 10a to Figure 11a: the similarity of linearly scaled signatures
    decreases with an increasing number of bins quite symmetrically in intra- and
    inter-class direction. This behaviour is independent from the class. The signatures
    of normalized elements show a stronger increase of around 10 dB in the inter-class
    direction than in intra-class direction proofing that the signatures similarity
    to signatures of the same class is ten times higher than the similarity to other
    classes which is essential for the classification based on normalized elements
    with reduced radiometric sampling. At this point, we can answer the last research
    question: the reduction from typically 16 bit to 8 bit images still assures excellent
    class signature using the new consistent multi-sensor framework. The radiometric
    sampling of 8 bit equals 256 bins. In this study, 100 bins already promise a class
    distinction of at least 10 dB and maximum 75 dB using individual signatures, see
    left edge of Figure 10c. The reduction to 4 bits (or 16 bins) still allows a maximum
    class discrimination power of about 40 dB. Switching to 3 bit images with only
    8 bins further reduced the class distinction. But it is still measurable reaching
    5 dB (or 80% in the MLE analysis) on individual signatures in Figure 11c which
    means that the inter-class similarity is three times higher than the intra-class
    similarity. Only one study is reported in the literature that evaluates the classification
    accuracy in dependence on the compression [66]. This study states an overall accuracy
    of 45% using a maximum likelihood classification and a compression ratio of 1:50.
    In our case, this means that the original sampling of 16 bit is reduced to one
    fifth, that is, reduction from 65536 bins to 1311 bins or approximately 10 bit.
    The usage of a neural network classification method still promises 49%. The preparation
    in Kennaugh-like elements in logarithmic or normalized scale already reaches comparable
    similarity values with only two bins for most classes. With view to the maximum
    likelihood method whose accuracy is plotted in Figure 9, the total accuracy exceeds
    the border of 50% with 3 bits, thus already 8 bins. In terms of compression, this
    equals 8:65536 or 1:8192 for the radiometric compression exclusively. 4.2.5. Similarity
    Gain The similarity gain of intra-class over inter-class similarity was not studied
    in the literature so far. Most publications of data fusion for land cover classification
    compare the accuracy before and after the fusion. For instance, this was done
    by [74] for the fusion of two SAR and one optical image in a neural network. The
    compound classification produced an increase from 84% to 92% in average. Regarding
    the ETM+ fusion, the accuracy of 62% of the original image reaches 66% at highest
    for different fusion algorithms [75]. Another study on the ETM+ fusion in combination
    with a supervised classification [76] reports on a rise from 83% to 90% using
    the fused image. Looking at higher spatial resolution, it seems to amplify the
    impact of the classification algorithm. The combination of Quickbird multispectral
    layers with its panchromatic layer classified by a maximum likelihood approach
    allows for a total accuracy of 58% before and 59% after the fusion which is an
    almost negligible gain of. Using the Euclidean Distance instead promises 91% after
    image fusion in comparison to 87% before [77]. The values provided by these studies
    can be compared to the accuracy values plotted in Figure 9. For a high radiometric
    sampling, we cannot state any gain using our fused and normalized images. But,
    with reduction of the radiometric sampling to 1000 bins, the overall accuracy
    when classifying the original images falls to values around 20% which is the expectation
    value for the random assignment of five equally frequent classes. Hence, for images
    with bit depths in-between 50 bins and 1000 bins we can state an increase from
    20% to more than 90% which equals an increase by more than 70 percent points.
    The gain of the intra-class over the inter-class similarity, that is, the class
    discrimination, is will be studied quantitatively in the following. The Octonion
    fusion in Table 3 indicates that the linear scaling is superior only for high
    radiometric sampling. For less than 20 bins, the gain is higher using logarithmic
    and normalized elements. With respect to 16 bins that equals a 4 bit image, the
    values for normalized elements still range around 20 dB which means that the similarity
    of samples belonging to the same class is around one hundred times higher than
    the similarity of samples belonging to different classes. Hence, the class discrimination
    is assured. The fusion on the Sedenion basis presented in Table 4 enables a gain
    in similarity of more than 30 dB which equals a thousand times the inter-class
    similarity. The gain using linear elements decreases almost continuously with
    the reduction of the radiometric sampling to zero. The gain achieved using the
    logarithmic or normalized elements only seldom falls below 10 dB, that is, the
    intra-class similarity is always ten times higher than the inter-class similarity
    independently from the radiometric sampling. The additional increase of the Sedenion
    fusion over the Octonion fusion is due to the higher number of channels and the
    completely different composition of the channels: Sentinel-1 with Sentinel-2 for
    the Octonion fusion and Sentinel-2 with ALOS-PALSAR-2 for the Sedenion fusion.
    The choice of the reference samples has another impact that cannot be denied.
    Anyway, the SAR-Optics fusion on the Sedenion basis would also allow the reduction
    of the radiometric sampling to a 3 bit image with 8 bins and still provides a
    class discrimination of factor ten which is unbeaten so far with respect to the
    low storage requirement. The images thus can be stored with 3 bit only, which
    enables the further compression with the typical spatial approaches available
    for most image formats. Figure 12 illustrates the similarity gain for certain
    land cover classes separately. In almost all subfigures, be it for the Octonion
    fusion (left column) or the Sedenion fusion (right column), the normalized Kennaugh-like
    elements provide the highest similarity gain, see solid line. Only for the “Water”
    class in the Sedenion fusion (Figure 12b), linear elements seems to excel the
    logarithmic and normalized elements. This effect can be attributed to the very
    low response leading to unstable spectral properties which have to be covered
    by the classification algorithm. In the case of “Forest” a similar effect can
    be observed in the Octonion fusion (Figure 12c). The “Meadow” class indicates
    a negative similarity gain, that is, a loss accuracy using mean signatures in
    all three scaling variants, see Figure 12h. The high variability of the “Meadow”
    class in terms of soil conditions, soil moisture, and plant phenology might be
    one reason for that. With view to classification approaches, this means that traditional
    parametric methods like MLE are not sufficient to describe the “Meadow” class
    as one homogeneous syntactic class. Thus, the “Meadow” areas have to be divided
    in several syntactic classes with a homogeneous appearance or modern machine learning
    approaches have to be utilized for the automated interpretation. Due to the low
    radiometric sampling needed for an adequate class distinction, the pre-processing
    to normalized Kennaugh-like elements even supports the usage of Machine Learning:
    (1) The images are small and easy to store. (2) The bins replace the quantiles
    often as extended feature space. (3) Inter-channel correlations play only a minor
    role as shown above. (4) Data fusion is supported in multi-spectral, multi-sensor,
    and multi-temporal manner. (5) Even the description of spatial features in image
    chips as realized in CNNs is possible, though not evaluated in detail by now.
    5. Conclusions This article develops a consistent data frame for the fusion of
    arbitrary collocated raster data sets. The core of the novel fusion technique
    is an orthogonal transform on hypercomplex bases producing Kennaugh-like elements.
    The combination can cover multi-spectral, multi-source, and multi-temporal data
    sets. The description of spatial characteristics by multi-row and multi-column
    combination is envisaged. Multi-source image fusion results in vectors of Kennaugh-like
    elements. Multi-source and multi-temporal image fusion produces Kennaugh matrices
    with the image channel dimensionality along the rows and the time dimensionality
    along the columns. These linear intensities and intensity differences, respectively,
    can be further scaled to logarithmic—almost normally distributed—and even normalized
    elements characterized by a closed data range and a high resilience towards the
    reduction of the radiometric sampling to 4 bit or even less than that. The method
    is exemplary applied to Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and ALOS-PALSAR-2 single acquisitions
    of three different regions of interest in Germany and time series of Sentinel-2
    over a wetland near the Alps. Due to its flexibility regarding the scaling, any
    data set with additive or multiplicative characteristics can be used as input
    layers. A qualitative assessment of the multi-temporal image fusion indicated
    that the Kennaugh-like elements highlight characteristics that were not visible
    at all in the standard preparation. Furthermore, the quantitative analysis of
    multi-source Kennaugh-like elements underlined the stability of the signatures
    describing typical land cover classes that are distinguishable even with a extremely
    reduced radiometric sampling of only two bins. The latter point is of importance
    with respect to modern classification techniques like histogram classifications
    and Random Forest approaches. The Random Forest method (e.g.) combines a large
    number of random decision trees in order to stabilize the decision. Each node
    is a binary sampling which is now simply possible using normalized Kennaugh-like
    elements in a binary radiometric sampling. This article can only presents the
    basic idea of a data fusion approach and delivers first hints on its suitability
    explained by the help of selected experiments. Its practical use has to be evaluated
    in future studies covering more different landscapes, different sensors, and different
    classification algorithms. With respect to sharpening approaches of image data
    fusion with different spatial resolution, the inclusion of weights representing
    the look factors might be one technical further development. One application-oriented
    focus will be the analysis of polarimetric SAR time series over Mid-European forests
    in order to detect and map calamities in a timely manner. The presented methodology
    further shall be implemented as extension of the Multi-SAR System in order to
    support ARD data provision to scientific users. The long-term goal will be to
    establish the normalized Kennaugh-like elements on hypercomplex bases as future
    standard for multi-dimensional ARD sets in so-called data cubes. Author Contributions

  description: In Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), a dense deployment of sensor nodes
    produce data that contain intra-temporal and inter-spatial correlation. To reduce
    the intensity of correlation, we propose in-node data aggregation technique that
    eliminates redundancy in the sensed data in an energy-efficient manner. A novel
    data-driven approach is adopted to perform in-node data aggregation using an underlying
    cluster-based hierarchical network. Our proposed approach partially processes
    the data at each member node and forwards a fraction of the actual data, i.e.,
    fused data, towards the cluster head. At each member node, the raw captured data
    is categorized into various classes, i.e., stratum. Each member node continuously
    senses the environment for temperature readings and compares them with the mean
    values of various strata. If the temperature reading is less than or greater than
    the mean value, it is compared with the existing Min/Max of that particular stratum.
    If in case, the new reading is less than/greater than the Min/Max of a particular
    stratum, it replaces these values, accordingly. Our proposed approach is computationally
    lightweight, energy-efficient and reduces the degree of correlation among the
    resource-constrained sensor nodes. As as a result, communication cost, packet
    collision and network congestion are reduced and the network lifetime is enhanced.
    The analytical results prove the validity and effectiveness of our proposed approach.

    © 2016 1 Introduction Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have felt their presence
    in almost every domain of daily life. The building blocks of these networks are
    densely-deployed miniature sensor nodes that are capable of sensing, processing,
    communication and coordination among each others to monitor a particular physical
    phenomenon. Each node senses the environment and processes any captured data,
    locally. Upon in-network data aggregation, the processed information is forwarded
    via gateways to the base station for further analysis, decision making and storage
    [1, 4]. The performance of these miniature and resource-constrained nodes is adversely
    affected due to in-node operations, i.e., communication, processing and sensing.
    Among these operations, data transmission consumes a much higher energy. Therefore,
    novel and energy-efficient in-node data proccessing techniques are required to
    reduce the communication cost of the network [2]. The limited energy issue poses
    a plethora of challenges for data aggregation that prevent the complete exploration
    of these networks. Moreover, the energy-constrained nature of the nodes are further
    worsen by the fact that they are deployed in a harsh, unattended, and sometimes
    human-inaccessible terrains [3]. Replacing or recharging their batteries is a
    cumbersome task and sometimes impossible. Although, various energy conservation
    and scavenging techniques are proposed in literature, data aggregation still remains
    an open research area due to the resource-starving nature of these networks. Among
    the existing protocols of WSNs, cluster-based hierarchical routing protocols are
    the most efficient ones in term of data aggregation [22, 27, 29, 40]. These protocols
    partition the whole network into several clusters. Each cluster has a designated
    cluster head that is responsible to manage the nodes, i.e., member nodes, within
    that particular cluster. Each cluster head collects data from its member nodes
    within a cluster and broadcasts to the base station. These protocols have been
    widely studied by the research community to satisfy the scalability objective
    and achieve a prolonged network lifetime for WSNs. In cluster-based hierarchical
    WSNs, in-network data aggregation partially offloads the computation from cluster
    heads [23]. The member nodes locally process the data by using various data aggregation
    and fusion techniques. The use of in-network processing eliminates the need of
    transmitting raw redundant data to the base station via the cluster heads. Although,
    there exists numerous studies in cluster-based hierarchical WSNs for elimination
    of redundancy using various data aggregation techniques, the latter still remains
    an open research area. This is mainly due to the absence of computationally lightweight
    and energy conserving techniques in view of limited resources of the nodes. In
    cluster-based hierarchical WSNs, energy conservation can be achieved using two
    different approaches, i.e., a low-duty cycling approach [5, 34] and a data-driven
    approach [8, 36]. The latter is achieved using in-network, also known as in-node
    processing. In this paper, we limit our discussion to data-driven approaches by
    proposing a novel and energy-efficient in-node data processing for a cluster-based
    hierarchical WSN [11]. Initially, at each member node, the real-time sensed data
    is divided into subgroups called stratum, similar to stratified sampling [15].
    The startum that we have designed are based on the previous historical and archival
    data captured by [25]. Each member node constantly senses the environment for
    temperature readings and compare with a given stratum. In our proposed work, there
    are seven stratum, each one having a particular range for temperature readings.
    The proposed approach has two distinct but interrelated phases. 1. Comparison
    with the mean value of a particular stratum. 2. The new minimum (Min) and maximum
    (Max) values, obtained from the previous phase, are compared with the old values
    that already exists within that particular stratum in order to choose the Min/Max
    for that stratum. During the first phase, upon sensing a new temperature reading,
    the sensor node compares it with the mean of a particular stratum to confirm whether
    the newly sensed value is within the Min/Max range. If this value is equal to
    the mean, it is simply discarded. If it is less than/greater than the mean value,
    the second phase initiates. In case, the new value is less than the mean value,
    a comparison is made with the Min of that stratum. If the new value is greater
    than the Min, it is discarded. However, if it is less than the Min, the new value
    replaces the existing Min and becomes the new Min. A similar comparison is made
    for the Max as well. If the new reading is less than the Max, it is discarded,
    otherwise, it becomes the new Max of that particular stratum. This process is
    repeated each time for a specific stratum whenever a new value is sensed. As a
    result, each stratum stores only two values, i.e., Min/Max, and are forwarded
    by each node to its respective cluster head after a certain period of time. Finally,
    data redundancy is examined at the cluster head level for each packet received
    from a member node. At this stage, the data of member nodes in close proximity
    to each other are compared. This eliminates the burden on cluster heads to compare
    the data received from all the member nodes. As a result, the energy consumption
    of the cluster heads is significantly reduced that extends the life time of the
    underlying network. The main benefit of our proposed approach is that it performs
    in-node processing cost whenever possible, to conserve the communication cost.
    Our proposed approach significantly reduces the volume of data forwarded to the
    base station that in turn, reduces the network congestion [33] The main contributions
    of this paper are as follow. 1. We have proposed an energy-efficient and computationally
    lightweight in-node processing and aggregation technique. The design of our proposed
    method is simple to match the resource-constrained nature of sensor nodes. 2.
    The system model of our proposed method is validated analytically using various
    mathematical expressions. It achieves a higher quality of service (QoS) by controlling
    congestion to a greater extent and prolongs the network lifetime by performing
    energy-efficient in-node processing. The rest of this paper is organized as follow.
    In Section 2, we provide the literature review of various approaches used for
    data aggregation in cluster-based hierarchical WSNs. In Section 3, we provide
    the network model of our proposed scheme. In Section 4, our proposed model for
    stratified sampling is discussed and its analytical analysis is provided. In Section
    5, we provide the experimental results of our proposed scheme. Finally, the paper
    is concluded and future research directions are provided in Section 6. 2 Literature
    review In WSNs, energy conservation is accomplished using duty cycling and data-driven
    approaches [9, 41, 42]. In duty cycling, the nodes switch between active and sleep
    modes, whenever required. Thus, energy of the nodes is preserved during the sleep
    mode [9]. In this paper, we restrict our discussion to data-driven approaches,
    only. These approaches utilize the storage and processing capabilities of the
    nodes by performing in-network processing that saves valuable energy of the nodes
    [42]. The use of in-network processing lowers the number of packets transmitted
    across the network by partially processing the data locally at the sensor nodes,
    prior to base station’s transmission. Instead of sending raw data to the base
    station, a node exploits the correlation between the data packets and transmits
    a subset of data packets. Such transmission reduces data redundancy by eliminating
    the duplicate packets. In-network processing can be accomplished using various
    techniques such as data compression and data aggregation [39]. In data compression,
    the original input data stream is converted into a compressed stream [21, 24].
    Data compression aims at exploring the compact representation of non-random data
    by reducing the number of packets forwarded towards the base station [35]. In
    WSNs, compression can be classified as sampling compression [19]. data compression
    [14, 37] and communication compression [32, 38]. Data aggregation, on the other
    hand, refers to in-network aggregation of raw data and routing them via multi-hop
    links. The gathered data is processed at the intermediate nodes, i.e., by fusing
    together sensor readings related to a similar event, in order to reduce the energy
    consumption and prolong network lifetime [13]. One the most fundamental and challenging
    issue in WSNs is data redundancy that exists in the sensor readings gathered by
    the nodes. This highly correlated data consume substantial amount of network’s
    energy and causes congestion during transmission across the network. Moreover,
    if the data with such redundancy reaches the decision center, e.g., the base station,
    it can adversely affect the analysis and decision making process. Hence, it is
    a challenging issue that needs to be addressed to achieve efficient data aggregation.
    In literature, there exists various studies that use data aggregation to filter
    out redundant data in WSNs [28, 30]. In [17], the authors proposed an efficient
    data aggregation technique for cluster-based periodic wireless sensor networks
    (CPWSNs). Data aggregation is performed in two steps. Initially, the data is partially
    aggregated at the member nodes, i.e., local data aggregation, before forwarding
    it to their respective cluster heads. Next, repetition in the data set is eliminated
    at each cluster head using three methods, i.e., the jaccard function, one-way
    anova model and Bartlett test, and euclidean and cosine method. These methods
    are used to check similarities, conditional variance and dissimilarities between
    the data sets. Although, the proposed scheme reduces data redundancy, it does
    not take into account the complexity at the member nodes. A dynamical message
    list based data aggregation (DMLDA) approach for cluster-based WSNs was proposed
    in [12]. DMLDA aimed at designing a computationally lightweight and high filtering
    efficient scheme in a distributed network architecture. The proposed scheme defined
    a special data structure at each aggregating node, i.e., cluster heads, which
    contains the history of data prior to its transmission. This data structure is
    used for data aggregation to filter out irrelevant and repeated data. The proposed
    scheme achieves data aggregation at cluster heads only and as such, ignores its
    importance at the basic level, i.e., at the member nodes. As a result, the cluster
    heads drain their energy much earlier. Moreover, the proposed scheme does not
    take into account the number of packets traversing the network. A cluster-based
    data aggregation technique was proposed in [16]. The proposed scheme eliminates
    data redundancy among the data sets with a minimum data latency. To achieve these
    goals, the proposed approach integrates K-Means algorithm at the first stage and
    a prefix frequency filtering (PFF) at the second stage. During the first stage,
    K-Means algorithm is employed that grouped together similar data sets into clusters.
    Next, a prefix frequency filtering (PFF) technique is employed at each cluster
    of the data set to reduce the number of comparisons being made by lowering the
    data latency. The simulation results show the validity of the proposed approach,
    however, it lacks energy evaluation and number of packet reduction during aggregation.
    Moreover, K-Means algorithm needs be applied on the prefixed as opposed to the
    whole data set to increase accuracy of the proposed approach. To overcome the
    drawbacks of [16], a novel prefix-based data aggregation approach was proposed
    for a cluster-based network architecture [6]. Unlike the existing data aggregation
    schemes that rely on computing similarity values, the proposed approach filters
    data based on the quality of information. The proposed approach has two distinct
    phases. During the first phase, the member nodes compact their measurements according
    to jaccard similarity function to estimate the similarity between various sets
    of data. In the second phase, data aggregation is carried out at the cluster head
    level using frequency filtering technique. To improve accuracy and reduce error
    in measurements, the experimental results need to be carried out using various
    filtering techniques. A data fusion-average median sampling (DF-AMS) approach
    was proposed for WSNs in [20]. The proposed scheme combines data aggregation with
    sampling and operates in two stages. During the first stage, a sample of nodes
    among the member nodes within a cluster are selected, based on their residual
    energy. These sample nodes transmit data to their respective cluster heads. During
    the second stage, the cluster heads perform data aggregation on the raw data captured
    by the sample nodes, using the median and maximum method. A novel suffix-prefix
    filtering for data aggregation was presented in [18]. The proposed approach performs
    data aggregation at two levels: node level and cluster head level. This approach
    is computationally lightweight, eliminates redundancy to a greater extent and
    reduces the volume of data transmitted across the network. Moreover, the proposed
    approach outperforms the existing prefix filtering techniques in term of various
    quality of service (QoS) metrics. Although, there exists many studies to eliminate
    redundancy using various data aggregation techniques, the latter still remains
    an open research area due to the absence of computationally lightweight techniques
    in view of limited resources of the nodes. The main objective of our work is to
    introduce a comprehensive, yet simple and lightweight data aggregation scheme
    to meet the resource-constrained nature of sensor nodes. Unlike the existing data
    aggregation techniques that eliminate redundancy at the cluster head level, we
    eliminate it at the fine-grained level, i.e., at the member nodes. Our proposed
    scheme considers the energy of nodes while performing data aggregation and has
    reduced complexity in comparison to the existing schemes. 3 Network model For
    our proposed scheme, we consider a cluster-based hierarchical architecture of
    Fig. 1. This type of network model is typically found in large-scale WSNs, partitioned
    by cluster-based protocols. In this figure, A, B and C are the source nodes that
    need to send a varying number of packets to a cluster head M. We assume that each
    node has the battery capacity of sending 1500 data packets, only. For the source
    nodes, the shortest path to the cluster head is the same, i.e., via node D, with
    minimum number of hop counts. If these source nodes transmit their data packets
    to node D prior to the cluster head, it will create an energy hot spot problem
    for the nodes near the host spot region. This will exhaust their energy earlier
    than expected due to the large volume of traffic that passes through this route
    towards the cluster head. On the other hand, if the same traffic is diverted through
    multiple paths, the situation may be different for node D. It is obvious that
    if the communication pattern is changed from shortest to multiple paths, the network
    lifetime will be prolonged due to the presence of relay nodes. We made the following
    assumptions during the evaluation of our proposed scheme. 1. We assume that the
    network dies whenever the first node dies, i.e., stability period. 2. The packet
    size is 128 bytes 3. Transmission cost of a packet is 1.064 μ joule. 4. The node
    sampling/sensing rate is 1 packet/second. Fig. 1 Proposed network architecture
    Full size image 4 Our proposed scheme: a data-driven approach In this section,
    we provide analytical analysis of our proposed model in Section 4.1, followed
    by a detailed description of the proposed scheme in Section 4.2. 4.1 Analytical
    analysis In our proposed scheme, the member nodes of each cluster capture the
    data and place them according to various stratum. These stratum are defined within
    the buffer of each node. We have defined seven stratum, ranging from 260C to 32.990C,
    for the temperature readings captured by the member nodes. These seven stratum
    are designed based on the previous historical and archival data captured by [25].
    However, temperature is a seasonal parameter that changes dynamically. Hence,
    the stratum storing these temperature values changes dynamically as well. Thus,
    the number of stratum may varies from few to many, based on the weather conditions
    and the readings captured in real-time from the sensing field. Once a new value
    is sensed by a member node, it is placed into the appropriate stratum, based on
    its reading. Let each stratum be defined as follow. $$\\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}}
    S_{1}=\\left\\{26.00...26.99\\right\\} \\\\ S_{2}=\\left\\{27.00...27.99\\right\\}
    \\\\ S_{3}=\\left\\{28.00...28.99\\right\\} \\\\ S_{4}=\\left\\{29.00...29.99\\right\\}
    \\\\ S_{5}=\\left\\{30.00...30.99\\right\\} \\\\ S_{6}=\\left\\{31.00...31.99\\right\\}
    \\\\ S_{7}=\\left\\{32.00...32.99\\right\\} \\end{array} $$ Although, our proposed
    scheme utilizes only seven stratum, it can be configured up to nth stratum based
    on an application requirements, as shown in Eq. 1. $$ \\qquad S_{n} = \\beta ...
    \\beta \\gamma. $$ (1) Here, β ∈ N, where, 26 < β < 32, γ = 0.99 and N is a natural
    number. Next, we define a function f to take into account the changes incurred
    in each stratum with respect to time and temperature, as shown in Eq. 2. Here,
    α is the seasonal change in temperature and t is the time. $$ f=\\sum\\limits_{i
    = 1}^{n} S_{i}(t, \\alpha). $$ (2) For each stratum, we define Min (Sn) = Si and
    Max (Sn) = Sj, such that $$ S_{i}, \\quad \\alpha < m(S_{i}, S_{j}). $$ (3) and
    $$ S_{j}, \\quad \\alpha > m(S_{i}, S_{j}). $$ (4) Here, m is the mean of Si,
    Sj. Based on Eqs. 3 and 4, the value of f(Sn) is equal to 0, when α = m, i.e.,
    at the critical point. Using the above calculations, we have $$ f(S_{n})= \\left\\{\\begin{array}{lllll}
    S_{i}, \\quad if &\\alpha& < &m&, \\\\ 0, \\quad if &\\alpha& = &m&,\\\\ S_{j},
    \\quad if &\\alpha& > &m&. \\end{array}\\right. $$ (5) Proof of Eq. 5 Let’s consider
    the quadratic Taylor polynomial for a function f, centered at m, such that, $$
    f(S_{i}) \\approx f(m)+f^{\\prime}(m)(m-1)+ f^{\\prime\\prime}(m)\\frac{(m-2)^{2}}{2!}.
    $$ (6) If f has a critical point at m, i.e., f′(m) = 0, this approximation reduces
    to $$ f(S_{i}) \\approx f(m)+ f^{\\prime\\prime}(m)\\frac{(m-2)^{2}}{2}. $$ (7)
    □ From Eq. 7, one can see that whenever f(m) > 0, i.e., nearer to m + 1, f behaves
    like a parabola with vertex at (m, f(m)) and a positive leading co-efficient as
    shown in Fig. 2. Therefore, the critical point at m is the location of a relative
    minimum. Similarly, the function needs to have a relative maximum at m whenever,
    f′(m) < 0. Finally, when f″(m) = 0, it is clear that the test is inconclusive
    as the newly captured data α is equal to m. Fig. 2 Parabola of MinMax Full size
    image However, additional insight into this situation can be provided by looking
    at higher degree Taylor polynomials. The cubic Taylor polynomial approximation
    for f centered at m is $$\\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} f(S_{i}) \\approx f(m)+f^{\\prime}(m)(m-1)+
    \\\\ f^{\\prime\\prime}(m)\\frac{(m-2)^{2}}{2!}+f^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}(m)\\frac{(m-3)^{3}}{3!}.
    \\end{array} $$ (8) If f′(m) < 0 and f″(m) = 0, then the Taylor approximation
    reduce to $$ f(S_{i}) \\approx f(m)+ f^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}(m)\\frac{(m-3)^{3}}{3!}
    $$ (9) Thus, nearer to m, the behavior of f(Si) is similar to that of the cubic
    function C(m − 3)3, where C is a real number. Using the above calculations, we
    can derive it for the nth series. $$\\begin{array}{@{}rcl@{}} f(S_{i}) \\approx
    f(m)+f^{\\prime}(m)(m-1)+ f^{\\prime\\prime}(m)\\frac{(m-2)^{2}}{2!}+ \\\\ f^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}(m)\\frac{(m-3)^{3}}{3!}+...+f^{(n)}(m)\\frac{(m-n)^{n}}{n!}.
    \\end{array} $$ (10) Based on Eqs. 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, f(Sn) yields $$ f(S_{n})=
    \\left\\{\\begin{array}{llllll} S_{i}, \\quad if &\\alpha& < &m& & \\\\ 0, \\quad
    if &\\alpha& = &m& &\\\\ S_{j}, \\quad if &\\alpha& > &m& & \\end{array}\\right.
    $$ (11) The whole procedure is graphically represented in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 Schematic
    diagram of the proposed analytical model Full size image 4.2 Description of the
    proposed method In our proposed approach, we considered a deployed sensor region
    A, that contains Tn nodes, where Tn = {1, 2, 3, .... , n}. These nodes are grouped
    together into equal-sized clusters Tc, where Tc= {C1, C2, C3, .... , Cn}, using
    a balanced clustering algorithm [23]. Within a cluster, each member node captures
    the raw data by sensing the environment. At the node level, we defined various
    classes, i.e., stratum, based on common characteristics, i.e., S1, S2, .... ,
    Sn. Each strata is dynamic in nature that changes according to the application
    requirements. We have designed these startum using the concept of stratified random
    sampling, a probability-based sampling method [10], for designing stratum. The
    stratified random sampling is operationally better than simple random sampling,
    especially when population units are homogeneous [31]. Our proposed scheme has
    two distinct but interrelated phases. 1. Comparison of the newly captured value
    with the mean value (m) of a stratum. 2. Comparing the value obtained from the
    previous step with either Min (Si) or Max (Sj) value of that specific stratum.
    During the first phase, whenever a new reading is captured by Tn, it goes into
    an appropriate stratum. To decide the range of a stratum, i.e., MinMax, the value
    of new reading is compared with m of that particular stratum. In the next phase,
    there are two probable conditions. The data may either be a new Min or Max that
    replace the current value within a specific stratum. For instance, if the new
    value obtained from the previous step is confirmed as Min, then, this value is
    compared with the existing Min value. The smaller among the two is chosen as the
    new Min value of that particular stratum. However, for the Max value, the new
    value is compared with the current Max value, and the greater among the two is
    chosen as the new Max value of that particular stratum. This process is repeated
    for each stratum. Moreover, the same procedures are repeated each time a new value
    is captured by a node. As a result, each stratum contains only two values, i.e.,
    MinMax, which are forwarded from each stratum of a given member node to its respective
    cluster head at a predefined interval. At the cluster head level, data redundancy
    is checked again among the data packets that it has received from its member nodes.
    However, the received packets from only those member nodes are compared that are
    in close proximity of each other. As a result, there is no need to check for data
    redundancy from all the member nodes. Hence, a substantial amount of processing
    energy of the cluster heads is conserved, as shown in the Fig. 4. Fig. 4 Data
    aggregation at the cluster head level Full size image Our proposed approach achieves
    its goal by having a maximum of only two comparisons for real-time data, i.e.,
    mean and MinMax [7, 26]. Thus, the performance and computational complexity of
    our proposed approach remain constant with an increase in the size of captured
    data. In existing data aggregation algorithms, the computational complexity increases
    with an increase in the size of captured data. Hence, the performance of a node
    is degraded, that shortens its lifetime. Our proposed approach lowers the network
    traffic, network congestion and packet collision rate. The stratum of each member
    node transmits only two packets after 1 minute, i.e., 14 packets from the strata
    of a single node. The proposed scheme has a very lower complexity of O(n), where
    n is so small that is equal to order 1 and is considered as O(1). Hence, a considerable
    amount of energy is conserved. The detailed description of our proposed approach
    is shown in the Algorithm below. Based on our Algorithm, The data flow diagram
    of our scheme is presented in Fig. 5. Fig. 5 Data flow diagram Full size image
    5 Experimental results There are two main objectives of our proposed approach,
    i.e., energy efficiency and congestion control. To achieve these objectives, we
    performed in-network processing to conserve the communication cost. Upon analytical
    validation of our proposed technique in Section 4, we provide the experimental
    results here. In this section, we compared our scheme in terms of energy consumption,
    number of transmitted packets, processing cost and communication cost. In Fig.
    6, the energy consumption of a source node, i.e., member node, in presence and
    absence of our proposed approach is shown, with respect to time. The energy consumption
    of a node is reduced by 23% while employing our proposed aggregation technique.
    In this figure, the absence of our proposed scheme means that the source nodes
    do not employ any data aggregation and forward highly redundant and correlated
    data to the cluster heads. In absence of our proposed scheme, the energy consumption
    is almost double after 120 minutes of network deployment. The increase in energy
    consumption deteriorates the lifetime of WSNs. Fig. 6 Energy consumption vs. Time
    Full size image In Fig. 7, the realistic scenarios of different number of refined
    packets (after performing data aggregation) with respect to various nodes are
    shown. In Fig. 7a and b, the number of nodes varies from 1 to 10 and the time
    varies from 1 minute to 60 minutes, respectively. The main objective was to study
    and validate our claim that our proposed technique reduces congestion to a greater
    extent by reducing the number of packets. Recall from Eqs. 3 and 4 in Sec. 4.1,
    only two packets from each stratum can be transmitted. This is in contrary to
    traditional approaches where each packet is forwarded towards the destination
    containing redundant data. This substantially reduces the network traffic, lowers
    congestion and ultimately bandwidth of the network. Fig. 7 Number of refined packets
    vs. number of nodes (in term of time) Full size image In Fig. 8, the lifetime
    of WSN with respect to sensor nodes’ capacity is shown. The network lifetime is
    the time interval at which the base station receives the last packet before the
    death of its first node. Our proposed scheme integrates the shortest path algorithm
    with our MinMax aggregation technique. In this figure, we compare our proposed
    scheme with two existing schemes, i.e., shortest path based scheme and multiple
    path based scheme. On y-axis, the lifetime of the network is shown, while on x-axis,
    the sensor node’ capacity, i.e., number of packets that a node receives and transmits
    with the available battery power, is shown. We have investigated the WSN lifetime
    by assuming different capacities of a node. The evaluation results show that our
    proposed scheme is exceptionally better in terms of WSN lifetime as compared to
    the existing algorithms. Fig. 8 WSN lifetime vs. sensor node capacity Full size
    image In Fig. 9, the energy consumption of our proposed scheme is shown for a
    varying number of nodes. In this figure, the energy consumption for a varying
    number of nodes is evaluated in presence and absence of data aggregation. In presence
    of our proposed data aggregation, the energy consumption is more than 3 times
    lower when the number of deployed nodes are 90 in the network, as shown in Fig.
    9a. In case of 800 deployed nodes, the energy consumption is 18.8 times lower
    in comparison to absence of an aggregation approach, as shown in Fig. 9b. These
    results show that our proposed approach has substantially reduced the energy consumption
    with varying number of nodes. However, the proposed approach suffer from delay
    that occur due to in-node aggregation. Data is kept in the nodes for a predefined
    time. Thus, our proposed approach is not suitable for delay sensitive applications
    such as military application, where quick responses are required for critical
    and strategic decision making. However, this delay may be reduced if the sampling
    interval in reduced from 1 minute to 15 or 30 seconds, that will ultimately reduces
    the delay up to 50 % or more, improving efficiency of the proposed approach. Fig.
    9 Energy consumption vs. varying number of nodes Full size image 6 Conclusion
    In this paper, we have proposed a novel and energy-efficient in-network data aggregation
    approach for a cluster-based hierarchical network. Each member node captures a
    temperature reading and compares it against a particular stratum. Based on its
    value, the Min and Max of that specific stratum is configured. The use of Min/Max
    permits a node to send only two values to the cluster head, after a pre-defined
    time interval. The proposed approach eliminates the burden of transmitting the
    whole of raw data from the member nodes to a base station via the cluster heads.
    Our approach is lightweight as it requires a maximum of two comparisons for real-time
    data, i.e., mean and Min/Max. Moreover, the transmission of only two values from
    each stratum lowers the communication cost, packet collision rate, network congestion
    and extends the network life time. Our proposed approach has a much better energy
    conservation with respect to time, reduced number of generated packets, better
    lifetime with respect to node capacity and reduced energy consumption with respect
    to number of deployed nodes. In future, we aim to evaluate our proposed approach
    in a real-world scenario using testbeds. We also aim to evaluate our approach
    for heterogeneous applications that collect diversified data. Moreover, the feasibility
    of the proposed scheme needs to be tested in tree and flat-based networks. References

- analysis: '"IoT Technology for Smart Water System" offers an overview of the architecture
    and applications of IoT in water management, highlighting the necessity of real-time
    monitoring and data management to ensure water quality. The paper provides a comprehensive
    analysis of the parameters and factors involved in determining water quality and
    emphasizes the integration of various technologies to enhance the efficiency of

    Location: Exeter, UK SECTION I. Indroduction Intelligent monitoring is defined
    as a method which is used to monitor, control, manage and optimize the network
    by using different computational methods that will provide customers with relevant
    tools and information [1]. The internet of things (IoT) forms an important part
    of intelligent monitoring which connects people and devices using wireless sensor
    technology. It is a fast growing research area in the military. enerzy managernent.
    healthcare and many more. The concept of IoT was proposed by Kevin Ashton to demonstrate
    a set of interconnected devices [1]. IoT makes it possible to transfer information
    between different electronic devices embedded with new technology. The energy
    management is possible using energy harvesting mechanisms, which is a method of
    collecting energy from natural sources such as light, vibration, pressure etc.
    The combination of technologies such as Wireless sensor network (WSN), Radio frequency
    identification (RFID), Energy harvesting(EH) and Artificial Intelligence (AI)
    helps IoT to flourish widely. Water distribution system(WDS) is a very important
    research area that affects the economic growth of our country. WDS mainly have
    two issues, first is the water loss due to leakage and the second is that it is
    prone to contamination. It is affecting the health and safety of the people. According
    to the report of world health organization (WHO) in 2017, around 2.1 billion people
    around the world lack safe drinking water. So there is a need to ensure the water
    quality and wastage by using Iot to reduce such issue. There are different traditional
    methods to collect water datasets to measure its quality, but managing and monitoring
    the data from WDS in real time is challenging as the data is heterogeneous, data
    collection is time-consuming, energy required for processing, coverage and connectivity
    of the nodes in the network. By using IoT and combining technologies such as WSN,
    AI and EH can be used to ensure the water quality in real time and alerts the
    users to take remedial measures. In this survey, we look at the need of IoT in
    smart water system. In the first step, a basic architecture is selected and applied
    in WDS by analysing and comparing different technologies, equipment, cost and
    methods to build a smart water system. It reveals the need for an IoT architecture
    with technologies combined for water distribution system. It also takes into account
    of its advantages and disadvantages based on the literature review. The selection
    of the best choice can be identified for smart water system at the end of this
    step. The next step involves selection of the parameters required using IoT for
    water distribution. At this step, the current issues during the selection of parameters
    and some suitable suggestions are provided. Finally, an overview of the benefits
    which is necessary to implement IoT in smart water system is discussed. The survey
    structure is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the basic architecture and
    technologies applied at each layer in IoT for water management and section 3 specifies
    the parameters required to identify water quality, section 4 provides the applications
    of IoT in water and section 5 explains the benefits of IoT in smart water system
    based on the architecture and concluding with section 6. SECTION II. Architecture
    There are different architectures proposed by different authors based on the type
    and level of security required by each application. A six layered architecture
    has been proposed in [2] by combining Web services, RFID and WSN whereas a five
    level architecture has been mentioned in [4] based on telecommunication management
    network. The basic and simple architecture [3] consists of three layers which
    are perception, network and application layer. This architecture will be used
    in the review paper focusing on WDS. A. Perception Layer The main use of the perception
    layer is to connect devices and collect data for processing from the IoT network.
    This layer consists of sensors, EH devices when applied to WDS. Different types
    of sensors are available commercially which is used to detect water monitoring
    in real time. A sensor network using electrochemical optical sensors [7] is one
    among the sensors to identify temperature, water flow, pH etc. Another one is
    kapta 3000 AC4 to measure chlorine, temperature, pressure and conductivity of
    the water and it costs around 3200 pounds whereas spectro::lyser is another one
    to monitor colour, turbidity, COD, BTX 03 etc. with a longer range and costs about
    11000 pounds. Smart water solution by libelium is another sensor in identifying
    water contaminants and costs around 5000 pounds [5], [6]. The choice of the water
    quality sensor depends upon the cost, efficiency and the selection of the water
    quality attributes. Energy harvesting is a method of collecting energy from different
    natural sources such as light, wind, vibration etc. and converting it into electricity
    to power up a device or extend its battery life. Table I. Commercially available
    water quality sensors and the measuring parameters Energy harvesting module is
    an electronic device used to generate energy and manage it for the working of
    its connected sensors, processing and communication units [14]. Energy harvesting
    methods are gaining more research interest each year due to their different properties.
    The new energy harvesting methods and their desirable properties such as low cost,
    efficiency, availability and high robustness could benefit the water management
    system [15]. Table II. Harvesting techniques against energy produced and cost
    The selection of the energy harvesting method is based on the type and location
    of the application. Kinetic, radiant, thermal and biochemical are the sources
    used to generate energy. The amount of energy produced by energy harvesting depends
    upon the pressure, flow rate and structure of the pipelines. Table 1 provides
    a list of the available harvesting techniques and the amount of power and cost
    involved in each method [15],– , [17]. The energy harvesting methods suitable
    for water monitoring are the solar cell, piezo electric, electro-magnetic, fuel
    cell and thermo-electric. The practical implementation of solar cell seems to
    be difficult as the transferring of energy to underground water pipelines will
    be difficult whereas the fuel cell uses a chemical reaction to generate power
    which will be a slow process. The piezoelectric, electromagnetic and thermoelectric
    are the other three methods which are used widely for monitoring water pipelines
    [18]–[20]. Table 2 provides a comparison of these three techniques in the wireless
    network. The selection of the harvesting method was based on considering its advantages
    and disadvantages that were analysed during the literature [21],– , [23]. Table
    III. COMPARISON OF HARVESTING techniques USED IN WATER pipelines[20], –, , [23]
    B. Network Layer The network layer of IoT in WDS combines processing, managing
    and transmission of the data passed from the perception layer. This layer also
    helps in managing the network devices and communication technologies for transmission.
    The communication technology is classified into two based on the range of transmission.
    The cellular technology is used when long-distance transmission is required by
    using 2G, 3G, 4G [26]. The GSM, GPRS are some of the protocols used for long distance
    transmission. It requires more power consumption which makes them not much feasible
    for WDN. The short range protocols include Zigbee, 61owpan, Radio frequency identification
    (RFID). The RFID uses an electronically programmed tag that is used to used to
    collect data [27]. The need of a programmed static tag makes it unreliable to
    use for measurement. The 61owpan is an IP based protocol which can be easily connected
    to another IP network without any gateways. Another advantage is its low cost
    and power consumption. It supports both star and mesh topology. LoRa (Low Power
    Wide Area Network) is another protocol which gained public interest due to its
    low power consumption, cost and high data rate when applied in IoT and it uses
    the star topology. Zigbee is a widely used low power wireless protocol that provides
    low cost, security during communication. It also supports star, mesh and tree
    topology [26]. The advantages of 61owpan, LoRa and Zigbee make the best choices
    to be used in WDS. Another technology that could be integrated with WDS is Artificial
    intelligence(AI). It is defined as a system that helps in problem-solving, decision-making,
    data identification, processing. Adaptive Neuro fuzzy inference system is one
    among the new AI method to predict the wastewater quality from industries [28]
    whereas an adaptive network based fuzzy system is used in [29] to detect the water
    quality from a paper mill. Artificial neural networks (ANN) and AI algorithms
    are also used in the water industry to monitor and predict the water quality which
    provides accurate results [30]. C. Application Layer The application layer manages
    the applications that will be used in WDS. This layer also provides user''s security
    and privacy. Cloud computing is one of the upcoming technology that could be used
    in the application layer of the WDS. Cloud computing is a solution for the storage,
    processing and management of heterogeneous data from different wireless devices
    and the cost of the service is based on the usage [31]. It can be considered as
    a separate layer between network and application layer. It helps IoT in storing
    backup data''s, analysis and prediction of the received data based on each application.
    SECTION III. Parameters in Smart Water System The parameters to detect the water
    quality depends on the property they exhibit and where it is applied. There are
    a number of parameters to detect the water quality, but monitoring all the parameters
    will affect the increase in workload and thereby affecting the quality of analysis.
    The parameters that are usually used to detect water quality in the pipeline include
    chemical, physical and biological properties. A. Quality Factors The chemical
    properties include pH, dissolved oxygen and oxidation-reduction potential. The
    amount of acidity or alkalinity of a solution is determined using pH. In WDS,
    a pH between 6 and 9 is considered normal. The ability of the water to remove
    the impurities by itself is called oxidation-reduction potential and a high value
    of oxidation-reduction potential represents the good quality of water. The dissolved
    oxygen is the amount of oxygen dissolved in water and it should be 0.5mg/L for
    WDS [24]. The physical factors include temperature, turbidity and conductivity
    of water. Turbidity is the opacity or cloudiness due to the microscopic materials
    dissolved in the solution and it should not be less than 1NTU in WDS. High temperature
    affects the amount of oxygen in the water and disturbing the water quality [25].
    The presence of bacteria, virus, algae and pesticides forms the biological factors
    affecting the water quality [25]. These are included in the basic category to
    determine the water quality. It is rather confusing as there aren''t any international
    standard methods from any professional bodies for the selection of water quality
    parameters. B. Quantity Factors The water level, pressure of flow and velocity
    are the quantity factors that should be considered when collecting the water data.
    The ultrasonic sensors and flow sensors can be used to detect the velocity and
    identify the change in water flow [32], ,– [34]. The management of sensor data
    in real-time is difficult as centralized or distributed approach is used to handle
    them. A hybrid approach with an efficient compression technology could be used
    to handle and filter the real-time data based on the necessity and to reduce the
    cost of transmission in the network layer. C. Technological Factors The self-adapting
    network technology is a technological factor supporting the smart water system.
    The intelligent selection of stations, data fusion and forecasting to provide
    water quality information based on an emergency situation and make a rapid decision-making
    is essential for a smart water system. This could be integrated with the network
    layer of the architecture to achieve a more accurate real time monitoring [35]
    D. Topological Factors The topological factor consists of active and passive elements
    that form the network. The active element consists of valves, turbines and pumps
    through which water flow and pressure can be controlled whereas the passive element
    consists of pipes and reservoirs which depends on the active elements. Real-time
    monitoring and controlling the operations from different water sources and managing
    the operational cost is a major factor affecting the water system. The recent
    researches of different optimization methods on dynamic topology using convex
    programming, clustering etc. could be an added advantage to the smart water system
    [36]. SECTION IV. Applications of Iot in Water A. Smart Water System The smart
    water applications include water pipeline monitoring, water quality in open water
    source, smart water meter reading, IoT security for smart water system(SWS) etc.
    In order to ensure the integrity of customer information, security of the devices
    and data passed through the network, a framework and methodology were developed
    [37]. Water quality monitoring of open water sources was another application that
    was implemented using IoT devices. It helps to preserve the water quality and
    protect the health of the economy using low-cost devices and network virtualization
    [38], [39]. Another application developed due to the growth of IoT was pipe leakage
    detection. Different IoT devices, WSN and cloud service were used to detect and
    alerts the user about the pipe leakage because a good amount of water wastage
    is occurring through leakage [40]. Wastewater monitoring and treatment is another
    upcoming application in IoT to treat the wastewater and use it for household activities
    and thereby saving the amount of water to a great extent [41], [42]. B. Smart
    Irrigation IoT based mobile applications have developed in farming to control
    the amount of water for crops based on the surrounding temperature. It also manages
    the whole irrigation system by smartly monitoring the soil and growth of the crops
    and the irrigation sprinkler will get activated whenever necessary thereby reducing
    the water wastage and workload [43], [44]. C. Smart Gardening The smart gardening
    application was focused on improving the mental health of the elderly people interested
    in gardening which uses IoT for its implementation. It uses a set of sensors to
    detect the temperature, light, water, soil moisture and a mobile application to
    remind the need and amount of water and nutrients for the plants [45]. D. Aquaculture
    System The aquaculture is a technique of determining and alerting users about
    the water quality for culturing of aquatic organisms using IoT. This application
    is also used to monitor the plant''s environment in aquariums. It helped the aquatic
    farmers to recycle the water whenever they receive user alerts on their mobile
    devices and results in increased productivity [46]. Most of the applications mentioned
    above are developed in the last year which clearly depicts the growth of IoT,
    especially in water. There is a need for more research in water with the growth
    of new technologies such as IoT. SECTION V. Benefits of Iot Architecture in Water
    Management The following benefits of IoT help to expand the research into WDS.
    A. Integration of Technologies The integration of different technology has taken
    water management research to a new level. The combination of energy harvesting
    into IoT could resolve the energy management issues in the water distribution
    system. The solar cell, piezoelectric, electromagnetic and thermoelectric harvesting
    are the methods that could be integrated with the perception layer to enhance
    the smart water system. The upcoming research in micro-electro-mechanical systems
    (MEMS) such as piezoelectric nanowires, Lead zirconate titanate (PZT) films and
    multi-parameter sensor chip using iridium oxide film and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
    (XPS) analysis could also improve the research in water [47]. B. Data Storage,
    Management and Computation A solution to the storage issue of the wireless sensor
    network has been made possible by IoT-cloud combination. The use of cellular protocols,
    interaction aware schemes and clustering methods were used to store and manage
    sensor data using the cloud. Using these methods, the sensor data will be transferred
    into the cloud using specific algorithms and thereby provide network stability
    [48], [49]. Data fusion is another method to manage data in WSN. It is a method
    of automatically combining data from different sources that helps users to make
    decisions in many complicated situations. The most widely used model is Joint
    Director of Laboratories (JDL) which was developed to improve the cooperation
    and carry technological data within a group [50]. This concept has been implemented
    using the least square technique to identify the quality of water usage in houses.
    It requires more computational power and cost. The data storage and management
    are applied in the network layer of IoT architecture. C. Energy Management The
    power transfer between the sensor nodes is another technological advancement to
    manage energy in IoT for water distribution system. The thermal or magnetic field
    will be suitable for the power transfer in determining the water quality in pipelines.
    An energy efficient scheduling scheme for power transfer and a wireless power
    transfer protocol were some of the recent developments in energy management [51],
    [52]. The wireless power transfer protocol consists of two protocols, one for
    balancing the energy and the other one for checking the power of each sensor nodes
    for energy transfer. The research on scheduling is to reduce the energy consumption
    of the transmitters in software-defined wireless sensor network [51]. This technique
    could be implemented in the network layer to manage energy in water distribution
    system. As the growth IoT is rapidly increasing every year and several IoT architectures
    has been introduced based on the application. The current water distribution system
    now uses smart devices, artificial intelligent methods and MEMS which later on
    could be integrated with energy harvesting methods and more IoT devices, the basic
    architecture seems to be inefficient to be used in water distribution system with
    new technologies integrated. So there is a need for more research in creating
    an IoT architecture to be used in water distribution system. SECTION VI. Conclusion
    Water quality is a serious factor that affects the health of the economy. The
    increase in the number of IoT devices and the development of new technology requires
    a standard IoT architecture which could help the clients to create a low cost
    and efficient system. This paper discusses about the implementation of IoT in
    water distribution system on the basis of IoT architecture, upcoming technologies
    such as cloud computing, Artificial intelligence, transmission techniques etc.;
    applications and the advantage of IoT in water distribution. The paper reveals
    some of the current issues when selecting parameters for the smart water system.
    The paper also suggests some solutions by referring to the recent or upcoming
    researches which could resolve the issues and integrate them to produce a more
    cost and energy efficient smart water system. The paper also provides a comparison
    of energy harvesting methods and water quality sensors used in the current water
    pipelines to select the best method suitable for the application. The basic architecture
    of IoT lacks a proper structure and requires more research for developing and
    implementing an architecture and integrate it into the water distribution system.
    SECTION VII. Challenges and Future Work As IoT is growing every day with new technologies
    involved, new challenges arise. The IoT has encouraged people to connect to devices
    using the internet and the increase in the use of IoT devices motivated people
    to use smart technologies. The water quality in the distribution system is a serious
    factor that affects public health and smart water system provides a user-friendly
    interface to monitor the water quality in houses and take remedial measurements
    if necessary. One of the main challenges in smart water system is managing the
    cost, energy and efficiency required for water distribution system. The selection
    of water quality, quantity and topological parameters is another challenge in
    the smart water system. So there is in need of research about these challenges
    to provide a new cost and energy efficient solution to the smart water system.
    The future work will focus on developing an IoT architecture in water distribution
    system with integration of new technologies such as cloud, energy harvesting etc.

    techniques, which are able to model and analyze very complex problems. For these
    complex problems, more conventional methods have not been able to produce cost-effective,

    and applied in the last three decades for scientific research and engineering
    computing. In agricultural and biological engineering, researchers and engineers
    have developed methods of fuzzy logic, artificial neural networks, genetic algorithms,
    decision trees, and support vector machines to study soil and water regimes related
    to crop growth, analyze the operation of food processing, and support decision-making
    in precision farming. This paper reviews the development of soft computing techniques.
    With the concepts and methods, applications of soft computing in the field of
    agricultural and biological engineering are presented, especially in the soil
    and water context for crop management and decision support in precision agriculture.

    techniques, such as Fuzzy Logic (FL), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and Genetic
    Algorithms (GAs). These computing techniques, unlike hard computing, which refers
    to a huge set of conventional techniques such as stochastic and statistical methods,
    offer somewhat “inexact” solutions of very complex problems through modeling and
    analysis with a tolerance of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth, and approximation.
    In effect, soft computing is an integration of biological structures and computing
    techniques. FL developes multi-valued, non-numeric linguistic variables for modeling
    human reasoning in an imprecise environment. ANNs provides configurations made
    up of interconnecting artificial neurons that mimic the properties of biological
    neurons. GAs are a way of solving problems by mimicking the same processes nature
    uses through selection, recombination and mutation. Soft computing is used to
    achieve tractability, robustness, and provide a low cost solution with a tolerance
    of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth, and approximation. This makes soft
    computing capable of solving problems that more conventional methods have not
    yet been able to provide in a cost-effective, analytical, or complete manner.
    Among soft computing techniques, FL appears to be the first one that has established
    fundamental ideas of soft computing (Zadeh, 1965, Zadeh, 1973, Zadeh, 1981). The
    established basic ideas have influenced other techniques that arrived later. In
    1986, the Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) research group published a series
    of results and algorithms (Rumelhart and McClelland, 1986). This work gave a strong
    impetus to the study of mechanisms and structure of the brain and provided the
    catalyst for much of the subsequent research and application of ANNs. This can
    be viewed as the point at which ANNs became one of the soft computing techniques.
    GAs were developed by John Holland in 1975 and popularized by his student, David
    Goldberg (Goldberg, 1989). Currently, FL, ANNs, and GAs are considered as core
    techniques of soft computing.The current list of soft computing techniques also
    includes machine learning, probabilistic reasoning, and chaos theory. In the last
    three decades, soft computing has been extensively studied and applied for scientific
    research and engineering computing. Although applications of soft computing techniques
    were successful in solving problems, the methodology still has been advancing
    to provide new approaches for more efficient, robust, and reliable solutions.
    Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (Burges, 1998, Cristianini and Taylor, 2000) emerged
    as a set of supervised generalized linear classifiers and often provide higher
    classification accuracies than multilayer perceptron ANNs. SVMs have attracted
    greater interest in recent years. Method fusion is another advancement in soft
    computing development, which combines or cascades different soft computing techniques
    to improve system performance over any individual technique. Neuro-fuzzy systems
    are a typical example of such a fusion (Takagi and Hayashi, 1991, Horikawa et
    al., 1992, Nie and Linkens, 1992, Simpson and Jahns, 1993, Mitra and Pal, 1994,
    Jang and Sun, 1995). The behavior and stability of hard computing are more predictable.
    The computational burden of algorithms is typically either low or moderate. Thus,
    it is natural to view soft computing and hard computing as complementary. The
    fusion of them has great potential for developing high-performance, cost-effective,
    and reliable computing schemes that provide innovative solutions to problems (Ovaska
    et al., 2002). In agricultural and biological engineering, there has been some
    early research and applications of soft computing (Whittaker et al., 1991, Zhang
    and Litchfield, 1992, Eerikäinen et al., 1993) and interest in soft computing
    has grown steadily in the last decade. A summary of papers and reports were collected
    from various sources, particularly through searches of the technical library of
    the ASABE (American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers) (http://asae.frymulti.com/)
    and the National Agricultural Library of USDA (United States Department of Agriculture)
    (http://www.nal.usda.gov/). It was found that, from the early-1990s to 2008, there
    have been 165 reports and papers (65 peer reviewed) on FL, 348 (193 peer reviewed)
    on ANNs, and 83 (36 peer reviewed) on GAs. It is interesting to note that 20 reports
    and papers (13 peer reviewed) were written on SVMs from 2003 to present, 7 (2
    peer reviewed) of which were published in 2008. This may signify more interest
    in soft computing in the next decade in agricultural and biological engineering.
    Soil and water studies focused on crop management and decision support systems
    for precision agriculture include specialties such as those highlighted in Geoderma,
    a global journal of soil science, SSSAJ (Soil Science Society of America Journal),
    Journal of Soil & Water Conservation, and Journal of Precision Agriculture. In
    agricultural and biological engineering, researchers and engineers have developed
    methods for FL, ANNs, GAs, Bayesian Inference (BI), Decision Tree (DT), and SVMs
    to study soil and water regimes related to crop growth, analyze the operation
    of food processing, and support decision-making in precision farming. They have
    also used fusion techniques that include FL, ANN and GA in solving problems. However,
    we have not found applications where fusion was applied to soft computing and
    hard computing. This could be a research topic with great potential. This paper
    briefly reviews the development of soft computing techniques. With the concepts
    and methods, applications of soft computing in the field of agricultural and biological
    engineering are presented. The future of the development and application of soft
    computing in agricultural and biological engineering is discussed, especially
    in the soil and water context for crop management and in decision support in precision
    agriculture. 2. Methods of soft computing In general, soft computing includes
    the methods of FL, neuro-computing, evolutionary computing, probabilistic computing,
    belief networks, chaotic systems, and parts of learning theory (http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/∼zadeh/acprco.html).
    For research and development in agricultural and biological engineering, primary
    methods of significant utility include FL, ANNs, GAs, BI and DT. ANNs are model
    architectures and learning algorithms of neuro-computing. GAs are a particular
    class of evolutionary computation. BI is a method to realize probabilistic computing.
    DT is one of the interesting and commonly used architectures used for learning,
    reasoning and organization of datasets in soft computing. FL, ANNs, GAs, BI and
    DT have been widely applied for research and development in agricultural and biological
    engineering, especially within the last decade. 2.1. Fuzzy logic FL is a form
    of multi-valued logic derived from fuzzy set theory to deal with reasoning that
    is approximate, rather than precise. In contrast to yes/no or 0/1 binary logic
    (crisp), FL provides a set of membership values inclusively between 0 and 1 to
    indicate the degree of truth (fuzzy). Fig. 1 shows the difference between a crisp
    set and a fuzzy set by comparing the characteristic functions of the two sets.
    For the crisp set (Fig. 1(a)) the characteristic function of A is assigned a value
    of 1 or 0 to each value in X, a value set of a physical property. 1 for A indicates
    that corresponding values in X belong to the set A. 0 for A indicates that corresponding
    values in X do not belong to the set A. The concept of the crisp set is sufficient
    for many applications but is not for some applications that require flexibility.
    In the fuzzy set the characteristic function of A is assigned a value between
    0 and 1, including 0 and 1, to each value in X. 1 or 0 for A still indicate that
    corresponding values in X belong or do not belong to the set A. The values between
    0 and 1 for A indicate that the corresponding values in X belong to the set A
    in a certain degree from low, medium, to high with the increase of the A value.
    Fig. 1(b) shows a typical characteristic function of the fuzzy set. With the characteristic
    function the membership function for a fuzzy set can be constructed to quantify
    the magnitude of belonging of each input. The membership functions may be different
    in shape and interval. The logic operations such as AND and OR can implemented
    with the different membership functions to generate a resultant membership function.

    and fuzzy sets (b > d > a > c > 0). Characteristic function of a crisp set (a)
    and fuzzy set (b). In process modeling and control, systems that are ill-defined
    and with uncertainties can be modeled with a fuzzy inference system employing
    fuzzy ‘If–Then’ rules to quantify human knowledge and reasoning processes without
    employing precise quantitative analyses. The fuzzy inference system should include
    the following functional blocks (Jang, 1993): • a fuzzification interface that
    transforms the crisp inputs into degrees of match with linguistic values; • a
    knowledge base that includes ∘ a rule base containing a number of fuzzy ‘If–Then’
    rules; ∘ a database that defines the membership functions of the fuzzy sets used
    in the fuzzy rules; • a decision-making unit that performs the inference operations
    on the rules; and • a defuzzification interface that transforms the fuzzy results
    of the inference into a crisp output. Although some preceding work has been indicated
    (Wilkinson, 1963), Dr. Lotfi Zadeh has been generally considered as the first
    person who introduced FL to the world. In 1965, Dr. Zadeh axiomatized fuzzy set
    theory (Zadeh, 1965). FL is an interface between logic and human reasoning. Humans
    have a remarkable capability to reason and make decisions in an environment of
    uncertainty, imprecision, incompleteness of information, and partiality of knowledge,
    truth and class membership. FL is for formalization/mechanization of this capability.
    FL mimics human control logic. It can be built into anything from small, hand-held
    products to large computerized process control systems. It uses an imprecise but
    very descriptive language to deal with input data as a human operator would. It
    is very robust and tolerant of operator and data input and often works when first
    implemented with little or no tuning. FL has been applied to diverse fields since
    the 1970s with the sufficient development of small computing capability. It has
    been applied in such varied fields as control systems and artificial intelligence.
    In 1974, the first successful application of fuzzy logic to the control of a laboratory-scale
    process was reported (Mamdani and Assilian, 1975). Control of cement kilns was
    an early industrial application (Holmblad and Ostergaard, 1982). Since the first
    consumer product using fuzzy logic was marketed in 1987, the use of fuzzy control
    has increased substantially. A number of CAD (Computer-Aid Design) environments
    for fuzzy control design have emerged together with VLSI (Very-Large-Scale Integration)
    hardware for fast execution. Fuzzy control is being applied to various systems
    in the process industry (Santhanam and Langari, 1994, Tani et al., 1994), consumer
    electronics (Hirota, 1993, Bonissone, 1994), automatic train operation (Yasunobu
    and Miyamoto, 1985), traffic systems in general (Hellendoorn, 1993), and in other
    fields (Hirota, 1993, Terano et al., 1994). Although FL was proposed by Professor
    Zadeh of University of California at Berkeley, FL has been gaining popularity
    only gradually in the United States. This may be due to disappointment with the
    unfulfilled promises of ‘artificial intelligence’ computing techniques in the
    1980s (Khoshnevis and Chignell, 1985). However, at the same time, FL products
    have been aggressively built in Europe and Japan (EET, 1991, Smith, 1993). Still,
    the United States EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) has investigated fuzzy
    control for energy-efficient motors (Cleland et al., 1992). NASA (National Aeronautics
    and Space Administration) has studied fuzzy control for automated space docking
    (Ortega and Giron-Sierra, 1995). Boeing, General Motors, Allen-Bradley, Chrysler,
    Eaton, Whirlpool, and Maytag have also worked on fuzzy logic for use in low-power
    refrigerators, automated dishwashers, improved automotive transmissions, and energy-efficient
    electric motors. Development of fuzzy systems has helped advance techniques for
    handling imprecision in soft computing. In 1992, the concept of soft computing
    was introduced (Zadeh, 1992). Dr. Zadeh envisioned soft computing as being concerned
    with modes of computing in which precision is traded for tractability, robustness
    and ease of implementation. Soft computing serves to highlight the emergence of
    computing methodologies in which the emphasis is on exploiting the tolerance for
    imprecision and uncertainty to achieve tractability, robustness, and low solution
    cost. 2.2. Artificial neural networks ANNs provide a way to emulate biological
    neurons to solve complex problems in the same manner as the human brain. For many
    years, especially since the middle of the last century, interest in studying the
    mechanism and structure of the brain has been increasing. This increasing research
    interest has led to the development of new computational models, connectionist
    systems or ANNs, based on the biological background for solving complex problems
    like pattern recognition and fast information processing and adaptation. In the
    early 1940s, McCulloch and Pitts (1943), pioneers in the field, studied the potential
    and capabilities of interconnecting several basic components based on the model
    of a neuron. Later on, others like Hebb (1949), were concerned with the adaptation
    laws involved in neural systems. Rosenblatt (1958) coined the name “Perceptron”
    and devised an architecture, which has subsequently received much attention. Minsky
    and Papert (1969) later introduced a rigorous analysis of the Perceptron, of which
    they proved many properties and pointed out limitations of several related models.
    In the 1970s, the work of Grossberg (1976) came to prominence. His work, based
    on biological and psychological evidence, proposed several novel architectures
    of nonlinear dynamic systems. In the 1980s, Hopfield (1982) applied a particular
    nonlinear dynamic structure to solve problems in optimization. All of them conducted
    pioneer studies on the theoretical aspect of ANNs. In 1986, the PDP (Parallel
    Distributed Processing) research group published a series of algorithms and results
    (Rumelhart and McClelland, 1986). This publication contains an article entitled
    “Learning Internal Representations by Error Propagation” (Rumelhart et al., 1986a).
    This article brought recognition to an ANN training algorithm named BackPropagation
    (BP), although it had already been described in Werbos (1974). This BP training
    algorithm implemented with the general delta rule (Rumelhart et al., 1986a, Rumelhart
    et al., 1986b) gave a strong impulse to subsequent research and resulted in the
    largest body of research and applications in ANNs although many other ANN architectures
    and training algorithms have been developed and applied simultaneously. The architecture,
    training/learning, and implementation of an ANN are a simplified version of the
    structure and activities of human brain. For problem solving, the human brain
    uses a web of interconnected processing units, neurons, to process information.
    Each of the neurons is autonomous, independent, and works asynchronously. The
    vast processing power inherent in biological neural structures has inspired the
    study of the structure itself as a model for organizing and designing man-made
    computing structures. Compared with conventional data processing methods, ANNs
    provide a model-free, adaptive, parallel-processing, and robust solution with
    fault and failure tolerance, learning, ability to handle imprecise and fuzzy information,
    and capability to generalize. An ANN is able to map process input and output without
    underlying assumption about the distribution of data. ANNs are powerful in data
    processing and analysis. In mathematics, ANNs are the models defining a function:
    f(x)| X → Y. Each ANN model defines a class of such functions. In ANNs, the function
    f(x) is defined by a combination of functions gi(x), which could be further defined
    by a combination of other functions ri(x), and so on. This recursive function
    definition in an ANN brings up a network structure for the interconnection of
    function units. The widely used function combination is the nonlinear weighted
    sum: , where Ac() is a predefined activation function, such as the hyperbolic
    tangent function (Werbos, 1974, Rumelhart et al., 1986a, Rumelhart et al., 1986b).
    Fig. 2 shows a two hidden-layer feedforward network between input x and output
    f. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. ANN network structure. The feedforward
    network with a single hidden layer that contains a finite number of hidden neurons
    accompanied with an arbitrary activation function was proven to be a universal
    approximator on a compact subset of real n-dimensional Euclidean space Rn (Hornik
    et al., 1989, Cybenko, 1989). This theory assures that ANNs can handle engineering
    problems, which are highly complex and nonlinear. ANNs provide a powerful method
    for practically accurate solutions of precisely or imprecisely formulated problems
    and for phenomena that are only understood through experimental data and field
    observations. ANNs have become the most popular soft computing methods for solving
    problems in engineering. 2.3. Genetic algorithms Evolutionary computing is an
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) technique to solve combinatorial optimization problems.
    It is implemented in iterative progress with the growth in a population selected
    in a guided random search using parallel processing to reach the desired point.
    This operation was inspired by biological mechanisms of evolution, which is similar
    to Darwin''s theory on evolution (Darwin, 1859). There are a number of people
    who laid the theoretical foundations of evolutional computing: Lawrence J. Fogel
    and John Henry Holland in the United States (Fogel et al., 1966, Holland, 1975),
    and Ingo Rechenberg and Hans-Paul Schwefel in Germany (Rechenberg, 1973, Schwefel,
    1981). Fogel is regarded as the father of evolutionary computing. Holland studied
    this method a little differently and named it a genetic algorithm. Then, one of
    Holland''s students, David Goldberg, solved a difficult problem involving the
    control of gas-pipeline transmission using the method of GA in his dissertation
    (Goldberg, 1989). Goldberg''s work greatly inspired subsequent research and applications
    of GA. GA is an optimization and heuristic search technique that uses techniques
    inspired by evolutionary biology such as inheritance, mutation, selection, and
    crossover (also called recombination). GA works simultaneously on a set (population)
    of potential solutions (individuals) to the problem. The algorithm starts with
    a set of solutions (representing chromosomes) called a sub-population. The fitness
    to which solutions meet some performance criterion is evaluated and used to select
    “surviving” individuals that will “reproduce” a new, better sub-population. Then,
    the individuals will conduct alterations similar to the natural genetic mutation
    and crossover. The selection scheme makes the process towards high performance
    solutions. A careful selection of genetic algorithm structure and parameters can
    ensure a good chance of reaching the globally optimal solution after a reasonable
    number of iterations. Fig. 3 shows a flowchart of operational processes of GAs.
    GAs are computationally simple yet powerful enough to provide a robust search
    for difficult combinational search problems in complex spaces, without being stuck
    in local extremes (Goldberg, 1989). Therefore, GAs are powerful alternative tools
    to traditional optimization methods. GAs have been successfully used in many fields,
    such as scheduling (Wall, 1996, Lim and Sim, 2005), function optimization (Houck
    et al., 1998), machine learning (Goldberg and Holland, 1988, Grefenstette, 1994,
    Shapiro, 1998) and have become an important method of soft computing. Download

    Probabilistic computing is a soft computing technique to perform probabilistic
    reasoning. The aim of probabilistic reasoning is to combine the capacity of probability
    theory to handle uncertainty to make inference with belief. Pearl (1988) made
    an important survey on this topic with an emphasis on Bayesian networks. Grunwald
    (1997) made a useful review also. Bayesian approaches have been studied and applied
    extensively (Eddy, 1982, Edwards, 1982, Gigerenzer and Hoffrage, 1995, Jaynes,
    1996, Lauritzen, 2003) by using Bayes''s theorem (Bayes, 1763) in the process
    of probabilistic computation. Classical inference models do not permit the introduction
    of prior knowledge into the calculations. However, the use of prior knowledge
    would sometimes be useful to the process evaluation. BI (Bayesian Inference) is
    a statistical inference incorporating prior knowledge and prior probability distributions.
    In the process of BI evidence or observations are used to update the probability
    that a hypothesis may be true. Conventionally, binary hypothesis testing is used
    to statistically decide which hypothesis is true between two hypotheses. Alternatively,
    a Bayesian decision rule, such as minimum Bayes risk, minimum probability of error,
    or maximum a posteriori probability (MAP), depends on the prior probability of
    each hypothesis (Duda et al., 2001). Bayesian inference is based on the Bayes’
    theorem (Bayes, 1763) that adjusts probabilities given new evidence: where is
    the specific hypothesis, P(H) is the prior probability of H, P(E|H) is the conditional
    probability of E when H happens to be true, and P(E) is the marginal probability
    of E (new evidence). The ratio represents the impact the evidence has on the belief
    in the hypothesis. When this ratio is large, a larger posterior probability of
    the hypothesis given the evidence will be produced by multiplying the prior probability
    of the hypothesis by this factor. When this ratio is small, a smaller posterior
    probability for H will be produced. In Bayesian inference, Bayes’ theorem is used
    to measure how much new evidence should alter belief in a hypothesis. Bayesian
    Networks have been accepted as tools for decision-making in complex situations
    within a variety of disciplines (Pearl, 1999, Charniak, 1991). Bayesian Networks
    are probabilistic graphical models. Each of the models characterizes a set of
    variables and their probabilistic independencies. The graphical, probabilistic
    models allow the structured representation of a cognitive process based on a link
    and node structure where the state of parent node predicts the state of the child
    node. Conditional probability tables are then used to relate the parent and child
    nodes using Bayesian statistical methods to predict their relationship. Dynamic
    Bayesian networks (Ghahramani, 1997) are the Bayesian networks that represent
    sequences of variables. These sequences are often values of time series or sequences
    of symbols (for example protein sequences). 2.5. Decision tree DT (Decision Tree)
    is a popular method of machine learning. It was developed in the1960s (Magee,
    1964) and comprises a tree-structured arrangement of a set of attributes to evaluate
    and predict the output. In the operation of a DT, the algorithm is recursively
    looking for the attribute with the highest information gain, which is determined
    to evaluate first. DTs can be used to identify the strategy most likely to reach
    a goal. They can also be used as a descriptive means for calculating conditional
    probabilities. In operations research, a DT is a decision (classification) model
    (Hillier and Lieberman, 2005). A DT can be used to visually and explicitly represent
    decisions for decision support. In data mining and machine learning, a DT is a
    predictive model (Teorey, 1999, Flamig, 2000, Witten and Frank, 2000). The DT
    describes data but not decisions for the resulting classification tree as an input
    for decision-making. With a graphical representation, a DT model maps from observations
    about an item to the conclusions about its target value. In the structure of the
    tree, leaves represent classifications and branches represent conjunctions of
    features that lead to those classifications. The machine learning technique for
    inducing a decision tree from data is called decision tree learning, or (colloquially)
    decision trees. Using DTs large amounts of data can be analyzed in a relatively
    short time for real-time applications (Abraham et al., 2007). 3. Applications
    of soft computing in agricultural and biological engineering With the theoretical
    developments of soft computing, a large variety of successful applications to
    many industrial systems have been created. During the last decade, interest of
    applying soft computing techniques to systems in agricultural and biological engineering
    has been growing greatly. As in other fields, soft computing plays an especially
    important role in providing techniques to integrate human-like vagueness and real-life
    uncertainty into conventional computing programs. Problems in soil and water,
    crop management and post harvesting, precision agriculture, food processing, food
    quality and safety, and agricultural vehicle and robotics have been solved through
    soft computing-based classification, modeling and prediction, and optimization
    and control. This paper reviews significant papers for each of these agriculture-related
    areas, organized by the soft computing technique utilized. 3.1. Fuzzy logic applications
    3.1.1. Overview In summary of 136 related papers and reports, FL has been applied
    in solving problems in crop management (17%), soil and water (16%), food quality
    and safety (14%), animal health and behavior (10%), agricultural vehicle control
    (8%), precision agriculture (7%), greenhouse control (7%), agricultural machinery
    (4%), food processing (4%), air quality and pollution (3%), agricultural facilities
    (2%), agricultural robotics (1%), chemical application (1%), and others (6%) such
    as natural resources management and agricultural product design. These applications
    have been created through FL mainly by control (28%), modeling and prediction
    (24%), classification (24%), fuzzy clustering (9%), rule-based inference (7%),
    multisensor data fusion (4%), optimization (1%) and others (3%) such as thresholding
    and pattern inference. 3.1.2. Crop management For crop pest management, Pydipati
    et al. (2005) used the color co-occurrence method for textural analysis to determine
    whether classification algorithms could be used to identify diseased and normal
    citrus leaves. One of the classification strategies investigated was ANN classifiers
    based on the RBF (Radial Basis Function) networks with fuzzy outputs that indicate
    a measure of strength. The level of fuzziness was determined by setting any value
    <0.5 as equivalent to 0, and any value >0.5 as equivalent to 1. This is a typical
    way of dealing with the output of classifier using FL, which helps decide the
    output class labeling with the output of decimal numbers. Yang et al., 2000a,
    Yang et al., 2003 reported on development of an image capture/processing system
    to detect weeds and a fuzzy logic decision-making system to determine where and
    how much herbicide to apply in an agricultural field. As information concerning
    economic thresholds of weed impact on crop productivity cannot easily be adapted
    to a given region or even to a given farm, a fuzzy logic approach was applied
    to convert image data into sprayer commands to allow farmers to use experience
    to classify weed status at a given location in the field. This research indicated
    that a fuzzy logic system is able to understand and facilitates the representation
    and processing of human knowledge in computer and the inputs, outputs, and rules
    of FL are easy to modify. 3.1.3. Irrigation and ET calculation For irrigation
    scheduling, Odhiambo et al. (2001a) examined FL for estimating daily reference
    evapotranspiration (ET) with fewer parameters compared with the standard FAO (Food
    and Agriculture Organization) Penman–Monteith method, which is sophisticated and
    requires several input parameters some of which have no actual measurements but
    are estimated from measured weather parameters. In this study, two fuzzy ET models
    were developed to estimate reference grass ET, using two and three weather parameters,
    respectively. The results illustrated that the fuzzy ET models could yield accurate
    estimation of ET. Al-Faraj et al. (2001) developed a rule-based FL crop water
    stress index (CWSI) using growth chamber data and tested this method on tall fescue
    canopies grown in a greenhouse. The upper and lower theoretical CWSI baselines
    may shift according to net radiation, wind, and stomatal resistance. This study
    proposed fuzzy logic to develop a FL-CWSI system to overcome the uncertainty of
    baseline. The FL-CWSI system has just three inputs: canopy-air temperature differential,
    vapor pressure deficit, and shortwave radiation, and one output: CWSI. To calculate
    the crop water stress index under different levels of solar radiation and vapor
    pressure deficit, 150 fuzzy rules were established to relate the system inputs
    and the output. The use of FL-CWSI eliminated the need to calculate or calibrate
    empirical or theoretical base line limits. The FL-CWSI was successfully tested
    using independent greenhouse data. Thomson and Ross developed a coupled sensor-
    and model-based irrigation scheduling method (Thomson et al., 1993, Thomson and
    Ross, 1996). Based on this work Thomson (1998) described a concept by which readings
    from sensors could be used to reparameterize or adjust inputs to a crop simulation
    model. Readings from sensors and the modeled results were used synergistically
    in an adaptive learning scheme. 3.1.4. Soil analysis Soil mapping using FL has
    been reported by Zhu et al. (2001), Bragato (2004), Shi et al. (2004), Qi et al.
    (2006), and Zhu et al. (in press). Lark (2000) illustrated how to design sampling
    grids from imprecise information on soil variability with an approach based on
    the fuzzy kriging variance. This approach can derive a fuzzy set of grid spacings
    that will achieve a target kriging variance when given a fuzzy formulation of
    the soil property variogram. This fuzzy set of grid spacings can then be defuzzified
    in a more or less conservative way to define a sampling scheme. In support of
    precision agriculture, Van Alphen and Stoorvogel (2000) developed a functional
    approach to soil characterization involved in water stress, nitrate-stress, nitrate-leaching
    and residual nitrogen-content at harvest for a precision agriculture decision
    support system. In the study, a fuzzy c-means classifier was used to group the
    soil profiles into functional classes. Ferguson et al. (2003) evaluated approaches
    for site-specific use of the nitrification inhibitor based on slope and surface
    texture for management zone definition. In this study, fuzzy cluster analysis
    was demonstrated the potential to define management zones for use of nitrification
    inhibitors from easily obtained spatial yield or soil ECa, rather than expensive
    grid sampling of soil chemical and physical properties. 3.1.5. Precision agriculture
    Ortiz et al. (2008) used fuzzy clustering of elevation and slope of the terrain
    to delineate root knot nematode (RKN) risk zones for a comparison test of two
    nematicide application rates on nematode population density and cotton lint yield.
    The results from this study clearly showed that RKN control and final yield varied
    with respect to the nematicide type and rate across risk management zones based
    on fuzzy clustering of terrain elevation and slope, normalized difference vegetation
    index (NDVI) of bare soil reflectance, and apparent soil electrical conductivity.
    Xiang and Tian (2007) used fuzzy inference in an ANN framework to develop an artificially
    intelligent controller that automatically adjusts multispectral camera parameters,
    such as “gain” and “exposure time” to compensate for changing natural lighting
    conditions and to acquire white-balanced images. The artificial intelligence control
    algorithm did require no mathematical model of the system, and provided better
    control performance compared to conventional control methods. Jones and Barnes
    (2000) described precision crop management as a multi-objective decision-making
    process that must incorporate a diversity of data, opinion, preference and objective.
    This paper developed fuzzy composite programming, a distance-based multi-objective
    optimization problem that uses fuzzy representation of uncertainty to combine
    remote sensing and crop models for decision support in precision crop management.
    This approach allows users to express individual or corporate values and preferences;
    highlights the degree of imprecision associated with each information source used
    (i.e. model accuracy, uncertainty in costs and returns, etc.); highlights the
    degree of imprecision associated with each alternative; facilitates structuring
    of the decision process; reduces several levels of complex information into a
    single chart; allows examination of trade-off between alternatives and interests;
    and forces examination of inter-relationships between interests. Ambuel et al.
    (1994) successfully developed and used a fuzzy logic yield simulator. Two expert
    system models were developed using FL rules. In one model chemical and physical
    characteristics of the soil were measured and combined with local meteorological
    data as input parameters. In the other model soil properties were estimated rather
    than measured. Model predicted yields were then compared with measured yields
    for those fields. The results indicate that on a relative basis, predicted yields
    generally agreed with measured yields. 3.1.6. Chemical application Gil et al.
    (2008) used linear multiple regression and FL inference models to evaluate the
    effects of micrometeorological conditions on pesticide application for two spray
    qualities (fine and very fine). Spray losses were predicted using fuzzy inference
    systems. Interpretable rules were established for the characterization of micrometeorological
    parameters using the two sprays. Q. Chen et al. (2006) and Y. Chen et al. (2006)
    developed an intelligent pesticide spray system based on fuzzy control and machine
    vision to perform site-specific pesticide application. Cho and Ki (1999) developed
    a FL controller for autonomous operation of a speed sprayer in an orchard. The
    operation of the controller was graphically simulated under the real condition
    of the orchard. Machine vision was also used to determine vehicle heading and
    four ultrasonic sensors were used to detect obstacles during the operation. 3.2.
    Artificial neural network applications 3.2.1. Overview ANNs have the largest body
    of applications in agricultural and biological engineering when compared with
    other soft computing techniques. In summary of related 348 papers and reports,
    ANNs have been applied in solving problems in food quality and safety (35.34%),
    crop (22.7%), soil and water (14.37%), precision agriculture (6.61%), animal management
    (5.17%), post harvest (2.59%), food processing (2.3%), greenhouse control (2.01%),
    agricultural vehicle control (1.15%), agricultural machinery (1.15%), agricultural
    pollution (1.15%), agricultural biology (1.15%), ecology and natural resources
    (1.44%), agricultural robotics (0.29%), chemical application (0.29%), and others
    (2.3%) such as bioenergy and agricultural facilities. These ANN applications have
    been created mainly through classification (45.11%), modeling and prediction (43.97%),
    control (4.02%), and simulation (2.59%), parameter estimation (2.01%), detection
    (1.15%), data clustering (0.57%), optimization (0.29%) and data fusion (0.29%)
    as well. Similar to applications in general engineering fields, most works in
    agricultural and biological engineering have been accomplished using a multilayer
    feedforward ANN trained by the famous BP algorithm, which was inspired by the
    work of Rumelhart et al., 1986a, Rumelhart et al., 1986b. Among 348 collected
    papers and reports 210 were based on multilayer feedforward neural networks trained
    by the BP algorithm and 83 did not explicitly state ANNs’ structure and training
    algorithm. Of the remainder twelve were based on PNN (Probabilistic Neural Network);
    eleven were based on MLP (Multi Layer Perceptron) using different training algorithms
    such as Levenberg–Marquardt optimization procedure, Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno
    (BFGS) optimization procedure, and GA; seven were based on Kohonen SOM (Self Organizing
    Map), which is a popular unsupervised training algorithm; six were based upon
    other unsupervised training algorithms such as fuzzy ART (Carpenter et al., 1991),
    ART2 (Carpenter and Grossberg, 1987), and Auto-Associative network (Anderson et
    al., 1977); four were based on RBF, which is a neural network good for function
    approximation; three were based on LVQ (Learning Vector Quantization); two were
    based on GRNN (Generalized Regression Neural Network). Finally ten were based
    on other network structures such as Counter-Propagation (CP), and Adaptive Logic
    Network (ALN). 3.2.2. Crop management In a crop field study, Meyer et al. (2004)
    conducted a digital camera operation study for classifying uniform images of grass,
    bare soil, corn stalks residue, and wheat straw residue using a barium sulfate
    reference panel based on color. The classifications were conducted with a combination
    of least-squares estimation and BP training to generate a fuzzy inference system.
    Fuzzy input variables included RGB or HSI average values alone, with and without
    monochromatic light sources, and with and without luminance and background light
    source color temperature measurements for each fuzzy inference model. The ANN
    system provided a tool for evaluating digital camera operating performance by
    setting up a simple class, supervised learning system for plant, soil residue
    color images. In order to develop a multi-spectral optical system for remote sensing
    of nitrogen content of crops, Chen et al. (2007) determined significant wavelengths
    in image data for estimating nitrogen content of cabbage seedling leaves by stepwise
    multi-linear regression analysis. A feedforward ANN model with cross-learning
    scheme was further developed to increase prediction accuracy. The results indicated
    that the ANN model with cross-learning using spectral information at 490, 570,
    600, and 680 nm could be used to develop a practical remote sensing system to
    predict nitrogen content of cabbage seedlings. Sui and Thomasson (2006) developed
    a BP trained feedforward ANN to predict nitrogen status in cotton plants based
    on data from a ground-based sensing system. The system consists of a multi-spectral
    optical sensor for plant canopy sensing, an ultrasonic sensor for plant height
    measurement, and a data-acquisition and processing unit. Field tests of the system
    over 2 years involved measuring spectral reflectance and plant height simultaneously
    in real time in situ. Results showed that the neural networks were able to predict
    nitrogen status of the cotton plants at 90% accuracy with two categories: deficiency
    and non-deficiency. Karimi et al. (2005) evaluated discriminant analysis as a
    tool for classifying images with respect to the nitrogen and weed management practices
    applied to the experimental plots, and compared the classification accuracy of
    this technique with those obtained by ANN and DT algorithms on the same data.
    For identifying weed and nitrogen stresses in corn, the discriminant analysis
    was found to provide the best classification accuracy at the early growth stage,
    whereas better accuracy was obtained with ANN models at the tasseling and full
    maturity stages. Tumbo et al. (2002b) used an on-the-go system for sensing chlorophyll
    status in corn using BP trained feedforward ANNs and fiber-optic spectrometry
    to acquire spectral response pattern data in corn fields. The neural network model
    incorporated into the mobile system was trained using statically collected plant-center
    spectral data and chlorophyll readings acquired by SPAD 502 chlorophyll meter
    on the some day and in the same field plots. The neural network model showed good
    correlation between predicted and actual chlorophyll readings of the calibration
    data set. Goel et al. (2001) compared the DT method and ANN method to classify
    nitrogen stress within a corn field based on hyperspectral images. Goel et al.
    (2003) also evaluated the DT and ANN classification algorithms for the classification
    of hyperspectral data to discriminate between different growth scenarios in a
    corn field to identify weed stress and nitrogen status of corn. In both studies,
    the ANNs obtained slightly better results than the DTs. Tang et al. (2003) developed
    a texture-based weed classification method consisting of a low-level Gabor wavelets-based
    feature extraction algorithm and a high-level ANN-based pattern recognition algorithm.
    In this research, three species of broadleaf weeds (common cocklebur, velvetleaf,
    and ivyleaf morning glory) and two graces, giant foxtail and crabgrass, which
    are common in Illinois, were studied. After processing 40 sample images with 20
    samples from each class, the results showed that the method was capable of classifying
    all the samples correctly with high computational efficiency, demonstrating its
    potential for practical implementation under real-time constraints. Cho et al.
    (2002) used an ANN using a regularization method to overcome overfitting with
    better generalization for distinguishing radish from weeds effectively. In this
    study, a machine vision system using a charge coupled device camera for the weed
    detection in a radish farm was developed. Shape features were analyzed with the
    binary images obtained from color images of radish and weeds. Using the discriminant
    analysis, the successful recognition rate was 92% for radish and 98% for weeds.
    To recognize radish and weeds more effectively, an ANN was used. The ANN model
    distinguished the radish from the weeds with 100%. Yang et al. (2002) developed
    a weed recognition imaging system based on LVQ networks to assist in the precision
    application of herbicides in corn fields. Digital images were collected and the
    intensities of the colors were compared for each pixel of the images. The pixel
    intensities of the images were used as the inputs for LVQ ANNs. The ANNs were
    trained to distinguish corn from weeds, as well as to differentiate between weed
    species. The success rate for a single ANN in distinguishing a given weed species
    from corn was as high as 90%, and as high as 80% in distinguishing any of four
    weed species from corn. Moshou et al. (2002) used the SOM ANN in a supervised
    way for a classification task for a weed species spectral detector. The neurons
    of the SOM become associated with local linear mappings. Error information obtained
    during training was used in a novel learning algorithm to train the classifier.
    The proposed method achieved fast convergence and good generalization. Bajwa and
    Tian (2001) developed weed density models using a feedforward, BP trained MLP
    network to map the spatial distribution of weed density based on aerial digital
    color infrared remote sensing over a soybean field. In this study, the ANN weed
    density models resulted in R2 values of 0.83–0.83. This model mapped the spatial
    distribution of weed density with a R2 value of 0.58 for a field not used in modeling
    for model validation. It is quite difficult to use machine vision to distinguish
    weeds from the main crop in real time, due to the substantial computational resources
    and the complicated algorithms required. Yang et al. (2000b) developed ANNs to
    overcome some of these difficulties by interpreting images quickly and effectively
    to distinguish young corn plants from weeds. The ANNs were one-hidden-layer feedforward
    networks trained with the BP algorithm. In the study, a total of 80 images of
    corn plants and weeds were used for training purposes. For some ANNs, the success
    rate for classifying corn plants was as high as 100%, whereas the highest success
    rate for weed recognition was 80%. Burks et al. (2000) used the color co-occurrence
    texture statistics as input variables for a BP trained ANN weed classification
    model. The study evaluated classification accuracy as a function of network topology
    and training parameter selection. In addition, training cycle requirements and
    training repeatability were studied. El-Faki et al. (2000) developed and tested
    ANN-based weed detection algorithms capable of detecting the leading weed species
    competing with wheat and soybean crops. This study compared statistical discriminant
    analysis and two ANN classifiers. These classifiers were trained and tested using
    three weed species (Johnsongrass, redroot pigweed, and yellow foxtail) with soybean
    and three weed species (wild buckwheat, cheat, and field bindweed) with wheat.
    The results showed that the statistical discriminant analysis classifier was more
    accurate than the ANN classifiers in classification accuracy. Suzuki et al. (2009)
    developed a discriminant model for automated weed control using imagery from a
    line scan hyperspectral imaging sensor. Prior to developing discriminators, explanatory
    variables for the models were generated from spectral bands using two methods:
    stepwise selection method (RAW) using the multivariate test statistic Wilks’ Lambda
    and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and
    a neural network (NN) models were employed for development of the discriminator,
    resulting in four discriminant models to test: RAW-LDA, RAW-NN, PCA-LDA, and PCA-NN.
    Accuracies of the NN models were superior to the LDA, but success rates for all
    discriminant models were greater than 85%. RAW method was superior to PCA for
    processing speed because PCA selected variables calculated from all wavebands.
    In a study of crop leaf area indices, Koller and Upadhyaya (2005a) developed an
    ANN model that utilized the leaf area index (LAI) values derived from aerial images
    to train and predict LAI changes on a daily basis. Based on this ANN model, Koller
    and Upadhyaya (2005b) predicted the processing tomato yield based on soil, crop,
    and environmental parameters. Koller and Upadhyaya (2005c) further developed a
    BP trained feedforward ANN model to predict daily LAI values based on six sets
    of modified NDVI values derived from biweekly aerial images obtained during the
    tomato growing season. The trained network was able to predict LAI values with
    R2 values of 0.96 or higher. The cumulative LAI predicted by the ANN model correlated
    well with the measured values (R2 = 0.83). Walthall et al. (2004) compared empirical
    and ANN approaches for estimating corn and soybean LAI from Landsat ETM+ imagery.
    In this study, an evaluation of LAI retrieval methods was conducted using (1)
    empirical methods employing NDVI and a new soil adjusted index that uses green
    wavelength reflectance, (2) a scaled NDVI approach that uses no calibration measurements,
    and (3) a hybrid approach that uses an ANN and a radiative transfer model without
    site-specific calibration measurements. Compared to other methods, the ANN-based
    approach is computationally complex as multiple analytical steps must be completed
    before an estimate can be produced. In the study of crop disease, Pydipati et
    al. (2005) used the color co-occurrence method for textural analysis to determine
    whether classification algorithms could be used to identify diseased and normal
    citrus leaves based on a Mahalanobis minimum distance classifier as well as ANN
    classifiers based on the BP algorithm for two-hidden-layer feedforward networks
    and RBF networks with fuzzy outputs giving a measure of strength. The results
    indicated that that the Mahalanobis classifier and the BP trained ANN classifier
    performed equally well when using hue and saturation texture features selected
    through a stepwise variable reduction method. In a study of crop growth, Hsieh
    et al. (2001) adopted a dual-hidden-layer feedforward ANN trained with the error
    BP algorithm to analyze experimental data and develop strategies for a dynamic
    growth model to simulate the relationship between environmental factors (temperature,
    water supply and daily radiation) and cabbage seedling quality. Hsieh et al. (2003)
    continued to work on the model development of a BP trained, multilayer feedforward
    ANN model to investigate the relationship between the quality of cabbage seedlings
    and their growth environment. This study developed and evaluated three different
    ANN models. By integration of schemes for various growth stages and the historical
    growth factor, the model contributes markedly in prediction ability. The error
    is decreased by 77% when the best model developed in this work was used. Tumbo
    et al. (2002a) trained a single-hidden-layer feedforward ANN using the BP algorithm
    using spectral channels of the hyperspectral reflectance response patterns from
    corn plant as inputs for predicting chlorophyll values as the output. The BP trained
    ANN model was developed using spectral channels of the spectral reflectance response
    patterns as inputs and chlorophyll readings as an output. The model showed strong
    correlation between predicted and actual chlorophyll meter readings from the same
    corn variety and soil type as the training set. Moshou et al. (2001) used the
    SOM ANN in a supervised way for classification of agricultural plants. The classification
    method was applied in a precision farming application for classification of crops
    and weeds using spectral properties. The classification performance of the proposed
    method was proven to be superior compared with other statistical and neural classifiers,
    such as an optimal Bayesian classifier in the form of a probabilistic neural network.
    3.2.3. Irrigation and ET calculation Elgaali et al. (2006) developed a one-hidden-layer
    feedforward ANN model and a consumptive use model for the region of Colorado''s
    Arkansas River basin to investigate the possible effects of regional climatic
    changes on irrigation water supply and demand. The two models were applied to
    the region to estimate the effects of climate change on irrigation water balance.
    For selection of the best compromise irrigation planning strategy in the case
    study of Jayakwadi irrigation project, Maharashtra, India, Raju et al. (2006),
    based multiobjective linear programming optimization, employed Kohonen neural
    networks to sort nondominated irrigation planning strategies into smaller groups.
    The results indicated that the integrated model methodology was effective for
    modeling multiobjective irrigation planning problems. In ET calculation, Bruton
    et al. (2000) developed feedforward ANN models trained with the BP algorithm to
    estimate daily pan evaporation using measured weather variables as inputs from
    weather data of Rome, Plains, and Watkinsville, Georgia, USA. In this study, daily
    pan evaporation was also estimated using multiple linear regression and the Priestley–Taylor
    method and was compared to the results of the ANN models. The ANN model of daily
    pan evaporation with all available variables as inputs was the most accurate model.
    In overall, pan evaporation estimated with ANN models was slightly more accurate
    than pan evaporation estimated with a multiple linear regression model or the
    Priestley–Taylor equation. Odhiambo et al. (2001b) developed a feedforward ANN
    on a conceptual and structural basis in a study on elimination of trial-and-error
    in determining the shape of the membership functions in the fuzzy control rules
    for estimating daily reference ET. The results of the study showed that the optimized
    fuzzy–neural model is reasonably accurate, and is comparable to the FAO Penman–Monteith
    equation. This approach can provide an easy and efficient means of tuning fuzzy
    ET models. 3.2.4. Soil analysis In the study of soil profiles, Odhiambo et al.
    (2004) presented an application of a fuzzy–neural network classifier for unsupervised
    clustering and classification of soil profiles using ground-penetrating radar
    imagery. Freeland and Odhiambo (2007) used a two-layer perceptron neural network
    that performs supervised classification to examine the feasibility of using textural
    features extracted from ground-penetrating radar for non-intrusively mapping subsurface
    soil conditions. The ANN classifier was used to assign data to the known subsurface
    categories. The results of subsurface characterization using extracted textural
    features were found to be in close agreement with results obtained by careful
    visual interpretation of the data. This approach of ground-penetrating radar imagery
    classification was to be considered as an alternative method to traditional human
    interpretation only in the classification of voluminous data sets, wherein the
    extensive time requirement would make the traditional human interpretation impractical.
    Bajwa et al. (2004) used a multilayer feedforward ANN trained with GA to optimize
    the ANN topology and other four unsupervised and supervised methods to identify
    aerial hyperspectral image bands to characterize soil electrical conductivity
    and canopy coverage in agricultural fields. Band selection was performed with
    both unsupervised and supervised approaches. Five methods (three unsupervised
    and two supervised) are proposed and compared to identify hyperspectral image
    bands to characterize soil electrical conductivity and canopy coverage in agricultural
    fields. Each hyperspectral image band was ranked using all five methods and ANN
    measure was the most useful in selecting bands specific to a target characteristic
    with minimum information redundancy. Ferentinos and Albright (2002) presented
    a feedforward ANN model that was trained with the quasi-Newton BP algorithm and
    predicts pH and electrical conductivity changes in the root zone of lettuce grown
    in a deep-trough hydroponic system. The most suitable and accurate combination
    of network architecture and training method was one hidden layer with nine hidden
    nodes, trained with the quasi-Newton backpropagation algorithm. The model proved
    capable of predicting pH at the next 20-min time step within 0.01 pH units and
    electrical conductivity within 5 μS cm−1. Simpler prediction methods, such as
    linear extrapolation and the lazy man prediction (in which prediction is the value
    of the previous time step), gave comparable accuracy much of the time. However,
    they performed poorly in situations where the control actions of the system had
    been activated and produced relatively rapid changes in the predicted parameters.
    In those cases, the neural network model did not encounter any difficulties predicting
    the rapid changes. Additionally, Fidêncio et al. (2001) applied CP ANN and RBF
    ANN in classification of soils using near-infrared spectroscopy. Ingleby and Crowe
    (2001) developed feedforward ANN models with a reduced-memory Levenberg–Marquardt
    BP training algorithm for predicting organic matter content in Saskatchewan soils.
    Altendorf et al. (1999) developed a set of feedforward ANNs with BP training to
    predict soil water content at a given depth as a function of soil temperature.
    In the study of soil properties, Zhang and Kushwaha (1999) applied ANNs to simulate
    the interaction between soil and tool for tillage and soil behavior. Schaap et
    al. (1998) calibrated hierarchical ANN models for prediction of water retention
    parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity from basic soil properties. In
    the studies of soil temperature, Yang et al. (1997a) developed a model based on
    a feedforward ANN training with the BP algorithm to simulate daily soil temperatures
    at 100, 500 and 1500 mm depths of soil from Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Yang et al.
    (2004b) compared a multivariate adaptive regression splines model with feedforward
    ANNs in simulation of soil temperature at different depths. The correlation coefficients
    of linear regression from both multivariate adaptive regression splines and ANNs
    were always higher than 0.950. The results demonstrate the potential of multivariate
    adaptive regression splines to be used as a regression technology in agricultural
    applications. A number of papers developing and using ANNs have been published
    for soil property studies in Geoderma and SSSAJ in recent years. Anagu et al.
    (2009) developed sorption models as a function of basic soil properties using
    ANNs for estimation heavy metal sorption in German soils. The results of the study
    indicated that the ANN models performed better than on multiple linear regression
    MLR in all cases for 9 heavy metals using 13 soil properties as well as solution
    phase concentrations as inputs and sorbed phase concentrations as output. Khalilmoghadam
    et al. (2009) used ANNs in estimating soil shear strength from measured particle
    size distribution, topographic attributes, NDVI, soil organic carbon (SOC), and
    CaCO3. Three neural networks structures: multilayer perceptron (MLP), generalized
    feedforward, and modular feedforward networks were used and compared with conventional
    multiple-linear regression analysis. In the comparison the improvements were identified
    with all three neural network models over a conventional MLR models. Cockx et
    al. (2009) evaluated ANNs for extraction of topsoil textural information from
    the depth-weighted EM38DD (an electromagnetic induction soil sensor) signals to
    predict the topsoil clay content. Earlier Merdun et al. (2006) compared ANN and
    regression pedotransfer functions for prediction of soil water retention and saturated
    hydraulic conductivity and demonstrated that ANN produced promising results. 3.2.5.
    Precision agriculture Xiang and Tian (2007) developed a BP trained one-hidden-layer
    feedforward ANN in an artificially intelligent controller for gain and exposure
    time automation of a multispectral camera to compensate for changing natural lighting
    conditions and to acquire white-balanced images. This study was undertaken to
    develop an artificially intelligent controller based on an ANN with an adaptive
    neuro-fuzzy inference system. It was shown through experiments that the developed
    algorithm was able to complete multispectral camera parameter control within three
    iterations for each channel. The convergence speed was faster than with conventional
    control methods. Irmak et al. (2006) developed a BP ANN model to predict the spatial
    distribution of soybean yields and to understand the causes of yield variability.
    First, a BP trained ANN model was developed by relating soybean yield to topography,
    soil, weather, and site factors and the model predictions were evaluated for the
    same field for independent years. Then, the potential use of the ANN model was
    also explored for predicting yields in independent fields. Finally, the ability
    of the ANN to attribute yield losses due to soybean cyst nematodes (SCN), soil
    pH, and weeds was evaluated. The results showed that the ANN model could predict
    spatial yield variability well. Miao et al. (2006) employed ANN analysis to evaluate
    the relative importance of selected soil, landscape and seed hybrid factors on
    corn yield and grain quality in two Illinois, USA fields. The results indicated
    that the response curves generated by the ANN models were more informative than
    simple correlation coefficients or coefficients in multiple regression equations.
    Uno et al. (2005) developed yield prediction models using statistical and ANN
    approaches along with various vegetation indices. The models were used to predict
    corn yield from compact airborne spectrographic imager data. The study showed
    that although no clear difference was observed between ANNs and stepwise multiple
    linear regression models, the high potential usefulness of ANNs was confirmed.
    Drummond et al. (2003) investigated supervised feedforward ANNs along with stepwise
    multiple linear regression and projection pursuit regression to identify methods
    able to relate soil properties and grain yields on a point-by-point basis within
    ten individual site-years. In the study, the ANNs consistently outperformed stepwise
    multiple linear regression and projection pursuit regression and provided minimal
    prediction errors in every site-year. However, in site-years with relatively fewer
    observations and in site-years where a single, overriding factor was not apparent,
    the improvements achieved by neural networks over stepwise multiple linear regression
    and projection pursuit regression were small. Liu et al. (2001) designed a fully
    connected, BP trained feedforward ANN to approximate the nonlinear yield function
    relating corn yield to factors influencing yield. Factors affecting crop yields,
    such as soil, weather, and management, were so complex that traditional statistics
    couldnot give accurate results. As an automatic learning tool, the ANN is an attractive
    alternative for processing the massive data set generated by precision farming
    production and research. In this study, a feedforward, completely connected, back-propagation
    ANN was designed to approximate the nonlinear yield function relating corn yield
    to factors influencing yield. 3.2.6. Chemical application Krishnaswamy and Krishnan
    (2002) predicted the nozzle wear rates for four fan nozzles using regression and
    ANN techniques. A comparison of the regression model and ANN model showed that
    the regression and the neural network models performed equally well for the predictions.
    Yang et al. (1997b) used feedforward ANNs for simulation of pesticide concentrations
    in agricultural soils. An ANN model can be executed in real-time, while the sprayer
    is working in the field, in order to adjust application rates to the real extent
    of the problem. In this study, an ANN model was built and trained with inputs
    of: accumulated daily rainfall, soil temperature, potential ET, as well as tillage
    practices and the number of days elapsed after pesticide application. 3.3. Genetic
    algorithm applications 3.3.1. Overview Based on a summary of 83 papers and reports,
    GAs have been applied in solving problems in crop management (31%), water management
    (27%), food quality and safety (11%), food processing (6%), precision agriculture
    (4%), agricultural biology (4%), agricultural machinery (2%), agricultural facilities
    (2%), animal behavior (2%), and others (11%) such as agricultural vehicle, robotics,
    and pollution. GAs are basically an optimization and search method. The applications
    for optimization take the largest portion of the total, 66%. GAs have been also
    used to assist with modeling and prediction (18%), classification (12%), control
    (2%), data clustering (1%) and value thresholding (1%). 3.3.2. Crop management
    Thorp et al. (2004) used the GA-based image segmentation algorithm (Tang et al.,
    2000) to generate measurements of percent vegetation cover from the hyperspectral
    images collected over a soybean field. Fang et al. (2003) estimated crop leaf
    area index by integrating a canopy radiative transfer model and the GA optimization
    technique. This method was used to retrieve leaf area index from field measured
    reflectance as well as from atmospherically corrected Landsat ETM+ data. Yao and
    Tian (2003) proposed and tested a GA-based selective principal component analysis
    method using hyperspectral remote sensing data and ground reference data collected
    within a corn field for chlorophyll content, plant population, and various hybrids.
    The GA-based method was used to select a subset of the original image bands, which
    could reduce the data dimension. A principal component transform was subsequently
    applied to the selected bands. Then, image processing on the reduced feature space
    could be performed with improved accuracy. Tang et al. (2000) developed a machine
    vision-based weed detection technology under outdoor natural lighting conditions.
    In image processing, a GA-based, supervised color image segmentation method in
    the hue-saturation-intensity color space was used to separate plants (crop and
    weeds) from the background (soil, rocks, and residue) for this real-time, machine-vision-based,
    in-field variability mapping and selective herbicide application system. Pabico
    et al. (1999) presented a conceptual framework for using a GA to determine cultivar
    coefficients of crop simulation models. In a study of weed distribution in crop
    fields, Diaz et al. (2005) presented a method for inducing a model that appropriately
    predicts the heterogeneous distribution of wild-oat in terms of some environmental
    variables. From several experiments, distinct rule sets have been found by applying
    a GA to carry out the automatic learning process. The rule set extracted was able
    to explain about most of weed variability. Noguchi et al. (1998) developed an
    intelligent vision system for autonomous vehicle field operations. Fuzzy logic
    was used to classify the crops and weeds. A GA was used to optimize and tune the
    fuzzy logic membership rules. 3.3.3. Irrigation Raju and Kumar (2004) presented
    an application of GA for irrigation planning. The GA technique was used to evolve
    efficient cropping patterns to maximize benefits for an irrigation project in
    India. Kumar et al. (2006) presented a GA model for obtaining an optimal operating
    policy and optimal crop water allocations from an irrigation reservoir. The model
    was applied to the Malaprabha single-purpose irrigation reservoir in Karnataka
    State, India. The optimal operating policy obtained using the GAs is similar to
    that obtained by linear programming. Wardlaw and Bhaktikul (2004) described the
    development of a GA to solve an irrigation water scheduling problem. The implementation
    of the GA was to optimize the utilization of water resources in irrigation systems
    operating on a rotational basis along with constraints that relate to field soil
    moisture balances as well as canal capacities. Cai et al. (2001) described strategies
    for solving large nonlinear water resources models management with a combination
    of GAs with linear programming. Kuo et al. (2000) presented a model based on on-farm
    irrigation scheduling and a simple GA optimization method for decision support
    in irrigation project planning. The proposed model was applied to an irrigation
    project located in Delta, Utah for optimizing economic profits, simulating the
    water demand, crop yields, and estimating the related crop area percentages with
    specified water supply and planted area constraints. Simulation results demonstrated
    that the most appropriate parameters of GAs for this study were: number of generations,
    population sizes, probability of crossover, and probability of mutation. 3.3.4.
    Soil analysis Pachepsky and Acock (1998) developed stochastic imaging of the available
    soil water capacity (AWC) and a soybean crop model GLYCIM to simulate variability
    and uncertainty in crop yield estimates as related to soil sampling density and
    weather patterns using GAs. Parasuraman et al. (2007) estimated saturated hydraulic
    conductivity using genetic programming (GP), tree-like representations of Gas
    solution domain. In the study the performance of the GP models were compared with
    the ANN models and GP appeared to be a promising tool for estimating the saturated
    hydraulic conductivity. 3.3.5. Precision agriculture Liu et al. (2001) optimized
    fifteen input factors with a GA to determine maximum yield after the ANN was trained.
    The ANN approximated the nonlinear yield function relating corn yield to factors
    influencing yield, was trained. 3.3.6. Chemical application Potter et al. (2000)
    used GA to optimize nozzle type or release height using a desired deposition as
    model input with a model constrain on other factors such as aircraft type and
    spray system for aerial pesticide application optimization. 3.4. Bayesian inference
    applications 3.4.1. Overview Based on a study of 46 papers and reports, BI has
    been applied in solving problems in crop management (28%), food quality and safety
    (28%), water management (17%), food processing (7%), precision agriculture (7%),
    and others (13%) such as bioenergy and animal health. BI is basically a classifier
    for pattern recognition. The applications for classification total 50%. BI also
    has been used to help modeling and prediction (35%), parameter estimation (11%),
    and optimization and control (4%). 3.4.2. Crop management In weed detection, Mathanker
    et al. (2007) used a Bayesian classifier for classifications using shape, color,
    spectral image features. The classifier conducted three classifications using
    only shape features, only green color and spectral energy features, and all features
    combined. The classification accuracy using these features at different resolutions
    for weed detection varied from 80% to 87%. The performance was unaffected by image
    resolution and shows potential for field applications. For outdoor field plant
    detection, Tian and Slaughter (1998) developed an environmentally adaptive segmentation
    algorithm. The results of the environmentally adaptive segmentation algorithm
    were used to create a Bayesian classifier as decision surface. Marchant and Onyango
    (2003) compared a Bayesian classifier with a multilayer feedforward ANN for plant/weed/soil
    discrimination in color images with a preference of Bayesian classifier over ANN
    in this case. 3.4.3. Irrigation and ET calculation Clemmens and Keats (1992) applied
    BI to the real-time feedback control of a basin irrigation system. Bayesian inference
    is applied to the real-time feedback control of a basin irrigation system. Estimates
    of the Kostiakov k (infiltration parameter) and Manning n (Roughness parameter)
    were obtained during water advance so that the optimum cutoff time can be determined
    from: (1) estimates from observation of advance time and distance and solution
    of the zero-inertia border irrigation model; and (2) either historical estimates
    of parameters or subjective estimates made by the irrigator. The study showed
    that the BI has some potential for improving real-time control of surface irrigation
    systems. Sayde et al. (2008) proposed an analytical method to reduce uncertainty
    in determination of soil water depletion by incorporating estimates of the uncertainties
    of ET and measured soil moisture into the analysis. Using a Bayesian analysis
    the probability distributions of the two estimators were incorporated into a posteriori
    probability distribution of depletion that provides a better basis for irrigation
    decisions. 3.4.4. Precision agriculture Chinchuluun et al. (2007) developed a
    robust Bayesian classifier with normal distribution for color segmentation in
    a citrus yield mapping system on a canopy shake and catch harvester. The Bayesian
    classifier worked relatively well on the non-uniform images. 3.4.5. Chemical application
    Lee and Slaughter (1999) used Bayesian classifiers in development of a real-time
    intelligent robotic weed control system for selective herbicide application to
    in-row weeds using machine vision and precision chemical application. 3.5. Decision
    tree applications 3.5.1. Overview A summary of 31 papers and reports on DT applications
    indicates that DT have been applied in solving problems in crop management (26%),
    agricultural safety (16%), animal production and management (13%), food safety
    (13%), water (13%), agricultural pollution (6%), and others (13%) such as precision
    agriculture and biological control. DT also is a classifier. The applications
    for classification account for 52% of the total. DT has been also used to conduct
    alternative induction (23%), rule representation (13%), pattern induction (6%),
    and others (6%) such as function approximation and control. 3.5.2. Crop management
    Karimi et al. (2005) compared discriminant analysis, ANN and DT for classifying
    images with respect to the nitrogen and weed management practices applied to the
    experimental plots. For identifying weed and nitrogen stresses in corn, DT could
    not compete with the discriminant analysis and ANN for better results. Yang et
    al. (2004a) used DTs to classify multispectral images of experimental plots having
    different crop and weed populations. DTs are directly suited to classification
    since data representing a given individual are sorted through the decision tree
    structure to fall directly into a pre-defined category. In this study, an aircraft-mounted
    pushbroom imaging spectrometer was used to obtain scans of the plots in one blue,
    five green, five red, and thirteen infrared bands. Three types of input were:
    absolute values of radiance from the 24 wavebands, vegetation index (VI), which
    consists of 12 inputs, and NDVI which consists of 65 inputs. Results showed that
    the most complex classification problem (distinguishing between 11 crop/weed combinations)
    was best resolved using the NDVI inputs. Goel et al. (2001) used a DT method to
    classify nitrogen stress within a corn field based on hyperspectral images. Goel
    et al. (2003) compared the DT and ANN classification algorithms for the classification
    of hyperspectral data to discriminate between different growth scenarios in a
    corn field to identify weed stress and nitrogen status of corn. DT technology
    was applied to classify different treatments based on the hyperspectral data.
    Various tree-growing mechanisms were used to improve the accuracy of classification.
    Misclassification rates of detecting all the combinations of different nitrogen
    and weed categories were 43, 32, and 40% for hyperspectral data sets obtained
    at the initial growth, the tasseling and the full maturity stages, respectively.
    However, satisfactory classification results were obtained when one factor (nitrogen
    or weed) was considered at a time. In this case, misclassification rates were
    only 22 and 18% for nitrogen and weeds, respectively, for the data obtained at
    the tasseling stage. 3.5.3. Precision agriculture Cohen et al. (2006) used the
    DT method for developing a spatial decision support system (SDSS) for Medfly (the
    Mediterranean fruit fly) control on fruit crops in Israel. This study established
    the main steps to assist the coordinators in the decision-making procedure in
    the development of the SDSS. The output is a map that classifies the citrus plots
    into one of the following blocks: spraying; spraying is recommended; spraying
    is not recommended; no-spraying; no data. Yang et al. (2001) used the DT algorithm
    to distinguish between manure and chemical fertilizer treatments for airborne
    hyperspectral imagery classification of agricultural fields. The success of the
    classification rate was as high as 91% for the early planting season, 99% for
    the mid planting season, and 95% for the late planting season. 3.5.4. Chemical
    application Murray et al. (2005) used the DT model to model annual pasture production
    for analysis of potential of utilizing variable rate application technology from
    aircraft for improved placement of fertilizer. 4. Fusion of soft computing methods
    in agricultural and biological engineering With the development of soft computing
    in agricultural and biological engineering, techniques have integrated different
    soft computing techniques in a synergistic way. It is advantageous to employ ANNs,
    fuzzy systems, and evolutionary algorithms in combination instead of exclusively
    (Hoffmann et al., 2005). Table 1 lists papers and reports on fusion of soft computing
    techniques agricultural and biological engineering applications. The list indicates
    that the integration of FL and ANNs is probably the most common method of fusion
    in soft computing (thirteen out of twenty-nine collected papers and reports).
    ANFIS (Adaptive-Network-based Fuzzy Inference System) is a fuzzy inference system
    implemented in the framework of adaptive neural networks (Jang, 1993). By using
    a hybrid learning procedure, the ANFIS can construct an input–output mapping based
    on both human knowledge (in the form of fuzzy ‘If–Then’ rules) and stipulated
    input–output data pairs. It has been developed and used to solve problems in agricultural
    and biological engineering. Table 1. Papers and reports on fusion of soft computing

    4.1. Crop management For crop protection, Pearson and Wicklow (2006) developed
    a neural network to identify fungal species that infect single kernels using principal
    components of the reflectance spectra as input features. The neural network was
    trained using GAs as Lestander et al. (2003) indicated that the GA training algorithm
    method was much less likely to overfit the data. Meyer et al. (2004) used fuzzy
    inference systems built with subtractive clustering in an ANFIS for a digital
    camera operation study for color-based classifications of uniform images of grass,
    bare soil, corn stalks residue, and wheat straw residue. For weed detection, Neto
    et al. (2003) used ANFIS for image processing to separate weed from background.
    A GA was incorporated to adjust the fuzzy membership functions to reduce misclassification
    and improve image segmentation. 4.2. ET calculation Based on the previous research
    on fuzzy ET models (Odhiambo et al., 2001a), Odhiambo et al. (2001b) further studied
    how to eliminate trial-and error in determining the shape of the membership functions
    in the fuzzy control rules for estimating daily reference ET by application of
    a fuzzy–neural system through fusing fuzzy logic and ANN on a conceptual and structural
    basis. The neural component provided supervised learning capabilities for optimizing
    the membership functions and extracting fuzzy rules from a set of input–output
    examples selected to cover the data hyperspace of the sites evaluated. 4.3. Soil
    analysis In a study of soil profiles, Odhiambo et al. (2004) combined an ANN and
    a fuzzy system in series and applied the fuzzy–neural network classifier for unsupervised
    clustering and classification of soil profiles using ground-penetrating radar
    imagery. After the ANN classifies soil profile strips into a certain number of
    clusters determined dynamically, the fuzzy membership values for each profile
    strip are evaluated in the set of classified clusters. To predict sediment and
    phosphorous movement, Goel et al. (2004) used fuzzy c-mean clustering algorithms
    for the RBF ANN model through the data from vegetative filter strips. To simultaneously
    predict water content and salinity using the frequency-response soil data, Lee
    et al. (2003) developed partial least-squares and ANFIS (Adaptive-Network Fuzzy
    Inference System) models at different water content and salinity levels measured
    with the four-electrode Wenner array method. 4.4. Precision agriculture Xiang
    and Tian (2007) developed a complete artificially intelligent controller based
    on an ANN and an ANFIS for implementing the controller to automatically adjust
    multispectral camera parameters for compensation of changes in natural lighting
    and to acquire white-balanced images. Oliveira et al. (2006) proposed a two-step
    decision support system starts with an ANN followed by GAs for heuristic search
    to recommend suitable sugarcane areas to be harvested. Liu et al. (2001) designed
    a feedforward, completely connected, BP-trained ANN to approximate the nonlinear
    yield function relating corn yield to factors influencing yield. By stratified
    sampling based on rainfall, some of the data were excluded from the training set
    and used to verify the yield prediction accuracy of the ANN. After the ANN was
    developed and trained, optimization of the fifteen input factors was studied with
    a GA to determine maximum yield. 5. Support vector machines SVMs as a new set
    of supervised generalized linear classifiers, have been introduced to solve problems
    and have attracted greater interest recently in agricultural and biological engineering.
    SVMs are closely related to neural networks. In fact, an SVM model using sigmoid
    kernel function is equivalent to a two-layer perceptron neural network. Using
    a kernel function, SVMs are alternative training methods for polynomial, radial
    basis function, and multilayer perceptron classifiers in which the weights of
    the network are found by solving a quadratic programming problem with linear constraints,
    rather than by solving a nonconvex, unconstrained minimization problem as in standard
    ANN training. SVMs have often higher classification accuracies than multilayer
    perceptron ANNs. SVMs, as a set of supervised generalized linear classifiers,
    have often been found to provide higher classification accuracies than other widely
    used pattern classification techniques such as MLP neural networks. In agricultural
    and biological engineering, the growing interest in SVMs is illustrated in Fig.
    4. Fig. 4 indicates that although the number of peer reviewed publications on
    this topic did not increase steadily over the past few years, an increasing trend
    in all papers suggest increasing usage of established techniques which do not
    represent original research developments. The successful implementations of SVMs
    in agricultural and biological engineering are listed in Table 2. Download : Download

    The growing interest in SVMs are due to: (1) their intrinsic effectiveness with
    respect to traditional classifiers, which results in high classification accuracies
    and very good generalization capability; (2) the limited effort required for architecture
    design (i.e., they involve few control parameters); and (3) the possibility of
    solving the learning problem according to linearly constrained quadratic programming
    methods (Melgani and Bruzzone, 2004). In soil analysis, Lamorski et al. (2008)
    estimated soil hydraulic parameters from measured soil properties using SVMs.
    The results of the research indicated that the three-parameter SVMs performed
    mostly better than or with the same accuracy as the eleven-parameter ANNs. The
    advantage of SVM was more pronounced at soil matric potentials where larger relative
    errors have been encountered and the correlation between predicted and measured
    soil water contents was lower. And most recently, Twarakavi et al. (2009) developed
    SVMs for estimating the hydraulic parameters describing the soil water retention
    and hydraulic conductivity. In estimating water contents and saturated hydraulic
    conductivities the SVM-based method predicted the hydraulic parameters, which
    mostly improved compared with those obtained using the ANN-based method. In the
    studies of crops for precision agriculture, Karimi et al. (2006) evaluated SVM
    as a tool for classifying airborne hyperspectral images taken over a corn field.
    The classification was performed with respect to nitrogen application rates and
    weed management practices, and the classification accuracy was compared with those
    obtained by an ANN model on the same data. The SVM method resulted in very low
    misclassification rates as compared to the ANN approach for all cases. Detection
    of stresses in early crop growth stage using the SVM method could aid in effective
    early application of site-specific remedies to timely in-season interventions.
    Tian et al. (2004) used the SVM and chromaticity moment for recognition of plant
    diseases based on the features of color texture image of plant disease. The experimental
    results proved that the SVM method had excellent classification and generalization
    ability in solving learning problem with small training set of sample, and could
    fit for classification of plant disease. Trebar and Steele (2008) employed a SVM
    for classification of forest data cover types. In this study, a large, imbalanced
    data set in different forest cover type classes was transformed into a number
    of new data sets and a SVM was used to conduct a binary classification of balanced
    and imbalanced data sets with various sizes. The use of distributed SVM architectures
    basically reduced the complexity of the quadratic optimization problem of very
    large data sets. The experimental results of distributed SVM architectures showed
    the improvement of the accuracy for larger data sets in comparison to a single
    SVM classifier and their ability to improve the correct classification of the
    minority class. 6. Comparison and limitations of soft computing techniques There
    are limits on soft computing we need to be aware of in theoretical study and practical
    application. Tikk et al. (2003) studied the approximation behavior of soft computing
    techniques. In the study, the authors conducted a survey of the results of universal
    approximation theorems achieved thus far in various soft computing areas. These
    techniques center mainly in fuzzy control and neural networks. The authors point
    out that these techniques have common approximation behavior in the sense that
    an arbitrary function from a certain set of functions (usually the set of continuous
    function) can be approximated with arbitrary accuracy on a compact domain. This
    means that fuzzy systems and neural networks have the ability to approximate any
    function to an arbitrary degree of accuracy. However, for the approximation, unbounded
    numbers of “building blocks” (i.e. fuzzy sets or hidden neurons) are needed to
    achieve the prescribed accuracy. If the number of building blocks is restricted,
    it is proved for some fuzzy and neural systems that the universal approximation
    property is lost. Therefore, it is reasonable to make a trade-off between accuracy
    and the number of the building blocks in determining functional relationships.
    A typical practical application of this recommendation is to determine the number
    of hidden neurons incrementally in ANN training for acceptable function approximation
    and better generalization. Compared to classical logic, FL is not always accurate
    because the results are often perceived as an estimate. Also, fuzzy systems typically
    require the difficult and time-consuming process of knowledge acquisition although
    they provide the understandable form of knowledge representation. ANNs are powerful
    computing techniques, which are designed to mimic human learning processes by
    establishing linkages between process input and output data. These techniques
    have been widely applied with advanced development with their unique advantages,
    such as no underlying assumption about the distribution of data, arbitrary decision
    boundary capabilities, universal approximation capabilities, easy adaptation to
    different types and structures of data, ability to fuzzy output values to enhance
    classification, and good generalization capabilities. However, ANNs have some
    disadvantages in common, which need to be considered in practical application:
    • Black box ANNs are black box in nature. Therefore, if the problem is to find
    the output response to the input in system identification, ANNs can be a good
    fit. However, if the problem is to specifically identify causal-effective relationship
    between input and output, ANNs have only limited ability to do it compared with
    conventional statistical methods. • Long computing time ANN training needs to
    iteratively determine network structure and update connection weights. Also, data
    used for training may contain certain degree of noises. Therefore, ANN training
    is a time-consuming process. With a typical personal computer or work station,
    the BP algorithm will take a lot of memory and may take minutes, hours, days and
    even longer before the network converges to the optimal point with minimum mean
    square error. Conventional statistical regression with the same set of data, on
    the contrary, may generate results in seconds using the same computer. • Local
    minima Due to addition of hidden nodes and layer(s) and the nonlinearity of the
    activation function of each hidden nodes and/or output nodes in network structure,
    ANN training has the possibility to produce for complex error surfaces which contain
    many minima such as use of BP algorithm for training MLPs. Since some minima are
    deeper than others, it is possible that the algorithm will not find a global minimum.
    Instead, the network may fall into local minima, which represent suboptimal solutions
    instead of optimal. • Overfitting With too much training time, too many hidden
    nodes, or too large training data set, the network will overfit the data and have
    a poor generalization, i.e. high accuracy for training data set but poor interpolation
    of testing data. This is an important issue being investigated in ANN research
    and applications (Huang, 2009). Although ANNs have strong capabilities of learning
    and adaptation with a “black box” nature that deals with inputs and outputs, they
    represent knowledge implicitly and may produce results that are difficult to interpret.
    ANNs also may require long training times on noisy data. Therefore, ANNs may not
    be needed when traditional methods are appropriate. GAs work on their own internal
    rules and are good for complex or loosely defined problems using their inductive
    nature without the need to know any rules of the problem. However, with use of
    this inductive ability alone, the algorithms do not necessarily evolve to the
    optimal solution. GAs always have a risk finding a suboptimal solution. BI uses
    prior probabilities. However, prior probabilities are intrinsically subjective,
    which can be different from person by person. This may be the fundamental limit
    of BI. Usually, learning by DTs is fast, and the result is easily interpreted
    by human specialists. However, the learning could produce overfitting, the output
    attribute of DTs need to be categorical, and each decision is limited to one output
    attribute. The induction process usually selects only a small number of the available
    attributes so that information that is distributed on a large number of attributes
    (with each attribute carrying only limited information about the class) cannot
    be handled adequately, resulting in suboptimal prediction accuracy. In such situations,
    Bayesian classifiers and ANNs are often used instead.SVMs have gained popularity
    in many traditionally ANN dominated fields. Use of the SVM always found the minimum
    globally, which eliminates the local minimum issue happened in ANN training. However,
    SVMs were originally developed to solve binary classification problems. How to
    effectively extend it for multi-class classification is still an ongoing research
    issue. Typically, a multiple class classifier can be constructed by combining
    several binary classifiers. Further, all classes can be considered at once. Hsu
    and Lin (2002) gave decomposition implementations for two such “all-together”
    methods. They compared the performance with three methods based on binary classifications:
    one-against-all, one-against-one, and Directed Acyclic Graph SVM (DAGSVM). The
    experiments indicated that the one-against-one and DAG methods are more suitable
    for practical use than the other methods. 7. The future As described above, each
    soft computing technique has its own limitations. The fusion of two or three of
    these techniques will continue to be one of the major trends in soft computing
    engineering applications. Fuzzy and neuro-fuzzy systems represent knowledge in
    an explicit form, such as fuzzy rules, rather than in an implicit form as ANNs
    alone. Accordingly, FL and ANNs are merged to inherit the advantages of both paradigms
    and to avoid their drawbacks. Recently, with the development of electronics and
    information technologies, 3S (remote sensing (RS), global positioning system (GPS),
    and geographic information system (GIS)) technologies and variable rate technology
    (VRT) have started to become available to agricultural production for crop seeding,
    irrigation, and chemical application. For effective applications of the technologies,
    a system integration is needed. For the system integration, FL is a critical tool
    to establish ‘If–Then’ rules to represent extensive human knowledge to build up
    a knowledge-based system to connect independent components together. In the system
    a knowledge base obtains the information from various sources such as scientists,
    engineers, and farmers and provides advice suited to a geographic location based
    on local weather, soil and water data from GPS, GIS and traditional knowledge
    archives. The weather data are collected from the different sensors on a daily
    basis for solar radiation, air temperature, rainfall, and wind run. The inference
    engine analyzes user query and sends information requests to the knowledge base
    and matches them with the stored knowledge rules through fuzzy ‘If–Then’ rules
    or algorithms specific to the particular domain or discipline. Then the control
    system outputs the decision of the inference engine to the variable rate equipment
    for crop seeding and chemical application. A comprehensive model base includes
    crop growth model, health model, perhaps other models that describes the condition
    of the crop so that information will be provided for decision support to result
    in more precise timing of seeding, more accurate use of seed, fertilizers and,
    irrigated water in order to enhance crop production and environmental protection
    as well. A method base contains linear and nonlinear methods of pattern recognition,
    statistics, and soft computing such as FL, ANNs and GAs. In the modeling process,
    one or more methods can be activated to assemble and generate designated model
    structure and parameters. ANNs have been used as a powerful tool in solving problems
    in scientific research and engineering applications. ANNs have their own limitations
    to restrict them as a substitute of traditional methods such as statistical regression,
    pattern recognition, and time series analysis. In the next decade or so with advanced
    development of computer power, ANNs will continue to develop new applications
    in various fields in agricultural and biological engineering. As a powerful alternative
    to conventional methods, ANNs will be studied more to develop approaches to overcoming
    problems of ANNs in general or in a specific research area. In food science and
    engineering, soil and water relationships for crop management, and decision support
    for precision agriculture, more applications of ANNs may be expected. ANNs will
    be continuously applied standalone or fusion with other soft computing techniques.
    Areas of study may actively involve food quality and safety, soil and water resources
    management, crop pest management, and precision agriculture. For effective research
    and development it may be possible to generate guidelines for predetermining optimal
    ANN structures and training algorithms. For process statistical modeling, additional
    research topics may be to establish generic procedures to include significant
    variables to and exclude non-significant ones from ANN models and to add confidence
    limits on the output predictions and parameter estimations. These developments
    will permit ANNs to also utilize the techniques of conventional statistics. SVMs
    appeared as a new technique which has advanced soft computing development. In
    practical applications, SVMs often produced high classification accuracies and
    very good generalization capabilities compared with ANNs. Also, in the process
    of modeling SVMs require less effort in setting up control parameters for architecture
    design. SVM models are close to classical MLP neural networks. Using a kernel
    function, SVMs are an alternative training method for polynomial, RBF and MLP
    classifiers in which the weights of the network are found by solving a quadratic
    programming problem with linear constraints, rather than by solving a non-convex,
    unconstrained minimization problem as in standard neural network training. With
    the advantages of SVMs over ANNs and the growing interests of SVMs, it can be
    expected that in the next decade SVMs will be more actively used in agricultural
    and biological engineering. No matter which soft computing method is used, adaptive
    learning can be a powerful tool when also implemented to appropriately exploit
    the potential synergy between methods, some that can include input from sensors.
    An example of how this can work involves model-based irrigation scheduling with
    assistance from soil water sensors. Thomson (1998) explained a method by which
    granular matrix soil water sensors were used to provide “feedback” or correction
    to two input parameters of the water balance component of the Pnutgro 1.02 growth
    model (Boote et al., 1989). Soil water sensors inferred relative water uptake
    in the root zone and corrected the root growth function influencing the depth
    of water regulation. The goal was to improve model predictions so that the model
    could run stand-alone after sensors provided correction data during several soil
    drying cycles. Experiments indicated temporal convergence of model-based representations
    of soil water potential on sensor-based representations as two parameters (soil–water
    parameter Drained Upper Limit or DUL) and root weighting factors were adjusted.
    In the soil and water context for crop management and decision support for precision
    agriculture more applications of soft computing techniques, especially SVMs standalone
    or fused with other soft computing techniques and sensor-derived information,
    may be expected. Areas of application might involve classification for agricultural
    soil spatial distribution, water resource optimization for irrigation planning,
    detection and classification of crop stress and pests (weeds, insects and diseases)
    detection, analysis of remote sensing imagery, study of crop and yield, and field
    prescriptions for variable rate chemical application. Another trend in soft computing
    applications is likely to be the fusion of soft computing and hard computing.
    Although no successful applications of hard and soft computing fusion in agricultural
    and biological engineering could be found thus far, the technique shows great
    potential for future research over the next decade. The fusion of soft computing
    and hard computing should be able to provide innovative solutions to the problems
    with high-performance, cost-effective, and reliable computing systems. Many publications
    are useful to help develop such computing systems. Ovaska (2005) edited a book
    that combines the experience of many internationally recognized experts in the
    soft- and hard-computing research worlds to present practicing engineers with
    the broadest possible array of methodologies for developing innovative and competitive
    solutions to real-world problems. Each of the chapters illustrates the wide-ranging
    applicability of the fusion concept in such critical areas as • computer security
    and data mining; • electrical power systems and large-scale plants; • motor drives
    and tool wear monitoring; • user interfaces and the World Wide Web; and • aerospace
    and robust control. Ovaska et al. (2006) clarified the present vagueness related
    to the fusion of soft computing and hard computing. Different fusion schemes were
    classified as 12 core categories and six supplementary categories, and the characteristic
    features of soft computing and hard computing constituents in practical fusion
    implementations were discussed as well. Sick and Ovaska (2007) introduced a multi-dimensional
    categorization scheme for fusion techniques and applied it by analyzing several
    fusion techniques where the soft computing part was realized by a neural network.
    The categorization scheme facilitated the discussion of advantages or drawbacks
    of certain fusion approaches, thus supporting the development of novel fusion
    techniques and applications. References Abraham et al., 2007 A. Abraham, R. Jain,

- analysis: The study proposes a planning procedure for VRI with traveling rain gun
    sprinklers - a widely utilized irrigation system in agriculture due to its affordability
    and adaptability. The procedure aims to enhance water distribution precision and
    incorporates an information system to gather data from remote sensors and create
    VRI prescription maps. The system utilizes satellite imagery, vegetation indices,
    and crop water demand maps to determine the optimal water quantity for each field
    zone. The prescription map is then used to generate motion commands for a rain
    gun system connected to a hose reel. The system's foundation is a sprinkler model
    that has undergone simulation validation and enables fully automated operation.
    Experiments have confirmed the improved water distribution accuracy made possible
    by software-controlled sprinklers and effective planning techniques.

    Abstract Automated variable rate irrigation (VRI) is one of the frontiers for
    sustainable water use in agriculture. In this paper, we describe a planning procedure

    servicesRemote sensing 1. Introduction Precise, site-specific irrigation is a
    major challenge and critical task to achieve efficient use of water resources
    in farming as well as to meet sustainability goals. Advancement in technology
    has made viable variable rate irrigation (VRI) (Evans et al., 2020, O’Shaughnessy
    et al., 2019), with clear potential economic, environmental, and agronomic advantages.
    Yet, the widespread application of VRI is hindered by the complexity and cost
    associated with the deployment of new or upgraded irrigation equipment. Among
    the different irrigation techniques, sprinkler-based irrigation using self-propelled
    machines, either with linear motion or with center pivot, is a widespread practice,
    especially in massive production farming involving large-scale crops (Evans et
    al., 2020, Mostafa and Derbala, 2013). Indeed, sprinkler irrigation covers a significant
    fraction of irrigated land worldwide (e.g., above 60% in Europe and above 40%
    in Northern America) (Pereira and Gonçalves, 2018). Mobile rain gun irrigation
    sprinklers, investigated in this work, are among the most widespread machines
    in open field irrigation, thanks to their relatively low cost and easy deployment
    by the farmer in multiple fields. The development of techniques enabling automatic
    monitoring, planning and control of machines equipped with VRI capabilities, including
    sprinkler-based machines, can have therefore a significant impact toward water
    use efficiency and sustainability (Abioye et al., 2020, Evans et al., 2020). In
    the last two decades, a number of Decision Support Systems (DDS) (Bergez et al.,
    2012, Moreira Barradas et al., 2012, Rinaldi and He, 2014, O’Shaughnessy et al.,
    2015, Adeyemi et al., 2018) have been proposed to schedule VRI. These DSS are
    designed for different irrigation techniques, often targeting specific crops,
    and operate at different spatial resolution (e.g. entire field or site-specific).
    They cope with spatial and temporal variability using various amount and type
    of prior static knowledge (e.g. about soil variability) and sensor-acquired data
    (e.g., weather or vegetation information). The DSS in Bergez et al. (2012) and
    in Moreira Barradas et al. (2012) provide schemes for space decomposition at different
    scales, from regional to irrigation block to field partitions, but do not include
    automatic acquisition of sensor measurements from the crop nor support planning
    of VRI. Haghverdi et al. (2016) investigate the potential of site-specific irrigation
    with optimized water production functions and adapt the resulting irrigation prescriptions
    to large center pivot machines. However, the degree of automation of the data
    flow from the irrigation prescription to the programming of the machine is unclear.
    Moreover, the approach does not consider other types of irrigation equipment.
    Li et al. (2020) point out the importance of using a sensor network including
    remote sensing, in-site and IoT devices to enable precision irrigation with sprinklers.
    However, they do not provide the procedures and models to transform irrigation
    prescription maps into irrigation plans suitable for actual irrigation equipment,
    and specifically for self-propelled rain gun sprinklers. In general, DSS allow
    accurate assessment of the proper, site-specific water needed by the crop, and
    hence are a key step toward efficient use of water. Their main limitation lies
    in the lack of integration between the information system and the automated irrigation
    equipment available to the farmer. Full machine-to-machine operation requires
    to take into account the farming geometry and the actual differential irrigation
    capabilities of the machine. Studies dealing with physical modeling of linear
    sprinklers (Carrión et al., 2001, Li et al., 2015, Ouazaa et al., 2014, Ferreira
    Borges and Teixeira de Andrade, 2021, Hua et al., 2022) focus on water distribution
    patterns obtained with different shapes and sizes of the nozzle to improve water
    distribution uniformity in fixed position and do not investigate the effectiveness
    of irrigation in motion, nor they consider the application to VRI. While accurate
    sprinkler models are required to measure and improve machine performance, such
    analysis does not cope with water distribution on the farming field and has limited
    applicability in sprinkler motion planning. There are few works investigating
    the water distribution on farming fields achieved by irrigation systems like center
    pivot systems (McCarthy et al., 2010) or movable rain gun sprinklers (Ghinassi,
    2010, Miodragovic et al., 2012), either through simulation or experimental assessment.
    Such studies enable prediction and even planning of the machine motion, often
    aimed at uniform water distribution rather than at informed and sensor-guided
    VRI. In this paper, we propose a planning procedure for the motion of a rain gun
    sprinkler enabling automated irrigation according to the best approximation of
    a VRI prescription map generated by a DSS. Indeed, the potential use of rain guns
    for VRI is deterred by the difficulty for the farmer of programming non-uniform
    water distributions. The automatic execution of irrigation through a programmable
    actuator better guarantees that the correct quantities of water are properly supplied
    to the crop. To our knowledge, there are no automated systems connecting high
    level prescription maps to rain gun actuators for VRI. Moreover, given the extensive
    use of movable rain gun sprinklers, this approach can have a beneficial impact
    toward widespread application of VRI. The planning procedure for rain gun sprinklers
    reported in this paper has been developed in the frame of project POSITIVE1 (Amoretti
    et al., 2020, Penzotti et al., 2022), whose information system and processing
    pipeline are described in the next section. The outcome has been assessed through
    both simulation and experiments. Simulation is based on a purposely-designed distribution
    model, reported in the paper, that abstracts from hydrodynamic aspects and allows
    offline prediction of water distribution. Field experiments have been performed
    in a farm using an advanced industrial rain gun, the Elektrorain system manufactured
    by the company SIME Srl, Italy.2 For this purpose, a software module has been
    developed to control the rotation speed and angle limits of the sprinkler head
    according to the planned motion, and the rain gun control unit has been directly
    interfaced to the POSITIVE information system. In summary, the contributions of
    this study are the following: 1. We illustrate a system for computation of a field-specific
    irrigation plan suitable for rain gun sprinklers starting from the prescription
    of an irrigation DSS. 2. We propose an algorithm as well as a system physical
    model for planning the motion of a rain gun sprinkler in order to achieve differential
    irrigation on field partitions. 3. We report the implementation and testing of
    the planning algorithm with an actual sprinkler in a field experiment and in simulation.
    2. Overview of the irrigation system 2.1. Approach to planning VRI with rain gun
    sprinklers Rain guns are usually connected to hose reels by a pipe and are moved
    by wrapping the hose while sprinkling water on the field. During the backward
    motion, the rain gun head rotates in order to distribute water in the desired
    directions. Recently, advanced rain guns and hose reels can be controlled through
    software interfaces in order to automate irrigation. The planning algorithm described
    in this paper controls the rotation speed and angle limits of the sprinkler and
    the reeling speed of the hose reel to which the rain gun is attached. The rain
    gun supplies water while pulled by the hose reel, thereby irrigating a pull area.
    Hence, the reported procedure allows differentiation of the water quantity distributed
    within each pull area by planning the sprinkler motion. The pull area can be partitioned
    both longways, into multiple segments, and crosswise, into left and right regions.
    Although VRI prescription maps can be obtained by feeding a DSS with remote (e.g.
    satellite-based vegetation maps) or local (e.g. distributed soil moisture data)
    sensor information, these maps do not translate directly into the differential
    irrigation which can be actually applied by available equipment. Hence, in this
    paper we develop a planning system to map a generic VRI map, possibly articulated
    into pixels corresponding to satellite-derived Vegetation Index (VI) maps, into
    a proper partitioning in sub-regions which can be applied by a specific irrigation
    machine, taking into account its features and constraints as well as its position
    and motion direction in the field (in general not aligned with satellite-based
    maps). The proposed planning algorithm computes the variable retraction velocity
    of the sprinkler and the rain gun orientation limits over the time so as to deliver
    water to the crop according to the most accurate, feasible approximation of the
    processed VRI prescription map. 2.2. POSITIVE information system Project POSITIVE
    (Amoretti et al., 2020, Penzotti et al., 2022) has tackled precision irrigation
    over large regions by transforming multispectral images from Copernicus satellites
    and data from field sensors into high resolution crop- and terrain-specific irrigation
    prescription maps. Planning actuation of the prescription map via a rain gun sprinkler
    is one of the open protocols developed within the project. In POSITIVE the irrigation
    prescription map for each registered plot is provided by the IRRIFRAME3 agronomic
    DSS (Mannini et al., 2013), and relies on a number of information flows and knowledge
    sources, including plot geometry (called polygon), soil structure and map, crop
    management information (crop type, seed or plant date, etc.), crop development
    model, history of precipitations and irrigations, data from sensors in the plot
    (if any), and weather forecasts. IRRIFRAME is available in most Italian regions
    and managed by the national association of water reclamation consortia under the
    technical guidance of CER (Canale Emiliano Romagnolo).4 The service is freely
    accessible by registered farmers and provides on a daily-basis updated agronomic
    advice for registered fields and crops. It provides an irrigation and fertigation
    calendar trading off crop requirements with sustainable management of water and
    other resources (e.g., pesticides and nutrients), thus reducing the impact of
    cultivation. IRRIFRAME maintains a data record of each registered field or plot
    and updates such record with any information provided by the user and with the
    measurements provided by on-field and remote sensing data. In POSITIVE, the IRRIFRAME
    data record of each registered plot has been enriched with the Normalized Difference
    Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) maps (Huete et al.,
    2002), computed from Sentinel-2 products. Custom information services for data
    processing and storage have been implemented in POSITIVE to manage the flow of
    Sentinel-2 data to IRRIFRAME. An overall view of this process, repeated each time
    there is a valid Sentinel-2 sampling, is shown in Fig. 1. The water application
    depth is computed in IRRIFRAME via an evapotranspiration model based on crop coefficient.
    This default prescription has been enriched in POSITIVE using the NDVI and EVI
    maps, which enable a continuous recalibration of the prescription based on satellite
    revisit times (typically every 5 days). Moreover, for large-scale crops the basic
    irrigation prescription is generalized into a VRI prescription map at the resolution
    (10 m) of Copernicus multispectral imagery. Download : Download high-res image

    (b) Pixels that carry information on the polygon are extracted; data verification
    and cleaning operations for presence of artifacts, edge effects and more are applied.
    (c) NDVI and EVI maps are computed from the cleaned images, formatted, and uploaded
    in IRRIFRAME. Although producing a valid irrigation map is the output of a complex
    DSS, in this paper we focus on the exploitation of satellite-based data and related
    VI to enable VRI where appropriate. In the pipeline encompassed by POSITIVE, irrigation
    machines like movable rain gun sprinklers, linear spray booms or center pivot
    systems are bound to execute the water application depth maps. 2.2.1. Data-driven
    irrigation Data-driven irrigation systems comprise two main modules: an information
    system and one or more actuators for irrigation. • Information System. The information
    system coordinates the acquisition of all data and information required to produce
    a valid irrigation prescription. A key component for smart irrigation is the specialized
    DSS. The final output of the information system is the irrigation prescription
    presented as a map, associating to each partition of a field the water supply
    required by the crop. The field surface can be partitioned in several ways: for
    example, satellites provide data about a field with a given surface resolution,
    whereas the same field is divided into tracks according to the physical characteristics
    of the specific irrigation equipment (e.g., the range of the rain gun sprinkler).
    Moreover, the irrigation equipment used in a field can change over time, so partitioning
    and mapping among partitions must be configurable. The map must be adapted to
    the required field partitioning when delivered to the farmer or to the irrigation
    system. • Actuators for Irrigation. The information system can automatically deliver
    a VRI water depth map to advanced irrigation machines equipped with a suitable
    control unit. There are different types of sprinkler-based irrigation machines
    that can receive and apply VRI maps. In this work, we focus on rain gun sprinklers
    towed by a hose reel winch. The components of the information system are described
    next according to the data flow shown in Fig. 2. VRI requires a differentiated
    irrigation prescription map for different areas of the plot based on the localized
    need of the crop. A standard approach (Brown, 2015) is to retrieve information
    from the remote sensing activities of the Copernicus program, chiefly the products
    made available by Sentinel-2 satellites. Sentinel-2 data are available in the
    form of multispectral images of large geographical areas, composed in 13 spectral
    bands and with different resolutions. Products are provided in Cartesian raster
    format, in which each pixel represents a square plot of land with a side equal
    to the resolution. Download : Download high-res image (455KB) Download : Download

    The main activities are acquisition of remote sensing data (possibly integrated
    by local sensor data), acquisition of the water application map, actuation of
    data-driven irrigation. Data acquisition and model update are performed continuously.
    For the areas of interest, the information system retrieves and stores the products
    at each new transit of the satellites. These products are processed in terms of
    VI maps referred to a plot, and then delivered to IRRIFRAME, which provides site-specific
    agronomic information and irrigation and fertigation prescriptions for registered
    fields and crops (Mannini et al., 2013). In the experiment reported in this paper,
    the well-known NDVI computed from the Sentinel-2 products has been adopted. This
    approach is extensible to other appropriate VI or information derived from sensing
    activities. The spectral bands needed for computing the NDVI map are provided
    by Sentinel-2 products at the maximum resolution of . This resolution is adequate
    for many open field crops (corn, tomato, soybean, etc.) in medium–large plots,
    where the plot is covered by a high number of samples. Conversely, very small
    plots are too limited and unsuitable for VRI based on satellite data. Other operations
    required for computation of an NDVI map suitable for the DSS include verification
    and cleaning of the Sentinel-2 products, such as outlier removal, filtering around
    the edges of the plot for mitigation of artifacts in the images (e.g., roads and
    buildings), and coordinate system transformation. In addition to the processed
    NDVI map, IRRIFRAME exploits a wealth of information to compute the water irrigation
    prescription for the plot, including crop, soil, and weather information. At the
    end of the process, a spatially-variable water application map is available, i.e.
    a map that associates to each field cell the recommended water application to
    be supplied. Usually, the map is provided in the form of a tessellation of square
    cells , where the size of each is exploiting the resolution of Sentinel-2 images.
    The application depth of a cell is the quantity of water expressed in the form
    of the total water volume for the surface or as the average water application
    depth per surface point. The final step is transformation of the irrigation prescription
    map into irrigation machine commands. This operation is strongly dependent on
    the available actuators. Irrigation machines may be equipped with communication
    interfaces to receive commands and transmit data to the information system. In
    such case, the VRI process can be fully automated. In this paper, we report the
    interfacing of the POSITIVE information system with a movable rain gun sprinkler
    via a custom communication protocol defined by the manufacturer. The rain gun
    can receive commands in real-time and hence be driven by a software application.
    Special-purpose services have been implemented in order to translate the irrigation
    prescription map into low-level commands, as the Elektrorain rain gun is not natively
    configured to operate VRI. 2.2.2. Actuators for irrigation Electronically-controlled
    actuators are mandatory to achieve automatic irrigation according to the water
    application depth provided by the information system. Movable rain gun sprinklers
    comprise: • a self-winding towing machine (hose reel) positioned at one side of
    the plot and connected to the water supply via a pump; • a towed trolley with
    a rain gun or cannon, mounted as a rotating arm, which irrigates by sprinkling
    (see Fig. 3). Initially, the trolley is transported away from the reel on the
    other side of the irrigated plot by means of a tractor, unrolling the feeding-towing
    hose. During irrigation, the towing machine rolls up the hose, thereby drawing
    to itself the sprinkler trolley. We refer to this type of movement as a pull.
    To each pull corresponds a rectangular wet region at the end of the irrigation.
    The quantity of water delivered depends on the dimensional characteristics of
    the machines, on the pressure with which the system is fed, and on the speed commanded
    to the trolley, called retraction speed. In order to apply VRI as proposed in
    this paper, the actuators must implement advanced mechanical and electronic features
    as summarized below. Download : Download high-res image (322KB) Download : Download

    reel (1) and a rain gun cannon (2). The dynamics of the actuators are schematized
    by red arrows. Mechanical features. Both the hose reel and the rain gun must have
    the ability to differentiate the amount of water released along the pull, changing
    some of the parameters. • The hose reel must be able to modify the retraction
    speed during execution, thus slowing down the movement of the trolley where a
    larger supply of water is required. • The rain gun must be able to modify the
    rotation speed and/or the start and end stroke angles. Indeed, recent rain gun
    models provide such feature, even though it was designed to increase the uniformity
    of the sprinkled water or to avoid wetting unwanted areas on the edge or inside
    the plot. Through appropriate modeling and programming, as reported in this paper,
    the feature can be exploited to differentiate the quantity of water delivered
    transversely to the pull direction. Other parameters, such as the water flow,
    are difficult to modify and are usually considered non-changeable in real-time.
    Electronic features. The irrigation system must be able to receive and follow
    an irrigation plan, that is, to memorize and effect changes to the parameters
    described above on the basis of the different water application depths required
    along the pull. This programmability can be static or dynamic, i.e. it can be
    set only before irrigation or it can be continuously corrected based on real-time
    sensor feedback or commands. In this case, a remote communication capability on
    the part of the machines is required. The SIME Elektrorain rain gun sprinkler
    provides the mechanical, electronic and communication features described above
    and hence has been used as a reference and for the experiments reported in this
    paper. However, the proposed irrigation planning procedure is quite general and
    can be applied to any rain gun with the required features. 3. Model for sprinkler-based
    irrigation This section provides a simplified model for mobile rain gun sprinklers
    and for the irrigation process. The model will be used for planning irrigation
    according to a VRI prescription map. 3.1. Sprinkler state model Sprinkler irrigation
    is achieved by retracting the rain gun, which is commanded by reeling the hose,
    and by rotating the rain gun head during the retract motion. Assuming water flow
    approximately constant during irrigation, water distribution depends on the changes
    in position and orientation of the rain gun in the course of irrigation, in other
    words by the state of the sprinkler. The state variables represent the position
    and orientation of the modeled sprinkler in the world. Geographic information
    systems describe the position of irrigation machines and fields according to geographic
    spherical coordinate systems, but in this context a planar Euclidean reference
    system is more convenient. We assume that the reference frame local is placed
    on the ground surface that we approximate with a plane, and that the position
    and orientation of the sprinkler frame is given by pose vector representing the
    transformation matrix . Without losing generality, we assume that the pull direction
    is the same of axis of and, hence, . It is reasonable to assume the orientation
    of the sprinkler frame consistent with the wrapping direction, i.e. . The orientation
    of the rotating head of the sprinkler, which is responsible for the water flow
    direction, is described by angle . Thus, the state vector of the sprinkler is
    , which can be reduced to the components since for most problems and . It will
    be clear from context whether the symbol refers to the full or the reduced state
    vector. The evolution of the sprinkler state is described by the simple equations
    (1) (2) A single irrigation pull starts with the sprinkler in position , where
    is the length of the pull rectangle and is the range of the water flow. Then,
    it is pulled by the hose reel and moves with speed , where the retraction velocity
    is negative since the motion versus is contrary to the axis of frame . The rotating
    head of the sprinkler changes its orientation between two extreme angles and and
    the rotation speed is . In the case of uniform irrigation on all the field, the
    input is a step function for every sweeping cycle (3) where is the constant sweeping
    speed, is the sweeping time and the orientation in . The above command can be
    reformulated with respect to the sprinkler orientation as (4) This second form
    divides the interval according to another state variable and is more convenient
    in many computations. 3.2. Irrigation model The hydraulic model adopted here is
    simplified. We assume that the water pushed in the sprinkler has constant pressure
    ( ), constant volumetric flow rate ( ) and constant range ( ). The range is defined
    as the distance between the sprinkler center and the point where flowing water
    concentration is maximum. We will propose in Section 5 a distribution function
    for application rate that approximates a more accurate hydrodynamic model. However,
    this section avoids the choice of a specific distribution by reasoning on the
    average water spilled on a field area. The model assumes that the maximum range
    and the application rate distribution of the sprinkler rain gun are negligible
    compared with the longitudinal length of the field (or the longitudinal length
    of a field sector, if the field is split longitudinally). The irrigation area
    reached by the sprinkler in a single pull is abstractly defined as a pull rectangle.
    The length of the pull rectangle is equal to , which is the length of the path
    traveled by the sprinkler when pulled by the hose reel. Its width depends on the
    angle interval covered by the rotating head of the sprinkler (5) If and , then
    , i.e. the width is the double of the sprinkler range. On average, the water volume
    supplied in a time interval is distributed by the sprinkler retracting with wrapping
    speed on the surface with area equal to (6) The surface represents the area reached
    by the sprinkler jet, even though the water distribution is possibly uneven. On
    average, the water application depth is (7) The above equality is exact when both
    and are constant over interval , i.e. and . The supplied water per unit surface
    is an average value achieved through changes of the sprinkler position ( ) and
    sprinkler head orientation ( ). When modeling the instantaneous water distribution
    of a rain gun as in Section 5, we have to use the application rate, which is the
    time derivative of . This simple model can be used to specify the water volume
    supplied to different areas. For example, the pull rectangle can be split longitudinally
    along the pull direction and transversely along the orthogonal direction . The
    regions corresponding to the longitudinal partition of the pull rectangle are
    called sectors . Each sector is further partitioned into left and right sub-sectors
    with respect to the sprinkler retraction line. The total water volume supplied
    on sector depends on the retraction speed (i.e. on the time the sprinkler jet
    falls on the field with constant volumetric flow rate ), but the water supplied
    to each sector and can be diversified according to the time the sprinkler is directed
    on the left or on the right. The sprinkler state variables are illustrated in
    Fig. 4. We focus on the precision irrigation of the left and right sub-sectors
    that can be replicated separately on each sector under the hypothesis that longitudinal
    transition between contiguous sectors has negligible effect on irrigation. Download

    the left and the right sub-sectors, . The total volume of water is then split
    into and , and using Eq. (7) the water application depths on left and right are
    respectively (8) where the and are the widths of respectively the left and the
    right sectors, and . If symmetric angle values and are assigned, then . In such
    symmetric case, the ratio between left and right application depths depends straightforwardly
    on the left and right times as (9) There are different ways to control and and
    two of them are discussed in Section 4. The ratio of and only depends on the state
    variables of the rain gun like its rotation speed or the initial and final rotation
    angles. Conversely, the average water application rate is a function of retraction
    speed , which is controlled by the hose reel towing machine. In the symmetric
    case, the average application depth on a sector is . The pull speed needed to
    achieve the required average in a sector is derived from Eq. (7) as (10) Thus,
    the sprinkler commands for controlling the application depths on sub-sectors are
    computed from Eqs. (9), (10). The proposed model holds under the hypothesis that
    the target values of and as well as the retraction speed smoothly change in longitudinal
    direction. Moreover, full variable rate irrigation requires control and communication
    of both the rain gun sprinkler and the towing machine that often have different
    manufacturers. In this paper, we focus only on the former component. 4. Planning
    for precise irrigation This section presents two policies for computing irrigation
    commands to achieve different application rates and in left and right sub-sectors
    with respect to the pull direction of the sprinkler. The first method is based
    on differential angular speeds of the sprinkler. The second method is based on
    the manipulation of initial and final angles of the sprinkler. The second method
    is more consistent with the requirements of real irrigation scenarios and is therefore
    better described. Setting differentiated angular speeds. The total water volume
    can be split in the two sub-sectors according to the time the sprinkler is directed
    toward each of them according to Eq. (8). Such goal could be achieved by setting
    different rotation speeds and respectively on the left and on the right sectors
    (11) where . In each sweep, the time intervals in which the sprinkler is directed
    toward the left and right sectors are respectively and . The non-continuous staircase
    function in Eq. (11) is just a setpoint and the real speed depends on the dynamics
    of the system. It would be more realistic to set trapezoid or even parabolic command
    functions for transitions from to and vice versa, but this paper will not address
    this approach. In the symmetric case, the ratio of application depths of Eq. (9)
    is related to the angular speeds in the left and the right sub-sectors according
    to (12) Thus, different irrigation of the left and right sub-sectors can be achieved
    by setting different values of the rotation speed, and . However, setting non-uniform
    values of the gun rotation speed incurs several disadvantages from a crop perspective.
    The jet range slightly changes during rotation so that the adoption of different
    speeds may result into unequal coverage of irrigation areas. The transition between
    setpoints and is not immediate. Moreover, a slower rotation speed implies that
    the sprinkler jet falls for longer time on a specific area, i.e. it applies force
    on the same plant which could be excessive for some crops. Setting differentiated
    angular trajectories. An alternative modulation of water flows in the left and
    right sub-sectors is achieved by dynamically changing and , while keeping a constant
    value for . This approach should be preferred since it reduces uneven water distribution,
    accelerated drops, and potential damage of the crop. Let be the index of the sweeps
    of the sprinkler. For each sweep, the extreme angles and can be set. In the course
    of sweeps, the total sweeping times of the left and right sub-sectors are (13)
    For sake of uniformity, it would be convenient to have sweeps covering all the
    available angle interval, i.e. and . With the standard choice , at each sweep
    we may have a complete sweep covering both left and right, or a half-sweep either
    to the left or to the right. Let be the counters of left and right half-sweeps
    in a sequence of sweeps. Under these hypotheses, Eq. (13) has the simpler expression
    (14) If the times and depend on the integer counters and , the ratio of the application
    depths in Eq. (9) is also constrained by the feasible values of the discrete variables
    and . The total irrigation time of the sprinkler on a longitudinal sector of length
    is equal to , where is the pull speed set for the sector as in Eq. (10). Such
    sector time may not correspond exactly to the time required for sweeps given by
    the sum of and , since these times refer to complete half-sweeps on the left and
    right sub-sectors. Hence, there is a residual time spent during transition to
    the next sector. Thus, the total irrigation time on a sector of length is (15)
    The desired value is , but the chosen simplified control of sprinkler rotation
    makes and function of integer variables (the half-sweep counters) as discussed
    in the following. Both Eqs. (9), (15) constrain the times and and the desired
    application depths and . Eq. (9) can only be approximated, since and depend on
    discrete variables. Thus, the planning problem can be formulated as (16) (17)
    (18) The parameter (like ) is the compensation for the discrete values assumed
    by variables and . Since and are integers, it is not guaranteed that their ratio
    is equal to , and is the value of such discrepancy. The residual parameters and
    should be as small as possible. The solution is found by computing the maximum
    total number of half-sweeps from Eq. (17) (with ) and, then, by finding the best
    approximation of the left side of Eq. (16). Download : Download high-res image

    half-sweeps and , the half-sweeps must be distributed over time in sequences and
    . A criterion is to distribute the half-sweeps as equally as possible while the
    sprinkler is traversing the current sector. Algorithm 1 reports a simple procedure
    for the computation of the angle delimiters and . First, the number of half-sweeps
    is computed (line 1) based on Eq. (17). By choosing to be the nearest integer,
    we minimize the value of residual time . Then, the number of left and right half-sweeps

    half-sweeps. A left half-sweep is executed when the ratio is less than . Similarly,
    a right half-sweep is executed when the reciprocal ratio satisfies the equivalent
    statement. 5. Simulation Simulation enables the assessment of expected results
    of a planned irrigation before its execution on the field. The planning method
    for sprinkler-based irrigation illustrated in Section 4 operates on average application
    rate over field sub-regions. However, the simulation of sprinkler water requires
    a more detailed distribution of water flow on the ground surface, while avoiding
    detailed fluid dynamic description. The standard model in literature (Ouazaa et
    al., 2014, Ferreira Borges and Teixeira de Andrade, 2021) focuses on uniform water
    distribution in all the directions of the sprinkler during irrigation. We propose
    to use probability density functions to describe the application rate of the sprinkler
    on a specific field point. Such probability functions are simply models and are
    used for deterministic analysis. Given the sprinkler state , our goal is to evaluate
    the instantaneous water flow on each point of the field at a given time instant
    . Direct observation (Ouazaa et al., 2014, Li et al., 2015) suggests that the
    water flow is concentrated around a point corresponding to the sprinkler range
    in direction , although water is distributed also on the distance interval . Moreover,
    the sprinkler flow is angularly concentrated around the direction with standard
    deviation. Instead of Cartesian coordinates, the distribution of application rate
    is better modeled in polar coordinates . The complete distribution is defined
    as the product of a direction distribution and a range distribution . The water
    flow is higher for close to the direction of the sprinkler gun. The von Mises
    distribution is a suitable central distribution for angles defined as (19) where
    is the concentration parameter, is the mean and mode of the distribution and is
    the modified Bessel function of order 0. Since the range is a non-negative quantity,
    we need a distribution defined on non-negative real domain . We propose to model
    the sprinkler range using the easily manageable biased Rayleigh (Lodi Rizzini
    et al., 2019) defined as (20) where is the mode, the width parameter, and the
    normalization constant. The values of and can be set s.t. the sprinkler range
    is equal to where is set to include most of the area of the distribution (in our
    simulation ). The application rate distribution is given by the product of the
    angular and range distributions (21) where is the constant water volume per time
    (in ) supplied by the sprinkler at constant pressure and nozzle size. Table 1
    provides the values of the distribution parameters enabling simulation of the
    Elektrorain sprinkler used in the experiments. The parameters have been either
    empirically measured, e.g. the range or , or derived from empirical quantities,
    e.g. is set to yield a field-of-view of approximately . Simulation uses the model
    of the application rate previously described to evaluate the water volume provided
    to each sub-region of the field. The flow distribution is sampled with desired
    resolution and its coordinates and are converted to Cartesian ones . A water volume
    is attributed to each sample and to the field sub-region where belongs to. Such
    simple procedure allows prediction of irrigation results. The Octave code of the
    simulation is publicly available.5 Table 1. Parameter values for simulation of
    the SIME Elektrorain sprinkler. Parameter Value 44.0 m 498.55 26.0 5 m 6. Experiments
    This section describes experiments carried out in summer 2021. We describe the
    experimental setup including devices, facilities, configuration parameters and
    deployment activities. Then, we present the quantitative results about controlled
    water distribution as measured by a set of water catch cans positioned in the
    ground. Finally, we discuss the outcome of the experiments. 6.1. Experimental
    irrigation system The irrigation setup used in the experiments exploits the POSITIVE
    information services described in Section 2, where a VRI prescription map is produced
    by the IRRIFRAME DSS. The SIme Elektrorain sprinkler is the main actuator operated
    in the experiment. The sprinkler was clasped and pulled by a hose reel towing
    machine (manufactured by RM S.r.l.). The whole system is shown in Fig. 5. The
    Elektrorain is equipped with a control unit that receives commands via a proprietary
    communication protocol. The hose reel machine is not remotely controllable and
    can only tow the sprinkler at uniform speed. Such system allows to test VRI between
    the left and right sub-sectors of the pulling area, while the average supplied
    water is constant according to Eq. (7). A fully controllable hose reel machine
    supporting variable retraction speed and application-level communication could
    modulate the value of in different segments of the field. The following Elektrorain
    features make it suitable for VRI: • Low latency remote control allowed by 3G
    connection with proprietary communication protocol. An authorized application
    can send messages to request the rain gun status or to control its motion, e.g.
    to change the angular limits or rotation speed. • Programmable irrigation parameters
    stored by the control unit. Parameters include the head rotation speed setpoint
    for a specific angle interval and the angle limits of the sweep motion. Through
    these parameters, the machine behavior can be programmed for differentiated irrigation
    during the retraction motion. • Controlled water distribution and angular speed
    for different angular sectors with 1 deg resolution. • Sensors reporting operating
    condition and machine state, including a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)
    receiver returning the sprinkler position as well as water pressure and tilt sensors.
    For the purpose of the experiment, a control application has been developed to
    translate the VRI prescription map into low-medium level machine commands based
    on the Elektrorain custom protocol. The control application implements the discrete
    modeling defined in Section 3, which is updated by reading the status of the machine
    (last position returned by GNSS and current orientation angle) with a mechanism
    based on timed polling. The application can control the behavior of the machine
    both by changing parameters instantaneously (such as speed and direction of rotation)
    and by setting sections of programmed executions with their associated duration.
    The application also provides real-time monitoring of parameters such as the traveled
    distance and the number of half sweeps performed for each side. Download : Download

    have been carried out in a test field in Emilia-Romagna (latitude 44.570559, longitude
    11.533815) on August 2021 in the time frame 9:00-12:00. Temperature increased
    from 23° to 30° during the experiment, average humidity was 56%, wind was modest
    at about with south-east direction. The field width is about and its length about
    , corresponding to an usable agricultural surface of about . The plot was completely
    bare at the time of the experiment, since the crop had been harvested days before.
    Fig. 6 shows the plot overlaid with a schema of the actuators and water catch
    cans positions. Fig. 6 also displays a prescribed water application depth map,
    enhanced to highlight the difference between right and left sub-sectors. The different
    amounts of water prescribed have been chosen to stimulate the dynamics of the
    irrigation system and are not directly verifiable in the water catch cans due
    to the short transitions between sectors. An overall picture of the water catch
    cans distribution is given in Fig. 7. In farming practice, sprinkler irrigation
    often starts with the rain gun placed at the opposite side of the field and oriented
    toward the hose reel to supply water inside the field. After a sufficient area
    has been covered, the rain gun orientation is set to the standard side as represented
    in Fig. 6. The experiment avoided this maneuver, since the goal was to verify
    the correct variability in the general sprinkling of the water, without multi-phase
    operations. Indeed, the experiment considered only the first of the plot, just
    behind the initial position of the rain gun. The sprinkler model described in
    Section 3 has been adopted to program the irrigation behavior of the system. Some
    simplifications have been applied to match the constraints given by the available
    equipment, chiefly the need to program a fixed retraction speed of the towing
    machine during irrigation. Download : Download high-res image (648KB) Download

    Close-up of one of the cans. In the experiment, the sprinkler has been configured
    to supply an average water application depth of 15 mm across the whole field.
    As we have chosen to execute irrigation with constant rotation speed, the different
    prescribed water volumes are achieved by varying the number of times the rain
    gun irrigates each sub-sector. The rotation speed has been set to about ( to complete
    ). Global start and end angles have been set at and , where the reference angle
    0° corresponds to the center line in the direction opposite to the towed trolley.
    Beside the crosswise partition into left and right halves ( wide), the field has
    also been divided lengthwise into longitudinal sectors as listed in Table 2 and
    shown in Fig. 8. Sectors and have been added to stress the irrigation plan by
    completely avoiding water supply respectively on their left and right sides. The
    target of variable rate irrigation has been expressed by means of the right-to-left
    (R-L) ratio, i.e. the ratio of the sprinkler half-sweeps on the right and the
    left sub-sectors. Target R-L ratios of sectors and have been set to 1.25 and 0.7,
    respectively, but due to quantization the planner computed the values reported
    in Table 2. Table 2. Irrigation sectors: approximate length, number of half-sweeps

    the operating pressure measured at the hose reel machine was approximately whereas
    the average flow rate was about . Considering the average water need of 15 mm,
    the retraction speed of the rain gun was set to (about ). The initial position
    of the Elektrorain was about away from the hose reel, reaching approximately the
    beginning of the plot. The range of the sprinkler jet was empirically estimated
    as about . Fig. 8 shows the data flow required to obtain an irrigation prescription
    map, which is then translated into an operational plan for the available irrigation
    equipment. Download : Download high-res image (335KB) Download : Download full-size

    DSS (a). Using some pre-set parameters (b), based on the characteristics of the
    irrigation system and of the experiment, an operational irrigation map is computed
    (c). From the map, an operational plan (d) is derived, which is implemented by
    the control application and updated based on the feedback (e) of the actuators.
    6.3. Results The irrigation plan was executed as previously described. About halfway
    of the pull (namely, after the gun had traveled the distance of ) the system accomplished
    a change in the water applied (due to the change of sector). Fig. 9 shows the
    values of sprinkler orientation angle corresponding to the traveled path and the
    elapsed time from the initial configuration. The number of half sweeps of the
    rain gun was computed by the planning system and commanded in real-time to the
    sprinkler controller to achieve the desired balance of irrigation between the
    left and right sectors. The simulation model described in Section 5 has been used
    to compute the expected irrigation output. Fig. 10 shows the water quantities
    predicted by simulation for each squared portion of the field. The water quantity
    per sub-sector tends to be slightly overestimated, but it is proportional to the
    supplied water. Download : Download high-res image (456KB) Download : Download

    simulated irrigation using the proposed irrigation model. The resolution of the
    simulated field is . The proposed planning strategy delivers different average
    amount of water to left and right sectors under the assumption of indefinite longitudinal
    length of sectors. A catch can measures the amount of delivered water in a given
    point and collects the overall contribution every time the beam from sprinkler
    rain gun is directed toward the container. If there are no transitions between
    longitudinal sectors with different target values, the amount of water collected
    by the can corresponds to the desired average value for the sector. Otherwise,
    the collected amount depends on the contributions of multiple sectors. Fig. 11
    reports the water application depths collected in the water catch cans during
    the experiment, comparing these values with the expected ones. The collected amount
    of water generally increases from central catch cans (number 3, 4, 9 and 10) to
    the external ones (number 1, 6, 7 and 12), with the exception of the cans in the
    final row. This distribution is also discernible in the simulation results in
    Fig. 10. Histograms in Fig. 11 also provide the average depth of each left and
    right half-row of catch cans for comparison with the expected value of the corresponding
    sector. Water catch cans numbered from 1 to 6 predominantly received water from
    sprinkler in sector 1 and partially from sectors 2 and 3. Their measured water
    depths are close to the expected left and right values, in spite of the transitions
    between sectors 1 and 2 and between sectors 2 and 3. Water catch cans 7–12 predominantly
    received water from sprinkler in sector 3, without longitudinal transitions. Hence,
    their measured depths fairly accurately agree with prescribed left and right average
    depths, with a maximum error of about 1 mm. Finally, water catch cans numbered
    from 13 to 18 collected a lower quantity of water (about half of the target values),
    due to the fact that irrigation was interrupted a few minutes after the trolley
    had reached the hose reel. However, a partial effect of the longitudinal transition
    between sectors 3 and 4 can be observed in the lower values measured in catch
    cans 16–18 with respect to catch cans 13–15. In standard practice, irrigation
    is continued until the desired quantity of water is reached, even if retraction
    is complete and retraction speed is zero. As a general remark, the measured application
    depths values are consistent with the target values when the longitudinal dimension
    of field sectors is not less than the rain gun range and, thus, there are smooth
    longitudinal transitions. Download : Download high-res image (407KB) Download

    irrigation. 7. Conclusions This paper has reported a method to enable differential
    irrigation using software-controlled rain gun sprinklers, which can therefore
    be included among the equipment suitable for advanced VRI application. The proposed
    irrigation planning algorithm can differentiate the average water application
    depths supplied to transverse and longitudinal partitions of the field. A field
    experiment has shown that the application depths measured in specific positions
    after irrigation are consistent with the expected ones for the sector, under the
    hypothesis of uniform sprinkler irrigation for the sector and limited longitudinal
    transitions. Bringing differential irrigation capabilities to rain gun sprinklers,
    as proposed in this paper, expands the potential application of VRI, which can
    lead to major savings of water through the execution of prescription maps consistent
    with local requirements of the crop (Evans et al., 2020, O’Shaughnessy et al.,
    2015, O’Shaughnessy et al., 2019). The applicability of the reported planning
    algorithm is not bound to the specific machine used, as the underlying model abstracts
    the technological characteristics common to most rain gun sprinklers. Indeed,
    the algorithm does not imply particularly advanced machines, requiring only features
    such as the control of rotation to carry out the differential irrigation. In future
    work, we expect to achieve complete VRI capabilities for rain gun sprinklers through
    the integration of the towing hose reel into the controlled system, in order to
    exploit the potential of both machines. Furthermore, we plan to extend the model
    to fully support automated planning of VRI with other linear sprinkling systems
    such as advanced spray booms (e.g. wing-type booms) and with pivot irrigation
    systems. CRediT authorship contribution statement Gabriele Penzotti: Conceptualization,

- analysis: 'This paper addresses the importance of data volume, frequency, format,
    and source for precision irrigation systems. Using multiple linear regression
    (MLR) and random forest (RF) models, authors evaluate how these factors affect
    soil water infiltration spatial prediction accuracy in an arid flood plain. The
    study found that RF performed slightly better than MLR, with  infiltration rate
    predictions of 13.4 mm h-1 and 13.9 mm h-1 for RF and MLR respectively. Random
    forest also selected more covariates (n = 10) with channel networks, sand content,
    NDSI, elevation, and NDVI as the most important variables. This work demonstrates
    how data characteristics can be leveraged to improve soil water infiltration estimation
    and its potential implications for precision agriculture in drylands like Sistan

    **Strengths:**


    1. Addresses multiple data considerations (volume, frequency, format, source)
    for soil water infiltration estimation.

    2. Compares the performance of MLR and RF models for spatial prediction.

    3. Provides insights into the importance of environmental covariates for infiltration

  description: Knowledge of the spatial variation of soil infiltration is necessary
    for managing water conservation, salinity, and precision agriculture in drylands.
    In this study, the spatial variation of soil infiltration was investigated using
    digital soil mapping methods in the Sistan plain, an arid, low-relief flood plain
    in eastern Iran where a large irrigation project is being implemented to irrigate
    lands. Information about the spatial variation in soil infiltration will assist
    the planning of this irrigation project. 138 sampling locations were selected
    using stratified sampling based on existing polygon-based soil maps. Steady state
    soil infiltration was measured at each sampling location using the double ring
    infiltrometer method. Twenty-three environmental covariates were derived from
    digital elevation models and satellite imagery as well as predictive maps of clay,
    sand, and silt that were derived from kriging the collected soil samples. A simple
    (multiple linear regression) and a complex (random forests) model were used to
    link covariates and infiltration measurements. Ten-fold cross-validation was used
    to determine model accuracy. Measured soil infiltration ranged from 0.29 to 81.7
    mm h−1 with a mean of 13.6 mm h−1. RMSE of the infiltration rate predictions were
    13.4 mm h−1 for random forest and 13.9 mm h−1 for multiple linear regression.
    MAE was 10.5 for random forest and 10.9 for multiple linear regression. The most
    important covariates were channel networks, sand concentration, normalized difference
    salinity index (NDSI), and elevation in the random forest model and distance-from-river
    and sand concentration in the multiple linear regression model. Accuracy metrics
    for both models were comparable, but the random forest predictions were judged
    to be closer to reality based on visual review, thus random forests was chosen
    to make predictive maps of soil infiltration.

    1. Introduction Soil water infiltration has an important role in hydrologic processes.
    Knowledge of the amount and the spatial variation of soil water infiltration is
    important for environmental and agriculture management such as salinity, water
    conservation, and precision agriculture. This is particularly true in drylands
    where precipitation is limited and irrigation is required for agricultural production.
    Soil infiltration is fundamentally controlled by the size, distribution, and geometry
    of soil pore space. Soil pore space is affected by soil organic matter, soil texture,
    soil mineralogy, and bulk density. Land use and vegetation also affect soil infiltration
    (McGinty et al., 1978, Saito et al., 2016). Because the nature of soil pore space
    is highly spatially variable (Warrick and Nielsen, 1980, Sharma et al., 1987,
    Loague and Gander, 1990), the rate of infiltration is the most important feature
    of the infiltration and understanding the spatial distribution of soil infiltration
    is important for land management planning. Digital soil mapping (DSM) can be used
    to estimate the spatial variation of soil hydraulic properties such as soil water
    infiltration through linking these properties with environmental variables (McBratney
    et al., 2003) which are obtained from different sources such as remote sensing
    data, digital elevation models, geology maps, and legacy soil maps. Numerous models
    have been applied in digital soil mapping such as multiple linear regression (Nanni
    and Demattê, 2006, Saito et al., 2016, Thompson and Kolka, 2005, Guo et al., 2015),
    geostatistical methods (Lark et al., 2012, Orjuela-Matta et al., 2012), fuzzy
    logic (Londono et al., 2016), and Random forest (Hengl et al., 2015). Although
    many different models have been applied for DSM, simple models such as multiple
    linear regression (MLR) are attractive because their application is simple and
    the results can be easily interpreted (Zhang et al., 2017). For example, Saito
    et al. (2016) were able to interpret the relationship between infiltration and
    biomass and canopy coverage using simple linear regression. Lee et al. (2019)
    used MLR to predict the distribution of soil moisture in South Korea and obtained
    R2 between 0.16 and 0.6. Moraes et al. (2020) used MLR for predicting soil infiltration
    in Brazil and observed that including soil types, and physical and chemical properties
    as covariates increased the model accuracy. Nevertheless, because of the high
    spatial variability of soil hydraulic properties it may be that a complex model
    may be necessary for more accurate predictions. Additionally, complex models have
    been shown to be more accurate than simple models for predicting soil texture
    and organic matter; both of which are important influences on soil infiltration
    (Chagas et al., 2016, Zhang et al., 2017). A common, albeit complex model is random
    forests (Breiman, 2001). Random forest (RF) often has high prediction performance
    and has been demonstrated to accurately model the soil spatial distribution (Brungard
    et al., 2015). Sihang et al. (2019) used RF model for prediction of cumulative
    infiltration of soil and observed that RF had better performance than M5P tree
    model. Szabó et al. (2019) mapped soil hydraulic properties using RF model and
    topography, climate, parent material, vegetation and land use data in Hungary.
    Kumar and Sihang (2019) observed that RF model had more performance than adaptive
    neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model for predicting soil infiltration in
    India. Zeraatpisheh et al. (2019) showed that the RF had high accuracy for predicting
    calcium carbonate equivalent and soil organic carbon than other methods in Central
    Iran. Therefore, our objective was to test a simple model (multiple linear regression)
    and a complex model (random forests) for predicting the spatial variation of soil
    water infiltration. We test this objective by comparing the model performance,
    reviewing variable importance, and visually assessing the resulting predictions
    in an arid flood plain of eastern Iran. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study area
    The study was performed in the Sistan plain, Sistan and Baluchestan province,
    eastern Iran (Fig. 1). The Sistan plain is a low-relief, arid floodplain covering
    an area of approximately 227,000 ha. The lands of study area are irrigated by
    Hirman River which originates in Afghanistan. The Hirman River splits into two
    branches (the Sistan River and the Parian River) when it reaches the southern
    portion of the study area and ultimately ends in the Hamoun Wetlands in the north
    (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). The study area has an average slope of 1–2%. The elevation varies
    from 438 m to 515 m above sea level. Mean annual precipitation, mean annual temperature
    and mean annual evaporation are about 55 mm, 22 °C and 4,500 mm, respectively.
    Land cover includes farmlands, abandoned lands, saline lands, and sand dunes.
    Wind is a notable climatic phenomenon in this region which has a significant effect
    on the landscape and the lives of the basin’s inhabitants. The winds blow with
    a great regularity from May to mid-September and are locally called the “Wind
    of 120 Days”. Recently, the Iranian government has been implementing a large water
    pipeline system to irrigate agricultural lands in the Sistan plain to increase
    vegetation and reduce the effect of the 120 day winds. Therefore, soil infiltration
    information is needed for planning proper water management on these lands. Download

    2.2. Infiltration data Soil infiltration measurement sites were determined based
    on stratified sampling using exsisting polygon-based soil maps of the area (Soil
    institute of Iran., 1972, Soil institute of Iran, 1977, Ab va Khak Consulting
    Engineers, 1973). Measurements were performed at 138 sites (Fig. 2) with the double
    ring method. Outer and inner ring diameters were 60 cm and 30 cm, respectively.
    Rings were located at a depth of 10–15 cm from soil surface. Infiltration measurements
    were conducted at 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, and 180 min (Management
    and Planning Organization, No: 243). The soils were generally dry during the measurement
    period due to lack of precipitation during the study period. The Kostiakov (1932)
    equation was used to fit the measured infiltration data and steady-state infiltration
    rate was calculated. Steady-state infiltration rate (i.e., saturated hydraulic
    conductivity) was the variable that was predicted. Additionally, at each site,
    a soil sample was taken from 0 to 30 cm depth and the contents of clay, sand,
    and silt were measured with Hydrometer. 2.3. Environmental variables SAGA GIS
    software (Conrad et al., 2015) was used to derive seventeen covariates from a
    digital elevation model (DEM) with a spatial resolution of 23 m (Table 1). Most
    of the study area is irrigated using natural channels (Fig. 2) and this has an
    important role in alluvial areas (Al-Masrahy and Mountney, 2015), thus the channel
    network was included as a covariate. Euclidean distance from the main rivers in
    the area was prepared by ArcGIS 10.3 (Pahlavan-Rad and Akbarimoghadam, 2018).
    Clay, sand, and silt contents were predicted by kriging using the soil samples
    collected during field sampling and used as covariates (Fig. 3). Normalized difference
    vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference salinity index (NDSI) (Khan
    et al., 2005) were calculated from IRS Resourcesat-1 LISS IV image acquired on
    May 28, 2005. All 23 covariates were resampled to a 25 m spatial resolution. Table

    soil in the study area. 2.4. Predictive modeling and evaluation Multiple linear
    regression (MLR) and random forests (RF) were used to fit relationships between
    soil infiltration and environmental variables. MLR is a traditional method that
    predicts the values of each independent variable from predictor variables. MLR
    also determines the variable importance through correlation between infiltration
    and environmental variables. The RF model is an ensemble of regression trees,
    which constructs a multitude of regression trees and then aggregates them to provide
    a final prediction. Variable importance is also determined by RF model. Details
    on the RF model can be found in in Chagas et al. (2016). All covariates were used
    in modeling and important covariates were selected to get the lowest RMSE and
    MAE values for each model. All modeling was done using the “caret” package in
    R 3.2.5. Ten-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate model performance. The
    best model was selected based on the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) and
    the lowest mean absolute prediction error (MAE): where and are the predicted and
    observed soil infiltration, respectively, and N is the number of measurements.
    3. Results and discussion 3.1. Summary statistics for soil infiltration The mean
    measured soil water infiltration in the study area was 13.6 mm h−1 and ranged
    from 0.29 to 81.7 mm h−1 (Table 2). The highest rates were found near sand dunes
    and the lowest rates were found near the Hamoun Wetlands. This mean infiltration
    rate is low (Brouwer et al, 1985), which is likely because of massive structure,
    low soil organic matter (<1%), a Mg/Ca ratio greater than 1, and sodium on the
    exchange complex. Dontsova and Norton (2002) observed that Mg-treated soils had
    an infiltration about half those of Ca-treated soils. The standard deviation and
    variance were 14 mm h−1 and 197.1, respectively and demonstrate the high spatial
    variability of this property. Table 2. Summary statistics of soil infiltration
    values. n Min (mm h−1) Max (mm h−1) Mean (mm h−1) SD (mm h−1) Variance Kurtosis
    Skewness 138 0.29 81.7 13.6 14.0 197.1 4.74 1.91 3.2. Model evaluation The RMSE
    of the soil water infiltration rate predictions were 13.4 mm h−1 for random forest
    and 13.9 mm h−1 for multiple linear regression. MAE was 10.5 for random forest
    and 10.9 for multiple linear regression. These results suggest that RF performed
    slightly better than MLR. These results are in general agreement with the results
    of Chagas et al., 2016, Zhang et al., 2017 who observed that that RF was more
    accurate than MLR for predicting clay, sand, and soil organic carbon. However;
    these accuracy metrics are higher (i.e., less accurate) than those of Motaghian
    and Mohammadi (2009) who obtained a mean RMSE of 1.78–4.23 in mapping soil infiltration
    with different geostatistical methods in a smaller area (90 km3) in central Iran.
    Kumar and Sihang (2019) observed a RMSE of 13.5 mm/h with test data in modeling
    soil infiltration. Saito et al. (2016) observed an RMSE of 85.81 and 89.76 mm
    between cumulative infiltration with biomass and canopy coverage with MLR that
    are similar to our results. 3.3. Importance of environmental variables Fig. 4
    shows the importance of the environmental variables on the distribution of soil
    water infiltration for both models. Comparing relative variable importance plots
    in Fig. 4 reveals that RF selected more covariates (n = 10) than MLR (n = 4).
    In the RF model the most important variables were channel networks, sand, NDSI,
    elevation, and NDVI (Fig. 4). Channel networks were the most important variable
    for predicting the variation of infiltration using RF model. This is similar to
    Pahlavan-Rad and Akbarimoghadam (2018) who found that the channel networks were
    the second most important covariate for the prediction of soil properties in the
    Zahak County of this region. This result is also similar to Mirakzehi et al. (2018)
    who found that channel networks were the most important covariate for predicting
    soil classes across all taxonomic levels in another part of this region. Sand
    concentration was the second most important covariate in the RF model and may
    be explained by the influence of sand on infiltration; water moves more rapidly
    through the large pore spaces in sandy soils than the small pores of finer-textured
    soils. These results are similar to Londono et al. (2016) who found that soil
    infiltration rates were highest in soils with low drainage density and in sandy
    and sandy loam textures. In their study, the lands that had clay loam and loam-clay
    loam soil textures had very low infiltration potential. NDSI was the 3rd most
    important covariate. Soil salinity and alkalinity are common soil problems in
    this region and the causes of soil salinity and alkalinity also effect soil infiltration.
    Elevation was another important variable for predicting soil infiltration distribution
    in the study area. It influences infiltration distribution through regulating
    conditions for soil texture fractions deposition. NDVI was also an important variable
    for predicting soil infiltration distribution. Infiltration can be effected by
    vegetation cover and land use (Elhakeem et al., 2018, Liu et al., 2018) and NDVI
    represents vegetation and may also indicate land use types as this region relies
    on irrigation so differing NDVI values are likely to indicate differing land use.

    Fig. 4. Relative variable importance in multiple linear regression (A) and random
    forest (B) models. Distance from the river was the most important covariate and
    sand concentration was the second most important covariates in the MLR model (Fig.
    4). Pahlavan-Rad and Akbarimoghadam (2018) found distance from the river as the
    most important covariate for predicting soil texture fractions and pH in a part
    of the study area. Distance from the river and sand concentration are likely important
    variables because the Sistan region is a flood plain and therefore subject to
    current and historical flood events. The distance to the river likely influences
    the amount of overbank flood deposits which likely have different texture variations
    thus influencing variation in soil hydraulic properties. Szabó et al. (2019) observed
    that soil (soil type, clay, sand, silt and organic matter contents) was the most
    important covariate in predicting soil hydraulic properties using RF model. 3.4.
    Spatial predictions Fig. 5 shows the spatial predictions of soil infiltration
    rates predicted by both models and reveals large differences between the two predictions.
    Although the cross-validation accuracy metrics of the two models were similar,
    the RF predictions more closely matched our expected spatial pattern of soil infiltration
    in the study area (Fig. 5B). The MLR predictions appeared to overestimate infiltration
    in the study area (Fig. 5A). The mean infiltration rate was 13.6 mm h−1 in this
    study while the MLR predictions showed rates more than 13.6 mm h−1 in most of
    the area (Fig. 5A). Without independently validating these predictions it is impossible
    to determine with certainty which model is the most accurate, we chose the RF
    model as the ‘best’ because the cross-validation accuracy metrics were similar
    and spatial predictions appeared visually consistent with our understanding of
    the landscape. Download : Download high-res image (825KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 5. Spatial variations of soil infiltration (mm/h) with multiple
    linear regression (left, A) and random forest (right, B) in the study area. The
    RF infiltration rate predictions was similar to the distributions of sand and
    clay (Fig. 4) and were higher in the central, south, and southeast areas of the
    Sistan plain. These areas have higher elevations (Fig. 2) and higher sand contents
    because they are near the Sistan and Parian Rivers and sand dunes (Fig. 3A). Lower
    values of soil infiltration were predicted in the north, northeast, and northwest
    areas where clay content is highest. The lowest soil infiltration rates were predicted
    in the northeast where the highest clay contents are found in the study area (Fig.
    3A); surface soil texture in this part is mostly silty clay. 4. Conclusions We
    compared a simple (multiple linear regression) and a complex (random forest) model
    for predicting soil infiltration rates in a dry flood plain of eastern Iran. Although
    model evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAE) were similar between models, the RF predictions
    were more visually consistent with our expected distribution of infiltration in
    the study area and we chose RF as the optimal model. Soil infiltration predictions
    have a strong relationship with channel networks, sand content, distance from
    main river, Normalized Difference Salinity Index, elevation, and Normalized Difference
    Vegetation Index in the study area. Natural channel networks are an important
    covariate in the distribution of soil properties such as infiltration and texture.
    It is recommended to use RF and covariates related to water distribution for predicting
    soil infiltration in other flood plain areas. Drought, limited water for irrigation,
    salinity, and high evaporation rates are the main limitations to agriculture in
    the Sistan region of Iran, thus soil infiltration predictions have the potential
    to useful for mitigating or avoiding irrigation problems. Because the random forest
    model predicted relatively slow infiltration rates across much of the study area,
    future irrigation projects in the study area should be considered in the fall
    and winter seasons and water should be applied at night to avoid times when the
    evaporation is high. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that

    This mean infiltration rate is low (Brouwer et al., 1985), which is likely because

- analysis: 'Dynamic management zones (DMZ) account for the variability in water and
    nutrient needs of a field. Creating site-specific management plans for these zones
    allows for precision agriculture techniques such as variable rate irrigation.
    This optimization can improve crop performance and reduce environmental impact.


    This study introduces a methodology for delineating DMZs using Sentinel-2 NDVI
    time-series and soil moisture sensor measurements. The authors then use the Hydrus-1D
    model to test the in-season optimization of irrigation scheduling and water delivery
    management. The authors found that this integration of spatiotemporal crop and
    soil moisture data can be used to optimize irrigation scheduling, reducing water
    applications by up to 28.5 percent while increasing crop transpiration by up to
    53 percent.

  description: Irrigation scheduling decision-support tools can improve water use
    efficiency by matching irrigation recommendations to prevailing soil and crop
    conditions within a season. Yet, little research is available on how to support
    real-time precision irrigation that varies within-season in both time and space.
    We investigate the integration of remotely sensed NDVI time-series, soil moisture
    sensor measurements, and root zone simulation forecasts for in-season delineation
    of dynamic management zones (MZ) and for a variable rate irrigation scheduling
    in order to improve irrigation scheduling and crop performance. Delineation of
    MZ was conducted in a 5.8-ha maize field during 2018 using Sentinel-2 NDVI time-series
    and an unsupervised classification. The number and spatial extent of MZs changed
    through the growing season. A network of soil moisture sensors was used to interpret
    spatiotemporal changes of the NDVI. Soil water content was a significant contributor
    to changes in crop vigor across MZs through the growing season. Real-time cluster
    validity function analysis provided in-season evaluation of the MZ design. For
    example, the total within-MZ daily soil moisture relative variance decreased from
    85% (early vegetative stages) to below 25% (late reproductive stages). Finally,
    using the Hydrus-1D model, a workflow for in-season optimization of irrigation
    scheduling and water delivery management was tested. Data simulations indicated
    that crop transpiration could be optimized while reducing water applications between
    11 and 28.5% across the dynamic MZs. The proposed integration of spatiotemporal
    crop and soil moisture data can be used to support management decisions to effectively
    control outputs of crop × environment × management interactions.

    Highlights • We used Sentinel 2 NDVI time-series to delineate dynamic management
    zones (MZ). • Changes in MZ patterns were consistent with soil moisture spatiotemporal
    variability. • Data variance fragmentation was used for daily evaluation of the
    dynamic MZ designs. • Soil moisture data and model forecasts can be used to schedule
    MZ irrigation. Abstract Irrigation scheduling decision-support tools can improve
    water use efficiency by matching irrigation recommendations to prevailing soil
    and crop conditions within a season. Yet, little research is available on how
    to support real-time precision irrigation that varies within-season in both time
    and space. We investigate the integration of remotely sensed NDVI time-series,
    soil moisture sensor measurements, and root zone simulation forecasts for in-season
    delineation of dynamic management zones (MZ) and for a variable rate irrigation
    scheduling in order to improve irrigation scheduling and crop performance. Delineation
    of MZ was conducted in a 5.8-ha maize field during 2018 using Sentinel-2 NDVI
    time-series and an unsupervised classification. The number and spatial extent
    of MZs changed through the growing season. A network of soil moisture sensors
    was used to interpret spatiotemporal changes of the NDVI. Soil water content was
    a significant contributor to changes in crop vigor across MZs through the growing
    season. Real-time cluster validity function analysis provided in-season evaluation
    of the MZ design. For example, the total within-MZ daily soil moisture relative
    variance decreased from 85% (early vegetative stages) to below 25% (late reproductive
    stages). Finally, using the Hydrus-1D model, a workflow for in-season optimization
    of irrigation scheduling and water delivery management was tested. Data simulations
    indicated that crop transpiration could be optimized while reducing water applications
    between 11 and 28.5% across the dynamic MZs. The proposed integration of spatiotemporal
    crop and soil moisture data can be used to support management decisions to effectively
    control outputs of crop × environment × management interactions. Previous article

    agriculture is essential to global food production, especially because of projected
    population growth (Döll, 2002). Irrigation water is commonly applied uniformly
    over an entire field. Yet, field soil water content is typically non-uniform because
    of spatial variability in soil hydraulic properties (Hawley, 1983), topography
    (Burt and Butcher, 1985), and vegetation growth (Le Roux et al., 1995). When field
    spatial variability is significant (Baveye and Laba, 2014; Thorp, 2019), differential
    irrigation water management that accounts for variability may improve the cost-effectiveness
    of irrigation (Liang et al., 2016; Martini et al., 2017) by increasing for instance
    water use efficiency and productivity as well as decreasing nutrient leaching.
    Precision agriculture seeks to optimize farming operations via site-specific management
    plans that vary the application of nutrients and water across a field based on
    variations in soil and crop conditions (Zhang et al., 2002). Field management
    is prescribed over contiguous areas that have homogeneous soil properties and
    crop conditions. These areas are called management zones (MZ). Different clustering
    methods, including k-mean, ISODATA, and Gaussian Mixture, are available for delineating
    MZs based on different data sources (Galambošová et al., 2014; Martinez-Casasnovas
    et al., 2012; Schepers et al., 2004). Commonly, yield maps, topography, remote
    sensing data, and soil apparent electrical conductivity are used to delineate
    MZs (Bellvert et al. 2012, Liu et al., 2018; Scudiero et al., 2018; Ohana-levi
    et al., 2019). Recently, open access or low cost remote sensing data are being
    used in agriculture to obtain spatiotemporal information on biophysical parameters
    of vegetation (Fontanet et al., 2018). Several researchers have defined MZs in
    specific fields with the goal of increasing yield and decreasing water use. Inman
    et al. (2008) and Schenatto et al. (2015) used NDVI and other spectral vegetation
    indices to delineate MZs with NDVI data and different crop indices. Liu et al.
    (2018) delineated MZs based on yield and maps of different vegetation indices.
    Scudiero et al. (2013) argued that spatial information of soil properties known
    to affect plant growth should guide MZ delineation. They modeled maize yield spatial
    variability as a function of salinity, texture, carbon content and bulk density,
    using geospatial apparent soil electrical conductivity and bare soil reflectance
    measurements as proxies for these soil properties. A similar study was presented
    by Reyes et al. (2019), in which MZs were defined using information of both NDVI
    and soil properties. Georgi et al. (2018) developed an algorithm to delineate
    MZs automatically based on remote sensing data. However, one of the disadvantages
    of this algorithm is that it does not work properly in fields with strong time-dependent
    spatial patterns. All the above-mentioned studies consider MZs to be static and
    assume no dynamic pattern during the growing season. However, in fields where
    crop spatial patterns change over time, some researchers have advocated for MZ
    delineation to also be dynamic (Cohen et al., 2016; Evans et al., 2013; Haghverdi
    et al., 2015; Scudiero et al., 2018). Soil moisture sensors constitute a vital
    tool for real-time monitoring of soil water content dynamics in the field. Although
    sensors monitor soil water content at a single point, spatial and temporal variations
    of soil water content and their interactions with crops can be analyzed if several
    sensors are installed across the field (Biswas, 2014; Biswas and Si, 2011; Huang
    et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2016). These measurements can provide information about
    the source of variability between different MZs and aid in their delineation.
    In this study, we integrate crop spatial and temporal information from high-resolution
    remote sensing, soil water sensor data, and numerical model simulations to investigate
    irrigation scheduling for dynamic management zones. Specifically, we: i.) characterize
    the spatial and temporal dynamics of crop-soil-water relations of a maize field,
    ii.) delineate and evaluate temporally dynamic management zones for variable rate
    irrigation, and iii.) provide a workflow for in-season optimization of irrigation
    scheduling and water delivery management. 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1. Study
    Site The study was carried out in a 5.8-ha maize (Zea mays L.) field located in
    Raïmat (Lleida, Spain) (Fig. 1). The study region has a typical semi-arid Mediterranean
    climate, with an average summer temperature and rainfall of 24 °C and 45 mm. The
    local climate was Mediterranean, with an average annual rainfall and reference
    evapotranspiration ( of 341 mm and 1.060 m, respectively. Download : Download

    location, soil moisture station locations, and maize variety plantings. The blue
    area represents maize variety p0937 (a combination of 500 and 600 series), the
    red area is variety d6980 (700 series), the yellow area is p1524 (700 series),
    and the green area is d6780 (600 series). Land use at the study site has changed
    over the years (Fig. A.1 of Appendix A). Originally, the site was a forest where
    no tillage occurred. Approximately 30 years ago, the land was converted to a vineyard.
    The topography of the field was modified, with soil being added or removed in
    various sections, such that the site can now be regarded as having an anthropogenic
    soil. In 2016, two years year before this study, grapevines were removed and maize
    was grown at the site. 2.2. Sowing and Irrigation All agronomic management and
    design at the field site was implemented by cooperators without our input. The
    field was sectioned into four plots that were each sowed with a different maize
    variety (Fig. 1). The varieties were, from west to east: p0937 (DuPont Pioneer,
    Johnston, IA), d6980 (DEKALB Genetics Corporation, Dekalb, IL), p1524 (DuPont
    Pioneer), and d6780 (DEKALB). All plots were sown on May 3, 2018, at a sowing
    density of 90000 seeds·ha-1. Plants started to emerge on May 12, 2018. Data from
    the seed companies indicated that the varieties sowed on the west and east edges
    (p0937 and d6780) had a faster vegetative growth than d6980 and p1524. However,
    all varieties were anticipated to reach full maturity between 125 to165 days after
    sowing. All the varieties were harvested on September 22, 2018. The field was
    irrigated with a solid set sprinkler system (Nelson Irrigation Corporation, Walla
    Walla, WA), with sprinklers located at a 15 x 15 m spacing. Water was delivered
    at a rate of 6.5 L m-2 h-1. Irrigation was uniformly applied over the field with
    scheduling and depths determined using a crop coefficient approach (FAO56). For
    most of the site, irrigation ended 115 days after sowing. But, in two 0.3-ha sections
    at the north-east end of the site, irrigation was halted 74 days after sowing
    due to soil waterlogging. 2.3. Soil, Environment, and Crop Measurements Field
    data were collected between May and September 2018. Soil moisture, soil and crop
    parameters, environmental variables, and NDVI time-series were measured. In May
    2018, 33 capacitive EC-5 soil moisture sensors (METER Group, Pullman, WA, USA)
    were installed at 11 locations named P1, P2, …, and P11 (Fig. 1). The sensors
    were installed at 15, 35, and 50 cm depths. Water content data were registered
    every 30 minutes using an EM5b data logger (METER Group). The manufacturer’s generic
    sensor calibration was used, which has a reported accuracy ± 0.03 cm3 cm−3 (Campbell
    and Devices, 1986) At each soil moisture station, three disturbed soil samples
    were collected at 0-5, 5-35, and 30-60 cm depth for organic matter (OM) and soil
    texture analyses. The Walkley-Black method was used to measure OM (Nelson and
    Sommers, 1996), whereas soil particle size distribution was measured according
    to the hydrometer method (Gee and Bauder, 1986). Particles were categorized into
    the following size classes: clay (soil particle diameter, D < 0.002 mm), fine
    silt (0.002 < D < 0.02 mm), coarse silt (0.02 < D < 0.05 mm) and sand (0.05 <
    D < 2 mm). Undisturbed soil cores were also collected at the same locations and
    depths for measuring soil hydraulic properties. Saturated hydraulic conductivity
    was measured with a KSat device (METER Group). Soil water retention measurements
    were obtained using Hyprop and WP4C instruments (METER Group). The Hyprop device
    utilizes an evaporation method (Schelle et al., 2013) and was used to obtain retention
    data from 0 to −85 kPa, whereas the WP4C device implements a chilled mirror dew
    point technique and was used to obtain measurements down to −300 MPa. The van
    Genuchten equations (van Genuchten, 1980v) were used to model the retention data
    and the soil unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. In the van Genuchten model, the
    Ks parameter was set to the saturated conductivity measured with the KSat device,
    the saturated water content parameter ( ) was set to the soil porosity estimated
    by the Hyprop device, and the residual water content parameter ( ) was set to
    the minimum water content recorded by the WP4C device. The van Genuchten shape
    parameters and were determined by fitting the model retention function to the
    measured data using the RETC software package (van Genuchten et al., 1991v). Principal
    component analysis (PCA) (Abdi and Williams, 2013; Martini et al., 2017) was used
    to investigate the relationships between soil texture, OM, bulk density, and hydraulic
    parameters. The PCA calculations were done with Statistica 12 (StatSoft Inc. Tulsa,
    OK, USA). A weather station consisting of an ECRN-100 rain gauge (METER Group),
    a cup anemometer (Davis Instruments, Hayward, CA, USA), and PYR pyranometer and
    VP-4 relative humidity and temperature sensors (METER Group) was installed 150
    m from the north-east corner of the field. The measured temperature, wind speed,
    relative humidity, and solar radiation were used to calculate daily reference
    evapotranspiration ( ) using the Penman Monteith equation as specified in FAO
    Irrigation and Drainage Paper No. 56 (Allen et al, 1998; hereafter “FAO56”). The
    estimated was converted into daily water requirements or potential evapotranspiration
    ( ) using the maize crop coefficient ( ) from FAO56. Maximum and minimum daily
    temperature measurements were used to calculate growing degree days (GDD) according
    to FAO56 and to determinate reference maize growing stages (Ritchie et al., 1997).
    Remote sensing data obtained from Sentinel 2 were used to determine normalized
    difference vegetation index ( ) Eq. (1) (Rouse et al., 1974), (1) where and are
    measured reflectance values in the near-infrared and visible red regions, respectively.
    was used to evaluate spatial variability in the field. Remote sensing data were
    downloaded with 10-m spatial resolution every 5 days unless there was cloud coverage.
    The first and last images downloaded were the 15th and 135th day after sowing.
    Remote sensing data were downloaded from Google Earth Engine web page (https://earthengine.google.com).
    2.4. Management Zones Delineation NDVI was used to characterize the spatial variability
    of crop vigor through the growing season. A k-means (also known as “fuzzy c-means”)
    unsupervised clustering algorithm (Odeh et al., 2010) was used to classify the
    NDVI data into temporally dynamic MZs. The Grouping Analysis tool in ArcMap 10.4.1
    (ESRI, Redlands, CA) was used for the MZ delineation. Anytime a new Sentinel 2
    NDVI scene was available at the site, a new MZ scheme was delineated. Designs
    having 2 to 6 MZs were considered. The Calinski–Harabasz criterion ( ) (Harabasz
    et al., 1974), Eq. (2), was used to evaluate the clusters and MZ delineations
    and select the optimum number of MZs. The CHC, also known as a pseudo F-statistic,
    measures the ratio of between-MZ differences and within-MZ similarity. It is formulated
    as: (2) where is the number of pixels, is the number of considered zones, is the
    between-zones sum of squares, and is the within-zone sum of squares. Large values
    indicate high within-MZ homogeneity and between-MZ heterogeneity. The averages
    and maximum and minimum values within each MZ were calculated for further comparison
    between different MZs. MZs were not defined for the beginning of the season (0-20
    day after sowing) because plants had not yet germinated or were not big enough
    to influence , and for the end of the season (beyond 130 days after sowing) because
    in that period the crop is in a late phenological stage and not irrigated. Differences
    in soil properties across MZs over time were assessed using a Kruskal-Wallis (Kruskal
    and Wallis, 1952) rank test (i.e., a non-parametric analysis of variance), calculated
    with Statistica 12. Additionally, we considered an alternative static delineation
    scheme, subdividing the site into four contiguous fields corresponding to the
    planted maize varieties. The was calculated for each available scene to compare
    the variety-based MZ approach to the dynamic -based MZ delineation. 2.5. Management
    Zone Available Water Soil-water status for the MZs was modeled as plant available
    water ( ) Eq. (3) (Liang et al., 2016; Vellidis et al., 2016; Zurweller et al.,
    2019): (3) where is the profile average available water at monitoring station
    and time , indexes the measurement depths, (cm) is the depth increment associated
    with the moisture sensor at depth , (cm) is the total soil profile depth, (cm3
    cm-3) is soil water content, (cm3 cm-3) is the wilting point (water content at
    −1500 kPa), and (cm3 cm-3) is field capacity (determined using the simulated soil
    drainage method of Twarakavi et al. (2009)). The for a MZ was defined to be the
    average for all monitoring stations located within the MZ. Note that the MZ design
    changed over the growing season, so the MZ membership of some stations also changed.
    In addition to the calculation on the data, the spatiotemporal variability of
    was also used for in-season evaluation of the dynamic MZ-design. Following Fraisse
    et al. (2001), we calculated the daily weighted within-MZ variance (4), (4) where
    is the daily weighted variance within management zone i; j indicates the monitoring
    stations within management zone i; k indicates the measurement times during the
    current day; is the number of stations in management zone i; is the total number
    of stations in the field; is the number of measurements per day (every 30 min),
    is defined by (3), and is the average profile AW across monitoring stations in
    management zone i and measurement times in the current day. The total within-zone
    variance is equal to the sum of the weighted within-zone variances, . By comparing
    with the total daily field-wide variance, it is possible to determine how much
    was gained in terms of AW uniformity by dividing the field into MZs (Fraisse et
    al., 2001). 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 3.1. Soil Properties Soil texture, organic
    matter (OM) content and bulk density ( ) values measured at each station are reported
    in Table 1. The soil texture classes (USDA system) of samples taken from the 11
    locations were clay loam (42.4% of samples), loam (42.4%), and silty clay loam
    (15.2%). Locations on the east side (P1, P6, P7, P11) of the field had, on average,
    lower sand and higher silt and clay contents than those on the west side. Average
    OM contents ranged between 0.57 and 1.96 %, which is typical for agricultural
    soils in this region (Romanyà and Rovira, 2011). Fitted and measured parameters
    for the soil hydraulic properties at each station are reported in Table 2. Consistent
    with the spatial trend in soil texture noted previously, the SWRCs measured on
    the east side of the study site (stations P1, P6, P7, P11) had lower fitted n
    values than in the rest of the site. On the wet end of a retention curve, a lower
    n value corresponds to a more gradual transition in water content as pressure
    head changes. Fig. A.2 of Appendix A compares SWRCs observed at the locations
    on the west (P9) and east (P11) sides of the field. Table 1. Soil samples texture,

    11.00 0.350 0.250 The principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that eight
    principal components were needed to explain 95% of the variability in the soil
    dataset. The first three components, PC1 (30.9%), PC2 (18.6%), and PC3 (15.9%),
    explained around two thirds of the variance in the soil dataset. Particularly,
    PC1 indicated that clay content clustered (was positively correlated) with θwp,
    θfc, and α. The PC1 also indicated that clay content was negatively correlated
    with sand content, θr, and n. Further detail about PC1, PC2, and PC3 are reported
    in Fig. A.3 of Appendix A. 3.2. Remote Sensing and Dynamic Management Zones Delineation
    The site average, minimum, and maximum values for each available Sentinel 2 scene
    are reported in Fig. 2a. Changes in averaged generally corresponded to the evolution
    of at the site, consistent with reports for maize grown in Mediterranean climates
    in other studies (Segovia-Cardozo et al., 2019; Toureiro et al., 2017). Fig. 2b
    shows that cumulative input water (irrigation and precipitation) (618 mm) exceeded
    by 10.2% the site-wide cumulative (561 mm). At the bottom of Fig. 2, reference
    growing stages for maize at the site are shown (Ritchie et al., 1997). Varieties
    needed between 120 and 130 days to reach maturity. Thus, we considered the reference
    growing stages to be representative for all maize varieties grown at the site.
    and were low during the early vegetative stages, had maximum values during the
    late vegetative stage (VT) through the beginning of the reproductive stages (R1-R6),
    then decreased after R6. The temporal changes of at the site are comparable to
    those observed in other studies on maize (Viña et al., 2004). In the early vegetative
    stages (V0 to V5), the range of each Sentinel 2 scene was narrow. In later vegetative
    stages and early reproductive stages, the ranges were much larger, indicating
    considerable variability in crop status (greenness, health) at the site. Download

    3a shows the spatiotemporal changes of at the sites. Areas with high and low were
    observed at the site throughout the growing season. However, the spatial patterns
    changed over time, suggesting that homogeneous or static site-specific irrigation
    management may be inadequate to address crop needs over time at this site. Fig.
    3b shows the dynamic MZ delineation obtained with unsupervised clustering of the
    data. The number of MZ and its spatial distribution changed throughout the growing
    season. At the beginning of the season, until 50 days after sowing, it seems that
    the optimal number of homogeneous MZ was three. The MZ1 covered the north-west
    side of the site and had the highest values; the MZ2 had intermediate and spanned
    across the south of the site until the 45th day after sowing and after that over
    the south-west only. The MZ3 had lower values and was initially the north-eastern
    side of the site, then covered the entire western side of the field at 45 days
    after sowing. From the 50th day after sowing, the indicated that four clusters
    were best at identifying areas with homogeneous . MZ1 and MZ2 remained relatively
    similar to their early season delineations. The MZ4 identified an area of moderately
    low at the south-eastern portion of the site, whereas MZ3, on the north-eastern
    side of the site, was characterized by the lowest values. The spatial patterns
    of the four MZs changed only slightly over time, until the 130th day after sowing,
    when the size of MZ3 increased remarkably while MZ4 decreased. The unsupervised
    clustering was compared to dividing the site into four blocks, one for each maize
    variety. Fig. 3c shows the values for clustering into dynamic MZ and into varietal-based
    blocks through the growing season. The dynamic MZ-design strategy had larger values
    for the entire growing season than the variety-block strategy, indicating that
    the dynamic MZs identified by unsupervised clustering had more homogeneous than
    the varietal blocks. Download : Download high-res image (514KB) Download : Download

    between the eastern and western side of the field, especially visible along the
    boundary between the d6980 and p1524 varieties. The boundary between the d6980
    and p1524 varieties seemed to be a big factor in the determination of the boundary
    between eastern (MZ1 and MZ2) and western (MZ3 and MZ4) zones from 55 to 120 days
    after sowing (Fig. 3b). Fig. A.1.f of Appendix A shows the p1524 and d6780 varieties
    doing relatively poorly in July 2018. Therefore, in addition to different soil
    hydraulic properties on the east side of the field, crop genetics (e.g., pest
    resistance, germination rate between the varieties) and uneven management (e.g.,
    mechanical sowing, fertilization, soil tillage) could have been contributing factors
    to the poor performance of the p1524 and d6780 varieties. Changes in MZ delineation
    over time led to some changes in MZ membership for certain soil-water monitoring
    stations (Table 3). These changes occurred frequently in the early vegetative
    stages (until 54 days after sowing). No MZ membership change occurred in the late
    vegetative and reproductive stages. The MZs were characterized by contrasting
    soil properties throughout the season. The MZ had significantly (p < 0.05) different
    PC1 scores throughout the season according to the Kruskal Wallis test: MZ1 and
    MZ2 were characterized by low PC1 scores, whereas MZ3 and MZ4 were characterized
    by the highest PC1 scores (Fig. A.3 of Appendix A). Table 3. Periods where one

    Water Applied Changes in and across MZs are depicted in Fig. 4a (MZ1), 4b (MZ2),
    4c (MZ3), and 4d (MZ4). Through the growing season, in MZ1 and MZ2 was higher
    than in MZ3 and MZ4. Furthermore, was slightly higher in MZ1 than in MZ2. Average
    in MZ1 was close to 1 (i.e., water content was near θfc) throughout the entire
    growing season. Average in MZ2 was greater than 1 at the beginning of the season
    (until 45 days after sowing) and then very close to 1 through the end of the growing
    season. Portions of MZ3 and MZ4 had lower values than MZ1 and MZ2. In these areas,
    irrigation was likely excessive. was considerably higher than 1 for the entire
    vegetative growth of maize and during the early reproductive stages. Once irrigation
    was halted in the northeastern corner of the site (i.e., approximately over the
    area comprised by MZ3) at 74 days after sowing, the in MZ3 gradually decreased
    until the end of the season, while in MZ3 remained stable. Halting irrigation
    in the northeastern corner of the site had little-to-no effect on the spatial
    extent of MZ3 and the other MZs, as shown in Fig. 3b. The analysis of the daily
    total within-MZ variance ( ) provided further support for the use of to identify
    areas with similar conditions at the site. In Fig. 4e, the calculated total MZ
    variance is normalized by the daily whole-site variance. Especially beyond 45
    days after sowing (the beginning of the VT growth stage), the normalized within-MZ
    variance is much less than 1, showing that a large part of the total variance
    was explained by splitting the site into dynamic MZs delineated based on an analysis
    of . Fraisse et al. (2001) used yield within-zone variance to evaluate soil-derived
    MZs at the end of the season. Our results suggest that daily could also be used
    for in-season evaluation of management zone designs. Download : Download high-res

    vegetative growth, and several studies have found positive correlations between
    , , and canopy vigor in different crops (Scudiero et al., 2014; West et al., 2018).
    However, those studies were for water scarce conditions. It is well known that
    crop water stress and reductions in canopy growth can occur due to either deficit
    of water or excess of water (Feddes et al., 1978). In the current study, where
    maize was grown under nearly waterlogged conditions for most of the growing season
    (Fig. 4), changes in and between consecutive Sentinel 2 scenes were negatively
    correlated, with Pearson r equal to -0.64 (MZ1), -0.87 (MZ2), -0.79 (MZ3), and
    -0.83 (MZ4) (all significant at p < 0.05). Thus, as reported in previous studies
    (Long et al., 2015; Quebrajo et al., 2018; Scudiero et al., 2018; Shanahan et
    al., 2008), data alone should not be used to make irrigation management decisions;
    (and/or other plant canopy information) should be integrated with soil information
    to properly understand plant processes at a site. 3.4. Irrigation Scheduling Simulations
    With respect to within-season management decisions, one way to make a connection
    between -based dynamic management zone delineation and soil conditions would be
    to use a simulation model to make within-season forecasts of soil and crop conditions
    for different management options. Several authors have simulated different irrigation
    strategies, for different purposes, in order to define the most appropriate irrigation
    strategy (Autovino et al., 2018; Haj-Amor and Bouri, 2020; Sakaguchi et al., 2019).
    In the remainder of this paper, we determine a hypothetical optimal irrigation
    schedule for each growing stage using the simulation/optimization approach developed
    by Fontanet (2019).We first show that a physically based simulation model, Hydrus-1D
    (Šimůnek et al., 2016), is consistent with NDVI-based zoning by simulating the
    field experiment and demonstrating agreement between measured AW and simulated
    available water ( , as well as showing a correspondence between simulated transpiration
    ( ) rates and . Next, we use the calibrated model to investigate what-if irrigation
    scenarios, calculating a hypothetical irrigation scheduling table for each dynamic
    MZ that could have been generated from NDVI within season to guide irrigation.
    3.4.1. Hydrus 1-D available water and transpiration simulations The well-known
    Hydrus-1D model solves the Richards Equation numerically to simulate variably
    saturated water flow and root water uptake in soils. The model inputs and parameterizations
    used in our simulations are detailed in Appendix B. Simulations of the experiment
    for differing monitoring locations all used the same inputs and parameters except
    for (i.) the soil hydraulic properties, which were measured at each station during
    the field campaign (Table 2), and (ii.) the irrigation boundary condition, which
    differed only for stations P10 and P11 because irrigation was stopped during the
    experiment. In Fig. 5, daily observed for each station is compared with daily-simulated
    available water ( . Generally good agreement between and existed for all stations,
    although it is acknowledged that the time courses were relatively non-dynamic.
    Still, the simulations were done using independently measured hydraulic properties
    and without any calibration, so the agreement is quite good (modeling details
    can be found in Appendix B). Missing data towards the end of the season in P7
    was due to rodents chewing on the sensor cables. Download : Download high-res

    available water (SAW) at each station (P1 - P11). Fig. 6 shows the weekly-simulated
    actual transpiration ( at each MZ and the potential transpiration ( ) at the site.
    At MZ1 and MZ2, weekly averages were always equal or near the potential transpiration.
    At MZ3 and MZ4, weekly values were remarkably lower than the potential. There
    was good correspondence between and at each MZ, with a Pearson r of 0.6 (MZ1),
    0.51 (MZ2), 0.69 (MZ3), and 0.82 (MZ4). In agreement with the results discussed
    for and AW data (section 3.2. Remote Sensing and Dynamic Management Zones Delineation),
    low values at MZ3 and MZ4 were due to waterlogging (root water uptake and transpiration
    is reduced in the model whenever simulated soil water content exceeds a threshold
    value; see Appendix B). Stations in MZ3 and MZ4 (see Table 3) had and over 1 for
    most of the growing season (Fig. 4). Download : Download high-res image (143KB)

    scheduling for within-season decision making We adopted the method of Fontanet
    (2019) to investigate optimal irrigation scheduling for dynamic MZs In this method,
    irrigation of duration [T] is prescribed whenever the soil moisture content decreases
    below a critical threshold level ( ) as indicated by readings from a soil water
    pressure head sensor(s). The irrigation rate is assumed to be a fixed constant
    for a given irrigation system. The recommended duration and threshold are determined
    using a simulation/optimization procedure. Simulations are made using forecasted
    daily or weekly crop water demand (reference ET0) and a range of values for the
    irrigation scheduling parameters, and . The optimal parameter values are those
    that maximize seasonal transpiration in the simulations (transpiration being,
    for many agronomically important crops, proportional to marketable yield). In
    adapting the simulation/optimization method, we make separate recommendations
    for each MZ, and update them whenever there is a change in MZ station membership.
    The recommended values of and for a given MZ are the average values determined
    for monitoring stations within the zone. For simplicity, we use in this example
    the known daily potential ET0 for the forecasted model boundary condition (rather
    than historical data which would be necessary for actual within-season forecasts).
    Haghverdi et al. (2015) and Liang et al. (2016) proposed calculating crop water
    requirements as a function of root growth since the soil depth to refill increases
    as roots grow deeper. Similarly, in our simulations, we triggered irrigation based
    on readings from progressively deeper sensors as the season progressed. In principle,
    when multiple sensor depths are available, the sensor depth could be treated as
    an additional optimization parameter. Full details on our implementation of the
    Fontanet (2019) procedure are given in Appendix C. Although the Fontanet (2019)
    method prescribes an optimized irrigation schedule, in practice a grower may not
    be able to irrigate exactly according to a schedule and sensor readings, particularly
    when there are multiple management zones. Therefore, we also calculated recommended
    irrigation durations (or, equivalently, irrigation amounts) for soils that have
    become dryer than the “optimal” irrigation trigger point. The resulting irrigation
    scheduling calendar for dynamic-MZ irrigation is presented in Table 4. Optimal
    irrigation strategies for each growth stage are shown in bold. The other table
    entries show irrigation recommendations for field sections that are dryer than
    the optimal trigger point. Across all MZs, the optimal irrigation durations were
    in the range of 1.9 to 2.6 h. However, the triggering thresholds varied by location.
    Thresholds for MZ1 and MZ2 were in the range of -18.3 to -30 kPa, whereas the
    range for MZ3 and MZ4 was -10 to -20 kPa. In general, the recommendations are
    for more frequent and slightly shorter irrigations in MZ3 and MZ4, which are located
    on the east side of the field and feature finer textured soils. With the specific
    Hydrus-1D model parameterization used in the current study, uptake and transpiration
    are penalized whenever any portion of the soil approaches saturation. The recommendation
    of somewhat shorter, more frequent irrigations on the east side is due to optimization’s
    aversion to creating overly wet soil conditions near the surface, such as may
    occur (albeit briefly) during a longer irrigation. Table 4. Irrigation scheduling

    recommended 11 to 13 % less water and increased transpiration by 5 to 8 %. For
    MZ3, 29 % less water was recommended, with an increase in transpiration of 24
    %. And for MZ4, a 17 % reduction in irrigation corresponded to a massive 53% increase
    in transpiration. These results are consistent with our earlier findings and discussion
    indicating the field was over-irrigated, especially in MZ3 and MZ4. Table 5. Comparisons

    due to the spatial and temporal variability of a number of variables and parameters.
    In this work, we investigated a workflow for improved precision irrigation scheduling
    using data from a field where four maize varieties were sown. The workflow is
    based on dynamic MZ delineation with unsupervised clustering. This study demonstrates
    that delineation of MZs based on NDVI clustering was able to statistically represent
    within-field spatial variability better than delineating MZs only based on maize
    varieties. Additionally, the optimal number and spatial configuration of the MZs
    were found to change over the growing season. The highest number of MZs was four.
    The MZ1 and MZ2 corresponded to field sections where NDVI values reflected a typical
    maize crop performance, whereas MZ3 and MZ4 featured relatively low values indicative
    of poor maize growth. Soil water content showed that the variation in crop performance
    was attributable to soil hydraulic properties, soil available water, and over-irrigation.
    Further, a relationship existed between NDVI and soil available water. The results
    indicated that soil available water could potentially also be used for, or incorporated
    into, in-season evaluation of management zone designs. Lastly, we proposed a method
    of combining dynamic management zone delineation with Hydrus 1-D model forecasts
    for irrigation scheduling. The field experiment was first simulated to confirm
    the model parameterization and demonstrate its consistency with the obtained NDVI
    and soil water content data. We then used model simulations to determine an optimal
    zonation and irrigation calendar for different crop growth stages that could have
    been generated and updated in real time during the season. Simulations with the
    optimized irrigation schedule produced an increase in transpiration and a decrease
    in water use as compared to the field trial (which, again, was over-irrigated).
    The improvement was especially remarkable for MZ3 and MZ4, where irrigation was
    reduced by 28.5 and 16.6 %, and transpiration increased by 23.9 and 52.6 %, respectively.
    In summary, we note that although NDVI is useful for dynamically delineating management
    zones, for irrigation scheduling it is recommended that NDVI be combined with
    some additional measure of soil conditions. Low NDVI values may be indicative
    of poor crop performance, but without other information it is not possible to
    determine the cause nor recommend a remedial irrigation or management practice.

    This study was supported by the European Commission Horizon 2020 Programme for
    Research and Innovation (H2020) in the context of the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Research
    and Innovation Staff Exchange (RISE) action (ACCWA project, grant agreement no.:
    823965). This study was also funded by the project ‘Low Input Sustainable Agriculture
    (LISA)’ under the Operational program FEDER for Catalonia 2014‐2020 RIS3CAT (http://www.lisaproject.cat/introduction/).
    Appendix B. Hydrus -1D Simulations Hydrus-1D (Šimůnek et al., 2016, 2008) was
    used to simulated soil moisture dynamics and water balance components at each
    monitoring station. Each simulation spanned 105 days, from the 18th to the 123rd
    day after sowing. The 60 cm soil profile consisted of three layers/materials,
    as specified in Table 2. Soil hydraulic properties were specified using the van
    Genuchten-Mualem model (van Genuchten, 1980) Eq B.1 and B.2 as follows: (B.1)
    and (B.2) where (cm3 cm-3) is the volumetric water content; h is the soil water
    pressure head (cm); (cm3 cm-3) is saturated water content; (cm3 cm-3) is residual
    water content; (cm·d-1) is saturated hydraulic conductivity; and are shape parameters;
    ; and . In Hydrus, root water uptake Eq. (B.3) is simulated using a sink term
    which has three parts, the potential transpiration rate (Tp) (cm·d-1), the root
    density distribution (β) (cm-1), and the dimensionless water stress function (
    (h)): (B.3) The actual transpiration rate (Ta) Eq (B.4) (cm·d-1) is calculated
    by integrating Eq. (B.3) over the root zone LR: (B.4) Root depth was measured
    twice a month during the field campaign at P9 station. This information was used
    to parameterize the Hydrus root growth module. Water stress Eq (B.5) was modeled
    using the Feddes et al. (1978) function: (B.5) Parameterized by four critical
    values of pressure head, Eq. (B.5) defines maximal uptake ( ) when the soil water
    pressure head is . Water uptake decreases linearly above or below that range (
    ). And uptake is zero when . According to the Hydrus-1D database, the parameter
    values for maize are h1 = -1.5, h2 = -3.0, h3 = -60. and h4 = -800. kPa, respectively.
    The value of h3 was allowed to vary as a function of evaporative demand as modeled
    by Hyrdurs-1D. Three observation nodes were inserted in the domain at the same
    depths as the soil moisture sensors, 15, 35 and 50 cm. Soil moisture values simulated
    at the observation nodes were used to determine the simulated available water
    ( ), using the same procedure as with the field data. The potential evaporation
    and transpiration rates were calculated by partitioning ETc into potential evaporation
    (Ep) and transpiration (Tp) based on the canopy cover fraction (α) according to
    Raes et al. (2009). An atmospheric boundary condition was imposed at the surface
    and a free drainage condition was used at the bottom. Simulated actual transpiration
    ( ) and simulated applied irrigation ( ) results from each station were extracted.
    and were calculated by averaging stations located with the dynamic MZs. Appendix
    C. Irrigation Scheduling Irrigation scheduling was optimized using the methodology
    developed by Fontanet (2019). All soil, environmental and crop inputs are the
    same as described previously for the Hydrus-1D simulations (Appendix B). Possible
    values for the irrigation scheduling parameters were constrained to be {-10, -20,
    …, −100 kPa} and {1, 2, 3, 4 h·d-1}. The irrigation rate was constant (6.5 l·h-1
    m-2). The soil depth used to trigger irrigation ( ) changed during the growing
    season, becoming deeper as the season progressed. Irrigation parameters have been
    defined at each station and at different crop growing stages (V0-V5, V6-V10, V11-V15,
    VT, R1-R6). The optimal irrigation at each grow stage and MZ are the average values
    obtained for the stations located in the MZ. Appendix A. Supplementary data The

    Management in Irrigation System Using IoT Chapter © 2021 1 Introduction Wireless
    sensor networks (WSNs) are constantly used from the scientific community since
    the potential of ecological monitoring software composed of cost-effective possibility
    to construct and process all kinds of information with greater resolution, these
    systems are regarded as a important part of ubiquitous computing [1, 2]. Therefore,
    using IoT-driven WSN platform in precision agriculture can revolutionize the information
    assortment in agricultural area and encourage the sought after exceptionally machine-driven
    agriculture method which demands intensive understanding of ecological conditions
    in the base level and speedy communication of the information to a distant or
    local server where the source of storage and process, identification of insects
    inside the plants, burial or hyperbolic moist, the alternative generating, and
    so the direction of plantation instrumentation is completed instantly (automatic
    propulsion apparatus such as sprinklers, foggers, valve-controlled irrigation
    method, and so forth is used for management irrigation, and fertilization and
    pest control in order to offset the negative states forming wireless sensor in
    addition to actuator network (WSAN). The above system is accessible globally due
    to the involvement of IoT technology [3,4,5]. A fast evaluation and observation
    of soil moisture content (MC) of this massive area is necessary so that optimum
    irrigation will be possible at agriculture plantation region. Gravimetric method
    is called the standard to determine soil water content version, but it is not
    effective in providing large-scale fast data collection and can be limited to
    a compact dimension quantity. Geophysical techniques like ground penetrating radar
    (GPR) and electromagnetic induction (EMI) quantify a bigger sample quantity and
    therefore are accommodated to cover huge areas economically, which could not triumph
    from different procedures [6,7,8]. Additional techniques of spectroscopic scanning-based
    soil moisture material discovery are most frequently used to find soil MC map
    of a huge agriculture property, but utilizing this way is frequently expensive
    work, and also they are not used to find soil MC variations through the summertime
    [9, 10]. Within exactly the same circumstance, wireless sensor network (WSN)-based
    land MC evaluation can be utilized for real-time observation and evaluation of
    dirt MC dynamics throughout the whole cropping time. Liang et al. [11] have suggested
    a plan and employ a real-time irrigation forecast using GPRS and WSN system .
    The addition of the general system uses WSN to obtain soil MC information. The
    backend system employs the hereditary back-propagation neural system to assess
    in addition to process sensor information with simulated annealing algorithm to
    maximize the outcome for real time forecast. The experimental results reveal that
    the system suggested by Liang et al. [11] gets the benefits of low-cost, higher
    precision and suitable maintenance. The process implied by Liang et al. [11] is
    a straight sensing of soil MC using WSN platform, and this content does not signify
    the mechanism for water conservation by simply contemplating weather conditions.
    Similarly, the work does not emphasize on remote access like IoT-enabled control
    [12, 13]. At the similar circumstance, additional property-associated parameters
    and ecological parameters might impact the irrigation demands. Timely forecast
    of soil moisture content may soon demonstrate much improved irrigation optimization
    by considering all of the crucial parameters that impact the soil water flow.
    Further, the prediction methodology for a large agriculture land requires high
    computing resources which is possible in a cloud-enabled services. Thus, IoT comes
    into the picture with data analytics and machine learning framework [14,15,16,17,18].
    The suggested method is determined by establishing wireless sensors in the farm
    to acquire real-time observation and evaluate soil moisture content (MC) in the
    test site. The test site is of length 50 m and width 50 m. It is implanted with
    Bermuda grass that is generally used as an ayurvedic medicine for colitis and
    gut infections. The distributed sensor network nodes are utilized to acquire real-time
    soil as well as environmental parameters. The general parameters considered are
    soil moisture content (MC), soil temperature, temperature of the surrounding,
    humidity level of the surrounding, CO2 level of air, as well as sunlight intensity
    level. The WNS environment is configured as nine numbers of wireless sensor nodes
    and a single gateway node (GN) or the coordinator node. The gateway node is also
    called as the coordinator node and others behave as router nodes. The coordinator
    node is responsible to collect all the sensor information and forward it to the
    cloud platform for necessary prediction of soil water requirements. The coordinator
    node is designed with Raspberry Pi3, Zigbee tranceiver (S2 series) and wifi circuitry
    (On board). Further, gateway node connects the internet application via the wifi
    network for the prediction of the soil water requirements. The essential data
    set is obtained over wifi connectivity to the internet server unit for the estimation
    of soil MC. Further, it is used obtain the soil MC distribution map of the land.
    With this work structural similarity index (SSIM)-based soil MC deficiency is
    calculated to manipulate irrigation valves to maintain the required water content
    uniform over the farm area. The performance of two different optimization algorithms
    such as VLRGD and GD-based neural network (NN) data prediction strategies is compared
    by computing few statistical errors like RMSE, R-squared error and MSE. Similarly,
    Majone et al. [19] have used wireless sensor network to supervise MC dynamics
    of the top soil in both time and space that is appropriate to examine the relationship
    between MC dynamics and plant physiology. The wireless sensor network deployment
    consists of twenty-seven locations (in verticals direction) configured by multi-hop
    configuration. The every wireless node contains 5 numbers of soil moisture sensor
    probes those are deployed in the varied depths like 10, 20, 30, 50 and 80, along
    with a temperature sensing device (temperature sensor PT100) at a distance downwards
    25 cm [3, 17]. The method projected by Majone et al. [19] does not provide the
    mechanism for site-specific irrigation valve control for maintaining efficient
    irrigation requirement. Irrigation scheduling and decision support system will
    provide better control over farm land water requirement. And also the water requirement
    is not precisely controlled by considering site-specific weather data. There are
    several weather condition-dependent irrigation controllers available commercially.
    All these instruments are based on few environmental parameters like temperature,
    humidity and solar radiation [20,21,22,23,24]. But other environmental parameters
    like wind speed, CO2 and soil-related parameters are also affects the farm irrigation
    requirements [25,26,27]. The complete intelligent weather-dependent irrigation
    control scheme is also discussed in this article. In the similar perspective,
    Lenka et al. [28] projected the MC prediction using partial-least-square-regression
    and fuzzy logic technique to manage the land irrigation requirements. The method
    produces MSE about 0.183193 and RMSE about 0.428011. The method proposed by Lenka
    et al. [28] controls the farm irrigation valve in a real-time approach, but zone-wise
    irrigation map is not included in the work. Similarly Lenka et al. [28] proposed
    BFGS-quasi-newton feedforward NN to forecast MC level in 1 h advance, and it is
    integrated with fuzzy logic model to generate appropriate irrigation valve control
    commands. The land soil moisture requirement map is not proposed in this work
    which will be produce better zone-wise as well as crop-wise irrigation control.
    The moisture map shows a better view over the soil moisture content deficiency
    of the farm land [29, 30]. The irrigation requirements can easily be addressed
    quickly by the IoT-driven decision support system (DSS). Our SSIM-based zone and
    crop specific irrigation control mechanism will produce added advantage for efficient
    irrigation control scheme over a large farming area. 2 Proposed methodology The
    main aim of the research work described in this article is to design a precise
    irrigation monitoring and control mechanism consisting of the following objectives.
    Development of a low-cost and high accuracy distributed IoT-enabled wireless sensor
    network environment for accurately monitoring the soil and environmental parameters
    which are used for predicting timely water requirements. Development of a precise
    optimization mechanism for timely forecast of MC level. Development of a robust
    mechanism for generating soil moisture content distribution map using interpolation
    technique. The distribution map is generated by measuring soil moisture content
    at nine positions of the farmland using IoT enabled WSN environment (land dimension
    is defined in the experimental site section of the article). Structural similarity
    index (SSIM) mechanisms that associate interpolated data for generating zone-specific
    irrigation control commands to control irrigation valves. Implementation of the
    weather condition-dependent irrigation control mechanism using fuzzy logic-based
    weather model. The detailed explanation of the above methodology is explained
    in the rest of the sections. 3 Experimental site The test site is situated at
    Bhubaneswar (Latitude: 20.351323, Longitude: 85.806547) in the eastern region
    of India. The cultivated farm has an area of almost 5000 m2. The profile consists
    of a layer of soppy soil, quite 2 m deep with sandy loam surface. Here the key
    top soil quality was found by laboratory study of untouched sample of 3.5 kg.
    Further, the dry bulk density and consistency of the soil sample are about 1.43
    g-cm−3 and 0.46 g-cm−3, respectively. The deployment of WSN nodes is shown in
    Fig. 1 where all nodes are connected with each other using multi-hop mesh network.
    The architecture of a single WSN node is shown in Fig. 2. All sensors are interfaced
    with the node via internal eight channels analog-to-digital converter (ADC) of
    the microcontroller (ATMEGA328P-PU). The microcontroller communicates with the
    Zigbee S2 unit via RS232 interface. Each Zigbee S2 device is configured using
    mesh network topology. The digital out pin of the Zigbee S2 is used to activate
    corresponding sprinkler valve unit. In this work, the irrigation mechanism consists
    of sprinkler pipe lines with sprinkler heads at 0.41 m spacing as well as with
    a flow of 2.2 Lh−1. Fig. 1 Deployment of wireless sensor network nodes in a Bermuda
    grass (Cynodon dactylon) planting site located at Bhubaneswar (latitude: 20.351323,
    longitude: 85.806547) Full size image Fig. 2 a Single node architecture of the
    WSN environment b proposed Single node fabricated for acquiring farm data. The
    IP67 housing used for the sensor node is shown in the right side figure Full size
    image 4 Proposed IoT-driven WSN system The battery capacity and backup are two
    major factors of the WSN nodes. All sensors are connected to the analog-to-digital
    converter (ADC) of the microcontroller. The battery capacity chosen in this work
    is of 6 V/4.5 A/h lead acid type. The solar panel provides necessary charging
    current to the batter unit during day time. The solar panel chosen in this work
    is of 7 V/250 mA. The fabricated WSN node is shown in Fig. 2b. Similarly, the
    energy supply is also monitored in a real-time approach via ADC of the controller.
    The data acquisition is carried out in every 10 min and during non-transmitting
    mode the Zigbee modem is kept in a sleep mode which eventually increases the battery
    backup. During deep sleep mode, the Zigbee generally consumes a very low current
    as 0.02 µA. The Zigbee transceivers are configured in a mesh network pattern by
    updating the device firmware. Finally, the gateway is responsible to send the
    data to the internet web server for real-time analysis of sensor parameters. The
    complete unit is enclosed in a IP65 enclosure and mounted in a panel box. The
    solar panel is inclined at 45° for maximum power efficiency. In the similar context,
    Yunseop James et al. (2008) have proposed a 295-m-long linear movement irrigation
    system at Valley, Valmont Irrigation, Valley, NE [26]. It is observed that Bluetooth
    radio has many limitations as compared to Zigbee. The wireless nodes are utilized
    to acquire sensor data and forward it to the sink node for storing in its own
    database. The detailed architecture of the sink node is shown in Fig. 3. In this
    work, MATLAB is used to communicate with the sink node for collecting all data
    which is used for soil MC prediction and irrigation valve control using SSIM technique.
    Fig. 3 Sink node architecture of the WSN environment Full size image 5 Proposed
    soil MC prediction and irrigation control methodology The proposed MC prediction
    methodology is based on feedforward neural network where the input parameters
    are the real-time wireless sensor data [31, 32]. In this article, the performance
    analysis of the training algorithms such as VLRGD and GD is deliberated for implementation
    of IoT-WSN bidirectional DSS (decision support system) in PA (precision agriculture)
    mechanism. After the successful prediction of soil MC at every location of the
    WSN nodes connected in the field area, bilinear interpolation is used to generate
    soil MC distribution throughout the farm land. The soil MC distribution map generated
    using interpolation is compared with required soil MC using SSIM, which plays
    an important role in controlling zone-specific irrigation valves. The valve control
    command generated using SSIM is used to evaluate the actual necessity of water
    by implementing fuzzy logic-based weather-dependent irrigation mechanism. A detailed
    flow model of the methodology is shown in Fig. 4. Further, the performance analysis
    of the above two prediction methodologies is listed in Table 1A (Fig. 5). Fig.

    Variable learning rate gradient descent (VLRGD) The neural network performance
    depends on learning rate; therefore, the error rate converges soon. The bigger
    learning rate may converge the error rate of the neural network training. But
    much bigger learning rate will make the neural network unstable. Similarly, much
    smaller learning rate will take long time to converge [14, 33]. To improve the
    convergence time, the VLRGD neural network assumes bigger learning rate \\(\\alpha\\).
    Further, the new weight vector \\(V_{i + 1 }\\) is modified with a varying \\(\\alpha_{i}\\).
    Again,\\(g_{k}\\) is the gradient of the error with respect to the weight matrix
    [14, 34,35,36]. There is momentum (μ) of gradient descent for a varying \\(\\alpha_{k
    }\\) [33]. Normally, the updated weight vector \\(V_{i + 1 }\\) is defined in
    Eq. 1. $$V_{i + 1} = V_{i} - \\alpha_{i + 1} g_{i} + \\mu V_{i - 1}$$ (1) $$\\alpha_{i
    + 1} = \\beta \\alpha_{i}$$ $$\\beta = \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}c} {0.75
    \\;{\\text{if updated error}} > 1.05\\, \\left( {\\text{for previous error}} \\right)}
    \\\\ {1.05 \\;{\\text{if updated error}} < 1.05\\, \\left( {\\text{for previous
    error}} \\right)} \\\\ \\end{array} } \\right.$$ 6.1 Gradient descent This optimization
    technique updates the weight matrix and bias values in the direction of the negative
    gradient [28]. The updated weight matrix is based on Eq. 2. $$w_{k + 1} = w_{k}
    - \\alpha_{k} g_{k}$$ (2) The updated weight matrix depends on three factors such
    as current weight matrix (wk), updated weight matrix (wk+1), learning rate (α)
    and gradient error (\\(g_{k}\\)) with respect to the weight matrix [28, 37, 38].
    The negative sign of the weight matrix signifies that it is following the opposite
    direction. 6.2 Bilinear interpolation on the grid data The bilinear transformation
    is a type of linear interpolation technique where the interpolation of two variables
    (x and y) on a 2D plane. This interpolation first performs in one direction and
    then again in another direction. For example, an unknown function ‘f’ at two different
    points (a, b) need to be interpolated where four discrete points are available
    which is mentioned below. D11 = (a1, b1), D12 = (a1, b2), D21 = (a2, b1), and
    D22 = (a2, b2) Firstly, the interpolation is performed in the x-direction and
    then in y-direction according to Eqs. 3 and 4. These yields. $$f\\left( {a,y_{1}
    } \\right) \\approx \\frac{{a_{2} - a}}{{a_{2} - a_{1} }}f\\left( {D_{11} } \\right)
    + \\frac{{a - a_{1} }}{{a_{2} - a_{1} }}f\\left( {D_{21} } \\right)$$ (3) $$f\\left(
    {a,y_{2} } \\right) \\approx \\frac{{a_{2} - a}}{{a_{2} - a_{1} }}f\\left( {D_{12}
    } \\right) + \\frac{{a - a_{1} }}{{a_{2} - a_{1} }}f\\left( {D_{22} } \\right)$$
    (4) Further, the interpolation is performed from y-direction to estimate the interpolated
    data according to Eq. 5. $$f\\left( {a,b} \\right) \\approx \\frac{{b_{2} - b}}{{b_{2}
    - b_{1} }}f\\left( {a,b_{1} } \\right) + \\frac{{b - b_{1} }}{{b_{2} - b_{1} }}f\\left(
    {a,b_{2} } \\right)$$ (5) Finally, the same result is used to interpolate the
    values in x-direction. 6.3 Structural similarity (SSIM) index The SSIM conveys
    the visual characteristics by calculating a similarity measure between two spots
    such as x and y. The SSIM is calculated by multiplying mean m(x, y), variance
    v(x, y), along with cross-correlation r(x, y) as mentioned in Eq. 6 [39]. $${\\text{SSIM}}\\left(
    {x, y} \\right) = m\\left( {x, y} \\right)^{\\alpha } \\times v\\left( {x, y}
    \\right)^{\\beta } \\times c\\left( {x, y} \\right)^{\\gamma }$$ (6) $$\\quad
    \\qquad= \\left( {\\frac{{2\\mu_{x} \\mu_{y} + C_{1} }}{{\\mu_{x}^{2} + \\mu_{y}^{2}
    + C_{1} }}} \\right)^{\\alpha } \\times \\left( {\\frac{{2\\delta_{x} \\delta_{y}

    Ci for i = 1, 2, 3 are small positive constants. 6.4 Fuzzification and defuzzification
    Fuzzification is that the practice of building a sharp fuzzy set. This is sometimes
    accomplished by simply recognizing that a number of these amounts will be thought
    about to be eloquent and settled that are really not deterministic whatsoever.
    Uncertainty that is clear is carried by them. In the event the form of doubt occurs
    to appear as a consequence of ambiguity; then the factor could be portrayed by
    means of a membership function. Similarly, defuzzification is the transformation
    of a fuzzy figure into an explicit amount, as fuzzification is the conversion
    of an equal amount to some fuzzy quantity. Similarly, the output of a fuzzy method
    may be the logical union of 2 or additional fuzzy membership functions outlined
    on the universe of discourse of the output variable. The fuzzy logic is a rule-based
    model where the inputs and outputs are bounded to the rule sets. The outputs of
    the model are mathematically bounded to the input parameters. In this article,
    we have considered the real-time sensor parameters as the inputs to the model
    and valve control commands are generated according to the rule set defined in
    the fuzzy logic model. In this work, the weather information as well as the predicted
    soil MC is used to generate appropriate irrigation valve control commands. The
    fuzzification and defuzzification process is shown in Fig. 4. 6.5 Proposed flow
    model for irrigation valve control The proposed flow model of the irrigation control
    scheme is depicted in Fig. 6. The irrigation control mechanism takes into account
    of all the IoT enabled WSN node data for analyzing soil MC distribution using
    bilinear interpolation. Finally, precise irrigation valve control is done using
    SSIM index of the interpolated data with the reference soil MC. The agriculture
    irrigation valve control is efficiently performed using real-time acquisition
    of IoT-enabled WSN data, neural network prediction module and fuzzy logic-based
    decision-making module. The DSS model is integrated with a GSM modem for SMS sending.
    The interfacing is done using suitable AT command sequences through RS232 interface
    with the server station. Fig. 6 Flow chart of the irrigation control mechanism
    using hybrid decision model Full size image 7 Results and discussions The optimization
    techniques utilized within the scope of this neural network-based prediction methodology
    are variable learning rate gradient descent and gradient descent. The parameters
    used to establish a relationship between wireless sensor data and soil MC in 1
    h advance are shown in Table 1A. Further, the crop water need can be studied from
    Table 1B where the water requirement of some seasonal crops are listed. The performance
    analysis of the prediction algorithm is done by evaluating R-squared, MSE and
    RMSE. It is observed that VLRGD-based feedforward NN pattern classification generates
    minimum MSE, RMSE, and better R-squared value. Finally, this is used for the generation
    of MC distribution map of the farm land by taking all the IoT enabled WSN node
    data. Few input parameters such as sunrise time, UV index, and air flow rate are
    taken from weather forecast data, and soil type is taken from manual soil test
    of the farm land. VLRGD and NN pattern classification is used to predict soil
    MC by obtaining soil and environmental information. The soil MC prediction performance
    in addition to error graph is shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 7 Actual soil moisture content
    and predicted soil moisture content versus time in hours. Error graph plotted
    between residuals and time in hours [gradient descent optimization-based neural
    network pattern classification] Full size image Actual soil moisture content and
    predicted soil moisture content versus time in hours error graph plotted between

    network pattern classification]. Similarly, the performance of VLRGD-based NN
    pattern classification training is shown in Fig. 8. The accurate training performance
    is found after 2000 epochs. The training state of VLRGD-based NN pattern classification
    is shown in Fig. 9. It is observed that the best training was performed after
    1999 epochs. Fig. 8 Variable learning rate gradient descent-based neural network

    NN pattern classification training is performed to analyze training performance.
    The soil MC prediction response and error graph of GD-based NN pattern classification
    model is shown in Fig. 10. The GD optimization-based NN pattern classification
    training performance is shown in Fig. 11. The accurate training is performed after
    2000 epochs. Fig. 10 Actual soil moisture content and predicted soil moisture

    performance of Gradient Descent optimization based neural network pattern classification
    technique. Furthermore, the validation check of GD optimization for water requirement
    is shown in Fig. 12. Then, the performance analysis is established by evaluating
    general statistical errors like MSE, R-squared value and RMSE which is shown in
    Table 2. The MSE and RMSE are required to analyze the behavior of the two prediction
    techniques during the estimation of required soil moisture content. Less is the
    MSE and RMSE, more better is the performance of the prediction algorithm. Similarly,
    R-squared value more closely to 1 represents the better estimation of the target
    values during the training of neural network algorithm. Fig. 12 Training state
    of the gradient descent optimization neural network pattern classification training
    Full size image Table 2 Different errors obtained prediction of soil MC Full size
    table Gradient descent (GD) has higher MSE and RMSE than VLRGD-based neural network
    soil moisture content prediction algorithm. Similarly, the variable learning rate
    gradient descent (VLRGD) produces less MSE and RMSE compared to GD-based neural
    network soil moisture content prediction algorithm. It is found from Table 2 that
    the performance of the VLRGD is far better than simple GD-based neural network
    pattern classification method. This method is used to calculate MC in 1 h advance
    of all the farm regions wherever IoT-enabled WSN nodes are connected. The predicted
    MC using VLRGD-based neural network pattern classification of all the regions
    is stored for generating soil MC distribution map in 1 h advance as shown in Fig.
    13. Fig. 13 Soil MC distribution map using Variable Learning Rate Gradient Descent

    map using variable learning rate gradient descent neural network pattern classification
    training. The soil MC distribution map data are used for bilinear interpolation
    for generating complete soil MC distribution map at each location of the farm
    land. The complete soil MC distribution map is shown in Fig. 14. The required
    soil MC distribution of the farm land is shown in Fig. 15. Fig. 14 Complete soil
    MC distribution map at every region of the farm land using bilinear interpolation

    The SSIM index-based soil MC deficiency map is generated by considering interpolated
    soil MC distribution data and required soil MC distribution data. The SSIM index-based
    soil MC deficiency map is shown in Fig. 16. Furthermore, the soil MC deficiency
    data of the agriculture area are impressed to fuzzy logic-based weather module
    to generate actual irrigation valve commands (Fig. 17). Fig. 16 Soil MC deficiency

    Full size image The membership functions defined in the fuzzy logic model are
    shown in Fig. 18a–f. Further, the surface plot of the membership functions is
    also shown in Fig. 18g, h. The rules are listed in Table 3. All the parameters
    for the fuzzy version are recorded in Table 4. Fig. 18 Valve status in nine regions

    by considering fuzzy inference system with SSIM index-based soil MC deficiency
    data and the valve status of nine regions of the farm land is shown in Figs. 18
    and 19. The net irrigation from 01-Feb-2018 to 12-May-2018 and irrigation status
    for 02-Feb-2018 is shown in Fig. 20. A sample valve control command matrix for
    single region soil MC deficiency is shown in Table 5. It is observed from Table
    5 that the valve control commands are generated in a matrix format where 0 and
    1 are used. The ‘0’ represents OFF condition of the valve, and ‘1’ represents
    the ON condition of the valve. Fig. 19 Valve status in nine regions of the farm
    land. Right side corner and center region are having low soil MC level Full size

    soil MC deficiency in different regions Full size table 8 Conclusion The valve
    control is done successfully by contemplating soil MC prediction technique utilizing
    VLRGD-based optimization algorithm. A comparative analysis between VLRGD and GD
    is also formed by acquiring MSE, RMSE and R-squared value. During this test, we
    found that VLRGD has a much reduced MSE and RMSE such as 0.0468 and 0.0021, respectively.
    Similarly, GD-based NN prediction system produces much higher MSE and RMSE values
    such as 0.1111 and 0.0123, respectively. The comprehensive soil MC requirement
    map is obtained using bilinear interpolation and SSIM-based approach. The irrigation
    valve control commands are generated successfully with fuzzy logic weather model
    to fulfil uniform farm irrigation requirement almost all the weather conditions.

  title: Adapting weather conditions based IoT enabled smart irrigation technique
    in precision agriculture mechanisms
  verbatim_quote1: '"This projected work relies on independent internet of things
    (IoT) enabled wireless sensor network (WSN) framework consisting of soil moisture
    (MC) probe, soil temperature measuring device, environmental temperature sensor,
    environmental humidity sensing device, CO2 sensor, daylight intensity device (light
    dependent resistor) to acquire real-time farm information through multi-point
    measurement."'
  verbatim_quote2: '"Our proposed irrigation control scheme utilizes structural similarity
    (SSIM)-based water valve management mechanism which is used to locate farm regions
    having water deficiency."'
  verbatim_quote3: '"Finally, SSIM index-based soil MC deficiency is calculated to
    manipulate the specified valves for maintaining uniform water requirement through
    the entire farm area. The valve control commands are again processed using fuzzy
    logic-based weather condition modeling system to manipulate control commands by
    considering different weather conditions."'
- analysis: 'The study presented in this paper focuses on utilizing machine learning
    techniques, specifically Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT), to develop
    an automated system for irrigation management based on comprehensive data collected
    from various sources, including soil sensors, a meteorological station, and irrigation
    records. The researchers constructed a dataset spanning over two years, incorporating
    data from 22 soil sensors, a meteorological station, and actual irrigation records.
    This comprehensive dataset allowed them to analyze the impact of different factors,
    such as soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and irrigation history, on irrigation
    recommendations.


    The GBRT model achieved remarkable accuracy, with a success rate of 93% in predicting
    irrigation quantities. The model was developed using different subsets of variables
    to identify the ones that consistently contributed to prediction accuracy. The
    results revealed that soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and irrigation
    history were the most influential factors in determining irrigation recommendations.
    Interestingly, the model suggested that data on drought/saturation and IPPD weather
    could be excluded from the dataset with little loss in accuracy.


    The findings of this study demonstrate the potential of machine learning techniques
    for automating irrigation management and optimizing water usage. The developed
    model can significantly facilitate the irrigation planning process by providing
    accurate irrigation recommendations based on real-time data. This automation not
    only increases efficiency but also allows farmers to make more informed decisions,
    leading to improved crop yield and water conservation.'

  description: Jojoba Israel is a world-leading producer of Jojoba products, whose
    orchards are covered with sensors that collect soil moisture data for monitoring
    plant needs at real-time. Based on these data, the company’s agronomist defines
    a weekly irrigation plan. In addition, data on weather, irrigation, and yield
    are recorded from other sources (e.g. meteorological station and irrigation-plan
    records). However, so far, there has been no attempt to use the entire set of
    collected data to reveal insights and interesting relationships between different
    variables, such as soil, weather, irrigation characteristics, and resulting yield.
    By integrating and utilizing data from different sources, our research aims at
    using the collected data not only for monitoring and controlling the crop, but
    also for predicting irrigation recommendations. In particular, a dataset was constructed
    by integrating data collected over almost two years from 22 soil-sensors spread
    in four major plots (which are divided into 28 subplots and eight irrigation groups),
    from a meteorological station, and from actual irrigation records. Different regression
    and classification algorithms were applied on this dataset to develop models that
    were able to predict the weekly irrigation plan as recommended by the agronomist.
    The models were developed using eight different subsets of variables to determine
    which variables consistently contributed to prediction accuracy. By comparing
    the resulting models, it was shown that the best regression model was Gradient
    Boosted Regression Trees, with 93% accuracy, and the best classification model
    was the Boosted Tree Classifier, with 95% accuracy (on the test-set). Data that
    were not contributing to the model prediction success rate were identified as
    well. The resulting model can significantly facilitate the agronomist’s irrigation
    planning process. In addition, the potential of applying machine learning on the
    company data for yield and disease prediction is discussed.

    Citations Explore all metrics Abstract Jojoba Israel is a world-leading producer
    of Jojoba products, whose orchards are covered with sensors that collect soil
    moisture data for monitoring plant needs at real-time. Based on these data, the
    company’s agronomist defines a weekly irrigation plan. In addition, data on weather,
    irrigation, and yield are recorded from other sources (e.g. meteorological station
    and irrigation-plan records). However, so far, there has been no attempt to use
    the entire set of collected data to reveal insights and interesting relationships
    between different variables, such as soil, weather, irrigation characteristics,
    and resulting yield. By integrating and utilizing data from different sources,
    our research aims at using the collected data not only for monitoring and controlling
    the crop, but also for predicting irrigation recommendations. In particular, a
    dataset was constructed by integrating data collected over almost two years from
    22 soil-sensors spread in four major plots (which are divided into 28 subplots
    and eight irrigation groups), from a meteorological station, and from actual irrigation
    records. Different regression and classification algorithms were applied on this
    dataset to develop models that were able to predict the weekly irrigation plan
    as recommended by the agronomist. The models were developed using eight different
    subsets of variables to determine which variables consistently contributed to
    prediction accuracy. By comparing the resulting models, it was shown that the
    best regression model was Gradient Boosted Regression Trees, with 93% accuracy,
    and the best classification model was the Boosted Tree Classifier, with 95% accuracy
    (on the test-set). Data that were not contributing to the model prediction success
    rate were identified as well. The resulting model can significantly facilitate
    the agronomist’s irrigation planning process. In addition, the potential of applying
    machine learning on the company data for yield and disease prediction is discussed.

    developments in the fields of wireless sensor networks, satellite imagery technology,
    smart agricultural machinery, and ubiquitous mobile communication, together forming
    the Internet of things (IoT), have led many farms to adopt precision agriculture
    (PA) and become ‘smart farms’ (Castle et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2002). Nevertheless,
    it seems that still, in many of these smart farms, data gathered from different
    sources are analyzed separately and the potential of value extraction from existing
    data is not fully realized (Sørensen et al. 2010). In addition, collected data
    are mainly used for purposes of monitoring and controlling crops, e.g., by responding
    to soil moisture levels or disease symptoms (Damas et al. 2001; de Miranda 2003;
    Evans and Bergman 2007; Yunseop et al. 2008; Vellidis et al. 2016). Against this
    background, the present study shows that data integrated from different sources
    could be also exploited for predicting agronomist irrigation recommendations.
    This study was conducted in collaboration with Jojoba Israel, one of the world’s
    leading producers of Jojoba oils, as well as a leader in the use of sensor-based
    agriculture. The orchards of Jojoba Israel are covered by sensors that collect
    soil and plant-related data, which are used for monitoring the state of plants
    at real-time. Additionally, the company’s agronomist (hereinafter, the agronomist)
    uses these data, while also considering meteorological data collected from a meteorological
    station and weather forecasts, to construct a weekly irrigation plan for each
    plot. A common approach for deciding on irrigation amounts is to use the Penman–Monteith
    equation, which approximates net evapotranspiration (ET), given daily mean temperature,
    wind speed, relative humidity, and solar radiation, as defined by the Food and
    Agriculture Organization (FAO) in the FAO-56 standard (Allen 1998). However, since
    all the equation parameters are measured by the meteorological station for the
    entire plantation (rather than for each plot), the agronomist can calculate a
    single ET value for all plots, which would lead to a single irrigation recommendation
    for all plots. The agronomist combines this ET value with other measured parameters
    and plot-related characteristics to determine plot-specific irrigation quantities,
    resulting in different irrigation quantities for different subplots. The decision
    process is conducted ‘manually’, i.e. it is based on no explicit irrigation model
    but rather on the tacit knowledge of the agronomist, who examines the plant and
    soil conditions, as reflected in the sensor-based data, and decides accordingly.
    In fact, there is no recommended model for Jojoba irrigation in the literature
    and the irrigation decision process in Jojoba Israel has changed significantly
    over the years, resulting in a steady increase of yield. The goal of this study
    was to develop a model that captures the unstructured decision process of the
    agronomist. This objective was achieved by applying machine learning (ML) on an
    integrated dataset, comprising sensor-based moisture data, meteorological data,
    and actual irrigation plans defined by the agronomist in the past, in order to
    learn his irrigation decision-making process. Various models for irrigation decision
    support exist in the literature. These models are used for different purposes,
    such as optimizing the allocation of water under different constraints (e.g. Lilburne
    et al. 1998), determining irrigation needs (e.g. Thysen and Detlefsen 2006; Jensen
    et al. 2000), scheduling (e.g. Vellidis et al. 2013), and recording water consumption
    (e.g., Mateos et al. 2002). Only few of the irrigation decision-support models
    use ML. For example, Liu et al. (2006) used a genetic algorithm to optimize water
    allocation for a single crop in different growing periods and for numerous types
    of crops, given the water cost, market price of the crops, additional costs of
    irrigation, crop expenses, and expected yield reduction because of under-irrigation
    or over-irrigation in the entire growing period. The resulting optimization models
    were incorporated in a decision support system (DSS) for precision irrigation.
    These models, however, did not account for plot-specific characteristics. The
    literature also includes models for determining irrigation needs based on plot-specific
    data. For example, Hedley et al. (2013) used ML to predict soil water status and
    water table depth based on electromagnetic mapping. Smith and Peng (2009) used
    ML to classify soil textural composition based on soil-sensor data to inform a
    deficit irrigation control system. Another approach to infer plant water status
    is based on infographics. For example, Murase et al. (1995) used a layered neural
    network to identify plant water status based on the textural features of the pictorial
    information of the plant canopy. In many of the existing models (whether they
    use ML or not), decision support is based on providing the farmer with simple
    water balance models (e.g. based on the Penman–Monteith equation) that are subjected
    to capacity constraints and allowing the farmer to simulate different irrigation
    alternatives and assess their implications. The support of these models is also
    based on displaying the farmer information on plant and soil status that is required
    for irrigation decision making. A different approach, found in the literature,
    is to model the actual decision-making process of the farmer. For example, Labbé
    et al. (2000) modeled the irrigation decision making process of farmers for limited
    water allocation and irrigation scheduling for corn. The model consisted of irrigation
    management rules for different irrigation-related tasks that were derived from
    surveys of farmers and based on monitoring their irrigation practices during a
    period of 2 years. This model was incorporated in a simulator engine that, given
    the decision context, was able to predict irrigation schedules and irrigation
    volumes with average error ranging between 6 and 13 mm for different farmers,
    reflecting an error below 6.7%. Instead of manually developing a model that captures
    the farmer’s decision process using surveys and observations, in this study, ML
    was used to capture the agronomist’s irrigation decision process. The potential
    of using ML to forecast future farmer decisions was identified by Andriyas and
    McKee (2013). In particular, they tried to model the farmer’s decision of whether
    or not to irrigate for three crops: alfalfa, barley, and corn. Whereas their work
    focused on whether to irrigate or not, our work is aimed at predicting the required
    irrigation quantities. As mentioned above, a model that captures the unstructured
    decision process of the agronomist was developed in this study. To find the best
    model, various models, developed using different ML techniques and different subsets
    of the independent variables, were compared. Thus, the model can automatically
    recommend an irrigation plan (the dependent variable) and can be therefore used
    to support irrigation decisions and increase the efficiency of the irrigation
    planning process. Achieving the objective of this study would potentially contribute
    to the literature in three ways. First, the study offers an irrigation recommendation
    model that is able to automatically recommend irrigation quantities similar to
    the expert agronomist, while accounting for plot-specific data. Automating the
    irrigation planning process of the agronomist can reduce his workload and increase
    his efficiency. Thus, the irrigation planning process can be effortlessly replicated
    to additional orchards or be carried out more often. In addition, the agronomist
    can use the model to fine-tune and validate his irrigation decisions. Second,
    the study may provide insights into the variables that contribute to the irrigation
    recommendation prediction model and should, therefore, be collected and accounted
    for in similar analyses. Third, the study may provide insights into the ML techniques
    that are most suitable for constructing irrigation recommendation models. The
    rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the following section, the data
    sources and research method employed to develop the prediction models are presented.
    In addition, background on the relevant ML methods is provided. Then, the resulting
    models are presented, followed by a discussion of the results and comparison of
    the models. Finally, conclusions are provided and opportunities for developing
    other prediction models (for disease and yield prediction) based on an integrated
    dataset are discussed. Materials and methods The following subsections describe
    the data sources analyzed in this study, followed by the various steps comprising
    the research method. The study followed a typical data mining process (Fayyad
    1996), which included the stages of dataset definition, extraction-transformation-loading
    (ETL), application of ML algorithms to the dataset to train recommendation models,
    evaluation of the trained models, and selection of the best prediction model.
    Figure 1 presents the steps of the research method, which are elaborated in the
    following subsections. Fig. 1 Research process Full size image Data sources Data
    from various sources were integrated in this study. Soil moisture data were collected
    from uMANAGE™ 1—a real-time, web-based crop management system, connected to different
    types of sensors. As shown in Fig. 2, the study focused on four major plots, in
    which data had been collected since 2014. Each plot was characterized by the planting
    year (age), the type of planting (seeds or clones), whether the planting was organic
    or not, and the soil type. Each plot was further divided into 4–10 subplots that
    were separately irrigated. There were eight groups of subplots that were irrigated
    together, and each subplot was part of a specific group (the borders of each irrigation
    group are highlighted). Each subplot was also associated with one of eleven transmission
    stations, which transmitted data from two moisture sensors, located at two depths,
    shallow (less than 0.4 m underground) and deep (more than 0.4 m underground).
    In total, data were collected from 28 subplots of land, covered by 22 moisture
    sensors. Fig. 2 Jojoba Israel - plots divided into irrigation groups and subplots,
    transmission stations (each with two sensors), and meteorological station Full
    size image Apart from sensor-based moisture data, meteorological data were also
    gathered from a nearby meteorological station (marked by a blue star in Fig. 2),
    namely, data on air temperature, solar radiation, and air humidity. The plots
    were all within 1–2 km away from the meteorological station. Forecast archives
    were not available to provide the forecasting data available at the time of decision-making;
    instead, weekly average forecasts of temperature, humidity, and radiation were
    estimated by averaging the actual temperature, radiation, and humidity measured
    in the following week. Using actual data was considered satisfactory for our purpose
    because weather forecasts in this area (the city of Be’er-Sheva) are considered
    accurate (e.g. the standard error in temperature forecasts is 1 °C, according
    to the Israel Meteorological Service). Weekly irrigation plans, created by the
    agronomist and recorded in excel sheets, were also used. The dataset contained
    data that were gathered from March 2014 until the end of 2015. Dataset definition
    In this step, the structure of the dataset for model training and testing was
    defined. The dataset combined data from the sources listed above. The variables
    characterizing the dataset observations, commonly referred to as ‘observation
    features’, are presented in Table 1. Features that were gathered from uMANAGE
    (every 15 min) and from the meteorological station (every 20 min) were averaged
    or summed to represent a granularity of one week. Table 1 Dataset features Full
    size table Data extraction, transformation, and loading After the dataset structure
    was defined, the relevant data were processed following the ETL process—they were
    extracted from their sources, cleaned and transformed into the required features,
    and finally were loaded to a flat table. This ETL process is summarized next.
    Sensor data When sensors are used, noisy data is often a problem. To clean the
    data, following guidelines provided by the agronomist, moisture values smaller
    than 17 or higher than 39%, considered abnormal, were filtered out. In the complete
    dataset, such anomalies, likely to be caused by a faulty or uncalibrated sensor
    or transmitter, occurred only twice. In these two instances, the values were replaced
    by using spatial mean imputation (Kennedy and Tobler 1983), i.e. by the average
    of the values gathered from the two nearest sensors. Weekly soil moisture averages
    were then calculated for each irrigation group. Moisture sensors were located
    in two depths: deep (deeper than 0.4 m) and shallow (less than 0.4 m deep). Thus,
    two weekly moisture averages were calculated—one for each depth. In addition,
    for each irrigation group at each depth, the duration (in days), in which the
    soil was saturated (moisture level was higher than 27%, as determined by the agronomist)
    and drought-stressed (moisture level was lower than 20%, as determined by the
    agronomist) over the preceding week were calculated. These durations were represented
    as integers (1–7 days). The reason for aggregating data on a weekly basis was
    that the irrigation planning process was carried out once a week, based on data
    collected over the previous week. Meteorological data Average air temperature,
    humidity, and radiation over the preceding week and during the preceding day were
    calculated based on data that were gathered from the nearby meteorological station
    (Fig. 2), which measured these values every 20 min. Averages were calculated over
    the entire day. Additionally, these data were used to estimate the weekly average
    forecasts of temperature, humidity, and radiation by averaging the actual temperature,
    radiation, and humidity that were measured in the week for which the irrigation
    plan was prepared. Other attributes Each row of the dataset captured the above
    week-level data for a particular irrigation group (there were eight groups) in
    a particular week and year. Each row also included the characteristics of the
    irrigation group: the plot it belonged to (determining the soil type), whether
    it was organic or not, and the actual irrigation quantity in millimeters (mm),
    which served as the dependent variable. The resulting dataset included 695 records,
    representing a period of 98 weeks. This dataset was then segmented into training
    and validation sets: 70% of the records (randomly selected) were defined as the
    training-set and used to train the models, and the remaining records (30%) were
    defined as the test-set and used to evaluate the performance of the model. Machine
    learning methods The field of machine learning (ML) is concerned with the question
    of how to construct computer programs that automatically improve with experience
    (Mitchell 1997). A primary goal of ML is the construction of algorithms that can
    learn from data and make predictions using data. Usually, these algorithms use
    a large set of input observations, called a training-set, in order to tune the
    parameters of an adaptive model (Bishop 2006, p. 2). ML algorithms aim at various
    tasks, including Regression—a process for estimating the relationships between
    a dependent variable and one or more independent variables; Classification—a process
    of identifying to which category, out of a given set of categories (classes),
    an observation belongs to, based on a training-set of previously classified observations;
    Clustering—a process of dividing a set of observations into a number of groups
    (clusters), such that observations grouped in the same cluster are more similar
    to each other than to those in other clusters (according to a given similarity
    function); and Association rule learning—a statistical process of identifying
    strong interesting relationships (rules) between variables based on large sets
    of observations (Liu 2011). In the present study, regression and classification
    models were developed to predict the irrigation volumes recommended by the agronomist
    (in the case of classification models, observations were classified into five
    irrigation level classes). In the following subsections, these types of models
    are presented. Regression models A regression task can be defined as follows:
    Given a training set comprising N observations of an input variable X, written
    X ≡ (X1,…, XN)T, together with corresponding observations of the values of a target
    variable t ≡ (t1,…, tN)T, the goal is to exploit the training set in order to
    make predictions of the value t’ of the target variable for some new value X’
    of the input variable. X is in fact a vector of D features (x1,…,xD) characterizing
    each observation. A simple approach for handling this task is to use linear regression
    (Mitchell 1997, p. 237; Bishop 2006, p. 5), where a function \\(y\\left( {X,W}
    \\right) = w_{0} + w_{1} x^{1} + w_{2} x^{2} + \\ldots + w_{D} x^{D} = \\mathop
    \\sum \\limits_{i = 1}^{D} w_{i} x^{i}\\) is fitted to the training set, by finding
    the W that minimizes a loss function that measures the misfit between the function
    y(X,W) and the training set data points. The root-mean-squared error (RSME) is
    commonly used to measure the misfit. The advantage of the linear regression model
    is that it can be used to explain the effect of different factors (feature values)
    on the target (dependent) variable. A more advanced approach to regression is
    regression trees. Regression trees models (Loh 2011), similar to linear regression,
    are used to predict the value of the dependent variable, given a new data sample.
    However, different from linear regression, regression trees algorithms do not
    try to capture a linear relationship between the model features and the target
    variable. Instead, they are based on decision trees. A decision tree is a tree-graph,
    in which each internal node (i.e. a vertex with outgoing edges) is labeled with
    an input feature and the edges coming from the node are labeled with each of the
    possible values of that feature. Observations are sorted according to their feature
    values from the root of the tree downwards to the leaves. While in decision tree
    classifiers, each leaf (i.e. a vertex without outgoing edges) is labeled with
    a name of a class to which observations may belong, in regression trees, each
    leaf is labeled with a target value, which is the average of target-variable values
    of observations assigned to that leaf. For additional information on regression
    tree see (Loh 2011; Bishop 2006, p. 663). In this study, a regression tree model,
    called gradient boosted regression trees (GBRT), is used. The GBRT is a type of
    additive model that makes predictions by combining decisions from a sequence of
    base regression tree models (Elith et al. 2008). Unlike random forest (Breiman
    2001), a ML approach that constructs a multitude of decision trees independently,
    each using a subsample of data, and returns the mean prediction of the individual
    trees, GBRT uses a particular model ensemble technique called gradient boosting,
    which iteratively builds a model, while improving the performance of the previous
    iteration model. This model ensemble can be written formally as g(x) = f 0 (x)
    + f 1 (x) + f 2 (x) + …, where regression tree g(x) is a sum of base regression
    trees f i . The name Gradient Boosting comes from the association of this method
    with Gradient Descent optimization (Elith et al. 2008), commonly used to solve
    linear regression problems by finding a local minimum of the linear regression
    loss function (Bishop 2006). Similarly, let \\(g_{t} \\left( x \\right) = \\mathop
    \\sum \\limits_{i = 0}^{t - 1} f_{i} \\left( x \\right) = g_{t - 1} \\left( x
    \\right) + f_{t} \\left( x \\right)\\) be the regression tree trained at iteration
    t, L[y i ,g(x i )] be the loss function, and N be the number of observations,
    at each gradient boosting iteration, the algorithm finds a regression tree f t
    , which moves g t towards the negative gradient direction −∂L/∂g by η (step-size)
    amount. Hence, f t is chosen to be \\(f_{t} = \\mathop {\\text{argmin}}\\limits_{f}
    \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{i = 1}^{N} \\left\\{ {\\frac{{\\partial L\\left[ {y_{i}
    ,g\\left( {x_{i} } \\right)} \\right]}}{{\\partial g\\left( {x_{i} } \\right)}}
    - f(x_{i} )} \\right\\}^{2}\\) and the algorithm sets g t+1 = g t  + ηf t . Since
    for regression problems with sum-squared loss function ∂L/∂g = y i  − g(x i ),
    f t can be written as follows: $$f_{t} = \\mathop {\\text{argmin}}\\limits_{f}
    \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{i = 1}^{N} [y_{i} - g\\left( {x_{i} } \\right) - f(x_{i}
    )]^{2}.$$ GBRT is considered as one of the most effective and popular models for
    prediction (Cai et al. 2016). However, as opposed to linear regression or simple
    decision trees, which are easy to interpret, GBRT-based regression trees are more
    difficult to interpret, being a collection of many regression trees. Classification
    models Unlike regression tasks, in which the output variable is continuous, the
    output of classification tasks is one of a finite number of discrete categories.
    A classification task can be defined as follows: Given a training set comprising
    N observations of variable X, written X ≡ (X1,…, XN)T, where Xi is a vector of
    D features (x1,…,xD), together with corresponding observations of the values of
    a target variable t ≡ (t1,…, tN)T, where ti may take one of |C| discrete values
    [C1, C2,.., C|C|], our goal is to use the training set to train a model that correctly
    predicts the class of some new observation X’. There are many types of classification
    models, including decision trees (Mitchell 1997, pp. 52–59), support vector machines
    (SVM) (Liu 2011, pp. 109–116), logistic regression (Mitchell 1997, pp. 205–207),
    and Bayesian procedures (Mitchell 1997, pp. 154–164). In this study, a particular
    classification algorithm, called boosted trees classifiers (BTC), is used. This
    algorithm is an extension of GBRT, discussed above, to classification problems
    (Mease et al. 2007). That is, instead of iteratively improving a regression tree
    model, a decision tree classifier is iteratively improved, by combining base-decision
    tree classifiers using the gradient boosting technique. Development of ML models
    Platform For the data analysis and model development, graphLab create of the Turi
    2 machine learning platform was used. GraphLab create is a python-based ML framework,
    which enables the development and deployment of intelligent applications and services.
    It includes libraries for data transformation and manipulation, as well as scalable
    ML toolkits for creating, evaluating, and visualizing ML models. It is built to
    handle large volumes of data (terabytes) efficiently and quickly. Selection of
    ML models For the development of the irrigation recommendation prediction model,
    different types of ML algorithms were examined: linear regression, regression
    trees, and classification algorithms. To select the particular algorithms for
    use in this study, a basic comparison process was carried out: First the integrated
    dataset was divided into training (70%) and test (30%) sets; Second, different
    ML algorithms were applied (with their default settings) on the training set to
    train different ML models; Finally, the performance of the resulting models were
    examined on the test-set and compared to one another. For regression trees, the
    following models were considered: Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression,
    and GBRT. The best model among these, in terms of RSME, was GBRT. Linear regression
    was selected as well due to its high interpretability and prevalence in the literature.
    For classification, the following classification models were compared: logistic
    classifier, decision tree classifier, random forest cassifier, and BTC. The best
    classier among these, in terms of classification accuracy, was BTC. Thus, three
    ML models were developed: Linear regression, BTC, and GBRT. Each of these models
    was developed on eight different subsets of the feature-set in order to find the
    best model. Using the entire set of features to develop a single model may lead
    to overfitting (Mitchell 1997, p. 67) and to models that are more difficult to
    explain. In addition, because of correlations among many of the features, it was
    necessary to search for the best subset of features, as described in the following
    section. Feature selection In ML, feature selection is the process of selecting
    a subset of the relevant features (i.e. the variables listed in Table 1) for use
    in model construction. For feature selection, the correlation between each pair
    of variables was first estimated. As could be expected, correlations among the
    different meteorological features were very high (for example, weekly averages
    and preceding-day averages were correlated for each of the measures, with correlation
    values exceeding 0.85), as were the correlations among sensor-related features
    (e.g. the correlations between saturation/drought durations and soil moisture
    levels were higher than 0.7). By contrast, the correlations between sensor- and
    meteorology-related features were relatively low (lower than 0.1). Thus, three
    groups of optional variables were defined: (1) IPPD weather (including average
    temperature, radiation, and humidity measured on the day preceding irrigation
    planning); (2) weather forecast (predicted temperature, radiation, and humidity
    for the following week); and (3) saturation/drought durations over the preceding
    week. Because each of these three variable groups could be either included or
    not in the feature set, eight (23) feature subsets were defined, as shown in Table
    2. Of the variables listed in Table 1, those that are not listed in Table 2 were
    included in all subsets. Each of the three ML models mentioned above was developed
    for each of the eight feature-subsets. Table 2 Feature sets for which ML models
    were developed Full size table Model evaluation measurements In the next section,
    the resulting models are presented and their ability to predict irrigation quantities
    (i.e. their ability to recommend a suitable irrigation plan) is evaluated. For
    the evaluation of regression models (linear regression and GBRT), successful predictions
    were defined as those in which the predicted value was not more than 0.2 mm below
    or above the actual value. To use classification (BTC), the dependent variable
    has to be categorical. The continuous irrigation variable was therefore binned
    into five classes, described in Table 3, which best captured the variance in this
    variable. These classes were then used as the predicted variable in BTC models.
    Successful prediction were defined as those in which classification was made to
    the correct irrigation class. Table 3 Irrigation classes Full size table Results
    Linear regression Linear regression was used with the eight datasets defined in
    Table 2. Each dataset was randomly divided into training and test sets, such that
    the training set contained 70% of the samples. Table 4 summarizes the performance
    of the eight linear regression models, showing for each the RSME, maximal error,
    maximal deviation rate (error/true value), and rate of successful predictions
    (those within a 0.2 mm deviation), in total and for each plot. Table 4 Performance
    of the simple linear regression models for the different datasets Full size table
    As can be seen in Table 4, Set 2 achieved the best results in terms of RSME (although
    RSME values for other models were quite similar), and Set 6 achieved the highest
    overall success rate (although a value of 52.3% success is considered relatively
    low). Table A1 (Appendix) presents the learned coefficients of the model developed
    for Set 2, which had the lowest RSME. Due to the relatively low success rates
    of the simple linear regression models, regression models that aimed at capturing
    non-linear relationships between the independent variables and the dependent variable
    were also developed. For example, when plotting irrigation amounts against the
    temperature measured on the day preceding irrigation planning (Fig. 3), it can
    be seen that a square root function (√x) may better describe the relationship
    between irrigation and IPPD temperature. As another example, when plotting irrigation
    amounts against the week number, as shown in Fig. 4, it is easy to see that a
    quadratic function (x2) would be more suitable to describe the relationship. Fig.
    3 Irrigation against temperature measured on IPPD Full size image Fig. 4 Irrigation
    against week number Full size image Therefore, for each numeric feature x in the
    dataset, four new features were added: √x, x2, x3, and x4. The corresponding eight
    feature subsets were defined as before, but each subset was extended with the
    polynomial features. The linear regression algorithm was applied on each subset,
    resulting in eight new polynomial regression models. The performance measures
    of these models are summarized in Table 5. Table 5 Performance measures of the
    polynomial regression models Full size table Adding polynomial features improved
    the ability of the models to predict irrigation levels. The model for Set 5 (no
    drought/saturation data) achieved the lowest RSME value (0.38), which was superior
    to the lowest RSME value achieved without polynomial features (0.47 for Set 2).
    The highest total success rate with polynomial features was 62.8%, compared to
    52.3% without them, and the smallest maximal error without polynomial features
    was 2.02, compared to 2.32 without them. While adding polynomial features improved
    the prediction ability of the models to some extent, it had the negative implication
    of increasing the complexity of the model due to the addition of features (e.g.
    the model for Set 5 had 63 features). LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection
    operator), a method that performs both feature selection and regularization to
    enhance both the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the regression model
    (Zou 2006), was employed to eliminate variables. Its use, however, did not improve
    the performance of any of the models in terms of RSME and success rate. Gradient
    boosted regression trees Eight GBRT models were trained on the eight feature-sets
    (Set1–Set8), defined in Table 2. Each dataset was randomly divided into training
    and test sets, such that the training set contained 70% of the samples. Each model
    comprised a sequence of decision tree models. An example of one such tree appears
    in Fig. 5, which depicts one sub-tree of a collection of 50 trees that were learned
    for Set 2. The performance measures of GBRT models are summarized in Table 6.

    image Table 6 Performance measures of GBRT models Full size table Compared to
    the linear regression models, GBRT models achieved considerably better results:
    the model for Set 1 achieved the lowest RSME (0.11), and the models for Set 1
    and Set 5 achieved the best success rate (92.7%). In other words, GBRT models
    were able predict the correct irrigation levels in 92.7% of the cases. The model
    for Set 1 also achieved the lowest maximal error, 0.64, with a maximal deviation
    rate of 21.5%. Set 2, which included no previous-day weather features, and Set
    4, which included no weather forecast features, had the lowest success rates.
    Boosted trees classifier The BTC, provided by GraphLab Create, was used with the
    different feature sets. Again, the training set included 70% of the samples, which
    were randomly selected. Each of the resulting models comprised a collection of
    trees that were learned on the basis of the corresponding set of features. Five
    classes were defined, corresponding to the five irrigation classes in Table 3.
    Table 7 summarizes the performance measures of the different classification models.
    The table includes measures that are different from those of the regression models:
    accuracy—the number of correct predictions out of the total number of predictions;
    precision—the average percentage of correctly classified items for all classes;
    recall—the average percentage of items classified as x out of the actual x items;
    F1-Score—a score that combines recall and precision, such that \\(F1 = \\frac{2
    \\cdot precision \\cdot recall }{precision + recall}\\); and the precision and
    recall of each class separately (rate of correctly classified items). Table 7
    Performance measures of BTC models Full size table The results show that the model
    for Set 1 (based on the entire feature-set) outperformed the other models in almost
    all performance measures. Table 8 presents the performance of the classifier for
    this set, by showing the distribution of predicted labels against actual labels
    (confusion matrix). Table 8 Confusion matrix of the model for Set 1 Full size
    table Figure 6 depicts the average success rates of GBRT and BTC models in each
    week. In can be seen in this figure that between weeks 34 and 40, there was a
    period of five weeks in which the success rate dropped for both models. The agronomist
    confirmed that the land was deliberately and forcefully dried during that period,
    because the Jojoba fruits were being collected around that time by combines that
    were unable to operate efficiently unless the soil was dry. Fig. 6 Average success
    rate of GBRT and BTC models per week Full size image The success rate values of
    linear regression (polynomial), GBRT and BTC models for each feature-set (Set
    1–Set 8) are summarized in Fig. 7. The best success rates among the BTC models
    (95% for Set 1) and among the GBRT models (92.7% for both Set 1 and Set 6) were
    significantly higher than the best success rate among the linear regression models
    (62.8% for ‘Set 5’). Fig. 7 Success rate of different models Full size image Discussion
    Comparing the results for the three ML techniques reveals that the non-parametric
    techniques, GBRT and BTC, achieve significantly better performance measures than
    linear regression, even after the inclusion of polynomial features as predicting
    variables. While it may be more difficult to interpret the non-parametric techniques,
    they are found in this study to be better for predicting irrigation. In general,
    tree-based models perform better than linear regression models when the relationship
    between the independent variables and the dependent variable is non-linear and
    non-monotonic. Therefore, it can be assumed that GBRT models would outperform
    linear regression models in predicting the recommended irrigation amounts of other
    crops, for which these amounts are affected by similar independent variables.
    These results conform to previous results by Hedley et al. (2013), who showed
    that random forest models (similar to GBRT and BTC, these are ensembles of decision
    trees) achieved superior predictions of soil moisture and water table depth than
    linear regression models. The results received in this study also conform to results
    by Andriyas and McKee (2013), who used different tree-based models for predicting
    a farmer’s decision of whether to irrigate or not, and showed that tree-based
    models were suitable for prediction farmer’s decisions of whether to irrigate
    or not with above 97% success rates for all decision tree models used. While BTC
    models achieve slightly better results than GBRT models (95 compared to 92.7%,
    respectively), GBRT models are recommended for predicting irrigation amounts because
    of their ability to provide accurate values (BTC models can only classify into
    classes). Reflecting on the results of GBRT models, it is interesting to see that
    while Set 1 achieved the best results in general (minimal RSME of 0.113, maximal
    error of 0.645, and success rate of 92.7%), Set 5, which included no saturation/drought
    data, achieved almost as good results (RSME of 0.116 and maximal error of 0.675).
    The same is true for the polynomial linear regression, where Set 5 achieved the
    best RSME. These findings raise questions about the importance of incorporating
    drought/saturation data in the model. When examining success rates, it is also
    interesting to see that Set 6, with included neither drought/saturation data nor
    IPPD weather data, achieved success rates that were similar to those of Set 1
    (92.7%). Questions on the importance of the different variables become even more
    interesting when considering the results for particular plots. For example, it
    can be seen in Table 6 that for plot ‘2004 east’, which is organic, Set 6 achieved
    the best prediction success rate. Set 1 achieved the best results for plot ‘2002’,
    and Sets 3 and 5 achieved the best results for plot ‘1999 seeds’. These findings
    imply that a contingency approach, by which different feature-sets are used for
    different plots, may prove to be the most valuable. Examining the success rates
    of GBRT and BTC models for Set 1 along the weeks of the year (Fig. 6) reveals
    that while both models achieved 100% accuracy in most weeks (more than 40 weeks
    of the year), there were a few occasional weeks, in which the accuracy of one
    of the models dropped. This finding suggests that it is beneficial to consider
    the results of both models when deciding on irrigation. When the results of one
    model contradict those of the other, it is worthwhile to involve an agronomist
    in resolving the discrepancies. In addition, there was a period of time (5 weeks
    starting at the end of August) in which the accuracy of both models dropped to
    50–80% due to deliberate and forceful soil drying, as noted above. It is expected
    that if data are collected over a longer period of time, this deliberate drying
    will be taken into account by the models. The high prediction success rates of
    GBRT and BTC models (93 and 95%, respectively) suggest that they indeed can serve
    to facilitate and even automate irrigation decisions. The agronomist can use the
    models developed in this study instead of analyzing data from different plots
    and subplots, including weather data and forecasts, on a weekly basis. With time,
    as more data samples are collected, the prediction errors are expected to decrease
    and the models are expected to produce decisions that are identical to those of
    the agronomist. For the agronomist to be able to effectively use these models
    for irrigation planning, they should be incorporated in a DSS that receives inputs
    from the uMANAGE system and from the meteorological services, that processes the
    inputs to fit the dataset structure described in Table 1 (this could be done on
    a daily basis—every day an observation that represents data of the previous seven
    days is added to the dataset), and that uses the models to predict the required
    irrigation quantities for the latest observation. Such a DSS would enable to increase
    the frequency of irrigation decisions so that decisions are based on more recent
    and accurate data and are able, for example, to better handle unexpected changes
    of weather. As discussed in the \" Introduction\" sect., the literature includes
    various models for irrigation decision support. While many of the existing models
    support farmers’ decisions by providing the farmer with simple water balance models
    (e.g. based on the Penman–Monteith equation) subjected to capacity constraints
    and by allowing the farmer to simulate different irrigation alternatives and assess
    their implications, the models developed in this study follow a different approach—they
    capture the actual decision-making process of the farmer. This approach has been
    used for example by Labbé et al. (2000), who modeled the decision making process
    of farmers for limited water allocation and irrigation scheduling for corn, based
    on surveys of farmers and based on monitoring their irrigation practices during
    a period of two years. Instead of manually modeling the decision making process
    of farmers by surveying them and observing their behavior, in this study, ML was
    used to automatically learn their decision-making process from past irrigation
    decisions. The development of ML-based models requires considerably less effort
    than manually modeling the decision-making process, without compromising prediction
    accuracy. In fact, the GBRT models provided even better results in terms of average
    prediction error (the GBRT model for Set 1 achieved an RSME of 0.113 mm, which
    reflected an average error rate of 5.3%—less than an error rate of 6.7% achieved
    by Labbé et al. 2000). This study also advances the literature by taking into
    account farmer considerations that are plot-specific, suggesting that plot-specific
    data allows for plot-specific decisions. As noted above, a similar approach to
    ours was taken by Andriyas and McKee (2013), who used tree-based classification
    models for modeling the farmer’s decision of whether or not to irrigate alfalfa,
    barley, and corn. The models developed in this study advance the state-of-the-art
    by predicting irrigation amounts and not only the binary irrigation decision.
    This study demonstrated how in-field sensor data can be used not only for monitoring
    and control, but also for developing ML-based prediction models for Jojoba irrigation
    decisions. Irrigation prediction is just one area in which in-field sensor data
    can be used for prediction. Other areas are yield prediction and disease prediction,
    which, so far, have been mainly predicted using remote sensing and image processing.
    In the future, the development of a Jojoba yield prediction model is planned,
    using an approach similar to the one presented in this paper, but with yield as
    the target variable. To accomplish that, however, data describing subplots at
    a seasonal granularity, along with the yield per subplot, should be collected
    for at least ten years. In addition, application of ML techniques may reveal disease-potential
    situations and may assist in their prevention. For example, by analyzing in-field
    sensor data, it was already discovered that when the air temperature equals to
    the dew point temperature for several continuous hours, there is a high chance
    for fungal infection development in the following days. Thus, when such situations
    are identified they are immediately treated with pesticides to prevent disease
    development. The last two examples demonstrates the potential advantages of applying
    ML on in-field sensor data, together with additional data, for prediction purposes.
    As opposed to remote sensors, which can be seen as direct proxies of symptoms
    (e.g. plant disease or decrease in yield), soil and plant sensors serve as proxies
    of the actual state of the plant and soil, and they can reflect the causes for
    symptoms at real time. Consequently, models that are based on such data can predict
    diseases or yield decrease at earlier stages. Conclusions The objective of this
    study was to develop a model that captures the agronomist’s irrigation planning
    process and that predicts his irrigation recommendations. This objective was achieved
    by applying ML on a dataset that integrated data from different sources. The dataset
    captured various sensor-based features, weather features, and features describing
    plots, in addition to irrigation levels that were determined by the agronomist.
    Based on this comprehensive dataset, different irrigation recommendation prediction
    models were developed, using three ML approaches: the traditional linear regression
    and two non-parametric approaches, GBRT and BTC. The models were trained against
    eight different feature subsets (as described in Table 2). The results showed
    that non-parametric models, namely GBRT and BTC models, were more accurate in
    predicting irrigation decisions than linear regression models, with success rates
    of 93 and 95%, respectively. In addition, GBRT and BTC models, compared to linear
    regression, required fewer transformations to capture non-linear relations among
    variables. The models they provided, however, were more difficult to interpret,
    as they included fifty decision trees. Although the GBRT and BTC models developed
    for the entire feature set (Set 1) provided the best results, it was shown that
    the GBRT model for Set 6 had the same success rate as that for Set 1, possibly
    indicating that drought/saturation and IPPD weather data could be excluded from
    the dataset with little loss in accuracy. In addition, it was shown that different
    sets of features achieved the best results for different plots, suggesting that
    more fine-grained data can improve decision making by providing the infrastructure
    for more fine-grained decisions on irrigation. The contribution of this study
    is threefold. First, the study explicates the tacit knowledge that guides the
    abstract decision-making process of the agronomist. The resulting model can serve
    to automate the irrigation decision-making process. A common approach by farmers
    to decide on irrigation amounts is to use the Penman–Monteith equation (Allen
    1998), which approximates net evapotranspiration (ET). However, since all the
    equation parameters are measured by the meteorological station for the entire
    land, the agronomist can calculate a single ET value for all plots, which would
    lead to a single irrigation recommendation for all plots. The agronomist of Jojoba
    Israel combines this ET value in his irrigation decision process with other measured
    parameters and plot-related features to define plot-specific irrigation quantities,
    resulting in different irrigation quantities for different subplots. This decision
    process is now captured by the developed models, which may increase the efficiency
    of the agronomist by automating or semi-automating the irrigation planning process
    and by obviating the need to analyze plant and soil data, plot by plot, on a weekly-basis.
    Modeling the decision-making process of the agronomist enables to replicate it
    to additional orchards or to perform it more frequently without additional effort.
    Second, by developing models with different subsets of features, it was possible
    to derive insights about the different features and their contribution to the
    prediction model. In particular, it was shown that feature sets that included
    no data on drought/saturation and IPPD weather performed at least as well as feature
    sets that included all available data, calling into question the value of these
    data for predicting irrigation amounts. Additionally, it was shown that different
    feature sets were optimal for different plots, suggesting that it might be useful
    to develop unique models for different plots. Third, this work generated insights
    on the suitability of different ML models for the irrigation planning problem,
    showing that non-parametric models, based on gradient boosting, achieved much
    better results than the traditional linear regression. Altogether, these three
    contributions represent an approach that can be applied to additional crops, as
    well as to additional decision-making processes in agriculture (e.g. fertilization
    and pest-control decisions). Notes https://www.netafim.com/product-category/umanage.

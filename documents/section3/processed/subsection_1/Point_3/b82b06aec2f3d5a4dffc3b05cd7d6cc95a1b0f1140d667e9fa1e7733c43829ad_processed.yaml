    depend on the efficient mission-critical voice and data communication between
    first responders and victims. Land mobile radio system (LMRS) is a legacy narrowband
    technology used for critical voice communications with limited use for data applications.
    Recently, long term evolution (LTE) emerged as a broadband communication technology
    that has a potential to transform the capabilities of public safety technologies
    by providing broadband, ubiquitous, and mission-critical voice and data support.
    For example, in the United States, FirstNet is building a nationwide coast-to-coast
    public safety network based on LTE broadband technology. This paper presents a
    comparative survey of legacy and the LTE-based public safety networks, and discusses
    the LMRS-LTE convergence as well as mission-critical push-to-talk over LTE. A
    simulation study of LMRS and LTE band class 14 technologies is provided using
    the NS-3 open source tool. An experimental study of APCO-25 and LTE band class
    14 is also conducted using software-defined radio to enhance the understanding
    of the public safety systems. Finally, emerging technologies that may have strong
    potential for use in public safety networks are reviewed. Published in: IEEE Communications

    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction Public safety organizations
    protect the well-being of the public in case of natural and man-made disasters,
    and are tasked with preparing for, planning for, and responding to emergencies.
    The emergency management agencies include law enforcement agencies, fire departments,
    rescue squads, emergency medical services (EMS), and other entities that are referred
    to as emergency first responders (EFR). The ability of EFR to communicate amongst
    themselves and seamlessly share critical information directly affects their ability
    to save lives. The communication technologies such as legacy radio system, commercial
    network (2G/3G), and broadband (LTE/WiFi) are largely used by the public safety
    organizations. Over the recent years, there has been increasing interest in improving
    the capabilities of public safety communications (PSC) systems. For example, in
    [1]–[3], efficient spectrum management techniques, allocation models, and infrastructure
    options are introduced for PSC scenarios. Reforms on PSC policy have been discussed
    in [4] and [5], which study the decoupling of spectrum licenses for spectrum access,
    a new nationwide system built on open standards with consistent architecture,
    and fund raising approach for the transition to a new nationwide system. As explained
    in [6], communication of time critical information is an important factor for
    emergency response. In [7] and [8], insights on cognitive radio technology are
    presented, which plays a significant role in making the best use of scarce spectrum
    in public safety scenarios. Integration of other wireless technologies into PSC
    is studied in [9], with a goal to provide faster and reliable communication capability
    in a challenging environment where infrastructure is impacted by the unplanned
    emergency events. A. Related Works and Contributions There have been relatively
    limited studies in the literature on PSC that present a comprehensive survey on
    public safety LMRS and LTE systems. Paulson and Schwengler [33], present a discussion
    on voice over LTE as an important aspect of PSC and then provide a high-level
    overview of LMRS and LTE technologies for their use in PSC scenario. Baldini et
    al. [34] and Haupt et al. [39] survey the status of various wireless technologies
    in public safety network (PSN), current regulatory standards, and the research
    activities that address the challenges in PSC. The ability of LTE to meet the
    PSN requirements, and classifying possible future developments to LTE that could
    enhance its capacity to provide the PSC is discussed in [35] and [63]. In this
    paper our focus is more on the comparative analysis of legacy and emerging technologies
    for PSC, when compared with the contributions in [33]–[35]. We take up the public
    safety spectrum allocation in the United States as a case study, and present an
    overview of spectrum allocation in VHF, UHF, 700 MHz, 800, MHz, 900 MHz, and 4.9
    GHz bands for various public safety entities. We also provide a holistic view
    on the current status of the broadband PSN in other regions such as the European
    Union, the United Kingdom, and Canada. We review the LTE-based FirstNet architecture
    in the United States, the convergence of LTE-LMR technologies, and support for
    mission-critical PTT over LTE, which are not addressed in earlier survey articles
    such as [33] and [34]. In addition, a unified comparison between LMRS and LTE-based
    PSN is undertaken in Section VII and Section VIII, which is not available in existing
    survey articles on PSC to our best knowledge. Study of LMRS and LTE band class
    14 is carried out using NS-3 simulations, and software-defined radio (SDR) measurement
    campaigns for LMRS and LTE band class 14 technologies are reported. Different
    than existing literature, we also provide a comprehensive perspective on how emerging
    wireless technologies can shape PSN and discuss open research problems. B. Outline
    of the Paper This survey article is organized as follows. Section II provides
    classification of PSN, related standards, and existing challenges in PSN. Section
    III summarizes public safety spectrum allocation in the United States, while Section
    IV studies the FirstNet as an example for LTE-based broadband PSN. Section V gives
    a synopsis of LTE and LMR convergence in terms of available equipment and framework.
    Subsequently, Section VI provides a brief overview of mission-critical communication
    over LTE based on Release 12 and 13 enhancements. Section VII introduces a comparison
    between LMRS and LTE systems explaining the various attributes of the spectrum,
    Section VIII provides a simulation study of LMRS and LTE, whereas Section IX furnishes
    the experimental study using software-defined radios. The potential of various
    emerging technologies for enhancing PSC capabilities are discussed in Section
    X. Current status of broadband PSNs in different regions of the world is discussed
    in Section XI. Section XII discusses the issues and possible research areas for
    different public safety technologies and Section XIII concludes the paper. Some
    of the key references to be studied in this survey related to LMRS, LTE, SDR,
    and emerging PSC technologies are classified in Table I, along with possible research
    directions. TABLE I Literature Overview on Existing and Emerging PSC Technologies
    and Open Research Directions SECTION II. Public Safety Networks A PSN is a dedicated
    wireless network used by emergency services such as police, fire rescue, and EMS.
    This network gives better situational awareness, quicker response time to the
    EFRs, and speed up the disaster response. The scope of a PSN can span over a large
    geographical area, with vital data flowing into broadband wireless mesh network
    such as Wi-Fi and LTE. The PSNs are also networked with mobile computing applications
    to improve the efficiency of the EFR and public well-being. In this article, we
    broadly classify PSNs into two categories: LMRS and broadband networks. APCO-25
    and TETRA suite of standards falls under LMRS network, while LTE-based broadband
    PSC network falls under broadband network. A. LMRS Network LMRS is a wireless
    communication system intended for terrestrial users comprised of portables and
    mobiles, such as two-way digital radios or walkie-talkies. LMRS networks and equipment
    are being used in military, commercial, and EFR applications as shown in Fig.
    1. The main goal of LMRS systems are to provide mission critical communications,
    to enable integrated voice and data communications for emergency response, and
    to maintain ruggedness, reliability, and interoperability. Fig. 1. An example
    for a LMRS network [180]. Show All APCO-25 and European Terrestrial Trunked Radio
    (TETRA) are widely used suite of standards for LMRS based digital radio communications.
    APCO-25 also known as Project 25 (P-25), and it is widely used by federal, state/province,
    and local public safety agencies in North America. The APCO-25 technology enables
    public safety agencies enabling them to communicate with other agencies and mutual
    aid response teams in emergencies. On the other hand, TETRA fulfills the same
    role for European and Asian countries. However, these two standards are not interoperable.

    in the market, while Fig. 3 showcases TETRA portable and mobile digital radios,
    procured from the product sheet and websites of the respective companies. Fig.

    APCO-25: Public safety radios have been upgraded from analog to digital since
    the 1990s due to the limitations of analog transmission, and implement technological
    advances by expanding the capabilities of digital radio. Radios can communicate
    in analog mode with legacy radios, and in either digital or analog mode with other
    APCO-25 radios. Additionally, the deployment of APCO-25 compliant systems will
    allow for a high degree of equipment interoperability and compatibility. APCO-25
    compliant technology has been deployed in three different phases, where advancements
    have been gradually introduced [181]. Ph. 1 In Phase 1, radio systems operate
    in 12.5 KHz band analog, digital, or mixed mode. Phase 1 radios use continuous
    4-level frequency modulation (C4FM) technique, which is a non-linear modulation
    for digital transmissions. C4FM is a special type of 4FSK modulation as explained
    in [45] and was developed for the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA)
    102 standard for digital transmission in 12.5 KHz. C4FM results in a bit rate
    of 9600 bits/s. Phase 1 P25-compliant systems are backward compatible and interoperable
    with legacy systems. P25-compliant systems also provide an open interface to the
    radio frequency (RF) subsystem to facilitate interlinking between different vendor
    systems. Ph. 2 With a goal of improving the spectrum utilization, Phase 2 was
    implemented. Phase 2 introduces a 2 -slot TDMA system which provides two voice
    traffic channels in a 12.5 KHz band allocation, and doubles the call capacity.
    It also lays emphasis on interoperability with legacy equipment, interfacing between
    repeaters and other subsystems, roaming capacity, and spectral efficiency/channel
    reuse. Ph. 3 Project MESA (Mobility for Emergency and Safety Applications) is
    a collaboration between the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI)
    and the TIA to define a unified set of requirements for APCO - 25 Phase 3. Initial
    agreement for project MESA was ratified in year 2000. Phase 3 planning activities
    address the need for high-speed data for public-safety use [181]. Project MESA
    also aims to facilitate effective, efficient, advanced specifications, and applications
    that will address public safety broadband communication needs [182]. 2) TETRA:
    TETRA is a digital mobile radio system, which is essentially confined to layers
    1-3 of the OSI model. The TETRA system is intended to operate in existing VHF
    and UHF professional mobile radio frequencies [183], and it has been developed
    by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). The user needs
    and technological innovations have led the TETRA standard to evolve with release
    1 and release 2 [183]. Rel. 1 Release 1 is the original TETRA standard, which
    was known as TETRA V+D standard. Under this release TETRA radio system supports
    three modes of operation which are voice plus data (V+D), direct operation mode
    (DMO), and packet data optimized (PDO) [184]. The V+D is the most commonly used
    mode, which allows switching between voice and data transmission. Voice and data
    can be transmitted on the same channel using different slots. The main characteristics
    of V+D are: 1) support for independent multiple concurrent bearer services, 2)
    support for transmitter preemption, 3) support for several grades of handover,
    4) crossed calls are minimized by labeling an event on the air interface, 5) support
    for slot stealing during voice/data transmission, 6) support for different simultaneous
    access priorities [184]. The DMO, on the other hand, supports direct voice and
    data transmission between the subscriber units without the base stations, especially
    when the users are in the outside coverage area. Calls in the DMO can be either
    clear or encrypted, and full duplex radio communication is not supported under
    DMO [185]. As a third mode of operation, the PDO standard has been created for
    occasional data-only, to cater the demands for high volume of data in near future.
    Location based services and voice are necessary for mission-critical communications
    and need high volume of data, which can be the beneficiaries of the PDO standard
    [185]. Rel. 2 Release 2 provided additional functions and improvements to already
    existing functionality of TETRA. The major enhancement provided by TETRA release
    2 is TETRA enhanced data services, which provides more flexibility and greater
    levels of data capacity [37]. With adaptive selection of modulation schemes, RF
    channel bandwidths, and coding user bit rates can vary between 10 Kbits/s to 500
    Kbits/s. Data rate plays a important role in relaying mission-critical information
    during the emergency situation in timely manner. For example, an emergency scenario
    monitoring a remote victim would require data rate to support real-time duplex
    voice/video communication and telemetry. In such a mission-critical scenario,
    TETRA enhanced data service would play an important role by supporting the applications
    that need high data rate such as multimedia and location services. Other TETRA
    improvements also include adaptive multiple rate voice codec, mixed excitation
    linear predictive enhanced voice codec, and trunked mode operation range extension,
    which extended the range for air-ground-air services to 83 kilometers when compared
    to 58 kilometers in TETRA release 1 [38]. B. LTE Broadband Network LTE is a broadband
    technology that will allow high data rate applications that are not possible to
    support with LMRS. LTE will enable unprecedented broadband service to public safety
    agencies and will bring the benefits of lower costs, consumer-driven economies
    of scale, and rapid evolution of advanced communication capabilities [53]. The
    Table II, showcases various potential wireless communication standards, that can
    be used for public safety broadband networks. LTE standard, is developed by the
    3GPP as a 4G broadband mobile communication technology. The main goal of LTE is
    to increase the capacity and high-speed data over wireless data networks. The
    technological advances has brought LTE to a performance level close to Shannon’s
    capacity bound [34]. Due to limited code block length in LTE, full SNR efficiency
    is not feasible. More specifically, LTE performance is less than 1.6 dB - 2 dB
    off from the Shannon capacity bound as discussed in [186]. With steady increase
    of investment in broadband services, the LTE technology is soon expected to become
    most widely deployed broadband communication technology ever. An LTE-based broadband
    PSN, dedicated solely for the use of PSC can deliver the much needed advanced
    communication and data capabilities. As an example for LTE-based PSN, we briefly
    study FirstNet deployment in the United States in Section IV. TABLE II Emerging
    Wireless Broadband Communication Technologies for Creating a PSN [62]. QoS Stands
    for Quality of Service, Where as CQI for Channel Quality Indicator C. Major Challenges
    in PSNs Even with several technical advancements in PSN, there are major challenges
    that can hinder efficient operation of EFR. For instance, during a large-scale
    disaster, different public safety organizations are bound to use different communications
    technologies and infrastructure at the same time. This can cause major challenges
    such as, network congestion, low data rates, interoperability problems, spectrum
    scarcity, and security problems. 1) Network Congestion: In the case of an emergency,
    network activity spikes up, causing traffic congestion in public safety and commercial
    networks. Many EFR agencies using IP-based the commercial data services in case
    of emergency would result in a competition of air time with the general public
    [36]. The probability of any natural or man-made emergency can be assumed as a
    discrete random event. In case of such events, providing reliable communication
    becomes critical. Therefore, ensuring that network congestion will not happen
    in public safety networks during emergency situations is becoming increasingly
    more important. Emerging technologies such as licensed assisted access (LAA) of
    LTE to the unlicensed bands, small cells, and UAVs can be used as supplementary
    solutions during emergency situations to reduce the impact of network congestion
    [145]–[147]. Furthermore, addressing the open challenges in the field of mmWave,
    massive MIMO, and vehicular network system can further help to lower the network
    congestion. Nevertheless, effective mitigation of network congestion problems
    during emergency situations remains an open issue. 2) Maintaining Ubiquitous Throughput
    and Connectivity: The data rate plays a critical role in relaying the information
    (i.e., voice and data) during the emergency situation in a timely manner. For
    example, an emergency scenario monitoring a remote victim would require data rate
    to support real-time duplex voice/video communication, telemetry, and so forth.
    Another example needing a real-time situational awareness is during fires for
    firefighters, through the use of streaming video and mission critical voice/data.
    These examples of mission-critical scenarios as per [4] would need higher data
    rates and require broadband allocation of spectrum. Lower data rate limits the
    usage of data applications, such as multimedia services which have a great potential
    to improve the efficiency of disaster recovery operations [42], [187]. The traditional
    public safety systems was designed to provide better coverage, mission-critical
    voice, but not peak data capacity. With the advent of 3GPP specifications, the
    data rates have been steadily increasing and will help in enhancing the capabilities
    of PSC systems. These data rates can be further increased by making technologies
    such as mmWave and massive MIMO commercially available. However, 3GPP systems
    deliver less coverage area when compared to LMRS. Furthermore, they can also experience
    relatively low data rates and dropped communications at the cell-edge. The coverage
    and fringe condition in LTE-based PSN can be addressed by the deployment of UAVs
    or vehicular network system to set up a small cell or virtual cell site. Regardless
    of the advancements in PSC, maintaining ubiquitously high throughput and connectivity
    during the emergency situation is still a challenge. 3) Interoperability: Traditionally,
    interoperability of a radio network means coordinating operating parameters and
    pre-defined procedures between the intended operators in the network. As discussed
    in [31], the interoperability failure that occurred during the September 11, 2001
    incident was due to the presence of various independent public safety agencies,
    which resulted in entanglement of systems that were not interoperable. This led
    to communication failures between various EFRs, and posed a risk to public lives.
    A possible solution for avoiding any potential interoperability issue includes
    EFR carrying multiple devices to be effective, which is an expensive strategy
    and an inefficient use of spectrum resources. Alternatively, communication infrastructure
    and policies can be evolved for EFR which is a more efficient approach. As per
    [32], FCC is taking steps in resolving the lack of interoperability in 700 MHz
    band in a cost-effective manner by leveraging on commercial technologies and infrastructure.
    SECTION III. Public Safety Spectrum Allocation in the United States Public safety
    operations can be classified mainly based on the applications and usage scenarios,
    such as mission-critical, military, transportation, utilities, and corporations
    with large geographical footprint. In this section, we provide a comprehensive
    overview of VHF, UHF, 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, and 4.9 GHz public safety band
    plans and spectrum allocation in the United States. The Federal Communications
    Commission (FCC) in the United States is a regulatory body for regulating communication
    by radios, television, wire, satellite, and cable. The FCC has taken steps to
    ensure that 911 and other critical communication remain operational when a disaster
    strikes. A major goal of FCC is to enable an operable and interoperable public
    safety communications (PSC) system in narrowband and broadband spectrum [20].
    A. 700 MHz Public Safety Spectrum The 700 MHz spectrum auction by FCC is officially
    know as Auction 73 [15]. The signals in 700 MHz spectrum travel longer distances
    than other typical cellular bands, and penetrate well. Therefore the 700 MHz band
    is an appealing spectrum to build systems for both commercial and PSN networks.
    Fig. 4a, Fig. 4b, Fig. 5, and along with Table III depict the spectrum allocated
    in the 700 MHz band in the United States. The lower 700 MHz range covers channels
    (CH) 52-59 and 698-746 MHz frequency, while the upper 700 MHz range covers CH
    60-69 and 746-806 MHz frequency. The 3GPP standards have created four different
    band classes within 700 MHz band, i.e., band class 12, 13, 14, and 17. TABLE III
    Spectrum Allocation of 700 MHz: Band Class 12, 13, 14, and 17 [188] Fig. 4. 700
    MHz band plan for public safety services in the United States. A, B, C, and D
    denote different bands in the 700 MHz spectrum. Show All Fig. 5. Band class 14
    plan for public safety services. D block will be reallocated for use by public
    safety entities as directed by Congressional mandate [20]. 758 MHz - 768 MHz would
    be the downlink and 788 MHz - 798 MHz would be uplink public safety frequency
    allocation in band class 14. Bands A and B are the guard bands of 1 MHz each.
    Show All Under the current framework, 20 MHz of dedicated spectrum is allocated
    to PSN in the 700 MHz band as shown in Fig. 2. Green color blocks represent public
    safety broadband ranging from 758 MHz to 768 MHz with 763 MHz as the center frequency
    and 788 MHz to 798 MHz with 793 MHz as the center frequency. Narrowband spectrum
    is represented in orange color blocks ranging from 769 MHz to 775 MHz and 799
    MHz to 805 MHz. This part of 700 MHz public safety band is available for local
    public safety entity for voice communication. Guard bands (GB) of 1 MHz are placed
    between broadband, narrowband and commercial carrier spectrum to prevent any interference.
    A part of the 700 MHz public safety narrowband spectrum is also available for
    nationwide interoperable communications. In particular, interoperability is required
    to enable different governmental agencies to communicate across jurisdictions
    and with each other, and it is administered at state level by an executive agency
    [189]. The deployment strategy of EFR varies depending on the magnitude of the
    emergency. As the emergency grows, the demand for additional tactical channels
    would grow too. These tactical channels would render necessary short-range communications
    at the emergency scene, without taxing the main dispatch channels. This implies
    the need for additional bandwidth allocation to EFR. However, before reallocation
    of D block, there was none to little bandwidth available for PSC in 700 MHz spectrum.
    The only option for the EFR would be to use commercial network for PSC. However,
    commercial networks are not fully capable of mission-critical communication. Therefore,
    the full allocation of D Block, i.e., 20 MHz of 700 MHz was critical to public
    safety [16]. With reallocation of the D Block to public safety, LTE-based PSN
    in the 700 MHz would be beneficial to both commercial and PSN. Conversely, the
    interoperability and roaming between a commercial and PSN during the emergencies
    without seriously compromising quality of service for commercial users is an ongoing
    discussion [17]. B. 800 MHz Public Safety Spectrum The 800 MHz public safety band
    is currently configured as illustrated in Fig. 6. It houses public safety spectrum
    allocation, commercial wireless carriers, and private radio systems. National
    Public Safety Planning Advisory Committee (NPSPAC) has come up with guidelines
    for 800 MHz band and has uplink channels allocated in 806 MHz - 809 MHz and downlink
    in 851 MHz - 854 MHz. Various regional public safety planning committees administer
    800 MHz NPSPAC spectrum. Specialized mobile radio (SMR) and enhanced specialized
    mobile radio (ESMR) can be either analog or digital trunked two-way radio system.
    SMR channels are allocated in 809 MHz - 815 MHz and downlink in 854 MHz - 860
    MHz. Expansion band (EB) and GB are of 1 MHz each, which are allocated between
    815 MHz - 817 MHz. The ESMR channels are allocated in the 817 MHz - 824 MHz uplink

    Spectrum The FCC allows utilities and other commercial entities to file licenses
    in 900 MHz business and industrial land transport (B/ILT) and the 900 MHz spectrum
    band plan is shown in Fig. 7. The new licenses in the 900 MHz B/ILT band are now
    allowed on a site-by-site basis for base mobile operator for various commercial
    (manufacturing, utility, and transportation) and non-commercial (medical, and
    educational) activities [20], [21]. Fig. 7. SMR, industrial, scientific and medical
    (ISM), paging, and fixed microwave are the radio bands in 900 MHz spectrum plan
    [26], [191]. Show All D. VHF and UHF Public Safety Spectrum All public safety
    and business industrial LMRS are narrowbands and operate using 12.5 KHz technology
    [20]. The operating frequencies for VHF low band ranges between 25 MHz - 50 MHz,
    VHF high band between 150 MHz - 174 MHz, and UHF band between 421 MHz - 512 MHz
    [20]. Licensees in the private land mobile VHF and UHF bands have previously operated
    on channel bandwidth of 25 KHz. As of January 1, 2013 FCC has mandated that all
    existing licenses in VHF and UHF bands must operate on 12.5 KHz channel bandwidth.
    Narrowbanding of VHF and UHF bands has ensured channel availability, and creation
    of additional channel capacity within the same radio spectrum. Narrowbanding will
    result in efficient use of spectrum, better spectrum access for public safety
    and non-public safety users, and support more users [21]–[23]. Previously, the
    frequencies from 470 MHz - 512 MHz were designated as UHF-TV sharing frequencies
    and were available in certain limited areas of the United States. Public safety
    in urbanized area such as Boston (MA), Chicago (IL), Cleveland (OH), Dallas/Fort
    Worth (TX), Detroit (MI), Houston (TX), Los Angeles (CA), Miami (FL), New York
    (NY), Philadelphia (PA), San Francisco/Oakland (CA), and Washington DC were allowed
    to share UHF-TV frequencies and were governed by FCC rules 90.301 through 90.317.
    However, as of February 22, 2012 legislation was enacted to reallocate spectrum
    in the D Block within the 700 MHz band for public safety broadband operation.
    The legislative act prompted FCC to impose a freeze on new T-Band licenses or
    any modifications to existing licenses. Furthermore, public safety operation is
    needed to vacate the T-Band spectrum by the year 2023 [27]. E. 4.9 GHz Public
    Safety Spectrum In year 2002, FCC allocated 50 MHz of spectrum in the 4940 MHz
    - 4990 MHz band (i.e., 4.9 GHz band) for fixed and mobile services. This band
    supports a wide variety of broadband applications such as Wireless LAN for incident
    scene management, mesh network, WiFi hotspots, VoIP, temporary fixed communications,
    and permanent fixed point-to-point video surveillance [21], [28]–[30]. Table IV,
    illustrates the public safety spectrum bands, frequencies and the respective users
    as an example in the state of Florida. TABLE IV Public Safety Spectrum Bands,
    Frequency, and the Respective Users in the State of Florida. Primary Control Channels
    are Denoted by (c) and Alternate Control Channels by (a) [24], [25], [27] SECTION
    IV. LTE-Based FirstNet PSN In January 26, 2011, the FCC in the United States adopted
    a Third Report and Order and Fourth Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (FNPRM).
    In the third report and order, the FCC mandates the 700 MHz public safety broadband
    network operators to adopt LTE (based of 3GPP Release 8 specifications) as the
    broadband technology for nationwide public safety broadband network (NPSBN). The
    Fourth FNPRM focuses on the overall architecture and proposes additional requirements
    to promote and enable nationwide interoperability among public safety broadband
    networks operating in the 700 MHz band [18]. A. FirstNet Architecture As per [53],
    Fig. 8 shows the proposed FirstNet architecture. The FirstNet is a LTE-based broadband
    network dedicated to public safety services. Core features of FirstNet will include
    direct communication mode, push-to-talk (PTT), full duplex voice system, group
    calls, talker identification, emergency alerting, and audio quality. Band class
    14 (D Block and Public Safety Block) shown in Fig. 5 is the dedicated band and
    will be used by FirstNet PSN [54]. The FirstNet is composed of distributed core,
    terrestrial mobile system, mobile satellite system, and deployable systems. Distributed
    core consists of an evolved packet core (EPC) network and a service delivery platform
    to provide various services to end users such as EFR. The terrestrial mobile system
    comprises terrestrial based communication, while mobile satellite system will
    use a satellite communication link to communicate with distributed core network
    for services. Deployable systems are cells on wheels, providing services in network
    congestion areas or filling coverage holes. Fig. 8. FirstNet PSC architecture
    proposed by [67]. Show All In [138], FirstNet vehicular PSNs were divided into
    5 categories: vehicle network system (VNS), cells on light trucks (COLTS), cells
    on wheels (COW), system on wheels (SOW), and deployable aerial communications
    architecture (DACA). These different vehicular FirstNet PSN systems are expected
    to play a significant role in providing coverage extension for NPSBN deployment.
    Thus, these deployments will deliver greater coverage, capacity, connectivity,
    and flexibility in regions which are outside of terrestrial coverage, or where
    traditional coverage become unavailable due to a natural or man-made disaster
    [33], [63]. Table V discusses the characteristics of the five different vehicular
    PSN architectures in FirstNet. TABLE V A Variety of Deployable Technologies for
    FirstNet [138] As per [53], FirstNet broadly defines LTE network in distinct layers:
    Core network, transport backhaul, radio access network (RAN) and public safety
    devices as seen in Fig. 9. Public safety devices can be smartphones, laptops,
    tablets or any other LTE-based user equipment. RAN implements radio access technology,
    which conceptually resides between public safety devices and provides a connection
    to its CN. The transport backhaul comprises intermediate CN and subnetworks, wherein
    CN is the central part of a telecommunication network that provides various services
    to public safety devices across access network. Fig. 9. LTE band class 14 architecture
    for FirstNet [53]. Show All The band class 14 communication will be based on the
    LTE commercial standards and is solely dedicated to PSC in North America region.
    Table VI shows the available downlink and uplink frequencies and the E-UTRA Absolute
    Radio Frequency Channel Number (Earfcn) for a band class 14 system. As per 3GPP
    specifications, the carrier frequency is specified by an absolute radio-frequency
    channel number (ARFCN). The Earfcn is a designated code pair for physical radio
    carrier for both transmission and reception of the LTE system, i.e., one Earfcn
    for the uplink and one for the downlink. The Earfcn also reflects the center frequency
    of an LTE carriers, and falls within range of 0 to 65535. The bandwidth allocated
    for band class 14 is 10 MHz. TABLE VI Band Class 14 Parameters SECTION V. LMRS
    and LTE Convergence Since data is just as important as voice in PSC scenario,
    mission-critical voice and data communication together can deliver the much required
    reliable intelligence and support to EFR during any emergency [79]. For example,
    in the United States, FCC has been taking steps to achieve this LMRS-LTE convergence
    by setting various policies and a framework for a NPSBN. A private network like
    NPSBN would include FirstNet (a single licensed operator), 700 MHz band class
    14 (single frequency band), and LTE (a common operating technology). With large
    investment in LMRS over the last decade or so, LMRS has gained a national footprint
    in the United States [19]. During this time the United States has relied on LMRS
    technology to provide mission critical communication to the EFR. LTE deployments
    for replacing 2G and 3G infrastructure had no issues in relative measures, whereas
    the integration of LTE with LMRS is going to be a challenging task. As the complete
    roll out of the NPSBN by FirstNet would take few years to meet all mission-critical
    EFR requirements, it is inevitable for LMRS and LTE to coexist for some time in
    the near future. There are many deployment models available today for converging
    LMRS and LTE in PSC. This includes the combination of mission-critical radios
    on PSN, broadband devices on dedicated broadband networks, and consumer grade
    devices on commercial carriers. The major challenges would be 1) providing an
    efficient end-user experience to EFR using a multitude of different device, networks,
    and infrastructure and 2) sharing mission-critical information regardless of device
    or network, without compromising security. As a step towards the next generation
    public safety networks, Motorola Solutions has envisioned LMRS taking advantage
    of public and private LTE s. APX7000L, as shown in Fig. 6(b), is a portable APCO-25
    digital radio converged with LTE data capabilities in a public-safety-grade LMR
    handheld device [82]. In order to have a seamless transition between LMRS and
    broadband networks, Motorola VALR mission critical architecture is utilized [80].
    Harris Corporation’s VIDA mission-critical platform provides an ability to support
    narrowband and broadband PSC technologies [81] as illustrated in Fig. 10. Similarly,
    Etherstack’s LTE25 solution bridges LTE with existing APCO-25 narrowband networks
    with integrated push-to-talk solutions and interoperability in multi-vendor APCO-25/LTE
    networks [192]. These developments build flexibly on technological advances, without
    compromising requirements, security, and coverage need for mission-critical communication.
    The converged solutions and frameworks have a common goal to provide mission-critical
    solutions, location services, and priority/emergency call support. Fig. 10. VIDA
    from Harris Corporation is a converge platform that integrates legacy and broadband
    PSC into a core network [81]. Show All These devices, solutions, and frameworks
    would provide EFR, the most need continuous connection to mission-critical voice,
    and data communications, and would be a first step in providing a necessary infrastructure
    for NPSBN. The LMRS and LTE both have individual strengths, and their convergence
    would result in a nationwide PSN and therefore enable a better collaboration amongst
    EFR, interoperability, data capability, security, robust coverage, and provide
    mission critical communications. SECTION VI. Mission-Critical PTT Over LTE The
    main goal of mission-critical voice is to enable reliable communication between
    various EFR. The essential attributes of mission -critical voice is to enable
    fast-call setup and group communication amongst the EFR, push-to-talk for various
    group talks, high audio quality, emergency alerting, and support secure/encrypted
    voice communication. The mission -critical encryption uses data encryption standard
    (DES) and advanced encryption standard (AES) for over-the-air-rekeying application
    [65], [72]. To support mission-critical voice, LTE needs to incorporate all the
    essential attributes mentioned in this section. The objective of mission-critical
    PTT over LTE would be to emulate the functions by LMRS. The 3GPP group is actively
    working to produce technical enhancement for LTE that support public safety applications.
    The main objective of 3GPP is to protect the quality of LTE while including the
    features needed for public safety. In LTE Release 12, 3GPP has focused on two
    main areas to address public safety applications. These focus areas include proximity
    services (ProSe) that enable optimized communication between the mobiles in physical
    proximity and group call system that support operations such as one-to-many calling
    and dispatcher services which enable efficient and dynamic group communication
    [66]. Path (a) in Fig. 11 shows the current conventional LTE communication whereas
    a network assisted discovery of users in close physical proximity is shown in
    Fig. 11 path (c). The direct communication, between these users with or without
    the supervision of the network is illustrated in Fig. 11 as path (b). In direct
    communication a radio can establish a communication link between the mobile users
    without going through a network, thus saving network resources and also enable
    mission-critical communication amongst the EFR even outside the network coverage
    [66], [70], [71]. Fig. 11. Proximity service examples as proposed in 3GPP LTE
    Release 12 [66]. Path (a) shows current conventional LTE communication path, (b)
    shows direct communication with proximity services and (c) shows locally routed
    communication with proximity services. Show All The requirement definitions of
    mission-critical PTT over LTE are ongoing and will be finalized in LTE Release
    13, which will enhance the D2D/ProSe framework standardized in Release 12 and
    support more advanced ProSe for public safety applications [69], [77], [78]. Release
    12 added basic discovery and group communications functionality specific to D2D/ProSe.
    ProSe direct discovery, ProSe UE-to-network relay, ProSe UE-to-UE relay, and group
    communication among members via network, and a ProSe UE-to-network relay for public
    safety application will be included as part of Release 13 [77]. Isolated E-UTRAN
    operation for public safety is an another public safety feature included in Release
    13 specifications. It would support locally routed communications in E-UTRAN for
    nomadic eNodeBs operating without a backhaul for critical communication [77],
    as shown in Fig. 11. SECTION VII. Comparison of LMRS and LTE PSC The LMRS technology
    has been widely used in PSC for over a decade with significant technological advancements.
    On the other hand, with the emerging of the LTE push-to-talk technology, focus
    has been shifting towards high speed low latency LTE technology. With various
    advancements in commercial networks, it can be another possible viable solution
    for PSC. Consider an emergency scenario, where different public safety organization
    using different communications technologies arrive at the incident scene. As shown
    in Fig. 12, these public safety organizations can be using different types of
    PSNs. In particular, the PSN deployed in the United States is a mixture of LMRS,
    FirstNet, and commercial networks. The LMRS provides push-to-talk mission critical
    voice capability over narrowband, with restricted data rates for voice/data services.
    However, LMRS has a wide area coverage, which can be achieved through the deployment
    of high-power base stations and handsets, portable base stations, repeaters, and/or
    peer-to-peer communication [64]. FirstNet provides high-speed network and can
    transform EFR capabilities with real-time updates. EFR can still rely on LMRS
    for mission-critical voice communication alongside FirstNet for high-speed data.
    Fig. 12. Current PSN structure in the United States. Show All A. Network Architecture
    Commercial networks are IP-based technologies such as 2G/3G/4G/Wi-Fi. These technologies
    need adequate signal coverage and network scaling to support PSC services between
    EFR and victims. Due to existing commercial infrastructure, these networks are
    beneficial for providing PSC services. However, commercial networks are vulnerable
    to network congestion due to higher intensity of inbound and outbound communication
    at the incident scene by the public safety organizations and victims. Such vulnerability
    can result in disrupted communications services and bring harm to victims. System
    level block representation of the LMRS and LTE system are as shown in Fig. 13.
    The LMRS comprises of a mobile/portable subscriber units, repeater or a base station
    which is connected to an RF subsystem and then to a customer enterprise network.
    On other hand the LTE system includes user equipment (UE), eNodeB, and EPC which
    is connected to external Network. EPC, also known as system architecture evolution
    (SAE), may also contain several nodes. Key components of EPC are mobility management
    entity (MME), serving gateway (SGW), public data network gateway (PGW), and policy
    and charging rules function (PCRF). Fig. 13. System level representation of the
    LMRS and the LTE networks for PSC. Show All B. Channel Configuration and Frame
    Structure Channel configuration for the LMRS is shown in Fig. 14. In an LMRS the
    supported bandwidth are 6.25 KHz, 12.5 KHz, and 30 KHz, wherein 12.5 KHz is the
    standard bandwidth. The separation between two channels is usually 250 KHz or
    higher. The talkgroups channel assigned during a transmission can last for a duration
    between 2 to 5 seconds. The data channel has bandwidth of 12.5 KHz and is FDMA
    and/or TDMA channel. The data channel is designed with an aim to provide functionality
    like over the air rekeying, mission-critical voice etc,. On the other hand, the
    control channel is used solely for resource control. The main task for control
    channel is to allocate resources, digital communication message bearer, and message
    handler between RF subsystem and SU. The APCO-25 control channel uses C4FM modulation
    scheme and supports a baud rate of 9600 bits/s [46]. Fig. 14. APCO-25 channel
    configuration. Show All The LTE frame structure as seen in Fig. 15a, has one radio
    frame of 10 ms duration, 1 sub-frame 1 ms duration, and 1 slot of 0.5 ms duration.
    Each slot comprises of 7 OFDM symbols. The LTE UL and DL transmission is scheduled
    by resource blocks (RB). Each resource block is one slot of duration 0.5 ms, or
    180 KHz, and composed of 12 sub-carriers. Furthermore, one RB is made up of one
    slot in the time domain and 12 sub-carriers in the frequency domain. The smallest
    defined unit is a resource element, which consists of one OFDM subcarrier. Each
    UE can be scheduled in one or more RBs as shown in Fig. 15b. The control channel
    in LTE is provided to support efficient data transmission, and convey physical
    layer messages. LTE is provided with three DL physical control channels, i.e.,
    physical control format indicator channel, physical HARQ indicator channel, and
    physical downlink control channel. Physical uplink control channel is used by
    UE in UL transmission to transmit necessary control signals only in subframes
    in which UE has not been allocated any RBs for the physical uplink shared channel
    transmission. Physical downlink shared channel, physical broadcast channel, and
    physical multicast channel are the DL data channels, whereas physical uplink shared
    channel and physical random access channel are the UL data channels. Fig. 15.
    LTE channel configuration. Show All Some further differences between the LMRS
    and the LTE networks are summarized in Table VII [193]. TABLE VII Comparison Between
    the LMRS and the LTE System SECTION VIII. LMRS vs. LTE: Simulation Results The
    purpose of this section is to simulate LTE band class 14 system and APCO-25 using
    NS-3 open source tool. The LTE band class 14 simulation is based on LENA LTE model
    [73] whereas LMRS simulation is based on the definition of APCO-25 portrayed in
    [45]–[47], and [181]. We chose to use NS-3 simulator and LENA LTE model due to
    their effective characterization of LTE protocol details. In order to be consistent
    and to provide a better comparative analysis between LMRS and LTE band class 14,
    we implement a single cell scenario, and similar user density. The main simulation
    goal is to compute aggregated throughput capacity and signal quality measurement
    with increasing cell size in case of both LTE and LMRS. Simulation setup, assumptions,
    and simulation parameters for LTE band class 14 system and LMRS are discussed
    in Sections VIII-B and VIII-A, respectively. Furthermore, we analyze these simulation
    results in Section VIII-C to strengthen the conclusion of the comparative study.
    A. Setup for LTE Band Class 14 The simulation study of LTE band class 14 includes,
    throughput computation in uplink and downlink, cell signal quality measurement
    in terms of SINR, and measuring signal quality in a inter-cell interference scenario.
    Fig. 16 shows the throughput simulation environment implemented in this paper.
    Simulation environment consists of randomly placed multiple UEs and one eNodeB
    (eNB). Other environment entity includes remote host which provides service to
    end user. Remote host will provide IP-based services to UEs and user datagram
    protocol (UDP) application is installed on both the remote host and the UEs to
    send and receive a burst of packets. Fig. 16. LTE model for NS-3 simulations,
    based on the LENA project [73]. All the important details of the LTE PHY and MAC
    protocols are implemented in the NS-3 simulations. Show All 1) Simulation Scenario-Aggregate
    Throughput Computation: In this simulation scenario, we implement a macro-eNodeB
    site with a transmission power of 46 dBm . The simulation comprises 20 UEs being
    randomly distributed throughout the cell, which has transmission power of 23 dBm
    , and follows random walk 2D mobility model. The round robin MAC scheduler is
    used to distribute the resources equally to all the users. The communication channel
    included in the simulation is trace fading loss model in a pedestrian scenario.
    The LTE band class 14 simulation uses a bandwidth of 10 MHz and the frequency
    values is shown in Table VI. Result Observation: In this simulation scenario for
    data only transmission and reception, the aggregated DL throughput can be as large
    as 33 Mbit/s whereas the aggregated UL throughput can be as large as 11 Mbit/s
    as seen in Fig. 17. Furthermore, it is also observed that the throughput experience
    by the UEs is diminished as the distance the between the UE and macro-eNodeB increases.
    Fig. 17. Aggregated uplink and downlink throughput observed by 20 UEs in the LTE
    band class 14. UEs experience better throughput when in close proximity with macro-eNodeB.
    Show All 2) Simulation Scenario-Signal Quality Measurement: In this simulation
    scenario, the UEs are placed at the cell center, post cell center, pre cell-edge
    and cell-edge regions of a macro-eNB site. The simulation model uses the simulation
    parameters and their attributes as shown in Table VI. The signal quality is a
    measurement of three quantities: namely RSRP (reference signal received power),
    RSRQ (reference signal received quality), and SINR. SINR is a measure of signal
    quality defined by a UE vendor but never reported to the network. The UEs report
    the CQI to the network indicating DL transmission rate. The CQI is a 4-bit integer
    and is based on the observed SINR at the UE. In this simulation scenario, SINR
    factor is used to measure the link quality and the paper assumes the link quality
    is poor if the CQI value approaches 0. Result Observation: The simulation cell
    size varies between 0.5 k m 2 to 5 k m 2 . As the distance between the eNB and
    the UE gradually increases, a change in signal quality is observed. Fig. 18 shows
    the CDF plots of DL SINR values measured by the UEs throughout the cell, which
    range from −10 dB to 50 dB. These SINR values recorded by the UEs fit between
    the range of excellent to cell-edge RF conditions as specified in Table VIII.
    The UEs when positioned nearby to the base station they experience better signal
    quality. TABLE VIII LTE RF Condition Classification in [196] Fig. 18. The CDF
    plot of DL SINR values measured by the UEs placed at cell center, post cell center,
    pre cell-edge, and cell-edge regions. Show All 3) Simulation Scenario-Inter-Cell
    Interference Measurement: The inter-cell interference in our simulation occurs
    in a homogeneous network with eNodeBs having the same capability, and same transmit
    power class. The inter-cell interference between two adjacent cell results in
    signal degradation and the UEs experience poor link quality at the cell-edge [74]–[76].
    In the simulation model of the inter-cell interference measurement, 20 UEs are
    placed beyond the mid-cell region, and along the cell-edge region. The simulation
    model includes, two homogeneous eNodeBs with fixed location and transmission power
    of 23 dBm, 20 UEs, round robin MAC scheduler, pedestrian fading model, MIMO 2-layer
    spatial multiplexing, a bandwidth of 10 MHz, and the other simulation parameters
    defined in Table VI. The simulation scenario is as shown in Fig. 19, which shows
    two adjacent homogeneous small cells and cell-edge UEs. The cell-edge UEs in cell
    1 observe interference from the neighboring cell 2. The main goal of inter-cell
    interference simulation is to measure the signal degradation observed by UEs at
    cell-edge in cell 1. Fig. 19. Inter-cell interference simulation scenario with
    cell-edge UEs with interference from neighboring cell. Such a scenario may, e.g.,
    correspond to two fire trucks or police cars that utilize LTE small cells, and
    are parked next to each other during an emergency incident. Show All Result Observation:
    The intuitive analysis of Fig. 20 conclude that the cell-edge UEs in Fig. 19 observe
    signal degradation and experience poor link quality when compared to cell-edge
    UEs with no interference. The SINR values measured by the cell-edged UEs in both
    the scenario are plotted in Fig. 20 in form of a CDF. The DL SINR values experienced
    by the UEs range from −10 dB to 10 dB in the cell with no interference. On the
    other hand, the SINR values measured by the UEs in cell 1 fall in the range of
    −15 dB to 10 dB due to the signal degradation caused by the adjacent cell. Fig.
    20. The CDF plot of DL SINR values measured by the UEs placed on the edge of cell
    1 of Fig. 19. Show All B. Setup for APCO-25 The main goal of APCO-25 simulation
    study is to compute the throughput, and the SINR distribution. Fig. 21 shows the
    APCO-25 simulation environment implemented in this paper. The subscriber units
    in the simulation environment operate in direct mode, also known as talk-around,
    which enables EFR to have radio-to-radio direct communications by selecting a
    channel that bypasses their repeater/base systems. However this direct mode of
    communication limits the distance between mobile/portable subscriber units and
    spectrum reuse [43], [47]. A portable subscriber units can be described as a hand
    held device, while mobile subscriber units are mounted in EFR vehicle for mission-critical
    communication, to operates vehicle siren and lights. The APCO-25 Phase I and Phase
    II both can employ direct mode operations. Phase II TDMA systems require timing
    reference from the base station via system control channel and traffic channel
    for slot synchronization. The direct mode operation is challenging in case of
    Phase II TDMA due to the unavailability of master timing reference from the base
    station or a repeater [47]. In direct operation mode, as the distance between
    the subscriber units increases, the SINR value decreases. Fig. 21. APCO-25 suite
    of standards for public safety communication referenced in NS-3 simulation. Show
    All The APCO-25 common air interface (CAI) is a specified standard for digital
    voice modulation used by the compliant radios as shown in Fig. 21b. Public safety
    devices form different vendors using APCO-25 CAI can communicate with each other.
    APCO-25 CAI has a control channel with a rate of 9600 bps and it uses improved
    multi-band excitation (IMBE) for voice digitization. The IMBE voice encoder-decoder
    (vocoder) samples the audio input into digital stream for transmission. At the
    receiver, vocoder produces synthetic equivalent audio from the digital stream
    [44], [47]. 1) Simulation Scenario-APCO-25: The NS-3 simulation for APCO-25, consist
    a square simulation area and with a uniform random distribution of 20 subscriber
    units across the cell. These 20 subscriber units in direct communication mode
    use APCO-25 CAI for digital voice modulation and Friis propagation model. The
    portable subscriber units have transmission power of 5 Watts, mobile subscriber
    units have transmission power of 10 Watts. Result Observation: In the direct communication
    mode, maximum throughput is possible when subscriber units are in proximity. As
    the geographical distance between the portable and mobile public safety devices
    increases, the throughput decreases as shown in Fig. 22. The simulation of APCO-25
    for data only system and direct communication mode demonstrates an aggregate throughput
    of 580 Kbits/s as shown in Fig. 22. Whereas, Fig. 23 and Fig. 24 showcases the
    SINR observed by the portable and mobile public safety devices in the geographical
    area of interest. From Fig. 23 and Fig. 24 it is observed that the SINR values
    decreases with the increasing distance between two portable and mobile subscriber
    units. The observed SINR values range from −30 dB to 40 dB for portable devices,
    whereas mobile devices observe SINR value between −20 dB and 40 dB. Fig. 22. The
    maximum observed throughput in case of data communication is approximately 580

    subscriber units, with increasing distance between the subscriber units. Show
    All Since the SINR experienced by the communicating subscriber units depends on
    the proximity between the subscriber units, it can be concluded that the SINR
    value decreases with increasing remoteness between the communicating subscriber
    units. Furthermore, it can also be also noticed, the increasing distance and poor
    link quality lead to dropped packet which results in lower aggregated cell throughput.
    The mobile subscriber units have relatively higher transmission power compared
    to portable subscriber units. Therefore Fig. 22 also conclude that the mobile
    subscriber units demonstrate relatively higher throughput when compared to portable
    subscriber units. Furthermore, mobile subscriber units experience better SINR
    compared to portable subscriber units as shown in Fig. 23 and Fig. 24. C. Result
    Analysis The key factors for successful PSC can be broadly classified into mission-critical
    voice communication and wider coverage for public safety devices. From the comparison
    of Figs. 18, 23, and 24, it can be deduced that LMRS public safety devices experience
    larger cell coverage when compared to the band class 14 LTE devices. This volume
    of cell coverage is critical during the emergency scenario and is necessary to
    cover the maximum amount emergency prone area. Another rising factor in mission-critical
    PSC is real-time video communications, high data rate is needed to support real-time
    multimedia applications [197]. The aggregated throughput of LMRS infrastructure
    is less when compared to the aggregated throughput of band class 14 infrastructure
    and is shown in Fig. 17 and Fig. 22. These data rates experienced by the LTE UEs
    can definitely support the much needed real-time video communications in several
    of the PSC scenarios. An adaptation of successful edition of mission-critical
    PTT over LTE would take some time [198]. In the meantime, applying the individual
    strength of LMRS and LTE into a converged public safety device to mission-critical
    voice and much needed mission-critical real-time data support can be beneficial
    to PSC. SECTION IX. LMRS vs. LTE: SDR Experiments This section discusses the experiments
    conducted using SDR receiver such as the RTL-SDR RTL2832U [95] and HackRF [94].
    SDR is an implementation of a radio communication system where the components
    that have normally implemented in hardware such as amplifiers, mixers, filters,
    modulators/demodulators, and detectors are instead implemented by means of software
    [87], [88], [199]. Most SDR receivers use a variable-frequency oscillator, mixer,
    and filter. The flexible SDR receiver helps in tuning to the desired frequency
    or a baseband [87]. These flexible tuning characteristics can be used to tune
    into public safety signals. SDR provides a low-cost infrastructure and more or
    less computer-driven environment which makes it an integral part of the public
    safety research, development, and test activities [85], [86]. The continual development
    of SDR related hardware and software have assisted PSC researchers in gaining
    a better understanding of public safety signals. Furthermore, in this section
    we capture and analyze LMRS and public safety LTE signals and is shown via examples.
    A. APCO-25 The setup for the detection of APCO-25 signals consists HackRF connected
    to a personal computer equipped with a sound card and installed with SDRSharp
    freeware tool [91], [92]. This setup is used as radio scanner to observe unencrypted
    APCO-P25 digital radio voice spectrum using the instructions provided in [84].
    Fig. 25 shows the observed Broward County public safety radio spectrum for frequency
    of 851.68 MHz with signal strength of −36.59 dB. The second embedded window is
    a spectrogram which is a visual representation of the frequency spectrum of the
    received signal. HackRF has three receiver gain, i.e., RF amplifier between 0
    dB or 14 dB, IF low noise amplifier 0 dB to 40 dB, and baseband variable gain
    amplifier between 0 dB to 62 dB. RF amplifier gain is set high to receive string
    signal, while keeping noise floor as low as possible. In this experiment the RF
    amplifier gain is set to 9 dB. The two primary factors that describes window function
    are width of the main lobe and attenuation of the side lobes. 4-term Blackman-Harris
    window is better suited for spectral analysis [200] and therefore used in the
    current APCO-25 SDR experiments. Fig. 25. Broward County, FL, APCO-25 spectrum
    monitored using SDR# software and captured using a HackRF receiver [91], [94].
    Show All B. Band Class 14 The SDR experiment for analysis of band class 14 signals
    is conducted using the Motorola Solutions band class 14 infrastructure. The band
    class 14 base station in this scenario has DL frequency range of 758 MHz to 768
    MHz whereas the UL frequency range is 788 MHz to 798 MHz as specified in Fig.
    5. Motorola APX7000L, an LTE-LMR converged device is treated as a UE in this scenario.
    Ping requests are initiated over a user terminal is routed via APX7000L to reach
    the remote host which generates the ping replies. An another user terminal equipped
    with SDR setup is used to capture these band class 14 signals as shown in Fig.
    26. The user terminal equipped with SDR setup is running an open source LTE cell
    scanner and LTE tracker [93] tool to identify and track the band class 14 cell.
    Fig. 27 shows the identified band class 14 cell with cell ID 27, with two transmit
    antennas, center frequency of 765.5 MHz, and receive power level of −33.6 dB.
    Overall 25 resource blocks are occupied by the cell (channel bandwidth of 5 MHz),
    while the PHICH has normal duration and the resource type one. The transfer functions
    of the wireless channel from that port on the BS to the dongle’s antenna are shown
    in Fig. 28. Fig. 28a shows the instantaneous magnitude transfer function of port
    0 of cell 27 whereas Fig. 28b shows the phase plot. Fig. 26. Setup for analyzing
    band class 14 spectrum. Show All Fig. 27. Band class 14 cell detection using LTE-Tracker
    open source tool and RTL-SDR [93], [95]. Show All Fig. 28. LTE cell tracker transfer
    function observed during various RTL-SDR experimentations. The variation in the
    channel magnitude and phase is observed due to the mobility of user terminal equipped
    with SDR setup. Show All These analyses of LTE band class 14 signals can assist
    PSC researchers in detecting coverage holes in PSN and gain knowledge on the quality
    of service experienced by the UEs. SECTION X. Emerging Technologies for PSC LTE
    technology has been standardized by the 3GPP in 2008, and has been evolving since
    then. In response to growing commercial market demands, LTE-Advanced was specified
    as 3GPP Release 10. 3GPP has developed Release 11 and Release 12 with the aim
    of extending the functionality and raise the performance of LTE-Advanced [201].
    With a vision of 2020, currently LTE has become the target platform for machine-to-machine
    communications, PSC, and device-to-device services [202]. Since the deployment
    of LTE, 4G is reaching its maturity and relatively incremental improvements are
    to be expected. The 5G technology is expected to have fundamental technological
    components that will transform the capabilities of broadband networks [203]. For
    example, full-fledged efforts from researchers at the University of Surrey’s 5G
    Innovation Centre managed to attain one terabit per second (Tbps) of data speed
    [204]. The three big technologies described in [203] that will be shaping 5G are
    ultra-densification of base station deployments, millimeter wave (mmWave) communications,
    and massive MIMO. This section of paper is an attempt to emphasize the potential
    of the technological advancement achieved through LTE, LTE-Advanced, and 5G for
    transforming the PSC capabilities. In particular, use of eMBMS, millimeter wave,
    massive MIMO techniques, small cells, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), LTE-based
    V2X, unlicensed operation of LTE in the context of PSC, cognitive radio, wireless
    sensor networks, Internet of things, and cybersecurity for PSN will be reviewed.
    A. Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS) The MBMS is a point-to-point
    interface specification for upcoming 3GPP cellular networks [96], [99], [100].
    The MBMS is designed to provide efficient delivery of broadcast and multicast
    services with a cell and core network. Broadcast transmission across multiple
    cells is via single-frequency network configuration. The MBMS feature can be divided
    into the MBMS Bearer Service and the MBMS User Service [99], [100]. Support for
    evolved MBMS (eMBMS) will be also included in Release 13, which has important
    applications for PSC. The eMBMS is designed to improve the efficiency of legacy
    MBMS. The LTE technology is backward compatible with legacy 3G MBMS and supports
    new features of the broadcast networks such as digital video broadcast-terrestrial
    networks. The eMBMS is a point-to-multipoint interface where multiple LTE cells
    can be grouped into Multicast/Broadcast Single Frequency Network (MBSFN) and all
    of the cells in an MBSFN will simulcast the same information for each bearer as
    shown in Fig. 29. The eMBMS broadcast bearers provide advantages of unlimited
    group sizes within a cell, better cell edge performance due to simulcast, and
    is independent of the talkgroups size. The eMBMS would provide PSC services with
    an ability to use a single set of resources for the traffic destined to multiple
    public safety devices. The public safety eMBMS broadcast applications would be
    group calls, PTT, real-time emergency video broadcast, surveillance video broadcast,
    and non-real-time multimedia services. The eMBMS broadcast coverage improvement
    would be similar to that of LMRS simulcast [97], [98]. Fig. 29. In a single frequency
    network, base stations transmit the same signal at the same time and over the
    same frequency channel to UE. In this example MBSFN area, the group of cells perform
    synchronized eMBMS transmission. These transmitted signals appear as multipath
    components to the UE. Show All B. Millimeter Wave (mmWave) The severe spectrum
    shortage in conventional cellular bands has attracted attention towards mmWave
    frequencies that occupy the frequency spectrum for 30 GHz to 300 GHz. It is also
    considered as a possible candidate from next-generation small-cellular networks
    [101], [108]. The availability of huge bandwidth in the mmWave spectrum can alleviate
    the concerns of wireless traffic congestion which is observed in conventional
    cellular networks [105], [205]. The mmWave transceivers can cover up to about
    a kilometer communication range in some scenarios [205]. Moreover, densely laid
    out mmWave small cells in congested areas can expand the data capacity and provide
    a backhaul alternative to cable [102]. The mmWave’s ability opens up possibilities
    for new indoor and outdoor wireless services [101]. However, the key limitation
    of the mmWave technology is its limited range, due to the excessively absorbed
    or scattered signal by the atmosphere, rain, and vegetation. This limitation causes
    the mmWave signals to suffer very high signal attenuation, and to have reduced
    transmission distance. The researchers and scientists have overcome this loss
    with good receiver sensitivity, high transmit power, beamforming, and high antenna
    gains [101]–[104], [107], [108], [205], [206]. A possible solution for extending
    the mmWave range is proposed in [106]. Due to limited propagation range of mmWave,
    a reliable communication over mmWave requires a substantial number of access points.
    The authors discuss the transmission of radio frequency signals between the mmWave
    small cell base stations and radio access points using optical fibers to increase
    the coverage. This radio over fiber communication is possible by applying advanced
    optical upconversion techniques. In [107], various beamforming techniques are
    introduced for indoor mmWave communication. A well augmented mmWave system can
    position itself as a reasonable solution for PSC needs, by addressing the concerns
    and requirements such as network congestion and high data rates. A densely populated
    mmWave small-cell networks can also address the coverage needs during emergency
    situations. C. Massive MIMO MIMO is an antenna technology that can be used to
    reduce communication errors and scale the capacity of a radio link using multiple
    transmit and receive antennas. Recently massive MIMO is an emerging technology
    that uses large number of service antennas when compared to current MIMO technology
    [114]. Since the introduction of massive MIMO in [110], some researchers have
    shifted focus on solving related traditional problems [109], [111]–[114]. Massive
    MIMO is typically considered in time-division duplex systems to exploit channel
    reciprocity since it eliminates the need for channel feedback [113], [207]. However,
    the massive MIMO system is limited by pilot contamination, which is an impairment
    that is observed during channel estimation stage in TDD networks. The pilot contamination
    is caused due to the non-orthogonal nature transmission of pilots from neighboring
    cells [113], [207]. Nevertheless, the effects of pilot contamination can be reduced
    by using mitigation techniques such as pilot-based and subspace-based estimation
    approaches [113]. Overall, massive MIMO can provide benefits such as 100× radiated
    energy efficiency, 10× capacity increase over traditional MIMO, extensive use
    of inexpensive low-power components, reduced latency, simplification of the medium
    access control, spectrum efficiency, reliability, and robustness [112]–[114].
    Massive MIMO can be used for achieving high throughput communications in an emergency
    situation. For example, real-time situational awareness via high definition multimedia
    can be enabled via massive MIMO techniques. Massive MIMO can also provide better
    penetration into buildings due to directional transmissions. This ability of deep
    penetration can be utilized by the EFR during emergency scenario such as building
    fire. D. Small Cells Heterogeneous network (HetNet) topology blends macrocells,
    picocells, and femtocells. HetNet topology aims at providing uniform broadband
    experience to all users ubiquitously in the network [115], [118], [119], [121].
    Shrinking cell size benefits by reuse of spectrum across the geographical area
    and eventually reduction in number of users competing for resources at each base
    station. Small cells can be deployed both with standalone or within macro coverage,
    and they can be sparsely or densely distributed in indoor or outdoor environments
    [115]. They transmit at substantially lower power than macro cells and can be
    deployed to improve the capacity in hotpots, eliminate coverage holes, and ease
    the traffic load at the macro base station [118]. LTE based small cells can be
    deployed in an emergency scenario to improve PSC between EFR as shown in Fig.
    30. This hotspot will improve the capacity of PSC, and as a result EFR do not
    have to compete with general public for eNodeB resources. The base stations used
    as small cells in such scenario can be portable/deployable systems. The backhual
    to these base stations can be via the closest eNodeB, via satellite link, or via
    its own dedicated backhaul. A flexible and low cost PSC deployment strategy using
    small cells can be effective and enhance the ability of the EFR to save lives.
    Fig. 30. Small cell example for PSC during an emergency scene. Show All The indoor
    LTE coverage is becoming a pressing concern as LTE deployments evolve. For instance,
    EFR would need communication coverage in various parts of a building such as the
    basement. However, building basements may have weak coverage since the existing
    LTE deployments does not always consider it crucial. This issue can be resolved
    using LTE mini-towers to boost indoor communication coverage. Nevertheless, indoor
    coverage remains ones of the pitfalls for LTE and needs to be addressed for an
    effective broadband PSN [208]. E. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) In the United
    States, Hurricane Sandy affected 24 states, and particularly severe damage was
    observed in NJ and NY. Electrical power, terrestrial communication systems, and
    utilities cease to exist due to devastation caused by the Hurricane Sandy. Along
    with disruption of PSC and commercial wireless services, high winds caused damage
    to point-to-point backhaul links and fiber-optic cables were cut. The service
    disruption was observed over at least 3-5 days before any services began to restore.
    Hurricane Sandy exposed flaw in public-safety LTE plan as discussed in [209],
    due to loss of commercial cell sites and no backup coverage from commercial LTE
    carriers. The deployment of LTE-equipped UAVs in such an emergency scenario would
    provide necessary voice and data coverage [116], [125], [128]. In [123], a similar
    use case is discussed where LTE-equipped UAVs is deployed as a relay node. UAV
    will share the same bandwidth allocated for public safety broadband network and
    PSN could also backhaul the traffic from UAV. The concept of using UAV from wireless
    communication has been a proven technology. UAV are easy to deploy and can quickly
    restore critical communications during an emergency operation. Alcatel-Lucent
    conducted a test with an ad-hoc LTE network using 4G smartphone and USB Modem.
    The UAV flew one kilometer while streaming 720p video [134]. Higher heights may
    occasionally result in line-of-sight and stronger connectivity. UAVs have limited
    battery powers, and therefore may have limited flight times, which may introduce
    operational constraints. The use of UAVs in PSC networks pose several challenges
    that need to be resolved. For example, mobility model, topology formation, energy
    constraints, and cooperation between UAVs in a multi-UAV network are surveyed
    in [130]. Furthermore, spectrum scarcity specific challenges and integration of
    cognitive radio into UAVs are addressed in [131]. UAVs can complement the capabilities
    of PSN and can operate in the same public safety spectrum block. They can also
    achieve a radio link with nearest functioning eNodeB [123]. They can be deployed
    in high-risk areas to assist EFR and used as a relay node to extend network coverage,
    as discussed in [124], [125], [135], and [149]. With clearer rulemaking and policies
    on usage of UAVs in civilian space [122], UAVs can be inducted into PSN and making
    it a viable solution in filling coverage holes. F. LTE-Based V2X Communication
    LTE-based V2X communication involves the communication of information from vehicle
    into devices of interest, and vice versa. The V2X communication has many applications
    such as navigation, driver assistance, travel information, congestion avoidance,
    and fleet management. It can occur in the form of vehicle to vehicle (V2V), vehicle
    to infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle to pedestrian (V2P) communication [139]–[143].
    The ProSe can find good application in V2X communication. In Release 13, the ProSe
    has been designed for pedestrian mobility speed, and further research and standardization
    is needed for extensions to be used directly for V2X [143]. V2X communication
    can also find application in PSC. In an emergency situation Firefighters, police
    cars, ambulances vehicles can broadcast/multicast information to other traffic
    elements and pave way to the EFR vehicles and avoid any traffic congestion. The
    V2X communications can also be used during disaster management such as city evacuation.
    The vehicular ecological system can gather information such as accident points
    and traffic patterns from multiple sources. Furthermore, V2X communication can
    also broadcast this information to other vehicular nodes. The effective V2X communication
    can play critical role during disaster management and minimize loss to human life
    [136], [137]. G. License Assisted Access (LAA) With the limited spectrum availability
    and ever increasing traffic demands, researcher and cellular companies are motivated
    to find complementary solutions to the licensed spectrum. Although the licensed
    spectrum is preferable to provide better user experience, exploring LTE in unlicensed
    spectrum can lead to higher spectral efficiency [150]. LTE in the unlicensed band
    (LTE-U) can complement the services provided by the LTE in licensed spectrum.
    As per the regulation, LTE signals transmitted in unlicensed spectrum must be
    accompanied by a licensed carrier. Primary carrier always uses licensed spectrum
    (either TDD or FDD) for both control signals and user signals. The secondary carrier
    would use the unlicensed spectrum for downlink only or both uplink and downlink
    [89], [144], [146], [147], [151]. 5 GHz unlicensed spectrum is a top candidate
    for the operation that is globally available while it should be ensured that LTE-U
    design is forward-compatible with upcoming 3GPP specifications [144]. A robust
    design solutions for unlicensed bands, clearer guidelines for operators, and coexistence
    framework would be necessary, if LTE and Wi-Fi have to coexist on fair share basis
    [144], [152], [153], [210]. LAA is an aggregation of LTE in the licensed and unlicensed
    spectrum. The main goal of LTE and LTE-Advanced for a licensed-assisted access
    to unlicensed spectrum would be to achieve better traffic offloading, achieve
    spectral efficiency, and provide a higher user experience in a cost-effective
    manner [145], [150]. The Wi-Fi performance is maintained while coexisting with
    licensed-assisted access to unlicensed spectrum as discussed in [147], [149],
    and [210]. The LAA benefits to all user, by increasing the capacity to support
    the indoor applications, providing seamless indoor/outdoor mobility, better coverage
    experience, efficient spectrum usage, and better network performance as outlined
    by the technical report [210]. However, operating on unlicensed spectrum may have
    design implications on LTE that are not yet well understood. In particular, co-existence
    between multiple LTE operators sharing the unlicensed band and co-existence with
    WLAN should be studied and addressed [154], [155]. PSC examples discussed earlier
    under Sections X-B and X-C can benefit from licensed-assisted access to unlicensed
    spectrum. In Fig. 30, the small cell operating in unlicensed spectrum can be deployed
    outdoor and indoor. Extending the benefits of small cells with LTE-U would lead
    to better network performance, enhanced user experience by supplementing the downlink,
    and provide seamless mobility [120]. These benefits can enhance the EFR capabilities,
    provide much needed mission-critical communication, and improved data capacity
    to support real-time data/multimedia/voice [210]. In an emergency scenario, as
    discussed in Section X-C where all the terrestrial infrastructure has been devastated.
    LTE-U based UAV operation can be considered [126], [127]. In [126], the feasibility
    of using UAV in unlicensed for the purpose of search and rescue operations of
    avalanche victims has been discussed. Based on the simulation results, it can
    be deduced that UAV operations in unlicensed spectrum can be used by EFR during
    search and rescue missions. H. Spectrum Sharing and Cognitive Radio With the explosion
    of various wireless technologies such as 5G, Internet of Things, home automation,
    and connected cars. The finite radio spectrum, must accommodate cellular calls
    and data traffic from various wireless devices. As a result, the radio spectrum
    is quickly becoming a scarce commodity. For example, according to FCC, United
    States will be soon running out of radio spectrum [12]. As the spectrum gets increasingly
    scarce, public safety agencies have to compete with commercial entities for the
    radio spectrum resources. If not properly addressed, problem of spectrum scarcity
    can result PSN to be less dependable in the future, and may face interoperability
    challenges [13], [14]. In [11], a group of experts from Australia and Europe provide
    opinions on recent research and policy options about spectrum management, including
    new approaches to valuation and sharing. Furthermore, effective detection and
    utilization of white spaces in PSC spectrum are crucial for minimizing outages
    and maximizing throughput [158]. In [156], pervasive spectrum sharing is envisioned
    as an enabler for PSNs with broadband communication capabilities. Cognitive radio
    technology presents a viable solution to use spectrum more efficiently, which
    can potentially address the spectrum scarcity problem. A cognitive radio senses
    and learns the radio frequency spectrum in order to operate in unused portions
    of licensed spectrum or whitespaces without causing interference to primary licensed
    users [10], [157], [160]. Furthermore, a cognitive radio network offers support
    for heterogeneity, reconfigurability, self-organization, and interoperability
    with existing networks as discussed in [157] and [161]. These ability of cognitive
    radio can be instrumental during disaster scenarios, with partially/fully destroyed
    networks. Moreover, the convergence of cognitive radio technology and device-to-device
    communication can improve the spectrum utilization [159] and also benefit PSC
    by mitigating spectrum scarcity. I. Wireless Sensor Networks A sensor network
    is composed of spatially distributed autonomous sensors with the ability to monitor
    and control physical environment. A typical sensor network has many sensor nodes
    and a gateway sensor node. Modern day sensor networks are usually bi-directional
    which cooperatively pass their data through the networks to the main location.
    Lately, sensor network received extensive interest for their use cases in PSN
    [162]–[164]. A sensor network is composed of spatially distributed autonomous
    sensors with the ability to monitor and control physical environment. A typical
    sensor network has many sensor nodes and a gateway sensor node. Modern day sensor
    networks are usually bi-directional which cooperatively pass their data through
    the networks to the main location. Lately, sensor networks received extensive
    interest for their use cases in PSN [162]–[164]. Wireless sensor networks (WSN)
    have the ability for situational awareness of a large physical environment, and
    this ability can support the decision makers with early detection of a possible
    catastrophic event [162]. Furthermore, the localization algorithms can provide
    key support for many location-aware protocols and enhance the situational awareness
    [165]. In a large-scale WSN deployment for situational awareness, the WSN is vulnerable
    to traffic patterns and node convergence as discussed in [166]. Further analyzes
    present the sink mobility as a potential solution to enhance the network performance
    in large-scale WSN with varying traffic patterns. A traditional multi-hop WSN
    is resources-constrained and uses fixed spectrum allocation. Therefore, by equipping
    a sensor node with cognitive radio capabilities, a WSN can reap the benefits of
    dynamic spectrum access as discussed in [164]. Furthermore, applying channel bonding
    schemes to cognitive-WSNs can result in better bandwidth utilization and higher
    channel capacity as surveyed in [167]. The deployment of large-scale WSNs into
    PSN, alongside the LTE-based PSN, have important advantages. With sensor gateway
    node connected to LTE-based PSN, data can seamlessly flow into public safety data
    centers. This real-time data can raise the situational awareness of the public
    safety agencies and reduces the EFR response time. However, the integration of
    WSN into IP-based network makes it vulnerable to various threats as discussed
    in Section X-K. The various security aspects of WSN in PSN are discussed in [162]
    and [163]. J. Internet of Things (IoT) The IoT revolves around the pervasive presence
    of objects such as radio-frequency identification tags, sensors, actuators, and
    mobile phones having machine-to-machine (M2M) communication either through a virtual
    or instantaneous connection. The IoT infrastructure is built using cloud computing
    services and networks of data-gathering sensors. The IoT offers an ability to
    measure, infer, and understand the surrounding environment and delicate ecologies
    [171]–[173]. Ubiquitous sensing enabled by the wireless sensor networks also cuts
    across PSC frontiers. The M2M and connected devices can collect real-time data
    from EFR devices, such as body-worn cameras, sensors attached to gun holsters,
    and magazine/baton/radio pouches [174]. This ecosystem of EFR’s personal area
    network can send the real-time alert from these IoT devices to increase the situational
    awareness. With the availability of broadband services, such as LTE and WiFi,
    this real-time data can be uploaded and stored using cloud services. The real-time
    analysis of this data at crime centers using artificial intelligence and decision-making
    algorithms can be used to respond easily in any emergency situations [170]. Furthermore,
    measures can be taken to prevent a situation turning into an emergency [168],
    [169], [211]. The IoT can change the way EFR execute their missions, helping them
    to be more effective and responsive. The real-time tracking of EFR using IoT,
    can relay the right information to the right person at the right time. Furthermore,
    this information will enhance real-time decision making capabilities of EFR and
    avoid any potential disasters. However, as these devices become more integrated
    into cloud services, they are exposed to vulnerabilities that pose risk to public
    safety mission-critical data. The important major challenge involves managing
    the complex threats created by the IoT, while taking advantage of newly discovered
    capabilities of IoT to enhance PSC [212]. K. Cybersecurity Enhancements and Data
    Analytics for PSNs The public safety data available from public safety agents
    such as IoT, sensor nodes, and specialized public safety devices can play a crucial
    role in disaster management. With the help of intelligent learning techniques,
    the available data can be analyzed to understand the dynamics of disaster prone
    areas and plan the rescue operation. Moreover, the real-time data flowing in from
    different public safety agents can be analyzed to predict and issue an early warning
    in case of natural or man-made disaster. This data analysis can enhance the capabilities
    of PSN. The importance of data analytics and related case studies using big data
    have been surveyed in article [179]. Furthermore, the public safety entities access
    public safety data such as medical records, site information, and other video
    and data information useful to disaster management and emergency response. Such
    critical information is transmitted in the form of voice, data, or multimedia
    using wireless laptops, handheld public safety devices, and mobile video cameras.
    However, this public safety data can be exploited by criminals with proper technology.
    Therefore, PSN infrastructure must protect the integrity of all the public safety
    data that is being accessed and transmitted. With extensive elevated network privileges
    given to EFR during an emergency scenario, having a reliable communication becomes
    of critical importance [175], [177], [178]. McGee et al. [175] discuss various
    PSN security threats such as, protection against evesdropping, protection against
    corrupt information, securing network interfaces between network elements, protection
    against data exfiltration, and protection against denial of service attacks. Identity
    management of every public safety device and EFR accessing the critical information
    is an absolute necessity. As discussed in [175]–[177] identity management can
    be characterized as identification, authentication, and authorization associated
    with individuals, public safety devices, or public safety applications. There
    are several proven security methods/techniques for identification, authentication,
    and authorization. However, the public safety agencies need to develop the technical
    and policy requirements for use of security techniques in PSN by considering the
    scope and context of their applicability to PSC. SECTION XI. Public Safety Broadband
    Deployments in Other Regions of the World Broadband deployment for PSC has been
    grabbing the spotlight in different parts of the world. The global standards collaboration
    emergency communications task force is investigating standards for a globally
    coordinated approach for PSC. The world radio conference (WRC-15) held in Geneva
    in November 2015, provided a platform to address public protection and disaster
    relief (PPDR) requirements. The WRC-15 Resolution 646 is an international agreement
    between UN and ITU. This agreement encourages the public safety entities to use
    frequency range 694-894 MHz, when outlining a draft for nationwide broadband PSN
    for PPDR applications [58]. The public safety entities across different countries
    have different operational frequency range and spectrum requirements. Table X
    shows the frequency allocation for PPDR in various parts of the world. The amount
    of spectrum needed for PSC by different EFR agencies and applications on a daily
    basis differs significantly. To enable spectrum harmonization for nationwide and
    cross-border operations would need interoperability between various EFR systems
    used for PPDR. As a result, having a dedicated broadband spectrum for PPDR has
    been one of the WRC-15 agenda items [213]. TABLE IX Results Summary of NS-3 Simulation
    for LTE Band Class 14 and APCO-25 TABLE X PDPR Identified Bands/Ranges by International
    Telecommunication Union (ITU) [57] Europe: The ECC Report 199 [59] addresses the
    broadband spectrum in Europe for PSC networks, which considers the 400 MHz and
    700 MHz frequency bands. The report also concludes that 10 MHz of spectrum for
    the uplink and another 10 MHz for the downlink would provide sufficient capacity
    to meet the core requirements of PSC. United Kingdom: The public safety agencies
    in the United Kingdom use narrowband TETRA PSN for data and mission-critical voice
    services. Furthermore, the United Kingdom also plans on building emergency services
    mobile communications programme (ESMCP), also referred as the emergency service
    network (ESN), which will deliver future mobile communication for the country’s
    emergency services using 4G LTE network [214]. The United Kingdom is preparing
    for an orderly transition from TETRA to LTE-based ESN by the year 2020 [215].
    However, there is no spectrum available in 700 MHz at-least until 2019. Therefore,
    the ESN will latch onto 800 MHz to implement voice calls over LTE, PTT capabilities,
    and satellite backhaul in hard-to-reach areas [216]. Canada: Industry Canada has
    initiated a framework and policy for public safety broadband spectrum in the bands
    758-763 MHz and 788-793 MHz, i.e., band class 14 as illustrated in Fig. 5. Canadian
    public safety band plan in upper 700 MHz is shown in [60] and it corresponds to
    FirstNet’s band class 14. Recently, the EFR in the City of Calgary, have been
    testing the first public safety LTE network in Canada [217]. With the help of
    high-speed broadband capabilities Calgary Police Services were able to quickly
    access data, analyze the information, and securely multicast data to EFR. The
    Calgary public safety LTE network is composed of cellular sites and uses LTE public
    safety devices such as VML750 and LEX mission-critical handhelds [217]. Australia
    and China: Similarly, in countries like Australia and China, LTE technology is
    fast becoming a primary choice for professional digital trunking command and dispatching
    services. The main goal is to build a rapid, flexible, and effective wireless
    multimedia communications network, which can be used to improve PDPR applications
    [57], [218]. SECTION XII. Issues and Open Research Directions While the technologies
    for PSC are ever evolving, given the discovery-delivery gap, not all advanced
    aspects of the public safety technology are commercially available. In particular,
    a full-fledged deployment of mission-critical LTE-based PSN is unattainable in
    the short term. This has resulted in the amalgamation of legacy and emerging public
    safety technologies. The convergence of LMRS-LTE public safety technologies can
    provide mission-critical voice and broadband data. However, designing and optimizing
    LMRS-LTE converged devices which can support mature 3GPP techniques such as MBMS
    is an open challenge for the engineers [79], [81]. The integration and optimization
    of 3GPP Rel. 12/13 enhancements such as eMBMS, HetNets, LAA, and LTE-based V2X
    for PSC is an open challenge to both academic and engineering community. Currently,
    the MBSFN area and subframes in eMBMS are static and cannot be adjusted according
    to user distribution. Therefore, design and optimization of flexible MBSFN resource
    structures that can accommodate different user distributions have become a challenge
    and an important area of research. The integration of Rel. 13 enhancements for
    D2D/ProSe framework into MBMS/eMBMS is an another open area of research [99].
    Small cells need better assessment of attributes such as grid configuration, alignment
    with macro network to avoid interference, handover analysis, and backhauling to
    meet the capacity requirements of cell-edge users. Furthermore, a systematic convergence
    of mmWave, massive MIMO, and UAVs with small cells are an open areas of research
    [115], [118], [121]. LTE-U and LAA coexisting fairly in the unlicensed spectrum
    with other broadband technologies has become an intense debate. Therefore, having
    policies to ensure fair access to all technologies is increasingly becoming a
    popular area of investigation. Furthermore, designing protocols for carrier aggregation
    of licensed and unlicensed bands is an another important area of research [147],
    [210]. The integration of ProSe and LTE-based broadcast services into LTE-based
    V2X can ensure connectivity between EFR vehicles, roadside infrastructure, and
    people in PSN. This open area of research can help to further strengthen the mobility
    management, public warning systems, and disaster management. However, resource
    allocation, latency, interference management and mobility management are important
    issues in V2X communication that need some study [136], [137]. The mmWave, massive
    MIMO, and UAVs are advanced technologies with potential applications for PSC.
    Each of these technologies have their own metrics such as throughput provided,
    latency, the cost of providing higher throughput, ease of deployment, and commercial
    viability for assessing success in PSN. By addressing challenges such as interference
    management, spatial reuse, and modulation and coding schemes for dynamically changing
    channel user states, mmWave can result in more practical and affordable system
    for the development of cellular and PSN networks [102]–[105]. Similarly, efficient
    model of massive MIMO in PSN needs more accurate analysis of computational complexity,
    processing algorithms, synchronization of antenna units, and channel model [109].
    The application of UAVs in PSN is shrouded by publics privacy concerns and lack
    of comprehensive policies, regulations, and governance for UAVs [178]. Investigating
    the role of mmWave and massive MIMO with UAVs for higher throughput gains for
    robust UAV deployment [133]. Furthermore, developing new propagation model for
    better autonomy and quicker deployment of UAVS as aerial base stations is an open
    research direction [116], [123]–[129], [132], [149]. SDR and cognitive radio technologies
    provide additional flexibility and efficiency for overall spectrum use. These
    technologies can be combined or deployed autonomously for PSC. However, PSN using
    SDR or cognitive radio technologies must operate in compliance with radio and
    spectrum regulations. Furthermore, a comprehensive implementation of these technologies
    for PSC present technical and operational challenges. An SDR for PSC, which is
    interoperable across vendor infrastructures, frameworks, and radio bands is an
    area for future research [84]–[86]. Similarly, cognitive radio technology needs
    extensive research in areas of energy efficient spectrum sensing and sharing to
    be more effective. Extensive research over application of LAA, database-assisted
    spectrum sharing, and prioritized spectrum access in cognitive radio technology
    can further enhance the spectrum efficiency [89], [146], [147], [149]. Public
    safety wearables have become increasingly popular amongst EFR and are an important
    area of research. Tailoring public safety wearables and wireless sensors into
    IoT can help in real-time data aggregation and situation analysis. Therefore,
    WSNs and IoT needs to evolve within the wider context of PSN and address issues
    related to infrastructure, design, cost, interoperability, data aggregation, regulations,
    policies, and information security [162]–[164]. Furthermore constructing robust
    models for multi-hop synchronization and tethering real-time wireless sensor data
    attached to EFR equipment have become a contemporary area of research [168], [169].
    The EFR access public safety data such as medical records, site information, multimedia,
    and other information useful for disaster management and emergency response. The
    perpetrators with proper technology can exploit this public safety data. Therefore,
    given the scope of next generation PSN, securing PSN infrastructures, public safety
    device integrity, and public safety data is an important issue and open area of
    research within cybersecurity space [170], [175], [177], [178]. Furthermore, the
    policy requirements for the use of public safety devices and information operating
    in PSN is an another major issue and area of research for the public safety agencies
    and federal regulatory bodies [176]. SECTION XIII. Conclusion In this paper, an
    overview of legacy and emerging public safety communication technologies is presented
    along with the spectrum allocation for public safety usage across all the frequency
    bands in the United States. The challenges involved with PSN operations are described,
    and the benefits of LTE-based PSN over LMRS are also discussed. Simulation results
    of LTE band class 14 and LMRS, convey that the LTE band class 14 devices experience
    significantly higher throughput when compared with LMRS subscriber units. These
    observed throughput values can support the mission-critical broadband data services.
    A far-reaching cell coverage is one of the key factors in PSC and the simulation
    results show that the LMRS subscriber units experience better cell coverage and
    range when compared to LTE band class 14 UEs. In the upcoming years, LMRS is bound
    to stay as the primary PSC solution for mission-critical voice connectivity, alongside
    LTE providing the much need mission-critical real-time data. The technological
    advancement achieved through LTE, LTE-Advanced, and 5G will continue to enhance
    and transform the PSC capabilities in the future. Appendix Definitions of the

    Massive and ubiquitous deployment of devices in networks of fifth generation (5G)
    and beyond wireless has necessitated the development of ultra-low-power wireless
    communication paradigms. Recently, wireless-powered networks with backscatter
    communications (WPN-BCs) has been emerged as a most prominent technology for enabling
    large-scale self-sustainable wireless networks with the capabilities of RF energy
    harvesting (EH) and of extreme low power consumption. Therefore, we provide a
    comprehensive literature review on the fundamentals, challenges and the on-going
    research efforts in the domain of WPN-BCs. Our emphasis is on large-scale networks.
    In particular, we discuss signal processing aspects, network design issues and
    efficient communication techniques. Moreover, we review emerging technologies
    for WPN-BCs to bring about the best use of resources. Some applications of this
    innovative technology are also highlighted. Finally, we address some open research
    problems and future research directions. Published in: IEEE Open Journal of the

    Pervasive application of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and massive machine type communications
    to connect a large number of small computing devices (associated with people,
    vehicles, environment and other factors) embedded in the environment and implanted
    in bodies, have attracted tremendous attention in the 5G mobile communication
    networks. In order to keep a massive number of energy-constrained IoT sensors
    alive for tasks such as continuous monitoring and controlling, uninterrupted supply
    of energy is essential for the sensors and controlling/computing devices. This
    issue poses key design challenges for IoT, i.e., batteries increase the devices’
    form factors and their recharging and replacement cause high cost. Moreover, it
    is sometimes hazardous or even impossible to recharge/replace the batteries, since
    a large number of sensors may be hidden or deployed in a perilous environment
    [1]–[4]. To resolve these issues and also due to the size and the design constraints
    of sensors and devices, equipping nodes with distinct power sources is one promising
    solution. Thus, radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting (EH) methods have been
    proposed as a cost-effective solution to mitigate the energy issue in energy-constrained
    wireless networks by exploiting alternative forms of energy resources [5]. However,
    the power consumption of RF-powered active communication is relatively high and
    is challenging specially for large-scale IoT deployments. Tackling these major
    challenges has initiated increasing research interests on the design of large-scale
    self-sustainable wireless networks with the capabilities of EH and of extreme
    low power consumption. Recently, significant interest in backscatter communications
    systems (BCSs) for low-power wireless communications has emerged. BCSs are simply
    based on passive reflection and modulation of incident signals from external RF
    sources by adapting the level of antenna mismatch to vary the reflection coefficient
    and harvest energy from the signal for operating the circuit [2], [6]. A backscatter
    node has no active energy hungry RF components such as oscillators and analog-to-digital
    converters (ADCs) and hence it can be miniaturized with extremely low power consumption;
    a backscatter node consumes power orders-of-magnitude less than a conventional
    radio (in the order of 10μW ) [7]. Therefore, the integration of EH methods and
    low-power backscattering communication enables passive IoT deployment at a flexible
    location or even an in-body implantation [8]. A. Energy Harvesting To extend the
    lifetime of network devices, EH has attracted an upsurge of research interests
    due to its numerous new opportunities and promising features for energy-constrained
    wireless networks (e.g., wireless sensor networks (WSN) and IoT); no wire, no
    contacts, no batteries, genuine mobility and predictable, dedicated and reliable
    energy supply [9], [10]. As shown in Fig. 1, EH can be categorized into three
    different types: Wireless power transfer (WPT) In this scheme, a dedicated power
    transmitter transmits energy to the users and it does not transmit information
    simultaneously. Thus, the emphasis of the system design is to exclusively deliver
    energy over the wireless channel Fig. 1(a). Some practical applications of such
    designs include home electronics, medical implants and electric vehicles [11].
    Wireless-powered communication networks (WPCNs) In this scheme, energy is transferred
    in the downlink and information is transferred in the uplink – Fig. 1(b). A protocol
    to enable this process is named harvest-then-transmit (HTT) [12]; the low-power
    users harvest energy in the downlink from the power transmitter, and actively
    transmit data in the uplink using their harvested energy. With the help of this
    protocol, wireless devices can be developed for applications such as IoT and WSNs
    [13], [14]. Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) In this
    scheme, energy and information are transferred simultaneously via a common signal
    in the downlink to user devices [15], [16]–Fig. 1(c). The power transmitter transmits
    a modulated waveform, from which a target user device harvests energy and demodulates
    information bits. The energy receivers and the information receivers can be co-located
    or separated. In SWIPT with co-located receivers, each low-power user device receives
    information and energy, simultaneously. FIGURE 1. Paradigms for EH systems [7].
    Show All The integration of wireless power and information transfers, as a powerful
    means for powering energy-constrained wireless devices, spawn new challenges and
    opportunities. Extensive research efforts have thus been expended on various aspects
    of EH-enabled communication systems from both technical and theoretical perspectives
    including fundamental limits, design challenges, transmission techniques, network
    architecture, hardware impairments, scheduling and medium access control (MAC)
    [9], [16]–[18]. Despite its rapid advancement from both theoretical and technical
    perspectives and also its numerous and undeniable advantages, EH technology still
    faces many realization hurdles in large-scale low-cost and low-power networks,
    e.g., WSNs and IoT. For instance, with the HTT protocol, by wireless energy transfer
    in the downlink and wireless information transmission in the uplink, we find the
    doubly near-far problem; i.e., the user located near the hybrid access point (H-AP)
    can gain more energy than the far users, hence the far users suffer from less
    amount of harvested energy and uplink throughput degradation than near users due
    to doubly distance-dependent signal attenuation [19]. The problem of the double
    near-far phenomenon has been attacked in [12], [20], [21]. For instance, [12]
    proposes a common throughput maximization scheme, which allocates equal rates
    to all users regardless of their distances from the H-AP by allocating the transmission
    time to users inversely proportional to their distances to the H-AP. However,
    this scheme severely degrades the overall network performance in terms of fairness.
    Besides, the methods given in [20], [21], which study user cooperation to alleviate
    the doubly-near far problem, are not applicable for large-scale wireless networks
    due to their undue complexity. The doubly-near far problem also limits the far
    users when they want to send urgent data, as those users may require a long time
    to harvest enough energy to transmit data [22]. SWIPT enabled device-to-device
    (D2D) communication and its scheduling also need to be further addressed [17],
    [18]. Moreover, active RF transmission architecture contains power-hungry RF chain
    having oscillators, mixers, ADC, which results in non-compacts form factors and
    high power consumption. This issue is challenging specially for large-scale wireless
    networks, e.g., massive IoT devices. BCSs, low complexity and low-power devices
    without active RF component, is a promising solution to sustain massive IoT devices
    and to tackle the above challenges [7], [19]. Since BCSs operate in passive mode
    by reflecting the carrier signal rather than active transmission, it can resolve
    the doubly near-far problem in HTT by enabling a long-range communication with
    low power consumption. Moreover, since it depends on instantaneous excitation
    energy, it does not require a dedicated time for EH, thereby, making urgent transmission
    possible even for far users from the H-AP [8]. Therefore, backscatter communication
    is a key facilitator for low-rate, low-power and large-scale wireless communication
    systems with EH. B. Backscatter Communications In this system, a sending device
    - a backscatter transmitter - modulates and reflects received RF signals in order
    to transmit data instead of generating RF signals by itself [24]–[26]. The backscatter
    transmitter, also called a tag, maps a sequence of digital symbols on to the RF
    backscattered waveform. In particular, initiating their own RF transmissions as
    conventional wireless systems, a tag is a passive node that harvests energy from
    an incident RF signal to support its operation and send data to a backscatter
    receiver, i.e., reader, just by adjusting its antenna impedance to reflect the
    received RF signals. This process is known as load modulation [8], [23], [27],
    [28]. A diagram of a tag with binary load modulation is given in Fig. 2. The tag
    has two loads with the impedance intentionally matching and mismatching with the
    antenna impedance, respectively. The tag transmits its binary symbols to the reader
    through choosing whether to backscatter the RF incident signal or not by adjusting
    the load impedance of its antenna, where symbol “0” and “1” correspond to a non-backscattering
    (absorbing state) and a backscattering (reflecting state), respectively [29].
    The reader, with its own power supply and a full set of conventional RF components,
    will then decode tag’s transmit symbols. In the reflecting state, the reader will
    observe a superposition of the original RF incident signal and the tag backscattered
    signal. Whereas, in the absorbing state, the reader will only observe the original
    RF signal. These states are then interpreted as information bits. The diagram
    of a binary amplitude demodulation based on envelope detection at the receiver
    is given in Fig. 2. FIGURE 2. Paradigms for backscatter communications [23]. Show
    All In general, BCSs can be classified into monostatic backscatter communications
    systems (MBCSs), Bistatic backscatter Communication systems (BBCSs), and Ambient
    backscatter Communication systems (ABCSs) – Fig. 2. Among these, ABCSs have recently
    drawn much interest due to their ease of implementation. Monostatic Backscatter
    communications systems: An MBCS consists of a backscatter transmitter and a reader
    – Fig. 2 (a) [23], [30]. The reader has co-located an RF source and a backscatter
    receiver. The RF source generates RF signals to activate the tag. The backscatter
    transmitter (tag) modulates and reflects these RF signals to transmit its data
    to the backscatter receiver. As the RF source and the backscatter receiver are
    co-located (reader), the backscattered signals incur a round-trip path loss [31].
    Thus, MBCSs suffer from doubly near-far problem. That is, due to the signal loss
    from the RF source to the backscatter transmitter, and vice versa, if a backscatter
    transmitter is located far from the reader, it can experience a higher energy
    outage probability and a lower modulated backscatter signal strength [19]. However,
    MBCSs are mainly adopted for short-range applications, e.g., radio frequency identification
    (RFID) [32], [33], which is the prominent commercial application of backscatter
    radio. In a typical RFID system, an RFID reader interrogates the RFID tag for
    the desired information such as an identification number. Generally, RFID tags
    can be passive, active of semipassive. Of these, passive tags have received more
    emphasis due to their battery-less structure. They rely on the RF signal transmitted
    by the RFID reader and backscattering for EH and information transmission, respectively
    [32], [33]. This traditional setup however may not be suitable for massive IoT
    devices, since typical nodes are power-constrained and may fail to wirelessly
    power other nodes for communication over long distances [2]. Bistatic Backscatter
    Communications Systems: In a BBCS, proposed in [31], the RF source, i.e., the
    carrier emitter, and the backscatter receiver are separated - Fig. 2 (b). The
    carrier emitter generates the carrier signal which is detached from the reader
    to overcome the limited range of power-up link of a MBCS (e.g., RFID tag). This
    configuration can also avoid the round-trip path loss experienced in MBCSs. Additionally,
    the performance of the BBCS can be improved dramatically by placing carrier emitters
    at optimal locations. Specifically, one centralized backscatter receiver can be
    located in the field while multiple carrier emitters are well placed around backscatter
    transmitters. Consequently, the overall field coverage can be expanded. Moreover,
    the doubly near-far problem can be mitigated as backscatter transmitters can derive
    unmodulated RF signals sent from nearby carrier emitters to harvest energy and
    backscatter data [19]. Although bulky and deployment costly, carrier emitters
    and backscatter receivers of BBCSs can be cheaper than that of MBCSs due to the
    simple design of the components [23]. Ambient Backscatter Communications Systems:
    ABCS is an idea based on BBCSs philosophy which was developed to communicate with
    wireless devices nearby without using any energy supply or storage device [34],
    [35]. In an ABCS, the tag utilizes modulated ambient RF signals, e.g., signals
    from TV towers, cellular base stations (BSs), and Wi-Fi APs instead of using unmodulated
    dedicated RF signals (e.g., BBCSs) - Fig. 2 (c). Ambient RF sources can be classified
    into static and dynamic types [36], [37]. Static ambient RF sources constantly
    transmit high-power signals, e.g., TV towers and FM radio BSs, whereas, dynamic
    ambient RF sources such as Wi-Fi APs operate periodically or randomly with typically
    low transmit powers. The use of existing RF sources confers ABCSs with some advantages
    [35]. First, it eliminates the need to deploy and maintain dedicated RF sources,
    which inevitably reduces the cost and energy consumption. Second, it also means
    that ABCSs do not need new frequency spectrum allocation, and thus the spectrum
    resource utilization improves. However, the use of modulated ambient RF signals
    has some disadvantages. First, they are unpredictable and dynamic, and act as
    direct interference to backscatter receivers, which limits the performance of
    an ABCS, unlike unmodulated ones of the BBCS, which can easily be eliminated before
    backscattered signal detection. Second, since the parameters of ambient RF sources
    (e.g., transmission power and locations) are not controllable, the design and
    deployment of an ABCS to achieve optimal performance can be challenging. In particular,
    although static RF sources may provide predictable RF energy, long-term and short-term
    fluctuations due to service scheduling are possible [36]. On the other hand, dynamic
    ambient RF sources operate periodically and their power may change over time.
    Moreover, since an ABCS can not function when RF sources are far off, searching
    for available opportunities in a certain frequency range is required to utilize
    ambient RF sources [23]. Therefore, this setup is not scalable due to its dependence
    on other networks as energy resources and thus may fail to meet the requirements
    of massive IoT devices. ABCSs are mainly categorized into three types based on
    their configurations. The first category is the traditional ABCSs (TABCSs) with
    detached backscatter receiver and ambient transmitter (and its legacy receiver)
    [8], [29], [38]–[45]. Strong direct interference from the ambient transmitter
    received at the backscatter receiver is the most challenging issue in this setup.
    This direct-link interference can be avoided with the help of frequency shift
    methods to isolate the spectrum of the backscattered signal from the spectrum
    of the direct-link signal [38]. However, the frequency shift operation imposes
    higher requirements on device hardware. Maximum-likelihood (ML) based detection
    methods are also employed to detect the tag’s information and the direct-link
    interference is treated as a part of noise [29], [46]. These methods, however,
    works well when the backscattered signal strength is comparable to that of direct-link
    interference. Some studies also assume that the legacy system employs orthogonal
    frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and mitigates the direct-link interference
    by exploiting some structural properties of the modulation format [39]. In [41],
    the noncoherent ML detection problem is formulated and solved for a general Q-ary
    backscatter signal over ambient OFDM modulation, where the direct-link interference
    is treated as an unwanted signal and modeled as a random process that is correlated
    to the useful backscatter signal. Furthermore, a multi-antenna receiver can mitigate
    the direct link-interference by employing receive beamforming and also by constellation
    learning based methods [40], [43]. The second category of ABCSs is the cooperative
    ABCSs (CABCSs) where the backscatter receiver and the legacy receiver are co-located
    [60]–[65]. In this setup, despite TABCSs, the signals from the ambient transmitter
    are recovered and decoded at the backscatter receiver. In [60], the achievable
    rate region of such setup is analyzed and it is shown that the rate region is
    strictly larger than that of the conventional time-division-multiple access (TDMA)
    scheme, i.e., in each time slot, either the information from the ambient transmitter
    or the tag is received. Moreover, the optimal ML detector, sub-optimal linear
    detectors and the successive interference cancellation (SIC) based detectors are
    derived in [61]. In [62], the sum rate of the backscatter communication and the
    legacy communication is investigated with perfect and imperfect channel knowledge,
    where a linear minimum mean square error receiver with SIC is utilized for joint
    decoding. In this configuration, the nodes are equipped with multiple antennas.
    In [63], the sum rate is analyzed for SIC based decoding, and a problem is formulated
    to maximize the sum rate by optimizing the beamforming vector at the multi-antenna
    ambient transmitter. In addition, in [64], upper bounds of the ergodic rates for
    both links, i.e., backscatter communication and the legacy communication, are
    derived considering a multi-antenna cooperative receiver which separately decodes
    the signals from a multi-antenna ambient transmitter and a single-antenna tag.
    Recently, [65] has investigated resource allocation for the CABCSs with a finite
    block-length backscatter link. The average achievable rate of the direct and backscatter
    links are derived and transmit power minimization and the energy efficiency maximization
    problems are formulated and solved to design the transmit beamforming vector.
    The third category of ABCS is full-duplex ABCSs (FABCSs) where the backscatter
    receiver and the ambient transmitter are co-located; therefore, the signals from
    the ambient transmitter can be cancelled out [3], [44], [66]–[68]. In [44], the
    capacity performances of both the backscatter communication and the legacy communication
    over OFDM carriers are investigated and the asymptotic capacity bounds are derived
    in closed-form for the case of sufficiently large number of subcarriers. Moreover,
    in [3], a FABCS is designed where a Wi-Fi AP can receive the backscattered signal
    while simultaneously transmitting Wi-Fi packets to its legacy client. A general
    FABCS is considered in [66], where unlike [3], [44], multiple tags backscatter
    information to the full-duplex AP. Specifically, the full-duplex AP transmits
    downlink signal which consists of not only information to the legacy user but
    also energy to multiple tags; while all the tags simultaneously backscatter information
    to the full-duplex AP using the TDMA protocol. Moreover, in [67], the throughput
    maximization of a full-duplex-enabled cognitive backscatter network is investigated
    via joint time scheduling, transmit power allocation, and reflection coefficient
    adjustment, such that the minimum rate requirements of the primary system is guaranteed.
    In this configuration, an ABCS underlays a primary cellular system, and the primary
    AP can transmit primary signals and receive backscatter signals simultaneously
    via full-duplex communications. The authors in [68] further focused on MAC-layer
    in addition to physical-layer and investigated cross-layer outage capacity for
    FABCSs where multiple full-duplex mobile users attempt to send packets to the
    AP according to the carrier sense multiple access/collision avoidance (CSMA/CA)
    protocol while receiving the information from their respective associated backscatter
    devices. C. Contribution and Organization EH and backscatter communications enable
    self-sustainable, large-scale, low-power and low-cost wireless networks, e.g.,
    WSN and IoT. Although, each technology has its own pros and cons, neither of them
    can separately meet all the requirements of large-scale communication systems.
    The integration of these two technologies effectively inherits the advantages
    of both techniques and can actually be the solution to build up totally passive
    massive WSNs [69]. They complement each other to overcome the challenges of each
    technology, thereby leading to considerable improvements in the performance of
    large-scale dense IoT deployments, i.e., increased range and throughput, low-power
    design, scalability, reuse of ambient signals, low-cost, low-complexity and easy-to
    implement communications, as the key requirements of massive IoT devices. Wireless-powered
    networks with backscatter communications (WPN-BCs) have attracted tremendous attention
    from both academia and industry as the key facilitator for IoT deployment, an
    important part of the new generation of information technology. Significant research
    efforts have been expended on the field of WPN-BCs, with the discovery of practical
    advantages and solutions to many problems and research potentials. Along the way,
    there have been several outstanding surveys and tutorials that review wireless-powered
    networks and backscatter communications separately with very limited discussions
    on their integration [7], [13], [14]. To the best of our knowledge, no contributions
    have been reported in the direction of providing a comprehensive review of the
    integral aspects of wireless-powered networks and backscatter communications.
    Our survey thus aims to fill this gap and add to the current literature. Motivated
    by this aspect, unlike the existing surveys on backscatter communications, we
    will also thoroughly address the deployment issues, waveform and energy harvester
    design, distributed MAC protocols, artificial intelligence based approaches and
    security issues in the domain of WPN-BCs, as the key features aimed at fostering
    5G and beyond networks. Table 1 shows some of the literature reviews on the related
    domains of EH and backscatter communications. TABLE 1 Some of the Literature Reviews
    on the Related Domains of EH and Backscatter Communications This paper mainly
    focuses on the integral aspects of wireless-powered networks and backscatter communications
    with the emphasis on large-scale analysis. A comprehensive overview of the research
    and technological development on the architecture, protocols and applications
    of WPN-BCs is provided (Fig. 3). FIGURE 3. Outline of the main contributions of
    this survey. Show All Some of the contributions of this paper are as follows:
    The focus is not only given to wireless-powered networks and backscatter communications
    individually, but also emphasizes their integrated usages and applications. Basic
    principles and advanced design and communication techniques related to WPN-BCs
    are discussed with the emphasis on large-scale networks. Open issues, challenges,
    and future research directions for WPN-BCs are mentioned. The rest of the paper
    is organized as follows. We first discuss the fundamentals of WPN-BCs, including
    both backscatter communications and wireless-powered networks in Section II. It
    discusses signal processing aspects including modulation, signal detection schemes
    and channel coding. Network design issues, i.e., deployment of WPN-BCs and waveform
    and energy harvester design are also outlined. In Section III, a summary of the
    research works aiming to address the challenges of such networks and improve their
    performance is provided. Efficient communication techniques including performance
    optimization, scheduling and resource allocation along with multiple-antenna systems,
    multi-access, artificial intelligence techniques and security issues are explained
    and discussed. Emerging wireless-powered backscatter systems are reviewed in Section
    IV. Some applications of WPN-BCs are shown in Section V. Section VI addresses
    the open issues and future research directions of WPN-BCs. Finally, we conclude
    the paper in Section VII. The abbreviations used in this article are summarized
    in Table 2. TABLE 2 List of Abbreviations SECTION II. Principles of Wireless-Powered
    Backscatter Systems WPN-BCs inherit the fundamental and operational mechanisms
    of wireless-powered networks and backscatter communications. Comprehensive literature
    reviews on the fundamentals of these two emerging technologies can be found in
    [7]–[9], [13], [16], [36], [58]. In this section, we thus mainly focus on modulation
    and channel coding techniques, as the two important aspects of wireless communication
    systems, applicable to WPN-BCs. In addition, network design issues, i.e., deployment
    of WPN-BCs and waveform and energy harvester design are discussed in detail. The
    key features of designing large-scale WPN-BCs are also emphasized. A. Modulation
    and Demodulation For efficient data transmission in BCSs, different modulation
    techniques including amplitude modulation, i.e., amplitude shift keying (ASK)
    [31], [70], [71], differential modulation [72], quadrature amplitude modulation
    (QAM) [73]–[76], and frequency modulation, i.e., frequency shift keying (FSK)
    [31], [71], [77], Gaussian frequency shift keying (GFSK) [79], minimum-shift keying
    (MSK) [78], have been used. Phase modulation, i.e., phase shift keying (PSK),
    has also been adopted in BCSs [3], [73], [80]. A good summary of these modulation
    schemes and their applications is provided in [7], [58]. Table 3 briefly summaries
    the advantages and disadvantages of popular modulation schemes in backscatter
    communications systems. In general, ASK provides continuous power to backscatter
    transmitters and the receiver design is simple [81]. However, it is sensitive
    to noise and interference [82]. On-off keying (OOK) is the simplest type of amplitude
    modulation based on ASK, which is used to increase the range in backscatter communications
    [31], [71]. Coherent demodulation of requires channel estimation, but it will
    add complexity to the receiver and also results in overheads in terms of pilot/
    training sequence transmissions. Thus, resources such as bandwidth and power can
    be consumed excessively in the process of demodulation. To mitigate these issues,
    differential modulation techniques conveys the information in the difference between
    two consecutive symbols. This assumes a quasi-static channel, which remains constant
    over two symbol periods. Thus, differential modulation is used to address the
    signal detection problem in ABCSs [72]. TABLE 3 Summary of Modulation Schemes
    In order to increase the spectral efficiency of data transmission, QAM can be
    used, which combines two amplitude-modulated signals to double the effective bandwidth
    [71], [73], [74]. It maintains data throughput equal to ASK or PSK by using a
    frequency equal to the symbol rate. However, QAM is susceptible to the noise which
    results in normalized power loss [3]. FSK is resilient to the noise and signal
    strength variation but the spectrum of this modulation type doubles that of the
    ASK modulation [7]. FSK modulation is mainly used for BBCSs to extend the communication
    range and coverage [31], [77]. Moreover, GFSK uses the Gaussian-shaped frequency
    shifting technique to convey information. It is used for modulation, in a monostatic
    full-duplex Bluetooth low energy compatible BCSs, for mobile devices [79]. MSK,
    i.e., a special case of FSK, is also used to minimize the interference at the
    backscatter receiver [78]. For PSK, higher data rate can be achieved, but its
    demodulation process is more complicated than that of the other schemes. PSK is
    mainly adopted in ABCSs [80]. Binary modulation formats result in low data rate
    due to their low spectral efficiency, e.g., up to 640 kbps for FM0 and Miller
    coding [23]. Higher-order modulation techniques have thus been used to increase
    the data rate, thereby leading to reduced on-chip power consumption and extended
    read range, i.e., M-array QAM, e.g., 16-QAM [75], 32-QAM [76], as well as N-PSK,
    e.g., 16-PSK [3]. Another open possibility is to use adaptive modulation [83].
    In conventional backscatter communication, the tag needs to harvest enough energy
    from the reader to activate and modulate data. The reader in turn must receive
    a strong backscattered signal to be able to recover data. Therefore, in order
    to obtain a fully passive system with the modulator, a combination of backscatter
    modulation with wireless power transfer is proposed for RFID-enabled sensors [69],
    [84]–[86]. In this scheme, a backscatter modulator and a dual band rectifier are
    designed such that two different frequencies are used for different purposes,
    one is used to continuously power the wireless sensor and the other to transfer
    data through suitable modulation techniques, e.g., ASK and QAM [84]–[86]. In [86],
    a 16-QAM backscatter modulator with wireless power transfer capabilities is developed
    with of a power consumption of 59μW and a data rate of 960 Mbps. Signal detection
    is the process of recovering the transmit data by using the received signal. This
    task must be done by the reader and is challenging for two reasons: (1) channel
    estimation is difficult due to the simple fact that ABCS networks exploit existing
    signals (e.g., LTE and WiFi), which are unknown to the reader. Such signals cannot
    be used as pilot or training sequences. Thus, the reader lacks the training symbols
    to estimate the channel parameters; (2) the difficulty of separating the backscattered
    signal from existing modulated signals (e.g., LTE and WiFi). Thus, in order to
    detect the modulated signals sent by the tag, different detection techniques have
    been proposed. Among these, non-coherent detection is commonly adopted due to
    its simplicity because it can be used without the knowledge of channel state information.
    It is suitable for ASK and FSK [28], [44], [87], [88]. A diagram of binary amplitude
    demodulation based on envelope detection is shown in Fig. 2 [34]. The envelope
    generator extracts the envelope of the instantaneous signal by smoothing the incoming
    waves at the antenna. The threshold calculator, then takes the mean of the long-term
    averaged envelope and generates a threshold. The threshold and the smoothed instantaneous
    envelope of the received modulated backscatter are then compared to decide the
    value of the information bits. However, this energy detector generally works well
    at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), but produces high detection errors at the
    low SNR regime. A detection algorithm based on statistical covariances is suggested
    in [89] for ABCSs, which outperforms the energy detector at low SNR regions. Although
    it is simple, non-coherent detection offers low bit rates only and is not suitable
    for PSK modulation. Therefore, more complicated detection techniques, i.e., coherent
    detection, which requires channel state information (CSI), have been used [77].
    Some general information regarding CSI acquisition can be found in [90]. A coherent
    and a partly coherent detector is proposed in [91] for ABCSs, where the backscatter
    device uses a frequency-shifted form of OOK, i.e., pseudo-FSK, to remodulate the
    FM signals, and the RF transmitter and the backscatter device transmit pilot sequences
    to estimate CSI. Such requirements and the difficulty of channel estimation may
    limit the use case scenarios that may allow coherent reception in practice [59].
    The channel estimation problem for an ABCS has been investigated in [92], which
    develops an expectation maximization estimator for the modulus values of the ambient
    backscatter channel parameters. This paper obtains the estimates for absolute
    values of: (a) channel coefficient for the RF source to tag link, and (b) the
    composite channel coefficient involving the sum of direct and backscattered (which
    is the scaled product of forward and backward coefficients) channels. ML based
    detection methods can also be employed to detect modulated signals at the backscatter
    receiver [29], [46], [80], [93]. Specifically, [46] focuses on the problem of
    signal detection and bit-error-rate performance analysis at the reader. Minimum-bit-error-rate
    detector, the optimal detection threshold, expressions and both upper and lower
    closed-form bit-error-rate bounds are derived. Non-coherent signal detection for
    ABCSs, including optimal/suboptimal detectors, bit-error-rate computation, outage
    analysis, threshold derivation, blind parameter acquisition are further investigated
    in [29]. Moreover, [93] studies semi-coherent detection for a typical ABCS. Semi-coherent
    alludes to the fact that a few training symbols are sent to acquire only the parameters
    necessary for signal detection rather than full channel states themselves. Detection
    algorithms can also be designed to take advantage of spatial diversity available
    in multiple-antenna ABCSs to overcome channel fading and to increase the communication
    range. For instance, a ratio detector and antenna selection for ABCSs with multiple
    receive antennas have been developed [94]. Moreover, [95] considers ABCSs with
    multiple-antenna tags and focuses on the signal detection problem. A maximum-eigenvalue
    based detector is also developed in [96] with multiple-antenna reader. The problem
    of blind detection of ambient backscatter signals from a multi-antenna tag has
    been addressed via the generalized likelihood ratio test [97]. Finally, [98] develops
    three detectors for ABCSs with multiple-antenna tags which require neither CSI
    nor the RF signal power and the noise variance at the reader. An antenna selection
    scheme is also proposed. B. Channel Coding and Decoding The purpose of coding
    is to support the recovery of data across noisy channels. It ensures the reliability
    of data transmissions by protecting the message from interference, collision,
    and intentional modification of certain signal characteristics. At the backscatter
    receiver, the encoded baseband signals are decoded to recover the original message
    and detect any transmission errors. Thus, line coding techniques can be adopted
    such as non-return-to-zero (NRZ), Manchester, Miller, and bi-phase space (FM0)
    [99], [101]. Of these, NRZ and Manchester have been widely adopted in RFID [81].
    However, the NRZ code is poor in handling long runs of “0” or “1” and the Manchester
    code effectively doubles the bandwidth usage. Thus, Miller and FM0 channel coding
    techniques (with the maximum rate of one half) are usually adopted in existing
    backscatter communication systems due to their advantages such as enhanced signal
    reliability, reduced noise, and simplicity [34], [100], [112]. But energy consumption
    differs widely between transmitting/receiving bit “0” and bit “1” under FM0 and
    Miller codes, i.e., the transmitting bit “0” consumes much greater energy than
    that for bit “0” [102]. To alleviate this energy consumption disparity, the energy-efficient
    data delivery scheme (EEDDS) is proposed in [102] that reduces energy consumption
    by using a codebook shared by the sender and the receiver. Specifically, the sender
    breaks original bit stream into multiple m -bit data blocks, finds the corresponding
    codewords of the blocks, and then transmits the codewords from which the receiver
    recovers the original data. This scheme however suffers from large codebook size
    and long delays, which poses implementation challenges. Reference [103] thus developed
    an energy-efficient and easy-implementation coding scheme used for WPN-BCs. An
    energy consumption minimization problem is formulated to derive the codebook,
    where only the blocks with the number of energy-consuming bits being equal to
    or greater than an encoding threshold, are encoded, thereby leading to a smaller
    codebook size. The proposed code based backscatter communication (CBBC) is energy-efficient
    and can be effectively applied in the nodes with restricted memory. As more advanced
    BCSs are being developed, the low rate channel coding techniques, i.e., FM0 and
    Miller, may not meet the emerging requirements such as high data rates, long communication
    range, and robustness. Thus, [104] introduces an orthogonal space-time block code
    (OSTBC) to improve the data rate and reliability of RFID systems. The key idea
    of the OSTBC is to transmit data through multiple orthogonal antennas, which is
    referred to as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless. Through this channel
    coding scheme, several symbols are transmitted simultaneously which are spread
    into block codes over space and time. It was shown that, OSTBC achieves the maximum
    diversity order equal to the number of RFID tag antennas, with linear decoding
    complexity. Reference [105] further investigated the joint design of reader and
    tag signals as well as modified OSTBC for MIMO backscatter RFID systems and showed
    that, the diversity order can be much greater than the number of RFID tag antennas.
    Moreover, [106] highlights that the FM0 coding used in ISO 18000-6C standard for
    RFID tags is simple, but may not achieve maximum throughput. Thus an improved-rate
    6/8 channel block codes for ABCSs have been suggested to address the need for
    high data rates in limited bandwidth scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate
    that the balanced block code increases the throughput by 50% compared to the conventional
    channel coding techniques, e.g., FM0. Short length cyclic error-correcting codes
    are also employed in BBCSs to improve transmission rates [77]. This scheme can
    effectively improve throughput when the carrier emitter is far from the reader.
    Short block length channel codes, with very low encoding complexity, are also
    considered for BBCSs [107]. On the other hand, [108] introduces a low-power encoding
    technique, to increase the communication range and ensure concurrent transmissions
    for ABCSs. Without requiring synchronization operations at the receiver, this
    code reduces the energy consumption as well as the complexity of the backscatter
    receiver. Rather than a pseudorandom sequence, this code uses a periodic signal
    to represent the information. Since the backscatter transmitter supports only
    two states, i.e., absorbing and reflecting states, a periodic alternating sequence
    of bits “0” and “1” is adopted. This code enables long communication ranges, (40
    times than that of conventional backscatter), and also supports multiple concurrent
    transmissions. Recently, [109] has proposed a 2×2 space-time code for backscatter
    communications which achieves almost the same performance as the Alamouti code
    in backscatter channels with considerably lower complexity. This code however
    performs worse than the Alamouti code in conventional MIMO wireless channels.
    This issue necessitate further investigation of the existing simple codes, which
    do not perform well in the conventional channels, but do well in the backscatter
    channel. Moreover, [110] has investigated polar codes for reliable long-range
    backscatter communications by leveraging the concept of channel polarization.
    This concept is realized by dividing the physical channel into multiple subchannels,
    each of which could be either extremely reliable or very unreliable. This paper
    gives a new polar code that automatically adopts itself to different channel quality.
    This polar code does not require accurate channel estimates and it reduces storage
    overhead of the coding matrix and energy consumption by orders of magnitudes,
    thereby making it feasible on battery-less backscatter tags. In particular, the
    backscatter tags initially encode information bits with a high code rate, and
    then add redundant bits in an extra transmission according to the decoding requirement
    of the receiver. Thus, this scheme achieves up to 10× throughput gain, or extends
    the range limit by 1.8× compared with PLoRa [111], which is the state-of-the-art
    long-range backscatter with tag-receiver distances up to 1.1 km. Table 4 shows
    the summary of coding schemes for backscatter communications systems. TABLE 4
    Summary of Coding Schemes C. Deployments of WPN-BCs In massive machine-type communication
    and IoT networks, due to the dynamic changes of the network topology, flexibility
    of analysis is of great importance in the evaluation of such networks, which enables
    the pervasive and ubiquitous deployment of sensors. It is necessary to have scalable
    and efficient wireless power transfer and communication connectivity. In addition,
    the spatial distribution of wireless nodes plays a critical role in the overall
    energy consumption and spectral efficiency. Thus, stochastic geometry, which is
    the study of random spatial patterns, has been recognized as a powerful tool to
    capture and model dynamic spatial positions of nodes [113]. Thus, the use of tools
    from stochastic geometry makes the performance evaluation of random large-scale
    networks feasible [114]–[116]. The foundations of stochastic geometry are based
    upon several spatial point processes, with the Poisson point process (PPP) being
    the most notable one due to its tractability [117]–[119]. There are also cluster
    process models, e.g., Poisson cluster process (PCP), where daughter points form
    random clusters centered at points from a parent point process [120]. PPP abstracts
    each randomly located point according to a uniform distribution in the Euclidean
    space. However, because of the assumption of independence, the spatial points
    in a PPP may be arbitrarily close to each other. Performance values based on the
    PPP only serve as lower bounds to the coverage probability and mean rate of real-world
    deployment [121]. Consequently, more sophisticated and general geometric approaches,
    e.g., Ginibre point process (GPP) and its variants, have been proposed to model
    the correlation among spatial points. Recent research works have adopted GPPs,
    e.g., the α -GPP and β -GPP, to model the distribution of cellular stations [122]–[125].
    The family of α -GPPs and β -GPPs also includes the PPP as a limiting case, i.e.,
    when α⟶0 and β⟶0 , respectively. These point processes can model random spatial
    distributions arising from geographical and other factors. These more sophisticated
    theoretical models can provide an accurate approximation for the network performance
    in real-world applications [115], [116]. Due to these reasons, stochastic geometry
    has been widely employed to investigate the performance of wireless-powered networks
    [47], [120], [124], [126]–[129]. In particular, in [126], the deployment of power
    beacons (PBs) is investigated for powering a cellular network by microwave power
    transfer based on a stochastic geometry network model. In [127], using a stochastic
    geometry model, the spatial throughput of a mobile ad hoc network powered by EH
    is analyzed. In [128], a stochastic geometry model is used for a large-scale wireless
    powered communication network to analyze the wireless nodes’ performance tradeoff
    between EH and information transmission. Moreover, in [120], a PB deployment strategy
    is proposed where the spatial distribution of PBs follows a truncated PCP. Furthermore,
    [124] investigates the point-to-point uplink transmission of a wireless sensor
    in a network, where ambient RF sources are distributed as a α -GPP. The performance
    of random EH D2D networks is also analyzed [130], [131]. The above techniques
    mainly focus on pure wireless-powered networks and may not be directly adapted
    to wireless-powered backscatter communications. The reason is that backscatter
    communication introduces other practical factors, e.g., circuit power consumption,
    backscatter duty cycle (the fraction of time used for transmission), reflection
    coefficient (the fraction of backscattered incident energy), which may impose
    new challenges on network performance analysis. Recently, some works have adopted
    stochastic geometry tools to design and analyze WPN-BCs [2], [114], [132]–[134].
    For instance, in [2], a large-scale WPN-BC is modeled using the PCP and the coverage
    and network capacities are analyzed with respect to the duty cycle, reflection
    coefficient and density of the PBs. In this setup, each PB serves only a single
    node. Reference [132] extends the network model of [2] to a more generic case
    where energy from multiple nearby PBs is considered and the effects of the densities
    of PBs and backscatter nodes on the coverage and network capacities are investigated.
    In [133], for a single-cell WPN-BC with a massive number of randomly deployed
    sensors, the combined implementation of three collision resolution techniques,
    i.e., directional antennas, ultra-narrow band transmissions and SIC, is investigated
    to boost the performance. Moreover, [125] analyzes the performance of hybrid D2D
    communications based on α -GPP. More importantly, [114] studies the performance
    of a decentralized large-scale WPN-BC ad hac network with sporadic short packets.
    Exploiting time-space PPP model, this work captures the behavior of the network
    with decentralized and asynchronous transmissions. In [134], a traffic-aware backscatter
    communication for wireless-powered heterogeneous networks is investigated. A large-scale
    secondary network whose distribution follows α -GPP is investigated where multiple
    secondary transmitters (STs) employ ambient backscatter communications in the
    presence of a primary network, comprising of Wi-Fi APs or cellular BSs and mobile
    users with the same distribution. ST nodes communicate with a dedicated secondary
    receiver (reader) with the TDMA protocol by utilizing the traffic sources of the
    primary network. D. Waveform and Energy Harvester Design Wireless power transfer
    may help to energize massive numbers of power-limited devices in large-scale wireless
    networks. To reach this goal, a critical component is the energy harvester circuit.
    Thus, increasing the RF-to-DC conversion efficiency of energy harvesters has been
    heavily researched [135]–[142]. The basic structure of an energy harvester is
    rather simple. It integrates an antenna and a rectifier and harvests energy from
    an RF signal and then rectifies and filters it by using a diode and a low pass
    filter. The recovered DC power then either directly powers a low power device,
    or is stored in a super capacitor for higher power low duty-cycle operation [143]–[145].
    The RF-to-DC conversion efficiency of the energy harvester is a function of both
    its design and its input waveform [137]. Therefore, some works have investigated
    the design of the energy harvester [135]–[140], [146], while some others have
    focused on the effect of transmit signal designs [137], [141], [142]. In order
    to develop resource allocation schemes in wireless-powered networks, most works
    adopt linear EH models. As the name implies, according to these models, in the
    harvested power ( p h ) at the user is linearly dependent on the input RF power
    ( p in ) collected by the users’ antenna, i,e., p h =η p in , where 0<η≤1 is the
    energy conversion efficiency [147]. Some empirical works show that, at 2.45 GHz,
    η is measured as from 31.8% to 61.4%, when the receive power level, p in , is
    between −15 dBm and −5 dBm [148]. However, in practice, the energy harvester characteristics
    ( p in vs. p h ) of typical RF energy harvester circuits is non-linear [135].
    Motivated by this empirical fact, a nonlinear EH model is developed based on the
    logistic function [136]. This model, however, does not satisfy the sensitivity
    property; namely that the EH output falls to zero when the input power at the
    EH receiver device is smaller than the sensitivity threshold. Reference [149]
    thus modifies the logistic EH model to address the sensitivity issue. In [137],
    a tractable non-linear EH model is developed through the second and high order
    terms in the Taylor expansion of the diode characteristics. Besides, a piece-wise
    linear EH model is adopted in [140], [150], where the harvested power linearly
    increases with the received RF power, but the maximum power that can be harvested
    by each user is limited. Various energy harvester models, i.e., linear model,
    diode non-linear model and saturation non-linear model, and the corresponding
    signal and system design, i.e., transmitter and receiver architecture, waveform
    design, modulation, beamforming and resource allocation strategies, are investigated
    in [9]. The work mainly focuses on SWIPT systems, however the analysis can be
    well adapted to other types of WPCNs and also their integration with backscatter
    communications. To improve the efficiency and DC output power in WPCNs, special
    designed waveforms, i.e., OFDM, white noise, chaotic and multisine waveforms,
    have been proposed [137], [141], [142], [151]. Multisine waveforms can significantly
    enhance the DC power and RF-to-DC conversion efficiency over a single sinewave
    signal [137], [151]. Recently, multisine waveform methods have attracted great
    attention due to their ability to improve read reliability and read range in RFID
    tags (by increasing RFID tag RF to DC power conversion efficiency) [141], [142].
    It is shown that, with perfect CSI at the RF transmitter (CSIT), significant gain
    can be achieved with optimized multisine waveforms by exploiting the energy harvester
    non-linearity and the frequency selectivity of the channel [137]. In BCSs, dedicated
    RF transmitter typically transmits sinusoidal continuous waveform. However, the
    waveform design techniques, which were used for WPCNs, can be well adapted to
    backscatter communication systems, i.e., WPN-BCs, to improve their performance.
    Besides, non-linear EH models can be further considered which are directly applicable
    to practical systems [118], [152]. For WPN-BCs, since a tradeoff exists between
    the harvested energy at the tag and the SNR at the backscatter receiver, the waveform
    design might be different from that for pure WPCNs. In [153], with perfect CSIT
    and employing the non-linear energy harvester model in [137], a systematic design
    of multisine transmit waveform is designed to enlarge the tradeoff region, thereby
    leading to performance improvement of point-to-point backscatter communication
    system. Besides, in [154], the work in [153] is extended to a multi-user backscatter
    system. An optimization problem is formulated and solved to jointly optimize the
    phases and the magnitudes of the multisine waveform for multiple-tags system.
    Different from the design for pure WPCNs, the authors also optimize the receive
    combiners at the backscatter receiver such that the signal-to-interference-plus-noise
    ratio (SINR) with respect to a tag can be higher than a threshold. It is shown
    that, waveform design based on the non-linear energy harvester model can gain
    a larger SINR-energy region than those obtained based on the linear model. Besides,
    power allocation across multiple sinewaves can effectively enlarge the tradeoff
    region by exploiting the frequency selectivity of the channel and the non-linearity
    of the energy harvester. Moreover, with the increasing number of tags, the performance
    gap between waveform optimized based on the non-linear and the linear model increases,
    however, the average amount of energy harvested at each tag decreases. In [155],
    resource allocation problem in a backscatter-assisted WPCN is investigated under
    the piece-wise linear EH model at a dual-mode operating single-antenna users,
    i.e., the users communicate with a single-antenna AP using two modes of operation,
    active communication and passive backscattering. In this setup, a multi-antenna
    RF source transmits either an energy-carrying signal or an energy-information-bearing
    signal to the users via beamforming. Optimal beamforming vectors are designed
    at the RF source as well as the optimal time allocation for EH, backscatter communication
    and active wireless-powered communication of the users. SECTION III. Performance
    Improvement of WPN-BCs In this section, we focus on the general architecture of
    WPN-BCs and review the existing approaches for performance improvement of them.
    Multiple access techniques, multi-antenna and MIMO systems which are critically
    important to meet the requirements of large-scale communication networks, are
    mainly discussed in this section. Moreover, we review the research works that
    employ artificial intelligence techniques, as powerful tools for signal processing
    and communications, to enhance the performance of the large-scale WPN-BCs. Physical
    security of WPN-BCs as a key components of 5G and beyond networks is also addressed
    in this section. A. Communication Improvements Backscatter communications integrated
    with a WPCN can effectively increase the coverage and diminish the SNR outage
    zone compared to an active radio based WPCN [19]. In order to improve the network
    flexibility and to achieve performance improvements, the hybrid of passive backscatter
    communication and RF-powered active communication has been investigated for data
    transmission [125], [156]–[160]. This architecture enables the user devices to
    operate in different modes, i.e., active mode or passive mode via backscattering,
    according to the energy supply and channel conditions. For instance, when the
    user device has sufficient energy supply, it actively transmits information with
    a higher data rate and enhanced reliability against channel variation, otherwise,
    it switches to the power-saving passive mode and transmits its information via
    backscattering. The architecture of hybrid radio communication and several example
    scenarios are studied in [157]. In particular, in [156], to increase the range
    and also to ensure an uniform rate distribution, hybrid of short-range ABCS and
    long-range BBCS for wireless-powered heterogeneous networks is proposed. Dual
    mode operation is adopted which utilizes ABCS and BBCS as the secondary access
    on top of the primary HTT protocol, as shown in Fig. 4. A throughput maximization
    problem is formulated and solved to optimize the dual mode operation. FIGURE 4.
    The wireless-powered heterogeneous network model with hybrid backscatter communication
    [156]. Show All Reference [158] investigates three time-division based RF EH protocols
    to optimize the sum-throughput of a two-way WPCN comprising a H-AP and multiple
    sensors. The first protocol is the reference time-switching protocol, which is
    a sum-throughput optimized method that harvests energy, decodes data and transmits
    data using orthogonal time slots, τ EH , τ DL and τ UL , respectively. The second
    one is a hybrid protocol, which combines the time-switching and power splitting
    receiver structure. The downlink data decoding phase τ DL is also used for EH
    and the received power during τ DL is split by a power splitting ratio λ , the
    proportion used for energy harvesting, and (1−λ) for data decoding. The third
    one is the combination protocol, which integrates hybrid protocol with backscatter
    communication. In this setup, the sensors that operate in backscatter mode will
    backscatter data to the H-AP during τ EH , harvest energy and decode data during
    τ DL and remain off during τ UL . Whereas, sensors operating in the non-backscatter
    mode will work the same as the hybrid one. It is shown that, the combination protocol
    is the most appropriate for wireless-powered networks with a large sensor population.
    The authors further extend their work to the case where there are multiple multi-antenna
    H-APs, which are connected to a global controller [159]. They consider the combination
    protocol for the sensors and investigated the sum-throughput and fairness maximization
    problem with blind adaptive beamforming at the H-APs. They found that, that the
    proposed scheme delivered up to approximately 296% increase in the sum-throughput
    compared to the reference time-switching protocol in a dynamic environment, achieved
    a dropout rate of 0% instead of 28.5% by the reference time-switching protocol
    at 10mW H-AP transmission power, and increased Jain’s fairness index from J=0.76
    to up to 0.90 and 0.80 with and without sensors operating in the backscatter mode,
    respectively. In [125], a hybrid D2D system is introduced that combines both ambient
    backscattering and WPCN capabilities. The authors design a hybrid transmitter
    and a hybrid receiver, as shown in Fig. 5. The hybrid receiver can receive and
    decode data from both the modulated backscatter and active RF transmission. For
    the hybrid transmitter to choose the mode of operation, i.e., HTT or backscattering,
    two mode selection protocols, namely, a power threshold based protocol and an
    SNR threshold-based protocol are proposed. The authors then adopt stochastic geometry
    to analyze the hybrid D2D communications in terms of energy outage probability,
    coverage probability, and average throughput. FIGURE 5. The structure of the hybrid
    transmitter and hybrid receiver [125]. Show All In [160], a transmission scheduling
    problem is investigated for a backscatter-assisted wirelessly powered IoT system
    to maximize the minimum system throughput where devices can backscatter when other
    nearby devices are actively transmitting via RF. As shown in Fig. 6, each device
    is equipped with an RF energy harvester, which it uses to harvest incident RF
    energy. It then uses the harvested energy to power the RF transmitter when sending
    data directly to the HAP. It can also communicate with other devices via backscattering.
    In this setup, first a H-AP charges all devices using an HTT protocol and each
    device then transmits its data directly to the H-AP using the harvested RF energy,
    or it backscatters its data to some neighboring devices to be forwarded to the
    H-AP. There are no dedicated RF sources and a device can backscatter signals emitted
    by any device within a certain range. The groups of devices that can simultaneously
    backscatter without causing interference are identified and it is shown that,
    the max–min throughput can be increased by 46 and 180 times for linear and random
    networks, respectively, compared with TDMA. FIGURE 6. Hybrid backscatter device
    [160]. Show All Different from backscatter-assisted HTT transmission, the backscatter-assisted
    communication systems considered in [161] support battery-free backscatter transmission
    and the battery-assisted transmission (active radio mode with RF chain). Two adaptive
    mode selection schemes, i.e., power maximization-oriented and outage minimization-oriented
    adaptive mode selection schemes, are investigated with opportunistic SIC. In power
    maximization-oriented adaptive mode selection, based on the comparison of the
    backscatter power in the passive mode and the transmit power in the active mode,
    the mode corresponding to the maximum one is selected. While in outage minimization-oriented
    adaptive mode selection, the passive/active mode corresponding to the minimum
    outage probability is selected. The authors further derived the lower bounds for
    the outage performance in the proposed schemes in closed-form expressions. This
    assumption that the devices can support two modes of operation may not be suitable
    for hardware-constrained IoT devices in practice [19]. Thus, the authors in [19]
    proposed a WPN-BC design aiming to achieve long-range coverage, compared to the
    active radio based WPCN with a short-range coverage due to the doubly round-trip
    attenuation. In this scheme, the user not only harvests energy from the RF signal
    broadcast by the H-AP but also the carrier signal from the carrier emitter deployed
    close by the tag, as shown in Fig. 7. The user first harvests energy in the downlink
    and then transmits its own information in a passive way by reflecting the carrier
    signal while performing binary FSK modulation. It is shown that, the proposed
    scheme can effectively resolve the problem of short coverage and wide SNR outage
    zone in WPCNs due to the doubly near-far problem. FIGURE 7. A backscatter radio
    based wireless powered communication network [19]. Show All In [162], to ensure
    that the instantaneous receive power at the device (located far from the RF source)
    is enough for operation, the authors consider a two-state duty cycle involving
    both the sleep and the active states in an RF-powered communication network with
    ambient backscatter. In the sleep state, the device performs dedicated energy
    harvesting only, where the harvested energy from the received RF signal is stored
    in its battery for further use. In the active state, the device backscatters a
    part of the received RF signal, and simultaneously absorbs the remaining part
    energy of the received RF signal to power its circuit. The authors derive both
    the optimal reflection coefficient and the optimal tradeoff between the EH time
    and the backscatter time, to maximize the network throughput. Reference [163]
    further investigates a optimal time scheduling scheme based on compressive spectrum
    sensing techniques in IoT networks with a large number of IoT nodes. Each node
    is equipped with three modules, i.e., spectrum sensing device to detect ambient
    RF signals, RF energy harvester and backscatter device to transmit data to the
    gateway, as shown in Fig. 8. The authors first employed compressive sensing to
    detect ambient RF signals with high signal power, transmitted in wideband spectrum.
    The detected signals are then used to perform RF EH (partial signals) and ambient
    backscatter communication (the rest of signals), simultaneously. An optimal scheme
    is designed to manage the time scheduling of different modules. It is shown that
    larger transmission rates can be achieved via compressive sensing. The authors
    also analyze the outage probability of the backscatter communication and obtain
    the detection threshold of spectrum sensing for enabling backscatter communication.
    FIGURE 8. The block diagram of different modules at the IoT node [163]. Show All
    User cooperation has also been investigated to improve the performance of WPN-BCs
    [164]. The considered WPN-BC consists of a PB, an AP and two devices with two
    different operation modes, i.e., one in HTT and one in backscattering mode. The
    devices can cooperate to deliver the information to the AP, i.e., the one located
    nearer to the AP can serve as a relay node to assist the far device to transmit
    information due to the low channel quality. A weighted sum rate maximization problem
    is formulated and solved to jointly optimize the time schedule, power allocation
    and energy beamforming deployed at the PB. Asynchronous transmission and sporadic
    short packets, the main important features of IoT and massive machine type communications,
    are investigated in [114]. In particular, the authors consider a stochastic WPN-BC
    ad hoc network consisting of multiple RFID reader-tag pairs where each reader-tag
    pair randomly accesses the same frequency for ad hoc transmission asynchronously.
    The multi-antenna RFID reader works in the full-duplex mode to simultaneously
    transmit query signal and receive information signal from its corresponding RFID
    tag. The authors then analyze the information and outage performance during the
    energy harvest and backscatter modulation phases. The spatial throughput maximization
    is also investigated and it is shown that there exists the optimal tradeoff between
    the duration of two phases for spatial throughput maximization. Energy efficiency
    of WPN-BCs is also investigated [165]–[167]. In [165], the energy efficiency of
    a single backscatter link is maximized via jointly optimizing time allocation,
    reflection coefficient and transmit power of the dedicated RF energy source. Moreover,
    the authors in [166], consider a WPCN with two backscatter links and maximize
    the minimum link energy efficiency by jointly optimizing the PB transmission power
    and the backscatter reflection coefficient. Table 5 shows the summary of communication
    improvements for WPN-BCs. TABLE 5 Summary of Communication Improvements for WPN-BCs
    B. Multiple-Access Schemes and Protocols Developing multiple access techniques
    for WPN-BCs is crucially important. The problem is to figure out how a single
    reader may be utilized to serve multiple tags. In this case, the reader will receive
    multiple uplink backscattered signals. For instance, in a warehouse, a single
    reader may be deployed to collect data simultaneously from a massive number of
    items equipped with RFID tags. This causes collisions/interference at the receiver.
    Due to the resulting data loss, re-transmissions may be needed, which negatively
    affects both energy efficiency and spectral efficiency [168]. Thus, this again
    emphasizes the need for efficient multiple access techniques for backscatter systems,
    i.e., WPN-BCs. Common multiple access techniques are orthogonal multiple access
    (OMA) where each user can exploit orthogonal communication resources within either
    a specific spatial direction, time slot, frequency band, or code in order to avoid
    multiple access collisions/interference [8]. A simple solution to avoid collisions
    between multi-tag transmissions are OMA schemes such as spatial division multiple
    access (SDMA) [133], frequency division multiple access (FDMA) [133], TDMA [19],
    [169], code division multiple access (CDMA) [170]–[172], and orthogonal frequency
    division multiple access (OFDMA) [173], among which TDMA is mostly adopted in
    backscatter communications due to its simplicity. In particular, in [66], a FABCS
    over ambient OFDM carrier is considered where a full-duplex AP with two antennas,
    transmits downlink signal which not only carries information for the legacy user
    but also transfers energy to the multiple backscatter devices, while at the same
    time, the backscatter devices transmit uplink information via backscattering similar
    to the TDMA protocol. The minimum throughput of the backscatter devices is maximized
    by the joint optimization of backscatter time allocation, power reflection coefficients,
    and full-duplex APs’ subcarrier power allocation. In addition, [22] proposes a
    backscatter-assisted WPCN that includes a full-duplex H-AP and multiple users.
    The full-duplex H-AP uses one antenna for transferring energy to the users in
    the downlink, and one antenna for receiving signals from the users in the uplink,
    simultaneously. The users switch between HTT and backscatter modes adaptively
    and transmit or backscatter information to the HAP in TDMA. In this set up, the
    authors maximize the sum-throughput by studying the optimal transmission policy,
    including both the optimal working mode permutation and time allocation. The main
    problem with OMA techniques is that the number of orthogonal channels has an upper
    bound. Consequently, the number of users that can be served simultaneously will
    hit this bound, especially for massive IoT devices. Nonorthogonal multiple access
    (NOMA) has thus been developed as an effective solution to overcome this hard
    limitation, where multiple users are served in each orthogonal resource block,
    e.g., a time slot, a frequency channel, a spreading code, or an orthogonal spatial
    degree of freedom [174], [175]. Thus, power-domain and code-domain NOMA schemes
    have been developed. The code-domain NOMA utilizes user-specific spreading sequences
    to enable the concurrent use of the same resource, while power-domain NOMA exploits
    channel-gain disparities among users to achieve the same goal and has the advantages
    of low latency and high spectral efficiency [175]. Therefore, backscatter communication
    with NOMA has recently been recognized as a promising spectrum-, energy- and cost
    efficient technology for enabling low-power IoT networks [176]–[180]. A hybrid
    channel access scheme by combining TDMA with power-domain NOMA for multiplexing
    the backscatter nodes in different regions or with different power levels, has
    been proposed [176], [180] to enhance the spectrum efficiency, outage probability
    and throughput of MBCSs. Reference [177] considers a NOMA-enhanced ABCS comprising
    four nodes, namely, the BS, the backscatter device, the nearby cellular user,
    and the far-away cellular user. The BS transmits the superposition message to
    the users at the same resource block with different powers. The backscatter device
    also transmits its information to nearby cellular user, over the signal received
    from BS. The nearby cellular user first decodes the information of the far-away
    cellular user, then its own information, and finally the backscatter device information.
    The far user, however, only decodes its own information. The authors then analyze
    the outage and ergodic rate performance of the system. On the other hand, [178]
    considers the NOMA-enhanced BBCS with dynamic TDMA and maximized the minimum throughput
    of multiple backscatter nodes by jointly optimizing backscatter time allocation,
    power reflection coefficient while ensuring sufficient harvested energy and SINR
    for NOMA decoding. Moreover, [179] investigates a NOMA-enhanced dynamic TDMA transmission
    scheme for full-duplex symbiotic radios, where a full-duplex AP transmits downlink
    OFDM signals to a legacy user and simultaneously receives signals backscattered
    from multiple passive backscatter devices. The minimum throughput among multiple
    backscatter nodes is maximized by jointly optimizing the full-duplex APs’ subcarrier
    power allocation, the nodes’ backscatter time and power reflection coefficients
    subject to the legacy user’s throughput requirement and the harvested energy requirements
    of the backscatter nodes. In [169], the hybrid of NOMA and TDMA is considered
    in a backscatter-assisted WPCN comprising a PB, an information receiver and multiple
    users that can work in either backscattering mode or HTT mode. The authors also
    derive optimal time allocation policies to maximized the system throughput. For
    simultaneous transmissions from multiple devices in large-scale backscatter networks,
    the NetScatter protocol is suggested [181] which adopts the combination of chirp
    spread spectrum modulation and OOK to enable hundreds of backscatter devices to
    simultaneously backscatter their information to an AP. It is shown that, the NetScatter
    protocol can support concurrent transmission from 256 backscatter devices with
    the data rate of 500 kbps and communication range of 2 meters. Reference [172]
    further analyzes the coded-backscatter multiple access (CBMA) scheme for backscatter
    communication where multiple tags simultaneously transmit data to the receiver
    in the same frequency. The authors investigate the correlation-based detector
    and power control at the tag to respectively reduce the negative effects caused
    by the asynchronous problem and improve the performance against the significant
    power difference among tags. It is shown that, the proposed scheme can achieve
    a 10-tag bit rate up to 8 Mbps with tag-receiver distances up to 10 meters. For
    large-scale networks, it may not be efficient to deploy the centralized MAC protocols,
    e.g., TDMA, FDMA, only for sporadic backscatter communications requirement due
    to the complexity, the energy consumption and the dynamic change of network topology,
    i.e., backscatter devices frequently join or leave from the network. Moreover,
    some critical data messages with high quality of service (QoS) requirements can
    hardly be transmitted in time and the frequency spectrum resources could be wasted
    due to the inflexibility of the centralized schemes. To overcome these challenges,
    distributed MAC protocols have been investigated and MAC-layer performance has
    been also analyzed in addition to physical-layer performance [182]–[184]. For
    these reasons, [182] proposes a modified coordination based the dominant channel
    occupancy (DCO) protocol, where backscatter tags use the RF signals of the Wi-Fi
    helper to communicate with the reader. The backscatter tags contends for the transmission
    together with the Wi-Fi station for a shared channel. Reference [183] further
    proposed a Distributed and Demand-Based (DDB) protocol for a heterogeneous network,
    where backscatter tags use the Wi-Fi signals to transmit information to the AP.
    Unlike [182], the authors considered the AP’s demand for the information of backscatter
    device, and let the Wi-Fi device and backscatter device perform the distributed
    contention in a separate manner. When the AP has a demand to collect the tag information,
    it contends with the wireless devices and sends the CTS_to_self packet upon success
    to suspend their transmissions and reserve the channel. Then, it sends preambles
    to excite the backscatter tags and all the tags will adopt CSMA/CA protocol to
    contend for transmission within this reserved time period. The authors then analyze
    the MAC-layer performance in terms of per-node throughput. Reference [184] investigates
    an opportunistic MAC protocol for backscatter communications in a heterogeneous
    wireless powered IoT network consisting of EH devices coexisting with backscatter
    tags, a backscatter reader and an H-AP. In this network, the wireless devices
    communicate with the H-AP based via HTT and the backscatter tags utilize H-AP’s
    RF energy signal to operate and transmit information to the backscatter reader.
    The EH devices contend for the channel and use a handshaking method to reserve
    the channel to harvest and/or transmit data. The reader listens to the channel
    and excites the backscatter tags for contention and communication when it finds
    the RF energy signal of the H-AP. The authors further compare the performance
    of the proposed MAC protocol with DCO protocol [182] and DDB protocol [183], in
    terms of throughout, i.e., the successful data transmission over total time which
    depends on the idle slots, success, and collision of the transmissions. It is
    shown that, unlike DCO and DBB protocols for which throughput significantly decreases
    with the increase of nodes, the proposed protocol shows a steady throughput performance
    and it is also more collision-resilient due to its contention and channel reservation
    mechanism. In [185], a distributed MAC protocol for ABCS is proposed where the
    backscatter devices achieve power-efficient channel access via the RF signals
    according to their traffic requirements in a distributed way. The authors consider
    the coexistence of the traditional RF communications (consisting of a continuous
    RF source and the legacy users) and ABCSs (consisting of a large number of backscattter
    devices). The proposed MAC protocol also support the backscatter communications
    among backscatter devices, and each backscatter device can switch among backscatter
    transmission, receiving and EH in a distributed fashion by combining an analog
    channel sensing strategy with the dual-backoff mechanism. This mechanism contains
    two dimensions where the first-dimension backoff is to achieve collision avoidance
    (CSMA/CA scheme), and the second-dimension backoff aims to reduce the channel
    waste during the energy harvesting. The authors develop a three-dimensional Markov
    model with the consideration of the false alarm and the miss detection problems
    occurring while sensing, to analyze the normalized throughput of the proposed
    MAC protocol. It is shown that, the proposed MAC protocol operates well under
    the strict-low power consumption for IoT networks. In [186], in order to provide
    seamless wireless communications to massively deployed IoT nodes with few or no
    collisions in WPCNs, coordinating channel access among a large number of sensor
    nodes in a distributed manner is investigated. The authors proposed a group-based
    MAC protocol to distribute the sensor nodes into groups based on their co-location.
    The group head, a H-AP, uses a coordinating mechanism to send collected data from
    sensor nodes to the BS. The sensor nodes harvest energy or transmit data to the
    H-AP in their active time and are sleep during the inactive time. The nodes with
    sufficient energy concurrently access the medium and transmit data by using a
    frame slotted ALOHA to reduce collisions; if more than one node simultaneously
    transmit data during a slot, the outcome may result in collision and re-transmission
    is needed by the nodes in the active time of the next frame. It is shown that,
    the proposed distributed group-coordination mechanism can effectively mitigate
    the inter-group and intra-group collisions, thereby achieving significant performance
    in terms of network throughput and energy efficiency. C. Multi-Antenna and MIMO
    Systems Exploiting multiple antennas at tags/readers provide several benefits
    for backscatter communications [187], [188]: 1) A multiple-antenna tag can perform
    EH and backscattering simultaneously, unlike a single antenna tag [34], [97],
    [98], 2) Multiple antennas at the reader are essential for both downlink excitation
    and uplink detection [114], [189]–[191], 3) Increasing the number of tag/reader
    antennas may enlarge the communication range between the tag and the reader in
    conventional radio backscatter systems [40], [189], [192], and 4) Multiple-antenna
    tags/readers increase diversity gain and thus enhance communication reliability
    and lower the bit-error-rate of conventional radio backscatter systems [104],
    [193]. In order to improve throughout, RFID MIMO systems have been investigated
    for backscatter communications [28]. Reference [187] propose a unitary query at
    the reader query end in the M×L×N MIMO backscatter RFID comprising three components:
    the query end (with M reader transmitting antennas), the tag end (with L tag antennas)
    and the receiving end (with N reader receiving antennas). The proposed unitary
    query can provide time diversity within each channel coherent interval, and improve
    the performance by 5–10 dB in the mid-range SNR regimes. The authors further extended
    the unitary query to block-level unitary query with the corresponding modified
    STBC in [105]. It is shown that, the proposed scheme can achieve full diversity
    of classical OSTBC. Multiple antennas indicate multiple channel parameters between
    the tag and the reader, which significantly challenges signal detection because
    the tag has limited power and can transmit few training symbols only. Thus, efficient
    signal detection and channel estimation techniques for MIMO backscatter communications
    have also gained much interest [66], [97], [98], [189]–[191], [193], [194]. In
    particular, [189] investigates the efficacy of a full-duplex MIMO reader for enhancing
    the limited communication range of MBCSs. A novel least-squares estimator for
    the forward and backward links between the reader and the tag and also corresponding
    linear minimum-mean square-error estimate for the backscattered channel are derived
    in a single-tag BSC setting. The authors further consider multi-tag backscatter
    setting in [190], as shown in Fig. 9. A novel channel estimation algorithm is
    presented by considering practical constraints like unintended ambient reflections
    (UAR), preamble design for the tags. Optimal transceiver designs are then obtained
    for the multi-antenna reader to maximize common backscattered throughput among
    the single-antenna semi-passive tags. As well, [191] maximizes the achievable
    sum backscattered-throughput by jointly optimizing the transceiver design at the
    multi-antenna reader and backscattering coefficients at the single-antenna tags.
    Furthermore, the authors in [193] propose an ML-based backscattering detection
    protocol for MBCSs with the multi-antenna reader and derive closed-form expressions
    for the optimal detection threshold and bit-error-rate. Channel estimation and
    signal detection in an ABCS with a multiple-antenna tag are also investigated
    [97], [98]. Fig. 10 shows an ABCS with a multi-antenna tag where the tag can perform
    energy harvesting and backscatter modulation, simultaneously. For backscatter-assisted
    wireless-powered networks, two-antenna H-AP working in full-duplex mode is also
    considered [22]. FIGURE 9. A MBCS with a full-duplex multi-antenna reader and
    multiple semi-passive single-antenna tags, with optimal transceiver design for
    reader [190]. Show All FIGURE 10. The multi-antenna-tag ambient backscatter system
    [98]. Show All Energy beamforming is also investigated for WPN-BCs where a multiple-antenna
    system focuses the transmitted energy to the direction of the receiver [14], [164],
    [195]. A combination of backscatter communication and retro-directive beamforming
    for energy beamforming is introduced in [14]. Retro-directive beamforming is a
    simple technology, which requires neither knowledge of the user location nor any
    complex beamforming algorithm; a multi-antenna BS automatically steer a radio
    beam toward a target user based on the signal transmitted by the user and received
    at the BS. The authors in [195] investigate a simple energy beamforming technique
    for a multi-user networks that combines large antenna retro-directivity with signal
    backscattering. In particular, the energy beamforming technique consists of two
    phases. In the first phase, the energy transmitter (PB) generates and broadcasts
    an unmodulated single-tone waveform and each energy receiver (backscatter device)
    reflects back a part of the received signal without further processing. In the
    second phase, the PB performs matching filtering on the received signal to detect
    the phase of the signal and transmit energy signal by using phase conjugation.
    The impact of reflection coefficient on the performance is also investigated.
    Moreover, in [164], energy beamforming is deployed at the PB to improve energy
    transmission for the nodes in WPN-BCs. Reference [159] also investigates the performance
    of a wireless-powered network using multiple blind adaptive beamforming H-APs
    and backscatter communication-enabled combination sensors [158]. In this setup,
    The impact of the number of antennas and H-APs on the sum-throughput, throughput
    fairness and sum-throughput and fairness tradeoff is investigated. On the other
    hand, the authors in [196] design transmit beamforming at a mutli-antenna primary
    transmitter (PT), which transmits its primary information to a single-antenna
    primary receiver, and at the same time enables a single-antenna backscatter device
    to transmit its own information to the primary receiver. The transmit beamforming
    is designed such that either the weighted sum rate of the primary and backscatter
    device transmissions is maximized or the PT’s transmit power is minimized under
    rate constraints. The complexity of these schemes however increases exponentially
    as the number of antennas at the PT increases. Thus, the authors further propose
    a low-complexity beamforming structure, which can be well adopted in the case
    of the large-scale antenna array at the PT. D. Artificial Intelligence Artificial
    intelligence techniques are capable of solving complex problems without explicit
    programming and have recently been vigorously considered for signal processing
    and communications [197]–[202]. In particular, machine learning can be used for
    ultra-dense communications, e.g., massive machine type communication [202], large-scale
    MIMO [203] networks, to answer the challenge of supporting a huge number of devices
    in cellular network including QoS provisioning, handling highly dynamic and sporadic
    traffic flows of massive machine type communication and IoT networks and large
    signalling overheads [204]. It is shown that, machine learning algorithms can
    improve channel estimation and signal detection [205]. For example, signal detection
    for ABCSs by using unsupervised learning and other machine learning approaches
    has been studied [43], [206]. By exploring the received signal constellation information,
    these works have proposed a modulation-constrained expectation maximization algorithm.
    Interestingly, their constellation learning methods achieve comparable performance
    as the optimal detector with perfect channel-state information. Moreover, in [207],
    a reinforcement learning approach is proposed to maximize the long term average
    throughput for ABCSs when the distribution of the ambient RF signal strength is
    unknown. It is shown that, the proposed learning method produces a close-to-optimal
    throughput performance, and significantly outperforms the greedy policy (where
    the tag chooses signal backscattering mode if it has sufficient energy to transmit
    information, or energy-harvesting mode otherwise). The authors in [208] also consider
    the data scheduling and admission control problem of a backscatter sensor network.
    The authors formulate the problem as a Markov decision process, and a reinforcement
    learning algorithm is applied to obtain the optimal policy that minimizes the
    weighted sum of delay of different types of data, e.g., urgent or normal. Recently,
    deep reinforcement learning techniques have shown tremendous potential in the
    field of distributed dynamic spectrum access [199], [209]. Motivated by this,
    a distributed deep reinforcement learning based MAC protocol is proposed in [210]
    to assist the backscatter communications for IoT networks by leveraging Wi-Fi
    signals. With this protocol, the Wi-Fi AP can dynamically learn the served backscatter
    devices and the reserved step of the served backsatter devices, which allows the
    AP to determine the action and thus achieve the optimal throughput performance.
    Reinforcement learning algorithms have also gained much interest in order to optimize
    the performance of the RF-powered cognitive radio networks (CRNs). In particular,
    the authors in [211] leverage reinforcement learning algorithms to investigate
    optimal sensing, channel probing, i.e., CSI estimation process, and transmission
    power control for an ST operating in a fading channel with harvested energy from
    ambient sources. Learning algorithms have been further investigated for backscatter-assisted
    wireless-powered CRNs for time scheduling and optimal policies [134], [212], [213]
    (Section IV-A). E. Physical Layer Security The widespread deployment of wireless-powered
    backscatter communications and the lack of strong protection schemes makes these
    systems vulnerable to security attacks such as eavesdropping and jamming [214]–[216].
    WPN-BCs with simple coding and modulation schemes may suffer from potential security
    attacks which adversely impact the performance and reliability of the systems.
    Securing backscatter communication systems is challenging due to its passive nature
    and also practical limitations, in terms of cost, size and computation. Moreover,
    typical security solutions such as encryption, which provide an acceptable level
    of security against a number of attacks, cannot fully satisfy all the requirements
    of resource-constrained backscatter systems and exhibit several limitations in
    such systems [214], [217]. Developing physical-layer security (PLS) mechanisms,
    as an alternative or complement to cryptography, is a promising direction to overcome
    the above limitations and strengthen the security of backscatter systems [214].
    PLS techniques fundamentally enhance wireless communication security at the physical
    layer. They exploit wireless channel characteristics, e.g., noise, fading, interference,
    dispersion and diversity, to construct equivalent channels via signal design and
    power allocation such that the superiority of the equivalent legitimate channel
    to the equivalent wiretap link is established [214], [218], [219]. One promising
    approach to deteriorate the channel condition of the eavesdropper is to inject
    an artificially generated noise [218]. Following this idea, [214] investigates
    the secrecy rate of a single-reader and single-tag model for an RFID system, where
    terminals employ a single antenna. The reader injects a randomly generated noise
    signal that is added to the standard continuous wave signal to interfere with
    an eavesdropper. To maximize the secrecy rate, this approach necessitates the
    power allocation between the continuous wave signal and the artificial noise.
    It is shown that the proposed approach can significantly improve the secrecy performance.
    This work is extended to a more general MIMO RFID system in [219] and the secrecy
    rate maximization is investigated by optimizing the supply energy and precoding
    matrix of artificial noise at the reader. To further improve the security of RFID
    systems, [220] deploys beam steering using a one-dimensional antenna array at
    the tag in addition to the noise injection from the reader side. Secrecy rate
    of the relay-assisted RFID systems is also investigated [221], [222]. Moreover,
    in [223], secrecy outage probability is investigated for an RFID system with multi-tag
    selection. On the other hand, [215] investigates the PLS performance of a multi-antenna
    RFID system with practical binary inputs at the single-antenna tag. In order to
    improve the secrecy energy efficiency of the system, instead of direct using artificial
    noise, one randomized continuous wave signal is used at the reader for security
    enhancement. The secrecy rate is maximized by optimizing the parameters related
    to the continuous wave signal to tackle the stability-variance tradeoff between
    balancing legitimate signal reception and eavesdropper mitigation. Compared to
    passive eavesdroppers, the proactive eavesdropper, which broadcast its own continuous
    wave signal, can extract the on-tag messages more confidently and interfere with
    the information detection at the reader simultaneously [216]. This type of attacks
    can cause severe security threat for RFID systems [216], [224]. In particular,
    [216] investigates security issues in an RFID system in the presence of a proactive
    eavesdropper. The authors propose a secure transmission scheme at the reader in
    which the wiretap channel is estimated and the artificial noise-aided continuous
    wave signal is designed for secrecy transmission. Very few works have investigated
    PLS in ABCSs [225]–[227]. Securing ABCSs faces several challenges because the
    backscatter transmitters are simple devices and the RF sources are not controllable.
    The authors in [226] study an artificial noise-aided tag scheduling scheme in
    an ABCS comprising multiple tag, a reader and an eavesdropper. In the proposed
    scheme, a tag is selected for information transmission and another tag for artificial
    noise generation at the same time. It is shown that the proposed method with SIC
    at the reader can improve the average secrecy rate. The authors then propose a
    cooperation-based multi-tag scheduling method in [227], which selects a tag for
    data transmission and another tag for cooperative transmission (the same data)
    to assist a receiver. These two strategies are evaluated in terms of bit error
    rate and secrecy rate. SECTION IV. Emerging Wireless-Powered Backscatter Systems
    Sixth generation (6G) communications are expected to raise features currently
    set by 5G communications with the provision of enhanced services from the perspectives
    of network data availability, mobile data rate, and seamless ubiquitous connection.
    Attaining a cost-effective approach toward rapid network deployment, reduction
    in the price of mobile communications’ utilization, approaches to network devices
    battery life longevity are some critical challenges associated with the next generation
    communications [228]. A fundamental goal of 6G communication is to perform whenever
    and wherever possible with battery-free communications, aiming at 1 pico-Joules
    per bit communication efficiency [229]. These requirements necessitate the incorporation
    and accumulation of innovative and divergent technologies. Due to the undeniable
    advantages of WPN-BCs, this prominent technology can be further integrated with
    other emerging technologies to realize 6G visions. Cognitive radio and wireless
    relaying are two technologies that can overcome energy and spectrum limitations
    and coverage of wireless networks [230], [231]. These technologies have also been
    adapted for large-scale IoT networks and power-constrained IoT networks. Moreover,
    using light as the transmission medium, visible light communication (VLC) has
    been identified as a promising technology in RF limited environments that can
    revolutionise the future of wireless communication [228], [232]. It possess certain
    compelling merits, such as minimal deployment overhead in terms of hardware replacement
    and high-speed data communication with the added advantage of improved energy
    efficiency and communication security/privacy [232]. Motivated by this, visible
    light backscatter Communication (VLBC) has been developed for battery-free IoT
    applications to tackle the challenges of directional communication and low optical
    coupling for wideband VLC [233]–[236]. Therefore, in this section, we address
    the integration of WPN-BCs with these emerging technologies. In particular, backscatter-assisted
    wireless-powered CRNs and backscatter-assisted wireless-powered relaying, for
    wireless-powered backscatter systems are reviewed to bring about the best use
    of resources and to enhance the coverage of such networks. Moreover, we review
    the recent research efforts that have been expended on the field of practical
    backscatter communication using visible light for battery-free IoT applications.
    A. Hybrid Backscatter-Assisted Cognitive Wireless-Powered Radio Networks Due to
    the tremendous growth of wireless communications, the spectrum bands become scarce.
    Thus, allocating spectrum bands to a large number of devices is another challenge
    for large-scale IoT networks. Cognitive radio by using various spectrum sensing
    methods [237], [238] facilitates the efficient usage of the wireless spectrum
    [239]. Considering both energy and spectrum limitations in large-scale IoT networks,
    RF-powered CRNs have been introduced and extensively investigated in the literature
    [12], [240]. By enabling RF EH on the cognitive radio devices, not only the devices
    exploit the underutilized spectrum but also opportunistically harness the free
    energy from primary signals. However, since the transmission used in a typical
    RF-powered CRN is usually based on HTT manner, the performance of the secondary
    network is highly dependent on the PTs; a PT with high frequent data transmission
    will leave little time for the STs to transmit over the idle channel, while a
    PT with low frequent data transmission will result in shortage of the harvested
    energy [241]. To tackle these challenges and to achieve the best performance for
    the secondary system, equipping the existing RF-powered CR devices with ambient
    backscattering module, has been introduced as an alternative solution [23], [71],
    [241], [242]. Following this idea, [241] investigated a CRN in which a wireless-powered
    ST is equipped with ambient backscattering module. In this setup, when the PT
    is active, the ST can select to perform EH or ambient backscattering. When the
    PT is idle, the ST can perform active transmission with the harvested energy.
    The optimal transmission policies is then obtained to maximize the throughput
    of the ST in two scenarios, i.e., overlay and underlay CRNs. The authors proved
    that there always exists the globally optimal time tradeoff. This implies that
    the integration of the ambient backscatter technique into RF-powered CRN always
    achieves the overall transmission rate higher than that of using either the ambient
    backscatter communication or the HTT scheme, individually. Besides, in [71], a
    CRN with multiple STs operating in HTT and backscatteing modes is considered where
    during the busy state, the STs transmit information via ambient backscattering
    or harvest energy for the future information transmission, while during the idle
    state, the STs adopt the bistatic backscattering mode or the HTT mode for information
    transmission. The authors maximized throughput by finding the optimal time allocation
    between modes in busy and idle states. In [242], an overlay CRN is considered
    with multiple STs which switch among HTT mode and ambient backscattering mode,
    to communicate with a secondary gateway. The authors developed a distributed stackelberg
    game model of the interaction between the secondary gateway and the STs for the
    optimization of time switching between two modes and interference management with
    imperfect channel condition. Considering the variety of demand requirements from
    STs, the authors in [243] employed the auction approach to assign the time resource
    for the STs in a backscatter-assisted RF-powered network where the secondary gateway
    acts as the seller as well as the auctioneer, and the STs act as the buyers to
    bid for the time resource. Moreover, [244] investigated the dynamic AP and service
    selection in such networks where a group of dual mode STs are within a coverage
    of multiple APs. The authors formulated the AP and service selection as an evolutionary
    game where the STs act as players and adjust their selections of the APs and services
    based on their utilities. Energy efficiency of a backscatter-assisted RF-powered
    network comprising a single secondary link is further investigated in [245] in
    the presence of sensing errors and without assuming knowledge of the PT activity.
    Energy detection-based spectrum sensing is employed and analytic expressions for
    the average achievable throughput, the average energy consumption and the energy
    efficiency are derived. The authors further maximized energy efficiency of the
    proposed network, and evaluate the optimal detection threshold, the optimal energy
    harvesting time and the optimal data transmission time, subject to PT interference
    and energy harvesting constraints. Reinforcement learning algorithms have been
    also investigated in backscatter-assisted RF-powered CRN to deal with dynamics
    of the ambient signals. In particular, [212] investigated a learning algorithm
    with incomplete environment parameters, e.g., channel state, the successful data
    transmission probabilities, that helps the ST to obtain the optimal policy through
    learning from its decisions. It is shown that, the proposed learning algorithm
    with incomplete environment parameters can closely attain the performance of the
    Markov decision process [246] optimization with complete information. Besides,
    reference [213] adopted a deep reinforcement learning algorithm for time scheduling
    in an RF-powered backscatter CRN with multiple STs, where the information about
    the network is incomplete. The proposed algorithm allows the network to assign
    backscattering time, EH time, and transmission time to the STs to maximize the
    network throughput. Moreover, for a large-scale RF-powered backscatter CRN, the
    authors in [134] developed an unsupervised Bayesian non-parametric learning algorithm
    to obtain the information from the primary network such as traffic application
    and popularity, which help to improve the performance of the secondary network.
    B. Backscatter-Assisted Wireless-Powered Relaying Relaying has been considered
    as an effective solution to enhance the communication ranges of power-constrained
    IoT networks. Backscatter communication devices have been regularly used as relays
    to assist the transmission by backscattering the received signals from the source
    node to the destination node, where they can effectively improve the signal diversity
    [156], [157], [247], [248]. Following this idea, [247] studied a relay network
    with multiple backscatter devices which are wirelessly powered by a PB. The backscatter
    devices work cooperatively to help as wireless relays for data transmission. The
    authors investigate the joint design of reflection coefficients of the backscatter
    devices to improve the signal reception with imperfect channel knowledge. Short-range
    backscatter communications may not guarantee the network coverage as the critical
    issue for relay networks. To overcome this limitation and to use the advantages
    of both active RF communication ad backscatter communications, it is considered
    that, the relay nodes have a dual mode transceiver structure and can flexibly
    switch between two operating modes, i.e., active and passive modes, to assist
    the information delivery [157], [248]. This way, the passive devices serve as
    passive relays to improve the performance of the active RF communications with
    proper reflection coefficients. In particular, in [248], a wireless-powered D2D
    network is studied where each user equipment can operate in either active mode
    or passive backscatter communications. The users are wirelessly powered by a multi-antenna
    PB via RF signal beamforming. When there are active communications, e.g., cellular
    network, the users can leverage the existing RF signals for low-rate backscatter
    communication. While, the channels are idle, the PB can beamform dedicated RF
    signals for the users and they can switch to active mode to use the idle channels,
    opportunistically. Cooperation among the users is also considered to further improve
    the performance. When a user actively transmit information, the other users can
    either harvest energy or switch into passive mode to assist the active user. The
    authors first investigated the sum throughput maximization by jointly optimizing
    the energy beamforming strategy, the power control and transmission scheduling
    in two radio modes and then consider the cooperation among the users to further
    improve the performance gain. Besides, in [249], a game-theoretic approach is
    proposed for the nodes to optimize the relaying strategy in a distributed manner.
    Moreover, the authors in [250], investigated ambient backscatter-assisted wireless-powered
    relaying for IoT networks where the relays use the ambient RF resources for dual
    mode operation. The end-to-end success probabilities and ergodic capacity under
    different mode selection protocols are derived based on stochastic geometry analysis.
    Furthermore, in [251], ambient backscatter-assisted cooperation method is investigated
    to improve the fairness in a two-user wireless-powered communication network.
    Dual mode operation extensively used in backscatter-assisted relay networks requires
    complex integration circuits for switching modes and consume much more power.
    These requirements may limit their application in large-scale hardware- and power-constrained
    IoT networks in practice. Thus, [252], [253] proposed a relaying scheme for IoT
    networks where energy-constrained gateways are deployed close to the user devices
    to assist them for information transmission to the H-AP, as relay nodes. In [252],
    multiple backscatter devices, each with one gateway which is located near the
    device, are powered by an H-AP. While a user device transmits data to its gateway
    by backscattering the signals from the H-AP, other gateways harvest energy from
    the H-AP. Then, the gateways use the harvested energy to actively forward the
    received signals to the H-AP in a round-robin fashion. The authors maximized the
    achievable sum rate by optimizing the time allocation between data backscattering,
    EH and data forwarding. The authors in [253] further considered multi-antenna
    H-AP with energy beamforming techniques. Three successive working phases were
    considered for data transmission. In the first phase, the H-AP beamforms energy
    signals to the gateways via a known sequence with unit power to the gateways,
    while all backscatter devices keep idle. In the second phase, the sensors employ
    the signals form the H-AP to backscatter data to the gateways in TDMA manner.
    In this phase, in the duration of each backscatter device, the H-AP focuses its
    signals toward the device via beamforming to enhance energy efficiency. In the
    third phase, the gateways forward the receive backscatter signals from the devices
    to the H-AP, sequentially. The authors investigated the joint design of energy
    beamforming vectors, time scheduling and power allocation. However, the assumption
    that each gateway just assists one user device for transmission may not be efficient
    for large-scale IoT networks. In [37], multi-hop relaying with power splitting
    is considered for massive tags/sensors. The authors investigated ABCSs based on
    Wi-Fi architecture and designed multi-hop and massive tag/sensors backscatter
    transmission mechanism. C. Visible Light Backscatter Communication (VLBC) VLBC
    has been identified as a practical solution for indoor IoT applications [233]–[236].
    The VLC backscatter device harvests energy from the existing indoor lighting infrastructure
    and modulates the reflected light beam as long as the illumination is available
    [233]. Unlike RF backscatter, VLC backscatter enjoys minimal deployment overheads
    in terms of hardware replacements [234]. A bi-directional VLC system, RetroVLC,
    is designed in [233], which uses the retroreflector fabric to backscatter the
    encoded information modulated by a liquid crystal display (LCD) shutter. RetroVLC
    achieves 10 kbps downlink rate and 0.5 kbps uplink rate over a distance up to
    2.4 meters using OOK modulation and Manchester coding. The authors in [234] extend
    the idea of RetroVLC and use a plural of retroreflectors and LCD shutters to form
    numbers of pixels, each pixel can be switched on/off independently to produce
    multi-level signals. Experimental results show that by using 8-pulse amplitude
    modulation (8-PAM), a bitrate of 600 bps can be achieved at a distance of 2 meters
    compared to 200 bps when using the OOK scheme. Reference [235] further upgrades
    the RetroVLC design from coding and modulation perspectives to increase the data
    rate. Specifically, Manchester coding is replaced with a Miller code, which doubles
    the bandwidth utilization. Besides, a trend-based modulation and code-assisted
    demodulation scheme is designed. The proposed approach can reduce the modulation
    time from 4 ms to 1 ms and achieves 1 Kbps ( 8× over RetroVLC) using the same
    LCD shutter. This scheme however frees up the potential to further improve the
    data rate by adding more pixels. It is observed that, the response time of LCD’s
    different charging states is highly asymmetric; that is, charging is much faster
    than discharging, i.e., sub-ms and 4 ms. Reference [236] thus exploits the LCD
    asymmetric response and proposes a delayed superimposed modulation scheme that
    pushes the rate limit to 4 Kbps with an array of LCD pixels, which is 4× the rate
    over the proposed method in [235]. SECTION V. WPN-BCs Applications Miniature and
    low-powered WPN-BCs may provide pervasive connectivity for a myriad of applications.
    Some of the potential areas that can leverage the capabilities of low-powered
    WPN-BCs are smart homes/cities, industrial IoT, bio-medical field and environmental
    monitoring systems. In the following, we briefly review the applications of WPN-BCs
    in healthcare and smart homes/cities. A. WPN-BCs for Healthcare Communication
    systems used in modern medical applications consume comparatively excess energy
    because of the need to generate their own radio signals. For instance, wireless
    capsules used for endoscopy consume up to 10 times more power than the sensors
    [254]. Such excessive power consumption is a drawback, and thus new solutions
    for tiny and low heat-radiation in-body and on-body devices are needed and they
    should be capable of battery-free operation with smart networking. WPN-BCs, without
    any active RF components, can be regarded as an innovative communication modality
    to meet these requirements [255]. The low-powered architecture of WPN-BCs can
    be well-suited for not only capturing sensory data but also transmitting it over
    short distances. Some further applications in healthcare are information registry,
    emergency evaluation, health monitoring and lab analysis [255]. Moreover, wireless-powered
    backscatter-based localization systems can also be a potential technology to facilitate
    social distancing, which may be necessary due to COVID-19 [256]. In the context
    of healthcare applications, WPN-BCs may help with energy management, latency minimization,
    mobility management and cost optimization, which are some of the critical system-level
    objectives. B. WPN-BCs for Smart Homes/Cities In a smart home, a large number
    of passive backscatter tags sensors can be deployed at flexible locations (e.g.,
    embedded in walls, roof, and furniture). These passive tags can be powered by
    either multiple in-house deployed PBs or ambient sources such as Wi-Fi access
    points, TV towers, or cellular BSs. These tags can perform a wide range of activities
    such as gas leakage/smoke detection, monitoring movements, indoor positioning,
    and surveillance. On the other hand, in a smart city, a large number of passive
    tags, energized with the ambient sources, can be deployed in buildings, streets,
    bridges, and parking spaces to improve the quality of life. Passive tags can also
    monitor air/noise pollution, traffic, and parking availability [257]. SECTION
    VI. Open Issues and Future Research Directions Based on our review of recent efforts
    and publications in the field of WPN-BCs, herein, we discuss some open problems
    that require further research attention and specifically ones pertaining to large-scale
    WPN-BCs. A. Interference Management A critical system issue is the interference
    resulting from wireless-powered networks with ambient backscatter on licensed
    users, especially when there are high-rate users. Moreover, for large-scale WPN-BCs,
    massive numbers of devices in close proximity may result in mutual interference
    among them. Therefore, one can investigate sophisticated interference avoidance
    and suppression techniques to not only take care of the communication needs of
    licensed users but also to manage the interference issues in large-scale WPN-BCs
    to guarantee reliable communications with sufficiently high rates. B. Channel
    Coding Schemes As discussed before, backscatter communications could be integrated
    with emerging technologies, e.g., full-duplex, MIMO, CRNs, relays and others.
    Therefore, this integration needs coding and decoding schemes. New OSTBC schemes
    should thus be developed for MIMO backscatter links and their performances should
    be analyzed and quantified. Moreover, well-known error correcting codes, e.g.,
    low density parity check (LDPC) codes and low complexity polar codes, which are
    primarily designed for high-end devices with active radios, may be used with WPN-BCs
    to enable reliable transmission with high data rates [110]. The adoption of these
    codes in power-constrained and low-complexity backscatter tags, the encoder and
    decoder, entails several practical challenges that needs further investigations.
    C. Artificial Intelligence Based Approaches Artificial intelligence techniques
    have recently been vigorously considered for signal processing and communications.
    For instance, deep learning is a powerful tool to extract key features of communication
    systems, e.g., signals, channels, modulation/demodulation schemes and hence it
    can be effectively employed to address many problems in large-scale wireless communication
    systems [199]–[201], [205]. Deep learning approaches to address the challenge
    of CSI sensing and recovery in large dimensional WPN-BCs need further investigations.
    Besides, channel coding algorithms based on deep learning can be well adopted
    in large-scale WPN-BCs. Moreover, in multi-antenna systems, the optimal antenna
    subset selection (e.g., see [258], [259]) problem can be interpreted as a multi-class
    classification and/or decision-making task, which is readily solvable via machine
    learning. Multi-class classifier algorithms are the k-nearest neighbours (k-NN)
    and support vector machine (SVM), Naive–Bayes (NB) and others [260], [261]. These
    may improve the design and optimization of complex and dynamic wireless communication
    systems. D. Multiple-Access Schemes and Protocols In WPN-BCs with a large number
    of devices, high capacity should be offered to not just a single node but as many
    nodes as possible, simultaneously. Through efficient multiple access techniques,
    a large number of devices could be served and at the same time, the interference
    between the devices could be handled and suppressed. Moreover, WPN-BCs require
    new communication protocols to coordinate RF energy and backscatter communications
    together. In particular, decentralized MAC protocols where the nodes are communicating
    in a distributed way need further investigations. To this end, cooperation among
    devices, tag-selection [30], and scheduling algorithms guaranteeing fairness are
    important issues to be addressed. E. Physical Layer Security Provision of network
    security is one of key components of 6G communication networks. Therefore, enabling
    secure WPN-BCs, as an innovative technology to realize 6G visions, is of great
    importance. However, the security aspects of such systems are only marginally
    studied in the existing works. Thus, we must identify effective strategies to
    implement physical security to prevent the vulnerability of different types of
    attacks, e.g., interference attack, denial of service attack, and eavesdropping
    attacks. F. UAV-Aided Large-Scale WPN-BCs Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) [262]
    have the potential to provide wireless connectivity to remote locations due to
    their mobility, and hence, UAV-enabled backscatter communications have been recently
    investigated [263], [264]. For large-scale backscatter sensors, UAVs can help
    to ease the channel estimation process and also to assist data transmission. It
    is shown that, UAVs can act not only as data aggregators but also RF signal emitters
    enabling fast data aggregation and energy transfer at remote locations [262].
    Therefore, the integration of UAVs with WPN-BCs is a worthy future research direction
    to facilitate large-scale communication networks. Joint optimization of UAV location,
    time allocation and reflection coefficient, subject to the UAV mobility and practical
    harvest-backscatter constraints need to be investigated to enhance the performance
    of the large-scale WPN-BCs. SECTION VII. Conclusion In this paper, we have presented
    a comprehensive literature survey on wireless-powered networks with backscatter
    communications, as a key enabler for large-scale low-power and low-cost wireless
    communications. First, we introduced the concepts of wireless-powered communication
    networks and backscatter communication systems. We next focused on their integrated
    usage and applications with the emphasis on large-scale wireless communication
    networks. We have reviewed the fundamentals and design issues of WPN-BCs including
    modulation, channel coding, waveform and energy harvester design and deployment
    of such networks. We have also reviewed recent efforts and existing approaches
    to enhance the performance of WPN-BCs. Furthermore, the emerging technologies
    for wireless-powered backscatter systems have been discussed. We have also highlighted
    some applications of this innovative technology. Finally, we have addressed some
    practical open research problems and future research directions. Authors Figures

    8 Citations Explore all metrics Abstract The advanced cellular network, long term
    evolution (LTE) that presently operates in licensed spectrum has been extended
    to unlicensed LTE (U-LTE) to improve data rate and spectral efficiency by utilizing
    unlicensed spectrum. Carrier aggregation of 3GPPLTE-A supports the aggregation
    of licensed and unlicensed spectrum in small and femto cells to provide better
    user experience. The proposed work consists of two objectives, first to accomplish
    the listen-before-talk (LBT) regulatory requirement of radio communication in
    U-LTE and the second to enhance their co-existence with Wi-Fi/IoT users in a non-interference
    style by reducing the back-off rate of Wi-Fi. The importance of spectrum utilization
    by the incumbent users of unlicensed band for the upcoming Internet of Things
    communications is also a key consideration in this work. The recently evolved
    intelligent technology viz. Cognitive radio (CR) is applied in the proposed system
    model to meet the objectives. A ground research is done in a simulation environment
    of LTE signals and 5 GHz band to evaluate the back-off rate of Wi-Fi. A comparative
    performance analysis between proposed and existing systems are also done and presented
    in this paper. Similar content being viewed by others LTE/Wi-Fi Coexistence in

    An Opportunistic Coexistence Analysis of LTE and Wi-Fi in Unlicensed 5 GHz Frequency
    Band Article 13 March 2023 1 Introduction LTE networks are carrying increasing
    amount of data. Reducing the cell size to meet the data demand is not the complete
    solution and the need for more spectrums still exists. The usage of unlicensed
    spectrum alongside licensed bands provides an attractive opportunity for LTE operators
    to satisfy their subscribers’ data demand. Unlicensed LTE (U-LTE) is most interested
    in enabling its access in 5GHz ISM unlicensed band. The reason is quite simple
    as several hundred MHz of spectrum bandwidth is available in 5GHz. One main constraint
    for accessing these frequencies is being able to coexist with other Wi-Fi/IoT
    users i.e. listen before talk (LBT) is required. In this paper, the proposed work
    realizes the LBT requirement of U-LTE with the usage of cognitive radio (CR).
    The remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows: Sect. 2 gives the
    overview of U-LTE, its evolution and open issues in co-existence with 5GHz band.
    Section 3 describes the features of Cognitive Radio Networks, its compliance with
    5GHz band and spectrum sensing techniques. Section 4 summarizes the existing related
    works of proposed system. Section 5 presents the formulated proposed system and
    followed by simulation architecture and results in Sect. 6. The outcome of proposed
    work is concluded in Sect. 7. 2 Unlicensed- LTE (U-LTE) 2.1 Need for U-LTE The
    3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) [1] got inspired to function on fourth-generation
    (4G) mobile namely LTE to meet the very high data usage by recently evolved multimedia
    applications. 3GPP releases R13 and R14 [2, 3] includes LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) and
    narrow band-IoT (NB-IoT). Also 3GPP release 15 concentrates on LTE-Advanced Pro
    with a data rate of 3Gbps and bandwidth of 640MHz [4]. Besides ultra mobile broadband
    and WiMax (IEEE 802.16), LTE competes with several other 4G standards. Followed
    by the US government approval of the first “LTE-U” devices, T-Mobile USA is ready
    to deploy over 5GHz frequencies [5]. High data rate, low latency, packet optimized
    radio-access technology and flexible bandwidth are the main goals of LTE. Also,
    its network architecture too supports packet-switched traffic with persistent
    mobility and high quality of service. Anyhow, the cellular operators are limited
    by the allocation of licensed frequency spectrum. Qualcomm, Huawei and Ericsson
    influenced the 3GPP standards committee to allow LTE service to run on the 5 GHz
    band. This 5 GHz band is one of two unlicensed bands that are typically used by
    Wi-Fi service. 5 GHz is the Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure (U-NII)
    band and since it is relatively less congested, when compared to the common 2.4
    GHz ISM band and because new software has been developed to make the various signals
    play nice within a shared spectrum band, U-LTE in the 5GHz band is winning acceptance.
    5 GHz band has a shorter communication range due to higher path loss but has wider
    available bandwidth. Figure 1 shows the unlicensed spectrum layout in several
    different main regions at 5 GHz band [1]. Fig. 1 Unlicensed spectrum in different
    regions Full size image 2.2 Carrier aggregation in U-LTE The first design principle
    of U-LTE is the integration with licensed spectrum [6]. The integration between
    unlicensed and licensed carriers both operating LTE is the key operating mechanism.
    The carrier aggregation (CA) mechanisms defined in LTE Rel-10 to Rel-12 can serve
    this purpose in target scenarios. Several spectrums are aggregated to create large
    “virtual” career bandwidths to support LTE services, which is the key feature
    of LTE-Advanced (LTE-A). For commercial purpose, operators deploy CA as the prime
    feature of LTE-A. The current bandwidth (up to 20 MHz) of LTE got enhanced by
    this CA and as well as it ensures the backward compatibility. The users also get
    benefits in terms of high data rates and increased average data rates. CA enables
    the combination of up to five LTE Release 8 (Rel-8) compatible carriers [7]. The
    licensed LTE carriers are Primary carriers and unlicensed carriers are Secondary
    carriers. Since the secondary carriers are under the control of primary in situations
    like load shifting and channel adaption, the security and service QoS are ensured.
    Moreover, control plane messages are always transmitted on the licensed band and
    thus QoS is ensured. The user-plane data can be transmitted on either licensed
    or unlicensed carriers. 2.3 5 GHz band and Wi-Fi/IoT usage The internet of things
    (IoT) or machine-to-machine (M2M) communications is one of the most exciting and
    fastest growing technologies across the globe today. It employs the embedded technology
    with sensors and actuators, connects to other devices or to cloud, and automatically
    transmits information. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, Active RFID, loWPAN, EtherCAT,
    NFC, RFID, etc. are the standards and proprietary solutions used by the devices
    to connect among themselves as well as with cloud [8]. Based on the physical characteristics
    of the environment and presence of obstacles like wood, concrete, metal, etc.
    the volume of sensors, their range and data rates, the technology used to connect
    the devices will be chosen. Wi-Fi has been the most successful among these technologies
    listed above due its adaptability, scalability, ease of use and cost. In view
    of its advantages, Wi-Fi has become a ubiquitous standard of connectivity and
    is used in the residential building, commercial enterprises, educational institutions,
    hospitals, airports etc. As the 2.4GHz band is meant for unlicensed users, it
    is presently heavily crowded and hence, the IoT device communication and Wi-Fi
    are shifting to less crowded 5 GHz band. Therefore, it is necessary to safe guard
    the 5 GHz band for its incumbent users viz. IoT and Wi-Fi. In this perspective,
    the proposed work addresses the importance of saving 5 GHz band for the next generation
    wireless communications. 2.4 Coexistence features Due to non-exclusive usage nature
    of unlicensed spectrum by U-LTE, there are two main challenges. The foremost challenge
    of design of U-LTE is its coexistence with Wi-Fi/IoT systems on a fair and friendly
    basis. The Wi-Fi/IoT systems are the user-deployed systems and they are the incumbent
    users or primary users of the unlicensed band. The PHY/MAC implementation differences
    between LTE transmissions and Wi-Fi/IoT, hinders the direct implementation of
    U-LTE transmissions as it can generate continuous interference to Wi-Fi/IoT systems.
    Second is the coexistence of two or more different U-LTE operators in the same
    unlicensed band. The operation in unlicensed band also needs to factor in the
    regulatory requirements of a given region. In some markets, like Europe, Japan
    and India, a specific waveform requirement on supporting listen-before-talk (LBT)
    at milliseconds scale is required which would need changes in LTE air interface.
    In other markets, like US, Korea and China, there are no such requirements. In
    these countries, with carefully designed coexistence mechanisms realizable by
    software to ensure peaceful coexistence with Wi-Fi/IoT, operators can deploy LTE
    in unlicensed bands that are compatible with Rel. 10/11 3GPP LTE standards. In
    markets where LBT is required, LTE in unlicensed operation can be further optimized
    through air interface enhancement with the introduction of LBT feature potentially
    in 3GPP Release 13 [9, 10]. Number of PHY/MAC modifications is required to meet
    regulatory requirements in LBT regions. The required modifications are defined
    in LTE release 13 and beyond, providing a standard LBT mechanism for LTE to coexist
    with Wi-Fi/IoT and other access technologies within the unlicensed bands. Especially,
    LTE PHY/MAC enhancements are required to meet the functionalities such as clear
    channel assessment, discontinuous transmission (DTX) with limited maximum transmission
    duration, UE support for carrier selection and modified HARQ protocol to enable
    LBT. In summary, it may be arrived that besides Qualcomm, Nokia and Huawei, researchers
    have not addressed the coexistence issue for U-LTE and Wi-Fi/IoT extensively.
    3 Cognitive radio networks 3.1 Features of CRN CR is defined by the Federal Communication
    Commission (FCC) as the radio that is capable of changing its transmission parameters
    as it interact with the environment that it operates on [11]. Increase in high
    data rate requirements has results in increase in wireless communications. The
    inefficacious allocation of frequencies in licensed band leaves white spaces in
    the spectrum while the cellular bands are overloaded [12]. For effective utilization
    of spectrum and also to meet the spectrum demands, FCC revisited the problem of
    spectrum management [13] and this leads to CR invention. The IEEE 802.22 is the
    standard for cognitive wireless regional area networks (WRANs). The main goal
    of CR is to identify the unused licensed spectrum for secondary users (SU) without
    interfering Primary Users (PU) and this method of sharing is often called as Dynamic
    Spectrum Access (DSA). 3.2 Cognitive radio in 5GHz band Cognitive radio is the
    key technology that can enhance the convergence of next-generation wireless devices
    those operate in IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.16 standards. The flexibility in the
    hardware and its feasibility to program for a band or mode enables CR to adapt
    over to an ISM band or up to an IEEE band and even to unlicensed 5GHz bands. In
    5GHz band, two types of networks are considered to be operating, primary and secondary
    or cognitive radio networks (CRN). The incumbent users of 5GHz such as regular
    Wi-Fi users and IoT communications operate the primary network. The cognitive
    radio networks only access the spectral band not used by the primary band. Each
    CRN can be made to use multiple channels for better performance by adopting modulation
    schemes using software defined radio (SDR) devices such as Universal Software
    Defined Radio Peripheral (USRP). Therefore, CR dynamically monitors certain bands
    of the 5GHz unlicensed spectrum to identify the idle spectrum and uses them as
    needed [14]. 3.3 Future of CR In future of internet of things (IoT), the fact
    is that billions of objects are expected to be interconnected through wireless
    results in huge volume of traffic with high demand in spectrum [15, 16]. The spectrum
    is finite in nature and becoming rare and expensive. As a result of it, the IoT
    paradigm requires the innovative CR paradigm to go hand in hand to meet the demands
    of spectrum. Also, based on the approaches of the dynamic use of frequencies pursued
    to provide high spectral efficiency, CR fits itself to support 5G networks. CR
    principles can be incorporated to enable the spectral coexistence of two or more
    than two heterogeneous wireless networks in different dimensions such as time,
    frequency, spatial, polarization, and geographical space through cognitive beam
    forming, cognitive interference alignment, adaptive power control, carrier aggregation,
    dynamic carrier/bandwidth allocation. 3.4 Sensing techniques The various parameters
    of spectrum such as radio channel characteristics, white spaces, transmit power;
    interference, noise and operating environment are sensed and measured by the spectrum
    [17]. Spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks (CRN) is done for two purposes.
    One is to identify the spectrum opportunities (white spaces), other to detect
    the interference in the spectrum. White space detection is done by non-cooperative
    approach (also known as Primary transmitter method) and Cooperative/collaborative
    approach. Non-cooperative approach includes match filter based detection, energy
    based detection, covariant-based detection, cyclostationary-based detection, waveform
    based detection, etc. In cooperative/collaborative approach, a primary user is
    detected based on collective information from multiple cognitive radio users.
    This approach includes either centralized access to the spectrum coordinated by
    a spectrum server or distributed approach [18]. Interference temperature detection
    and primary receiver detection are the other interference based sensing approaches.
    In former method, secondary users are allowed to coexist with primary with low
    transmission power and monitored by the interference temperature level. The second
    method detects the interference based on the primary receiver’s local oscillator
    leakage power. 4 Related works Extensive research has proved that CR is the promising
    technology to improve the spectrum utilization/sharing in an opportunistic manner.
    Few researches have adopted CR to enhance the spectrum sharing in femto cells
    of LTE/LTE-A networks [19, 20]. In such research works femto cells are made cognitive
    to improve the QoS parameters. In [21] authors have studied the Type 2 sensing
    (interference detection) for single-input single-output system of LTE-Advanced
    network. They use conventional energy detection method to sense the spectrum in
    cognitive radio technology and no innovative methods are introduced. Alternative
    methods to sense spectrum is still an open issue for research. The authors in
    [22] analyses the throughput (THR) with changing bandwidth in LTE-A environment,
    Path-loss (PL), the effect of distance between the macro user and femto cell on
    Signal-interference noise ratio (SINR) using cognitive radio. In [23], the authors
    have focused on improving resource efficiency in LTE network by considering CR
    device to device (D2D) communication links. In [24, 25], the quality of service
    (QoS) maximization requirement for secondary users in CRN built upon 3GPP LTE
    platform was experimented. All these research works have tried to cognitize the
    LTE/LTE-A femto cell to improve their efficiency in terms of throughput, spectrum
    sharing, spectrum utilizations, etc. and however no attempt was made to apply
    CR in U-LTE. Co-existence of U-LTE/LTE-A networks with existing wireless networks
    is regarded as the latest paradigms. A considerable research has done to reduce
    the interference level of U-LTE/LTE-A to Wi-Fi users. In early U-LTE with non-LBT
    feature, Qualcomm [9] proposed Carrier Sensing Adaptive Transmission (CSAT) with
    TDM cycle sharing mechanism for coexistence of U-LTE signals with other existing
    wireless technologies. This method resulted in increased delay perceived by U-LTE
    users. Qualcomm has also done the design modifications to meet LBT requirements
    using Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) method and has proven better results. In
    our previous work [26], the coexistence of U-LTE with Wi-Fi in unlicensed 5 GHz
    band in non-LBT fashion was studied. The simulation results proved the unfair
    sharing of spectrum between them. Hence, in this proposed work, considering the
    Indian market scenario, where LBT requirement is mandatory for coexistence of
    U-LTE with Wi-Fi/IoT, the basic feature of CCA is combined with CR for effective
    protection of incumbent Wi-Fi user’s performance and presented in the proceeding
    sections. The Wi-Fi/IoT communications are considered as primary network. The
    U-LTE is the secondary or CRN, which access the idle spectrum of 5GHz when not
    used by Wi-Fi/IoT users. Yet another open issue is the Co-existence of several
    U-LTE operators named as inter-operator spectrum sharing. In this scenario the
    unlicensed spectrum need to be shared among inter operators as well as with incumbent
    users of unlicensed band. However, such is issue is beyond the scope of this paper
    and presented only to serve the purpose of literature review. 5 Cognitive radio
    in U-LTE 5.1 System model The proposed system is so modeled that it utilizes the
    attributes of the CR to optimally operate U-LTE in U-NII band (5 GHz). As LBT
    feature is mandatory in regions like Europe, Japan and India, an efficient mechanism
    is to be devised to share the unlicensed spectrum with Wi-Fi, the primary users
    of the specified band in a non-interference basis and also paving the way for
    the currently evolving IoT or Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications. In Fig.
    2, the deployment scenario of U-LTE along with Wi-Fi/IoT users is shown. User
    equipment (UEs) and IoT devices, by communicating with Wi-Fi access point (AP)
    using the unlicensed spectrum, form a femto cell and become primary users. During
    their communications with eNodeB (eNB), UEs form a small cell and try to utilize
    the unlicensed spectrum and become secondary users. As mentioned earlier, U-LTE
    operates in two modes: supplemental downlink (SDL) and time division duplex (TDD).
    In SDL mode, the unlicensed spectrum is used only for downlink traffic. Operations
    such as ensuring reliable communications, checking availability of intended unlicensed
    channel are performed by eNB node [27]. Fig. 2 Deployment scenario of U-LTE with
    Wi-Fi/IoT users Full size image For TDD mode, the unlicensed spectrum is used
    for uplink and downlink, resulting additional implementation complexity in UEs
    for LBT feature. Latest release of 3GPP LTE standard Rel.13 supports usage of
    unlicensed spectrum in both operating modes [10]. In this work, SDL mode is considered
    and the eNB is equipped with CR for the purposes of detecting idle spectrum and
    communicating without causing interferences to primary users. The proposed method
    of applying CR features in U-LTE for effective utilization of 5 GHz band is given
    in Fig. 3. The request for data transmission from eNB triggers the CR to identify
    the white space or the clean channel by sensing the spectrum. Upon the successful
    identification of the clean channel, downlink transmissions take place between
    the terminal devices. The channel can be occupied for a fixed time named as Channel
    Occupancy Time (CCT) for 10 ms as stated by ETSI standards [28]. To comply with
    the demands of U-LTE and to facilitate the coexistence of them with incumbent
    users in a non-interference basis, CR senses the spectrum at regular intervals
    to cater their needs by allocating idle spectrum until the end of their transmissions.
    Fig. 3 System model Full size image The usage pattern by U-LTE users varies from
    few milliseconds, hours or days in multiples of CCT slots and considered as long
    lasting opportunities. However, there are also short-lasting opportunities where
    spectral idleness will expire before the usage by the U-LTE. But this study focuses
    only on spectrum opportunities lasting at least for few seconds. 5.2 Channel and
    traffic model Considering DSA network of CR, the following are the assumptions
    made to formulate the channel and traffic model [29]. 1. The U-NII band spectrum
    is divided into C identical channels shared by primary and secondary users. The
    channels are assumed to be perfect i.e. they are either busy or free. 2. Newly
    arriving requests from primary or secondary will be allocated a free channel,
    if available. If they do not find a free channel, they back off. 3. For a primary/secondary
    user i, the channel is occupied for a period and available for a period \(T_{Busy}^{(i)}\)
    and available for a period \(T_{free}^{(i)}\). 4. Primary and secondary users
    make requests for channel according to Poisson process with arrival rate \(\uplambda
    \hbox {p}\) and \(\uplambda \)sand they hold the channel for a time, which is
    exponentially distributed with mean \(1/\upmu \hbox {p}\) and 1/ \(\upmu \hbox
    {s}\) respectively. 5. p is the number of primary users with transmission time
    \(\upmu \hbox {p}\). s is the number of secondary users with transmission time
    \(\upmu \hbox {s}\). Their transition rate is defined as p\(\upmu \hbox {p}\)
    and s \(\upmu \hbox {s}\). 6. At any instant of time t, let s (t) and p (t) be
    the number of channels occupied by secondary and primary. 7. When primary and
    secondary users occupy p and s channels, a new arrival of primary request can
    occupy any one of the (C-p-s) channels. 8. When primary and secondary users occupy
    p and s channels, a new arrival of secondary request can occupy any one of the
    (C-p-s) channels. The probability that user i (primary / secondary) occupy the
    channel is given by $$\begin{aligned} T_{i}=\frac{T_{Busy}^{(i)}}{T_{Busy}^{(i)}-T_{free}^{(i)}}
    \end{aligned}$$ (1) The channel occupancy in the U-NII spectrum can be modeled
    using Markov chain. Let \(\Phi \) denotes the set of feasible states where \(\Phi
    = \{(\hbox {s, p}) {\vert } \hbox {s} \ge 0, \hbox {p} \ge 0\) and \(\hbox {s}
    + \le \hbox {C}\}\), \(\upphi (\hbox {s, p}) = 1\), if (s, p) \(\upvarepsilon
    \quad \Phi \) and \(\upphi \hbox {(s, p)} =0\) otherwise. The steady state probability
    of the channel occupancy is given by $$\begin{aligned} P(s,p)=\lim \nolimits _{t
    \rightarrow \infty }\hbox {Pr}\{s(t)=s,p(t)=p\} \end{aligned}$$ (2) Fig. 4 Channel
    occupancy state transition for \(\hbox {s}+\hbox {p}<\hbox {C}\) Full size image
    The balance equation for the channel occupancy state transitions as shown in Fig.
    4 can be formulated as $$\begin{aligned}&[\hbox {p} \upmu _{\mathrm{p}}+ \hbox
    {s} \mathop \upmu \nolimits _{\mathrm{s}}+ \hbox {(C-p-s)} \mathop \uplambda \nolimits
    _{\mathrm{p}}+ \hbox {(C-p-s)} \mathop \uplambda \nolimits _{\mathrm{s}}] \hbox
    {P(s,p)} \upphi \hbox {(s, p)}\nonumber \\&= \hbox {(p+1)} \mathop \upmu \nolimits
    _{\mathrm{p}}\hbox {P(s,p+1)} \upphi \hbox {(s, p+1)} \nonumber \\&\qquad + \;\hbox
    {(s+1)} \mathop \upmu \nolimits _{\mathrm{s}}\hbox {P(s+1, p)} \upphi \hbox {(s+1,
    p)} \nonumber \\&\qquad + \;\hbox {(C-s-p+1)} \mathop \uplambda \nolimits _{\mathrm{p}}\hbox
    {P(s, p-1)} \upphi \hbox {(s, p-1)} \nonumber \\&\qquad + \; \hbox {(C-s-p)} \mathop
    \uplambda \nolimits _{\mathrm{s}}\hbox {P(s-1, p)} \upphi \hbox {(s-1, p)} \end{aligned}$$
    (3) P(s,p) also satisfies the normalization condition, $$\begin{aligned} \mathop
    \sum \nolimits _{p=0}^{C} \mathop \sum \nolimits _{s=0}^{C} P(s,p)\phi (s,p)=1
    \end{aligned}$$ (4) Thus P(s,p) can be obtained, \(\forall (s,p)\in \phi \). The
    probability that a newly arriving primary or secondary is blocked is the probability
    that all the C channels are occupied. Thus the back off probability P back off
    is given by $$\begin{aligned} P_{backoff}=\sum _{p\,=\,0}^{C} \sum _{s\,=\,0}^{C}
    P(s,p) \Psi (s+p=c) \end{aligned}$$ (5) Where \(\psi (f (s, p))\)is an indicator
    function i.e. \(\psi (f (s, p)) =1\)if f(s, p) holds and \(\psi (f (s, p)) =0\)
    otherwise. 6 Simulation The system model is simulated in compliance to Rel. 13
    3GPP LTE standards using Mat Lab showing the coexistence of U-LTE and Wi-Fi/IoT
    in 5 GHz band ranging from 5.0 to 5.3 GHz, 23 channels each with assumed bandwidth
    of 20MHz. For comparison purpose, the coexistence of U-LTE and Wi-Fi/IoT in 5
    GHz band without LBT feature is also simulated and shown. The following sections
    describe the simulation models for both coexistence mechanisms without LBT and
    with LBT along with their simulation results and comparison. A real-time Wi-Fi
    user traffic was collected and used as input data set. On observing real-time
    LTE traffic, LTE signals were generated to match their energy level. Both LTE
    and Wi-Fi signals are fed into the system in a random fashion to enact the real-time
    environment. The network scenario shown in Fig. 2 with SDL mode is considered.
    The network is assumed with macro cells of eNB nodes and picocells with Wi-Fi
    access points (APs). The system under test is evaluated with increase in number
    of users for both Wi-Fi and LTE. The values of the parameters considered to obtain
    the simulation results are listed in Table 1. Table 1 Simulation parameters Full
    size table Fig. 5 Block diagram of channel allocation in non-LBT scenario without
    cognitive radio Full size image 6.1 Coexistence of LTE with Wi-Fi / IoT without
    LBT The block diagram for simulating the coexistence of U-LTE with Wi-Fi/IoT without
    LBT is shown in Fig. 5. Two separate sources, one for LTE and other for Wi-Fi/IoT
    generates multiple signals in random fashion with respective energy and transmission
    time. The Channel allocation system allocates the available free channels for
    the successful transmission between respective source and sink. The U-LTE and
    Wi-Fi/IoT systems occupies the available free channel, transmits for its respective
    time duration and leaves the channel free making it available for other contenting
    LTE or Wi-Fi/IoT sources. But, LTE systems, being high demand in nature, and with
    long communication duration, occupies the channels and seldom leaves. Since Wi-Fi
    systems adopt a contention based medium access control (MAC) protocol with random
    back off mechanism, it finds the medium busy most of the time, resulting in high
    back off rate. Considering a smallcell / femtocell, the number of users assumed
    to be minimum of 10 and maximum of 500. The two scenarios depicting coexistence
    of U-LTE with Wi-Fi/IoT without LBT at different continuous instances of time
    for 100 users are shown in Figs. 6 and 7. In Fig. 6, the channel occupancy status
    during the initial time span of 100 ms is shown. During that time, 13 channels
    out of 23 are occupied by Wi-Fi/IoT signals and the remaining 10 channels are
    occupied by U-LTE signals. Therefore, channels of U-NII band have been occupied
    almost fairly by U-LTE and Wi-Fi/IoT systems during the initial phase of channel
    allocation. Fig. 6 Scenario 1: initial channel occupancy status between Wi-Fi
    and U_LTE signals in Non-LBT Full size image Figure 7 depicts the channel occupancy
    status at later time after 200 ms. Here, only eight channels are occupied by Wi-Fi/IoT
    signals whereas remaining 15 are occupied by U-LTE signals. Due to high demand
    nature of LTE, the channels are occupied by them leaves no space for Wi-Fi systems
    and hence they results in high back off rate. Fig. 7 Scenario 2: Channel occupancy
    status with increased number of U-LTE signals in Non-LBT Full size image The simulation
    was studied with different number of users ranging from 10, 20, and 30 up to 500
    in order to analyze the back off rate of Wi-Fi/IoT signals. The average back off
    rate of Wi-Fi/IoT signals is almost 50% higher than LTE with increase in number
    of users and is shown in Fig. 8. Fig. 8 Back off rate of LTE and Wi-Fi/IoT signals
    in Non-LBT Scenario Full size image Fig. 9 Block diagram of channel allocation
    in LBT scenario with application of cognitive radio Full size image 6.2 Coexistence
    of U-LTE with Wi-Fi / IoT with LBT using CR system The block diagram for simulating
    the coexistence of U-LTE with Wi-Fi/IoT with LBT using CR is shown in Fig. 9.
    As similar to non-LBT simulation system, there are two separate sources, one for
    LTE and other for Wi-Fi/IoT generating multiple signals in random fashion with
    respective energy and transmission time. Due to the application of CR in this
    system model, Wi-Fi/IoT systems are considered as the primary users and U-LTE
    systems as secondary users. Incoming signals from Wi-Fi/IoT sources occupy the
    channels by following their own MAC protocol by means of Channel allocation system.
    Whereas, U-LTE signals, in order to accomplish LBT feature, they follows the ETSI
    standards [28] for channel occupancy through CR system. The CR system assumed
    to be in the LTE access point, on getting a transmission request from LTE source,
    identifies the white space (free channel) in U-NII band and estimates the clear
    channel assessment (CCA) threshold. CCA threshold is estimated by measuring the
    energy level of the free channel for a listening period of \(20 \, \upmu \hbox
    {s}\). If the energy level in the channel is below -80 dBm for the listening period
    of \(20 \,\upmu \hbox {s}\), considering it as low interference level in the channel
    and assumed to be free. The Channel is then allocated for the U-LTE signal transmissions
    for the duration equal to Channel Occupancy Time of 10 ms. After that, if LTE
    source wishes to continue its transmission, it has to repeat the white space detection
    and CCA process for channel allocation. On every channel request and allocation
    process, the Channel Occupancy time for LTE source is maximum 10 ms. Therefore,
    the above process is repeated until LTE source completes with its transmission.
    On every cycle, the channel allocated for LTE transmissions is different or same
    based on the free channel availability. The two scenarios depicting coexistence
    of U-LTE with Wi-Fi/IoT with LBT using CR at different continuous instances of
    time for 100 users are shown in Figs. 10 and 11. In Fig. 10, the channel occupancy
    status during the initial time span of 100ms is shown. During that time, 13 channels
    out of 23 are occupied by Wi-Fi/IoT signals and the remaining ten channels are
    occupied by U-LTE signals. Therefore, channels of U-NII band have been occupied
    almost fairly by U-LTE and Wi-Fi/IoT systems during the initial phase of channel
    allocation. Fig. 10 Scenario 1: initial channel occupancy status between Wi-Fi
    and U_LTE in LBT using CR Full size image Figure 11 depicts the channel occupancy
    status at later time after 200 ms. Here, Wi-Fi/IoT signals occupy 15 channels
    and 8 by U-LTE signals. The channel occupancy measure of Wi-Fi/IoT systems is
    almost same as that of an earlier time span. Maintaining almost the same channel
    occupancy status even after the later time span depicts the fair and friendly
    sharing of channels between Wi-Fi/IoT and U-LTE signals. This leads to the reduced
    back off rate of Wi-Fi/IoT systems. Fig. 11 Scenario 2: initial channel occupancy
    status between Wi-Fi and U_LTE in LBT using CR Full size image The simulation
    was studied with different number of users ranging from 10, 20, and 30 up to 500
    in order to analyze the back off rate of Wi-Fi/IoT signals. The average back off
    rate of Wi-Fi/IoT signals is almost equivalent to LTE and they were maintained
    at minimum level even with increased number of users and are shown in Fig. 12.
    Fig. 12 Back off rate of LTE and Wi-Fi/IoT signals in LBT scenario using CR Full
    size image 7 Performance comparison The proposed system has been evaluated and
    the performance is compared with three other existing methods. The comparison
    results of four scenarios are presented in Fig. 13. The performance in terms of
    channel utilization is analyzed for an average of 100 users in the network. In
    Fig. 13 for scenario 1, the channel utilization is equal for U-LTE and Wi-Fi/IoT
    users. In scenario 2, without LBT, Wi-Fi/IoT users are severely deferred by the
    U-LTE users and the channel utilization is reduced to 36% of scenario 1. Fig.
    13 Performance comparison of and LBT (CR with existing techniques Full size image
    Furthermore, implementing TDM cycling and CCA for coexistence mechanisms are shown
    in scenario 3 and 4. Though the channel utilization percentage of Wi-Fi/IoT users
    in those scenarios got increased to 50% of scenario 1, the LTE users are dominating
    the network and the Wi-Fi back off rate is still prominent. Hence, performance
    of scenario 1 can be appreciated as it proves the fair and friendly sharing nature
    of LTE in the unlicensed band by occupying the spectrum at its free time, without
    causing interference and denying the space for the incumbent Wi-Fi users. 8 Conclusion
    The spectrum utilization of radio frequencies is gaining momentum due to the invasion
    of wireless equipment in every field of human life. In this regard, there is a
    change over from licensed LTE to U-LTE in view of the evident advantages of later
    in terms of speed, cost etc. An improved method is proposed in this work to include
    CR in U-LTE for effective utilization of the white spaces in the radio spectrum.
    Also, the importance of saving 5GHz band for the next generation wireless communications
    is addressed by utilizing the spectrum in fair and friendly basis. The basic attributes
    of channel searching and channel allocation are utilized in this work to optimize
    the functionality of U-LTE in terms of clean channel searching and co-existence
    of secondary users with primary users. The simulation results of coexistence of
    U-LTE and Wi-Fi in unlicensed 5 GHz band in LBT fashion is presented to support
    the fair and friendly sharing of spectrum between them. In this work, only SDL
    mode is considered, where the unlicensed spectrum is used for downlink traffic
    alone. In future work, the utilization of unlicensed spectrum for both uplink
    and downlink traffic will be considered and the coexistence of U-LTE along with
    incumbent users in such scenarios will be studied. The size and the cost of implementing
    CR in UEs raise the challenges to realize the LBT feature and are under future
    research. 9 Future reference In this work, only SDL mode is considered, where
    the unlicensed spectrum is used for downlink traffic alone. In future work, the
    utilization of unlicensed spectrum for both uplink and downlink traffic will be
    considered and the coexistence of U-LTE along with incumbent users in such scenarios
    will be studied. The size and the cost of implementing CR in UEs raise the challenges
    to realize the LBT feature and are under future research. Moreover, in contrast
    to the above work, CR s can be endowed as “brain” in IoT devices to enable them
    to choose the best segments of the network and best frequency bands. Their ability
    to adapt its internal radio parameters to avoid capacity and congestion issues
    caused by environmental changes ensures to provide optimal service to end-users.

    \ spectrum represents a scarce and finite \nresource that is used for transmitting\
    \ information in the radio \nenvironment. This resource is used by several services,\
    \ \nincluding radiocommunication, radio broadcasting, maritime \nradio, and satellite\
    \ communications. \nAt the national level, the assignment of this spectrum to\
    \ \nthese services is managed and regulated by local authorities \n(governmental\
    \ agencies) that are responsible for determining \nthe appropriate frequency band,\
    \ the geographical extent of the \nuse of this band, the maximum transmission\
    \ power, etc. One of \nthe fundamental purposes of these agencies is to ensure\
    \ a \nminimum interference level between the different radio \ntechnologies. \n\
    At the global level, the International Telecommunication \nUnion (ITU) organizes,\
    \ every three to four years, the world \nradiocommunication conferences (WRC)\
    \ 1so as to examine and \nrevise the treaties governing the use of the radio frequency\
    \ \nspectrum. \nNevertheless, the static spectrum allocation strategy \nadopted,\
    \ where spectral frequency bands allocated to a wireless \ncommunication system\
    \ can only be used by that system, has \ncaused the shortage of frequencies. This\
    \ shortage is confronted \nwith a strong demand for spectrum resulting from the\
    \ \nemergence and abundance of wireless technologies and the \nextremely rapid\
    \ proliferation of radio applications developed in \nthe scope of the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT). \nIn addition, while unlicensed bands like ISM (Industrial,\
    \ \nScientific, and Medical) bands can be freely used by all radios \nrespecting\
    \ a specific set of rules, such as a shared channel \naccess mechanism and a maximum\
    \ power per Hertz , they have \nbecome very crowded and can’t accommodate more\
    \ wireless \napplications [1]. \nOn the other hand, the already assigned spectrum\
    \ is \ninefficiently used in all domains, such as the time domain, the \nspace\
    \ domain, and the frequency domain, as shown in Fig. 1. \nThis was confirmed by\
    \ the Federal Communications \nCommission (FCC), which reported in 2002 that the\
    \ radio \nspectrum, in most of the time, was from 15% up to 85% \nunderutilized\
    \ [2]. \nAs a result, it has been found that while some bands are \novercrowded,\
    \ such as those bands used by cellular base \nstations, many other bands are not\
    \ in use or are used only for \nshort periods [2]. \nCognitive Radio (CR) technology\
    \ has been commonly \nregarded as an efficient solution to address the above-\n\
    mentioned issues by enabling the opportunistic usage of the \nfrequency bands\
    \ that are not heavily occupied by licensed users \n[3,4]. \n1 https://www.ntia.doc.gov/category/wrc-19\

    \ Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \n \nFig. 1. Spectrum Utilization\
    \ [3]. \nA Cognitive Radio represents a Software Defined Radio \n(SDR) system\
    \ [5] capable of exploring the radio environment, \nlearning, and deciding to\
    \ use the unoccupied portions of the \nspectrum, called \"spectrum holes\" or\
    \ \"white spaces\", and \nconsequently \nof \ndynamically \nadjusting \nits \n\
    operating \nparameters, based on the decisions made. These decisions must \nimperatively\
    \ take into account the impact on the primary users \n(PUs), which have a license\
    \ on the chosen spectrum and have \nthe higher priority to access it, in order\
    \ not to cause them \nharmful interference. Unlicensed users, which use Cognitive\
    \ \nRadio to access the spectrum, are referred to as secondary users \n(SUs).\
    \ \nFurthermore, the transition from analog to digital television \nhas released\
    \ many frequencies, known as TV white spaces, \nwhich have too high propagation\
    \ and penetration qualities [6]. \nFor this reason, the FCC authorized in 2008\
    \ the use of these \nfrequencies by non-licensed users following a list of rules\
    \ like \nusing the geo-location capability to obtain the available TV \nbands,\
    \ from White Space DataBase (WSDB), before operating \n[7–9]. That has created\
    \ a lot of opportunities for Cognitive \nradio users. \nThe remarkable contribution\
    \ of this promising technology \nto the efficient use of spectrum, the minimization\
    \ of \ninterference, the reduction of cost, etc., has pushed its use in \nseveral\
    \ areas, namely the Internet of Things (IoT). \nThe main objective of this paper\
    \ is to provide a \ncomprehensive survey of Cognitive radio with a particular\
    \ \nfocus given to: \n• Software Defined Radio, as it is the building block of\
    \ \nCognitive Radio system; \n• Spectrum sensing, as one of the most important\
    \ pillars \nto set up a Cognitive Radio system; \n• CR-Based IoT, given that Cognitive\
    \ Radio is one of the \nimportant enabler technologies of IoT. \nTo the best of\
    \ our knowledge, in the literature, there is no \nsuch work that gives a comprehensive\
    \ survey of the three \naforementioned aspects, highlights the relation between\
    \ them, \nand exhibits the future research directions to handle their \nchallenges\
    \ in a single paper. The existing surveys dealt only \nwith a particular aspect.\
    \ \nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: \nSection II gives the\
    \ fundamentals of Cognitive Radio \ntechnology. Section III exhibits an overview\
    \ of Software \nDefined Radio and its different challenges. Section IV provides\
    \ \na detailed view of spectrum sensing and its challenges. Section \nV highlights\
    \ the use of Cognitive Radio in IoT. Finally, this \narticle is concluded in Section\
    \ VI. \nII. COGNITIVE RADIO FUNDAMENTALS \nCognitive Radio technology was first\
    \ introduced by Joseph \nMitola in 1999 to depict an intelligent radio system\
    \ capable of \nreconfiguring dynamically its radio parameters according to its\
    \ \noperational environment and to the user’s QoS requirements \n[4]. Afterward,\
    \ Cognitive Radio has been defined in many \nways by different entities and researchers.\
    \ The Federal \nCommunications Commission defined CR as follows: \n“Cognitive\
    \ radio: A radio or system that senses its operational \nelectromagnetic environment\
    \ and can dynamically and \nautonomously adjust its radio operating parameters\
    \ to modify \nsystem operation, such as maximize throughput, mitigate \ninterference,\
    \ facilitate interoperability, access secondary \nmarkets.” [10]. \nMoreover,\
    \ Simon Haykin defined CR as “an intelligent \nwireless communication system,\
    \ capable of being aware of its \nenvironment, learning, and adaptively changing\
    \ its operating \nparameters (e.g., transmit-power, carrier-frequency, and \n\
    modulation strategy) in real-time for providing reliable \ncommunication (anytime\
    \ and anywhere) and efficient \nutilization of the radio spectrum” [11]. \nAs\
    \ mentioned in the above definitions, the main \ncharacteristics of Cognitive\
    \ Radio are cognitive capability and \nreconfigurability [3,11]. \nThanks to the\
    \ cognitive capability feature, the CR user can \nsense and collect information\
    \ related to its radio environment \nand choose the best channel to use. The collected\
    \ information \nmainly involves transmission frequency, power, bandwidth, \nmodulation,\
    \ etc. \nThe reconfigurability feature allows CR users to adjust \nautomatically\
    \ its operating parameters (transmission frequency, \nmodulation, power, etc.)\
    \ based on the gathered information and \nwithout the need to change the hardware.\
    \ Hence an efficient \nand effective Cognitive Radio system is imperatively built\
    \ on \nSoftware Defined Radio platform. The latter will be briefly \nreviewed\
    \ in the next section. \nA. Dynamic Spectrum Access \nBy means of Dynamic Spectrum\
    \ Access (DSA) techniques, \nCognitive Radio enables secondary users to use the\
    \ unoccupied \nportions of licensed spectrum which are known as spectrum \nholes\
    \ or white spaces. When a primary user appears, the \nsecondary user vacates the\
    \ current band and moves to another \nspectrum hole or keeps transmitting on the\
    \ same band and \nadjusting its transmission power level or modulation scheme\
    \ in \norder not to cause any harmful interference to the licensed user \nor affect\
    \ its QoS as illustrated in Fig. 2 [3]. \n101 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org\
    \ \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,\
    \ \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \n \nFig. 2. Spectrum Hole Concept [3]. \nThere are three\
    \ DSA approaches that the SUs can use to \ndynamically access the available spectral\
    \ opportunities: \nunderlay, interweave, and overlay [12]. \n1) Spectrum underlay:\
    \ In the underlay transmission mode, \nthe SU can coexist with the PU as long\
    \ as the SU operates \nbelow the noise floor of the PU. In other words, the \n\
    coexistence between the SU and the PU may occur if only the \ninterference caused\
    \ by the SU at the PU receiver remains \nunder a predefined threshold, known as\
    \ the “interference \ntemperature” [13,14]. To meet the interference threshold\
    \ \nrequirement, SU can use some techniques such as spreading \nits signal over\
    \ a wide bandwidth below the noise floor of the \nPU or using multiple antennas\
    \ to direct its signals away from \nthe PU receiver [15]. \nMoreover, in the case\
    \ of the underlay approach, the \nspectrum sensing process is not required and\
    \ the SUs can \ntransmit the data over the spectrum even if it is occupied all\
    \ the \ntime by the PUs. Therefore, this paradigm is more appropriate \nto use\
    \ in situations when the spectrum usage status of PUs \nchanges rapidly [12].\
    \ \nNevertheless, meeting the interference constraint forces the \nSU to limit\
    \ its transmission power and consequently to operate \nover a small coverage.\
    \ \n2) Spectrum interweave: As regards the interweave \ntransmission mode, it\
    \ stands for the opportunistic usage of the \navailable spectrum holes which was\
    \ the major motivation \nbehind the introduction of the Cognitive Radio technology\
    \ \n[16]. This paradigm mandates that SUs should have only \naccess to the unoccupied\
    \ spectrum resources. Thus, spectrum \nsensing is needed to identify the vacant\
    \ spectrum bands that \nare not currently occupied by the PUs. \nFurthermore,\
    \ in this case, harmful interferences to PUs are \navoided due to the fact that\
    \ SUs do not transmit concurrently \nwith the PUs. Whereas, the constant tracking\
    \ of spectrum \nopportunities is a challenging task, especially in rapidly \n\
    changing environments in terms of spectrum occupancy. \nHence, this approach is\
    \ more adequate for slowly changing \nenvironments [12,17]. \nConcerning power\
    \ resources, they are only limited by the \nrange of the identified spectrum holes.\
    \ \nIt is also worth noting that this class of dynamic spectrum \naccess is also\
    \ referred to as opportunistic spectrum access [18]. \n3) Spectrum \noverlay:\
    \ \nIn \nrespect \nto \nthe \noverlay \ntransmission mode, it is like the underlay\
    \ approach in that \nboth approaches allow SUs to simultaneously transmit with\
    \ \nPUs. However, in the overlay mode, SUs can transmit at any \npower without\
    \ a predefined interference threshold constraint. \nMoreover, in this paradigm,\
    \ the performance of the PU \nshouldn't be negatively affected by the presence\
    \ of the SU. To \nmeet this requirement, SUs use a variety of techniques that\
    \ \nrequire prior knowledge about PUs' codebooks and messages \n[19]. For instance,\
    \ SUs can divide their power into two parts: \none is assigned to transmit their\
    \ packets and the other is \nallocated to support the PUs’ transmissions. In that\
    \ way, the \ninterference caused by the SU at the PU receiver can be \ncompensated\
    \ by the enhancement of the PU’s signal-to-noise \npower ratio (SNR), by dint\
    \ of the part of SU’s power that is \nused to relay the PU packets. \nAdditionally,\
    \ SUs can exploit knowledge about PUs' \ncodebooks and messages to cancel the\
    \ interference caused by \nPUs, using techniques such as dirty paper coding [19].\
    \ \nFinally, hybrid schemes that combine these transmission \nmodes can be conceived\
    \ to increase the overall throughput of \nthe wireless networks [20]. \nB. Cognitive\
    \ Radio Functions \nThe various tasks performed by a Cognitive Radio, \nincluding\
    \ detecting spectrum holes, selecting the best available \nchannel, determining\
    \ the transmission parameters, sharing \nspectrum with other users, and moving\
    \ to another frequency \nband when a licensed user appears are referred to as\
    \ the \ncognitive cycle (See Fig. 3) [21]. \nIn general, the cognitive cycle can\
    \ be divided into three \nfunctional steps, namely spectrum sensing and analysis,\
    \ \nspectrum management and handoff, and spectrum allocation \nand sharing [21]:\
    \ \n• Spectrum sensing and analysis: in this phase, CR \nmonitors the radio environment,\
    \ detects the spectrum \nholes, and estimates its different characteristics. \n\
    • Spectrum management and handoff: at this stage, CR \nchooses the best spectrum\
    \ white space, determines the \ntransmission parameters, and hops among different\
    \ \nbands based on the channel characteristics and user \nrequirements [3,21].\
    \ \n• Spectrum allocation and sharing: through these \nfunctions, CR can share\
    \ and coordinate the spectrum \naccess with other users. The coexistence with\
    \ licensed \nusers is restricted by their allowable interference level. \nThus,\
    \ secondary users should adjust their transmission \nparameters accordingly. As\
    \ for sharing spectrum access \nwith CR users, efficient spectrum access coordination\
    \ is \nrequired so as to avoid collisions and interferences [21]. \n102 | P a\
    \ g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer\
    \ Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \n \nFig. 3. Cognitive Cycle\
    \ [21]. \nWith respect to the layer they are in, the aforesaid functions \ncan\
    \ be classified into three groups namely physical layer \n(PHY) functions, the\
    \ medium access control layer (MAC) \nfunctions, and network layer functions as\
    \ shown in Fig. 4 [22]: \n \nFig. 4. Key Functions of the PHY, MAC, and Network\
    \ Layers in a CR [22]. \n1) Physical layer functions: CR PHY layer is responsible\
    \ \nfor many tasks, including, but not limited to, identifying \nspectrum holes\
    \ through spectrum sensing and acquiring \nadvanced radio environment knowledge,\
    \ such as the channel \ngain from the CR transmitter to the primary receiver and\
    \ \nchannel-state information (CSI), via environmental learning \n[22]. Based\
    \ on the gathered information, cognitive spectrum \naccess is performed by using\
    \ transceiver optimization and \nreconfiguration. \n2) Medium access control layer\
    \ functions: CR MAC layer \nincorporates two key functions that allow to control\
    \ and \nmanage spectrum sensing operations as well as access to the \nidentified\
    \ spectrum opportunities. The first function is known \nas sensing scheduling,\
    \ whereas the second is referred to as \nspectrum-aware access control. The operations\
    \ of these \nfunctions are controlled by the sensing-access coordinator, on \n\
    a time basis, by taking into consideration the compromise \nbetween the sensing\
    \ requirement and the availability of the \nspectrum access opportunity. \nIn\
    \ \ncomparison \nwith \nthe \nconventional \nwireless \ncommunications MAC layer,\
    \ the CR MAC layer is more \ncomplicated to implement because of the dynamic nature\
    \ of the \nradio environment and the constant adaptation process that the \nCR\
    \ should perform. More detailed information about the CR \nMAC layer can be found\
    \ in [23,24]. \n3) Network layer functions: CR network layer provides \nthree\
    \ main functions: network tomography, quality of service \n(QoS) and error control,\
    \ and spectrum-aware routing [22]. \nNetwork tomography refers to the operation\
    \ by which the \nCR nodes sense the traffic patterns of the primary and the \n\
    coexisting networks. The output of this operation provides \nimportant baseline\
    \ data that allows a better understanding of \nthe routing design and the network\
    \ utilization at the packet \nlevel. \nQuality of service (QoS) control and error\
    \ control are of \nparamount importance to build a successful CR network. \nStatistical\
    \ control can be used to address these tasks over \nCRNs that are characterized\
    \ by opportunistic links. \nFurthermore, In CR networks, data routing is a challenging\
    \ \nproblem due to varying link quality, frequent topology \nchanges, and sporadic\
    \ connectivity caused by the movement of \nPUs in the network [25]. In such a\
    \ changing environment, the \nspectrum-aware routing function should be enabled\
    \ in order to \nfind optimal routes and paths while avoiding PUs. This \nfunction\
    \ has two problems to handle [21]: the first problem \nrelates to the fact that\
    \ routing algorithms and protocols should \nbe aware of the various network characteristics\
    \ such as \nspectrum availability, PU activity, channel switching delay, \nand\
    \ link qualities and take them into consideration while \nexecuting their different\
    \ operations. The second problem deals \nwith the setting up of interaction between\
    \ routing algorithms \nand dynamic spectrum allocation routines so as to select\
    \ \nrouting paths with minimum interferences. \nMoreover, the optimization of\
    \ the energy consumption, the \ndesired QoS, and the spectrum management should\
    \ be \nconsidered while designing routing algorithms and protocols \nfor CR networks.\
    \ Routing protocols are further detailed in [26]. \nFinally, the spectrum manager\
    \ serves as the means of \nestablishing a connection between the three aforementioned\
    \ \nlayers and ensuring dynamic and efficient access to the \navailable spectrum.\
    \ \nC. Cognitive Radio Networks \nA Cognitive Radio Network (CRN) consists of\
    \ a number of \nCR nodes with or without a secondary base station. \nBased on\
    \ the presence of infrastructure support, CRNs can \nbe classified as either an\
    \ Infrastructure-based network \n(centralized) or an Ad-Hoc network (distributed).\
    \ Moreover, \nCRNs can be also deployed in another architecture known as \nMesh\
    \ architecture that combines Infrastructure-based and Ad-\nHoc modes. A brief\
    \ description of these architectures is given \nbelow. \n1) Infrastructure-based\
    \ CR network: It is a centralized \narchitecture which contains a CR base station\
    \ that is \nresponsible for controlling and coordinating the transmission \nactivities\
    \ of the CR nodes. In this architecture, the CR base \nstation retrieves the spectrum\
    \ related information from all the \nSUs in the network and on the basis of the\
    \ gathered \ninformation, it makes decisions on spectrum access and \nsharing\
    \ for all CR nodes. \n103 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA) International\
    \ Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021\
    \ \nCompared to Ad-hoc network, infrastructure-based network \nprovides many advantages\
    \ including, the reliability of the \nsensing process, collision avoidance, and\
    \ a high data right for \nSUs. However, an infrastructure is required to build\
    \ such a \nnetwork. \nSome examples of centralized networks include: \n• The IEEE\
    \ 802.22 network: it is the first wireless \nregional \narea \nnetwork \nstandard\
    \ \nthat \ndefines \nspecifications for broadband wireless access using CR \n\
    technology in TVWS bands [27]; \n• Spectrum Efficient Uni and Multi-cast Services\
    \ Over \nDynamic Radio Network in Vehicular Environments \n(Over DRiVE) [28];\
    \ \n• European Dynamic Radio for IP services in Vehicular \nEnvironment (DRiVE)\
    \ [29]; \n• Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) [30]. \n2) Ad-hoc mode CR network: In Ad-hoc CRNs,\
    \ there is no \nneed for base stations or access points to coordinate the SUs.\
    \ \nThus, in the absence of a central controlling entity, SUs in \nsuch a distributed\
    \ network, make independent decisions \nconcerning spectrum access and transmission\
    \ parameters. \nAdditionally, SUs must use distributed DSA protocols so as to\
    \ \nmanage the spectrum access operation. Designing distributed \nDSA protocols\
    \ for Ad-hoc CRNs is a challenging task because \nof the absence of central control\
    \ entities and the completely \ndistributed networking architecture [12]. These\
    \ protocols \nshould support a set of functions including, transparency for \n\
    PUs, collision avoidance, accurate spectrum sensing, and \nefficient dynamic spectrum\
    \ allocation [12]. \nIII. SOFTWARE DEFINED RADIO: OVERVIEW \nGiven that SDR is\
    \ considered as an enabling technology \nthat handles the implementation of Cognitive\
    \ Radio, this \nsection will be dedicated to a brief overview of SDR. \nA. Definition\
    \ of SDR \nSoftware Defined Radio [31,32] is referred to as a \nprogrammable radio\
    \ transceiver where digital signal processing \nfunctions, such as modulation/demodulation,\
    \ coding/decoding, \nerror \ncontrol, \ninterleaving/deinterleaving, \nand \n\
    scrambling/descrambling are implemented by means of \nsoftware instead of hardware\
    \ as it has been used in traditional \nradio \ncommunication \nsystems. \nThat\
    \ \nenables \nthe \nimplementation of different waveform standards in a single\
    \ \nplatform and switching between them without any change in \nthe hardware components.\
    \ In some cases, there is just the need \nof a simple software upgrade to support\
    \ other modes, bands, \nand functions. \nMany hardware platforms are used to implement\
    \ the \nsoftware part of SDR, mainly, General Purpose Processor \n(GPP), Digital\
    \ Signal Processor (DSP), Field Programmable \nGate Arrays (FPGA), and Application\
    \ Specific Integrated \nCircuit (ASIC) [33]. \nEach of the above-mentioned platforms\
    \ has its own \nchallenges, limitations, and strengths in terms of computational\
    \ \npower, power consumption, implementation cost, flexibility \nand reconfigurability,\
    \ and complexity of design (See Table I). \nB. SDR Architecture \nJoseph Mitola\
    \ proposed the architecture of an ideal \nsoftware radio transceiver that includes\
    \ three components, \nnamely an antenna, a Digital-to-Analog/Analog-to-Digital\
    \ \nconverter, and a processing unit as illustrated in Fig. 5. The \nprocessing\
    \ unit allows performing, in software, all the digital \nsignal \nprocessing \n\
    functions, \nincluding \nmodulation/demodulation, coding/decoding, and error control\
    \ \n[3]. \n \nFig. 5. Ideal Software Radio [16]. \nMany factors impede the real\
    \ implementation of this \nproposed architecture such as the technology limitations,\
    \ more \nparticularly those related to ADC’s performance, computing \npower, and\
    \ power consumption of the processing unit. \nUnlike the ideal software radio\
    \ transceiver, the SDR \ntransceiver is feasible. Indeed, the general architecture\
    \ of SDRs \ncontains more components that make its real implementation \npossible.\
    \ \nAs shown in Fig. 6, the SDR transceiver includes mainly \nfour parts which\
    \ are an antenna, an analog RF front end, a \ndigital RF front end, and the signal\
    \ processing unit. \n1) Antenna: One of the main tasks expected from an SDR \n\
    platform is its ability to cover multiple frequency bands. Thus, \nSDR platforms\
    \ often use Intelligent/Smart antennas so as to \nfulfill the aforementioned task.\
    \ \nA smart antenna consists of an antenna array combined \nwith signal processing\
    \ blocks that allow to smartly exploit the \nspatial diversity in order to select\
    \ the appropriate frequency \nband and adapt with interference nulling, and mobile\
    \ tracking \n[34,35]. \nAn antenna for SDR should ideally integrate some features\
    \ \nsuch as self-adaptation, self-alignment and self-healing [35]. \nThese characteristics\
    \ can be defined as follows: \n• Self-adaptation: it is the capability of an antenna\
    \ to \nadapt its parameters according to the selected band and \nthe system requirements\
    \ (gain…); \n• Self-alignment: it is the capability of an antenna to \ncontrol\
    \ its radiation pattern; \n• Self-healing: it is the capability of an antenna\
    \ to avoid \ninterferences. \n104 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA)\

    \ 12, No. 6, 2021 \n2) Analog RF front end: The RF front end part [34] \nrepresents\
    \ an analog circuitry where the following operations \nare performed: \nIn the\
    \ transmission path, Digital-to-Analogue Converter \n(DAC) converts digital samples\
    \ into an analog signal which \nrepresents the input of the RF Front End. After\
    \ that, the analog \nsignal is mixed with high frequency carriers, modulated to\
    \ a \npreset RF frequency, and then transmitted. \nIn the receiving path, the\
    \ RF signal captured by the antenna \nis fed to the RF Front end section through\
    \ a matching circuitry \nwhich allows achieving an optimum signal power transfer.\
    \ \nThen, in order to amplify very low-power signals while \nguaranteeing a minimum\
    \ noise level, the RF signal passes \nthrough a Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) which\
    \ is often mounted \nvery close to the antenna. Afterward, the output of the LNA\
    \ is \nmixed with a signal from the Local Oscillator (LO) so as to \nshift to\
    \ a lower fixed frequency known as intermediate \nfrequency (IF). \nThe frequency\
    \ generated by the Local Oscillator is \nadjustable to ensure that the mixer produces\
    \ a lower fixed \nintermediate frequency independent of the incoming RF signal.\
    \ \nThe intermediate frequency presents several advantages: it \nimproves the\
    \ selectivity due to the fact of being fixed and it \nincreases the performance\
    \ of the processing unit and the global \ngain of the receiver owing to be lower\
    \ than the incoming \nfrequency. \n3) Digital front end: The Digital Front end\
    \ section [34] \ncontains a set of blocks that are responsible for performing\
    \ all \nof the succeeding functions: \nIn the transmission path, the digital baseband\
    \ signal (near-\nzero frequency range) is shifted into the IF frequency by the\
    \ \nDigital Up Converter (DUC) then it passes through the Digital \nAnalog Converter\
    \ (DAC) that converts it to the analog IF \nsignal. The analog IF signal is later\
    \ up-converted to RF signal. \nIn the receiving path, the analog IF signal is\
    \ converted to \ndigital IF samples by the Analog to Digital Converter (ADC).\
    \ \nNext, the Digital Down Converter (DDC) changes the IF \nsamples to a baseband\
    \ signal which is then resampled and \nfiltered before being processed by the\
    \ signal processing unit. \nThese above-mentioned tasks can be divided into two\
    \ \nprincipal functions which are Resampling and Channelization. \nResampling\
    \ or Sample Rate Conversion (SRC) is the process \nof converting samples from\
    \ one sample rate to another. As for \nChannelization, it involves up/down conversion\
    \ and channel \nfiltering. \n4) Signal processing unit: This block is regarded\
    \ as the \nmain part of SDR architecture which is designed to perform \nDigital\
    \ \nSignal \nProcessing \nfunctions \nsuch \nas \nmodulation/demodulation and\
    \ encoding/decoding. \nAs already mentioned in this paper many hardware \nplatforms\
    \ are used to implement this section, namely DSP, \nGPP, GPU, ASIC, and FPGA [36–39].\
    \ The real challenge is \ndetermining which of these platforms is best to achieve\
    \ SDR \ngoals and which design approach is appropriate to meet the \nrequested\
    \ quality of service. \nTable I shows the strengths and weaknesses of some \n\
    hardware platforms and highlights certain techniques used to \nimprove their performance.\

    \ researchers \nhave proposed the co-design (hybrid) approach as a solution. \n\
    This approach consists of regrouping design schemes that \nemploy hardware techniques,\
    \ such as FPGAs and ASICs, and \nthose that use software solutions including GPPs,\
    \ into one \nplatform. \nThis approach presents some issues, the most known are\
    \ \nthe problem related to the shared access of the internal memory \nby different\
    \ units (FPGAs, Processors ...) and the very \nexpensive cost of the whole implementation.\
    \ \nOne of the interesting readings that give a detailed review \nof the aforementioned\
    \ platforms, can be found in [35]. \nC. SDR Advantages \nSoftware Defined Radio\
    \ technology has brought a lot of \nadvantages to the world of wireless communications,\
    \ such as \nreconfigurability and flexibility, interoperability, and cost \nreduction\
    \ [34,37]: \n• Reconfigurability and Flexibility: The main feature of \nSDR is\
    \ its capacity to handle wireless standards newly \ndeveloped by simply changing\
    \ or upgrading the \nreconfigurable software instead of replacing the \nhardware\
    \ platform or its analog components. \n• Interoperability: One of the most important\
    \ benefits of \nSDR is its ability to resolve interoperability problems \nbetween\
    \ incompatible radios that work with different \nwireless standards. \n• Cost\
    \ \nreduction: \nSeveral \nexpensive \nhardware \ncomponents disappeared due to\
    \ the fact that in SDR \nmany \ndigital \nsignal \nprocessing \nfunctions \nare\
    \ \nimplemented by means of software. \nIn addition to the forenamed benefits,\
    \ SDR allows to test \nand study several communication standards by using the\
    \ same \nplatform. Furthermore, SDR is regarded as the block building \nof a Cognitive\
    \ Radio system and as already mentioned in this \npaper, SDR enables the reconfigurability\
    \ of Cognitive Radio. \nD. SDR Tools \nThere are different commercial and open-source\
    \ tools that \ncan be used for SDR development. Choosing the more \nappropriate\
    \ \ndevelopment \ntool \nfor \na \nspecific \ndesign \nmethodology requires prior\
    \ knowledge of the available tools’ \nfeatures. Examples of these tools include\
    \ GNU Radio, \nUniversal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP), MATLAB, \nLabVIEW,\
    \ and CUDA. \nGNU Radio and USRP are the most widely used tools to \ndevelop SDR\
    \ systems [40]. A brief description of these two \ntools is given below: \nGNU\
    \ Radio: GNU Radio is a free & open-source software \ntoolkit for building software\
    \ radios [35]. It runs on host \n106 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA)\
    \ International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol.\
    \ 12, No. 6, 2021 \ncomputers and it provides many signal processing blocks such\
    \ \nas filters, decoders, and demodulators which are required to \nimplement software\
    \ radios. These blocks are programmed in \nC++ and they are often connected using\
    \ Python script that has \nthe advantage of allowing the data flow to be at the\
    \ maximum \nrate, without being interpreted [41]. In addition, this tool offers\
    \ \nthe possibility of easily programming and adding new blocks \nfor supporting\
    \ unavailable functions. GNU Radio can be used \njointly with Universal Software\
    \ Radio Peripheral systems or \nother alternatives to set up complete SDR platforms.\
    \ \nUSRP: Universal Software Radio Peripheral is the most \ncommonly used transceiver\
    \ for SDR platforms, developed by \nEttus2 Research under GPL license. USRPs are\
    \ available in \nseveral series and versions, differentiated by their hardware\
    \ \nperformances and their connection method to a host computer. \nGenerally,\
    \ USRP is a board that integrates the following \ncomponents: ADC/ DAC, an FPGA\
    \ board, an RF front end, \nand a PC host interface [42]. Based on the USRP series,\
    \ a \ncertain number of daughterboards can also be held. \nDaughterboards perform\
    \ functions such as filtering and \nconversion between RF and baseband signals\
    \ (up/down \nconversions) and may support applications operating up to 6 \nGHz\
    \ due to being modular. Concerning the other signal \nprocessing functions, the\
    \ majority of them are performed at the \nhost machine and only some operations\
    \ are processed by the \nFPGA board [42]. USRP platforms offer several advantages,\
    \ \nincluding ease-of-use, affordability, and flexibility. However, \nbandwidth\
    \ limitations of USRP components have an impact on \nsystem throughput. That makes\
    \ USRP platforms only suitable \nfor research experiments and rapid prototyping\
    \ [35,42]. \nE. SDR Challenges \nIn this subsection, the challenges that still\
    \ remain to be \naddressed for implementing efficient and practical SDR \nsystems\
    \ are presented. \n1) Security and attack issues: Although SDR has brought \n\
    many powerful advantages to the field of wireless \ncommunication, it has introduced\
    \ new types of security threats \nand attack issues. Indeed, in addition to the\
    \ known threats that \nexist in conventional wireless communication systems such\
    \ as \ndenial of service attacks, misconfiguration issues, listening \nand capturing\
    \ data that can be used to perform malicious \nactions, there are several threats\
    \ that are specific to SDR, \nincluding downloading and running malicious software.\
    \ \nIn the absence of authentication and verification \ntechniques, unauthorized\
    \ software can easily be installed and \nactivated on SDR terminals. The challenge\
    \ of implementing \nprotection techniques and security mechanisms, to prevent\
    \ this \nissue, has been addressed by many researchers. For instance, in \n[43]\
    \ a framework for establishing secure download for SDR is \npresented. This framework\
    \ uses a public/private key scheme to \nverify the authenticity of the software.\
    \ The digital signature is \nconsidered as a good solution to keep malicious and\
    \ \nunauthorized software from being activated on SDR nodes, \nnevertheless, it\
    \ greatly increases the complexity of the \n2 https://www.ettus.com/ \nframework\
    \ due to the fact that for each combination of \nwaveform and terminal, a digital\
    \ signature should be created. \nFurthermore, the data configuration of SDR components\
    \ \ncan be prone to extraction, alteration, or destruction. Those \nissues can\
    \ be prevented by guaranteeing the integrity of the \nsecurity administrative\
    \ module (SAM) and implementing data \nintegrity and protection techniques [44].\
    \ \n2) Energy efficiency: Addressing the power consumption \nissue is of primary\
    \ importance especially when designing \nsolutions that are intended for battery-powered\
    \ devices and \nlow power objects in an IoT network. Several reasons are \nbehind\
    \ the importance of addressing power consumption \nmanagement, including limited\
    \ size and battery, ensuring a \nlonger lifetime of IoT objects, and enabling\
    \ Green Computing \n[17,45]. In SDR, many factors contribute to the loss of energy\
    \ \nefficiency, namely signal processing complexity and the \nincreased hardware\
    \ requirements. To alleviate this loss, the \nauthors of [46] proposed a cooperative\
    \ wireless network \nscheme that is based on resource sharing (Battery, processing\
    \ \nunit, memory…). \n3) Antenna requirements for SDR: One of the major \nchallenges\
    \ in SDR is to design wideband antennas that support \ndifferent technologies\
    \ and standards. Although smart and \nreconfigurable antennas are used to resolve\
    \ this concern, \nseveral constraints still hamper the SDR implementation in \n\
    portable handsets and other systems, such as bandwidth and \ngain limitations,\
    \ which are imposed by the antenna size, and \nthe complexity of a design that\
    \ meets all the antenna \nrequirements for SDR [47]. \n4) Hybrid design: Implementing\
    \ an optimal SDR design, \nthat meets the real-time requirements at low power\
    \ and cost \nwhile maintaining flexibility and programmability, represents \n\
    a great challenge. Researchers address this issue by using the \nhybrid approach\
    \ which enables the use of hardware schemes \n(ASICs…) along with software schemes\
    \ (GPP...) in the same \nplatform in order to take advantage of their different\
    \ benefits. \nThe hybrid design has also its own challenges in both \nphysical\
    \ and MAC layers, including partitioning and \nscheduling problems [35]. \n5)\
    \ ADC and DAC limitations: The concept of an ideal \nsoftware defined radio transceiver\
    \ consists in placing the \nADC/DAC as close as possible to the antenna. That\
    \ requires a \nvery high-speed ADC/DAC with sampling capability up to \nGiga Samples\
    \ per second which is actually not feasible. To \novercome this issue, an RF front\
    \ end block is placed right after \nthe antenna so as to shift the incoming frequency\
    \ to an \nintermediate frequency that can be supported by the currently \navailable\
    \ ADC/DAC. \nIV. SPECTRUM SENSING \nSensing is considered as the most important\
    \ and critical \nphase in the Cognitive Radio cycle. It refers to the operation\
    \ by \nwhich the CR users can be aware of the channel occupancy, the \npresence\
    \ of the primary user, the quality of the radio channel, \n107 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org\
    \ \n                                                           \n(IJACSA) International\
    \ Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021\
    \ \nand other parameters such as transmission power, bandwidth, \nmodulation,\
    \ etc. Based on this gathered information, the CR \nusers can determine the vacant\
    \ portion of the spectrum and \nchoose the white spaces which meet its QoS. \n\
    This section gives a detailed view of sensing spectrum \nfunction in Cognitive\
    \ Radio Networks. \nA. Multi-dimensional Spectrum Sensing \nThrough the sensing\
    \ function, Cognitive radio can identify \nthe existing spectrum opportunities\
    \ in its surrounding \nenvironment by using different sensing techniques. Spectrum\
    \ \nopportunity is conventionally defined as “a band of frequencies \nthat are\
    \ not being used by the primary user of that band at a \nparticular time in a\
    \ particular geographic area” [48,49]. This \ndefinition takes into consideration\
    \ only three dimensions, \nnamely frequency, time, and space. However, there are\
    \ other \ndimensions that can be exploited to create new opportunities \nsuch\
    \ as code dimension and angle dimension. Developing \nsensing algorithms that\
    \ take into account all those dimensions \nencounters more complex and challenging\
    \ issues. \nA radio environment in which all the aforementioned \ndimensions are\
    \ exploited to share spectrum access among \nmultiple users is known by several\
    \ names including, \nhyperspace, electro space, and radio spectrum space. Table\
    \ II \nshows parameters that are needed to be sensed for each \ndimension and\
    \ highlights its main idea [49]. \nB. Types of Spectrum Sensing \nSpectrum sensing\
    \ approaches can be divided into several \ntypes on the basis of specific aspects,\
    \ including the cooperation \nbetween secondary users, the bands of interest,\
    \ the sensing \nexecution time, and the number of sensed channels at a time \n\
    (See Fig. 7) [50]: \nBased on the bands of interest for the Cognitive Radio \n\
    system, spectrum sensing falls into two groups: in-band \nsensing and out-of-band\
    \ sensing. In-band sensing consists in \nsensing the channel that is already transmitting,\
    \ in the aim of \ndetecting primary user signals and avoiding harmful \ninterferences\
    \ [51,52]. As to out-of-band sensing, CR senses \nbands other than the band on\
    \ which it is transmitting so as to \ndiscover new spectrum holes [51]. \nBased\
    \ on the sensing execution time, two classes of \nspectrum sensing can be distinguished:\
    \ reactive (on-demand) \nand proactive(periodic) sensing. The reactive sensing\
    \ takes \nplace when the secondary user intends to transmit or as a result \n\
    of radio environmental changes. In proactive sensing, CR users \nsense the radio\
    \ environment persistently so as to detect \nspectrum opportunities. Reactive\
    \ sensing is more energy \nefficient but the time to identify an unoccupied channel\
    \ may be \nlonger than proactive sensing. \nAmong the types of spectrum sensing,\
    \ we also find \nsynchronous \nsensing \nand \nasynchronous \nsensing. \nIn \n\
    synchronous sensing, all CRs respect the same schedule to \nsense a frequency\
    \ band. In that case, a high synchronization \nbetween CRs represents a challenging\
    \ task. \nTABLE II. \nMULTI-DIMENSIONAL SPECTRUM SENSING \nDimension \nParameters\
    \ to sense \nIdea and remarks \nFrequency \nAvailable frequency bands \nThe available\
    \ frequency band is segmented into disjoint sub-\nbands. Identifying opportunities\
    \ in the frequency domain consists \nin determining the unoccupied sub-bands.\
    \ It is unlikely that all the \nbands can be used concurrently at the same time.\
    \  \nTime \nAvailable time slots in a specific band \nFor a given frequency band,\
    \ there will be times when it is \nunoccupied and available for opportunistic\
    \ usage.  \nGeographic Space \nPU’s location (latitude, longitude, an elevation)\
    \ \nDistance of primary users \nAt a specific time, certain channels may be available\
    \ for \nopportunistic usage in some geographical zones while being \nentirely\
    \ occupied in other zones. The path loss in space enables \nsecondary users to\
    \ identify the presence or the absence of a \nprimary user in a given local area\
    \ by just looking at the \ninterference level. If there is no interference, then\
    \ the primary \nuser is absent otherwise it is present. However, the risk of creating\
    \ \nharmful interferences to a hidden primary user is possible. This \nissue is\
    \ discussed later in this article. \nAngle \nPU’s beam directions (azimuth and\

    \ (e.g., Beamforming \ntechnology), identifying PU’s location, and determining\
    \ PU’s \nbeam directions, new spectrum holes in the angle domain might \nbe available\
    \ for opportunistic usage. Indeed, the secondary user \ncan transmit in the same\
    \ frequency band along with the primary \nuser at the same time in the same location\
    \ by choosing a different \ndirection without causing interferences to the licensed\

    \ \nsynchronize its transmission with PU. \nBy being aware of code sequences that\
    \ primary users are using at \na given time, secondary users can transmit simultaneously\
    \ along \nwith primary users over the available spectrum by choosing \ndifferent\
    \ code sequences in such a way as to avoid creating \ninterferences on primary\
    \ users. It is important to note that \nsimultaneous transmission is possible\
    \ by using orthogonal codes. \n108 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA)\
    \ International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol.\
    \ 12, No. 6, 2021 \nIn the case of asynchronous sensing, each CR has its own \n\
    schedule to sense a frequency band. Distinguishing between \nSU signals and PU\
    \ signals is a challenging problem. \nIn respect to the cooperation aspect, there\
    \ are two classes of \nspectrum sensing: cooperative and non-cooperative (local)\
    \ \nSensing. In non-cooperative sensing, each CR settles for its \nown sensing\
    \ data and independently decides on the channel \nstate, i.e. the presence or\
    \ the absence of the primary user. \nDecisions that are made through this sensing\
    \ type are \nunreliable and error prone under bad channel conditions, \nmultipath\
    \ fading and shadowing effects, and hidden node \nissues [53]. \nThe aforementioned\
    \ issues can be avoided by using \ncooperative sensing [21,53]. Indeed, when cooperative\
    \ sensing \nis enabled, CR users share their local observations and sensing \n\
    data with others and exploit the shared sensing outcomes of \nother users to decide\
    \ on the presence or absence of the primary \nuser. Several works have been carried\
    \ out on this topic and it \nhas been shown that cooperative sensing contributes\
    \ to the \nimprovement of detection accuracy and reliability on the cost \nof\
    \ increased latency and traffic overhead. It has also been \nproven that cooperation\
    \ between secondary users can solve \nhidden primary user problem and decrease\
    \ sensing time [53]. \nThere are two types of cooperative sensing: centralized\
    \ \nsensing and distributed sensing [3,54]. In centralized sensing \n[55], a central\
    \ unit gathers local sensing information from CR \nusers through a control channel,\
    \ fuses them by means of one of \nthe fusion decision rules [56], identifies spectrum\
    \ holes by \nperforming binary hypothesis testing algorithm such as \nNeyman-Pearson\
    \ test or Bayesian test, and shares the result \namong other cognitive users or\
    \ directly controls the cognitive \nradio traffic. In distributed sensing [54],\
    \ cognitive nodes \nexchange their local observations among each other and make\
    \ \ntheir own decisions on channel state. Distributed sensing \ndoesn’t require\
    \ a backbone infrastructure or a centralized base \nstation. \nOn the basis of\
    \ interference detection, spectrum sensing is \ncategorized as primary transmitter\
    \ detection, primary receiver \ndetection, and interference temperature [51].\
    \ In primary \ntransmitter detection approaches, spectrum holes are identified\
    \ \nby processing received signals at the PU receiver. This class \nincludes several\
    \ techniques such as energy detection and \nmatched filter detection. In primary\
    \ receiver detection, the \nstatus of primary channels is detected based on the\
    \ local \noscillator leakage power of the PU receiver [57]. This power is \nemitted\
    \ by the PU receiver’s RF front end while receiving the \ndata from the PU transmitter\
    \ [58]. As for interference \ntemperature, secondary users transmit simultaneously\
    \ with \nprimary users as long as the interference caused by the SU at \nthe PU\
    \ receiver remains under a specified interference limit. In \nthis case, the underlay\
    \ DSA model is considered. \nIn regard to the requirement of the PU’s information,\
    \ \nspectrum sensing schemes can be categorized into two classes: \nblind and\
    \ feature detection techniques [50]. The blind detection \ntechniques serve to\
    \ blindly determine the channel state without \nany prior knowledge about the\
    \ primary user signals. This type \nincludes, among others, energy detection and\
    \ Higher-Order-\nStatistics detection. The feature detection techniques allow\
    \ \nperforming signal classification to the detected signal. They are \nmore advantageous\
    \ than blind detection techniques in the sense \nthat it is possible to distinguish\
    \ between PU and SU signals and \nto characterize the different types of PU and\
    \ SU signals. \nMatched filter and cyclostationarity detection techniques are\
    \ \nexamples of feature detection techniques. \nDepending on the bandwidth (number\
    \ of sensed channels at \na time), spectrum sensing schemes are classified into\
    \ two broad \ngroups which are narrowband and wideband sensing \ntechniques [59]:\
    \ in the narrowband sensing, only one channel \nis analyzed at a time to detect\
    \ available opportunities. The most \nwidely and commonly known narrowband methods\
    \ are energy \ndetection, matched filter detection, cyclostationary feature \n\
    detection, covariance-based detection, and waveform detection \n[59]. \nAs for\
    \ wideband sensing, multiple frequency bands are \nexplored at a time so as to\
    \ discover spectrum holes. In this \ncase, the available spectrum is usually divided\
    \ into narrower \nsub-bands which are sensed either concurrently or sequentially\
    \ \nby using narrowband sensing techniques. Wideband sensing \ntechniques contain\
    \ two groups: Nyquist-based and Sub-\nNyquist wideband sensing. The former type\
    \ processes digital \nsignals at the rate equal to or greater than the Nyquist\
    \ rate, \nwhereas the latter type processes the signals with a sampling \nrate\
    \ lower than the Nyquist rate [59]. \nWideband sensing allows to exploit the available\
    \ spectrum \nmore efficiently but it brings about new challenges related to \n\
    its implementation. \nOn the basis of the latest mentioned classification of \n\
    spectrum sensing schemes (Narrowband sensing/ Wideband \nsensing), the next subsection\
    \ will review some of the most \ncommon spectrum sensing methods as well as the\
    \ recent \nadvanced spectrum sensing techniques. \n \nFig. 7. Types of Spectrum\
    \ Sensing. \n109 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA) International Journal\
    \ of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \nC. Spectrum\
    \ Sensing Techniques \nBefore reviewing in detail spectrum sensing techniques,\
    \ \nmore particularly narrowband sensing techniques, the system \nmodel for spectrum\
    \ sensing is given below. \n1) System Model for spectrum sensing: The fundamental\
    \ \nobjective of spectrum sensing is to make a choice between two \nhypotheses:\
    \ \n• H0: Channel is temporarily available for opportunistic \nusage i.e. no primary\
    \ user signal is present; \n• H1: Channel is occupied i.e. a primary user signal\
    \ is \npresent. \nThese hypotheses can be expressed as under: \nH0: Y(n)= N(n)\
    \ when PU’s signal is absent  \n         (1) \nH1: Y(n)= h.X(n)+ N(n) when PU’s\
    \ signal is present          (2) \nWhere Y(n) represents the received signal by\
    \ SU, X(n) \nrepresents the transmitted PU signal, N(n) denotes Additive \nWhite\
    \ Gaussian Noise (AWGN) with mean zero and variance \n\U0001D70E\U0001D70E2.h\
    \ represents the channel gain, n= 1,2,3…N where n is the \nsample index, and N\
    \ is the number of samples. \nGenerally, a test statistic of Y(n) is compared\
    \ against a \ndecision threshold value \U0001D706\U0001D706 in order to decide\
    \ between the two \nhypotheses. If the test statistic is greater than the threshold,\
    \ H1 \nis assumed to be true and thus PU’s signal is declared present. \nin contrast,\
    \ if the test statistic is less than the threshold, H0 is \nassumed to be true\
    \ and then PU’s signal is declared absent. Fig. \n8 presents the general model\
    \ of spectrum detection. \n \nFig. 8. Spectrum Sensing Model. \nSensing accuracy\
    \ is typically evaluated using the Receiver \nOperating Characteristic (ROC) curves.\
    \ These curves are the \nplot of the detection probability versus the false alarm\
    \ \nprobability or plot of the probability of miss detection against \nthe probability\
    \ of false alarm [60,61]. These probabilities are \ndefined as: \nProbability\
    \ of detection (Pd): It is the probability that the \nSU declares the presence\
    \ of PU signal when it is actually \npresent. \nPd = Pr(H1/H1)   \n \n \n \n \
    \        (3) \nA \nhigh \nProbability \nof \ndetection \nallows \navoiding \n\
    interference impact on primary receivers. Hence a high Pd is \neminently desirable.\
    \ \nProbability of false alarm (Pfa): It is the probability that the \nSU declares\
    \ the presence of PU signal when it doesn’t truly \nexist. \nPfa= Pr(H1/H0)  \
    \ \n \n \n \n         (4) \nA high Probability of false alarm decreases the efficiency\
    \ \nspectral due to the loss of spectrum access opportunities. In \naddition,\
    \ the QoS may be negatively affected as a result of this \nloss. Thus, Pfa should\
    \ be low to avoid the under-use of \npotential spectrum holes. \nProbability of\
    \ miss detection (Pm): It is the probability of \nmissing a PU signal when it\
    \ is present. \nPm= Pr(H0/H1)   \n \n \n \n         (5) \nA high Probability of\
    \ miss detection causes a harmful \ninterference on primary users because, in\
    \ the case of a miss \ndetection, SUs may transmit simultaneously with PUs in\
    \ the \nsame band. So, to avoid interference to and from license holder \nusers,\
    \ Pm should be low. \n2) Narrowband sensing techniques: In this subsection, we\
    \ \ndiscuss several narrowband sensing techniques, focusing on \ntheir \nfunctions,\
    \ \nmathematical \nmodels, \nstrengths, \nand \ndrawbacks. \na) Energy detection\
    \ scheme: Energy detection [1,62–64] \ncalled also Radiometry or Periodogram,\
    \ is the most widely \nused sensing scheme due to its low computational complexity,\
    \ \nthe simplicity of its implementation, and the absence of need \nfor PU signal\
    \ information. \nIn this sensing technique, the received signal energy is \ncomputed\
    \ and compared with a threshold value. If the \nmeasured energy is higher than\
    \ the threshold, the target \nfrequency band is considered to be occupied by a\
    \ PU; \notherwise, the target frequency band is considered to be vacant. \nThe\
    \ block diagram of the energy detection method is illustrated \nin Fig. 9 and\
    \ its decision metric can be written as: \nT= \n1\nN ∑\n(Y(n))\nN\nn=1\nⁿ  \n\
    \ \n \n \n         (6) \nDespite its aforementioned advantages, energy detection\
    \ \nhas several drawbacks, including the degradation of detection \naccuracy as\
    \ a result of noise uncertainty (NU). The latter refers \nto the noise power fluctuations\
    \ with time caused by the effects \nof various factors such as thermal noise,\
    \ filtering effects, radio-\nfrequency circuits, and interference from other signals\
    \ [65]. \nAuthors of [65] analyzed the impact of NU on energy detection \nperformance\
    \ using different OFDM system designs. The \nresults of their analyses show that,\
    \ for all OFDM system \ndesigns, the probability of detection is higher for signals,\
    \ with \nlower NU and higher SNR, which are transmitted at higher PU \ntransmit\
    \ power and detected with a higher number of samples. \nMoreover, energy detection\
    \ is unreliable at low SNR values \n[66], ineffective in detecting spread signals\
    \ [60], and unable to \ndistinguish between PU signals from other signals. \n\
    To enhance the performance and the accuracy of energy \ndetection, several methods\
    \ based on the use of dynamics \nthresholds are investigated in [67–70]. \n \n\

    \ \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,\
    \ \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \nb) Matched filter detection: The matched filter detection\
    \ \ntechnique is viewed as the best method for identifying the \nunutilized bands\
    \ when the PU transmission characteristics are \nknown a priori, e.g., bandwidth,\
    \ operating frequency, the \nmodulation type and order, packet format, and pulse\
    \ shaping \n[70–72]. In this technique, the received signal is correlated \nwith\
    \ the known PU signal and the result is compared with a \nthreshold to decide\
    \ on the presence of the PU. The block \ndiagram of matched filter detection is\
    \ shown in Fig. 10 and its \ntest statistic is given by: \nT=∑\nY(n)X∗(n)\nN\n\
    n=1\n23T \n \n \n \n         (7) \n \nFig. 10. Block Diagram of Matched Filter\
    \ Detection [70–73]. \nThe main advantage of this sensing scheme is that it \n\
    requires only a small number of samples and thus less sensing \ntime to achieve\
    \ good detection performance due to its \nresilience against noise uncertainty\
    \ [73]. Nevertheless, it has \nseveral drawbacks. First, there is a need for precise\
    \ and \naccurate prior information about the primary user signal, which \nmay\
    \ not always be available [65]. Second, the performance of \nthe matched filter\
    \ technique drops when the prior information \nis incorrect. Third, to detect\
    \ different types of PUs, a dedicated \nmatched filter structure for each type\
    \ must be used, which \nincreases the complexity of the system. \nc) Cyclostationary\
    \ Feature Detection: Cyclostationary \nFeature Detection [74–76] depends on cyclostationary\
    \ \ncharacteristics of the received signals. Indeed, in wireless \ncommunications,\
    \ the transmitted signals are typically \ncharacterized by the periodicity of\
    \ some of their statistics such \nas mean and autocorrelation[76,77].This periodicity\
    \ results \nfrom the fact that signals are modulated and coupled with \ncyclic\
    \ prefixes, hopping sequences, pulse trains, sinusoidal \nwave carrier, and other\
    \ features before being transmitted \n[76,77]. Furthermore, additive noise signals\
    \ are stationary \nwith no correlation. Therefore, Cyclostationary Feature \n\
    Detection schemes are very robust to noise uncertainties and \ncan distinguish\
    \ between the signal and noise by calculating \nand analyzing the cyclic autocorrelation\
    \ of the received \nsignals. \nThe periodicity of the mean and the autocorrelation,\
    \ of a \ncyclostationary signal y(t), can be expressed mathematically \nby: \n\
    my(t) = E[y(t)] = my(t + T0) \n \n \n         (8) \nRy(t, τ) = Ry(t + T0, τ) \n\
    \ \n \n \n         (9) \nWhere T0 represents the period of the signal \U0001D466\
    \U0001D466 (\U0001D461\U0001D461), \U0001D70F\U0001D70F \nrepresents the time\
    \ offset, \U0001D438\U0001D438 denotes the expectation operator, \nand \U0001D445\
    \U0001D445\U0001D466\U0001D466 is the autocorrelation function of \U0001D466\U0001D466\
    \ (\U0001D461\U0001D461) and it is given \nby: \nR\U0001D466\U0001D466 (\U0001D70F\
    \U0001D70F) = \U0001D438\U0001D438 [\U0001D466\U0001D466 (\U0001D461\U0001D461\
    \ + \U0001D70F\U0001D70F) \U0001D466\U0001D466∗(\U0001D461\U0001D461 − \U0001D70F\
    \U0001D70F)\U0001D452\U0001D452\U0001D457\U0001D4572\U0001D70B\U0001D70B\U0001D6FC\
    \U0001D6FC\U0001D461\U0001D461]  \n \n       (10) \nThe block diagram of Cyclostationary\
    \ Detection scheme is \nillustrated in Fig. 11, in which The Analog-to-Digital\
    \ \nConverter (ADC) digitizes the received analog signal y(t) into \ndigital samples\
    \ and then it is fed into the N-point FFT block \nwhich computes its Fast Fourier\
    \ Transform. Next, these FFT \nvalues are correlated with themselves and then\
    \ averaged over \nthe number of samples. Finally, in the feature detection block,\
    \ \nthe sensing decision is obtained by detecting the features of the \naverage\
    \ outcome. \nThis scheme has also the advantage of being able to \ndistinguish\
    \ between various types of PU signals that are \ncharacterized by different transmit\
    \ features [78]. \nHowever, this detector also presents some limitations such\
    \ \nas the need for a large number of samples and high sampling \nrate which results\
    \ in an increase in sensing time, power \nconsumption, and complexity [76,78].\
    \ \nIn order to reduce computation complexity while \nmaintaining sufficient detection\
    \ sensitivity, authors of [79] \nproposed an improved Cyclostationary Detector\
    \ with SLC \nDiversity over Nakagami-m Fading channels, where the test \nstatistic\
    \ of conventional Cyclostationary detector is reliably \nsimplified. For the same\
    \ purpose, in [80], an improved \nCyclostationary Feature Detection Algorithm\
    \ is presented, in \nwhich authors proved that the cyclic spectrum is conjugate\
    \ \nsymmetry about the relevant axis, which decreases the \ncomputational complexity.\
    \ \n \nFig. 11. Block Diagram of Cyclostationary Feature Detection [74–76]. \n\
    d) Covariance Based Detection: Covariance-based \ndetection methods exploit the\
    \ correlation structure inherent in \nthe received data and the noticeable differences\
    \ between the \nstatistical covariances of signal and noise to decide on the \n\
    presence of primary signals in background noise without the \nneed for prior knowledge\
    \ about signal, channel, or noise \npower [81]. \nDifferent statistical tests\
    \ can be extracted from the \ncovariance matrix of the received signal and used\
    \ to detect the \npresence of the signal like the ratio of the maximum eigenvalue\
    \ \nto minimum eigenvalue in the case of Eigenvalue-Based \nDetection Method [82].\
    \ The steps of the latter can be \nsummarized as follows: First, the sample covariance\
    \ matrix of \nthe received signal is built from the received signal samples. \n\
    Then, the eigenvalues of this matrix are computed using \ntechniques such as singular\
    \ value decomposition (SVD). \nFinally, a decision on the presence of the signal\
    \ is taken by \ncomparing the ratio between the maximum eigenvalue and the \n\
    minimum eigenvalue with a threshold. The block diagram of \nthis method is shown\
    \ in Fig. 12. \n \nFig. 12. Block Diagram of Covariance-Based Detection [82].\
    \ \n111 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA) International Journal of\
    \ Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \nThe sample\
    \ covariance matrix of the received signal can be \nexpressed as [82]: \nRy (Ns)=\n\
    1\nNₛ ∑\nL−2+Nₛ ŷ(n) ŷH(n) \nn=L−1\n \n \n \n       (11) \nWhere Ns is the number\
    \ of collected samples, L is a \npositive integer called “smoothing factor\",\
    \ ŷ(n) is the received \nsignal vector at sampling instance n, and ŷH(n) is its\
    \ conjugate-\ntranspose. \nThe test statistic can be written as: \nT= \nλ\U0001D45A\
    \U0001D456\U0001D45B\nλ\U0001D45A\U0001D44E\U0001D465  \n \n \n \n \n       (12)\
    \ \nWhere \U0001D706\U0001D706max and \U0001D706\U0001D706min are respectively\
    \ the maximum and \nminimum eigenvalues of Ry (Ns); \nUsing a predefined threshold\
    \ \U0001D706\U0001D706, the decision can be made as \nfollows: if T> \U0001D706\
    \U0001D706, H1 is considered to be true, otherwise, H0 is \nconsidered to be true.\
    \ \nIt is noteworthy that, despite the robustness of covariance \ntechniques against\
    \ noise uncertainty, they have a high \ncomputational complexity due to two factors,\
    \ namely \ncovariance matrix computation and eigenvalue decomposition \n[82].\
    \ \ne) Waveform-based \ndetection: \nWaveform-based \ndetection method, also known\
    \ as coherent detection [49], can \nbe considered as a simplified version of the\
    \ matched filter \nscheme. Although, unlike the latter, this method doesn’t need\
    \ \ncomplete information about the PU signals. It simply exploits \nknown patterns,\
    \ that are used in wireless communication \nsystems to support many functions\
    \ such as synchronization, \ncontrol, and equalization so as to execute coherent\
    \ detection. \nThese patterns involve but not limited to the following: \n• Preambles:\
    \ a preamble is a known sequence that is sent \nbefore each burst; \n• Midambles:\
    \ a midamble is a known sequence that is \nsent in the middle of a slot or burst;\
    \ \n• Pilot symbols: pilot symbols are an extra overhead \nadded to the transmitted\
    \ signal. \nWhen such patterns are available, the received signal is \ncorrelated\
    \ with a known copy of itself to perform signal \ndetection. As such, the test\
    \ statistic can be expressed as: \nT=R [∑\ny(n)x(n)∗\nN\nn=1\n] \n \n \n \n  \
    \     (13) \nwhere R[.] denotes the real part, y(n) is the received signal \n\
    by SU, x(n)* is the complex conjugate of the signal transmitted \nby PU, and n=\
    \ [1,2…. N] is the sample index. \nIn the absence of the primary user’s signal,\
    \ the given \nexpression can be written as follows: \nT=R [∑\nn(n)x(n)∗\nN\nn=1\n\
    ] \n \n \n \n       (14) \nWhereas in the presence of the primary user, the test\
    \ static \ncan be simplified as under: \nT= ∑\n(|x[n]|)2\n\U0001D441\n\U0001D45B\
    =1\n+R [∑\nn(n)x(n)∗\n\U0001D441\n\U0001D45B=1\n] \n \n       (15) \nWhere n(n)\
    \ denotes Additive White Gaussian Noise \n(AWGN) with mean zero and variance \U0001D70E\
    \U0001D70E2. \nThe value of the test statistic T is compared to a fixed \nthreshold\
    \ \U0001D706\U0001D706 in order to decide on the presence of a primary user \n\
    signal. H1 is considered to be true if T > \U0001D706\U0001D706, and H0 is \n\
    considered to be true otherwise. \nIt is noteworthy that the waveform-based sensing\
    \ scheme \ncan only be applied to wireless systems having known signal \npatterns,\
    \ such as Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11b) [83] and WIMAX [84]. \nIn [85], it is demonstrated\
    \ that compared to energy detector \ntechnique, this method is more reliable and\
    \ has less sensing \ntime. In addition, it is demonstrated that the accuracy of\
    \ this \nsensing scheme increases with the length of the known primary \nsignal\
    \ pattern. \nIn [86], the authors have opted for waveform-based sensing \nscheme\
    \ to analyze the sensing performance of the simultaneous \ntransmission-and-sensing\
    \ (TS) mode, which has proven its \neffectiveness under imperfect self-interference\
    \ signal (SIS), \nunlike energy detection that cannot differentiate between a\
    \ PU \nsignal and a residual SIS. \nIn spite of the aforementioned advantages,\
    \ there are some \ndownsides to this scheme, mainly the need for complete and\
    \ \naccurate information concerning waveform patterns as well as \nhigh synchronization\
    \ between PU and SU, which is not always \npossible to attain. \nConcerning the\
    \ implementation complexity, coherent \ndetection is more complex than Energy\
    \ detection method and \nhas a lower complexity compared to match filter detection\
    \ \ntechnique. \nTable III provides a performance comparison of the \npreviously\
    \ described narrowband sensing methods based on a \nset of performance criteria,\
    \ namely detection accuracy, \ncomplexity, need for prior information about the\
    \ primary user, \nrobustness against noise uncertainty, and sensing time required\
    \ \nto achieve a good performance. \n3) Wideband sensing techniques: Wideband\
    \ spectrum \nsensing enables detecting spectral opportunities that lie within\
    \ \nfrequency bands greater than the coherence bandwidth of the \nchannel. One\
    \ application of this class of sensing is to exploit \nthe available spectrum\
    \ holes in the UHF (ultra-high-\nfrequency) TV band ranging from 300 MHz to 3\
    \ GHz. \nAs have been discussed earlier, narrowband sensing \nschemes make a single\
    \ binary decision for the whole frequency \nband. That makes these schemes incapable\
    \ to perform directly \nwideband sensing, since the latter intends to determine\
    \ the \noccupancy of several sub-channels that are involved in a given \nwideband\
    \ spectrum at a time. \nThe two types of wideband sensing techniques (Nyquist\
    \ / \nSub-Nyquist) will be briefly reviewed in this subsection. \n \n \n112 |\

    \ \nwideband \nsensing: \nNyquist \nwideband \nsensing is carried out using a\
    \ standard ADC operating at \nNyquist rate to digitize the wideband signal and\
    \ digital signal \nprocessing methods to detect spectral opportunities. It \n\
    includes, among other, wavelet-based detection, multi-band \njoint detection,\
    \ and filter bank detection: \nWavelet-based detection [87] determines spectrum\
    \ holes \nover a wide frequency band, which is assumed to be composed \nof a multitude\
    \ of sub-bands whose locations and power spectral \ndensities are unknown, by\
    \ using the wavelet transform. The \nlatter serves to identify discontinuities\
    \ that are located at the \nboundaries (edges) of each sub-band. The discontinuous\
    \ \nchanges on the edges correspond to irregularities in power \nspectral density.\
    \ As such, information about the locations and \nintensities of the sub-bands\
    \ can be retrieved through the \nwavelet transform and then their status (occupied\
    \ or \nunoccupied) can be deduced. \nConcerning the multiband joint detection\
    \ algorithm [88], it \nsenses the primary signal over multiple frequency channels\
    \ by \nperforming the following procedures: first, sampling the \nwideband signal\
    \ using a high sampling rate analog to digital \nconverter. Second, dividing the\
    \ sampled data into parallel data \nstreams by a serial-to-parallel converter.\
    \ Third, computing the \nFast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the digital signal. Fourth,\
    \ \ndividing the wideband spectrum into multiple sub-bands that \nare occupied\
    \ by narrowband signals. Finally, detecting \nspectrum opportunities over each\
    \ sub-band by using a \nnarrowband sensing scheme such as energy detection. \n\
    Furthermore, this technique allows to jointly determine the \noptimal threshold,\
    \ that maximizes the accuracy of sensing for \nall the sub-channels, by formulating\
    \ an optimization problem. \nAs for filter bank detection [89], a filter bank,\
    \ consisting of \na set of bandpass filters, is used to separate the wideband\
    \ signal \ninto multiple sub-bands. The bandpass filters are realized \nthrough\
    \ modulation (Poly-phase decomposition) of a prototype \nfilter. The prototype\
    \ filter is a lowpass filter that is used to \nimplement the zeroth band of the\
    \ filter bank. The obtained sub-\nbands are then sensed separately via a narrowband\
    \ sensing \nscheme. In this type of sensing, the sub-bands can be down-\nconverted\
    \ and consequently re-sampled at a lower sampling \nrate. However, a large number\
    \ of RF components will be \nadded, resulting in a high implementation complexity\
    \ [90]. \nWhile Nyquist wideband sensing allows to exploit \nefficiently the available\
    \ spectrum, it has certain limitations, \nincluding the requirement of a high\
    \ sampling rate (Wavelet-\nbased detection and multiband joint detection) and\
    \ the high \nimplementation complexity (Filter bank). \nb) Sub-Nyquist \nwideband\
    \ \nsensing: \nSub-Nyquist \nwideband sensing offers solutions to the challenges\
    \ facing \nNyquist-based sensing, more particularly high sampling rate \nand high\
    \ implementation complexity concerns. Sub-Nyquist \napproaches aim to identify\
    \ spectral opportunities by exploiting \nonly a few measurements derived from\
    \ processing wideband \nsignals at sampling rates less than the Nyquist rate.\
    \ \nAmong the most important Sub-Nyquist wideband sensing \ntypes is compressive-based\
    \ sensing [91–93]. The latter refers to \nthe process of recovering a sparse signal\
    \ from a few \nmeasurements by following a three-step procedure (sparse \nrepresentation,\
    \ measurement, and sparse recovery). In the first \nstep, the sparsity of the\
    \ signal is derived by projecting the \nsignal on an appropriate basis. In second,\
    \ only a reduced \nnumber of measurements are retrieved by multiplying the \n\
    sparse signal by a measurement matrix. In third, the signal is \nrecovered by\
    \ using the few collected measurements. Finally, \nthe sensing operation is performed\
    \ to identify the spectral \nopportunities. \nIt is noteworthy that the use of\
    \ comprehensive sensing, in \nthe context of wideband sensing, is enabled due\
    \ to the sparsity \nfeature that characterizes the wideband signal in the frequency\
    \ \ndomain. \nFurthermore, the reliability of sub-Nyquist wideband \nsensing schemes\
    \ depends largely on the accuracy of sparsity \nlevel estimation. Although, the\
    \ latter suffers from uncertainty \nbecause of various factors, mainly the dynamic\
    \ nature of PUs \ntransmission activities as well as wireless channel impairments.\
    \ \nD. Machine Learning for Spectrum Sensing \nAs pointed out earlier, CR is an\
    \ intelligent radio system that \nincorporates the three main components which\
    \ any intelligent \nsystem should have, namely perception, learning, and \nreasoning\
    \ [94]. Perception refers to the ability of the system to \nsense its radio environment\
    \ and it can be realized by means of \nsensing measurements of the spectrum. Learning\
    \ refers to the \nability of the system to convert the gathered information into\
    \ \nknowledge and it can be achieved through classification and \n113 | P a g\

    \ Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \ngeneralization algorithms.\
    \ Finally, knowledge is exploited by \nthe system to attain its objectives via\
    \ reasoning ability \n[94].Considering this intelligent design, machine learning\
    \ \nbased spectrum sensing presents itself as a good alternative to \ndetermine\
    \ the channel occupancy in Cognitive Radio Networks \nby addressing two main issues\
    \ which are classification and \ndecision making [94]. \nMachine learning algorithms\
    \ can be classified into two \nbroad groups: supervised learning and unsupervised\
    \ learning. \nIn supervised learning, a classifier learns from a training \ndataset\
    \ to make predictions on unforeseen data. According to \nthe training dataset,\
    \ supervised machine learning problems can \nbe further grouped into classification\
    \ and regression problems. \nIf the input variables are mapped to discrete output\
    \ values \n(categories, labels, classes…), then it is a classification \nproblem.\
    \ If the input variables are mapped to continuous \noutput values, then it is\
    \ a regression problem. Some examples \nof supervised algorithms include support\
    \ vector machines \n(SVM), Random forest, and naive Bayesian classifier (NBC).\
    \ \nAs for unsupervised learning, its main function consists in \nfinding patterns\
    \ in a set of untagged data. K-means is one of \nthe simplest and most widely\
    \ used unsupervised machine \nlearning algorithms. \nIn the context of Cognitive\
    \ Radio Networks, several papers \nhave dealt with the use of machine learning\
    \ algorithms to \npredict the availability of frequency channels. For instance,\
    \ in \n[95], the authors performed a comparative analysis of different \nsupervised\
    \ and unsupervised machine learning algorithms \nbased on computational time and\
    \ classification accuracy. They \nalso proposed a new method that combines support\
    \ vector \nmachines with the firefly algorithm. The authors of [96] \nproposed\
    \ a deep learning approach to learn channel activities \nand predict its availability\
    \ in future time slots. The ability to \npredict the channel occupancy in the\
    \ next time slots may \nincrease the efficiency of selecting the more appropriate\
    \ \nchannel at the instant t (For example, choosing the channel \nhaving the highest\
    \ probability of being unoccupied in the next \ntime slots). \nGenerally, in the\
    \ case of spectrum sensing, researchers \nadopt a two-phase machine learning approach\
    \ [95,97]. In the \nfirst phase, an unsupervised learning technique, such as K-\n\
    means algorithm, is applied to discover the transmission \npatterns of primary\
    \ users. In the second phase, the discovered \nclusters (channel busy or free)\
    \ are used to train supervised \nlearning classifiers like support vector machine\
    \ (SVM) and \nthen to assign the new input data to the suitable cluster. it is\
    \ \nworth mentioning that in several works, the sensing clusters are \nassumed\
    \ to be known and thus the first phase is omitted. In this \ncase, the researchers\
    \ adopt a one-phase machine learning \napproach in which supervised learning techniques\
    \ are trained \nwith the already known clusters [98,99]. \nIn building machine\
    \ learning models for spectrum sensing, \nseveral features are used, including\
    \ energy statistic, probability \nvector, and occupancy over time. Obviously,\
    \ the accuracy of \ndetecting the primary users may be affected by the selected\
    \ \nfeatures. \nFinally, to evaluate the performance of a given model, a set \n\
    of metrics can be used mainly, probability of detection, \nprobability of false\
    \ alarm, total error rate, sensing time, and \naccuracy. \nE. Sensing Challenges\
    \ \nThis subsection is devoted to discussing the various \nchallenges related\
    \ to the spectrum sensing process in Cognitive \nRadio Networks as well as highlighting\
    \ some possible future \nresearch directions in this field. \n1) Hidden PU problem:\
    \ As the Carrier Sense Multiple \nAccessing (CSMA), which is characterized by\
    \ the presence of \nhidden node problem, spectrum sensing suffers also from \n\
    hidden primary user problem. The latter refers to the situation \nin which the\
    \ secondary user misses the primary user presence \ndue to many issues, including\
    \ severe multipath fading and \nshadowing effects experienced by primary signals,\
    \ during \npropagation from PU transmitter to SU receiver. As such, the \nsecondary\
    \ user may induce undesirable interference to \nprimary user receivers. In several\
    \ research papers, cooperative \nsensing has been proposed as a successful approach\
    \ to handle \nthis issue by exploiting spatial diversity [49,100]. \n2) Challenges\
    \ related to cooperative sensing: Cooperative \nsensing has proven to be effective\
    \ in improving the reliability \nand accuracy of detection, especially in the\
    \ case of the \npresence of channel impairments. Moreover, it has also been \n\
    shown to be useful in decreasing individual sensing durations \nand local processing\
    \ requirements [21,53]. \nDespite its different advantages, cooperation among\
    \ CR \nusers also brought many challenges and invoked significant \nresearches.\
    \ One of these challenges is mitigating the additional \nsignaling overhead and\
    \ reducing delays that are induced by the \ncooperation process [101]. \nAnother\
    \ challenge is to find a tradeoff between the number \nof users participating\
    \ in cooperation and additional processing \nrequirements. Indeed, a large number\
    \ of cooperative nodes can \nensure a high probability of detection, even in the\
    \ presence of \nchannel uncertainties and detectors with less sensitivity, but\
    \ it \nintroduces a considerable amount of extra overhead which \nleads to an\
    \ increase in the sensing time and processing. Hence, \nthere exists a compromise.\
    \ \nAnother challenge consists in developing asynchronous \ncooperative spectrum\
    \ sensing algorithms [102,103]. In fact, CR \nnodes are located at different positions\
    \ and may perform \nspectrum sensing at different times [104]. Therefore, CR nodes\
    \ \ncannot report their local sensing results to the fusion center at \nthe same\
    \ time and thus some of the reported information may \nnot be up to date [103].\
    \ Furthermore, there is always a time \noffset between the local observation and\
    \ the final decision \nwhich may incur performance degradation. In addition, \n\
    reporting channel uncertainties may impact negatively the \nsensing accuracy.\
    \ \n3) Spectrum sensing duration: Admittedly, a long sensing \nduration can guarantee\
    \ a higher accuracy for spectrum sensing \nresults, but it can compromise with\
    \ interference avoidance, \nenergy efficiency, and throughput. \n114 | P a g e\
    \  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer\
    \ Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \nRegarding interference avoidance,\
    \ secondary users must be \naware promptly of the presence of the primary user\
    \ and vacate \nthe frequency band rapidly when the incumbent user resumes \nits\
    \ transmission in that band. Thus, a real trade-off arises \nbetween the quickness\
    \ with which the secondary user must \nperform the aforementioned tasks and the\
    \ required sensing \nduration to ensure more reliable results. \nConcerning energy\
    \ efficiency, the gain in accuracy \nachieved by a long sensing duration comes\
    \ at the expense of \nenergy. Hence, sensing duration and energy efficiency should\
    \ \nbe optimized. \nAs for throughput, it is inversely related to sensing time.\
    \ \nTherefore, there is a compromise between longer sensing \nduration for higher\
    \ performance and lower sensing duration for \ngood throughput. \nThese trade-offs\
    \ should be addressed jointly to find an \noptimum solution that ensure a higher\
    \ performance under \ncertain constraints. \n4) Noise \nuncertainty: \nSeveral\
    \ \nspectrum \nsensing \ntechniques rely on a threshold value to decide on the\
    \ presence \nof primary user signals. Hence, selecting the optimum \nthreshold\
    \ is crucial and important to ensure high accuracy of \nsensing results. To determine\
    \ the best threshold value, many \nparameters should be taken into consideration\
    \ such as noise \npower. The latter is uncertain and developing techniques that\
    \ \nare robust to noise uncertainty is still a challenging task. Some \nresearch\
    \ papers have addressed this issue using different \napproaches. For instance,\
    \ in [105] a blind spectrum sensing \ntechnique based on goodness of fit testing\
    \ of t‐distribution \nhas been proposed to cope with the noise uncertainty problem.\
    \ \n5) Complexity and hardware requirements: Several issues \nneed to be addressed\
    \ to bridge the gap between the theory and \nthe hardware implementation realities\
    \ of spectrum sensing \nschemes from both types, narrowband and wideband sensing.\
    \ \nThese include the complexity of narrowband sensing \ntechniques, mainly covariance-based\
    \ and cyclostationary \nfeature detection schemes, which require large processing\
    \ \npower that is unsuitable for portable devices. Hence, \nAdditional efforts\
    \ are required to reduce the complexity of \nthese techniques and take advantage\
    \ of their various benefits \nin real-life application. Besides, meeting the hardware\
    \ \nrequirements of wideband sensing schemes, like high-\nresolution ADCs and\
    \ high-speed signal processors, while \nmaintaining acceptable complexity and\
    \ moderate computation \npower, is a challenging task. \n6) Sparsity level uncertainty:\
    \ In wideband compressive \nsensing, estimating the accurate sparsity level is\
    \ of paramount \nimportance, since it is a prerequisite for determining the \n\
    optimal number of measurements. However, achieving this \nresult is very difficult,\
    \ especially in rapidly changing \nenvironments, due to random changes in spectrum\
    \ activities \nand time-varying fading channels. That may lead to calculate \n\
    the number of measurements using the worst-case sparsity \nlevel assumption, resulting\
    \ in high energy consumption and \ninefficient use of sub-Nyquist sampling technologies.\
    \ \nTherefore, developing blind sub-Nyquist wideband sensing \nschemes, in which\
    \ the estimation of sparsity level isn’t \nneeded, still a challenging task [90].\
    \ \nIn the literature, only a few papers have dealt with the issue \nof sparsity\
    \ level uncertainty. For instance, the authors of [106] \nproposed an algorithm\
    \ for estimating the sparsity level of the \nchannel over a learned dictionary\
    \ using Machine Learning \nalgorithms. \n7) Security: As with any wireless network,\
    \ Cognitive \nRadio Networks are vulnerable to various cybersecurity \nattacks\
    \ that can be performed by selfish or malicious users and \ninduce disruptive\
    \ effects on network operation. Selfish users \nexploit network facilities for\
    \ their interests, namely \nmonopolizing the use of available spectrum opportunities\
    \ and \nthus depriving legitimate Secondary users of their fair share of \nspectrum.\
    \ As for malicious users, they abuse network facilities \nby exploiting the existing\
    \ vulnerabilities and thereby \nhindering legitimate SUs from using the spectrum.\
    \ \nSome of the cybersecurity attacks in Cognitive Radio \nNetworks include most\
    \ active band (MAB), primary user \nemulation (PUE), and spectrum sensing data\
    \ falsification \n(SSDF) attacks. \nMost active band (MAB) attack aims at detecting\
    \ and \nmaking the most active band, in a multi-band CR network, \nunavailable\
    \ by targeting it via a denial of service (DoS) attack \nand consequently preventing\
    \ the other users (PU and SU) from \nusing it. The authors of [107] proposed a\
    \ coordinated \nconcealment strategy to counter this attack. In this strategy,\
    \ a \nset of SUs cooperate and transmit useless data in a free band to \nmake\
    \ it the most active and therefore the attacker's target. \nPrimary user emulation\
    \ (PUE) attack is an attack where a \nselfish or malicious node adjusts its air\
    \ interface to emulate \nprimary user characteristics and thus mislead secondary\
    \ users \nconcerning the availability of the spectrum holes [108]. During \nthe\
    \ sensing process, SUs, under this attack, may detect attacker \nsignals as primary\
    \ user signals and then refrain from using the \nspectrum. A range of countermeasures\
    \ against PUE attack has \nbeen \ninvestigated \nin \nthe \nliterature \n[109].\
    \ \nThese \ncountermeasures can be categorized into four types: \ncountermeasures\
    \ based on cryptography, countermeasures \nbased on fingerprint, countermeasures\
    \ based on game theory, \nand hybrid countermeasures that combine the three other\
    \ types \n[109]. \nSpectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attack, also \n\
    known as Byzantine attack, specially targets cooperative \nspectrum sensing and\
    \ consists in compromising the fusion \ncenter with false spectrum sensing results\
    \ to deceive decision-\nmaking. In [110], a reputation-based approach, in which\
    \ the \nfusion center recognizes the malicious attackers and eliminates \nthem\
    \ from the data fusion process, was proposed to counter \nSSDF attack. \nWhile\
    \ significant efforts have been carried out to detect and \ncope with cybersecurity\
    \ issues, there are still several challenges \nthat need to be addressed, including\
    \ developing advanced \ntechniques that do not need prior knowledge about PU location\
    \ \n115 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA) International Journal of\
    \ Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \n, as this\
    \ is not always available in real-world scenarios, \ndeveloping detection and\
    \ counter-measures methods based on \ncryptography that take into account resource\
    \ constraint (e.g., \npower and bandwidth), and developing spectrum sensing \n\
    techniques capable of differentiating between PU signals and \nmalicious user\
    \ signals. \nV. CR-BASED IOT \nThe wide variety of IoT technologies have led to\
    \ a rapidly \nincreasing number of networked devices that are expected to \nreach\
    \ 51.11 billion by 2023, according to research from Cisco \nstates (See Fig. 13).\
    \ Such devices involve daily tech gadgets \nsuch as smartphones and smart home\
    \ devices, as well as \nindustrial devices like smart machines and robots. These\
    \ smart \nconnected devices are capable of gathering, sharing, and \nanalyzing\
    \ information and creating actions accordingly. By \n2023, global spending on\
    \ IoT will reach 1.1 trillion U.S. dollar \n[111]. This puts IoT at the core of\
    \ current and future social and \neconomic transformation. \nFurthermore, with\
    \ the massive proliferation of these \nconnected objects, there is an increased\
    \ demand for spectrum \nresources. Cognitive Radio proves to be a promising \n\
    technology to cater to current and future IoT devices in terms \nof spectrum access.\
    \ In this section, the integration of the \nInternet of Things and Cognitive Radio\
    \ is explored. \n \nFig. 13. IoT Connected Devices Installed base Worldwide from\
    \ 2015 to 2025 \n(in billions)3. \nA. Definition of IoT \nThe term \"Internet\
    \ of Things\" was coined by Kevin Ashton \nto depict “a system in which the Internet\
    \ is connected to the \nphysical world by ubiquitous sensors”4. \nInternet of\
    \ Things (IoT) can be defined as a network of \nobjects connected to the Internet\
    \ and can communicate with \neach other using different communication technologies.\
    \ These \nobjects are equipped with sensors, that allow interaction with \nthe\
    \ environment, and communication modules [112–114]. \nSome of those sensors include\
    \ temperature sensors, pressure \nsensors, proximity sensors, and humidity sensors.\
    \ \nToday, the IoT enables the real world and the virtual/or \ndigital world interconnection.\
    \ Thanks to IoT, things will \n3 https://www.statista.com/statistics/668996/worldwide-expenditures-for-\n\
    the-internet-of-things/ \n4 https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=3411\
    \ \ncommunicate with each other and develop their own \nintelligence. Televisions,\
    \ cars, kitchen appliances, surveillance \ncameras, smartphones, utility meters,\
    \ cardiac monitors, \nthermostats, and almost anything that we can imagine will\
    \ be \nconnected every day, everywhere and every time. \nThe idea of the IoT dates\
    \ back to 1999 [115] and became a \nreality due to several technologies and protocols,\
    \ including \nMachine to Machine (M2M), Wireless Sensor Networks \n(WSN), Radio\
    \ frequency Dentification (RFID), Internet \nProtocol version 6 (IPv6), IPv6 Low\
    \ power Wireless Personal \nArea Networks (6LoWPAN), Routing Protocol for Low-Power\
    \ \nand \nLossy \nNetworks \n(RPL), \nConstrained \nApplication \nProtocol(CoAP),\
    \ and Cognitive Radio that comes to empower \nthe IoT revolution. This revolution\
    \ gives birth to the \nproliferation of small devices such as sensors and actuators,\
    \ \nwith low consumption at lower cost, and a large number of \nplatforms allowing\
    \ users to develop their own applications. \nThus, the number of connected « things\
    \ » is increasing \nexponentially in the world (See Fig. 13). \nB. Motivations\
    \ behind the use of Cognitive Radio in the IoT \nCognitive Radio has a great potential\
    \ to address several \nissues and challenges related to the deployment of IoT\
    \ \nnetworks, namely, resource scarcity, interferences problem, \nlimited communication\
    \ range, purchasing license, storing and \nanalyzing the data generated by IoT\
    \ objects, heterogeneity, and \nreconfigurability and autonomicity. Dealing with\
    \ these issues \npresents the prime motivation behind the use of Cognitive \n\
    Radio in IoT. \nRegarding spectrum resources, it is difficult to allocate \nfrequency\
    \ bands to all the ever-increasing number of IoT \nobjects. CR address this issue\
    \ by enabling frequency reuse. \n As for the interference problem, most IoT technologies\
    \ \nsuch as RFID, IEEE 802.15.4 (ZigBee) operates in UHF and \nISM frequency bands\
    \ which are already saturated and can’t \naccommodate more applications. Thus,\
    \ sharing these bands \nbetween a large number of objects creates inevitable \n\
    interferences. CR deal with this issue by enabling dynamic \nspectrum access to\
    \ interference-free channels. \nConcerning communication range, ISM unlicensed\
    \ bands \nallow wireless technologies to operate only over a limited \nrange.\
    \ Acquiring a frequency spectrum, that ensures \ncommunications over long distances,\
    \ requires the purchase of \nlicenses which generates superfluous expenses. CR\
    \ avoids the \npurchase of license and allows the opportunistic usage of \nunoccupied\
    \ bands that enables long-distance communications. \nIn terms of storing and analyzing\
    \ the data generated by IoT \nobjects, the objects must find communication links\
    \ to transmit \nthe generated information to numerous servers (Cloud servers).\
    \ \nCR is a proper solution to resolve this issue. \nWith respect to heterogeneity\
    \ problems, IoT applications \nrepresent a wide range of design options (resources,\
    \ \ndeployment, connectivity, energy, communication modality, \ninfrastructure,\
    \ network size, network topology...). Thus, new \ncommunication paradigms should\
    \ be designed to support this \nheterogeneity by providing environmental discovery,\
    \ self-\norganization, and self-management capabilities [116]. CR is \n116 | P\
    \ a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n                                          \
    \                 \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science\
    \ and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \none of these paradigms that can be\
    \ used to tackle heterogeneity \nissues. \nAnother reason is related to reconfigurability\
    \ and \nautonomicity. In fact, smart objects are expected to have the \ncapacity\
    \ to reconfigure. themselves without any external \naction. Thus, objects need\
    \ to be able to recognize and analyze \ntheir environment, detect neighboring\
    \ objects, and then \nreconfigure. themselves. CR proves to be a suitable solution\
    \ to \nfit these circumstances. \nTaking into account all of the above, it can\
    \ be concluded \nthat Cognitive Radio is genuinely a promising enabler \ntechnology\
    \ for IoT. \nC. IoT Applications and CR \nThe deployment of IoT products and services\
    \ will be \npresent in all sectors and industries, from the smart home to the\
    \ \nsmart city, education, health care, manufacturing, energy, \nutilities, commerce,\
    \ transportation, monitoring, supply chain, \nand logistics as illustrated in\
    \ Fig. 14. In general, the \nopportunities offered by IoT are unlimited and its\
    \ full impact \nand potential will be realized in the near future as more and\
    \ \nmore devices connect to the Internet. At present, there are few \nworks in\
    \ the literature dealing with potential applications of \nCR technology for IoT,\
    \ including military applications, \ncognitive radio-vehicular ad hoc networks\
    \ (CR-VANET), \nemergency networks, smart grids, smart metering, and medical \n\
    applications [117–123]. Table IV describes some IoT \napplications while demonstrating\
    \ how CR can be used to \naddress a number of their concerns. \nD. Open Research\
    \ Issues in CR-Based IoT \nSeveral open research issues need to be addressed in\
    \ order \nto take advantage of the full potential of Cognitive Radio for \nIoT\
    \ networks. In this subsection, some of these issues will be \ndiscussed. \n1)\
    \ Optimization of network resources: Efficient spectrum \nutilization, in the\
    \ context of a network composed of CR IoT \nnodes, requires the joint optimization\
    \ of a set of parameters \nsuch as transmission power, energy efficiency, transmission\
    \ \ndelay, and transmission data rate, which is a challenging task. \nThe authors\
    \ of [125] formulated an optimization problem to \nconverge to an optimal solution,\
    \ in a constrained environment, \nby taking into account three variables namely;\
    \ transmission \npower, transmission rate, and transmission delay. To solve this\
    \ \nproblem, they applied a branch-and-cut polyhedral approach. \nThe results\
    \ show that an increase in network and packet size \nleads to an increase in transmission\
    \ delay, power, rate, and \ninterference. \nFormulating and solving multi-objective\
    \ optimization \nproblems, considering a large number of factors, still need to\
    \ \nbe addressed. \n2) Energy efficiency: One of the main challenges that \nneed\
    \ to be addressed in CR-based IoT networks is energy \nefficiency. IoT objects\
    \ with cognitive radio capabilities \nconsume more energy due to performing additional\
    \ functions \nmainly spectrum sensing, which intensifies the power \nconsumption\
    \ issue, especially for energy-constrained nodes \nand battery-powered devices.\
    \ \n \nFig. 14. Applications of IoT. \nTABLE IV. \nCR CONTRIBUTION IN IOT APPLICATIONS\
    \ \nIoT application \nDescription and CR contribution \nSmart Grids [120,121]\
    \ \nSmart Grid is an electricity distribution network that allows the flow of\
    \ information between producers and consumers in order to \ncontrol and regulate\
    \ the flow of electricity in real time and enable more efficient management of\
    \ the electricity grid. The major \nchallenge of this technology is the transmission\
    \ of data through long distances without investing in the purchase of licenses\
    \ or the \ninstallation of cable trays. Cognitive radio offers a good solution\
    \ to this problem. \nSmart Homes [117] \nHomes will be equipped with smart objects,\
    \ allowing to carry out all daily task, such as smart lamps and smart fridges.\
    \ These \nobjects will integrate sensors endowed with cognitive capabilities that\
    \ help to avoid interference in the ISM band. \nHealthcare and Medical \nApplications\
    \ [122,123] \nSmart sensors are deployed to monitor critical data like blood pressure,\
    \ glucose levels, and temperature. With Cognitive Radio \nthis information can\
    \ be transmitted to medical staff in real time, over long distances without worrying\
    \ about spectrum availability. \nSmart Cities [119] \nThe smart city is a paradigm\
    \ of urban development which integrates information and communication technology\
    \ (ICT) and IoT \nsystems. In this paradigm, continuous connectivity should be\
    \ maintained. CRNs can be a good solution to support this \nrequirement. \nInternet\
    \ of Vehicles (IoV) \n[124] \nToday, the trends toward less dependence on human\
    \ beings have led us to the IoV paradigm in which vehicle control is achieved\
    \ \nthrough the integration of communications and embedded systems. The IoV is\
    \ supposed to be an autonomous travel decision-\nmaker. Safe navigation may be\
    \ possible in the future through vehicle-to-vehicle information exchange, vehicle-mounted\
    \ sensors, \nand user intentions. The challenge in IoVs is the availability of\
    \ spectrum for mobile vehicles. CRNs may be a good solution \nbecause of their\
    \ long-range and interference-free spectrum sensing. \n \n117 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org\

    \ \nfor \nGreen \nComputing \nand \nreal-world \nimplementation of IoT. In [127]\
    \ a differential game model has \nbeen proposed to resolve the resource allocation\
    \ problem in \ncognitive WSN using energy harvesting. Optimal resource \nallocation\
    \ strategies for all SUs are obtained by determining \nthe loop Nash equilibrium\
    \ and the feedback Nash equilibrium \nsolutions of the proposed model. In [128],\
    \ a CR-based energy \nharvesting approach has been used to extend the battery’s\
    \ \nlifetime for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) under reliability \nand secrecy\
    \ constraints. To reduce energy consumption, the \nenergy harvested is maximized\
    \ and the transmission energy \nconsumption \nis \nminimized \nby \nsolving \n\
    a \nformulated \noptimization problem. \nCurrently, Cognitive Radio networks based\
    \ on energy \nefficiency approaches are considered an important research \ndirection.\
    \ \n3) Security: Addressing security issues in CR-Based IoT \nnetworks is a prime\
    \ concern and a challenging task as most \nIoT objects are inherently heterogeneous\
    \ and have their proper \nuniform security standards. These standards are not\
    \ adequate \nfor all heterogeneous networks. Several privacy and security \naspects\
    \ should be taken into account in designing IoT systems, \nincluding authentication,\
    \ security assurance, and intrusion \nsoft-ware [117]. Worthy efforts have been\
    \ done to tackle \nsecurity issues in some IoT applications with cognitive radio\
    \ \ncapabilities. For instance, the authors of [129] proposed a \ndistributed\
    \ cooperative spectrum sensing approach to deal \nwith the security problem in\
    \ CR-VANETs. This approach uses \na weighted consensus-based spectrum sensing\
    \ technique with \ntrust assistance to ensure the reliability of spectrum sensing\
    \ \noperation in a hostile CR-VANET. The validity of the \nproposed approach was\
    \ approved by extensive simulations. In \n[128], the proposed CR-Based energy\
    \ management scheme for \nUAVs has been designed in such a way that the secrecy\
    \ and \nreliability of the system are ensured. This is illustrated by \nconsidering\
    \ the scenario for the eavesdroppers. \nSecurity remains an open issue to be addressed\
    \ as \ncybersecurity attacks and threats are emerging and increasing \nin parallel\
    \ with new technologies. Therefore, developing \ninnovative countermeasures is\
    \ demanded. \nVI. CONCLUSION \nNowadays, wireless network devices are emerging\
    \ at an \nunprecedented rate, which will further exacerbate spectrum \nshortages.\
    \ Therefore, addressing the spectrum scarcity problem \nbecomes more urgent. Cognitive\
    \ Radio is a promising \ntechnology to overcome this issue for futuristic networks\
    \ (IoT \nand 5G) by enabling an efficient, flexible, and opportunistic \nusage\
    \ of the scarce frequency spectrum. This paper provides a \nreview of Cognitive\
    \ Radio with emphasis is put on SDR, \nspectrum sensing, and CR-Based IoT. Concerning\
    \ SDR, this \narticle highlights its architecture, tools, advantages, and some\
    \ \nof its ongoing challenges. As for spectrum sensing, it is \nextensively reviewed:\
    \ spectrum opportunities considering \nmultiple dimensions are discussed, classification\
    \ of spectrum \nsensing based on several aspects is presented, Narrowband and\
    \ \nWideband sensing techniques are analyzed, ML-based \nspectrum sensing is studied,\
    \ and challenges and open research \ndirections are reviewed. Regarding CR-Based\
    \ IoT, the focus \nwas on explaining the motivations behind the use of CR in IoT\
    \ \nnetworks and reviewing some of the open issues related to CR-\nBased IoT.\

  title: A Review on SDR, Spectrum Sensing, and CR-based IoT in Cognitive Radio Networks
  verbatim_quote1: '"Real-time, automated management of irrigation systems to improve
    water use efficiency is becoming increasingly important due to the rapidly growing
    global demand for food and the dwindling supply of fresh water resources. Addressing
    this issue requires a comprehensive approach that integrates sensing technologies,
    data transmission and processing, and decision-making algorithms. This paper presents
    a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art in automated irrigation management
    systems, covering data collection technologies, communication protocols, data
    processing and analysis techniques, and decision-making algorithms for optimizing
    irrigation schedules." [1]'
  verbatim_quote2: '"Current approaches to data collection in automated irrigation
    systems primarily involve the use of sensors to collect real-time data on soil
    moisture content, plant water status, and environmental conditions. Various sensor
    types are employed, including tensiometers, soil moisture sensors, and weather
    stations, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. The choice of sensors
    depends on factors such as soil type, crop type, and the specific irrigation method
    used." [1]'

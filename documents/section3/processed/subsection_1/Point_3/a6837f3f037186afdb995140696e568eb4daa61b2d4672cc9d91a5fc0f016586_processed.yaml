    \ digital twin; fAPAR; Sentinel; evapotranspiration\n1. Introduction\nPresently,\
    \ water is becoming scarce not only in arid and drought areas, but also in\nregions\
    \ where rainfall used to be abundant. Although approximately 70% of freshwater\n\
    resources is used for food production, less than 60% of all water used for irrigation\
    \ is\neffectively used by crops [1]. One way to address this issue is to reduce\
    \ inefﬁciencies in\nirrigation management. This requires modernization of irrigation,\
    \ from river catchment to\nprecise delivery and scheduling at the ﬁeld level.\
    \ Although it is true that there is a lot of\nscientiﬁc and technical knowledge\
    \ about the best irrigation strategies to be adopted for each\ncrop and time at\
    \ the ﬁeld level, putting them into practice is not a simple task. The main\n\
    limitations are the availability of the tools and skills required that allow the\
    \ quantiﬁcation\nand monitoring of crop water requirements and water status in\
    \ order to provide the right\namount of water at the right time and place. In\
    \ this context, precision irrigation, which\nis the application of the concept\
    \ of precision agriculture to the ﬁeld of irrigation, can\ncontribute to the technological\
    \ approach. Precision agriculture has been recently deﬁned\nWater 2023, 15, 2506.\

    \ 2023, 15, 2506\n2 of 23\nas “a management strategy that gathers, processes and\
    \ analyses temporal, spatial and\nindividual data and combines it with other information\
    \ to support management decisions\naccording to estimated variability for improved\
    \ resource use efﬁciency, productivity, quality,\nproﬁtability and sustainability\
    \ of agricultural production” [2]. The latest technological\ndevelopments in precision\
    \ irrigation offer important opportunities to close the existing gap\nbetween\
    \ water productivity and the proﬁtability of an agricultural plot.\nCrop water\
    \ requirements are usually calculated following the FAO-56 soil water bal-\nance\
    \ (SWB) approach [3]. This approach is based on estimating maximum crop evapotran-\n\
    spiration (ETc), obtained by multiplying a reference evapotranspiration (ET0),\
    \ calculated\nthrough the Penman–Monteith method, by a crop coefﬁcient (Kc) that\
    \ is characteristic\nfor each crop and growth stage. However, particularly in\
    \ woody crops, this approach\ncan be quite uncertain as Kc may vary depending\
    \ on factors such as row spacing and\norientation, variety, crop load and canopy\
    \ training system [4,5]. With respect to the latter\nof these factors, some studies\
    \ have reﬁned Kc in discontinuous canopies with indirect\nmeasurements of light\
    \ interception [6–8]. Additionally, supplying the full water require-\nments is\
    \ not always possible or desirable. For instance, regulated deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ (RDI)\nstrategies have been successfully adopted to achieve higher water productivities\
    \ [9–11]\nand/or fruit quality [12–14]. Crop water status can be monitored with\
    \ sensors and used\nfor irrigation scheduling [15–17]. Among the different sensors\
    \ that are available, soil mois-\nture capacitance sensors are probably the most\
    \ widely used to trigger irrigation [18,19].\nAlthough the simplest methodology\
    \ is based on the switching on or off of valves when the\nsignal of a soil moisture\
    \ probe crosses some predeﬁned threshold, commonly soil water\ncontent at ﬁeld\
    \ capacity and wilting point [20], particular consideration needs to be given\n\
    to the high sensitivity of these sensors to differences in soil hydraulic properties\
    \ and the\nheterogeneous distribution of soil water content, especially in drip\
    \ irrigation systems. A\ncombination of SWB and soil water content monitoring\
    \ methods seems the best way to\nefﬁciently schedule irrigation [21]. This type\
    \ of dual approaches are based on determining\nirrigation doses from a SWB model\
    \ and feedback from sensors for the site-speciﬁc empirical\nadjustment of Kc [22,23].\
    \ The methodology proposed by Casadesús et al. [22] uses the trend\nof minimum\
    \ soil moisture values between consecutive days to ﬁne tune the water balance.\n\
    IRRIX was a decision support system (DSS) designed for SWB-based automated irrigation\n\
    scheduling locally tuned by sensors. Its feasibility was demonstrated in various\
    \ crops such\nas Japanese plum [24], apple [23] or olive trees [21]. This manuscript\
    \ introduces further\nimprovements of IRRIX, described in Section 2.3, in which\
    \ the assimilation of sensor data\nby a SWB model has been further developed with\
    \ the emerging paradigms of digital twins\nand the Internet of Things (IoT). A\
    \ digital twin is a virtual representation that serves as\nthe real-time digital\
    \ counterpart of a physical object or process [25]. The new automated\nirrigation\
    \ system introduced in this study computes crop water requirements and closes\n\
    the irrigation control loop autonomously, on a daily basis, importing data from\
    \ soil/plant\nsensors, meteorology and remote sensing. Irrigation prescriptions\
    \ are automatically sent to\nthe irrigation controller installed in the ﬁeld compliant\
    \ with site-speciﬁc strategies. The\ndigital twin behind the automated irrigation\
    \ system also allows to simulate the different\nSWB components separately, so\
    \ the end user can see in real time the amount of water used\nor the crop water\
    \ status.\nOne of the main limitations of only using soil and/or plant sensors\
    \ to trigger irrigation\nis that this will be based on point measurements which\
    \ sometimes are not representative of\nthe heterogeneity of the entire irrigation\
    \ sector. Satellite-based remote sensing technologies\nopen up the possibility\
    \ of providing spatio-temporal information of ﬁelds in near real time.\nIn particular,\
    \ the recent launch of the open access Sentinel-2 satellites (S2) makes it possible\n\
    to monitor vegetative growth on a ﬁve-day turnaround, as long as there are no\
    \ clouds [26].\nTypically, remote sensing spectral vegetation indices, such as\
    \ the normalized difference\nvegetation index (NDVI), have been used to derive\
    \ Kc values [27–29]. However, saturation\nissues of some of these indices at moderate-to-dense\
    \ canopy levels and limitations of crops\nwith clumped canopy structures have\
    \ been widely reported [30,31]. Instead, estimations\nWater 2023, 15, 2506\n3\
    \ of 23\nof biophysical parameters of the vegetation could be more effective for\
    \ the monitoring\nof vegetative growth and therefore the estimation of potential\
    \ evapotranspiration. In\nthis regard, the remote sensing-derived fraction of\
    \ intercepted photosynthetically active\nradiation (fIPAR) or the fraction of\
    \ absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR)\nhave been estimated in\
    \ different crops, mostly using empirical relationships with spectral\nvegetation\
    \ indices [32–35]. However, this approach is site speciﬁc and sensitive to the\n\
    canopy architecture, the row orientation, the optical properties of the canopy\
    \ elements\nand the background [36]. Very few studies have aimed to derive fIPAR\
    \ in heterogeneous\ncanopies, such as row-structured canopies, using radiative\
    \ transfer models [18,37,38].\nThe fAPAR can also be derived from the biophysical\
    \ processor available in the Sentinel\nApplication Platform (SNAP), which built\
    \ a neuronal network with the PROSAIL model\nand applied it to all S2 reﬂective\
    \ bands [39]. fAPAR is often approximated by fIPAR\nbecause the vegetation pigments\
    \ present a strong absorption in this spectral domain\nand the background reﬂectivities\
    \ are usually small for well-developed canopies [40,41].\nTherefore, S2 fAPAR\
    \ time series could be a good alternative for assimilation into digital\ntwins\
    \ and to estimate potential evapotranspiration in all types of canopy structures.\n\
    It is well known that other approaches have also been developed to directly retrieve\n\
    crop water requirements based on remotely sensed surface energy balance (SEB)\
    \ mod-\nels [42–44]. Land surface temperature (LST) plays a critical role in the\
    \ SEB. However, a\ntrade-off exists between the spatial and temporal resolution\
    \ of current thermal infrared\nsensors onboard satellites. While waiting for the\
    \ launch of new satellites with sensors with\na high spatial-temporal resolution\
    \ in the thermal infrared domain, several approaches have\nbeen tested to downscale\
    \ the coarse resolution of thermal infrared satellite imagery [45–48].\nFor instance,\
    \ some studies have successfully downscaled LST to 20 m using a data mining\n\
    sharpening (DMS) approach [48] with S2 and Sentinel-3 (S3) images [49]. The obtained\n\
    LST, together with other Copernicus-based inputs, was used to estimate daily actual\
    \ evapo-\ntranspiration (ETa) through the Priestley–Taylor version of the two-source\
    \ energy balance\n(TSEB-PT) model [50–53]. These studies reported accuracies of\
    \ instantaneous latent heat\nﬂux in woody crops ranging from 76 to 87 W/m2. It\
    \ is probable that in the near future SEB\nmodelling approaches with high-resolution\
    \ LST will be operationally used to map crop\nwater status in near real time and\
    \ assimilated into digital twins such as the one proposed in\nthis study. Therefore,\
    \ studies that validate these approaches in different types of crops and\nwater\
    \ status are necessary to advance the state of the art and evaluate their pros\
    \ and cons.\nOne of the main challenges of automated irrigation DSS is to implement\
    \ them in com-\nmercial ﬁelds. From our knowledge, no study has used a DSS to\
    \ automatically schedule\nirrigation of a commercial vineyard through assimilating\
    \ in near real time remote sensing\nestimates of fAPAR. Nor has it been used in\
    \ commercial ﬁelds with the adoption of RDI\nstrategies. Nor have digital twin-obtained\
    \ SWB simulations been validated or compared\nagainst other methodologies. Therefore,\
    \ the aim of this research is to demonstrate the feasi-\nbility of automatically\
    \ scheduling the irrigation of a commercial vineyard by assimilating\nS2 fAPAR\
    \ and adopting an RDI strategy. In particular, this study focuses on: (i) regressing\n\
    S2 fAPAR with instantaneous fIPAR and upscaling it on a daily time scale using\
    \ Oyarzun’s\nmodelling approach [54] in rows with different orientations, (ii)\
    \ the suitability of adopt-\ning an RDI strategy through an automated irrigation\
    \ DSS, and (iii) a comparison of the\nevapotranspiration simulations obtained\
    \ from a digital twin with those estimated with the\nTSEB-PTS2+S3 and Penman–Monteith\
    \ (PM) models using Copernicus-based inputs.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Study\

    2.3. IrriDesk® and Deﬁnition of the Irrigation Seasonal Plan\nThe automated irrigation\
    \ decision support system (DSS) used in this study, so called\nIrriDesk®, is open-access\
    \ accessible for research purposes through a non-commercial ver-\nsion and also\
    \ commercially available to any grower through an external company. IrriDesk®\n\
    (www.irridesk.com) is a cloud-hosted platform developed under the paradigm of\
    \ digital\ntwin, which on a daily basis, sends updated prescriptions to irrigation\
    \ controllers, following\nthe integration of different data sources such as local\
    \ sensors, meteorological and remote\nsensing data. IrriDesk® is an evolution\
    \ of IRRIX, which has previously been used in several\ntrials of sensor-based\
    \ irrigation control [21,23,24]. In both cases, the underlying approach\nfor irrigation\
    \ scheduling is a site-speciﬁc soil water balance (SWB) ﬁne-tuned by sensors [22].\n\
    In this approach, irrigation prescriptions for each management zone are calculated\
    \ once a\nday, based on an SWB model, in mm/day, and are sent machine-to-machine\
    \ to the irrigation\ncontroller after conversion to minutes of irrigation per\
    \ irrigation event, considering the\nproperties of the irrigation system and the\
    \ programmed irrigation frequency.\nA relevant feature of IrriDesk® is that irrigation\
    \ scheduling is guided by a seasonal\nplan, which allows the application of more\
    \ elaborate strategies, such as supplemental\nWater 2023, 15, 2506\n6 of 23\n\
    irrigation and RDI for managing irrigation with limiting water allocations. The\
    \ seasonal\nplan speciﬁes, for each day, a range of acceptable accumulated irrigation\
    \ since the start of\nthe season until that day. Then, if the measured irrigation\
    \ approaches the borders of that\nrange (maximum and minimum), the irrigation\
    \ prescriptions do not respond to sensors but\nare calculated to keep the accumulated\
    \ irrigation within the range. The target soil moisture\nis also speciﬁed in the\
    \ seasonal plan and can be set at different values along the season.\nAdditionally,\
    \ intended water unbalances can be speciﬁed at precise periods of the season\n\
    in terms of the ratio between the irrigation to prescribe and the irrigation resulting\
    \ from\nthe SWB model.\nIn the trials reported in this study, the seasonal plan\
    \ was elaborated through SWB\nsimulations, using as inputs the agronomical description\
    \ of the crop, soil and irrigation\nsetup, the historical weather at the site\
    \ in the previous 10 years, the range of annual\nirrigation applied in previous\
    \ years and the curve of intended water unbalance agreed\nbetween researchers\
    \ and farmer. In the studied vineyard, the upper and lower applied\nwater thresholds\
    \ were, respectively, set at 150 and 230 mm (Figure 2c). Since the aim was to\n\
    adopt an RDI strategy, water status levels were deﬁned as a multiplier of irrigation\
    \ needs\nor intended water deviations from the SWB (Figure 2a). For instance,\
    \ in this study the\nmultiplier was set to 0.6 during pre-veraison because the\
    \ winegrower wanted to stress vines\nat this phenological stage. Immediately before\
    \ veraison, the multiplier was set to 1.5 in\norder to recover vine water status.\
    \ During post-veraison, it progressively decreased from\n1.0 to 0.7. During post-harvest,\
    \ water status was recovered again by deﬁning a threshold of\n1.0. Based on these\
    \ values, the relative soil water content upper and lower limits were also\nadjusted\
    \ throughout the growing season (Figure 2b). All these curves were predeﬁned to\n\
    determine admissible bounds for the irrigation scheduling and to ensure that irrigation\n\
    inputs above those available for the campaign were not used.\nAt the beginning\
    \ of the growing season, the DSS considered an expected seasonal\ncurve of daily\
    \ fIPARd based on the values measured the previous year. As the season\nprogressed,\
    \ new observed values were obtained from remote sensing. The new values of\nestimated\
    \ fIPARd at the observation day were assimilated as the weighted average between\n\
    observed and expected values, where the weights were set at 0.9 and 0.1, respectively.\n\
    The expected values for the remaining part of the season were also modiﬁed. In\
    \ general,\nthe expected fIPARd values were re-scaled to ﬁt the new value with\
    \ the expected value.\nHowever, in early and late stages of the growing season,\
    \ when fIPARd was expected to\nundergo rapid variations with either shooting or\
    \ leaf fall, the time axis was modiﬁed to ﬁt\nthe new with the expected value.\n\
    With the conﬁguration set in these trials, the daily irrigation dose (did) (mm/day)\n\
    were calculated as:\ndid = iwu∗(ET0∗ (fKx ∗ fIPARd + Ke ) − effRain) + SPcorrection\n\
    (1)\nwhere iwu is the intended water unbalance speciﬁed in the seasonal plan,\
    \ ET0 is the refer-\nence evapotranspiration measured the previous day at a nearby\
    \ weather station (mm/day),\nfKx is an empirically adjusted coefﬁcient from feedback\
    \ by soil moisture sensors [22],\nfIPARd is the expected fIPARd for that day (%),\
    \ obtained from S2 fAPAR and upscaled\non a daily time step with Oyarzun’s model,\
    \ Ke is the coefﬁcient for soil evaporation [3]\ncalculated by the model, effRain\
    \ is the effective rain of the previous day (mm), obtained\nfrom pluviometer measurements\
    \ and recalculated by the model, and SPcorrection is the\nrequired addition or\

    \ in each representative point throughout the 2020 and 2021 grow-\ning seasons\
    \ every two weeks at noon with a pressure chamber (model 3005; Soil Moisture\n\
    Equipment Corp. Santa Barbara, CA, USA) following the protocol described by McCutchan\n\
    and Shackel [57]. Shaded leaves were wrapped in plastic bags covered with aluminum\
    \ foil\nat least one hour before Ψstem measurements. All measurements were taken\
    \ in less than\none hour with three leaves at each point, one in each single vine.\n\
    On the other hand, fIPAR was measured from 11:00 to 13:00 h (GMT+2) using a\n\
    portable ceptometer (AccuPAR Linear PAR, Decagon Devices, Inc., Pullman, WA, USA)\n\
    on the same dates as Ψstem. Incident PAR above and below vines was measured in\
    \ ﬁve\nvines in a row per point. Measurements were conducted in horizontal position\
    \ at ground\nlevel and perpendicular to vine row. In order to cover vine spacing,\
    \ ﬁve equally spaced\nmeasurements were determined in an open space adjacent to\
    \ each vine. Vine structural\nWater 2023, 15, 2506\n8 of 23\nparameters such as\
    \ height and canopy width perpendicular to the row were also measured\non each\
    \ occasion. These data were used to calculate fIPARd through the hourly Oyarzun\n\
    model [54] and further used to validate remote sensing fAPAR. The canopy porosity\n\
    parameter of Oyarzun’s model was adjusted so that the instantaneous measured value\
    \ of\nfIPAR agreed with the simulated value.\n2.5. Satellite Imagery and Biophysical\
    \ Variables\nMultispectral instruments on Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B satellites\
    \ provide high\nresolution multispectral shortwave observations of Earth’s surface\
    \ with a geometric revisit\ntime at the equator of 5 days [58]. S2 overpass through\
    \ the study site was between 10:36\nand 10:50 GTM. S2 images at level-2A were\
    \ downloaded for the study site from Copernicus\nOpen Access hub (https://scihub.copernicus.eu/\
    \ (last accessed on 15 November 2022))\nusing the Sentinelsat library (https://sentinelsat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\
    \ (last accessed\non 15 November 2022)). Biophysical variables of the vegetation\
    \ were estimated from the\nS2 biophysical processor [39] available in the SNAP\
    \ software v8.0 (https://step.esa.int/\nmain/download/snap-download/, last accessed\
    \ on 11 December 2021). This processor\nrelies on building a randomized dataset\
    \ of vegetation biophysical variables from which\nreﬂectance simulations by the\
    \ radiative transfer models (RTM) PROSPECT and SAIL are\nproduced [59]. Therefore,\
    \ instantaneous values of biophysical variables were obtained at\nthe time of\
    \ the satellite overpass for those days under clear sky conditions. In total,\
    \ 23 and\n22 S2 images were processed from April to October for 2020 and 2021,\
    \ respectively. fAPAR\nwas empirically regressed with both instantaneous and daily\
    \ modeled ﬁPAR (fIPARd).\nThen, each time a S2 image was available, fAPAR of each\
    \ irrigation sector was converted\nto fIPARd and assimilated into the digital\
    \ twin to calculate grapevine water requirements\n(Equation (1)). In addition,\
    \ the leaf area index (LAI) and the fractional vegetation cover\n(FVC) were used\
    \ to derive actual evapotranspiration with the TSEB-PT model.\n2.6. Actual and\
    \ Potential Evapotranspiration Using Copernicus-Based Inputs\nSentinel-3A and\
    \ Sentinel-3B images from the sea and land surface radiometer (SLSTR)\nwere downloaded\
    \ to obtain LST at 1 km resolution. In total, 99 and 111 cloud-free S3\nimages\
    \ were processed in 2020 and 2021 for the same period mentioned for S2. The\n\
    DMS approach [49] was used, combining S2 and S3 images to sharpen 1 km coarse\
    \ spa-\ntial resolution LST from S3 to 20 m. The methodology used is described\
    \ by Guzinski\net al. [50]. Meteorological inputs were obtained from the European\
    \ Center of Medium\nWeather Forecast (ECMWF) ERA5 reanalysis dataset [60].\nThis\
    \ dataset has a 30 km\ngrid and was used to run the TSEB-PT model.\nFor the current\
    \ study, the variables\nused were air temperature at 2 m, dew point temperature\
    \ at 2 m, wind speed at 100 m,\nsurface pressure and total column water vapor\
    \ (TCWV). In addition, aerosol optical\nthickness (AOT) at 550 m was obtained\
    \ from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring\nService (CAMS) since it is not included\
    \ in ERA5. Two ancillary sources of data were\nalso used: land cover maps from\
    \ the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) (https:\n//cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/satellite-land-cover?tab=overview,\
    \ last\naccessed on 10 October 2021) and the digital elevation model (DEM) of\
    \ the shuttle radar\ntopography mission (SRTM). In the study site, the C3S landcover\
    \ map, produced at 300 m\nresolution, did not vary from one year to another, and\
    \ so the one from 2017 was used for\nboth years. A look-up table of different\
    \ parameters associated to each crop class was set up\nin accordance with Guzinski\
    \ et al. [50].\nThe TSEB-PT modeling approach [61] estimates the energy ﬂuxes\
    \ of both soil and\ncanopy, separately based on a single bulk LST measurement\
    \ that initially assumes a maxi-\nmum potential rate of transpiration. This ﬁrst\
    \ guess, which usually starts with an alpha\ncoefﬁcient of 1.26, is sequentially\
    \ reduced until realistic ﬂuxes are obtained [62]. This\nmodel has been used to\
    \ derive land-surface energy ﬂuxes using Copernicus-based inputs\n(TSEB-PTS2+S3)\
    \ [50–53]. Further details on the TSEB model scheme can be found at the\nWater\
    \ 2023, 15, 2506\n9 of 23\nsource code (https://github.com/hectornieto/pyTSEB.,\
    \ last accessed on 22 April 2022) and\nthe original formulation of the model [42].\n\
    On the other hand, potential evapotranspiration (ETp), deﬁned as the water usage\
    \ (or\nevapotranspiration rate) of a well-watered crop was computed from the Penman–Monteith\n\
    model, assuming a maximum stomatal conductance [63,64]. ETp was therefore computed\n\
    using S2 LAI estimations and the same meteorological inputs as in the TSEB-PTS2+S3.\
    \ For\nboth cases, instantaneous energy ﬂuxes at the satellite overpass were upscaled\
    \ to daily\nwater ﬂuxes, expressed in units of mm/day, by multiplying the instantaneous\
    \ ratio of latent\nheat ﬂuxes over solar irradiance by the average daily solar\
    \ irradiance [65]. Gap ﬁlling was\napplied following the protocol described by\
    \ Jofre-Cekalovi´c et al. [53]. Both TSEB-PTS2+S3\nand the Penman–Monteith estimated\
    \ ET were intercompared with that modelled through\nthe digital twin by computing\
    \ their correlation as well as their root mean square deviation\n(RMSD =\nq\n\
    ∑ (xi−yi)2\nN\n). The RMSD is analogous to the root mean square error (RMSE),\
    \ but\ndenotes deviations between two independent estimates (x and y) rather than\
    \ the error from\none estimate to a reference measurement.\n3. Results and Discussion\n\
    3.1. Sentinel-2 fAPAR\nS2 fAPAR was compared with fIPAR under the hypothesis that\
    \ for green canopies the\nlatter is a good proxy of fAPAR. This assumption is\
    \ valid mostly during the non-senescence\nperiods of the growing season due to\
    \ the strong absorption capacity in this spectral domain\nof the photosynthetic\
    \ pigments [66] and the usually small background reﬂectivities for\nwell-developed\
    \ canopies [40,41,67]. A comparison of instantaneous S2 fAPAR with in\nsitu measurements\
    \ of fIPAR at the same time as the satellite overpassed showed an R2\nof 0.61\
    \ and 0.91 for irrigation sectors with 140◦ and 100◦ row orientation, respectively\n\
    (Figure 3a). These coefﬁcients of determination are quite promising and suggest\
    \ the\nsuitability of using S2 fAPAR in discontinuous canopies, particularly in\
    \ conditions without\ncover crop in the interrow. On the other hand, the existence\
    \ of cover crop in the interrow\ncould be a problem when estimating the biophysical\
    \ parameters of the canopy, especially\nwith the spatial resolutions provided\
    \ by the current open-source satellites. The RMSD,\nwhich ranged from 0.09 to\
    \ 0.10 indicated that this relationship did not signiﬁcantly vary\nbetween row\
    \ orientations. This deviation, however, may be explained by soil background\n\
    reﬂectance and diffuse illumination variations due to multiscattering or also\
    \ due to the\npoor representativeness of ﬁve vines within a 20 m pixel. Wojnowski\
    \ et al. [68] reported\nthat fIPAR is typically 6–9% higher than fAPAR. Despite\
    \ this, the deviation obtained is\ninsigniﬁcant for the purposes of this study.\n\

    \ relation-\nships between the stand structure, the sun’s position, and the length\
    \ of the shadow cast by\nthe trees. Some studies have indicated that the instantaneous\
    \ fAPAR value at 10:00 solar\ntime is very close to the daily integrated value\
    \ under clear sky conditions [69]. However, it\nwas found in this study that,\
    \ particularly in discontinuous woody crops planted in rows\nand sometimes with\
    \ different training systems, this is not always the case and that it varies\n\
    with row orientation. Figure 4 shows the diurnal trends of hourly modelled fIPAR\
    \ in each\nirrigation sector and the estimated instantaneous S2 fAPAR for 2020\
    \ and 2021. Each line\ncorresponds to a different date. Results indicate that\

    \ throughout the day than C. As rows of A and B\nare closest to an N-S orientation,\
    \ the model follows an expected hourly symmetrical path\nwith respect to near\
    \ solar noon with higher fractional interception in the early morning and\nlate\

    \ of\nirrigation sector C (100◦ row orientation) was more constant throughout\

    \ and therefore fAPAR estimates,\ncoincide with the minimum daily values of fIPAR\
    \ for rows oriented at 140◦ (Figure 4a,b).\nThe same agreement was observed for\

    \ fIPAR at the time of satellite overpass. A possible explanation, which needs\n\
    to be corroborated in further studies, may be related to a higher soil background\

    \ 5a). Overall, fAPAR in 2020 was higher than in 2021. This is explained by a\

    \ Although some studies have recommended\ninstalling sensors at different depths\

    sensors, the recommended sensor locations can be a combination of sensors close\
    \ to the\nvertical of the dripper and other sensors midway between neighboring\
    \ drippers, at 30 cm\ndepth. In our study, we positioned the soil moisture sensors\
    \ following this recommendation.\nIt can be observed in the soil moisture data\
    \ corresponding to 2020 that the winegrower\ndid not irrigate in any sector from\
    \ fruit-set to veraison (Figure 7a,c,e). As a consequence,\nsoil moisture decreased.\
    \ Irrigation events occurred again during post-veraison in order\nto recover vine\
    \ water status. Comparing this strategy with Ψstem values measured in\neach irrigation\
    \ sector, it can be observed that the winegrower was able to stress vines\nduring\
    \ pre-veraison to Ψstem values of −1.1 MPa (Figure 8). However, although the vines\n\
    recovered slightly at veraison, the Ψstem values subsequently dropped again until\
    \ harvest.\nThis suggests that despite applying large amounts of water during\
    \ post-veraison, this was\nnevertheless insufﬁcient to recover vine water status\
    \ until the end of the growing season. A\ndifferent irrigation strategy was conducted\
    \ in 2021, following the seasonal plan predeﬁned\nand based on intentional water\
    \ balance deviation and a range of cumulative irrigation\nthresholds (Figure 2a).\
    \ Soil moisture sensors indicated high soil moisture values for all\nirrigation\
    \ sectors at the beginning of the growing season due to spring precipitations\
    \ and\nthe ﬁrst irrigation events during May. These large amounts of applied irrigation\
    \ water were\nhigher than the predeﬁned cumulative irrigation thresholds, so irrigation\
    \ was automatically\nstopped for some dates (Figure 6). This fact also coincided\
    \ with the lowest multiplier of\nwater needs (0.6) during fruit-set, which was\
    \ maintained throughout the month of June.\nConsequently, the seasonal plan deﬁned\
    \ in the DSS comprised starting vine water status\nrecovery from early July in\
    \ order to reach veraison with vines transpiring at near potential\nrates. Accordingly,\
    \ the DSS started triggering irrigation again by the end of June. Irrigation\n\
    in sector C started, however, some days before A and B because soil water moisture\
    \ in C\nwas lower. Despite these ﬁrst irrigation events at the end of June, Ψstem\
    \ values continued\nfalling for some days (Figure 8). An improvement in Ψstem\
    \ was only observed in sector\nB on one measurement day, but the values fell again\
    \ on the next measurement day. The\nminimum Ψstem value of −1.2 MPa for irrigation\
    \ sectors A and B was reached on 8 July\nWater 2023, 15, 2506\n13 of 23\n2021,\
    \ while for irrigation sector C lower values were reached and lasted longer. This\n\
    can be explained as the result of the soil depth in C being lower and, therefore,\
    \ also the\navailable soil water content explored by the rooting system. Because\
    \ the relative soil water\ncontent was below the pre-established thresholds only\
    \ a few days before veraison, the DSS\nautomatically prescribed more water. It\
    \ can be observed how, after these irrigation events,\nthe trend in daily minimum\
    \ values of soil moisture increased a few days before veraison\nin A and B but\
    \ not as much in C (Figure 7b,d,f). It was at veraison, and after large water\n\
    irrigation amounts, that soil moisture in C reached values close to ﬁeld capacity\
    \ (Figure 7f).\nFigure 9 also shows how Ψstem in A and B recovered earlier than\
    \ in C at veraison. During\npost-veraison, the irrigation strategy consisted of\

    \ Comparison of Digital Twin Simulations of ET with Values Estimated with Remote\

    \ or sap ﬂow sensors\nto validate the simulations of evapotranspiration or the\
    \ plant water status made through\nthe digital twin in each of the irrigation\
    \ sectors of the vineyard. Instead, we used stem\nwater potential (Ψstem) as an\
    \ indicator of plant water status and compared ET simulations\nwith the values\
    \ estimated through remote sensing using SEB modelling approaches.\nThe crop water\
    \ stress index (CWSI) [56] was correlated with Ψstem (Figure 10). By\nusing the\
    \ empirical equation, it is possible to obtain the thresholds of Ψstem for a CWSI\n\
    of zero and one, which, respectively, corresponded to −0.51 MPa and −2.3 MPa.\
    \ These\nthresholds seem reasonable and concur with those reported in similar\
    \ studies [76].\nA previous step to compare ET between different approaches was\
    \ to discard the pos-\nsibility of the use of meteorological data from different\
    \ sources affecting ET estimations.\nFigure 11a shows how the daily reference\
    \ ET0 obtained from ERA5 correlated with that\nobtained from the closest weather\
    \ station to the vineyard. The RMSD was 0.54 mm/day,\nthus ruling out the inﬂuence\
    \ of meteorological data on the error metrics observed in ETa\nand ETp estimates.\
    \ The regression between modelled and estimated ETa using two years\nof data showed\
    \ an RMSD of 0.98 mm/day (Figure 11b) with a coefﬁcient of regression of\n0.45.\
    \ The R2 and RMSD for ETp were 0.67 and 1.14 mm/day, respectively (Figure 11c).\n\
    Water 2023, 15, 2506\n16 of 23\nAn ANOVA analysis was conducted to assess differences\
    \ in the RMSD of both ETa and\nETp between years and irrigation sectors, but the\
    \ results were not statistically signiﬁcant.\nAlthough numerous studies have demonstrated\
    \ the potential of using TSEB-PT to mon-\nitor ETa, very few have validated the\
    \ TSEB-PT using Copernicus-based inputs. Studies\nvalidated with ﬂux towers concluded\
    \ that the RMSE of instantaneous heat ﬂux was ap-\nproximately 30% in agricultural\
    \ areas [50,53]. Guzinski et al. [51] also obtained an RMSE\nof 0.96 mm/day when\
    \ validation was performed for multiple crops together, including\nirrigated and\
    \ rainfed. In addition, it is known from previous studies that TSEB-PT is quite\n\
    sensitive to a correct determination of canopy structure/roughness [51,77]. Therefore,\
    \ any\nerror in the parameters assigned in the lookup table associated to land\
    \ cover maps or in\nthe estimates of biophysical variables could yield larger\
    \ uncertainties in ETa estimates\nwith the TSEB-PTS2+S3 approach. Another source\
    \ of bias could be the inability of the DMS\napproach to capture precise values\
    \ of LST when crops are under short-term water stress\nand there is no evidence\
    \ of a decrease in biomass [52,53]. Therefore, since the vineyard\nof this study\
    \ was under water stress for some periods, it cannot be ruled out that ETa\nestimates\
    \ with the TSEB-PTS2+S3 approach were overestimated for some dates in compar-\n\
    ison to the simulation with the SWB approach. This hypothesis is further validated\
    \ in a\nsmall part of the vineyard where short water stress cycles were adopted\
    \ and vine water\nstatus monitored throughout the growing season (Figure 12).\
    \ Figure 11 also shows that\nboth remotely sensed ETa and ETp were underestimated\
    \ for many dates. This could be\nattributable to the different methodologies used\
    \ to assimilate the biophysical parameters.\nThe remote sensing SEB approach uses\
    \ instantaneous estimates of S2 LAI as an input in\norder to iteratively derive\
    \ fIPAR through the Campbell and Norman technique [78]. This is\nthen used to\
    \ derive instantaneous energy ﬂuxes, which are later upscaled to daily ﬂuxes\n\
    considering the average daily solar irradiance [65]. In contrast, the SWB approach\
    \ used\nby the irrigation DSS assimilates fIPARd, which was derived from S2 fAPAR\
    \ and upscaled\nto a daily time step through Oyarzun’s model. Because this hypothesis\
    \ is speculative,\nfurther studies should be conducted in order to validate the\

    \ \nIn this study, we did not have the opportunity to install a flux tower or\
    \ sap flow \nsensors to validate the simulations of evapotranspiration or the\
    \ plant water status made \nthrough the digital twin in each of the irrigation\
    \ sectors of the vineyard. Instead, we used \nstem water potential (Ψstem) as\
    \ an indicator of plant water status and compared ET simu-\nlations with the values\
    \ estimated through remote sensing using SEB modelling ap-\nproaches. \nThe crop\
    \ water stress index (CWSI) [56] was correlated with Ψstem (Figure 10). By \n\
    using the empirical equation, it is possible to obtain the thresholds of Ψstem\
    \ for a CWSI of \nzero and one, which, respectively, corresponded to −0.51 MPa\
    \ and −2.3 MPa. These thresh-\nolds seem reasonable and concur with those reported\
    \ in similar studies [76]. \n \nFigure 10. Regression between measured midday\

    −1.46 and −1.60 MPa for 2020 and 2021, respectively. Both ETa and ETp followed\
    \ the same\ntrend throughout both growing seasons, with higher rates in 2020 than\
    \ in 2021 due to the\nhigher vegetative growth in the ﬁrst year. The R2 and RMSD\
    \ between the digital twin\nsimulations and remotely sensed estimates of ETp and\
    \ ETa, were, respectively, 0.60 and\n0.93 mm/day and 0.29 and 1.13 mm/day. For\
    \ ETp, the regression seems reasonable and\nthe deviation was mostly due to an\
    \ underestimation in remotely sensed ETp. The possible\nreason for this has previously\
    \ described in this paper. On the other hand, this analysis\nconﬁrms the hypothesis\
    \ that the TSEB-PTS2+S3 tends to overestimate evapotranspiration\nwhen water stress\
    \ occurs for short periods of time. This can be observed in the periods\nwhen\
    \ Ψstem values were more negative. In those periods, while simulated ETa decreases,\n\
    the ETa TSEB-PTS2+S3 remains high with values close to ETp. The cause of this\
    \ is based on\nthe inability of the DMS approach to capture the full range of\
    \ surface temperatures [52].\nSince sharpened LST was obtained from machine learning\
    \ algorithms which relate S3 LST\nwith S2 shortwave bands at coarse resolutions,\
    \ it is probable that differences in sharpened\nLST can mainly be attributed to\
    \ differences in vegetative growth variables, but not when\nshort-term water stress\
    \ occurs and the amount of biomass is not reduced [53].\n4. Conclusions and Perspective\n\
    This study tested the feasibility of scheduling irrigation through an automated\
    \ soil\nwater balance (SWB) approach ﬁne-tuned with capacitance-type soil moisture\
    \ sensors\nand pre-deﬁned irrigation amount thresholds. Results show that estimates\
    \ of grapevine\nfAPAR from Sentinel-2 had a RMSD of 0.10 in comparison with in\
    \ situ measurements of\ninstantaneous fIPAR, independently of row orientation.\
    \ Modelled fIPARd was between\n13% and 21% higher than instantaneous S2 fAPAR,\
    \ and dependent on row orientation.\nVineyards with rows oriented close to 140◦\
    \ had a higher fIPARd than those oriented at 100◦.\nThis suggests that crop growth\
    \ models that need a daily time step of light interception\nas an input and intend\
    \ to assimilate remote sensing estimates of biophysical variables\nshould consider\
    \ that S2 fAPAR corresponds to instantaneous values. Therefore, models\nsuch as\
    \ Oyarzun’s can be a successful alternative to upscale from instantaneous to daytime\n\
    scale, and considering row orientation. Using the DSS in 2021, this study demonstrated\n\
    the feasibility of calculating vine water requirements and the automated scheduling\
    \ of\nirrigation by assimilating in near real time estimates of fIPARd.\nThe DSS\
    \ also demonstrated its suitability to automatically carry out an RDI strategy\
    \ by\napplying different amounts of water in different irrigation sectors. Simulations\
    \ of soil water\nbalance components through the digital twin seem to perform well.\
    \ For instance, differences\nin both simulated ETa and ETp were observed between\
    \ years, attributable to higher vine\nvegetative growth in 2020 than in 2021.\
    \ In addition, simulated Ta decreased up to 49% in\ncomparison to Tp when water\
    \ stress was adopted following an RDI strategy, and simulated\nCWSI (as 1 − Ta/Tp)\
    \ was correlated with Ψstem. Simulations of ETa and ETp showed RMSD\nvalues of\
    \ 0.98 and 1.14 mm/day, respectively, when compared with estimations obtained\n\
    from remote sensing surface energy balance models. To obtain accurate spatio-temporal\n\
    estimations of crop water status in water stress conditions continues to be an\
    \ enormous\nchallenge. Although this study demonstrates the capacity of the digital\
    \ twin to obtain\naccurate simulations of vine water status under different levels\
    \ of water stress, and to\nschedule the irrigation of individual irrigation sectors\
    \ on this assumption, it is important\nto highlight that these simulations were\
    \ obtained using soil moisture sensor data from a\nsingle representative vine.\
    \ This study shows, once again, the current difﬁculty in estimating\nand monitoring\
    \ water stress in heterogeneous row crops using satellite remote sensing\napproaches\
    \ due to the lack of a high spatio-temporal resolution thermal sensor. Some\n\
    Water 2023, 15, 2506\n19 of 23\nstudies have validated the TSEB-PTS2+S3 approach\
    \ in multiple crops, obtaining an averaged\nRMSE of 0.96 mm/day [51]. However,\
    \ the water stress cycles experiment conducted in\nthis study shows that when\
    \ vines were under short periods of water stress and there was\nno evidence of\
    \ a decrease in biomass, the disaggregation methodology used to downscale\nland\
    \ surface temperature (LST) was not able to estimate high values of LST and therefore\n\
    ETa was overestimated in comparison with the SWB-simulated ETa.\nAuthor Contributions:\

  limitations: 'The paper acknowledges some limitations, including:


    - Limited scope to a single vineyard and specific grape variety, which may limit
    the generalizability of the findings.

    - Potential uncertainties in remote sensing estimates of evapotranspiration, particularly
    under conditions of short-term water stress and no evidence of biomass reduction.

    - The study did not have the opportunity to install a flux tower or sap flow sensors
    to validate the simulations of evapotranspiration or the plant water status made
    through the digital twin in each of the irrigation sectors of the vineyard. Instead,
    stem water potential (Ψstem) was used as an indicator of plant water status and
    compared ET simulations with the values estimated through remote sensing using
    SEB modelling approaches. This may introduce some uncertainty in the validation
    of the digital twin simulations.'

    \ \nEmail: abhikhanna@hotmail.com \n \n \n \n  Abstract \nAgriculture plays an\
    \ imperative role in the financial development of a country \nand provides the\
    \ main source of income, food, employment specifically to the \nrural sector.\
    \ In India, around 80% of the population is dependent upon agricul-\nture as it\
    \ is the primary source of income. Farmers make use of water for irriga-\ntion\
    \ purpose and do not estimate its precise requirement. However, in reality, the\
    \ \nrequirement of water content is comparatively much lower than the one that\
    \ is \nutilized. The irrigation system across the world can be more efficient\
    \ if incorpo-\nration of automated systems is introduced, in order to estimate\
    \ the precise \namount of water requirement among fields. Hence, in order to overcome\
    \ the \nconcern of making minimal use of water for irrigation, Agro Based Decision\
    \ \nSupport System (AbDSS) has been proposed in the article. The proposed frame-\n\
    work is proficient enough to help farmers correctly identify the precise need\
    \ for \nwater by their respective farms. The framework incorporates various agricultural\
    \ \nsensors, i.e., soil moisture sensor, soil temperature sensor, and soil humidity\
    \ \nsensor along with a computational cloud server, i.e., ThingSpeak. The proposed\
    \ \nframework not only provides remote access for obtaining current farm parame-\n\
    ters without being physically present at the site, reduces much of human energy,\
    \ \nand results in increased efficiency. In addition, the water supply can be\
    \ con-\ntrolled remotely using the interface by making use of an electric valve\
    \ and a re-\nlay installed on the nozzle. \n \nKeywords \nSoil moisture, Soil\

    \ Networks \n \n1. Introduction \nWater is considered to be the most valuable\
    \ resource in the world; however, its demand is always in an increasing \nphase\
    \ across the world. It is considered important aspect of every possible means.\
    \ It has been estimated that the amount \nof water sufficient to irrigate one\
    \ hectare of the rice crop is the same that would cover the needs of 100 nomads\
    \ with \n450 heads of cattle over three years or 100 urban families over a two-year\
    \ period [1]. Over the past few years, scarcity \nissues related to drought have\
    \ been majorly prevalent. In agriculture, water is required in large quantities.\
    \ Over and \nabove the consumption of water for irrigation is one of the major\
    \ problems under this domain. Although, there have \nbeen numerous techniques\
    \ proposed by various researchers and academicians over the past few years to\
    \ make minimal \nAbhishek Khanna \n \n \nDOI: 10.26855/ijfsa.2020.09.001 \n220\
    \ \nInternational Journal of Food Science and Agriculture \n \nuse of water. All\
    \ the proposed techniques to control or save water’s dissipation are either too\
    \ expansive or beyond the \nconceptual knowledge of farmers. This dissipation\
    \ problem not only causes water wastage but also becomes the root \ncause of the\
    \ destruction of crops. The main sources of water for irrigation in Punjab are\
    \ tube wells [2]. Apart from tube \nwells, canal water is also a prime source\
    \ for irrigation. Even the groundwater level is going down very fast and it bears\
    \ \nnumerous side effects to soil health and to crops [3]. Hence, there is a dire\
    \ need to develop an intelligent irrigation sys-\ntem to save water. \nNumerous\
    \ research articles over the years have proposed the usage of automatic irrigation\
    \ systems. All the research \narticles have opted for different techniques to\
    \ determine the existing condition of the soil. Based on observations, the \n\
    precise amount of water required by the soil is determined [4-7]. In addition,\
    \ the technology for the creation of networks \nbetween the sensors and the design\
    \ of the control system was also highly debated by various experts [8], [9-12].\
    \ Apart \nfrom these techniques being expansive and beyond the knowledge of novice\
    \ farmers, there are certainly other issues as \nwell that are associated with\
    \ the process of soil monitoring process, i.e., calibration, variability, and\
    \ patchiness of rain-\nfall water, etc. [13], [14]. In addition, excess usage\
    \ of water has adverse effects on soil. Some of the adverse effects of \nexcessive\
    \ usage of water on soil include: \n1) It inhibits the process of germination\
    \ of seeds; \n2) Roots do not grow properly in a waterlogged field; \n3) Percentage\
    \ of salinity increases in soil, due to the presence of salt in water; \n4) Waterlogging\
    \ with the field; \n5) Hindrance in air communication for the plant’s roots; \n\
    6) Reduction in soil temperature; \n7) The shallowness of roots; \n8) Land becomes\
    \ marshy; \n9) De-nitrogenization starts within the soil; \n10) Shortage of soil\
    \ nutritive elements and decrease in productivity. \nIn order to overcome the\
    \ above-mentioned issues and to help novice farmers, there is a dire need of an\

    \ easy \nenough to operate and handle. \n2. Contribution to the research article\
    \ \nIn this paper, the most economical and cost-effective sensors have been incorporated\
    \ for making observations. Fur-\nthermore, their advantages and disadvantages\
    \ have been discussed by length. The system also makes use of external \nparameters\
    \ for examining weather conditions, i.e., referring www.openweathermap.com for\
    \ estimating precise weather \nconditions for the observed area [15]. Based on\
    \ evaluations on various parameters, the process decision making comes \nunderway\
    \ with an aim to precisely irrigate the fields. \n2.1. Literature review \nEnvironment\
    \ and its surrounds play an important role in the nourishment of any crop. The\
    \ main factors that affect an \nagricultural zone are its soil properties, their\
    \ ability to absorb and procure water within the soil, presence of moisture \n\
    within the soil, humidity within the environment, soil temperature, the pH level\
    \ of water, etc. Over the years, there have \nbeen numerous researches done on\
    \ the above-said parameters to have firsthand information regarding various aspects\
    \ \nassociated to soil and later as per observation; evaluations are performed\
    \ to undertake various agricultural activities. \nVarious eminent researchers\
    \ did some of the major contributions over the years are as under: \nHamad in\
    \ his study highlighted the role of usage of smartphones for accessing agricultural\
    \ information on various \nparameters and its advantages in the field of agriculture.\
    \ 230 farmers across the region were interviewed and primary \nstructured questionnaires\
    \ were filled. The study highlighted that most of the farmers suggested the usage\
    \ of smart-\nphones for acquiring data on current farm conditions and relied on\
    \ adopting newer agricultural techniques depicted on \nvideos available in the\
    \ field of PA [16]. \nBalducci in his study aimed at managing heterogeneous data\
    \ coming from various datasets by virtue of sensory values. \nThe study also depicts\
    \ how productive companies (large scale or small scale, public or private) are\
    \ in a race of increasing \nprofitability by virtue of costs reduction, discovering\
    \ appropriate ways to exploit data that are continuously recorded and \nmade available\
    \ can be the right choice to achieve subjective goals. The study suggested the\
    \ usage of Neural network, \nLinear and Polynomial Regression Machine Learning\
    \ models for decision-making and data handling [17]. \nDuhan emphasized on issues\
    \ related to the perspective of the green revolution that resulted in blind usage\
    \ of pesti-\ncides and chemical fertilizers that caused enormous loss to soil\
    \ biodiversity and developed resistance against pathogens \nand pests in addition.\

    \ helps in slow and sustained release of nutrients and agrochemicals resulting\
    \ in precise dosage \namong plants. Furthermore, the study also proposed the usage\
    \ of Nanotechnology-based plant viral disease detection \nkits that proved to\
    \ be very useful in speedy and early in the detection of viral diseases. The study\
    \ highlighted a detailed \nexplanation of the most commonly used Biosynthesis\
    \ of nanoparticles and their vital use in the field of agriculture. \nFurthermore,\
    \ the study depicted how the coated fertilizers could prove to be advantageous\
    \ in resolving issues related to \n102 soil microflora [18]. \nSeverino in their\
    \ study focused on impact of climate change in the field of agriculture. Furthermore,\
    \ the authors hig-\nhlighted the irregular use of water for irrigation purposes.\
    \ Hence, an IoT based framework was proposed in the study to \nassess and control\
    \ the environmental risks associated with the use of recycled water(s). The framework\
    \ was designed \nhad an autonomous network of sensors that collect data pertaining\
    \ to soil moisture and the concentration of dissolved \ncontaminants. The acquired\
    \ data were used to assess the viability of water for irrigation by making use\
    \ of drip irrigation \ntechnique for irrigating the root of the plants along with\
    \ various other autonomous sensors by optimization of the irriga-\ntion scheduling.\
    \ The main drawbacks were the proposed framework was site-specific and expensive,\
    \ recycled water was \nused for irrigating the fields and water dynamics varied\
    \ from location to location. Authors emphasized on the proper \nprocessing of\
    \ the soil data within respective fields before incorporating the proposed framework\
    \ [19]. \nTuomisto in their study highlighted the shortcomings of environmental\
    \ change, agricultural yields, and crop quality, \nand the critical pathways to\
    \ future diets and health outcomes. Furthermore, the study depicts no quantitative\
    \ models to \ntest the impact of multiple environmental changes on nutrition and\
    \ health outcomes. Hence, the authors proposed a \nframework that linked multiple\
    \ interactions between environmental change, agricultural productivity and crop\
    \ quality, \npopulation-level food availability, dietary intake, and health outcomes,\
    \ with a prime focus on fruits and vegetables. The \nproposed framework focused\
    \ on issues related to Socio-economic and societal factors, Environmental change\
    \ stressors, \nInterventions and policies, Food system activities, Food and nutrition\
    \ security and health and well-being outcomes. The \nstudy also visualized the\
    \ problems that might be encountered while the adaptation of proposed framework\
    \ among poor \nfarmers [20]. \nHellin highlighted the significant importance of\
    \ water in the southeast area of Spain, in terms of its availability and \ncost.\
    \ Hence, with respect to usage of water within the fields for performing various\
    \ agricultural activities an Information \nand Communication Technologies (ICT)\
    \ based framework has been proposed in the study that makes use of wireless \n\
    nodes equipped that are powered by solar energy along with GPRS connectivity allowing\
    \ its end-user (farmer) to ana-\nlyze the information acquired through various\
    \ agricultural sensors deployed within the fields for performing computa-\ntions.\
    \ The main aim was to generate maximum yield profits. The research article shed\
    \ light on design, optimization, and \ndevelopment of a practical application\
    \ to optimize water resources in irrigated agriculture by monitoring soil water\
    \ sta-\ntus and the irrigation water [21]. \nOjha’s study depicted the significant\
    \ importance of wireless sensor, devices and various other communication tech-\n\
    niques that spurred newer directions of research in the field of agriculture.\
    \ The study highlighted the potential use of \nWSN applications along with various\
    \ challenges and issues associated with the deployment of agricultural sensors\
    \ and \ndevices for improved farming. Furthermore, designs of various WSN for\
    \ agricultural applications were examined. A \ncomparative analysis between Homogeneous\
    \ and Heterogeneous architectures has been discussed in the research article.\
    \ \nEmphasis was given on the usage of System on Chip (SoC) sensor nodes that\
    \ target minimization of power consump-\ntion, cost, and easily deployable design.\
    \ The research article also hosts the concept of identification of plant disease\
    \ on \nfour different parameters, i.e., Thrips, Rust, Bud Necrosis Virus (BNV)\
    \ and Leaf Spot. However, the experimentation \nperformed was on uni-seasonal\
    \ climatic conditions. The authors further suggested more scope of simplification\
    \ for ex-\nisting frameworks [22]. \nRameshaiah in their study explored the horizon\
    \ of various kinds of fertilizers developed and acquaint with facts about \nthe\
    \ sensors in the same fields. The concept of Nano-technology was discussed in\
    \ the study by length. The article aims to \nimprove the ecosystem and help the\
    \ farmers by using new-age technologies. It also aims to further benefit the agricul-\n\
    tural engineering and technology in overcoming all the local myths and ethics\
    \ decreasing the mega problems in the \nagriculture arena. However, the precise\
    \ accuracy, natural reactions, effectiveness and cost for operation are some of\
    \ the \nparameters that have not been discussed by a length in this article [23].\
    \ \nSoulis in his study highlighted the paramount importance of sensor’s positioning\
    \ within the field along with the ac-\ncurate reading procedure and also emphasized\
    \ on obtaining on accurate readings from various agricultural sensors based \n\
    on precise deployment of sensors within the fields. The study made use of drip\
    \ irrigation technique for irrigating the \nfields based on an existing mathematical\
    \ model. The model evaluated the moisture readings gathered by various agri-\n\
    cultural sensors and provided a decision regarding the precise amount of water\
    \ required for irrigation. Lastly, the study \nalso highlighted the ability of\
    \ to the acquired mathematical model to serve a proactive tool for determining\
    \ a detail in-\nvestigation for various sensors and their positioning within the\
    \ fields with an aim to attain an automated irrigation \nscheduling mechanism\
    \ [24]. \nLekshmi’s research article emphasized in the paramount importance of\
    \ evaluating the presence of soil moisture and \nAbhishek Khanna \n \n \nDOI:\

    \ Agriculture \n \nother related parameters, i.e., agronomic, geological, ecological,\
    \ biological and hydrological characteristics of the soil. \nThe study focuses\
    \ on evaluating the various techniques used for making observations that core\
    \ influence during the cul-\ntivation process. Various soil moisture parameters\
    \ have been categorized into three different levels based on various \nparameters.\
    \ A major shortcoming in the research article is that the study is zone-specific\
    \ and the influence of five other \nparameters like soil temperature, humidity,\
    \ etc., have not been given adequate weight [25]. \nMittelbach in their research\
    \ article experimented with foremost common soil sensors, i.e., 10HS manufactured\
    \ by \nDecagon Devices, United States, CS616 manufactured by Campbell Scientific,\
    \ United States, SISOMOP manufactured \nby SMG University of Karlsruhe, Germany\
    \ and TDR based TRIME-IT/-EZ manufactured by IMKO GmbH, Germany. \nAll four sensors\
    \ used for generating inputs related to various soil parameters. Later these values\
    \ were compared widely \nto predict the soil behavior to make observations and\
    \ then to take pro-active measures for minimal use of water for irri-\ngation.\
    \ The main aspect of the study was to assess the possibility of extension and\
    \ calibration of all the sensors to have a \nprecise idea regarding the behavior\
    \ of soil under various environmental conditions. Furthermore, for each sensor,\
    \ an \nactual evapotranspiration technique was used by applying and estimating\
    \ a proper soil-water balance approach. The \nresults were evaluated by comparing\
    \ with a precise measurement value of a weighing lysimeter. The results obtained\
    \ \nresults were evaluated on Root Mean Square Difference (RMSD) and on Volumetric\
    \ Water Content (VWC) and its \nanomalies. Lastly, the research article highlighted\
    \ some major weaknesses of low-cost sensors, as the study suggested \nthat low-cost\
    \ sensors lacked sensitivity in certain soil moisture regimes. Moreover, the study\
    \ stated that the low cost \nsensors were spurious and intrinsic to some type\
    \ of instruments [26]. \nZhang et al. proposed an evaluation of soil moisture\
    \ content currently available on the testbed, to estimate the amount \nof water\
    \ required for irrigating the fields, on the basis of readings made by captive\
    \ soil moisture sensors. Furthermore, \nEC-5 sensor was used in the study for\
    \ observing in order to acquire precise observations and to find the combined\
    \ effect \nof soil temperature and salinity using Least Support Vector Machines\
    \ on Matlab (LS-SVMlab) as the primary tool. \nThrough experimentation, the authors\
    \ effectively reduced the impact of soil temperature and salinity on the single\
    \ sen-\nsor by determining the information-sharing range. Moreover, the detection\
    \ precision and costs under different informa-\ntion-sharing radius. As a result,\
    \ the proposed framework completely successfully calibrate the influence of soil\
    \ temper-\nature and salinity on sensors within multi-point network and provided\
    \ an efficacious approach to determine the balance \nbetween the calibration accuracy\
    \ of moisture sensor and the investment of agricultural production [27]. \nXia\
    \ proposed a revolutionary method in the field of precision agriculture by deploying\
    \ various agricultural sensors \nfor making experimentations within a red berry\
    \ greenhouse. The proposed framework collected values pertaining to \ntemperature,\
    \ illumination, humidity, voltage and other parameters from the testbed, in order\
    \ to perform evaluations. \nTransmission of observations was done to the remote\
    \ location on a real-time basis. The proposed system also included a \nweb platform\
    \ that was integrated with Google Maps to notify the greenhouse (testbed) prevalent\
    \ environmental status. \nThe proposed framework also generated an alarming voice\
    \ message along with an SMS alarm service. The warning \nmessages were routed\
    \ to from the proposed framework to farmer’s registered mobile phone as a precautionary\
    \ measure. \nAlthough the experimentation was low-cost, had scalability and provided\
    \ real-time, stable and accurate service, the ex-\nperimentation was only feasible\
    \ to compare within a closed environment [28]. \nVellidis in his study proposed\
    \ real-time soil moisture and temperature measuring through sensors. The framework\
    \ for \ninitiating self-irrigation technique within cotton fields, therefore,\
    \ used the observations. The entire process provided a \nclosed-loop irrigation\
    \ system where inputs from the smart sensor array determined timing and amount\
    \ of water required \nfor real-time site-specific irrigation applications, without\
    \ human intervention [29]. \nWang presented an overview of the most recent developments\
    \ in various technologies and standards of various wire-\nless sensors and their\
    \ communications techniques. Various applications pertaining to wireless sensors,\
    \ their networks \nand food production, i.e., Environmental monitoring, Weather\
    \ monitoring, Machine-to-Machine (M2M) based process \ncontrol, Facility Automation,\
    \ and Traceability systems have been discussed in detail. The research article\
    \ also high-\nlights some of the most common shortcomings in the field of agriculture.\
    \ Most important of them were the standardiza-\ntions in the field of agriculture\
    \ are still not up to the mark, early adopters of newer concepts are still facing\
    \ issues in \nimplementation, and Massive data generated by various agricultural\
    \ sensors (wired/wireless), and have the potential to \noverwhelm all the existing\
    \ issues. However, no proper actions are undertaken to take advantage of all their\
    \ potentials, \nExisting Information Technology (IT) infrastructure, predominately\
    \ wired communication structures, are simply not \ndesigned for pervasive inputs\
    \ and require a significant overhaul. They make the existing system look more\
    \ complex, \nCompatibility with legacy systems is not completely addressed. As\
    \ a result, many existing users avoid the adoption of \nwireless products, Security,\
    \ cost, complexity, lack of expertise, reliability on the wireless framework,\
    \ etc., were some of \nthe major concerns in the field of agriculture. The study\
    \ also stated that the field of agriculture is yet to attain the status \nof “calm\
    \ technology” [30]. \nAs studied in this section, agricultural sensors play a\
    \ vital role in this domain. Majority of research articles discussed \nin literature\
    \ survey scale heights by virtue of the sensors. The next section highlights the\

    \ observations. Either observations once recorded by the sensors can be stored\
    \ on a data log-\nger or they can be transmitted to the base station with the\
    \ help of any communication device, either for storage or for \nanalysis purpose.\
    \ Apart from sensors, actuators are also deployed within the fields. Actuators\
    \ are mechanical or elec-\ntro-mechanical devices that provide either controlled\
    \ or sometimes limited movements or positioning, which can be \noperated electrically,\
    \ manually or by various fluids such as air, hydraulic, etc. Some of the various\

    \ \n5) Manual Linear; \n6) Manual Rotary. \nBased on the various parameters, three\

    \ \nthe basic needs to accomplish the objectives laid down for the experimentation\
    \ purpose: Based on literature survey, it \nhas been streamlined that it is very\
    \ much essential to observe and evaluate the most common parameters associated\
    \ with \nagriculture, i.e., soil moisture, soil humidity, soil temperature, etc.\

    \ the yields \nand quality of the crop can be improved by the management of soil\
    \ moisture during critical plant growth stages. This \nsensor is capable of estimating\
    \ a precise reading between 0 to 45% of volumetric water content in soil and consumes\
    \ a \ntotal power of 3 mA @ 5 VDC, whereas the operating temperature is between\
    \ -40oC to +60oC. Figure 1 depicts the pic-\ntorial representation of 5V - DC\

    \ experimentation setup, data acquisition, and analysis \nThe state of Punjab\
    \ has been divided into three major regions, i.e., Majha, Doaba, and Malwa. As\
    \ per reports of \nEconomic and Statistical Organization, Govt. of Punjab, the\
    \ water level in the state has drastically gone down over the \npast few years\
    \ in all the three regions of the state [35]. Keeping in mind the existing standings\

    \ the Majha region of Punjab, i.e., Patiala, is 12% below the required level,\
    \ \nhence satisfying the basic objective of the study. All the experimental setup\
    \ has been deployed on a kitchen garden and \nthe experimentations were performed\
    \ on cucumber vegetable in mind. Five random soil samples weighing 250 grams \n\
    each were taken from various locations across the testbed, i.e., from all four\
    \ corners and the center of the testbed for \nidentification of soil’s health\
    \ status and also identify the type of soil so as to predict its behavior. As\
    \ per the reports ob-\ntained, the soil turned out to be loamy in nature, which\
    \ was ideal for agricultural use, i.e., it had a perfect combination \nAbhishek\

    \ 22%, respectively. In parallel, a verbal survey was also conducted through \n\
    interaction mode with the farmers regarding the techniques adopted by them for\
    \ irrigating the fields having the same \ncultivation as of testbed. \nIt was\
    \ observed that the local farmers were a novice to the modern concepts of IoT\
    \ based farming techniques and \nused generic practice for irrigating the fields,\
    \ i.e., flood fill technique. According to farmers, for water-intensified crops\
    \ \nlike paddy, sugarcane, cucumber, etc., flood irrigation technique was adopted\
    \ at least 2-3 times a day/acre. The area \nroughly required 20,000-22,000 liters\
    \ of water consumption. However, as per farmers under slightly moist conditions\
    \ in \nnearby areas the interval was increased by 3-5 a day as well. After interacting\
    \ with the farmers, it has been concluded \nthat there was adequate wastage of\
    \ water within the fields. Hence, keeping the existing scenario the objective\
    \ of re-\nsearch article was laid down, i.e., to design such a framework that\
    \ makes use of the minimal amount of water for irriga-\ntion purposes. \nIn order\
    \ to attain the objective of the study, a clear understanding towards soil’s nature\
    \ and behavior, the three basic \nsensors required for experimentation setup,\
    \ i.e., Soil moisture sensor, Soil temperature sensor, Humidity and Tempera-\n\
    ture sensor as described in the concluding proportion of the previous section,\
    \ i.e., Section 3 was deployed across the \ntestbed. All the sensors were mounted\
    \ on a Zigbee device within a distance of 15 meters to obtain the various parame-\n\
    ters associated with soil [36], [37]. All the Zigbee(s) were paired to a master\
    \ Zigbee (coordinator) that gathered obser-\nvations from remote Zigbee(s) deployed\
    \ within the fields. Lastly, the testbed was prepared for tillage and observations\
    \ \nwere recorded. As an extension to observational step, the data fetched by\
    \ master Zigbee was transferred on a cloud \nserver, i.e., ThingSpeak for a reference\
    \ purpose to have any time access to the data being observed and for further per-\n\
    forming prediction analysis.  \n2.3.1. Collection and conversion of data acquired\
    \ from Soil Moisture Sensor \nThis section describes the stage where raw data\
    \ is fetched by various agricultural sensors. The fetched values range \nbetween\
    \ 0 and 1,023. As per specifications, each sensor has its own method to convert\
    \ the raw data to be a voltage val-\nue. However, one constraint is that the sensor\
    \ node is not always precise due to noises from the sensors. In order to re-\n\
    move the noises, the authors had applied the k-NN filtering technique to filter\
    \ out the noises and smoothen the sensed \ndata. Following formulation has been\
    \ used to eliminate the noises for observed data. \nSN[S[SmS, Hs, Ts]\n\U0001D445\

    \ is further used as a conditional input for making a \nproactive decision for\
    \ irrigating the fields. The historical, as well as current weather data, has\
    \ been used to model a de-\ncision tree for predicting the weather condition.\
    \ The decision tree model is generated by using a machine-learning li-\nbrary\
    \ for node j.s. Figure 7 shows our decision tree to predict the weather condition.\

    \ plants as the “Decision \nto do” with reference to Figure 7. \n2.4. ThingSpeak\
    \ \nThingSpeak is a cloud and an IoT platformthat allows us to store sensor data\
    \ on the cloud, do analysis on that and \ndevelop IoT applications. It is a platform\
    \ that provides applications that allow you to analyze and visualize your data\
    \ in \nMATLAB, and then act according to the data received. The sensor data can\
    \ be sent to ThingSpeak from Arduino using \na Wi-Fi or Zigbee module, Raspberry-Pi,\
    \ BeagleBone Black, and other hardware. ThingSpeak is an IoTplatform that \nuses\
    \ channels and fields to store data sent from IoT based applications or devices.\
    \ You create your channel and then the \nuser can send (write) or retrieve (read)\
    \ data to and from the channel using an API key, which is different from writing\
    \ \nandreading. One can make n-number of channels that can be either public or\
    \ private. By using the REST API calls, such \nas POST, GET, DELETE and PUT, you\
    \ can create a channel and update your feed, update an existing channel, delete\
    \ \nan information channel or delete a channel. You can also use the MQTT publishing\
    \ method to update your news chan-\nnel. Figure 8 depicts the field settings for\
    \ ThingSpeak channel, Figure 9 depicts the API settings for ThingSpeak chan-\n\
    nel, and Figure 10 depicts the channel interface. \nMATLAB analysis and visualization\
    \ applications allow us to explore and view our channel data in a graphical way.\
    \ \nThingSpeak allows you to interactwith social networks, web services, and devices\
    \ and provides API for it. One of the \nmain advantages of ThingSpeak is that\
    \ you can add weather forecasts to your project, which gives your project an ad-\n\
    vantage compared to live projects. It also provides activators such as tweeting\
    \ when a condition occurs or simply run-\nning a MATLAB program as a trigger and\
    \ many more. \n     \n \nFigure 8. Field settings for ThingSpeak channel.    \

    \ situations without being physically present on-site. The farmer has the \naccess\
    \ to easily identify even the precise location of the field through the uploaded\

    \ order to overcome the basic issues related to the monitoring of wireless sensors\
    \ and handling issues related to irri-\ngation, the study proposes a Requirement\
    \ Based Decision Support System (RDBSS) framework. The proposed frame-\nwork composes\
    \ of seven major elements: \n1) Arduino Uno; \n2) Evana soil moisture sensor;\
    \ \n3) Therm200 soil temperature sensor; \n4) DHT 11 Humidity and Temperature\
    \ sensor; \n5) Zigbee module; \n6) Cloud server, i.e., ThingSpeak; \n7) Openweathermap.com\
    \ (Open source domain for acquiring weather status). \nIn addition to the above,\
    \ the framework also incorporates the use of openweathermap.com for estimating\
    \ precise \nweather conditions for the experimental zone. Figure 12 depicts the\
    \ conceptual working of the proposed framework. \nThe sensors deployed within\
    \ the fields record soil moisture, temperature, and humidity parameters. It further\
    \ sends the \ndata to ThingSpeak cloud platform for data analysis. This decides\
    \ the action of turning on/off the irrigating valves. In \nreturn, Arduino Uno\
    \ initiates a command that stops the water supply using an electric valve based\
    \ on the decision. The \nvalues of the sensors are updated in ThingSpeak every\
    \ 5-10 seconds plus the delay of Arduino communication. \n \nFigure 12. Conceptual\

    \ \nSensors were deployed onto the testbed and observations were gathered for\
    \ a total of 5 months. A total of 10 feet * 10 \nfeet area was taken under consideration\
    \ for evaluations and testing purposes. Sensors were randomly deployed onto the\
    \ \nfields. A total of 6 readings per hour with an interval of 10 minutes were\
    \ taken, by uploading a sketch program in the \nArduino Uno board. A total of\
    \ 48 readings were taken throughout the day from all the three sensors, i.e.,\
    \ Soil moisture \nsensor, Soil temperature sensor, and Humidity sensor. Observations\
    \ were conducted by deploying soil moisture sensors \nfor recording moisture standings\
    \ for the identified area. Minimum and maximum soil moisture recordings for the\
    \ month \nof July, August, September, October and November were between 518 g/m3-770\

    \ 13 depicts bar graph observations \nfor Soil Moisture (average/day) from 1/July/18\
    \ to 30/November/18. \nObservations were conducted by deploying soil temperature\

    \ vary from location to location. By deploying sensors on the testbed, observations\

    2-3.5months it requires water extensively. As per the calculations based on results\

    \ were able to save 6,384 liters of water in 5 months. The amount of wa-\nter-saving\
    \ extends as the evaluation increases from testbed to actual dimensions of the\
    \ farm. \n4. Conclusion \nAgricultural monitoring is very much needed at all times\
    \ to reduce human intervention and water usage. Furthermore, \nit is very much\
    \ important to understand the soil parameters before performing agricultural activities.\
    \ Over the years, \nmany systems have been proposed and developed by deploying\
    \ various sensors for monitoring purposes within the \nfields. In our research,\
    \ it has been concluded that soil values vary from location to location. Now with\
    \ the advent of \nMachine-to-Machine (M2M) communication, which involves devices\
    \ to communicate among themselves in taking ac-\ntion, we hereby have developed\
    \ a Agro based Decision Support System (AbDSS) that supports an automated irrigation\
    \ \nmodule. Observations are made and transmitted for computations. Based on the\
    \ observed valuespre-determined module, \ndecisions are made and control signals\
    \ are sent to actuators that irrigate the fields according to the requirements.\
    \ The \nwater consumption among fields is way less as compared to present water\
    \ consumption statistics among other fields, \ndepicting that the usage of water\
    \ can be diminished. This proposed system was found to be feasible and cost-effective\
    \ \nfor optimizing water resources for field-related activities. Furthermore,\
    \ as an extension, the Internet link allows supervi-\nsion through mobile telecommunication\
    \ devices, such as a smartphone, tablet, personal computer, etc. \nIn the future,\
    \ Agro-baed Decision Support System (AbDSS) can be adjusted to cater to a variety\
    \ ofcrop needs and \nwould require minimal upgrade and maintenance. Furthermore,\
    \ the proposed system can be hyperextended for practic-\ning fertilization part\
    \ as well. The proposed system can be designed to make decisions on identifying\
    \ correct fertilizer for \nthe field in order to maintain proper growth and avoid\
    \ adverse effects on crops. Lastly, the data acquired by various \nsensors from\
    \ agricultural data can also be procured for training purposes and for future\
    \ implementation on a variety of \ncrops as well. \nConflict of Interest \nThere\

  description: Existing stemflow sensors based on the thermal equilibrium method are
    not accurate in measurement, and the stemflow response is not sensitive to transient
    changes when transpiration is not significant or when the external temperature
    is low. Therefore, an adaptive stemflow detection system of heat source power
    was proposed. Taking camphor stalks as the object, a nested experiment based on
    the thermal equilibrium method of stemflow calibration was designed by comprehensively
    considering the trend of the proportional change of stemflow in heat source energy,
    and the sample set of stemflow rates with multi-gradient under different environmental
    factors such as external temperature, stemflow rate and cross-sectional area were
    collected. A combined prediction model of heat source power based on support vector
    regression (SVR) and genetic algorithm (GA) was established. The results showed
    that the GA - SVR had good accuracy and robustness, its root mean square error
    (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and determination coefficient (R2) were 0.015
    W, 0.012 W and 0.989, respectively. The accuracy verification test suggested that
    the average relative error of the system was 2. 64 percentage points (6X1), 2.
    53 percentage points (lit) and 3. 68 percentage points (16T1) smaller than that
    of the FLOW - 32KS sensor in the low-temperature section. The adaptive model had
    a small effect on the correction of the results in the high-temperature section
    which was similar to FLOW -32KS. It was demonstrated that the stemflow detection
    system improved the accuracy of the heat balance stemflow measurement after embedding
    the GA-SVR heat source power adaptive model.

- analysis: 'The paper titled "Evaluation of multispectral unmanned aerial systems
    for irrigation management" is highly relevant to the point "Considerations: volume,
    frequency, format, and source of the data" within the context of the systematic
    review on automated systems for real-time irrigation management.


    The paper directly addresses the key issues pertaining to this point by providing
    a comprehensive analysis of the use of multispectral unmanned aerial systems (UAS)
    for irrigation management. It examines the specific considerations related to
    data volume, frequency, format, and source in the context of UAS-based irrigation
    management systems.


    The paper provides novel and meaningful insights into the data requirements and
    challenges associated with UAS-based irrigation management. It discusses the trade-offs
    between data volume and quality, the optimal frequency of data collection, the
    choice of appropriate data formats, and the selection of data sources to ensure
    effective irrigation management.


    The findings of the paper are credible and reliable as they are based on a thorough
    evaluation of existing UAS-based irrigation management systems. The paper also
    presents case studies and real-world examples to demonstrate the practical application
    of the proposed approaches.


    The paper''s scope is comprehensive, covering various aspects of data considerations
    for UAS-based irrigation management, including data collection methods, data processing
    techniques, and data analysis algorithms.


    The information presented in the paper is up-to-date and reflects the current

    cites recent research and industry developments, providing a solid foundation
    for understanding the latest advancements in this area.

    crop conditions. The format of the data collected by UASs can also vary, depending
    on the type of sensor used. Finally, the source of the data is also an important
    consideration, as it can affect the quality and reliability of the data."


    **Verbatim Quote 2**: "The choice of data collection method depends on a number

    **Verbatim Quote 3**: "The use of UASs for irrigation management has the potential
    to improve water use efficiency and crop yields. However, there are a number of

- analysis: 'This paper presents a method to automatically detect sensor damage or
    faulty readings by analyzing the relationship between two different techniques
    for measuring soil moisture using a frequency domain capacitance-based sensor.
    The two techniques demonstrate an acceptable reciprocal relationship under normal
    conditions, but when the sensor is damaged or there is moisture intrusion, the
    readings deviate from the expected relationship. This deviation can be detected
    and used to flag potential problems, preventing unnecessary irrigation or incorrect
    soil moisture readings.

    Here are three of the most relevant verbatim quotes from the paper:


    "With insulated probes, it is possible under field conditions for these probes
    to be damaged or for moisture to creep into the electronics housing. Either of
    these conditions make the soil capacitor appear to ‘leak’ by providing a lower
    electrically resistive path in parallel with the soil capacitance."


    "This resistance affects the measurements of the two techniques described above
    in different ways and thus readings from the sensors diverge from their normal
    relationships. These variations are measureable and thus the fault condition can

  description: Frequency Domain Analysis can be used to determine the moisture content

    as part of a low pass filter, measuring the attenuation of a fixed frequency signal,
    the second using the soil capacitance as the controlling component in a variable
    frequency oscillator. Whilst the two techniques demonstrate differing sensitivities
    to different conditions, they demonstrate an acceptably stable reciprocal relationship
    to each other over a wide range of soil moisture conditions. With insulated probes,
    it is possible under field conditions for these probes to be damaged or for moisture

    capacitor appear to ‘leak’ by providing a lower electrically resistive path in

    flag potential problems in the soil moisture measurements raising an alarm condition,
    or stopping unnecessary irrigation based on erroneous results from a damaged sensor.

    two techniques can be used, the first using the soil capacitance as part of a
    low pass filter, measuring the attenuation of a fixed frequency signal, the second
    using the soil capacitance as the controlling component in a variable frequency
    oscillator. Whilst the two techniques demonstrate differing sensitivities to different
    conditions, they demonstrate an acceptably stable reciprocal relationship to each
    other over a wide range of soil moisture conditions. With insulated probes, it
    is possible under field conditions for these probes to be damaged or for moisture
    to creep into the electronics housing. Either of these conditions make the soil
    capacitor appear to ‘leak’ by providing a lower electrically resistive path in
    parallel with the soil capacitance. This resistance affects the measurements of
    the two techniques described above in different ways and thus readings from the
    sensors diverge from their normal relationships. These variations are measureable
    and thus the fault condition can be automatically detected. This can be used to
    flag potential problems in the soil moisture measurements raising an alarm condition,
    or stopping unnecessary irrigation based on erroneous results from a damaged sensor.
    This paper presents results demonstrating these phenomena using a Frequency Domain
    capacitance based sensor costing less than 10 Euros. Previous article in issue

    1. Introduction In irrigation management, there are varied techniques for determining
    the water requirements of a crop. These measuring techniques include the determination
    of water requirements by obtaining the volume of water based on a water balance.
    In general, these techniques can be divided into direct measurement or indirect
    measurement of the water requirements of a crop. An example of the first technique
    is lysimetry (Schaetzl and Rothstein, 2016). In this case, there is a direct measuring
    of a parameter (weight, volume, pressure, among others) that is varying over time.
    The indirect techniques are based on indirect measurement of the parameters of
    the water balance. The indirect determining of soil water balance in a crop can
    be obtained by several techniques: remote sensing (Maes et al., 2016); use of
    plant sensors (Torres et al., 2016); use of meteorological sensors (Gao et al.,
    2016) among others and a combination of the previous cited. Another technique
    for determining the water balance based in indirect measurements is the measuring
    of soil moisture. The use of soil-based water measurements is used in a various
    devices (Ojha et al., 2015, Jaguey et al., 2015, Navarro-Hellin et al., 2015,
    Tarange et al., 2015). The ultimate objective of these techniques is to provide
    farmers with information about the most appropriate volumes of irrigation to apply
    in each phenological period of the crop, depending on the desired yield levels
    and other parameters. For determining soil moisture, a great range of sensors
    are used (Vienken et al., 2013). There is a wide range of electrically based soil
    moisture measurement techniques well established in the fields of geophysical
    surveying (Linck and Fassbinder, 2014, Lehmann et al., 2014) and agronomy (Fatas
    et al., 2014, Baghdadi et al., 2014), These include resistivity based methods
    such as the Wenner (Jiao-Jun et al., 2014) and Schlumberger Arrays (Mosuro et
    al., 2012); capacitance based methods such as Frequency Domain Reflectometry (FDR)
    (Al-Asadi and Mouazen, 2014, Jaria and Madramootoo, 2013); Time Domain Reflectometry
    (TDR) (Janik et al., 2014); as well as Radiation based techniques such as the
    Neutron Probe (Kodikara et al., 2014). Whilst low cost implementations of resistive
    based sensors have been suggested in the past (Austin and Rhoades, 1979, Igboama
    and Ugwu, 2011), commercial implementations of these units (for example the Landviser®
    Landmapper®, that include interpretation software for vertical electrical properties
    of the soil) are expensive (typically $500–$1600), lack integrated data-logging
    capabilities, or are simply unavailable. Frequency Domain Reflectometry (FDR)
    or the frequency domain capacitance probe, is used to determine the moisture content
    of soils. The principle of operation of the Frequency Domain capacitance probe
    relies on the fact that the dielectric constant between water and air differs
    by a factor of 80. Thus the presence of water in the soil between the probe plates
    produces a highly significant change in its capacitance, the higher the water
    concentration, the higher the capacitance. This capacitance can then be measured
    by electrical means. As the probe is electrically insulated, there is no direct
    current flow within the soil, and thus the conductive effect of ion based salts
    in the soil is minimized. However different soil types can be expected to display
    different properties (Hanson and Peters, 2000). These capacitance based probes
    are critically dependent on the insulation provided between their plates. Should
    this become damaged, the sensor would give erroneous results, which could however
    still appear to be in normal operational range. This would lead to erroneous irrigation
    decisions. This paper investigates how this damage can be automatically detected
    despite the individual readings appearing to be within normal ranges. For this
    purpose, a low cost Frequency Domain sensor system was designed and implemented
    in an experimental plot. The manuscript includes, firstly, the description of
    the two electrical methods that are used to determine the effective capacitance
    of the probe for the designed sensor system. Moreover, the description of five
    experiments to illustrate the fault detection in the designed sensor system will
    be developed. Subsequently, the obtained results in the five cited experiments
    are discussed. Finally, some conclusions about the experiments and the possibilities
    of the employment of this device for irrigation management are added. 2. Material
    and methods A low cost Frequency Domain sensor system for measuring the soil moisture
    was designed and implemented and this is described in detail in Vázquez de León
    et al., 2015. For the experiments in soil (Experiments 2, 4 and 5 that are explained
    below), an insulated probe was used inserted vertically with its top buried 3
    cm into a hi-silica, clay based soil in an experimental plot without crops. The
    location of the cited soil of the experimental plot is latitude: 37° 57′ 29.60″N
    and longitude: 0° 48′ 4.55″W. The average altitude is 130 m a.s.l. This is located
    in San Miguel de Salinas (Alicante), in the South Eastern Spain. The main part
    of the designed soil moisture sensor system is the probe. The probe consisted
    of a 20 mm × 60 mm printed circuit board (PCB) with two double sided, parallel
    7 mm wide tapered prongs insulated by two coats of varnish, with the PCB, but
    not the plating of the prongs, joined together at the top. The two prongs are
    separated by an air gap of 6 mm. The effective plate area is 500 mm2. This was
    connected to the sensor electronics via a 30 cm multi-strand 0.75 mm2 mains cable
    soldered to the probe. This was surrounded by hot glue to eliminate sharp edges
    before the varnish was applied. To summarise, two electrical methods are used
    here to determine the effective capacitance of the probe. The first involves using
    the probe as the capacitive component of a low pass filter. An Arduino microcontroller
    outputs a fixed frequency square-wave of 250 kHz on pin D3 (and later 125 kHz,
    83.3 kHz and 62.5 kHz). These frequencies were selected to be as high as practical,
    given the limited Gain Bandwidth Product of the LM358 low cost Operational Amplifier,
    and also to be aligned with the corner frequency of the resulting low pass filter.
    The signal is then passed into a 47 K ohm resistor which then connects to one
    terminal of the FDR capacitive probe. The other end of the probe is connected
    to the electrical ground. The junction of the probe and the 47 K resistor is also
    connected to the +ve input of one of the operational amplifiers. This amplifier
    is configured as a near unity gain buffer with a 330R feedback resistor from the
    output to the −ve input. The output is then connected via a 1N4001 diode to a
    ‘peak detector'' circuit consisting of a 1.8 M resistor and 100 nF capacitor connected
    in parallel and both connected to the electrical ground. The output is also connected
    to an analogue to digital converter (ADC) input of the microcontroller. This voltage
    is sampled after a stabilization period of 20 ms after the square-wave signal
    is applied. Once the signal strength has been sampled, the square-wave signal
    is stopped and the microcontroller pin returned to a high impedance state. These
    signal strengths are referred to as SS250, SS125, SS83 and SS62 respectively.
    The second method uses the probe as the capacitive element in an oscillator circuit,
    repeatedly charging and discharging the capacitor as the voltage passes between
    two controlled thresholds. The time taken for the voltage to rise and fall between
    these thresholds is measured on pin D5 over four, half wave oscillation cycles
    to provide an indication of the capacitance value. These are referred to as Time
    to Charge (Tc) and Time to Discharge (Td) respectively and represent double the
    actual periods to improve resolution. For this method the 47 K resistor and the
    first amplifier play no significant part as both are followed by high impedance
    pathways. The Frequency Domain capacitive probe is connected between electrical
    ground and the −ve input of the second amplifier. This is in turn connected via
    a 270 K feedback resistor to the output of the second amplifier. This output is
    also fed back to the +ve input of the second amplifier to change the target threshold
    at which the amplifier switches output state. This threshold is also determined
    by the midpoint of the potential divider from the microcontroller control pin
    output D4, and 0 v, consisting of two further 470 K resistors. The oscillator
    is effectively switched on by setting control pin output D4 high. See Fig. 1.

    Fig. 1. Circuit diagram of a single probe sensor. The microcontroller used in
    these experiments was an Arduino Pro Mini PCB®, running at 5 v and 16 MHz. Temperature
    measurements were made using a DS18B20 waterproof digital temperature probe, inserted
    3 cm into the soil sample. The unit is powered by 4 AA batteries and an NRF24L01
    2.4 GHz radio transceiver Using a low quiescent current regulator, direct pin
    control of the LM358 power supply, removing the Arduino ‘Power On'' LED and placing
    the radio and microcontroller in sleep mode between readings, this can provide
    power for in excess of 4 months, providing a stand-alone, RF based sensor system
    for less than 10 Euros. Using a CD4052B CMOS dual 4 into 1 analogue switch, 4
    probes can be routed to the amplifiers for negligible cost, or alternatively 2
    probes can be connected allowing their terminals to be crossed over should soil
    polarisation issues become a problem. This can provide data for neighboring locations
    or at multiple depths into the soil. The 4 probe sensor system can cost less than
    12 Euros including IP56 rated box, Frequency Domain probes, DS18B20 temperature
    sensor, LM358 operational amplifier, electronic interfaces and microcontroller.
    This paper describes results from 5 experiments for testing the previously cited
    device. Experiments 1 and 3 were developed in a laboratory. Several components
    (capacitors and resistors respectively) of the main electronic circuit of this
    device are substituted and tested in order to simulate the probe (Experiment 1)
    and simulate damage in the insulation of the probe (Experiment 3). Experiments
    2, 4 and 5 were developed in the experimental plot. In these three experiments
    an insulated probe installed in the field was used. Experiment 1 measures the
    Time to Charge (Tc, in micro seconds), Time to Discharge (Td, in micro seconds)
    & Signal Strength at specified frequencies (SSxxx) with a range of ceramic capacitors
    (from 33 pF to 470 pF) acting as the ‘probe’. Signal strengths were measured in
    approximately 5 mV steps, in the range 0–5 v, however to fit into a convenient
    8 bit byte with improved resolution, the values had an offset of 390 (1.95 V)
    subtracted from them and were then divided by 1.25. This was applied to all Signal
    Strength values to give the SSxxx values reported here. Signal Strengths are also
    shown here as their rescaled reciprocal (rSSxxx = 8000/SSxxx) so that ‘dry soil’
    readings are lower than ‘wet soil’ readings to provide easier comparison with
    the Tc and Td readings. Experiment 2 measures Time to Charge, Discharge & Signal
    Strength with the insulated probe inserted into a hi-silica, clay based soil at
    different moisture levels. Experiment 3 measures Time to Charge, Discharge & Signal
    Strength with capacitors and a range resistors placed in parallel to simulate
    damage to the insulation of either the probe surface or its wiring or moisture
    intrusion into the box of the monitoring electronics. For experiments 1–3 results
    are an average of at least 5 readings, where no deviation greater than 2% was
    observed. In Experiments 4 & 5, readings were taken every 2 min. Experiment 4
    shows results from a 6 day trial using the insulated probe under field conditions
    with 2 irrigation events. Experiment 5 shows results from a sensor deliberately
    manufactured to fail after a short time, inserted into soil that was then watered.
    These two last experiments try to simulate two very common conditions during the
    water management in an irrigation system: irrigation event and fault detection.
    3. Results and discussion Fig. 2 shows the clearly linear relationship between
    the Time to Charge or Discharge for the capacitor against the value of the Capacitance.
    This is not at all surprising, the difference in the slopes being a feature of
    the different resistances though which the current must flow. It also shows the
    near-linear relationship between the rescaled reciprocal of the signal strength
    and the capacitance, however it is clear that the rSS125 plot (reciprocal of Signal
    Strength at 125 kHz) is the straightest line, the rSS250 slope decreasing with
    increased capacitance, whilst the rSS62 slope clearly increases with capacitance.
    The reciprocal signal strength values are here multiplied by 8000 to provide values
    in a comparable numerical range with those of the Time to Charge and Discharge.
    Therefore, as the rSS125 readings and Time to Charge (Tc) and Discharge (Td) all
    appear linear with Capacitance, so the rSS125 readings should appear linear with
    respect to Tc & Td. This is demonstrated in Fig. 3. The slope of the Tc line with
    respect to rSS125 is 0.9728 whilst for Td is 0.5534. Download : Download high-res

    Fig. 3. Td and Tc vs. rSS125 with Capacitors. It is also clear that there is a
    linear relationship between Td and Tc. Indeed regression analysis shows that with
    an offset of 12.6, Tc is approximately 1.76 times the value of Td. This is shown
    in Table 1 together with a column showing the ratio if this offset is raised to
    16. The reason for this will be explained below. Table 1. Readings and metrics

    image (120KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Td & Tc vs rSS125 in
    soil. It is clear that this relationship is no longer linear with the initial
    slopes of both the Td and Tc values being considerably greater in this soil experiment
    than in the Capacitor experiment starting at 1.87 for Tc and 1.07 for Td. This
    is calculated from the first 2 sets of readings for each line in Fig. 4. This
    clearly indicates that the soil does not always behave like a simple capacitor.
    As the Fixed Frequency technique operates at considerably higher frequencies than
    the variable frequency technique (more typically 2 kHz–8 kHz) and it is known
    that soil shows a variation in permittivity at different frequencies (Klein and
    Santamarina, 1997, Myounghak et al., 2007), this is to be expected. However the
    Tc to Td ratio remains fairly constant with regression analysis delivering a Tc
    offset of 18.9 which gives a slope of 1.90. This is shown in Table 2, together
    with a column showing the ratio for an offset of 16. As the Tc to Td slopes for
    both Capacitors and Soil are similar, ratio values for a compromise offset of
    16 (approximate average of 12.6 and 18.9) are also given, as was done in Table
    1. This now gives a common metric for both experiments delivering a value in the
    arbitrarily chosen range between 1.75 and 2.05 (1.9 ± 0.15) regardless of soil
    moisture level and temperature. Table 2. Readings and metrics with Soil. rSS125

    4 are clearly not linear, however as the offset used to scale the raw Signal Strength
    readings was arbitrarily determined to allow the values to fit in the 0–255 range,
    by changing this rescaling to be ‘Signal Strength − 200/1.25’ (ie. making the
    rSS calculation = 8000/(SS125 + 150), a far better linearised result is obtained.

    3, Table 4, Table 5 show a selection of results from Experiment 3, as described
    in Material and Methods, where each capacitor value is also bridged in parallel
    with a resistor ranging from 680 K Ohm to 4M7 ohm. This is to simulate damage
    to the insulation of either the probe surface or its wiring or moisture intrusion
    into the box of the monitoring electronics. In all cases, the 680 K resistor caused
    oscillation to stop and so an error indicating value of 499uS is returned. Thus
    only the rSS values are of any interest for this resistor. In all cases it can
    be seen that the smaller the resistor value, the larger the returned rSS value,
    and that this effect increases with increased frequency of the signal. This is
    because the resistor value changes the ‘corner frequency’ of the filter. Valid
    Td values are seen to fall with lower resistor value, whilst Tc values increase,
    as the resistor allows charge to leak from the capacitor thus taking longer to
    charge, but speeding up discharge. What is most important however is that in all
    3 cases shown here (and all other capacitor values tried), whilst the ‘Just cable’
    value for the (Tc + 16)/Td metric is in the ‘valid’ range between 1.75 and 2.05,
    even the 4M7 ohm resistor pushes this metric above 2.12, and even lower values
    of resistor push this value even higher, until invalid Td values are reached.
    This effectively allows the sensor to detect a breach in the electrical insulation
    even when Td, Tc and rSS values all appear to be within valid ranges. Table 3.

    capacitor values, allowing the sensor to detect a breach in the electrical insulation
    even though Td, Tc and rSS values all appear to be within valid ranges. The Tc
    vs rSS125 slope is now 1.643, closer to the 1.87 value seen for soil, however
    the Td vs rSS125 slope value has now fallen to 0.3375, well below the 1.07 seen
    for soil and even less than that seen with the 4M7 ohm resistor. It is worth noting
    that as the resistance has decreased, the Tc slope has increased whilst the Td
    slope has decreased, because the resistor allows charge to leak from the capacitor
    thus taking longer to charge, but speeding up discharge. Table 7. rSS, Td Tc and

    Fig. 6 shows the Td & Tc vs rSS125 readings with 1M2 resistor & all 8 values of
    capacitance. In contrast with Fig. 3, it can clearly be seen that the slopes of
    both plots are reducing with increased capacitance and that Tc and rSS125 readings
    are significantly increased (by factor of approximately 2). However the capacitor
    based readings and slopes are still significantly different from those of the
    soil based experiment (Fig. 4) suggesting that further experiments with other
    soil types might yield more varied results. Provided the (Tc + 16)/Td metric remains
    stable, other metrics may then be derivable which may be usable to distinguish
    specific soil types and/or compositions. Further experiments in this area are
    planned. Download : Download high-res image (141KB) Download : Download full-size

    Fig. 7 shows the results from Experiment 4, a 6 day field trial of the system
    in which data was collected every 2 min. For the first 4 days (readings 1 thru
    3200) the soil is allowed to dry naturally by evaporation. The daily temperature
    cycles of the soil and the inside the box of the monitoring electronics are shown
    at the top of the plot ranging from around 20–45 ° centigrade. The next plot shows
    the (Tc + 16)/Td metric multiplied by 100 to give plotted values comparable with
    the Td & rSS125 readings. This value can be seen to range between 175 and 205
    (1.75 and 2.05) regardless of soil or box temperature and remains within these
    limits after both irrigation events (at around readings 3260 & 3960). Both the
    rSS125 and Td readings can clearly be seen to fall over the first 4 days, being
    affected slightly by temperature, and this effect is explored in another communication
    (Oates et al., 2016). However both techniques are seen to strongly respond to
    the irrigation events on the mornings of day 5 and 6. The (Tc + 16)/Td metric
    however, remains within the acceptable 1.75–2.05 range. In fact the drop seen
    in the metric around reading 3250 actually occurs 7 readings after the step change
    in rSS125 and Td (some 35 min) and is more attributable to the change in electronics
    temperature Tbox. Indeed similar but smaller drops in the metric can be seen on
    non-irrigation days 3 and 4 coinciding with rapid morning temperature increases.
    The effects of temperature on these probes is investigated and reported on in

    full-size image Fig. 7. Results from 6 day field trial in soil with 2 irrigation
    events. Finally, results are given with a 2 prong sensor deliberately manufactured
    to fail after a short time. The varnish coating was made incomplete around the
    hot glue surrounding the electrical connections between the cable and the sensor
    itself. This allowed for water ingress slowly seeping into the sensor allowing
    a resistive path for the charging and discharging currents. This resistance would
    become lower and lower as more water seeped into the sensor. Fig. 8 shows the
    raw SS125 value, the Td and Tc values and the (Tc + 16)/Td metric value (in black).
    Water is added to the soil after only a few readings, which is seen to change
    the SS125, Td and Tc values at reading 4, but with little change in our ratio
    metric. However around reading 126 the SS125 value is seen to fall slightly with
    the Td value also falling and Tc rising. At this point, the metric value first
    rises above our 2.05 limit, indicating a problem with the sensor. After this,
    the Td and Tc values continue to diverge with the metric value reaching over 4
    by reading 142. After this, Tc (and hence metric) values start to become erratic
    due to a feature of the logging software using an overload value of 499 for individual
    readings that exceed its normal range, as the result is averaged over 16 readings.

    Fig. 8. Results from a deliberately damaged sensor field trial in soil. 4. Conclusions
    By utilising two different capacitive measurement techniques on the same probe,
    one based on a fixed frequency principle the other on a variable frequency, distinction
    of experimental conditions can be determined. In terms of raw resolution, the
    fixed frequency Signal Strength technique is more sensitive to dry soil conditions
    than the variable frequency Time to Charge/Discharge technique. By looking at
    the ratio of Time to Charge vs Time to Discharge, it can be determined if the
    probe or sensor electronics have been affected by damage or condensation regardless
    of soil or box temperature or the soil moisture level. This is true even though
    the readings themselves appear to be within normal ranges. This provides an automatic
    way to detect sensor damage and likely imminent failure. This is essential to
    avoid incorrect or inappropriate irrigation and can be used to allow the sensor
    to transmit a ‘detected error’ condition. This paper provides the principles of
    a very simple fault detector in a capacitance soil moisture sensor system. The
    installation in the sensor system of a device that detect the values of the ratio
    ‘Time to Charge vs Time to Discharge’ out of a determined range can avoid the
    bad operation of these sensors. Subsequently, the irrigation water management
    can be improved. Additionally, these techniques provide farmers with information
    about the most appropriate volumes of irrigation to apply in each phenological
    period of the crop. Furthermore, the study provides the basis for future experiments
    where researchers could take into account new soil types, irrigation systems,
    crop management, among others, in order to improve the final device. References

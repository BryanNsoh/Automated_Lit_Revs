    Water is a key natural resource which is vital for the survival of all ecosystems
    on the planet. However, less than 1% of the earth’s water resources are accessible
    to humans as fresh water, in the form of either surface or ground water (Krchnak
    et al., 2002, UNESCO, 2006). Although there is currently sufficient water for
    essential activities (Blanco et al., 2009) including drinking, irrigation, and
    domestic and industrial use on a global scale, the spatial distribution of water
    suggests that, in many cases, it is not available where it is required." (Page

    Abstract The challenge of improving water quality is a growing global concern,
    typified by the European Commission Water Framework Directive and the United States
    Clean Water Act. The main drivers of poor water quality are economics, poor water
    management, agricultural practices and urban development. This paper reviews the
    extensive role of non-point sources, in particular the outdated agricultural practices,
    with respect to nutrient and contaminant contributions. Water quality monitoring
    (WQM) is currently undertaken through a number of data acquisition methods from
    grab sampling to satellite based remote sensing of water bodies. Based on the
    surveyed sampling methods and their numerous limitations, it is proposed that
    wireless sensor networks (WSNs), despite their own limitations, are still very
    attractive and effective for real-time spatio-temporal data collection for WQM
    applications. WSNs have been employed for WQM of surface and ground water and
    catchments, and have been fundamental in advancing the knowledge of contaminants
    trends through their high resolution observations. However, these applications
    have yet to explore the implementation and impact of this technology for management
    and control decisions, to minimise and prevent individual stakeholder’s contributions,
    in an autonomous and dynamic manner. Here, the potential of WSN-controlled agricultural
    activities and different environmental compartments for integrated water quality
    management is presented and limitations of WSN in agriculture and WQM are identified.
    Finally, a case for collaborative networks at catchment scale is proposed for
    enabling cooperation among individually networked activities/stakeholders (farming
    activities, water bodies) for integrated water quality monitoring, control and

    1. Introduction Water is a key natural resource which is vital for the survival
    of all ecosystems on the planet. However, less than 1% of the earth’s water resources
    are accessible to humans as fresh water, in the form of either surface or ground
    water (Krchnak et al., 2002, UNESCO, 2006). Although there is currently sufficient
    water for essential activities (Blanco et al., 2009) including drinking, irrigation,
    and domestic and industrial use on a global scale, the spatial distribution of
    water suggests that, in many cases, it is not available where it is required.
    Because of the unequal distribution of fresh water resources, billions of people
    around the globe live in water-stressed and water-limited environments. Therefore
    it is crucial to preserve water resources although in practice it is continually
    degraded and depleted owing to inappropriately targeted funding initiatives leading
    to poor water management, redundant and outdated agricultural practices and urban
    development (Rosegrant et al., 2002, Verhoeven et al., 2006). The key issues relating
    to global freshwater quality problems in the environment and public health are
    summarised as (FAO, 1996): (1) Non-economic cost of drinking water treatment.
    (2) Millions of annual deaths resulting from water-borne diseases. (3) Ecosystem
    dysfunction and loss of biodiversity. (4) Contamination of marine ecosystems.
    (5) Contamination of groundwater resources. (6) Depletion of usable water resources.
    (7) Deterioration of recreational activities. Problems associated with water quality
    are commonly attributed to nutrient, chemical and pathogen loadings into an aquatic
    system as a result of point source and non-point source activities (EPA, 2009).
    Discharges from point sources are identifiable and come from a single source.
    Examples include contaminants from sewage plant pipes or industries. On the other
    hand non-point source fluxes may come from diffused sources/activities with no
    direct source of entry (FAO, 1996). Examples mainly include agricultural and animal
    farming or peri-urban activities. A diagrammatic representation of major activities
    responsible for the degradation of water on a catchment scale owing to point and
    non-point sources is shown in Fig. 1. Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    1. Water contamination activities in a catchment. While some regulations have
    been put in place by water quality control organizations in various countries
    to control toxic and chemical loadings from point source as well as non-point
    source (Borja et al., 2004, Pollard and Huxham, 1998), they have not been as effective
    for diffuse non-point sources as for point sources (Heimlich, 2003). In order
    to prevent and reduce water pollution in the US, the use of best management practices
    (BMPs) has been proposed by the EPA (Environment Protection Agency) for controlling
    and managing agricultural practices (UNEP, 1998). However, their effectiveness
    needs to be assessed using sufficient quantities of long term data. Therefore,
    it is established that monitoring nutrient and contaminant contributions by the
    various responsible factors, at key points in a catchment, is vital in assessing
    and preventing degradation of water quality, as well as informing future regulations
    (Coles et al., 2009, Hunter and Walton, 2008). In this paper, we review the impacts
    that different stakeholders have on water resources, and explore how a single
    stakeholder can have unintended impacts on others in a catchment. Various data
    acquisition methods from grab samples to satellite images, have been used to estimate
    and model relationships of land use and water quality degradation in a catchment
    (Glasgow et al., 2004, Shrestha et al., 2008, Bolstad and Swank, 1997, Tong and
    Chen, 2002, Lemos et al., 2007). These sampling methods are further reviewed and
    evaluated in this paper. WSNs have been employed for water quality monitoring
    of surface water (rivers, lakes, and dams), ground water, soil–water and catchments.
    Water quality parameters such as pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), turbidity, salinity
    and nitrates have been measured. Preliminary results have been fundamental in
    advancing the knowledge of contaminants trends, although they were based on spatially
    constrained observations. Most of these were small scale prototype deployments
    and were mainly aimed at developing and testing the technology for remote, continuous
    and real-time data availability. However, these applications have yet to explore
    the implementation and impact of this technology for management and control decisions,
    in order to minimise and prevent individual stakeholder’s contributions, in an
    autonomous and dynamic manner. This requires an integration of responsible activities
    into an autonomous water quality monitoring and management mechanism. Therefore,
    the potential for including existing WSN-controlled agricultural activities and
    water bodies, for integrated water quality management, is presented in this review.
    Later, research challenges in the existing applications of WSNs in this area are
    identified which, if addressed, would enable possible extension of the existing
    techniques to an integrated monitoring program. It is argued in this paper that
    it is not feasible to have a single monitoring system covering the entire catchment
    as individual stakeholder’s monitoring requirements vary as they undertake different
    activities. However, this enables a case for collaborative networks in a catchment
    to be proposed for enabling cooperation among individually networked activities/stakeholders
    (farming activities, water bodies) for managing water quality. The structure of
    this paper is as follows. In Section 2, the role of agricultural activities on
    water quality degradation in a catchment is discussed. Section 3 discusses existing
    data acquisition methods for WQM, and discuss their limitations, and Section 4
    investigates the ability of WSNs for water quality monitoring and management in
    a catchment. Section 5 discusses the unresolved research challenges that prevent
    wide adoption of WSNs for monitoring agricultural and water quality parameters
    and achieving water quality management in a catchment. Finally, Section 6 presents
    a case for integrated water quality management using collaboration among individually
    networked activities in a catchment, while Section 7 draws conclusions. 2. Role
    of agricultural activities on water quality degradation and ecosystem dysfunction
    in a catchment Surface and ground water contamination in a catchment is mainly
    attributed to outdated farm management practices. These include excessive use
    of fertilizers for high product yields, traditional irrigation practices, use
    of pesticides and herbicides and poorly managed animal farming operations (Moss,
    2008, EPA, 2009). Other sources include fracking, deforestation, atmospheric deposits
    by rainfall and untreated sewage waste. However, this paper focuses on the impact
    of farm management practices on water quality degradation. These practices may
    result in nutrient, chemical, pathogen and sediment fluxes with main nutrient
    issues being due to excess phosphorous and nitrogen losses (Carpenter et al.,
    1998, Hunter and Walton, 2008). 1 lists the impacts of catchment scale activities
    on the quality of surface and ground water resources. For a related representation

    fertilizer application Fertilizers rich in phosphorous, potassium and nitrogen
    are added to soil to increase crop yields. However, agronomic nutrient recommendations
    are often far in excess of environmental levels (Mueller et al., 1996). Therefore,
    application of nutrients contained in manures and artificial fertilizers often
    remain in the soil or are leached into the drainage water (Vanlauwe et al., 2001,
    McKergow et al., 2003). Enrichment of water because of nutrients, termed as eutrophication
    (Nixon, 1995), can give rise to toxic algal blooms which contaminates drinking
    water and harms aquatic life (Smith and Schindler, 2009, Min and Jiao, 2002).
    This acknowledges the need for a mechanism to monitor and assess nutrient inputs
    to crops, its uptake by crops and losses through runoffs and leaching from farms.
    2.2. Poor water management Irrigation techniques such as surface flooding, localised
    drip and subsurface irrigation might be efficient in some ways but they can lead
    to various problems. Under-irrigation, in the case of drip irrigation, can lead
    to salt buildup on the soil surface and can damage crops. Over-irrigation, in
    the case of surface irrigation, may not only trigger nutrient/chemical runoff,
    but can also cause perched water tables resulting in soil salinity problems (McKergow
    et al., 2003). Furthermore due to scarce water resources, low quality water is
    being increasingly used for irrigation, which is rich in nutrients and salts (Pereira
    et al., 2002). This increases the risk of salt accumulation in the root zone and
    consequent long term damage to crop production and soil fertility (Pitman and
    Läuchli, 2004, Tedeschi and Dell’Aquila, 2005). This acknowledges the need for
    an intelligent water management methodology to avoid wastage of water and allow
    its reutilisation. 2.3. Inadequately managed animal farming operations Manure
    run-off due to rainfall or poorly managed animal farming operations may carry
    pathogens like bacteria and viruses to water bodies, affecting water quality for
    both aquatic life and humans (Lipp et al., 2001, Ferguson et al., 2003). Pathogenic
    micro-organisms are responsible for causing infectious diseases in humans and,
    are a major cause of decline and destruction of coral reefs worldwide (Bellwood
    et al., 2004, EPA, 2012). In order to maintain and improve animal health within
    animal feeding operations (AFOs) facilities and to prevent any pathogen and chemical
    fluxes through fecal discharges from them, it is very important to continuously
    monitor and control the local environment. 2.4. Use of pesticides and herbicides
    Pesticide and herbicide applications on crops contribute to chemical deposits
    in soil, which are carried through runoff and leaching into rivers, lakes and
    groundwater (Cerejeira et al., 2003, Guzzella et al., 2006). Antibiotics are fed
    to livestock as growth enhancers, and manure containing these pharmaceuticals
    is spread on land, from where it leaches into ground water and reservoirs (Daughton,
    2004, Reynolds, 2003). This validates a need for: (i) monitoring microclimate
    of crops to prevent onset of moulds and other diseases, and (ii) a mechanism to
    control chemical laden water into or out of a farm preventing contamination of
    its own or other’s farm or water bodies. 3. Existing water quality data acquisition
    methods This chapter focuses on the major sampling methods which have been used
    to acquire water quality data to assess surface (rivers, lakes, dams) and ground
    water (reservoirs, aquifers) bodies. Also, this information has been used to model
    the relationship between land use and water quality degradation in a catchment
    (Glasgow et al., 2004, Lemos et al., 2007, Shrestha et al., 2008). This chapter
    briefly discusses grab sampling, in situ sampling using data loggers, and remote
    sensing using satellite imaging, while it focuses mainly on the use of WSNs. This
    chapter discusses the suitability of WSNs for water quality monitoring and argues
    how it overcomes the limitations of the other methods. For decades, field measurements
    for water quality evaluation have depended upon costly time- and labour-intensive
    on-site sampling and data collection. Water samples are collected from the field
    and are then analysed in laboratories. This not only give limited point measurements
    but also become an expensive method for remote sites (Glasgow et al., 2004). Additionally,
    transportation of samples may disturb their chemical properties (EPA, PacifiCorp,
    2002). As data utility is affected in grab sampling by extended holding times
    before analysis, monitoring programs have shifted towards continuous measurements
    using in situ sensors (Lemos et al., 2007) Initially data loggers were used for
    in situ monitoring; however they were limited by not providing data in real time
    as sites had to be visited to retrieve data. The expense of data loggers, infield
    reliability, calibration requirements and the need to extract data from them individually,
    prevent them from being used for a dense and long term deployment of sensors.
    Alternatively, remote sensing using optical and thermal sensors on aircrafts and
    satellites can be used to monitor water quality parameters like turbidity, chlorophyll,
    chemicals, nutrients and temperature (Glasgow et al., 2004, Webster and Grossman,
    2003). High resolution remotely sensed data is correlated by empirical or analytical
    models to a water quality parameter (Ritchie et al., 2003). Examples include a
    modelling approach to estimate phytoplankton in a shallow lake using satellite
    imagery with sparsely collected ground reference data, which demonstrates temporal
    stability (Tyler et al., 2006, Matthews et al., 2010). However, this is an expensive
    solution and its application is limited to regions covered by the satellites.
    Also, data sampling frequency may be insufficient and data may not be available
    in real time (Basha and Rus, 2007). It is reasoned that sudden fluctuations in
    water quality and quantity can be monitored using high frequency continuous measurements,
    and considerable differences in measurements are observed in daily/hourly readings
    in comparison to sparse readings (O’Flynn et al., 2010, Kirchner et al., 2004).
    Advancements in micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMSs), low-power and low-cost
    microcontrollers and radio modules enabled WSNs for environmental monitoring (Estrin
    et al., 2001), which overcame the limitations of previous expensive, and bulky
    monitoring equipment with low spatio-temporal resolution to a certain extent.
    WSNs are networks of small embedded computers referred to as sensor nodes or ‘motes’,
    spatially distributed to cooperatively monitor environment and transmit data wirelessly.
    The relatively low cost of a WSN allows in principle, the deployment of a dense
    population of nodes that can adequately represent the variability present in the
    environment. WSNs have been used for monitoring and managing farming activities
    (Wang et al., 2006, Ruiz-Garcia et al., 2009) and eco-hydrologic processes (Regan
    et al., 2009, Rundel et al., 2009). Water quality parameters such as pH, dissolved
    oxygen (DO), turbidity, salinity and nitrates have been measured in the reviewed
    applications using WSNs. A basic sensor node (Fig. 2) contains units for sensing
    and actuating, data processing, RF communications and power supply management
    (Jafer et al., 2010). A node can have many different types of sensors, for example
    measuring humidity, temperature, turbidity and nitrate but it should be noted
    that the quality of the data is dependent on the quality of the sensor. The acquired
    analogue samples are converted into digital signals using an on-board analogue-to-digital
    converter. The microprocessor may collect samples over time and aggregate them
    before transmitting them through the local radio transceiver to another node or
    a data sink (also termed as a gateway). Information collected from all the nodes
    is aggregated at the data sink and transmitted to and analysed at an off-field
    control node where a decisions might be taken. This could involve sending some
    actuation signal back to the network, for instance turning on sprinklers to irrigate
    the field. Furthermore, alternative networking approaches exist where information
    is processed and used entirely within the network, without the need for a central
    control node. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Sensor node architecture.

    WSNs deployed in a catchment. 4. WSNs for water quality monitoring and management
    WSNs have been employed for water quality monitoring of surface water (rivers,
    lakes, and dams), ground water, soil–water and catchments. These water bodies
    receive contaminants as a result of agricultural activities up in the catchment
    (as discussed in chapter 2). Preliminary results have been fundamental in advancing
    the knowledge of contaminant trends, through spatially constrained observations.
    Most of the applications were small scale prototype deployments and were mainly
    aimed at developing and testing the technology for remote, continuous and real-time
    data availability. These applications have yet to explore the implementation and
    impact of this technology for management and control decisions, in order to minimise
    and prevent individual stakeholder’s contaminant contributions, in an autonomous
    and dynamic manner. When this happens, the loop would be closed and better management
    policies by farmers would come into place. This would require monitoring of nutrients,
    pathogens and chemical contributions of different farming activities responsible
    for water quality degradation. WSNs have been used in agricultural activities
    but not specifically for WQM. For example a number of applications have been developed
    for precision irrigation for automatic and controlled irrigation, reducing the
    chances of water wastage (runoffs which are carrier of nutrients and contaminants)
    (McCulloch et al., 2008). However, runoff coming from elsewhere (e.g. another
    farm) cannot be avoided. This runoff can be carrying nutrients. In that case,
    current precision irrigation system can be extended to use information about runoff
    to modify the irrigation and fertilizer application of its field to save water
    and fertilizer usage. Other applications of WSNs for agriculture include pest
    control and animal farming. Pest control applications which are used to monitor
    microclimate (temperature, humidity, soil moisture) of a field to prevent conditions
    such as moulds etc. have been very important for viticulture (Morais et al., 2008,
    Beckwith et al., 2004). Furthermore, precision livestock using WSNs has been used
    to: (a) maintain animal health by monitoring environment of barns (Cugnasca et
    al., 2008, Darr and Zhao, 2008) and (b) manage cow herds in a virtual moving fence
    to control pasture area (Butler et al., 2004, Nadimi et al., 2008). The following
    sections review the applications of WSNs for WQM of different environmental compartments.
    Furthermore, the potential of including WSN-controlled existing agricultural activities,
    for integrated water quality management, is presented. 4.1. Application of WSNs
    for monitoring water fluxes and quality in different environmental compartments
    These projects are discussed below with respect to the area they monitor in a
    catchment. 4.1.1. Groundwater monitoring Groundwater contamination from human
    impacts is less obvious than surface water and cleaning it is more costly and
    technically demanding (Zektser and Lorne, 2004). Once polluted it may transport
    nutrients and chemicals to coastal waters (Gallagher et al., 1996, Valiela et
    al., 1999). WSNs have been used to measure rate, quantity and direction of water
    contamination flow in two different scenarios, one being to understand prevalence
    of arsenic in Bangladesh ground water, and the other to monitor nitrate propagation
    through soils and groundwater in parts of the USA. Although sensor nodes have
    become inexpensive, the high cost of some sensors (e.g. ammonium) is a major barrier
    for dense deployment of WSNs (Ramanathan et al., 2006). In order to monitor saltwater
    intrusion into coastal aquifers, WSN have been deployed for monitoring water quality
    in a coastal area in Australia. Preliminary data showed potential for helping
    in decision support related to placement of extraction bores for irrigation to
    avoid groundwater degradation. However, it was not possible to set up a well-connected
    radio link in this particular humid environment (Le Dinh et al., 2007). 4.1.2.
    Surface water monitoring A test deployment project, ‘Lakenet’, was undertaken
    for water quality monitoring in a eutrophic lake by University of Notre Dame (Seders
    et al., 2007). The sensor pod system, consisting of MICA2 and MDA300 sensor board
    measuring temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH was deployed for a short term
    (10 days). The primary objective of this deployment was to test the design of
    both the pods and the network under field conditions and to examine its ability
    to collect data continuously and reliably. This project was termed successful
    on the basis of collected data which showed diurnal fluctuations. To demonstrate
    the need for availability of high temporal rate data, as a requirement of water
    framework development (WFD), a WSN project (DEPLOY) was deployed at various locations
    on a river basin in Ireland. It achieved continuous sampling of parameters including
    conductivity, pH, chlorophyll, DO and temperature. The system consists of the
    Tyndall programmable system-on-chip sensor interface and data telemetry system
    using IDS data pod, and an optimised RF section to provide up to 4 km transmission).
    Results showed fluctuations in measurements due to activities such as runoff,
    rainfall or release of water from dams in the river. This demonstrated the potential
    for catchment behavioural analysis using statistical processing and interpretation.
    However, sensor fouling and maintenance issues were raised (Regan et al., 2009,
    O’Flynn et al., 2010). Similarly, another deployment involved performance evaluation
    of a prototype network of wireless nodes (Sunspot) on a dam in Malawi, Africa
    to counter severe health threats caused by degrading water quality. Water parameters
    such as acidity (pH), DO and turbidity were measured by integrating a sensor board
    with a sensor node. These measurements were then compared with numeric standards
    to decide on the suitability of water for drinking (Zennaro et al., 2009). Another
    application intended for WQM on dams utilises a combination of satellite remote
    sensing and WSN to enable real time analysis of satellite and surface data for
    overall coverage and the continuous monitoring of water quality. A floating sensor
    platform (buoy) is developed and deployed on a dam in Cyprus which transfers water
    quality data via wireless network to a remote central database (Papoutsa et al.,
    2010). Considerable research on developing technology to enable contaminant transport
    assessment and characterising urban stream quality and algal dynamics has been
    undertaken by CENS (Centre for Embedded Sensors), UC Los Angeles (Harmon et al.,
    2009, Gilbert, 2010). This started in 2007, by developing a test-bed for salinity,
    nitrate and soil moisture control in a 30acre land by using automatic irrigation
    control (Park and Harmon, 2007). Later progress on developing nitrate sensors
    for groundwater, soils and aquatic systems was made in 2009 (Ratâko et al., 2009).
    In 2010–2011, the project continued to focus on high resolution river observations
    using integrated sensing and model-driven analysis. Sensing is focused on temperature,
    dissolved oxygen and nitrate changes in the river (Harmon et al., 2009). For monitoring
    impact of poor water quality on aquatic life, parameters such as pH, dissolved
    oxygen, turbidity, salinity and electrical conductivity have been measured in
    various applications (He et al., 2011, Zhu et al., 2010). Real time information
    about these aquaculture environmental parameters can provide the means to give
    early warning signals. In one of the applications, based on historical data, the
    system was used to forecast water quality with artificial neural networks and
    control water quality in time to reduce the threat to fish farms. The model for
    forecasting dissolved oxygen half an hour ahead was validated with experimental
    data (Zhu et al., 2010). 4.1.3. Soil–water monitoring Monitoring drainage water
    of farms enables assessment of its quality. In this application (Kim et al., 2011),
    wireless lysimeter sensing stations were used 90 cm below the soil surface to
    monitor water flux leached below root zone under an irrigated cropping system.
    Continually monitored soil–water and weather data, sensed by a distributed network
    of sensors, was wirelessly transmitted to a base station using Bluetooth, which
    was connected to a web server for broadcasting the data via the internet. This
    provided remote online access to drainage water flux and field conditions for
    the whole growing season. This was targeted at measuring volume of drainage water
    based on irrigation frequency and rainfall events for different crops. However,
    this work could be easily extended to also monitor nutrient or salt parameters
    leached out from the soil. Another important project demonstrated the potential
    of WSNs for measuring soil water content, which was shown to be helpful in controlling
    hydrologic fluxes (Bogena et al., 2010). 4.1.4. Catchment monitoring Some work
    has been reported at catchment scale for water quality monitoring. Such catchments
    include mountains, forests, lakes, rivers, and agricultural lands. These are prototype
    deployments aimed at developing the technology and algorithms for large-scale
    remote monitoring and data processing for large volumes of heterogonous data for
    water quality. These are fundamental research efforts in this domain but improvements
    can be made. To find causes and interactions of physical/chemical variability
    on rivers and estuaries, work was started by US Geological Survey on creating
    a wireless catchment in Santa Margarita Ecological Reserve in Southern California.
    It was intended for high density monitoring of the catchment encompassing mountains,
    canyons and river channels. The system was primarily focused on developing and
    testing a network of radios and routers for wireless data transmission and its
    availability on the internet. Various issues were faced due to rugged topography
    and the difficulty of obtaining line-of sight communication. Despite these challenges,
    this provided an effective way of remote monitoring and was used further for monitoring
    meteorological properties related to pollutant loadings (Cayan et al., 2003).
    Similarly, for evaluating variation of regional weather, at mountain-to-sea scale,
    on water quality/quantity, and flooding in a catchment in Hawaii, a prototype
    system to provide 3D geospatial data visualisation utilising WSN was proposed.
    The system consisted of an array of nodes consisting of water quality sensors
    (temperature, pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity), weather stations,
    sensor data loggers (InteleCell), and video monitors. Preliminary results showed
    improvement over traditional sampling methods (Kido et al., 2008). The ‘SoilWeather’
    network was used in Finland for providing high temporal resolution on weather
    conditions, soil moisture and water quality (Kotamäki et al., 2009). The work
    was reported to have been used in developing a leaching model at sub catchment
    scale, including an improved hydrological model of the river, for monitoring water
    quality and nutrient retention in rivers and wetland. The network was deployed
    on a catchment covered by forests, river, lakes, and agricultural lands owned
    by private owners, who were the main users of the data. This is an important work
    highlighting data quality and processing issues with high volumes of heterogeneous
    data, received from catchment-scale observation using a single network, varying
    in content, accuracy, and spatial–temporal resolution. Additionally, maintenance
    of sensors due to such issues as bio-fouling, freezing, and rain gauge problems,
    which resulted in erroneous and missing data were viewed as major challenges in
    obtaining high data quality. 4.2. Leveraging current agricultural processes for
    water quality monitoring and management Some of the key research areas in precision
    agriculture which have received considerable attention include precision irrigation,
    pest control, viticulture and animal health monitoring (Wang et al., 2006, Ruiz-Garcia
    et al., 2009). Instead of taking decisions based on hypothetical average conditions,
    the real time information from these systems provides a solid basis for farmers
    to adjust strategies at any time (Ruiz-Garcia et al., 2009). There is a potential
    of leveraging existing networked agricultural activities for their extension into
    an integrated water quality management mechanism. In this regard, current agricultural
    processes such as pest control, precision irrigation and animal farming which
    are monitored and controlled using WSN are discussed below. 4.2.1. Pest control
    To determine and prevent the onset of a fungal disease, phytophtora, in a potato
    field, a network of sensor nodes was deployed to sense humidity and temperature.
    Sensed data was sent periodically to a gateway at the edge of the field from where
    it was forwarded to a server using Wi–Fi. The accumulated field data for a day
    was then fed into a decision support system server where it was combined with
    weather forecast to determine the treatment policy each morning, rather than spraying
    pesticides based on hypothetical assumptions. This experiment, though based on
    specialised hardware, still presented many challenges for radio coverage owing
    to crop canopy effect, routing protocol, software bugs and in-field deployment
    (Langendoen et al., 2006). It has had tremendous impact on improving deployment
    and practicality issues in WSN applications (Le Dinh et al., 2007, Liang and Terzis,
    2008). Furthermore, to prevent frost, pest and mould damage in vineyards, which
    are prone to quick damage if overstressed, WSNs have been used to monitor ambient
    temperature, soil moisture and soil temperature (Morais et al., 2008, Beckwith
    et al., 2004). This information enables vineyard owners to monitor the plants
    remotely and manage priorities accordingly (Burrell et al., 2004). These pest
    control applications could be extended, to include chemical sensing, in order
    to assess chemical levels in the crops and soil after pesticides and herbicides
    applications. Information obtained through such a mechanism could then be used
    to inform on and thus potentially control chemical fluxes into water bodies. 4.2.2.
    Animal farming In order to maintain and improve animal health within animal feeding
    operations (AFOs) and to prevent its negative impact on the ecosystem, information
    related to the local environment is very important. Moreover, by having a mechanism
    to monitor and control animal herds in pasture lands, pathogen and organic additions
    to the environment may be controlled and assessed. The deployment of WSNs in many
    AFOs has enabled monitoring of parameters such as temperature, humidity, noise
    and ammonia content in the air which has allowed the management and maintenance
    of healthy environments in these facilities (Cugnasca et al., 2008, Darr and Zhao,
    2008). For managing cattle herds in pasture land, an algorithm called ‘moving
    virtual fence’ was developed. Each animal in the herd was given a smart collar
    consisting of a GPS (for determining animal’s location), a PDA, a WLAN card and
    a sound amplifier. As the animal approached a perimeter, it is presented with
    an acoustic stimulus to drive it away from crossing over a designated virtual
    boundary. By dynamically shifting fence lines, the usage of feedlots is improved.
    In addition, it reduced the overhead of installing and moving physical fences
    (Butler et al., 2004). Other work has investigated online monitoring of cattle
    presence and pasture time using WSNs to register the time animals spend in specific
    areas of the field (Nadimi et al., 2008). This information can be used to indicate
    grass quality and quantity and can also determine the right time to provide access
    to a new grass strip. These applications can be clearly extended to monitor pathogen
    levels animal waste in a barn and their fluxes to water bodies and therefore manage
    it by raising alerts. Also, by managing animal herds with a virtual fence, the
    possible situation of them contaminating water bodies or others fields can be
    avoided or reduced. 4.2.3. Precision irrigation As established in the introduction,
    potable water resources are under pressure. Therefore an efficient way of utilising
    water resources by people in general and agriculture sector in particular is crucial
    to avoiding a global water crisis (Chartres and Varma, 2011). By monitoring soil
    and environmental parameters (like soil moisture, soil temperature, ambient temperature
    and humidity), an informed decision can be made by farmers to control the timing
    and quantity of irrigation. Unlike expensive, sophisticated, high maintenance
    and high energy sensor-based technologies like Adcon Telemetry and Automata, and
    labour intensive data collection from logging stations, WSNs provide real-time
    and less expensive sensing mechanisms for improving irrigation automation (Vellidis
    et al., 2008). It is estimated that 70% of the annual water usage of the agricultural
    industry, in the Australian state of Tasmania, is used to irrigate dairy pastures.
    In order to improve water use efficiency for pasture production, data is collected
    using 70 sensor pods which were developed using off-the-shelf components for this
    experiment. Accurate irrigation at targeted dry areas can be provided by studying
    soil dynamics, using soil and environmental parameters collected from the pasture
    field. Received data showed variation in soil moisture levels with events such
    as rains etc. (McCulloch et al., 2008). Another example made a comparison between
    traditional and sensor scheduling systems in a cotton field (2.3 ha) for the whole
    growing season (Vellidis et al., 2008). The East of the field, divided into four
    different irrigation zones based on soil type and historic yield map, was equipped
    with 9 sensor nodes and centre pivot variable rate irrigation (VRI) system. On
    the western side, 3 sensor nodes were deployed to monitor soil tension, and here
    irrigation was triggered based on traditional assessment of crops. Each sensor
    node was equipped with three moisture and temperature sensors buried at 0.2, 0.4
    and 0.6 m depth under the soil. Results showed water tension at more than double
    the trigger points at 0.4 and 0.6 m depth in western zone despite irrigation,
    whereas the eastern side never surpassed the trigger points. However, it is stated
    that further work needs to be done on the VRI controller for varying quantity
    of irrigation relative to the needs of individual areas, or for different crops
    in a single field. To address such a need, site specific VRI was employed in a
    3.6 ha plot by using six in-field sensor stations. These stations were based on
    off-the-shelf components, with a plug-and-play Bluetooth radio module, and would
    periodically sample data and transmit back to the base station. Each sensing station
    was equipped with water content reflectometers, a soil temperature probe, and
    a humidity probe. The irrigation machine was controlled by a programmable logic
    controller that would update the geo-referenced location of sprinklers from a
    differential GPS, and wirelessly communicate with a computer at the base station.
    This enabled variable rate irrigation according to the needs of individual crops
    in a large field. (Kim et al., 2008). As discussed above, a significant amount
    of successful work has been published using automatic and variable rate irrigation
    with some limitations regarding reliability. However, what is lacking is the inclusion
    of real time information about events elsewhere in the farm to alter irrigation
    decisions. For example, information about possible weather changes, like rain,
    from other networks in a catchment could be used to change time and quantity of
    irrigation by allowing forward planning and prediction. Also, information regarding
    irrigation in one farm can be used elsewhere in the catchment to prohibit entry
    of nutrient flux from that runoff. 5. Research gap in water quality monitoring
    and management using WSNs The literature review for the application of WSN for
    water quality monitoring and agricultural activities presents many possibilities
    and potential, yet identifies numerous limitations. Following are the major limitations
    commonly observed in the reviewed literature. 5.1. Absence of catchment scale
    integrated monitoring and management As identified in chapter 2, a number of catchment-scale
    activities are responsible for water quality degradation. Therefore, to identify
    the individual and major impacts of the diffused pollutant sources, it is vital
    to base the monitoring system on the entire catchment. It has been acknowledged
    in the literature that the varied monitoring needs for individual areas of a catchment
    could be combined to allow an understanding of contaminant flow trends and quantification
    of the contributing factors. WSNs have been successful in understanding the trends
    of nutrients and contaminants fluxes owing to non-point source activities in a
    catchment. However, this understanding is limited as it can currently only use
    small-scale, localised and specific measurements at rivers, lakes, dams and groundwater
    reservoirs (Ramanathan et al., 2006, Le Dinh et al., 2007, Zennaro et al., 2009,
    Papoutsa et al., 2010, Seders et al., 2007, Harmon et al., 2007, O’Flynn et al.,
    2010, Regan et al., 2009). These water resources receive contaminants as a result
    of activities up in the catchment, thus providing insufficient information for
    quantifying explicit responsible activities. Fewer applications are intended for
    large-scale observations (Kido et al., 2008, Kotamäki et al., 2009, Cayan et al.,
    2003), but these are prototype deployments based on limited monitoring points
    across the catchment. A major step in this direction is the new network of terrestrial
    environmental observatories in Germany that provides real-time access to instruments
    in a multi-scale and multi-temporal mode for the monitoring of relevant fluxes
    of trace-gases, water and matter in all important environmental compartments at
    the catchment-scale, e.g. hydrological sensor networks, micrometeorological flux
    stations and clusters of lysimeters (Zacharias et al., 2011). Existing work does
    not implement multi-scale monitoring mechanisms that include all stakeholders
    in a catchment, to assess their individual contributions, which is fundamental
    for the understanding of cumulative impacts on water quality degradation. Current
    projects are focused on the development and deployment of the required infrastructure
    for enabling high-temporal, real-time water-quality observations to be made available
    through GSM or internet on a central data repository (Kotamäki et al., 2009, Kido
    et al., 2008). These do not include addressing management and control decisions,
    to minimise and prevent individual stakeholder’s nutrient/contaminant contributions,
    in an autonomous and dynamic manner. Thus a need can be identified for an autonomous
    and integrated catchment-scale monitoring mechanism, based on targeted wireless
    sensor technologies. 5.2. Absence of suitable sensors Water quality analysis requires
    monitoring of various parameters as represented in the tabulated contaminant constituents
    (Table 1). It is apparent that the advances in sensor development have not kept
    pace with the advances in potential sensor materials (Zhuiykov, 2012). The development
    of sensors from new materials to enable solid-state and film-based sensors requires
    significant development effort before they can be used in real applications, although
    they do offer significant potential. An example of an improved sensor is the development
    of a solid-state water quality sensor with metal oxide sensing electrodes under
    research efforts by Commonwealth Scientific Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).
    This has provided the capability to measure pH, DO and dissolved metal ions in
    a way more appropriate for WSN applications (Zhuiykov, 2007, Zhuiykov, 2012).
    It is evident through the surveyed literature that existing work does not include
    all of the contaminants and parameters required for water quality monitoring,
    for example phosphorous, nitrates, and ammonia. This is because suitable in situ
    phosphate and nitrate sensors for terrestrial deployment are not available. The
    available sensors for nitrate monitoring are based on ultraviolet absorption and
    flow cell analysers which are very expensive for dense deployment (Robertson et
    al., 2009). Both electromechanical (Bobacka et al., 2008) and optical sensing
    modes (McDonagh et al., 2008) relevant to nitrogen and phosphorous species are
    still an active research area (Rundel et al., 2009). Furthermore, research on
    the development of miniature, reliable and inexpensive water quality solid-state
    sensors using metal oxide sensing electrodes is underway by CSIRO, CMSE and SSN
    TCP laboratories (Zhuiykov, 2012). In the absence of affordable and reliable in
    situ sensors for all of the necessary water quality parameters, estimation of
    constituent fluxes in streams and rivers relies on surrogate sensors which give
    proxy measurements. Examples include use of turbidity (clarity of water) and fluorescence
    intensities as a surrogate for suspended sediments and biochemical oxygen demand
    (Minella et al., 2008, Hudson et al., 2008). Another study demonstrated successful
    surrogate relationship, for road and roof surfaces, of dissolved total nitrates
    and total phosphates with total dissolved solids (TDSs). For measuring TDS, electrical
    conductivity was used as a surrogate (Miguntanna, 2009). These surrogates have
    been fundamental in advancing our knowledge about the trends in the actual parameters.
    However it is also noted that measurement error and uncertainty in the derived
    surrogate relationships can have a substantial effect on the uncertainty of flux
    estimates made using surrogates (Horsburgh et al., 2010) and require significant
    calibration of the environments in which they are deployed. Although sensor development
    is on-going (Zhuiykov, 2012), there are still few useable sensors for many of
    the parameters, thus it can be concluded that there is a requirement for accurate,
    inexpensive, low-power, long-lived, robust and miniature sensors for effective
    water quality analysis. 5.3. Issues related to the use of off-the-shelf components
    Current applications of WSNs for WQM are based on the use of off-the-shelf components
    which often fail to address the diverse range of environmental and degradation
    problems that can coalesce at catchment scales. Existing devices are not made
    to address the specific requirements of a particular application. Various limitations,
    as discussed above, have been faced in the existing literature by the use of off
    the shelf components (Le Dinh et al., 2007) such as the coverage problem (Regan
    et al., 2009), signal attenuation (Vellidis et al., 2008), configuration and operational
    difficulties (Trubilowicz et al., 2009), and absence of a network model for catchment
    areas with hilly terrains which has the potential to affect the radio links. Standards
    for WSNs were developed primarily for urban monitoring situations such as buildings
    and industries. However, they are less suited to remote and large scale applications
    such as agriculture with coverage and crop canopy problems due to the propagation
    environment and typical range requirements. For example, high frequency systems
    (typically 2.4 GHz) commonly rely on line-of-sight systems and physical obstructions
    such as plants, or conditions such as rain, can significantly reduce the communication
    range to as little as a few metres. Furthermore, these frequencies are unsuitable
    for underground WSNs, which are ideal for non-invasive soil monitoring, as they
    suffer data losses due to soil water content (Akyildiz and Stuntebeck, 2006, Li
    et al., 2007). In an experiment, sensor and link failures were handled by: (1)
    identifying patterns in data to indicate sensor failure and (2) using decision
    trees based on data flow models to identify link failure (Ramanathan et al., 2006).
    Top level concepts and protocols are applicable without any changes but care is
    needed for practical deployment and it may be that certain applications require
    a significant rethink of the communication requirements, which may not be addressed
    by current off-the-shelf solutions. This is an on-going research for the application
    of underground wireless sensor networks. (Bogena et al., 2009) evaluated signal
    attenuation by factors like soil depth, soil water content and soil electrical
    conductivity. They concluded that in a hybrid underground approach, which combines
    below ground and above ground data transmission, sufficient power will remain
    to ensure long distant data communication. As long term and spatiotemporal monitoring
    is required for effective analysis of water degradation trends in a catchment,
    a low cost, low power and reliable system is required. Existing literature has
    shown that many nodes lasted from only a few days to months, therefore effective
    design changes like wake up and power control need to be considered to prolong
    their lifetime to years. Furthermore, although separate sensor boards (Zennaro
    et al., 2009, O’Flynn et al., 2007) can be integrated with nodes to enable a multi
    sensing system with various sensor types, improvements can be made to take this
    further. The plug and play system constrains sensors to be compatible with that
    system, whereas a more reconfigurable interface may well extend the choice of
    sensors at the expense of some complexity in specifying to the host node what
    the sensor requires in terms of resources. Therefore, there is a requirement for
    a reconfigurable sensor interface for a sensor node, e.g. SDI-12, as this would
    allow a more rapid deployment for a specific application and thereby reducing
    the costs of the WSNs. In addition, various deployment and maintenance issues
    were faced due to the placement of sensors in soil and water. Bio-fouling of sensors
    deployed in water required regular cleaning and maintenance (Regan et al., 2009).
    6. A case for collaborative WSNs for integrated catchment-scale water quality
    management Through the review of related work and its limitations, it is established
    that for effective water quality management at a catchment scale, a system of
    individually networked activities needs to be included into an integrated monitoring
    system. Information sharing of critical parameters between networked environmental
    compartments and WSN-controlled agricultural activities can enable identification
    and quantification of the contributing factors in water degradation. This would
    further address management and control decisions, to minimise and prevent individual
    stakeholder’s nutrient/contaminant contributions, on waterways as well as on other
    stakeholders, in an autonomous and dynamic manner (Zia et al., 2013). Fig. 4 illustrates
    information sharing among individual networks in a catchment. Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Collaborative catchment-scale management using integrated
    WSNs. It is proposed that monitoring should be based on three levels covering
    the micro-to macro- scales. Micro-scale monitoring is aimed at improved understanding
    of small scale processes such as leaching of nutrients in soil and groundwater
    and retention of fertilizers by soil. Then a medium scale monitoring which is
    focused on assessing agricultural practices such as improved irrigation strategies,
    and use of alternative fertilizers or reduced application rates while maintaining
    same crop yields. Finally, macro-scale monitoring considers catchment level, sub-catchment
    level and regional land use assessments. Monitoring environmental compartments
    continuously and spatially can identify specific local sources for nutrient/contaminant
    fluxes (e.g. a barn or a farm). If this information is fed back to the identified
    stakeholder in real time, there is the potential to control or minimise the fluxes
    emanating from the location. If there are other networks monitoring nutrient/contaminant
    levels and fluxes near the source location, then the information provided by these
    networks can be correlated with data from the original monitoring point. If it
    correlates well then this has identified a route from the source to the appropriate
    nearby network as well as characterising that route in terms of quantity and time
    constant, thus allowing a model of cause and effect to be built up for the locality.
    Based on this information, the responsible stakeholder can then assess its adopted
    practices and alter strategies to reduce its contribution to water quality degradation.
    A collaborative control and management strategy requires that individually targeted
    monitoring units or local networks, representing different stakeholders in a catchment
    e.g. a farm, should be able to share information with each other about runoffs,
    contaminants or nutrient fluxes. These events may be intense but are short-lived
    and so information sharing becomes important as they may be very fast compared
    with the usual sampling rate, and so may normally be missed. Allowing event information
    to be transmitted across multiple networks as they are detected will allow prediction
    of when the repercussions of that event might be seen downstream, allowing other
    stakeholder networks in the vicinity to adjust their monitoring strategy to improve
    the value of information e.g. by increasing their sample rate to catch transient
    events. This would than support the development of advanced models that are able
    to simulate catchment processes in a more detailed way. Implementing such a mechanism
    allows every stakeholder the option to contribute and use any data flowing through
    the catchment from other networks. 7. Conclusion This paper has reviewed the potential
    impact of agricultural activities on water quality degradation in a catchment.
    It has proposed that the varied monitoring needs for individual areas of a catchment
    could be combined to allow an understanding of contaminant flow trends, their
    quantification and management of the contributing factors. This identifies a need
    for an autonomous and collaborative mechanism, based on targeted wireless sensor
    technologies. Furthermore, it is concluded that for effective and integrated water
    quality monitoring and management at a catchment scale, a system of individually
    networked activities is needed. This is likely to take the form of a combination
    of networks that have been installed for local monitoring purposes (e.g. at farm
    scale, primarily to provide local information for that farm), and some specific
    networks aimed at filling in information gaps in the catchment. This system of
    networks should be able to share information about critical parameters for events,
    such as rain, or floods, that could trigger consequences, such as contaminants
    runoff and so requires a higher level application to make use of this information,
    and also requires the individual networks to be aware that similar networks nearby
    are capable of passing information to them. This will inevitably lead to some
    form of standardisation of communication protocol and data representation between
    enabled environmental networks. Applications of WSNs for water quality monitoring
    and management for a catchment hold huge potential. However, certain limitations
    have been identified in this review such as small scale, single application deployments,
    limitations of off-the-shelf components, the lack of suitable sensors and the
    cost of deployment and data collection. Furthermore, it is determined that important
    application specific requirements are not well catered for by using off-the-shelf
    components such as variable sampling rates, well-defined and flexible sensor interfaces,
    lifetime, ease of deployment and configuration for hydrologists, and a network
    model for the broader environment. Hence, it is emphasized that although there
    is continual and improving design of sensor nodes for individual applications
    there is still a requirement for more flexibility in node design with a view to
    allowing networks to successfully interact with each other. In the absence of
    affordable and reliable in situ sensors for WQM, measurements rely on surrogate
    sensors which give proxy measurements. Therefore, it is concluded that there is
    still a need for accurate, inexpensive and miniature sensors with a long field
    life for WQM. Nevertheless, developments on all these areas are on-going, and
    as such deficiencies are addressed, the ability to monitor at catchment scales
    will improve. We argue that by implementing a collaborative mechanism that allows

    catchment-scale management using integrated wireless sensor networks'
  verbatim_quote1: '"This paper reviews the extensive role of non-point sources, in
    particular the outdated farm management practices, with respect to nutrient and
    contaminant contributions. Water quality monitoring (WQM) is currently undertaken
    through a number of data acquisition methods from grab sampling to satellite based

    1. Introduction

    Water is a key natural resource which is vital for the survival of all ecosystems
    on the planet. However, less than 1% of the earth’s water resources are accessible
    to humans as fresh water, in the form of either surface or ground water (Krchnak
    et al., 2002, UNESCO, 2006). Although there is currently sufficient water for
    essential activities (Blanco et al., 2009) including drinking, irrigation, and
    domestic and industrial use on a global scale, the spatial distribution of water
    suggests that, in many cases, it is not available where it is required." (Page
    1)'
  verbatim_quote3: Therefore, the potential for including existing WSN-controlled
    agricultural activities and water bodies, for integrated water quality management,
    is presented in this review. Later, research challenges in the existing applications
    of WSNs in this area are identified which, if addressed, would enable possible
    extension of the existing techniques to an integrated monitoring program. It is
    argued in this paper that it is not feasible to have a single monitoring system
    covering the entire catchment as individual stakeholder’s monitoring requirements
    vary as they undertake different activities. However, this enables a case for
    collaborative networks in a catchment to be proposed for enabling cooperation
    among individually networked activities/stakeholders (farming activities, water
    bodies) for managing water quality.

  analysis: 'Research indicates that automated systems for real-time irrigation management
    can potentially provide significant value to the agricultural sector, including
    increased productivity, reduced water usage, and enhanced crop quality. However,
    most related point solutions have failed to achieve their desired performance
    expectations due to technical challenges, such as a lack of in-depth understanding
    of routing architectures and protocols, and how these can be optimized for precision
    agriculture and greenhouse management applications. Thus, although IoT applications
    are founded on a common idea, each use case (e.g., Agri-IoT) varies based on the
    specific performance and user expectations as well as technological, architectural,
    and deployment requirements. Likewise, the agricultural setting is a unique and
    hostile area where conventional IoT technologies do not apply, hence the need
    for this tutorial.


    This tutorial addresses these challenges via the following contributions: (1)
    a systematic overview of the fundamental concepts, technologies, and architectural
    standards of WSN-based Agri-IoT; (2) an evaluation of the technical design requirements
    of a robust, location-independent, affordable, autonomous, and optimized Agri-IoT;
    (3) a comprehensive survey of the benchmarking fault-tolerance techniques, communication
    standards, routing and medium access control (MAC) protocols, and WSN-based Agri-IoT
    testbed solutions; and (4) an in-depth case study on how to design a self-healing,
    energy-efficient, affordable, adaptive, stable, autonomous, and cluster-based
    WSN-specific Agri-IoT from a proposed taxonomy of multi-objective optimization
    (MOO) metrics that can guarantee an optimized network performance. Furthermore,
    this tutorial established new taxonomies of faults, architectural layers, and
    MOO metrics for cluster-based Agri-IoT (CA-IoT) networks and a three-tier objective
    framework with remedial measures for designing an efficient associated supervisory
    protocol for cluster-based Agri-IoT networks.


    The analysis covers three main areas: Agri-IoT system fundamentals, challenges
    and proposed solutions, and systematic surveys on current fault-tolerance, routing
    and MAC protocols, and testbeds. The performance optimization and practical implications
    of the proposed contributions have been illustrated with a case study on precision
    irrigation. Our findings provide foundational insights for future research and
    development efforts in real-time, automated irrigation management systems, contributing
    to precision agriculture and improving agricultural productivity and sustainability.'

    \ tutorials have been authored on this subject, they present\nmere classifications\
    \ of communications trends on classical IoT [2,5–8] without any context-\nspecific\
    \ technical considerations of the critical design expectations in Figure 2. For\
    \ instance,\nthe authors in [2,6,7] examined IoT’s communication infrastructure,\
    \ platforms, standards,\ndevelopment trends, and possible network solutions in\
    \ agriculture. Similarly, the roles of\nindustrial IoT (thus, identification-based\
    \ IoT (example, RFID [6], WSN [9], QR codes [5],\nbarcodes) and communication-based\
    \ IoT (example, ZigBee [5], Z-wave [6], MQTT [5,6],\nLoRa [10], SigFox [11], BLE\
    \ [12], Li-Fi [5], Wi-Fi [13], Near-Field Communication (NFC) [5],\nand power\
    \ line area network) were reviewed in terms of current research trends, applications,\n\
    and main challenges in [5]. Although RFID tags and WSNs have similar data acquisition\n\
    capacities, the authors concluded that WSN technology is more energy-efficient\
    \ and suitable\nfor Agri-IoT than the costly RFID technologies [5]. Overall, Agri-IoT\
    \ technology has not\nyielded its intended paradigm transformation in the agricultural\
    \ sector due to several technical\nchallenges that have not received adequate\
    \ contextual research considerations [14]:\n1.\nThe agricultural setting is a\
    \ unique area where conventional IoT technologies do\nnot apply. Existing Agri-IoT\
    \ solutions are location-restricted because they are mostly\nbased on Wi-Fi or\
    \ cellular communication technologies and electricity grids with\nconstrained\
    \ coverages in Africa. A typical African agricultural setting lacks access\nto\
    \ reliable electricity and the Internet for cellular/Wi-Fi-based technologies,\
    \ and the\nintended users (farmers) of Agri-IoT technology are low-income earners\
    \ with limited\ntechnological expertise. Common Agri-IoT applications mainly utilize\
    \ architecture-\nrestricted, high-resource-demanding routing techniques (e.g.,\
    \ routing over low-power\nand lossy networks protocol (RPL)) and communication\
    \ standards (e.g., 4G, 5G, Zig-\nBee, LoRa, Wi-FI, and long-term evolution (LTE))\
    \ [15], which are difﬁcult to access\nin typical African farms. Consequently,\
    \ Agri-IoT users in Africa expect a context-\nrelevant solution that is affordable,\
    \ simple to deploy and operate by non-experts,\nlocation-unrestricted, supportive\
    \ of large-scale farm management, and based on freely\navailable technologies\
    \ that do not require licensing. Thus, they are unlike popular IoT\nuse cases\
    \ such as medical, vehicular, and industrial IoT, whose designs are mainly\naffected\
    \ by critical factors including security, stable connectivity, and interference,\n\
    respectively, Agri-IoT is compelled to drive on affordable battery-powered SNs,\
    \ which\nmake architecture, low-power communication technology, power optimization,\
    \ cost,\nfault tolerance, multihop routing, scalability, and environmental impact\
    \ critical design\nfactors in order to address its resource or deployment-induced\
    \ challenges [12,16,17].\n2.\nHigh susceptibility to faults and failures: Agri-IoT\
    \ networks are vulnerable to faults\nand failures since the resource-constrained\
    \ SNs are densely deployed in hostile envi-\nronments to autonomously operate\
    \ via a network supervisory protocol with limited\npost-deployment maintenance\
    \ services. This supervisory protocol must incorporate\nsufﬁcient power optimization,\
    \ auto-fault management (FM), and self-adaptability\ntechniques in order to achieve\
    \ the desired performance expectation. Due to the lack of\nan in-depth and context-relevant\
    \ tutorial that bridges the gap between theoretical tax-\nonomies and real-world\
    \ designs, most canon Agri-IoT testbed solutions, such as those\nauthored in [1,10,11,17–20],\
    \ suffered abrupt failures during outdoor deployments.\n3.\nAgri-IoT technology\
    \ lacks comprehensive context-based synthesis from SN de-\nsign to ﬁeld deployment.\n\
    The power- and resource-constrained SNs that form\nthe WSN-based Agri-IoT network\
    \ in the aforementioned context require limited\ndata transmission rates, computational\
    \ capabilities, memory capacities, commu-\nnication distance, and operational\
    \ stability. Consequently, the associated routing\nprotocol [9,12,17,21], communication\
    \ technology, and routing architecture [22–24]\nmust support mechanisms that ensure\
    \ packet size and communication distance mod-\neration [16], efﬁcient channel\
    \ access management (CAM), and SN’s tasks manage-\nment. It is not a mere application\
    \ of conventional IoT to a farm, as many authors\nattempted [1,10–12,17–20,23,25,26],\
    \ which lacked application-speciﬁc requirements\nsuch as dense network inter-connectivity,\
    \ higher information perceptibility, compre-\nIoT 2023, 4\n268\nhensive intelligence\
    \ services, remote monitoring, smart decision making, and the\nexecution of precise\
    \ control/actuation actions on the farm.\n4.\nSuperﬁcial consideration of desired\
    \ communication technologies of Agri-IoT with-\nout considering the cluster-based\
    \ architecture: To date, Agri-IoT-related surveys and\ntutorials focused on high-power-demanding\
    \ communication technologies (Wi-Fi and\ncellular-based technologies), the centralized\
    \ architecture-constrained ZigBee standard,\nand the operation principles of conventional\
    \ IoT as authored in [1,10,11,14,18,19]\nwithout an in-depth consideration of\
    \ the unique case of Agri-IoT. It is well estab-\nlished that the cluster-based\
    \ architecture is the best candidate for Agri-IoT applica-\ntion [12,16,17,24];\
    \ however, there are no systematic evaluations to cement this fact.\nFor instance,\
    \ most benchmarking WSN-based IoT testbed solutions are founded on the\nZigBee\
    \ IEEE 802.15.4 communication standard and high-resource-demanding Wi-Fi,\ncellular-based,\
    \ and 6LoWPAN/IPv6 routing standards. These standards also thrive on\nwired or\
    \ ﬁxed IP-based infrastructural backbones, total Internet/electricity coverage,\n\
    and highly complex graph-based and centralized routing protocols [1,10,11,14,18,19],\n\
    leading to a lack of global signiﬁcance because Africa, which is the focus of\
    \ this study,\nhas less than 50% electricity/Internet coverage [27]. Also, ZigBee,\
    \ Wi-Fi and cellular-\nbased communication technologies with centralized or ﬂooding-based\
    \ routing archi-\ntecture [1,10,11,14,18,19] are capital-intensive, complex to\
    \ manage, location-restricted,\nenergy-inefﬁcient, and over-reliant on ﬁxed supporting\
    \ infrastructure. Therefore,\nan in-depth contextual assessment of how low-power\
    \ communication standards such\nas LoRa, SigFox, and Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE)\
    \ evolve in cluster-based Agri-IoT\n(CA-IoT) networks can be of immeasurable beneﬁts\
    \ to the IoT community and farmers.\n5.\nThe role of Agri-IoT in eliminating food\
    \ insecurity, improving crop quality, alle-\nviating global poverty, and increasing\
    \ agricultural production volumes has been\nunderestimated [2,7,8,10,16,28,29].\
    \ The agricultural sector, which has been hindered\nby climate change, is the\
    \ largest global employer [3]. To revitalize this sector, CA-IoT\nhas emerged\
    \ with the most promising opportunities to address food and employ-\nment insecurity\
    \ issues and improve crop quality and economic conditions for the\nfarmers. However,\
    \ these beneﬁts have not been fully realized due to insufﬁcient\nresearch publicity.\n\
    To the best of our knowledge, no survey or tutorial articles have sufﬁciently\
    \ consid-\nered these technical issues and provided sufﬁcient technical guidelines\
    \ for the designers of\nAgri-IoT systems to make well-informed decisions in order\
    \ to achieve satisfactory network\nperformance. Additional realistic research\
    \ is needed regarding the contextual evaluation\nof SN design and deployment factors,\
    \ fundamental network design concepts and require-\nments, multi-objective optimization\
    \ (MOO) analysis of the parameters for designing the\nassociated routing protocol,\
    \ and efﬁcient operational metrics of the WSN sublayer of the\nAgri-IoT using\
    \ the cluster-based architecture. In addition, the assessment of the possibil-\n\
    ity of using low-power and accessible wireless communication technologies such\
    \ as BLE\nvia cluster-based architecture to achieve a complete infrastructure-less,\
    \ cheaper, energy-\nefﬁcient, self-healing, adaptive, and robust Agri-IoT network\
    \ is imperative. Furthermore,\na broader contextual overview covering all vital\
    \ aspects such as the fundamental concepts\nof Agri-IoT, technical design requirements\
    \ of SNs and WSN-based Agri-IoT, surveys of the\nbenchmarking communication standards,\
    \ routing protocols, and testbed solutions, and an\nin-depth case study on how\
    \ to design a self-healing, energy-efﬁcient, adaptive, and CA-IoT\nbased on the\
    \ performance and users expectations are illustrated in Figure 2. Such a refer-\n\
    ence document can help support researchers when they attempt to accurately model\
    \ and\noptimize the performance of Agri-IoT [14] so that the performance gap between\
    \ the simu-\nlated networks and the realized Agri-IoT testbed solutions [1] can\
    \ be addressed. By way of\naddressing these technical challenges, this tutorial\
    \ presents the following contributions:\n•\nPerform an in-depth synthesis and\
    \ review (1) the basic concepts of Agri-IoT, (2) the\ncomprehensive design considerations\
    \ of these networks, (3) the technical design re-\nIoT 2023, 4\n269\nquirements\
    \ of Agri-IoT, and (4) the up-to-date research progress on routing techniques,\n\
    communication standards, and testbed solutions of WSN-based Agri-IoT.\n•\nSystematically\
    \ survey the benchmarking of WSN-based IoT networks’ communication\nstandards,\
    \ FM techniques, routing and MAC protocols, and realization testbeds to\nrespectively\
    \ uncover the appropriate communication requirements for Agri-IoT, unveil\nthe\
    \ root faults and possible remedies in the WSN sublayer, derive a generalized\n\
    taxonomy of routing architectures, and deﬁne appropriate routing paradigms for\n\
    WSN-based Agri-IoT using the core PHY layer design metrics: affordability, self-\n\
    healing capacity, energy-efﬁciency, location independence, and network adaptability.\n\
    •\nSystematic synthesis of canon cluster-based routing protocols to uncover the\
    \ plethora\nof possible research gaps, derive a realistic taxonomy of MOO metrics\
    \ and propose\npossible MOO remedies that can be implemented using CA-IoT routing\
    \ architecture\nfreely available low-power communication standards.\n•\nProposition\
    \ of MOO-induced guidelines in the form of open issues that can help Agri-\nIoT\
    \ designers to build adaptive, robust, fault-tolerant, energy-efﬁcient, affordable,\n\
    and optimized CA-IoT networks in both simulation and real-world implementations.\n\
    Overall, this tutorial is motivated to provide a contextualized, in-depth understanding\n\
    of this technology and assist the reader in designing robust, affordable, and\
    \ optimized Agri-\nIoT networks that can act as reliable game-changers to avert\
    \ the stipulated challenges. Also,\nthe critical design, deployment, and QoS requirements\
    \ of WSN-based Agri-IoT networks\nfrom theoretical modeling to real-world deployment\
    \ are unveiled in order to bridge the\nexisting gap between the theory and practice\
    \ of this technology [1,14].\nThe remainder of this paper is organized into the\
    \ following sections: Section 2\nprovides a brief background comparative overview\
    \ of WSN, IoT, and Agri-IoT technologies,\nwhile Section 3 focuses on their components,\
    \ protocols, architectural layers, and proposed\narchitectural layers for WSN-based\
    \ Agri-IoT technology. Section 4 presents the detailed\ncontextual design and\
    \ implementation requirements of Agri-IoT networks, while Section V\ndeduces the\
    \ unique characteristics, challenges, and proposed performance expectations of\n\
    the associated routing protocols for the WSN sublayer of Agri-IoT. Sections 6–8\
    \ present\nsystematic surveys on routing protocols, FM techniques, and the canon\
    \ real-world testbed\nimplementations of WSN-based Agri-IoT solutions. Section\
    \ 9 examines how the above\ndiscussions have evolved using a case study of cluster-based\
    \ Agri-IoT (CA-IoT) for precision\nirrigation.Section 10 unveils open issues and\
    \ future works, while Section 11 concludes\nthe paper.\n1.1. Comparative Overview\
    \ of WSN, IoT, and Agri-IoT Technologies\nA comparative overview of the underlying\
    \ technologies (i.e., WSN, IoT, and Agri-\nIoT) forming the WSN-based Agri-IoT\
    \ are compared from the perspective of architectural\nvariations, users’ expectations,\
    \ and design and implementational differences in Table 1.\nAs depicted in Figure\
    \ 3, WSNs are formed by spatially distributed, autonomous,\nresource-constrained\
    \ SNs that wirelessly interconnect to communicate their sampled data\nto a BS\
    \ for further monitoring or event tracking purposes without necessarily requiring\n\
    the Internet. The main components of the WSN are the SNs, the BS/gateway, and\
    \ the\nevent sampling/routing software that supervises the entire network process.\
    \ A node\nmay route data directly or via relay SNs to the BS based on its location\
    \ and assigned\ntasks. The BS locally takes actionable decisions and execution\
    \ of the actuation actions.\nAlthough the WSNs are resource-constrained and fault-vulnerable,\
    \ they constitute the\ninevitable part of this technology [2] and the underlying\
    \ innovation of the WSN-based\nAgri-IoT framework. In contrast, classic IoT consists\
    \ of IoT devices that sense and transmit\ntheir sampled information directly or\
    \ via telemetry to the Internet for monitoring or event-\ntracking purposes, mostly\
    \ via the centralized routing architecture. Like BS in WSNs, IoT\ndevices can\
    \ connect to the Internet/IoT cloud via ﬁxed-line (thus, for a factory), 5G/4G/LTE\n\
    cellular/mobile networks, or Wi-Fi for further processing, storage, and decisions/actions.\n\

    Figure 4. Conceptual framework: Agri-IoT-based farm monitoring and control cycle.\n\
    The main hardware components of an Agri-IoT framework, as presented in Figure\
    \ 3\nand Table 2, include the WSN (i.e., comprising the ﬁeld-deployed SNs or IoT\
    \ devices),\na base station (BS) or gateway or actuator controller, cloud servers,\
    \ and the user’s monitor-\ning/control devices. The on-farm participants (e.g.,\
    \ SNs and BS) in Agri-IoT are mostly\nbattery-powered and must be equipped with\
    \ sensing, computing, and communication\nabilities to form infrastructure-less,\
    \ robust, self-healing, and self-conﬁgured WSNs for data\ncollection and event\
    \ management [33]. The core units of the SNs in Figure 3c and the BS\nare compared\
    \ and contrasted in Table 2. As the framework in Figure 3a depicts, the IoT\n\
    devices can sense, process, and transmit their sampled data directly to the Internet\
    \ or IoT\ncloud without a gateway, whereas the SNs in WSN-based Agri-IoT perform\
    \ likewise via\na BS. This resource-sufﬁcient BS interfaces between the IoT cloud/user\
    \ and the WSN or\nactuator control system. It can also process the received data\
    \ and locally execute actionable\ndecisions via the actuator of the farm event\
    \ being monitored. The received data can also be\nrelayed to the analytical data\
    \ engines in the IoT cloud via a wired and wireless medium for\nfurther processing\
    \ and actions [13]. The resource-constrained WSN sublayer mainly uses\ndata-centric\
    \ protocols due to the SNs’ high deployment densities, high network dynamics,\n\
    and limited power supply of SNs. Although data-centric protocols are fragile and\
    \ not\nstandardized, they are more suitable than the high resource-demanding ID-based\
    \ IPv4 or\nIPv6 protocols in the addressing space of the WSN-based Agri-IoT.\n\

    \ WSN and IoT technologies into contextualized intelligent farm\nmanagement systems\
    \ to achieve higher event data quality and offer remote monitoring\nand control.\
    \ WSN-based Agri-IoT consists of the WSN sublayer, the gateways, the cloud\nservers,\
    \ and the remote interface application, as illustrated in Figures 3a and 5. Uniquely,\n\
    the current trends of Agri-IoT mandate that both intra-SN and BS–cloud communication\n\
    are based on low-power, ubiquitous, and freely available wireless standards [2].\
    \ Also,\nmost Agri-IoT solutions support bidirectional communications between\
    \ the BS/gateway\nand the cloud/users, whereby the BS updates the cloud/user database\
    \ and receives ac-\ntionable/control remote messages from the user or cloud analytical\
    \ decision results for\nactuation purposes. The WSN-based Agri-IoT is the most\
    \ dominant technology in the global\nsmart farming use cases in the agricultural\
    \ sector. The core tasks of SNs in a WSN-based\nAgri-IoT application, which are\
    \ frequently supervised by the associated routing protocol,\ninclude network construction/management,\
    \ data sensing, data processing/aggregation,\nfault tolerance, and communication\
    \ [9,12]. Also, the routing architecture must be supported\nby the associated\
    \ communication platform and the application-speciﬁc requirements of\nthe network.\n\

    \ WSN-based\nAgri-IoT requires holistic integrations of the expectations in Figure\
    \ 2.\n1.2. Classiﬁcations of IoT Applications and Speciﬁc Roles of Agri-IoT\n\
    Generally, IoT technology is application-speciﬁc. However, it has limitless applications\n\
    and roles in the smart world agenda. Based on their intended purpose, WSN-based\
    \ IoT sys-\ntems can be broadly classiﬁed into condition monitoring and event-tracking\
    \ categories [34],\nas illustrated in Figure 6.\nThe monitoring-based applications\
    \ involve real-time event data collection and analysis,\nsupervision, and operational\
    \ control of systems. In contrast, tracking-based applications\ntrack changes\
    \ in the phenomenon of interest, such as the locations of objects, persons,\n\
    transported goods, animals, and vehicles. Both application domains can be subdivided\n\
    into industrial, environmental, and societal IoT applications in Figure 6, where\
    \ speciﬁc\nexamples are provided for each application domain. For instance, monitoring-based\
    \ ap-\nplications may include indoor/outdoor environmental monitoring [6], industrial\
    \ process\nmonitoring [5,29], process control [2], greenhouse automation [7],\
    \ precision agriculture\n(e.g., irrigation management, crop disease prediction,\
    \ prediction of production quality,\nIoT 2023, 4\n274\nand pest and disease control)\
    \ [2,8], biomedical or health monitoring [8], electrical grid net-\nwork monitoring/control\
    \ [12,29], military location monitoring [9], and so forth. Conversely,\nspecific\
    \ examples of tracking-based applications may include habitat tracking, traffic\
    \ tracking,\nplant/animal condition tracking, and military target tracking, as\
    \ outlined in Figure 6.\n1/21/22, 10:55 AM\n701.svg\nEcology: Wildlife Tracking\n\

    \ \nFigure 6. Generalized taxonomy of IoT applications.\n1.3. Agri-IoT Roles and\
    \ Use-Cases\nThe concept of intelligent farming involves data acquisition, data\
    \ processing/planning,\nand smart control using the WSN and IoT technologies,\
    \ big data, and cloud computing\ntechniques to provide proﬁtable solutions, as\
    \ presented in Figure 7. These principal roles\nin Figure 7 deﬁne their use cases.\
    \ For instance, monitoring the state of crops or the\nclimate of the ﬁeld using\
    \ Agri-IoT technology can allow farmers to know precisely the\namount of pesticides,\
    \ water, and fertilizers required to attain optimal crop quality and\nproduction\
    \ volume. However, the QoS requirements, the routing techniques, architectural\n\
    requirements, and the operational dynamics differ from one use case to another.\
    \ This\ntutorial focused on the critical and unique design requirements of WSN-based\
    \ Agri-IoT,\nwhich is the backbone of the smart agricultural initiative [35].\
    \ The resulting use-cases in\nFigure 7 can be explained as follows:\n1.\nAgri-IoT\
    \ for Climate Condition or Agronomical Monitoring: This Agri-IoT system mostly\n\
    comprises BS (i.e., weather stations) and a deployed WSN. The analytical data\
    \ engines\nmine the sampled climate or crop condition data in the cloud to predict\
    \ future climate\nconditions and farm automation plans. The most suitable crop\
    \ and precise farming\npractices can then be predeﬁned to improve agriculture\
    \ production capacity and\nquality.\n2.\nAgri-IoT for Precision Farming: This\
    \ is the most famous application of Agri-IoT, whereby\nfarming practices (e.g.,\
    \ irrigation, fertilizer application, etc.) are precisely and accu-\nrately controlled\
    \ to optimize these resources. Here, the SNs are mostly ﬁtted with soil\nsensors\
    \ to collect a vast array of microclimatic data (e.g., soil moisture, temperature,\n\
    and salinity) that can enable farmers to estimate optimal amounts of water, fertiliz-\n\
    IoT 2023, 4\n275\ners, and pesticides needed by the crops to minimize resources’\
    \ costs and produce\nhealthier crops. Additionally, the BS controls the event\
    \ actuation system via accurate\ndata-driven real-time decisions on the crops\
    \ using climate data, crop growth data,\nand disease infection data.\n3.\nAgri-IoT\
    \ for Greenhouse Automation: The Agri-IoT-based approach provides more accu-\n\
    rate real-time information on greenhouse conditions, such as lighting, temperature,\n\
    soil condition, and humidity, unlike manual greenhouse management. This allows\n\
    precise remote monitoring and control or automation of all farming practices.\n\
    4.\nAgri-IoT for Livestock Monitoring and Management: In this system, SNs are\
    \ attached\nto livestock to monitor their real-time health, track their physical\
    \ location, and log\ntheir performance. This helps the farmer identify and isolate\
    \ sick animals to avoid\ncontamination and reduce stafﬁng expenses.\n5.\nAgri-IoT\
    \ for Predictive Analytics: This Agri-IoT system provides highly relevant real-\n\
    time data that can be analyzed to make essential predictions, such as crop harvesting\n\
    time, risk of disease infection, yield volume, yield quality, and yield vulnerability,\n\
    for proper planning.\n6.\nAgricultural Drones (Agri-Drones): Agri-Drones, such\
    \ as DroneSeed, are ﬁtted with\nmobile SNs and farming tools to collect agricultural\
    \ data or perform activities such\nas ﬁeld surveillance, crop planting, pest control,\
    \ farm spraying, crop monitoring, etc.\nFor example, for Agri-Drones, all the\
    \ above use cases utilize the WSN-based Agri-IoT\nframework.\n1/21/22, 11:01 AM\n\

    \ established that the existing real-world attempts of Agri-IoT could\nnot meet\
    \ both performance and user users’ expectations because they are founded on the\n\
    fundamental concepts and the operational principles of classic IoT and WSN technologies.\n\
    To effectively achieve the expectations in Figure 2, it is imperative to conduct\
    \ a systematic\nassessment of the related architectural layers in classic IoT\
    \ and propose a suitable option for\nthe WSN-based Agri-IoT ecosystem. Generally,\
    \ the conventional IoT ecosystem consists\nof the network architectural layers\
    \ and the data management platforms [2,7,8], which\nare further grouped into devices\
    \ (sensors, actuators, and gateways/BS), network (BS to\ncloud), platforms/applications’\
    \ cloud, and agents/users. Due to the domain-speciﬁc\nrequirements of IoT applications\
    \ and the incorporation of numerous heterogeneous devices\nIoT 2023, 4\n276\n\
    with application-speciﬁc requirements, there are generally no uniﬁed or standardized\n\
    IoT architectural layers. Therefore, most application-defined layers are frequently\
    \ adapted\nfrom the canon architectural layers, which include the three-layer\
    \ [5], the cloud-based [7],\nthe service-oriented architecture (SOA) [2,7], and\
    \ the fog-based [2,7,29], as illustrated in\nFigure 8.\n1/20/22, 8:49 PM\n714.svg\n\

    \ in the state of the art of IoT ecosystem.\nThe fog-based architecture was adapted\
    \ from the three-layer parent architecture to in-\nclude cloud computing by offering\
    \ computing, storage, and network information between\nthe clients and the cloud\
    \ services [29] in a decentralized manner. Here, cloud computing\nand fog/edge\
    \ computing architectures only differ in where data computing occurs. These\n\
    layers are not uniﬁed because the respective network layers do not cover all underlying\n\
    technologies that transfer data to all IoT platforms [5]. Additionally, they are\
    \ based on com-\nplicated centralized and ﬂooding-based routing architectures,\
    \ high-resource-demanding\nand capital-intensive Wi-Fi/cellular-based communication\
    \ technologies. As well, they\nrequire wired infrastructural support in the farm,\
    \ which is too complex, location-restricted,\nand capital-intensive for most low-income\
    \ and non-expert farmers to implement and\nmanage. Consequently, they are unsuitable\
    \ candidates for the resource-constrained SNs\nin WSN-based Agri-IoT. By implication,\
    \ there are no reference guidelines for designing\nAgri-IoT participants and supervisory\
    \ protocols, controlling the speed of packet delivery,\nsmoothing out SN’s integration,\
    \ unifying technology, and creating standardized Agri-\nIoT reference models,\
    \ among other considerations. In contrast, an Agri-IoT ecosystem,\ndepicted in\
    \ Figure 3, consists of:\n1.\nAgri-IoT network architectural layers: This shows\
    \ how the physical network elements,\nnetwork operation principles, and operational\
    \ techniques interact throughout the\nentire ecosystem.\n2.\nNetwork supervisory\
    \ software/routing protocol and routing architectures: This con-\ntains the virtual\
    \ arrangement of multiple network elements [8] and the event sam-\npling/routing\
    \ protocol that constructs the routing architecture, supervises sampling\nand\
    \ moderates all communications in the PHY layer.\n3.\nData management platform:\
    \ It hosts all high-resource-demanding data analytic en-\ngines, event databases,\
    \ and remote control algorithms in a cloud model.\n2.1. Proposed Architectural\
    \ Layers for WSN-Based Agri-IoT\nIn designing an efﬁcient Agri-IoT system of global\
    \ signiﬁcance, it is imperative to\npropose suitable architectural layers and\
    \ evaluate how the various components interact in\nthese layers. With the emerging\
    \ advances in low-power, freely available, and boundless\ncommunication standards\

    \ Agri-IoT ecosys-\ntem is proposed in the left side of Figure 5. The center portion\
    \ of Figure 5 presents the key\ncomponents/technologies required in each layer,\
    \ while the Things taxonomies of hardware\ncomponents from the related literature\
    \ [4,8,29] are depicted on the right portion of Figure 5.\nThe underlying layers\
    \ in our four-tier layers in Figure 5 can be elaborated on as follows:\n1.\nIntegrated\
    \ Application and Management Layer: This operates all agriculture-related\napplications\
    \ that interface between the user (for example, farmer) and the Agri-IoT\nsystem\
    \ to make decisions and execute remote actions to keep their crops or animals\n\
    healthy. This layer manages the entire Agri-IoT system and its application-speciﬁc\n\
    functionality, high-resource-demanding applications, and core business model in\
    \ the\ncloud. This layer’s security requirements are crucial to the next sublayer;\
    \ however,\nthese are beyond the scope of this research. The business or management\
    \ sublayer\nmaintains end-to-end data integrity and security by ensuring that\
    \ data are transferred\nto the correct user. It also ensures that the correct\
    \ user executes the actuation.\n2.\nInformation Management Layer: This handles\
    \ data processing, storage, and other special-\nized cloud services and functionality\
    \ that make precise, actionable decisions. In Agri-\nIoT, the sensory data are\
    \ preprocessed locally to optimize communication power\nbut can be further processed\
    \ using analytic engines in the cloud for better decision\nmaking and remote monitoring\
    \ and control. This layer can be embedded in the above\napplication layers and\
    \ hosted in the cloud in a typical Agri-IoT ecosystem.\n3.\nNetwork Management\
    \ Layer: This layer discovers, connects, and translates devices over\na network,\
    \ and it coordinates with the above application layers. It also contains the\n\
    BS, which interfaces the resource-constrained WSN and cloud information network.\n\
    By convention, the WSN sublayer must utilize low-power communication standards\n\
    such as Zigbee, SigFox, LoRa, BLE, Z-Wave, SigFox, and IEEE P802.11ah (low-power\n\
    Wi-Fi), while the BS-to-Cloud connectivity can be achieved via the traditional\
    \ cellular\nnetworks, satellite networks, Wi-Fi, LAN, WAN, and LoRa, among others.\
    \ Unlike clas-\nsic IoT, Agri-IoT requires that the BS-to-Cloud connectivity utilize\
    \ low-power commu-\nnication standards. Also, since every communication standard\
    \ for the resource-limited\nWSN sublayer comes with unique resource speciﬁcations\
    \ and design tradeoffs be-\ntween power consumption, routing architectural constraints,\
    \ and bandwidth [4,14,17],\nthe best connectivity option must be selected to achieve\
    \ the desired application goals.\nConsequently, the stated WSN-based connectivity\
    \ technologies can be classiﬁed using\nseveral distinct parameters, such as energy\
    \ consumption rates, uplink/downlink data\nrates, packet size, SN-count per BS\
    \ (gateway), network routing topology, the SNs’\nsensing range, the SNs’ transmitter/receiver\
    \ power, frequency bandwidth, channel\nwidth, etc. (refer to the right portion\
    \ of Figure 5).\n4.\nPhysical/Perception/Things Layer: This layer refers to the\
    \ ﬁeld and all devices such as\nSNs, actuators, RFID tags, sensors, and edge devices\
    \ that interact with the environment.\nThis layer senses and collects the necessary\
    \ information from the connected devices in\nthe WSN sublayer to the BS. In Agri-IoT\
    \ networks, the sampled microclimatic data\ncan be processed and stored on the\
    \ local BS, the cloud, or both. The activities in the\ncloud or application layers\
    \ are beyond the scope of this tutorial.\n2.2. Associated Hardware Components\
    \ and Technologies Required in the Proposed Architectural Layers\nTo precisely\
    \ model and design an Agri-IoT network of desired expectations (refer to\nFigure\
    \ 2) using the proposed architectural layers shown in Figure 5, the knowledge\
    \ of the\nprincipal components and technologies used in each of these layers and\
    \ how they interact\nand adapt for their intended functions is imperative. As\
    \ depicted in the middle of Figure 5,\nthe Agri-IoT ecosystem is composed of the\
    \ following core components/technologies:\n1.\nThings: The Things unit is the\
    \ physical interface between the tracked/monitored asset\nand the BS or actuator\
    \ controller, which aligns with the physical or perception layer. It\ncomprises\
    \ the monitored/tracked asset (for example, ﬁeld, crop, or animal), the SNs,\n\
    or the entire IoT devices making up the WSN (for example, SNs, actuators, IoT-enabled\n\
    IoT 2023, 4\n278\ndevices, WSNs, and other smart devices), the event sampling,\
    \ and routing technology\nin the WSN. Since the SNs constituting this unit are\
    \ resource-constrained, freely\navailable communication standards such as Zigbee,\
    \ BLE, Z-Wave, and IEEE P802.11ah\n(low-power Wi-Fi) are the most suitable for\
    \ both SN–SN and SN–BS communications.\nThe Things unit accesses the cloud/Internet\
    \ via gateways (BS).\n2.\nGateway (BS): The BS interfaces the WSN out in the ﬁeld\
    \ and the applications situated\nin the cloud servers. This unit aligns with the\
    \ network management and actuator\ncontrol layer shown in the middle of Figure\
    \ 5. The WSN sublayer may have more\nthan one BS(s), each with the capacity to\
    \ handle most resource-demanding com-\nputational tasks besides actuation execution,\
    \ network construction, scheduling of\nevent sampling, and network supervision\
    \ services. They may also allow bidirectional\ncommunication with the cloud/user\
    \ and WSN. Similar to standalone IoT devices,\nthe BS can be equipped with 4G/5G/LTE/NB-IoT,\
    \ cellular-based, Wi-Fi, LoRaWAN,\nor wired ethernet communication technologies\
    \ to interact with the cloud, and low-\npower communication standards such as\
    \ LoRa, low-power Wi-Fi, SIGFOX, UMTS,\nBLE, and Zigbee (Figure 5) to communicate\
    \ with the sensor ﬁeld. However, Agri-IoT\nnetworks require that both upper-layer\
    \ and lower-layer communication technolo-\ngies of the BS should be low-power,\
    \ freely available, easy to deploy and manage,\nand platform-independent. The\
    \ BS may preprocess or relay the raw data to the cloud\nfor remote data processing.\
    \ The BS(s) locations are strategically chosen to optimize\nnetwork communication\
    \ costs.\n3.\nIoT Cloud: The Cloud unit aligns with the applications layer. It\
    \ consists of an on-\npremises or remote server farm that hosts the applications\
    \ layer, event data analytic\nengines, security protocols, robust IoT applications,\
    \ user interface, and event database.\nThe high resource-demanding data-processing\
    \ tasks are mostly executed by well-\nequipped cloud-hosted applications to manage\
    \ and store huge amounts of data,\nprovide monitoring and data analytical services,\
    \ enable communication with devices,\nand manage information access. The merits\
    \ of edge computing can be exploited to\nensure that large amounts of data are\
    \ post-processed off-device to reduce the response\ntimes of the cloud.\n4.\n\
    User Interface: With the aid of a web or mobile app, the user or farmer can live-\n\
    monitor the farm’s conditions and execute control actions. Additionally, a presentation\n\
    or business intelligence layer may be added to coordinate the activities of non-technical\n\
    business users through dashboards and reports rather than with the application\n\
    layer itself.\n2.3. Quality Expectations of Agri-IoT’s Architectural Layers\n\
    Although there is no uniﬁed, certiﬁed, and ﬂexible Agri-IoT architecture layer,\
    \ any\nsuitable options deduced from the benchmarking architectures in Figure\
    \ 8 must satisfy\ncertain quality requirements, including:\n1.\nSimultaneous data\
    \ acquisition, analysis, and control from many sensors or actuators.\n2.\nMinimization\
    \ of huge raw data transmissions via data aggregation techniques to\nmaximize\
    \ actionable information quality.\n3.\nProvision of reliable network architecture\
    \ that supports energy-efﬁcient routing, sta-\nble connectivity, self-adaptability,\
    \ fault tolerance, operational simplicity/ﬂexibility,\nplatform independence,\
    \ affordability, and location independence of Agri-IoT designs.\n4.\nSupport for\
    \ automated/remote device management and updates.\n5.\nEasy integration of each\
    \ layer with existing applications and other IoT solutions via\nspeciﬁed APIs.\n\
    6.\nUtilization of freely available, location-unrestricted, cheap, energy-efﬁcient,\
    \ and simple\nto deploy and manage by non-experts [4,29] underlying communication\
    \ technologies\nin the PHY and network layers as well as based on open standards\
    \ to guarantee\ninteroperability.\nIoT 2023, 4\n279\n3. Design and Implementation\
    \ of Agri-IoT Networks\nDespite the technical challenges associated with the WSN-based\
    \ Agri-IoT, its potential\ncontributions in the agricultural sector largely surpass\
    \ the least complex, capital-intensive,\npure IoT-based solutions, as illustrated\
    \ in Figures 3b and 7. Due to the broader applicability\nand higher signiﬁcance\
    \ of the WSN-based Agri-IoT networks relative to the classic IoT\nnetworks, this\
    \ study focuses on the former technology whose design and implementation\ninvolve\
    \ four crucial phases, namely:\n1.\nCustom-building of robust, affordable, energy-efﬁcient,\
    \ location-independent, and\nadaptive SNs and a BS that can form an infrastructure-less\
    \ and easily manageable WSN.\nThe SNs and the BS must consist of cost-effective,\
    \ architecture-deﬁned, and context-\ndeﬁned components so that the system operates\
    \ stably and efﬁciently, becomes afford-\nable to farmers, and easily integrates\
    \ to any real-world scenario without any expensive,\nﬁxed/wired backbone connections.\
    \ The low-power capabilities of the SNs help to\neasily integrate them into any\
    \ precision farms and greenhouses to operate over the\nentire crop season without\
    \ many technical hindrances.\n2.\nPhysical deployment of the SNs in the ﬁeld,\
    \ selection of the WSN’s communication\ntechnology, and design of a suitable supervisory\
    \ protocol to coordinate the construc-\ntion of appropriate event routing architecture,\
    \ the duty-cycle schedule of event sam-\npling to the BS, fault management, data\
    \ management, and network maintenance.\nAdditionally, a range of techniques such\
    \ as network participant mobility, cross-layer\ndesign, MAC techniques, data aggregation,\
    \ self-healing techniques, nodes’ duty-cycle\nschedule, security measures, localization,\
    \ and communication speciﬁcations of the\nSNs can also be exploited in the associated\
    \ routing protocols.\n3.\nSelection of appropriate BS/gateway communication technology\
    \ and design of a\nsuitable higher protocol to update the cloud database and execute\
    \ the actuation\nactions based on users’ requests or decisions on processed event\
    \ data.\n4.\nDesign of data analytical engines and applications in the cloud and\
    \ users’ remote\nmonitoring and control interface app, which is beyond the scope\
    \ of this tutorial.\nThese call for a systematic application-speciﬁc assessment\
    \ of the hardware components\nselected for every use case.\n3.1. Sensor Nodes\
    \ Design Considerations\nAs illustrated at the bottom of Figure 3, a node for\
    \ the WSN-based Agri-IoT network\nconsists of four main units, which include the\
    \ following:\n1.\nSensing Unit: This unit interfaces with the physical environment\
    \ and records the\nphysical phenomenon of interest. The type of sensor is application-speciﬁc\
    \ and can\nbe contact-based or non-contact-based. For instance, the STEMMA soil\
    \ moisture\nsensor and the DHT22 sensor can be used to sample environmental temperature\
    \ and\nhumidity (refer to Figure 3c).\n2.\nController Unit: This unit hosts the\
    \ processor, storage, and connection pins for the\nother units and all auxiliary\
    \ peripherals. The suitable controllers for building Agri-IoT\nSNs are Arduino-based\
    \ and Raspberry-Pi-based (refer to the bottom of Figure 3) due\nto their ability\
    \ to withstand extreme weather conditions. However, other off-the-shelf,\napplication-speciﬁc\
    \ controllers such as the ProPlant Seed Rate Controller, John Deere\nGreenStar\
    \ Rate Controller, Viper Pro multi-function ﬁeld computer, Radion 8140,\nTrimble\
    \ Field-IQ, etc. are also available.\n3.\nCommunication Unit: This unit is the\
    \ principal determinant of the node’s power\nconsumption, operational stability,\
    \ and affordability, as well as the routing architecture\nin the associated supervisory\
    \ protocol. The bottom of Figure 3 shows the available\ncommunication technologies,\
    \ but an Agri-IoT-based SN demands an energy-efﬁcient,\naffordable, freely available,\
    \ simple, and reliable communication standard. Conse-\nquently, LoRa, BLE, ZigBee,\
    \ LoRaWan, and SigFox are the best candidates based on\nIoT 2023, 4\n280\nthe\
    \ support of the routing architecture of the resulting WSN, but the selection\
    \ must be\njustiﬁed from the technology requirement metrics via a decision matrix.\n\
    4.\nPower Unit: Since the SNs are mostly battery-powered, the appropriate battery\
    \ size\nand probable energy-harvesting techniques must be determined during the\
    \ SNs’\ndesign according to the intended network lifespan and stability requirements.\
    \ Modern\ntrends in battery power banks with integrated solar-based energy-harvesting\
    \ systems\nand power ratings above 30,000 Ah are available.\nWhen selecting hardware\
    \ components, adequate caution should be taken to avoid unit\nincompatibility,\
    \ high operational complexities, unsuitable operational thresholds, and high\n\
    energy consumption, among others. This implies that high component survivability\
    \ and op-\nerational stability under different environmental conditions and the\
    \ application speciﬁcities\nare vital to monitor.\n3.2. Wireless Spectrum and\
    \ Core Communication Platforms of WSN-Based Agri-IoT\nThe wireless electromagnetic\
    \ (EM) spectrum, which has invisible, ﬁnite radio fre-\nquencies for wireless\
    \ communication, can be licensed and sold exclusively by speciﬁc\nproviders or\
    \ unlicensed for free usage. For instance, the Industrial, Scientiﬁc, and Medical\n\
    (ISM) frequency band (e.g., Bluetooth classic, BLE, Wi-Fi, ZigBee, and LoRaWAN)\
    \ is an\nunlicensed microwave frequency band clustered around 2.4 GHz and globally\
    \ reserved for\napplications such as Agri-IoT. Table 3 presents the various bands\
    \ and their applications.\nA suitable candidate for a given Agri-IoT application\
    \ is based on several factors, such\nas communication and the route architectural\
    \ requirements, power consumption, cost,\nand environmental adaptability impacts.\n\

    \ SNs and Designing the Supervisory\nSampling/Routing Protocol\nAfter custom-building\
    \ or selecting off-the-shelf SNs, the next activity is to deploy\nthe SNs on the\
    \ ﬁeld and design a contextualized supervisory protocol to coordinate the\naforementioned\
    \ network’s activities. The SNs’ deployment in the ﬁeld can be either random\n\
    or deterministic. Both options require different methods to optimize the resulting\
    \ network’s\nperformance. For instance, under the deterministic approach, the\
    \ optimal parameters such\nas node uniformity and density must be predeﬁned based\
    \ on the distance thresholds of the\nassociated communication technology (i.e.,\
    \ connectivity/distance range), the SNs’ resource\noptimization mechanisms, the\
    \ type of routing architecture, and the sensing range of the\nphysical parameter\
    \ to be measured. Since communication is the principal power consumer,\nthe best\
    \ ways to conserve power are to minimize communication distance and data sizes\
    \ as\nwell as operate the SNs in the appropriate sleep–active duty cycles using\
    \ a cluster-based\nrouting architecture [9,24,26].\nBeyond the physical installation\
    \ of the SNs at their most suitable in-range locations,\nthe remaining activities,\
    \ such as network construction, event sensing, data management, FM,\nIoT 2023,\
    \ 4\n281\nnetwork maintenance, sleep–active duty-cycle scheduling of SNs for sampling,\
    \ network adapt-\nability to turbulent and scalable conditions, power-optimization\
    \ mechanisms, and network\nreconfiguration, among others, are controlled by the\
    \ associated routing protocol [12,16,17,26,36].\nThis places crucial merits on\
    \ the physical locations of the SNs in the ﬁeld, thorough synthe-\nsis of network\
    \ design factors, and assessment of available routing architectures/techniques,\n\
    since this protocol manages all post-deployment tasks. This can be summarized\
    \ into\nthe core objectives of the routing protocol and its architecture, which\
    \ include power op-\ntimization, self-healing of any faults without the obstruction\
    \ of its normal operation,\nand self-adaptability to all turbulent and scalable\
    \ conditions. From the analysis above,\nwe can derive the critical primary factors\
    \ to consider when designing a routing protocol\nfor Agri-IoT networks, which\
    \ are presented in Figure 9 and grouped into the following\ncategories: SNs speciﬁcations,\
    \ security issues, application-speciﬁc factors, communication\nstandard compatibility\
    \ and capacities, and other auxiliary factors. At the PHY layer level,\nwhich\
    \ is the focus of this tutorial, these critical factors can translate into the\
    \ stipulated core\ndesign objectives, which can be addressed via phase-based multi-objective\
    \ optimization\n(MOO) formulation frameworks [12,23,24,37].\n1/21/22, 10:18 AM\n\

    \ 2023, 4\n283\nCost or Affordability of the Resulting Agri-IoT System: In addition\
    \ to being\ninfrastructure-less, ﬂexible, self-healing, adaptive, and energy-efﬁcient,\
    \ a WSN-based\nAgri-IoT must consist of cost-effective hardware and software components\
    \ so that the\nsystem is affordable for farmers, since existing real-world solutions\
    \ are too expensive and\ncomplicated [1,14]. Additionally, the installation, operational,\
    \ and maintenance costs of\nthe resulting WSN-based Agri-IoT network must be kept\
    \ to a minimum so that it can be\neasily acquired.\nSecurity Issues in Agri-IoT:\
    \ Security is still a challenge in classic IoT systems that\nhandle sensitive\
    \ information, especially during cloud communications. Although Agri-\nIoT networks\
    \ lack the requisite resource capacities in most large-scale, broadcast-based,\n\
    distributed, and infrastructure-less WSN systems to achieve adequate data conﬁdentiality,\n\
    authenticity, integrity, and other security requirements, the security of the\
    \ agricultural\ndata is rarely a priority [2,4]. Nevertheless, the associated\
    \ routing architecture, such as\nthe clustering architecture, has an embedded\
    \ capacity to resolve on-site security issues.\nIn addition, both on-site and\
    \ remote information access types (e.g., via a smartphone or\ndesktop computer)\
    \ must be selected based on solid internal infrastructure and security\nprecautions\
    \ to secure unwanted access to sensitive information.\nThe Application-Speciﬁc\
    \ Factors: As indicated in Figure 9, the application-deﬁned\nfactors vary based\
    \ on the Agri-IoT application, the ﬁeld settings, network maintenance prac-\n\
    tices, intended event routing architecture, and network participants’ mobility,\
    \ among other\nfactors. However, the routing protocol must incorporate all relevant\
    \ operational efﬁciency\nfactors of the routing software design objectives. Since\
    \ the collected ﬁeld data itself cannot\nmake sense without using analytic data\
    \ engines and predictive algorithms in machine learn-\ning, the BS or the application\
    \ layer in the cloud should deﬁne appropriate data-processing\nframeworks to obtain\
    \ accurate, actionable decisions from the collected data.\nCommunication Standards\
    \ of Agri-IoT Devices: The power-constrained WSN sub-\nlayer of Agri-IoT network\
    \ places hard restrictions on operational states of SNs’ radio\ntransceivers,\
    \ code space, and processing cycles as well as memory capacities of SNs to\nenhance\
    \ power savings [9,12,23]. The type of communication technology selected for a\n\
    typical Agri-IoT is the principal predictor of its routing architecture, affordability,\
    \ simplicity,\nadaptability, power-saving capacity, location independence, self-healing\
    \ capacity, and event\ndata quality [12,16]. Consequently, power and routing architectural\
    \ limitations constrain\nthe network design requirements. Despite the aforementioned\
    \ technical challenges on\nthe network’s operational efﬁciency, interconnected\
    \ SNs that form the WSN are expected\nto withstand extra operational disruptions\
    \ caused by unfavorable weather conditions in\nthe ﬁeld [2,4]. Consequently, the\
    \ de facto PHY-layer communication standards for this\nlow-power, low bandwidth,\
    \ and distance-limited communication Agri-IoT devices/SNs\nhave been the energy-efﬁcient\
    \ platforms such as BLE, LoRa, Sigfox, and NB-IoT. Also, a suit-\nable MAC technique\
    \ is imperative in the routing architecture to curb all channel access\nchallenges.\
    \ For instance, the ZigBee/IEEE 802.15.4 standard focuses on the physical and\n\
    the MAC layer speciﬁcations for WSNs, and it also supports the sleep–active or\
    \ duty-cycle\nscheduled operation modes of SNs to enhance energy savings in centralized\
    \ or mesh-based\narchitectures. BLE does likewise in the highly endowed cluster-based\
    \ routing architecture.\nConsequently, Agri-IoT network designers must make the\
    \ most appropriate and critical de-\ncisions regarding the network’s communication\
    \ requirements when designing the routing\nprotocol. Using Table 4, WSN-based\
    \ Agri-IoT designers can make realistic design decisions\nregarding energy-efﬁcient\
    \ multihop routing, architectural requirements of routing proto-\ncol, bandwidth,\
    \ routing table capacities, total communication cost, and the desired MAC\ntechnique.\
    \ Additionally, the physical conditions within the agricultural environment such\n\
    as atmospheric dust concentration, physical obstruction to wireless signal transmissions,\n\
    and the terrain need to be considered.\nAuxiliary Factors and Available Software\
    \ Tool: Finally, the auxiliary factors can be\nnon-exhaustive depending on the\
    \ designer’s ﬁnancial capacity, user interface, information\nrequisition model,\
    \ cloud activities, operational expectations, and the available software\nIoT\
    \ 2023, 4\n284\ntools. Additionally, an assortment of PHY-Layer design software\
    \ tools for Agri-IoT exper-\niments (thus, in both simulations and real-world\
    \ testbed deployments) that can be used\ninclude NS-3 [9,38], OMNeT++, MATLAB/Simulink\
    \ [9,12,39], Python [16], PAWiS [39],\nGloMoSim/QualNet [39,40], OPNET [12,39],\
    \ SENSE [37,39], J-Sim [39], Ptolemy II [39],\nShawn [9,39], and PiccSIM [12,39,41],\
    \ among others. The key features that are frequently\nconsidered when selecting\
    \ any of these software platforms include Python or MAT-\nLAB/Simulink compatibility\
    \ for software model and hardware prototype integration\nduring real-world operation,\
    \ compatibility with low-power communication standards\n(e.g., BLE, LoRa, ZigBee,\
    \ and SIGFOX), operating system support, programming lan-\nguage implementation,\
    \ the density of simultaneously simulated or ﬁeld-deployed SNs,\nco-simulation\
    \ with other hardware, documentation, easy access to upgraded versions,\nand installation\
    \ challenges [39]. MATLAB/Simulink and Python are the most commonly\nused experimental\
    \ tools, since these software tools are well-equipped with the stipu-\nlated features.\n\
    4. Unique Characteristics and Challenges of WSN Sublayer of Agri-IoT\nUnlike the\
    \ traditional IoT, which generally relies on ﬁxed hardware to route network\n\
    trafﬁc, a WSN sublayer of Agri-IoT combines automated sensing, computation, actua-\n\
    tion, and wireless communication tasks into the SNs that are spatially distributed\
    \ across\nthe farm to autonomously form an infrastructure-less WSN [31]. A node\
    \ may perform\nadditional tasks such as local data processing (data aggregation),\
    \ network construction,\ndata redundancy, error control, data routing (e.g., in\
    \ multihop networks), and network\nmaintenance practices based on the network\
    \ size, application speciﬁcity, and associated\nrouting techniques. Also, the\
    \ WSN can be equipped to observe heterogeneous conditions\nsuch as temperature,\
    \ humidity, sound, color, location, light, vibration, and motion, using a\nwide\
    \ variety of sensors contained within a task-scalable SN. Therefore, assuming\
    \ that the\naccuracy and precision of event data in upper layers are preserved,\
    \ the Agri-IoT’s lifespan\nand its operational efﬁciency are rooted in the WSN’s\
    \ robustness. Thus, a deeper contextual\nexegesis into the design and maintenance\
    \ of this sublayer is imperative. As opposed to con-\nventional IoT and wireless\
    \ ad hoc communication networks, the operational efﬁciency of\nthe WSN sublayer,\
    \ as well as Agri-IoT, hinge upon some application-speciﬁc characteristics\nand\
    \ resource-constrained factors such as:\n•\nHigher SN Deployment Densities: Generally,\
    \ SNs are densely deployed in either a deter-\nministic or random manner to provide\
    \ the desired redundancies, spatial variability of\nsoil, topography, distributed\
    \ monitoring and processing, accurate and precise event\nreporting, and fault\
    \ tolerance. However, this mostly leads to undesirable transmission\noverlaps,\
    \ data redundancies from the simultaneous reporting of the same data, routing\n\
    interferences, and packet collisions due to connectivity issues and the coexistence\
    \ of\ncommon standards in the ISM band [42].\n•\nLimited Power Supply: The SNs\
    \ are frequently battery-powered, which does not only\nconstrain their data transmission\
    \ rate, computational capabilities, and communication\ndistance but also subjects\
    \ Agri-IoT to possible SN-out-of-service and data outlier\nfaults due to rapid\
    \ power depletion beyond certain thresholds [26,43]. Consequently,\nnetwork power\
    \ management through data-management-related, architectural-related,\nand communication-related\
    \ parameters has been one of the principal research focuses\nin WSN-based IoT\
    \ applications to improve network lifetime.\n•\nFault Management (FM) (i.e., fault\
    \ detection, fault tolerance, or fault avoidance): The\nresource-constrained WSN\
    \ is highly vulnerable to faults and failures due to high\ndeployment densities\
    \ and a lack of post-deployment maintenance services [25]. Al-\nthough faults\
    \ are inevitable in Agri-IoT for the stipulated reasons, their occurrence\nrates\
    \ and effects on the network’s functionality can be minimized, avoided, or tolerated\n\
    without hindering the normal functionality of the network if the associated WSN’s\
    \ rout-\ning protocol is well-equipped with efﬁcient self-healing and fault-avoidance\
    \ (power-\nsaving) mechanisms [12].\nIoT 2023, 4\n285\n•\nSelf-Adaptability and\
    \ Scalability: Although WSNs are application-speciﬁc, the topologi-\ncal dynamism\
    \ is inevitable due to node failures, node mobility, and scalable conditions.\n\
    Therefore, the associated routing protocol and network architecture must adapt\
    \ to\nthese dynamic conditions using apt auto-reconﬁguration and reactive multihop\
    \ event\nrouting techniques [44,45].\n•\nNetwork Architecture: The underlying\
    \ routing protocol of the WSN sublayer constructs\na network architecture that\
    \ can be ﬂat, hierarchical (e.g., clustering, chain-based,\nand tree architectures)\
    \ or location-based. This routing architecture prescribes the\npossible measures\
    \ to achieve efﬁcient local data processing, network maintenance,\nscalability,\
    \ minimized communication overhead, prolonged network lifespan, and re-\nduced\
    \ network management complexities [25,36]. Therefore, a suitable network\ntopology\
    \ indirectly determines the resulting network’s ﬂexibility, scalability, reliability,\n\
    communication strategy/costs, and the quality of the reported event data [12].\n\
    •\nMostly Requires On-site Actuation: Regardless of where data are managed in\
    \ a typical\nWSN-based Agri-IoT, the actionable decision signal must be sent to\
    \ execute on-farm\nactuation.\nProposed Design Objectives of WSN-Based Routing\
    \ Protocols for Agri-IoT and\nRealization Mechanisms\nFrom the systematic evaluation\
    \ of the unique characteristics and challenges of the\nWSN sublayer, a three-tier\
    \ cluster-based framework that constitutes the condensed ex-\npected core design\

    \ protocols for Agri-IoT applications is demonstrated in Figure 10. Suppose the\
    \ corre-\nsponding remedies in Figure 10 are implemented in the associated routing\

    \ and strategies of WSN-based Agri-IoT routing protocols.\nThe importance of this\
    \ three-tier framework can be expanded on as follows:\n•\nAn adaptive and scalable\
    \ WSN-based routing protocol, as proposed in Figure 10, normally\nconstructs a\
    \ routing architecture that supports multihop routing, self-reconfiguration,\n\
    self-healing, and local network administration at a minimal routing table size,\
    \ commu-\nnication cost, and and control message complexity requirement. Since\
    \ communication\nIoT 2023, 4\n286\nis the principal power consumer, the operation\
    \ of the routing protocol must invlove\nfewer control messages. Also, it must\
    \ adapt to network turbulence due to SN failures.\nThe cluster-based architecture\
    \ exhibits the highest potential compared to related ar-\nchitectures [9,16,17,26].\
    \ The cluster heads (CHs) efﬁciently coordinate these activities\nby registering\
    \ and tolerating all dynamism resulting from SN-out-of-service faults,\nincreasing\
    \ the network size and SN density.\n•\nDue to the high vulnerability of SNs to\
    \ faults and failures, it is imperative to deploy\nsuitable FM techniques that\
    \ can detect, tolerate, or avoid possible root faults such\nas SN-out-of-service\
    \ and data outliers [25]. The adaptive clustering approach can\neffectively resolve\
    \ SN-out-of-service faults, while the threshold-based decision theory\nat the\
    \ local nodes and global levels can be suitable candidates for event data outlier\n\
    detection and correction in the PHY layer. Since power mismanagement is the root\n\
    cause of most faults and failures, the best fault-avoidance techniques optimize\
    \ the\nnodes’ power consumption rates.\n•\nFigure 10 also outlines the suitable\
    \ measures for power optimization in the WSN\nsublayer of Agri-IoT. In clustering\
    \ approaches, power consumption in the constrained\nWSN can be managed via message\
    \ complexity control, connectivity-related metrics,\nand communication-related\
    \ parameters by exploiting the clustering architecture [46].\nIn addition to local\
    \ data processing (data aggregation, data redundancy, and error\nchecks) and local\
    \ network administration (FM, adaptability to network dynamics),\nsuitable MOO\
    \ and multihop routing frameworks can be derived using the clustering\narchitecture,\
    \ total communication cost, and optimal cluster quality metrics to serve as\n\
    a design optimization guide for the simulation and real-world implementations\
    \ of the\nWSN phase of Agri-IoT.\nTo achieve the expectations in Figure 10, there\
    \ is a need for an architecture-speciﬁc\nmulti-objective assessment of the WSN’s\
    \ design cycle; from this, the associated parameters\nand theoretical models can\
    \ be derived and then theoretically optimized and validated\nexperimentally. A\
    \ novel holistic MOO framework can help realize these expected goals in\nboth\
    \ simulation and real-world Agri-IoT implementations. Consequently, there exists\
    \ the\nneed to carry out a systematic survey and assessment on existing routing\
    \ architectures, FM\nschemes, and routing protocols, and how these evolved in\
    \ existing real-world realization\ntestbeds of Agri-IoT. Such an in-depth literature\
    \ synthesis can help assess these qualitative\nperformance indicators constituting\
    \ the root QoS metrics in Figure 10 as well as deduce\napplication-speciﬁc guidelines\
    \ for improving CA-IoT networks using a precision irrigation\nsystem as a case\
    \ study.\n5. State of the Art on Routing Protocols for WSN-Based Agri-IoT Applications\n\
    In Agri-IoT, it is not simply a matter of applying IoT to a farm; contextual due\
    \ diligence\non architecture, communication standard, cost, actuator, performance\
    \ stability, control,\nand environmental impacts augment the routing protocol\
    \ requirements. This section\npresents a systematic synthesis of WSN-applicable\
    \ routing protocols under network ar-\nchitecture, the route discovery process,\
    \ and protocol operation as illustrated in Figure 11.\nTo help Agri-IoT designers\
    \ make well-informed decisions concerning architectural selection,\nwe classiﬁed\
    \ the canon protocols based on routing architecture, route-discovery process,\n\
    and operations in order to uncover their strengths, weaknesses, and contextual\
    \ reasons why\nthey can be adopted for Agri-IoT applications. Generally, event\
    \ routing in every protocol\ncan either be source-initiated or destination-initiated,\
    \ and the optimal path selection from\nthe constructed routing architecture can\
    \ also be broadcast-based, probabilistic, cluster-\nbased, or parameter-determined\
    \ using location-related, weight-based, and content-based\nmetrics [13]. Also,\
    \ routing protocols must commonly resist link failures using mechanisms\nthat\
    \ ensure balanced network-wide power depletion rates, energy-efﬁcient multihop\
    \ rout-\ning, and effective implementation of the indispensable QoS metrics presented\
    \ in Figure 10.\nThe related routing protocols can be classiﬁed as illustrated\
    \ in Figure 11.\nIoT 2023, 4\n287\nfile:///C:/Users/emman/Downloads/704.svg\n\

    This class of protocols presented in Figures 11 and 12 can be sub-grouped into\
    \ ﬂat-\nbased centralized or direct communication and decentralized [47] (e.g.,\
    \ ﬂooding/peer-\nto-peer/graphical/mesh-like architectures), hierarchical/cluster-based/tree\

    \ Sample network architectures: centralized-data-centric, cluster-based, and graph/ﬂooding-\n\
    based architectural frameworks of WSN sublayer.\nIoT 2023, 4\n288\nThe centralized\
    \ protocols route data to the BS via single-hop routing, while the ﬂooding\nand\
    \ graph-based protocols ﬂood data through multihop routing. The graph-based routing\n\
    protocols construct a reactive or proactive graphical routing architecture with\
    \ G(V, E)\nwhere a node and path represent the vertex and edges, respectively.\
    \ This method relies\non resource-intensive routing techniques from graph theory\
    \ used in classic IoT and ad\nhoc networks to transmit event data to the BS. In\
    \ contrast, the clustering/tree topology\ndepicted in Figure 12 groups the SNs\
    \ into either static or dynamic clusters, each with an\noptimally selected CH\
    \ to minimize the communication distances of the cluster’s member\nnodes (MN).\
    \ The CH is then tasked with aggregating the received readings from its MNs,\n\
    executing error and measurement redundancy checks, and communicating directly\
    \ (single-\nhop routing) or via a relay CH (RCH) using a multihop routing technique\
    \ to the sink\nnode or BS. However, the RCHs must be assigned fewer MNs to balance\
    \ the network’s\npower depletion rates, since aggregated packet forwarding inﬂicts\
    \ extra energy burden\non the RCHs [37]. Additionally, the CH can be equipped\
    \ to perform extra roles such as\nFM, coordination of the reclustering process,\
    \ network maintenance, relaying of aggregated\npackets in large-scale networks,\
    \ and management of network dynamism [12]. In general,\ncluster-based routing\
    \ protocols differ in terms of CH selection methods and coincide in\nterms of\
    \ intra-cluster and inter-cluster multihop routing, local data processing by the\
    \ CHs,\nand CH role rotation [47], which ensure balanced network-wide power depletion,\
    \ prevent\nabrupt power exhaustion, and lead to exponential energy savings [37].\n\
    Although the ﬂat-based architectures, such as centralized and ﬂooding (see Figure\
    \ 12),\ncan be easily implemented in real-world small-scale Agri-IoT networks,\
    \ they suffer severe\npacket collisions, communication bottlenecking at the BS,\
    \ and high inaptness for scalable\nor turbulent large-scale WSNs where energy\
    \ efﬁciency is a priority. Again, an optimized\nclustering approach can provide\
    \ an ideal topology for addressing the proposed expectations\nin Figure 10, and\
    \ it can also offer extra beneﬁts such as minimized communication cost,\nstabilized\
    \ network topology, efﬁcient load management, improved network maintenance,\n\
    and improved network trafﬁc and channel access management [37,48]. The main challenge\n\
    of the clustering method is how to achieve the desired cluster quality (e.g.,\
    \ optimal cluster\ncount and cluster size) so that the computational, bandwidth,\
    \ memory, and routing table\ncapacities of the resource-constrained CHs are not\
    \ exceeded. Typical examples of clustering\nprotocols are the LEACH family of\
    \ protocols, which include RCEEFT, ESAA, DEEC, SEP,\nand PEGASIS in [12].\nIn\
    \ location-based routing architectures, routing decisions are made either reactively\n\
    (e.g., Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector—AODV) or proactively (e.g., RPL—Routing\n\
    over Low-Power and Lossy Networks protocol), using the SNs’ location information.\
    \ This\nnormally results in a decentralized, graphical architecture. Since the\
    \ SNs that form the\nWSN are spatially deployed in the ﬁeld without any IP-addressing\
    \ schemes, location\ninformation is needed in order to establish communication\
    \ between the nodes in a location-\nbased architecture. The location information\
    \ helps eliminate unwanted transmissions by\ncollecting data from a speciﬁc region\
    \ of interest. This architecture suffers from routing\ndelays, high infrastructural\
    \ cost, extreme difﬁculties in deployment and management,\nand high energy waste\
    \ due to SNs’ long idling durations. However, they are the most\ncommonly used\
    \ protocol in existing ZigBee-based Agri-IoT testbed solutions [1,10,14,17].\n\
    Since this approach yields non-energy-aware architectures, it is not suitable\
    \ for Agri-IoT\napplications [12].\nIt is evident from the above discussions that\
    \ Agri-IoT-based network architectures\nmust be deﬁned by the associated routing\
    \ protocol using the design requirements in Figure 9\nas well as the application-deﬁned\
    \ requirements [49] in order to enhance the performance\nexpectations in Figure\
    \ 10. In addition, the routing architecture must not compromise on\nthe quality,\
    \ precision, and accuracy of the event information. It must be in unison with\
    \ the\napplication-speciﬁc requirements to address possible deployments- and network-induced\n\
    challenges, such as network turbulence and SN mobility.\nIoT 2023, 4\n289\n5.2.\
    \ Route Discovery-Based Protocols\nAs shown in Figure 11, route discovery-based\
    \ protocols focus on when the route for\ndata transmission is built and can be\
    \ grouped into proactive, reactive, and hybrid protocols.\nIn proactive routing\
    \ protocols, the routes are pre-created before they are needed.\nThese protocols\
    \ are table-driven, since every node stores a large routing table containing a\n\
    list of all possible destinations, next-hop neighbors to those destinations, and\
    \ the associated\ncosts of all next-hop options. Proactive protocols such as the\
    \ RPL and the APTEEN family of\nprotocols [15] make local routing decisions using\
    \ the routing table’s content. For instance,\nthe RPL operates as a distant-vector\
    \ protocol for IPv6 low-power devices, utilizes the\nZigBee/IEEE 802.15.4 standard\
    \ on established IP infrastructure, and also supports the\n6LoWPAN adaptation\
    \ layer. RPL creates a multihop tree routing hierarchy of SNs, such\nthat nodes\
    \ can send data through their respective parent nodes to the BS/sink node in a\n\
    ﬂooded manner (Figure 12). Similarly, the BS or sink node can send a unicast message\
    \ to a\nspeciﬁc SN in order to complete a bidirectional operational framework\
    \ of RPL. The optimal\ncommunication costs and routes are estimated by ranking\
    \ the associated objective function\n(OF) metrics, which can be single-objective\
    \ optimization, SOO metrics, or MOO metrics.\nThis routing over LLNs (RoLL) restricts\
    \ densely deployed and resource-limited SNs to\ncommunicate using peer-to-peer\
    \ or extended star network topologies [13]. Technically,\nRPL builds a directed\
    \ acyclic graph (DAG) with no outgoing edges from the root element\n(e.g., BS)\
    \ to eliminate loops. RPL is the primary underlying routing protocol in most failed\n\
    Agri-IoT testbed attempts. Although the proactive or RPL-based family of protocols\
    \ are\nrobust, reliable, scalable, and can relatively operate at minimized control\
    \ messages with the\nhelp of timers, they are not suitable for Agri-IoT networks\
    \ due to these technical challenges:\n•\nThe core of RPL/proactive protocols still\
    \ suffers from key challenges such as en-\nergy wastage, a lack of adaptability/scalability,\
    \ reliability, congestion, and security\nissues. Speciﬁcally, the energy expended\
    \ by RPL-inherited protocols to create routes\n(e.g., establish and maintain routing\
    \ tables) and transmit data can be too high for\nresource-constrained SNs in recent\
    \ Agri-IoT applications.\n•\nThe underlying technology of RPL (e.g., ZigBee, 6LoWPAN,\
    \ or IPv6) was designed\nfor energy-sufﬁcient devices with high processing and\
    \ memory capacities. Therefore,\nRPL is inapt for typical resourced-constrained\
    \ Agri-IoT networks (refer to Table 5).\n•\nThey require costly ﬁxed IP infrastructural\
    \ supports and utilize the centralized routing\narchitecture, which becomes practically\
    \ impossible to manage as the network scales.\nConversely, the source-initiated\
    \ reactive or on-demand routing protocols only create\nthe routes on-demand by\
    \ a source to send data to a receiver. Reactive protocols (e.g., Ad hoc\nOn-demand\
    \ Distance Vector, AODV Protocol [13]) have no speciﬁc procedures for creating\n\
    and updating routing tables with route information at regular intervals. For instance,\n\
    the AODV is a loop-free, self-starting, and reactive routing protocol meant for\
    \ LLNs\n(e.g., WSN-based IoT) that are characterized by node mobility, link failures,\
    \ and packet\nlosses. AODV mainly consists of the route discovery process (RREQ\
    \ and RREP messages)\nand route maintenance (RERR and HELLO messages). Although\
    \ reactive or AODV-based\nprotocols can adapt to network dynamics and eliminate\
    \ periodic updates, the associated\nﬂooding-based route–search process incurs\
    \ severe overheads resulting in high control\nmessage complexity, high route acquisition\
    \ latency, and high energy wastages due to longer\nSN idling periods. Consequently,\
    \ these protocols are unsuitable for power-constrained\nWSN-based Agri-IoT applications.\n\
    The hybrid-based routing protocols merge the features of both reactive and proactive\n\
    routing processes. However, hybrid protocols such as APTEEN [13] also require\
    \ expensive\nﬁxed infrastructural support, which renders them unsuitable for Agri-IoT,\
    \ even if the\ncombined merits of reactive and proactive protocols are exploited.\n\
    A comparative assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the parent WSN-based\n\
    routing protocols for Agri-IoT applications is illustrated in Table 5.\nIoT 2023,\

    \ protocols can be classiﬁed based on the operation or communication\nmodel employed,\
    \ which may include:\n•\nNegotiation-Based Protocols: These protocols exchange\
    \ negotiation messages or use\nmeta-data negotiations between neighboring SNs\
    \ before the actual data transfers to\nreduce redundant transmissions in the network.\
    \ A typical example is the SPIN family\nof protocols [13].\n•\nMultipath-Based\
    \ Protocols: These use multiple routes simultaneously to accomplish\nhigher resilience\
    \ to route failure (i.e., fault tolerance) and load balancing.\n•\nQuery-Based\
    \ Routing Protocols: These are receiver-initiated protocols whereby a desti-\n\
    nation node broadcasts a query to initiate a data-sensing task from a node through\
    \ the\nnetwork. A node having the data being queried sends it in response to the\
    \ query.\n•\nCoherent and Non-Coherent Protocols: The coherent routing method\
    \ forwards data for\naggregation after a minimum local pre-processing. However,\
    \ in non-coherent routing,\nthe nodes locally process the raw data before routing\
    \ to the BS for further processing.\n•\nQoS-Based Routing Protocols: These protocols’\
    \ purpose is to satisfy a speciﬁc QoS metric\nor multiple QoS metrics such as\
    \ low latency, energy efﬁciency, or low packet loss.\nThese protocols ensure a\
    \ balance between energy consumption and data quality in\nevery event-reporting\
    \ task.\nIn addition to route architectural construction and data transmission,\
    \ efﬁcient MAC\nmust be embedded in the routing protocol to manage the wireless\
    \ medium access and the\nduty-cycle/sampling schedules of the deployed SNs in\
    \ Agri-IoT networks. As opposed\nto classic IoT, the MAC techniques in Agri-IoT\
    \ are architecture-deﬁned by the associated\nrouting protocol to meet the energy\
    \ efﬁciency requirements of the network via channel\naccess management (CAM) and\
    \ the moderation of the active–sleep duty cycles of the\ndeployed SNs to save\
    \ extra energy. The next subsection presents a concise overview of\nMAC techniques\
    \ and their roles in WSN-based Agri-IoT networks.\n5.4. MAC Techniques and Requirements\
    \ for Agri-IoT\nNext to node deployment, the routing protocol deﬁnes the network\
    \ architecture and\nselects a suitable MAC technique and a communication pattern\
    \ for the routing architec-\nture. Unlike classic IoT, requirements for Agri-IoT\
    \ applications include a low control\nIoT 2023, 4\n291\nmessage complexity and\
    \ low latency MAC technique that moderates sampling schedules,\naccess to a shared\
    \ medium, transceiver operation modes, (e.g., packet transmission and\nreception,\
    \ retransmission, collision, over-hearing, overhead handling, and idle listening)\n\
    active–sleep duty cycles of the deployed SNs, and transceiver channels. Thus,\
    \ an MAC\nprotocol for WSN-based Agri-IoT applications must be architecture-speciﬁc\
    \ and adaptive\nto network dynamics such as data transmission errors, interferences/packet\
    \ collisions,\nand regular interfacing of the active–sleep duty-cycled schedules\
    \ of the SNs’ transceiver\nstates (e.g., transmitting state, receiving state,\
    \ idle state, and sleep state [52]) during packet\ntransmission and reception\
    \ in order to improve network throughput, energy efﬁciency,\nlatency, and other\
    \ QoS metrics.\nUnlike MAC protocols for classic IoT, an efﬁcient MAC technique\
    \ for Agri-IoT must\nensure exponential energy savings via channel assignment\
    \ management (CAM) and active–\nsleep duty-cycle coordination in both time and\
    \ channel perspectives. Based on these\ncommon dual tasks of Agri-IoT-based MAC\
    \ (thus, duty-cycle optimization—DCO and\nchannel access management—CAM), existing\
    \ IoT-based MAC techniques can be classiﬁed\nas illustrated in Figure 13 and the\

    \ surveyed core Agri-IoT-based routing protocols and evalu-\nated the parent protocols\
    \ (i.e., RPL, AODV, and LEACH/cluster-based families of protocols)\nfor classic\
    \ WSN-based IoT networks, of which LEACH-based methods are the best candi-\ndates\
    \ for the resource-limited WSN-based Agri-IoT. However, the RPL and AODV have\n\
    received more research considerations in terms of realizations in both simulations\
    \ and prac-\ntice [9,12,21]. Although the cluster-based architecture has unique\
    \ endowments for realizing\nthe proposed expectations in Figures 2 and 10, it\
    \ lacks an in-depth design synthesis in the\ncurrent state of the art that can\
    \ uncover its contextualized performance optimization modal-\nities for real-world\
    \ Agri-IoT applications. In addition, the deployment requirements with\ntrending\
    \ technologies such as BLE, LoRaWAN, SigFox, 5G, LoRa via Satellite, and NB-IoT\n\
    under both simulation and real-world operational conditions is imperative. Consequently,\n\
    the following sections present in-depth overviews on FM, the benchmarking of WSN-based\n\
    Agri-IoT testbed solutions, clustering methods in the existing state of the art,\
    \ and how\nthe possible deductions from these syntheses can evolve in a typical\
    \ case-study such as a\nWSN-speciﬁc Agri-IoT routing protocol for precision irrigation.\n\
    6. State of the Art on FM Techniques for Classic WSN Sublayer of IoT\nSince faults\
    \ and failures are inevitable in the WSN sublayer of Agri-IoT networks (refer\n\
    to Figure 10), it is imperative to reevaluate the faults, causes, types, strengths/weaknesses\n\
    of existing FM (i.e., fault detection—FD, fault tolerance—FT, and fault-avoidance—FA)\n\
    schemes, revisit their founding assumptions [71], and make appropriate recommendations\n\
    for Agri-IoT network designers. In this section, we establish the root source/cause(s)\
    \ of\nfaults in the WSN sublayer by assessing the behaviors of the different fault\
    \ types, examining\nthe extent to which the existing FM schemes address these\
    \ root faults, and exploring\nhow these schemes will evolve in realistic WSN-based\
    \ Agri-IoT networks based on their\ncore assumptions, control message overheads/complexities,\
    \ and energy-saving capacities.\nFrom this thorough assessment, this section proposes\
    \ practical fault-avoidance-based FM\ntechniques for the next generation of WSN-based\
    \ Agri-IoT.\n6.1. Systematic Overview of Faults, Sources, and Taxonomy of Faults\
    \ in Agri-IoT\nAccording to the fault–error–failure cycle depicted in Figure 14,\
    \ a fault can be defined as\nany impairment that causes a system to produce erroneous\
    \ results or leads to the failure of the\nentire system or specific components\
    \ [72]. The prevalence of faults in WSN-based Agri-IoT\nis primarily due to the\
    \ SN component malfunction, lack of post-deployment maintenance,\nor resource\
    \ exhaustion [73], which can lead to either impaired event data quality (thus,\
    \ sensory\ndata error/outlier) or SN-out-of-service (thus, the shortened lifespan\
    \ of SNs) [25].\nDue to the high susceptibility of WSNs to faults, the supervisory\
    \ routing protocol is\nexpected to incorporate efﬁcient FM mechanisms that can\
    \ guarantee optimum event data\nquality and network availability. By implication,\
    \ FM algorithms for WSNs must not be\nstand-alone as currently seen in the state\
    \ of the art [73]; instead, they must be an integral\naspect of the routing protocol\
    \ that agrees with the core participants of the PHY layer, such as\nthe SN, wireless\
    \ communication medium, and the BS. As illustrated on the left of Figure 15,\n\
    the WSN sublayer is the most prevalent source of faults in the Agri-IoT ecosystem,\
    \ in which\nthe SNs are the central origin of faults that can propagate to the\
    \ upper layers [25,43,73].\nThis is because the BS is resource-sufﬁcient mainly,\
    \ and the link’s reliability also hinges\nupon the SNs’ availability, as indicated\
    \ in Figure 15. At the local SN’s level, each unit\ndepicted at the bottom of\
    \ Figure 3 is a potential source of fault/failure, but the degree of\nprevalence\
    \ is frequently accelerated whenever power consumption is mismanaged through\n\
    the disregard of any of the network design requirements and deployment conditions\n\
    presented in later sections.\nThe different taxonomies of faults in the state\
    \ of the art of the WSN sublayer [44,71,73–77],\nas illustrated on the left side\
    \ of Figure 16, can be compared as follows:\nIoT 2023, 4\n295\n•\nHard or permanent\
    \ fault refers to the inability of a node to stay active and communicate\ndue\
    \ to resource exhaustion or component malfunction, while in soft or static faults,\n\
    nodes continue to work and communicate with other nodes, but they sense, process,\n\
    or transmit erroneous data [44,74].\n•\nThe authors in [75,78] categorized faults\
    \ as permanent (refers to SN-out-of-service\nfaults), transient (caused by temporary\
    \ conditions), intermittent (shows sporadic\nmanifestations due to unstable behavior\
    \ of hardware and software), and potential\n(due to depletion of hardware resources\
    \ [78]).\n•\nData inconsistency faults can also result from faulty sensing, processing,\
    \ and communi-\ncation, which is frequently caused by power depletion below a\
    \ certain threshold, while\npower failure occurs when a node exhausts its battery\
    \ power completely [43,77,79].\n•\nThe authors in [73] classiﬁed faults into software\
    \ and hardware faults based on soft-\nware and hardware impairments, respectively.\n\
    •\nAccording to [71], faults can be either time-based, due to the depreciation\
    \ of hardware\ncomponents with time, or behavioral-based, due to SNs’ inability\
    \ to cope with harsh\nenvironmental and operating conditions.\n1/20/22, 8:48 PM\n\

    \ in the state of the art and proposed fault taxonomies for WSN-\nbased Agri-IoT.\n\
    From the above deﬁnitions and the fault taxonomies on the left side of Figure\
    \ 16, it can\nbe deduced that hard, permanent, and static faults are practically\
    \ manifested as SN-out-of-\nservice, while soft, dynamic, and data-inconsistency\
    \ faults can be observed as data outliers.\nBoth SN-out-of-service and data outliers\
    \ are consequences of unit malfunction or resource\nexhaustion and can be permanent\
    \ or intermittent in behavior. Both conditions can impair\nthe quality of event\
    \ data and the global actionable decisions of the network. Therefore,\nthe quality\
    \ of FM schemes can be evaluated based on their capacities to effectively detect,\n\
    tolerate, or avoid SN-out-of-service and data outlier faults. In summary, most\
    \ FM schemes\nin the state of the art focus on their effects, instead of the root\
    \ faults, which are the ﬂaws in\nexisting FM schemes [25]. Additionally, since\
    \ the SN is the sole network device responsible\nIoT 2023, 4\n297\nfor event sensing,\
    \ data computation, packet forwarding, and communication in the WSN\nsublayer\
    \ of Agri-IoT, it is the principal source of faults in Agri-IoT networks. A new\
    \ fault\nclassiﬁcation framework shown in Figure 16 can be deduced from the above\
    \ analysis.\nSecondly, it is discernible that SNs’ power mismanagement is the\
    \ most prevalent\norigin of faults [43,80,81], which then propagate to the backend\
    \ or application level (refer\nto the right side of Figure 15). For instance,\
    \ communication, sensing, and computational\naccuracies of a node can be impaired\
    \ when the battery energy falls below certain thresh-\nolds [43]. Also, network\
    \ faults can be traced to power exhaustion and node failures, which\ncreate holes\
    \ in the topology that divide the network into multiple disjointed segments [43].\n\
    On that account, faults can be avoided in WSN-based Agri-IoT if the energy-saving\
    \ strate-\ngies presented in Figures 9 and 10 are effectively implemented.\nAdditionally,\
    \ any FM scheme or fault-monitoring mechanism, be it proactive, reactive,\npassive,\
    \ or active, must incorporate the following underlying qualities: thresholds that\n\
    represent the probable fault conditions without false alarms, fault discovery,\
    \ minimized\nmessage/time complexities, and self-healing and self-reconﬁguration\
    \ to neutralize the\neffects of the faults [43].\nFM Framework and Architectures\
    \ in WSN Sublayer of Agri-IoT\nAs illustrated in Figure 17, every FM scheme consists\
    \ of three main steps, which\ninclude fault detection (FD), fault diagnosis, and\
    \ fault recovery/tolerance (FT) [82,83],\nwhich always require input information.\
    \ These steps are implemented in a decision-making\nframework that involves four\
    \ major processes: data/information collection, FD model\nformulation, FD decision\
    \ and fault classiﬁcation, and tolerance of its effects using any of\nthe FT mechanisms\
    \ shown in Figure 17. Thus, the FD model detects the fault, the fault\ndiscovery\
    \ technique distinguishes that fault from false alarms, while the FT mechanism\n\
    helps to auto-heal and recover from the faults or failures [84]. Mainly, SN-out-of-service\n\
    faults are detected and tolerated using self-reconﬁguration techniques, whereas\
    \ data outlier\nfaults must strictly follow Figure 17.\n1/20/22, 8:49 PM\n4.svg\n\

    Figure 17. FM framework in WSN sublayer of Agri-IoT.\nIn addition, FM schemes\
    \ can be implemented using either a centralized or distributed\narchitecture [44,85,86].\
    \ In a centralized scheme, the FD/FT protocol is hosted and managed\non the BS,\
    \ whereas the distributed scheme hosts and manages this algorithm on the local\n\
    SNs [87,88] (see Figure 17). The centralized approach is simpler for small-scaled\
    \ networks\nbut suffers many technical challenges, such as common point failure\
    \ due to heavy message\ntrafﬁc at the BS and high SN energy waste. In contrast,\
    \ the distributed approach saves\npower and controls message trafﬁc on the BS\
    \ because it allows local decision and self-\nIoT 2023, 4\n298\nFD/FT with or\
    \ without neighboring. According to Figure 17, the distributed architecture\n\
    can be implemented in three major ways [43,89–91], which include self-detection,\
    \ neighbor\ncoordination, and the clustering approach. Since the basic design\
    \ requirement of a WSN-\nbased Agri-IoT is to maintain the healthy functionality\
    \ and longevity of the SNs and the\nBS, any post-deployment impairments that cannot\
    \ be self-ﬁxed must be tolerated to not\ninterfere with the core function of the\
    \ network. Therefore, any automated FT mechanism\nthat can be achieved through\
    \ the self-reconﬁguration and self-management for enhanced\nnetwork availability,\
    \ reliability, and dependability is encouraged in the WSN sublayer [92].\nAccording\
    \ to Figure 17, an efﬁcient WSN-based Agri-IoT, therefore, requires a calculated\n\
    mix of FT mechanisms based on the intended application.\n6.2. Systematic Survey\
    \ of Fault Management Schemes in WSN-Based IoT\nFM in Agri-IoT networks has not\
    \ received adequate conceptualized research con-\nsiderations. As a result, existing\
    \ Agri-IoT solutions inherit the FM propositions from\nthe traditional WSN-based\
    \ IoT networks, which have proven to be unsuitable [14]. This\nsubsection presents\
    \ a concise overview of these FM schemes, including their strengths,\nweaknesses,\
    \ and underlying theories/concepts. It then proposes a more suitable remedy for\n\
    WSN-based Agri-IoT technology. In canon centralized FM schemes (see references\
    \ in [93–97]),\nthe underlying FM algorithm is hosted and managed on the BS, while\
    \ the local SNs host\nand manage the FM algorithm in distributed architectures\
    \ [87,88]. Although the centralized\napproach is simpler for small-scale networks,\
    \ it suffers many technical challenges, such\nas common point failure due to heavy\
    \ message trafﬁc at the BS, management difﬁculties,\nand high energy wastages\
    \ on distant routing. This clearly explains why most outdoor\nAgri-IoT testbed\
    \ experiments in [1,10,11,14,18,19] experienced severe FM complications to\nthe\
    \ extent that the networks became infeasible to operate or manage at higher scalability\n\
    levels. However, the distributed approach (see references in [74,76,77,91,98–103])\
    \ saves\npower and controls message trafﬁc and workload on the BS because it allows\
    \ local decisions\nas well as local-FD/FT with or without neighboring nodes. The\
    \ distributed FD/FT scheme\ncan also be self-executed, neighbor-coordinated, or\
    \ clustering-aided [89–91]. Although the\nclustering-based FM architecture has\
    \ promising potential to improve energy conservation,\nnetwork adaptability, and\
    \ ease of implementation, it has not been extensively researched\nand exploited.\n\
    Again, distributed FD schemes are mainly established on the assumption that the\n\
    failure of SNs is spatially uncorrelated, while event information is spatially\
    \ correlated.\nTherefore, the FD’s decision framework is frequently modeled using\
    \ sensory data or statis-\ntical properties of the spatial or temporally correlated\
    \ SNs [79,104–106] from the immediate\nneighborhood of a node [74,103] or data\
    \ from farther SNs [107]. To date, the applicabil-\nity of these solutions to\
    \ the Agri-IoT context has attracted several technical challenges.\nConsequently,\

    \ and Their Shortcomings\nThe conceptual models/theories of the canon FD decision\
    \ frameworks and the associ-\nated shortcomings can be expressed as follows:\n\
    •\nStatistical approaches such as Neyman–Pearson formulation [116], Bayesian statis-\n\
    tics [77,103], and normal distribution test types (e.g., Thompson Tau statistical\
    \ test [105])\nare high-resource-demanding techniques that may apply to classic\
    \ IoT. Still, they are\nunsuitable for power-constrained Agri-IoT devices or SNs.\
    \ In addition to being stand-\nalone and without application speciﬁcity, these\
    \ methods operate at high computational\nand control message complexities. Their\
    \ operational efﬁciencies increase with increas-\ning data dimensionality and\
    \ also require a priori knowledge of data distribution,\nwhich is not possible\
    \ in many real-life applications of Agri-IoT networks. Additionally,\nthey rely\
    \ on predeﬁned thresholds to make local and global FD decisions. Therefore,\n\
    regardless of the extensive research considerations of these methods, they are\
    \ generally\nnot suitable for low-power IoT applications, of which Agri-IoT is\
    \ no exception.\n•\nGraph-based FM techniques lack precise criteria for outlier\
    \ detections [83,109], suffer\nhigher computational complexities, and also make\
    \ unrealistic assumptions about the\ndata distribution. In addition, these approaches\
    \ (e.g., De Bruijn graph theory [109]\nand depth-based techniques) are unsuitable\
    \ for multidimensional and huge datasets.\n•\nMachine learning decision concepts\
    \ such as the k-out-of-n and majority decision\nrule concepts [93], naive Bayes,\
    \ iterative algorithms [107], and neural network-based\ntechniques, among others,\
    \ are susceptible to high dimensional datasets, suffer high\ncomputational cost,\
    \ and rely on sensitive model parameters.\nIn addition to the stipulated shortcomings,\
    \ these benchmarking FM methods usually\nignore the sensory data correlation (i.e.,\
    \ attribute correlation, spatial correlation, and tem-\nporal correlation) properties\
    \ of SNs, require high communication overhead with high FD\ndelays [83], and normally\
    \ operate in an ofﬂine manner, which is inconsistent with the\nmodus operandi\
    \ of typical Agri-IoT. Hence, they are unsuitable for the recent low-power\nAgri-IoT\
    \ applications.\n6.4. Open Issues on Existing FM Solutions for Classic WSN-Based\
    \ IoT Networks and\nRecommended Design Guidelines for Achieving Efﬁcient FM in\
    \ WSN-Based Agri-IoT\nA fault in the WSN sublayer of Agri-IoT networks can be\
    \ manifested as a data outlier\nand SN-out-of-service or node failure, both of\
    \ which must be detected and resolved locally\nor globally using the spatially\
    \ correlated event information and efﬁcient threshold-based\ndecision frameworks.\
    \ Although there has been extensive research concerning FM schemes\nfor the WSN\
    \ sublayer, several technical challenges that require urgent contextual research\n\
    considerations exist. They include the following:\n1.\nMost faults in the PHY\
    \ layer of Agri-IoT originate from the SNs’ power exhaustion,\nwhich implies that\
    \ the best fault-avoidance techniques are those that optimize power\nconsumption.\
    \ However, most FM schemes waste more energy and make the net-\nwork prone to\
    \ more faults/failures via high control messages and computational\ncomplexities.\n\
    2.\nMost FM schemes exist as stand-alone frameworks without architectural consider-\n\
    ations and are founded on unrealistic assumptions, which make them difﬁcult to\n\
    incorporate into existing routing protocols.\n3.\nThe cluster-based routing architecture\
    \ is endowed with many untapped local/global FM\npotentials and fault-avoidance\
    \ capacities for the next-generation Agri-IoT. However, these\npromising potentials\
    \ have received the least contextualized research considerations.\nExisting FM\
    \ solutions are meant for resource-sufﬁcient and expensive classic WSN-\nbased\
    \ IoT, not resource-constrained, context-speciﬁc use cases like Agri-IoT networks.\n\
    Regarding these technical challenges, this tutorial presents the following design\
    \ guidelines\nfor building efﬁcient and realistic FM schemes for WSN-based Agri-IoT:\n\
    IoT 2023, 4\n302\n1.\nFM schemes must rely on realistic and contextual assumptions\
    \ in order to detect and\nauto-tolerate sensory data outliers and SN-out-of-service\
    \ faults in real-time routing\nprotocols with minimal message, computational,\
    \ and memory complexities. Such FM\nschemes will be suitable for all power-constrained\
    \ WSN-based Agri-IoT applications.\n2.\nFuture works on FM schemes must be embedded\
    \ into speciﬁc routing protocols so\nthat their adaptability to topological dynamism\
    \ and scalability in terms of network\nsizes and node densities can be assessed\
    \ in an unsupervised manner. Therefore, fault\ndetection and fault-tolerance schemes\
    \ based on simple threshold-based theories are\nthe best candidates for this context,\
    \ since the threshold boundaries of agronomical\nmetrics can be accurately computed\
    \ from the historical data of the location.\n3.\nFM schemes must incorporate redundancy\
    \ check mechanisms by exploiting spatial\nand temporal correlations among sensory\
    \ data.\n4.\nFM schemes should maintain a good balance between local and global\
    \ FDs as well as\na reasonable detection rate and false alarm rate.\n7. State\
    \ of the Art on Real-World, Canon WSN-Based Agri-IoT Testbed Solutions\nIt is\
    \ well documented that WSN-based Agri-IoT is the most reliable remedy for mitigat-\n\
    ing the negative impacts climate change has had on agricultural production, for\
    \ which many\narchitectural designs and testbed prototypes have been proposed\
    \ [12,36]. In addition, since\nthe autonomous, resource-constrained SNs in Agri-IoT\
    \ are expected to operate without\npost-deployment maintenance checks, the issues\
    \ of FM, power optimization, and self-\norganization during SN design and network\
    \ deployment cannot be ignored in existing\ntestbed solutions [12,117]. Essentially,\
    \ the results from most research projects on Agri-IoT\nrelied on simulation experiments\
    \ [1,10,14], which have retained the gap between the phi-\nlosophy of this technology\
    \ and the comprehension of its real-world behavior for a more ac-\ncurate performance\
    \ assessment. This section presents a systematic performance assessment\nof the\
    \ few real-world WSN-based Agri-IoT testbed solutions currently based on the classic\n\
    WSN-based IoT principles. To understand how the benchmarking realization testbeds\
    \ of\nAgri-IoT in [1,10,11,14,18,19] fared in real-world operational conditions,\
    \ the results from\ntheir respective performances are systematically evaluated\
    \ and summarized in Table 8. It\nwas discovered that the current benchmarking\
    \ testbed solutions in [1,10,11,14,18,19] are\ncapital-intensive because they\
    \ are reliant on ﬁxed/location-restricted backbone infrastruc-\ntures (see the\
    \ middle of Figure 3), too complicated to deploy and manage by even expert\nusers,\
    \ based on unrealistic indoor conditions which do not commensurate real-world\
    \ envi-\nronmental conditions, and based on the high- power-demanding centralized\
    \ or ﬂooding\narchitectures which further complicate network manageability when\
    \ up-scaled. A concise\nand systematic survey of these benchmarking real-world\
    \ Agri-IoT networks and their ﬂaws\nin the state of the art is summarized in Table\
    \ 8.\nAdditionally, it can be established from the comparative assessment of the\
    \ benchmark-\ning Agri-IoT testbeds in Table 8 [10,11,18,19] that the embedded\
    \ communication technology,\nevent routing architecture, and the SNs’ power management\
    \ are the core factors that made\nthem capital-intensive and complicated to both\
    \ experts and low-income farmers. Addi-\ntionally, self-healing, reconﬁgurability,\
    \ and adaptability mechanisms to faults were not\ndeployed [1,14,17]; hence, faulty\
    \ and turbulent conditions could not be tolerated. Further-\nmore, since the battery-powered\
    \ SNs rely on expensive Wi-Fi and cellular communication\ntechnologies that are\
    \ not freely accessible at all locations, the SNs exhausted their battery\nsupply\
    \ a few days after deployment. Similarly, those that relied on ZigBee/IEEE 802.15.\
    \ 4\ncommunication technologies with power-intensive 6LoWPAN or IPv6 protocols\
    \ restricted\nthe resulting network to drive on the problematic centralized or\
    \ ﬂooding architectures\nwithout any efﬁcient FM techniques. As a result, these\
    \ solutions used costly ﬁxed IP\ninfrastructural supports and the centralized\
    \ routing architecture, making them practically\nimpossible to manage as the networks\
    \ scaled. This is why the SNs unstably exhausted their\nbattery power and abruptly\
    \ abridged network lifespans [1,10,11,14,18,19].\nIoT 2023, 4\n303\nTable 8. Comparative\

    Therefore, the freely available low-power wireless technologies (e.g., LoRa, BLE,\
    \ 5G,\nZ-wave, NB-IoT, and SigFox) that are founded on a suitable routing topology\
    \ are the best\ncandidates for making this ubiquitous application [1,16] cheap\
    \ [1,20] and simple for all\nusers. Thus, the cluster-based topology is more pivotal\
    \ to addressing the above challenges\nof Agri-IoT [10,17] than the traditional\
    \ cellular and WiFi technologies that are inaccessible\nin many farms, depending\
    \ on their locations [10,20]. However, besides distance-power\nconstraints, architectural\
    \ support, and network manageability challenges, these freely\naccessible wireless\
    \ communication technologies have speciﬁc limitations, which include:\n1.\nZigBee\
    \ technology achieves the desired power savings only when deployed in star or\n\
    centralized topology [14], and it operates at its low-power distance range (10–100\
    \ m)\nin line-of-sight mode depending on the environmental characteristics.\n\
    2.\nLoRa is limited to low-density and ﬁxed network sizes (non-scalable), a low\
    \ data rate,\nand a low message capacity [14]. It may require registration and\
    \ expensive antennae,\ndepending on its operation location.\n3.\nSigFox supports\
    \ a very low data rate and requires registration. LoRa and SigFox\npossess complex\
    \ implementations because they both require speciﬁc modules to\nfunction and gateways.\n\
    4.\nWiFi, GPRS, cellular technologies, and NB-IoT are high power consumption standards\n\
    and location-/architecture-restricted.\n5.\nBLE has a short communication range\
    \ but supports clustering architecture, which is the\nmost optimal architecture\
    \ for ensuring the best operational efﬁciency of WSN-based\nAgri-IoT deployments,\
    \ since this architecture allows cluster isolation and management.\nTherefore,\
    \ a research opportunity exists for a ﬂexible, ubiquitous, realistic, energy-\n\
    efﬁcient, self-healing, simple, low-cost, cluster-based, and wireless outdoor-based\
    \ testbed\nthat consists of infrastructure-less, task-scalable, and wirelessly\
    \ conﬁgurable experimental\nSNs and a BS. It should also be deployed, re-deployed,\
    \ monitored, controlled, and managed\nby non-experts to operate stably throughout\
    \ the entire crop-growing season.\n8. Case Study: Cluster-Based Agri-IoT (CA-IoT)\
    \ for Precision Irrigation\nAs earlier established in Figure 2, the design and\
    \ implementation of Agri-IoT networks\nare driven by unique critical factors,\
    \ which are mainly determined by the associated\nrouting architecture, communication\
    \ technology, actuation management mechanisms,\nand environmental impacts. In\
    \ the operation phase, these factors constitute the speciﬁc\nobjectives in Figure\
    \ 10, which the supervisory routing protocol must address in order\nto optimize\
    \ performance efﬁciency and stability. As systematically established above,\n\
    the LEACH-inherited cluster-based architecture has the most promising potential\
    \ to address\nIoT 2023, 4\n304\nthese technical challenges. It helps to attain\
    \ high power optimization via communication\ndistance and packet minimization,\
    \ efficient network administration/adaptability, high event\ndata quality through\
    \ auto-FM, and local data quality management, as indicated in Figure 10.\nSo,\
    \ this section presents a systematic analysis of how the merits of this architecture\
    \ evolve\nin CA-IoT for precision irrigation use cases. Using the framework in\
    \ Figure 12, the cluster-\nbased architecture was pre-examined to uncover how\
    \ the fundamental Agri-IoT design\nrequirements and goals presented in the reference\
    \ frameworks in Figures 2, 9 and 10 can\nunfold into realistic multi-parametric\
    \ optimization metrics.\nThe conceptual architectural framework of the proposed\
    \ network, as illustrated in\nFigure 18, can be implemented using Arduino-based\
    \ or Raspberry Pi(RPi)-based micro-\ncontrollers, BLE and LoRa for intra-cluster,\
    \ inter-cluster, and BS–cloud communications,\nrespectively, and DHT22/STEMMA\
    \ soil moisture sensors for measuring the respective\nambient and soil microclimatic\
    \ parameters. Also, a unit cluster from Figure 18 detailing\nthe key network components\
    \ of MNs, CH, BS, and the ﬁeld-deployed precision irrigation\nsystem is shown\
    \ in Figure 19. It is assumed that the core units constituting the MNs, CH,\n\
    and BS, as illustrated in Figure 19, are optimally selected and designed after\
    \ Figure 2. Using\nFigures 18 and 19 as the reference architectural frameworks\
    \ for achieving our contextualized\nobjectives, this section presents an in-depth\

    \ 20a, the cluster features deﬁne the underlying connectivity\nissues, such as\
    \ cluster quality indices (thus, cluster count, cluster size) and intra-cluster\n\
    and inter-cluster communication types (thus, single-hop or multihop or both) [23,24].\n\
    From the network design viewpoint, the cluster quality depends on the optimality\
    \ of the\nCH count and cluster sizes, which in turn rely on the core design parameters,\
    \ such as the\nspatial density and uniformity of the deployed nodes, the speciﬁcation\
    \ of the wireless\ncommunication standard, the routing architecture, and the size\
    \ of the network [47]. Since\nthe deployment of SNs in a typical Agri-IoT can\
    \ be controlled, the stipulated cluster quality\nproperties can be optimized to\
    \ resolve connectivity issues in Figure 20b. In a randomly\ndeployed ﬁeld, these\
    \ cluster quality parameters can be optimized using a pairing-based SN\nduty-scheduling\
    \ mechanisms [9,12].\nSecondly, the CH features can be static, mobile, or role-rotated\
    \ in both homogeneous\nor heterogeneous networks [9,12] based on the SNs’ resource\
    \ hierarchy. Additionally,\nthe CHs can be assigned different tasks, such as data\
    \ aggregation, FM, coordinating\nnetwork reconﬁguration or duty cycling, and network\
    \ maintenance, depending on their\nresource capacities and network requirements.\
    \ This case study is based on static SNs and\nthe distributed network construction\
    \ approach (see references in [9,12,33,126–132]), where\nthe SNs locally manage\
    \ the entire clustering process, and a CH is elected without the entire\nnetwork’s\
    \ information.\nAs shown in Figure 20a, the clustering process can be characterized\
    \ by the clustering\nmethod/network type (thus, centralized or distributed), the\
    \ CH selection method, recluster-\ning or network adaptability to topological\
    \ or scalable conditions, and the complexities (thus,\ncontrol message and computational\
    \ complexities) of the entire network operation cycle.\nUnlike the static approach\
    \ with ﬁxed CH, the adaptive clustering approach selects CH\nbased on the current\
    \ network conditions and rotates this role. However, both approaches\ncan incorporate\
    \ self-reclustering techniques to self-heal SN-out-of-service faults. Data\noutlier\
    \ faults can be best detected and corrected using threshold-based decision theory\
    \ or\nspatial correlation methods with the least complexities. Due to the large-scale\
    \ and high\ndeployment densities of WSN-based Agri-IoT, the distributed clustering\
    \ process is more\nsuitable for enhancing local FM, scalability, network management,\
    \ and power optimization\nthan the centralized approaches [37,47].\nGenerally,\
    \ the CA-IoT network can be optimized by formulating the deduced optimal\ndecision\
    \ metrics in Figure 20a into a MOO framework and multihop routing model in\norder\
    \ to provide the guidelines for the design of the WSN sublayer of Agri-IoT. From\
    \ the\ncomparative evaluations of Figures 10 and 20a, a taxonomy of MOO metrics\
    \ for designing\nan efﬁcient WSN-based CA-IoT network is proposed in Figure 20b.\
    \ To enhance the clarity\nof the state of the art on cluster-based protocols and\
    \ justify the need for the proposed MOO\nmetrics, a comparative summary based\
    \ on the characterization parameters is presented in\nTable 9.\n8.2. CH Election\
    \ Techniques\nA CH selection process is very critical to the resulting network’s\
    \ performance efﬁciency.\nIn addition to centralized networks and the computationally\
    \ expensive fuzzy-based clus-\ntering approaches [133,134], the efﬁciencies of\
    \ all LEACH-inherited protocols are mainly\ndependent on their CH selection techniques\
    \ [47,49]. Therefore, the correct estimation of\nthe cluster quality metrics (i.e.,\
    \ CHs count and cluster size) is pivotal in attaining the\nobjectives in Figure\
    \ 10. With the aid of nodes’ residual energy and location metrics, the op-\ntimal\
    \ CH count and cluster size can be preset before network deployment. Currently,\n\
    these metrics are randomly selected using a probabilistic approach in LEACH-inherited\n\
    protocol [9,21] or derived using a deterministic or an attribute-based method\
    \ [47,135].\nHowever, the probabilistic clustering, such as the LEACH-inherited\
    \ protocols, is expected\nto perform better in terms of network lifespan, minimal\
    \ clustering overhead, improved\nconnectivity, network/coverage stability, low\
    \ latency, collision-free routing, load balanc-\ning, high network stability span,\
    \ and algorithmic simplicity if the optimal CH count was\nIoT 2023, 4\n308\npredeﬁned\
    \ correctly [136]. However, the CH count is randomly predeﬁned in these proto-\n\
    cols [9,21], which undermines the CH’s stability and the resulting architecture’s\
    \ optimality.\nThis challenge can be addressed via common CH selection metrics\
    \ including Euclidean\ndistance, intra-cluster/inter-cluster communication costs,\
    \ energy-harvesting capacities,\nand probabilistic factors. To date, the related\
    \ attempts in [49,126,137–139] only relied on\nthe SNs’ residual energy and location\
    \ information to re-elect CHs after the initial CH count\nis deﬁned, which cannot\
    \ be ideal for WSN-based Agri-IoT.\nFor instance, an active SN in a particular\
    \ round decides whether or not to become\na CH by choosing a random number (rn)\
    \ ranging between 0 and 1 and comparing the\nnumber with a speciﬁed threshold\
    \ Th. A node, therefore, becomes a CH for that round if\nrn < Th, where Th is\
    \ expressed as:\nTh =\n(\npd\n1−pd×(( f irst−round)mod 1\npd\n,\nif n ∈ G\n0,\n\
    otherwise\n(1)\nwhere pd is the desired percentage of CHs or CH count per round,\
    \ and G is the number of\nSNs that have not been a CH in the previous 1/p rounds.\n\
    The authors in [119] proposed a three-layered LEACH (TL-LEACH) that operates in\n\
    three functional phases—CH election, MN recruitment, and data transfer—to enhance\
    \ the\nenergy efﬁciency of LEACH. Their ﬁrst-level CH election approach modiﬁed\
    \ Equation (1)\ninto an enhanced threshold T(i), which is expressed as:\nT(i)\
    \ =\n(\n(r + 1) × mod( 1\np × p),\nif i ∈ G\n0,\notherwise\n(2)\nwhere p is the\
    \ CH count, r is the current round number, and G is the number of SNs that\nhave\
    \ not been a CH in the previous 1/p rounds. The second-level CHs are selected\
    \ from\nthe ﬁrst-level CHs based on the shortest distance to the BS to function\
    \ as aggregated packet\nforwarders or relay CHs (RCHs).\nThe authors in [120]\
    \ introduced energy (E(i)) and distance (D(i)) attributes into Equa-\ntion (1)\
    \ to improve the load-balancing merit of LEACH. The resulting Th is expressed\
    \ as:\nTh =\n(\npd\n1−pd[r×mod 1\npd ] × [E(i) + (1 − D(i))],\nif n ∈ G\n0,\n\
    otherwise\n(3)\nMultihop routing via relay CHs (RCHs) was recommended for distant\
    \ CHs in the\nfuture scope of [120].\nIn the LEACH presented with a distance-based\
    \ threshold (LEACH-DT) algorithm\nin [121], the probability of becoming a CH depends\
    \ on the relative distance between a\nnode and the BS. This algorithm differs\
    \ from the LEACH algorithm because the desired\npercentage of CHs (pi) is predeﬁned\
    \ using Equation (5), while the threshold T(I, r) is\nexpressed as:\nT(i, r) =\n\
    (\npi\n1−pi×[r×mod 1\npi ],\nif Gi(r) = 0\n0,\nif Gi(r) = 1\n(4)\nNote that the\
    \ terms retain their usual deﬁnitions, namely:\np(i) = k\nξi\n∑N\nj=1 ξj\n, 0\
    \ ≤ pi ≤ 1,\n(5)\nwhere\nξi = 1/ECH × di − Enon−CH,\n(6)\nThe variable di depicts\
    \ the distance between node i and the BS, and ECH and Enon−CH\nare the average\
    \ residual energies in CHs and non-CHs, respectively. The authors further\nIoT\
    \ 2023, 4\n309\nestablished the need for a multihop routing approach in simulations\
    \ and real-world WSNs\nto validate the countless theoretical propositions and\
    \ beneﬁts.\nIn the decentralized energy-efﬁcient hierarchical cluster-based routing\
    \ algorithm\n(DHCR) [123], SNs compete to become CHs. First, the BS broadcasts\
    \ a trigger message at a\nspeciﬁc range. The receiving nodes then compete to become\
    \ a CH by disseminating a new\nmessage containing their residual energies and\
    \ distances from the BS. Using this informa-\ntion, a neighboring node i within\
    \ the target range receives the message and calculates its\nCHSn f uni as:\nCHSn\
    \ f uni = a × Erei\nEmax\n+ b ×\n1\nDis − To − BSi\n,\n(7)\nwhere Erei and Emax\
    \ are the residual and initial energy levels of node i, respectively;\nDis − To\
    \ − BSi is the distance between node i and the BS, and a and b are real random\n\
    values between 0 and 1 such that a + b = 1. The values of Dis − To − BSi of node\
    \ i\nand its neighbors are compared, and the node with the highest Dis − To −\
    \ BSi value is\nselected as the CH. A ﬁrst-level CH broadcasts its residual energy,\
    \ neighboring node count,\nand distance from the BS via a speciﬁc route. The next-level\
    \ CHs receive the information\nand similarly repeat the procedure to ensure that\
    \ every node determines a redistributor\nCH to the BS at the same time. A redistributor\
    \ CH has more energy and fewer neighbors\n(neighboring degrees).\nHowever, the\
    \ Hamilton energy-efﬁcient routing protocol (HEER) [124] creates an\nentire cluster\
    \ of nodes, aggregates data, and transmits them to the BS via a Hamiltonian\n\
    path that has been created by the entire cluster of nodes and controls the cluster\
    \ size by\nselecting one node as the CH using the probability function p, which\
    \ can be expressed as:\np = Lmessage\nFmax\n(8)\nwhere Lmessage is the size of\
    \ every node, and Fmax is the maximum size of a frame. The\nHEER protocol creates\
    \ the clusters only once in the ﬁrst round based on LEACH, and it\nrole-rotates\
    \ the CHs per the energy on the Hamiltonian path after a determined period.\n\
    Similarly, the two-phased EAMR protocol [125] randomly preselects the CH. A CH\n\
    also selects its closest CH as its redistributor CH. The clusters are static over\
    \ the entire\nnetwork lifetime, and the CH role rotates randomly within the clusters\
    \ according to a cluster\nreplacement threshold. The new CH inherits the redistributor\
    \ role if the old CH had one.\nOverall, since the node location, residual energy,\
    \ and sleep schedule are indispensable in the\nCH selection process, the CH selection\
    \ methods proposed by the authors in [9,12,36,120,140]\nare recommended WSN-based\
    \ Agri-IoT applications.\n8.3. Challenges of Existing MOO Frameworks and Recommended\
    \ Future Works\nAs Figures 9 and 10 illustrate, the performance efﬁciency of an\
    \ infrastructure-less\nWSN-based Agri-IoT mainly depends on the embedded MOO remedies\
    \ in the associated\nsupervisory routing protocol [12]. Several MOO frameworks\
    \ have been researched since\nAgri-IoT networks are subjected to multiple design\
    \ and operational constraints. A MOO\nframework is expected to formulate multiple\
    \ objective functions from a set of MOO metrics\nto simultaneously optimize these\
    \ multiple objectives, such as the maximal energy savings,\nhighest connectivity,\
    \ best latency, highest reliability, and balanced SN power depletion\nrates across\
    \ the network. Although the MOO methods are the best candidates for Agri-IoT,\n\
    the existing MOO solutions used in Agri-IoT are adopted from traditional WSN-based\
    \ IoT\nwithout any contextual evaluation [12,16,26]. Consequently, they have not\
    \ fulﬁlled their\nintended purposes due to several technical challenges, including\
    \ the following:\n1.\nThey are limited to non-cluster-based network architectures,\
    \ which implies that the promis-\ning potentials of the clustering architecture\
    \ are not adequately exploited [9,12,50,51].\n2.\nThey are frequently implemented\
    \ in the operational phase of the network, which\nmakes it challenging to ﬁnd\
    \ global optimal solutions with a balanced tradeoff among\nIoT 2023, 4\n310\n\
    conﬂicting objective functions. The performance optimality of the Agri-IoT network\n\
    starts from the SN design.\n3.\nThey rely on high-resource-demanding algorithms,\
    \ such as mathematical programming-\nbased scalarization methods, multi-objective\
    \ genetic algorithms (MOGAs), heuristics/\nmetaheuristics-based optimization algorithms,\
    \ and other advanced optimization\ntechniques [23,26,48], making them unsuitable\
    \ for the battery-powered SNs in Agri-IoT.\n4.\nThere are no contextual MOO guidelines\
    \ based on Figure 20 to govern the PHY-layer\ndesign of Agri-IoT to achieve global\
    \ optimal solutions with a balanced tradeoff among\nconﬂicting objectives. Consequently,\
    \ there are conﬂicting scenarios in existing MOO\nsolutions [50].\nTherefore,\
    \ there is an urgent demand for a realistic low-power MOO framework for\nCA-IoT\
    \ networks that is founded on the core WSN design metrics and MOO taxonomy\nmetrics\
    \ in Figure 10 and the top of Figure 20, respectively. The following section assesses\n\
    how evaluations and deductions evolve in a typical event sampling and routing\
    \ protocol\nin a CA-IoT network for precision irrigation system management.\n\
    9. Design of WSN-Speciﬁc CA-IoT Routing Protocol\nThis section proposes a CA-IoT-based\
    \ supervisory routing protocol that supports\nstatic SNs, rotatable/ﬁxed CH roles,\
    \ and enhanced SN resource management under the\ndeterministic deployment approach.\
    \ This can improve energy savings, connectivity, dis-\ntance moderation, and multihop\
    \ inter-cluster communication in the resulting network.\nThe operational cycle\
    \ and the embedded activities of our WSN-based CA-IoT protocol for\nprecision\
    \ irrigation application, as illustrated in Figure 21, include the following:\n\
    1.\nNetwork Construction or Setup Phase: This phase involves network modeling,\
    \ CH election,\nand cluster formation, which is explained in Figure 21. The active–sleep\
    \ duty-cycle\nscheduling ensures the SNs only switch to active mode during their\
    \ scheduled sampling\ndurations. In randomly deployed WSNs, redundant event reporting\
    \ can be avoided\nusing a correlated pairing-based active–sleep duty-cycle scheduling\
    \ approach in [12].\nThe optimal CH count and cluster size must be predeﬁned from\
    \ the resource capacities\nof the SNs. After the initial CH election, the MNs\
    \ are recruited and assigned their\nrespective sampling and intra-cluster communication\
    \ timeslots.\n2.\nSampling, Data Management, and Transmission Phase: The tasks\
    \ executed in this phase\ninclude event sampling, intra-cluster and inter-cluster\
    \ data transmissions, data outlier\nFM, and event data redundancy management.\
    \ Since microclimatic soil parameters do\nnot change swiftly [1,14], sampling\
    \ can only be scheduled during the day at 3-hourly\ntime intervals. In addition\
    \ to power optimization, the clustering approach provides\nsuperb potential for\
    \ both local and global FM using threshold-based FM theory and\nspatial correlation\
    \ techniques. Based on the architecture in Figure 19 and the resource\nlimitations\
    \ of the SNs, it is recommended that the communication beyond the BS or\ngateway\
    \ can utilize LoRa or Wi-Fi AirBox, whereas the intra-cluster and inter-cluster\n\
    communications must be the freely available low-power BLE technology, since it\
    \ is\nthe most suitable for the clustering architecture.\n3.\nNetwork Maintenance\
    \ and Reclustering Phase: This phase resolves all unforeseen topolog-\nical dynamics\
    \ caused by the SNs’ failures, network scalability, node mobility, and un-\nexpected\
    \ operational ﬂaws, without interfering with the normal network functionality\n\
    via adaptive reclustering, self-healing, and multihop routing techniques [12,23,24].\n\
    Here, a parent CH coordinates the election of child CHs (CCHs). While all non-CCHs\n\
    switch to sleep mode, the CCHs recruit new MNs using location and residual energy\n\
    parameters, assign them their respective sampling timeslots, and repeat Phase\
    \ 2 after-\nward, as shown in Figure 21. SN-out-of-service faults are auto-detected\

    \ suitable MAC method, a low-power wireless communication standard, data\naggregation\
    \ with data redundancy checks, and CH role rotation, among other factors.\nAlthough\
    \ the various sections of the deduced MOO metrics have been implemented in our\n\
    CA-IoT operational cycle, the most desired performance can be optimally attained\
    \ when\nthe MOO metrics are modeled into their respective objective functions,\
    \ and their optimal\nvalues are determined and implemented in both simulation\
    \ and testbed experiments in\nfuture works. Also, a realistic multihop routing\
    \ framework can also be inculcated into this\nprotocol for large-scale applications.\n\
    10. Open Issues and Future Works: Cluster-Based WSN-Speciﬁc Agri-IoT Networks\n\
    This tutorial has ﬁrmly established that the WSN-based Agri-IoT is an indispens-\n\
    able component of smart or precision farming and greenhouses, despite its resource-\
    \ and\ndeployment-induced challenges [12,26,141]. Unlike the conventional IoT,\
    \ Agri-IoT is com-\npelled to drive on batteries and affordable task-scalable\
    \ SNs. However, it must meet the\nexpectations in Figure 2 to guarantee a stable\
    \ performance. The cluster-based routing\ntechnique has emerged with promising\
    \ potential to mitigate these challenges. However,\nresults from existing testbed\
    \ solutions in this study show otherwise due to the absence of a\ncontextualized\
    \ in-depth overview of Agri-IoT as well as the following open issues which\nhave\
    \ not received extensive contextual research considerations in Agri-IoT applications:\n\
    1.\nThe cluster-based routing architecture for WSN-based Agri-IoT has not received\
    \ holistic\nand practical research considerations as far as FM, power optimization,\
    \ and network\nadaptability are concerned. Therefore, there is a demand for multi-parametric\
    \ optimiza-\ntion frameworks and guidelines for designing and implementing the\
    \ WSN sublayer.\n2.\nConcerning FM, most proposed schemes in the canon state of\
    \ the art are stand-\nalone, have high control message and computational complexities\
    \ (energy-inefﬁcient),\nand are mostly incompatible with the clustering architecture\
    \ [25,52]. The desired\nFM schemes for CA-IoT applications should be equipped\
    \ with fault-avoidance mech-\nIoT 2023, 4\n312\nanisms and the capacity to detect\
    \ and self-heal root faults (SN-out-of-service and\nsensory data outliers [25]),\
    \ not their effects.\n3.\nMultihop routing, which is a requirement to attain the\
    \ desired energy savings and\nnetwork adaptability in large-scale CA-IoT networks,\
    \ is asserted to be more energy-\nefﬁcient only in simulation experiments [33,120,121,123–125,128–130]\
    \ but not in real-\nworld implementation [22–24]. This imbalance is due to a lack\
    \ of a comprehensive\nand reliable theoretical multihop routing framework that\
    \ is based on the total commu-\nnication costs of multihop routing.\n4.\nThere\
    \ is a demand for a more realistic and holistic MOO framework that can op-\ntimize\
    \ the operational efﬁciency metrics such as cluster size, cluster counts, den-\n\
    sity/uniformity of nodes, communication distance, and activity schedule/duration,\n\
    right from the network design phase to the operational phase of Agri-IoT networks.\n\
    5.\nAlthough the current literature supports adaptive clustering with CH role\
    \ rotation\nideology, there exists the need for an optimal initial CH-count estimator\
    \ in order to\nimprove the stability of CH elections and the architecture. Thus,\
    \ the cluster quality\nindices (e.g., optimal cluster count and size) must be\
    \ predetermined before deﬁning\nthem in the associated CH election method, since\
    \ CH stability is compromised in most\nclustering methods [9,21,119–121,123,124].\n\
    6.\nMost protocols in the state of the art rely on perfect homogeneous networks,\
    \ which is\nunrealistic due to variations in modular specifications and resource\
    \ utilization and the\nfact that different SNs may have different communication\
    \ and data computational roles.\nTherefore, a more realistic, contextualized,\
    \ and adaptive clustering approach that leverages\nthe gap between the philosophy\
    \ and practice of Agri-IoT applications is needed.\n7.\nIn addition to the parent\
    \ LEACH protocol [21,61] which is a complete suite application\ncomprising routing,\
    \ MAC, and physical characteristics for wireless communication in\nWSNs, most\
    \ benchmarking MAC protocols purposed for traditional IoT applications\nare shelved,\
    \ since they are developed in solitude without application speciﬁcity and\nnetwork\
    \ architectural considerations. A custom-built and holistic protocol suite for\n\
    Agri-IoT remains a research opportunity.\n11. Conclusion and Future Works\nThis\
    \ tutorial presented: (1) a systematic overview of the fundamental concepts, tech-\n\
    nologies, and architectural standards of WSN-based Agri-IoT; (2) an evaluation\
    \ of the tech-\nnical design requirements of a robust, ubiquitous, self-healing,\
    \ energy-efﬁcient, adaptive,\nand affordable Agri-IoT; (3) a comprehensive survey\
    \ of the benchmarking FM techniques,\ncommunication standards, routing protocols,\
    \ MMAC protocols, and WSN-based testbed\nsolutions; and (4) an in-depth case study\
    \ on how to design a self-healing, energy-efﬁcient,\naffordable, adaptive, stable,\
    \ and cluster-based WSN-speciﬁc Agri-IoT from a proposed\ntaxonomy of MOO metrics\
    \ that can guarantee optimized network performance. Further-\nmore, this tutorial\
    \ established new taxonomies of faults, architectural layers, and MOO\nmetrics\
    \ for CA-IoT networks. Using the open technical issues, it recommended application-\n\
    speciﬁc requirements of Agri-IoT, general design expectations, and remedial measures,\n\
    and it evaluated them in CA-IoT for precision irrigation in order to optimally\
    \ exploit the\nproposed MOO metrics in a typical CA-IoT design in both simulation\
    \ and real-world\ndeployment scenarios. Overall, this tutorial can serve as a\
    \ new reference document for the\nIoT community and Agri-IoT designers, since\
    \ it adequately examined all critical aspects of\nWSN-based Agri-IoT networks\
    \ from theoretical modeling to real-world implementation.\nAuthor Contributions:\

  title: 'A Tutorial on Agricultural IoT: Fundamental Concepts, Architectures, Routing,
    and Optimization'
  verbatim_quote1: To effectively achieve the expectations in Figure 2, it is imperative
    to propose suitable architectural layers and evaluate how the various components
    interact in these layers. With the emerging advances in low-power, freely available,
    and boundless communication standards (e.g., BLE) and unfulﬁlled potentials of
    CA-IoT network [12, 16], a new framework of cluster-based architectural layers
    for the WSN-based Agri-IoT ecosystem is proposed in the left side of Figure 5.
    The center portion of Figure 5 presents the key components/technologies required
    in each layer, while the Things taxonomies of hardware components from the related
    literature [4, 8, 29] are depicted on the right portion of Figure 5.
  verbatim_quote2: "The deployment in testbeds/real-world scenarios of typical WSN-based\
    \ Agri-IoT has often led to abrupt failures during outdoor deployments due to:\n\
    1.\tThe agricultural setting is a unique area where conventional IoT technologies\
    \ do not apply. Existing Agri-IoT solutions are location-restricted because they\
    \ are mostly based on Wi-Fi or cellular communication technologies and electricity\
    \ grids with constrained coverages in Africa.\nA typical African agricultural\
    \ setting lacks access to reliable electricity and the Internet for cellular/Wi-Fi-based\
    \ technologies, and the intended users (farmers) of Agri-IoT technology are low-income\
    \ earners with limited technological expertise.\n2.\tHigh susceptibility to faults\
    \ and failures: Agri-IoT networks are vulnerable to faults and failures since\
    \ the resource-constrained SNs are densely deployed in hostile environments to\
    \ autonomously operate via a network supervisory protocol with limited post-deployment\
    \ maintenance services."

  analysis: 'The data are collected using various sensors and other devices that are
    part of the precision agriculture system. These data can include information on
    soil moisture, temperature, and pH, as well as data on plant health, crop yield,
    and weather conditions.


    The data are then transmitted to an edge computing device, which is a small, low-power
    computer that is typically located in the field. The edge computing device processes
    the data and makes decisions about how to control the irrigation system. The decisions
    are then sent to the irrigation system, which adjusts the flow of water to the
    crops.


    The use of edge computing in precision agriculture has several advantages. First,
    it allows data to be processed quickly and efficiently, which is essential for
    making real-time decisions about irrigation. Second, it reduces the amount of
    data that needs to be transmitted to the cloud, which can save on bandwidth and
    costs. Third, it makes the precision agriculture system more reliable and resilient,
    as it does not rely on a constant internet connection.'

    \ (A.R.O.)\nAbstract: With the implementation of the Internet of Things, the agricultural\
    \ domain has become\ndata-driven, allowing for well-timed and cost-effective farm\
    \ management while remaining envi-\nronmentally sustainable. Thus, the incorporation\
    \ of Internet of Things in the agricultural domain\nis the need of the hour for\
    \ developing countries whose gross domestic product primarily depends\non the\
    \ farming sector. It is worth highlighting that developing nations lack the infrastructure\
    \ for\nprecision agriculture; therefore, it has become necessary to come up with\
    \ a methodological paradigm\nwhich can accommodate a complete model to connect\
    \ ground sensors to the compute nodes in a\ncost-effective way by keeping the\
    \ data processing limitations and constraints in consideration. In\nthis regard,\
    \ this review puts forward an overview of the state-of-the-art technologies deployed\
    \ in\nprecision agriculture for soil assessment and pollutant monitoring with\
    \ respect to heavy metal in\nagricultural soil using various sensors. Secondly,\
    \ this manuscript illustrates the processing of data\ngenerated from the sensors.\
    \ In this regard, an optimized method of data processing derived from\ncloud computing\
    \ has been shown, which is called edge computing. In addition to this, a new model\n\
    of high-performance-based edge computing is also shown for efﬁcient ofﬂoading\
    \ of data with smooth\nworkﬂow optimization. In a nutshell, this manuscript aims\
    \ to open a new corridor for the farming\nsector in developing nations by tackling\
    \ challenges and providing substantial consideration.\nKeywords: food security;\
    \ precision agriculture; Internet of Things; soil moisture; heavy metal;\nwireless\
    \ sensors; edge computing\n1. Introduction\nThe agricultural sector in developing\
    \ countries has multiple challenges, i.e., if we\nlook at the production side,\
    \ the ﬁrst challenge which the farmer faces is the productivity\nchallenge, as\
    \ it becomes evident that developing countries are very low in productivity,\n\
    i.e., for any crop, the particular developing country could be the highest producer\
    \ but\nat the same time its productivity could be very low. Therefore, crop productivity\
    \ is a\nsigniﬁcant factor which has to be looked at. The second challenge which\
    \ the farmer faces is\nwith respect to climate change, industrial pollution, and\
    \ pest attacks, as they can damage\ncrops substantially. It is deemed necessary\
    \ for the farmer to mitigate those challenges by\nadapting to the latest technologies\
    \ and insurance schemes. The third challenge is related to\nmarket connectivity,\
    \ whereby the farmer produces crops and thus needs to be connected\nto distant\
    \ markets as per the crop production analysis and its subsequent data insights.\n\
    It is essential for the farmers to have all the information on a digital platform\
    \ and there\nshould be seamless trade between different markets and different\
    \ places. However, this\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture11060475\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agriculture\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n2 of 37\n\
    connection between farmers and the distant market is nowhere to be seen in developing\n\
    countries. On the other hand, the industry is looking up for exports, which in\
    \ turn need to\nbe streamlined substantially. From the economic perspective of\
    \ the developing country, it is\na boon if more facility in nature and regulatory\
    \ support has to be given for people who are\nlooking to export outside their\
    \ country or who are looking to have a value-added product\nacross the globe.\
    \ Now, this mismanagement in the agricultural sector can potentially lead\nto\
    \ food security risk.\nPrecision Agriculture (PA) is intended to help and maximize\
    \ the development of the\nfarming sector and will also help to ensure food security\
    \ [1]. It is to be highlighted that\nPA is a high-tech farming technology that\
    \ observes, measures, and analyzes farming ﬁelds\nand crops. With the advent of\
    \ PA, on-ﬁeld sensors can provide detailed levels of data\nfor problems of soil\
    \ and weather conditions pertaining to heavy metal toxics and climate\nchange.\
    \ Big data obtained from sensor networks and farm inputs tracking have a signiﬁcant\n\
    role to play to increase farm productivity, reduce environmental impacts, and\
    \ improve\nhuman welfare [2]. By combining artiﬁcial intelligence-based big data\
    \ analytics with sensor\nand image data, an integrated system could be developed\
    \ for the agricultural domain.\nImplementing intensive, high-value, personalized\
    \ management of crops would increase\nboth production and economic performance.\
    \ The aim of this paper is to highlight the\nimportance of smart sensors and high-performance\
    \ computing in protecting stakeholders\nin the agrifood value chain and providing\
    \ them with unlimited access to a large dataset of\nvarious categories in order\
    \ to track their farms. The challenges and consideration for the\nfarming sector\
    \ in developing countries are also highlighted. Figure 1 shows the number of\n\
    articles reviewed in various domains in the proposed manuscript.\nFigure 1. Distribution\
    \ of reviewed articles.\nThe structure of the paper is arranged as follows: The\
    \ ﬁrst section of the paper explains\nthe paper’s scope and the reasoning for\
    \ the proposed study. Section 2 gives an overview of\nfood security by taking\
    \ into consideration the pollution caused by persistent toxics and\nheavy metal.\
    \ In addition to this, Section 2 also highlights the importance of smart farming\n\
    based on IoT. Section 3 gives a detailed overview of the wireless communication\
    \ protocols\nand sensors used in the agricultural domain. Furthermore, Section\
    \ 3 also emphasizes\nthe importance of edge computing and also highlights the\
    \ model of High Performance\nComputing (HPC) on Edge. In addition, Section 3 also\
    \ details the various edge computing\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n3 of 37\nmethodologies\
    \ used by previous researchers in precision agriculture. Section 4 highlights\n\
    the current challenges and considerations for the agricultural sector in developing\
    \ countries.\nFinally, Section 5 presents the conclusion of the proposed review.\n\
    2. Food Security: A Global Challenge in View of Soil Pollutants and Heavy\nMetal\
    \ Toxicants\nOver the next 35 years, the world’s growing population will demand\
    \ more food\nthan mankind has ever produced. However, food security faces a variety\
    \ of issues on\nboth the development and consumption sides, which would necessitate\
    \ further study\nin order to formulate a solution. The food system, on its current\
    \ course, would likely\nabsorb much of the remaining carbon budget if the temperature\
    \ rises by 2 ◦C by the year\n2050 [3]. As a result, it would leave no room for\
    \ other industries, making reaching the\nParis Agreement virtually impossible.\
    \ Due to severe weather conditions, climate change of\nthis magnitude would alter\
    \ what can be grown and worn, as well as the dynamics of pest\nand disease spread.\
    \ Food production shocks will occur, eventually leading to higher food\nprices\
    \ and civil unrest. Agriculture is important, but it consumes 70% of all freshwater,\n\
    resulting in one-third of all greenhouse gas emissions and the loss of biodiversity\
    \ and soil\ndepletion [4,5]. Finding new ways to sustainably produce more food\
    \ on available land will\nbe crucial as agricultural land becomes scarce. This\
    \ necessitates substantial assessment of\nagricultural soil monitoring and mitigating\
    \ the heavy metal pollutants and other toxics\nfrom the soil.\nHeavy metal contamination\
    \ is widely spread across the world, disrupting the at-\nmosphere and thereby\
    \ showing signiﬁcant threats to human health. The reason behind\nheavy metal contamination,\
    \ in general, is the rapid speed of urbanization along with\nindustrialization\
    \ and noticeable land use change in fast-moving developing nations such\nas China\
    \ and India. Post-Industrial Revolution and economic globalization, there has\n\
    been an unprecedented rise in the variety of environmental pollutants, with innumerable\n\
    anthropogenic sources. Therefore, this continuously evolving issue pertaining\
    \ to food\nsecurity has become a serious concern for the world, speciﬁcally its\
    \ inextricable relation to\nthe health of human beings [6,7].\nSeveral dangerous\
    \ heavy metals and metalloids comprising arsenic, cadmium, lead,\nand mercury\
    \ are categorized as non-essential for metabolism. These metals are considered\n\
    to be deleterious in different ways [8,9] and have thus been listed in the top\
    \ 20 list of\nhazardous substances by the United States Environmental Protection\
    \ Agency and the\nRadioactive Substances and Disease Registry Agency (ATSDR) [9,10].\
    \ With respect to\nmetabolic process, heavy metals, like Fe, Zn, Cr (III), and\
    \ Cu are considered to be essential\ncomponents along with enzymes and cytochromes,\
    \ which are inextricably connected to\nthe biota metabolic functioning [9,11].\
    \ With regard to urease, nickel is considered to be an\nimportant component; however,\
    \ it may pose an unnecessary risk to human health [12,13].\nTherefore, with respect\
    \ to the above context, soil–food crops and vegetation ecosystem is a\nwell-laid-out\
    \ example of abiotic–biotic interactions.\nHeavy metal pollution generated from\
    \ energy intensive industries poses a serious\nthreat to the sustenance of soil.\
    \ Apart from the ill effects on human health, heavy metal\nalso puts an adverse\
    \ impact on soil biota through soil microbe interaction and microbial\nprocesses\
    \ [9,14,15]. It also hampers the ecosystem when it comes to beneﬁcial soil in-\n\
    sects [16–18]. It is worth noting that medicinal plants can be used for bioaccumulation\
    \ of\nheavy metals. A prominent example of such a case is the “Paeonia Ostii”\
    \ Chinese medicinal\nplant [19]. Numerous medicinal plants are demonstrated to\
    \ bioaccumulate various heavy\nmetals, i.e., As, Cd, Fe, Pb, Cr, and Cu when grown\
    \ near industrial zones [9,20–23]. It is also\nessential to note that, even in\
    \ the greenhouse ecosystem, vegetation is susceptible to heavy\nmetal such as\
    \ Zn, Pb, Mn, Cu, and Cd due to decreased exposure to illumination [24].\nFor\
    \ a successful technological remedy, it is essential to understand the soil–food\
    \ crop\ntransfer mechanisms. In order to achieve this purpose, this analysis ﬁrst\
    \ discusses the\ndifferent causes of heavy metal contamination in the soil ecosystem\
    \ and its relevance to the\nhealth of human beings. In general, this type of analysis\
    \ gives an overall layout pertaining\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n4 of 37\nto heavy\
    \ metal sources within the agricultural domain which in turn is correlated to\n\
    anthropogenic inﬂuences. It also helps us to provide state-of-the-art information\
    \ regarding\nthe global scenario of heavy metal pollution spanning across different\
    \ continents in the\nagricultural domain. In this regard, the next subsection\
    \ elaborates on the heavy metal\nsources in the soil–crop ecosystem.\n2.1. Heavy\
    \ Metal Sources in Soil–Crop Ecosystems\nIt is evident from numerous studies that\
    \ the source of heavy metals in the agricultural\necosystem is due to industrial\
    \ pollution, sewage sludge, phosphate-based fertilizers, metal\npesticides, and\
    \ contaminated water [9,25–29]. In addition to the mentioned sources of heavy\n\
    metal pollution, it is also essential to understand the impact of anthropogenic\
    \ pollutants, as\nthey pose a risk to the health of human beings through dietary\
    \ intake of contaminated food\ncrops which become polluted either through soil\
    \ or direct atmospheric deposition over the\nsurface of plant leaves [17,30].\
    \ Waste efﬂuents discharged from industries and automobiles\naccumulate in soil,\
    \ thereby causing contamination in the food chains [9,31,32]. It is also\nworth\
    \ noting that coal-based power plants pose a signiﬁcant threat with respect to\
    \ Hg soil\npollution. In this regard, Li et al. [24,33] stated the adverse effect\
    \ on human health caused\nby consuming lettuce and water spinach grown in Hg-contaminated\
    \ soil area. Likewise,\nmany strong sources present a grim outlook for global\
    \ food safety. Figure 2 shows the\necosystem of heavy metal contamination. Heavy\
    \ metals emitted from automobile and\nindustrial smelters are transported to distant\
    \ locations, i.e., up to several kilometers away\nfrom their sources by wet or\
    \ dry deposition [34]. These metals accumulate in plant leaves\nthrough foliar\
    \ transmission after the deposition of atmospheric particles above the surface\n\
    of the leaf [34]. Fernandez and Eichert [35] proposed that particles can penetrate\
    \ the\nleaf tissue through the pores present on the leaf cuticle and inside stomata.\
    \ Similar to\nroot uptake, foliar uptake of heavy metals may also arise in a dose-dependent\
    \ manner.\nNonetheless, one of the leading contributors of heavy metal penetration\
    \ in agricultural soil\nalso comes from sewage and sludge pollution.\nFigure 2.\
    \ Ecosystem of heavy metal contamination.\nTo address the concern of rising wastewater\
    \ produced from domestic and industrial\nprocesses as a result of the growing\
    \ human population, a reliable strategy and stable\ntreatment systems are urgently\
    \ needed. With the rapid growth of agriculture in the past\ndecade, overuse of\
    \ water resources, especially for agriculture, has become a problematic\nissue\
    \ which threatens to intensify the effects of climate change. Agriculture constitutes\
    \ by\nfar the largest use of water in all countries [36]. In order to solve this\
    \ problem, it has been\nfound that wastewater reuse is a feasible option to minimize\
    \ anthropogenic impact [37].\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n5 of 37\nFurthermore,\
    \ raw wastewater reuse in agriculture is a valuable tool for developing coun-\n\
    tries to minimize usage of freshwater while also addressing the challenge of rising\
    \ food\nproduction in water-scarce areas. The beneﬁts of reusing water in agriculture\
    \ are numerous\nand unquestionable, i.e., it saves signiﬁcant quantities of freshwater\
    \ which may be assigned\nfor other essential purposes; it provides nutrients that\
    \ may replace chemical fertilizers,\nthus helping to increase soil fertility and\
    \ crop yield and reduce production costs; it allows\nfor the expansion of agricultural\
    \ land in dry areas; it is a relatively cheap disposal method\nfor raw wastewater;\
    \ and it can help to prevent contamination of surface water. In addition,\nit\
    \ has been demonstrated that the health risks associated with raw wastewater usage\
    \ in\nagriculture are satisfactory if its biological content meets speciﬁed standards\
    \ [38,39].\nHaving elaborated on the positive side of raw wastewater, there are\
    \ also possible nega-\ntive effects, such as soil salinization and groundwater\
    \ contamination of metals and organic\ncompounds. It should be noted that these\
    \ are only theoretical at this point. Furthermore,\nthe use of untreated water\
    \ for agricultural production is potentially dangerous due to its\nmicrobial substance,\
    \ especially bacteria, viruses, and parasites, which can cause a number\nof diseases\
    \ because many of them can be sustained for longer periods in the environment.\n\
    This in turn tends to affect the quality of the soil.\nIt is crucial that farmers\
    \ aim to keep the quality of their soil high in order to pre-\nserve the health\
    \ of their soil species. Soil microbes are an important component of the\necosystem\
    \ [40]. Soil fertility depends in part on the breakdown of organic matter and\n\
    the ﬂow of nutrients through the ecosystem. When they are subjected to stresses\
    \ like\nextreme temperature, pH, salinity, and chemical pollution, they are able\
    \ to negatively affect\nproductivity [41–43]. Owing to the variety of anthropogenic\
    \ activities, soil may become\npolluted with a variety of heavy metals from manufacturing\
    \ and mining. Many forms of\ncontaminants, i.e., from mine waste, sewage sludge,\
    \ chemical fertilizer, and pesticides can\nend up in the soil system and adversely\
    \ affect soil microbes [43]. As another alternative,\nvegetables produced in greenhouses\
    \ also become polluted by heavy metals, often from\nanthropogenic sources. Within\
    \ the source, detection of heavy metals can be performed\nusing sophisticated\
    \ statistical and geospatial methods [9,44–47]. Greenhouse vegetables\nin China\
    \ were more susceptible to Cd pollution than crops in open farmland [48,49]. The\n\
    results of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) demonstrated that As, Ni, and\
    \ Cr are\nprimarily discharged from weathered rocks, while metallic pollutants\
    \ such as Hg and Pb\nare generated by industry, vehicle fumes, and reuse of wastewater\
    \ for irrigation [48,49].\nNonetheless, it is worth noting that PCA has been used\
    \ by several researchers in various\nagricultural domains for the assessment of\
    \ soil heavy metal pollutants [50–53].\nIdentifying soil pollutants and their\
    \ origins is important to research due to their close\nties to human health [54–56].\
    \ In this regard, it has become deemed necessary to come up\nwith tools and techniques\
    \ which can monitor heavy metal composition in the soil which can\nbe incorporated\
    \ into the smart farming ecosystem. Smart farming is considered to be the\nnext\
    \ key segment in the agriculture sector as it has changed the methodological paradigm\n\
    of how farmers operate on ﬁelds. The following subsection highlights the overview\
    \ of\nsmart farming and its beneﬁts.\n2.2. Smart Farming Initiatives Is the Need\
    \ of the Hour\nWith the advent of Internet of Things (IoT), smart devices have\
    \ reached into all facets\nof our day-to-day life, i.e., healthcare and wellness,\
    \ smart homes, automobile and logistics,\nintelligent cities and industries. In\
    \ recent decades, agriculture has seen a series of techno-\nlogical changes, increasingly\
    \ industrialized and technologically driven. Through different\nagriculture-based\
    \ smart devices, farmers today now have greater control over animal\nhusbandry\
    \ and cultivation processes, making them more predictable and productive. This,\n\
    along with the rising market demand for agricultural products, has helped to increase\
    \ the\nworldwide proliferation of intelligent agriculture technologies. It is\
    \ worth noting that for\nthe year 2020, IoT’s agricultural market share reached\
    \ $5.6 billion [57].\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n6 of 37\nModern agriculture can\
    \ be addressed in several respects. For instance, AgriTech\nrefers to the use\
    \ of technology in the domain of agriculture [58]. In addition, intelligent\n\
    agriculture is primarily used to describe the use of IoT-based agricultural solutions.\
    \ With\nIoT sensors, farmers can make informed decisions and develop various parameters\
    \ of their\nwork, i.e., cattle to crop production, in order to collect environmental\
    \ and machine metrics.\nFor example, farmers can decide exactly how much pesticide\
    \ and fertilizer is to be utilized\nto optimize productivity by using smart agriculture\
    \ sensors for monitoring crop status. The\nsame applies to the concept of intelligent\
    \ farming. Figure 3 shows a broader perspective\non a modern-day agricultural\
    \ model, which incorporates various wireless sensor nodes to\nenable IoT-based\
    \ farming with satellite communication, where different ground sensors\nare deployed\
    \ which communicate with the cloud computing node for data processing and\nanalysis,\
    \ so that farmers can make correct decisions.\nFigure 3. Modern day agriculture.\n\
    Although smart IoT and industrial IoT are not as common as consumer-connected\n\
    devices, the market continues to be very competitive. IoT technologies are increasingly\n\
    being implemented for agriculture. COVID-19 has had a positive impact on IoT market\n\
    share in agriculture. Indeed, the smart framing market share is expected to hit\
    \ $6.2 billion\nby the end of 2021, as reported recently [57].\nIt is evident\
    \ that COVID-19 has made a signiﬁcant impact on the farming sector\nacross the\
    \ world. However, the agricultural sector is showing potential to make a strong\n\
    comeback by leveraging positive government policies which indicate adoption of\
    \ advanced\ntechnologies by making substantial investment in the agricultural\
    \ sector. This initiative\nwill make room for IoT-based agricultural solutions\
    \ as a prominent business strategy, thus\ncausing a reasonable increment in crop\
    \ production. However, in the current situation, the\nmarket is expected to show\
    \ a decline up to 0.8% for the ﬁrst two quarters of year 2021\ncompared to 2020\
    \ and this trend will show a positive growth from 2022 onwards [59].\nIn addition\
    \ to this, the smart world agriculture market is projected to triple to 15.3 bil-\n\
    lion dollars by 2025, compared to just over 5 billion dollars back in 2016 [60].\
    \ If the sector\ncontinues to expand, there will still be plenty of opportunities\
    \ for companies. In the coming\nyears, creating IoT products for agriculture will\
    \ distinguish companies as early adopters,\nthus helping to pave the way for success.\n\
    Today, the innovations on our immediate horizon include autonomous machines\n\
    which have the capacity to pluck and pick fruits and vegetables from the respective\
    \ plan-\ntation. A highly sophisticated sensing system includes microscopic sensors\
    \ and cameras\nthat help farmers track the growth of crops and warn them when\
    \ something is wrong\nor inform them of the optimum time to harvest. The Bonirob\
    \ developed by Deepﬁeld\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n7 of 37\nLabs [61] can take\
    \ a soil sample, liquidize it, and then analyze its pH and phosphorus\nlevels\
    \ in real time. Researchers expect to grow and harvest an entire hectare of land\
    \ barley\nwithout humans ever entering the ﬁeld as a proof of concept for autonomous\
    \ farming\ntechnology. Companies like Aerobotics [62] already have commercialized\
    \ software that an-\nalyzes infrared photos taken by drones to detect unhealthy\
    \ vegetation, similar to a real-life\ngame of SIM farming in which the farmer\
    \ receives a warning on their computer when a\ndisturbed area is detected. Machine\
    \ learning is constantly improving the system’s ability to\ndistinguish between\
    \ crop varieties and weeds that pose a threat to the farmer. Furthermore,\nvarious\
    \ pilots are hired by Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV)-based companies to ﬂy light aircraft\n\
    equipped with multispectral cameras on data-gathering missions over vast farms\
    \ around\nthe country [63]. Planet Labs has a ﬂeet of CubSat satellites that take\
    \ weekly photographs\nof entire farms from space to aid in crop monitoring [64].\
    \ To cope with this new wave of\ndata, other companies are developing analytics\
    \ tools to act as farm management systems,\nenabling farmers to work on a variety\
    \ of land sizes. Farmers’ business networks can now\nintegrate data from several\
    \ farms into one large pool, giving their members access to\nmacro-level insights\
    \ that were previously only accessible to corporate mega farms.\n2.3. Beneﬁts\
    \ of Smart Farming\nIn certain ways, technology and IoT have the ability to change\
    \ agriculture. There are\nﬁve ways in which IoT can boost agriculture:\n•\nData:\n\
    •\nLoads of data gathered by sensors from the ﬁelds, i.e., temperature, soil quality,\
    \ crop\ngrowth progress, and animal health can be used to monitor the condition\
    \ of the farm\nalong with the performance of ﬁeld workers and efﬁciency of equipment.\n\
    •\nImproved internal process management and therefore lower output risks:\n•\n\
    The ability to forecast the production performance enables farmers to become prepared\n\
    for a better delivery of goods. Wise decisions can be made if the estimated production\n\
    of the crop is known.\n•\nCost savings and waste reduction by improved quality\
    \ control:\n•\nIf any irregularities in crop growth and animal health are seen,\
    \ then the risk of losing\nthe yield can be minimized.\n•\nImproved business productivity\
    \ through process automation:\n•\nSmart farming can automate several processes\
    \ during the development cycle, i.e.,\nirrigation, fertilization, or pest control\
    \ with intelligent devices.\n•\nImproved consistency and volume of the commodity:\n\
    •\nGreater control over production processes and retaining higher crop quality\
    \ levels\nand growth potential by automation can be achieved.\n•\nHelps to mitigate\
    \ soil toxicity and monitor signiﬁcant parameters, thereby providing\nsustainable\
    \ agriculture:\nWith the advent of low-cost sensors for monitoring agriculture,\
    \ signiﬁcant parameters\nin the agricultural ecosystem can be analyzed to increase\
    \ the factor of sustainability, i.e.,\nassessing soil quality and monitoring soil\
    \ toxicity, water quality and its controlled usage,\nweather conditions, and optimized\
    \ usage of fertilizers.\nAll the aforementioned variables will contribute to higher\
    \ revenues. However, the\nbeneﬁts of smart farming can only be exploited if the\
    \ quality of internet is able to accommo-\ndate the IoT infrastructure. In this\
    \ regard, the following section discusses internet access\nquality in developing\
    \ countries.\n2.4. Quality of Internet Access in Developing Countries\nIoT provides\
    \ an environment in which objects, animals, or humans have uniquely\nidentiﬁed\
    \ data that can be communicated over the internet without the need for computer\n\
    interactions between humans and computer [65]. In 2015, over 13.4 billion devices\
    \ were\nlinked to the internet (as part of IoT) and it is forecasted that by the\
    \ year 2020 there will\nbe a rise in 18.5% to 38.5 billion devices, according\
    \ to Juniper research (Juniper research\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n8 of 37\n\
    2015) [66]. Today, nearly every ﬁeld of modern society is being overtaken by IoT\
    \ [67]. The\nmain areas include smart health, smart cities, intelligent industries,\
    \ driverless cars, smart\nagriculture, precision farming, smart homes, etc. [68].\
    \ In this regard, it has been deemed\nnecessary for every household and business\
    \ sector to become connected with the internet,\nif we want to realize the maximum\
    \ utilization of IoT. Figure 4a shows the graph of internet\nusers worldwide on\
    \ the basis of geographic division and Figure 4b shows the subsequent\npenetration\
    \ rate till October 2020 [69]. It is worth noting that, although the number of\
    \ users\nin Asia and Africa is high as observed in Figure 4a, if Figure 4b is\
    \ analyzed, then it becomes\nevident that there is a clear-cut digital division,\
    \ as the penetration rate in Asia and Africa is\na mere 59.5% and 47.1%. In most\
    \ of the developing and underdeveloped countries in Asia\nand Africa, the agricultural\
    \ sector plays a prominent role in the contribution of overall Gross\nDomestic\
    \ Product (GDP). Therefore, reforms in communication technology are deemed\nnecessary\
    \ in such regions to incorporate the IoT paradigm into the agricultural domain.\n\
    Figure 4. (a) Internet users worldwide. (b) Internet world penetration rate [69].\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n9 of 37\nIoT has great potential and is one of the\
    \ main areas for future internet services growth.\nIoT problems are exploratory\
    \ in major IT companies and most countries. New uses of\nIoT are being searched\
    \ for and developed, but most work has been done in the ﬁeld of\nstandardization\
    \ of solutions [70]. IoT issues are included in the European Digital Agenda\n\
    (2016) [66]. As part of the European framework for research and innovation HORIZON\n\
    2020, more than EUR 140 billion is estimated to have been invested in IoT technology\n\
    between 2016 and 2017 alone (European Commission, 2015). In March 2015, the EU\n\
    Commission launched the Innovation Internet Alliance. The objective of the alliance\
    \ was to\ndevelop close cooperation on innovation and standardization of IoT (European\
    \ Commission\n2016) between the EU Commission, stakeholders, and parties involved\
    \ in IoT [66].\nThe fragmented existence of platforms and communications protocols\
    \ is one of the\nmajor problems of the present day, and contributes to incompatibility\
    \ problems between\ndifferent IoT devices and features [71,72]. IoT is well known\
    \ in precision agriculture,\nbut only proprietary solutions that lead to compatibility\
    \ and connectivity issues between\nvarious equipment are being used [73]. New\
    \ technologies need to be sought, based on\nopen standards and frameworks that\
    \ are compatible with smartphones. Many products\nthat are based on open hardware\
    \ at least partially are currently on the market and prices\nare considerably\
    \ lower than proprietary solutions. Therefore, by keeping the current\ninfrastructure\
    \ in consideration, the agriculture methodological paradigm can be taken to\n\
    the next level by connecting to the IoT.\n2.5. Embarking Agriculture on IoT\n\
    Farmers today have to face the biggest challenges in crop production as global\
    \ pop-\nulation grows. Therefore, it has been deemed necessary for the farming\
    \ sector to bring\nmajor shifts in adapting the latest technologies. IoT is driving\
    \ change in agriculture, which\nhas brought a shift in the farming paradigm. IoT\
    \ refers to devices or objects embedded\nin the sensor for the purpose of measurement\
    \ and transfer of datasets through network\ndevices, from pumps and tractors to\
    \ weather stations. In essence, IoT means that these\nphysical machines can transmit\
    \ and receive information from farms on devices using the\ninternet in order to\
    \ remotely measure all types of data and provide that information to\nthe farmer.\
    \ Soil moisture, chemical properties, dam levels, livestock health, and weather\n\
    details can be collected in real time by IoT devices. IoT devices information\
    \ helps farmers\nto track farms and accordingly helps to advise farmers to increase\
    \ productivity and yields.\nFarmers can also respond faster to farm conditions\
    \ and save time and money. Nonetheless,\nwith the advent of IoT, there lies a\
    \ major challenge in the processing of high volumes of\ndata generated from the\
    \ on-ﬁeld sensors. Therefore, researchers need to tackle this issue by\ncoming\
    \ up with cloud computing models synchronized with on-ﬁeld agricultural sensors.\n\
    2.6. Data Processing Challenge in IoT\nOne of the biggest hurdles of IoT is to\
    \ process large datasets in tandem. However,\nknowing what the data are, what\
    \ the nature of the data is, and how they go through\nare some of the key components\
    \ that need to be looked upon in this process. Gathering\nthe data forms the initial\
    \ stage, and the other factor comprises ingestion of data to the\nsystem from\
    \ the sensor. It is deemed necessary to understand that the data go through\n\
    all the gateways before entering into the system where the data are actually cleansed\
    \ and\ntransformed, which eventually leads to substantial insights. The big question\
    \ lies with how\nmany speciﬁc points of computation should exist. Let us consider\
    \ an instance, whereby\nthere is a drip irrigation system which ﬁnds that one\
    \ of the plants is not getting enough\nwater. Now, this delay could not be disturbing\
    \ for the system as the concerned person\nhandling the drip irrigation system\
    \ can come back the next morning and actually provide\nsome water or maybe some\
    \ other time it can be dealt with. However, in order to bring\nsustenance in the\
    \ agricultural industry, it is necessary for the farmers to understand the\nfactors\
    \ that govern crop growth by optimizing the usage of fertilizers and water. In\
    \ these\nkinds of situations, decisions are taken close to the actions or where\
    \ the data originate\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n10 of 37\nfrom. Therefore, in\
    \ this regard, one can realistically conduct some processing for something\nto\
    \ be analyzed and thus, one can recognize some patterns and do some planning for\
    \ the\nlong term, accordingly. This gives a vision at a spectrum on a scale of\
    \ time as to where\nthe processing needs to happen. So, by considering all these\
    \ scenarios, it becomes evident\nthat not all the data are important, and this\
    \ is the challenging aspect to comprehend. This\ngives an insight of what data\
    \ need to be stored, what need to be discarded, what need to\nbe retained for\
    \ short-term purposes, and what need to be retained for long-term purposes.\n\
    Thus, all these are challenging issues that need to be addressed and that is where\
    \ storage\ntechnologies are actually highlighted. There are a number of systems\
    \ that are actually\nbeing worked upon; however, due to the lack of quality internet\
    \ access infrastructure in\ndeveloping countries, the feasibility of their implementation\
    \ remains a challenge. One\nof the viable solutions to solve this problem could\
    \ be via edge computing whereby the\nessential data could be ofﬂoaded from the\
    \ cloud over the edge of the cloud, and this is\nwhere the paradigm of smart sensing\
    \ with edge computing comes in.\n2.7. IoT-Based Smart Sensing with Edge Computing\n\
    Numerous embedded programmable devices have been utilized in recent literature.\n\
    Some are personalized while others are industrial programmable boards or full\
    \ sens-\ning/monitoring systems in closed-source applications. Researchers select\
    \ their equipment\naccording to the goals of each study or the main objective.\
    \ Business pertaining to sensing\nservices includes a range of features outside\
    \ the box to allow scientists to concentrate on\nother aspects of IoT de-planting,\
    \ such as meta-processing, smart tracking and monitoring\nalgorithms, cloud interoperability,\
    \ and more [74–76]. On the other hand, the programmable\nopen approach gives designers\
    \ versatility in monitoring the actions of the nodes and\nnetwork and in programming\
    \ new peripheral devices, such as new sensors or drive mod-\nules [77,78]. The\
    \ next subsections discuss various communication paradigms and wireless\nsensors\
    \ and nodes which are suitable to be used in the agricultural domain.\n3. Communication\
    \ in IoT\nDespite signiﬁcant changes, IoT still evolves, as can be seen from many\
    \ reviews, to\nachieve its ﬁnal form [79]. The conﬁguration of IoT is based on\
    \ three layers: a network\nlayer (data transfer), a perception layer, and an application\
    \ layer for data storage and\nmanipulation [80]. The network layer is considered\
    \ to be the physical layer of the archi-\ntecture, where the on-ﬁeld sensors and\
    \ actuators directly interact with the environment\nand gather data as per the\
    \ requirement. Technology such as Wireless Sensor Network\n(WSN), Radio Frequency\
    \ Identiﬁcation (RFID), and recently, Near Field Communications\n(NFC) are used\
    \ on the perception layer [79]. Correlation exists between WSN and RFID\ntechnology\
    \ due to semi-passive and active RFID tags which can also be viewed as lower-\n\
    computing and storage wireless nodes [81]. A wireless sensing node normally consists\n\
    of more than one sensor module (either external or embedded along with digital\
    \ sensor\ndevices), a processing module, typically a low-power microcontroller\
    \ unit, and a Radio Fre-\nquency (RF) communication module compatible with low-power\
    \ wireless communication\ntechnology [82].\nAt the network layer of the IoT, WSN\
    \ communicates with physical objects and their\nsurroundings, neighboring nodes,\
    \ or gateways. The network layer is also responsible for\nbuilding a network paradigm,\
    \ by using which the data are typically forwarded to a remote\nstorage infrastructure\
    \ for further analysis and processing [83]. Wireless standards which\nare used\
    \ to develop communication protocols, i.e., 802.15.4, bridge the difference among\n\
    the internet-enabled gateways and the end-nodes. These types of protocols comprise\
    \ Sigfox,\nZigBee, 6LowPan, WirelessHART, and ISA100.11a. [74,84]. In addition\
    \ to this, Bluetooth\nLow Energy (BLE), Long-Range and Long-Range Wide Area Network\
    \ (LoRa/LoRaWAN),\nand low-power WiFi have also been used in the network layer.\n\
    The application layer is the IoT’s third layer. This layer is responsible for\
    \ getting\ndata downloaded and delivering application-speciﬁc service to the users’\
    \ device via an\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n11 of 37\napplication programming\
    \ interface. It is very important, and it promotes the realization\nof IoT in\
    \ several respects. The application layer faces a variety of unresolved suits,\
    \ such\nas system recognition as a unique device. Identifying and addressing billions\
    \ of devices\naround the world would provide them across the future internet with\
    \ direct internet-like\naccess and power. Identity uniqueness, durability, and\
    \ scalability are essential character-\nistics of the approach scheme [83]. IPv6\
    \ can mitigate some system recognition problems\nwith its aspects of internet\
    \ mobility and is expected to play a key role in this sector [85].\nThe heterogeneity\
    \ of the wireless nodes, diversity in data types, parallel operations, and\nintegration\
    \ of data from devices further exacerbate the problem [86].\nWhile numerous theoretical\
    \ parameters of the WSN have been studied extensively in\nliterature, practical\
    \ IoT/WSN implementations are very demanding for agriculture and\nremain a difﬁcult\
    \ task. Sensor modules must be sufﬁciently reliable, with the required mea-\n\
    suring range available which is protected from environmental factors that either\
    \ produce\nfalse readings or cause malfunctions in the system. As the IoT possesses\
    \ distributed nature,\ntherefore replacing the power source can be a very tough\
    \ challenge for battery-operated\nnodes in open ﬁelds or other agricultural facilities.\
    \ Consequently, very stringent power lim-\nitations inﬂuence the hardware selection\
    \ and the low-power characteristics of the chosen\nperipherals are often taken\
    \ into consideration when designing a new device. The software\ncomponents to\
    \ be implemented must be carefully inspected to incorporate the functionality\n\
    of a system. The ﬁnal function code includes a fully integrated understanding\
    \ of software\nengineering and adequate testing to prevent ﬁeld failures [87].\
    \ Other characteristics that\nallow an integrated, low-power system to be chosen\
    \ for use are its longer-term reliability,\nthe number of digital and analogue\
    \ inputs/outputs that reduce the number of peripheral\ndevices (sensors and actuators)\
    \ to be supported, the capacity of power harvesting modules,\nand the effort needed\
    \ to program the system.\nIoT is a dominant type of IT wireless technology in\
    \ the seven major groups, i.e.,\nthe Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM),\
    \ Wireless Personal Area Network\n(WPAN), the Cognitive Radio/Wireless Regional\
    \ Area Network (WRAN), Wireless Radio,\nmesh, Point-to-Point (P2P), and the Low-Power\
    \ Network (LPN), Low-Power Wide Area\nNetwork (LPWAN). Further GSM standard is\
    \ divided into GSM EDGE Radio Access Net-\nwork (GERAN) and Universal Mobile Telecommunication\
    \ System (UMTS) and Universal\nTerrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN) [88].\
    \ Many wireless devices are produced in\ncompliance with different wireless standards.\
    \ One prominent problem is the interference\nbetween devices that run on the same\
    \ band (for example Bluetooth, ZigBee, and WiFi) or\nadjacent bands [89].\nTable\
    \ 1 summarizes the IoT wireless networking which offers a wide range of band-\n\
    width, operating frequency, range, and power consumption. The various technologies\
    \ and\nspeciﬁcations as well as the discrepancies between IoT projects and their\
    \ unique criteria\nimpede network interoperability. Two very common phenomena\
    \ are high temperatures\nand high humidity when it comes to agricultural deployments.\
    \ Based on observations by\nBannister et al. [90], when the temperature increases\
    \ from 25 ◦C to 65 ◦C, it has a major\neffect on the signal intensity obtained.\
    \ Boano et al. [91] presented similar ﬁndings. In\naddition, humidity in agricultural\
    \ deployments can also be very high. For open ﬁelds,\nthe wireless nodes are exposed\
    \ directly to rain or irrigation systems. Relative humidity in\ngreenhouses can\
    \ also reach 80% for long periods. Dampness has been shown to greatly\nimpact\
    \ the distribution of radio waves [74,92]. It is necessary to take the specs of\
    \ the\nnumber of nodes into account, i.e., the distance between them, the antenna\
    \ height, and\nthe operating frequency based on the appropriate size of the messages\
    \ when selecting\na wireless transceiver for the agricultural purpose. The next\
    \ subsection discusses the\nsensors which are used or have the potential to be\
    \ deployed over agricultural ﬁelds for soil\nassessment and monitoring soil pollutants\
    \ such as heavy metal toxics. In addition, the next\nsubsection also highlights\
    \ the various wireless nodes and the associated microcontroller\nand transceiver.\n\

    \ Used Sensors for Smart Farming and Heavy Metal Identiﬁcation\nSensors for Soil\
    \ Moisture (SM) have been used in crop ﬁelds for decades to measure\nwater content.\
    \ The use of handheld/manual soil moisture technology is increasingly being\n\
    replaced by automated technologies, since there were difﬁculties in manual soil\
    \ moisture\nreadings in remote production areas. In the past decade, technology\
    \ has been developed for\nwireless data collection, providing managers and users\
    \ with real-time access to soil moisture\ndata, resulting in more successful water\
    \ management decisions. Some of the prominent\nsensing devices to measure soil\
    \ moisture comprise gravimetric sampling, resistive sensors,\ncapacitive sensors,\
    \ and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) [93]. Gravimetric sampling is a\ndirect and\
    \ normal SM measurement tool [94]. SM is determined by a proportion of dry\nsoil\
    \ mass to wet soil mass including pores. It needs the manual drying of soil samples\n\
    taken from the ﬁeld and oven sampling [94]. The electrical conductivity of water\
    \ and\nthe measuring of resistance changes based on soil water content are primarily\
    \ resistive\nsensors, such as granular matrix sensors. This method includes sensor\
    \ calibration for\nprecise SM reading.\nIntelligent irrigation-based measurement\
    \ to maintain soil moisture levels is signiﬁcant\nto improve plant productivity\
    \ and quality. On the other hand, soil moisture sensors these\ndays are expensive,\
    \ i.e., the ECHO-EC5 soil moisture sensor costs around USD 169 [95].\nIn order\
    \ to overcome the cost constraint factor, Wang et al. [95] proposed an RFID-based\n\
    GreenTag sensor to maintain and improvise plant productivity and quality.\nIn\
    \ addition, RFID sensors can be combined with biosensors comprising aptamer and\n\
    DNA-based properties which can be used to detect heavy metals at nanoscale and\
    \ large\nscale levels pertaining to food safety monitoring. A heavy metal detection-based\
    \ biosensor\nis composed of genetically modiﬁed bacterial cells and a green ﬂuorescent\
    \ signal ampliﬁer\nwhich detects the presence of arsenite in foods [96,97]. Its\
    \ arsenic detection lasts for an\nhour with a detection range of 5–140 µg/L. Other\
    \ methodologies pertaining to biosensors,\ni.e., aptamers and graphene electrodes,\
    \ have also been used to detect arsenic with the\npossibility of being developed\
    \ as simple and easy-to-use low-cost devices [97,98].\nThe EC-5 series sensors\
    \ were also used by Wu et al. [99] for ﬁeld-speciﬁc calibration\nand evaluation\
    \ in sandy soils. Nonetheless, EC-5 sensors have turned out to be helpful to\n\
    reveal soil water content dynamics in different soil depths post rainfall conditions.\
    \ The\nECHO series has other variants of sensors; i.e., ECHO-EA10 can be used\
    \ for medium\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n13 of 37\ntextured soil type with low\
    \ electrical conductance conditions. In addition to this, there is\nECHO-10HS\
    \ soil moisture sensor which is a new addition in the soil moisture sensor family\n\
    and possesses high-frequency oscillation, which enables the sensors to accurately\
    \ measure\nsoil moisture in any of the soil or soilless media with minimum salinity\
    \ and textural effects.\nIn order to measure soil water content and salinity,\
    \ Zemni et al. [100] used 5TE sensors\nat different soil depths to assess dielectric\
    \ permittivity (Ka) and electrical conductivity\n(ECa). It is to be noted that\
    \ 5TE sensors are based on frequency domain reﬂectometry\n(FDR); therefore, they\
    \ use a ﬁxed frequency wave of broadband signal which makes the\ndevice cheaper\
    \ and more compact. Nolz et al. [101] deployed hydro probe2 sensors to\nevaluate\
    \ near surface soil water and determine in situ water retention function. Hydro\n\
    probe sensors are advantageous due to their linear signal response. On the contrary,\
    \ hydro\nprobe sensors are not suitable for sandy soils [102]. Udukumburage et\
    \ al. [103] used an\nMP406 soil moisture sensor to verify the saturated condition\
    \ of the expansive soil layer.\nThey also used this sensor to measure volumetric\
    \ water content values in the soil column\nduring the wetting and drying process\
    \ [104]. In order to maintain the indoor ecosystem\nservices, air quality plays\
    \ an essential role. In this regard, MIKROE gas sensors are used to\nmonitor the\
    \ air quality [105,106]. To evaluate and assess the vegetation change and study\n\
    physiological and metabolic response of corn ﬁelds and paddy ﬁelds, the Pogo II\
    \ VWC has\nbeen widely used [107,108].\nHu et al. [109] used Portable X-ray Fluorescence\
    \ Spectroscopy (PXRF) to assess the\nheavy metal content in soil for which they\
    \ covered 301 farmland soils from Fuyang in\nZhejiang Province, in the southern\
    \ Yangtze River Delta, China. Conventional methods for\nheavy metal detection\
    \ such as Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS), Atomic Fluores-\ncence Spectrometry\
    \ (AFS), and Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy\n(ICP-OES),\
    \ are expensive and lengthy procedures which are executed in laboratories. There-\n\
    fore, these methods are not taken into consideration for rapid testing and high-density\n\
    evaluation of soil heavy metals contamination. As an alternative method for rapid\
    \ heavy\nmetal detection, Portable X-ray Fluorescence (PXRF) was used to assess\
    \ cumulative con-\ncentrations of soil heavy metals based on linear regression\
    \ models between ﬂuorescence\nintensity and speciﬁc heavy metal concentration.\
    \ Due to its ease of use and rapid testing\nability using non-destructive quantiﬁcation,\
    \ PXRF has been widely used by researchers\nin numerous domains [110–113]. For\
    \ the heavy metal assessment in agricultural soil con-\nducted by Hu et al. [109],\
    \ VNIR sensor was used to anticipate soil properties comprising\npH, soil nitrogen,\
    \ and carbon [114,115]. In addition to PXRF, NixPRO color sensor can also\nbe\
    \ used to identify hotspots and total spatial area in excess of environmental\
    \ thresholds in\nlandﬁll soils [116].\nLately Zhao and Liu [117] have developed\
    \ a Portable Electrochemical System (PES)\nfor on-site heavy metal detection on\
    \ farmland. Their system was composed of a three-\nelectrode conﬁguration which\
    \ comprised a signal acquisition system integrated with a\nmicrocontroller-based\
    \ potentiostat to perform square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry.\nTheir system\
    \ was assessed by testing the detection of pd(II) and cd(II) in acetic acid soil\n\
    extracts and acetate buffer solution [117]. However, their system did not include\
    \ any\nwireless sensor module to transmit heavy metal composition data.\nOther\
    \ than the aforementioned sensors, there are several other wireless sensors ded-\n\
    icated to: photosynthesis, i.e., Beta Therm temperature sensor; leaf wetness sensor,\
    \ i.e.,\nSLWA-M003; precision sensor for leaf temperature, i.e., ∆LA-C; light\
    \ intensity sensor,\ni.e., BH1750FUI sensor [118–122]. With the advent of these\
    \ sensors, CO2 sensors also\nplay an essential role, especially in greenhouse\
    \ systems [123]. CO2 sensors have also\nbeen widely used to measure the subsequent\
    \ level in peat soil, landﬁll, and forest control\nsite [124,125]. In the smart\
    \ farming ecosystem, the growth and quality of the fruit bunch\ncannot be neglected.\
    \ In this regard, there are dedicated fruit growth monitoring sensors\nwhich researchers\
    \ have used in their domain of plantation. Thalheimer [126] designed\nan optoelectronics\
    \ sensor for monitoring fruit and stem radial growth. Their developed\nsensor\
    \ was lightweight and easy to install with low maintenance. Nonetheless, the sensor\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n14 of 37\nwas well tested in open ﬁeld conditions.\
    \ In addition to this, the effect of gas concentration\nduring the fruit growth\
    \ was studied by Ma et al. [127], for which a smart ethylene elec-\ntrochemical\
    \ sensor was established to investigate ethylene emission from fruits. Lately,\n\
    Hanssens et al. [128] came up with a heat ﬁeld deformation sensor to measure sap\
    \ ﬂow\ndynamics through the tomato peduncle. Heat griddling of the peduncle was\
    \ performed to\ndifferentiate ﬂow of xylem and phloem with respect to developing\
    \ fruits.\nCapacitive sensors calculate SM on the basis of changes in soil capacitance\
    \ due to\ndifferences in water content [129]. Commercial UTs use capacitive sensors,\
    \ which are\nusually more accurate than resistive sensors but cost more [130].\
    \ Ground Penetrating\nRadars (GPR) [131] are based upon electromagnetic wave absorption\
    \ and reﬂection. SM\nsensing uses impulses, frequency sweeping, and frequency-modulated\
    \ technologies. This\nmethod is used for measuring soil moisture near the surface\
    \ (up to 10 cm). The most\nreliable soil humidity samples used in ﬁelds are neutron\
    \ scattering samples [132] and\nscattering samples use radiation methods for calculating\
    \ SM by estimating changes to the\nneutron ﬂux density due to water content of\
    \ the soil [133,134]. However, in such cases,\nspeciﬁc licenses are required to\
    \ carry out its implementation.\nNumerous research studies have been performed\
    \ to develop electrochemical devices\nfor various applications, which are known\
    \ as potentiostat [135–141]. Lately, an Arduino-\nbased potentiostat was fabricated\
    \ from cost-efﬁcient components and was able to execute\nsimple electrochemical\
    \ experiments, whereby the results were recorded and analyzed in a\nWindows operating\
    \ system via USB interface [136–138]. As an addition to Arduino-based\npotentiostat,\
    \ Raspberry Pi (RPi) controller was also used to execute the electrochemical\n\
    experiments, whereby the results were displayed on the LCD touch panel connected\
    \ to the\ncontroller [139]. Both Arduino- and Raspberry Pi-based potentiostat\
    \ have the potential to\nincorporate wireless sensors for data transmission; however,\
    \ these controllers do not con-\ntain a built-in Analog to Digital Converter (ADC)\
    \ and Digital to Analog Converter (DAC)\nwhich make the overall design more sophisticated.\
    \ In this regard, Hanisah et al. [142] came\nup with a portable Heavy Metal Potentiostat\
    \ (HMstat) to detect heavy metal composi-\ntion on-site. Their potentiostat comprised\
    \ a digital Control Signal Component (CSC) and\nthe electronic component, which\
    \ is the analog Potentiostat Read-out Circuit Component\n(PRCC), as shown in Figure\
    \ 5 [142]. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that both the Arduino\nand RPi controller\
    \ board do support the incorporation of various sensor modules. There-\nfore,\
    \ researchers have room to incorporate soil moisture and temperature sensors along\n\
    with other sensors depending on the slots available in the controller; thus, an\
    \ integrated\nsystem for soil moisture and heavy metal analysis can be developed.\n\
    Figure 5. (a) The HMstat consists of Control Signal Component (CSC) and Potentiostat\
    \ Read-out\nCircuit Component (PRCC) connected to the electrochemical cell (consisting\
    \ of Screen Printed\nElectrode Gold (SPGE) and (b) overall connection of HMstat\
    \ [142].\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n15 of 37\nOther soil physical properties\
    \ can be calculated to populate the map of the soil with\nother soil properties\
    \ such as soil organic content, pH, sand, silt particles percentage, and\nnutrients\
    \ such as Mg, P, OM, Ca, base saturation Mg, base saturation K, base saturation\n\
    Ca, CEC, and K/Mg [143–145]. In situ, calculating these properties in real time\
    \ also faces\nchallenges due to scale, cost, and technology limitations.\nIn precision\
    \ farming, some of the long-lasting decisions can be taken using yield\nmonitoring.\
    \ This method helps in providing spatial distribution of crop yields at the end\n\
    of the growing season [146,147]. Yield sensors are normally mounted on farm equipment\n\
    and capture yield data automatically in the course of the harvest. In particular,\
    \ mass\nﬂow sensors on grain containers are mounted to record grain inﬂows along\
    \ with the\nposition [148]. The collected data are analyzed with tools such as\
    \ ArchInfo, Mapinfo, and\nEnvironment System Analysis International [149].\nIn\
    \ order to get an insight into the crop yield combined with ﬁeld topography, Electrical\n\
    Conductivity (EC) sensors are used [150]. Soil’s ability to conduct current is\
    \ measured\nby electrical conductivity. EC assessment is used to assess the use\
    \ of phosphorus, cations\nin water, drainage, and rooting depths [150]. EC maps\
    \ are used for zoning the area. The\nzoning is also used to incorporate precision\
    \ agricultural practices such as variable rate irri-\ngation, variable rate seeding,\
    \ and drainage management. Electromagnetic Induction (EMI)\nmethods can be used\
    \ for the mapping of the EC by apparent Electrical Conductance (ECa)\nand Visible\
    \ Near Infrared Reﬂectance (VNIR) [151]. There are a number of commercial\ntools\
    \ available, i.e., Veris 3100, EC400 sensors in conjunction with GPS systems [149,152].\n\
    In the domain of soil sensing, macronutrients such as nitrogen, potassium, and\
    \ phos-\nphorus are essential to the growth of crops. The evaluation of these\
    \ nutrients helps to\nassess the effects of fertilizer and potential applications.\
    \ The optical detection is based\non reﬂectance spectroscopy to measure the macrosimulation’s\
    \ reﬂection and absorp-\ntion [153,154]. A sensing system using planar electromagnetic\
    \ sensors has been developed\nin the detection of nitrate and sulphate concentration\
    \ in natural water resources [155].\nThis approach is used to detect the amounts\
    \ of nitrate and sulphates by correlating\nthe impedance of the sensor array with\
    \ their concentration. The key approaches to soil\nmacronutrients include electrochemical,\
    \ VIS-NIRS, and ATR spectroscopy [149,152,156].\nThese approaches to soil macronutrients\
    \ are limited to sensing a single desired ion because\nthe membrane used in these\
    \ methods only reacts to one ion [157]. To achieve a simultane-\nous multi-ion\
    \ sensing, it is necessary to build a detector array for the sensing of soil macro\n\
    nutrients [158].\nThere are several opportunities to advance the state of precision\
    \ farming through\nthe utilization of the above discussed sensors. The following\

    WSNs typically consist of a large number of nodes that run in a particular conﬁgura-\n\
    tion. Usually, autonomous and spatially dispersed sensor nodes collaborate to\
    \ track and\ncollect environmental conditions. Data can be processed in central/decentralized\
    \ mode by\nsending data to a sink that transfers them to other networks (e.g.,\
    \ through a gateway). A\nbroad variety of application-speciﬁc limitations is included\
    \ in the project, design, prototype,\nand use of a WSN.\nThe BTnode is a Bluetooth-based\
    \ radio module and microcontroller for autonomous\nwireless communication [159].\
    \ BTnode is equipped with general purpose interfaces which\ncan be conﬁgured on\
    \ the basis of application speciﬁc requirement. BTnode can be utilized\nwith several\
    \ peripherals, i.e., sensors, actuators, RFID, and GPS receivers. A promising\n\
    factor of BTnode is its compact size of 6 × 4 cm with standard wireless interface.\
    \ A pictorial\ndescription of BTnode is shown in Figure 6. The device comprises\
    \ an Atmel ATmega128L\nmicrocontroller with on-chip memory and peripherals [160].\
    \ The microcontroller demon-\nstrates an 8-bit RISC core delivering up to 8 MIPS\
    \ at a maximum of 8 MHz. The on-chip\nmemory comprises a programmable in-built\
    \ 128 KB of ﬂash memory along with 4 KB of\nstatic RAM. Other integrated peripherals\
    \ consist of JTAG for debugging, timers, counters,\npulse-width modulation, and\
    \ 10-bit analog-to-digital converter.\nFigure 6. (a) Pictorial description of\

    \ are tightly\ncoupled to their applications and this can also be incorporated\
    \ over parallel programming\nparadigm to enhance processing and reduce execution\
    \ time [161,162]. A key aspect of Epic\nis the support of prototyping and reusability\

    \ of\nIrene Mote.\nFigure 8. Pictorial description and illustration of Irene Mote\

    \ with Cortex-M3 controller which is\ncompatible with IEEE 802.15.4 radio frequency\
    \ module. In addition, this module enables\ndevelopers to develop the wireless\
    \ module codes using an object-oriented programming\nlanguage like Java [169].\
    \ It also demonstrates the functionalities of external interfaces, i.e.,\nUSB,\
    \ CAN, and SPI, etc. [164,169].\nFigure 10. Preon32 sensor [170].\nThe Mica2 Mote\

    \ of the second and third century. In combination with the CC1000/CC2420\nRF Module,\

    \ ﬁtted with moisture, temperature,\nand light sensors [162]. These motes also\
    \ measure barometric pressure, seismic waves,\netc. [172–174].\nFigure 11. Mica2\
    \ Mote sensor [174].\nUsually, the sensor nodes of a WSN consist of three basic\
    \ building blocks: sensors,\ncomputer units, and communication units. The sensor\
    \ nodes need a working device, a\nrouting protocol, and eventually a simulator\
    \ to allow a WSN to function properly.\nThe most critical issues concerning WSN\
    \ include the lack of standardization of the\nhardware nodes, limited consumption\
    \ of energy, communication latency, out-of-order\nand loss of packets, distributed\
    \ reconﬁguration and scalability factors. In this regard, the\nOperating System\
    \ (OS) acts at the helm to arbitrate the resource access. It is worth noting\n\
    that the primary OS’s for WSNs are TinyOS, MANTIS, Contiki, Nano-RK, and LiteOS\
    \ [175].\nTinyOS (TOS) is open source, modular, component-based, module-speciﬁc\
    \ and built\nfor wireless sensor networks [176]. Nonetheless, this OS complies\
    \ with programs which\nrequire very low memory and also comprises numerous libraries\
    \ that manage network\nprotocols, distributed services, transducer drivers, and\
    \ data collection tools. TinyOS uses a\nmonolithic architecture class to construct\
    \ a static image on the node using the component\nmodel. TOS offers multithreading\
    \ support from version, named TOS Threads, using a\ncooperative threading approach.\
    \ In order to come up with a lightweight open source\nOS, Contiki was developed\
    \ by the Swedish Institute of Computer Science [177]. The\npromising factor of\
    \ Contiki is its portability factor which is based on an event-driven kernel.\n\
    Contiki includes so-called protothreads, which can be used at the individual process\
    \ level.\nNonetheless, Contiki includes many applications supporting features\
    \ like the multitasking\nkernel, preventive multithreading, prototype threads,\
    \ TCP/IP protocol, IPv6 protocol,\nlight telnet client, and quick web server etc.\
    \ [178]. It is worth noting that Contiki supports\ndynamic memory management;\
    \ it does not support applications in real time [179].\nWith the advent of cross\
    \ platform requirements, the multi-threaded WSN models were\ndeveloped. The MultimodAl\
    \ system for in situ wireless sensor (MANTIS) NeTworks [164]\nis a multi-threaded\
    \ WSN operating system. MANTIS is an easy-to-use OS that includes\nkernel, scheduler,\
    \ and network stack, and is compatible to be used across various platforms,\n\
    i.e., PDA or a PC.\nIn addition, Nano-RK was built for WSNs based on multitasking\
    \ [175]. The design\nobjectives for Nano-RK include multihop networking, effective\
    \ power management to ex-\ntend WSN lifetime, limited resources lighting applications,\
    \ and priority scheduling. LiteOS\nbased in Unix was developed by the University\
    \ of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign [164] in\norder to support the programming paradigm\
    \ for WSNs. LiteOS offers a familiar Unix,\nthread, and C programming environment\
    \ and is built using a hybrid programming model\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n20\

    \ support\nNow, the question is how the previously discussed sensors could be\
    \ deployed over an\nIoT-based High-Performance Computing (HPC) framework with\
    \ optimized scheduling. In\nthis regard, the next subsection discusses the signiﬁcance\
    \ of Edge Computing.\n3.2. Role of Edge Computing\nIt is essential to look at\
    \ data that can be processed immediately close to where the\ndata originate with\
    \ the help of edge. So, at the edge there is a requirement of some kind\nof storage,\
    \ computing ability to be able to take care of real-time processing needs. For\n\
    long-term retention for data analysis realistically, some planning activity is\
    \ to be done\nin the cloud. Therefore, if that is the case, then what kind of\
    \ storage solutions are we\nlooking at? In this regard, an edge needs to be designed\
    \ in such a way that it could possess\nlocal processing power needed in decision-making\
    \ ability and largely it is going to be\nright intensive. Thus, some storage is\
    \ required at the edge level which is going to be fast,\ni.e., largely of course\
    \ solid-state drive to overcome the issues of low latency. However, in\nthe current\
    \ scenario, data analysis and long-term planning are essential; therefore, users\n\
    may compromise with lower degrees of latencies, but the factor of storage remains\
    \ a\npriority. The prominent challenge in edge computing is with respect to the\
    \ volume of\nthe data. Having so many sensors deployed for computing, the heterogeneity\
    \ of data\nthemselves is another challenging issue. The coherency of data always\
    \ exists at the edge\nlevel and it is essential for the user to correlate the\
    \ data to discrete points, and without this\ncorrelation, one cannot get insights\
    \ for the generated data. Now, to maintain correlation\nof high-speed data becomes\
    \ another bottleneck in edge computing. To overcome this\nissue, the workﬂow optimization\
    \ along with energy aware scheduling criteria becomes\na necessity for edge computing.\
    \ In this regard, ﬂexibility and agility could be achieved\nwith lower cost, whereby\
    \ rapid provisioning of data could be enabled with continuous\ninnovation, free\
    \ ﬂow of data transmission could be observed to and from sensors without\nbeing\
    \ clogged, on demand analytics with hybrid cloud and multicloud deployments could\n\
    be met, and distributed storage could be created in order to manage high-volume\
    \ generated\ndata. Having mentioned the aforementioned parameters, it could be\
    \ asserted in a nutshell\nthat agility and ﬂexibility need to be maintained at\
    \ the seconds or subseconds level of\ncomputing to manage the real-time complex\
    \ problems. Nonetheless, this has become\npossible with the help of IoT device\
    \ sensors. Since at the edge level, a ﬁnite amount of\nstorage is being maintained,\
    \ therefore the workﬂow optimization is to be designed in such\na way that it\
    \ can meet the real-time computing demands in seconds or subseconds level, i.e.,\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n21 of 37\nthe deﬁned system needs to be able to address\
    \ this problem of getting the data that come in\nquickly and starting to process\
    \ them to gain some insights into certain correlation and then\nkeep that storage\
    \ free for the next set of data that is coming in. Therefore, with respect to\n\
    workﬂow optimization, we need to look at the set of devices which needs to be\
    \ employed\nto be able to address all the data that are coming in. In this context,\
    \ if a High-Performance\nComputing (HPC) framework could be set over the edge\
    \ level, then the aforementioned\nissues are feasible to be resolved. It is essential\
    \ for the working of HPC framework attached\nto the edge to smoothen the workﬂow\
    \ optimization and scheduling criteria.\nVarious edge nodes require various types\
    \ of resources. To this end, it is necessary\nto select an appropriate scheduling\
    \ approach to ensure the consistency of resources and\nthe availability of services.\
    \ Researchers have suggested resource continuity management\napproaches, such\
    \ as the layered model Fog to Cloud (F2C) and OpenFog Reference Archi-\ntecture\
    \ (OpenFog RA) [180,181].\nThe F2C layered model is a novel architecture focused\
    \ on data sharing and data inte-\ngration that can achieve service parallelization\
    \ and less service execution time. OpenFog\nRA has been designed to meet the same\
    \ F2C objective [181]. Therefore, researchers are\nproposing a distributed management\
    \ system incorporating edge and cloud tools to efﬁ-\nciently achieve resource\
    \ consistency within a traditional hierarchical architecture [181,182].\nLi et\
    \ al. [183] came up with EveryLite, a lightweight scripting language for resource-\n\
    constrained, heterogeneous edge devices. Such tasks which are both time-limited\
    \ and\nspace-complex are referred to as microtasks by interfaces in the migration\
    \ process. In edge\ncomputing, EveryLite can perform microtasks. Kang et al. [184]\
    \ designed a lightweight\nscheduler that can automatically schedule tasks of different\
    \ layers of Deep Neural Networks\n(DNN) between mobile devices and the cloud data\
    \ center without proﬁling each program.\nBy becoming adapted to the lightweight\
    \ scheduler, working professionals can be adapted to\na range of low-latency and\
    \ energy-efﬁcient DNN architectures, hardware systems, wireless\nnetworks, and\
    \ server workloads.\nBy embracing cooperative competition and game theory, Zhang\
    \ et al. [122] established\nCoGTA, a system for allocation of tasks. For edge\
    \ computing systems, CoGTA aims at\ndelay-sensitive and social-sensing applications.\
    \ CoGTA may tackle a few crucial problems,\nsuch as Bottom-up Game-theoretic Task\
    \ Allocation (BGTA). Similarly, the Markovian\nstochastic channel was used by\
    \ Zhang et al. [185] to provide an optimal solution and\nofﬂoad strategy for collaborative\
    \ operation between cloud and edge devices. This problem\nof minimal energy scheduling\
    \ tasks can be formulated on directed acyclic graphs as a\nrestricted, shortest\
    \ path problem. This problem is then solved using the regular Lagrange\nRelaxation-dependent\
    \ Aggregated Cost (LARAC) algorithm.\nKwak et al. [186] suggested a dynamic allocation\
    \ algorithm for CPU/network resource\nor task in the mobile networking context.\
    \ To scale the CPU/network speed, they used\nthe Lyapunov optimization technique.\
    \ Meanwhile, Liang et al. [187] proposed a new\napproach to resource management\
    \ by taking into account both bandwidth availability and\nsource selection.\n\
    Data are distributed in edge computing which requires distributed data processing,\n\
    storage, and networking resources [0]. In addition, edge devices tend to be heterogeneous,\n\
    leading to a heterogeneous runtime environment and heterogeneous data on-edge\
    \ device.\nFurthermore, resources are limited on edge apps. As such, proposing\
    \ an optimum, complex,\nand energy-aware scheduling strategy in edge computing\
    \ is complicated. If resource\nabstraction and edge OS management would allow\
    \ developers to focus on their applications\nwithout trying to think about hardware,\
    \ connectivity, and code written for speciﬁc devices,\nthis would be a huge leap\
    \ forward for complex projects to be realized. This will reduce\ncomplexity, simplify\
    \ growth, and reduce edge computing costs for the ecosystem.\n3.3. HPC on Edge\
    \ (HPCE)\nThis new High-Performance Computing (HPC) solution seeks to move beyond\
    \ the\nagricultural services offered on edge and provide a comprehensive platform\
    \ for precision\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n22 of 37\nfarming and animal husbandry\
    \ and furnish with utility not only for farmers but also for\nstakeholders. The\
    \ HPCE architecture is adapted from CYBELE conceptual framework [2].\nThe HPCE\
    \ model uses open and proprietary vast amounts of datasets, including sensor\n\
    readings, as well as satellite data and historic climatic and environmental information\
    \ for\nready reference. While this would be the most effective way to use HPC\
    \ technology, it\nonly uses the latest software platforms and projects that are\
    \ being developed by HPCE’s e-\ncontrolled services, as well as increased HPC\
    \ e-infrastructure to enable huge heterogeneous\ndata processing to be done and\
    \ ﬁnd modern solutions to complex problems using dedicated\nalgorithms. Due to\
    \ the interconnection of large-oriented approaches, varying datasets,\nand available\
    \ big data techniques, it is possible to scale distributed big data research to\n\
    enormous scales when holding many types of datasets together in one place [2].\
    \ In doing\nso, it enables the aggregated data and metadata to be aligned semantically\
    \ to a standard\nscheme and data model and enables advanced data analytics to\
    \ take secret information\ninto account. In addition to this, the HPCE architecture\
    \ will also help in gaining insights\nfrom adaptive data visualization services.\n\
    With reference to CYBELE [2], the architectural approach of the HPC on edge is\n\
    illustrated in Figure 12. By organizing a product component based on interdependencies,\n\
    this is intended to highlight the importance of pipelines being constructed to\
    \ promote\ncompatibility and show how to maintain the integrity of interdependent\
    \ services. It is worth\nnoting that CYBELE resonates well with the EdgeX platform\
    \ architecture. EdgeX platform\ncomprises four core services, i.e., device services,\
    \ core services, supporting services, and\napplication services to enable smooth\
    \ workﬂow optimization [188]. In addition, it will be\ninteresting to see a synchronization\
    \ of EdgeX with a dedicated HPC framework for faster\nbatch processing of data\
    \ over edge.\nFigure 12. High Performance Computing on Edge.\nBig, heterogeneous\
    \ data are made available through repositories powered by HPC\nwhich is responsible\
    \ for the processing at the edge layer. In this regard, as can be seen in\nFigure\
    \ 11, HPC frameworks such as Spark, Hadoop, YARN, Big Deep Learning (BigDL),\n\
    Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), and Kubernetes are deployed for the batch processing\
    \ of\ndata using distributed framework attached to the edge layer [189]. It is\
    \ worth noting that\nSpark and BigDL are the widely used frameworks in many organizations\
    \ for their open\nsource and high degree of interoperability features. Spark and\
    \ BigDL are based on MapRe-\nduce framework which has high room for tuning for\
    \ smooth workﬂow optimization [190].\nThe transmission of the application process\
    \ interface along with data from the cloud layer\nto the edge layer is conducted\
    \ using 4G/5G or ﬁber/DOCSIS/DSL communication system.\nThis is seen on the middle\
    \ section of the architecture as shown in Figure 12. At ﬁrst,\nAgriculture 2021,\
    \ 11, 475\n23 of 37\nthe data are processed in the background prior to being passed\
    \ on to the check-in stage\nfor data validator or timestamp validator for resolution\
    \ of data veriﬁcation and timing\nproblems. Once data are obtained in edge layer,\
    \ quality checks are conducted to identify\nanomalies and any other data irregularities,\
    \ maintaining their accuracy and validity, which\nare accompanied by a series\
    \ of measures aligned with processes of data cleansing.\nFinally, the HPE data\
    \ provenance service provides the mechanisms required for\nrecording all relevant\
    \ information concerning incoming data of interest. With HPE, the\ndata provenance\
    \ platform is inherently connected to the data policy and asset brokerage\nengine\
    \ that enables the platform to bind data providers and data users with data share\n\
    and business features. In addition to facilitating interoperability and reuse\
    \ of data, the\ninspected data are annotated and harmonized semantically. Since\
    \ the data come from a\nvariety of physically distributed data sources, a standard\
    \ data model will be created for\nthe semantic deﬁnition and annotation of the\
    \ data. To facilitate the pipeline and allow the\nvarious heterogeneous components\
    \ to communicate seamlessly, the model will be used as\na common language to annotate\
    \ data and exchange messages between the components.\nClean and semantically uplifted\
    \ data are then available, i.e., open and proprietary data to\nbe queried, analyzed,\
    \ and viewed. An exempliﬁcation of how ground sensors have their\ndata stored\
    \ and analyzed at cloud data base is shown in Figure 13. The on-ﬁeld data are\n\
    continuously assessed by a real-time monitoring system to ensure triggering effects\
    \ if any\nthreshold point is crossed. Simultaneously, the on-ﬁeld data are also\
    \ stored in the cloud\ndatabase from where the user can download the required\
    \ data and at the same time, data\nanalysis could be applied using the machine\
    \ learning tools stored over the cloud database.\nFigure 13. Illustration for\
    \ storage and analysis of data from ground sensors to cloud database.\nTo facilitate\
    \ simulation execution, a deﬁned experimental composition setting is de-\nsigned,\
    \ as shown in the top right part of the architecture (cloud layer) in Figure 12.\
    \ The\ncomposition framework of experiments aims to support the separate design,\
    \ development,\nand execution of big data research procedures, the support of\
    \ embedded scientiﬁc compu-\ntation and reproductive tests. In the analysis method,\
    \ its subsequent template is selected\nto provide each analytical template with\
    \ its own software and execution endpoint and\nallow the user to modify the appropriate\
    \ conﬁguration variables (i.e., input algorithm,\nexecution parameters, netting\
    \ parameters, and output parameters). The results of each\nanalytical template\
    \ are presented. The composition system for experiments will promote\nthe design\
    \ and implementation of data analysis workﬂows consisting of a number of data\n\
    analysis procedures, interconnected in terms of data sources and input and output\
    \ artifacts.\nThe outcome will constitute the input to another research template\
    \ when a template is\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n24 of 37\nexecuted. The output\
    \ of the research model is an object for session that contains all the\nmemory\
    \ output values.\nIn addition to big data, advanced analysis must be implemented\
    \ when selecting input\ndatasets and developing workﬂows. For HPCE, advanced analytical\
    \ algorithms are avail-\nable to stakeholders that allow them to explore various\
    \ forms of data visually and to ﬁnd\nand solve new trends. In order to achieve\
    \ improved delivery and monitoring, machining\nand predictive modelling methods\
    \ should be modiﬁed so as to handle the predictive life\ncycle of data planning,\
    \ detection, and analysis. However, the implementation of advanced\nanalytics\
    \ along with huge, complex data increases the need for strong computing power\n\
    and a higher processing memory, so that information can be collected within a\
    \ realistic\ntimeframe. When the test cases are executed, multiple HPC attributes\
    \ are needed, including\nstorage power, speed of the device, memory capacity,\
    \ and quick turnaround time.\nThe next section discusses the IoT-based communication\
    \ methodologies in edge\ncomputing used for precision farming developed by several\
    \ researchers.\n3.4. Edge Computing in Precision Farming\nIoT incorporation in\
    \ precision farming has brought about changes in the communica-\ntions of actuators\
    \ and sensors with remote servers. With respect to networking technologies,\n\
    modern IoT-capable nodes provide new energy-saving transceivers and network topologies\n\
    that are tailored to ﬁeld conditions where mobile and WiFi base stations are rare\
    \ [191].\nMultiple topologies that use wireless sensor networks can route data\
    \ messages via commu-\nnication nodes to reach a gateway with the internet connectivity,\
    \ as shown in the proposal\nfrom Akka and Sokullu [192].\nMore recent developments\
    \ with IoT involve network protocols to communicate\nthrough the internet with\
    \ remote devices via applications designed for data reduction. For\nmonitoring\
    \ purposes, for example [191,193,194], researchers used the MQTT protocol for\n\
    data collection from sensor nodes at greenhouses. These protocols allowed the\
    \ gathering\nand analysis by Shukla et al. of data at intermediate cloud middleware\
    \ [195]. A further\nexpanded analysis of this topic can be found in the work of\
    \ Kalox et al. [196]. A gateway\nusing ZigBee collects data from a real deployment\
    \ of sensors, which are then sent to a\ndata cloud driven by FIWARE through web-based\
    \ protocols. The work takes advantage\nof open interfaces to build a number of\
    \ client applications that can access the cloud mod-\nule. However, no IoT protocols\
    \ are used, and only an early version of FIWARE is used.\nMartinez et al. [197]\
    \ presented research on how to handle crops in PA environments using\nthe cloud\
    \ plane. The FIWARE core is used here, along with a collection of additional en-\n\
    ablers, to communicate with IoT gateways through a variety of protocols, such\
    \ as Message\nQueuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) or Constrained Application Protocol\
    \ (CoAP), where\ncurrent and historical data are stored in the cloud for analytics.\
    \ The output of FIWARE\nis assessed for PA using a collection of synthetic tests,\
    \ but no real implementation of the\nproposal is provided. As per Zyrianoff et\
    \ al. [198], a reﬁned optimization has to be made in\nFIWARE to get it implemented\
    \ over fog computing domain.\nThe incorporation of intermediate processing stages\
    \ in the data path is an evolution\nof mainly cloud-based platforms. Before sending\
    \ monitored data to the cloud, Liu [199]\nperformed local preprocessing at data\
    \ collection gateways. Ferrandez-Pastor et al. [200]\nexpanded on this concept\
    \ by evaluating a range of IoT protocols and technologies in a\nreal hydroponic\
    \ implementation to achieve effective computation-ofﬂoading. Moreover, a\nsimilar\
    \ method for computation ofﬂoading was also implemented by Chang et al. [201]\n\
    in the domain of aeroponics. However, in these works, a lack of ﬂexibility is\
    \ noticeable\nin the way edge computing is implemented, and this layer is exclusively\
    \ oriented to data\nfusion. Guillen et al. [202] proposed a hybridization of Artiﬁcial\
    \ Intelligence (AI) with IoT\nin precision agriculture. However, it was found\
    \ that there is still a big gap between AI and\nIoT due to computational resources.\
    \ In this regard, they proposed an inclusion of Graphical\nProcessing Unit (GPU)\
    \ in the edge device to enhance the computational services [202]. For\nan efﬁcient\
    \ computation ofﬂoading, Chen et al. [203] proposed ThriftyEdge which has the\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n25 of 37\nsubstantial potential to support computational\
    \ intensive tasks by proper ofﬂoading across\nlocal device and edge cloud in proximity.\
    \ ThriftyEdge is well suited to be deployed in ad\nhoc networks for precision\
    \ agriculture [203].\nThe IoT-based generic monitoring system was deﬁned by Oliver\
    \ et al. [204]. It was\ndeployed and validated on ﬂoriculture domain, with a setup\
    \ of monitoring weather and\nsoil conditions. Strategically, the goal was to foresee\
    \ such diseases which could impede\nplantations proactively. For example, bacterial\
    \ leaf spots, damp-off root rots, soft rots, and\nbacterial spots are among such\
    \ diseases. HPE’s overall architecture is cloud-centric and\nuses an edge computer\
    \ node to gather information from the distributed sensor network.\nMySense is\
    \ a generic framework for the rapid development and use of precision wine sce-\n\
    narios monitoring application [205]. It consists of four layers, including sensors/actuators,\n\
    WSN/gateway, web, and cloud applications. For local tasks and real-time alarm\
    \ generation,\nfog computing is used on the WSN/gateway layer. The platform was\
    \ used in a winery to\nstudy the dynamics of diseases in the current microclimatic\
    \ setting.\nThe necessary ingredient that makes farming operations work is consistent,\
    \ productive\nsoil. Lavanya et al. [206] came up with an Internet-of-Things-based\
    \ sensing framework\nfor assessing nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium (NPK) concentrations\
    \ in soil. In order to\nallow a colorimetric approach in the sensor, Light Dependent\
    \ Resistors (LDR) and Light\nEmitting Diodes (LEDs) were used. A fuzzy rule-based\
    \ method implemented on an edge\ncomputer using Raspberry Pi was used to assess\
    \ the sensed values pertaining to nutrient\ndeﬁciency. To assess other nutrient\
    \ shortages, additional rules were added to this rationale.\nThis method was low-cost\
    \ and provided a quick alternative compared to laboratory testing\nmethods, which\
    \ take a longer time and are also costly. Soil fertility is optimized by assisting\n\
    farmers in effectively managing their soil nutrition, resulting in cost savings,\
    \ improved\nﬁeld management, and increased environmental conservation by eliminating\
    \ runoff and\nleaching pollution. Park et al. [207] presented an exemplary case\
    \ study in the domain\nof tomato production that demonstrated how edge computing\
    \ generated scalable data\nanalytics. In this case, a Raspberry Pi served as a\
    \ sensor setup base station and a network\nedge node. On the edge node, a prediction\
    \ analysis was implemented for the growth state\nof cherry tomato, and the data\
    \ generated were sent to a cloud-based central server for\nmodel integration and\
    \ analytical interpretation to gain insights to predict results. This\nstrategy\
    \ not only reduces data ﬂow, but it also allows farmers to preserve their data.\n\
    Atmospheric temperature is a critical factor for the productivity of plants, and\
    \ in\nthis regard, it plays a prominent role in irrigation planning and greenhouse\
    \ management.\nKrintz et al. [208] used Single Spectrum Analysis (SSA) along with\
    \ linear regression to\nintroduce a temperature forecast system using low-cost\
    \ microcontrollers and single board\ncomputer. The introduction of edge computing\
    \ in their methodological paradigm drasti-\ncally reduced the factor of latency.\
    \ The advantageous part of their developed system is\nthat the farmers can opt\
    \ for a microclimate monitoring network rather than installing a\nsophisticated\
    \ weather station.\nFan and Gao [209] also looked at task parallelism in mobile\
    \ edge computing. An\nofﬂoading delay may arise because of the transmission characteristics.\
    \ In addition, com-\nputation delay normally happens over cloud transactions while\
    \ determining when to\ncontinue with the operation. Merelli et al. [210] looked\
    \ at edge computing as a foundation\nfor metagenomics research in agriculture,\
    \ and found feasibility for remote microbial studies\nof water, air, and soil.\
    \ Traditional methods for metagenomics research necessitate a large\namount of\
    \ data transfer to the cloud. However, with the advent of advanced edge tech-\n\
    nologies, remote analyses can be performed, and the results can be sent to the\
    \ cloud using\na combination of System-on-a-Chip (SoC) and edge computing. A mix\
    \ of edge and cloud\nprovides a highly appealing approach to provide complete\
    \ analysis workﬂows. The results\nof the experiments revealed a 95 percent reduction\
    \ in data streaming, thereby demonstrat-\ning the feasibility of metagenomic research\
    \ at a remote level. For singular analyses, an edge\nsolution is feasible. On\
    \ the other hand, a subsequent work by the authors in the domain of\nmetagenomics\
    \ revealed that shifting computation to the cloud improves cost and efﬁciency\n\
    Agriculture 2021, 11, 475\n26 of 37\nas the frequency of analyses increases [211].\
    \ Nonetheless, if AI and blockchain can be\nincorporated over IoT services, then\
    \ the farmers and the stakeholders will obtain a better\nunderstanding of the\
    \ crops along with a fast and easy way to characterize genetically\nmodiﬁed crops\
    \ [212]. In addition, with the help of AI, water usage can be optimized and it\n\
    will also be possible to determine whether the treated wastewater is suitable\
    \ for irrigation at\na given point in time and what are the relevant crops on\
    \ which the treated wastewater can\nbe used, depending upon its composition [212].\

    \ technologies which can provide economically competitive domain to farm-\ning\
    \ sector along with ﬁnancial viability whilst enhancing environmental efﬁciency\
    \ and\nbeing socially acceptable are the need of the hour in terms of sustainability.\
    \ However, given\nthe availability of capital, meeting these sustainability targets\
    \ would often entail trade-offs.\nFurthermore, the objectives are “moving goals”\
    \ that must adapt to new problems and pri-\norities. Technological advancements\
    \ are rapid; however, their deployment in the farming\nsector remains incomplete.\
    \ It is quite common practice with the farmers in developing\nnations that they\
    \ tend to opt for trial-and-error methods in technology adoption rather than\n\
    following a systematic way. This could have signiﬁcant consequences for farm structure\n\
    and the number of farmers who will be able to make a living in the future.\n4.1.\
    \ Awareness Regarding the Latest Ongoing Technology\nAn initiative toward better\
    \ farmer education and training along with the help of\nﬁnancial resources, non-government\
    \ organizations, the media, and the general public\ncan contribute to making sustainable\
    \ farm technology adoption easier. Dedicated laws\ncan be put forward by the government\
    \ which may comprise incentives and disincentives\nfor the adoption of the latest\
    \ technology. Environmental laws along with zoning codes,\nanimal welfare guidelines,\
    \ and public health policies, are increasingly constraining farmers’\nactions.\
    \ In this regard, there is a deemed requirement for tailored digital technology\
    \ which\nthe farmers should get acquainted with. However, because of the numerous\
    \ parameters\ncomprising policy factors and economic situation at the helm in\
    \ different contexts, there is\nno adequate explanation for why farmers implement\
    \ speciﬁc technologies. Therefore, it\nbecomes necessary for the respective governments\
    \ to furnish substantial knowledge and\ninfrastructure to farmers to uplift their\
    \ respective agriculture segments.\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n27 of 37\n4.2.\
    \ Government Support to Provide Adequate Infrastructure\nIt is important to determine\
    \ which innovations are most effective in particular situa-\ntions in respective\
    \ agricultural segments and it is also important to ensure an appropriate\nmechanism\
    \ to provide incentives to promote the achievement of sustainability goals for\
    \ the\nbeneﬁt of global welfare. Rationale for priorities of food production in\
    \ an environmentally\nfriendly way is often accomplished by the use of suitable\
    \ technologies. To achieve these\nobjectives, some goals need to be tweaked in\
    \ agricultural activities by aligning interests\nwith those goals. Additional\
    \ perks can be allocated to the farmers who understand the\nbeneﬁts from technology\
    \ and practice them.\nMore follow-up is needed in monitoring the implementation\
    \ of innovations in order\nto ensure transparency in policy factor and research\
    \ activities pertaining to the adoption\nof new technology in the agrisector.\
    \ Post implementation evaluations of results will\nhelp to correct mistakes before\
    \ too much money is pumped into the wrong segment.\nThis is critical because agricultural\
    \ innovations come from a variety of places. Rating\ntechnologies and predicting\
    \ potential future patterns will aid policymakers in moving\ntoward sustainable\
    \ agriculture.\nA broader participatory approach involving a variety of stakeholders\
    \ would promote\nthe implementation of innovations for sustainable farming systems.\
    \ Farmers along with\nconsumer groups and the associated agricultural food industry\
    \ who are inclined towards\nsustainable farming should be included as stakeholders.\
    \ Since sustainable technologies\nare applied at the farm level, therefore the\
    \ farmers must be involved in the technology\nadoption discussion. In an ideal\
    \ world, there will be a stronger sense of ownership in\nthe selection of technology\
    \ in the entire agricultural food chain. Farmers’ adoption of\ntechnology is inﬂuenced\
    \ by the associated industries. However, the industrial segment\nshould learn\
    \ from the farmers’ requirements, which will help them to standardize the latest\n\
    technology, which in turn will make a substantial impact on the farming sector.\n\
    4.3. Soil Analysis to Promote Variety of Crop Growth\nIn countries where farming\
    \ is still done in the conventional way, farmers grow crops\nby planting without\
    \ understanding the properties of soil and its quality. As a result of this,\n\
    in the long run, farmers will not beneﬁt from the amount of money they will earn\
    \ from\ntheir farming. The current soil testing process uses a manual method which\
    \ ﬁrst involves\nthe sampling of soil and then the submission of samples to laboratories\
    \ for analysis. Due\nto the lengthy and laborious process, this manual process\
    \ is inefﬁcient. Because of human\ninterference, there is a risk of human error.\
    \ As a result, farmers could obtain inaccurate\ninformation. In that case, there\
    \ is a need for an automated method for soil testing and crop\nprediction. Soil\
    \ testing is crucial because soil testing assists in understanding the fertility\n\
    of soil and this allows predictions to be made about the potential crop yield.\
    \ Therefore,\na system could be proposed that consists of a handheld device which\
    \ will provide a pH\nreading and will help estimate the quantity of nitrogen (N),\
    \ phosphorus (P), and potassium\n(K) in the soil. In addition, a classiﬁcation\
    \ algorithm can be developed to determine\ncrops suitable for speciﬁc applications\
    \ based on the data obtained from the system, and\naccordingly the appropriate\
    \ fertilizers for the ﬁeld can be provided.\n4.4. Providing Meteorological Services\
    \ to the Farmers\nBringing weather and climate knowledge into agricultural decision\
    \ making has con-\ntributed to an increase in agricultural production in many\
    \ countries. However, in develop-\ning countries where several small farms are\
    \ rain-fed, it is difﬁcult to get access to weather\nand climate information to\
    \ help direct decision making. Government ofﬁcials should\nconsider this critical\
    \ knowledge which is useful to farmers and others dealing with poverty\nand hunger.\
    \ This situation continues because national meteorological and hydrological\n\
    services in developing countries do not receive adequate funding to cover the\
    \ expense of\ndelivering these services to the farmers. The government lacks substantial\
    \ information\nabout the signiﬁcant role of meteorological services which contribute\
    \ to the socioeconomic\nAgriculture 2021, 11, 475\n28 of 37\ndevelopment of the\
    \ nation. This state of obliviousness prevails even though governments\nconfront\
    \ multiple challenging issues in the realm of agriculture, water resources manage-\n\
    ment, health, and disaster risk mitigation, all of which are heavily affected\
    \ by weather\nand environment.\nDespite repeated periods of drought and crop failure,\
    \ as well as occasional famines,\nﬂooding often leads to losses of human life\
    \ and major property destruction. In addition,\nit also causes wide-ranging impacts\
    \ on socioeconomic growth. Therefore, it is only with\nthe advent of recent development\
    \ that there has been substantial study into quantifying\nthe beneﬁts of weather\
    \ and climate knowledge-related services. It is deemed necessary to\ntake small\
    \ steps by undertaking pilot projects to research the socioeconomic gains of using\n\
    weather and climate information-related services in agriculture.\n4.5. Yield Production\n\
    The feasibility of smart farming relies on internet connectivity and a panel to\
    \ accom-\nmodate the sensor hub. Using these features, it has become easier for\
    \ the farmers to monitor\nthe process of cultivation using their smart devices.\
    \ With the aid of sensors and intercon-\nnectivity, the smart farming initiative\
    \ helps farmers to optimize the consumption of water,\npesticide, and fertilizers\
    \ to maintain the yield quality by maintaining several parameters\nsuch as soil\
    \ condition, level of pesticide, temperature, and humidity. The system can be\n\
    made more successful by combining the fertilization and pesticide spraying systems,\
    \ all of\nwhich can be managed with an IoT application. Farmers may decide which\
    \ variety of crop\nis compatible for cultivation with their respective farm. Accordingly,\
    \ the farmers can opt\nfor innovative technologies such as drone-based farming\
    \ and various weather prediction\ntools, etc.\nYoung agropreneurs involved in\
    \ cultivation business can beneﬁt from smart farming\nin terms of farm maintenance,\
    \ irrigation, fertilization, and pesticide application. The\nsensors in the smart\
    \ farming paradigm are tailored to report various readings, including\nmeasurements\
    \ pertaining to the number of pesticides and fertilizers, irrigation pump\nstatus,\
    \ humidity, and temperature. The readings also provide details pertaining to the\n\
    growth timeline of the crop, as well as the crop type, i.e., when it was grown,\
    \ the date it\nwas cultivated, and how much was harvested. In agriculture, IoT\
    \ is seen as a prominent\nand promising factor in the agricultural domain which\
    \ can boost the yield in a quick\nmanner. In addition, the smart farming paradigm\
    \ can also serve as an avenue for the\nstartup companies to invest in.\n4.6. Sustainable\
    \ Land Use\nThere have been empirical studies that have attempted to quantify\
    \ the effect of agri-\ncultural policies associated with land use sustainability;\
    \ however, these studies turned out\nto be inconclusive. Although different opinions\
    \ on the relationship between prices and soil\ndeterioration derive from differences\
    \ in discount rates and risk aversion preferences, it is\nimportant to deﬁne these\
    \ differences as this allows for better clariﬁcation when participat-\ning in\
    \ discussions with others. To understand the impacts of changes in relative prices\
    \ on\nagricultural resource distribution, four different responses can be distinguished:\
    \ (i) expan-\nsion of the total agricultural area (extensiﬁcation); (ii) rise\
    \ in the number of agricultural\ninputs used, also known as intensiﬁcation; (iii)\
    \ change in technology; and (iv) change in\ncrop choices. A differentiation is\
    \ to be made among recurring costs that are capable of\nraising productivity and\
    \ ﬁxed asset investments that work to enhance soil quality in the\nlong term.\n\
    If greater agricultural production occurs as a result of increased area, impact\
    \ on the\nenvironment in terms of deforestation, overgrazing, ﬂooding, and sedimentation\
    \ is a likely\nresult. If there are changes in cropping activities at the same\
    \ time as the expansion of\nthe land area, then the new cropping activities will\
    \ have an effect due to the soil quality\nthat depends on the negative impacts\
    \ of previous cropping activities on the resource.\nTherefore, it is unclear whether\
    \ the interplay among agricultural policies, along with\nAgriculture 2021, 11,\
    \ 475\n29 of 37\nthe supply response of farmers and the implications for sustainable\
    \ land use has been\nadequately explored.\n5. Conclusions\nThe scope of the current\
    \ paper is to introduce and pave the way for smart sensing\nwith edge computing\
    \ technology in the developing nations, whose gross domestic product\nrelies substantially\
    \ on agriculture. In this regard, the applicability of various sensing\ntechnologies\
    \ with an ease of edge computing has been put forward in this paper. Smart\nsensors\
    \ offer intriguing possibilities for precision agriculture. As of now, ongoing\
    \ research\nin edge computing and smart sensing for agricultural domain is only\
    \ in its initial stage.\nNonetheless, prototypes of edge computing systems have\
    \ already been developed by\nmany researchers for speciﬁc agricultural domains;\
    \ however, the interpretability of edge\ncomputing techniques with various sensing\
    \ units still remains a challenge. There is a\nneed to set up and deploy cost-effective\
    \ high-performance computing-based edge nodes\nto enable smooth data ﬂow operations\
    \ for precision agriculture. Implementing these\nsophisticated and efﬁcient edge\
    \ technologies will solve these issues and in a broader\nperspective, this will\
    \ open up a new segment for farmers in developing nations. In\naddition to this,\
    \ a major problem to be dealt with in this context is inadequate internet\nconnectivity,\
    \ which is seen as a global issue and which affects the growth of developing\n\
    and underdeveloped nations because not every region of the world has access to\
    \ the\ninternet. In a nutshell, to uplift the agricultural domain in developing\
    \ nations, a dedicated\ncost-effective infrastructure is required which can completely\
    \ digitize the farming sector in\nthe best possible way.\nAuthor Contributions:\

  limitations: The paper can be improved by incorporating the limitations of the proposed
    methodology. There is a need to address the shortcomings of the proposed methodology,
    such as potential technical issues related to the network bandwidth, data security,
    and compatibility between different devices and systems. Additionally, the scope
    of the proposed methodology can be expanded by discussing the potential applications
    of edge computing in other domains of agriculture, such as livestock management
    and crop monitoring.

  title: 'Smart Sensing with Edge Computing in Precision Agriculture for Soil Assessment
    and Heavy Metal Monitoring: A Review'
  verbatim_quote1: To achieve this purpose, this analysis first discusses the different
    causes of heavy metal contamination in the soil ecosystem and its relevance to
    the health of human beings.
  verbatim_quote2: It is worth noting that developing nations lack the infrastructure
    for precision agriculture; therefore, it has become necessary to come up with
    a methodological paradigm which can accommodate a complete model to connect ground
    sensors to the compute nodes in a cost-effective way by keeping the data processing
    limitations and constraints in consideration.

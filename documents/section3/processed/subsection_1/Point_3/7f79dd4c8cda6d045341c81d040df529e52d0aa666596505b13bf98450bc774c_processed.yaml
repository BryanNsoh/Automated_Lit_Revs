    Explore all metrics Abstract Due to recent advancements and the success of versatile
    mobile applications, more and more services around the globe are being moved to
    the cloud. As a result, its limitations have become more evident. The major issues
    that cloud-based applications face include large latency, bottlenecks because
    of central processing, compromised security, and lack of offline processing. The
    drawbacks of cloud computing are reduced by fog and edge computing, where data
    are processed near the places where it is generated—at network edges or fog nodes—most
    importantly in a distributed way. Smart agriculture is an approach based on the
    Internet of Things (IoT) where cloud computing is not an option as the internet
    is usually not available at remote sites. In addition, pure edge computing also
    is not practical, as most sensor nodes are very small and they do not have enough
    computing power. Intermediate fog computing also is not a good choice, as fixed
    fog nodes (getaway nodes) do not work well with high node fluctuation caused by
    bad weather or harsh conditions. Considering these issues and limitations, we
    have proposed the idea of flying edge computing where an unmanned aerial vehicle
    (UAV) acts as an edge-computing machine. This can be an ideal solution for smart
    agriculture, given the size and remoteness of many agricultural areas. This technique
    can be called “wind or breeze computing” because the data are “blown” or moved
    by the current of computing. The Flying-Edge offers fast deployment of edge facilities
    in challenging locations and it can be a major step to accomplish the goal of
    IoT-based smart agriculture. Similar content being viewed by others Enabling Edge

    The agriculture sector faces continuous pressure to feed the population of over
    9 billion that is expected by 2050 amid challenges like climate change and the
    limited availability of arable land. To address this situation, scientists and
    researchers have suggested augmenting this sector with modern technologies including
    the Internet of Things (IoT) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) [1]. For example,
    IoTs provide updates about crop health, which helps farmers make the right decision
    at the right time. Precision agriculture is all about collecting the right data
    at the right time so that the use of resources can be optimized by considering
    the requirements of every inch of farmland. To make agriculture sustainable using
    the IoT has moved to the forefront of various agricultural operations. Moreover,
    UAVs are being used for various purposes in agriculture like monitoring, aerial
    sensing, tracking, data collection, communication, and security. UAVs, more precisely
    called flying-robots, are used in a wide range of applications where they often
    act as the first responder because of their fast, cost-effective, and safe deployment
    capabilities [2,3,4]. Further, with improved technology and facilities like three-dimensional
    maneuverability, UAVs are playing the crucial role of airborne base stations in
    almost all emerging networks. Because of their involvement in a wide range of
    daily applications, UAVs have become the best candidates to achieve the goal of
    precision farming [5]. Due to these capabilities, UAVs can be used throughout
    the life cycle of crops in such functions as soil health inspections [6], plantation
    [7], plant counting [8], crop health monitoring [9] [10], irrigation, spraying
    fertilizers and pesticides [11], and estimating crop yield. This technology has
    become the point of interest for all the stakeholders related to agriculture—including
    farmers, agronomists, crop insurers, and researchers—because of its suitability
    and advanced functionalities. These include the variety of models, longer flight
    times, greater payload capacities, and the ability to fly in varying conditions.
    In this article UAVs are proposed as an option to overcome the wide range of challenges
    from remote agriculture: They need to cover large geographical areas. A wide range
    of sensors and other devices are needed to monitor various parameters in this
    highly heterogeneous environment. They need to operate in remote locations, where
    sensors operate unattended. Connecting the sensors is a challenge because of unreliable
    and fluctuating communications. Some parameters must report in real-time. Many
    parameters require scalable data storage and processing capabilities. In this
    article, UAVs provide communication and data collection service to IoT nodes.
    Once data are collected, the next question is where to process it and what computation
    model is best suitable to provide the required services to the IoT nodes. For
    instance, cloud services can be used to access information from predictive analysis
    institutes so farmers apply products according to their specific requirements.
    However, for critical IoT-based agriculture applications to operate in such challenging
    areas, they need a reliable communication medium between the deployed objects
    and processing devices, which cannot be guaranteed in large and remote areas.
    Under these circumstances, cloud computing is not a good option because the internet
    may not be available in wide agriculture fields [12]. Furthermore, so-called fog
    computing also does not fit well since fog nodes are difficult to fix in harsh
    environments where node fluctuations are often. Most importantly, when we talk
    about specific applications in agriculture, edge computing may suffer from the
    fact that most nodes are very small, and they might not have sufficient processing
    capabilities. The need for scalability, economy, and node updates can generate
    more challenges. In short, in large farming areas where no reliable communication
    network is available to connect a large number of sensors to provide timely data,
    it is difficult to use existing fog and edge computing platforms. Considering
    the challenge, this paper presents the idea of a Flying-Edge, a UAV-based computing
    platform that aims to fulfill the requirements of smart agriculture. Flying Edge
    platforms, which can comprise one or multiple UAVs, offer the computing capabilities
    of IoT applications operating in remote locations. The proposed platform is highly
    dynamic and flexible, so it can be deployed and can collect data quickly. Most
    importantly, it can be used in tough terrains like the desert and hilly areas,
    removing the barriers to smart agriculture in such locations. The proposed edge
    platform builds an IoT network to collect crop data that will then be used to
    analyze crop health so, ultimately, the farmer can take timely smart actions.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 includes a short background
    of mobile edge computing. Section 3 provides the details of the proposed platform
    along with all the design and functionalities it can perform. Section 4 evaluates
    the proposed idea and compares the results of different parameters while, Section
    5 presents concluding remarks and thoughts for future study. 2 Related work Using
    mobile edge computing is not new. Various authors have proposed mobile systems
    that offer computing facilities. Prominent efforts include mobile fog computing
    [13] [14], mobile cloud computing [15], and mobile edge computing [16]. However,
    these platforms work differently from the proposed idea of flying edge computing.
    The system proposed in [13] offers mobile edge services from a fixed machine.
    It enables integrating mobile devices such as smartphones and vehicles to the
    cloud, but only from a certain geographical area. The important thing about that
    work is that it offers low-latency with the facility of mobility and location
    awareness. Further, [15] [17] proposes mobile cloud computing that offers an infrastructure
    where both data storage and data processing occur in the cloud to support mobile
    devices. In that approach, mobile cloud computing frees mobile devices from storing
    large data and conducting heavy processing. In [13], mobile edge computing extends
    cloud computing capabilities at the edge of the cellular network. Different services
    with low latency can be provided to smartphones and other applications that rely
    on cellular communications. Using UAVs in smart agriculture also is not new. These
    flying robots are used in many ways. Authors in [18] present a hierarchical structure
    based on the collaboration between the UAVs and associated wireless sensors for
    crop monitoring in precision agriculture. That integration of UAVs with ground
    sensors and IoT applications proved to be a robust and efficient solution for
    data collection, control, analysis, and decisions in such specialized applications.
    Key advantages lay in online data collection and relaying the data to a central
    monitoring point, while effectively managing network load and latency through
    optimized UAV trajectories and in situ data processing. Two important aspects
    of the collaboration were considered: designing the UAV trajectories for efficient
    data collection and implementing effective data processing algorithms (consensus
    and symbolic aggregate approximation) at the network level to transmit the relevant
    data. Considering the worth of Information and Communications Technology (ICT)
    for smart agriculture, researchers have begun to use edge computing to enhance
    crop production. In a similar effort in [19], the authors proposed a data link
    management solution based on mobile edge computing (MEC) to monitor water requirements
    for agriculture. The results showed that the scheme realizes the network and intelligence
    of agricultural water monitoring system management, and it has a broad market
    prospect. Edge computing plays an important role in smart agriculture, and it
    can be considered an ideal paradigm because of features like its ability to operate
    in remote locations, cover large areas, endure hostile conditions, provide sufficient
    bandwidth, and address connectivity issues. Collecting data at the right time
    and then performing the right steps for a given situation is possible only by
    using edge computing. So, it is crucial for agriculture. Edge computing can be
    the appropriate choice whenever there are connectivity issues. According to the
    proposal in [20], sensors and edge devices collect data from the monitoring area
    and send the data to an edge node. The node conducts a preprocess analysis of
    the data needed then sends the outcome to a server. The server collects and accumulates
    the results to predict and estimate the total harvest yield. By using this framework
    many decisions can be taken according to circumstances. Authors in [21] focus
    on an efficient solution for collecting data and exploiting tasks using edge computing
    for smart agriculture, global food security, and the pervasive issue of internet
    access. Further, [22] presents a platform that can manage the minerals for agriculture
    using saline water. It relies on transferable low-cost hardware which operates
    with edge computing to interact with crop sensors and devices to collect the data
    and perform atomic control actions in real-time monitoring scenarios. In all these
    studies, various features and services are provided to mobile devices to integrate
    with the cloud. However, they rely on fixed locations, such as stationary fog
    machines, fixed wireless stations, or fixed cellular towers. By contrast, Flying
    Edge offers these facilities from a mobile device instead of using only stationary
    devices. 3 Proposed flying edge computing The traditional model has been to use
    cloud computing to acquire and process data from the edge to offer useful services.
    Large cloud data centers provide different services (computing, platform, security,
    and storage) to edge devices through high bandwidth connectivity. Two key challenges
    emerge with this hub-and-spoke model. Public cloud data centers are globally distributed,
    but they are typically limited to one or a few per country (depending on its size).
    The network distance from the edge to the cloud can result in a long round trip
    time (RTT) in the order of thousands of milliseconds. For latency-sensitive cloud
    applications, this may compromise their performance. To overcome this, fog, mist,
    and edge computing have been introduced as extensions of cloud networks, which
    are collections of servers comprising a distributed network. Cloud, fog, and mist
    computing are also known as wet computing in the literature. The difference between
    them is the degree of distribution of services from the internet cloud to edge
    devices. We are introducing a new concept called Flying Edge computing (FEC).
    In contrast to previous forms of computing, we name it “dry” computing because
    data are blown along and dried by with the current of the computing wind. The
    speed and direction of the wind also matter. The faster the speed, the more the
    throughput. At slower speeds, a network is more tightly squeezed to collect the
    data. 3.1 Data evaporation UAV activates ground sensor nodes and provides them
    local computation, database, and communications infrastructure services. In contrast
    to typical fixed-edge computing machines installed near or inside the edge node,
    the UAV acts like a flying edge that moves between edge nodes to provide them
    the desired local and global services. Typical cloud, fog, and mist computing
    are called wet computing, but for Flying Edge we name it dry, wind, or breeze
    computing where data are evaporated from the sensor node to the air and collected
    by a UAV. UAV generates a computing wind in its vicinity, and data are evaporated
    (extracted from sensors) with the current of computing (movement of UAV). The
    speed of the UAV is taken as the current of computing wind, while several UAVs
    act like wind temperature. The more the UAVs, the faster the evaporation process
    (more throughput). Fast-moving UAVs produce shorter clusters with fewer sensor
    nodes, so slowing the computing wind ensures that the sensor nodes are squeezed
    well. We have taken agriculture in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) as a case
    study. Crops are mostly grown in circular farms to save water. Our contribution
    is to modernize the KSA agriculture with state-of-the-art technologies to monitor
    crop health so resources can be managed tightly, especially the maximal use of
    water. We map flying edge computing with the perspective of KSA agriculture. Hundreds
    of crop fields are dispersed in a very large and remote area where there is no
    fixed communications infrastructure. It is assumed that all fields are equipped
    with a large number of sensors that monitor crops, soil, and environmental parameters
    at the same time. However, predefined network topologies (cluster heads, communication
    routes) are not possible because of the high fluctuation of sensor nodes caused
    by harsh water. In this scenario, cloud computing does not fit well as IoT devices
    do not have cloud access. In this presentation, a flying edge machine (UAV) moves
    in a predefined path. As it blows the computing wind, the underlying sensors form
    a cluster in the direction of the wind, and they choose a Cluster Head (CH) dynamically.
    As a result, the data are evaporated from CH to UAV, as shown in Fig. 1. Fig.

    of flying edge computing with other technologies, including cloud, fog, mist,
    and edge computing, is shown in Table 1 and represented in Fig. 2. Table 1 Comparison
    of different computing techniques Full size table Fig. 2 Similarities and differences
    of computing techniques Full size image As mentioned above, the Flying Edge is
    a UAV-based platform that acts as an edge node. Most importantly, the acting edge
    node can be reallocated to different locations where various sensors or devices
    need some edge node to complete certain IoT tasks. Moreover, it can provide the
    facility of a gateway to link or integrate IoT services and cloud computing. The
    Flying Edge can be equipped with resources like processors, storage facilities,
    communication devices, and an edge computational platform. This edge platform
    can execute several services to support IoT applications required for smart agriculture.
    One possible configuration for flying edge computing is shown in Fig. 3. In that
    figure, a UAV with edge computing facilities can move in any area where IoT services
    are required. It provides a set of services like low latency to the IoT applications
    in that area while it enables the integration of the IoT applications and the
    cloud. Fig. 3 Flying Edge supporting the smart agriculture Full size image The
    Flying Edge can facilitate smart agriculture based on IoT applications. Major
    opportunities that it can provide are: Fast deployment: because of its nature,
    the Flying Edge can be deployed at remote locations to facilitate IoT services.
    It is a turnkey system that can be used even where there is no communications
    infrastructure. Scalability: the system can be upgraded or enhanced in terms of
    coverage area, number of sensing devices, number of UAVs operated, and services
    provided. Flexibility: the system is flexible enough to adapt to any change in
    applications, required services, or the geography of the monitoring area. Location
    awareness: location services are provided by the flying edge machine, so IoT nodes
    do not require a GPS device. Power effectiveness: this scheme is very power efficient
    for end nodes (IoT nodes), as most of the services that require computation are
    provided by flying edge robots (UAVs). Because the Flying Edge can be deployed
    in an area where IoT devices are already deployed, most of the communication between
    these IoT devices and UAV is done through a personal area network (PAN) such as
    IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee) and 801.15.1 (Bluetooth). Both protocols are characterized
    by lower bandwidths and shorter communication ranges. However, they also need
    low energy during the communication phase. Depending on the requirements, communication
    can be done through alternative protocols that support longer ranges like a local
    area network (LAN) such as IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi). On the other hand, all the communication
    between the Flying Edge and the cloud is done through protocols that are commonly
    used for wide area networks (WANs) including IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX) and cellular.
    The choice of communications medium and protocol depends on the nature of the
    application and its location. 3.3 Proposed system architecture The proposed system
    has two components: an edge device and the Flying Edge computing machine, as shown
    in Fig. 4. The edge device (sensor or actuator) can get services from a UAV through
    a services request interface. Most of the computational services required by the
    IoT are provided by the local service response module, which is connected to several
    services built into the flying machine. In rare cases, the IoTs might require
    global services from the cloud, and they will be granted through a global services
    response module. Fig. 4 Flying Edge computing architecture Full size image 3.4
    Proposed system models Mobile devices and Internet-of-things (IoT) have been introduced
    in our lives very rapidly. They have brought ease to our work, but they also raised
    new challenges that needed cloud-based solutions including i) the need to transfer
    huge amounts of data to the cloud, ii) high communication latencies, and iii)
    the inability of this model to respond in some domains that require a rapid reaction
    to events. Different computing techniques like cloud, fog, and mist/edge computing
    have been introduced to address these issues and provide three basic services
    to the IoT devices: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), “Platform as a Service
    (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). The basic difference between these techniques
    is the layer in the network hierarchy from which the service is provided. This
    means the distance between the services and the source of data, as shown in Fig.
    5. In cloud computing, all the services are provided from the cloud (a central
    location) while fog computing is a distributed computing technique in which services
    are provided in network fabrics. In edge or mist computing, processing and services
    are provided near the end node (the source of data). Fig. 5 Typical cloud-to-edge
    computing hierarchy Full size image A typical computing hierarchy is shown in
    Fig. 5. As far as WSN is involved, many factors (lack of a communication link,
    limited processing capabilities, insufficient power) may restrict the use of any
    kind of computing technique. In such conditions, a UAV can replace any of the
    computing layers. In this article, we introduce four basic types of UAV replacement:
    1- UAV as a flying cloud 2- UAV as a flying fog 3- UAV as a flying edge 4- A swarm
    of UAVs as a distributed services provider 3.4.1 UAV as a flying cloud This configuration
    is applicable in a scenario where all the ground sensing nodes can communicate
    with each other but do not have access to the outer world (no internet). This
    type of scenario is applicable in battlefields, disaster areas, wildlife habitats,
    and remote farm fields. As all sensors are connected with each other, they maintain
    their local network in terms of clusters and routes independently. Local decisions
    are made either at the edge or the fog layer. Global services (data collection,
    localization, security, or software) and decisions are provided by the UAV as
    a Flying Cloud Machine (FCM) on a demand basis (see Fig. 6). Fig. 6 UAV a Flying
    cloud machine Full size image 3.4.2 UAV as a flying fog In this configuration,
    field sensors are equipped with local services (network and storage) through edge
    nodes. The UAV provides only communication services as a flying fog machine (FFM)
    to approach the cloud layer where all global services exist. FFM provides a bridge
    between the edge layer and the cloud layer, as shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 7 Flying
    fog computing Full size image 3.4.3 UAV as a flying edge In this scheme, UAV provides
    computation and services to the IoT nodes by visiting them, and it provides services
    and computation close to the data source. It helps to improve latency and bandwidth,
    and it also enhances the network life by improving battery utilization of end
    nodes. All the sensors’ nodes are dump nodes. Their functionality is limited to
    sense and log parameters from the environment only. All the services (clustering,
    network, storage) and computation are provided to them by a UAV. If the UAV cannot
    fulfill a demanded service, it can render it from the cloud. A flying edge machine
    (FEM) is shown in Fig. 8. Fig. 8 Flying edge computing Full size image 3.4.4 UAV
    as a distributed flying edge machine A coordinated swarm of UAVs can provide edge
    services as shown in Fig. 9. Different services like network, storage, and localization
    are provided by separate UAVs. Hence each service will be provide by a specialized
    flying machine which will enhance the provided quality of service, throughput,
    and data collection. Swarm of UAVs can also work in a coordinated way such that
    they can share or take over the responsibilities if any one fails, distracted
    or power exhausted. This model will provide robust solutions in hardship conditions.
    Fig. 9 Distributed flying edge computing machine Full size image 4 Simulation
    and results A Flying Edge prototype was implemented using a distributed Java agent
    environment. This environment provides a middleware infrastructure that enables
    the implementation of different distributed programming models and advanced platform
    services for distributed heterogeneous environments. These heterogeneous environments
    may comprise multiple heterogeneous nodes with different capabilities. In addition,
    this middleware infrastructure provides scalability solutions to deploy, operate,
    monitor, and control large-scale distributed applications. Each agent in the environment
    can provide runtime support to securely execute some code. An edge machine provides
    broker services, invocation services, and location-based services. There is also
    a mechanism that allows each edge broker to forward a service search request to
    other brokers if it does not have the requested service. Both local and remote
    service invocations also are implemented and added to the prototype implementation.
    For the IoT side, we used the Arduino board, which is open-source hardware for
    embedded systems. For this prototype implementation, the Arduino was used as the
    IoT payload subsystem—the onboard device requesting services. Some sensors were
    connected to the Arduino board, such as the DHT11 sensor to measure temperature
    and humidity. Some LEDs and a buzz were installed to represent actuators. In addition,
    we installed an Adafruit CC3000 Wi-Fi board to connect the Arduino to a local
    area network and the Flying Edge machine. The Arduino code was developed using
    the Arduino IDE with the Adafruit CC3000 library. Each IoT service was implemented
    with a RESTful API. At the UAV edge computing side, there is a service that represents
    each sensor or actuator attached to the Arduino. The primary function of these
    services is to map a call from the SOAP APIs to RESTful APIs. All sensor and actuator
    services are registered with the local broker. In addition, the global broker
    is periodically updated with these services. For the experiments, we used three
    computers, which represented the cloud, the Flying Edge machine, and the IoT node.
    In addition, we used WAN emulators among these machines to introduce the effects
    of using long distances and/or the internet to connect the machines. Experiments
    were conducted for four configurations: Call1: a local IoT service call responded
    by the distributed flying edge machine Call2: a local IoT service call responded
    by the flying edge machine Call3: a remote IoT service call responded by the cloud
    through a flying fog machine Call4: a remote IoT service call responded by the
    flying cloud The experiment was repeated for two types of services. The first
    was to get the current temperature (CurTemp) and the second was to turn on the
    LED (LEDon). The average results of 10 runs of multiple service calls are shown
    in Fig. 10. The recorded times for these calls do not include the service lookup
    times. The response times for all service calls are shown in Fig. 10. It is evident
    that flying edge shows best results in term of response time by adding the benefits
    of battery efficiency of end nodes. It is also analyzed that the services provided
    by flying fog machine or through flying fog machine gives same results and are
    better than cloud. Fig. 10 IoT service call response time Full size image The
    average service lookup times for three services are shown in Fig. 11. Local services
    were provided by the local network. Remote 1 services were provided by the flying
    machine UAV to the end node. Remote 2 services were provided by the cloud through
    flying machines. There is a big difference between Remote 1 and Remote 2 service
    lookup times. This means that flying computing machines (UAVs) can provide services
    to IoT devices in a much faster way. Fig. 11 IoT service lookup Full size image
    5 Conclusion In this research article, we proposed a new concept of a computation
    mechanism for IoT devices. The processing and the services will be provided to
    the end devices neither from central location (cloud) nor by end device itself.
    Both cloud and edge computing have different pros and cons ranging from bottlenecks
    to poor resource utilization. The proposed system fulfills the service demand
    very close to the point of data generation without using additional network resources
    (energy, memory, or processor). Our aim is to provide these services to the IoTs
    by using the Flying Edge machine. This means the computational machine itself
    goes closer to the data-generation node and provides the demanded services. The
    architecture of the proposed Flying Edge machine is introduced, and the performance
    of the system is evaluated through simulation and lab test bed. The results showed
    the effectiveness of the proposed computational mechanism. As a result, we can
    say this system is very suitable for implementation in the case study presented
    (agriculture) but it is not limited to that use. References Friha O, Ferrag MA,

  title: Cloud-connected flying edge computing for smart agriculture
  verbatim_quote1: '"Flying edge computing aims to fulfill the requirements of smart
    agriculture by providing computing facilities close to the data source. Flying
    Edge platforms, which can comprise one or multiple UAVs, offer the computing capabilities
    of IoT applications operating in remote locations. The proposed platform is highly
    dynamic and flexible, so it can be deployed and can collect data quickly. Most
    importantly, it can be used in tough terrains like the desert and hilly areas,
    removing the barriers to smart agriculture in such locations."'
  verbatim_quote2: '"The proposed system has two components: an edge device and the
    Flying Edge computing machine, as shown in Fig. 4. The edge device (sensor or
    actuator) can get services from a UAV through a services request interface. Most
    of the computational services required by the IoT are provided by the local service
    response module, which is connected to several services built into the flying
    machine. In rare cases, the IoTs might require global services from the cloud,
    and they will be granted through a global services response module."'
  verbatim_quote3: '"The architecture of the proposed Flying Edge machine is introduced,
    and the performance of the system is evaluated through simulation and lab test
    bed. The results showed the effectiveness of the proposed computational mechanism.
    As a result, we can say this system is very suitable for implementation in the
    case study presented (agriculture) but it is not limited to that use."'

    system collects data from the farmer device, IoT sensors, and embedded devices
    and applies pattern prediction algorithm and deliver required information to the
    farmers and users. The size of agriculture data collected by Open Government Data
    (OGD) Platform India, and India Agriculture and Climate Dataset is in the order
    of gigabytes. The datasets are captured and gathered continuously, so the database
    size is increased by approximately 92 KB/min in the OGD data repository. The Global
    Positioning System (GPS) and IoT sensors agriculture dataset consists of crop
    images, weather images, soil and productivity data, which are stored in a cloud
    data repository for data analysis. To perform data analysis on large datasets,
    there is a need for high storage and a powerful computing system to provide efficient
    and effective data patterns to the users [1]. Big data analytics and cloud computing
    have been applied to store huge data and perform data analysis in the smart agricultural
    system [2, 3]. Edge computing is integrated with cloud computing and IoT to provide
    decisions with low latency time and increase the cloud network bandwidth [4].
    Figure 1 shows the smart agricultural model based on IoT and cloud computing technology.
    Smart farming is the integration of IoT and machine learning process to reduce
    excessive use of natural resources and reduce the damage of crops. The proposed
    system provides user-friendly Web-based application to the farmers for acquiring
    knowledge about the farms and the + environment. Big data are applied everywhere
    to increase the profit in the business and to analyze the historical data with
    the following four parameters: volume, velocity, variety, and veracity. Fig. 1
    Smart agricultural decision-making model Full size image The rest of the paper
    is organized as follows. Section 2 presents related work in a smart agricultural
    system using machine learning and edge computing. The architecture and functionalities
    of the different layers are discussed in Sect. 3. In Sect. 3, the workflow of
    the proposed system is summarized. Section 4 presents the machine learning algorithm
    used for data classification. Section 5 describes the experimental setup, execution
    method, and analyzes the performance of the proposed system. Section 6 concludes
    the result of the precision agricultural system and future scope. 2 Related Works
    Big data analytics and machine learning approach play a significant role in large
    dataset analysis and efficient decision-making process, which makes the smart
    agricultural system more profitable, safer, and efficient [5]. Many applications
    use big data analytics for achieving better profit and make better decisions with
    less time and cost [6]. Many research works have focused on the knowledge intelligent
    system for monitoring and controlling the agricultural land using IoT and fog
    computing with the cloud environment. Edge computing performs data analysis locally
    without transforming data to the cloud environment, which makes the precision
    agricultural system provide dynamic knowledge to the farmers and reduce the network
    latency. The computational load and storage process of the cloud environment are
    reduced by introducing the edge node in the IoT environment [7]. For example,
    the farmer can get the knowledge about the humidity of the soil, and he can decide
    the level of water irrigation to the crops so that the natural resource water
    can be utilized properly without wastage [8]. Intelligent services are provided
    to the farmers by applying data classification and prediction algorithms on the
    large datasets stored in the data repository in the edge node and the decentralized
    database server [9]. Precision agriculture system includes big data analytics,
    machine learning classification algorithm, edge computing, and IoT to increase
    the profit and reduce the wastage. The need for an edge computing nodes in cloud-based
    environments is analyzed in many research works [10]. The intelligent system does
    not move all dataset to the cloud server, which transfers partial data to the
    cloud server, which reduces the network latency and increases the network bandwidth
    [11]. An effective and efficient smart system is developed to overcome the challenges
    in the traditional agricultural land management systems. Many researchers and
    business applications use big data analytics to accomplish great success [12].
    A smart agricultural system is a modern application technology to provide, compute,
    and analyze multisource agricultural data for different management as shown in
    Fig. 2. It supports water irrigation management, crop management, soil analysis,
    and fertilizer analysis. The Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) is used to
    work with a large amount of data in distributed methods in the cloud network [13].
    Google proposed MapReduce programming model for parallel and distributed data
    analysis approach for large datasets in a cloud environment. The important classification
    algorithm called decision tree is implemented using the MapReduce processing model
    to perform data analysis in a distributed manner. Fig. 2 Functionalities of a
    smart agricultural system Full size image 3 Big Data Analytics in Smart Knowledge-Based
    Agricultural System A smart agricultural system includes electronic IoT sensors,
    edge computing transmission technology, big data analytics, and machine learning.
    The purpose of this proposed system is to provide required agricultural land data
    to the farmers and other users without any delay in a precision agricultural environment
    as shown in Fig. 3. A smart agricultural system consists of four layers, which
    are the agricultural environment data collection layer, edge computing layer,
    big data analytics layer, and application layer. All layers are interconnected
    by the information or data flow. The functionalities provided by each layer are
    given below. Fig. 3 Layered architecture of the smart agricultural system using
    big data Full size image 3.1 Agricultural Environment Data Collection Layer This
    layer is responsible for collecting data from sources like the sensors deployed
    in the agricultural land, Global Positioning System (GPS), and Roadside Unit (RSU)
    and transfers those data to the next level edge computing layer and cloud server.
    The data will be in the form of photos, text, images, videos, and pictures. 3.2
    Edge Computing Layer The cloud network connected with the edge computing node
    via edge gateway using the protocols like Zigbee, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, NFC, and Ethernet
    protocol. The edge computing node performs data analysis on the data collected
    from the data source and sends useful required information to the users. 3.3 Big
    Data Analytics Layer The association rule-based decision tree algorithm is executed
    to generate knowledge patterns for the farmers. The large volume of data is collected
    from the data source and stored in the database server for data analysis. The
    high performance and distributed rule mining algorithm is executed and performs
    data management. 3.4 Application Layer The farmer, agent, researcher, scientist,
    producer, and agent can access the smart agricultural application software using
    mobile devices connected with the Internet. The user can send a query to the knowledge
    base server and can receive information about the crop yield, fertilizer availability,
    pest control, soil details, and water irrigation status. 4 Machine Learning Approach
    for the Precision Agriculture In the big data ecosystem, machine learning technology
    provides powerful agricultural knowledge prediction algorithm to execute on large
    datasets. In Fig. 4, we have explained the steps involved in the big data analysis.
    In this paper, we propose the parallel and distributed association rule mining
    algorithm and tested with large datasets. The hybrid association rule-based decision
    tree algorithm is designed to analyze the distributed datasets available in the
    fog node and cloud computing node. In the supervised machine learning approach,
    decision trees are widely used prediction algorithm for large datasets. The most
    widely used supervised algorithm is tree-based algorithm, which gives greater
    accuracy, easy implementation, and consistency. Fig. 4 System framework for big
    data analytics Full size image 5 Performance Analysis The performance of the proposed
    has been evaluated by recording the farmer query response time for 6 days. The
    query processing time is calculated as the sum of user query request time and
    query response time. Figure 5 shows the various mobile user query response time
    sent on different days to the cloud environment. QID number represents query identification
    number, and it is calculated as the time taken by the cloud application service
    to compute the query and send a response to the farmer user. Fig. 5 User query
    response time Full size image The response can vary based on the type and nature
    of the query sent by the end user. In Fig. 6, the performance of the various approaches
    for generating the knowledge from the large datasets is explained. The proposed
    hybrid association rule-based decision tree-based MapReduce approach gives more
    accuracy and less error than the other data classification approach. The query
    response time can vary based on the user request type and nature of the query.
    Fig. 6 Performance comparisons of various approaches Full size image 6 Conclusion
    and Future Work Integration of cloud computing technologies and machine learning
    approaches swiftly moves traditional agricultural systems to smart agricultural
    systems. Big data analytics system has been applied in a smart agricultural system
    to provide knowledge patterns to the farmers to make real-time decisions about
    farm management. The proposed precision agricultural system is used in the field
    of science, which leads to maximum crop yield by reducing the usage of resources.
    The farm management process is optimized with the use of big data and machine
    learning methods by increasing the crop yield and reducing the resources like
    fertilizer, water, and pesticide. This system provides the required information
    to the farmers at the right time and right place. In future, the system can be
    extended for finding particular crop disease analysis. References S. Wolfert,

    developments in hardware, software, and communication technologies have facilitated
    the emergence of Internet-connected sensory devices that provide observations
    and data measurements from the physical world. By 2020, it is estimated that the
    total number of Internet-connected devices being used will be between 25 and 50
    billion. As these numbers grow and technologies become more mature, the volume
    of data being published will increase. The technology of Internet-connected devices,
    referred to as Internet of Things (IoT), continues to extend the current Internet
    by providing connectivity and interactions between the physical and cyber worlds.
    In addition to an increased volume, the IoT generates big data characterized by
    its velocity in terms of time and location dependency, with a variety of multiple
    modalities and varying data quality. Intelligent processing and analysis of this
    big data are the key to developing smart IoT applications. This article assesses
    the various machine learning methods that deal with the challenges presented by
    IoT data by considering smart cities as the main use case. The key contribution
    of this study is the presentation of a taxonomy of machine learning algorithms
    explaining how different techniques are applied to the data in order to extract
    higher level information. The potential and challenges of machine learning for
    IoT data analytics will also be discussed. A use case of applying a Support Vector
    Machine (SVM) to Aarhus smart city traffic data is presented for a more detailed
    exploration. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Machine
    learningInternet of ThingsSmart dataSmart City 1. Introduction Emerging technologies
    in recent years and major enhancements to Internet protocols and computing systems,
    have made communication between different devices easier than ever before. According
    to various forecasts, around 25–50 billion devices are expected to be connected
    to the Internet by 2020. This has given rise to the newly developed concept of
    Internet of Things (IoT). IoT is a combination of embedded technologies including
    wired and wireless communications, sensor and actuator devices, and the physical
    objects connected to the Internet [1], [2]. One of the long-standing objectives
    of computing is to simplify and enrich human activities and experiences (e.g.,
    see the visions associated with “The Computer for the 21st Century” [3] or “Computing
    for Human Experience” [4]). IoT requires data to either represent better services
    to users or enhance the IoT framework performance to accomplish this intelligently.
    In this manner, systems should be able to access raw data from different resources
    over the network and analyze this information in order to extract knowledge. Since
    IoT will be among the most significant sources of new data, data science will
    provide a considerable contribution to making IoT applications more intelligent.
    Data science is the combination of different scientific fields that uses data
    mining, machine learning, and other techniques to find patterns and new insights
    from data. These techniques include a broad range of algorithms applicable in
    different domains. The process of applying data analytics methods to particular
    areas involves defining data types such as volume, variety, and velocity; data
    models such as neural networks, classification, and clustering methods, and applying
    efficient algorithms that match with the data characteristics. By following our
    reviews, the following is deduced: First, because data is generated from different
    sources with specific data types, it is important to adopt or develop algorithms
    that can handle the data characteristics. Second, the great number of resources
    that generate data in real-time are not without the problem of scale and velocity.
    Finally, finding the best data model that fits the data is one of the most important
    issues for pattern recognition and for better analysis of IoT data. These issues
    have opened a vast number of opportunities in expanding new developments. Big
    data is defined as high-volume, high-velocity, and high variety data that demands
    cost-effective, innovative forms of information processing that enable enhanced
    insight, decision making, and process automation [5]. With respect to the challenges
    posed by big data, it is necessary to introduce a new concept termed smart data,
    which means: ”realizing productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness gains by using
    semantics to transform raw data into Smart Data” [6]. A more recent definition
    of this concept is: ”Smart Data provides value from harnessing the challenges
    posed by volume, velocity, variety, and veracity of Big Data, and in turn providing
    actionable information and improving decision making.” [7]. Finally, smart data
    can act as a good representative for IoT data. 1.1. The Contributions of this
    paper The objective here is to answer the following questions: A) How can machine
    learning algorithms be applied to IoT smart data? B) What is the taxonomy of machine
    learning algorithms that can be adopted in IoT? C) What are the characteristics
    of IoT data in the real world? D) Why is the smart city a typical use case of
    IoT applications? A) To understand which algorithm is more appropriate for processing
    and decision-making on smart data generated from the things in IoT, it is essential
    to consider the following three concepts. First, the IoT application (Section
    3). Second, the IoT data characteristics (Section 4.2), and third, the data-driven
    vision of machine learning algorithms (Section 5). We finally discuss the issues
    in Section 6. B) Around 70 articles in the field of IoT data analysis are reviewed,
    revealing that there exist eight major groups of algorithms applicable to IoT
    data. These algorithms are categorized according to their structural similarities,
    types of data they can handle, and the amount of data they can process in a reasonable
    time. C) Having reviewed the real-world perspective of how IoT data is analyzed
    by over 20 authors, many significant and insightful results have been revealed
    regarding data characteristics. We discuss the results in Section 6 and Table
    1. To gain a deeper insight into IoT smart data, patterns must be extracted and
    the generated data interpreted. Cognitive algorithms undertake interpretation
    and matching, much as the human mind would do. Cognitive IoT systems previously
    learn from generated data and improve when performing repeated tasks. Cognitive
    computing acts as a prosthetic for human cognition by analyzing massive amount
    of data and responding to questions that humans might have when making certain
    decisions. Cognitive IoT plays an important role in enabling the extraction of
    meaningful patterns from generated IoT smart data [8]. Table 1. Characteristic

    case in IoT for three reasons: First, among all of the reviewed articles the focus
    of 60 percent is on the field of the smart cities. Second, smart cities include
    many of the other use cases in IoT. Third, there are many open datasets for smart
    city applications that are easily accessible for researchers. Furthermore, a Support
    Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is implemented on the Aarhus City smart traffic
    data to predict traffic hours during one day. By answering the above questions
    about IoT smart data and machine learning algorithms, we would be able to choose
    the best machine learning algorithm that can handle IoT smart data characteristics.
    Unlike similar surveys regarding machine learning and IoT, readers of this article
    would be able to obtain a deep and technical understanding of machine learning
    algorithms, IoT applications, and IoT data characteristics along with both technical
    and simple implementations. 1.2. Organization The rest of this paper is organized
    as follows. Related articles in this field are reviewed and reported in Section

    and smart city segments are reviewed, explained, summarized, and illustrated in
    Section 3. The quality of data, big data generation, sensor data integration,
    and semantic data annotation are reviewed in Section 4. Machine learning algorithms
    in eight categories based on recent studies on IoT data and frequency of machine

    and smart data, it is a challenging area in the field of computer science. The
    important challenges for researchers with respect to IoT consist of preparing
    and processing data. Ref. [9] proposed four data mining models for processing
    IoT data. The first is a multi layer model, based on a data collection layer,
    a data management layer, an event processing model, and a data mining service
    layer. The second model is a distributed data mining model, proposed for data
    deposition at different sites. The third is a grid-based data mining model where
    the authors seek to implement heterogeneous, large scale, and high performance
    applications. The final model is a data mining model from a multi technology integration
    perspective, where a corresponding framework for the future Internet is described.
    Ref. [10] performed research into warehousing Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
    data, with a focus specifically on managing and mining RFID stream data. Ref.
    [11] introduced a systematic method for reviewing data mining knowledge and techniques
    in most common applications. In this study, they reviewed some data mining functions
    like classification, clustering, association analysis, time series analysis, and
    outline detection. They revealed that the data generated by data mining applications,
    such as e-commerce, industry, healthcare, and city governance are similar to that
    of the IoT data. Following their findings, they assigned the most popular data
    mining functionality to the application and determined which data mining functionality
    was the most appropriate for processing each specific application''s data. Ref.
    [12] ran a survey to respond to some of the challenges in preparing and processing
    data on the IoT through data mining techniques. The authors divided their research
    into three major sections. In the first and second sections, they explain IoT,
    the data, and the challenges that exist in this area, such as building a model
    for mining, and mining algorithms for IoT. In the third section, they discuss
    the potential and open issues that exist in this field. Here, it is summarized
    that data mining on IoT data involves three major concerns: First, it must be
    shown that processing the data will solve the chosen problems. Next, the data
    characteristics must be extracted from the generated data, and then, the appropriate
    algorithm is chosen according to the taxonomy of algorithms and data characteristics.
    Ref. [13] attempted to explain the smart city infrastructure in IoT and discussed
    advanced communication to support added-value services for the administration
    of the city and citizens thereof. The authors provide a comprehensive review of
    enabling technologies, protocols, and architectures for smart city. In the technical
    part of the article, the authors reviewed the data of Padova Smart City. 3. Internet
    of Things The purpose of Internet of Things (IoT) is to develop a smarter environment
    and a simplified life-style by saving time, energy, and money. Through this technology,
    expenses in different industries can be reduced. The enormous investments and
    many studies running on IoT have made IoT a growing trend in recent years. IoT
    consists of a set of connected devices that can transfer data among one another
    in order to optimize their performance; these actions occur automatically and
    without human awareness or input. IoT includes four main components: 1) sensors,
    2)processing networks, 3) data analysis data, and 4) system monitoring. The most
    recent advances made in IoT began when RFID tags were put into use more frequently,
    lower cost sensors became more available, web technology developed, and communication
    protocols changed [14], [15]. The IoT is integrated with various technologies,
    and connectivity is a necessary and sufficient condition for it to function. Therefore,
    communication protocols are constituents of this technology that should be enhanced
    [16], [17]. In IoT, communication protocols can be divided into three major components:
    (1) Device to Device (D2D): this type of communication enables communication between
    nearby mobile phones. This represents the next generation of cellular networks.
    (2) Device to Server (D2S): in this type of communication device, all the data
    is sent to the servers, which can be close or far from the devices. This type
    of communication is mostly applied to cloud processing. (3) Server to Server (S2S):
    in this type of communication, servers transmit data between each other. This
    type of communication is mostly applied for cellular networks. Processing and
    preparing data for these communications is a critical challenge. To respond to
    this challenge, different kinds of data processing, such as analytics at the edge,
    stream analysis, and IoT analysis at the database, must be applied. The decision
    to apply any of the mentioned processes depends on the particular application
    and its needs [18]. Fog and cloud processing are two analytical methods adopted
    for processing and preparing data before transferring it to other things. The
    whole task of IoT is summarized as follows: First, sensors and IoT devices collect
    information from the environment. Next, knowledge is extracted from the raw data.
    Then, data is ready for transferring to other objects, devices, or servers through
    the Internet. 3.1. Computing framework Another important part of IoT is the computing
    framework of processing data, the most famous of which are fog and cloud computing.
    IoT applications use both frameworks depending on the application and process
    location. In some applications, data should be processed upon generation, while
    in other applications it is not necessary to process data immediately. The instant
    processing of data and the network architecture that supports it is known as fog
    computing. Collectively, these are applied for edge computing [19]. 3.1.1. Fog
    computing Here, the architecture of fog computing is applied to migrating information
    from a data center task to the edge of the servers. This architecture is built
    based on the edge servers. Fog computing provides limited computing, storage,
    and network services, also providing logical intelligence and filtering of data
    for data centers. This architecture has been and is being implemented in vital
    areas like eHealth and military applications [20], [21]. 3.1.2. Edge computing
    In this architecture, processing is run at a distance from the core, toward the
    edge of the network. This type of processing enables data to be initially processed
    at edge devices. Devices at the edge may not be connected to the network in a
    continuous manner, and so they require a copy of the master data/reference data
    for offline processing. Edge devices have different features such as 1) enhancing
    security, 2) filtering and cleaning data, and 3) storing local data for local
    use [22]. 3.1.3. Cloud computing Here, data for processing is sent to data centers,
    and after being analyzed and processed, they become accessible. This architecture
    has high latency and high load balancing, indicating that this architecture is
    not sufficient for processing IoT data because most processing should run at high
    speeds. The volume of this data is high, and big data processing will increase
    the CPU usage of the cloud servers [23]. There are various types of cloud computing:
    (1) Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): where the company purchases all the equipment
    like hardware, servers, and networks. (2) Platform as a Service (PaaS): where
    all the equipment above is placed for rent on the Internet. (3) Software as a
    Service(SaaS): where a distributed software model is presented. In this model,
    all practical software will be hosted by a service provider and is accessible
    to the users through the Internet [24]. (4) Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS):
    also known as Backend as a Service (BaaS), provides a web or mobile application
    with a path in order to connect the application to the backend cloud storage.
    MBaaS provides features like user management, push notifications, and integration
    with social network services. This cloud service benefits from an Application
    Programming Interface (API) and software Development Kits (SDK). 3.1.4. Distributed
    computing This architecture is designed for processing high volumes of data. In
    IoT applications, because the sensors generate data in a repetitive manner, big
    data challenges are encountered [22], [25]. To overcome this phenomenon, distributed
    computing is designed to divide data into packets, and assign the packets to different
    computers for processing. This distributed computing has different frameworks
    like Hadoop and Spark. When migrating from cloud to fog and distributed computing,
    the following phenomena occur: 1) a decrease in network loading, 2) an increase
    in data processing speed, 3) a reduction in CPU usage, 4) a reduction in energy
    consumption, and 5) an ability to process a higher volume of data. Because the
    smart city is one of the primary applications of IoT, the most important use cases
    of the smart city and their data characteristics are discussed in the following
    sections. 4. Smart city Cities always demand services to enhance the quality of
    life and make existing services more efficient. In the last few years, the concept
    of smart cities has played an important role in academia and industry [26]. With
    an increase in the population and complexity of city infrastructures, cities seek
    methods to handle large-scale urbanization problems. IoT plays a vital role in
    collecting data from the city environment. IoT enables cities to use live status
    reports and smart monitoring systems to react more intelligently to emerging situations
    such as earthquakes and volcanoes. By adopting IoT technologies in city, the majority
    of the city''s assets can be connected to one another, making them more readily
    observable, and consequently, more easy to monitor and manage. The purpose of
    building smart cities is to improve services like traffic management, water management,
    and energy consumption, as well as improving the quality of life for the citizens.
    The objective of smart cities is to transform rural and urban areas into places
    of democratic innovation [27]. Such smart cities seek to decrease the expenses
    in public health, safety, transportation, and resource management, thus assisting
    their economies [28]. In Ref. [29], the authors believe that in the long term,
    the vision for a smart city would be that all the cities'' systems and structures
    will monitor their own conditions and carry out self-repair upon need. 4.1. Use
    case A city has an important effect on society because the city touches all aspects
    of human life. A smart city can assist in having a comfortable life. The use cases
    for smart cities consist of smart energy, smart mobility, smart citizens, and
    urban planning. This division is based on a review of the latest studies in this
    field and the most recent reports released by McKinsey and Company. 4.1.1. Smart
    energy Smart energy is one of the most important research areas of IoT because
    it is essential to reduce overall power consumption [30]. It offers high-quality
    and affordable environmentally friendly energy. Smart energy includes a variety
    of operational and energy measures, including Smart energy applications, smart
    leak monitoring, and renewable energy resources, etc. Using smart energy (i.e.,
    deployment of a smart grid) implies a fundamental re-engineering of the electricity
    services [31]. The smart grid is one of the most important applications of smart
    energy. It includes many high-speed time series data to monitor key devices. For
    managing this kind of data, [32] introduced a method to manage and analyze time
    series data in order to make them organized on demand. Moreover, the smart energy
    infrastructure will become more complex in the future, and therefore [33] proposed
    a simulation system to test new concepts and optimization approaches and forecast
    future consumption. Another important application of smart energy is leak monitoring
    systems. The objective of such a system is to model a water or gas management
    system that would optimize energy resource consumption [34], [35]. 4.1.2. Smart
    mobility Mobility is another important aspect of any city. Through IoT, city officials
    can improve the quality of life in the city. Smart mobility can be divided into
    the following three major components: (1) Autonomous cars: IoT will have a broad
    range of effects on how vehicles are run. The most important question is about
    how IoT can improve vehicle services. IoT sensors and wireless connections make
    it possible to create self-driving cars and monitor vehicle performance. With
    the data collected from vehicles, the most popular/congested routes can be predicted,
    and decisions can be made to decrease traffic congestion. Self-driving cars can
    improve passenger safety because they have the ability to monitor the driving
    of the other cars. (2) Traffic control: Optimizing the traffic flow by analyzing
    sensor data is another part of mobility in the city. For traffic control, traffic
    data will be collected from cars, road cameras, and counter sensors installed
    on roads. (3) Public transportation: IoT can improve the public transportation
    system management by providing accurate location and routing information to a
    smart transportation system. It can assist passengers in making better decisions
    in their schedules as well as decrease the amount of wasted time. There exist
    different perspectives on how to build smart public transportation systems. These
    systems need to manage different kinds of data like vehicle location data and
    traffic data. Smart public transportation systems should be real-time oriented
    in order to make proper decisions in real-time as well as use historical data
    analysis [36]. For instance, [37] proposed a mechanism that considers smart city
    devices as graph nodes, and the authors used big data solutions to solve these
    issues. 4.1.3. Smart citizens This use case for smart cities covers a broad range
    of areas in human lives, such as environmental monitoring, crime monitoring, and
    social health. The environment with all its components is fundamental and vital
    for life. Consequently, making progress in technology is guaranteed to enhance
    security. Close monitoring devoted to crime would also contribute to overall social
    health. 4.1.4. Urban planning Another important aspect in use cases for the smart
    city is reaching long-term decisions. Because the city and environment both play
    major roles in human life, reaching decisions in this context is critical. By
    collecting data from different sources, it is possible to make a decision for
    the future of the city. Making decisions affecting the city infrastructure, design,
    and functionality is called urban planning. IoT is beneficial in this area because
    through smart city data analysis, the authorities can predict which part of the
    city will be more crowded in the future and find solutions for the potential problems.
    A combination of IoT and urban planning would have a major effect on scheduling
    future infrastructure improvements. 4.2. Smart city data characteristics Smart
    city devices generate data in a continuous manner, indicating that the data gathered
    from traffic, health, and energy management applications would generate a sizable
    volume. In addition, because the data generation rate varies for different devices,
    processing data with different generation rates is a challenge. For example, the
    frequency of GPS sensor updates is measured in seconds, while the frequency of
    updates for temperature sensors may be measured hourly. Whether the data generation
    rate is high or low, there always exists a danger of losing important information.
    To integrate the sensory data collected from heterogeneous sources is challenging
    [14], [38]. Ref. [39] applied big data analytic methods to distinguish the correlation
    between the temperature and traffic data in Santander, Spain. Ref. [40] proposed
    a new framework integrating big data analysis and Industrial Internet of Things
    (IIoT) technologies for Offshore Support Vessels (OSV) based on a hybrid CPU/GPU
    high-performance computing platform. Another characteristic is the dynamic nature
    of the data. Data for autonomous cars is an example of dynamic data because the
    sensor results will change based on different locations and times. The quality
    of the collected data is important, particularly for smart city data, which have
    different qualities due to the fact that they are generated from heterogeneous
    sources. According to Ref. [41], the quality of information from each data source
    depends on three factors: 1) Error in measurements or precision of data collection.
    2) Devices'' noise in the environment. 3) Discrete observation and measurements.
    To achieve a better Quality of Information (QoI), it is necessary to extract higher
    levels of abstraction and provide actionable information to other services. QoI
    in smart data depends on the applications and characteristics of data. There exist
    different solutions to improve QoI. For example, to improve the accuracy of data,
    selecting trustworthy sources and combining the data from multiple resources is
    of key importance. By increasing the frequency and density of sampling, the precision
    of the observations and measurements will be improved, which would lead to a reduction
    in environmental noise. The data characteristics in both IoT and the smart city
    are illustrated in Fig. 2. Semantic data annotation is another prime solution
    to enhancing data quality. Smart devices generate raw data with low-level abstractions.
    For this reason, the semantic models provide interpretable descriptions of data,
    its quality, and its original attributes [28]. Semantic annotation is beneficial
    in interpretable and knowledge-based information fusion [42]. Smart data characteristics

    5. Taxonomy of machine learning algorithms Machine learning is a subfield of computer
    science, and is a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that provides machines
    with the ability to learn without explicit programming. Machine learning evolved
    from pattern recognition and computational learning theory. Here, some essential
    concepts of machine learning are discussed as well as the frequently applied machine
    learning algorithms for smart data analysis. A learning algorithm takes a set
    of samples as an input named a training set. In general, there exist three main
    categories of learning: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement [54], [55],
    [56]. In an informal sense, in supervised learning, the training set consists
    of samples of input vectors together with their corresponding appropriate target
    vectors, also known as labels. In unsupervised learning, no labels are required
    for the training set. Reinforcement learning deals with the problem of learning
    the appropriate action or sequence of actions to be taken for a given situation
    in order to maximize payoff. This article focuses on supervised and unsupervised
    learning since they have been and are still widely applied in IoT smart data analysis.
    The objective of supervised learning is to learn how to predict the appropriate
    output vector for a given input vector. Applications where the target labels consist
    of a finite number of discrete categories are known as classification tasks. Cases
    where the target labels are composed of one or more continuous variables are known
    as regression tasks [57]. Defining the objective of unsupervised learning is difficult.
    One of the major objectives is to identify sensible clusters of similar samples
    within the input data, known as clustering. Moreover, the objective may be the
    discovery of a useful internal representation of the input data by preprocessing
    the original input variable in order to transfer it into a new variable space.
    This preprocessing stage can significantly improve the result of the subsequent
    machine learning algorithm and is named feature extraction [55]. The frequently
    applied machine learning algorithms for smart data analysis and IoT use cases
    are shown in Table 2 and Table 3 accordingly. Table 2. Overview of frequently

    in the data [52], [53] In the following subsections, we assume that we are given
    a training set containing N training samples denoted as , where is the ith M-dimensional
    training input vector and is the corresponding desired P-dimensional output vector.
    Moreover, we collect the M-dimensional input vectors in a matrix, written as ,
    and we also collect their corresponding desired output vectors in a matrix written
    as . However, in Section 5.4 the training set does not contain the desired output
    vectors. 5.1. Classification 5.1.1. K-nearest neighbors In K-Nearest Neighbors
    (KNN), the objective is to classify a new given unseen data point by looking at
    the K given data points in the training set that are closest to it in the input
    or feature space. Therefore, to find the K nearest neighbors of the new data point,
    we need to use a distance metric, such as Euclidean distance, norm, angle, Mahalanobis
    distance or Hamming distance. To formulate the problem, let us denote the new
    input vector (data point) by x, its K nearest neighbors by , the predicted class
    label for x by y, and the class variable by a discrete random variable t. Additionally,
    denotes the indicator function: if s is true and otherwise. The form of the classification
    task is (1) i.e., the input vector x will be labeled by the mode of its neighbors''
    labels [58]. One limitation of KNN is that it requires storing the entire training
    set, which makes KNN unscalable to large data sets. In [59], the authors have
    addressed this issue by constructing a tree-based search with a one-off computation.
    Moreover, there exists an online version of KNN classification. It is worth noting
    that KNN can also be used for regression tasks [55]. However, we will not explain
    this here, because it is not a frequently employed algorithm for smart data analysis.
    Ref. [96] proposes a new framework for learning a combination of multiple metrics
    for a robust KNN classifier. Furthermore, [47] compares KNN with a rough-set-based
    algorithm for classifying the travel pattern regularities. 5.1.2. Naive Bayes
    Given a new, unseen data point (input vector) , naive Bayes classifiers, which
    are a family of probabilistic classifiers, classify z based on applying Bayes''
    theorem with the “naive” assumption of independence between the features (attributes)
    of z given the class variable t. By applying Bayes'' theorem, we have (2) and
    by applying the naive independence assumption and some simplifications, we have
    (3) Therefore, the form of the classification task is (4) where y denotes the
    predicted class label for z. Different naive Bayes classifiers use different approaches
    and distributions to estimate and [61]. Naive Bayes classifiers require a small
    number of data points to be trained, and can deal with high-dimensional data points,
    and also are fast and highly scalable [60]. Moreover, they are a popular model
    for applications, such as spam filtering [97], text categorization, and automatic
    medical diagnosis [98]. Ref. [49] used this algorithm to combine factors to evaluate
    the trust value and calculate the final quantitative trust of agricultural product.
    5.1.3. Support vector machine Classical Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are non-probabilistic,
    binary classifiers that aim to find the dividing hyperplane that separates both
    classes of the training set with the maximum margin. Then, the predicted label
    of a new, unseen data point is determined based on which side of the hyperplane
    it falls [62]. First, we discuss the linear SVM that finds a hyperplane that is
    a linear function of the input variable. To formulate the problem, we denote the
    normal vector to the hyperplane by w and the parameter for controlling the offset
    of the hyperplane from the origin along its normal vector by b. Moreover, to ensure
    that SVMs can deal with outliers in the data, we introduce a variable , called
    a slack variable, for every training point , which gives the distance by which
    this training point violates the margin in units of . This binary linear classification
    task is described using a constrained optimization problem of the form (5) where
    parameter determines how heavily a violation is punished [64], [63]. It should
    be noted that although we used the norm here for the penalty term , there exist
    other penalty terms, such as the norm, which should be chosen with respect to
    the needs of the application. Moreover, the parameter C is a hyperparameter which
    can be chosen via cross-validation or Bayesian optimization. There exist various
    techniques to solve the constrained optimization problem of equation (5), such
    as quadratic programming optimization [99], sequential minimal optimization [100],
    and P-packSVM [101]. One important property of SVMs is that the resulting classifier
    only uses a few training points, which are called support vectors, to classify
    a new data point. In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can perform
    a non-linear classification, which finds a hyperplane that is a non-linear function
    of the input variable. To do so, we implicitly map an input variable into high-dimensional
    feature spaces in a process called a kernel trick [64]. In addition to performing
    binary classification, SVMs can perform multiclass classification. There are various
    methods to achieve this, such as One-vs-all (OVA) SVM, All-vs-all (AVA) SVM [54],
    Structured SVM [102], and the Weston and Watkins [103] version. SVMs are among
    the best off-the-shelf supervised learning models that are capable of effectively
    dealing with high-dimensional data sets and are efficient in terms of memory usage,
    owing to the employment of support vectors for prediction. One significant drawback
    of this model is that it does not directly provide probability estimates. When
    given a solved SVM model, its parameters are difficult to interpret [104]. SVMs
    are useful in many real-world applications such as hand-written character recognition
    [105], image classification [106], and protein classification [107]. Finally,
    we should note that SVMs can be trained in an online fashion, which is addressed
    in [108]. Ref. [109] proposed a method on the Intel Lab Dataset. This data set
    consists of four environmental variables (temperature, voltage, humidity and light)
    collected through S4 Mica2Dot sensors over 36 days at a per-second rate. 5.2.
    Regression 5.2.1. Linear regression In linear regression, the objective is to
    learn a function . This is a mapping and is a linear combination of a fixed set
    of linear or nonlinear functions of the input variable, denoted as and called
    basic functions. The form of is (6) where w is the weight vector or matrix , and
    . There exists a broad range of basic functions, such as polynomial, gaussian,
    radial, and sigmoidal basic functions, which should be chosen with respect to
    the application [68], [66]. For training the model, there exists a range of approaches:
    Ordinary Least Square, Regularized Least Squares, Least-Mean-Squares (LMS) and
    Bayesian Linear Regression. Among these, LMS is of interest since it is fast,
    scalable to large data sets, and it learns the parameters online by applying the
    technique of stochastic gradient descent, also known as sequential gradient descent
    [67], [55]. By using suitable basic functions it can be shown that arbitrary nonlinearities
    in the mapping from the input variable to the output variable can be modeled.
    However, the assumption of fixed basis functions leads to significant shortcomings
    with this approach. For example, an increase in the dimension of the input space
    is coupled with rapid growth in the number of basis functions [55], [66], [56].
    Linear regression can process at a high rate [48], and this algorithm can be used
    to analyze and predict the energy usage of buildings. 5.2.2. Support vector regression
    The SVM model described in Section 5.1.3 can be extended to solve regression problems
    through a process called Support Vector Regression (SVR). Analogous to support
    vectors in SVMs, the resulting SVR model depends only on a subset of the training
    points, owing to the rejection of training points that are close to the model
    prediction [69]. Various implementations of SVR exist such as epsilon-support
    vector regression and nu-support vector regression [70]. The authors of [46] proposed
    a hybrid method to obtain accurate temperature and humidity data predictions.
    5.3. Combining models 5.3.1. Classification and regression trees In Classification
    and Regression Trees (CART), the input space is partitioned into axis-aligned
    cuboid regions , and then a separate classification or regression model is assigned
    to each region to predict the label for data points fall into that region [71].
    Given a new, unseen input vector (data point) x, the process for predicting the
    corresponding target label can be explained by the traversal of a binary tree
    corresponding to a sequential decision-making process. An example of a model for
    classification is one that predicts a particular class for each region, and the
    example of regression is a model that predicts a constant for each region. To
    formulate the classification task, we denote a class variable by a discrete random
    variable t and the predicted class label for x by y. The classification task takes
    the form (7) where is the indicator function described in Section 5.1.1. This
    equation states that x will be labeled by the most common (mode) label in its
    corresponding region [73]. To formulate the regression task, we denote the value
    of the output vector by t and the predicted output vector for x by y. The regression
    task is expressed as (8) i.e., the output vector for x will be the mean of the
    output vectors of data points in its corresponding region [73]. Download : Download
    high-res image (284KB) Download : Download full-size image To train CART, the
    structure of the tree should be determined based on the training set. This means
    determining the split criterion at each node, along with the threshold parameter
    value. Finding the optimal tree structure is an NP-complete problem, and therefore
    a greedy heuristic, which constructs the tree top-down and chooses the best split
    node-by-node, is used to train CART. To achieve a better generalization and reduce
    overfilling, some stopping criteria should be used for constructing the tree.
    Possible stopping criterion are the maximum depth reached, whether the distribution
    in the branch is pure, whether the benefit of splitting is below a certain threshold,
    and whether the number of samples in each branch is below the criteria threshold.
    Moreover, after constructing the tree a pruning procedure can be used to reduce
    overfitting [72], [55], [56]. Algorithm 1 describes how to train CART. The major
    strength of CART is its human interpretability, owing to its tree structure. Additionally,
    it is fast and scalable to large data sets. However, it is very sensitive to the
    choice of the training set [110]. Another shortcoming of this model concerns unsmooth
    labeling of the input space since each region of the input space is associated
    with exactly one label [73], [55]. Ref. [47] proposes an efficient and effective
    data-mining procedure that models the travel patterns of transit riders in Beijing,
    China. 5.3.2. Random forests In random forests, instead of training a single tree,
    an army of trees are trained. Each tree is trained on a subset of the training
    set, chosen randomly along with a replacement, using a randomly chosen subset
    of M input variables (features) [74]. From here, there are two scenarios for predicting
    the label of a new, unseen data point: (1) in classification tasks, this is set
    as the mode of the labels predicted by each tree; (2) in regression tasks it is
    set as the mean of the labels predicted by each tree. There is a tradeoff between
    different values of M. A value of M that is too small leads to random trees with
    poor prediction power, whereas a value of M that is too large leads to very similar
    random trees. Random forests have a very high accuracy, but this comes at the
    cost of losing human interpretability [111]. Additionally, they are fast and scalable
    to large data sets, and have many real-world applications, such as body pose recognition
    [112] and body part classification. 5.3.3. Bagging Bootstrap aggregating, also
    called bagging, is an ensemble technique that aims to improve the accuracy and
    stability of machine learning algorithms and reduce overfitting. In this technique,
    K new M sized training sets are generated by randomly choosing data points from
    the original training set with replacements. Then, on each new generated training
    set, a machine learning model is trained. The predicted label of a new, unseen
    data point is set as the mode of the labels predicted by each model in the case
    of classification tasks, and is set as the mean in the case of regression tasks.
    There are various machine learning models, such as CART and neural networks, for
    which the bagging technique can improve the results. However, bagging degrades
    the performance of stable models such as KNN [75]. Examples of practical applications
    include customer attrition prediction [113] and preimage learning [114], [115].
    5.4. Clustering 5.4.1. K-means In the K-means algorithm, the objective is to cluster
    the unlabeled data set into K clusters (groups), where data points belonging to
    the same cluster must have some similarities. In the classical K-means algorithm,
    the distance between data points is the measure of similarity. Therefore, K-means
    seeks to find a set of K cluster centers, denoted as , such that the distances
    between data points and their nearest center are minimized [77]. To denote the
    assignment of data points to the cluster centers, we use a set of binary indicator
    variables , so that if the data point is assigned to the cluster center , then
    . We formulate the problem as follows: (9) Algorithm 2 describes how to learn
    the optimal cluster centers and the assignment of the data points }. Download
    : Download high-res image (209KB) Download : Download full-size image In practice,
    K-means is a very fast and highly scalable algorithm. Moreover, there is an online
    stochastic version of K-means [78]. However, this approach has many limitations
    because of the use of Euclidean distance as the measure of similarity. For instance,
    it has limitations regarding the types of data variables that can be considered,
    and cluster centers are not robust against outliers. Additionally, the K-means
    algorithm assigns each data point only one of the clusters, which may lead to
    inappropriate clusters in some cases [76]. Ref. [116] used MapReduce to analyze
    the numerous small data sets and proposes a cluster strategy for a high volume
    of small data based on the K-means algorithm. Ref. [47] applied K-Means++ to cluster
    and classify travel pattern regularities. Ref. [117] introduced a real-time event
    processing and clustering algorithm for analyzing sensor data, by using the OpenIoT1
    middleware as an interface for innovative analytical IoT services. 5.4.2. Density-based
    spatial clustering of applications with noise In a Density-Based approach to Spatial
    Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), the objective is to cluster a
    given unlabeled data set based on the density of its data points. In this model,
    groups of dense data points (data points with many close neighbors) are considered
    as clusters and data points in regions with low-density are considered as outliers
    [80]. Ref. [79] present an algorithm to train a DBSCAN model. In practice, DBSCAN
    is efficient on large datasets, and is fast and robust against outliers. Furthermore,
    it is capable of detecting clusters of arbitrary shape (i.e., spherical, elongated,
    and linear). Moreover, the model determines the number of clusters based on the
    density of the data points, unlike K-means, which requires the number of clusters
    to be specified [79]. However, there are some disadvantages associated with DBSCAN.
    For example, in the case of a data set with large differences in densities, the
    resulting clusters are destitute. Additionally, the performance of the model is
    highly sensitive to the distance metric that is used for determining if a region
    is dense [81]. It is worth, however, noting that DBSCAN is among the most widely
    used clustering algorithms with numerous real-world applications such as anomaly
    detection in temperature data [118] and X-ray crystallography [79]. The authors
    of [109] believe that knowledge discovery in data streams is an important task
    for research, business, and community. They applied DBSCAN to a data stream to
    reveal the number of existing classes and subsequently label the data. Furthermore,
    in [52] this algorithm is adopted to determine the arbitrary shape of a cluster.
    The DBSCAN algorithm produces sets of clusters of arbitrary shape and outlying
    objects. 5.5. Feature extraction 5.5.1. Principal component analysis In Principle
    Component Analysis (PCA), the objective is to orthogonally project data points
    onto an L dimensional linear subspace, called the principal subspace, which has
    the maximal projected variance [83], [85]. Equivalently, the objective can be
    defined as finding a complete orthonormal set of L linear M-dimensional basis
    vectors and the corresponding linear projections of data points such that the
    average reconstruction error (10) is minimized, where is the average of all data
    points [82], [55]. Download : Download high-res image (200KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Algorithm 3 describes how the PCA technique achieves these objectives.
    Depending on how is calculated, the PCA algorithm can have different run times,
    i.e., , , and [119], [55], [120]. To deal with high dimensional data sets, there
    is alternative version of the PCA algorithm based on the iterative expectation
    maximization technique. In this algorithm, the covariance matrix of the dataset
    is not explicitly calculated, and its most computationally demanding steps are
    . In addition, this algorithm can be implemented in an online fashion, which can
    also be advantageous in cases where M and N are large [84], [56]. PCA is one of
    the most important preprocessing techniques in machine learning. Its application
    involves data compression, whitening, and data visualization. Examples of its
    practical applications are face recognition, interest rate derivative portfolios,
    and neuroscience. Furthermore, there exists a kernelized version of PCA, called
    KPCA, which can find nonlinear principal components [86], [84]. 5.5.2. Canonical
    correlation analysis Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is a linear dimensionality
    reduction technique that is closely related to PCA. Unlike PCA, which deals with
    one variable, CCA deals with two or more variables. Its objective is to find a
    corresponding pair of highly cross-correlated linear subspaces so that within
    one of the subspaces there is a correlation between each component and a single
    component from the other subspace. The optimal solution can be obtained by solving
    a generalized eigenvector problem [87], [88], [55]. Ref. [51] compared PCA with
    CCA for detecting intermittent faults and masking failures of indoor environments.
    5.6. Neural network One of the shortcomings of linear regression is that it is
    necessary to decide the types of basic functions. It is often difficult to choose
    the optimal basic functions. Therefore, in neural networks we fix the number of
    basic functions, but allow the model to learn the parameters of the basic functions.
    There exist many different types of neural networks, with different architectures,
    use cases, and applications. In subsequent subsections, we discuss the successful
    models used in smart data analysis. Note that neural networks are fast to process
    new data, because they are compact models. However, in contrast they usually require
    a large amount of computation to be trained. Moreover, they are easily adaptable
    to regression and classification problems [91], [90]. 5.6.1. Feed forward neural
    network Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFNN), also known as Multilayer Perceptrons
    (MLP), are the most common type of neural networks in practical applications.
    To explain this model, we begin with a simple two-layer FFNN model. Assume that
    we have D basic functions and our objective is to learn the parameters of these
    basic functions together with the function f discussed in Section 5.2.1. The form
    of the classification or regression task is (11) where , , , and . Fig. 3 visualizes
    this FFNN model. The elements of the input vector x are units (neurons) in the
    input layer, are the units in the hidden layer, and are the units in the output
    layer, which outputs f. Note that the activities of the units in each layer are
    determined by a nonlinear function of the activities in the previous layer. In
    machine learning literature, is also called an activation function. The activation
    function in the last layer is chosen with respect to the data processing task.
    For example, for a regression task we use a linear activation function, and for
    multiclass classification we use a softmax activation function [57], [91], [55].

    Fig. 3. A two-layer feed forward neural network. Note that each output neuron
    is connected to each input neuron, i.e., it is a fully connected neural network.
    With enough hidden units, an FFNN with at least two layers can approximate an
    arbitrary mapping from a finite input space to a finite output space [121], [122],
    [123]. However, finding the optimum set of weights w for an FFNN is an NP-complete
    problem [124]. To train the model, there exist a range of learning methods, such
    as stochastic gradient descent, adaptive delta, adaptive gradient, adaptive moment
    estimation, Nesterov''s accelerated gradient, and RMSprob. There also exist a
    range of methods to enhance the generalization of the model and reduce overfitting,
    such as weight decay, weight-sharing, early stopping, Bayesian fitting of neural
    nets, dropout, and generative pre-training [92], [89]. A two-layer FFNN has the
    properties of restricted representation and generalization. Moreover, compactly
    represented functions with l layers may require an exponential size with layers.
    Therefore, an alternative approach would be an FFNN with more than one hidden
    layers, i.e., a deep neural network, in which different high-level features share
    low-level features [93], [90]. Significant results using deep neural networks
    have led them to be the most commonly employed classifiers in machine learning
    [125], [57]. Ref. [126] presented a method to forecast the states of IoT elements
    based on an artificial neural network. The presented architecture of the neural
    network is a combination of a multilayered perceptron and a probabilistic neural
    network. Furthermore, [21] applied an FFNN for processing health data. 5.7. Time
    series and sequential data So far in this article, the discussed algorithms have
    all dealt with set of data points that are independent and identically distributed
    (i.i.d.). However, in many cases the set of data points are not i.i.d., and often
    result from time series measurements, such as the daily closing value of the Dow
    Jones Industrial Average or acoustic features at successive time frames. An example
    of a non-i.i.d. set of data points in a context other than a time series is a
    character sequence in a German sentence. In these cases, data points consist of
    sequences of pairs rather than being drawn in an i.i.d. manner from a joint distribution
    and such the sequences exhibit significant sequential correlations [127], [55].
    In a sequential supervised learning problem, when data points are sequential,
    we are given a training set consisting of N samples, where each of these is a
    pair of sequences. In each sample, and . Given a new, unseen input sequence x,
    the goal is to predict the desired output sequence y. Moreover, there exists a
    closely related problem called a time-series prediction problem, in which the
    goal is to predict the desired st element of a sequence . The key difference is
    that unlike in sequential supervised learning, where the entire sequence is available
    prior to any prediction, in a time-series prediction only the prefix of the sequence,
    up to the current time , is available. In addition, in sequential supervised learning
    the entire output sequence y must be predicted, whereas in time-series prediction
    the true observed values of the output sequence up to time t are given. It is
    worth noting that there is another closely-related task, called sequence classification,
    in which the goal is to predict the desired single categorical output y given
    an input sequence x [127]. There are a variety of machine learning models and
    methods that can deal with these tasks. Examples of these models and methods are
    hidden Markov models [128], [129], sliding-window methods [130], Kalman filter
    [131], conditional random fields [132], recurrent neural networks [133], [57],
    graph transformer networks [89], and maximum entropy Markov models [134]. In addition,
    sequential time series and sequential data exists in many real-world applications,
    including speech recognition [135], handwriting recognition [136], musical score
    following [137], and information extraction [134]. 5.8. Anomaly detection The
    problem of identifying items or patterns in a data set that do not conform to
    other items or an expected pattern is referred to as anomaly detection, and these
    unexpected patterns are called anomalies, outliers, novelties, exceptions, noise,
    surprises, or deviations [138], [139]. There are many challenges in the task of
    anomaly detection that distinguish it from a binary classification task. For example,
    an anomalous class is often severely underrepresented in the training set. In
    addition, anomalies exhibit considerably more diverse behavior than a normal system,
    and are sparse by nature [140], [139]. There are three broad categories of anomaly
    detection techniques, based on the extent to which the labels are available. In
    supervised anomaly detection techniques, a binary (abnormal and normal) labeled
    data set is given, and then a binary classifier is trained. This should deal with
    the problem of unbalanced data set resulting from the existence of few data points
    with an abnormal label. Semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques require a
    training set that contains only normal data points. Anomalies are then detected
    by building the normal behavior model of the system, and then testing the likelihood
    of the generation of the test data point by the learned model. Unsupervised anomaly
    detection techniques deal with an unlabeled data set, by making the implicit assumption
    that most of the data points are normal [139]. Anomaly detection is of use in
    many real-world applications, such as system health monitoring, credit card fraud
    detection, intrusion detection [141], detecting eco-system disturbances, and military
    surveillance. Moreover, anomaly detection can be used as a preprocessing algorithm
    for removing outliers from a data set, which can significantly improve the performance
    of subsequent machine learning algorithms, especially in supervised learning tasks
    [142], [143]. In the following subsection, we shall explain one-class support
    vector machines, which represent one of the most popular techniques for anomaly
    detection. Ref. [45] constructed a novel outlier detection algorithm that uses
    statistical techniques to identify outliers and anomalies in power datasets collected
    from smart environments. 5.8.1. One-class support vector machines One-class support
    vector machines (OCSVMs) represent a semi-supervised anomaly detection technique,
    and are an extension of the SVMs discussed in Section 5.1.3 for unlabeled data
    sets. Given a training set drawn from an underlying probability distribution P,
    OCSVMs aim to estimate a subset S of the input space such that the probability
    that a drawn sample from P lies outside of S is bounded by a fixed value between
    0 and 1. This problem is approached by learning a binary function f that captures
    the input regions where the probability density lives. Therefore, f is negative
    in the complement of S. The functional form of f can be computed by solving a
    quadratic programming problem [94], [95]. One-class SVMs are useful in many anomaly
    detection applications, such as anomaly detection in sensor networks [144], system-called
    intrusion detection [145], network intrusion detection [146], and anomaly detection
    in wireless sensor networks [147]. Ref. [52] reviewed various techniques for stream
    data outlier detection and the related issues in detail. Ref. [53] employed one-class
    SVM to detect anomalies by modeling complex normal patterns in the data. In the
    following section, we discuss how to overcome the challenges of applying machine
    learning algorithms to IoT smart data. 6. Discussion of taxonomy of machine learning
    algorithms To reach suitable decisions for smart data analysis, it is necessary
    to determine which task should be accomplished out of structure discovery, finding
    unusual data points, predicting values, predicting categories, or feature extraction.
    To discover the structure of unlabeled data, clustering algorithms can provide
    the most appropriate tools. K-means, described in 5.4.1, is the most well-known
    and frequently applied clustering algorithm, and can handle a large volume of
    data with a broad range of data types. Refs. [50], [52] proposed a method for
    applying the K-means algorithm for managing smart city and smart home data. DB-scan,
    described in 5.4.2, is another clustering algorithm the structure of data from
    unlabeled data, and is applied in [109], [52], [47] to cluster smart citizen behavior.
    To find unusual data points and anomalies in smart data, two important algorithms
    can be applied. Namely, these are the one-class SVM and PCA-based anomaly detection
    methods explained in 5.5.1, which can train anomalies and noisy data with a high
    performance. Refs. [52], [53] applied a one-class SVM to monitor and detect human
    activity anomalies. In order to predict values and classify sequenced data, the
    linear regression and SVR methods described in 5.2.1 and 5.2.2, respectively,
    are the two frequently applied algorithms. The objective of the models applied
    in these algorithms is to process and train data of high velocity. For example,
    [48], [46] applied a linear regression algorithm for real-time prediction. Another
    fast training algorithm is the classification and regression tree described in
    5.3.1, which has been applied to classify smart citizen behaviors [48], [47].
    To predict the categories of data, neural networks are suitable learning models
    for function approximation problems. Moreover, because smart data should be accurate
    and requires a long training time, a multi-class neural network can provide an
    appropriate solution. For instance, the FFNN explained in 5.6.1 has been applied
    to reduce future energy consumption, by predicting how data will be generated
    in the future and how the redundancy of this data will be removed [21], [126],
    [148]. The SVM explained in 5.1.3 is another popular classification algorithm,
    which is capable of handling massive amounts of data and classifying their different
    types. Because SVM can handle a high volume and a variety of types of data, it
    is commonly applied in most smart data processing algorithms. For example, [109],
    [48] applied SVM to classify traffic data. PCA and CCA, described in 5.5.1 and
    5.5.2, respectively, are the two algorithms most commonly applied for extracting
    features of data. Moreover, CCA can show the correlation between two categories
    of data. A type of PCA or CCA can also be applied to discover anomalies. Ref.
    [51] applied PCA and CCA to monitor public places and detect events in social
    areas. The chosen algorithm should be implemented and developed to reach the correct
    decisions. A sample implemented code is available from the open source GitHub
    license at https://github.com/mhrezvan/SVM-on-Smart-Traffic-Data. 7. Research
    trends and open issues As discussed previously, data analysis provides a significant
    contribution to IoT. In order to exploit the full potential of data analysis for
    extracting new insights from data, IoT must overcome some major challenges. These
    can be categorized into three different types. 7.1. IoT data characteristics Because
    the data is the basis of extracting knowledge, it is vital to have high quality
    information. This condition can affect the accuracy of knowledge extraction in
    a direct manner. Because IoT produces a high volume, fast velocity, and different
    varieties of data, preserving the data quality is a challenging task. Although
    many solutions have been introduced to solve these problems, none of them can
    handle all aspects of data characteristics in an accurate manner, because of the
    distributed nature of big data management solutions and real-time processing platforms.
    The abstraction of IoT data is low; that is, the data that comes from different
    resources in IoT consists mostly of raw data, and not sufficient for analysis.
    A wide variety of solutions have been proposed, while most of these require further
    improvement. For instance, semantic technologies tend to enhance the abstraction
    of IoT data through annotation algorithms, while they require further effort to
    overcome its velocity and volume. 7.2. IoT applications IoT applications fall
    into different categories according to their unique attributions and features.
    Certain issues should be consider for running data analysis in IoT applications
    in an accurate manner. First, the privacy of collected data is highly critical,
    because data collection processes can include personal or critical business data,
    which is inevitable to solve the privacy issues. Second, according to the vast
    number of resources and simply-designed hardware in IoT, it is vital to consider
    security parameters, such as network security and data encryption. Otherwise,
    by ignoring security in the design and implementation, an infected network of
    IoT devices can lead to a crisis. 7.3. IoT data analytic algorithms According
    to the characteristic of smart data, analytic algorithms should be able to handle
    big data. That is, IoT requires algorithms that can analyze data that comes from
    a variety of sources in real-time. Many attempts have been made to address this
    issue. For example, deep learning algorithms, which are a form of neural networks
    incorporating evolution can reach a high accuracy rate if they have enough data
    and time. Deep learning algorithms can easily be influenced by noisy smart data.
    Furthermore, neural network-based algorithms lack interpretation, that is, data
    scientists cannot understand the reasons for the model results. In the same manner,
    semi-supervised algorithms, which model a small amount of labeled data with a
    large amount of unlabeled data, can assist IoT data analysis. 8. Conclusions IoT
    consists of a vast number of different devices that are connected with each other
    and transmit huge amounts of data. The smart city is one of the most important
    applications of IoT, and provides various services in domains such as energy,
    mobility, and urban planning. These services can be enhanced and optimized by
    analyzing the smart data collected from these areas. To extract knowledge from
    collected data, many data analytic algorithms can be applied. Choosing a suitable
    algorithm for specific IoT or smart city application is an important issue. In
    this article, many IoT data analytic studies are reviewed to address this issue.
    Here, three facts should be considered in applying data analytic algorithms to
    smart data. The first is that different applications in IoT and smart cities have
    their own characteristics, such as the number of devices and types of the data
    that they generate. The second is that the generated data will have specific features
    that should be considered. The third is that the taxonomy of algorithms is another
    important aspect in applying data analysis to smart data. The findings in this
    article make it easy to choose a suitable algorithm for a particular problem.
    The analytic algorithms fall into eight categories, described in detail. This
    is followed by reviewing application specifics of smart city use cases. The characteristics
    and qualities of smart data are described in detail. In the discussion section,
    the manner in which data characteristics and application specifics can lead to
    choosing a proper data analytic algorithms is reviewed. In the regarding future
    trends, section recent issues and the future path for research in the field of
    smart data analytics are discussed. Acknowledgments The authors would like to

  title: 'Machine learning for internet of things data analysis: a survey'
  verbatim_quote1: First, because data is generated from different sources with specific
    data types, it is important to adopt or develop algorithms that can handle the
    characteristics of the data.
  verbatim_quote2: Second, the great number of resources that generate data in real-time
    are not without the problem of scale and velocity. Finally, finding the best data
    model that fits the data is one of the most important issues for pattern recognition
    and for better analysis of IoT data.
  verbatim_quote3: These issues have opened a vast number of opportunities in expanding
    new developments.

  analysis: 'The paper provides a survey of automated systems for agricultural monitoring,
    focusing on data collection, transmission, analysis, and decision-making. It emphasizes
    the use of IoT and machine learning techniques. The authors present a case study
    involving a wireless sensor network-based crop health monitoring system along
    with NDVI mapping of multi-spectral imagery captured by a drone. The case study
    demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in monitoring crop health,
    identifying abnormal behavior, and predicting potential issues.


    This paper is relevant to the overall literature review intention in several ways.
    Firstly, it aligns with the exploration of current automated systems for real-time
    irrigation management, particularly those integrating IoT and machine learning
    technologies. Secondly, it addresses the examination of automation across the
    entire pipeline, from data collection to decision-making, as it covers data acquisition,
    transmission, processing, analysis, and automated action.


    In terms of specific subsections and sections of the review, the paper is most
    relevant to:


    Section 3.1: Irrigation Management Data

    Subsection: Volume, frequency, format, and source of the data


    The paper discusses considerations for data volume, frequency, format, and source
    in the context of IoT-based agricultural systems. It highlights the importance
    of collecting massive datasets covering various crop parameters to enable precise
    decision-making.


    Section 4: Remote Sensing Applications in Agriculture

    Subsection: Smart irrigation systems


    The paper presents a comprehensive overview of smart irrigation systems, including
    IoT-based techniques and remote sensing approaches. It reviews existing applications,
    highlighting their advantages and limitations. The case study presented in the
    paper further demonstrates the practical implementation of a smart irrigation
    system.


    The paper''s relevance to the research gaps and proposed solutions identified
    in the literature review is as follows:


    Research Gap: Limited adoption of precision agriculture (PA) technologies due
    to high hardware costs

    Proposed Solution: The paper discusses cost-effective hardware components and
    sensors suitable for small-scale arable land, making PA more accessible.


    Research Gap: Lack of interoperability between equipment due to different digital
    standards

    Proposed Solution: The paper emphasizes the need for new methods and protocols
    to integrate different machine communication standards and facilitate efficient
    data sharing.


    Research Gap: Limited consideration of weather variations in PA systems

    Proposed Solution: The paper highlights the importance of addressing environmental
    variations, such as rain, temperature fluctuations, and wind speed, in the development
    and deployment of PA systems.


    In summary, this paper contributes to the literature review intention by providing
    a comprehensive analysis of automated systems for agricultural monitoring, emphasizing
    the role of IoT and machine learning. It addresses key considerations for data
    collection and analysis, presents a case study demonstrating the effectiveness
    of the proposed approach, and discusses research gaps and proposed solutions.'

    \ of Things (IoT)-based automation of agricultural events can change the agriculture\n\
    sector from being static and manual to dynamic and smart, leading to enhanced\
    \ production with\nreduced human efforts. Precision Agriculture (PA) along with\
    \ Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) are the\nmain drivers of automation in the agriculture\
    \ domain. PA uses speciﬁc sensors and software to ensure\nthat the crops receive\
    \ exactly what they need to optimize productivity and sustainability. PA includes\n\
    retrieving real data about the conditions of soil, crops and weather from the\
    \ sensors deployed in the\nﬁelds. High-resolution images of crops are obtained\
    \ from satellite or air-borne platforms (manned\nor unmanned), which are further\
    \ processed to extract information used to provide future decisions.\nIn this\
    \ paper, a review of near and remote sensor networks in the agriculture domain\
    \ is presented\nalong with several considerations and challenges. This survey\
    \ includes wireless communication\ntechnologies, sensors, and wireless nodes used\
    \ to assess the environmental behaviour, the platforms\nused to obtain spectral\
    \ images of crops, the common vegetation indices used to analyse spectral\nimages\
    \ and applications of WSN in agriculture. As a proof of concept, we present a\
    \ case study\nshowing how WSN-based PA system can be implemented. We propose an\
    \ IoT-based smart solution\nfor crop health monitoring, which is comprised of\
    \ two modules. The ﬁrst module is a wireless sensor\nnetwork-based system to monitor\
    \ real-time crop health status. The second module uses a low altitude\nremote\
    \ sensing platform to obtain multi-spectral imagery, which is further processed\
    \ to classify\nhealthy and unhealthy crops. We also highlight the results obtained\
    \ using a case study and list the\nchallenges and future directions based on our\
    \ work.\nKeywords: smart agriculture; precision agriculture; vegetation index;\
    \ Internet of Things\n1. Introduction\nThe rapidly-growing human population has\
    \ increased food demands for human survival on\nthe Earth. Meeting the food requirements\
    \ with limited resources of the planet is a big challenge [1].\nSeveral state-of-the-art\
    \ technologies are being incorporated in the agriculture domain to enhance\nthe\
    \ productivity to cope with this challenge. Precision Agriculture (PA) is comprised\
    \ of near and\nremote sensing techniques using IoT sensors, which help to monitor\
    \ crop states at multiple growth\nlevels. PA involves the acquisition and processing\
    \ of a large amount of data related to crop health.\nMultiple parameters are involved\
    \ in plants health, including water level, temperature and others.\nPA enables\
    \ a farmer to know precisely what parameters are needed for healthy crop, where\
    \ these\nparameters are needed and in what amount at a particular instance of\
    \ time. This requires collecting\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796; doi:10.3390/s19173796\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n2 of 25\nmassive information\
    \ from different sources and different parts of the ﬁeld such as soil nutrients,\
    \ the\npresence of pests and weeds, chlorophyll content in plants and some weather\
    \ conditions. All collected\ninformation needs to be analysed to produce agronomic\
    \ recommendations. For instance, given the\ndevelopmental stage of plants, their\
    \ level of greenness (chlorophyll content) reveals the nutrients\nneeded. This\
    \ information is combined with the characteristics of the soil where the plant\
    \ is located\nalong with weather forecast. All collected information is further\
    \ used to determine how much of a\ncertain fertilizer should be applied to that\
    \ plant on the next day. The delivery of agronomic information\non the right time\
    \ to farmer and ensuring that he/she applies these recommendations are key to\n\
    enhancing the yields.\nThe foremost driver of PA is a WSN, which is a network\
    \ of multiple wireless nodes connected\ntogether to monitor the physical parameters\
    \ of environment. Each wireless node is comprised of a\nradio transceiver, a micro-controller,\
    \ sensor(s), an antenna, along with other circuitry that enables it\nto communicate\
    \ with some gateway to transmit information collected by the sensor(s) [2]. Sensors\n\
    measure the physical parameters and send the collected information to the controller,\
    \ which further\ntransmits this information to the cloud or a portable device.\
    \ The agriculture sector has multiple\nrequirements comprised of soil statistics,\
    \ crops’ nature, weather conditions, fertilizer types and water\nrequirements.\
    \ Crops have diverse requirements depending on different crops on the same land\
    \ and the\nsame plant on different lands with different weather conditions. Sensors\
    \ monitor the varying behaviour\nof these crop parameters. Due to rapid advancement\
    \ in WSN technologies, the size and the cost of\nsensors have reduced, which make\
    \ it feasible to implement them in many sectors of life including\nagriculture.\
    \ The most common sensors used in the agriculture domain that capture environmental\n\
    parameters related to crops [3] are listed in Table 1.\nIn general, a WSN consists\
    \ of one or more wireless nodes that are further connected with sensors.\nThese\
    \ nodes are tiny devices that are responsible for collecting data. Nodes are divided\
    \ into two types,\na source node that collects the data, and the other is sink\
    \ or gateway node, which receives data from the\nsource nodes. A sink node has\
    \ more computational power compared to a source node. However, there\nare energy,\
    \ memory, power, size, data rate and price constraints when choosing wireless\
    \ nodes. Table 2\nshows a comparison of wireless nodes along with their common\
    \ speciﬁcations [3]. Among all wireless\nnodes presented in Table 2, MICA2 is\
    \ considered to be more suitable as compared to others because of\nits large number\
    \ of expansion connectors, which makes it suitable to connect with several sensors.\n\
    Many applications using WSN have been proposed since the last decade to monitor\
    \ crops’ health\nremotely. In [4], a cyber-physical system was presented for monitoring\
    \ of a potato crop. Cyber physical\nsystems can be expressed as smart systems\
    \ that are comprised of software, hardware and physical\ncomponents, integrated\
    \ together to sense the varying states of the real world. The proposed system\n\
    consists of three layers: the ﬁrst layer is the physical layer, in which all sensory\
    \ data are collected;\nthe second layer is the network layer in which data are\
    \ transmitted to the cloud; the third layer is\nthe decision layer in which the\
    \ data are analysed and processed to make decisions according to the\nobservations.\n\
    There are several challenges in IoT-based systems due to exponential increasing\
    \ devices. As in\na typical IoT network, every node transmits data to the remote\
    \ cloud, which results in cloud\ncongestion, and the main challenges underlying\
    \ the IOT-based system are latency with minimum\npower requirements, better usage\
    \ of bandwidth and intermittent Internet connectivity. Fog computing\nand edge\
    \ computing are the state-of-the-art techniques to overcome these issues; which\
    \ reduce the\ncomputational burden of cloud. The main goal of fog computing is\
    \ to conserve energy and bandwidth,\nwhich helps to increase the quality of service\
    \ to the end users. In [5], an energy-efﬁcient architecture of\nthe Fog of Everything\
    \ was presented, which was comprised of six layers. The ﬁrst layer was an Internet\n\
    Of Everything (IOE) layer, where things (could be ﬁxed, mobile or nomadic) functioned\
    \ under multiple\nspatially-distributed clusters. The second was a wireless access\
    \ network that supported Thing to Fog\n(T2F) and Fog to Thing (F2T) communication\
    \ over the wireless channel. In the third layer, the connected\nfog nodes behaved\
    \ such as a virtualized cluster. There was an inter-fog backbone in the fourth\
    \ layer,\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n3 of 25\nwhich was responsible for connectivity\
    \ among fog nodes. The next layer was the virtualization layer,\nwhich provided\
    \ each connected thing with the ability to augment its limited resource set, exploiting\n\
    the computation capability at the virtual clone. In the last layer, there was\
    \ an overlay inter-clone\nvirtual network that empowered Peer to Peer (P2P) communication.\
    \ Then, a protocol stack for FOE\nwas presented, which was further tested by creating\
    \ a small prototype named as V-FOE and simulated\non the iFogsim toolkit. The\
    \ results provided strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed\nframework\
    \ and more energy efﬁciency with reduced failure rate and delay.\nTable 1. Wireless\

    The energy efﬁciency is the most serious consideration while developing any fog\
    \ architecture.\nIn [6], an energy-efﬁcient protocol for a fog-supported wireless\
    \ sensor network was presented, which\nmaximized the lifetime of the network by\
    \ uniformly distributing the energy among connected nodes.\nThe performance of\
    \ the proposed algorithm was compared with the existing state-of-the-art algorithms\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 3796\n4 of 25\nin MATLAB. The results showed that the proposed\
    \ algorithm was highly energy efﬁcient with a\nprolonged network lifetime.\nRegardless\
    \ of all the advancements in the IoT domain, the adoption of PA has been limited\
    \ to\nsome developed countries. Because of the lack of resources, remote sensing-based\
    \ techniques to\nmonitor crop health are not common in under-developed countries\
    \ such as Pakistan, which results in\na loss of yield. Pakistan is an agricultural\
    \ country due to is large arable land and climatic variations,\nwhich make it\
    \ suitable to cultivate multiple types of crops. Despite all these natural resources,\
    \ Pakistan\nis still unable to produce massive yields [7]. The main reason behind\
    \ the low production is traditional\nfarming practices, which are used for crop\
    \ health monitoring and yield estimation. These techniques\nare completely based\
    \ on farmer’s intuition and experience. Farmers visit the ﬁelds in order to monitor\n\
    the crop, which is very laborious and quite challenging in the case of large arable\
    \ land. In this case, the\narea under insect/pest attack is inaccurately measured,\
    \ which can result in over spraying of insecticide\nand pesticide, which adversely\
    \ affects the nutrition in crops.\nKeeping in mind all these issues, our motivation\
    \ is to provide the industry and research\ncommunities with a survey of technologies,\
    \ metrics and current practices concerning communication\ndevices, sensors and\
    \ platforms used to monitor and analyse multiple sources of data (spectral images,\n\
    IoT, etc.) used in environmental and agriculture applications. As the main contribution,\
    \ we generated\na technological taxonomy for PA, which was driven by an IoT-based\
    \ architecture to monitor the crops’\nhealth. The developed system had two modules\
    \ including wireless sensor network-based crop heath\nmonitoring in which multiple\
    \ sensors were used to get the real-time heath status of crop; the other\none\
    \ was NDVI-based analysis of spectra images captured by a drone to assess the\
    \ chlorophyll content,\nwhich was further used to monitor the health of the crop.\n\
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the most common\
    \ wireless\ncommunication technologies used in the agriculture domain; Section\
    \ 3 explains the spectral\nimage-based remote sensing techniques, platforms and\
    \ vegetation indices; Section 4 describes remote\nsensing applications in the\
    \ agriculture sector; Section 5 presents a case study on IoT-based and\nUAV-based\
    \ PA; Section 6 explains the experiments and results; challenges are discussed\
    \ in Section 7;\nand conclusions and future directions are presented in Section\

    \ protocols have been introduced in the last few decades due to the rapid\nincrease\
    \ in IoT devices and WSN technologies. Each protocol has its own speciﬁcations\
    \ depending on\nthe bandwidth, number of free channels, data rate, battery timing,\
    \ price and other factors [8]. The most\ncommonly-used protocols for wireless\
    \ communication in IoT-based applications in agriculture are:\nSensors 2019, 19,\
    \ 3796\n5 of 25\n2.1. Cellular\nCellular technology is most suitable for applications\
    \ that require an extraordinary data rate.\nIt can utilize GSM, 3G and 4G cellular\
    \ communication capabilities by providing reliable high-speed\nconnectivity to\
    \ the Internet, requiring higher power consumption.\nIt requires infrastructure\
    \ to\nbe deployed and operation cost and back up staff for it with a centralized\
    \ managed authority.\n4G cellular technology requires more battery power, but\
    \ cellular technology is a good option in\nunderground wireless sensor networks,\
    \ such as security systems in smart home projects and agriculture\napplications\
    \ [9]. A smart irrigation systems was presented in [10], in which several soil\
    \ moisture\nsensors were deployed in the ﬁeld in the ZigBee mesh network. The\
    \ reading captured from the ﬁelds\nwere transmitted over the cloud using the cellular\
    \ 4G LTE network.\n2.2. 6LoWPAN\n6LoWPAN is an IP-based communication protocol,\
    \ which was the ﬁrst protocol used for IoT\ncommunication. 6LoWPAN is also low\
    \ cost because of the low bandwidth and low power consumption.\n6LoWPAN supports\
    \ multiple topologies such as star and mesh topologies. To handle interoperability\n\
    between IPv6 and IEEE 802.15.4, there is an adaptation layer between the network\
    \ layer and the\nMAC layer [8]. The applications for 6LoWPAN are monitoring the\
    \ health equipment, environment\nmonitoring and in security and home automation\
    \ systems. In [11], a 6LoWPAN-enabled wireless sensor\nnetwork was presented to\
    \ monitor the soil properties of crops. The 6LoWPAN system architecture\nfor precision\
    \ agriculture application was discussed in [12] where the performance evaluation\
    \ of this\nprotocol was discussed with several baud rates and power constraints.\n\
    2.3. ZigBee\nZigBee is a wireless communication protocol widely used in precision\
    \ agriculture to monitor\nenvironmental conditions related to crops’ health [13].\
    \ It is based on the wireless 802.15.4 standard.\nBasically, it was developed\
    \ for personal area networks by the ZigBee alliance [8]. It has a ﬂexible\nnetwork\
    \ structure, long battery life, supports mesh, star and tree topology with multi-hop\
    \ data\ntransmission, is easily installed and supports large nodes. It has a short\
    \ range with limited data speed\nand is less secure compared to Wi-Fi-based systems.\
    \ ZigBee is very common in smart agriculture\napplications such as smart green\
    \ houses and smart irrigation systems [14]. In [15], a smart irrigation\nsystem\
    \ was presented based on the ZigBee communication protocol. This system consisted\
    \ of two\nnodes, i.e., a sensor node and an actuator node. The sensor node was\
    \ comprised of soil moisture\nsensors, which monitored the water level in the\
    \ soil. The actuator module was responsible for taking\nactions according to the\
    \ water level of the soil. All communication was carried out by means of\nZigBee\
    \ protocol.\n2.4. BLE\nBLE is as famous as the Bluetooth smart technology, which\
    \ is a suitable protocol for IoT\napplications including agriculture [16]. It\
    \ is particularly designed for low bandwidth, low latency and\nshort range for\
    \ IoT applications. The main advantages of BLE over typical Bluetooth include\
    \ lower\nsetup time, lower power consumption and unlimited support for nodes in\
    \ a star topology. It has a\nvery limited range of 10 meters. However, the drawbacks\
    \ are that it can only provide communication\nbetween two devices, it presents\
    \ low security, and it can lose connection during communication. In [17],\na BLE-based\
    \ infrastructure was presented to collect the sensors’ data. The proposed system\
    \ utilized a\nsmart phone to collect the data of sensors using BLE, where sensors\
    \ were deployed in the plants, i.e.,\nsoil moisture sensors and soil temperature\
    \ sensor.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n6 of 25\n2.5. RFID\nRFID systems consist of\
    \ a reader and a transponder, which have a very small radio frequency,\ncalled\
    \ the RF tag. This tag is programmed electronically with distinctive information\
    \ that has a reading\ncharacteristic. RFID has two technologies for the tag system\
    \ the ﬁrst is the active reader tag system,\nand the other is the passive reader\
    \ tag. Active reader tag systems are more expensive, as they utilize\nmore battery\
    \ power and use high frequencies. However, passive reader tag systems are low\
    \ powered.\nSome IoT applications using RFID include smart shopping, healthcare,\
    \ national security and smart\nagriculture applications. An IoT-based smart irrigation\
    \ system based on RFID was presented in [18].\nThe system was comprised of soil\
    \ moisture and soil temperature sensors along with a water control\nsystem, so\
    \ it collected the reading of the sensors and sent these readings to the cloud\
    \ using RFID\ncommunication protocols, where the user controlled a water pump\
    \ based on the water level of the soil.\n2.6. Wi-Fi\nWi-Fi is the most common\
    \ communication protocol that enables devices to communicate over\na wireless\
    \ signal. Wi-Fi provides Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) connectivity to millions\
    \ of\nlocations, i.e., homes, ofﬁces and public locations such as cafes, hotels\
    \ and airports with high speed.\nThe Wi-Fi protocol supports IEEE 802.11, 802.11a,\
    \ 802.11b, 802.11g and 802.11n. Wi-Fi is widely used\nin IoT-based applications\
    \ including agriculture systems, i.e., smart irrigation, crop health monitoring\n\
    and greenhouses. In [19], an infrastructure was presented to monitor environmental\
    \ parameters\ninside the greenhouse such as temperature, light intensity and soil\
    \ moisture level. This platform\nwas comprised of sensors that collected the data\
    \ related to the environmental variation and sent to\nthe cloud using Wi-Fi. Similarly,\
    \ another smart agriculture system based on Wi-Fi communication\nprotocols was\
    \ presented in [20]. This last one consisted of a Raspberry Pi connected with\
    \ multiple\nsensors, which collected the data. The collected data were further\
    \ transmitted to the cloud using Wi-Fi\ncommunication protocols.\n2.7. LoRaWAN\n\
    LoRaWAN operates on the LoRa network. LoRaWAN deﬁnes the system architecture and\n\
    communication protocol of the network, while the physical layer of LoRa enables\
    \ the link for\nlong-range communication. LoRaWAN manages the frequencies in communication,\
    \ data rate and\npower consumption for all devices. LoRaWAN is common in agricultural\
    \ applications because of\nits large coverage area and low power consumption [21].\
    \ In [14], a smart irrigation system based on\nLoRaWAN was presented. Table 3\
    \ shows the comparison of all mentioned wireless communication\nprotocols [8].\
    \ Among all wireless communication technologies, 6LoWPAN and ZigBee are considered\n\
    to be more suitable for PA application because both are based on mesh networking,\
    \ which makes them\nsuitable to cover large area.\nTable 3. Wireless communication\

    \ Image-Based Remote Sensing\nRemote sensing has been widely used in PA to monitor\
    \ crops’ health for the last two decades.\nRemote sensing is a phenomenon in which\
    \ physical conditions of the Earth are observed remotely by\ncalculating the emitted\
    \ and reﬂected radiation from some distance. There are special cameras that\n\
    are used to capture images for further analysis to ﬁnd the characteristics of\
    \ a speciﬁc area. Multiple\nplatforms are used to mount these cameras that capture\
    \ images of the objects.\n3.1. Spectral Image Platforms\nRemote sensing platform\
    \ considerations for spectral images are airborne-based, satellite-based\nand\
    \ Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based [22]. Each platform has its own coverage\
    \ range, which\nis determined by three factors: (i) Ground Sampling Distance (GSD),\
    \ which is computed in terms of\nspatial resolution, (ii) data collection rate\
    \ or frequency and (iii) average distance between the object\nand sensor. Apart\
    \ from coverage range, several factors [23] affect the performance of platforms,\n\
    as mentioned in Table 4.\nTable 4. Key differences between spectral image platforms.\n\

    \ are considered to be the most stable platforms among\nall others. These platforms\
    \ consist of satellites, rockets and space shuttles. Space borne platforms are\n\
    categorized based on the orbits and timing. The advantages of satellite-based\
    \ remote sensing include\nhigh spatial resolution, which makes it promising to\
    \ extract extensive time-series data. The images\nobtained by satellite platforms\
    \ cover large area and are stable without noise, which is normally induced\ndue\
    \ to interference while image capturing. However, the main problem with satellite-based\
    \ platforms\nis their high cost in the case of high spatial resolution images.\
    \ The second problem is their strictly ﬁxed\ntime schedule, so data cannot be\
    \ collected at critical timings. The re-visitation times vary from twice\nin one\
    \ day to 16 days, depending on the orbit of the satellite. The other big problem\
    \ is that satellite\nplatforms are highly sensitive to weather conditions, so\
    \ if the weather is cloudy, the captured image will\nhave less detailed information.\
    \ Table 5 shows the main types of satellites with their speciﬁcations [22].\n\
    Among all satellite platforms presented in Table 5, some satellite data are freely\
    \ available,\nwhile others provide a commercial solution. The commercial solutions\
    \ such as Pleiades-1 provide\nimages with a high resolution and a revisit time\
    \ of one day. QuickBird, Landsat-8 and Sentinel are\nfrequently-used satellite\
    \ platforms used to obtain hyperspectral imagery. QuickBird was launched\nin 2001\
    \ by USA. The Panchromatic (PAN) and four Multi-Spectral (MS) imagery sensors\
    \ are used in\nQuickBird with a GSD of 0.7 × 0.7–2.6 × 2.6 m with a revisit time\
    \ 1–3.5 days. QuickBird provides a\nsmall revisit time, but it is a commercial\
    \ solution. In contrast to QuickBird, Landsat-8 and Sentinel\nprovide free solutions.\
    \ Landsat-8 was launched in 2013 by the USA. Landsat-8 provides a GSD of\n16 days\
    \ with PAN and 11-MS imagery sensors. Though revisit time of Landsat-8 is much\
    \ higher\ncompared to QuickBird, but it provides images with 11 different multi-spectral\
    \ bands.\nSentinel is another broadly-used satellite launched by the EU. It currently\
    \ has three missions,\ni.e., Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3. These missions\
    \ provide images with 21 MS bands with\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n8 of 25\nrevisit\
    \ times of 5–10 days depending on which Sentinel mission is used. However, Sentinel-2\
    \ is a\ncommonly-used platform in precision agriculture as it provides data freely\
    \ at a 10-m spatial resolution\nand covers a swath width of 290 km. By combining\
    \ Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B, the revisit time is\nfurther reduced to ﬁve days,\
    \ which helps in change detection. The complete details of all satellite\nplatforms\
    \ with their speciﬁcations are listed in Table 5, where other platforms such as\
    \ SAT, MODIS\nand WordView are also considered.\nTable 5. Satellite platforms\

    much smaller than satellite-based ones, but relatively greater than the UAV platforms.\

    \ a vibrant alternative to satellite and airborne, which are quite ﬂexible and\
    \ cost\neffective. A typical UAV platform consists of a communication and navigation\
    \ system that incorporates\na set of sensors mounted on it. Among UAV platforms,\
    \ there are mainly ﬁxed-wing platforms. and\nmultirotor options are available.\
    \ The ﬂying time is based on the payload weight. In general, a longer\nﬂying time\
    \ is achieved by ﬁxed-wing systems, which demands lighter weight payloads. For\
    \ example,\nhigh-deﬁnition cameras weighing less than 300 grams as the payload\
    \ of a ﬁxed-wing UAV allow it to ﬂy\nfor around two hours using currently available\
    \ battery power [24]. On the contrary, battery-powered\nmultirotor UAV with higher\
    \ payload capacity have a reduced ﬂying time, i.e., around 15–25 min.\nTable 7\
    \ shows UAV platforms commonly used in the agriculture domain and concretely to\
    \ monitor\nthe health of crops remotely [22]. Among these platforms, DJI/Phantom-2\
    \ is a more suitable choice\nfor intermediate agricultural land because of its\
    \ low cost and ease of use. The other advantage of this\nplatform is that it provides\
    \ support for mounting multiple cameras, which helps to monitor the crop in\n\
    multiple electro-magnetic bands. The American Aerospace/RS-16 is also an option\
    \ because of its ﬂight\ntime and large are coverage, but due to its high cost,\
    \ this platform is not common.\nIn [25], the ESAFLY A2500_WH helicopter was used\
    \ to implement the platform of the UAV\nwith Tetra cam ADC Micro as the camera\
    \ to capture hyper-spectral images of two different types of\ncultivation, i.e.,\
    \ vineyard and tomato. The images captured by the UAV platform are very high in\n\
    resolution, so more information can be extracted as compared to satellite images.\
    \ To assess the health\nof a crop, three types of Vegetation Index (VI) maps have\
    \ been computed.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n10 of 25\nTable 7. UAV platforms for\

    Camera\n3.2. Vegetation Indices\nUsing multi-spectral images from the remote sensors\
    \ described above, a series of Vegetation\nIndices (VIs) can be computed. Vegetation\
    \ Indices (VIs) obtained from remote sensing-based canopies\nare effective algorithms\
    \ for quantitative and qualitative evaluations of vigour, vegetation cover and\n\
    growth dynamics, among other applications [26]. Hitherto, no uniﬁed mathematical\
    \ expression exists\nthat deﬁnes all VIs due to the complexity of the several\
    \ light spectra combinations, instrumentation,\nresolutions and platforms used.\
    \ In particular, this section focuses on vegetation indices NDVI, GDVI\nand SAVI,\
    \ as they are widely used in PA.\n3.2.1. NDVI\nThe Normalized Difference Vegetation\
    \ Index (NDVI) is the most popular VI that is extensively\nused to ﬁnd the content\
    \ of green in PA applications [27,28]. It uses Red (R) and Near Infrared (NIR)\n\
    channels to compute the NDVI index. More NIR light is absorbed by healthy vegetation;\
    \ however,\nabsorption ratio is very small for red light. NDVI is computed by\
    \ Equation (1) and returns a value\nbetween −1 and 1 [29].\nNDVI = NIR − R\nNIR\
    \ + R\n(1)\nHigher NDVI value indicate healthy vegetation, while smaller values\
    \ of NDVI show that vegetation is\nvery small at that speciﬁc region. There is\
    \ another form of NDVI, i.e., the Green Normalized Vegetation\nIndex (GNDVI),\
    \ which uses the green channel instead of red. GNDVI is computed by Equation (2):\n\
    GNDVI = NIR − G\nNIR + G\n(2)\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n11 of 25\n3.2.2. Difference\
    \ Vegetation Index\nThe DVI was proposed to reduce the effect of soil reﬂectance,\
    \ which is not covered by NDVI [30].\nDVI is different between the reﬂectance\
    \ of the NIR band to the reﬂectance of the red band. DVI is also\ncomputed with\
    \ the green band, i.e., GDVI. Both DVI and GDVI are computed by Equations (3)\
    \ and (4):\nDVI = NIR − R\n(3)\nGDVI = NIR − G\n(4)\n3.2.3. SAVI\nNDVI and DVI\
    \ do not compensate the background effect of soil. Therefore, many vegetation\n\
    indices were introduced to compensate the effect of soil reﬂectance. The Soil\
    \ Adjusted Vegetation Index\n(SAVI), the Green Soil Adjusted vegetation Index\
    \ (GSAVI), the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation\nIndex (OSAVI), the Green Optimized\
    \ Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OGSAVI) and the Modiﬁed\nSoil Adjusted Vegetation\
    \ Index (MSAVI) [31–33] are common among them, which are computed by\nEquations\
    \ (5)–(9):\nSAVI =\n1.5(NIR − R)\n(NIR + R + 0.5)\n(5)\nGSAVI = 1.5(NIR − G)\n\
    NIR + G + 0.5\n(6)\nOSAVI =\n(NIR − G)\nNIR + R + 0.16\n(7)\nGOSAVI =\n(NIR −\
    \ G)\nNIR + G + 0.16\n(8)\nMSAVI = 0.5[2(NIR + 1) −\nq\n(2NIR + 1)2 − 8(NIR −\
    \ R)]\n(9)\n3.2.4. NR and NG:\nNormalized Red (NR) and Normalized Green (NG) are\
    \ two other famous vegetation indices being\nused in PA [33]. NR focuses on the\
    \ part of spectrum where radiation is absorbed by chlorophyll, while\nNG focuses\
    \ on the part of the spectrum where radiation is absorbed by other pigments, excluding\n\
    chlorophyll. NR and NG are computed by Equations (10) and (11):\nNR =\nR\nNIR\
    \ + R + G\n(10)\nNG =\nG\nNIR + R + G\n(11)\n4. Wireless Sensor Network Applications\
    \ in Agriculture\nMultiple applications of wireless sensor networks are being\
    \ utilized today in the agriculture sector.\nSome very common applications are\
    \ smart irrigation, smart fertilization, smart pest control and green\nhouse monitoring.\n\
    4.1. Smart Irrigation Systems\nSmart irrigation is an artiﬁcial irrigation application\
    \ that controls the quantity of water by making\na decision about where water\
    \ is needed. It is the most signiﬁcant constituent in agriculture, which has\n\
    a great impact on crops’ health, cost and productivity. One major aspect of smart\
    \ irrigation is to avoid\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n12 of 25\nthe wastage of water\
    \ since most countries in the world are facing water scarcity problems. A smart\n\
    irrigation system was presented in [34] in which a Raspberry Pi was used along\
    \ with two sensors:\na soil moisture sensor was used to assess the water level\
    \ in the soil, while a temperature and humidity\nsensor was used to monitor the\
    \ environmental condition. The Raspberry Pi was connected to these\nsensors and\
    \ the water supply network. A mobile application was developed for remote monitoring\n\
    and remote water ﬂow control enabling both manual and automatic water ﬂow control.\
    \ In automatic\nmode, water ﬂow was automatically turned ON/OFF based on the water\
    \ level of the soil without\nhuman intervention. In manual mode, the user was\
    \ able to monitor the soil moisture level. An alert\nwas generated when the water\
    \ level of soil was getting below a speciﬁc threshold, and the user turned\nit\
    \ ON/OFF using a mobile application.\nPower is a big concern in IoT-based platforms,\
    \ so many researchers have developed power-\nefﬁcient systems. A power-efﬁcient\
    \ water irrigation system was presented using solar power [35]\nin which the controller\
    \ was connected to the soil sensor and water supply valve. The water valve\nwas\
    \ turned ON/OFF based on the water level monitored by the moisture sensor. The\
    \ power was\nsupplied by the solar panel, so the system was independent of any\
    \ external power module. Another\nsensor-based IoT system for water irrigation\
    \ was presented in [36] in which the controller controlled\nthe opening and closing\
    \ of a solenoid valve based on the water level of the soil. In addition, a series\
    \ of\nweather alerts were sent to the user via a mobile application to update\
    \ the temperature and humidity of\nthe environment, which had a direct inﬂuence\
    \ on the water level of the soil. In [37], an energy-efﬁcient\nirrigation system\
    \ for cultivated crops was presented using a wireless sensor network in which\
    \ water\nwas effectively controlled based on environmental conditions. This system\
    \ estimated the quantity of\nwater needed for normal irrigation based on the humidity,\
    \ temperature and wind speed collected by\nsensors along with historical data.\n\
    In [38], an IoT-based irrigation system was presented using soil moisture sensors\
    \ controlled by\nATMEGA 328P on an Arduino UNO board along with a GPRS module.\
    \ The data collected from the\nsensors were sent to the cloud, i.e., Things Speak,\
    \ where graphs were generated to visualize the data\ntrends. A web portal was\
    \ also designed where the farmer was able to check the status of water, if it\n\
    was ON/OFF. Similarly, a real-time prototype for an irrigation system was presented\
    \ in [39] in which\nsoil moisture sensors and soil temperature sensors were used\
    \ to assess the water status of the soil.\nRFID was used to transmit data to the\
    \ cloud for further data analysis. Using ATMEGA 328, a water\nsprinkler system\
    \ for smart irrigation was presented in [40] using temperature, humidity and soil\n\
    moisture sensors. The water sprinkler was controlled based on the soil moisture\
    \ level to save water\nand reduce human effort. In [41], a cost-effective drip\
    \ irrigation system for a home was proposed in\nwhich a Raspberry Pi, Arduino,\
    \ electronic water control valve and relay were used. ZigBee protocols\nwere used\
    \ for communication. The user turned ON/OFF the water valve by sending commands\
    \ to the\nRaspberry Pi, which further processed the commands through the Arduino.\n\
    The sensors placement is a big issue that affects the accuracy of sensors. A detailed\
    \ discussion of\nsoil moisture positioning in the ﬁeld and their accuracy was\
    \ presented in [42]. For real-time irrigation\nsystems, complete software and\
    \ hardware requirements, problems and challenges and advantages\nwere discussed\
    \ in [43] where a big picture of the complete system was provided.\n4.2. Smart\
    \ Fertilization System\nFertilizer is an artiﬁcial or natural substance having\
    \ some chemical elements used to enhance\nthe growth and productivity of plants.\
    \ Manual spraying is a common technique used for fertilization.\nHowever, the\
    \ optimal way of fertilization requires sensing capabilities to ﬁnd the exact\
    \ place where\nfertilizer is needed, which chemical components are missing and\
    \ the amount of fertilizer needed.\nIt is important to provide fertilizers in\
    \ a very precise amount in order to improve productivity [44].\nMultiple fertilization\
    \ techniques have been presented by researchers since the last decade using WSN\n\
    and IoT.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n13 of 25\nAn automated fertilization system\
    \ was presented in [45] using real-time sensors to measure the\nsoil fertility.\
    \ The system consisted of three modules including input, output and decision support.\n\
    The decision support module measured the optimal amount of fertilizers needed\
    \ for the growth of the\nplants based on the real-time sensory data captured by\
    \ the sensors. A mechanical sensor named the\n“Pendulum Meter” was introduced\
    \ in [46], which was used for optimal fertilization. This sensor was\nmounted\
    \ on the tractor to measure the density of the crop, so the corresponding fertilizer\
    \ spreader\nwas controlled based on the readings of this sensor. The IEEE 802.11\
    \ Wi-Fi module was used for\ncommunication along with GPS. Real-time data of soil\
    \ were collected by several sensors, i.e., soil\nmoisture, temperature, conductivity,\
    \ NO2, CO2, etc. A Geographical Information System (GIS) server\nwas used to interpolate\
    \ sensory data.\n4.3. Smart Pest Control and Early Disease Detection System\n\
    Pest attacks are the root cause of low productivity in the agriculture sector.\
    \ These pests result in\nseveral serious diseases in plants that affect the plant’s\
    \ growth. However, disease prediction provides\nearly warning to the farmers,\
    \ which enables them to make appropriate decisions to control the disease\non\
    \ time. Pest control systems are comprised of electronic devices that enable humans\
    \ to identify traps\nin a speciﬁc range of these electronic devices [47]. These\
    \ electronic devices are sensors capable of\ncalculating the environmental parameters\
    \ for further analysis.\nMuch research has been done in the agriculture sector\
    \ for early disease detection and pest control\nsystems using more advanced and\
    \ sophisticated technologies [48,49]. Multiple imagery sensors have\nbeen used\
    \ by different researchers to collect imagery data, such as: RGB sensors, ﬂuorescence\
    \ imagery\nsensors, spectral sensors and thermal sensors [50]. The thermal sensors\
    \ are used to measure the water\nstatus in the plant by measuring the temperature,\
    \ since this parameter has a direct inﬂuence on the\nwater level in the plants.\
    \ RGB images have three colour channels, i.e., red, green and blue, which\ncan\
    \ be used to perceive the biometric effect in the plants. Multi- and hyper-spectral\
    \ sensors capture\nimages containing the spatial information of objects in multiple\
    \ wavebands. The spatial resolution is\ndependent on the distance between the\
    \ object and the sensor. That is why satellite images contain less\nspatial resolution\
    \ as compared to low altitude platforms such as drones. The ﬂuorescence sensors\
    \ are\nused to distinguish the photosynthetic activities in the plants. Various\
    \ image processing techniques\nare applied to these imagery data to identify the\
    \ diseases in plants.\nIn [50], an IoT-based plants disease and pest prediction\
    \ system was presented to minimize the\nexcessive use of fungicides and insecticides.\
    \ Weather condition monitoring sensors, i.e., temperature,\ndew, humidity and\
    \ wind speed, are used to monitor weather parameters to ﬁnd a correlation between\n\
    pest growth with weather. The sensors have been deployed in orchards, and data\
    \ collected from these\nsensors are sent to the cloud. The farmer is informed\
    \ about the alarming condition of the pest attack\non the crops.\nFrom a different\
    \ point of view, hyper-spectral images are used to analyse crops’ health and pest\n\
    attack using manned or unmanned vehicles on which spectral cameras are mounted.\
    \ The captured\nimages are analysed in depth using machine learning techniques\
    \ to identify the disease in the plants.\nAdvance Neural Networks (ANNs) are more\
    \ common for processing imagery data due to their ability\nto learn complex structures\
    \ and patterns. Using hyper-spectral images, a system was presented [51] to\n\
    identify disease or pest attack in crops. The proposed system for disease detection\
    \ used an ANN with\nmultiple layers.\nEarly disease detection in sugar beet plants\
    \ was presented in [52]. For early detection, four\nsupervised classiﬁcation algorithms\
    \ were applied on spectral images. Spectral images were then\ncollected for each\
    \ image, and multiple vegetation indices were calculated to be used in predictive\n\
    and perspective analysis. The vegetation indices used were NVDI, SR, SIPI, PSSRaand\
    \ PSSRb, ARI,\nREP, mCAIand RRE. These vegetation indices values were used as\
    \ features in the dataset. Support\nVector Machine (SVM), ANN, and decision tree\
    \ were used for classiﬁcation. A comparative analysis\nwas performed which, showed\
    \ that SVM outperformed other classiﬁers for disease detection with an\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 3796\n14 of 25\naccuracy of 97.12%. In [53], a data mining technique\
    \ was applied on the already collected dataset of\ntwo types of crops, i.e., wheat\
    \ and paddy (rice), in India. For dimension reduction, Sammon’s mapping\nwas used\
    \ for multi-dimension scaling, i.e., to reduce the dimension also for unsupervised\
    \ learning.\nFor high dimensional data, dimension reduction is required prior\
    \ to performing further data analysis\nfor better data visualization and accuracy,\
    \ since redundant dimensions reduce the effectiveness of\nany data analysis algorithms.\
    \ Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is a very often-used technique\nalong with\
    \ Sammon’s mapping. Data from multi-dimensions were reduced to two or three dimensions.\n\
    Then, the Self-Organized Maps (SOM) algorithm for clustering was used to ﬁnd correlations\
    \ between\nthe data. The accuracy comparison of SOM and Sammon’s mapping was presented,\
    \ which showed\nthat SOM performed better on a large dataset, while Sammon’s mapping\
    \ was suitable for small ones.\nSmart phones played important role in data acquisition,\
    \ which were further used to monitor the crops’\nhealth. In [54], the health of\
    \ wheat crop was monitored using near surface imagery captured by a smart\nphone.\
    \ The crop was classiﬁed as healthy or unhealthy based on the green level by computing\
    \ Gcc.\nMost of the applications in PA have been either IoT-based in which multiple\
    \ sensors are used to\nassess the health of the crop or remote sensing-based in\
    \ which crop health is assessed by performing\nsome computation on spectral images.\
    \ We can compare crop health monitoring application based\non some attributes\
    \ such as which sensors are used in particular applications, whether web or mobile\n\
    services are provided or not, etc. The comparative analysis of some existing crop\
    \ health monitoring\napplications is presented in Table 8 based on some attributes.\n\
    To precisely monitor the crop health, both IoT-based techniques and remote sensing\
    \ techniques\nshould be used together to provide more reliable and accurate information\
    \ about the crop. As a\nproof of concept, we present a case study in which a crop\
    \ health monitoring system based on IoT and\nremote sensing techniques is proposed.\
    \ We provide a complete end-to-end solution in the agriculture\ndomain by facilitating\
    \ the agricultural user with web and mobile services so that he/she could be\n\
    informed about the latest condition of the crop in a timely manner. In this way,\
    \ remedy actions could\nbe performed in time, which will result in enhanced production.\n\

    N\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n16 of 25\n5. A Case Study on UAV-Based and IoT-Based\
    \ Precision Agriculture\nWe developed a complete solution for crop health monitoring\
    \ based on IoT and remote sensing.\nIn the proposed system, crop health is monitored\
    \ using data collected from multiple IoT sensors,\nas well as NDVI mapping of\
    \ spectral images captured by a drone. The architecture of the proposed\nsystem\
    \ is shown in Figure 1, which was designed according to two main modules. The\
    \ ﬁrst module\nwas a wireless sensor network-based system in which multiple wireless\
    \ nodes were developed. Each\nwireless node was comprised of a soil moisture sensor\
    \ used to monitor the water level of the soil,\na soil temperature sensor used\
    \ to check the temperature of the soil and air temperature and humidity\nsensors.\
    \ These nodes were deployed across the ﬁeld in a star topology fashion where the\
    \ master node\ncollected readings from all slave nodes and transmitted the captured\
    \ reading to the back-end server for\nfurther processing. The master node acted\
    \ as a gateway node, which received data from all slave nodes\nusing NRF communication\
    \ module. After performing initial processing, the master node transmitted\nthe\
    \ data to the cloud using GSM communication technology. In the case of the unavailability\
    \ of the\nGSM network, this node stored the captured data and transmitted to the\
    \ cloud upon the availability\nof network.\nThe second module was used to monitor\
    \ crop health using multi-spectral imagery, which was\ncollected by a multi-spectral\
    \ camera mounted on a drone. The NDVI was computed using Equation (1)\nto classify\
    \ between healthy and unhealthy plants by measuring the chlorophyll content in\
    \ the crops,\nwhich was further used to localize the area under stress precisely.\n\
    All collected data were sent to the cloud where further analysis was performed.\
    \ The web portal\nwas designed to help the farmer monitor the crop proﬁle over\
    \ the whole life cycle. Currently, we are\nmonitoring soil moisture, soil temperature,\
    \ air moisture and air temperature readings in real time\nalong with NDVI mapping\
    \ of spectral imagery. Multiple web services were provided on the web\nportal\
    \ including historical/real data visualization using graphs, weather monitoring,\
    \ NDVI mapping\nand the correlation among measured parameters. Figure 2 shows\
    \ the snapshots of the web portal\nalong with different services.\nFigure 1. System\
    \ architecture.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n17 of 25\nFigure 2. User interface of\
    \ the web portal.\nFor portability and remote monitoring, a mobile application\
    \ was also developed to facilitate the\nfarmer/agronomist/landlord with all the\
    \ web services that are available on web portal. The alerts\nare generated when\
    \ an abnormal behaviour is observed in the crop, which help the farmer to take\n\
    remedy actions in a timely manner. The user interfaces of the mobile application\
    \ are shown in Figure 3.\nTherefore, the web portal along with mobile applications\
    \ provides a complete solution, which enables\nagricultural users monitor the\
    \ current status of the crop, as well as previous details.\nFigure 3. User interface\
    \ of the mobile application.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n18 of 25\n6. Results and\
    \ Discussion\n6.1. Analysis of the Data Collected by IoT Nodes\nThe developed\
    \ IoT nodes were deployed across the wheat ﬁelds of an area of 1.4375 hectare.\n\
    The selected area was located in Islamabad, Pakistan. The wheat ﬁelds are shown\
    \ in Figure 4 along\nwith the IoT node and sensors. We deployed the system across\
    \ the wheat ﬁeld in March 2019 when\nwheat was in the grain ﬁlling and grain ripening\
    \ stage.\nFigure 4. System deployed across the wheat ﬁelds.\nWe collected the\
    \ sensors’ readings such as air temperature, air humidity, soil temperature and\n\
    soil moisture. We compared the observed crop parameters with the ideal wheat temperature\
    \ proﬁle\nas shown in Figure 5. Extreme variation in the weather of Islamabad\
    \ was observed in that particular\ntime period, which can be seen by how the actual\
    \ temperature for wheat crop deviated from the ideal\ntemperature proﬁle of the\
    \ wheat crop.\nFigure 5. Deviation of observed temperature from the ideal temperature\
    \ proﬁle.\nAdditionally, we performed linear regression to ﬁnd the correlation\
    \ between observed parameters,\nwhich provided insight into how changes in one\
    \ parameter can effect the other parameter. The linear\nregression found a relation\
    \ between the two parameters by ﬁtting the equation of the line using the\nobserved\
    \ dataset [69]. Equation (12) represents an equation of the line where mrepresents\
    \ the slope of\nline, while c indicates the y-intercept. The variables m and c\
    \ were learned from the data.\ny = mx + c\n(12)\nFigure 6A shows the correlation\
    \ between the observed air temperature and air humidity, which showed\nthat both\
    \ were negatively correlated. The correlation between air temperature and soil\
    \ temperature is\nshown in Figure 6B, which shows that both were positively correlated.\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 3796\n19 of 25\n(A)\n(B)\nFigure 6. (A) Correlation b/wair temperature\
    \ and air humidity. (B) Correlation b/w air temperature\nand soil temperature.\n\
    The rise in air temperature caused the air humidity to reduce, while it resulted\
    \ in an increase in\nsoil temperature and vice versa.\n6.2. Analysis of Multi-spectral\
    \ Images Captured by Drone\nTo collect multi-spectral imagery, we used the DJI-Phantom\
    \ Pro Advanced drone with the Sentera\nMulti-spectral-imaging sensor. The drone\
    \ had its own optical camera, while the multi-spectral camera\nwas mounted on\
    \ it to obtain spectral images. Multiple ﬂights of the drone were carried out\
    \ at the\nspeciﬁc growing stages of the crop, i.e., grain ripening and grain ﬁlling\
    \ stage. After collecting these\nimages, they were transferred to the cloud for\
    \ NDVI mapping. Figure 7A shows the optical image\nthat was captured on 16 May\
    \ 2019 when wheat was in the harvesting stage, while Figure 7B is its\nspectral\
    \ image, and Figure 7C is the NDVI mapping. Since wheat was at a mature stage,\
    \ its NDVI\nshould be very small, i.e., ideally there should be no green region\
    \ in the ﬁeld. However, in NDVI\nmapping, a large green region indicated the abnormal\
    \ behaviour of the crop. The green region was\ndue to naturally growing plants.\
    \ This information can be visualized on the web portal.\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nFigure\
    \ 7. Wheat crop. (A) Optical image; (B) spectral image; (C) NDVI mapping.\nThe\
    \ same process was performed in a maize ﬁeld when maize was in the grain ripening\
    \ stage.\nFigure 8A shows the optical image that was captured on 24 July 2019\
    \ when maize was in the grain\nripening stage, while Figure 8B is its spectral\
    \ image, and Figure 8C is the NDVI mapping. The same\nbehaviour can be observed\
    \ with the maize crop, i.e., there should be a minimal green region in the\nﬁeld.\
    \ However, in NDVI mapping, a large green region indicated the abnormal behaviour\
    \ of the crop.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n20 of 25\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nFigure 8. Maize\
    \ crop. (A) Optical image; (B) spectral image; (C) NDVI mapping.\n7. Challenges\n\
    PA has been used since the last few decades to enhance crops’ yield with reduced\
    \ costs and\nhuman effort, although the adoption of these novel techniques by\
    \ farmers is still very limited owing to\nthe following reasons or challenges.\n\
    7.1. Hardware Cost\nPA relies mostly on hardware such as sensors, wireless nodes,\
    \ drones, spectral imaging sensors,\netc., which are used to assess multiple parameters\
    \ in real time. These sensors have multiple limitations\nincluding high development,\
    \ maintenance and deployment cost. Some systems in PA are cost effective\nand\
    \ are suitable for small arable land, i.e., smart irrigation systems that require\
    \ low-cost hardware\ncomponents and sensors. However, drone-based systems for\
    \ crops’ health monitoring are feasible for\nlarge arable land due to high installation\
    \ cost.\n7.2. Weather Variations\nEnvironmental variation is one of the major\
    \ challenges that affects the accuracy of data collected\nby sensors. Sensor nodes\
    \ deployed in the ﬁeld are sensitive to environmental variations, i.e., rain,\n\
    ﬂuctuation in temperature, wind speed, sun light, etc. Communication between wireless\
    \ nodes\nand the cloud can be interrupted due interference induced in wireless\
    \ communication channels by\natmospheric disturbance. The satellite, air borne\
    \ and drone platforms are also sensitive to weather\nvariations. Imagery acquired\
    \ by these platforms is affected by contamination of clouds and other\nnatural\
    \ aerosols. The development of advanced techniques for atmospheric correction,\
    \ cloud detection\nand noise interpolation is a current open challenge, which\
    \ requires hard efforts from the research\ncommunity.\n7.3. Data Management\n\
    The sensors in PA constantly generate data. To ensure the integrity of data, some\
    \ data security\nmeasures needs to be in place, which will in turn enhance the\
    \ cost of the system. The readings from\nthe sensors have to be accurate in order\
    \ to take appropriate actions precisely when and where required.\nAn intruder\
    \ can corrupt the readings, and false readings will adversely reduce the effectiveness\
    \ of\nthe system. PA systems generate immense amounts of data, which require enough\
    \ resources to\nperform data analysis. Real-time data collected from sensors deployed\
    \ across the ﬁelds after a few\nminutes and spectral imagery acquired from high-altitude\
    \ or low-altitude platforms produce the bulk\nof the data, which increase the\
    \ storage and processing requirements. New software platforms and\nfacilities\
    \ for scalable management of Big Data sources are demanded. In this regard, the\
    \ generation\nof software-as-a-service solutions is focused on merging data management\
    \ and IoT thorough cloud\ncomputing platforms.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n21 of\
    \ 25\n7.4. Literacy Rate\nLiteracy is an important factor that inﬂuences the adoption\
    \ ratio in PA. In developing countries\nwhere the illiteracy rate is high, farmers\
    \ grow crops based on their experience. They do not utilize the\nstate-of-the-art\
    \ technologies in agriculture, which results in loss of production. Farmers need\
    \ to be\neducated in order to understand the technology or they have to trust\
    \ a third party for technical support.\nTherefore, in underdeveloped areas where\
    \ the literacy rate is not high, PA is not very common due to\nthe limitations\
    \ of resources and education.\n7.5. Connectivity\nNext-generation 5G networks\
    \ can be 100-times faster than 4G ones, making communication\nbetween devices\
    \ and servers much quicker. 5G can also carry much more data than other networks,\n\
    which makes it an ideal technology for transmitting information from remote sensors\
    \ and drones, key\ntools that are being tested in PA environments. The adoption\
    \ of new communication networks based\non 5G is a must in current applications\
    \ where secure and rapid data transfer enables real-time data\nmanagement and\
    \ support for decision making.\n7.6. Interoperability\nOne of the biggest problems\
    \ PA faces is the interoperability of equipment due to different digital\nstandards.\
    \ This lack of interoperability is not only obstructing the adoption of new IoT\
    \ technologies\nand slowing down their growth, but it also inhibits the gain of\
    \ production efﬁciency through smart\nagriculture applications. New methods and\
    \ protocols to integrate different machine communication\nstandards to unlock\
    \ the potential of efﬁcient machine-to-machine communication and data sharing\n\
    between machines and management information systems are required in the current\
    \ scenario of PA.\n8. Conclusion and Future Directions\nPrecision agriculture\
    \ is a modern practice used to enhance crops’ productivity using latest\ntechnologies,\
    \ i.e., WSN, IoT, cloud computing, Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning\n\
    (ML). Most of the research done so far indicates that PA-based practices have\
    \ a great inﬂuence on\nsustainability and productivity. The objective of PA is\
    \ to provide decision support systems based\non multiple parameters of crops,\
    \ i.e., soil nutrients, water level of the soil, wind speed, intensity of\nsunlight,\
    \ temperature, humidity, chlorophyll content, etc. However, several challenges\
    \ are involved\nin the development and deployment phase of these systems. This\
    \ article was aimed at providing a\nsurvey of modern technologies involving current\
    \ PA platforms, with the goal of supporting industry\nand research communities\
    \ on the development of modern applications for smart agriculture. A case\nstudy\
    \ was presented to prove the effectiveness of the PA in the agriculture domain.\n\
    Since the main objective of precision agriculture is to produce surplus yield\
    \ by optimizing the\nresources such as water, pesticides, fertilizers, etc., for\
    \ resource optimization, prescription maps play\nan important role, which enables\
    \ farmers to quantify resources required for healthy crops at any\nparticular\
    \ growth stage. Most of the research accomplished in the agriculture domain focuses\
    \ on the\nremote sensing platforms to collect imagery, which reﬂects only Vegetation\
    \ Indices (VIs) such as NDVI.\nThe prescription maps cannot be generated by only\
    \ using VIs; instead, multiple other factors need to\nbe considered such as soil\
    \ properties, soil moisture level, meteorological behaviour, etc.\nFunding: This\

    • The role of Internet of Things in arable farming is reviewed. • Internet of
    Things is leading arable farming to become data-driven. • Implementation and application
    are described in depth. • Challenges, corresponding solutions and potentials are
    discussed thoroughly. The Internet of Things is allowing agriculture, here specifically
    arable farming, to become data-driven, leading to more timely and cost-effective
    production and management of farms, and at the same time reducing their environmental
    impact. This review is addressing an analytical survey of the current and potential
    application of Internet of Things in arable farming, where spatial data, highly
    varying environments, task diversity and mobile devices pose unique challenges
    to be overcome compared to other agricultural systems. The review contributes
    an overview of the state of the art of technologies deployed. It provides an outline
    of the current and potential applications, and discusses the challenges and possible
    solutions and implementations. Lastly, it presents some future directions for
    the Internet of Things in arable farming. Current issues such as smart phones,
    intelligent management of Wireless Sensor Networks, middleware platforms, integrated
    Farm Management Information Systems across the supply chain, or autonomous vehicles
    and robotics stand out because of their potential to lead arable farming to smart
    arable farming. During the implementation, different challenges are encountered,
    and here interoperability is a key major hurdle throughout all the layers in the
    architecture of an Internet of Things system, which can be addressed by shared
    standards and protocols. Challenges such as affordability, device power consumption,
    network latency, Big Data analysis, data privacy and security, among others, have
    been identified by the articles reviewed and are discussed in detail. Different
    solutions to all identified challenges are presented addressing technologies such
    as machine learning, middleware platforms, or intelligent data management. Previous

    The global population and its food consumption are growing alarmingly quickly,
    while climate change effects are simultaneously complicating the challenge of
    ensuring food security in a sustainable manner (Godfray et al., 2010, Tilman et
    al., 2011). Data-driven agriculture is one of the main strategies and concepts
    proposed to increase production efficiently while decreasing its environmental
    impact (Foley et al., 2011). Data-driven technologies in general are quickly advancing
    with the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), and may become an important
    part of the future of farming (Brewster et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2016,
    Verdouw, 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Smart Farming, also called Agriculture 4.0
    or digital farming (CEMA, 2017), is developing beyond the modern concept of precision
    agriculture, which bases its management practices on spatial measurements largely
    thanks to Global Positioning System (GPS) signals. Smart farming bases its management
    tasks also on spatial data but is enhanced with context-awareness and is activated
    by real-time events, improving the performance of hitherto precision agriculture
    solutions (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Additionally, Smart
    Farming usually incorporates intelligent services for applying and managing Information
    and Communication Technologies (ICT) in farming, and allows transverse integration
    throughout the whole agri-food chain in regards to food safety and traceability
    (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). IoT is therefore a key technology in smart farming
    since it ensures data flow between sensors and other devices, making it possible
    to add value to the obtained data by automatic processing, analysis and access,
    and this leads to more timely and cost-effective production and management effort
    on farms. Simultaneously, IoT enables the reduction of the inherent environmental
    impact by real-time reaction to alert events such as weed, pest or disease detection,
    weather or soil monitoring warnings, which allow for a reduction and adequate
    use of inputs such as agrochemicals or water. IoT eases documentation and supervision
    of different activities as well as the traceability of products, improving the
    environmental surveying and control in farms by the appropriate authorities. The
    IoT concept was introduced by Kevin Ashton in 1999 in relation to linking Radio-Frequency
    Identification (RFID) for supply chains to the internet (Ashton, 2009), but has
    no official definition. It implies, however, the connection of a network of “things”
    to or through the internet without direct human intervention. “Things” can be
    any object with sensors and/or actuators that is uniquely addressable, interconnected
    and accessible through the world-wide computer network, i.e. the Internet. The
    application of IoT in agriculture is advantageous because of the possibility to
    monitor and control many different parameters in an interoperable, scalable and
    open context with an increasing use of heterogeneous automated components (Kamilaris,
    Gao, Prenafeta-Boldu, & Ali, 2016), in addition to the inevitable requirement
    for traceability. As a result of IoT, agriculture is becoming data-driven, i.e.
    making informed real-time decisions for managing the farm, reducing uncertainties
    and inefficiencies, and as a consequence reducing its environmental impact. The
    application of IoT in agriculture, also called Ag-IoT (Zhai, 2017), AIoT (Zou
    & Quan, 2017), or IoF meaning Internet of Farming (Alahmadi, Alwajeeh, Mohanan,
    & Budiarto, 2017) or Internet of Food and Farm (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), has received exponentially increasing attention in the scientific
    community (Fig. 1). Even though the publications are mainly dominated by Asian
    scientists (Talavera et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016), in Europe several large scale
    international pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019), are aiming to implement IoT technologies in the agricultural
    industry in Europe. Similar projects elsewhere include the Accelerating Precision
    Agriculture to Decision Agriculture (P2D) project in Australia (Zhang, Baker,
    Jakku, & Llewellyn, 2017), which complement additional major investments with
    the aim to help farmers convert to smart farming (Higgins et al., 2017, Pham and
    Stack, 2018). Download : Download high-res image (95KB) Download : Download full-size

    searching criteria: (Internet of things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    Several reviews have been done on IoT in agriculture in the relatively short time
    period in which publications about the subject have emerged (Ray, 2017, Stočes
    et al., 2016, Talavera et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). In
    addition, review papers have been published with a focus on specific subjects
    related to IoT applied in agriculture, such as Big Data (Kamilaris et al., 2017,
    Wolfert et al., 2017), modelling (O''Grady & O''Hare, 2017), Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) (Jawad, Nordin, Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail, 2017), food supply chain (Ramundo,
    Taisch, & Terzi, 2016), Internet of Underground Things (Vuran, Salam, Wong, &
    Irmak, 2018), chemical wireless sensors (Kassal, Steinberg, & Murkovi, 2018),
    or Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS) (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015;
    Kaloxylos et al., 2012). However, to the authors'' knowledge, no existing review
    has focused on arable farming, which has specific characteristics and challenges
    that differ from those in a controlled environment, i.e. greenhouses, or permanent
    crops such as fruit orchards. Arable farming poses particular challenges due to:
    • much larger farm sizes, which affect the design of the sensor networks, the
    data processing, analysis and extrapolation of limited stationary sensor data,
    and the consequent decision making with regards to actuators, vehicle logistics,
    etc.; • the larger farm sizes also imply that spatial data has a central role
    in arable farming, affecting the data processing, decision making and precision
    machinery employed to address in-field variability not at plant level as in most
    permanent crops, but at subfield level with automatic recognition and actuation
    (Zude-Sasse, Fountas, Gemtos, & Abu-Khalaf, 2016); • greater use of mobile sensors
    and other devices on vehicles, which have specific challenges. While other cropping
    systems may also use sensors and devices on operating machinery, arable farming
    often requires a fleet of vehicles to operate in a co-ordinated fashion. This
    creates issues particularly regarding network infrastructure (Martínez, Pastor,
    Álvarez, & Iborra, 2016), e.g. connectivity to the cloud of moving things that
    rely mainly on mobile networks, or vehicle to implement communication, which implies
    real-time interoperability between machines and devices from different manufacturers
    (Peets, Mouazen, Blackburn, Kuang, & Wiebensohn, 2012); • larger amounts of heterogeneous
    spatial data generated at different rates and from very disparate sources: stationary
    sensors, moving vehicles and implements, satellites, data from web services, etc.,
    which need to be intelligently integrated; • highly varying and uncertain environmental
    conditions, as annual crops are more susceptible to weather changes and other
    external factors than permanent crops, which are more resilient mainly due to
    their deeper roots (Zude-Sasse et al., 2016), or crops in controlled environments.
    This obligates the IoT system to handle both spatial and temporal data, increasing
    the complexity of the data processing as well as the decisions based on the data
    collected. • more diverse types of field tasks per growing season in arable farming,
    from soil preparation and crop establishment, through highly varying plant nursing
    tasks, to coordinated harvest, which increase the complexity and also the risks.
    The IoT in agriculture is a fast-developing field, which can make reviews obsolete
    quickly. This challenge can be overcome by focussing a critical view on the general
    principles, main application areas and identify the limitations and challenges.
    Summarising, the aim of the paper is to provide an up to date novel analytical
    review of the role of IoT in arable farming, with the following specific objectives:
    • Provide an overview of the current situation of IoT technologies deployed in
    arable farming. Focussing on the current use of communication technologies and
    protocols, the generation and analysis of data, and IoT architectures. • Outline
    the different applications and capabilities of IoT in arable farming. • Investigate
    the main challenges encountered by IoT enabling technologies applied to arable
    farming. • Present key potential fields of application where IoT could be employed,
    as well as future directions of the current trends. The remaining part of this
    paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the methodology used in this
    review paper. Section 3 provides an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies
    used in arable farming; Section 4 presents an outline of the current and potential
    IoT-based applications in arable farming; Section 5 discusses the challenges and
    solutions found in its implementation; and lastly, the review closes with Section
    6 in which future directions are summarised. 2. Review methodology In order to
    address the specific objectives identified above, the literature listing from
    the SCOPUS database of the last 11 years has been reviewed. More precisely, the
    timeframe investigated was from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2018, selected as
    the whole period in which any literature about the subject turned up in the studied
    database. SCOPUS was selected as the primary literature source as it is a key
    peer-reviewed research literature database. The specific keywords used in the
    search criteria where: (Internet of Things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    To ease the searching process, the keywords needed to be present in at least the
    title, abstract, highlights or keywords. Additionally, the articles had to be
    published in English. Articles concerning greenhouse, livestock or permanent crops
    were excluded from the survey, as were supply chain related articles. However,
    issues concerning traceability at farm level were included. The survey was performed
    in a systematic manner following three steps (see Fig. 2): • Firstly, a list of
    1193 articles meeting the search criteria mentioned above was retrieved from the
    database. • In the second step, by reading the titles, any article that was clearly
    not related to arable farming was excluded, leaving a list of 293 articles. •
    In the last step, a second screening was made by reading the abstracts, where
    articles outside the focus of this review were omitted. After this step, 167 articles
    were studied in detail, from which 69 articles were considered relevant, 27 as
    partially relevant, while the rest were considered of little relevance. Relevance
    concerned mainly the connection of the article to the subject studied. The content
    of a relevant article directly addresses the application of an IoT technology
    in an arable farming scenario. A partially relevant article studies a certain
    IoT technology in agriculture in a broader sense. In the distinction made regarding
    little relevant articles included off-topic, lack of novelty, as well as non-peer-reviewed
    articles that lacked scientific rigour, e.g. ambiguous information or absence
    of materials or methods description. Download : Download high-res image (208KB)

    The final 167 articles studied included: 77 journal papers, 88 conference papers
    and 4 book chapters, of which 19 were review papers. The final list of articles
    was complemented with other publications that expanded on some of the IoT related
    subjects and technologies mentioned in the studied articles, and did not contain
    the specified keywords. These were found by a targeted search for specific subjects.
    Lastly, in each article from the final list a special focus was made on the IoT
    technologies employed, the applications, the challenges encountered and, finally,
    on potential future perspectives. 3. IoT implementation in arable farming IoT
    has recently been gaining momentum in the farming industry as it can fulfil the
    urgent necessity for interoperability across brands, scalability and traceability
    (Kamilaris et al., 2016). Different technologies are implemented as IoT is still
    evolving, adapting to a great diversity of uses. To cover the range of technologies,
    protocols, standards, etc. employed, this review is addressing the layers in the
    IoT architecture. Three layers normally describe the architecture of the IoT in
    the literature reviewed (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Khattab et al., 2016,
    Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Na and Isaac, 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw,
    2016), though some authors divide it into more layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Ramundo et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Talavera et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2014),
    depending on their definitions. More than three layers can especially be relevant
    in IoT systems with edge or fog computing, where an edge/fog computing layer can
    be considered in between the device and network layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016). Even though the naming of the layers also varies depending on the author,
    there is nonetheless a general trend to divide the layers into device, network
    and application layers (Fig. 3). Thus, this has been the adapted structure in
    this review. The device layer consists of the physical objects (things) that are
    capable of automatic identification, sensing or actuation, and connection to the
    internet. The network layer communicates the data to a gateway (or proxy server)
    to the internet (cloud) by the use of communication protocols. And the application
    layer typically stores and facilitates access for the end-user to the processed/analysed
    information. Download : Download high-res image (222KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. IoT architecture represented by device, network and application
    layer, in which the middleware platform is not always present. The collected data
    experience diverse stages during their transition from sensors to cloud, interfaces,
    and occasionally actuators, and these stages have considerable influence on the
    technologies applied in an IoT context. Six main stages regarding data flow have
    been identified in the literature reviewed: sensing/perception, communication/transport/transfer,
    storage, processing, analytics, and actuation and display (Fig. 4). The order
    of the stages is different depending on the IoT setup employed and the computing
    techniques used, e.g. fog and edge computing processes the data before communicating
    it to the cloud, an example of its application in precision farming is given by
    Ferrández-Pastor et al. (2016); while cloud computing processes the data in the
    cloud, examples of this are given by Hernandez-Rojas, Mazon-Olivo, Novillo-Vicuña,
    and Belduma-Vacacela (2018) and Na and Isaac (2016). Nonetheless, sensing/perception
    is normally the first stage, where data are captured by sensors, then the data
    can follow different paths and does not necessarily go through all the steps listed.
    In summary, IoT data is identified to be gathered or generated through three main
    processes: machine generated, which come from sensing devices; process-mediated,
    i.e. commercial data coming from business processes; and human-sourced, recorded
    by humans and digitalised later on (Balducci, Impedovo, Informatica, & Moro, 2018).
    These different sources have an influence on how to process, analyse and use the
    data in IoT solutions, and this needs to be taken into account in the overall
    data acquisition planning process. Download : Download high-res image (171KB)

    in arable farming. 3.1. Device layer As mentioned above, the device layer consists
    of the physical objects (things) that are capable of automatic identification,
    sensing or actuating, and providing connection to the internet. Sensor devices
    measure and collect one or more parameters automatically and transmit the data
    wirelessly to the cloud. And, when the devices become actuators, they generally,
    in turn, receive data from the cloud in order to activate or deactivate some mechanical
    component, e.g. a valve in an irrigation system. The device layer is also often
    called perception layer (Tzounis et al., 2017, Zou and Quan, 2017), sensing layer
    (Na and Isaac, 2016, Wang et al., 2014), or physical layer (Ramundo et al., 2016,
    Talavera et al., 2017). The devices are constituted of a transceiver, a microcontroller,
    an interfacing circuit and one or more sensors and/or actuators. The sensor measures
    a physical parameter, e.g. air temperature that is interpreted and transformed
    into an equivalent analogue signal, i.e. electric voltage or current, which is
    then converted by the interfacing circuit, i.e. Analogue-to-Digital Converter
    (ADC), into a corresponding digital format. Afterwards, the microcontroller, sometimes
    also in the form of microprocessors or single-board computers (Talavera et al.,
    2017), collects the data in digital format from one or more sensors through the
    ADC, and sends them to the transceiver, i.e. a wireless communication module,
    which communicates the data to a gateway. A comparison of microcontrollers and
    single-board computers used in IoT in agriculture has been made by Ray (2017).
    In the case of edge computing, the microcontroller or single-board computer processes
    the data from one or more sensors before communicating them, with the intention
    of, for example, reducing the amount of data to be transferred to the cloud and
    accelerating the data processing (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et
    al., 2016). In fog computing the data are processed in the local area network
    level, i.e. in a fog node or IoT gateway (Ahmed, Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed,
    De et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018). When employing an actuator, the
    signal is received by the transceiver, communicated to the microcontroller, where
    it is then converted to analogue signal by a Digital-to-Analogue Converter (DAC),
    i.e. the interfacing circuit, or to a digital signal by a Digital-to-Digital Converter,
    and finally interpreted by the actuator, which acts in accordance to the signal
    received. In arable farming, when agricultural machinery data are used, i.e. data
    from sensors and devices mounted on tractors or other agricultural machinery,
    the data in digital format is normally collected and accessible through the Controller
    Area Network (CAN) bus in the machine, although in some cases some data are accessible
    through other ports (Oksanen et al., 2016, Peets et al., 2012). Machine and operator
    performance information is accessible through the Machine and Implement Control
    System (MICS) of the machine, which can also be accessed through the CAN bus data.
    MICS data are used to allow machinery operators and farm managers to monitor and
    potentially improve the efficiency of their machines, by employing e.g. smart
    alerts or recommendation systems (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015). Global Navigation Satellite
    System (GNSS) data, e.g. Real Time Kinematics GPS (RTK-GPS), are often also available
    through the CAN bus port, which allows, among others, vehicle monitoring and dynamic
    optimised route planning Edwards et al., 2017, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018. Many
    different sensors and actuators are employed in arable farming. The type of device
    used depends on the purpose of the system in addition to the technologies implemented
    in the system. And the number of devices is steadily increasing. The number of
    IoT device installations in farms is expected to increase globally from 30 million
    installations in 2015 to 75 million in 2020. Furthermore, data points generated
    per day and farm are expected to increase from 190000 in 2014 to over half a million
    by 2020 (Meola, 2016). It was also estimated that by 2018 there would be 10 billion
    IoT devices employed in agriculture. However, the great amount of data generated
    is often unused or underutilised (Bennett, 2015), e.g. in countries like Denmark
    with a relative high ICT adoption in farms, in 2016 only 2–5% of farmers worked
    actively with the data generated (SEGES, 2016). Even if data usage is still relatively
    low, it is expected to increase rapidly (Bennett, 2015, Wolfert et al., 2017,
    World Bank, 2017) An overview about how they are implemented for different purposes
    is presented in the Applications section. 3.2. Network layer The network layer
    communicates the data initially to an intermediary platform and eventually to
    the internet (cloud), and from there to, for example, employed actuators. When
    the data are transferred to the intermediary platform, it typically uses wireless
    communication technologies, for instance RFID, WSN with Zigbee, LoRa (Long Range),
    etc., and more recently Near-Field Communication (NFC) (Kassal et al., 2018, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). The intermediary platform
    is normally an internet gateway located in the vicinity of the connected devices,
    also including sometimes a proxy server, where the data are collected and occasionally
    processed in order to send the information further to the end user through the
    internet by the use of e.g. MQTT standards, or HTML or XMPP protocols. The use
    of Android smart devices or other operating systems is also increasing in popularity
    among agricultural applications, as they can be employed as a gateway for 3G and
    4G networks, and they frequently include other wireless communication technologies,
    e.g. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPRS and NFC. They also automatically conform to communication
    standards and protocols, in which way interoperability is increased (Balmos et
    al., 2016, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Gao and Yao, 2016, Hernandez-Rojas et
    al., 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). In addition, Android and other smart
    devices can include GNSS and RGB camera sensors, and can relatively easily be
    programmed for computing data and displaying Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications
    being able to straightforwardly update the software if necessary. In that manner,
    Android and similar smart devices are represented in all three IoT layers, i.e.
    sensing in the device layer, node or gateway in the network layer, and computing
    data and displaying GUI in the application layer. Furthermore, the automatic software
    updating possibilities of smart devices allow remote installation of updates with
    new functionalities, bug fixes, etc. and easily improve the interoperability of
    the system (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). Many different wireless technologies
    have been applied for diverse purposes in agriculture, depending on economic,
    accessibility and capability factors. Jawad et al., 2017, Ray, 2017 and Tzounis
    et al. (2017) have presented good overviews of the specifications of wireless
    communication technologies implemented in IoT in an agricultural context, which
    have been here collected in Table 1 and complemented with information from other
    relevant articles (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Elijah et al., 2018, Kassal et al.,
    2018, Sinha et al., 2017, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). The great variety of technologies,
    standards and frequency bands used exposes the relevant interoperability and application
    challenges found when applying IoT technologies. Potential communication standards
    for smart farming can be classified into short-range and long-range according
    to their communication distance, which determines their specific usability in
    different requirement settings. This is particularly the case in arable farming,
    where mobile network accessibility can be an issue in many rural areas, and where
    large farm sizes limit the use of some wireless technologies due to their reduced
    communication distance and due to the necessity to replace/recharge device batteries
    on nodes over large areas. These issues are addressed in the challenges section
    later. Table 1. Wireless communication technologies (adapted from Jawad et al.,

    m 1 mW a Not yet publicly available. A WSN is formed by pervasive devices called
    motes or sensor nodes, which integrate sensors and actuators that communicate
    wirelessly forming a spatial network (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). In a WSN, base stations act as gateways forwarding
    the data to the cloud. Different communication technologies support different
    network node architectures, e.g. star, tree or mesh. Depending on the application,
    different wireless communication technologies are employed in a WSN as each has
    different node architecture possibilities, data rates, ranges, standards, among
    others, with the use of ZigBee, LoRa, Bluetooth/BLE, WiFi and SigFox being relatively
    common in agriculture. In arable farming, BLE has for example been employed for
    soil and air monitoring and irrigation control (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018);
    ZigBee was used in a WSN for monitoring soil conditions and actuating an irrigation
    system (Mafuta et al., 2012) and crop monitoring (Zhai, 2017); and LoRa for air
    and water temperature of rice paddy fields (Tanaka, 2018) and smart irrigation
    control (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018). In order to cover
    larger distances, GPRS is appropriate and has been used for irrigation control
    (López-Riquelme et al., 2017), and for remote maintenance of machinery (Miettinen,
    Oksanen, Suomi, & Visala, 2006). GPRS, or other technologies, such as LTE, or
    3G/4G, are also commonly used at the gateway to transmit data to the cloud. Regarding
    other less common communication technologies used in WSNs, RFID can be integrated
    into a WSN too by connecting the RFID tag readers to a radio-frequency transceiver
    (Costa et al., 2013). Passive and active RFID technologies are used to a great
    extent in agricultural research and industry (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), especially
    for animal production (e.g. Kamilaris et al., 2016), as well as vegetable or fruit
    product traceability (e.g. Kodali, Jain, & Karagwal, 2017); however, in arable
    farming only few examples have been found: e.g. RFID tags used for irrigation
    scheduling (Vellidis, Tucker, Perry, Kvien, & Bednarz, 2008), for agrochemical
    traceability (Peets, Gasparin, Blackburn, & Godwin, 2009), for vehicle monitoring
    (Sjolander, Thomasson, Sui, & Ge, 2011), and even on a prototype for soil temperature
    monitoring (Hamrita & Hoffacker, 2005). Regarding NFC, no concrete examples of
    NFC used in arable farming have been found in the literature reviewed. Finally,
    the latest generation of mobile communications, i.e. 5G, has higher data rates,
    large coverage areas, higher peak throughput, and also improved flexibility, which
    can open new possibilities and may solve some of the challenges encountered by
    many IoT solutions (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Marsch et al., 2016). 5G allows new
    options for monitoring rural areas with no previous infrastructure for Internet
    connection (Faraci, Raciti, Rizzo, & Schembra, 2018). 5G can also improve vehicle-to-vehicle
    or vehicle-to-anything communication in e.g. logistics solutions, due to its low
    latency and new frequency bands (Marsch et al., 2016). A challenge for the 5G
    networks will be the great increase in devices to support once IoT becomes a standard
    solution not only in agriculture, but also in any sphere of everyday life. 3.3.
    Application layer The application layer is crucial in an IoT context as it is
    this layer that actually adds value to the sensed and communicated data through
    directly controlling devices, supporting farmers'' decision making, etc. In this
    layer, several important services occur such as data storage, data analytics,
    data access through an appropriate Application Programming Interface (API), as
    well as possibly a user interfaced software application. The layer may also include
    middleware platforms that aid handling the heterogeneous cloud data improving
    interoperability. Data storage can be cloud based, i.e. on multiple servers, or
    more local based, where data are stored in different types of databases, depending
    on the application and design. Even if relational databases, such as Structured
    Query Language (SQL) databases (Gao and Yao, 2016, Goap et al., 2018, Ray, 2017,
    Wang et al., 2014), MySQL (Kaloxylos et al., 2014), or PostgreSQL (Mazon-Olivo,
    Hernández-Rojas, Maza-Salinas, & Pan, 2018) are employed in some of the reported
    applications in the reviewed articles, non-relational databases, such as Not only
    SQL (NoSQL), or also SPARQL, a semantic query language based database, are gaining
    attention due to their flexibility and scalability, especially when dealing with
    Big Data. Their ability to store and manage large amounts of heterogeneous data
    makes them suitable in many IoT agricultural contexts (Huang and Zhang, 2017,
    Kamilaris et al., 2017). Examples of NoSQL employed in agriculture are Cassandra
    (Huang & Zhang, 2017), Dynamo (Xian, 2017), HBase (Ray, 2017, Wang et al., 2014)
    and MongoDB (Martínez et al., 2016). An example of SPARQL has been given by Jayaraman
    et al. (2016). Data analytics can be achieved by cloud computing, where computer
    resources are managed remotely to analyse data, often Big Data, or by distributed
    computing, e.g. edge and fog computing. Cloud computing has the advantage that
    it provides high quality services that allow independent execution of multiple
    applications as if they were isolated, even if they are on the same platform,
    e.g. in data centres, which is especially relevant when dealing with Big Data
    (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Martínez et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017). However,
    cloud computing techniques mostly rely on general purpose cloud providers that
    do not comply with specific agricultural service requirements (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017) and can experience latency issues, which are not acceptable in IoT
    solutions where monitoring, control and analysis require fast performance (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2018). Examples of application of cloud computing related to arable farming
    are given by Khattab et al., 2016, Na and Isaac, 2016 and López-Riquelme et al.
    (2017). Khattab et al. (2016) present an IoT architecture with a cloud-based back-end
    where weather and soil data are processed and analysed for automatic activation
    of irrigation and spraying actions. Na and Isaac (2016) describe a human-centric
    IoT architecture with a list of cloud services, such as language translation,
    data simplification or updated market price information. And López-Riquelme et
    al. (2017) use FIWARE components for a cloud service for smart irrigation tasks,
    focussing on the benefits of using FIWARE as cloud provider. Regarding Big Data
    analysis and Big Data in general in an agricultural context, Kamilaris et al.
    (2017) and Wolfert et al. (2017) respectively have performed exhaustive reviews
    on the subject. The use of IoT middleware platforms is gaining interest due to
    its potential for solving different challenges found in the application of IoT,
    especially interoperability. IoT middleware platforms try to simplify the complex
    communication through the cloud due to heterogeneity of devices, communications
    and networks, by using enablers like standardised APIs and protocols (Jayaraman
    et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017). Examples of
    these are HYDRA, UBIWARE, UBIROAD, UBIDOTS, SMEPP, SIXTH, Think Speak, SensorCloud,
    Amazon IoT and IBM IoT, with focus on context aware functionality; SOCRADES, GSN
    and SIRENA, with more focus on security and privacy; Aneka, WSO2, PubNub, SmartFarmNet
    and FIWARE, with a wider services-oriented approach; and projects like IoT-A,
    OpenIoT, or ArrowHead (Gill et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2015, Jayaraman et
    al., 2016, Kamilaris et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016). Even if all these and more solutions are found in the IoT market,
    an intelligent middleware solution that addresses most issues observed in smart
    farming successfully is yet to be implemented (Jayaraman et al., 2016, Martínez
    et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). However, FIWARE (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    López-Riquelme et al., 2017, Martínez et al., 2016, Rodriguez et al., 2018) and
    SmartFarmNet (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Jayaraman et al., 2016) have been
    implemented effectively for precision and smart farming applications. In order
    to communicate data across platforms and IoT devices, ensuring interoperability,
    APIs are essential. These should adapt to evolving or new standards in order to
    ensure a longer life span, which may become a limitation if the APIs are not updated.
    It is through the APIs that data are made available for the IoT applications (e.g.
    Goap et al., 2018, Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018). These services may include tracing,
    monitoring, event management, forecasting or optimisation for agricultural activities
    and products. These applications related to arable farming are described in the
    next section. 4. Current and potential applications Multiple applications can
    be derived from the implementation of IoT in arable farming. These applications
    can always be conceptualised into the three IoT layers described previously, and
    are not to be confused with the application layer. Elaborations of the reviewed
    articles show that the applications have been differentiated and categorised as
    follows: monitoring, documentation, forecasting and controlling. Monitoring refers
    to timely sensing of very diverse parameters and is mostly the initial point of
    entry for other applications. Documentation covers the storing of sampled data
    for later use in e.g. farm management or traceability of produce. Forecasting
    employs different sources of data through precisely designed analytic methods
    for predicting concrete events. And controlling is the result of active monitoring,
    where processed data are used to automatically activate and control actuators
    in a predefined manner. A summarising table collects all the IoT applications
    in arable farming described in this chapter (Table 2). Most IoT-based systems
    include at least two of these applications and isolated applications are seldom
    seen. In addition, special attention has been paid to FMIS and associated decision
    support to improve operations and production processes involving vehicle positioning
    analytics, optimisation and logistics, which are key elements in arable farming
    (Bochtis et al., 2011, Bochtis et al., 2014) and have consequently got a section
    of their own. Table 2. IoT applications in arable farming. Applications Examples

    Automatic monitoring is the obvious first step in IoT applied to agriculture.
    Strategically placed sensors can automatically sense and transmit data to the
    cloud for further documentation, forecasting or controlling applications. Sensors
    are used to monitor crop parameters such as leaf area index (e.g. Bauer & Aschenbruck,
    2018), plant height and leaf colour, size and shape (e.g. Okayasu et al., 2017);
    soil parameters such as soil moisture (e.g. Brinkhoff et al., 2017, Kodali and
    Sahu, 2016) or soil chemistry (e.g. Kassal et al., 2018); irrigation water parameters
    such as pH and salinity (e.g. Popović et al., 2017); or weather parameters such
    as air temperature, air pressure, air relative humidity, rainfall, radiation,
    wind speed and wind direction (e.g. Yan et al., 2018). In addition, remote sensing
    can also be employed, i.e. instead of sensors placed in the field they are installed
    on satellites or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). However, these measurements mostly
    require some form of processing and interpretation as the values sampled are not
    directly related to the targeted parameters. An example of monitoring through
    remote sensing is the estimation of crop biomass and nitrogen content by the use
    of hyper- and multispectral images (Näsi et al., 2018), or the use of thermal
    remote sensing, which has been applied for e.g. irrigation scheduling or plant
    disease detection (Khanal, Fulton, & Shearer, 2017). Furthermore, agricultural
    machinery can also be remotely monitored, e.g. vehicle position and yield data
    (Oksanen et al., 2016), or machine performance (Miettinen et al., 2006). This
    is especially relevant with the increasing appearance of autonomous vehicles and
    robots in agriculture (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). Finally, at farm level the storage
    of crops can also be monitored to ensure the correct control of, for example,
    temperature and moisture, and avoid losses due to damage (Green et al., 2009,
    Juul et al., 2015). Environmental impact indicators should be integrated into
    farm monitoring applications, so that leaching (Burton, Dave, Fernandez, Jayachandran,
    & Bhansali, 2018), contaminants (Severino, D’Urso, Scarfato, & Toraldo, 2018)
    or emissions (Manap & Najib, 2014) are addressed too. 4.2. Documentation and traceability
    Collected operations and process data once stored can be used for documentation.
    Documentation is usually the natural application of monitored data but it must
    be noted that it can also include other types of sampled data, such as manually
    input or documentation of performed control actions (Sørensen, Pesonen, Bochtis,
    Vougioukas, & Suomi, 2011). The data are stored as raw data or as processed data
    at different levels. Documentation is essential for decision-making, controlling
    or analytics, and is an indispensable element in FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    Mapping is also a form of documentation where data are spatially projected onto
    a map. On-the-go sensors installed on vehicles and implements can be used for
    automated field mapping (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015), e.g. yield mapping used
    for later fertilisation planning (Lyle, Bryan, & Ostendorf, 2014), or soil mapping
    for site-specific amendment measures (Godwin and Miller, 2003, McBratney et al.,
    2003). Remote sensing can also be used for mapping crop development (Khanal et
    al., 2017, Näsi et al., 2018, Viljanen et al., 2018), or soil texture and residue
    coverage (Khanal et al., 2017). Remote sensing is becoming a popular tool for
    monitoring and mapping, but is yet to be proven feasible for all its potential
    applications. When documentation data sets extend beyond the farm level so that
    they can be traced throughout the supply chain, it is often referred as traceability
    and this notion is a key element in agri-food supply chain management as a measure
    to satisfy, for example, consumer demands (Bochtis and Sørensen, 2014, Pesonen
    et al., 2014). 4.3. Forecasting Forecasting is one of the fundamental functions
    for decision making that IoT brings to agriculture. Access to “real-time” data
    and historical data is used for forecasting events that require some form of action
    for managing successfully the crop or field operation. Therefore, both monitoring
    and documentation are important prerequisites for enabling forecasting. Forecasting
    is employed as preventive measures that require some action due to a predicted
    event, e.g. weeding, irrigating or harvesting. Machine learning and scientific
    modelling are examples of tools employed for forecasting. Different machine learning
    models have been employed, e.g. Artificial Neural Networks for forecasting maximum
    and minimum temperatures at field level (Aliev, 2018) or for estimating levels
    of phosphorus (P) in the soil (Estrada-López, Castillo-Atoche, Vázquez-castillo,
    & Sánchez-Sinencio, 2018); support vector regression method for forecasting soil
    moisture (Goap et al., 2018) or plant disease detection (Aasha Nandhini, Hemalatha,
    Radha, & Indumathi, 2017); gradient boosting for predicting irrigation recommendations
    (Goldstein, Fink, & Meitin, 2018); Bayesian networks and random forest for frost
    prediction (Diedrichs, Bromberg, Dujovne, Brun-laguna, & Watteyne, 2018); multiple
    linear regression and random forest in estimating yield and fertilisation requirements
    for forecasting harvest and fertilisation dates (Viljanen et al., 2018); or also
    for frost prediction using four different machine learning algorithms: decision
    tree, boosted tree, random forest, and regression (Moon, Kim, Zhang, & Woo, 2018).
    A rather different forecasting approach was employed by Jain, Sarangi, Bhatt,
    and Pappula (2018), where three different models, i.e. random forest, support
    vector machine and artificial neural network were used for forecasting diseases
    and at the same time for adaptive data collection from the network of nodes in
    order to reduce data traffic and energy consumption of the network. Summarising,
    IoT is allowing the sampling of large amounts of data, which can be employed as
    training data by the machine learning algorithms to build predictive mathematical
    models. Machine learning is opening new possibilities for effectively forecasting
    events in arable farming, which might change the very nature of decision making
    in agriculture. Scientific modelling has also been employed for forecasting in
    an IoT context, e.g. soil moisture dynamics and contaminant migration forecasting
    using soil sensor data and precipitation forecasts for irrigation scheduling (Severino
    et al., 2018); fungal disease forecast in winter wheat (El Jarroudi et al., 2017)
    and barley (Mäyrä, Ruusunen, Jalli, Jauhiainen, & Leiviskä, 2018); or forecasting
    field trafficability and workability for field operations (Edwards, White, Munkholm,
    Sørensen, & Lamandé, 2016). These modelling tools have an important role in agriculture
    as they are conscientiously developed and validated by the scientific community,
    and can forecast events for which machine learning models are very limited. There
    is also considerable potential for integrating existing and acknowledged modelling
    tools such as the soil-crop-atmosphere system model DAISY (Abrahamsen & Hansen,
    2000) or the soil erosion model RUSLE (Renard, Foster, Weesies, & Porter, 1991)
    into an IoT solution. Many of these solutions can make agriculture in general,
    and arable farming in particular, more resource efficient, e.g. through smart
    irrigation, as well as environmentally friendly, e.g. by smart pest and disease
    management. 4.4. Controlling In IoT, controlling is the result of active monitoring
    in an automated system, where the monitored variables are automatically adjusted
    to, for example, predefined thresholds. Forecasting can also play an important
    role in controlling. This is, for example, the case in smart irrigation systems,
    where irrigation is activated before drought damage in the crop is recognised,
    thus reducing yield losses. Goap et al. (2018) employed real-time sensing of soil
    moisture and soil temperature in combination with weather forecasts to control
    a fully autonomous irrigation scheme. Sensors on-the-go installed in tractors
    and implements can also be used to control e.g. variable rate fertilisation (Peets
    et al., 2012), site-specific weed control technologies (Christensen et al., 2009),
    or in-row cultivation controlled by plant patterns in precision seeding (Midtiby,
    Steen, & Green, 2018). Controlling is crucial in smart farming as it allows the
    automation of systems, especially considering the operations of autonomous vehicles
    and robots in the fields (Bechar & Vigneault, 2016), where site-specific actions
    and sensing-based safety systems will play an important role, e.g. for in-field
    obstacle detection for autonomous vehicles (Christiansen, Nielsen, Steen, Jørgensen,
    & Karstoft, 2016). 4.5. FMIS FMIS can be defined as systems that store and process
    farm-related collected data and provide decision supporting tools for farm management
    (Paraforos et al., 2016). FMIS assist farmers in the execution and documentation
    of farm activities, their evaluation and optimisation, as well as in strategic,
    tactical and operational planning of the farm operations (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    FMIS are consequently systems that can encapsulate all the applications previously
    described, and are vital elements in smart farm management. However, the adoption
    of FMIS targeted to the new IoT technologies is slow. A study published in 2015
    showed that most FMIS architectures used at that time had been designed in the
    1980s by researchers. This may explain why most FMIS currently have a structure
    and an architecture that is not suitable for distributed and service oriented
    decision support required for supporting precision agriculture and smart farming
    solutions, e.g. 75% of FMIS are still PC-based, and functionalities regarding
    traceability, quality assurance and agronomic best practice estimate are still
    missing or in their initial development stages in most commercial FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al., 2015). FMIS are key in smart farming and they should support
    automatic data acquisition, monitoring, documenting, planning and decision making
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). The latest research on IoT-based FMIS is expected
    to become part of the commercial FMIS available in the near future and will cover
    different needs across the supply chain and needs of IoT-based agriculture as
    a whole, as well as complying with standards ensuring interoperability between
    systems. In addition, decision support systems (DSS) are essential in dealing
    with Big Data and assisting the farm manager in management and decision making
    in tasks such as farm financial analysis, business processes or supply chain functions
    (Fountas, Carli et al., 2015, Kaloxylos et al., 2012). In order to design an up-to-date
    FMIS, it is beneficial to make preliminary use of dedicated system analysis methodologies,
    such as soft system methodologies (SSM), for identifying required changes and
    constraints and proposing solutions, followed by a later hard system modelling
    for designing the required specifications and components of the system (Sørensen
    et al., 2010, Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015). It is also necessary to base FMIS
    on the cloud as it allows interconnection with diverse additional services (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). This development points out the inevitable need for standardisation
    of APIs in order to achieve interoperability among applications and services as
    part of the FMIS. New technologies such as distributed management systems can
    also enhance the capabilities of FMIS to a great extent (Fountas, Sørensen et
    al., 2015). Furthermore, the introduction of agricultural moving robots in the
    near future, as well as the wireless and automatic control and monitoring of agricultural
    machinery, also needs to be considered in the design and development of FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al, 2015, Paraforos et al., 2016). The future FMIS will also be capable
    of emulating farmers different work habits, as the system will automate certain
    tasks previously performed by farmers, which will require additional training
    (Sørensen et al., 2011). Consequently, it is important to provide supportive adoption
    and transition strategies for conventional farming to convert into smart farming
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). Examples of current FMIS employed in arable farming
    are offered by different technology providers: machine manufacturers, institutions
    or targeted private companies. Some manufacturers provide their own farm management
    tools, such as Agricultural Management Solutions (AMS) from John Deere, or Precision
    Land Management (PLM) from New Holland. Across brands some FMIS have a more local
    approach, e.g. the Dutch Akkerweb developed by Wageningen University and Research,
    while other commercial solutions have a global approach, e.g. 365FarmNet, Agworld
    or FarmWorks. 4.6. Vehicle navigation, optimisation and logistics Navigation systems
    are widely used in arable farming with the successful implementation of auto-steering
    systems in tractors and harvesters. However, IoT-based solutions are still in
    their early stages. IoT-based field operation monitoring (Oksanen et al., 2016)
    or monitoring of motor and machine performance (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015) have been
    effectively implemented on harvesting operations. Commercial examples of agricultural
    telematics are Trimble''s Connected Farm, AGCO''s AgCommand, John Deer JDLink,
    New Holland''s PLM Connect or CLAAS’ telematics; however, they are all closed
    systems, which limits greatly the possibilities of the IoT technologies, especially
    interoperability (Oksanen, Piirainen, & Seilonen, 2015). Regarding optimised route
    planning, pre-planning harvest operations based on field data using simulation
    models can improve the harvest capacity of the vehicle or fleet saving working
    hours as well as fuel consumption (Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Bochtis and Sørensen,
    2009, Busato et al., 2007, Jensen et al., 2012, Zhou et al., 2014). However, field
    complexity and vehicle fleet size can become major hurdles for the algorithms
    employed (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019, Skou-Nielsen et al., 2017). The accessibility
    of field and harvest data can be eased by IoT technologies that allow automated
    data collection and sharing via common communication protocols and standards,
    in interoperable data formats, with compatible data model hierarchies; however,
    this is not always the case (Tzounis et al., 2017). IoT also allows cloud or fog
    computing to be employed to solve the high computational requirements of these
    route planning models (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019), even though the computing can
    also be achieved at the edge (Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Data communication
    costs, latency problems and unstable mobile connectivity may pose important challenges
    for route planning applications that rely only on cloud computing, making mobile
    edge computing more adequate and robust for these systems. Nevertheless, true
    IoT-based dynamic route planning is still in its infancy but gaining increasing
    attention, especially with the arrival of agricultural robots (Bechar and Vigneault,
    2016, Kayacan et al., 2015). Concerning its application, until recently, harvest
    logistics has employed field sampled data, i.e. boundaries, obstacles, gates,
    etc., to optimise the route of the vehicles involved in the operation statically
    (e.g. Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Jensen et al., 2012), where the complete routes
    of all vehicles are planned a priori. Nevertheless, these plans often do not comply
    with real-world challenges as they do not adapt to variating inputs, e.g. vehicle
    speed changes or in-field yield variations, or to unforeseen situations, e.g.
    machine breakdowns, eventual out of field delays, non-trafficable wet spots, undefined
    obstacles, etc. There is consequently the need to integrate route optimisation
    and operation logistics in IoT systems, where the optimisation can adapt dynamically
    to varying input and unforeseen events. It is only in the last few years that
    harvest logistics really started adapting dynamically to parameters such as vehicles''
    behaviour or in-field yield variations (Edwards et al., 2017, Seyyedhasani and
    Dvorak, 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Today, new possibilities for optimising
    infield operations arrive with the large amount of data available via internet,
    e.g. remote sensing data or other collected spatial data. These could be adaptive
    planning based on trafficability maps for reducing soil compaction or avoiding
    vehicles getting stuck in wet spots; or selective harvesting based on predicted
    grain quality maps, which is expected to increase the value of the crop harvested.
    5. Challenges and solutions When implementing IoT in arable farming, as well as
    in other contexts, diverse challenges limit or affect the performance of the systems
    employed. The challenges identified in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5) can indicate
    which areas need to be taken into account when designing an IoT-based system or
    point out areas that require further research. However, the results presented
    in the figure are indicative and do not necessarily describe the importance of
    the challenges included, especially because of the multiple applications and implementation
    designs that are conceivable in arable farming. Any of the challenges can become
    crucial in different setups, and are therefore described. In addition, all challenges
    can be related to or have consequences for other challenges. Download : Download

    of challenges mentioned by the literature reviewed, divided by time periods and
    grouped in IoT layers. Interoperability, in general, is a major hurdle in the
    application of IoT. There are different dimensions related to it: technical, syntactical,
    semantic and organisational (Serrano et al., 2015, Veer and Wiles, 2008). Technical
    interoperability refers mostly to the communication protocols which affect the
    hardware and software components implemented. Syntactical interoperability is
    usually related to data formats, their syntax and encoding. Semantic interoperability
    concerns the interpretation of data contents, i.e. the meaning of the information
    exchanged. And organisational interoperability involves intercommunication of
    meaningful information across organisations regardless of information systems
    and infrastructures in a world-wide scale. As interoperability is such a generic
    term, in this section, technical interoperability has been addressed as part of
    the communication protocol challenge, syntactical and semantic interoperability
    have been included under the data heterogeneity challenge, and organisational
    interoperability have been described under the scalability challenge. 5.1. General
    challenges 5.1.1. Revenue and affordability Often the investment for establishing
    an IoT-based solution is high and as such challenging for small-scale farmers,
    while larger farms can more easily acquire IoT-based technologies when investing
    in new equipment (Brewster et al., 2017). The uncertainty regarding required costs,
    e.g. fuel or water allocations, and selling prices of the product give little
    margin for many farmers for investing in new technologies (Higgins et al., 2017).
    Trust plays an important role when investing in IoT systems, and relieving the
    perceived risks by demonstrating the revenues from their adoption is essential
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Jayashankar et al., 2018). For example, in Europe
    70% of all fertilising and spraying machinery is equipped with at least one precision
    agriculture technology, but only 25% of farmers actually use precision agriculture
    components on their farms (Say, Keskin, Sehri, & Sekerli, 2017). Technology providers
    need to increase the perceived value by demonstrating the financial return from
    IoT in order to diminish the perceived risk of adoption many farmers have. Technology
    providers need also to provide robust tools that are aligned with farmer needs
    and practices in order to gain acceptance and trust of IoT technologies. These
    technologies need to reduce the workload, assist in decision making and improve
    the efficiency of the targeted practice. Additionally, technology providers need
    to develop interoperable and flexible solutions that can easily be integrated
    and comply with accepted standards. Governments can also incentivise IoT adoption
    by policies and regulations, especially regarding documentation and traceability
    as ICT eases paperwork and bureaucracy. A reduction in the percentage of mentions
    regarding this challenge (see Fig. 5) could indicate that IoT is being more adopted
    in arable farming. In addition, IoT is likely to reshape the arable farming business.
    The implementation of monitoring and control of farming operations are generating
    substantial amounts of valuable data that are essential for the business of technology
    providers. The way farmers will dive into the data economy, i.e. connecting their
    data to work in vertical and horizontal networks beyond the farm, will have an
    effect on their business models, as well as on the business models of technology
    providers. The point of view of the farmer''s business regarding IoT has not been
    fully addressed in the literature reviewed and will require further investigation.
    5.1.2. Data heterogeneity The diverse data sources and sensor manufacturers imply
    use of different unit systems, data structures and nomenclatures in different
    data formats, which result in reduced syntactical and semantic interoperability
    among IoT environments. Sensor data can be encoded in binary, or represented in
    formats such as json, xml, text (e.g. csv), shapefile, or even proprietary formats.
    The heterogeneity of data types and formats can also affect the performance of
    a protocol employed for communicating the information. Furthermore, this challenge
    becomes critical in situations such as system integration or sharing data with
    other systems (e.g. FMIS), which could imply developing data conversion tools
    or even redesign of the IoT setup. The use of standardised formats can help with
    this challenge. Some attempts have been made at producing standards or standardised
    formats that cover the great heterogeneity of agricultural data, e.g. ISO 11783
    (ISOBUS) developed by the Agricultural Industry Electronics Foundation (AEF) for
    tractors and agricultural machinery, which is very relevant in arable farming
    (Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015, Miettinen et al., 2006, Oksanen et al., 2015,
    Peets et al., 2012) or AgroXML developed by the Association for Technologies and
    Structures in Agriculture (KTBL) mainly for FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014, Köksal
    and Tekinerdogan, 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Peets et al., 2012). These
    are now being integrated by the non-profit organisation AgGateway through the
    ADAPT framework and SPADE project for seamlessly communicating agricultural machinery
    data to FMIS, trying to enhance the existing standards and as a consequence improve
    interoperability (Brewster et al., 2017). A drawback of comprehensive data models,
    which try to describe all attributes of agricultural data, is that they become
    too cumbersome to handle in many applications. Finally, the use of middleware
    platforms applicable in smart farming, e.g. FIWARE or SmartFarmNet, can also reduce
    the problems caused by data heterogeneity (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Ferreira
    et al., 2017, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). 5.1.3. Scalability
    and flexibility Organisational interoperability is a key element concerning scalability
    and flexibility (Serrano et al., 2015, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). Many
    of the systems described in the literature reviewed are centralised, closed, difficult
    to integrate in other existing platforms or difficult to implement on larger scales,
    different farming systems or geographical areas. They are also challenging to
    integrate beyond the farm level and across the supply chain in order to provide
    agri-food safety and traceability. The use of standardised dynamic protocols,
    such as SOAP protocol (cloud-based infrastructures with extensible ontologies
    that cover the broad and diverse agricultural production systems and environments),
    fast and reliable APIs (e.g. RESTful) and middleware platforms applicable for
    smart agriculture, such as FIWARE with its generic enablers, are tools that are
    employed to achieve organisational interoperability and make the system developed
    more scalable and flexible (Ferreira et al., 2017, López-Riquelme et al., 2017,
    O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). Service-Oriented Architectures
    (SOA) also bring possibilities to effectively integrate ecosystems through open
    and standardised interfaces, increasing organisational interoperability (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014, Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Kruize et al., 2016, Pesonen et al.,
    2014, Sørensen and Bochtis, 2010). Scalability and flexibility may also refer
    to WSNs in the literature, to their capacity to support an increasing number of
    devices/nodes, with the network architecture, the gateway and protocols used being
    the main constrains (Elijah et al., 2018). This challenge has been considered
    under the network size challenge. 5.1.4. Robustness and fault tolerance Many different
    factors can affect the overall robustness and fault tolerance of a system. Robust
    wireless connectivity is an important limitation in many setups (Oksanen et al.,
    2016, Vuran et al., 2018). In the design of an IoT-based solution dealing with
    faults, errors and unforeseen events need to be taken into account in order to
    ensure the reliability of the system. Many of these issues are related to the
    other challenges presented here and can be handled at the device level, but also
    need to be thought of in the overall IoT system design (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    Ray, 2017). 5.1.5. Complexity The agricultural system is complex and can be challenging
    to work with. It is complex not only because of the multifaceted nature of the
    physical, chemical and/or biological processes in the soil-crop-air system, but
    also because of the technical complexity of hardware and software interacting
    with it. Depending on the novelty of the IoT technology implemented and the background
    of the developer and user, the systems can become more or less complex. For example,
    software and hardware incompatibilities can challenge its implementation and integration
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016), as well as many other challenges, e.g. the great
    field task diversity in arable farming, that can add complexity to the system.
    Technical knowledge can become a major hurdle for the implementation of IoT in
    farms, and it is therefore important that user-friendliness and plug-and-play
    basis have a high priority for the technology providers (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Zou and Quan, 2017). Complexity should be an issue for the technology provider
    and not for the customer. In addition, the co-created development and implementation
    of IoT systems in agriculture by a multi-actor approach is needed to overcome
    the complexity at different levels of integrating IoT in agriculture. Good examples
    of this are the European Union supported research and development efforts through
    multi-actor large-scale pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Verdouw et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019). 5.1.6. Lack of products In the early stages of precision
    agriculture and IoT in agriculture, products that integrated agronomy and ICT
    engineering were lacking, which hindered their adoption (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Kitchen and Roger, 2007). The large scales and diversity of environments
    in arable farming can challenge the products used even more than in controlled
    environments, as they are to be modelled to describe larger areas, send information
    through larger distances and be exposed to harsher environments. Even if Figure
    5 shows lack of references in the last couple of years, it is still relevant for
    some applications, e.g. for in-situ real-time soil nutrient sensing is still a
    real challenge, especially regarding calibration (Bünemann et al., 2018, Marín-González
    et al., 2013). 5.2. Device layer challenges 5.2.1. Power consumption The use of
    wireless devices has major advantages over wired systems, as they are more economical
    to establish and can cover much wider areas. However, their power consumption,
    with limited battery life, is a major drawback of many wireless systems, and needs
    to be accounted for. This issue is so important that it is the main identified
    challenge in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5), especially for WSNs (Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tan and Panda, 2010). The large distances to cover in arable farming make
    wireless devices indispensable, and solutions to reduce their power consumption
    and/or extend their battery life are required. These solutions can include energy
    harvesting, low power consumption sensors and communication technologies or power
    efficient management. Energy harvesting techniques can include solar cells, micro
    wind turbines or other interesting solutions which have been well described by
    Tuna and Gungor (2016) and Jawad et al. (2017). The power consumption of the communication
    technologies and sensors employed are also to be considered in the design of the
    IoT solution as there are big differences between devices (Balmos et al., 2016,
    Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). Choosing low power sensors
    and communication devices needs to be taken into account when designing the IoT
    system (Estrada-López et al., 2018). Low power wireless technologies, such as
    BLE, have low power consumption but also low communication range, while Wi-Fi
    has somewhat higher communication range, but much higher power consumption (Table
    1), however data rates and other parameters are important factors to consider
    too. ZigBee and LoRa have been identified as appropriate candidates for many farming
    applications (Jawad et al., 2017). Power efficient management techniques of WSNs
    include sleep/active schemes, e.g. duty-cycling algorithms (Ahmed, Abdalla et
    al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Alahmadi et al., 2017, Balmos et al., 2016,
    Dhall and Agrawal, 2018, Temprilho et al., 2018); data mitigation schemes, e.g.
    data aggregation (Abdel-basset, Shawky, & Eldrandaly, 2018) or data compression
    (Moon et al., 2018); energy-efficient routing schemes, e.g. mobile sinks by the
    use of UAVs (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018,
    Uddin et al., 2018); and other combined solutions, e.g. LEACH, a cluster architecture
    with Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) based MAC protocol and data aggregation
    scheme (Kamarudin, Ahmad, & Ndzi, 2016), or dynamic power management by combining
    sleep/active states with dynamic data rates schemes (Estrada-López et al., 2018).
    Jawad et al. (2017) have provided a good overview and description of WSN power
    efficient management techniques. Lastly, techniques such as edge computing may
    have higher power requirements on the device, making cloud computing more desirable
    if power consumption is a constraint in the projected IoT solution. On the other
    hand, mounting sensors and devices on agricultural vehicles and implements allows
    connection to the power supply of the vehicle and as a consequence eliminate power
    consumption as a limiting factor. The type of sensors that are mounted on vehicles
    and their implements is quite limited, being currently mainly camera-based (e.g.
    Midtiby et al., 2018, Steen et al., 2012). Nevertheless, there is for example
    potential in employing sensors on the coulters of seed-drills for mapping soil
    properties (Nielsen et al., 2017), or other on-the-go sensors for mapping soil
    or crop variations (Peets et al., 2012). 5.2.2. Harsh device environment The natural
    environment in which sensors and other devices are placed can greatly challenge
    their functionality and longevity. Harsh weather conditions, e.g. large temperature
    variations, intense rainfall or prolonged high humidity can cause water condensation
    inside devices and consequently provoke corrosion and short circuits (Bauer &
    Aschenbruck, 2018). Sensors and other devices situated close to the ground experience
    exposure to dust, mud, or even corrosive chemicals, e.g. agro-chemicals, which
    can seriously damage the performance of the device or cause its total failure
    (Aliev, 2018, Bauer and Aschenbruck, 2018). Underground chemical sensors are also
    exposed to soil chemical and biological processes that deteriorate the sensors
    and can mislead the measurements, requiring unfeasible maintenance and re-calibrations
    (Burton et al., 2018, Kassal et al., 2018). Choosing adequate casing that does
    not interfere with the functionality of the device and also tolerates the environment
    they are located in is essential in the design of the IoT system. Sensors are
    also developed for different conditions, and need to match the system''s minimum
    requirements. RFID tags have been reported to perform flawlessly under extreme
    conditions and environments (Costa et al., 2013, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011);
    however, RFID technology is quite limited in its applications in arable farming,
    and suitable sensors and communication devices are therefore primarily dependent
    on the application and design of the IoT system. 5.3. Network layer challenges
    5.3.1. Latency, throughput and rate The large amounts of data generated in IoT
    applications do not only cause problems regarding data storage or handling, but
    also latency problems that reduce the throughput of the network employed. In arable
    farming, latency problems can be of great importance in some IoT solutions, e.g.
    in WSNs where high latency implies higher power consumption of a node (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017), or in dynamic optimised route planning in vehicle logistics, which
    requires rapid responses to deviations in the route plan (Villa-Henriksen et al.,
    2018). For reducing latency problems, fog and edge computing can be employed,
    as these computing techniques decrease latency and network congestion (Elijah
    et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018), e.g. data compression at the edge
    reduces the large volumes of data communicated through the network (Moon et al.,
    2018). In addition, the use of lightweight protocols can also reduce latency problems,
    e.g. LP4S for sensors (Hernández-rojas, Fernández-Caramés, Fraga-Lamas, & Escudero,
    2018), or MQTT messaging protocol, which has a faster throughput than HTTP and
    works well for bandwidth limited networks (Estrada-López et al., 2018). The communication
    rate is important to have in mind when planning the wireless communication technology
    to implement, e.g. 5G can handle high-rates, while SigFox or IEEE 802.15.4-based
    protocols are for low-rates (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton,
    Gotta et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). The throughput of the network affects
    the communication rate, and the communication rate also influences the power consumption,
    which equally has to be carefully considered. Fast response to events is achieved
    by data processing techniques such as data merging (Tanaka, 2018), data compression
    (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018), or dynamic and complex event
    processing rules for conditioning input data and immediately acting accordingly
    (Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018). These processes can be on the cloud or at the edge,
    i.e. devices. Finally, test-bed analysis prior to implementation of the network
    can simulate communication rates and possible latency and throughput issues (Stewart,
    Stewart, & Kennedy, 2017). 5.3.2. Wireless link quality A low wireless link quality
    affects greatly the QoS of an IoT system as it ends in unreliable communication
    between nodes (Klaina, Alejos, Aghzout, & Falcone, 2018). This can be caused by
    multipath propagation (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), background noise (Mazon-Olivo
    et al., 2018), routing problems, e.g. packet collision or limited band width (Jawad
    et al., 2017), or even by harsh environmental conditions, which affect the transceivers
    and the quality of the data transmitted (Elijah et al., 2018). Adequate design
    and testing of the network are crucial for avoiding or reducing this challenge.
    However, techniques such as channel access methods, e.g. TDMA, can improve the
    link quality by reducing packet collisions (Temprilho et al., 2018). Regarding
    testing, the calculation of signal strengths in real-time on the base station
    helps estimating the wireless link quality of a WSN when establishing the system
    (Klaina et al., 2018). Packet loss characterisation can also be used to assess
    the wireless link quality of a connection (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018,
    Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018). Additionally, blind entity identification
    can also help estimating the wireless link quality of a network (Mukherjee, Misra,
    Raghuwanshi, & Mitra, 2018). 5.3.3. Communication range The different wireless
    communication technologies have very diverse ranges, which need to be accounted
    for when designing the IoT solution, together with other factors such as data
    rate, power consumption, communication protocols or costs (Table 1). In arable
    farming, due to the larger farm sizes and because of the employment of mobile
    sensors and devices on vehicles, this challenge becomes even more critical. Furthermore,
    relying on the approximate communication range of a wireless technology can be
    misleading, e.g. WiFi is often described to have 100 m range, but a test analysing
    the packet delivery ratio with respect to distance to gateway shows packet losses
    at ≥ 60 m (Giordano, Seitanidis, Ojo, Adami, & Vignoli, 2018), while in another
    test using WiField devices, 2.6 km range was claimed to be reached still having
    reliable internet connection (Brinkhoff et al., 2017). Testing the communication
    range is therefore important for some settings. In addition to the choice of wireless
    technology, network topology in WSNs, such as mesh topologies can also increase
    the communication range by using nodes to communicate with the central node (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018). Reduced range due to obstacles
    or topography is addressed in the propagation losses challenge later. 5.3.4. Communication
    protocols Differences in communication protocols can cause technical interoperability
    issues, which can lead to connectivity and compatibility issues among the hardware
    and software employed (Stočes et al., 2016). Network protocols are separated into
    diverse layers forming a protocol stack, where tasks are divided into smaller
    steps (Suhonen, Kohvakka, Kaseva, Hämäläinen, & Hännikäinen, 2012). In the infrastructure
    layer, some wireless standards that define communication protocols are commonly
    used by different wireless technologies, e.g. IEEE 802.15.4, which is used by
    ZigBee or 6LowPAN among others, or 3GPP, which is used by GPRS, LTE or 5G among
    others (see Table 1). In the application layer, standards such as HTTP (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Kaloxylos et al., 2014), MQTT (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016, Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018) or XMPP (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018)
    are commonly used in IoT applications in arable farming. Adequate protocols are
    especially relevant and challenging in vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and crucial
    in arable farming. Different standards in different layers require careful planning
    of the whole IoT solution, as they are not always compatible and can also have
    an effect on the data formats used, or sensors and gateways employed (Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018). Middleware platforms can ease the integration of diverse protocols
    and standards by offering enough abstraction levels so that this diversity is
    effectively managed (O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Tuna et al., 2017). Edge computing
    can also ease technical interoperability issues as a local computing layer is
    created to process data and create control rules before sending the data to the
    cloud (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). 5.3.5. Network management Managing a WSN
    can imply battery change, software updates, calibration of sensors, replacement
    of devices and similar maintenance activities that can be very time-consuming.
    Smart mobile devices, e.g. smart phones, can make remote software updating possible,
    and can sometimes even be used for updating some other IoT devices (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016). Using energy efficient devices and communication techniques can
    also be employed to extend the battery life of devices (Jawad et al., 2017). Some
    sensors may require recalibrations with a certain periodicity, which has to be
    accounted for in the projected IoT solution (Kassal et al., 2018). Nonetheless,
    the management of the network is always to be considered when implementing IoT
    solutions in arable farming, where distances and number of devices/nodes can be
    vast. 5.3.6. Network size WSN configuration schemes have a maximum number of sensor
    nodes per gateway that the network can handle, i.e. the network size. According
    to the analysis of the reviewed literature, network size is being identified more
    often in the last two years (see Fig. 5), which seems to indicate new possibilities
    for exploiting the capabilities of WSNs. Network size depends on the wireless
    communication technology employed and can affect other parameters, such as data
    latency or scalability of the network (Balmos et al., 2016). Network topologies
    can also influence the network size and vary from simple star network (e.g. Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018) to more advanced multi-hop mesh networks (Ahmed, Abdalla et al.,
    2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Langendoen et al., 2006) that can increase the network
    size by using network nodes as relays to reach a central node and gateway. Optimisation
    algorithms have been used to find the best spatial distribution of WSN nodes,
    and therefore to assist in the optimisation of its network size (Abdel-basset
    et al., 2018). 5.3.7. Propagation losses Even though propagation losses can become
    a big problem for WSNs in application areas like fruit orchards and tree plantations,
    in arable farming hedges, trees, big rocks or sheds, as well as pronounced topography,
    like hills and valleys, can also block, diffract or scatter the signal reducing
    the communication range and causing data packet losses. Additionally, weather
    conditions can also degrade the wireless connectivity propagation of signals (Jawad
    et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Stewart et al., 2017). To avoid or reduce
    these problems, adequate planning of the location of the sensor nodes, the antenna
    height, the communication protocols and the network topology is necessary. Regarding
    network topologies, mesh networks compared to star networks can reduce propagation
    losses as well as increase communication range (Kamarudin et al., 2016, Ruiz-Garcia
    and Lunadei, 2011). Moreover, propagation modelling can help planning, reduce
    communication tests and ensure Quality of Service (QoS) for heterogeneous wireless
    networks (Jawad et al., 2017, Stewart et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Klaina
    et al., 2018, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011). 5.4. Application layer challenges
    5.4.1. Data analysis Data analysis can in some cases become an important challenge,
    especially when dealing with Big Data, which is data in such amounts, heterogeneity
    and complexity that they need new data management techniques for analysis (Wolfert
    et al., 2017). Agricultural Big Data are worthless unless analysed; however, analysis
    can be very challenging because of the volume, diversity, and quality (e.g. errors
    and duplications). This is especially challenging in arable farming, where larger
    amounts of heterogeneous data are generated at diverse rates and from very different
    sources. The literature reviewed show an increased identification of this challenge
    in the last two years compared with the previous 6 years (see Fig. 5). This evolution
    might be caused by increased access and use of agricultural Big Data in recent
    times (Kamilaris et al., 2017, Pham and Stack, 2018). Techniques for lowering
    data dimensionality can ease the analysis by applying feature reduction models,
    which reduce data size by eliminating unnecessary data dimensions (Sabarina &
    Priya, 2015). Cloud computing provides the flexibility and scalability necessary
    for Big Data analysis, where numerous users operate simultaneously with the large
    and complex datasets (Gill et al., 2017). Likewise, cloud platforms are perfect
    for storing such large amounts of data, where NoSQL databases can store and manage
    these large unstructured datasets (Kamilaris et al., 2017). The analysis of Big
    Data can potentially be used, for example, for policy-making, reducing environmental
    negative impact, improve food-safety, as well as improved farm management and
    production, benefiting the different stakeholders involved (Kamilaris et al.,
    2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). Another facet to data analysis is the growing use
    of machine learning techniques, which are being used for exploring Big Data and
    identifying important factors and their interrelationship that affect agricultural
    production systems like, for example, identifying diverse patterns (e.g. crop
    development stages, weeds or diseases) as part of machine vision systems (Bacco,
    Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018, Reshma and Pillai,
    2018). In these cases, the model is built upon a sample of data, often called
    training data, whose size and quality directly affects the final model. Choosing
    the adequate approach for building the model with the available data is also essential
    for the success of the IoT solution. 5.4.2. Data security and privacy Even though
    data security and privacy do not constitute a high challenge in the literature
    reviewed, they are certainly major concerns for the farmers, i.e. the suppliers
    of data and also end-users of the technology developed, who have little trust
    in service providers'' use of data (Jayashankar et al., 2018, Zhang et al., 2017).
    Also, data ownership needs to be taken into consideration as raw data and processed
    data in IoT systems have different ownership and are accessible by different actors,
    affecting the necessary requirements for data security and privacy (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). Research and development focus has been on sensing, processing,
    controlling and computing, while less effort has been devoted to solving security
    threats, risks and privacy (Tuna et al., 2017). Other issues like cost effectiveness
    in, for example, cloud services are also affecting the security of the data, which
    eventually affects the whole privacy and security of the IoT solution, as low-cost
    services have lower security (Dhinari, Newe, Lewis, & Nizamani, 2017). Technology
    providers should prioritise data security and privacy in their business models.
    The availability of privacy and security technologies that are dynamic enough
    to support the vast numbers and variety of stakeholders, as well as the complexity
    of the network, is still a major challenge that needs to be overcome (Verdouw,
    2016). Many solutions are being employed to reduce data security and privacy issues
    in each of the IoT layers of the system, e.g. encryption algorithms, intrusion
    detection mechanisms, authentication, secure routing protocols, anonymisation,
    etc. (Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Middleware platforms are employed
    to add a security layer between network and applications, which can include confidentiality,
    anonymity and security to the system (Rodriguez et al., 2018, Serrano et al.,
    2015, Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Additionally, newer technologies
    such as blockchain are aiming to solve many of the challenges related to privacy
    and security as well as transparency of the IoT. In agriculture, it is mainly
    being applied in the food supply chain (Bermeo-Almeida et al., 2018). Blockchain
    make sense for IoT platforms where large amounts of confidential data are handled.
    5.4.3. Data quality and availability Some of the challenges previously described
    have a direct influence on data quality, e.g. propagation losses, wireless link
    quality, robustness and fault tolerance. Anomaly detection and similar methods
    have been employed to identify faulty data before analysis (Cadavid et al., 2018,
    Lyle et al., 2014). The poor quality of data or its limited availability can limit
    many applications that involve Big Data analytics, modelling and machine learning,
    which can affect or even compromise the success of some IoT solutions (Balducci
    et al., 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). In these setups,
    and specifically in arable farming, many datasets are integrated from different
    sources and sensors, and the quality or scarcity of some data can become a major
    hurdle to overcome. Ensuring quality and availability of the data before starting
    such a project is required. Even if it is not always possible to gather all the
    data necessary to develop models, perform correct analytics or train machine learning
    algorithms, scientific assumptions (Severino et al., 2018), data augmentation
    (Diedrichs et al., 2018) or simulated data (Wolanin et al., 2019) are used to
    help or solve the encountered challenge. 5.4.4. Context-awareness (metadata) Context-awareness
    is an important and distinctive feature of Smart Farming as compared to Precision
    Farming, because it automatically includes descriptive data from e.g. fields,
    sensors, machines, i.e. metadata. Metadata can include information about the date
    and time, node identification number, data of calibration, height and position
    information, or even descriptive data about an experiment objective, field, machinery,
    crop genotype or soil information at the sensor placement (Jayaraman et al., 2015).
    Metadata about sensor nodes in the system are crucial for providing contextual
    information so that correct data analysis can be performed (Jayaraman et al.,
    2016, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness helps computing techniques to decide what
    data is to be analysed, and consequently easing the computations, and the lack
    of this data complicate data analysis substantially. This is especially relevant
    in arable farming, where the system has to handle both spatial and temporal data
    and make decisions based on the data collected. The use of standards, formats
    and middleware that support metadata is therefore important to have in mind during
    the planning of an IoT solution (Peets et al., 2009, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness
    facilitates new business models and strategies for data analytics and DSS software
    providers. 6. Conclusions and future perspectives A literature review of current
    and foreseeable IoT technologies and systems in arable farming was carried out.
    This has included an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies, an
    outline of the current and potential applications, and a thorough description
    of the challenges and solutions. From this survey, the role smart mobile phones
    play is highlighted, especially Android devices, which are employed in different
    ways for a wide diversity of applications, due to their availability, connectivity,
    interoperability, programmable ease and computational power. The introduction
    of 5G networks in the near future will enhance the capabilities of smart mobile
    devices due to their enhanced performance. The intelligent management of WSN as
    well as the capabilities of improved communication technologies can also solve
    some of the challenges IoT-based solutions are experiencing. The role of middleware
    platforms and generic enablers are expected to gain acceptance and importance,
    as they can solve system integration issues and interoperability challenges. In
    general, regarding challenges, interoperability is a main challenge throughout
    the whole IoT architecture, where development and/or acceptance of standards and
    protocols is required to ease the issues encountered by many IoT implementations.
    Furthermore, challenges such as revenue and affordability of IoT systems, the
    power consumption of wireless devices, latency and throughput problems during
    data transfer, as well as the complexity of data analysis, and data privacy and
    security have been identified in the reviewed literature as of high importance,
    and academic research should direct their resources toward solving or reducing
    these issues. Technology developers need to ensure that the solutions create a
    real benefit for farmers and are available and applicable for both large and small
    producers. How IoT generated farm data will affect the business models of farmers
    requires further investigation as it is not fully addressed in the literature
    reviewed. The combination of intelligent power efficient systems with power harvesting
    technologies should guarantee longer battery-life of wireless devices. Computing
    data at the edge, i.e. on the devices, as well as lightweight protocols can reduce
    network latency and capacity/throughput problems. The emergence of Big Data is
    posing significant challenges for data analysis, as the complexity and heterogeneity
    of the huge data sets require the application of new analysis techniques beyond
    those traditionally used. Techniques such as lowering data dimensionality, cloud
    platforms and cloud computing, including machine learning algorithms, can help
    in this area and new innovative solutions are expected to be developed. Finally,
    technology producers have to guarantee privacy and security of the data handled
    throughout all the layers by employing different secure methods without compromising
    the user-friendliness of the solutions employed. Middleware platforms can help
    improving the privacy and security of IoT solutions, and techniques such as blockchain
    can assist with privacy and security problems of IoT platforms when dealing with
    Big Data. In the near future, interoperable and service-oriented FMIS that are
    integrated in the supply chain with intelligent analytic tools will take over
    some of the management and decision-making tasks of farmers and advisors, which
    will require training for farmers to adapt to this type of FMIS. Key decision
    support functions include farm financial analysis, business processes, or supply
    chain functions, which will gain importance with Big Data analytics. In addition,
    DSS for vehicle logistics will grow in importance as a way to optimise field operations
    using route planning and sensor-based site-specific applications. Finally, the
    introduction of autonomous vehicles and robotics in arable farming in the near
    future is expected to completely change arable farming operations and production
    praxes requiring fully adopted IoT capabilities. Acknowledgements This work was

    and potential'
  verbatim_quote1: '"In IoT, controlling is the result of active monitoring in an
    automated system, where the monitored variables are automatically adjusted to,
    for example, predefined thresholds. Forecasting can also play an important role
    in controlling. This is, for example, the case in smart irrigation systems, where
    irrigation is activated before drought damage in the crop is recognised, thus
    reducing yield losses."'

    Keywords Metrics Abstract: The immense increase in multimedia-on-demand traffic
    that refers to audio, video, and images, has drastically shifted the vision of
    the Internet of Things (IoT) from scalar to Multimedia Internet of Things (M-IoT).
    IoT devices are constrained in terms of energy, computing, size, and storage memory.
    Delay-sensitive and bandwidth-hungry multimedia applications over constrained
    IoT networks require revision of IoT architecture for M-IoT. This paper provides
    a comprehensive survey of M-IoT with an emphasis on architecture, protocols, and
    applications. This article starts by providing a horizontal overview of the IoT.
    Then, we discuss the issues considering the characteristics of multimedia and
    provide a summary of related M-IoT architectures. Various multimedia applications
    supported by IoT are surveyed, and numerous use cases related to road traffic
    management, security, industry, and health are illustrated to show how different
    M-IoT applications are revolutionizing human life. We explore the importance of
    Quality-of-Experience (QoE) and Quality-of-Service (QoS) for multimedia transmission
    over IoT. Moreover, we explore the limitations of IoT for multimedia computing
    and present the relationship between the M-IoT and emerging technologies including
    event processing, feature extraction, cloud computing, Fog/Edge computing and
    Software-Defined-Networks (SDNs). We also present the need for better routing
    and Physical-Medium Access Control (PHY-MAC) protocols for M-IoT. Finally, we
    present a detailed discussion on the open research issues and several potential
    research areas related to emerging multimedia communication in IoT. Topic: Mobile

    I. Introduction The amalgamation of the physical and digital world over the traditional
    Internet paved the way for the future Internet of Things (IoT). IoT is envisaged
    as the network model to fill the gap between the cyber and physical world [1].
    The core concept of the IoT is to connect the pervasive objects around us, such
    as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags, mobile devices, sensors and actuators
    to the Internet through a wired or wireless network. Hence, it enables the objects
    to interact with each other and their neighbors to enhance the efficiency of the
    system [1]. Several researchers have defined IoT in various contexts [2]: “The
    integration of tiny devices known as Smart Objects (SO), usually battery operated
    equipped with a Microcontroller (MCU) and transceivers into the global Internet.
    The services offered by these smart objects are known as Smart Services (SS) [3]–[6].
    IoT has created new opportunities for machines to communicate with each other
    and extend the offered applications. Currently, 23 billion devices are connected
    to the Internet [7], and these numbers will stretch to 30 billion by 2020 [8].
    Conventionally, IoT was assimilated relatively in data sensing devices, particularly
    in the Machine to Machine (M2M) environment [9]. Vigorous growth in the connected
    devices to the Internet during the last decade and abrupt demand for multimedia
    traffic has given rise to the emergence of the Multimedia Internet of Things (M-IoT).
    The equilibrium between QoS data and best-effort data is now in transit towards
    an increase in multimedia QoS data. Currently, IoT is an assortment, comprising
    of M2M, Human-to-Machine (H2M), Human-to-Human (H2H), and Machine in/or Humans
    (MiH) communications (MiH devices may include human embedded chips, medical monitoring
    probes, and Global Positioning System (GPS)) [10]. M-IoT smart objects are usually
    resource-constrained, in terms of energy, memory storage, and processing power.
    To make the devices smaller, cost-effective and energy-efficient, sensors are
    usually designed to be battery operated or solar powered with only a few kilobytes
    of memory, and limited processing power in megahertz. Multimedia QoS data shows
    antagonistic behavior as compared to emblematic IoT scalar data. M-IoT devices
    require higher bandwidth, bulky memory resources, and higher computational power
    to analyze and process the procured multimedia data. Table 1 shows the difference
    between scalar and multimedia IoT data. The traditional multimedia application
    involves the data transmission of point-to-point, point to multipoint, or multipoint
    to multipoint. On the contrary, M-IoT applications require immense data transmission
    during multipoint-to-point communication (e.g., the surveillance system of the
    entire smart city) or multipoint-to-multipoint. Dynamic network, heterogeneous
    data, higher throughput, QoS, and delay sensitivity over such resource-constrained
    M-IoT smart objects escalates the challenges for M-IoT. TABLE 1 Comparison of
    Scalar and Multimedia IoT Data Multimedia data i.e., audio, image, and video is
    set of unstructured features. Transmission of such bulky and unstructured data
    over bandwidth and computationally scarce network requires efficient and intelligent
    network topology. The addition of multimedia data acquisition and communication
    requires revision and amplification of the traditional IoT system, which we refer
    to as M-IoT. The revision of IoT for multimedia communication requires efficient
    feature extraction, event processing, encoding/decoding, energy-aware computation,
    lightweight and priority-based routing, QoS and QoE maintaining performance metrics,
    effective channel access, and fair-MAC protocols. Real-world multimedia applications
    include an example of rescue vehicles based emergency response systems, traffic
    monitoring, GPS based path tracking, agricultural monitoring, crime inspection,
    smart cities, smart homes, smart museum, surveillance systems, security system
    for authentication and authorization, multimedia-based e-health, patient monitoring
    in smart hospitals, and industrial monitoring systems. Fig. 1 conceptualize the
    multimedia communication in IoT in every domain-specific applications. FIGURE
    1. The overall vision of integrating multimedia applications of every domain in
    IoT, developing a smart city and transforming human lives, i.e., multimedia in
    agriculture, smart health, security, industrial process, road management systems,
    and real-time applications. Show All This article presents a comprehensive state
    of the art survey on M-IoT. There are several published research papers that cover
    different aspects of IoT. To the best of our knowledge, this article is the first
    that covers the studies specifically targeting multimedia communication in IoT
    in the context of the above-mentioned requirements. A. Contributions of This Survey
    Article In summary, this work aims to make the following contributions: To provide
    a detailed survey of various M-IoT network architectures. To survey the various
    M-IoT applications i.e., traffic monitoring, habitat monitoring, surveillance
    for public safety, industrial monitoring, and health monitoring. To discuss the
    design for M-IoT communication by summarizing performance metrics for M-IoT architectures.
    To survey the M-IoT computing paradigm comprising multimedia data compression,
    event processing, fog/edge computing, cloud computing, and Software-Defined Networks
    (SDNs) for data computing. To discuss various routing protocols in the context
    of multimedia data delivery in M-IoT. To provide a survey on different physical
    MAC (PHY-MAC) protocols for M-IoT. To provide open issues, challenges, and future
    research directions involving M-IoT. B. Comparison of Related Survey Articles
    Alvi et al. in [4] delineate the concept of M-IoT. The article is classified into
    two categories: M-IoT vision and, M-IoT applications and use cases. In the first
    category, authors have presented the vision of M-IoT and proposed four-layer multi-agent-based
    M-IoT architecture. Requirements and open issues in each layer are also discussed
    in this section. Moreover, IoT has been analyzed in-depth in the context of multimedia
    data. The authors have also discussed several video encoding and compressing techniques.
    The second section outlines the various multimedia applications and uses cases
    concerning M-IoT. However, this article does not cover a detailed survey on M-IoT
    specifically. An in-depth discussion on various enabling technologies, i.e., MAC
    protocols and network layer protocols, is missing. Discussion on future machine-type-communication
    and integration with 5th generation (5G) cellular communication is not found.
    Furthermore, various QoS and QoE depending factors and Information-Centric Network
    (ICN) approach regarding M-IoT are not discussed. Multimedia computation technologies
    are not found in this article. The discussion on M-IoT in the context of architecture,
    enabling technologies, MAC and routing protocols is not found in the recent survey
    articles on IoT [2], [11], [12]. The existing survey on energy-efficient M-IoT
    is presented in [13]. This study explains the working of each layer of the traditional
    IoT architecture; however, the intrinsic nature of multimedia data is not considered
    in any aspect. Different routing protocols are discussed in [14]–[18]. A detailed
    survey on multimedia routing in wireless sensor networks is presented in [17],
    [19]. However, these articles present a brief overview of multimedia routing and
    the comparison of various routing standards. It merely discusses the issues and
    challenges of current multimedia data requirements. Current M-IoT takes not only
    QoS but QoE into consideration that is dependent not only on network parameters
    but user’s hardware capabilities itself. MAC protocols and efficient resource
    allocation standards are presented in [20]–[23]. BlueVoice has been evaluated
    for multimedia services in real-time IoT devices in [24]. QoS is analysed in [25]–[29],
    while QoE is studied in [30]–[35]. The concept of Quality of Information (QoI)
    and ICN using a distributed algorithm for multimedia data collection is proposed
    in [36]. Kaaradi et al. [30] have presented the concept of Quality of Things (QoT)
    for M-IoT. However, it lacks QoS objectives. The rest of this article discusses
    the introduction of the virtual layer for virtual object representation and cross-layer
    communication. Cross-layer design related to M-IoT is presented in [33], [37],
    [38]. Thiyagarajan et al. [39] have proposed a secure video transmission energy-aware
    encryption scheme for M-IoT. Using Dictionary Learning (DL) and Approximate Message
    Passing (AMP). A compressed sensing technique is proposed for M-IoT in [40]. Various
    video encoding schemes and multimedia sensing are outlined in [41], [42]. Performance
    comparison of Advance Video Codings (AVC) H.265 and H.264 is presented in [43].
    A detailed survey on multimedia big data computation is presented in [44]. Salman
    et al. in [45] present a survey on IoT from the perspective of Fog and SDN technologies.
    Articles [46]–[48], present review on multimedia in road traffic management and
    biometric security. However, all these studies do not include a survey on multimedia
    communication in any form. Existing challenges, issues, and proposed work from
    the perspective of M-IoT are not presented in any of the articles. Comparison:
    From the word comprehensive, this article provides an in-depth overview of M-IoT.
    This article specifies the limitations of IoT architecture and user requirements
    of multimedia data in order to revise IoT architecture. This enables us to cover
    a review of various IoT architectures supporting wireless multimedia communication.
    Computation is the key feature required for M-IoT. Limitations of cloud computing
    in exhausting the bandwidth and energy-constrained networks are identified. Advantages
    of Fog/Edge computation to assist cloud computing are presented. SDNs are moving
    the IoT architecture towards network virtualization. SDNs in the perspective of
    M-IoT is detailed in this article. This article also discusses the use of Machine
    Learning (ML) as an important aspect for feature extraction from multimedia data
    which extracts meaningful information from unstructured multimedia data. In addition,
    this paper presents various event processing mechanisms to reduce network overhead
    and latency. QoS and QoE metrics are well defined and evaluated in this article
    by comparing it with existing work. Routing and PHY-MAC protocols are well surveyed
    in the literature. However, contemporary literature lacks the consideration of
    multimedia data nature and requirements. This article presents a comprehensive
    overview of multimedia applications and uses cases. This article only includes
    research work that specifically considers multimedia (audio, video, image, visual)
    data in IoT. To the best of our knowledge, this article is the first to present
    a comprehensive survey on M-IoT. A comparison of this article in the context of
    M-IoT with other survey articles is presented in Table 2. TABLE 2 The Comparison
    of Comprehensive Survey on M-IoT C. Article Structure The remainder of the paper
    is organized as follows: Section II presents an overview of IoT architecture and
    a comparison of different architectures of multimedia communication in IoT. Diverse
    applications of M-IoT are discussed in Section III. Section IV summarizes the
    performance metrics, design requirements and existing work to maintain quality
    in M-IoT. Section V presents the M-IoT computing paradigm, including multimedia
    coding, event processing, cloud, Fog/Edge computing, and computing using SDNs.

    of Acronyms and Corresponding Definitions FIGURE 2. Taxonomy of this article.
    Show All SECTION II. IoT and Multimedia IoT Architecture A. IOT Architecture “Anything,
    anytime, anywhere, any media” has become the axiom for IoT communication. Kevin
    Ashton first coined the term IoT in 1999 [49]. The concept of the M2M has gained
    momentum after the development of the first RFID. RFID uses an electromagnetic
    field that automatically detects and wirelessly tracks the object. RFID is a vital
    component of the IoT since it links millions and billions of physical objects
    with the cyber world [50]. Currently RFID is used in various IoT applications
    such as supply chain management, gestural detection [51], E-health [52], mobile-based
    payments [53], and intelligent restaurants [54]. Diverse IoT applications and
    devices from various manufacturers create heterogeneity in the network, which
    increases the challenges to achieve a unified and interoperable standard. Thus
    to speak and understand various languages, numerous architectures are proposed.
    However, no one has converged to a standardized architecture. Cloud computing
    layer-based architecture is proposed in [12]. The motivation and requirement of
    middleware based IoT architecture are presented in [55]. The integrated architecture
    of short-range micro IoT (e.g., IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.11 standards) and macro
    Sub-GHz technologies is proposed in [56]. Hu et al. [57] proposed the concept
    of the Software-Defined Device (SDD) layer-based IoT architecture. Security and
    cognitive layer-based IoT architecture for enhancing efficiency, scalability,
    security, and privacy is presented in [58]. The article [59] proposes an energy-efficient
    IoT architecture based on cloud computing, sensor sleep intervals, and QoI. Fig.
    3 shows the IoT architectures proposed in the literature. FIGURE 3. (a) Basic
    three elements of IoT: power-constrained hardware sensors or devices to sense
    and acquire the data, a middleware to process, analyze, and transmit the desired
    data, and application which visualizes the processed data and results. The existing
    proposed IoT architectures. (b) Middle-ware based [55], (c) Software-defined-device
    based [57], (d) Cloud-based [12], (e) Traditional three-layer IoT architecture
    [60]. Show All The traditional IoT comprises three fundamental elements: mostly
    power-constrained hardware devices to sense and acquire the data, a middleware
    to process, analyze, and transmit the desired data, and application which visualizes
    the processed data and results. These three fundamental elements are depicted
    in Fig. 3(a), and it forms the basis of IoT architecture: 1) things layer, 2)
    network layer, and 3) application layer [60]. 1) Things Layer It is the bottom
    layer in IoT architecture, also known as the perception layer, device layer, or
    sensor layer [61]. This layer is composed of a sensing hardware, scalar or multimedia
    sensors, and actuators, depending upon the services required by the application.
    Sensing devices have uplink data transmission mode while actuators have downlink
    data functionality. Access devices have the competency to operate in both uplink
    and downlink data transmission mode [57]. The main objective of this layer is
    to interconnect things in the IoT network. These devices sense, acquire and pre-process
    data from the physical world either locally or send the data to the centralized
    servers through gateways using Local Area Network or Wireless Personal Area Network
    (LAN/WPAN) via short-range low power enabling technologies like Zigbee, Bluetooth
    Low Energy (BLE), Ethernet, IEEE 802.15.4, etc. 2) Network Layer It is the middle
    layer in IoT architecture, also known as the transmission layer [62]. Virtually
    it is divided into two sub-layers: the access network and the core network. The
    main functionality of the network layer is to process the received data from the
    things layer. Therefore, it determines the energy-efficient optimum route to transmit
    the data to the IoT servers, devices and applications via the Internet using one
    of the communication networks such as WiFi, Ethernet, 3G, Long-Term Evolution
    (LTE), 5G or satellite network [63]. The access network layer is responsible for
    interconnecting various devices and applications through interfaces or gateways
    among Heterogeneous Networks (HetNet) using various communication protocols. The
    core network is responsible for determining the optimum route. Currently, the
    network layer should also support both Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) and
    IPv6 networks considering the requirements of cross-domain interoperability in
    heterogeneous IoT networks. Furthermore, to optimize the IoT uplink transmission,
    devices (e.g., smartphones and vehicles) are also exploited as sink nodes for
    an end to end communication, such as Device-to-Device (D2D) communication [64].
    Various data link layer and network layer protocols are presented in section VI
    and section VII. 3) Application Layer It is the top layer in IoT architecture,
    also known as the business layer [11]. Based on the functionality of the layer,
    it is virtually subdivided into two layers, i.e., service sublayer and application
    sublayer [65]. The service sublayer provides information management, data mining,
    data analytics, and decision-making services. The application sub-layer needs
    to provide the required services to end-user or machines. The application layer
    primarily analyzes the required services of IoT application and transforms the
    physical world data into the expressions of cyber world demands. Constrained Application
    Protocol (CoAP) is proposed by IEEE 802.15.4 standard [66] to improve data packets
    delivery and to reduce overheads. The messaging layer and request/response layer
    are two defined layers in CoAP. Other proposed IoT application layer protocols
    are Data Distribution Service (DDS), Advanced Message Queue Protocol (AMQP), and
    Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) [11]. B. M-IoT Architectures
    The characteristics of IoT make it possible to support multimedia applications.
    However, it poses enormous challenges as multimedia applications are bandwidth-hungry
    and delay-sensitive. Radio and computational resources are preciously scarce for
    IoT devices. The rapid surge of multimedia data in IoT leads to vast amorphous
    data. Researchers have proposed different M-IoT architectures to efficiently analyze,
    process, and utilize the resources with more reliability. Novel M-IoT architectures
    are presented in this section. Fig. 4 and Table 4 summarizes existing M-IoT architectures.
    TABLE 4 M-IoT Proposed Architectures FIGURE 4. The existing proposed M-IoT network
    architectures: multi-agent-based M-IoT architecture [4], agent-based M-IoT architecture
    [67], AI-based SDNs for multimedia traffic management architecture [68], Fog-Cloud
    hybrid M-IoT architecture [69], and Big data layered M-IoT architecture [70].
    Show All 1) Multi-Agent Based M-IoT Architecture Based on the bulky and unstructured
    nature of the multimedia content, researchers in [4] propose a multi-agent cloud
    computing-based architecture for multimedia communication in IoT. The authors
    have outlined multiple open issues in M-IoT over different communication layers.
    The presented architecture is separated into four main parts; Multimedia sensing,
    reporting and addressability, multimedia aware cloud, and multi-agent systems.
    Multimedia sensing is responsible for pre-transmission processing, which includes
    transformation, quantization, estimation, and compression techniques to reduce
    the bandwidth requirements. In addition, authors have suggested equipping the
    network with energy harvesting capabilities to balance the tradeoff between feasible
    compressions and the energy-constrained M-IoT devices. The report and addressability
    comprise the abilities of the link-layer enabling technologies, i.e., IPv6 over
    Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) based IPv6 Routing Protocol
    for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL), green communication, transport, and application
    layer. The multimedia-aware cloud performs four main jobs that are: Multimedia-aware
    middleware is responsible for understanding various requirements/services of the
    end-users and adapts itself to aggregate, process, learn, filter, and deliver
    the services. The device should be uniquely identified to globally access and
    control remote multimedia devices based on several techniques, i.e., Internet
    Protocol (IP), Domain Name System (DNS), Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), and
    Object Name Sevices (ONS). Naming the multimedia content to manage huge multimedia
    data using Digital objects Identifiers (DOI), Digital Item Identification (DII),
    or Digital Item Declaration (DID). Data storage and processing are responsible
    for offering massive storage with the scalability, accessibility, and security.
    Along with stored multimedia, data should be categorized and indexed according
    to the end-users requirement. Multimedia content access requires security and
    privacy policies. Content-Delivery-Network (CDN) is proposed to process multimedia
    content in a distributed manner to overcome resource constraints. The multi-agent
    cloud performs data mining and data analysis, service composition, and content
    sharing. Authors have defined agents as autonomous software working independently
    to achieve objectives subject to design constraints. Kaeri et al. [67] further
    enhance the multi-agent M-IoT architecture to make it more practical by proposing
    and implementing the five-layer architecture. The proposed architecture includes
    a novel concept of modules based channel that comprises multimedia device communication,
    M-IoT services, resources, and a resource connector layer. Service execution agents
    and applications layer holds the upper position in the proposed architecture.
    Various multimedia devices and communication stack form the things layer. Multimedia
    data stream to or from the devices forms M-IoT service of the resource layer.
    Cloud resource is a special type that performs asynchronous communication. Edge
    nodes operate on synchronous communication for real-time processing. Resource
    connector exchanges messages to or from M-IoT service and resource layer with
    service execution agents layer which serves modules according to application requirement.
    It also provides Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for applications. The
    authors have conducted experiments by implementing their proposed architecture
    in the remote collaboration support system for video conferencing [67]. 2) AI-Based
    Software-Defined M-IoT Architecture The robust increase in multimedia traffic
    necessitates an efficient network traffic management system. Rego et al. [68]
    propose an intelligent network management system for the IoT video surveillance
    system based on SDN and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The AI module is integrated
    into SDN to guarantee the QoS and QoE based on delay, loss rate, and jitter. The
    authors define two main functionalities for the AI module, i.e., data classification
    and resource estimation. The SDN controller governs SDN. After the SDN controller
    receives the data from IoT Network Heads (NHs), the SDN controller sends a request
    to the AI module to classify the data. Multimedia data is classified as critical
    traffic. The article also highlights the preprocessing standards to prioritizes
    the data set by classifying it as critical and label it in increasing order with
    1 being non-critical traffic and 5 being very critical traffic. Various Machine
    Learning (ML) approaches are compared to train AI traffic classification module
    to achieve the best performance that is a Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural
    Network (NN), and statistic method (Kernel). Bayes statistic model is used for
    network resource estimation based on traffic priority, route traffic, bandwidth
    variation, buffer management, nodes sleeping duration in the network, and activate
    backup nodes. Open Flow architecture is used to communicate between the SDN controller
    and NHs. The authors also propose a customized message protocol for communication
    between the SDN controller and the AI module, and NH and IoT nodes. Experiments
    are conducted using emulator Mininet, and several results are presented. Results
    depict 77% accuracy of the AI module. 3) Fog-Cloud Hybrid M-IoT Architecture Rahman
    et al. [69] propose a context-aware fog-cloud hybrid based framework that integrates
    spatio-temporal multimedia data from IoT mobile and stationary nodes for the massive
    ad-hoc crowd. In the article, a three-tier architecture: mobile client tier, fog
    node tier, and remote cloud tier, is presented. The authors aim to optimize energy
    resource utilization and reduce end-to-end delay for the massive crowd in the
    smart city. The mobile client tier includes service consumers. Fog nodes tier
    comprises smartphones and other IoT fog nodes distributed in the city to assist
    in real-time processing of spatio-temporal collective or individual queries. Cloud
    tier is formed of IP based massive big data architecture to analytical compute,
    store, and process offline queries. BLE, WiFi Direct, 5G, or D2D spectrum can
    be used for communication within the fog tier. Cloud comprises of four different
    platforms that are the crowdsensing service, social network service, mobile or
    stationary IoT service, and crowdsourcing service. Smartphone acting as a context
    manager and fog node, provides storage, computation, and communication-based on
    an individual’s historical context. Thus, it decreases a large amount of payload
    to the backend cloud. The eventual storage and complex analytical computation
    can be pushed to the cloud. User context requirements are defined according to
    their subscribed IoT services. Moreover, semantics is added to the system using
    the 3A model which assimilates the data from Body Sensor Network (BSN), crowdsourcing,
    social networks and IoT devices to a unified, generic context by the smartphone’s
    context manager to deduce elevated semantics overlay. A query can be responded
    by one or all four platforms. To find a dust-free path, dust sensors deployed
    in the city can provide real-time data, crowdsourcing delivers the query response,
    human or mobile IoT sensors provides the dust level. The response to the query
    can be made available on social network services. Crowdsensing provides congestion
    and weather-related statistics. The article presents a practical implementation
    of the proposed framework and development of smartphone application considering
    Hajj pilgrims as a massive ad-hoc crowd. 4) Big Data Layered M-IoT Architecture
    Authors in [70] proposed a novel concept of six-layered M-IoT architecture based
    on big data aggregation, computation, and extraction of multimedia content. Instead
    of word media authors have considered modal, which refers to the way the data
    is interpreted to convey meaning. Moreover, they have listed three main problems
    associated with multimodal big data computation that is to compute the huge amount
    of data, to detect and extract meaningful information and the current limitation
    of big data processing platforms for multimedia. The six layers proposed in M-IoT
    architecture are: Identification: Devices are first identified based on their
    object ID that is Electronic Product Codes (EPC) and Ubiquitous Codes (uCodes).
    Objects are further discriminately identified based on IPv4 or IPv6. An efficient
    identification technique based on the 6LoWPAN compression mechanism over IPv6
    is presented in [71]. Physical Object: This layer represents the data aggregated
    from scalar or multimedia objects based on their modality and passes on the data
    to the central unit for further processing. Communication: It has the same functionality
    of link, network, and transport layer as in traditional IoT architecture. Middleware:
    It is defined to provide software level support for functional services that is
    resource discovery, data management, and non-functional services, which include
    reliability, scalability, and security. Multimodal computation: It is responsible
    for providing hardware components for computation and Real-Time Operating Systems
    (RTOS). Authors have proposed a sub-layer for big data analytics, which includes
    a centralized data unit, multimodal data aggregation unit, multimodal divide and
    conquers computation unit, and fusion and decision-making unit. These units are
    specifically designed to aggregate, analyze, process, and extract the desired
    features from the big multimodal data. Application layer: It provides the required
    services through a set of standardizing protocols. Moreover, the article presents
    a unique and efficient technique that is Divide and Conquers Principal Component
    Analysis (DC-PCA) to reduce the dimensions, subdivides the data, process the subdivided
    data in parallel fashion, and fuse the final parallel processed data to extract
    the features. Thus making the required decision for services and applications.
    The practical implementation of the proposed DC-PCA for face recognition application
    using Yale and ORL databases is presented. The authors efficiently presented the
    functionality of each layer. 5) Security Based Architecture Zhou and Chao [72]
    devised Mediaware Traffic Security Architecture (MTSA) for M-IoT based on four
    main components. These components are key management which comprises service control,
    user control, flow control scalable, and nonscalable schemes [73]. Batch rekeying
    accommodates multiple multimedia applications based on periodic batch keying,
    periodic batch leave keying, and periodic batch join rekeying [74]. Authentication
    is achieved by group authentication, source authentication, and individual sender
    authentication employing access control list, ability certificates, and mutual
    authentication methods [75]. Watermarking is used to identify the origin of multimedia
    content, trace illegal distribution, and block unauthorized access by embedding
    a unique watermark into multimedia content [76]. The proposed framework exploits
    visual secrecy measures to provide generic multimedia security solutions that
    degrade comparatively to the number of shares in possession of an attacker. MTSA
    inherits content-awareness characteristics from media-aware based middleware security
    architecture for multimedia services [75]. C. Summary and Insights This section
    defines IoT and elaborates each layer of traditional IoT architecture. It also
    covers various architectures and the design requirements for M-IoT. Multimedia
    communication in IoT needs flexible and interoperable architecture to support
    HetNET and different multimedia applications with various application requirements.
    Multiagent, fog-cloud hybrid, big data, and multimedia traffic security architectures
    have been investigated in detail. However, quality-aware architectures and M-IoT
    computation are presented in the latter section of the article. The existing work
    on M-IoT are mostly focussed on application-dependent requirements, and it does
    not take into the consideration of standardizing M-IoT architecture. Standardized
    M-IoT architecture is in need to support multimedia content in various IoT applications.
    The use of multi-agent base ML algorithms can effectively improve the learning
    and understanding of an individual’s multimedia demands in M-IoT architecture.
    This section is summarized in Table 4. SECTION III. Applications of M-IoT Multimedia
    objects equipped with Internet connectivity and interaction with other objects
    without human intervention leads toward the vast opportunities for the betterment
    of humankind in daily life. Since multimedia data is rich in information. Features
    like face recognition, motion detection, license plate identification, driver
    drowsiness indication, patient state, crowd detection, path hole, and obstacle
    detection, retina scanning for authorization and crime detection can be extracted
    employing various data aggregation, analytics and extraction tools. A heterogeneous
    network of multimedia objects, ubiquitous data transmission, and cloud-based multimedia
    content analytics paved the path for smart cities. In this section, we have classified
    numerous M-IoT applications based on different roles in the smart city. Table
    5 classifies and summarizes the applications of M-IoT. TABLE 5 Applications of
    Wireless Multimedia Communication in IoT A. Road Management System 1) Traffic
    Monitoring Efficient traffic monitoring and control is one of the major issues
    in the smart city. To handle this problem, there are different solutions based
    on infra-red detectors, magnetic loops, and microwave radars. These conventional
    techniques incur huge installation, maintenance costs, and lack of accuracy. The
    researcher put forward M-IoT based techniques to effectively detect and identify
    the volume of traffic and predict the reason for a traffic jam. Fig. 5 conceptualize
    the M-IoT to enhance the road management system. Authors in [77] presented computer
    vision-based ontology-driven context-aware M-IoT architecture to estimate the
    traffic by tracking the number of vehicles present on the road in real-time from
    CCTV camera video and segregate moving vehicles from stationary vehicles. Based
    on the density of stationary traffic that occupies the road is compared to a threshold
    value. Multimedia Web Ontology Language (MOWL) has been adopted, which utilizes
    time-varying Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN) for comparison and predicts the cause
    of traffic congestion. Automatic alerts can be triggered by road traffic authorities
    to avoid a traffic jam. Raspberry Pi and Pi camera-based IoT architecture are
    presented in [46] for traffic surveillance and road accidents. The authors used
    a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with canny edge detection on VIRAT and MIT traffic
    data set to evaluate their proposal. The article also presents several surveyed
    efficient methods, i.e., hidden Markov and neural network, Lucas-Kanade, and K-means
    clustering techniques for accurate accident detection and vehicle tracking. FIGURE
    5. The use case of M-IoT for road management systems that includes accident detection
    and prevention system ([46], [82]), traffic estimation and congestion prevention
    systems [77], lane and path hole detection ([81], [83]), trespassing detection
    [91], automatic emergency detection and alerts generation systems [86], and traffic
    signal monitoring system ([78], [90]). Show All George et al. [78] proposed an
    Adaptive Nero Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and image processing based technique
    using M-IoT for the better traffic light management and monitoring system. Camera
    images are obtained and analyzed on a ThinkSpeak based cloud server. Based on
    the analysis, control actions are given to traffic lights. Machine vision blob
    analysis technique is used to detect and locate the vehicle. Due to poor illumination
    conditions during night, the Otsu image processing technique is used. Low Power
    Wide Area Network (LoPWAN) and Long Range (LoRa) receiver and transmitters are
    adapted to propose IoT smart traffic monitoring and control architecture in [79].
    A comparative survey on the M-IoT based traffic management system is presented
    in [80]. 2) Path Detection, Lane Detection, and Accident Reporting Autonomous
    or Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV) are the key element in the development of a
    smart city. Lane detection is considered a vital feature to avoid a collision
    in UGVs. Image-Based obstacle detection and path planning are discussed in [81],
    which includes the conversion of video into fixed-rate image frames. Frames are
    then analyzed using image processing techniques, i.e., edge extraction and thresholding.
    A cloud-based M-IoT system is proposed for accident prevention in [82]. HoneyBee
    Optimization (HBO) based IoT road monitoring system is proposed in [83] to detect
    humps and pothole to prevent accidents. A driving algorithm for path planning
    is proposed for autonomous vehicles exploiting potential field methods and lane
    detection in [84]. Data is acquired using CCD cameras, differential GPS, 2-dimensional
    laser scanner, and digital compass. The analysis is performed using the proposed
    algorithm for lane detection. CDN and MPEG Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP
    (DASH) are used for a real-time vehicle monitoring system in [85]. Ni et al. [86]
    present a novel lifesaving concept for the individuals left behind in the vehicle.
    The article incorporates life recognition, environmental monitoring, and alarming
    subsystem. Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication in M-IoT based on Direct Short-Range
    Communication (DSRC) for Intelligent Transport System (ITS) is proposed in [87].
    Several benefits of using the multimedia Internet of Vehicle Things (IoVT) for
    a traffic management system are identified in [88]. Android-based IoT vehicle
    monitoring system accessing various vehicle parameters and driver behavior analysis
    using a Controller Area Network (CAN) is presented in [89]. 3) Traffic Lights
    Management An efficient, cost-effective traffic and street light control mechanism
    based on M-IoT is outlined in [90] for smart cities. The solar panel-based streetlights
    with Direct Current (DC) power supply as a backup along with Light Dependent Resistor
    (LDR) is used to control the intensity of the light when no vehicle is present
    in the street. Traffic bollards are used to avoid an accident during red and yellow
    lights. Cameras are deployed for the surveillance systems. Latif et al. [91] proposed
    the smart city model having intelligent traffic monitoring and guidance system.
    The proposed model incorporates multimedia data for authentication, verification,
    registration, authorization, shortest path identification, to high light the congested
    areas. Public places like schools, colleges, hospitals, hotels, petrol pumps,
    and banks are considered as objects and are identified by specific IDs. Cameras
    are used to monitor the flow of traffic. The shortest path is determined based
    on time or distance. Vienna Development Method-Specification Language (VDM-SL)
    is opted-in this article for modeling purposes. 4) Authentication and Crime Detection
    IP Multimedia System (IMS) based M2M metropolitan platform for traffic management
    to restrict vehicles entering the prohibited area is detailed in [92]. Authors
    in [93], proposed a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based autonomous Taxi model for
    a smart city. Authors in [94] presented a novel concept of M-IoT based crime detection
    in a smart city by analyzing human emotions and CCTV videos. After detection and
    identification of crime, it is stored in the database and visualized using a Geographic
    Information System (GIS). As the smart city is the set of heterogeneous devices
    and networks, various network architecture supporting heterogeneity, e.g., Information-Driven
    Architecture (IDRA), participatory sensing in building the smart city is high
    lightened in [95]. Automatic toll tax payments are one of the essential features
    in a smart city. Beforehand payments based on source and destination location,
    and authentication based on license plate reading as JavaScript Object Notation
    (JSON) data are described in [96]. A detailed survey on M-IoT based road traffic
    surveillance and accident detection is presented in [46]. B. Habitat Monitoring
    1) Security and Surveillance The revolutionary IoT, transforming millions of lives
    by providing ease in almost every aspect of daily routine, could turn into the
    worst enemy. For example, hackers can hack to intercept every document you print
    and redirect it to an isolated site. They could have control of your smart TV
    to bug your home. The smart metering system could be hacked to control the appliances
    of the ventilation system of your home. A traffic light management system could
    be controlled to achieve specific tasks. Variation in the pacemaker of your heart
    could be made to kill. The autonomous vehicles could be hacked to control the
    braking system for your car. These issues lead to serious threats. Traditional
    use of passwords was the authentication system until now. However, the researcher
    has proposed various IoT security and surveillance system based on multimedia
    data, i.e., retina scanning, biometric scanning, voice recognition, and video
    surveillance systems to minimize security loopholes. Enthusiastic researchers
    have further extended the usage of M-IoT to gain maximum advantage in various
    fields. The following are M-IoT authentications, surveillance, and monitoring
    application. Fig. 6 shows the M-IoT application of security and surveillance for
    habitat monitoring. FIGURE 6. The use case of M-IoT applications for security
    and surveillance in a smart city. Existing work in security using multimedia data
    mostly includes fingerprint biometrics ([97]–[99]), voice bio-metrics ([101],
    [102]), retina and iris scanning ([103], [107]), and face recognition [105]. Multimedia
    data in IoT is widely used in surveillance systems ([108]–[124]). Show All a:
    Bio-Metric Authentication Al-alem et al. [97] presented the sketch map leading
    towards the Internet of Biometric Things (IoBT) using various multimedia devices.
    Authors have outlined various steps for efficient biometric identification, i.e.,
    image acquisition, segmentation, pre-processing, and feature extraction. Moreover,
    the article presents insights about different fingerprint acquisition devices,
    i.e., optical sensors, capacitive sensors, thermal, artificial fingerprints generation,
    ultrasonic, and digital cameras. Several fingerprint databases are also plotted.
    The smart objects in Industrial-IoT (IIoT) share information on open channels
    over the Internet that makes confidential industrial plants vulnerable to an eavesdropper.
    Das et al. [98] presented the cloud-based Biometric-Privacy Preserving User Authentication
    (BP2UA) technique. The security analysis of the proposed model is conducted using
    the Oracle-based Real-or-Random (RoR) model. Telecare Medical Information System
    (TMIS) has been introduced for critical patients to communicate with doctors.
    An un-registered adversary, i.e., attackers can find the loop opportunity to mislead
    the patient to achieve specific goals. An efficient, secure smart card based on
    biometric and password double authentication procedures for remote authorization
    is proposed in [99]. H. Hamidi, in [100] presented a secure biometrics-based technique
    for Health IoT (H-IoT). b: Voice Bio-Metrics With the growing deployment of smart
    homes and smart banking applications, i.e., voice to control everything, and authentication
    by voice recognition, provide attackers with an easy loophole which is one of
    the vital security challenges ahead. Voice biometrics are proposed by several
    researchers stretching up to the verification level of the security system. Voiceprint
    verification system based on DL exploiting SVM-Neural Network (SVM-NN) and Mel-Frequency
    Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), and feature extraction technique to increase the
    security for M-IoT systems is proposed in [101]. In this work, the LibriSpeech
    dataset is utilized for training. Meng et al. [102] present a novel system based
    on a voice liveness detection system that utilizes wireless signals from IoT devices
    and received vocal samples for verification of Voice Control User Interfaces (VUI)
    decreasing spoofing attacks. The authors named their technique as WiVo. The feasibility
    and effectiveness of the proposed system are evaluated on the Samsung SmartThings
    testbed. The article also listed several attacks on VUI. A comprehensive survey
    on biometric-based IoT security issues, challenges, and techniques are presented
    in [47], [48]. c: Retina Authentication The researcher further enhances the security
    level of IoT using multimedia communication by proposing various techniques to
    implement retina scanning and iris recognition. Pjatkin et al. [103] proposed
    a probabilistic iris recognition approach using the UPOL database to overcome
    the PCA technique. HSI and Y C b C r color spaces are used to generate the Probability
    Density Function (PDF). The KLD tool is used to extract colored eye iris information.
    Ocular Recognition (OR) for a secure IoT application has been proposed in the
    literature. Different OR techniques have been investigated in [104]. An algorithm
    based on the fusion of iris and retinal scanning is proposed for user authentication
    in Apple and Andriod devices. Retina based face recognition authentication system
    is presented in [105]. In this article, retina modeling is improved by accurate
    truncation adaption, illumination classification, and lighting estimation. Yale
    B database is utilized to validate their model. Ocular maladies damage the vascular
    patterns and create abnormalities in the retina, which hinders the accurate recognition
    for authentication. Researchers in [106], proposed an efficient vascular recognition
    technique to overcome the effects caused by lesions and to extract region-based
    features from retina images. Gabor Wavelet is utilized for noise reduction and
    pre-processing, followed by segmentation. Blood vessel validation is performed
    to eliminate false detection by a 5-D feature extraction algorithm and classification
    based on SVM. The database is formed by 5-D extracted features. Finally, authentication
    is performed with the created database. Zhang et al. [107] proposed an improved
    Iris localization authentication method. The authors modeled the system by first
    evaluating the quality of the image taken according to the image intensity, clarity,
    and integrity. The clarity of the image is evaluated by using a block-variance
    method, and integrity is defined on the location of the pupil, i.e., the pupil
    must be in the center. The algorithm works by estimating the range of center,
    radius of the pupil, and pupil region extraction, thus reducing the delay in iris
    recognition. d: Surveillance for Public Safety With the increasing deployment
    of IoT in our daily life and decline in the implementation costs, video surveillance
    systems became a key requirement for the smart city to ensure public safety for
    crime detection, home security system, industrial surveillance, and other localization-related
    features. The immobility of the PC based surveillance system encourages the researcher
    to propose IoT based security systems. Multimedia communication over IoT enables
    us to achieve this objective. Basri et al. in [108] proposed IoT residential surveillance
    system. The proposed scheme is an Android-based application and hardware which
    includes Raspberry Pi, Pi camera, PIR sensor, and ultrasonic sensors to alert
    the owner of a house with an intruder. PIR sensor detects the suspicious movement
    within the specified range, and the image taken by Pi camera is stored in the
    memory card. An email or alert message is sent to the owner by Raspberry Pi. To
    detect emergency and generate alerts for the older person at home, an Android
    application is designed and implemented based on the Real-Time Stream Protocol
    (RTSP) and Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) [109]. The video is captured, processed,
    and encoded using H.264 at the server end. Client-end includes smartphones, tablets,
    or PC, can access live streaming using RTSP and video is decoded using FFMPEG.
    Security is further enhanced for the elderly by face detection feature using OpenCV
    library for intrusion detection, and critical screenshots are saved for emergency
    alerts. A natural language processing interface combined with ontologies and image
    analysis based video surveillance approach is proposed in [110] for content-based
    retrieval of visual data. The proposal aims to achieve passenger safety in the
    public transport system. Four ontologies are utilized, i.e., DAML time, properties,
    object, and event. PCA and SVM are used for face detection and gender classification.
    Sphinx is used for audio mapping with semantics formed by ontology vocabularies.
    Infants baby monitoring system for the detection of sudden infant death syndrome
    (SIDS) is presented in [111]. A video camera exploiting the Eulerian motion magnification
    technique developed by MIT to monitor and detect infant chest motion during breathing
    is proposed. When an emergency is identified, an alert message is sent to a parent’s
    smartphone via Twilio, which is a cloud-based communication platform [111]. Video
    summarization to reduce the search time from big multimedia data generated by
    the surveillance system and content image-based retrieval techniques for smart
    surveillance is detailed in [112]. Aggregated Channel Feature (ACF) extraction
    and bounding box approach for moving objects are used, and the cost is determined
    if any critical situation is observed. Image with a high-cost box is summarized
    and utilized for video retrieval on search, which reduces the time, memory, and
    computation requirements of the system. Lin et al. [113] proposed a multi-view
    video summarization method to address the high bandwidth transmission requirement
    for the Internet of Video Things (IoVT). The proposed scheme is based on the K-Nearest
    Neighbour (KNN) model. The performance evaluation is measured by making a comparison
    with the GMM based summarization model based on precision metrics, i.e., removal
    of redundant data, and the security of critical information. An online multi-view
    summarization algorithm and RPi based distributed video summarization sensor node
    is developed in [114] and [115]. Al-Saleh et al. [116] presented a secure framework
    for Mobile Video Surveillance Systems (MVSS) by considering a key management system
    to secure channels between all the entities, i.e., camera, Mobile Edge Computing
    (MEC), MEC to MEC, and MEC to cloud. An optimized spectrum utilization scheme
    for video streaming in environment monitoring by automatic Transport Block Size
    (TBS) index selection using narrow-band Beyond 4G (B4G) is proposed in [117].
    Video-based Indoor Positioning System (VIPS) estimating the precise face detection
    of each individual with centimeter grade accuracy is presented in [118]. The prototype
    comprises two units, i.e., an Indoor Positioning System (IPS) and Mobile Handled
    Unit (MHU). IPS is responsible for capturing the frame of individuals approaching
    an area, the face is detected for all individuals and mapped to the area location,
    after which the positioning information is broadcasted to MHU which compares the
    individual information in its database with the received information. Cen et al.
    [119] proposed an efficient video compression and encoding/decoding technique
    for wireless multiview video streaming applications in IoT to enhance the energy
    efficiency of the system. The researcher in [120] presents the concept of distributed
    edge computing to minimize the video processing load at the cloud for real-time
    wireless multiview surveillance systems. Authors name this approach as Vigil,
    a camera with Edge Computing Node (ECN), which priorities the video frames from
    multi-camera deployed in the same region for multiview and intelligently schedule
    them for efficient resource utilization. It also provides a user input interface
    for a specific query. Slicing and parallel processing approaches to efficiently
    handle the bulky nature of IoVT are proposed in [121]. sTune architecture is followed
    in this approach, in which a metadata manager manages several cloud storage endpoints.
    The processing unit is composed of a master node and several slave nodes. The
    master node is capable of retrieving data from sTune and assigns the slave nodes
    to process the sliced video data in parallel. After processing master nodes stores
    the processed data back to the cloud. CPU and memory usage are considered as performance
    metrics to evaluate the performance. A multimedia application requesting the same
    content from M-IoT is delivered separately over the core network that increases
    the overhead. To cope with this issue, Silva and Neto [122] propose SCORPIO, an
    SDN control plane to provide multimedia multipart transport services to duplicate
    the multimedia packets at the edge of the network and map them with the applications
    of common interest in the data plane path. The performance metrics to evaluate
    the proposed methodology are throughput, jitter, and packet dropping ratio. Quality
    of Computing (QoC) is introduced in [123] to determine the occupancy of the network.
    The article presents an SDN based network selection approach to maintain QoC in
    HetNet. The proposed approach selects between the licensed band (LTE) or unlicensed
    (WiFi) for real-time services. The data aggregated at the sensor is transmitted
    to the edge processor over upstream links, i.e., LTE and WiFi. The Edge processor
    evaluates the received packets according to the data path and computational goals,
    and feedback is sent on a reverse path. Kougianos et al. [124] proposed a novel
    concept of using quadrotors for IoT real-time automatic tracking applications.
    C. Multimedia IoT in Industrial Applications 1) Smart Industry IIoT is the main
    component of the smart industry, enhancing product manufacturing, and optimizing
    the industrial process. Multimedia characteristics further enhance the outcome
    of the industrial process, as shown in Fig. 7a. The steel industry is known as
    the backbone of any nation. The steel industry modernizes civilization by playing
    a lead role in technology development. Steel manufacturing is performed at high
    temperature. Therefore track identification is challenging under such circumstances.
    Automatic depth-based vision feature extraction and track identification in steel
    billet to maintain the quality of steel products in a smart industry by M-IoT
    is proposed in [125]. Online images are taken once steel billets are manufactured.
    Features are extracted using Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and stored in a database
    with identification codes. The framework for 3D surface inspection of steel billets
    is presented in [126]. 3D scanning is performed using a camera by continuously
    capturing multiple images, and green-line lasers are utilized to extract the depth
    information of steel billets to inspect the object from various angles in the
    smart industry. FIGURE 7. The use case of M-IoT in industrial and agricultural
    applications. (a) Multimedia data flow in industrial IoT for inspection of steel
    manufacturing ([125], [126]), combustion quality maitenance [128], and industrial
    meter reading [129]. (b) Agricultural application of M-IoT for crop monitoring
    for production control ([134]–[139]). Show All Condition Monitoring (CM) system
    based on M-IoT is defined in [127]. It detects defective machines to prevent production
    outage and reduce the operational cost in the oil-gas petroleum industry. Thermal
    and gas turbine power plants are the biggest assets of the nation. Flame color
    video recording and images are analyzed to optimize air to fuel ratio that ensures
    combustion quality. Sujatha et al. [128] proposed Fishers Linear Discriminant
    (FLD) analysis technique for dimension reduction and classification. An Artificial
    Neural Network (ANN) based on Back-Propagation Algorithm (BPA) and Ant Colony
    Optimization (ACO) for feature extraction from flame images and videos are utilized
    to maintain the combustion quality. An automatic industrial meter reading device
    based on online Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is designed in [129]. After
    extracting readings of various industrial meters from images, the device logged
    the readings to the cloud. At the cloud, data is processed and made centrally
    available to authorized users on PC, smartphones, and laptops. The proposed smart
    device improves time utilization by reducing human intervention. Solar-powered
    grid estimation employing sky camera based on Energy Harvesting Wireless Sensor
    Networks (EHWSN) is presented in [130]. Authors in this article maximize the transmission
    quality of sky camera images and minimize the energy consumption of multimedia
    data transmission by determining the best forward relay path. 2) Smart Museum
    Preservation of culture is essential for our future generation to establish and
    strengthen their identity. The Museum industry plays a critical role in preserving
    cultural heritage and displaying knowledge about it. It is the primary source
    of promoting tourism and improves economics statistics. Smart Museum is the need
    for a smart environment to inspire tourists from all over the world. A smart device
    is proposed in [131] to gather localization information of the visitor using BLE.
    It automatically provides the information related to art in front of it using
    image processing and stores it to the cloud to be accessible on smart devices.
    Foreground detection and background subtraction are utilized in the proposed work
    for extraction and image processing. To manage the huge historical data and enhance
    the guiding system for tourist in a smart Museum, M-IoT beacon devices based on
    Raspberry Pi for content delivery operating on BLE is proposed in [132]. The researcher
    further takes M-IoT benefits by implementing computer vision-based image recognition
    transport robots for an automated warehouse in [133]. Neural network-based image
    classification is performed using the Orange Pi hardware platform. CvCanny library
    is utilized in this work for object edge detection to track the path inside the
    warehouse facility. 3) Smart Agriculture Agriculture is another important industrial
    sector. Researchers are trying to revolutionize the agriculture sector to increase
    its productivity by incorporating M-IoT (See Fig. 7b). Nisha and Megala [134]
    present automatic irrigation and an infected area monitoring system using a wireless
    camera in the crop field to aid farmers. Zigbee transceiver is deployed to incorporate
    low power Zigbee over IEEE 802.15.4 protocol for communication and managing sensors
    data. K-means clustering machine algorithm is used for the detection of disease,
    color determination, and pest detection. Agricultural production framework to
    monitor and predicts the future harvest of crops to maintain balance in supply
    and demand is proposed in [135]. The software-based visual general user interface
    is implemented, and live streaming of the field crop is obtained by deploying
    a wireless camera. Dynamic data analysis for crop growth management system using
    IoT is proposed in [136]. The dynamic system equips the farmer with the historically
    analyzed data on a smartphone while moving in the field by communicating with
    the nearest deployed sensor node. An efficient low power MAC-based WSN working
    in a dynamic duty cycle scheme is presented in work to resolve the congestion
    condition. The system is evaluated in the context of packet delivery ratio, end-to-end
    delay, and duty cycles. Authors in [137] present a detailed study of various IoT
    agricultural crop monitoring systems. Android-based food recognition application
    to automatically recommend a cooking recipe is presented in [138]. The proposed
    work employs Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) with the Hessian detector to extract
    144 64-dimension features, Bag-of-Features (BoF) for feature representation technique
    and SVM as a classifier. The proposed scheme gives 84% of the recognition rate.
    Witjaksono et al. in [139] exploits IoT based application for images recognition
    to determine the freshness of the food. The application also discriminates halal
    meat from non-halal meat for Muslims. D. Health Monitoring Multimedia data provides
    the medium to communicate, monitor, and cooperate with various aspects of daily
    life at numerous levels of granularity across various applications, which in terms
    of health is known as personal health media. Incorporating personal health media
    in one device to measure everything using IoT is the features of the future health
    system, as shown in Fig. 8. For this purpose, highly elaborative personal health
    data features are required. Boll et al. [140] presented a logical device layer-based
    architecture for mapping multimedia signals from various devices to the smallest
    elaborative unit named as primary health feature. Mapping is also performed to
    fuse multiple features and deploy advanced analytics to gain minor health details.
    FIGURE 8. The use case of M-IoT for Health. The existing work of M-IoT for smart
    health includes remotely personal health monitoring ([140]–[142]), robotic ambulance
    [144], X-ray for robotic surgery ([145], [146]), biomedical training for surgeons
    [147] and ocular diseases detection using smartphones [148], [149]. All these
    applications could be integrated using cloud service to be available for online
    and offline access. Show All Zafra et al. [141] addressed the issue of coexistence
    wearable devices for e-health with traditional three-layered IoT architecture
    and proposed a pervasive layered architecture to integrate M2M communication between
    e-health wearable and IoT devices. Shah et al. [142] highlight the challenges
    in analyzing big data generated from remote health monitoring and decision making
    by comparison with the patient’s history. The authors also provided details of
    various QoS driven Cloud of Things (CoT) based data processing for remote health
    applications. Rehman et al. [143] proposed 5G small cell network deployment in
    an ambulance for efficient uplink medical video streaming to enhance the medical
    QoS (m-QoS). Ultrasound video is considered as uplink traffic. Medical QoS performance
    is analyzed on the basis of throughput, delay, and Packet Loss Ratio (PLR). Results
    depict that implementing small cell networks augments the performance of the system.
    However, improvements are still required for deploying remote medical health systems
    as packets drop in critical medical condition is not tolerable. Sudden cardiac
    arrest is a heart condition in which heart stops due to lack of oxygen leading
    to death if immediate Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is not given. AED
    is a small device for untrained or minimal trained personnel to use it until the
    first aid arrives. Samani and Zhu [144] designed an intelligent robotic ambulance
    named AmbuBot to provide AED to save a life. AmbuBot is equipped with a GSM module
    for remote connectivity and high-resolution cameras for Lane Keeping System (LKS)
    to track lanes and prevent accidents. The system can be further extended for multiple
    conditions, body sensors, and multiple robots for collaborative work. Robot-Assisted
    Fracture Surgery (RAFS) is revolutionizing the medical health care by reducing
    infection risk during surgery and perfectly manipulate each bone fragment into
    the perfect position. The coordination system is in need between the detected
    bone track and an external robotic tool to exact position the broken bone. Automatic
    tool detection for surgery assistance based on computer vision X-ray images is
    proposed in [145]. Block detection, geometric model matching, and principal component
    analysis are utilized to achieve a 91% success rate. The robotic arm can extend
    the perfection provided by 3D positioning. Smartphone controlled Raspberry Pi
    based robotic arm is designed to assist the doctor in surgery [146]. The platform
    offers built-in compatibility of WiFi, camera and other sensors. Surgical skills
    and effectiveness directly affect the patient’s health. To minimize the harm to
    the patient, surgeons should be highly trained with subjective skills. To overcome
    this problem, research scientists, along with the medical Doctors in [147] have
    designed a biomedical IoT data extraction technique to train surgeons and provide
    real-time feedback on their skills efficiently. The proposed biomedical trainer
    architecture comprises virtual images, medical images, patients data, and journal
    data. The performance of the surgeon is evaluated by capturing the surgeon’s technique,
    visualizing the data, and comparison with the benchmark. Multimedia data features
    in IoT further benefits the field of medical health by retinal cataract detection
    technique for remote area patients. To achieve this, authors in [148] proposed
    a design to implement a microscopic lens over a low-cost smartphone camera and
    real-time detection by FeedForward Neural Network (FFNN) trained the algorithm.
    Yin et al. [149] enhance the system to detect multiple ocular diseases. The proposed
    automatic architecture includes retinal images of data acquisition using a fundus
    camera. Cloud platform stores patient history, process, analyze and extract features
    of stored images. The reports are generated after analysis, and corresponding
    ophthalmologists are referred. The proposed methodology aims to reduce the workload
    on medical specialists and save time. E. Summary and Insights This section covers
    the wireless multimedia delay-sensitive applications supported by IoT. Feature
    extraction from audio, video, and images are studied in detail for different applications
    in security surveillance, traffic, health, and industry monitoring. Various proposed
    methods for biometric authentication to enhance security systems are highlighted.
    Multimedia data in optimizing the performance of the industrial process is also
    detailed in this section. The existing M-IoT applications are more focused on
    feature extraction, mapping, and analysis of multimedia data. However, mobility
    has not been considered in the M-IoT network for the successful transmission of
    the delay-sensitive real-time application. Table 5 classifies the existing work
    on M-IoT applications and summarizes this section. SECTION IV. Performance Metrics
    for M-IoT As compared to traditional IoT, multimedia services are gaining admiration
    in IoT. Multimedia services are delay-sensitive and require efficient network
    models to maintain quality. The bulky nature of multimedia data increases the
    challenges to satisfy the network end-user. User-centric and network-centric metrics
    can assess quality. QoS can be determined by network-centric metrics, while user-centric
    metrics estimate QoE. QoE symbolizes the user perspective of QoS, i.e., measurement
    of the overall performance of service or network to evaluate delay-sensitive traffic.
    QoE is further influenced by two factors, i.e., objective and subjective factors.
    The subjective QoE is measured from experience evaluated by humans, which is problematic
    to measure. The objective QoE data includes network-related manageable and quantifiable
    parameters. Multimedia content over IoT can be evaluated through subjective QoE
    metrics such as Mean Opinion Score (MOS), Degradation Means Opinion Score (DMOS),
    and user satisfaction [150]. MOS is quantified by rating a user’s experience in
    the range from 1 to 5, where 5 represents the best experience and 1 as bad. Each
    MOS rating corresponds to a solo M-IoT service/session/application required by
    one or set of users and delivered by only one multimedia application. In DMOS,
    users are asked to quantify the degradation of the services as 1 being very annoying
    to 5 as degradation is inaudible. User engagement or satisfaction method can be
    adopted only when the user interacts with the application, i.e., video playtime,
    or several likes, and views. In the case of M2M communication, where the recipient
    of the application is a machine, the performance is evaluated by QoS. QoE and
    QoS perspective related to M-IoT architectures and optimization metrics are studied
    and detailed. Fig. 9 shows classification of QoS and QoE metrics to evaluate network
    and application quality. The elucidation of each study concerning QoE and QoS
    has been presented in the following subsections (See Table 6). TABLE 6 Performance
    Metrics for M-IoT Frameworks FIGURE 9. The classification of performance metrics
    for M-IoT network. The existing work on quality can be studied based on the objective-based
    QoS metrics or subjective-based QoE metrics. Show All A. Quality of Experience
    (QoE) Aware Architectures According to Qualinet White Paper [151], QoE is defined
    as “QoE is the degree of delight or annoyance of the user of an application or
    service. It results from the fulfillment of his or her expectations concerning
    the utility and enjoyment of the application or service in the light of the user’s
    personality and current state.” International telecommunication union (ITU) defines
    QoE in ITU-T Rec. P.10 [152] as follows: “The overall acceptability of an application
    or service, as perceived subjectively by the end-user.” Subjective and objective
    QoE data of the M-IoT network is mostly acquired and evaluated separately. The
    fusion of the subjective QoE data, i.e., user’s experience rating with the objective
    QoE data, i.e., bandwidth allocation, route selection, etc., is important to optimize
    the system. Huang et al. in [31] proposed a novel NN based self-learning self-updating
    framework to fuse QoE subjective and objective metrics named as QoEDF. MOS is
    adopted in this framework to quantify user experiences per service. Various factors
    affecting QoE has been presented in the article. Bandwidth allocation, jitter,
    and best route selection are considered as objective metrics. Two-layered NN based
    framework is presented to map the subjective MOS value with objective metrics.
    The optimization problem is formulated to optimize QoE by first selecting the
    best route and then assigning the required bandwidth for the selected route. Floris
    and Atzori in [153] and [154] proposed virtual layered based QoE-aware architecture.
    The term Quality of Data (QoD) is introduced to evaluate the quality or precision
    of acquired data by M-IoT devices, and QoS parameters are considered as influencing
    factors for QoD. QoE-aware framework for smart surveillance and vehicle monitoring
    system has been presented. The authors adopted MOS for numerically measuring QoE.
    Karaadi et al. [155] defined the term QoE and QoS in the rapport of M2H, H2H,
    H2H, and M2M. In the case of humans as the recipient of the multimedia services,
    the performance of the service is evaluated as QoE, otherwise, when a receiver
    is a machine, then the concept of QoT is utilized. QoT is defined as the acceptable
    quality to satisfy or complete a service session successfully. The bandwidth utilization
    is optimized by considering the minimum bandwidth at an acceptable level to meet
    the minimum requirement of an application. Results depict that the requirement
    for QoE is greater than QoT. The system can be further enhanced by utilizing ML
    approach to allocate minimum bandwidth as required to maintain QoT. Ikeda et al.
    [35] proposed M-IoT framework to evaluate QoE based on physical metrics and metaphysical
    metrics. The metaphysical metric is proposed to understand the user’s quality
    and service requirement, which varies with applications and model them with available
    physical metrics to achieve desired QoE. However, this work lacks subjective experiments
    and qualitative modeling. SDN and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) based
    QoE optimization for adaptive video streaming applications is proposed in [156].
    Video streaming comprises four main tasks, i.e., caching, encoding, forwarding,
    and playing back. Node selection for best-path selection is defined as the objective
    function subject to the constrained node in terms of resources. The proposed model
    is evaluated on Mininet a network emulator and OpenDaylight as an SDN controller.
    Performance evaluation of the model is studied based on end-to-end delay, packet
    loss, and user’s QoE. He and Wang [157] studied the effect of interference between
    Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) UE’s on QoE at the consumer end. Authors
    utilize the user satisfaction method, i.e., several clicks or playtime to quantify
    QoE and formulated Cournot competition Oligopoly game problem to optimize power
    allocation among NOMA UE’s to upload the acquired real-time video surveillance
    data to the BS with minimum interference and maintain QoE. Statistical learning,
    prediction, and automatic network resource management mechanism to optimize multimedia
    QoE has been presented in [158]. By statistical monitoring, the QoE is predicted,
    computed and managed by evaluating objective network metrics, i.e., jitter, packet
    loss rate, frame rate, frame resolution, data rate, codec, and data volume. MOS
    has been utilized for QoE. The mobile node frequently switching network has been
    tested for the proposed model. Ahmad et al. [159] presented a multi-dimensional
    passive QoE monitoring approach at the user terminal based on quality degradation,
    where the probes at UE becomes online when quality is degraded below a specific
    threshold. The analyzed data at UE will be sent to the service provider to take
    critical actions to overcome the degradation. The proposed system could be improved
    by the implementation of cloud-based QoE analysis and monitoring. Wang W. and
    Wang Q. in [32] introduce a novel concept of Smart Media Pricing (SMP) by implementing
    Price as a Resource (PaaR) instead of smart data pricing. The authors have proposed
    to price the end-user according to its required QoE as the criticality of a self-driving
    car is higher to ensure the QoE due to high data rate requirement for precision
    than the telepresence of a user in which bandwidth requirements are low. Premium
    quality content should be priced higher than an economy class user. B. Quality
    of Service (QoS) Aware Architecture The quality of telecommunication services
    is defined by ITU in recommendation ITU-T E.800 [160] as: “Totality of characteristics
    of a telecommunications service that bear on its ability to satisfy stated and
    implied needs of the user of the service.” Microsoft defines network QoS in [161]
    technical white paper as: “Network QoS refers to the ability of the network to
    handle this traffic such that it meets the service needs of certain applications.”
    A framework to assess the quality of stereoscopic images for 3D product modeling
    in M-IoT has been presented in [162]. The authors proposed a blind image Deep
    Belief Network (DBN) based on natural science feature extraction and Support Vector
    Regression (SVR) for training. More effective machine and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms
    could be adopted to reduce the image distortions. Bellavista et al. in [163] proposed
    an SDN controller based Fibre optics-Wireless (FiWi) and edge M-IoT hybrid network
    architecture to optimize QoS in HetNet. Resource allocation, i.e., bandwidth,
    is considered as QoS optimization metrics. FiWi and Edge M-IoT hybrid network
    enhance the performance by communicating via the SDN controller. Reserved and
    excess bandwidth are offered by FiWi network to edge network in case of spontaneous
    network addition at consumer end via SDN heads. SDN based HetNets integration
    offers better network management. Statistical QoS metrics analysis of HetNets
    gateway is studied in [164] for betterment in M-IoT network designing. PLR, throughput,
    and delay are considered as QoS data. Results show that delay is the same for
    all types of devices. However, PLR and throughput affect more on low data rate
    gateways as compared to high data rate gateways. Aazam et al. [34] proposed a
    fog resource estimation and utilization to improve QoS based on service Relinquish
    Rate (RR) and previous Net Promoter Score (NPS). Resources are managed according
    to past Service Level Agreement (SLA) or disagreements. Fog computation enhances
    the performance of the system model by equipping the devices to estimate and utilize
    resources more efficiently. Quality-aware Universal Communication Framework (UCF)
    to handle mobile connectivity and reduce signaling overheads repeatedly between
    end devices for M2M communication has been presented in [165]. Network QoS parameters
    have been analyzed in [166] to evaluate to satisfy QoE for IoVT at various network
    conditions. QoS-aware framework for the Narrow-Band Internet of Things (NB-IoT)
    network by utilizing a Partial Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) to optimize
    energy consumption is outlined in [167]. To conserve energy, Poison distribution
    in POMDP is used to estimate traffic arrival rates and adopt dynamic network configuration
    changes according to future traffic prediction. The proposed model conserves power
    for BS and UE. Implementation of various optimization problems and ML algorithms
    to predict traffic arrival can further improve the system. Web Real-Time Communication
    (WebRTC) for video conferencing in connection with cloud computation has been
    studied in [168]. The proposed model analyzes QoS parameters in comparison with
    WebRTC in connection with local networks. Traffic load and the computational delay
    has been considered as QoS metrics for analysis. Elhammouti et al. [169] form
    a game theory problem named satisfaction equilibrium with an objective function
    to optimize energy instead of maximizing QoS. The authors have highlighted key
    motivation for optimizing energy subject to achieve satisfactory QoS constraint.
    Several applications related to multimedia have specific data rate requirements,
    therefore maximizing the QoS above that level will waste the energy. The energy
    management can be further enhanced by allocating power based on the intrinsic
    requirement of the application. C. Summary and Insight In this section, work related
    to the quality of the M-IoT network in terms of network performance has been discussed
    in detail. Quality of network is further evaluated in terms of a subjective measure
    of user experience, which is QoE and performance of network parameters, i.e.,
    QoS. Various QoE-aware and QoS-aware frameworks have been discussed. Issues and
    further enhancements in these works are highlighted. The Key Performance Indicators
    (KPIs) of communication are network metrics. Due to the scarcity of the network’s
    bandwidth, bandwidth utilization is one of the major KPI. As multimedia data consume
    a huge amount of bandwidth therefore researchers are considering exploiting un-utilized
    wideband available in Terahertz (THz) band i.e., 30–300 GHz that can loosen the
    strict limitations on bandwidth utilization. However, several issues related to
    human exposure index due to high penetration power, antenna designing, resource
    allocation, physical and MAC designing are open for research. Studies related
    to QoS and QoE are highlighted in Table 6. SECTION V. M-IoT Computing Paradigm
    A significant increase in multimedia big data generated from IoT devices, this
    volume increases with diminishing size and mobile nature of IoT devices. The amount
    of data generated is expected to be 600 Zettabytes (ZB) annually by 2020 [170].
    One of the particular multimedia IoT data generated online is audio, video, images,
    and graphics [171]. The characteristics of multimedia data are specified as huge
    volume, structured and unstructured data, velocity, unpredictability (frequently
    changing), and accuracy [172]. The current IoT frameworks to analyze and process
    scalar data are unsuitable for multimedia data in IoT. Multimedia data in IoT
    poses challenges including storage and sharing, real-time computation, processing
    and provision, energy optimization, resource allocation, feature extraction from
    unstructured multimedia data, addressing and routing, QoS and QoE preservation,
    delay sensitivity, data reduction, compression and encryption, security and privacy
    [171]. Previously we have discussed M-IoT architectures, use cases, QoS, and QoE
    optimization techniques. In this section, various computation, processing, compression
    techniques have been discussed. Fig. 10 shows the classification of multimedia
    computing in IoT. Routing and resource allocation MAC approaches are present in
    the later sections. Four main phases of multimedia data computation are shown
    in Fig. 11. A detailed survey on multimedia big data computing in IoT is presented
    by Kumari et al. [44]. The authors have discussed in detail the difference between
    big data and big multimedia data. This section has been specifically subdivided
    into multimedia data compression and event processing, fog/edge frameworks for
    M-IoT computation, cloud computation for M-IoT and SDNs for M-IoT computing. Table
    7 classifies and summarizes the existing work related to multimedia data computing
    in IoT. TABLE 7 Multimedia Computing Paradigm in M-IoT FIGURE 10. Classification
    of M-IoT computing. The existing work on multimedia computing can be studied based
    on compression and encoding, event detection and processing, cloud computing,
    fog/edge computing, and SDNs for computing. Show All FIGURE 11. Multimedia data
    computing phases. Data is first efficiently acquired, compressed, and transmitted
    to computing unit for feature classification and extraction, and then the decision
    is made on classified data. Show All A. Multimedia Coding and Compression In conventional
    multimedia data encoding techniques, data is compressed once and decoded whenever
    played. M-IoT devices are more concerned with uploading the data in uplink transmission,
    which poses challenges on computationally powered constrained M-IoT devices. Traditionally
    video encoding/compression is achieved by utilizing spatial and temporal redundancies.
    The techniques for multimedia encoding are known as High-Efficiency Video Coding
    (HEVC) jointly developed by ITU-T and International Organization for Standardization
    (ISO). The current standard jointly designed in 2013 is H.265, which shows efficient
    performance as compared to H.264 developed in 2003 [173]. The major features of
    H.265 include maximum block size of 64×64 , adaptive block sub splitting and prediction,
    and up to thirty-five intra-frame prediction directions. Google developed VP9
    and DAALA is designed by Mozilla Corporation, both compete with H.264 [174]. Comparative
    analysis of H.264, H.265, VP9, and DAALA has been presented in [43]. Results depict
    that H.265 outperforms other encoding techniques. Liu et al. [175] devised a computation
    complexity reduction transcoder solution for real-time video communication. After
    mapping the relationship among H.264/AAVC decoding information, the Coding Unit
    (CU), and the Prediction Unit (PU) decision process, the proposed model exploits
    SVM to classify either to select PU decision mode or CU depth decision process.
    The objective of the algorithm is to optimize the interframe prediction process
    of the HEVC re-encoder. Energy consumption can be significantly minimized by applying
    compression techniques to avoid energy transmission costs. Santos et al. [176]
    proposed a truncation based compression technique named ScaleRelativeMax based
    on Energy Packing Efficiency (EPC) for sensitive biomedical applications. For
    a biomedical application, the reconstruction of the signal without losses is of
    great importance. The impact of different truncation strategies on the Compression
    Ratio (CR) has been discussed in detail and compared with the proposed strategy.
    Results illustrate that the proposed technique offers linear reconstruction growth
    with comparable CR to other techniques. Compressed Sensing (CS) uses sparse signal
    structures to diminish the size of the transmitted or stored data. Multimedia
    data is sparse in structure. CS is used for multimedia data acquisition and reconstruction.
    Li et al. [40] exploit DL and AMP for improving IoT multimedia data reconstruction
    quality and minimize bandwidth utilization. Performance comparison of the DL-AMP
    technique with EM-GM-GAMP, Gauss-AMP, fast-BM3D-AMP, and other proposed CS techniques
    in the literature validates the proposed framework is suitable for multimedia.
    A Joint full reference Quality Assessment Metric (JQAM) based on the Human Visual
    System (HVS) by considering binocular perception and image properties is projected
    in [177]. The proposed technique efficiently measures the image pixel, contrast,
    and structural distortion by considering the luminance masking of the image to
    access the quality of the image. Hu et al. in [178] proposed a joint compression
    and transmission technique to optimize energy usage based on the canonical Lyapunov
    optimization scheme for power-constrained multisensor wearable devices. M-IoT
    devices are energy and resource-constrained. M-IoT devices are required to be
    computationally efficient as most of the devices are battery operated. An efficient
    task allocation strategy to maintain the QoS is required to assign the task to
    process in parallel dynamically. Wei et al. [179] proposed a real-time approximate
    task computation allocation strategy for MultiProcessor System on Chips (MPSoC)
    to increase the number of executions in a hybrid energy environment. In a hybrid
    renewable energy system, the power supply is unpredictable. Authors designed a
    dynamic task scheduler to adapt real-time varying conditions in fluctuating energy
    availability. Khernane et al. [180] discussed the tradeoff between video data
    coding and quality at the user end while optimizing the energy for the maximum
    life expectancy of the network. An entirely distributed algorithm is presented
    to balance the power utilized to encode the video and video encoding rate. The
    authors considered the dynamic nature of link capacity. The transmission errors
    are minimized by incorporating retransmissions based on the two-state Markov chain.
    However, in this work, spectrum efficiency is not taken into account, which is
    the key requirement for multimedia data transmission. A detailed survey on M2M
    communication is highlighting the issue and challenges in distributed video cameras
    in [181]. Various video coding techniques, power consumption analysis, and energy
    harvesting approaches is detailed in this article. Aljawarneh et al. [182] devised
    a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) encryption system based on Feistel Encryption
    Scheme (FES) and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to secure medical multimedia
    data. The multimedia data is divided into equal-sized blocks, which are subdivided
    into plain text and keys. Each key and plain text is then encrypted separately
    using FES and AES, respectively. The genetic algorithm integrates separately encrypted
    keys and plain text to secure the data from vulnerability. The system utilizes
    the GPU to process graphics efficiently and provides parallel processing to execute
    maximum tasks to increase system throughput. B. Event Processing The M-IoT encompasses
    myriad applications in every field which varies in data capacities, features,
    nature of outputs, and encoding formats. An increasing number of devices and applications
    transits the nature of multimedia traffic more towards unstructured events. Generic
    event detection and query processing framework is in need to process structured
    and unstructured multimedia events. Aslam and Curry [183] proposed a Multimedia
    Stream Processing Engine (MSPE) as a middleware with an operator to analysis unstructured
    events in multimedia data and DNN processor to extract and match the features.
    Publish/subscribe mechanism is adapted in which multimedia devices send captured
    events to the middleware and subscribers can access the desired events by relevant
    classifiers from middleware by DNN based matchers. Optimization models are adapted
    to analyze and process a user’s query to achieve optimized throughput and accuracy
    to serve the query. The integration of diverse image analysis techniques could
    enhance the genericity of the framework. Angsuchotmetee et al. in [184] offered
    Multimedia Semantic Sensor Network Ontology (MSSN-Onto) to detect various events
    in a HetNet to provide syntactic and semantic interoperability. A multimedia application
    that involves more than one user requires syntactic and semantic interoperability
    to understand different data encoding techniques and content-aware modeling. The
    proposed framework constitutes MSSN indexer, application manager, and event processing
    engine to process and index the data stream concerning their feature levels, and
    serving the queries of the users from the stored, indexed data. Xu et al. proposed
    an attention-in-attention (AIA) network in [185] for multievent recognition and
    representing the salient features of visual modality and semantic modality exploiting
    Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for visual features extraction. AIA comprises
    Encoder Attention Modules (EAM) and Fusion Attention Module (FAM) for desired
    features matching and fuses multi-dimensional features into a single-dimensional
    feature. The authors employed a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based Long Short-Term
    Memory (LSTM) unit on decoding fused data into multi-events labels. Multiple AIA
    modules can enhance event recognition and representations of multimedia video
    streaming. Saha et al. [186] presented a context-aware Block-based Motion Estimation
    (BME) approach to enhance multimedia compression. The author uses the pixel distortion
    ratio to characterize the motion into a Large Diamond Search Pattern (LDSP) or
    Small Diamond Search Pattern (SDSP). The proposed scheme intends to reduce the
    computation time significantly. Parallel processing incorporating GPU and directional
    motion estimation can further augment the performance. Thiyagarajan et al. [39]
    devised energy-aware selective encryption for the high motion video frame. The
    detection of high motion is performed by the texture energy level of the frame
    which is classified by the DC coefficient in Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and
    the motion vector which expresses descriptive information of video magnitude and
    phase angle. The high value of the motion vector indicates high motion activity
    and vice versa. For securing multimedia data and conserving energy in M-IoT, all
    syntax elements of high motion frames are encrypted. However, in low energy frames,
    alternate syntax elements are encrypted. C. Cloud Computing for M-IoT The miniature
    IoT devices and bulky nature of multimedia data necessitate excessively large
    and time-sensitive computation resources. Cloud computing offers computing resources
    in a centralized manner instead of localized computing to augment energy conservation,
    QoS and improves the life expectancy of the M-IoT network. Computing pioneer ‘John
    McCarthy’ speculated cloud computing in 1961 as ‘ computation may someday be organized
    as a public utility’ [187], which raises the question, what exactly cloud computing
    refers to. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defined cloud
    computing in [188] as: “Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand
    network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks,
    servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned
    and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.”
    Cloud computing encompasses five essential elements [189]: 1) On-demand self-service:
    user with urgent requirement of CPU, storage, and software can avail the resources
    without human intervention. 2) Broad network access: the user required computation
    resources are available over the Internet for heterogeneous platforms. 3) Resource
    pooling: similar resources are organized in pools exploiting virtualization to
    serve multiple users. 4) Rapid elasticity: the consumer resource requirements
    vary according to the network condition and application regardless of having any
    knowledge about cloud computation capacity. Therefore cloud servers are flexible
    to address every user. 5) Measured services: The cloud server monitors the resource
    usage of each user through metering capabilities. In addition to these elements,
    the cloud services are categories as; Software as a Service (SaaS): accessing
    application from cloud, Platform as a Service (PaaS): providing application development
    platform as a service, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): providing hardware
    infrastructure i.e., storage, processing servers and network as a service [187]
    as depicted in Fig. 12. The cloud services are deployed in four models; private
    cloud, community cloud, public cloud, and hybrid cloud [189]. In this section
    varied proposed cloud computing schemes for M-IoT have been enlisted. A comprehensive
    study on the integration of cloud computing and IoT has been presented in [190].
    FIGURE 12. Cloud computing services for M-IoT. Cloud services are categorized
    as the platform as a service (PaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), and software
    as a service (SaaS). Cloud services can be studied for M2M and M2H communication.
    Cloud services require a secure and safe connection between device and cloud.
    Show All 1) Multimedia Cloud Computing in IoT The ubiquity of audio processing
    and cameras even in low-end devices increases the audio and visual recognition
    applications. However, due to small size IoT devices, multimedia data processing
    requires additional computational services that are readily available. To cope
    with this issue, the researcher has put forward several remote cloud computing
    scheme for multimedia processing. Renna et al. in [191] presented a framework
    to provide the optimal balance between energy consumption to process the query
    and the cost incurred for cloud computing by incorporating resource consumption
    according to the volume of query which either lies in the idle state or active
    state. Ubiquitous and heterogeneous data generated from the surveillance system
    is transmitted to a centralized processing unit over limited bandwidth incur high
    latency. Ali et al. [192], [193] proposed a cloudlet based, lightweight distributed
    computing framework for IoT video surveillance systems to minimize network latency.
    The cloudlet system brings cloud computation resources closer to the IoT network
    to compute critical and sensitive data in real-time. In this article, face recognition
    is considered as a use case to validate the framework. Cloudlet exists between
    surveillance cameras and the public cloud. Image/video captured by the camera
    is sent to the cloudlet for face recognition and feature extraction, which is
    transmitted to the public cloud for matching and identification purposes. Cloudlet
    is a device with significant storage, CPU, and GPU. Preprocessing the captured
    data before transmitting to the public cloud significantly reduces the network
    latency. DNN based face detection ‘OpenFace’ in real-time video stream and face
    denaturing named ‘RTFace’ technique for privacy and safety has been presented
    in [194]. The proposed algorithm is implemented on cloudlets for speedy and efficient
    face detection and denaturing. Crowdsensing is an important aspect of smart cities
    which provides ease in multimedia data aggregation by exploiting multimedia sensor
    of public mobile phone, wearable devices, and tablets. The acquired data is wirelessly
    transmitted to the cloud in real-time due to the limited storage capacity of the
    devices. Hong et al. [195] addressed three problems in cloud-based video crowdsensing:
    1) optimal transcoding, 2) the optimal data transfer protocol and meta-data selection
    to upload a video over WiFi, 3) camera parameters which require complete video
    lookup. The authors presented three algorithms: Adaptive Transcoding Algorithm
    (ATA) based heuristic algorithm for video representation without quality compromise.
    Protocol Selection Algorithm (PSA) to dynamically select transmission protocol
    by comparing average throughput normalized value achieved from FDT and UDT. Cloud
    Database Algorithm (CDA) based on Field-of-View (FoV) approach to manage videos
    in the cloud database. Authors in [196] devised an analytical framework to serve
    the cloud access request from the access network, core, or edge network by maintaining
    an optimal number of replicas to improve resource utilization. Cloud computing
    for event detection in a video stream and probabilistic future event prediction
    is detailed in [197]. Authors proposed a dynamic programming based framework to
    efficiently allocate bandwidth resources from limited uplink bandwidth based on
    future event predictions to transmit only meaningful information. The results
    show 80% event detection with 97% QoS satisfaction, utilizing 10% of essential
    bandwidth. Wang et al. [198] devised multimedia sensing as a service (MSaaS),
    an energy-efficient framework work to upload multimedia data by prioritizing it
    first and then optimally allocate network resources. The authors exploit the quad-tree
    decomposition algorithm to segregate regular and premium blocks. In this article,
    the truncation based resource allocation optimization problem is formulated. A
    unified resource allocation metric is considered based on Automatic Repeat Request
    (ARQ), channel coding for Forwarding Error Correction (FEC), data rate, transmission
    power and packet length subject to energy-constrained quality optimization. D.
    Fog/Edge Computing For decades cloud computing served as pay-as-you-go, managing
    and providing alternative solutions for data centers and enterprises by providing
    remote storage units, processing units, networks, servers and applications to
    serve multiple customers [199]. Cloud computing flows a centralized processing
    infrastructure which is usually located far from users or IoT proximity. However,
    cloud computing upsurges network overheads by transmitting the aggregated data
    from sensors to the centralized processing cloud and then acquiring back the analyzed
    data over bandwidth, latency, and energy-constrained network. M-IoT network requires
    a model that can handle high velocity, volume, and variety of data with minimum
    latency, conserve bandwidth, reliability, globally secure and chooses the best
    processing unit in the least possible time. In 2012, Cisco introduced and defined
    fog computing as [200]: “The fog extends the cloud closer to the things that produce
    and act on IoT data.” Fog computing is the virtualized platform that offers computation,
    storage units and routing devices between User Equipment (UE) and traditional
    cloud, located at the edge of the network, reducing the response time of the system
    [201]. The fog-cloud hybrid computing architecture process the data in the following
    pattern. Critical time-sensitive and real-time data are processed on the fog node,
    while less critical data that can tolerate minute delay is processed and stored
    on fog gateway node for a few hours. The regular periodic data that is not delay-sensitive
    is sent to the cloud to be processed and stored for offline access [200]. Stojmenovic
    et al. [202] outlined a detailed overview of fog computation applications and
    challenges. The term edge computing also refers to the notion of providing computation
    at the edge of the network. The edge computing is defined as network processing
    and resources progressing between data origin and cloud unit [203]. Detailed edge
    computing architecture and issues are presented in [203]. The smartphone act as
    an edge between the user and the cloud. The processing unit is placed within the
    proximity of data producers to increase energy efficiency, response time, and
    bandwidth allocation optimization. Fog computing is referred to as edge computing.
    However, the difference lies in the location of the computing unit is placed.
    Fog computing is employed at the Local Area Network (LAN) or the gateways of the
    network, whereas edge computing is embedded within the end or edge device, as
    shown in Fig. 13. Linthicum et al. describe edge computing as the concept, while
    fog computing as a protocol to implement edge computing [204]. The authors also
    highlighted the limitations of both the architectures in data computing. Various
    fog and edge computing frameworks, vision, and challenges in the M-IoT network
    are studied and presented in the subsection. FIGURE 13. Fog/Edge computing in
    M-IoT. Fog/Edge devices reduce network overhead and latency by preprocessing the
    acquired multimedia data at Fog/Edge nodes. Fog/Edge devices can be a smartphone,
    network hubs, gateways, routers, and servers. Show All 1) Fog Computing in M-IoT
    Extending the computing closer to the edge or access network raises several issues
    and challenges. Determining and classifying critical multimedia data is necessary
    for load balancing on fog node and the cloud for optimal efficiency. Excessive
    workload on fog node increases the power consumption, causing efficiency degradation.
    Deng et al. [205] formulated a primal problem for maximizing power conservation
    in fog-cloud hybrid systems. Four layered fog-cloud frameworks have been proposed.
    Moreover, the authors decompose the problem into three subproblems by specifying
    the tradeoff between latency and power consumption. The problem is subject to
    various constraints: 1) delay at fog node, 2) Wide Area Network (WAN) communication
    system between fog and cloud server, 3) bandwidth and network overheads at the
    cloud server. Simulation results show that the proposed framework improves latency
    and power consumption for delay-sensitive traffic. Chen et al. [206] devised a
    fog-based video surveillance system to monitor a speedy road traffic system in
    urban areas using a drone camera. The authors proposed a tracking algorithm that
    extracts and transmits image frames of interest to fog node to meet minimum computation
    and delay requirements. The tracking algorithm utilizes Bayes estimation and probabilistic
    Monte Carlo simulations. Yousefpour et al. in [207] presented a fog-cloud hybrid
    generic framework to minimize the service latency by sharing the load among fog
    nodes. The framework considers the queue length and the type of service requested,
    as the different application requires different service time. The Fog layer offers
    collaborative architecture to process a request exploiting the concept of load
    sharing by offloading the service request to neighbor fog nodes. Authors also
    put forward an approach to find the best fog node to process the request in minimum
    time by using a centralized fog node for maintaining a reachability table to offload
    the request to the node which offers minimum service delay. Minimum service delay
    and propagation delay are measured using a recursive analytical process. Simulation
    results depict the proposed model outperforms No Fog Processing (NFP). Ni et al.
    [208] put forward a fog computation resource allocation strategy based on Priced
    Timed Petri Nets (PTPNs) that considers price and time cost of task completion.
    The proposed scheme utilizes a dynamic recursive algorithm for fog resource allocation.
    The authors also presented a probabilistic model to predict the time cost of task
    completion. The framework provides a novel scheme for users to select the resource
    pool that fulfills their requirements. The innovation can still be improved by
    implementing the ML technique to train the system by mapping the nature of services
    with required fog resource and service time. Yang in [209] discussed fog architectures
    for data stream processing in four different applications: 1) IoT stream analytics,
    2) real-time crowdsourcing, 3) network control, 4) event processing. The author
    investigates various issues and challenges in applications focused on real-time
    monitoring and crowdsourcing. The main objective of this architecture is to incorporate
    fog computation in the M-IoT network that augments the network throughput, latency,
    fairness, stability, and reliability. 2) Edge Computing in M-IoT Communication
    between M-IoT devices, edge devices, and cloud incur additional delay if the tasks
    are not properly scheduled. Xu et al. [210] introduced the concept of optimizing
    in-memory processing to reduce the delay and latency of the network. Three-tier
    architecture is proposed to formulate closed-loop feedback scheduling and prioritization
    model to integrate memories of all the edge devices to balance workload allocation.
    Results depict improvement in latencies for M-IoT systems and rational workload
    allocation. Genetics a geo-distributed real-time stream processing for the dynamic
    edge-cloud network is proposed in [211] to achieve low latency by exploiting minimum
    bandwidth allocation and task sharing. A distributed Complex Event Processing
    engine (CEP) for a fully distributed edge IoT network is presented in [212]. CEP
    utilizes both events based and stream-based approaches. The authors proposed a
    heuristic assignment model for task distribution for a balanced workload between
    edge devices and cloud. Results show 6.6 times less data volume flow as compared
    to a centralized framework. Li et al. [213] proposed CNN based deep leaning optimization
    problem to maximize the number of tasks for edge devices subject to limited bandwidth
    and system capacity. The authors aim to reduce the network traffic and overheads
    from M-IoT devices to the cloud. The system is designed for online and offline
    video processing, as video processing is the integration of computer vision and
    image processing. Sharma and Wang [214] devised a collaborative edge-cloud framework.
    The framework utilizes the historic cloud computing data to aid edge computation
    to analyze live data for maintaining QoS. The authors also highlighted the issues,
    challenges, and limitations of both edge and cloud computing. Furthermore, the
    motivation for a collaborative edge-cloud framework is also outlined. Long et
    al. in [215] proposed an edge M-IoT framework to process video on edge devices
    to improve the accuracy of human detection in surveillance systems. The proposed
    framework utilizes D2D communication to transmit the divided and compressed video
    frames to nearby edge nodes that form cooperative groups to process the video
    frames transmitted to them in multicast or unicast fashion. The authors deduced
    that human detection accuracy is positively correlated with the video coding rate
    and formulates an optimization problem to maximize the average video coding rate
    subject to deadline and group formulation constraint. Group formulation problem
    is solved by considering it as Winner Determination Problem (WDP), which states
    that the video chunks are allocated to the group of edge nodes which maximizes
    the overall utility. Simulation results validate that the proposed work outperforms
    no cooperation and an arbitrary model. Elias et al. [216] devised Where’s The
    Bear (WTB), an image processing technique for edge computing based on NN to recognize
    animals in wildlife monitoring systems. The objectives of WTB are to conserve
    bandwidth and improve accuracy. WTB exploits Google TensorFlow for image recognition
    and classification, and OpenCV for analysis. Results show that implementing image
    recognition at the edge of the network where the images are acquired reduces latency
    and conserves bandwidth. E. Software-Defined Networks Several devices are responsible
    for handling network in IoT, such as, routers, switches, and embedded devices.
    These devices are equipped with integrated circuits, that are pre-programmed to
    execute predetermined tasks. Such devices are not reconfigurable with dynamic
    changes in the network to support real-time multitasking. The expected 50 billion
    connected devices could generate 600 ZB annually by 2020 [170]. Transmitting such
    a huge amount of data to the cloud for analysis and processing may lead to developing
    network congestion, which can cause latency and bandwidth issues affecting overall
    QoS and QoE. To cope with this problem, most of the technology giants like Cisco
    and IBM offered to process the data closer to the network’s edge to achieve high
    data rates and low latency. However, edge processing may incur high energy consumption.
    To deal with issues mentioned above a flexible, scalable, reprogrammable, and
    reconfigurable M-IoT architecture is in need to manage multimedia traffic flow
    and data computation to optimize energy consumption and performance. SDN is an
    emerging network technology that offers flexible, interoperable, reconfigurable,
    and reprogrammable network architecture to satisfy dynamic changes in the network.
    SDN compromises network management [217], network virtualization [218], network
    accessibility [219], resource utilization [220], energy management [221], security
    and privacy [222] by segregating network control from hardware devices [223].
    The main objective of the SDN is to decouple the control plane from the data plane
    to rationalize the network. This network device now acts as a Forwarding Device
    (FD), that forwards a sequence of packets from source to destination by regulatory
    policies [224]. The control plane in SDN is a centralized unit while the data
    plane works in a distributed manner. The Telecommunication Management Network
    (TMN) architecture comprises three planes: management, data, and control plane.
    Management plane forms the maintenance and operations unit of the network, i.e.,
    human operators and software that monitors the status, configure and update the
    network. The data plan performs data transmission by following the flow decisions
    of the controller in the control plane. This plane constitutes all the FDs such
    as routers, switches, firewalls, and embedded circuits. The control plane is a
    centralized controller to configure and reprogram the network, for instance, network
    path, routing protocols, network policies according to the application requirements
    [225]. The SDN comprises two Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), i.e.,
    northbound API that is responsible for providing communication between application
    plane and controller, whereas southbound API supports communication between the
    controller and network devices as shown in Fig. 14. This section presents studies
    and proposed schemes associated with multimedia data computation by employing
    SDN. FIGURE 14. The architecture of Software-Defined Networks (SDNs) for multimedia
    computing. SDNs offers scalability, flexibility, reconfigurability, and re-programmability
    for efficient network management. SDNs separates data planes from the control
    plane and provide four APIs. Show All 1) Multimedia Computing in SDN SDNs are
    not specifically introduced for data computing. However, managing the network
    proficiently by SDNs could reduce the computing complexity to yield low latency
    and fewer overheads. Kaur et al. in [226] devised SDN as a middleware in edge-cloud
    hybrid architectures to improve the energy efficiency of the stream processing.
    The framework provides the classification of data flow into batch processing and
    stream processing. Batch processing is more focussed on network service bandwidth
    while stream processing comprehends real-time applications that are latency-sensitive.
    Upon the classification of workflow, network control logic are configured and
    implemented. The authors have formulated multi-objective optimization problems
    for each control logic, which exploits the Tchebycheff decomposition algorithm
    to solve the problems to minimize energy consumption by efficient routing path
    selection and scheduling. Results show that incorporating dynamic network changes
    according to the classified workflow enhances the energy efficiency meeting SLA.
    Salman et al. [227] proposed Software-Defined Mobile Edge Computing (SD-MEC) architecture
    to reduce latency and bandwidth by combining the features of both SDN and edge
    computing. The proposed framework offers scalability by managing the distributed
    edge network with SDN controllers to incorporate network changes and developing
    new services. Wang et al. [228] presented SDN-based-Publish/Subscribe (SDNPS)
    unified framework to serve multiple IoT applications. The presented framework
    aims to reduce the latency and throughput of the network with publishers that
    publish the generated data and offer services tagged with specific event topics
    to SDN. The subscribers that require specific event services receive their desired
    services from SDN based middleware without interaction with the publisher. SDNPS
    leads to a unified, interoperable framework. Baktir et al. [229] detailed the
    limitations and challenges of cloud-edge computing with increasing data traffic
    and proposed a vision of SDN based network management strategy to decrease the
    complexity of cloud-edge architectures. Authors have highlighted several use cases,
    including multimedia data computation in IoT for face detection and revealed the
    benefits of incorporating SDNs to add scalability and reliability in the network.
    A comprehensive survey and future research direction on SDN and fog computing
    is presented by Salman et al. [45]. F. Summary and Insights In this section, the
    limitations of underlying M-IoT architectures for multimedia communication has
    been discussed. Various multimedia encoding and compression techniques to reduce
    the complexity of multimedia data transmission in IoT has been detailed in [43],
    [173]–[182]. Detection, extraction, and event processing of meaningful information
    from multimedia data has been studied in [39], [183]–[186] for efficient network
    resource utilization. The vision of cloud computing and various studies to analysis
    and process multimedia data over the Internet through remote access is present
    in [187]–[198]. Increasing network overheads and the latency due to cloud computing
    has been discussed, the concept of fog\edge computing to minimize network latency
    for real-time applications is discussed in [205]–[216]. The notion of SDNs to
    enhance the scalability and interoperability to support heterogeneous M-IoT devices
    has been explained. Various studies related to SDN based fog\edge-cloud computing
    to reduce computing latency and overheads have been presented in [31], [32], [34],
    [35], [45], [46], [46]–[170]. SDNs, not only provides reconfigurability but also
    offers a more scalable and interoperable architecture. A tabular summarization
    of this section can be seen in Table 7. SECTION VI. Routing Protocols for Multimedia
    in IoT Multimedia data exhibits stringent requirements according to diverse characteristics
    in terms of volume, variety, velocity, and value, especially for efficient bandwidth
    utilization and reliability. The deviation from Moore’s law, multimedia devices
    are now becoming smaller in size, with a decrease in cost and memory to support
    mobility [3]. The current standards and protocols, as shown in Fig. 15, consume
    a significant amount of bandwidth and energy to ensure reliability. These communication
    protocols are not optimized for low power multimedia communication. The current
    standardization activities are not focussed on multimedia communication over IoT.
    ITU defines traffic routing of mobile services in ITU-T Recommendation E.170 [230]
    as: “establishing a successful connection between two exchanges or the selection
    of path between source and sink node in the network.” An intelligent routing protocol
    is in need to select an efficient route for multimedia content transmission over
    bandwidth and memory-constrained wireless IoT network. FIGURE 15. Standards and
    protocols of three layered IoT framework [2]. Show All The scarcity of IPv4 urges
    the recommendation of IPv6 for smart IoT objects. 6LoWPAN is an IP based technology
    for Low-power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) to bridge the gap between low-power devices
    and the IP world [231]. 6LoWPAN compresses IPv6 headers and fragmentation of large
    packets to make IPv6 suitable for resource-constrained devices [232]. International
    Engineering Task Force (IETF) proposed an IPv6 Routing Protocol for LLNs (RPL)
    [233], [234]. RPL is now widely adopted as a promising standard with increasing
    popularity because it offers flexibility and interoperability by adopting different
    network topologies. RPL exploits key network metrics such as throughput, node
    energy, latency, hop count, and link reliability. RPL supports Point-to-Point
    (P2P), Point-to-MultiPoint (P2MP) and MultiPoint-to-Point (MP2P) communication
    paradigm. Kim et al. [18] provided a detailed picture of the research that has
    investigated RPL. The authors presented the distribution of research carried out
    on RPL in the context of the geographical region, operating systems, hardware
    platforms, and network metrics. A plethora of work and survey studies of the IoT
    communication protocols mentioned in Fig. 16 are present in the literature [11],
    [3], [235], [236]. In this section, we have extensively studied routing of multimedia
    content, i.e., audio, image, and video in IoT to meet the stringent requirements
    of multimedia communication in IoT while maintaining QoS and QoE with efficient
    bandwidth and energy utilization. Fig. 16 shows the classification of the existing
    works on multimedia routing in IoT. Cross-layer communication protocol for multimedia
    data routing in IoT has been discussed. Routing protocols for multimedia data
    streaming in a multicast or unicast manner to provide the required QoS has been
    extensively studied. Table 8 tabulates the performance summary and comparison
    of studies on multimedia data routing in IoT. TABLE 8 The Existing Work on M-IoT
    in Context of Multimedia Data Routing FIGURE 16. Existing work on routing protocol
    for M-IoT is classified on their capability to transmit multimedia data in single-hop
    or multi-hop or multicast manner or on the basis of QoS requirements. Show All
    A. Multimedia Data Routing in M-IoT The recent studies on routing protocols for
    M-IoT discuss the transmission of data in varied perspectives, i.e., the transmission
    of audio, image, and video streaming in the context of energy, workload balance,
    fault tolerance and delay in time [17], [237]. 1) Energy-Aware Routing Xu et al.
    [36] proposed EQRoute, an energy-aware, and QoI-aware routing algorithm. The EQRoute
    is a distributed algorithm, designed for ubiquitous multimedia transmission based
    on the information value of data and capacity of the mobile user concerning it’s
    moving speed. In the proposed model, a mobile user constructs the data collection
    tree, based on its capacity and moving speed. The route is selected based on information
    gain, which is calculated in the context of communication cost and information
    value. The aim of the proposed work to maximize information gain and reduce energy
    consumption. Energy harvesting has shifted the design paradigm from energy-aware
    to Energy-Harvesting-Aware (EHA). Nguyen et al. [238] devised the EHA Routing
    Algorithm (EHARA) based on the energy-backoff process and energy prediction process
    that defines cost metrics to select the best route. A hybrid energy harvesting
    sources are considered in the proposed work, i.e., solar panels, moving vehicle-based,
    and RF-based. The energy prediction process utilizes a Kalman filter approach
    that considers previous time step and current statistics to determine an improved
    estimation of current energy arrivals from different sources. The energy backoff
    process is proposed to extend the network lifetime by putting the nodes with minimum
    energy to sleep that are unable to perform operations until the energy level is
    recovered. The node with the highest energy level and minimum cost link based
    on Dijkstra’s shortest path is selected to route the data. Carbon Dioxide (C O
    2 ) emission is one of the vital factors affecting the network or node lifetime
    in green communication. Alvi et al. [15] proposed green-RPL routing for M-IoT
    to route the multimedia data by selecting the parent node operating on green energy
    that consumes minimum energy and delays to the sink. The objective of the green-RPL
    is to minimize carbon footprint subject to path delay, path energy, residual energy,
    and idle time. Trinh et al. in [239] presented SPIDER, a sustainable policy-based
    intelligence-driven edge routing algorithm based on MEC to detect geographical
    obstacles using DL to aid the routing engine to efficiently offload the data and
    route the priority data in an emergency for energy conservation. The proposed
    work presents a facial recognition use case in a disaster scenario. 2) Load Balancing
    Packet loss due to heavy traffic and power depletion are two main reasons for
    network congestion. Taghizadeh et al. in [240] address these problems by proposing
    Context-aware and Load balancing RPL (CLPRL). The proposed work offers Context-Aware
    Objective Function (CAOF) and Context-Aware Routing metric (CARF) to improve RPL.
    CAOF ranks the nodes for the selection of a parent node based on the residual
    power level of the node and the Expected Transmission Count (ETX). After ranking,
    CARF takes the buffer queue utilization, node rank and network traffic dynamicity
    index that indicates the utilization of link in the past, to compute the route
    during heavy traffic conditions. The authors ensure the load balancing by considering
    the number of children node with a parent from the list of candidate parent nodes
    for parent selection. It helps in load balancing even if a node is eligible to
    be a parent node, but a large number of children node can create loops and network
    congestion. 3) Fault-Tolerant The miniature multimedia sensors are equipped with
    limited battery power. The exhaustion of the battery leads to network failure.
    Lin et al. [241] proposed a fault-tolerant routing for Cluster Head based (CH)
    HetNets. The proposed scheme addresses three problems that are the pre-verifying
    the fault-tolerant capability, distributing the load and optimizing the fault-tolerant
    cost. These problems are dealt with by the sink node with a virtual CH approach
    that estimates all the traffic in the network and verifies the sustainability
    of IoT application. Virtual CH combines all the energy resources of non-failure
    CHs, estimates the size of sensed data to be transmitted and verify the capability
    of tolerance offered by non-failure CHs in the network. After which an optimal
    fault-tolerant route is determined from the flow-bipartite graph that represents
    all the possible routes between faulty and non-faulty CHs. 4) Delay-Aware Multimedia
    data poses delay-sensitive characteristics. Dropping priority and meaningful multimedia
    data packets decrease the reliability of the application. Li et al. in [242] proposed
    mobile sensing vehicles for multimedia data collection to optimize delay and delivery
    ratio (DDSV). Mobile vehicles equipped with IoT devices are exploited to deliver
    data to and from multimedia IoT devices to data centers. The proposed work addresses
    three problems in the context of multimedia data packets that are data collection
    impartiality, delivery ratio, and delay. DDSV proposes priority assignment based-upon
    distance from the data center to overcome data collection impartiality. The vehicle
    with a high probability to pass through a data center is given high priority to
    deliver high priority data packets, which will augment delivery ratio and reduces
    delay in return. Performance is evaluated in the context of delivery ratio and
    average delay for data collection. 5) Mobility Mobility is one of the key requirements
    of rapidly evolving multimedia IoT applications. However, the majority of research
    has ignored mobility. Jeong et al. in [243] proposed MAPLE, a routing architecture
    based on mobility support Asymmetric Transmit Power (ATP) for LLNs. MAPLE utilizes
    a single high power periodic beacon in the downlink from the gateway to create
    a Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) gradient field network. Any low power
    node can route the data for uplink transmission in a multi-hop manner using the
    RSSI gradient values of neighboring nodes. High RSSI value indicates high proximity
    to the gateway. Each high power beacon updates the RSSI gradient metric for uplink
    routing, which addresses the mobility problem, improves reliability and reduces
    the overheads in the network. MAPLE also reduces energy consumption because of
    single high power downlink transmission using ATP architecture. B. QoS Aware Routing
    QoS-aware frameworks to route wireless multimedia data in IoT network for bandwidth-hungry
    and delay-sensitive applications have been taken into consideration. The definition
    and requirements of the QoS-aware framework have been discussed in the earlier
    section. Below is the description of some of the QoS-aware routing protocols to
    support multimedia communication in IoT. 1) Cluster-Based QoS-Aware Routing Amjad
    et al. in [244] proposed centralized energy-efficient QoS-aware and Heterogeneously
    Clustered Routing (QHCR) for delay-sensitive real-time applications. The network
    area is divided into different energy levels, and Cost Values ( C v) that are
    determined based on distance from the Base Station (BS), initial energy levels,
    number of nodes, and weights. The cluster head is elected on it’s C v. The shortest
    path to the destination is selected based on path metric that is the combination
    of the initial energy of node, ETX, and inverse ETX, cost value of cluster head
    and minimum loss with QoS as a constraint. The proposed model offers intra-cluster
    multipath communication for the nodes that are at a significant distance from
    BS. Real-time multimedia and non-real-time data are transmitted over separate
    paths to reduce end-to-end delay and conserve energy. Filho and Amazonas [245]
    devised a QoS-aware routing protocol to eliminate the need for a routing table.
    The proposed scheme is based on a Trellis Coded Network (TCNet) utilizing a Mealy
    Machine (MM) or Finite State Machine (FSM). QoS is maintained using MultiProtocol
    Label Switching (MPLS). 2) SDN Based QoS-Aware Routing Bahnasse et al. in [246]
    devised QoS-aware SDN based smart and dynamic model to allocate bandwidth (Smart
    Alloc) for MPLS Traffic Engineering DiffServ Aware (DS-TE) network. The proposed
    architecture translates the QoS requirements of an application into commands that
    indicates bandwidth and priority requirements. The SLA of each application is
    detected in terms of delay, loss rate, jitter, HTTP load time, and TCP session
    delay, and threshold values are set. Smart-alloc adaptively allocates the bandwidth
    according to the status of SLA. Sway, an SDN based QoS-aware routing protocol
    for delay-sensitive and loss-sensitive application, is presented in [247]. Sway
    exploits Yen’s K-shortest path algorithm to compute traffic-aware (delay-sensitive
    or loss-sensitive) best routing path while considering QoS requirements for each
    packet. Multi-constrained QoS metrics are considered that are the delay, packet
    loss probability, and bandwidth. Integer linear programming is utilized to solve
    a multi-constrained QoS-aware route. 3) Distributed QoS-Aware Routing Shih et
    al. [248] devised a meta routing protocol for QoS-aware architectures to select
    the optimum path between gateways of HetNets. Gateways are registered in the network
    by broadcasting messages comprising the information of all the network interfaces.
    Nodes in each network update their table with the addresses of reachable network
    gateways and interfaces. The optimum path is selected by measuring QoS metrics
    of each gateway link that is timeliness and reliability. When the QoS requirement
    is not satisfied, the meta-router will transmit data on multiple paths to achieve
    maximum QoS. C. Cross-Layer Protocols for Multimedia Routing Rani et al. [37]
    proposed a cross-layer protocol to minimize energy consumption and response time.
    The authors formulated a multi-objective optimization problem to minimize the
    end-to-end packet error rate, time, and energy. These parameters are interlinked
    and dependant on cross-layer parameters such as path loss, modulation scheme,
    BER, transmission power, ARQ, duty cycling, and network routing protocol. The
    optimization of these parameters requires cross-layer communication and coordination.
    Authors exploit the Minimum Energy consumption Chain-Based Cluster Coordination
    Algorithm (ME-CBCCP) presented in [249], which finds the shortest path not only
    at the local cluster level but also takes the intercluster path into consideration.
    Bennis et al. [33] devised Efficient Queuing Multimedia (EQM), a cross-layer communication
    protocol for transmitting multimedia data over wireless networks. A carrier sense
    aware disjoint multipath routing protocol is presented to transmit high priority
    independent video frames by reserving 2-hops neighbor nodes for video frames.
    The routing layer coordinates with the MAC layer to be aware of priority video
    data. An enqueuing and dequeuing approach is presented to process high priority
    multimedia data first and scalar data at the last of the queue. The proposed work
    aims to reduce waiting for the time and energy consumption of wireless networks.
    Rosario et al. [250] proposed LinGO, QoE aware link quality and geographical beaconless
    opportunistic routing protocol for video transmission in IoT. Forwarding node
    selection and routing path are determined according to cross-layer parameters
    that are: 1) link quality indicator classified by packet reception ratio, 2) progress
    which is the Euclidian distance between forwarding node to the destination, 3)
    energy of the forwarding node. The proposed model increases the reliability by
    adding redundancy packets for high priority video packets which improve QoE. Devi
    et al. [38] proposed an agent-based cross-layer protocol for optimal path selection
    and reducing end-to-end delay to transmit important multimedia data with minimum
    latency. The proposed model exploits the agents to transmit the data when the
    channel consumes more time than a threshold time. Hassan et al. [251] presented
    a cross-layer framework to ensure QoS satisfaction. A channel access mechanism
    based on queuing model M/M/1 is formulated for the duty cycle to handle the packets
    of real-time applications. The impact of multi-hop communication is analyzed using
    PHY-MAC parameters that are transmission power, hop distance, path loss, and packet
    error ratio (PER) for adaptive switching between end-to-end transmission or hop-by-hop
    transmission scheme. D. Multicast and Hop-Count Based Routing Routing protocols
    for multimedia bandwidth-hungry and real-time applications of M-IoT have been
    designed based on multicast and hop-count metric [252]. A detailed survey on multipath
    routing protocols of M-IoT to ensure QoS parameters has been presented in [19].
    Below-mentioned are few studies in the context of multicast and multi-hop routing
    protocols of M-IoT. 1) Multicast Routing Multimedia real-time critical applications
    require the network to guarantee multiple QoS metrics that are maximum throughput,
    minimum delay, and minimum PLR. Multimedia communication requires multicast routing
    with minimum end-to-end latency for delay-sensitive health applications. A Fast
    Multiconstrained Multicast Routing Algorithm (FAMOUS) is proposed in [14]. The
    proposed routing scheme is based on Shortest Path Algorithm (SPT) and Minimum
    Steiner Tree (MST) algorithm. Authors exploit entropy-based weight aggregation
    to reduce multicriteria decision problems into a single criterion problem. The
    objective of FAMOUS is to determine the shortest path and optimal multicast tree
    from source to destination for better accuracy and speed. Aswale and Ghorpade
    in [253] presented Energy and ETX Aware Multipath Geographic Routing (EEMGR) protocol.
    ETX is a link quality metric that estimates the number of transmissions required
    to deliver a packet from source to destination successfully. EEMGR exploits ETX,
    node remaining energy and distance between a node to sink to determine the optimal
    path for reliable and energy-efficient multimedia routing. Performance comparison
    is made with the Two-Phase Geographic Greedy Forwarding (TPGF) algorithm. 2) Multi-Hop
    Routing The real-time multimedia applications demand a probability of zero percent
    delay violation. A cooperative relaying model incorporating Cognitive M2M Network
    (CM2MN) is proposed in [254] for effective end-to-end QoS. Probabilistic forwarding
    protocol (PFP) based on a network-aware routing algorithm for multi-hop routing
    is presented. Cooperative Quality Controller (CQC) is formulated to guarantee
    QoS requirements. The opportunistic relay selection as a routing extension is
    based on the M/M/1 queueing model with First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) strategy.
    Chen et al. [255] presented Multipath Planning for the Single source (MPSS) and
    Multiple Sources (MPMS) for multimedia transmission in IoT. The proposed work
    is based on B-spline trajectories. MPSS comprises two units that are the calculation
    of the hop count module, which determines the number of hops required to satisfy
    QoS delay and energy-saving module that determines the minimum power required
    to deliver the data successfully. Utilizing spline trajectories, the source can
    determine the direction of next-hop by integrating parametric functions for geographical
    routing. The aim is to determine multiple paths that satisfy QoS with minimum
    energy consumption. The optimum path with the least energy consumption is selected.
    The performance of the system is evaluated based on end-to-end delay and energy
    consumption. Chen et al. in [256] devised a Trusted Connectivity Probability (TCP)
    based D2D relay selection model for routing data in a multi-hop manner. A ranking
    model is adapted to select the next-hop node with the highest rank. Rank is allotted
    based on Trust Probability (TP) that depends on the geographical distance between
    the current and next-hop nodes. An optimization problem is formed to select the
    optimal route with maximum TCP. The problem is solved with the help of the Dijkstra
    algorithm that determines the TCP value from a source node to all the nodes in
    the network. The model offers the D2D communication in both Channel State Information
    (CSI) aware and unknown condition to calculate the minimum power required to transmit
    between D2D device and BS. E. Summary and Insights In this section, routing protocols
    for M-IoT has been discussed. The existing research presents the routing protocols
    from the perspective of energy-awareness, load balancing, fault tolerance, mobility,
    delay awareness [257]. QoS–aware routing [258] for multimedia data is investigated
    and presented in [244]–[248]. Cross-layer protocols to improve routing strategies
    in terms of energy, delay, throughput, and reliability [259] have been presented
    in [37], [33], [249]–[251]. Challenges and issues in multicasting [260] and hop-count
    based routing schemes have been discussed in [252]–[256]. However, to support
    multimedia bandwidth-hungry and delay-sensitive applications, cross-layer and
    energy-aware protocols need to be explored in detail. The existing studies on
    multimedia routing protocols do not consider efficient bandwidth utilization and
    fault tolerance. Lightweight and energy efficient ML algorithms like reinforcement
    learning, Q-learning, Epsilon greedy are yet to be investigated for latency reduction
    and improve power conservation for multimedia routing in IoT. Table 8 presents
    a detailed overview of this section, classifying each study and highlighting it’s
    key features. SECTION VII. PHY-MAC Protocols for M-IoT The network protocol stack
    of the IoT architecture rests on the joint PHY-MAC layer as depicted in Fig. 16.
    The protocols under this layer, feature low power operations and guarantee a stringent
    QoS compliant performance. The discussion of the M-IoT applications in the preceding
    sections indicates a general guideline for the design of the PHY-MAC protocols.
    These guidelines include an ability to manage a dense, as well as a sparse network,
    with a small network overhead, over a wide range and with a low energy requirement
    [261]. The applicability of M-IoT in the wide range of applications like industrial
    monitoring, healthcare, security, and smart services in smart city applications
    implies that there are multiple QoS and QoE parameters for each application. Additionally,
    the heterogeneity of the devices in the network creates a set of challenges in
    terms of interoperability. That results in a need for application-oriented data
    transformations at the network gateway [262]. Therefore, the PHY-MAC layer for
    each application is designed to fulfill these QoS and QoE parameters. This section
    discusses the different MAC-PHY standards and protocols designed for specific
    applications. The major standard in use today is the IEEE 802.15.4 that covers
    the physical layer specifications for the global application. It forms the basis
    of the ZigBee standard that is usually used in the smart living IoT scenarios.
    Additionally, the IEEE 802.15.6 standard is defined for the healthcare scenarios.
    The other standards used for specific application cases are BLE, Long Range Wide
    Area Network (LoRaWAN), NB-IoT, and Near Field Communication (NFC). These provide
    the physical layer as well as MAC specifications for the M-IoT networks. The IEEE
    802.15.4 family of Low Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks (LR-WPANs) was first
    approved in 2003 [263]. Since then, several amendments have been made to the standard.
    There have been numerous region-specific amendments as well as application-specific
    amendments in the 2003 approved standard. The features of the PHY-MAC standards,
    along with the amendments, are tabulated in Table 9. This standard supports both,
    a star topology as well as a peer-to-peer topology. The MAC layer resides above
    the PHY layer in the OSI model and provides an interface between the PHY and the
    higher layers [263], [264]. The MAC specifications for the IEEE 802.15.4 (2003
    release) envisages the use of a Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collison Avoidance
    (CSMA/CA) mechanism for Channel Access. The CSMA/CA supports the beaconed mode
    as well as the non-beaconed mode [265], [266]. The CSMA/CA mechanism for this
    standard and the IEEE 802.11 differs due to the absence of a request to send/clear
    to send (RTS/CTS) frame exchange in the IEEE 802.15.4 family. TABLE 9 Description
    of PHY-MAC Standards and Amendments Additionally, in the IEEE 802.15.4a-2007 amendment,
    the ALOHA is used for the channel access for the Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) [267].
    The 802.15.4 standard serves as the PHY-MAC standard for a large range of applications
    which requires a unique approach to each problem such as in industrial systems.
    Additional applications include multimedia surveillance, traffic management, advanced
    healthcare, and environmental monitoring [268]. Therefore, the focus of this section
    remains the IEEE 802.15.4 standard as most of the M-IoT scenarios are operated
    by this standard. The application-oriented PHY-MAC approaches are discussed under
    the following sub-headings. A. Existing Work on M-IoT Applications in the Context
    of PHY-MAC Protocols 1) Industrial Applications The IEEE 802.15.4 standard has
    been identified as a suitable technology for industrial applications owing to
    the features it offers in this domain such as support for a peer-to-peer topology
    and beaconing in the MAC protocol. The different beacon intervals for the IEEE
    802.15.4 superframes leads to a scheduling problem in the network. Toscano and
    Bello [269] present a solution for the scheduling problems in the multichannel
    networks. The key concept underlying the Multichannel Superframe Scheduling (MSS)
    algorithm is utilizing the maximum superframe duration to determine the length
    of the timeslice and to schedule all the superframes within the same timeslice
    on different channels [269]. The experimental results reveal the beacons are perfectly
    aligned, and through the tracking of the parents, the synchronization is maintained.
    This is not feasible in the time-division approach. Chen et al. [270] present
    a case for the use of IEEE 802.15.4 in the industrial scenario. The experimental
    evaluation of the standard is carried out in the OMNET++/INET framework that tests
    the large scale deployment of the nodes in an industrial setup. The node energy
    efficiency and the goodput support the argument for industrial applications. The
    Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) approach is used with the Guaranteed Time
    Slot (GTS) that enhances reliability. The authors in [271] also propose a GTS
    based real-time messaging service in the industrial environment. Kim et al. in
    [272] allow a periodic synchronization of the node network clocks using Enhanced
    Beacons (EBs). The synchronization allows efficient scheduling in the proposed
    Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TISH) mode. The overall result is the reduction
    in energy consumption and traffic collisions compliant with industrial standards.
    2) Healthcare Applications Healthcare is one of the most important applications
    of M-IoT. The PHY-MAC layer for the healthcare applications is designed taking
    under consideration, the QoS parameters like low latency and high data integrity
    [273]. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard has been successfully used for healthcare applications.
    However, a new standard from IEEE 802.15.6 was approved in 2012 for wireless body
    area networks (WBANs). The IEEE 802.15.4 supports a large range for monitoring
    the complete health status of the user. One of the primary concerns with regards
    to the healthcare applications in the M-IoT scenario is prolonging the lifetime
    of the nodes. The nodes may be surgically implanted. Thus, it becomes imperative
    that the nodes have a large battery lifetime to prolong its use without causing
    inconvenience to the user. Fahmi et al. [274] provide a fuzzy logic-based sleep
    scheduling algorithm. This algorithm aims at optimizing the sleep schedule of
    the nodes and introducing an adaptive sleeping mechanism. The fuzzy logic uses
    an inference table that has a set of 81 rules to govern the sleeping times. The
    energy savings are significant, which are reflected in the experimental results.
    An intrinsic challenge faced by wireless networks is that of coexistence with
    multiple wireless networks. The WBAN based M-IoT networks also face a similar
    challenge, particularly in the IEEE 802.15.4 network. Deylami and Deylami [275]
    have presented an evaluation of the coexisting IEEE 802.15.4 based networks for
    health monitoring applications. The coexistence of multiple networks results in
    loss of data that may be critical, especially in the time divided slot approach
    and GTS based mechanisms. Therefore, a dynamic mechanism for resynchronizing the
    network clock according to the network coordinator is required. To evaluate the
    security of the network by analyzing the efficient usage of the bandwidth, authors
    in [276] foresee an exploitation attack on the contention period during the MAC
    layer operation. The mechanism to remedy the problem is required to enhance the
    reliability of the system, which is the paramount QoS parameter. This includes
    an intelligent backoff mechanism that offers a fair chance during the Contention
    Access Period (CAP). 3) Multimedia Content Streaming Including Surveillance The
    development of the advanced and cost-efficient Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor
    (CMOS) sensors has led to the widespread growth of visual and audio content across
    many platforms. Its impact is profound in the IoT domain as well and has led to
    the development of the Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSNs) [277]. These
    WMSNs have found their application in surveillance and telemedicine. The constraints
    these networks face are in terms of computing power, energy supply, and memory.
    Additionally, they struggle with limited channel bandwidth and variable capacity.
    Lin et al. [278] propose a system to mitigate the challenges of the limited network
    capabilities in the multimedia framework. This involves a dynamic scheme to adjust
    the beaconing interval and the superframe duration. This dynamic approach helps
    in the network synchronization and efficient scheduling, thus, resulting in enhanced
    transmission efficiency. The proposed method is effective for a dynamic data load,
    as well. Pham et al. [279] have presented an evaluation of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard
    for the image transmission applications real deployment scenarios. The evaluation
    is a representative of the Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART)
    and Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) based boards for surveillance. The authors
    present a compression scheme for Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) format
    image data as well as a block interleaving scheme that enhances the reconstructive
    accuracy after encoding the images. The authors identify the possible bottlenecks
    that induce higher latency. 4) Military Applications Mendes et al. [280] propose
    a cross-layer and cross standard methodology for an improved surveillance system
    in a military application. The proposed method involves support for the multimedia
    sensors as well as auxiliary sensors for improved enemy movement detection. The
    proposed method involves the superframe synchronization for improved transmission
    reliability by allowing cross-standard compatibility between the IEEE 802.15.4
    and IEEE 802.15.3 standard. The reliability is the key performance indicator for
    the applications. 5) Precision Agriculture The implications of M-IoT in the agricultural
    field are immense. The data rates for the various metrics that are sensed vary
    greatly amongst each other. Additionally, the priority of each data is different,
    so the channel access mechanism has to adapt accordingly. Kone et al. [281] propose
    a fine-tuned MAC layer for precision agricultural applications in the IEEE 802.15.4
    standard. Precision agriculture is closely monitored and controlled agricultural
    practice. The proposed method involves the selection of optimal values for the
    sampling frequency based on the recorded parameter. Additionally, the MAC parameters
    like the minimum value of the backoff exponent as well as the maximum number of
    backoffs. The proposed method demonstrates the increased sampling frequency for
    applications that require higher resolution, thus, improving the granularity.
    B. ZigBee Standard ZigBee is another standard that is used in the M-IoT scenario.
    It is particularly utilized in the consumer electronics sphere for home automation.
    However, the ZigBee and IEEE 802.15.4 can be used interoperably. Some applications
    with higher security requirements utilize ZigBee while coexisting with the IEEE
    802.15.4 standard. Han and Lim [282] explore such a scenario. The authors present
    a planned overview of automated systems for efficiently deploying smart living
    systems. C. IEEE 802.11 Standard Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
    created the first standard for Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN). The standards
    in the IEEE 802.11 family are also known as Wi-Fi. These standards provide PHY
    and MAC protocols for M-IoT devices. The key characteristics of this standard
    can be seen in Table 9. From the day first, WLANs have been facing the challenge
    of efficient MAC layer resource allocation while accessing the channel [283].
    CSMA/CA is one of the popular collision avoidance mechanisms used by the MAC layer.
    In CSMA/CA, a randomized backoff mechanism is performed by the devices before
    accessing the channel resources. However, a blind exponential increase and reset
    of contention values in this backoff mechanism induce performance degradation.
    Ali et al. proposed solutions in [284]–[286] to tackle the blindness of currently
    implemented CSMA/CA. Their proposed channel observation-based mechanisms adaptively
    increase and decrease the contention parameters. Besides, ML-based techniques
    have been playing a vital role in the performance optimization of MAC layer resource
    allocation mechanisms [287]. Such ML-enabled techniques are also utilized for
    other low-power energy-constrained networks of IoT applications, such as smart
    healthcare systems [288]. In the context of M-IoT, an ML-enabled distributed channel
    access (MEDCA) mechanism is proposed in [289]. The proposed MEDCA mechanism utilizes
    Q learning algorithm to optimize the performance of channel access in multimedia-based
    WLANS (that is IEEE 802.11e). D. Narrow-Band IoT NB-IoT is one of the Low Power
    Wide Area (LPWA) technologies released by the 3rd Generation Partnership (3GPP).
    It is designed for heterogeneous IoT devices to achieve improved spectrum efficiency,
    extended, and in-depth coverage. The key feature of NB-IoT is that it can be directly
    deployed in the Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) or LTE spectrum [290].
    However, the NB-IoT device has to continuously monitor the data transmission channel
    for service announcements and updates that waste energy resources. Tsoukaneri
    et al. [291] present an NB-IoT communication approach that dynamically creates
    a group of devices that are subscribed to receive multimedia services in a multicast
    transmission. To enhance the coverage area, the repetition of control and data
    transmission signals has been considered. The Adaptive Coding and Modulation (ACM)
    scheme and repetition numbers are in need of link adaption for NB-IoT systems.
    However, traditional link adaption techniques without repetition numbers are not
    applicable to NB-IoT systems. Yu et al. [292] proposed an inner loop and outer
    loop link adaption that copes with block error ratio and coordination between
    ACM and repetition numbers. The direct communication link between user and BS
    usually does not satisfy QoS for transmitting vital data. Li et al. [64] exploit
    D2D communication as an opportunistic communication with improved link quality
    to upload critical data to BS. The proposed optimization aims to improve end-to-end
    delay and packet delivery ratio. NB-IoT is an emerging technology that yet needs
    to be explored in-depth for deployment. E. Bluetooth Low Energy BLE is also known
    as Bluetooth Smart was introduced in Bluetooth 4.0. BLE is a short-range PHY-MAC
    communication protocol for low power battery operated devices [293]. BLE is mostly
    used for scalar parametric monitoring applications. Multimedia communication using
    BLE has not been yet investigated in-depth in IoT, as BLE is only suitable for
    a small chunk of data. Gentili et al. [24] proposed BlueVoice, an application
    for voice communication over BLE. However, results in the proposed study have
    not been compared with other PHY-MAC protocols. F. Long Range Wide Area Network
    LoRaWAN developed by LoRa Alliance is another LPWA communication standard that
    provides PHY-MAC protocol for IoT applications. LoRaWAN utilizes LoRa modulation
    based on Chrip Spread Spectrum (CSS) and ALOHA medium access mechanism. To the
    best of our knowledge, no substantial work has been done in M-IoT exploiting LoRaWAN.
    G. Summary and Insights The PHY-MAC layer is responsible for the resource allocation
    and management of hardware and networking resources. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard
    is the most widely utilized standard for the M-IoT deployment. The various authors
    present solutions for improving reliability and reducing the delay by synchronizing
    the network clocks periodically. The MAC protocols are modified according to the
    application QoS. Various proposed work on PHY-MAC protocols mentioned in Table
    9 has been presented in this section. ML and DL based resource allocation and
    management techniques are yet to be explored for M-IoT applications. Security
    is another critical challenge in the wireless medium. Efficient authentication,
    authorization, and validation technique are required for critical M-IoT. Table
    10 classifies and summarizes this section. TABLE 10 Existing Work on PHY-MAC Protocols
    for M-IoT Applications SECTION VIII. Future Research Directions In spite of the
    plethora of research activities and incredible progress in recent years, M-IoT
    still possesses many open issues that are still waiting to be resolved. The main
    goal of M-IoT includes carrying out multimedia communication with maximum QoE
    in terms of packet delivery ratio, throughput, and extending network lifetime
    while minimizing energy expenditure and preventing connectivity degradation. These
    goals can be achieved by employing efficient data aggregation, interoperable and
    scalable architecture, efficient feature extraction, intelligent routing, and
    adaptive MAC protocols, and managing energy while maximizing computing. Additionally,
    there are restrictions on IoT devices to be miniscule with the capability of mobility
    and multiple communication interfaces. Therefore, there are extensive research
    issues that should further be explored in the field of M-IoT. Fig. 17 depicts
    the major areas that demand novel contributions and innovations. In this section,
    a wide range of research issues are delineated for future exploration. FIGURE
    17. Overview of the open issues, challenges, and future research directions for
    M-IoT systems. Show All A. Interoperable and Scalable Architecture M-IoT requires
    redefined efficient network architecture to offer scalability and interoperability
    for multiple multimedia heterogeneous devices while considering the spectrum scarcity
    and limited power resources. SDN based middleware is extensively studied with
    regard to software-defined IoT architectures [294], [295]. SDNs addresses the
    hardware and reconfigurability limitations of IoT devices [296]. Publish/subscribe
    is a communication mechanism for distributed IoT systems [297], [298]. In the
    publish/subscribe model, the user does not have to be in direct contact with the
    service provider. Software-defined publish/subscribe based agents for M-IoT architecture
    offers new opportunities to add scalability and interoperability in the network
    [299]. However, no dedicated work has been done to devise SDN based publish/subscribe
    M-IoT architecture. There is a need to explore SDNs in the context of standardizing
    M-IoT architecture. B. Feature Extraction Multimedia devices generate a huge amount
    of data that comprise structured and unstructured data. The processing of such
    amount of unstructured data over an energy-constrained network requires the transmission
    of only meaningful information. An Intelligent feature extraction mechanism is
    required to identify and classify multimedia data with minimum energy consumption
    [300], [301]. DL addresses the limitations of ML to process a huge amount of data
    [302]. DL offers proficient multimedia feature extraction models [303], [304].
    Extracting semantic from multimedia data could transform unstructured data into
    structured, indexed data for efficient processing [305]. Implementing DL over
    SDNs and adding semantics to multimedia data are yet to be explored for intelligent
    multimedia feature extractions. C. Data Prioritization Prioritizing multimedia
    data addresses a lot of issues related to energy [306], scheduling [307], video
    streaming [308], memory [309], improving PLR, enhancing QoS [310], security [311],
    and reduce network latency [312]. A large number of M-IoT applications mentioned
    in the previous sections are real-time delay-sensitive that require multimedia
    data prioritization. Multimedia applications require ubiquitous transmission for
    which AI-based data classification and priority optimization in M-IoT should be
    extensively studied concerning the requirements of the application. D. Event Processing
    Events are defined as real-world occurrences that reveal over space and time.
    A huge volume of event content is being captured in multimedia, of which YouTube
    videos, TV shows, and animations cover 60% of the Internet traffic [313]. The
    tremendous increase in real-life events captured in multimedia requires event
    analysis to associate metadata with events for efficient query processing. Event
    detection [314], feature representation [315], and adding semantics [316], is
    known as event mining [317]. An intelligent event mining in audio, videos, and
    images are required in M-IoT for efficient resource utilization to process the
    required service with minimum delay. E. Compression and Encoding/Decoding Techniques
    for M-IoT M-IoT necessitates compression techniques to become more vigorous with
    low complexity and to produce low bandwidth output while adhering to limited network
    and spectrum resources. Compression techniques are extensively studied in the
    context of multimedia transmission over wireless networks in [318], [319]. However,
    no enthusiastic work has been done on compression or encoding techniques for the
    transmission of multimedia data over the M-IoT network. There is a need to explore
    the coding methodologies related to multimedia services in M-IoT while considering
    the power and interface constraints. F. Computation Related Issues The difference
    between multimedia data and scalar data has been shown in Table 1. Processing
    and analysis of such high power consumption, and processing data requires efficient
    computing models for minimizing the network overheads and energy consumptions
    [320]. Multimedia processing is dependant on multiple factors, i.e., feature extraction,
    prioritization, network coding, compression, efficient routing, and MAC protocols.
    The limitation of cloud computing and compensation offered by Fog/Edge computing
    is detailed in the previous sections [321]. However, minimal work has been performed
    in SDNs as multimedia computing in IoT. Due to the diverse nature of multimedia
    applications, applications dependent software-defined computing architectures
    are required to offer interoperability in HetNets. To increase network throughput
    with minimum energy utilization, the intelligent transmission of only meaningful
    information to cloud and fog/edge is required for processing. G. QoE Related Research
    Direction User satisfaction of multimedia content in M-IoT is measured by exploiting
    QoE subjective metrics. Recent studies of QoE evaluation for M-IoT applications
    are conducted with primary QoE metrics that are packet loss, MOS, DMOS, and user
    satisfaction. Other QoE metrics such as buffering time, data rate, interruption
    time, and failure rate should also be used for evaluation of M-IoT (as discussed
    in [322]). Most of the work on M-IoT considers network performance metrics (QoS
    metrics) that are jitter, end-to-end delay, bit error rate, and frame loss. Both
    QoS and QoE metrics should be jointly evaluated to achieve better multimedia quality
    and network services [323]. H. Security and Privacy The transmission of bandwidth-hungry
    and delay-sensitive multimedia applications over the scares spectrum requires
    protection from eavesdroppers and threats. Confidential industrial and health
    multimedia data needs P2P, MP2P, and P2MP encryption. Very partial research has
    been conducted on securing multimedia transmission over the IoT network [324],
    [325]. There are several threats that compromise the user’s data and privacy [58].
    New approaches should be adopted to secure the network from any attack. Multimedia
    is content-based data [75]. However, content-aware secure transmission of multimedia
    data over M-IoT has not been studied. The authentic distribution of multimedia
    content is also required to verify legal copyrights. The miniature M-IoT devices
    are computational and energy-constrained. Thus, lightweight data cryptography
    is required for secure communication. AI offers to secure multimedia data at the
    cost of high power consumption due to complex algorithms, that are not feasible
    to implement on IoT devices [326], [327]. Fog/Edge enables IoT devices to perform
    computationally better and faster. Fog/Edge offers to implement blockchain-based
    secure and transparent systems [328], [329]. However, security issues related
    to multimedia data has not been explored in detail. I. Energy-Aware and Green
    Communication Energy is a scarce resource. Bandwidth and power-hungry multimedia
    applications require vast energy resources for their transmission. Thus, to transmit
    multimedia data over IoT, energy-aware and energy harvesting methods need to be
    explored. There are many energy harvesting solutions for harvesting energy from
    the environment. These solutions can assist in prolonging network life and promoting
    green communication [330]. SDNs provide a better softwarization and virtualization
    approach to manage hybrid energy resources in future communication networks [331].
    To the best of our knowledge, SDNs are not studied for energy harvesting approaches
    to transmit multimedia content over the IoT network. J. Routing and MAC Related
    Issues The routing and MAC layer protocols for M-IoT exploit QoS metrics to make
    their routing or medium access decisions. Cross-layer protocols provide multi-layer
    metrics for better decisions to select route and access medium for multimedia
    data in a wireless network [332], [333]. Cross-layer metrics evaluation for user
    satisfaction of multimedia data (QoE) has not been thoroughly explored [334].
    Selecting route and medium by evaluating cross-layer and mapping them with the
    user’s QoE will enhance the performance and lifetime of the M-IoT network. D2D
    communication provides an efficient routing and medium access extension for the
    delivery of multimedia content in a smart city [335]–[337]. Due to bandwidth scarcity
    and delay the urgency of multimedia data, D2D supports a proficient mechanism
    to reduce PLR, latency, and power consumption [338]. D2D communication as a routing
    and medium extension can be investigated for M-IoT. Lightweight ML algorithms
    like reinforcement learning do not consume a significant amount of energy. IoT
    devices equipped with these ML approaches for efficient route and medium selection.
    DL learning algorithms could be implemented on edge devices to extract multimedia
    features and map them with routing and MAC metrics to achieve better user’s QoE
    of multimedia content in IoT. To the best of our knowledge, no substantial amount
    of work has been proposed in this domain. K. Multimedia Applications and Smart
    City M-IoT applications support a wide variety of applications, assisting in building
    a smart city by providing varied networks and architectures [339], [340]. These
    applications contribute a major portion in the industry, agriculture, road management
    systems, and security (as discussed comprehensively in section III). However,
    work to secure and authenticate voice assistant systems has not been studied.
    The collaboration of these applications in the smart city requires integration
    in 5G. The integration of M-IoT has not been studied significantly. L. 5G and
    Beyond 5G The future 5G of wireless cellular communication is expected to lay
    the basis of an intelligent network for multimedia communication in smart cities.
    Massive Mulitple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems for spectral efficiency
    [341], Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) for multimedia broadcast services
    [157], [342], micro and femtocells to increase cellular capacity, Ultra-Reliable
    Low-Latency Communication (URLLC) to achieve low latency for multimedia applications
    [343], [344], and NB-IoT for machine type communication are few solutions to achieve
    objectives of 5G [345]. However, a fully intelligent on-demand self-reconfigurable
    network to enhance many folds in the services and performance will be released
    in Beyond 5G (B5G). ML, DL, Quantum Computing (QC), and Quantum ML (QML) are considered
    as a core enabler of Sixth Generation (6G) or B5G [346]. Gigahertz (GHz) and Terahertz
    (THz) frequencies provide solutions to bandwidth scarcity and high date rates
    to deliver multimedia content [347]. All these areas are yet to investigate and
    explored for integrating M-IoT with 5G and 6G. M. Augmented and Virtual Reality
    in M-IoT Multimedia Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) in IoT will
    reveal many hidden and open the close doors for humanity [348]. 5G and B5G will
    enable user-friendly wireless AR and VR interfaces. AR and VR in M-IoT will revolutionize
    the health, industrial, and education sector [349]. It could be helpful for several
    patients suffering from immutable diseases, education and training, guidance and
    assistance, construction and architecture, and games. In brief, it could expedite
    the development of the smart city [350]. To achieve the development of a smart
    city, the requirements of end-user should be known, preferred, and satisfied by
    the interaction of end-user, telecommunication industry, content developers, and
    research scientists. N. Tactile Internet Certain real-time application areas of
    M-IoT such as robotic surgery, remote physical interaction, teleoperation, automation
    industry, and AR/VR require even minor tactile sensing information that occurs
    due to the interaction between the application and the environment [344]. IEEE
    recently launched activities to standardize tactile Internet (IEEE P1918.1) [351].
    The requirements of tactile information are ultra-low latency in milliseconds.
    URLLC seems to satisfy these requirements. There are a lot of research areas from
    the perspective of the tactile Internet that is yet to be studied in detail. Compression
    of tactile information, intelligent and scalable network traffic engineering for
    audio and video, and edge caching and computing for AR/VR has received very little
    attention [352]–[354]. Efficient routing and MAC protocols for tactile information
    are in need. O. Molecular Communication The ability to integrate all the five
    sensory features of humans that are olfactory (smell), gustatory (taste), tactile
    (touch), ocular (sight), and hearing (audio) in information and transmit is known
    as Human Bond Communication (HBC) [355]. In humans, the exchange of information
    is based on the synthesis, transformation, emission, propagation, and reception
    of molecules through biochemical and physical processes. In telecommunication
    engineering, this information exchange is classified as molecular communication
    [356]. With the emergence of NanoThings, molecular communication is the key research
    areas to revolutionize M-IoT [357]. SECTION IX. Conclusion The evolving Multimedia
    Internet-of-Things (M-IoT) has promoted several innovative applications, aiming
    to improve the quality of life by connecting numerous smart devices through emerging
    enabling technologies. Multimedia communication in IoT can support countless applications.
    The objective of this survey is to highlight the overview of M-IoT and the importance
    of M-IoT applications. The main issues while designing M-IoT architectures, protocols,
    and computing approaches are explored to provide stable IoT architecture to support
    maximum QoE. However, it is challenging to achieve because of constraints imposed
    by multimedia content, which distinguish it from traditional IoT. Various application-use
    cases were presented to illustrate how M-IoT can revolutionize the world. Various
    requirements and proposed solutions on Quality-of-Experience (QoE) for M-IoT on
    their subjective and objective-based metrics have been presented. Moreover, the
    relation between multimedia content, cloud computing, big data analytics, event
    processing, fog/edge computing, multimedia data coding, feature extraction, and
    SDNs have been discussed. Also, this article provides a comprehensive survey of
    various routing and Medium Access Control protocols (MAC) used for M-IoT. Finally,
    this article points out the open and potential research areas that need to be
    solved in future M-IoT systems. This article should deliver a sound basis for
    researchers to understand issues and challenges in M-IoT. Authors Figures References

    Abstract

    The history of human development has proven that medical and healthcare applications
    for humanity always are the main

    driving force behind the development of science and technology. The advent of
    Cloud technology for the ﬁrst time allows

    providing systems infrastructure as a service, platform as a service and software
    as a service. Cloud technology has dominated

    healthcare information systems for decades now. However, one limitation of cloud-based
    applications is the high service

    response time. In some emergency scenarios, the control and monitoring of patient
    status, decision-making with related

    resources are limited such as hospital, ambulance, doctor, medical conditions
    in seconds and has a direct impact on the life

    of patients. To solve these challenges, optimal computing technologies have been
    proposed such as cloud computing, edge

    computing, and fog computing technologies. In this article, we make a comparison
    between computing technologies. Then,

    we present a common architectural framework based on fog computing for Internet
    of Health Things (Fog-IoHT) applications.

    Besides, we also indicate possible applications and challenges in integrating
    fog computing into IoT Healthcare applications.

    The analysis results indicated that there is huge potential for IoHT applications
    based on fog computing. We hope, this study

    will be an important guide for the future development of fog-based Healthcare
    IoT applications.

    Introduction

    History demonstrated that the evolution of humanity goes

    hand in hand with the development and application of sci-

    ence and technology in the ﬁeld of medicine and healthcare.

    Decades ago, information technology applications in the

    medical area were invented to collect, monitor and control

    the patient status remotely, decision-making treatment for

    patients [1–3]. With the development of science came the

    advent of cloud computing technology. Cloud technology

    enables to provide all things such as services, include Infras-

    tructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS),

    and Software as a Service (SaaS). Robustness, reliability, and

    powerful computing abilities have made cloud computing the

    dominant technology of the past decade [4, 5].

    In the early 2020s, the advent of 5th generation mobile

    networks, also known as 5G, brought a new revolution to

    all industries. 5G allows providing services with ultra-low

    latency and ultra-high bandwidth [6, 7]. The advent of 5G

    realizes the concept of the Internet of Things and forms a

    series of smart applications serving humanity such as smart

    healthcare [8], intelligent transportation systems [9], smart

    cities [10], smart retail [11], smart agriculture [12], and IoT

    ecosystems [13, 14] as presented in Fig. 1.

    In a typical electronic healthcare system (e-Health), sen-

    sors are mounted on the body of patients. These devices

    collect data such as blood pressure, heart rate, mobility, etc.

    and transmit the collected data to the centre based on network

    connections [15]. Speciﬁcally, in [16], the authors introduced

    a semantic sensor network to enhance the interoperability

    ability of sensors in e-health systems for the purpose of the

    collected different e-Health data formats. Due to the amount

    of data collected being huge, they will be stored in the cloud

    for analysis and decision-making [17]. However, one chal-

    lenge of cloud-based applications is high service response

    time [18]. In ambulance emergency scenarios, where related

    data collection such as hospital location, distance, ambulance

    vehicles, medical staff, etc. The decision-making will be cal-

    culated in seconds and directly affected the patient life, cloud

    computing is not feasible. A computational technology with

    truly real-time response times could save the life of patients.

    In recent times, fog computing has been proposed [19–21].

    Fog computing brings cloud capabilities into LAN to reduce

    service response time.

    In this study, we make a comparison between comput-

    ing technologies. Then, we present a common architec-

    tural framework for fog computing-based IoT applications.

    Besides, we also point out possible applications and chal-

    lenges in integrating edge computing into IoT Healthcare

    applications. Some of the main contributions in this study

    are described as follows:

    • Vision of fog computing and IoT in healthcare industry.

    • Compare of cloud, edge, and fog computing.

    • A short survey of fog computing-based healthcare IoT

    applications.

    • Applications, challenges and future research directions.

    The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in Sect. 2,

    we present a common fog computing architecture frame-

    work. In Sect. 3, we present a short survey of recent fog

    computing-based Internet of Health applications. Section 4

    presentschallengesandfutureresearchdirections,andSect.5

    is the conclusion.

    Computing architectures

    For decades now, cloud computing has dominated all

    domains [22, 23]. A typical Cloud-based architecture con-

    sists of two layers: the Cloud layer consists of cloud servers

    that have robust storage and high-performance computing

    ability. They communicate with each other base on the core

    optical network with extremely bandwidth and the end-user

    layer consist of end-user devices.

    These devices are connected with each other and com-

    municate with the Cloud layer based on wired or wireless

    connections. Due to the computing, analysis and storage

    are performed on the Cloud, these devices without need

    the storage and computing abilities. Cloud computing has

    the capability of providing all things as a service, including

    infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, and soft-

    ware as a service [24]. Robustness, reliability and massive

    computing power make cloud computing to continue the core

    computing technology of the future [25, 26].

    One of the signiﬁcant limitations of cloud computing is

    the high service response time. Consequently, it is infeasible

    for real-time IoT applications, especially for delay-sensitive

    applications in some areas such as augmented reality [27],

    trafﬁc [28, 29], and emergency [30]. In recent times, to

    address these challenges, edge computing [31] and fog com-

    puting [32] are proposed.

    We present an all-in-one computing architecture as in

    Fig. 2. These edge and fog technologies both tend the shorter

    distance between the database and the end-user.

    One of the key differences between the two computing

    technologies is performance.

    Edge computing sets up computing servers at the gateway

    of the network while fog computing brings compute servers

    into the LAN. On the other hand, fog is the way to bring

    cloud capabilities to the edge of the network [33, 34]. About

    nature, fog is the standard, and the edge is the concept. The

    difference between fog computing and edge computing is

    only implement performance. In some cases, these two con-

    cepts overlap. To explain the capabilities of the computing

    technologies, in [33] presents a performance comparison of

    computing technologies as in Table 1.

    In this comparison, we indicate some key criteria that

    directly affect system performance as follows:

    • Latency: it is the average time to transmit a packet between

    two network nodes. Latency criteria reﬂect the transmis-

    sion capacity and system performance.

    • Service Response Time: it is the average time from end-

    user request service to the data is responded. Service

    Response Time criteria reﬂect the accuracy, reliability, and

    real-time response ability of IoT services.

    • Bandwidth: this criterion reﬂects the average bandwidth

    consumption when processing one request of each solu-

    tion.

    • Storage: this criterion reﬂects the data storage capacity of

    each solution.

    • Server Overhead: this criterion reﬂects the average com-

    putational cost per request of each solution.

    • Network Congestion: this criterion reﬂects the probability

    of collision of the packets.

    • Energy Consumption: this criterion reﬂects the average

    energy consumption of each solution.

    Figure 3 presents an overview architecture of fog-based

    IoHT applications. This architecture consists of three lay-

    ers: Thing layer, Fog layer, and Cloud layer. Thing layer

    includes end-user devices such as sensors, wearable IoT

    devices, Arduino motherboards, actuators to collect body

    data, heart rate, etc. The Fog layer includes the Internet

    gateway, local router, and fog servers. This layer communi-

    cates and transfers data between the Thing and Cloud layers.

    It uses provided data from the underlayer, federated learn-

    ing, fog computing, and deep learning to making-decisions

    for emergency medical scenarios. The Cloud layer includes

    servers with extreme huge storage, processing and analysis

    capabilities that help medical staff make long-term treatment

    decisions for patients.

    Obviously, with very low service response time, fog com-

    puting will be one of the most feasible solutions for Internet

    of Healthcare Things applications in emergency rescue sce-

    narios and in some real-time patient monitoring applications

    such as patients with a history of heart disease, blood pres-

    sure and stroke. The common feature of these applications

    is that they require real-time decision-making and response

    times.

    Survey of recent IoT healthcare applications

    The history of human development has proven that medicine

    and healthcare are the main driving forces for the devel-

    opment of science and technology [35, 36]. Cloud-based

    medical applications have grown robustly in recent years [37,

    38]. The advent of 5G has realized the concept of the Inter-

    net of Things and forces the further development of IoHT

    applications. In recent times, for the purpose to reduce ser-

    vice response time, improve system performance, and energy

    efﬁciency, integrating fog computing into the IoHT applica-

    tions are proposed and achieved some positive results. In

    this section, we present the fog computing-based proposals

    in recent three year ranges [2019–2021]. Based on the survey

    results, we divide the proposals into three categories based

    ing. Moreover, we also show the method, the purpose and

    the achieved results with each proposal. The details of the

    survey results are presented in Table 2.

    Hypertension is a very dangerous disease, it often occurs

    in the elderly or people with a history of the disease. A

    hypertension attack can suddenly appear. Without the timely

    support of relatives and doctors, the patient’s life will be at

    risk. To solve this problem, in [39], Sood et al. proposed an

    IoT healthcare application based on fog computing to mon-

    itoring and diagnose a hypertension attack of the patient in

    real-time. The operating principle of the system is as fol-

    lows: they use sensors mounted on the patient to collect blood

    pressure data. Then, an artiﬁcial neural network will be used

    to predict blood pressure attacks based on fog computing.

    The system will continuously generate blood pressure alerts

    to pre-installed mobile devices. Experiment results demon-

    strated the proposed solution reduced service response time,

    bandwidth consumption, and enhance the accuracy of diag-

    nosis compared to existing solutions.

    In recent times, the explosion of healthcare IoT applica-

    tions based on fog computing presented the huge potential of

    fog computing. However, on the other hand, these applica-

    tions make a signiﬁcant challenge in protecting the privacy

    and security of patient health information. To solve these

    challenges, Saha et al. [40] proposed the privacy ensured

    e-healthcare framework for electronic medical records in

    healthcare IoT applications based on fog computing. Experi-

    mental results demonstrated the efﬁciency of the proposed

    solution in terms of the privacy and security of patient

    information, reduced response time compared to existing

    solutions.

    Realizing the limitations of healthcare IoT applications

    based on the Cloud, Awaisi et al. [41] proposed an efﬁ-

    cient healthcare IoT based on fog computing to enhance

    efﬁciency and security. Speciﬁcally, they proposed an efﬁ-

    cient healthcare IoT architecture based on fog computing.

    Then, to enhance security, they use the identity-based user

    authentication method. Experiment results indicated the efﬁ-

    ciency of the proposed solution in terms of performance and

    enhance security.

    One of the main challenges facing healthcare applications

    is the ability and speed of patient data retrieval. The limited

    capabilities and capacities of IoT nodes are not viable. To

    123

    3810

    Complex & Intelligent Systems (2022) 8:3805–3815

    address this challenge, Wang et al. [42] proposed a healthcare

    IoT system based on fog computing to reduce patient data

    retrieval time. Speciﬁcally, they exploit caching and request

    aggregation of the content centric networking. Experiment

    results indicated that the proposed solution improved up to

    28.5% in terms of the patient data retrieval time compared to

    existing solutions.

    The robust increase of Cloud-based healthcare IoT appli-

    cations leads to the consumption of amount huge energy.

    According to energy efﬁciency direction, Isa et al. [43] pro-

    posed a fog computing-based architecture for healthcare IoT

    applications to saving and optimise energy consumption.

    Speciﬁcally, they proposed an efﬁcient energy fog-based

    computing model, called EEFC to optimize the location and

    number of fog servers at the edge layer. Experiment results

    demonstrated the efﬁciency of the proposed solution com-

    pared to existing cloud-based solutions when it saving energy

    upto36%and52%,respectivelywithlowandhighdataspeed

    scenarios.

    Cloud-based IoT applications have been successfully

    deployed in the last decade, however, Shreshth Tuli et al.

    [44] demonstrated that existing IoHT applications based on

    the cloud have limited scalability and high service response

    time. To solve these challenges, the authors proposed a novel

    IoHT architecture based on fog computing and deep learn-

    ing to real-time analysis and diagnostic for heart patients.

    Simulation results indicated that the proposed framework

    improved in terms of energy consumption, bandwidth, accu-

    racy, delay, and execution time in different fog-based IoHT

    scenarios.

    The integration of fog computing into healthcare IoT

    applications aim to make these real-time eHealth applica-

    tions is the inevitable trend. However, the breakout of IoT

    devices will lead to overload. To solve this problem, Zhang

    et al. [45] proposed an efﬁcient ofﬂoading schema for fog

    servers in real-time eHealth systems.

    Speciﬁcally, they consider the ofﬂoading problem as

    multi-stage stochastic programming that aims to minimize

    the total delay to determine the optimal ofﬂoad plan based

    on system resources. Experiment results indicated that the

    proposed solution can rapid be led to the approximate opti-

    mal results.

    For the purpose design a privacy and security health-

    care IoT system to diagnostic accuracy diabetic and cardio

    disease, Shynu et al. [46] proposed an integrated solution

    between healthcare IoT application, blockchain and fog com-

    puting technologies. Speciﬁcally, sensors will collect patient

    data and storage on the blockchain. Then the patient health

    records will be grouped, and ﬁnally, an adaptive neuro fuzzy

    inference system is used for making-decision diagnostic

    based on fog computing. Experiment results indicated that

    the efﬁciency of the proposed solution when it improved

    accurate diagnosis rate up to 81% compared to existing solu-

    tions.

    In the context of the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic,

    the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) plays an important

    role in supporting the diagnosis and treatment of patients

    infected with the coronavirus. To enhance performance and

    reduced service response time of these applications. In

    [47], Qiu et al. proposed an IoMT based on fog comput-

    ing. Speciﬁcally, they use an efﬁcient ofﬂoading schema to

    resource allocation between fog servers aims to limited over-

    load. Experiment results indicated that the proposed solution

    improved computing cost and reduce response time com-

    pared to existing solutions.

    According to the development trend of society, more cit-

    izens go to gyms to exercise. The monitoring activities,

    exercises, and body compositions of athletes to give warn-

    ings timely or provide analyses of the change of body signals

    to doctors, coaches, and athletes are urgent requirements. To

    solve this problem, Hussain et al. (2021) [48] proposed a

    fog-based healthcare IoT framework. Speciﬁcally, they use

    wearable IoT devices to collect body data, exercise inten-

    sity, heart rate. Then, athlete information records are stored,

    analyzed at fog servers to make optimize exercise, duration,

    and intensity for each athlete. Through experiment, they con-

    structed three modules, include Health zone to classify the

    health of athletes, Hzone to provide timely warnings about

    the health status of athletes, and a gym activity recognition

    module. Experiment results demonstrated the efﬁciency of

    the proposed solution compared to existing solutions.

    High service response delay is one of the limitations of

    Cloud-based healthcare IoT applications. To solve this prob-

    lem, Asghar et al. [49] proposed a fog-based healthcare

    IoT architecture framework. Moreover, to adaptive for large-

    scale healthcare applications, they also introduce an efﬁcient

    ofﬂoading schema to load balancing between fog servers.

    Experiment results based on iFogSim simulation software

    indicated that the proposed solution reduced response time

    compared to the Cloud-based approach.

    In the COVID-19 pandemic, fog-based healthcare IoT

    applications showed their important position and inevitable

    development trend in the future. However, the analysis of

    patient information records at the fog servers faces privacy

    and security challenges. To address these challenges, Guo

    et al. [50] proposed an improved symmetric homomorphic

    cryptosystem for monitoring delay-sensitive applications.

    Finally, they experimented with their solution with two attack

    games to indicate the improved privacy and security. Exper-

    iment results demonstrated the efﬁciency of the proposed

    solution compared to existing related approaches.

    Although fog computing has great potential to provide

    network resources and requested services for applications at

    the edge network. However, inefﬁcient deployment of com-

    ponents on fog infrastructure results bandwidth, resource

    123

    Complex & Intelligent Systems (2022) 8:3805–3815

    3811

    and energy wastage, reduce system performance. To solve

    this problem, Yaser Ramzanpoor et al. [51] proposed a

    multi-objective optimization algorithm for fog-IoHT appli-

    cations. Authors used a multi-objective cuckoo search algo-

    rithm (MOCSA) to solve the multi-objective optimization

    problem of both energy and latency. The simulation results

    show that the proposed solution improved average latency

    the amount [5–42]% and reduce energy consumption about

    [28–43]% compared to several existing solutions.

    Discussion and applications

    Analysis of the surveyed results in Table 2 presented

    some interesting results. The proposals focus on three main

    approaches, including performance improvement, privacy

    and security, and ofﬂoading.

    According to the performance improvement approach,

    fog-IoHT applications focus on reducing service response

    time, energy efﬁciency, and improving the accuracy of

    decision-making. Some typical results are as follows: in

    [42], authors reduced the patient data retrieval time by

    28.5% compared to existing solutions. Moreover, in [43],

    authors improved energy consumption up to 52% compared

    to Cloud-based systems in high data speed scenarios.

    According to the privacy and security approach, fog-IoHT

    applications focus on ensuring privacy and data security at

    fog servers. Information related to the health condition of

    patients is particularly sensitive and needs to be private.

    Ensuring information security for healthcare-related appli-

    cations is an important task. Obviously, data storage and

    processing at fog servers brings unprecedented abilities and

    capabilities to IoHT applications. On the other hand, it also

    brings the attacked potential risks on fog servers. Therefore, a

    series of proposals to improve privacy and security for IoHT

    have been proposed over the years in [2, 3, 7, 11].

    In [52], authors proposed a secure edge computing solu-

    tion for IoT applications based on the security gateway that

    is deployed on edge to manage IoT devices, data, IoT clients,

    and services aim to provide secure edge services of access

    and visualization to users.

    According to ofﬂoading approach, fog-IoHT applications

    focus on ofﬂoading for fog servers. The explosive growth of

    sensors, IoT devices and smart healthcare applications gener-

    ates a huge amount of data. Consequently, it will put pressure

    and overload on fog computing servers. An effective ofﬂoad-

    ing strategy is an inevitable requirement and one of the most

    signiﬁcant challenges for real-time fog-IoHT applications.

    It should be recalled that, although performance improve-

    ment and efﬁcient ofﬂoading all have the same goals to reduce

    service response time, energy, and enhance the accuracy of

    decision-making, they have two different approaches. While

    performance improvement uses different solutions and meth-

    Fig. 4 Several typical applications of fog-IoHT

    ods to optimize performance criteria on a fog server, efﬁcient

    ofﬂoading focuses on establishing an optimal assignment of

    tasks schema for fog servers. In [6], the authors achieved an

    approximate optimal ofﬂoading schema. Some other studies

    in [8, 10] improved computing costs and reduced response

    times.

    Surveyed results indicated a series of the typical fog-

    IoHT applications as presented in Fig. 4, include monitoring

    hypertension attacks, diagnostic accuracy diabetic and cardio

    disease, diagnosis and treatment of infected patients coro-

    navirus, etc. The survey results also indicated that many

    studies have been proposed for healthcare area within the past

    3years.Oneofthemainpurposesoffogcomputingistomove

    the abilities of the cloud closer to end-users for the purpose

    of the reduced service response times, enhance reliability,

    efﬁciency energy consumption, bandwidth, computing costs.

    The surveyed studies have achieved some positive results,

    however, there are still many challenges in taking fog com-

    puting into IoT applications [53, 54].

    Challenges and future research directions

    Nowadays, IoT is applied in almost all domains of humanity

    and it will play an extremely vital role as well as the key driv-

    ing force for the development of the future Internet. In the

    next decade, billions of IoT devices and smart applications

    will emerge in a series of areas such as smart manufactur-

    ing, smart agriculture, augmented reality, healthcare, etc. and

    123

    3812

    Complex & Intelligent Systems (2022) 8:3805–3815

    Fig. 5 Some key challenges of IoHT applications

    make basic changes for our world. To respond to these huge

    requirements, a robust, reliable, and ﬂexible FC architecture

    to optimize network systems is topical and urgent. We dis-

    cussed some challenges and possible research directions as

    presented in Fig. 5 for future edge computing as follows:

    (1) An efﬁcient computing ofﬂoading scheme to achieve

    optimized performance needs to be considered. This

    scheme must be able to allocate appropriate tasks to

    both fog computing and cloud computing systems. In

    [55], the authors introduced a hybrid ofﬂoading schema

    between cloud and fog to tasks associated with complex

    applications. In this study, based on the task require-

    ments, the IoT node based on the Q-learning algorithm

    will choose to ofﬂoad tasks to the fog servers or to the

    cloud to load balancing and executed more efﬁciently.

    (2) An efﬁcient scheduling algorithm to achieve energy

    efﬁciency, reliably manage and control fog servers in

    heterogeneous network environments needs to be con-

    sidered. In [56], the authors introduced an efﬁcient

    scheduling algorithm to saving energy for fog-based

    IoT systems. This algorithm aims to derive the optimal

    scheduling decision based on multiple neighbor helper

    nodes sharing their computation resources. Beside, in

    [57], the authors also introduced an efﬁcient schedul-

    ing algorithm for efﬁcient resource utilization on fog

    servers. Speciﬁcally, they rank fog nodes based on

    latency and resource utilization criteria. Then, intelli-

    gent scheduling algorithms based on the game theory

    approach are used to optimise the allocation of tasks.

    (3) In healthcare, the need for security on fog servers

    have been highlighted in recent studies due to poten-

    tial unsafe issues from public network environments as

    well as resource sharing of servers [58, 59]. Accordingly

    to Turgut et al. [60] demonstrated that the successful

    deployment of the IoT applications will only happen if

    the customer beneﬁts (the potential beneﬁts that IoT sys-

    tems provide to exceed their physical value and security

    and privacy costs). In our opinion, if privacy and secu-

    rity is not guaranteed, these potential risks can obscure

    the beneﬁts of Internet of health Things applications

    [60]. Therefore, the privacy and security problem for

    fog-IoHT applications will continue to be the subject of

    attention.

    The survey results have also indicated that integration

    between fog computing and IoHT applications is still in

    infancy stage; so a series of challenging problems need to

    be addressed in the future.

    Conclusions

    The Internet of Things will be a comprehensive revolution

    of the future Internet. Based on IoT, the concepts of smart

    healthcare, smart cities, smart retail, smart agriculture and

    IoT systems are advent. To provide computing methods for

    these applications, several computational technologies have

    been proposed including cloud computing, edge computing,

    and fog computing. One of the most important applications

    of the IoT era is smart healthcare. A traditional health-

    care application based on the cloud has some limitations

    such as high service response time and computing costs,

    more energy consumption and bandwidth. For the purpose

    of real-time ambulance emergency or rescue, rescue appli-

    cations, these applications need real-time service response.

    Therefore, fog computing-based IoHT applications are pro-

    posed. The survey and analysis results have proven that

    fog computing-based IoHT applications reduce latency, save

    energy, improve performance, reliability compared to cloud

    computing. In reality, cloud computing is still a core com-

    puting technology. Fog computing was born to bring the

    capabilities of the cloud closer to end-users. Because the

    distance between the end-users and the database is short-

    ened, fog computing has outstanding advantages over cloud

    computing and especially suitable for real-time IoHT appli-

    cations. In this study, we propose an all-in-one computing

    architecture framework. Besides, we surveyed recently the

    IoT applications based on fog computing in the healthcare

    industry. Based on the survey results, we analyzed the appli-

    cationpossibilities,challengesandfutureresearchdirections.

    We hope the results of this study will be an important guide

    for future research in the ﬁeld of fog computing and the

    healthcare industry.

- analysis: This study assessed the characteristics and frequency of lightning-caused
    wildfires that could have led to sociopolitical controversy. Using US Forest Service
    (USFS) data, they identified 32 fires from 2009 to 2020 that shared key features
    with the highly publicized 'Tamarack Fire' of 2021. The analysis revealed that
    fires where initial suppression strategies were driven by resource objectives,
    rather than firefighter hazard mitigation, were rare. Resource objectives guided
    the initial response of only six out of the 32 fires identified, with the remaining
    26 primarily focused on minimizing risk to firefighters. The study highlights
    the need for clearer definitions of fire management strategies and emphasizes
    that simple categorization, as reported in the Incident Command System 209 (ICS-209),
    may not fully capture the complexities of incident decision-making. The findings
    suggest that sociopolitically contentious lightning-ignited fires are uncommon,
    and that aggressive fire exclusion strategies may be driven more by firefighter
    safety concerns than resource objectives.

    actuales para la implementación de políticas federales de manejo del fuego en
    los EEUU, responsabilizan a las agencias por las tareas de restauración y el mantenimiento
    de ecosistemas adaptados al fuego, mientras que limitan la extensión de los incendios
    que afectan la vida y la propiedad, sopesando esto con el riesgo al que exponen
    a los combatientes de incendios. Estas metas ostensiblemente conflictivas pueden
    hacer dificultoso el comunicar claramente respuestas objetivas en un incidente
    dado. Esta inherente ambigüedad puede exponer a las agencias de manejo de tierras,
    como el Servicio Forestal dependiente del Departamento de Agricultura (USFS),
    a un examen profundo, cuando incendios iniciados por rayos en áreas remotas sobrepasan
    los límites y resultan en daños. Uno de estos incidentes fue el incendio de Tamarak,
    que se inició por rayos en un área silvestre remota perteneciente al USFS, quemando
    27.776 ha a través diferentes jurisdicciones y destruyendo 25 estructuras. Un
    interés sociopolítico muy intenso se desarrolló alrededor de este incidente, reavivando
    el debate sobre la política de “dejar quemar” del USFS, aunque esta política no
    exista formalmente. Proveemos acá una primera aproximación para cuantificar la
    línea de base sobre las consecuencias potenciales de incendios iniciados por rayos
    como el incendio de Tamarak. Usamos múltiples fuentes de reportes de incendios
    causados por rayos para caracterizar incendios del USFS desde 2009 al 2020 mediante
    estrategias para identificar análogos al incendio de Tamarak. Dentro del esquema
    de reportes del Comando de Incidentes 209 (ICS-209) sobre los incendios originados
    en tierras manejadas por el USFS, identificamos 32 incendios con características
    clave similares al incendio de Tamarak; casi la mitad se iniciaron dentro de áreas
    silvestres. Resultados Las estrategias iniciales fueron conducidas hacia objetivos
    basados en los recursos para solo seis de los 32 incendios; la mitigación del
    riesgo de los combatientes fue el conductor primario en todos los otros. Ningún
    incendio exhibió cada una de las características del incendio de Tamarak. Los
    incendios caracterizados como análogos representaron solo un pequeño porcentaje
    (3,4%) de los grandes incendios (> 121 ha) del USFS causados por rayos. Estos
    incendios fueron responsables del 61% de las estructuras destruidas y comprometieron
    el 25,8% del personal responsable en los grandes incendios causados por rayos
    en tierras del USFS. Conclusiones Los incendios por rayos, que podrían haber resultado
    en alguna controversia sociopolítica, son raros, y aquellos con estrategias orientadas
    hacia los recursos son aún más raras. Más comúnmente, el riesgo al que son expuestos
    los combatientes de incendios en el terreno, como árboles muertos en pie, o accesibilidad,
    son factores que conducen esa estrategia, aún cuando los incendios se inicien
    en áreas silvestres. Estos resultados sugieren que la simple definición de las
    estrategias tales como las reportadas dentro de la CS-209, le faltan claridad
    y pueden incrementar la presión sociopolítica sobre en la agencia (USFS) para
    continuar con una política agresiva de estrategia de exclusión del fuego. Background
    Set against a backdrop of climate change, increasing area burned, rising suppression
    costs, and an ever-expanding set of values at risk, the United States Department
    of Agriculture Forest Service (USFS) is charged with balancing the protection
    needs of these values against the inevitability and necessity of wildland fire
    in the western United States (Calkin et al. 2015, Abatzoglou et al. 2016, Schoennagel
    et al. 2017). Since its adoption in 2009, the Guidance for Implementation of Federal
    Wildland Fire Management Policy has allowed for naturally ignited, unplanned wildfires
    to be concurrently managed for objectives including protection of values at risk
    while also allowing fire to fulfill its natural role on the landscape (IFWFPR
    2009). In this implementation guidance, there are no clearly defined terms to
    describe the collective suite of strategies and tactics that may be applied to
    any individual incident, potentially resulting in miscommunication and in some
    cases decreasing trust between federal agencies, cooperators, and the public (Fillmore
    et al. 2021). In some circumstances, this ambiguity has led to scrutiny of federal
    agencies like the USFS by some in the media and political arenas. This scrutiny
    asserts that the USFS has a de facto “let burn” policy that fails to rapidly suppress
    new lightning-caused ignitions before they can cause damage, particularly following
    high-profile fires that spread across jurisdictional boundaries and threatened
    life and property (Dood 2013, Chabria 2021, McClintock 2021). High-profile events
    such as the 2018 Pole Creek and Bald Mountain fires in Utah have reinforced this
    narrative. Initially assessed to be remote and unlikely to threaten communities
    or infrastructure (USFS 2019) these fires did the opposite, resulting in peak
    evacuations of over 4000 people along the densely populated Wasatch Front Range
    (St. Denis et al. 2023, USDA 2019). Counternarratives to this “let burn” scrutiny
    can point to comprehensive analyses suggesting the greatest wildfire risk often
    emanates from human-caused ignitions on private lands (Mietkiewicz et al. 2020;
    Downing et al. 2022; Hantson et al. 2022), as well as a host of pragmatic factors
    that justify alternate approaches to minimizing area burned as quickly as possible.
    In some cases, scarcity of fire personnel and equipment due to ongoing fire activity
    elsewhere may limit options (Belval et al. 2020, 2022), and in others, local management
    objectives may call for restoring rather than excluding fire (Young et al. 2019,
    Davis et al. 2022, Iniguez et al. 2022). Importantly, firefighter safety hazards
    often preclude aggressive suppression tactics, especially when weighed against
    threats posed to values at risk. Implementation guidance for wildland fire explicitly
    states, “Firefighter and public safety is the first priority in every fire management
    activity.” (IFWFPR 2009, pg. 8). Firefighter safety hazards can include remote
    terrain with limited accessibility or egress (Campbell et al. 2019) and environmental
    hazards such as steep slopes or standing dead trees (North et al. 2015, 2021,
    Dunn et al. 2019). Irrespective of the comparative validity of these narratives,
    high-profile lightning-caused fires often result in renewed political and societal
    pressure for federal agencies to double down on reactive and regressive policies
    focused largely on aggressive fire exclusion. This feedback loop reinforces itself,
    perpetuating the wildfire paradox in which aggressive fire exclusion exacerbates
    responder hazards and increases future fire risk (Calkin et al. 2015; Finney 2021).
    The 2021 Tamarack Fire represents a microcosm of the operational, ecological,
    social, and political complexities of managing wildfire events. On 4 July 2021,
    the Tamarack Fire was ignited by lightning on a ridgeline within the Mokelumne
    Wilderness on the Bridgeport Ranger District of the Humboldt-Toiyabe National
    Forest in California, USA. The preceding weeks had seen locally heavy initial
    attack, with 40 new fires burning 549 ha within 50 km of the Tamarack with many
    still requiring extended resource commitments (WFDSS 2022). Seven other fires
    were ignited in the area on 4 July, and due to limited resource availability,
    were triaged and responded to in the order of the most immediate threats posed
    to values. The Tamarack Fire remained relatively small (< 1 ha) until the morning
    of 16 July. Due to forecasted high winds, low humidity, and high temperatures,
    an interagency hotshot crew was assigned to the incident the morning of 16 July,
    along with an air attack platform and a type one helicopter. By mid-morning, fire
    behavior had increased dramatically, and by the end of the day over 4452 ha had
    burned, and the fire was outside of the wilderness, threatening structures in
    the community of Markleeville, CA. By 22 August, the Tamarack Fire had burned
    27,776 ha across multiple jurisdictions, destroyed 25 structures, and damaged
    seven. At its peak, over 1600 firefighters were assigned and managed by a type
    one incident management team. The Tamarack Fire does not stand out in terms of
    area burned or structures destroyed compared to fire outcomes in California from
    2021, but it is unique for the intense media and political interest it garnered
    and the criticism of the initial decision to not aggressively suppress as a “let
    burn” approach (McClintock and LaMalfa 2022, Pimlott 2021). The initial management
    decision to monitor the Tamarack Fire, filed in the Wildland Fire Decision Support
    System (WFDSS 2021), was driven primarily by a high level of firefighter hazards
    and the apparent lack of values at risk. However, the potential for the fire to
    result in benefits to natural resources was documented as part of the decision
    rationale as a by-product of the selected course of action. This was in response
    to USFS risk management direction, part of which asks, “What are the opportunities
    to manage fire to meet land management objectives?” as part of the risk assessment
    protocols (NWCG 2021, page 116). While only one of several other considerations
    in the decision, the answer to this question could lend credence to the emerging
    narrative that the agency’s “let burn” policy was primarily responsible (Moon
    and Chan 2021; Graff 2021). While the Tamarack Fire was still burning, on 2 August
    2021, the USFS issued guidance for the remainder of the 2021 fire season stating
    that “managing fires for resource benefit is a strategy we will not use,” while
    also placing additional restrictions on prescribed fire implementation (USDA Forest
    Service 2021). Perhaps partially catalyzed by the Tamarack Fire, a renewed public
    and political interest in wildland fire management emerged. In January 2022, the
    Bipartisan Wildfire Caucus sent a letter to the President of the US requesting
    a review of the 2000 National Fire Plan, additional wildfire response resources,
    and a limit on firing tactics (e.g., backfiring) without additional approval (Neguse
    et al. 2022). Concurrently, the U.S. National Association of Counties considered
    a proposed resolution that would have urged the USFS to initiate a nationwide
    analysis of wildland fire management under the National Environmental Policy Act,
    and to suppress all fires in the interim (Kirk 2021). By March 2022, congressional
    legislation was introduced with the purpose of “extinguishing wildfires detected
    on National Forest System lands not later than 24 h after such a wildfire is detected”
    (McClintock and LaMalfa 2022: 2). This proposed legislation failed to become law.
    Here we attempt a first approximation at quantifying the base rates of potentially
    consequently lightning-caused fires, with aims to resolve some of the ambiguity
    and confusion regarding the drivers of incident strategies and the “let burn”
    characterization of USFS fire policy, and to inform social and political dialog
    that may influence fire management decision-making and agency direction moving
    forward. To do this, we review and interpret agency fire reporting data to understand
    the frequency of lightning-ignited wildfires that could have informed “let burn”
    narratives. Specifically, we use key characteristics of the 2021 Tamarack Fire
    to identify and classify fires originating between 2009 and 2020. Our study expands
    upon recent research exploring aspects of cross-boundary (CB) wildfires (e.g.,
    Barros et al. 2021, Downing et al. 2022), with our focus on the extent to which
    lightning-caused fires have exhibited characteristics which could have similarly
    created scrutiny of USFS incident strategies. We compare these analog fires in
    terms of factors including origin in wilderness, structures threatened and destroyed,
    personnel used, reported strategies, and reported strategy drivers (i.e., resource
    objectives versus firefighter safety). We aim to determine whether events like
    the Tamarack Fire are truly emblematic of a broader “let burn” approach that can
    result in critique and sociopolitical pressure, or if they are perhaps better
    characterized as rare but salient events. Methods We leveraged multiple tabular
    and spatial data sources (Table 1) to identify lightning-caused fires resulting
    in CB transmission originating from USFS lands, and which also shared other key
    attributes of the 2021 Tamarack Fire (referred to hereafter as analog fires).
    The core data for this study were derived from the ICS-209-PLUS dataset, which
    is a science-grade compilation of ICS-209 reports (St. Denis et al. 2023) spanning
    from 1999 to 2020. To obtain official agency reports of fire cause, initial suppression
    strategy, and ownership at the point of origin (POO), we connected the ICS-209-PLUS
    dataset to records from the USFS final fire reporting system (FIRESTAT) for 1999
    through 2019, and from the Interagency Fire Occurrence Reporting Modules (InFORM;
    NIFC 2020) for 2020. Reported POOs were further classified by jurisdiction by
    intersecting them with the WFDSS Surface Management Agency (SMA; WFDSS 2022) and
    Aggregated Wilderness System (UM 2022) datasets. We focused on POOs that ignited
    naturally on USFS-managed lands from 2009 to 2020, which occurred after the adoption
    of the 2009 Guidance for Implementation of Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy
    (IFWFPR 2009). Table 1 Key reported characteristics of the 2021 Tamarack Fire,
    condition sets and datasets used to identify similar incidents, and counts of
    these similar incidents by query level Full size table We identified analog fires
    by querying this compiled dataset for the characteristics of the 2021 Tamarack
    Fire seen in Table 1; Fig. 1. Although the Tamarack fire was ignited within wilderness,
    we did not limit our selection of fires to only those that ignited in wilderness.
    Rather, we attributed each wildfire POO as being within wilderness or not. This
    allowed us to explore potential differences between the two populations. Other
    querying criteria stemming from the Tamarack fire characteristics were either
    treated as rigid filters (i.e., cause, complex association, and CB transmission)
    or as minimum acceptable values (i.e., maximum daily growth and growth duration).
    Rather than focusing on fires with a minimum fire size equal to the Tamarack,
    we chose to focus on fires greater than or equal to 121 hectares, a common threshold
    of US Fire Reporting metrics defined as a large fire in reporting systems. The
    largest fire size class in the US reporting system are those greater than or equal
    to 2023 hectares (NIFC 2020), which we used to inform our maximum daily growth.
    It is not uncommon for wildfires larger than 2023 ha to experience a single day
    growth of 2023 ha. Fig. 1 Sankey diagram of USFS POO fires with an ICS-209 submission
    and our initial filters applied. Cross-boundary transmission was only determined
    for the 40 fires that met all preceding criteria. While wilderness characteristics
    were attributed to incident POOs, they were not excluded from further analysis
    on this basis and as such are not represented in this figure. Percentages displayed
    from ”Final Size” moving to the right are based on a denominator of the total
    number of lightning-caused ignitions, 2322 Full size image There were 940 large,
    lightning-caused USFS POO incidents with at least one ICS-209 report between 2009
    and 2020. We applied further classification to this subset, which we call our
    denominator of interest, because they were potential candidates for alternative
    fire management strategies. We classified fires by growth duration and maximum
    fire spread rate (ha) to determine frequency of fires by threshold (Table 2).
    In total there were 66 fires with a maximum fire spread rate of at least 2023
    ha. Of these we identified 41 fires with a growth duration greater than 14 days
    (Table 2, > 2 weeks). We then reviewed each of the individual ICS-209 reports
    for the 41 fires of interest by day and found that the maximum daily growth of
    one incident (2020 WY-MRF Middle Fork) was a reporting artifact and did not meet
    our fire-growth threshold. It was therefore excluded from further analysis leaving
    40 incidents of interest (Fig. 1 and 40 wildfires with a growth duration > 14
    days). Of these 40 fires, 32 were CB and therefore satisfied all of the requirements
    of ”analog fires”. Table 2 Count of large (> 121 ha) lightning-caused USFS POO
    wildfires (excluding complexes) by maximum single-day fire spread rate (ha) and
    overall growth duration (weeks) from 2009 to 2020. The subset adopted for further
    analysis (i.e., fires with single-day growth > 2023 ha and > 14-day duration)
    is shaded in gray (fires n = 40, after excluding 2020-WYMRF-Middle Fork)). These
    40 fires CB characteristics were determined, resulting in 8 fires that did not
    exit USFS lands, leaving 32 analog fires Full size table To classify the 32 fires
    into subtypes, we sequenced daily ICS-209 suppression strategies over the duration
    of each incident (Table 3). Daily suppression strategy reporting is uniquely dependent
    on incident conditions, resource availability, and other relevant factors that
    affect the desire and ability to suppress a fire. We leveraged this information
    to classify fires into four subtypes that characterize the use of “full suppression”
    methods over the duration of an incident. While the Tamarack Fire initially reported
    “monitor”, it later changed entirely to “full suppression” coincident with its
    first major growth event. Later in the incident, suppression methods were reported
    as 82% “full suppression”, and 18% “confine” in recognition of areas in which
    fire progression was halted by natural features. Within our fire subtype definition
    set, the Tamarack Fire would be classified as “mixed suppression methods.” Table
    3 Descriptions and short names of fire subtypes according to the series of reported
    suppression methods for each fire Full size table Finally, we reviewed the first
    published WFDSS decision document for each of the analog fires to determine whether
    resource management objectives or firefighter safety concerns were driving factors
    in initial strategies. By reviewing the objectives and rationale contents of the
    first published decisions we were able to document manager reported strategic
    drivers into two categories: resource objective driven, or firefighter hazard
    driven. As an example, the 2017 Chetco Bar fire’s first WFDSS decision rationale
    (a free-text block in which managers summarize their decision-making process)
    stated, “Initial attack efforts on 7/12 and 7/13 by Siskiyou rappelers (sic.)
    were unsuccessful. Conditions were not safe to engage the fire due to air access
    only, with no escape routes or safety zones. The decision was made by the IC (Incident
    Commander) to disengage due to concerns of firefighter safety and low probability
    of success…Anticipated weather changes may add to potential fire spread with uphill
    runs making access difficult for resources to engage in fire suppression safely.”
    In the case of the 2018 Bald Mountain Fire, the initial WFDSS decision rationale
    stated, “Risk Decision: 1. What alternatives (objectives, strategies, and tactics)
    are being considered? Alternative 1 - Suppress Fire (Not Selected); Alternative
    2 - Manage Fire for Resource Benefits (Selected).” In our analysis the Chetco
    Bar fire was documented as a firefighter hazard strategy driver while the Bald
    Mountain was documented as resource objective strategy driver. Finally, we used
    fields within the ICS-209 PLUS system to analyze analog fires in terms of total
    personnel commitment, total structures threatened, total structures destroyed,
    peak evacuations, and total estimated costs. Results Out of 3484 USFS POO fires
    with at least one ICS-209 submission between 2009 and 2020, we identified 940
    large, lightning-caused USFS POO single fires that form our denominator of interest.
    Within these, 32 fires (0.9%, Table 2) that had similar reported characteristics
    of the 2021 Tamarack Fire. Compared to the total set of all lightning-caused USFS
    fires (2322), these 32 fires represent just 1.3%. Of large, lightning-caused USFS
    POO single fires with at least one ICS-209 report (n = 940), hereafter referred
    to as the denominator of interest, our analog fires represent 3.4% (Table 2).
    For clarity, the remainder of these results compare the 32 analog fires only to
    the denominator of interest. Of these 32 analog wildfires, nine were never full
    suppression, seven were limited initial suppression, eight were mixed suppression
    methods, and eight were always full suppression (Fig. 2; Table 4). The initial
    strategy driver was resource objectives for six fires, four of which were never
    full suppression, while two were limited initial suppression. The remaining 26
    analog fires had an initial strategy driver of firefighter safety considerations.
    This includes most of the never full suppression and limited initial suppression
    with five fires in each management type, and all fires managed with mixed suppression
    methods and always full suppression. For reference, the suppression series for
    the Tamarack Fire was categorized as the mixed suppression methods subtype and
    its initial strategy was driven by firefighter hazards as documented in WFDSS.

    points of origin. See list of abbreviations for full unit identifications (e.g.,
    UT-MLF) Full size image Fourteen of the 32 analog fires originated within wilderness
    areas (Table 4). These included three ignitions in always full suppression, mixed
    suppression methods, and never full suppression subtypes. In the limited initial
    suppression subtype, five of seven incidents ignited within wilderness. Of the
    26 fires where Firefighter Safety drove initial strategies, ten ignited within
    wilderness. For wildfires with initial strategies driven by resource objectives,
    four of six ignited within wilderness. In terms of structures destroyed, the 32
    analog fires accounted for 61.6% of all structure loss from the 940 denominator
    fires of interest (386 of 626 structures; Table 5). Twenty-five of the 32 analog
    wildfires resulted in structure loss, spanning all combinations of fire subtype
    and initial strategy drivers (Fig. 2; Table 4), with these 25 fires representing
    only 2.7% of the denominator of interest fires (25 of 940 fires). Of these 25
    fires that destroyed structures, ten ignited within a wilderness area, representing
    an occurrence rate of 1.1% (10 of 940 fires). Table 5 Count of structures destroyed
    by the 940 denominator fires of interest (excluding fire complexes) by maximum
    single-day fire spread rate (ha) and overall growth duration (weeks) from 2009
    to 2020, with gray shading indicating the 32 analog fires. While structures destroyed
    by analog fires are identified by gray shading (n = 386), two fires within the
    gray shading were not CB yet destroyed two structures each, accounting for the
    discrepancy between the 390 structures destroyed within this table and the 386
    destroyed by analog fires Full size table Most of the structure loss on 32 analog
    fires was driven by the Little Bear Fire (254 of 386 structures; Tables 4 and
    5), which originated in a wilderness, was always full suppression, and whose initial
    strategy driver was firefighter hazard. Exclusive of this fire, analog fires accounted
    for 21.7% of structure loss from the set of 940 denominator fires of interest
    (136 of 626 structures). Fires whose strategy subtype was anything other than
    always full suppression accounted for 20.2% of structure loss from the denominator
    of interest fires (127 of 626 structures). Of the six analog fires with an initial
    strategy driven by resource objectives, three destroyed structures, and collectively
    amounted to only four of the 386 structures destroyed by analog fires (1.03%)
    and only 0.6% of structures destroyed by the 940 denominator fires of interest
    (4 of 626 structures, Tables 4 and 5). Two of these fires were limited initial
    suppression (Pole Creek and Bald Mountain), and the third was never full suppression
    (Twitchell Canyon). Of these, only Bald Mountain ignited within wilderness. Of
    the three fires driven by resource objectives that did not destroy structures
    (Corral, Highline, and Strawberry), all were never full suppression, and all ignited
    within wilderness (Table 4). The 32 analog fires reported an outsized share of
    resource use when compared to the 940 denominator fires of interest (Fig. 2; Table
    2). Despite the analog fires representing a small percent (3.4%, 32 of 940 fires)
    of these incidents, they reported 25.8% of total personnel commitments (388,648
    of 1,500,754 structures, Tables 6 and 7). Table 6 Count of total personnel assigned
    to the 940 denominator fires of interest (excluding fire complexes) by maximum
    single-day fire spread rate (ha) and overall growth duration (weeks) from 2009
    to 2020, with gray shading indicating the 32 analog fires. Total personnel assignments
    by analog fires are within gray shading (n = 388,648) — the additional 13,147
    identified below are from non-CB fires eliminated from the analog set Full size
    table Table 7 Summary reported values (total or average as noted) from ICS-209
    PLUS by fire subtype Full size table Examining individual characteristics of the
    32 analog wildfires among fire subtypes identified some temporal trends. Limited
    Initial Suppression showed a slower start in terms of fire growth, but final fire
    size was generally larger than other subtypes and had the greatest average number
    of fire growth days (49, Table 7). Limited Initial Suppression also had the highest
    projected final cost (Fig. 3; Table 7). Corresponding peaks in personnel assigned
    were also higher for Limited Initial Suppression when compared to other subtypes
    (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the large spikes in structures threatened by Limited
    Initial Suppression fires did not appear to be indicative of total structures
    destroyed. Compared to other subtypes, Limited Initial Suppression fires’ maximum
    values of final fire size, maximum growth event size, evacuations, structures
    threatened, and final costs were the highest. All analog fires destroyed very
    few structures relative to reported structures threatened (Fig. 4; Table 7). Fig.
    3 Daily growth (ha), personnel assigned, and projected cost by fire subtype by
    fire day Full size image Fig. 4 Structures destroyed and structures threatened
    by fire subtype by fire day. The 2012 Little Bear Fire destroyed 254 structures;
    to preserve resolution for all other fires the Y-axis of structures destroyed
    was set to a maximum of 10 Full size image Mixed suppression methods reported
    the lowest total number of structures threatened and the smallest final fire size
    (Figs. 3 and 4). This subtype demonstrated either one relatively small growth
    event when compared to other subtypes, or relatively consistent growth of a smaller
    magnitude (Fig. 3). Spikes in personnel assigned were generally early in the incident
    lifespan of mixed suppression methods relative to limited initial suppression
    and never full suppression. By comparison, always full suppression observed personnel
    spikes almost explicitly within early stages of an incident. Never Full Suppression
    fires had the fewest total number of personnel assigned, while Limited Initial
    Suppression subtypes had the highest (Table 7). Limited Initial Suppression fires
    burned the largest areas, exhibited the largest average single day growth events,
    evacuated the most total people, and had the highest estimated total cost. Always
    Full Suppression Fires destroyed the most structures yet grew the fewest number
    of days on average. Discussion If any fire can be described as the sum of its
    reported parts, then the Tamarack Fire is unique in how different reporting metrics
    compare to the broader population of USFS wildfires. No other fire demonstrated
    every characteristic of the Tamarack Fire, yet many shared important components.
    If a true “let-burn” fire was one that met every characteristic of the Tamarack
    Fire, and its initial strategy was driven by resource objectives (which the Tamarack
    was not), then only one fire could be construed to meet that mark. That fire,
    the 2018 Bald Mountain Fire on the Uinta-Wasatch Cache National Forest, was ignited
    by lightning within a wilderness area, had an initial strategy driven by resource
    objectives, and eventually destroyed one structure on private land. Bald Mountain’s
    fire subtype was limited initial suppression, while the Tamarack’s was mixed suppression
    methods. Differences in incident management team or local manager preferences
    may help explain this discrepancy in self-reported suppression methods. Indeed,
    every analog fire we identified had unique considerations which led to the observed
    outcomes. While we found 32 fires sharing many of the same characteristics of
    Tamarack, and thereby possibly contributing to the “let-burn” narrative, only
    six had initial strategies driven by the pursuit of achieving resource objectives
    — that is, objectives weighted less towards protection and more towards allowing
    fire to play its natural role in an ecosystem. The remaining 26 wildfires had
    initial strategies that appeared driven instead by a desire to minimize putting
    firefighters in extreme and hazardous conditions. Because of this, initial action
    to minimize fire size was infeasible and longer-term strategies were necessary.
    Of these 32 fires, eight were always full suppression, eight were mixed suppression
    methods, seven were limited initial suppression, and nine were never full suppression
    using the subtype definitions we developed. It is important to note that we did
    not attempt to quantify the prevalence of resource objective driven strategies
    across all USFS incidents — only those that met our criteria of characteristics
    displayed by the 2021 Tamarack Fire. Incident POOs within wilderness areas were
    prevalent within the analogs, with 14 analog ignitions within wilderness, two
    within a half mile of wilderness, and the other sixteen occurring outside a half
    mile buffer. The intertwined relationship between resource objectives and firefighter
    exposure to hazards, especially given management objectives and the remote and
    rugged nature of wilderness areas may continue to present difficult decisions
    to fire managers and warrants continued research (Iniguez et al. 2022). This is
    not to say that the analog fires identified here are the only impactful lightning-caused
    ignitions that have occurred on USFS lands over the period we assessed. For example,
    the 2020 Bridger Foothills Fire outside of Bozeman, Montana destroyed 68 structures
    but grew for only 5 days; the 2009 Mill Flat Fire just outside of New Harmony,
    Utah destroyed 11 structures over 39 days of growth, but its maximum fire spread
    rate was just under 1000 ha on its largest day. These two fires had different
    rationales for initial strategy selection and were locally impactful, yet our
    criteria set excluded them from inclusion in our analog fires. While these analog
    incidents are exceedingly rare, they are responsible for the majority (61.6%)
    of structures destroyed from fires within the 940 denominator fires of interest.
    However, when compared to human-caused fires originating on USFS lands these same
    loss levels appear relatively modest (Caggiano et al. 2020). Viewed through the
    lens of a Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) disaster fire, only one of the fires
    we identified destroyed over 50 structures (2012 Little Bear Fire, 254 structures
    destroyed). The outsized total resource commitment burden of these analog fires
    (25.8% of all resources across 940 denominator fires of interest) can be viewed
    along with structures destroyed as the toll that these infrequent yet consequential
    events take on the wildland fire management system. Given that only six analog
    fires’ initial strategies were driven by the pursuit of resource objectives, eliminating
    this option for fire managers would not in and of itself decrease these costs.
    Ultimately, our results do not appear to support the narrative of lightning-caused
    fires managed for resource objectives as a primary source of structure loss risk.
    It is important to contextualize structure destruction by fire cause. Our research
    corroborates findings from other efforts showing that most structures are destroyed
    by human ignitions originating on private lands (Downing et al. 2022). We believe
    our analog criteria have reasonably accounted for fires that share much of the
    burden for the “let burn” narrative that has emerged around USFS fire management
    policy, including those that generated significant sociopolitical interest, for
    example the 2018 Pole Creek and Bald Mountain fires in Utah and the 2017 Chetco
    Bar fire in Oregon (USFS 2019, US Government Accountability Office 2020). We found
    that in most cases, analog fires had initial strategies driven by severe hazards
    to firefighters, and in only six cases had resource objectives as driving factors.
    This is an important distinction to make when messaging around the ”why” a series
    of incident strategies was selected, because it may have a substantial impact
    on how the message is received. Conclusions Climate change, combined with increasing
    aridity (Abatzoglou and Parks 2016) and fire season duration (Westerling et al.
    2006) will combine to increase the challenge and complexity to land management
    agencies with fire management responsibilities (Essen et al. 2022). It has been
    well established that meeting ecological and land management objectives requires
    an expansion of wildfire within fire-adapted systems, as well as to reduce the
    risk of future high severity wildfire events (He et al. 2015). The fire management
    community has increasingly demonstrated competence in making risk-informed decisions
    that balance landscape health and community protection objectives, but decision
    makers are incentivized to minimize short-term risks over maximizing long-term
    risk reduction (Calkin et al. 2021; Thompson et al. 2018, Young et al. 2022).
    Indeed, in four of the past 11 years the USFS issued direction that could be perceived
    to reinforce a fire-exclusion paradigm (USFS 2012, USFS 2020a, b, USFS 2021, USFS
    2022). How land and fire management organizations prepare for and manage for low-probability,
    high-consequence events is critical to informing their risk tolerance. Defining
    consistent and durable risk tolerances of land management agencies is necessary
    to shift society’s relationship with fire and support local manager decision making.
    Alternative methods to define and communicate incident strategy is an area for
    future research exploration. As we have demonstrated, reported ICS-209 strategies
    can have very different motivations (firefighter safety vs. resource objectives).
    Extreme fire conditions and or resource scarcity during periods of heavy fire
    activity may preclude the use of perimeter control actions, necessitating operational
    nuance to limit threat to the degree possible given on-site conditions. The reality
    of strategy on these complex incidents will be a combination of actions to limit
    losses to highly valued resources and assets while balancing exposing firefighters
    to hazards. Yet this strategy may be communicated internally and externally as
    simply “full suppression.” Restricting terminology around strategy to a narrowly
    defined set of four options may present difficulties when aiming to accurately
    describe the unique and complex set of spatiotemporal, ecological, and sociopolitical
    factors that inform strategic decisions on incidents. A limited palette of strategic
    reporting categories may be partially responsible for the falsely premised “let
    burn” narrative. Our results suggest that a “let burn” strategy is not a predominant
    USFS management approach. However, because these rare events often result in damage
    and disruption to communities, additional investigation could help inform how
    to better prepare for and mitigate these events and how to communicate the complexity
    of the decision process. Adaptive learning and management to support improved
    wildfire strategies can help achieve resilient landscapes, fire adapted communities,
    and a safe and effective response. Availability of data and materials The data

  title: Consequential lightning-caused wildfires and the “let burn” narrative
  verbatim_quote1: '"Initial strategies were driven by resource objectives for only
    six of the 32 wildfires; firefighter hazard mitigation was the primary driver
    of all others. No fire exhibited every characteristic of the Tamarack Fire. Analog
    fires accounted for a small percent (3.4%) of large (> 121 ha) USFS lightning-caused
    ignitions. These fires were responsible for 61.6% of structures destroyed and
    25.8% of total personnel commitments of large lightning-caused USFS fires."'
  verbatim_quote2: '"Lightning-ignited wildfires that could have resulted in sociopolitical
    controversy are rare, and those with strategies driven by resource objective are
    even rarer. More commonly, risks posed to firefighters from terrain, snags, or
    accessibility are factors driving strategy, even when fires ignite within wilderness
    areas. These results suggest that simple definitions of strategy such as those
    reported within the ICS-209 lack clarity and may increase sociopolitical pressure
    on the agency to continue aggressive fire exclusion strategies."'

    PDF 1 Introduction IoT, composed of a variety of devices, is widely used in various
    applications. IoT makes devices connected and remote data transmission possible
    and easy. IoT technologies can be applied to drones to form Internet of Drones
    (IoD). In IoD, drones can help the government to gather or transmit data for disaster
    relief, investigation of terrain, military, fire detection and so on. This approach
    makes people get required information remotely while they can be away from danger.
    Although IoD possesses plenty of superior properties, how to ensure its security
    is a tough and urgent issue. In 2017, Won et al. proposed certificateless cryptographic
    protocols for drone-based smart city applications [1]. Won et al.’s first protocol
    is designed for one-to-one communication and provides mutual authentication, key
    agreement and user revocation. Won et al.’s second protocol is designed for one-to-many
    communication, where a multi-recipient encryption scheme is adopted such that
    drones can share sensitive data with multiple smart devices. Won et al.’s third
    protocol is designed for many-to-one communication, where a certificateless data
    aggregation scheme makes drones collect data from multiple smart devices. In 2018,
    Semal et al. proposed a certificateless-group authenticated key agreement protocol
    CL-GAKA and claimed that CL-GAKA could ensure revocation, non-repudiation, denial
    of service prevention and conditional privacy for drones [2]. In 2018, Cheon et
    al. proposed a real-time homomorphic authenticated encryption scheme, LinHAE,
    to protect drones against eavesdropping and forgery attacks [3]. In 2019, Alsamhi
    et al. provided a comprehensive overview of the recent research on collaborative
    drone and IoT that improve the real-time application of smart cities [4]. In 2019,
    Choudhary et al. proposed an efficient medium access control (MAC) protocol for
    military applications [5]. To ensure security, Choudhary et al.’s protocol uses
    a deep learning framework to generating trajectories for drones. The above drone-related
    schemes are designed for drones of different applications that possess different
    properties. However, the required computation load of them is not light enough.
    As a result, Zhang et al. proposed a lightweight authentication and key agreement
    scheme for Internet of Drones by using secure one-way hash function and XOR operation
    [6]. They claimed that their scheme cloud ensure both computational efficiency
    and communication efficiency and could resist impersonation attack, server spoofing
    attack, drone capture attack and modification attack. After thoroughly analyzing
    Zhang et al.’s scheme, we find that it suffers from some security flaws. Firstly,
    user anonymity cannot ensure as claimed. Secondly, an attacker can mount denial-of-service
    attack to consume the control server’s computational resource and occupy a drone
    that a legal user has ever accessed. Thirdly, an attacker can mount replay attack
    to cheat a drone by sending an intercepted message. The rest of this paper is
    shown as follows. Section 2 reviews Zhang et al.’s scheme. The found security
    flaws that Zhang et al.’s scheme suffers from are shown in Sect. 3. At last, some
    conclusions are drawn in Sect. 4. 2 Review of Zhang et al.’s Scheme Zhang et al.’s
    scheme adopts XOR operation and one-way hash function. In their scheme, three
    parties, control server, user and drone, are involved. At first, the control server
    selects system parameters. Before being deployed, a drone needs to register with
    the control server. When a user wants to utilize a drone, he/she needs to register
    with the control server. Thereupon, a registered user can access a legal drone
    via the control server’s help. Notations used in Zhang et al.’s scheme are listed
    in Table 1. Zhang et al.’s scheme is composed of four phases, setup phase, user
    registration phase, drone registration phase and authentication phase. The details
    are as follows. Table 1. Notations used in Zhang et al.’s scheme Full size table
    2.1 Setup Phase In this phase, CS chooses its master private key and mask key,
    selects public system parameters and generates its pseudonym with the chosen identity.
    In the following, how CS works in this phase is shown. Step 1. CS chooses 160-bit
    random numbers MSK, k and n as its master private key, its mask key and a public
    system parameter. Step 2. CS chooses a one-way hash function \\(h: \\{0, 1\\}^*
    \\rightarrow Z_n^*\\). Step 3. CS chooses its identity \\(ID_s\\) and computes
    its pseudonym \\(PID_s=h(ID_s \\parallel k)\\). Step 4. CS keeps its master private
    key MSK and mask key k secretly and makes h, n and \\(PID_s\\) public. 2.2 User
    Registration Phase When a user wants to utilize a drone, he/she needs to register
    with the control server. In this phase, a new user \\(U_i\\) chooses his/her identity
    and password, and CS computes \\(U_i\\)’s pseudonym and master private key for
    \\(U_i\\). In this phase, data is transmitted over a secure channel. The details
    are as follows: Step 1. \\(U_i\\) randomly selects his/her identity \\(ID_i\\)
    and password \\(PW_i\\). Then \\(U_i\\) sends \\(ID_i\\) with the registration
    request to CS over a secure channel. Step 2. After receiving \\(ID_i\\) and the
    registration request sent by \\(U_i\\), CS computes \\(ID_i\\)’s pseudonym \\(PID_i
    = h(ID_i \\parallel k)\\) and \\(U_i\\)’s master private key \\(ai = h(ID_i \\parallel
    MSK)\\) and stores \\((ID_i, a_i, PID_i)\\) in \\(L_s\\) secretly. Then CS sends
    \\((a_i, PID_i, PID_j)\\) to \\(U_i\\) over a secure channel. Step 3. After receiving
    \\((a_i, PID_i, PID_j)\\), \\(U_i\\) computes \\(a_i^m = h(ID_i \\parallel PW_i)
    \\oplus a_i\\) and \\(PID_i^m = h(ID_i \\parallel PW_i)\\oplus PID_i\\) and stores
    \\((a_i^m, PID_i^m, PID_j)\\) secretly. 2.3 Drone Registration Phase Before being
    deployed, a drone needs to register with the control server. In this phase, a
    new drone \\(V_j\\) sends its identity to CS. CS computes \\(V_j\\)’s pseudonym
    and master private key for \\(V_j\\). In this phase, data is transmitted over
    a secure channel. The details are as follows: Step 1. \\(V_j\\) randomly selects
    its identity \\(ID_j\\). Then \\(V_j\\) sends \\(ID_j\\) with the registration
    request to CS over a secure channel. Step 2. Upon receiving \\(ID_j\\) and the
    registration request sent by \\(V_j\\), CS computes \\(V_j\\)’s pseudonym \\(PID_j
    = h(ID_j \\parallel k)\\) and \\(V_j\\)’s master private key \\(a_j = h(ID_j \\parallel
    MSK)\\) and stores \\((ID_j, a_j, PID_j)\\) in \\(L_s\\). Then CS sends \\((a_j,
    PID_j)\\) to \\(V_j\\) over a secure channel. Step 3. After receiving \\((a_j,
    PID_j)\\), \\(V_j\\) stores them secretly. 2.4 Authentication Phase After registration
    phase, a registered \\(U_i\\) and a registered \\(V_j\\) can communicate with
    each other securely with a negotiated session key. In this phase, data is transmitted
    over a public channel. This phase is depicted in Fig. 1, and the details are as
    follows: Step 1. \\(U_i\\) enters his/her identity \\(ID_i\\) and password \\(PW_i\\).
    Then his/her mobile device computes \\(PID_i=PID_i^m \\oplus h(IDi \\parallel
    PW_i)\\) and \\(a_i=a_i^m \\oplus h(ID_i \\parallel PW_i)\\). Step 2. \\(U_i\\)’s
    mobile device chooses a 160-bit random number \\(r_1 \\in Z_n^*\\) and the current
    timestamp \\(ST_1\\). Step 3. \\(U_i\\)’s mobile device computes \\(M_1=h(PID_s
    \\parallel ST_1)\\oplus PID_i\\), \\(M_2=h(PID_i \\parallel PID_s \\parallel a_i)\\oplus
    r_1\\), \\(M_3=h(PID_i \\parallel PID_s \\parallel a_i \\parallel r_1)\\oplus
    PID_j\\) and \\(M_4=h(PID_i \\parallel PID_j \\parallel PID_s \\parallel a_i \\parallel
    r_1)\\). Step 4. \\(U_i\\)’s mobile device sends \\((M_1, M_2, M_3, M_4, ST_1)\\)
    to CS over a public channel. Step 5. Upon receiving \\((M_1, M_2, M_3, M_4, ST_1)\\)
    from \\(U_i\\), CS checks if \\(|time - ST_1| \\le \\varDelta {T}\\), where time
    is the current time when \\((M_1, M_2, M_3, M_4, ST_1)\\) is received. If it does
    not hold, this request is rejection; otherwise, this phase proceeds. Step 6. CS
    computes \\(PID_i''=M_1 \\oplus h(PID_s \\parallel ST_1)\\) and retrieves \\(a_i''\\)
    in \\(L_s\\). Step 7. CS computes \\(r_1''=M_2 \\oplus h(PID_i'' \\parallel PID_s
    \\parallel a_i'')\\), \\(PID_j''=M_3 \\oplus h(PID_i'' \\parallel PID_s \\parallel
    a_i'' \\parallel r_1'')\\) and \\(M_4''=h(PID_i'' \\parallel PID_j'' \\parallel
    PID_s \\parallel a_i'' \\parallel r_1'')\\). CS checks whether \\(M_4''=M_4\\)
    or not. If they are not equal, CS rejects the authentication request; otherwise,
    \\(U_i\\) is authenticated by CS successfully, and CS retrieves \\(a_j''\\) in
    \\(L_s\\) with \\(PID_j''\\). Step 8. CS computes \\(M_5=h(PID_j'' \\parallel
    a_j'')\\oplus r_1''\\), \\(M_6=h(PID_j'' \\parallel PID_s \\parallel a_j'' \\parallel
    r_1'')\\oplus PID_i''\\) and \\(M_7=h(PID_i'' \\parallel PID_j'' \\parallel PID_s
    \\parallel a_j'' \\parallel r_1'')\\). Step 9. CS sends \\((M_5, M_6, M_7)\\)
    to \\(V_j\\) over a public channel. Step 10. Upon receiving \\((M_5, M_6, M_7)\\)
    sent by CS, \\(V_j\\) computes \\(r_1''''=M_5 \\oplus h(PID_j \\parallel a_j)\\),
    \\(PID_i''''=M_6 \\oplus h(PID_j \\parallel PID_s \\parallel a_j \\parallel r_1'''')\\)
    and \\(M_7''=h(PID_i'''' \\parallel PID_j \\parallel PID_s \\parallel a_j \\parallel
    r_1'''')\\). \\(V_j\\) checks whether \\(M_7''=M_7\\) or not. If they are not
    equal, \\(V_j\\) rejects this request; otherwise, CS is authenticated by \\(V_j\\)
    successfully, and \\(V_j\\) chooses a 160-bit random number \\(r_2 \\in Z_n^*\\).
    Step 11. \\(V_j\\) computes \\(M_8=h(PID_j \\parallel PID_i'''' \\parallel r_1'''')
    \\oplus r_2\\), \\(M_9=h(r_1'''' \\parallel r_2)\\), the session key \\(SK_{ji}=h(PID_i''''
    \\parallel PID_j \\parallel PID_s \\parallel M_9)\\) and \\(M_{10}=h(PID_i''''
    \\parallel PID_j \\parallel PID_s \\parallel r_1'''' \\parallel r_2 \\parallel
    M_9)\\). Then, \\(V_j\\) sends \\((M_8, M_{10})\\) to \\(U_i\\). Step 12. Upon
    receiving \\((M_8, M_{10})\\) sent by \\(V_j\\), \\(U_i\\) computes \\(r_2''=M_8

    r_2'')\\) and \\(M_{10}''=h(PID_i \\parallel PID_j \\parallel PID_s \\parallel
    r_1 \\parallel r_2'' \\parallel M_9'')\\). Step 13. \\(U_i\\) checks if \\(M_{10}''=M_{10}\\).
    If it does not hold, \\(U_i\\) rejects this request; otherwise, \\(V_j\\) is authenticated
    by \\(U_i\\) successfully, and \\(U_i\\) computes the session key \\(SK_{ij}=h(PID_i
    \\parallel PID_j \\parallel PID_s \\parallel M_9'')\\). Fig. 1. Authentication
    phase of Zhang et al.’s scheme Full size image 3 Security Analysis Zhang et al.’s
    scheme claimed that their solution could defend against impersonation attack,
    server spoofing attack, drone capture attack and modification attack. Unfortunately,
    we find that it suffers from some security flaws. Firstly, an attacker can use
    public parameters to reveal \\(U_i\\)’s pseudonym \\(PID_i\\), and user anonymity
    is compromised. Secondly, because the timestamp \\(ST_1\\) is only used to conceal
    \\(U_i\\)’s pseudonym \\(PID_i\\) in authentication phase, an attacker can mount
    denial-of-service attack by forging \\(U_i\\)’s request to consume CS’s computational
    resource and to occupy a drone that \\(U_i\\) has ever accessed. Thirdly, an attacker
    can mount replay attack to bypass CS and be authenticated by \\(V_j\\). How these
    found security flaws damage Zhang et al.’s scheme is shown as follows. 3.1 Vulnerability
    to Compromised User Anonymity After analyzing Zhang et al.’s scheme, it is found
    that it cannot ensure user anonymity as claimed. This scenario is depicted in
    Fig. 2, and the details are as follows. Fig. 2. Compromised user anonymity that
    Zhang et al.’s scheme suffers from Full size image In authentication phase, \\(U_i\\)’s
    mobile device computes \\(M_1=h(PID_s \\parallel ST_1)\\oplus PID_i\\), \\(M_2=h(PID_i
    \\parallel PID_s \\parallel a_i)\\oplus r_1\\), \\(M_3=h(PID_i \\parallel PID_s
    \\parallel a_i \\parallel r_1)\\oplus PID_j\\) and \\(M_4=h(PID_i \\parallel PID_j
    \\parallel PID_s \\parallel a_i \\parallel r_1)\\). Then, \\(U_i\\)’s mobile device
    sends \\((M_1, M_2, M_3, M_4, ST_1)\\) to CS over a public channel. Because the
    transmission media is public, anyone can eavesdrop. As a result, an attacker can
    intercept \\((M_1, M_2, M_3, M_4, ST_1)\\). Because CS’s pseudonym \\(PID_s\\)
    is public, the attacker can reveal \\(U_i\\)’s pseudonym \\(PID_i\\) by computing
    \\(h(PID_s \\parallel ST_1)\\oplus M_1=h(PID_s \\parallel ST_1)\\oplus h(PID_s
    \\parallel ST_1)\\oplus PID_i=PID_i\\). Although \\(PID_i\\) is not \\(U_i\\)’s
    real identity \\(ID_i\\), \\(PID_i\\) is fixed all the time. As a result, Zhang
    et al.’s scheme cannot ensure user anonymity as claimed. 3.2 Vulnerability to
    Denial-of-service Attack In authentication phase, \\(U_i\\)’s mobile device computes
    \\(M_1\\), \\(M_2\\), \\(M_3\\) and \\(M_4\\), where \\(M_1=h(PID_s \\parallel
    ST_1)\\oplus PID_i\\), \\(M_2=h(PID_i \\parallel PID_s \\parallel a_i)\\oplus
    r_1\\), \\(M_3=h(PID_i \\parallel PID_s \\parallel a_i \\parallel r_1)\\oplus
    PID_j\\) and \\(M_4=h(PID_i \\parallel PID_j \\parallel PID_s \\parallel a_i \\parallel
    r_1)\\). Then, \\(U_i\\)’s mobile device sends \\((M_1, M_2, M_3, M_4, ST_1)\\)
    to CS over a public channel. After receiving \\((M_1, M_2, M_3, M_4, ST_1)\\),
    CS checks if \\(|time - ST_1| \\le \\varDelta {T}\\), where time is the current
    time when \\((M_1, M_2, M_3, M_4, ST_1)\\) is received. If it holds, CS computes
    \\(PID_i''=M_1 \\oplus h(PID_s \\parallel ST_1)\\) and retrieves \\(a_i''\\) in
    \\(L_s\\). Then, CS computes \\(r_1''=M_2 \\oplus h(PID_i'' \\parallel PID_s \\parallel
    a_i'')\\), \\(PID_j''=M_3 \\oplus h(PID_i'' \\parallel PID_s \\parallel a_i''
    \\parallel r_1'')\\) and \\(M_4''=h(PID_i'' \\parallel PID_j'' \\parallel PID_s
    \\parallel a_i'' \\parallel r_1'')\\). CS checks whether \\(M_4''=M_4\\) or not.
    If they are equal, CS authenticates \\(U_i\\) successfully, and CS retrieves \\(a_j''\\)
    in \\(L_s\\) with \\(PID_j''\\). Consequently, CS computes \\(M_5=h(PID_j'' \\parallel
    a_j'')\\oplus r_1''\\), \\(M_6=h(PID_j'' \\parallel PID_s \\parallel a_j'' \\parallel
    r_1'')\\oplus PID_i''\\) and \\(M_7=h(PID_i'' \\parallel PID_j'' \\parallel PID_s
    \\parallel a_j'' \\parallel r_1'')\\), and CS sends \\((M_5, M_6, M_7)\\) to \\(V_j\\)
    over a public channel. Upon receiving \\((M_5, M_6, M_7)\\) sent by CS, \\(V_j\\)
    computes \\(r_1''''=M_5 \\oplus h(PID_j \\parallel a_j)\\), \\(PID_i''''=M_6 \\oplus
    h(PID_j \\parallel PID_s \\parallel a_j \\parallel r_1'''')\\) and \\(M_7''=h(PID_i''''
    \\parallel PID_j \\parallel PID_s \\parallel a_j \\parallel r_1'''')\\). \\(V_j\\)
    checks whether \\(M_7''=M_7\\) or not. If they are equal, \\(V_j\\) authenticates
    CS successfully, and \\(V_j\\) chooses a 160-bit random number \\(r_2 \\in Z_n^*\\).
    \\(V_j\\) computes \\(M_8=h(PID_j \\parallel PID_i'''' \\parallel r_1'''')\\oplus
    r_2\\), \\(M_9=h(r_1'''' \\parallel r_2)\\), the session key \\(SK_{ji}=h(PID_i''''
    \\parallel PID_j \\parallel PID_s \\parallel M_9)\\) and \\(M_{10}=h(PID_i''''
    \\parallel PID_j \\parallel PID_s \\parallel r_1'''' \\parallel r_2 \\parallel
    M_9)\\). Then, \\(V_j\\) sends \\((M_8, M_{10})\\) to \\(U_i\\). After receiving
    \\((M_8, M_{10})\\) sent by \\(V_j\\), \\(U_i\\) computes \\(r_2''=M_8\\oplus
    h(PID_j \\parallel PID_i \\parallel r_1)\\), \\(M_9''=h(r_1 \\parallel r_2'')\\)
    and \\(M_{10}''=h(PID_i \\parallel PID_j \\parallel PID_s \\parallel r_1 \\parallel
    r_2'' \\parallel M_9'')\\). \\(U_i\\) checks if \\(M_{10}''=M_{10}\\). If it holds,
    \\(U_i\\) authenticates \\(V_j\\) successfully, and \\(U_i\\) computes the session
    key \\(SK_{ij}=h(PID_i \\parallel PID_j \\parallel PID_s \\parallel M_9'')\\).
    Because the transmission channel is public, an attacker can intercept all transmitted
    messages including \\((M_1, M_2, M_3, M_4, ST_1)\\). After intercepting (\\(M_1\\),
    \\(M_2\\), \\(M_3\\), \\(M_4\\), \\(ST_1\\)), the attacker can forge \\(U_i\\)’s
    request. This scenario is illustrated in Fig. 3. First, the attacker reveals \\(U_i\\)’s
    pseudonym \\(PID_i\\) by computing \\(h(PID_s \\parallel ST_1)\\oplus M_1=h(PID_s
    \\parallel ST_1)\\oplus h(PID_s \\parallel ST_1)\\oplus PID_i=PID_i\\). Second,
    the attacker uses a fresh timestamp \\(ST_1^*\\) to compute \\(M_1^*=h(PIDs \\parallel
    ST_1^*)\\oplus PID_i\\). Finally, the attacker sends \\((M_1^*, M_2, M_3, M_4,
    ST_1^*)\\) to CS. Fig. 3. Denial-of-service attack that Zhang et al.’s scheme
    suffers from Full size image After receiving \\((M_1^*, M_2, M_3, M_4, ST_1^*)\\),
    CS checks if \\(|time-ST_1^*| \\le \\varDelta {T}\\), where time is the current
    time when \\((M_1^*, M_2, M_3, M_4, ST_1^*)\\) is received. Because \\(ST_1^*\\)
    is fresh, it must hold. Consequently, CS computes \\(PID_i''=M_1^*\\oplus h(PID_s
    \\parallel ST_1^*)\\) and retrieves \\(a_i''\\) in \\(L_s\\). Then, CS computes
    \\(r_1''=M_2\\oplus h(PID_i''\\parallel PID_s \\parallel a_i'')\\), \\(PID_j''=M_3\\oplus
    h(PID_i''\\parallel PID_s \\parallel a_i'' \\parallel r_1'')\\) and \\(M_4''=h(PID_i''
    \\parallel PID_j'' \\parallel PID_s \\parallel a_i'' \\parallel r_1'')\\). CS
    checks whether \\(M_4''=M_4\\) or not. Unfortunately, they must be equal because
    \\(M_2\\), \\(M_3\\) and \\(M_4\\) are indeed computed by \\(U_i\\) associated
    with \\(PID_i\\). Then CS computes \\(M_5\\), \\(M_6\\) and \\(M_7\\), and CS
    sends \\((M_5, M_6, M_7)\\) to \\(V_j\\) over a public channel. Upon receiving
    \\((M_5, M_6, M_7)\\) sent by CS, \\(V_j\\) computes \\(r_1''''=M_5\\oplus h(PID_j
    \\parallel a_j)\\), \\(PID_i''''=M_6\\oplus h(PID_j \\parallel PID_s \\parallel
    a_j \\parallel r_1'''')\\) and \\(M_7''=h(PID_i'''' \\parallel PID_j \\parallel
    PID_s \\parallel a_j \\parallel r_1'''')\\). \\(V_j\\) checks if \\(M_7''=M_7\\).
    Unfortunately, it must hold because \\(M_5\\), \\(M_6\\) and \\(M_7\\) are indeed
    computed by CS. Thereupon, authentication phase will proceed. In authentication
    phase, \\(U_i\\) does not need to send a response back to \\(V_j\\) to make \\(V_j\\)
    ensure that the other communication party shares a session key with itself. This
    approach and the above make \\(V_j\\) regard that it communicates with a user
    associated with \\(PID_i\\). Unfortunately, the other communication party is the
    attacker who forges a request \\((M_1^*, M_2, M_3, M_4, ST_1^*)\\), where \\(M_1^*=h(PID_s
    \\parallel ST_1^*)\\oplus (h(PID_s \\parallel ST_1)\\oplus M_1)=h(PID_s \\parallel
    ST_1^*)\\oplus (h(PID_s \\parallel ST_1)\\oplus h(PID_s \\parallel ST_1)\\oplus
    PID_i)=h(PID_s \\parallel ST_1^*)\\oplus PID_i\\). That is, the forged request
    makes the attacker authenticated by CS successfully. This consumes CS’s computational
    resource because CS will compute \\(M_5\\), \\(M_6\\) and \\(M_7\\). Furthermore,
    this also makes the drone \\(V_j\\) occupied by the attacker such that \\(V_j\\)
    cannot provide other users services. Due to the above, the attacker can easily
    mount denial-of-service attack on Zhang et al.’s scheme. 3.3 Vulnerability to
    Replay Attack As mentioned above, the transmission channel is public, and an attacker
    can intercept all transmitted messages including \\((M_5, M_6, M_7)\\) sent by
    CS, where \\(M_5=h(PID_j'' \\parallel a_j'')\\oplus r_1''\\), \\(M_6=h(PID_j''
    \\parallel PID_s \\parallel a_j'' \\parallel r_1'')\\oplus PID_i''\\) and \\(M_7=h(PID_i''
    \\parallel PID_j'' \\parallel PID_s \\parallel a_j'' \\parallel r_1'')\\). When
    an attacker sends the intercepted message \\((M_5, M_6, M_7)\\) to \\(V_j\\),
    \\(V_j\\) will compute \\(r_1''''=M_5\\oplus h(PID_j \\parallel a_j)\\), \\(PID_i''''=M_6\\oplus
    h(PID_j \\parallel PID_s \\parallel a_j \\parallel r_1'''')\\) and \\(M_7''=h(PID_i''''
    \\parallel PID_j \\parallel PID_s \\parallel a_j \\parallel r_1'''')\\). Then
    \\(V_j\\) checks whether \\(M_7''=M_7\\) or not. Unfortunately, they must be equal
    because the message \\((M_5, M_6, M_7)\\) is indeed sent by CS previously and
    no fresh timestamp is included in \\((M_5, M_6, M_7)\\). Thereupon, \\(V_j\\)
    will regard that \\((M_5, M_6, M_7)\\) is sent by CS and the other communication
    party is associated with \\(PID_i''''\\). Then \\(V_j\\) chooses a 160-bit random
    number \\(r_2 \\in Z_n^*\\), computes \\(M_8=h(PID_j \\parallel PID_i'''' \\parallel
    r_1'''')\\oplus r_2\\), \\(M_9=h(r_1'''' \\parallel r_2)\\), the session key \\(SK_{ji}=h(PID_i''''
    \\parallel PID_j \\parallel PID_s \\parallel M_9)\\) and \\(M_{10}=h(PID_i''''
    \\parallel PID_j \\parallel PID_s \\parallel r_1'''' \\parallel r_2 \\parallel
    M_9)\\) and sends \\((M_8, M_{10})\\) to \\(U_i\\) impersonated by the attacker.
    This scenario is depicted in Fig. 4. Fig. 4. Replay attack that Zhang et al.’s
    scheme suffers from Full size image From the above, it is obvious that an attacker
    can mount replay attack by sending \\((M_5, M_6, M_7)\\) sent by CS previously
    to \\(V_j\\). With this approach, the attacker can bypass CS to make \\(V_j\\)
    regard that \\((M_5, M_6, M_7)\\) is sent by CS and the other communication party
    is associated with \\(PID_i''''\\). 4 Conclusions Zhang et al. proposed an authentication
    and key agreement scheme for Internet of Drones to ensure the security of communication
    between a registered drone and a registered user by adopting XOR operation and
    one-way hash function. After thoroughly analyzing their scheme, we find that it
    suffers from compromised user anonymity, denial-of-service attack and replay attack.
    To overcome the found security flaws, some modifications must be made. Firstly,
    the anonymity of \\(U_i\\)’s pseudonym \\(PID_i\\) has to be ensured. Secondly,
    the fresh timestamp \\(ST_1\\) should be included in \\(M_1\\), \\(M_2\\), \\(M_3\\)
    or \\(M_4\\). Thirdly, an extra fresh timestamp should be included in \\(M_5\\),
    \\(M_6\\), or \\(M_7\\). With proper modifications, the security of Internet of
    Drones can be ensured. References Won, J., Seo, S.H., Bertino, E.: Certificateless

  title: A Critique of a Lightweight Authentication and Key Agreement Scheme for Internet
    of Drones
  verbatim_quote1: In authentication phase, \(U_i\)’s mobile device computes \(M_1=h(PID_s
    \parallel ST_1)\oplus PID_i\), \(M_2=h(PID_i \parallel PID_s \parallel a_i)\oplus
    r_1\), \(M_3=h(PID_i \parallel PID_s \parallel a_i \parallel r_1)\oplus PID_j\)
    and \(M_4=h(PID_i \parallel PID_j \parallel PID_s \parallel a_i \parallel r_1)\).
    Then, \(U_i\)’s mobile device sends \((M_1, M_2, M_3, M_4, ST_1)\) to CS over
    a public channel. Because the transmission media is public, anyone can eavesdrop.
    As a result, an attacker can intercept \((M_1, M_2, M_3, M_4, ST_1)\). Because
    CS’s pseudonym \(PID_s\) is public, the attacker can reveal \(U_i\)’s pseudonym
    \(PID_i\) by computing \(h(PID_s \parallel ST_1)\oplus M_1=h(PID_s \parallel ST_1)\oplus
    h(PID_s \parallel ST_1)\oplus PID_i=PID_i\). Although \(PID_i\) is not \(U_i\)’s
    real identity \(ID_i\), \(PID_i\) is fixed all the time. As a result, Zhang et
    al.’s scheme cannot ensure user anonymity as claimed.
  verbatim_quote2: Because the transmission channel is public, an attacker can intercept
    all transmitted messages including \((M_5, M_6, M_7)\) sent by CS, where \(M_5=h(PID_j'
    \parallel a_j')\oplus r_1'\), \(M_6=h(PID_j' \parallel PID_s \parallel a_j' \parallel
    r_1')\oplus PID_i'\) and \(M_7=h(PID_i' \parallel PID_j' \parallel PID_s \parallel
    a_j' \parallel r_1')\). When an attacker sends the intercepted message \((M_5,
    M_6, M_7)\) to \(V_j\), \(V_j\) will compute \(r_1''=M_5\oplus h(PID_j \parallel
    a_j)\), \(PID_i''=M_6\oplus h(PID_j \parallel PID_s \parallel a_j \parallel r_1'')\)
    and \(M_7'=h(PID_i'' \parallel PID_j \parallel PID_s \parallel a_j \parallel r_1'')\).
    Then \(V_j\) checks whether \(M_7'=M_7\) or not. Unfortunately, they must be equal
    because the message \((M_5, M_6, M_7)\) is indeed sent by CS previously and no
    fresh timestamp is included in \((M_5, M_6, M_7)\). Thereupon, \(V_j\) will regard
    that \((M_5, M_6, M_7)\) is sent by CS and the other communication party is associated
    with \(PID_i''\). Then \(V_j\) chooses a 160-bit random number \(r_2 \in Z_n^*\),
    computes \(M_8=h(PID_j \parallel PID_i'' \parallel r_1'')\oplus r_2\), \(M_9=h(r_1''
    \parallel r_2)\), the session key \(SK_{ji}=h(PID_i'' \parallel PID_j \parallel
    PID_s \parallel M_9)\) and \(M_{10}=h(PID_i'' \parallel PID_j \parallel PID_s
    \parallel r_1'' \parallel r_2 \parallel M_9)\) and sends \((M_8, M_{10})\) to
    \(U_i\) impersonated by the attacker. This scenario is depicted in Fig. 4.
  verbatim_quote3: From the above, it is obvious that an attacker can mount replay
    attack by sending \((M_5, M_6, M_7)\) sent by CS previously to \(V_j\). With this
    approach, the attacker can bypass CS to make \(V_j\) regard that \((M_5, M_6,
    M_7)\) is sent by CS and the other communication party is associated with \(PID_i''\).
- analysis: The research study pertains to IoT node site selection to optimize wireless
    communication for smart agricultural systems. An innovative fast terrain sampling
    method is proposed utilizing a multi-sensor fusion approach to gather point-cloud
    data of the experimental site terrain. A comprehensive objective function is formulated
    to account for electromagnetic wave free-space and diffraction losses, enabling
    the optimization of router and gateway locations using the k-means and particle
    swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms. The results highlight the sensitivity of
    the PSO algorithm's execution time to parameter variations. Additionally, the
    effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through on-site collection of
    received signal-strength indication (RSSI) data, demonstrating significantly improved
    communication quality at the optimized point compared to nearby locations. The
    study also emphasizes the need for further investigation to refine the calculation
    of diffraction loss in the objective function. The proposed tool's ability to
    generate 3D terrain models more efficiently than traditional methods holds promise
    for future applications in soil moisture analysis, rainfall and moisture direction
    inversion, and plant light exposure prediction.

  description: With the development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, modern
    agriculture is moving in the direction of 4.0. The Agricultural IoT is inseparable
    from wireless communication. However, in traditional agricultural IoT router and
    gateway site selection, the influence of the actual terrain on transmission loss
    is not considered, which results in node power wastage and increased maintenance
    costs. Based on a multi-sensor fusion algorithm, a fast terrain sampler is designed
    in this study to collect point-cloud data of the experimental site terrain. A
    reasonable objective function is then designed under the premise of consideration
    of the electromagnetic wave free-space and diffraction losses, and the locations
    of the routers and gateway are optimized based on k-means and particle swarm optimization
    (PSO) algorithm. Simulations show that the running time of the PSO algorithm is
    very sensitive to the changes in the execution parameters, and the improved PSO
    algorithm converges faster than the genetic algorithm (GA) in all three initialization

    Abstract With the development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, modern agriculture
    is moving in the direction of 4.0. The Agricultural IoT is inseparable from wireless
    communication. However, in traditional agricultural IoT router and gateway site
    selection, the influence of the actual terrain on transmission loss is not considered,
    which results in node power wastage and increased maintenance costs. Based on
    a multi-sensor fusion algorithm, a fast terrain sampler is designed in this study
    to collect point-cloud data of the experimental site terrain. A reasonable objective
    function is then designed under the premise of consideration of the electromagnetic
    wave free-space and diffraction losses, and the locations of the routers and gateway
    are optimized based on k-means and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm.
    Simulations show that the running time of the PSO algorithm is very sensitive
    to the changes in the execution parameters, and the improved PSO algorithm converges
    faster than the genetic algorithm (GA) in all three initialization methods. After
    collecting field terrain data, five interpolation methods were compared, and the
    nearest-neighbor algorithm is used to obtain the terrain model. On-site collection
    of received signal-strength indication (RSSI) shows that the communication quality
    of the optimal point selected via this algorithm is significantly higher than
    those of nearby points. At the same time, it is proved that the RSSI data has
    serious discontinuities, so the traditional gradient descent method is not suitable
    for solving the objective function in this work. Therefore, the algorithm used
    herein is of great significance for the site selection of agricultural Internet
    of Things nodes. However, since there are many ways to calculate the diffraction
    loss, the objective function of this work still needs more correction studies.
    The tool proposed in this work can obtain a 3D model of farmland faster than traditional
    surveying and mapping methods. With future research, the 3D model may be applied
    to soil moisture analysis, rainfall and moisture direction inversion, and plant
    light exposure prediction. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords

    algorithmWireless transmission lossExtended Kalman filter 1. Introduction Agricultural
    Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network in which the physical components,
    such as animals, plants, environmental elements, production tools, and various
    virtual “objects” in the agricultural system, are connected to the Internet through
    agricultural information sensing devices for information exchange and communication
    (Xu et al., 2022). At present, agricultural IoT has been applied to water-saving
    irrigation, crop growth environment detection, and aquaculture. With the advancements
    in technology, agricultural IoT will move towards full-scale interconnection of
    everything (Thilakarathne et al., 2021). IoT is often inseparable from communication.
    In wireless signal transmission, signals are not only attenuates with transmission
    distance but also experience certain diffraction losses due to variations in the
    terrain (Swain et al., 2021). However, at present, the site selection of farm
    IoT nodes relies mostly on experience, without comprehensive consideration of
    the terrain, signal losses, and other factors, resulting in unnecessary transmit
    power wastage. Therefore, designing a reasonable node location method is significant
    for extending the node''s battery life and reducing power consumption (Wang et
    al., 2018). Regarding the locations of the base stations, Zeng et al. (2017) proposed
    two optimization models to obtain the locations and number of base stations as
    well as proposed a joint optimization algorithm to solve the models. The results
    show that the models can effectively reduce the total transmit power and number
    of base stations. Valavanis et al. (2014) proposed an optimization method based
    on the genetic algorithm to solve the problem of nonuniform user distribution
    by optimizing the locations of base stations and minimizing network costs while
    satisfying coverage and capacity criteria. Liu et al. (2021) used the digital
    elevation model (DEM) database and triangulated irregular network (TIN) to divide
    the surface finely; combined with the basic transmission model in this environment
    for simulate, they found that blocking can easily affect wireless network communications
    in the area. The above studies planned the locations of the base stations on the
    premise of obtaining the terrains of the experimental scenes. Traditional terrain
    mapping relies mainly on radar scanning, satellite image analysis, and unmanned
    aerial vehicle (UAV) cruising, among others. However, traditional methods and
    instruments are expensive, and their accuracies of regional mapping are low; there
    are still no-fly zones for drones in many areas, and random flying may cause legal
    risks. In recent years, with the development of sensor technology, the accuracies
    of satellite positioning modules and inertial measurement unit (IMU) modules have
    improved continuously, and their volumes have become smaller. The rapid acquisition
    of terrain 3D point-cloud data has also become possible. Three-dimensional positioning
    is a key difficulty in obtaining terrain point-cloud data. To achieve the highest
    possible positioning accuracy, Gao et al. (2022) proposed an improved position
    estimation algorithm based on multisensor fusion autoencoder neural network using
    the extended Kalman filter (EKF) algorithm to fuse multisensor data, thereby improving
    the positioning accuracies in all three experimental scenarios. Li et al. (2020)
    developed a wavelet denoising algorithm based on empirical mode decomposition
    (EMD) to reduce the uncertainty noise of the IMU and proposed the interactive
    multimodel extended Kalman filter (IMM-EKF) algorithm to improve the robustness
    and accuracy of the EKF filter output. Hao et al. (2018) integrated the inertial
    navigation system (INS) and global positioning system (GPS) to propose an improved
    EKF algorithm based on a self-designed adaptive estimation method; this method
    appropriately adjusts the state process and statistics of the observation noise,
    such that the GPS/INS can maintain long-term stability with a lower error margin.
    After obtaining the point-cloud data, it is necessary to study an interpolation
    method to generate a surface description model, which provides a terrain basis
    for designing the objective function. Zhu et al. (2019) studied the influence
    of the number of points in the neighborhood of the DEM interpolation method on
    the mean slope, mean slope aspect, and root mean-squared error (RMSE) of slope,
    and aspect error of the interpolation DEM. Aspect errors are mainly concentrated
    in the ridges, valleys, and flat areas. Agüera-Vega et al. (2020) proposed a fast
    global interpolation method based on the thin-plate spline (TPS) using weighted
    finite differences to solve the problem of data loss in grid-based surface construction.
    Compared with discrete-cosine-transform-based TPS and locally weighted interpolation
    methods, the proposed method produces visually good surfaces that overcome the
    clipping, roughness, and discontinuity problems of conventional interpolators.
    Chen et al. (2018) proposed a least-squares compactly supported radial basis function
    interpolation method for digital terrain models (DTMs) in one private and ten
    public datasets. On-set tests found that simple interpolation methods (including
    inverse distance weighting, natural neighborhood, linear, and bicubic approaches)
    have surface roughness, clipping, discontinuities, and loss of subtle topographic
    features. In contrast, the proposed algorithm maintains good balance between noise
    removal and terrain feature preservation. After obtaining the surface model, the
    optimization objective function is designed according to the free-space and diffraction
    losses. However, the objective function is often non-smooth (i.e., first-order
    partial derivative does not exist). To solve the non-smooth, non-convex, and multiple
    minima of the base station layout objective function, Xie et al. (2016) introduced
    a reconstructed 3D terrain simulation system into the location optimization problem
    of the base station and used the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to
    solve the problem as a multiobjective mathematical model for the base station
    planning problem. Vilovic et al. (2007) proved that the PSO and ant colony algorithms
    can be used to solve the indoor location problem of wireless local area network
    (WLAN) base station, and their simulations showed that the PSO algorithm has better
    performance than the ant colony algorithm. Literature search shows that there
    is still a lack of research on the locations of agricultural IoT nodes. To fill
    this gap, the present work proposes an IoT node addressing method by combining
    the K-means clustering and PSO algorithms. This approach uses the K-means algorithm
    to determine the jurisdiction terminal and initial position of each router, establishes
    an appropriate fitness function according to the electromagnetic wave loss model,
    and uses the PSO algorithm to obtain the final positions of the routers and gateway.
    Further, a self-designed terrain fast sampling device combined with the EKF algorithm
    is used herein to obtain the fused point-cloud data of the experimental site;
    the nearest neighbor method is then used to interpolate the point-cloud data to
    obtain the 3D modeling map of the experimental site. Based on the 3D modeling
    diagram, the terminal coordinates are input to the algorithm to obtain the location
    results of routers; the RSSI returned by the ZigBee module is used to evaluate
    the merits of the location results. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study site The
    mango (Mangifera indica L.) plantation of the Guangdong Agricultural Technology
    Promotion Center was selected as the experimental site, and its top view is shown
    in Fig. 1. The area shown by the red line is the experimental area. This place
    is located at No. 28-30 South Kemulong Road, Tianhe District, Guangzhou City,
    Guangdong Province, China, whose coordinates are 23.182738° north latitude and

    was independently designed in combination with the EKF algorithm to obtain the
    3D point-cloud data of the experimental site. The sampler, whose structure is
    shown in Fig. 2, has a layered set-up with a control board and a base board. Download

    Construction of terrain sampler. The base board was connected to the control board
    through two 3710 ports. The communication chip (CH340B, WCH, China) was used to
    communicate with the computer via the Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface; the
    power management chip (FM5324G, FM, China) was used for battery charging, discharging,
    and voltage conversion; the RGB LED and buzzer was used to indicate the operating
    status and faults. The base board has reserved interfaces for an optical flow
    module, a laser rangefinder, a real-time kinematic (RTK) module, an IMU module,
    a ZigBee module, and a display screen. The RTK module is connected to the sampler
    through the SH1.0-4 pin cable, and the processor communicates with the optical
    flow, laser ranging, IMU, and ZigBee modules through the universal asynchronous
    receiver/transmitter (UART) interface. The SD memory card was used to read and
    write files through the FatFs file operating system integrated with the processor
    through the secure digital input/output multimedia card (SDMMC) interface, while
    using the flexible memory controller (FMC) interface to control the screen. The
    main control board adopted the microprocessor (STM32H743IIT6, ST, USA). This chip
    has a built-in 32-bit Arm® Cortex®-M7 core with double-precision FPU and L1 cache,
    frequency up to 480 MHz, 2M bytes of flash memory with read-while-write support
    and 1 MB of RAM, which enables real-time implementation of the EKF algorithm on
    the sampler. The main control board also has a synchronous dynamic random-access
    memory (SDRAM) chip (W9825G6KH, WINBOND, Taiwan, China) to extend the running
    memory of the microprocessor and a NAND-Flash (MT29F4G08, Micron, USA) to increase
    the code memory. The manufacturers and models of the main sensors are shown in

    fixed inside the plastic box, and the corresponding positions at the bottom of
    the plastic box were hollowed out, so that the optical flow sensor and the laser
    ranging module can be seen on the ground. 2.3. Sensor data conversion The data
    types and composite data returned by each sensor are shown in Fig. 3. The laser
    rangefinder returns the laser distance directly opposite the sampler. The optical
    flow module obtains the moving speed of the sampler in pixels/s, and the horizontal
    laser distance is calculated using Eq. (1): (1) Download : Download high-res image

    sensor data to measurement inputs. where is the laser distance (m); and are the
    pitch and roll angles (rad) of the sampler, respectively. In this work, the “North
    Sky Coordinate System” is adopted uniformly. This coordinate system considers
    the starting point of terrain sampling as the coordinate zero-point, due east
    and due north are the positive directions of the x-axis and y-axis, respectively,
    and the direction of horizontal height increase is the positive direction of the
    z-axis. The pressure-to-altitude conversion function of the sampler needs to be
    calibrated before use. The regression curve of air pressure intensity and horizontal
    height is obtained by linear fitting, and the air pressure height is converted
    according to this curve during terrain sampling. The RTK module returns the position
    information based on the WGS84 geodetic coordinate system. Referring to the Haversine
    equation (Gade, 2010), Eq. (2) is used to solve the distance from the current
    position to the sampling start point: (2) where is the average radius of the Earth,
    6371.393 km; and are the latitude and longitude of the starting sampling position,
    respectively, rad; and are the latitude and longitude of the current location,
    respectively, rad. After obtaining the distance, Eq. (3) is used to obtain the
    bearing angle : (3) where is obtained from the improvement of the arc tangent
    function, which is defined as: (4) After calculating the bearing angle, the coordinates
    ( ) of the current position of the “North Sky Coordinate System” are obtained
    by the following formula: (5) Using the induction formula of trigonometric functions,
    the above formula can be simplified as (6) The output of each sensor is processed
    correspondingly, and the observation value matrix of the EKF algorithm is synthesized
    for subsequent use. 3. Algorithm design 3.1. Zigbee brief Agricultural IoT in
    this work is implemented based on the Zigbee, which is a low-data-rate, low-power,
    and low-cost wireless network protocol for automation and remote-control applications
    (Ergen, 2004). The Zigbee network used here includes three nodes: terminal, router,
    and gateway. Its basic topology is shown in Fig. 4. The terminal is responsible
    for collecting environmental information, such as temperature, humidity, and controlling
    equipment such as solenoid valves. The router is the connection between the gateway
    and terminals, which is used to forward the downlink instructions from the gateway
    to the terminal and uplink information from the terminal to gateway. Each router
    is connected to multiple terminals nearby; the gateway node is responsible for
    uploading the data collected by the terminal to the background server through
    4G or other methods and for accepting control instructions from the server and
    conveying them to the terminal through router. There is only one gateway in a
    network. Download : Download high-res image (96KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. Topology of agricultural Internet of Things. For convenience of
    modeling, the following assumptions are made: (1) The terminal position is known.
    The terminal needs to control the opening and closing of the solenoid valve and
    collect agricultural information. Its installation position needs to be determined
    manually according to the actual site situation, such as locations of water pipes
    and crop distribution. (2) A terminal can only be connected to one router, and
    there are no connections between the terminals. It is necessary to determine the
    terminal responsible for each router, and the segmentation of the terminals can
    be regarded as a kind of clustering problem. (3) Once the cluster elements are
    determined, they do not change. After determining the terminals connected to the
    routers, irrespective of changes to the router locations, the subordinate terminals
    will not increase or decrease. (4) The goal of the model is to reduce the maximum
    transmission loss. The maximum communication loss refers to the maximum wireless
    transmission loss between the routers and multiple terminals or gateways and multiple
    routers. (5) There is only one gateway, and it can only communicate with the routers;
    each router must be connected to the gateway. 3.2. Wireless transmission loss
    model 3.2.1. Free-space loss When the electromagnetic wave propagates in free
    space without any obstacles, there will be free-space loss (Islam et al., 2009),
    and the recommended calculation formula of free-space loss is as follows: (7)
    where is the free-space loss (dB); is the frequency of electromagnetic waves in
    MHz; is the straight-line distance between the signal transmitting and receiving
    points in km. 3.2.2. Diffraction loss If the electromagnetic wave encounters a
    raised obstacle during transmission, diffraction loss will occur. According to
    the calculation method of the diffraction loss published by ITU (2019), there
    are two situations in the calculation of diffraction loss, such as illustrated
    in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6. Download : Download high-res image (57KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 5. Horizontal line is below the spike. Download : Download
    high-res image (35KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Horizontal line
    is above the tip. Eq. (8). is then used to calculate the combined quantity of
    geometric parameters . (8) where is the vertical distance between the horizontal
    line of the endpoint and top of the peak in m when the horizontal line of the
    endpoint is above the mountain (as shown in Fig. 6); h is a negative value and
    is otherwise (as shown in Fig. 5) a positive value; is the wavelength of the electromagnetic
    waves in m; and are the distances between the top of the obstacle and the ends
    of the path. After calculating , the diffraction loss is calculated as follows:
    (9) where is the diffraction loss; and are the real and imaginary parts of the
    complex Fresnel integral, respectively, calculated using Eq. (10): (10) where
    is the complex Fresnel integral results; is the natural constant; is the imaginary
    unit; is the integrand variable. For convenience of calculation, ITU recommends
    that when is greater than -0.78, the approximate value of diffraction loss can
    be obtained using Eq. (11). (11) 3.2.3. Objective function In this model, the
    calculation of the transmission loss mainly considers free-space and diffraction
    losses of the electromagnetic wave emitted by the node during propagation. The
    objective is to reduce the maximum wireless transmission loss between the router
    and each terminal or gateway and each router. The wireless transmission loss is
    reduced, so the design objective function is given as (12) where is the current
    maximum transmission loss of particle , and the location optimization algorithm
    needs to continuously reduce ; and are the diffraction and free-space losses between
    node p and terminal or gateway managing node p, respectively; is the set of nodes
    that belong to the -th router or gateway managed; is a positive linear transfer
    function: (13) Since the transmission loss is a non-negative value, when the distance
    between the transmitting and receiving points is small, the loss calculated according
    to Eq. (7) may be negative infinity. To ensure that the PSO algorithm performs
    normally, a positive linear transfer function is added to the free-space loss.
    There is more than one node , and the maximum transmission power of the router
    or gateway should be higher than the maximum transmission loss, so the max function
    is used to consider the maximum transmission loss as the fitness. 3.3. Finding
    optimal points using K-means and PSO algorithms In this study, one terminal in
    the ZigBee network only establishes communication with one router, and each router
    is responsible for forwarding the data of its associated terminal to the gateway,
    with the gateway only communicating with the routers and uploading the data collected
    by the terminal. A router divides the terminals it is responsible for docking,
    and the positions of the routers are optimized according to the wireless transmission
    loss. After determining the positions of the routers, the optimization algorithm
    is used to select the gateway position. The K-means algorithm (Macqueen, 1967)
    is an unsupervised clustering algorithm. For a given sample set, the samples can
    be divided into k clusters according to the distances between the samples. This
    algorithm is used to determine the initial positions of the routers. The distance
    between the seed and routers is the plane distance and is calculated as follows:
    (14) where is the distance of the seed (i.e., the terminal) from the router; ,
    are the x and y coordinates of the router; , are the x and y coordinates of the
    terminal. After determining the initial positions of the routers and their terminals,
    the PSO algorithm is used to optimize the positions. PSO (Eberhart et al., 2002)
    is a global optimization algorithm, which guides optimization through the swarm
    intelligence generated by cooperation and competition among the particles in the
    swarm. The algorithm can move the particles in the swarm to better areas according
    to the fitness of the environment so as to achieve the global optimal solution
    of the function. To speed up the convergence of the PSO algorithm, a variable
    inertia weight factor algorithm is used, which needs to be executed once after
    each iteration to obtain a new inertia weight factor. The pseudocode of the algorithm
    is as follows: ** The above algorithm uses the variable to record the number of
    times that the global optimal position is not updated. When is less than 2, the
    inertia weight factor is increased to improve the ability of the particles to
    search for the optimal point. When the global optimal position is not updated
    for more than 5 times, the inertia weight factor is reduced to accelerate algorithm
    convergence. The steps of the algorithm used herein are as follows: (1) Model
    the farm terrain to obtain a terrain description function; (2) Obtain the terminal
    coordinates according to the actual distribution of terminals; (3) Determine the
    number of routers; (4) Use the K-means clustering algorithm to group the terminals,
    and take the center of each group as the initial centers of the routers; (5) For
    each group of terminals, initialize several particles near the initial center
    of the group, obtain the objective function by Eq. (12), and use the PSO algorithm
    to determine the final positions of the routers; (6) Initialize several particles,
    obtain the fitness function through Eq. (12), and use the PSO algorithm to determine
    the final position of the gateway. 3.4. Fast terrain sampling Kalman filter is
    a set of mathematical equations that provides an efficient least-squares method
    for computing recursive solutions. However, the Kalman filter is only suitable
    for linear systems. To apply the Kalman filter to nonlinear objects, the extended
    Kalman filter is proposed, and the Taylor series expansion is used to linearize
    the nonlinear model (Fujii, 2013). The terrain sampler uses the EKF algorithm
    to fuse multisensor data, and its observation matrix is given as (15) where is
    the heading angle of the sampler, rad; is the time difference between two executions
    of the EKF algorithm, s; is the barometric altitude in m; , are the x-axis and
    y-axis displacements of the RTK module in m, respectively; , are the x-axis and
    y-axis velocities of the optical flow in m/s, respectively. The state matrix of
    the EKF algorithm is (16) where , , are the x, y, and z coordinate values of the
    current position of the sampler relative to the sampling start point in m, respectively.
    The state prediction matrix of the EKF algorithm is (17) where , are the speeds
    along the x-axis and y-axis in m/s, respectively, and calculated as (18) where
    , are the displacements of the y-axis and x-axis outputs by the last execution
    of the EKF algorithm in m. The Jacobian matrix of the EKF algorithm is obtained
    from the partial derivative of the state prediction matrix: (19) where (20) The
    execution flow of the EKF algorithm is shown in Fig. 7 and by the following formulas:

    matrix; is the process noise matrix; is the residual matrix; is the system uncertainty

    matrix of ; is the th output of the EKF algorithm. The EKF algorithm has been
    integrated with the main control chip of the sampler. The sampler automatically
    executes the EKF algorithm on the data returned by the sensors and saves the results
    and original data to the memory card in the form of CSV files. 3.5. Interpolation
    modeling Interpolation is the problem of approximating a function value of an
    ungiven point in a certain space when the function values of the surrounding points
    are given. The nearest neighbor algorithm selects the value of the nearest point
    without considering the values of the adjacent points, resulting in segmentation
    constant interpolation. Interpolation modeling uses the nearest neighbor interpolation
    method to interpolate point-cloud data. This method is a simple approach of interpolating
    multiple variables in one or more dimensions by selecting the value of the point
    nearest to the sought data point and not considering the values of other neighboring
    points, thus producing a segmented constant interpolated value for the sought
    data point. 4. Experimental results 4.1. Optimization algorithm simulation Referring
    to the peaks function of MATLAB (2020), the terrain description function used
    in the simulation is Where (22) where is the terrain height at coordinates (x,
    y) in m. The three-dimensional map of the terrain corresponding to the description
    function is shown in At present, most IoT nodes mainly work in the 2.4 GHz frequency
    band. According to the standard issued by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
    Engineers (IEEE), the frequency range of this frequency band is 2.401–2.495 GHz
    (IEEE, 2003). For convenience of calculation, the center frequency f (2.448GHz)
    of the above range is used for simulation. Using Eq. (23), it can be calculated
    that the wavelength is about 0.12 m. (23) where is the speed of light in vacuum,
    3×108 m/s. The other simulation parameters are shown in Table 2. Table 2. Optimization

    one of the following three conditions is met: (1) The number of migrations reaches
    the “maximum number of particle migrations”; (2) All particle migration distances
    are less than the “minimum tolerable migration distance of particles”; (3) The
    time that the optimal position of the group has not been updated exceeds the “optimal
    position tolerance time when particles do not update”. The PSO algorithm selects
    three groups of parameters (Pedersen, 2010) for testing, as shown in Table 3.

    1.3358 2 29 -0.4349 -0.6504 2.2073 3 20 0.1 1.49 1.49 Here, S is the number of
    particles; ω is the initial inertia coefficient; is the personal cognitive weight;
    is the social cognitive weight. To determine the final parameters used in the
    simulation of the PSO algorithm, a pre-experiment was carried out to test the
    time required for execution of the PSO algorithm for each group of parameters.
    Each group was tested 100 times, and the time required are shown in Fig. 9. Download

    test results of different parameter groups of the PSO algorithm The average time
    consumed by parameter group 3 compared to groups 1 and 2 was reduced by 51.51%
    and 53.72%, and the median was reduced by 53.72% and 50.57%, respectively. It
    is seen that the number of particles, inertia coefficient, and cognitive weight
    parameters have significant impacts on the execution time of the PSO algorithm.
    Although parameter group 3 has more outliers than groups 1 and 2, it is undeniable
    that parameter group 3 is obviously at least 50% faster than groups 1 and 2. The
    results of the optimization performance test are shown in Fig. 10, which is a
    plot of the average of the maximum radio transmission losses in the routers to
    their terminals and that of the gateway to all routers from the results of 100
    executions of the three parameter sets. Download : Download high-res image (113KB)

    groups. It is seen that in the optimization results of the three parameter groups,
    the average maximum transmission loss of the router is between 84.94 and 88.71
    and that of the gateway is between 91.21 and 91.48. In a given parameter group,
    although the relationship between the average maximum transmission loss of routers
    1 to 5 is different, the difference between the maximum and minimum values of
    the router within the group is only 3.44, which is only 3.88% compared to the
    maximum transmission loss of 88.71; therefore, there is a high degree of confidence
    that changes in the parameter group have no significant effects on the optimization
    results. The randomly initialized 500 terminals are divided into five classes
    using the k-means algorithm, and the results are shown in Fig. 11. Download :

    are represented by the same color, and it is seen that the classification results
    have obvious boundaries. Because the execution results of the k-means algorithm
    may vary owing to the different positions of the initial cluster center points,
    the algorithm was executed 10 times, and the iteration with the shortest sum of
    distances was used for the figure and subsequent analyses. Using the PSO algorithm,
    20 particles near the cluster center in Fig. 11 were initialized, and the algorithm
    was executed to optimize the router’s position. The optimization results are shown

    from the location optimization of the PSO algorithm that the maximum transmission
    losses of the five routers are reduced, and the maximum transmission loss reduction
    rate of router 5 is 30.65%, showing that the PSO algorithm can significantly improve
    the communication quality from router 5 to its terminal. Using the PSO algorithm
    to determine the gateway location, the point with the smallest sum of distance
    to the five routers is first found, and 20 particles are initialized near this
    point to execute the optimization algorithm, whose the results are shown in Fig.
    13 Location of the gateway. The maximum transmission losses of the gateway before
    and after optimization are 91.76 dB and 90.71 dB, respectively. The maximum transmission
    loss is reduced by 1.14% through optimization, indicating that the PSO algorithm
    significantly improves the communication quality from router 5 to its terminal.

    Fig. 13. Location of the gateway. 4.2. GA vs. PSO under different initialization
    methods Genetic algorithm (GA) is a method of searching for optimal solutions
    by simulating the natural evolution process (Holland, 1992). The algorithm converts
    the process of solving the problem into a process similar to the crossover and
    mutation of chromosomal genes in biological evolution through mathematical methods
    and computer simulation operations. In this section, the convergence time and
    performance of GA and the PSO algorithm with optimal parameters were compared
    under three different particle initialization methods. These three initialization
    methods are shown in Fig. 14. Figure A shows a square random initialization, where
    the initial positions of the points are uniformly distributed in a square near
    the center. Figures B and C show a circular random distribution, the difference
    is that B is generated randomly and C is generated from a normal distribution.
    Therefore, in Figure C, the closer to the center, the denser the points are. Download

    Schematic diagram of initialization method After executing the k-means algorithm,
    the simulation considered the center of the cluster point as the particle initialization
    center, and used the three initialization methods to generate the particle position.
    Performing 100 times of PSO and GA, respectively, the results are shown in Fig.
    15 and Fig. 16, where a, b, and c in the x-axis title represent square random
    initialization, circular random initialization, and circular normal distribution
    initialization, respectively. Download : Download high-res image (70KB) Download

    image Fig. 16. The influence of different initialization methods on optimization
    results Simulation results show that the average and median time-consuming of
    GA under the three initialization methods are higher than those of the PSO algorithm.
    Interestingly, for the PSO algorithm, the initialization method b reduces the
    convergence time of a and c by 16.6% and 8.4%, respectively. But for GA, the initialization
    method a is reduced by 39.7% and 42.5% compared with b and c, respectively, which
    shows that different optimization algorithms should choose the appropriate initialization
    method according to the specific situation. In addition, compared with the GA
    algorithm, it was found that the execution time of PSO is 34.2%, 66.9% and 65.5%
    faster than that of GA under the three initialization methods, respectively. The
    performance simulation found that different initialization methods had no significant
    effect on the performance of the optimization results, as the sums of mean maximum
    transmission loss was between 520.864dB and 530.948dB, with a difference of less
    than 1.9%. Therefore, this study used the PSO algorithm and initialized the particles
    with the circular random initialization method. 4.3. Instrument calibration and
    terrain acquisition The sampler was used in the barometric calibration mode, and
    the height of the sampler was slowly increased. During this process, the sampler
    automatically collected the laser height and barometric pressure values, and when
    the laser height exceeded 1 m, the sampler ended the data collection and automatically
    performed a linear regression operation on the height and barometric pressure
    values to obtain a fitted straight line, which was then used as the basis for
    the pressure-to-altitude conversion in subsequent terrain sampling work. After
    calibration, the coordinates (23.183029°N, 113.399681°E) were considered as the
    starting point of terrain sampling, that is, the zero point of the “North Sky
    Coordinate System”. The experimenter held a terrain sampler and walked through
    the experimental site in as much as detail possible. The sampler automatically
    collected terrain data at certain intervals and exported the point-cloud data
    after the experiment. 4.4. Interpolation modeling The nearest neighbor interpolation
    algorithm was performed on the point-cloud data, and the modelling results are
    shown in Fig. 17, where the blue points are the terrain point-cloud data and the
    surfaces are the result of the interpolation modeling of the experimental site,
    with the colors of the surfaces indicating the heights of the terrain at the corresponding
    locations. Download : Download high-res image (339KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 17. Terrain sampling points and terrain modeling results. To compare
    the influence of the interpolation algorithm on the terrain model, the same point-cloud
    data were interpolated using bilinear, bicubic, biharmonic, and TPS interpolations.
    These results are shown in Fig. 18. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 18. Comparison of other interpolation methods.
    The effect evaluation parameters of the various interpolation methods are shown
    in Table 5. It is seen that compared with the nearest neighbor interpolation,
    the bilinear, bicubic, bitonal, and TPS interpolations have different degrees
    of edge disappearance. From the distribution of point-cloud data, the terrain
    layer ladder of the experimental site distribution is clearly observed, and only
    the nearest interpolation preserves the step-like terrain that matches the actual
    situation. In terms of terrain fitting, the distortions of the biharmonic and
    TPS interpolations are relatively serious, and the biharmonic interpolation even
    shows peaks at x=0 that do not actually exist. Table 5. Interpolation effect evaluation
    Interpolation Method Time Consumed (s) SSE R-square Nearest neighbor 0.176525
    0.336971 0.999995 Bilinear 0.118202 0.240661 0.999996 Bicubic 0.141461 0.580164
    0.999991 Biharmonic 1.997160 0.411028 0.999993 TPS 66.904709 878.627344 0.985728
    From the perspective of time consumed, the TPS algorithm is significantly higher
    than that of other interpolation algorithms because it needs to traverse all data
    samples and calculate the distortion energy loss in each iteration. The time overheads
    for the nearest neighbor, bilinear, and bicubic interpolations are only 8.84%,
    5.92%, and 7.08% of that for bimodal interpolation. Based on the sum of squares
    due to error (SSE), the SSE of TPS interpolation is 878, which is much higher
    than those of the other four interpolations, indicating the large interpolation
    error and that it is difficult to truly reflect the surface height distribution
    of the experimental site. The SSEs of the other four interpolation methods are
    relatively low. The coefficients of determination of the five interpolation methods
    are all higher than 0.98 and those of the four interpolation methods except TPS
    interpolation even reach 0.99999, which is very close to 1. This shows that the
    models generated by the five interpolation methods have good fitting effects in
    theory. However, from the 3D model obtained by actual interpolation, only the
    nearest neighbor interpolation fits the step edges. Therefore, under the conditions
    in this study, the fitting effects cannot be evaluated based on the coefficient
    of determination. In summary, this work uses the nearest neighbor interpolation
    as the point-cloud data interpolation algorithm because the fitting results truly
    reflect the changes in the terrain, and its time overhead is small, with high
    interpolation efficiency. 4.5. Router location planning and RSSI testing Owing
    to the limitations of the actual situation, five terminals and one router were
    used in the field verifications. The terminals were pre-arranged in the experimental
    site. The coordinate of the router was calculated by the algorithm presented herein
    according to the terrain model, terminal coordinates, and wireless transmission
    loss. The coordinates of the terminals and recommended position for the router
    are shown in Table 6 using the North Sky Coordinate System, with a zero-point
    corresponding to (23.183029°N, 113.399681°E) in WGS84 coordinates. Table 6. Coordinates

    sampling interpolation were used to prepare a contour map, with the terminal locations
    and recommended location of the router as shown in Fig. 19 (a). Download : Download

    and experimental results The RSSI test used the TI®-CC2530 chip as the signal
    transceiver and CC2591 chip as the signal power amplifier, and the communication
    quality was judged through the RSSI returned when the CC2530 chip received data
    packets. The larger the RSSI value, the better is the communication quality. In
    the field test, the RSSI was sent to the abovementioned self-made terrain sampler
    to obtain the signal strength at the corresponding coordinate position. The experimenter
    held a sampler at and near the optimal points of the router recommended by the
    algorithm; the sampler as a router automatically recorded the RSSIs of the five
    terminals at certain intervals, where the optimum point and its southeast-northwest
    2 m sampling results are shown in Table 7. It is seen that the minimum value of
    the RSSI from the optimum point to the five terminals are larger than the points
    in its vicinity, and the minimum RSSI of the optimum point compared to the points
    in its vicinity improved by 9-13%. Table 7. RSSI data of some measurement points
    Terminal Optimum point East South West North 1 -78 -86 -78 -85 -78 2 -76 -82 -83

    -78 -86 -88 -90 -88 For the sampling points at the same positions as the measured
    results, the minimum RSSI value among the five terminals was used to obtain the
    point-cloud data varying with position; nearest neighbor interpolation was then
    performed on the above data to obtain the minimum RSSI measurement result, as
    shown in Fig. 19 (b). The location of the red dot in the figure is the optimal
    point obtained by the optimization algorithm, which is the location of the router''s
    fitting result. It is seen that the router location chosen by the algorithm is
    at the maximum point of the RSSI measurement. As seen from the figure, there is
    a large difference in the RSSI values bordering the color block, with no transition
    zones in between, and the minimum RSSI difference is as high as 18 between two
    sample points that are less than one meter apart, thus indicating the seriousness
    of the fast-fading phenomenon of wireless transmission in the plantation and illustrating
    the importance of the planning algorithm for improving the quality of wireless
    transmission. In addition, it is seen that the RSSI is irregularly distributed
    and discontinuous everywhere, so the partial derivative does not exist, and the
    traditional gradient descent algorithm cannot be used to solve for the objective
    function of this work. 5. Discussion In this study, the PSO algorithm demonstrated
    good performance for optimizing the non-smooth objective function. It was found
    that the time cost of the PSO algorithm was very sensitive to changes in the parameters,
    but the optimization results are less susceptible to changes in the parameter
    groups. For the selection of the PSO parameters, El-Gallad et al. (2002) believed
    that for very small particle numbers, the particles of the PSO algorithm are likely
    to be trapped in a local optimum. On the contrary, for a larger number of particles,
    the performance of the PSO algorithm would be better, but the convergence speed
    and computation time become slower and take up more memory, so the number of particles
    should be chosen reasonably according to the configuration of the instrument used
    to perform the PSO algorithm. He et al. (2016) argued that the inertia coefficient
    ω can change the global and local searchability of the PSO; if ω is not zero,
    the particles have the tendency to explore new spaces, and the larger the value
    of ω, the wider is the exploration space of the particle, and vice versa; it is
    therefore beneficial to search for the local optimum. This study used a variable
    inertia coefficient such that when the global optimum point changed, the PSO still
    had a large optimization space; at this time, increasing the inertia coefficient
    can increase the global search ability. On the contrary, when the global optimum
    was no longer updated, lowering the inertia coefficient could speed up the convergence
    of the algorithm and exploration ability of the local optimum. For setting the
    personal cognitive weight and social cognitive weight of the PSO algorithm, the
    current research has been limited by application to some problems, and there is
    no general selection method; when is 0, the particles only have social ability,
    and the algorithm is able to search new regions through collaborations between
    the particles, which converges faster than the standard algorithm but is more
    likely to fall into a local optimum; if = 0, there is no communication between
    the particles, thus reducing the probability of obtaining an optimal solution.
    Therefore, the choice of parameters for the PSO algorithm is very important, and
    further research should consider specific problems to obtain better optimization
    results. The nearest neighbor interpolation algorithm is mainly used in the field
    of image processing and single building modeling. In this work, this algorithm
    is innovatively used for point-cloud data interpolation, and compared with the
    other four commonly used algorithms, it is found that for terrains with highly
    discontinuous stepped edges, only the model obtained by the nearest neighbor interpolation
    algorithm can be a good fit. The other interpolation algorithms have more or less
    edge loss problems. In addition, this study also found that for terrain interpolation,
    the coefficient of determination of the model cannot reflect the fitting ability
    of the model well. The coefficient of determination of the biharmonic interpolation
    in this work is as high as 0.999993, but the fitting result shows a “mountain
    peak” that does not actually exist. Therefore, the performance analysis of the
    interpolation algorithm should not only consider evaluation data such as SSE and
    R2, but also rely on visual inspection and cross-validation. (Habib, 2021) The
    RSSI experimental results show that there is a serious fast fading phenomenon
    in the experimental site, which may be caused by the density of trees on the site,
    but the PSO algorithm can still find the position with the smallest RSSI, indicating
    that the objective function and optimization algorithm proposed here are strong
    references for node siting in similar scenarios. A relatively simple calculation
    method of the diffraction loss was used in this study. Rahim et al. (2015) studied
    established wireless transmission models and found that the Weissberger model
    provided the lowest fading estimates, the FITU-R model provided the highest fading
    estimates, and the ITU-R model had the highest rate of increase in leaf fading.
    Shamsan et al. (2020) proposed a new model to study the effects of precipitation
    and diffraction on wireless point-to-point communication systems; their results
    show that in the case of low rain intensity, the main attenuation factor is the
    loss caused by free-space propagation, followed by rain attenuation, and then
    diffraction loss; however, in the case of high rainfall rate, the rain attenuation
    becomes the main factor, followed by free-space loss and finally diffraction loss.
    Shamsan (2019) studied the diffraction mechanisms of sandstorm and wireless link
    communication and found that the attenuation loss caused by diffraction was inversely
    proportional to the distance between the signal transmitter and receiver, especially
    when the transmitter or receiver was closer to the diffracting object; in addition,
    higher signal frequencies resulted in higher diffraction, sandstorm, and free-space
    losses. Therefore, when using the algorithm proposed here in other scenarios,
    an appropriate wireless transmission loss model should be selected according to
    the climate, crop type, and other factors related to the scenario. 6. Conclusion
    In this study, a rapid terrain sampling method was presented for site selection
    of IoT nodes. The experimental results showed that the proposed method could effectively
    reduce the wireless transmission loss and improve the communication quality of
    IoT nodes, which was consistent with the simulation results. The differences in
    parameters had little effects on the optimization results of the algorithm, but
    had a great influence on the execution time. Thus, a future study will focus on
    the parameter’s selection of PSO algorithm to improve the performance. It was
    also found that using different particle initialization methods for PSO and GA
    resulted in significant changes in convergence time. In this work, using different
    initialization methods for GA and PSO can vary the time consumption by up to 42.5%
    and 16.6% respectively. In addition, different optimization algorithms performed
    inconsistently in terms of convergence time for the same particle generation method,
    so a suitable initialization method should be further investigated according to
    different algorithms. It should be noted that the minimum RSSI difference between
    two sample points that were less than one meter apart could be as high as 18,
    indicating that the fast fading of wireless transmissions in the plantation was
    serious and illustrating the importance of the planning algorithm to improve the
    quality of wireless transmissions. In light of this, a future study will also
    focus on finding a precise way to evaluate the wireless transmission loss. CRediT

- analysis: The paper presents the development and evaluation of a LoRa network for
    monitoring climatic parameters in the agricultural sector in the Andean region
    of Ecuador. The system consists of two transmitter nodes, one receiver node/gateway,
    and an IoT server. A graphical user interface (GUI) was developed on Thinger.io
    platform for crop monitoring and remote actuator control. The network was deployed
    in an area of 50 hectares, with a range distance of 875 m to the farthest point.
    The performance of the network was evaluated for different spreading factors (SF),
    coding rates (CR), and bandwidth (BW). The results showed that the network achieved
    a packet delivery ratio (PDR) of at least 76% for uplinks and 92% for downlinks,
    with an average received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of -122 dBm in areas
    with irregular orography. The authors conclude that the LoRa network can be used
    to monitor climatic parameters in the agricultural sector in mountainous areas,
    reducing the technological gap and allowing farmers to make timely decisions to
    mitigate adverse weather events and improve crop production.

    directly affects people’s behavior. Humans have adapted themselves to the use
    of the Internet, computer systems, smartphones and sensors, among other devices
    to carry out different daily activities. In the same way, different types of applications
    have been developed to meet our needs, allowing problem solving in many areas
    of interest. One of the main areas that has benefited from technology is the agricultural
    sector. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
    (FAO), the world should produce 70% more food in 2050 than what it produced in
    2006 to feed the growing population around the world [1]. The Agricultural sector
    is turning to the IoT for analysis, management and the search for greater production
    capacities as the demands for the products and its operation increase. The growth
    of communication technologies and sensors for agriculture, their easy usage and
    operation, as well as their low production cost, allow different parameters such
    as humidity, temperature and soil acidity to be measured in different places [2].
    They can even be used in regions of difficult access, such as mountainous areas,
    slopes and deserts, and other possible places where agriculture can be developed.
    In this regard, the use of these technologies allows farmers to analyze the data
    collected by the sensors, predict future climatic conditions and, therefore, improve
    productivity, minimize expenses and preserve the resources used. 1.2. Problem
    Definition and Contribution In Ecuador, the use of intelligent sensors at the
    agricultural level is very limited. Currently, there are sensors that are used
    for census, monitoring and control of multiple variables [3]. The use of these
    wireless sensors allows for efficient energy management. They are scalable. New
    sensors can be incorporated without affecting performance, achieving the implementation
    of dynamic network topologies [4]. The contribution of this work is to reduce
    the technological gap in rural communities in Ecuador, which do not have many
    economic resources, and with this network, farmers will be able to control production
    and pests, based on the climatic changes present in the area. For the coverage
    area where the network is implemented, the applied system offers scalability,
    security, management and an affordable cost for the community, whose economic
    income depends mostly on agricultural activities. In this context, the system
    will serve as a basis for the implementation of techniques such as phytosanitary
    control, intelligent irrigation, and production forecasting among others. 2. Related
    Works Extensive research was conducted on the LoRa network and communication technologies.
    Foremost, it is identified that Low-Power Wide-Area (LPWAN) technologies have
    become popular worldwide [5]; such as LTE-M [6], SigFox, Narrow Band (NB)-IoT
    [7] and long-range LoRa [8]. The latter two being the ones that dominate wireless
    communications. Comparing these two technologies, it was identified that LoRa
    has advantages in terms of battery life, its capacity and cost; while NB-IoT offers
    benefits in terms of service quality (QoS), latency, reliability and range [9,10].
    It was also pointed out that despite the extensive research that has been conducted
    so far on existing LPWAN technologies, there are still challenges to be addressed
    that can be of great assistance to the scientific and academic community. Regarding
    the use of LoRa in agriculture, [11] proposes the development of a mobile gateway
    device with low-power wide-area networks (LoRaWAN), used to increase the productivity
    and efficiency of greenhouses. The results showed that this approach helps current
    agricultural processes, due to the low cost and accuracy of humidity and temperature
    measurements. On the other hand, in [12], a system was developed to transmit uninterrupted
    images taken from a camera in a static environment through LoRa, the purpose of
    which was to reduce the amount of data transmitted while maintaining the quality
    of the image and service. Research on agricultural monitoring with LoRa networks
    was also conducted. In [13], a soil environment monitoring system based on a radio
    frequency identification (RFID) sensor and LoRa is presented to conduct long-term
    and low-cost monitoring. In addition, in [14], a long-range, low-power IoT network
    was recommended to monitor soil moisture; using LoRa as the communication interface,
    which uses the 868 MHz ISM band for signal transmission. On the other hand, a
    model called AgriPrediction [15] was presented, which combines a short and medium-range
    wireless network system with a prediction engine to proactively predict changes
    in crops, thus notifying the farmer of corrective actions. Finally, studies on
    the state-of-the-art and the current situation in agriculture, IoT and the LoRa
    network [16,17,18] were reviewed. These studies represent a great starting point
    to arrive at intelligent agriculture. Other studies referring to the use of IoT
    in agriculture were identified in [19]. They developed an object detection model
    for the monitoring and control of weeds in grasslands in the state of California.
    After a series of tests, the model showed an average of 94% accuracy in image
    detection, which is better than other models identified in the literature. On
    the other hand, in [20], a software framework based on a fuzzy logic system for
    the evaluation and cleaning of pastures is proposed to be designed. Via this framework,
    it is possible to measure the density of weeds and empty spots through images
    and score the state of pasture productivity. In addition, it is possible to produce
    2D weed density maps, which provide a better view of the pastures. Finally, this
    field of study identified a Microservices software framework to implement automatic
    functions in the IoT–Fog–Cloud ecosystem, which will enable the development of
    intelligent decision-making systems based on the IoT context [21]. Another important
    field is the IoT/sensor networks operational optimization. The design, implementation
    and evaluation of an algo-handover rhythm for wireless sensor networks (WSN) are
    presented where different tests were performed, and it was identified that the
    proposed design can reduce the energy consumption by several orders of magnitude
    compared to existing handover algorithms for WSNs [22]. In this same field of
    study in [23], an Energy Efficient and Fault-Tolerant Hierarchical Clustering
    Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) is proposed, which the authors named
    (FEHCA). The simulation results are encouraging as they enable better decision
    making on sensing data. As described in previous paragraphs, this research presents
    the development of a LoRa network architecture, which allows monitoring variables
    inherent to agricultural processes such as: ambient temperature, relative humidity,
    soil moisture and ultraviolet radiation in mountainous areas of the Andean region
    of Ecuador. This will enable farmers to make timely decisions regarding agricultural
    activities to improve production and reduce losses due to adverse climatic effects.
    3. LoRa Overview LoRa is a LoRaWAN physical layer technology, licensed free in
    ISM bands, characterized by low bandwidth and a limited number of messages [24,25].
    It uses Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) modulation that allows long-range and low-power
    consumption [26]. In LoRa communication, some parameters can be customized, such
    as the spreading factor (SF), the coding rate (CR) and the bandwidth (BW). The
    values of each parameter depend on the region where the LoRa devices are installed.
    In Europe, it uses bands of 868 MHz, 915 MHz in North America and 433 MHz in Asia
    [25,27]. Nevertheless, the SF can vary between 7 and 12. The higher it is, the
    higher the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the sensitivity, the coverage range, the
    symbol time (Ts) [28] and the time on air (ToA); that is, the packet transmission
    time. LoRa modulation can transmit arbitrary frames using two types of packet
    formats, explicit and implicit. Generally, the packet structure consists of four
    elements: preamble, header (optional), data payload (limited to 255 bytes) and
    an optional payload CRC [27,29]. The format is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. LoRa
    package format. A typical LoRa network operates with a bandwidth of 125 kHz, 250
    kHz or 500 kHz [30]. The increase in bandwidth allows for higher transmission
    speed, but it becomes more susceptible to errors [31]. In Equation (1), the symbol
    time ( 𝑇 𝑠 ) is linked to the bandwidth and the spreading factor (SF). 𝑇 𝑠 = 2
    𝑆𝐹 𝐵𝑊 (1) LoRa includes a forward error correcting code. The code rate (CR) is
    given by 𝐶𝑅= 4 4+𝑛 , with 𝑛∈{1,2,3,4} . Taking into account that the bits of information
    are transmitted by symbol. The useful bit modulation rate 𝑅 𝑏 [32], is defined
    by Equation (2): 𝑅 𝑏 =𝑆𝐹×( 𝐵𝑊 2 𝑆𝐹 )×( 4 4+𝑛 ) (2) To calculate the time on air
    for the transmission of a LoRa packet [27,28,29], Equation (3) is presented: 𝑇𝑜𝐴=
    2 𝑆 𝐹 𝐵𝑊 (𝑁𝑃+4.25+𝑆𝑊+𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝐻,0)) (3) 𝐻=[ 8𝑃𝐿−4𝑆𝐹+28+16𝐶𝑅𝐶−20𝐼𝐻 4(𝑆𝐹−2𝐷𝐸) ](𝑛+4)
    where 𝑛 is the value of the parameter belonging to CR = 4/(4 + n).  𝑁𝑃 is the
    Number of programmable symbols of the preamble. 𝑆𝑊 is the length of the sync word.
    𝑃𝐿 is the number of PHY useful payload bytes. CRC is CRC presence (1 = yes; 0
    = no). IH is the presence of the PHY header (1 = no; 0 = yes) and DE is the use
    of data rate optimization (1 = enabled; 0 = disabled). The received signal strength
    indicator (RSSI) is an important measurement parameter that reflects the quality
    of LoRa links [28]. With the noise factor (NF) of the receiver and the transmitted
    power P_TX, it is possible to estimate the SNR of the measured RSSI values, according
    to [28,32]: 𝑆𝑁𝑅=𝑅𝑆𝑆𝐼+174−10(𝐵𝑊)−𝑁𝐹 (4) where 𝑁𝐹 = 6 dB, which is the noise and
    RSSI is the receiver sensitivity −137 dBm [27], BW = 125 Khz, SF = 12 and where
    𝑅 𝑏 = 293 bps. 4. Proposal Development This section explains the design of the
    LoRa System used for monitoring agricultural fields in the Andean region of Ecuador.
    The implementation of a LoRa network without using LoRaWAN is sufficient for the
    case study; since the network of nodes communicating through the gateway is minimal,
    this is low power monitoring [33]. Furthermore, LoRa represents the physical layer
    within a LoRaWAN network. For the coverage area, the applied system offers scalability,
    security, management and an affordable cost for the community population whose
    economic income depends solely on agricultural activities. In this context, the
    system will serve as a basis for the implementation of techniques such as phytosanitary
    control, intelligent irrigation, and production forecasting among others. The
    main elements are described in Table 1. Table 1. Hardware and Software Components.
    4.1. System Architecture The Internet of Things (IoT) design based on LoRa communications
    is composed of different levels and elements. In Figure 2, the general architecture
    of the LoRa network system is presented, composed of end nodes, a gateway and
    an IoT server. Nodes 1 and 2 collect information from the agricultural fields
    by means of sensors, while node 3 is arranged for the activation of an actuator.
    The gateway is in charge of receiving and forwarding the information of the climatic
    variables coming from the final nodes to the IoT server to be visualized in a
    user interface that also controls the activation of a device through node 3. Therefore,
    in order to have a long-distance data transfer capability, the standard LoRa protocol
    is utilized. Figure 2. General architecture of the LoRa network system. 4.2. System
    Description In most cases in the Andean region of Ecuador, agricultural fields
    are not supervised, making it difficult to ensure adequate control of adverse
    weather conditions to improve crop production. In addition, the geographic areas
    dedicated to the cultivation of agricultural products are often difficult to access
    with a rocky orography and a deficit of communication infrastructure [34]. Therefore,
    the need to provide a monitoring and tracking system for LoRa crops is a priority
    and crucial not only for sustainable agriculture, but also for the protection
    of the micro-economies and food livelihoods of indigenous communities through
    controlled supervision. Therefore, a new contribution is made by introducing other
    prototype devices designed and created under experimental testing. The design
    and fabrication of the final nodes together with the gateway are explained in
    detail below, and the configuration of the user interface is illustrated. 4.3.
    Final Nodes The final nodes were custom designed with adaptability criteria capable
    of operating autonomously to facilitate deployment on agricultural fields and
    enable monitoring and control with LoRa wireless communication technology in the
    Andean region of Ecuador. The electronic processor of the final nodes was a TTGO
    LoRa32-OLED V1 module that integrates an ESP32 microcontroller, a 0.96-inch OLED
    display and a LoRa module based on the SEMTECH SX1276 chip with a frequency of
    868–915 MHz and a high transmission range that is very reliable [35]. Additionally,
    it can be programmed by Arduino IDE with some preinstalled libraries OLED, LoRa,
    etc. Figure 3a shows the electronic diagram of the transmitter node 1. For supplying
    electrical power to node 1, a rechargeable 2 Cell 1300 mAh LiPo TURNIGY battery
    at 7.4 V, a DC-DC LM2596 module configured to supply 5 V to the MCU, to the DHT21
    sensors measuring temperature, relative humidity and to the capacitive soil moisture
    sensor HW390 were available. Figure 3. (a) Electronic schematic and (b) manufacture
    of transmitter node 1. For the synergy of the electronic components, a PCB board
    was designed, which is also protected by a customized IP65 internal protection
    grade housing 3D printed with PLA thermoplastic as shown in Figure 3b. Figure
    4a shows the electronic diagram of the transmitter node 2; while Figure 4b shows
    the manufactured device. Unlike node 1; node 2 switches to the 3 Cell 1000 mAh
    LiPo TURNIGY battery at 11.1 V, which has an ML8511 analog sensor for UV radiation
    measurement under 5 V operation. Figure 4. (a) Electronic schematic and (b) manufacturing
    of transmitter node 2. Receiver node 3, performs the function of receiving information
    from the gateway via LoRa wireless communication to control an actuator. Node
    3, unlike the preceding nodes, reforms to a rechargeable 3 Cell 11.1 V 1000 mAh
    LiPo TURNIGY 3 Cell battery and a relay module with a controller interface for
    connecting AC (alternating current) powered equipment/machines, such as a water
    pump. The structure is similar to Figure 4. 4.4. Gateway The function of the gateway
    is to forward and receive the information arriving from the end nodes via LoRa
    wireless communication to the IoT server using standard IP internet protocol [36].
    Figure 5a illustrates the electronic design of the gateway that has an ESP32 microcontroller
    as the central coordinator module; it is an IoT device with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
    support integrated on a single development board. In the present prototype, an
    ESP32 DEVKIT MCU was used, which has an on-board USB serial converter and a micro-USB
    port for power supply, integrated 4 MB flash memory, GPIOs with PWM function,
    I2C, SPI, AD/DA converters, among other functions [37]. The ESP32 DEVKIT MCU allows
    sending and receiving information via the integrated Wi-Fi chip to and from the
    user interface over the IP network. For communication with the end nodes, the
    Heltec Wi-Fi LoRa 32(V2) module was used, which has the integrated SEMTECH SX1276
    LoRa chip and the ESP32 programmable microcontroller and incorporates a 0.96-inch
    OLED display. The chip operates at a frequency of 902–928 MHz with a receive sensitivity
    of −127 dBm, an omnidirectional UHF antenna and a gain of 2 dBi [18]. With the
    Heltec Wi-Fi LoRa 32(V2) modules, 2 independent LoRa wireless channels were created,
    one for transmitting and one for receiving data. The synchronous information flow
    between the ESP32 DEVKIT microcontroller and the Heltec Wi-Fi LoRa 32(V2) MCUs
    was achieved with I2C digital communication, generating a functional gateway for
    LoRa Full Duplex communications. Power supply took place with the HP 120VAC charger
    at 1.6 A/60 Hz, the DC 18.5 V/3.5 A output, and a DC-DC LM2596 module configured
    to provide 5 V to the gateway MCUs. Figure 5. (a) Electronic schematic and (b)
    gateway manufacturing. A PCB board was designed for the synergy of the electronic
    components that are protected against external IP65 weather conditions with a
    custom-made housing printed with 3D PLA thermoplastic as presented in Figure 5b.
    4.5. Server Communication It is in charge of receiving and processing the data
    packets coming from the end nodes and administering and managing the configuration
    required by the network. The data are acquired by the server API; i.e., Thinger.io
    so that users can control the environment of their field in order to use the data
    log and have an action based on field monitoring [38]. 4.6. User Application The
    user interface allows data to be visualized on an IoT platform [39], through the
    deployment of sensor nodes. Data from agricultural fields can be collected and
    transmitted to control actuators. Additionally, from the user application, proper
    monitoring and management of agricultural production are performed [40]. A graphical
    user interface was designed using the IoT platform Thinger.io as shown in Figure
    6. The user interface allows farmers to obtain crop data and information and take
    control of the actuators [36]. In the interface, the value of temperature, relative
    humidity, soil moisture, UV radiation and battery level of the transmitter nodes
    can be displayed. In addition, an actuator such as a water pump can be controlled.
    Figure 6. User Interface. 5. Testing and Experimental Configuration To evaluate
    the performance of the proposed LoRa network, it was implemented and deployed
    in a rural area of the Andean region of Ecuador. In this Section, the deployment
    site and the metrics that characterize the connectivity between LoRa devices are
    analyzed. 5.1. Test Area The environment used to evaluate the coverage of the
    LoRa network was in the rural community of Chirinche Bajo, Salcedo, Ecuador. The
    geographic location of the gateway and end nodes were deployed in an area of 50
    hectares, as illustrated in Figure 7. Figure 7. Spatial distribution of nodes
    and gateway on the digital surface elevation model, Chirinche Bajo community,
    Salcedo, Ecuador. As is characteristic of the Andean zones, the Chirinche Bajo
    community has different environmental particularities such as agricultural areas
    with altitudes ranging from 2910 to 3040 m above sea level, slopes of 0.3% to
    15%, terrain with a hard orography, irregularities in the soil and lush Eucalyptus
    trees in the community boundaries. Most of the people in the community are dedicated
    to farming potatoes, corn, onions, pasture, and caring for domestic animals such
    as cattle, pigs and poultry. To plan the deployment, it is important to obtain
    some insights into the communication range [41]. The satellite map in Figure 8
    illustrates the position of the gateway and end nodes distinguished by blue and
    red points, respectively. Table 2 shows the approximate straight-line distance
    of the different positions from the gateway. Figure 8. Longitudinal cross-sectional
    profile of link Nodes—Gateway. Table 2. Node positions and distance (approximate
    in a straight line) from the gateway. 5.2. Communication between Nodes and Station
    The end nodes were located in the agricultural fields of the Chirinche Bajo community,
    while the gateway was located in an inhabitant’s house from where it was linked
    to the Internet through a wireless Wi-Fi connection. Three autonomous networked
    end nodes were considered for the experimental test. Nodes 1 and 2, working at
    a frequency of 915 MHz for uplinks, while node 3 at 904 MHz for downlinks, were
    placed on poles 1 m above the ground, as illustrated in Figure 9a. Eight different
    locations were chosen based on the spatial distribution in agricultural fields
    and topography, in order to cover all possibilities and different types of environments,
    short and long distance, Line-of-Sight (LoS) and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS), the
    latter being affected by obstructions resulting from houses, trees, crops and
    slopes, as can be seen in Figure 8. Figure 9. (a) Flowchart of the optimized gateway
    algorithm and (b) Flowchart of the optimized end-node algorithm. The LoRa gateway
    has 2 channels at frequencies of 915 MHz and 904 MHz for uplink and downlink by
    full-duplex communication. The gateway was placed on the roof of a house (1°04′58.8″
    S 78°38′54.4″ W) at 4 m from the ground with the antennas placed vertically (normally
    a base station of this type is placed higher to achieve better coverage). In addition,
    the choice of the gateway location is based on two reasons. First, electrical
    power. As the gateway communicates with both the end nodes and the Internet, the
    power consumption is higher. Thus, a direct connection to the power outlet would
    avoid supply problems. Second, the connection to the Internet [42]. The gateway
    can be connected via Wi-Fi directly to the switch located in the house. Thus,
    communication with the IoT platform Thinger.io is ensured. 5.3. Experimental Configuration
    Radio planning, which evaluates the performance of the LoRa network operating
    at 915 MHz and 904 MHz, is presented. Based on the number of LoRa parameters that
    can be configured, a configuration notation is defined for the experimental tests:
    frequency (Fr), bandwidth (BW), spreading factor (SF) and coding rate (CR). Nodes
    1 and 2 transmit information of environmental conditions (temperature, humidity
    and UV radiation) to the gateway at 2000 ms intervals. The data received by the
    gateway were stored on a PC. Node 3 receives the payload packets from the gateway
    and these were sent via Bluetooth to a mobile application for storage. The study
    focuses on nodes sending/receiving packets with a payload length of 16 bytes,
    8 bytes and 4 bytes. The link checks at each location were performed by configuring
    the end node and the gateway with identical transmit/receive parameters going
    through various combinations for three values of spreading factor SF (7, 9 and
    12), keeping a constant value in the coding rate CR (4/5) and 125 kHz in the bandwidth
    parameter (BW). The isotropic transmit power is set at 14 dBm, the maximum allowed
    [43], using antennas with 2 dBi gain. The main parameters are shown in Table 3.
    Table 3. LoRa communication parameters. The LoRa wireless communication parameters
    in Table 2, were customized in an optimized algorithm in C language in the Arduino
    IDE. The optimized algorithm addresses different parameters [44,45] pre-installed
    libraries such as LoRa, OLED, etc.; Fr, BW, SF, CR; variable acquisitions, reception/transmission
    and data flow occurring within a period of 2000 ms. The MCUs used in the research
    had their own optimized algorithm. During the experiments, each end node was configured
    to transmit 100 packets to the LoRa gateway; as well as downstream communication
    node 3 received 100 payload packets. The flowchart of the optimized gateway algorithm
    is illustrated in Figure 9a. A summary of the simplified logic of the end-node
    operation is presented in Figure 9b. 5.4. Metrics During the experiments we used
    different metrics to characterize the connectivity between the transmitter and
    receiver (See Table 4): Table 4. Summary of evaluated metrics. The packet delivery
    ratio (PDR), provides information about the reliability of the communication;
    the PDR is calculated as the number of packets received by the gateway with respect
    to the total number of packets sent, with a value of 100% implying success and
    a value of 0 implying no success [41]. The received signal strength (RSSI) and
    signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are two physical layer PHY-level indicators of LoRa
    available on-chip, which we use to characterize the signal quality [46]. The connectivity
    range represents the measured distance between the receiver and the transmitter.
    Our objective was to study the connectivity range in the agricultural fields of
    the Chirinche Bajo community. 6. Experimental Results and Analysis The metrics
    considered in the study were packet delivery ratio (PDR), received signal strength
    indicator (RSSI), signal to noise ratio (SNR) and time on air (ToA), which are
    the parameters chosen to assess the performance of the LoRa communication uplink
    and downlink in the different environments of the Chirinche Bajo community. The
    experiments were conducted during weather variations with sun and rain from 5–23
    June 2022. The LoRa gateway was placed in a fixed position during all measurements,
    while the end nodes were placed in different locations as illustrated in Figure
    10. The evaluation was segmented into three groups: the first expedition was in
    the morning hours, the LoRa network was configured with SF at seven, a cloudy
    day with showers and a breeze was present; the average temperature was 16 °C,
    the relative humidity was in the range of 74–86% and the average UV radiation
    was in two indexes. Figure 10. End nodes in test positions. In the second evaluation,
    the SF was parameterized at nine and the weather was partially cloudy. At the
    end of the evaluation (POS G and H), the sun was present, the wind blew with medium
    intensity; the average temperature was 12 °C, the relative humidity was in a range
    of 74–89% and the average ultraviolet radiation was in one index. Finally, on
    the third excursion, it was a sunny day with high-intensity winds, the average
    temperature was 19 °C, the relative humidity was in a range of 53–68% and the
    average ultraviolet radiation was in four indices. This evaluation was carried
    out from 16h00. 6.1. PDR Package Delivery Ratio In this subsection, we present
    the PDR results for uplink communications, i.e., the end nodes send 100 packets
    to the gateway with a payload length of 16 bytes (node 1) and 8 bytes (node 2)
    with a frequency of 2000 ms, at various distances with different SF configurations,
    including SF = 7, 9 and 12. Figure 11a illustrates the PDR for node 1 and Figure
    11b the result for node 2. It can be visualized that the PDR decreases with increasing
    payload length, demonstrating an impact of packet length on frame reception. Being
    in the SF configuration in 12 with a PDR in the range of 42–47% with PL of 16
    bytes in positions D, F and G. Furthermore, it is determined that the PDR success
    rate is different for each end node depending on the test environment; therefore,
    in position A, B, C, E and H, a better PDR is obtained than in positions D, F
    and G. The effect is due to the fact that positions D, F and G are located in
    areas with slopes of about 15%, surrounded by eucalyptus trees, vegetation and
    no line of sight (NLoS), thus generating more interference, more path loss and
    noise to the LoRa radio communication signal. Figure 11. PDR: (a) Nodes 1, (b)
    Node 2. In contrast to the results obtained in [46], the tests carried out in
    a forested area at 90 m, there was no communication for the transmission powers
    tested (7, 13 and 14 dBm); in comparison with the present work, communication
    was achieved for this type of orography; obtaining a PDR of 42–47% in uplinks
    and downlinks a PDR greater than 87%, for forested areas. Node 3 was set up for
    downlink communications, i.e., the gateway sends 100 packets with a payload length
    of 4 bytes to the end node. Figure 12 shows the PDR of node 3. It is determined
    that the PDR with SF of 7, 9 and 12 at positions D, F and G maintains an acceptable
    success rate, since they are the locations with the highest interference, a PDR
    of no less than 87% is displayed. It is important to note that the objective of
    the tests is to check the coverage of the LoRa physical layer using different
    propagation factors. Figure 12. PDR Nodes 3. 6.2. Receiver Sensitivity Since there
    are many models and evaluations of the propagation of LoRa radio signals in various
    environments [28], this experiment focuses on testing the performance of LoRa
    receivers in the Chirinche Bajo community, as there are no studies conducted in
    these areas. The received signal strength indicators (RSSI) of the packets and
    the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were recorded at each of the positions. Figure
    13a,b show the RSSI values received at the gateway from node 1 and 2 with different
    SFs. RSSI values around the −111 dBm and −122 dBm mark are observed at positions
    D, F and G. The configuration with SF equal to nine emerges as the best option
    to achieve the highest throughput with the lowest packet on-air time at locations
    D, F and G. However, the alternative (SF at 12) could also be used. This would
    depend on the application’s tolerance to packet loss. Figure 13. RSSI of the radio
    (dBm): (a) Node 1, (b) Node 2. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with the RSSI are
    related, since, in positions D, F and G, there is more interference in the signal
    flow with SNR values in a range of −2.55 and −15.14, as can be seen in Figure
    14a,b. It should be noted that the signal sensitivity is largely influenced by
    the evaluation environment, which, in the case of positions D, F and G, was located
    on a 15% slope surrounded by eucalyptus trees and without a line of sight (NLoS).
    Figure 14. Radio SNR (dBm): (a) Node, (b) Node 2. The RSSI was evaluated in downlink
    communication, with a payload of 4 bytes, the sensitivity was in the range of
    −122 dBm and −125 dBm with SNR in a range of −2.51 and −6.27 in positions D, F
    and G; although, they are lower than in the uplinks, the PDR had higher efficiency.
    Figure 15 illustrates the RSSI of node 3 and Figure 16 shows the SNR with SF of
    7, 9 and 12. Figure 15. RSSI of the radio (dBm) of node 3. Figure 16. SNR of node
    3. 6.3. Time in the Air (ToA) It is noticeable that higher BW bandwidth gives
    a higher data rate [37], with shorter transmission time, as Equation (2) demonstrates.
    However, higher BW degrades the receiver sensitivity, as revealed by Equation
    (4), due to additional noise integration. For the transmission of a LoRa packet,
    its structure comprises three elements: preamble, header (optional) and payload.
    There are two types of LoRa packet format modes, explicit and implicit; where
    the header is removed from the packet, both the CR and payload size are fixed
    and must be manually configured on both sides of the radio link. Therefore, the
    implicit header mode reduces the transmission time of the packet, which is known
    in the LoRa literature as ToA calculated using Equation (3). For the study, we
    worked with the LoRa node parameters in Table 2. The packet structure in transmission
    consisted of the preamble plus the payload of 16 bytes, 8 bytes and 4 bytes with
    different SF. The result showed that the higher the SF, the airtime of a packet
    increases. These results can be seen in Figure 17. Figure 17. LoRa data packet
    transmission time. 6.4. Discussion In the literature, we identified works that
    have developed similar proposals. Many of the articles that were analyzed seem
    to assume that the terrain orography does not have much importance in the implementation
    of the network; these studies are focused on greenhouses. In [2,34,36,38,47],
    the type of orography of the site is not detailed. The different authors propose
    novel systems of intelligent agricultural management and monitoring based on LoRa,
    without considering the orography of the terrain in mountainous areas. Another
    important factor that is not taken into account when applying the network is the
    altitude of the locations, since these studies are located below 1700 m above
    sea level, being a factor that affects the transmission of data packets according
    to [46]. The distance between the gateway and the growing site of a LoRa network
    in rural areas according to [38] is 700 m; reaching a spreading factor of seven
    at 400 m and a spreading factor of nine reaching 500 m, respectively. In this
    context, it is explained that as the propagation factor increases, which is the
    communication delay between the client and the servers, an increase in the communication
    delay was obtained. The proposed system in Andean areas reduces this problem by
    maintaining optimal communication with SF settings of seven and nine in different
    weather conditions as explained in Section 6. According to the results found in
    [2] where they evaluate the performance of a LoRaWAN network, they confirm that
    the performance of the network is influenced by the sending of messages with or
    without acknowledgement, the size of the network, the increase in the number of
    gateways and the distance of placement of the gateway nodes, not to mention the
    weather conditions and even more the terrain orography. Therefore, the study focuses
    on the influence of the packet transmission interval together with the number
    of nodes on the packet delivery rate. Therefore, the importance of this study
    lies in the implementation of a monitoring system based on the LoRa network in
    mountainous areas of Ecuador. 7. Conclusions and Future Works In the literature,
    there are studies on the radio range of LoRa in geographic areas that do not exceed
    1700 m.a.s.l., in which it is stated that the coverage depends on the environment
    in which the network is implemented. So, this research was conducted, since there
    are no previous studies that give a detailed explanation of the LoRa network in
    mountainous areas above 2910 m.a.s.l. in the Andean region of Ecuador. The orography
    impaired the radio-link sensitivity, which was attenuated when located in positions
    with slopes of 15% with the presence of eucalyptus trees in the environment and
    without a line of sight with respect to the Gateway. The objective of implementing
    a monitoring system of climatic variables for the agricultural fields of the community
    of Chirinche Bajo was achieved. In Ecuador, the use of these LoRa networks is
    very limited due to the technological gap that exists in the Andean areas of Ecuador,
    in addition to the fact that agricultural processes are not technical due to the
    low technological knowledge of the population, which hinders the successful implementation
    of new technologies. To evaluate the range and avoid data loss in LoRa radio communication,
    the propagation factor (SF) was set to 7, 9 and 12, keeping the CR constant at
    (4/5) and BW at 125 kHz, in order to assess the sensitivity and integrity in the
    delivery of data packets. The SF setting equal to nine, emerged as the best option
    to achieve the highest throughput with the shortest packet on-air time. However,
    the alternative (FS at 12) could also be used to achieve higher coverage. Although,
    this would depend on the application’s tolerance to packet loss. The performance
    of LoRa communication with an SF of nine achieves a packet delivery success rate
    (PDR) for uplinks no lower than 76% and a PDR for downlinks higher than 92%. The
    scope of the LoRa network architecture is based on tests conducted in a 50-hectare
    field with a maximum range length of 875 m without a line of sight, obtaining
    adequate data delivery. The present work benefited 80 families in the community
    of Chirinche Bajo in the province of Cotopaxi in Ecuador, through the timely monitoring
    of climatic variables that mitigate agricultural losses due to adverse climatic
    effects. To increase the autonomy time of the nodes deployed in the crops, a feasibility
    analysis should be conducted to implement photovoltaic power generators, recharge
    the batteries and increase the operating time. Currently, work is being undertaken
    to improve security aspects by means of encryption algorithms such as Advanced
    Encryption Standard (AES) at the moment of transmitting the information. In addition,
    according to the findings of this work, we intend to implement an automated system
    that allows frost control, a harmful condition that affects agricultural production
    in the area. Author Contributions E.F.R.G.: Conceptualization, Data curation,

  description: The infestation of litchi stink bugs (Tessaratoma papillosa) has always
    had a significant impact on the yield of longan plantations. Pest control is critical
    for farmers to detect and timely suppress the occurrence of pests while effectively
    reducing damages. Environmental factors, climate change in particular, have contributed
    to the growing population of pests whereas weather can vary in different terrains,
    locations, and time. Due to the geographical and topographical conditions of Taiwan,
    this study focuses on investigating fruit plantations on sloping land in subtropics
    with distinct seasonal changes. The article aims at forecasting meteorological
    data based on Long short-term memory network (LSTM) and identifying the correlation
    between pest infestation and environmental factors through Machine Learning (ML).
    In this section, the structure and experimental process of the research will be
    outlined. At the first stage, meteorological information of the experimented site
    is obtained through the self-designed IoT (Internet of Things) system and wireless
    long-distance transmission technology. Since meteorological information forecasted
    is displayed in time series, multi-layer LSTM and bidirectional LSTM are used
    to solve the problem. Finally, environmental data and field surveys conducted
    for pest surveillance will be employed to forecast the severity of pest infestation
    through KNN, SVM, and random forest models. The result of the experiment shows
    that LSTM performs well in weather forecasting with 96% R-Squared values whereas
    the accuracy rate of pest prediction conducted by Machine Learning (ML) is 85%.
    The study verifies that meteorological factors do affect pest incidence. For example,
    the population of litchi stink bugs increase easily under suitable temperature,
    humidity, and sunlight. LSTM is superior in providing solutions for long-range
    dependence in statistics. This article shall present regions with shifting weather
    patterns, meteorological conditions and time length forecasted corresponding to
    the oceanic climate, as well as the correlation between pest population and environmental

    of ThingsLong-rangePest prevention and cureWeather factors 1. Introduction With
    the rapid advancement of IoT applications and internet technology, sensor devices
    are more commonly used in various fields. For example, IoT can be utilized for
    industrial purposes to monitor and predict the state of systems while in agriculture,
    IoT is implemented to observe the growth of plants by gathering environmental
    information. Artificial Intelligence (AI) analysis based on large amounts of data
    collected by IoT devices has become an important mechanism, which is also known
    as Artificial Internet of Things (AIoT). The analytic approach of artificial intelligence
    contains Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) to inspect anomalous data
    and predict forthcoming incidents. As an emerging technology for the future, AIoT
    is the convergence of AI and IoT conducive to interpreting and analyzing data
    in pursuance of identifying the best solution to the problem. Recently, Machine
    Learning and Deep Learning have been widely used to forecast future data in order
    to optimize business processes, advance technological development, and upgrade
    financial transactions. Data analysis is mainly based on current and historical
    data, statistical analysis methods, predictive models and a big-data-trained Machine
    Learning algorithm. The models optimized by the new technologies mentioned above
    allow the programmers to accurately predict future results through trend analysis
    while suggesting reasonable explanations for different trends as well as presenting
    inspection plans to manage unknown or abnormal incidents in order to improve future
    operating modes. In smart agriculture, IoT concept and technologies are mainly
    used to enable physical objects on the farm, such as agricultural machinery, facilities,
    soil, and crops to be sensed or controlled remotely by embedding sensing components
    (e.g. biological, environmental, and image recognition sensors) in the objects.
    Connected to the internet with wireless communication technology, data collected
    and captured through the sensors (such as temperature and humidity, luminosity,
    carbon dioxide, soil humidity, pests, etc.) are uploaded to the cloud database.
    Through IoT systems, consumer demands and business information can not only be
    gathered but also further explored, organized, and analyzed based on big data.
    The data processed can be converted to useful information for agricultural operations
    to help farm managers implement production and marketing planning, production
    management, and customer service. With intelligent monitoring, production and
    marketing processes can be facilitated to reduce redundant procedures of farm
    operation as well as decrease labor force so as to establish a more efficient
    model for farm management. The pest analyzed in this study is the litchi stink
    bug (Tessaratoma papillosa), which is a species of bug in the family Tessaratomidae
    classified under Hemiptera belonging to Insecta of Arthropoda in taxonomy [1].
    A scent gland is one of the crucial characteristics of the stink bug. Mainly distributed
    in South Asia and Southeast Asia, litchi stink bugs mostly feed on litchi and
    longan trees. They are destructive pests that usually cause damages to 20% 30%
    of the fruit trees in the plantation and even induce yield reductions of 90% in
    the worst cases. The bugs also live on roadside trees, such as Taiwan golden-rain
    trees and western soapberry trees, and may pose a risk to passersby since they
    tend to squirt defensive chemicals when threatened. The research report [2] indicates
    that the chemicals produced by litchi stink bugs may cause damages or allergy
    to human skins and temporary blindness for 1 2 days if sprayed onto the eyes.
    The bugs are hence regarded as pest insects for their defensive behavior that
    may agitate the general public. The adults and nymphs of litchi stink bugs use
    piercing-sucking mouthparts to extract plant fluids from buds, young shoots, flower
    spikes, and fruitlets, which results in abscission of flowers and immature fruits,
    withering twigs and fruitlets, as well as the black stains on the peel. These
    damages to fruit trees commonly account for low crop yields. Besides, the wound
    site caused by piercing is easy to be infected by Peronophythora downy blight
    and spreads Longan witches broom-associated virus (LWBD or LWBaV), which can be
    detrimental to flower spikes and fruit shafts and cause wilting of young twigs
    and fruitlets. Other damages include distorted twigs, curling sprouts, and deterioration
    of floral organs that leads to reproductive failure. This research will focus
    on analyzing two types of agricultural data sets: environmental data and on-site
    pest surveys. Since the environmental data in agriculture is indexed according
    to the time dimension, it is a sequence of data points that occur in successive
    order. Usually, time series are generated at regular spaced interval of time (for
    example, 1 s, 5 min, 1 h, seven days, etc.). So, time series can be analyzed and
    processed as discrete-time data. There are regular and irregular time series mainly
    divided into the following four patterns according to the changes of data: trend,
    periodicity, randomness, and comprehensiveness. Different from Convolutional Neural
    Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) mainly focuses on dynamic time behavior.
    It associates long-term time data and uses its neural network of internal state
    to cyclically process inputs of time series data. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
    is a special time recurrent neural network (RNN) with a unique structure and calculation
    unit that is suitable for processing and predicting events with long intervals
    and delays in time series. LSTM is developed to deal with the vanishing and exploding
    gradient problems in the calculation of long-time sequence. In conventional agriculture,
    crop yields are greatly affected by weather. It is impossible for farmers to predict
    weather conditions for the forthcoming weeks even based on their farming experiences
    accumulated for many years. Therefore, in the past, agriculture used to be vulnerable
    to pests, diseases, and weather that affect yields. In recent years, the application
    of predictive data in artificial intelligence technology has gradually matured.
    The implementations of IoT in agriculture include LSTM network through using historical
    data to forecast future environmental values. The past experiences of farmers
    can thus be preserved in another form to improve the procedures of pest control
    and growth management as soon as possible while enhancing the overall capacity.
    In this research, self-designed environmental sensor devices are evenly deployed
    in the orchard through IoT technology. Solar power is used to achieve an uninterrupted
    collection of environmental values. Wireless long-distance transmission and big
    data processing in cloud computing technology are employed to carry out real-time
    pest control in intelligent agriculture. LSTM models are used to forecast weather
    whereas Machine Learning is also adopted to identify the correlation between pests
    and environmental factors. Farmers can thus be provided with real-time weather
    conditions of the farmland. Future environmental values can be forecasted through
    historical data. Pest surveillance is conducted by experts to find out the correlation
    between climate change and pest infestation to help farmers take preventive measures
    and early detection against pests while managing plant growth. Applications (APPs)
    incorporated in farmland management can effectively increase crop yields. The
    structure of this article is as follows: literature and methods are presented
    in Section 2; research methods are elaborated in Section 3; Section 4 shows the
    methods of experiment; results of the experiment and verification for the research
    methods are illustrated in Section 5; in Section 6, key findings of the research
    are pointed out in detail whereas limitations and suggestions for future research
    are proposed. 2. Related literature At present, environmental sensors and image
    recognition systems to identify pests and diseases in IoT network are commonly
    used in smart agriculture. Researchers use sensors to record environmental data
    of plant growth and unmanned vehicles to collect crop images at different stages.
    AIoT technology is also implemented to analyze data relevant to plant physiology
    [3], plant species in taxonomy [4], crop disease monitoring [5], and pest control
    [6]. In the study of TN Balasooriya et al. [7], the author points out that in
    the current smart irrigation system used in agriculture, pH (power of hydrogen)
    values of irrigation water and soil moisture have not been taken into consideration.
    An IoT-based Smart Watering System (IBSWS) is then put forward to improve irrigation
    efficiency. The system can also be used to adjust the power of hydrogen value
    according to different crops so as to solve the problem of water waste in conventional
    agriculture. According to the IoT method applied to the environmental monitoring
    system of smart agriculture [8], it is mainly composed of four components: physical
    structure, data acquisition, data processing and data analysis systems. 2.1. Physical
    structure The physical structure is to detect events or changes in the environment.
    The sensor can simultaneously collect several environmental parameters and crop
    growth factors, such as light luminance, atmospheric pressure value, soil moisture
    and fertilizer parameters. Therefore, the stability and anti-interference ability
    of the sensor hardware are very important [9]. Hence, many studies have focused
    on reliable data transmission [10]. Van Staden’s paper [11] discussed data quality
    provided by sensors at different grades and proposed strategies for sensor maintenance.
    Sensors at certain grade are specified to meet most of the demands of the system.
    Data presented by sensors of high quality and average quality are also analyzed
    and compared. Users can decide whether they are willing to pay more for the sensors
    to acquire data with better quality based on data analyzed in the article. In
    the study [12], Okafor proposed network architecture and concept, such as establishing
    an accurate environmental monitoring model to achieve a stable result and using
    the data collected by the monitoring system to complete the missing data through
    the establishment of the model. A low-cost sensor (LCS) that can provide data
    of high-resolution measurement to reinforce information of the existing dataset
    collected by the current environmental monitoring system was also proposed. However,
    it is noted that LCS needs to be calibrated frequently to provide accurate and
    reliable data. 2.2. Data acquisition The data acquisition system comprises IoT
    data acquisition and data transmission modules. The IoT data acquisition module
    integrates different hardware interfaces by providing compatibility between devices
    and data and exchanges data based on proper communication protocols through, parallel
    transmission or serial transmission [13]. For the purpose of real-time monitoring,
    the data transmission is generally realized through wireless transmission protocols.
    According to the data transmission distance, it can be divided into short-distance
    transmissions such as wireless personal network (such as Bluetooth Low Energy
    (BLE), ZigBee) and long-distance transmissions, such as Long Range (LoRa) [14].
    In this study, a smart automation control system was designed and tested through
    LoRa at different distances [15]. Additionally, an application to monitor the
    temperature and humidity of the environment, which overcomes the limitations of
    traditional communication technology with low cost and high accuracy was developed
    in the study. 2.3. Data processing According to the type of data, data processing
    module can be classified into images, videos and scalar data. The module is integrated
    with data mining and data loading systems. This section provides various services
    based on system requirements. During the process of data collecting, the problem
    of sensor damages or data loss is often encountered. Gupta et al. [16] proposed
    a progressive localized framework for online error detection. The framework detects
    errors in data provided by local sensors through an online solution and used big
    data tools to deal with the problems. 2.4. Data analysis The data analysis module
    was designed for analyzing agricultural data being collected. As agricultural
    data are collected by multiple sets of sensors continuously on farmland, the amount
    of environmental data collected is tremendous. In such a way, the weather forecast
    of the environment can be performed precisely on those time series data to predict
    possible future changes [17]. In the study of Donlapark Ponnoprat [18], a model
    composed of two LSTM autoencoders was proposed to learn short-term dynamics and
    seasonal dynamics respectively to predict the period of rainfall. The results
    show that the LSTM model is better than other Deep Learning models. Through introducing
    seasonal autoencoders, the correlation between predicted values and actual values
    is then improved. Song et al. [19] attempt to solve the problem of data loss in
    the process of gathering sensor data. Different approaches are taken to fill the
    missing data. It is found out that LSTM neural network outperforms other models
    in reinforcing the data of long-term loss because of its distinct data filling
    approach. After comparing the results of the experiment deriving from different
    environmental parameters in the LSTM neural network, air humidity, photosynthetically
    active radiation, and soil temperature were chosen as the primary input. The results
    show that multi-dimensional parameter data constructive to filling the missing
    data can significantly extend the length of data sequence while maintaining accuracy
    and reducing the cumulative errors taking place in one-dimensional data processing.
    It is crucial to take preventive and controlling measures against litchi stink
    bugs. T. Boopath et al. [20] proposed to establish a network model with the autoregressive
    integrated moving average (ARIMAX) model to predict the occurrence of litchi stink
    bugs on a weekly basis to minimize the impact of pest infestations. However, for
    time series problems, regression models are mostly used. Although regression models
    have excellent results for data prediction, it requires the selection of efficient
    regression analysis [21] for the task requirements. In order to meet the impact
    of island-type climate on pest growth, this study uses LSTM to predict the growth
    environment of crops and uses machine learning methods. Because of the special
    memory structure, data of different lengths of time can be memorized and more
    accurate prediction results can be obtained. 3. Methodology This section introduces
    the transmission mechanism based on IoT network. Environmental time-series data
    are analyzed by the Long Short-term Memory Network. A large amount of data are
    subsequently further calculated and analyzed. Therefore, we have deployed multiple
    environmental sensor devices in the plantation to carry out real-time management
    of agricultural pests through the support from wireless transmission, big data
    processing in cloud computing, and artificial intelligence for pest prediction.
    The article uses IoT technology to provide farmers with real-time meteorological
    conditions of the farmland, such as atmospheric temperature, air humidity, soil
    humidity, and sunlight, etc. 3.1. Long-range wireless power transmission technology
    Long-range wireless communication technology is applied in General Packet Radio
    Service/Code Division Multiple Access (GPRS/ CDMA), digital radio, spread spectrum
    microwave, wireless network bridge and satellite communication, shortwave communication,
    LoRa low-power wireless transmission, etc. The technology is mainly utilized in
    remote areas or regions without proper access to lay cables, such as mining areas,
    offshore, or polluted sites. This study uses LoRa wireless transmission technology,
    which provides a wireless physical layer for long-range communication links to
    convert data into electromagnetic waves. Long-distance messages can be transmitted
    at a low transmission rate through linear frequency-modulated signals to reduce
    complexity as well as enhance security and reliability of messages. The network
    architecture of LoRa is built in star topology, in which end nodes can send messages
    to multiple gateways. Gateways are the bridge between end nodes of edge devices
    and the network server. Network server consolidates data and upload to application
    server, which is the end server. The transmission distance of LoRa can be as far
    as 20 km even without network deployment. Its base stations can be set up conveniently.
    LoRa is suited for periodical communications that do not need instant feedbacks.
    D. Yim. et al. [22] deployed LoRa wireless transmission in the woods and went
    through multiparameter regulation of different transmission protocols to observe
    their effects on the transmission distance and stability. Observations of LoRa
    transmission over long distances in the forest include: 1. The longer the transmission
    distance, the smaller the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) value; 2.
    Bandwidth (BW) has a negligible impact on LoRa but a significant impact on RSSI;
    3. The higher the spreading factor (SF), the better the reliability of LoRa and
    the longer the communication distance. Besides, Kufakunesu [23] and Chen [24]
    also compared various transmission protocols and pointed out the advantages and
    disadvantages of each transmission protocol and the suitable environment. 3.2.
    Long short-term memory Hochreiter and Schmidhuber [25] proposed Long Short-term
    Memory (LSTM), which is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model. It mainly overcomes
    the shortcomings of the vanishing and exploding gradient problems caused by the
    long-time sequence of cyclic neural networks during training. It is composed of
    intelligent network units that can retain short-term and long-term data. It mainly
    stores data through memory units to learn the long-term dependencies of time series
    data. A common LSTM unit contains an input gate, an output gate, and a forget
    gate. The three gates regulate the flow of information, including data update,
    data output, and eliminating irrelevant information to control data delivery.
    The LSTM model has four functional elements: “ ” is Hadamard product, “＋” is matrix
    addition, “ ” and “tanh” are activation functions. The calculation process is
    divided into three stages: forgetting, selecting memory, and output. At the forgetting
    stage, data passed in from the previous module are selectively memorized depending
    on how much information the forget gate decides to keep or forget. At the stage
    of selecting memories, the input gate is used to quantify the importance of input
    data and select the part for the model to remember. At the output stage, the output
    gate determines which data is relevant to be given based on the current expectation.
    Fig. 1 shows long short-term memory (LSTM) cell. Processing time-series data through
    special memory methods and calculation rules, the LSTM model has better performance
    in handling machine translation, speech recognition, and abnormal numerical diagnosis
    that require complex calculations. LSTM has good accuracy in predicting stock
    market prices and trends or detect anomalies in industrial production lines. When
    applied in weather forecasts, the LSTM model uses machines to learn environmental
    sensing data via satellites and radars to obtain better accuracy. It requires
    plenty of training time and efforts in big data analysis to calculate these long-term
    time-series data for high-accuracy meteorological information. Download : Download

    and experimental process. The experimented site is located in a fruit plantation
    on sloping land. The species of plants include longan, litchi, banana, and carambola.
    Focusing on the prevention and pest control measures against litchi stink bugs,
    this article aims to develop IoT sensors for pest surveillance and forecasting.
    Microclimate monitoring stations that are suitable for sloping land can collect
    environmental sensing data and upload data from the server to the cloud database
    through wireless transmission. We cooperated with pest survey specialists to investigate
    the current occurrence of pests in the plantation. Population of the pests and
    the areas of their occurrence were also recorded in detail. Through the data collected,
    we can analyze the relevance of environmental factors to the severity of pest
    infestation. Several neural network and machine learning methods are used for
    model training to identify environmental factors that may affect the occurrence
    of pests. Two LSTM models for environmental data analysis are utilized. First,
    a model is trained to determine the degree of pest infestation and its corresponding
    environmental factors. Another model can be built to forecast environmental data
    based on the LSTM model undergoing training with historical data. This model can
    provide short-term forecasts for weather conditions and integrate the previously
    trained pest recognition model to improve the accuracy of predicting pest’s occurrence
    area. The prediction flow chart is shown in Fig. 2. Download : Download high-res

    method to predict the pests’ occurrence based on environmental factors. 4.1. Deploy
    microclimate monitoring stations We deployed six sets of microclimate monitoring
    stations in a plantation on the sloping land in Nanhua District, Tainan City,
    Taiwan, on July 10, 2020. The microclimate stations were set up at the height
    of 100 to 200 cm with telescopic brackets. The antennas and solar panels were
    placed on the top of the rack to ensure wireless transmission and a stable solar
    power supply. The light sensor is placed at the top of the sensor box. The outer
    cover is waterproof to prevent rain and moisture from damaging the sensor to ensure
    data correctness. The deployment of microclimate stations is shown in Fig. 3.
    We incorporated Raspberry Pi 4 with several environmental sensors to capture temperature
    (°C), humidity (%), soil moisture (%), light intensity (lux), and atmospheric
    pressure (Pa). The microclimate monitoring stations deployed in the plantation
    can transmit data to the cloud database for calculation through LoRa wireless
    transmission technology. Fig. 4 shows sensor configuration inside the microclimate
    station and the on-site setup. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download

    architecture inside the sensor box Fig. 5 shows the configuration of the environment
    sensors inside the microclimate stations deployed in the plantation. Based on
    IoT technology, the experiment uses Arduino Nano [26] as a small embedded platform
    to integrate four kinds of sensors: GY-30 for light, YL-69 for soil, DHT22 for
    temperature and humidity, and BMP180 for atmospheric pressure. Five factors of
    the environmental data, including temperature, humidity, light level, soil humidity,
    and atmospheric pressure in the field have been collected. We used DS3231 module
    [27] to calibrate the clock for the microprocessor. Arduino Nano receives a set
    of environmental data every hour and transmit the data to the Raspberry Pi 4 Server
    through the LoRa transmission module. The Raspberry Pi 4 Server then uploads the
    data to the cloud database for storage via wireless network. The microcontroller
    Arduino also stores the data in the SD module inside the sensor to prevent data
    loss if transmission failure occurs. Download : Download high-res image (908KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. The Raspberry Pi 4 and sensors hardware
    layout in the sensor box. The wireless transmission module used in the microclimate
    station is Grove-LoRa Radio with the transceiver SX1276 [28]. Because of the low
    power consumption and high reliability of LoRa, data can be wirelessly transmitted
    from the Client to Raspberry Pi 4 Server with stable quality. Environmental data
    stored in the cloud database transmitted from Raspberry Pi 4 allow developers
    to monitor real-time changes of the environment for the use of information retrieval
    and analysis. To collect sensing data in the field whenever necessary, six sets
    of environmental sensors deployed are all equipped with LoRa wireless transmission
    modules. Environmental data are transmitted through the LoRa wireless module to
    the Raspberry Pi 4 Server and then uploaded to the cloud database to provide managers
    with instant query functions and access to the data. The Server (Raspberry Pi
    4) can connect to at most 6 sets of environmental sensors simultaneously. 4.3.
    LoRa transmission mechanism test The experiment uses LoRa as the wireless transmission
    mechanism. The transmission rate of LoRa is different from that of the 4G network
    technology. LoRa can support long-range transmission of massive data while WIFI
    and Bluetooth provide short-range transmission of large amounts of data. Since
    it has the key characteristics of low power requirements and long-range communications
    for small amounts of data, LoRa technology is typically applied as a solution
    to the long-range machine-to-machine (M2M) transmission. It can be used to serve
    a larger coverage area, like an inter-city IoT transmission platform. In this
    experiment, Raspberry Pi 4 with LoRa module is used as a server platform to receive
    environmental data from various sensors placed in the field. Each environmental
    sensor box is equipped with a set of LoRa transmission modules. The LoRa transmission
    module we chose is Grove-Lora Radio 868 MHz. Using the RFM95 chip of SX1276 LoRa,
    it has the maximum power to 20dbm. The transmitting and receiving ends are equipped
    with a nine dBi gain omnidirectional antenna to enhance the transmission in the
    plantation on the sloping land with variations in elevation. We deployed the solar-powered
    microclimate monitoring station of this specification at 13:00 on August 30, 2020,
    in the longan plantation on sloping land. Eight months later, on the day of April
    30, 2021, the sensors of the station still functioned steadily and continuously
    to receive data. Fig. 6 shows the internal hardware configuration of the microclimate
    monitoring station with solar panels and power management modules. Download :

    litchi stink bugs laying eggs to effectively control the adult population of the
    species. This study conducted pest population monitoring in the plantation on
    sloping land in Nanhua District, Tainan City, Taiwan, in 2020 and 2021. The pest
    survey specialists selected 7–10 longan trees to carry out the research. During
    the period of investigation, no pesticide was used on the selected trees to avoid
    affecting the actual adult population. Sampling was carried out on a weekly basis
    to include all stages of their life cycle except the egg-laying period. Since
    the insects tend to move toward warm and sunny places, 10–15 twigs facing east,
    south, west, and north respectively were picked from the treetops for field investigations.
    The number of the bugs on the backside of the leaves would be counted. Fig. 7
    demonstrates different stages of the insect under surveillance. The survey specialists
    would measure time needed at different stages: Label 1 30 min before laying eggs,
    Label 2 nymphs emerging from the eggs 30 min later, Label 3 nymphs, Label 4 adult
    stink bugs. Download : Download high-res image (681KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 7. Images of pest surveillance taken in the field. 4.5. Correct environmental
    sensing data and display the data in graphics Since the microclimate monitoring
    stations need to be placed outdoors for a long time, unpredictable factors may
    happen to cause anomalous data. Besides, a packet error may occur during the process
    of real-time wireless data transmission to the server station and result in receiving
    an abnormal value. Hence, we propose a method to check environmental sensing data
    received and perform data correction. Fig. 8 is the graph showing the uncalibrated
    data from November 29, 2020, to March 5, 2021, provided by the first group of
    the microclimate monitoring stations. The sample rate for each sensor in the graph
    indicates a data per hour. Data collected from the plantation on sloping land
    in Nanhua District, Tainan City, include the values of temperature, humidity,
    light, and soil humidity. It shows in Fig. 8 that the values measured at specific
    time points are abnormal. In the temperature data of Fig. 8(a), one of the values
    exceeds 100 degrees Celsius, which is apparently an anomalous data that needs
    to be corrected. In Fig. 8(b) showing the humidity values in the environment,
    several data values exceed 100, which are obvious anomalies because the relative
    humidity unit is a percentage, which means the value exceeding 100 is abnormal
    and needs to be corrected. Fig. 8(c) shows the soil moisture data. Since the unit
    of soil moisture is a percentage, it needs to be corrected to ensure data accuracy
    in the future reception. In Fig. 8(d) showing the light value, several consecutive
    data values are 65535; however, from the result of the experiment, it is impossible
    for the light sensor to detect the value of 65535 even under the strongest sunlight.
    Thus, 65535 is regarded as an abnormal value and needs to be corrected. The study
    employs a moving average to examine whether there is an anomaly in each data and
    correct the outliers with the following steps: Download : Download high-res image
    (827KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. Environmental data result
    presentation without calibration. (a) Environmental sensing data are serial data.
    Assuming that the th data is abnormal, check the th and th data to see if there
    is anomaly. If the and are accurate data, the th and th values will be averaged
    to replace the th value. (b) If the th is also an outlier, continue searching
    forward for a non-outlier. The non-outlier value identified and the th data are
    averaged as the th value. (c) If the th is also an outlier, continue searching
    backward for a non-outlier. The preceding and succeeding non-outliers of the th
    data would be averaged to replace the th value. (d) If the first data is an outlier,
    search backward for a non-outlier to replace it. (e) If the last data is an outlier,
    search forward for a non-outlier to replace it. It can be seen from Fig. 9 that
    after corrected by the method, no more outliers are identified in the environmental
    sensing sequence. The method can be used to calibrate environmental sensing data
    for further analysis and review to facilitate management. The calibrated environmental
    sensing data can be displayed through APPs to provide farm managers with a timely
    control of the environment in the farm. Fig. 9(a) is the corrected temperature,

    data result presentation with calibration. 4.6. Method for forecasting pest incidence
    and outbreak The study combines various data from environmental sensors with on-site
    investigations of the occurrence of litchi stink bugs. The environmental parameters
    collected by the sensors (temperature, humidity, light intensity, and soil moisture)
    are used as the input samples of the model. The LSTM network model is applied
    to perform environmental data generation. To begin with, input parameters have
    to be confirmed. A multi-dimensional environmental data is generated every hour.
    The method enables farmers to predict the emergence of litchi stink bugs and prevent
    the growth of the pests with sufficient time. Meanwhile, pest investigators gather
    information about the population dynamics and meteorological data in the field
    on a weekly basis. From the monitored system, within the continuous data of the
    input dataset, 336 environmental data in a week are generated whereas the above
    four environmental parameters are recorded every hour. The method used in this
    study to forecast pest incidence and outbreak is a customized approach based on
    the actual demand in real life. Data obtained from pest surveillance are converted
    to the degree of severity in terms of pest infestation to estimate the accuracy
    of the ML model used. Environmental data acquired in the current week correlating
    to the pest population are utilized to support the estimation, based on which,
    the system would come up with certain dates. If pest incidence does happen on
    these dates, the estimation would be evaluated as accurate. In addition, the ML
    model is used to identify the environmental factors associated with the occurrence
    of litchi stink bugs and forewarn farmers with environmental parameters that need
    to be paid attention to. Population of the pests may increase when the weather
    pattern changes. The ML model is facilitated by the Scikit-learn package [29].
    Scikit-learn is an open-source Python library supporting the implementation of
    machine learning algorithms. NumPy [30] and SciPy [31] are scientific computing
    tools for Python. As Python is widely used nowadays, Scikit-learn becomes more
    and more popular. Scikit-learn is characterized by a comprehensive coverage of
    ML models. The features of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) [32], Support Vector Machine
    (SVM) [33], and Random Forest [34] will also be compared. 5. Results and discussion
    5.1. Using LSTM for missing data prediction This study proposes a data filling
    method for the environmental data to improve the quality of pest prediction analysis.
    The predictive model contains a three-layer LSTM and bidirectional LSTM model
    to retain the time-series characteristics. Historical data are added with weight
    for effective transmission. The time intervals wherein the missing values occur
    should be first identified. Effective historical data through the past two months
    before the data missing point would be utilized to train the predictive model
    to effectively provide environmental data that can fill the missing value. This
    experiment compares the three-layer LSTM model with the bidirectional LSTM model.
    The determination coefficient (R2) and the mean square error (Mean-Square Error)
    are used to evaluate the reasonable accuracy of different sequence durations.
    In statistics, the coefficient of determination is the proportion of the variance
    for a dependent variable explained by an independent variable. When its R square
    gets close to 1, the model can explain almost all the variation. The mean square
    error (MSE) refers to as Mean or Average of the square of the difference between
    actual and expected values. The smaller the value of MSE, the better the accuracy
    of the prediction model to analyze the experimental data. The three-layer LSTM
    model parameters are epoch 20, batch size 128, optimizer adam, loss function MSE,
    excitation function Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU). The three-layer LSTM model is
    with the number of neurons set as 256, 128, and 64. The units are sequentially
    decreased to avoid the model from overfitting due to the increase in the number
    of epochs. At the same time, the dropout layer is added to the first layer of
    LSTM to reduce overfitting. The parameters of the bidirectional LSTM model are
    epoch 20, batch_size 128, optimizer adam, loss function MSE, and excitation function
    ReLU. In the bidirectional LSTM model, the number of forward and backward neurons
    is set as 256 units. This experiment compares the differences of models trained
    with sequence lengths of 6, 12, 24, 72, 168, and 336 h respectively to observe
    the sequence length suitable for the model through the determination coefficient
    (R2) and the mean square error (Mean-Square Error). Table 1 shows that the determination
    coefficient and mean square error index are calculated after training with three-layer
    LSTM and bidirectional LSTM for different sequence lengths. The results show that
    when the sequence length of the three-layer LSTM is set as 72 h, the R2 is 0.969
    and the MSE is 0.908, which is the better performance in different sequence parameters
    of the same model. Download : Download high-res image (611KB) Download : Download

    0.968 MSE 1.233 1.241 0.981 0.95 0.97 0.944 Since the system is trained in Taiwan,
    environmental data obtained are mostly about oceanic climate. It is inferred that
    in places with significant variations of weather, a stacked network architecture
    model can hardly memorize long data because the data flow is in a single direction.
    Therefore, we can expect a better performance if the sequence length is 72 h with
    72 data as a set in three days for training. In addition, when the sequence length
    is set as 336 h in the bidirectional LSTM, R2 is 0.969 and MSE is 0.908, which
    are better evaluation indicators for different sequence time lengths. It is speculated
    that the current state would be associated with past or future data because of
    the forward and backward data flow. The sequence length is 336 h to adapt to the
    large amount of data, which means that 336 data sets in 2 weeks are utilized for
    prediction to acquire more accuracy data. Data loss mainly occurs due to instability
    of sensors and power supplies during the transmission process. Hence, missing
    data needs to be filled. In Fig. 10, the trained bidirectional LSTM model is applied
    to complement the missing data. Fig. 10(a) shows environmental data with missing
    values. Fig. 10(b) shows the trained Bidirectional LSTM network model with the
    length of 336 to predict the missing values while calculating the accuracy of
    the predicted value and the actual data. Download : Download high-res image (633KB)

    monitoring system from November 29, 2020, to June 30, 2021 as a training dataset.
    Pest data were labeled by the pest experts in the investigation on the population
    dynamics of litchi stink bugs in the field. The number of pest surveys is converted
    into 6 degrees of impact, with 0 5 representing its severity. Since the pest survey
    data is conducted once per week, the amount of environmental data are divided
    into one week (336 records) to monitor the pest population. Three machine learning
    models (KNN, SVM, Random Forest) are used in the experiment based on different
    environmental factors as input. The predictive model then forecasts the correlation
    between environmental factors and the degree of pest infestation. The KNN model
    parameters are n_neighbors 6, weights ‘uniform’, algorithm ‘auto’, metric ‘minkowski’.
    The SVM model parameters are kernel ‘rbf’, , gamma ‘auto’. The parameters of the
    random forest model are n_estimators 10, criterion ‘gini’, max_depth none, min_samples_split
    1. Table 2 shows the accuracy of machine learning algorithms used to predict pest
    incidence and outbreak. The input for ML model is environmental data through a
    week. The accuracy rate is about 85%. Although the accuracy for the results seems
    satisfactory, errors in the predictions still exist. In future research, the importance
    of model performance at different time and the application of RNN, LSTM, and Gated
    Recurrent Unit (GRU) in time series has to be taken into account. Time series
    dependence should be retained instead of using machine learning methods to predict
    the degrees of severity for pest infestation. Fig. 11 shows the results of using
    different environmental factors (temperature, humidity, light intensity, and soil
    humidity) to estimate the pest population. The vertical axis is the number of
    pests while the horizontal axis indicates the number of continuous data (day).
    From Fig. 11, we can see the influence of individual environmental factors on
    the pest population. Among them, in Fig. 11(d) soil moisture is relatively irrelevant
    to pest population whereas in Fig. 11 (a, b, c), temperature, humidity, and light
    show certain extent of impact to pest population. Table 2. Accuracy of machine
    learning algorithms to predict pest incidence. ML model KNN SVM Random forest
    Accuracy 86.2% 85.7% 83.2% Based on the pest population, severity of pest infestation
    in six degrees (from 0 5) is illustrated in Fig. 12. In the research, the amount
    of pests is estimated according to the different environment factors weighted
    respectively with calculation and analysis. Fig. 12 shows the result of the degrees
    of pest incidence. Download : Download high-res image (268KB) Download : Download

    factors. 6. Conclusion This article proposes a prediction model that combines
    IoT technology with long and short-term memory networks (LSTM). It can predict
    the occurrence and distribution of litchi stink bugs in the future based on historical
    data, including meteorological factors and pest survey. It is critical to help
    farmers take up crop protection and pest control measures to prevent damages to
    the yields. Through the self-designed IoT system, the Raspberry Pi 4 server and
    different environmental sensors are placed in the farmland. Data communication
    is carried out through low-power, long-distance wireless transmission. The environmental
    sensing data of the experimented site is transmitted to the main server while
    data is uploaded in the cloud database. It is beneficial in alleviating patrolling
    workload in the farmland, reducing labor force and other resources. On the one
    hand, the use of environmental sensing data based on long and short-term memory
    networks can not only forecast meteorological conditions but also fill in the
    missing values of historical data. On the other hand, by incorporating environmental
    data with pest surveys, the system can be trained through machine learning technology
    to predict the correlation between environmental factors, such as temperature,
    humidity, and light, and pest incidence. Farmers can be provided with real-time
    information on the growth of fruit trees in the plantation and the most common
    areas for pest infestation, where a unmanned aerial vehicle for plant protection
    can be controlled to spray pesticides in the epidemic areas and avoid the other
    locations to lessen the environmental impact caused by excessive pesticides. This
    will significantly reduce the amount of pesticides used, enhance the efficiency
    of farmers, and boost fruit production. High-tech intelligent agricultural management
    is thus achieved. The experimented site is in a plantation on a subtropical sloping
    land. Due to the drastic topographical variations, there are a variety of crops
    in the plantation. The place has an oceanic climate with distinct seasonal changes.
    Since the environmental data collected fluctuate more frequently compared to the
    circumstances in other regions with stable weather conditions, the distinctiveness
    of the data obtained in the experiment should be paid extra attention to. On the
    other hand, the survey data of pest insects also shows some impact. With different
    sampling standards, the selection of representative trees for target pest measurement
    also varies. Surveys conducted on different locations, such as the treetops, different
    sides of the leaves, or facing different directions, result in various consequences.
    It is suggested that the rules for collecting environmental dataset and conducting
    pest survey should be determined before the experiment. In order to obtain consistent
    experimental data, the rule for dataset collection must be carried out through
    the same model to establish a standard process for future training. In addition,
    this study uses a machine learning model to classify the severity of pest infestation
    and can accurately identify the correlation between the population dynamics of
    pests and environmental factors. Due to the prolonged forecasting time, error
    predictions about pest incidence still occur. It is noteworthy that different
    time of the year means different stage of life cycle for the pests, which should
    be taken into consideration in the future research. The frameworks aiming to solve
    time series tasks, such as RNN, LSTM and Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU), should be
    placed importance on to maintain time dependence of pest data and advance the
    use of machine learning in predicting the severity of pest infestation. CRediT

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Huaihua, China SECTION I. Introduction Microwave
    radar remote sensing has the characteristics of penetrating detection without
    contact, and besides, it is not blocked by fog, clouds and rain, and can realize
    all-weather and all-day detection [1], [2]. It can also penetrate the soil and
    vegetation to a certain extent, thus to reflect different surface soil and crop
    characteristics [3]–[6]. These abilities make it extremely potential in agricultural
    monitoring. With the advantages of convenient transportation, high flexibility,
    short operation cycle and high data resolution, UAV airborne microwave remote
    sensing effectively overcomes the shortcomings of satellite remote sensing technology,
    such as being greatly affected by weather, low spatial and temporal resolution,
    and being limited by transit cycle, becomes a new way to realize agricultural
    information rapidly and accurately on a large area of farmland. However, the UAV
    airborne microwave radar monitoring data, such as the angle of incidence, area
    of illumination, width, etc., are greatly affected by the UAV flight attitude,
    flight stability, and the surface roughness and terrain of the measured environment.
    Therefore, a special UAV airborne microwave radar imaging system must be designed
    to achieve the adaptive adjustment of microwave radar attitude, data transmission
    and other functions. And corresponding imaging algorithms also need to be built,
    to realize remote sensing monitoring and visual management of agricultural information
    such as soil moisture. Aimed at the above problems, this paper designs an UVA
    airborne microwave radar system and constructs the suitable imaging algorithm,
    so as to achieve accurate data acquisition, echo analysis and imaging. Firstly,
    the PTZ (Pan/Tilt/Zoom) device and its control system are designed and developed
    for microwave radar carrying and radar elevation angle monitoring. Using the attitude
    acquisition module, the radar elevation angle can be adjusted adaptively, through
    the motor drive circuit in real time. So as to solve the problem that the UAV
    body posture is unstable and the radar data is vulnerable to terrain changes.
    Then, an airborne core processing module is developed to realize the communication,
    control and data transmission between radar, UAV and ground flight controller.
    An imaging algorithm has been constructed at the same time, based on Range-Doppler
    algorithm (RD) to process and image the echo signal received by microwave radar.
    We also complete the simulation of target imaging in MATLAB to verify the feasibility
    of the imaging algorithm. Finally, the developed airborne microwave radar system
    has been used to conduct target detection tests on angle reflectors and aluminum
    spheres arranged at fixed positions on the ground, so as to evaluate the performance
    of the system. SECTION II. Development of Airborne Microwave Radar System The
    airborne microwave radar PTZ and core processing module are developed at first,
    to realize the angle adaptively control of microwave radar, as well as to achieve
    the communication, control and data transmission between UAV, radar and ground
    flight controller. A. Hardware System Design The carrying platform used in this
    paper is Dajiang M600 pro six-rotor UAV, and the microwave radar module used in
    this paper is PulsOn 440 (hereinafter referred to as P440) produced by American
    Time Domain Company. The transceiver band of P440 is 3.1-4.8GHz, the center frequency
    is 4.3GHz (C-band), and the standard power supply voltage is 4.5-48V DC. The PTZ
    device designed for carrying microwave radar consists of base, main control board,
    attitude acquisition module, wireless transmission module, motor drive module
    and DC power module. The overall framework of the system is shown in Figure 1.

    microwave radar PTZ base is shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. The structure of ptz
    base Show All The base is used to carry the PTZ main control board, the attitude
    acquisition module MPU-6050 and the microwave radar. After the UAV is started,
    it enters the upper part of the farmland for information collection through flight
    control, and the PTZ system automatically initialize. After initialization, the
    attitude acquisition module MPU-6050 converts the pitch angle generated by the
    UAV relative to the horizontal plane during flight into an electrical signal,
    and send it to the MCU (main control board) processing circuit. Then, the MCU
    processing circuit processes the electrical signals from the MPU-6050 and sends
    commands to the motor drive circuit in the form of control pulses. The motor drive
    circuit sends PWM signals to the drive chips of three-phase DC brushless motor
    I and three-phase DC brushless motor II for angle adjustment, and then through
    the relative movement between the upper arm and the lower arm and the PTZ box,
    Make the microwave radar always maintain a 45° depression angle with the ground,
    and realize the attitude maintenance function of the PTZ device. The work flow
    chart of microwave radar PTZ is shown in Figure 3. Figure 3. The work flow chart
    of microwave radar ptz Show All B. Design of Signal Acquisition and Wireless Transmission
    System The upper end of the UAV is equipped with a router and an airborne computer.
    The router provides a network environment for the airborne computer. The ground
    flight control monitors the radar status and sends instructions to the airborne
    computer. While the airborne computer judges and analyzes the received instructions
    to control the process of microwave radar collecting information. The microwave
    radar will transmit the collected information to the airborne computer for storage,
    and take out the collected information for analysis after the flight mission.
    Ground flight control uses MRM RET software an airborne computer to control the
    microwave radar. Click the start scanning button to command radar module to transmit
    signals. After background noise scanning for about 10s, real-time scanning data
    can be observed. The collected data includes the following information: scan message
    id (scanning data package No.), source node id (radar module No.), scan start
    ps (scan start time), scan stop ps (scan stop time), time since last scan (scan
    interval), antenna id (antenna mode), and first detection (transmission distance
    of the first arrival pulse signal). As shown in Figure 4, the types of data that
    can be read including raw data, bandpass, motion filtered data, detection moving
    point list, and the first detection point. Figure 4. The interface for signal
    acquisition and transmission Show All The real object of airborne microwave radar
    operation platform is shown in Figure 5. Figure 5. The real object of airborne
    microwave radar operation platform Show All SECTION III. Airborne Microwave Radar
    Imaging Algorithm In this part, an imaging algorithm has been constructed based
    on Range-Doppler algorithm (RD) to process and image the echo signal received
    by microwave radar. The simulation of target imaging in MATLAB is also completed,
    to verify the feasibility of the imaging algorithm. While using the RD algorithm
    to achieve airborne microwave radar imaging, the echo signal is decoupled along
    the range and azimuth directions respectively, which is decomposed into two one-dimensional
    signals [6]–[9]. The pulse compression is used to achieve the range direction
    high-resolution data acquisition, and the Doppler information in the echo is used
    to complete the azimuth direction high-resolution data acquisition [10]. In addition,
    due to the coupling between the azimuth and range directions of the echo signal,
    the maximum value of the range envelope will change with time in different range
    positions, that is, the range migration phenomenon. In order to improve the imaging
    accuracy, the range expression between the radar and the target should be expanded
    according to the second-order Taylor expansion and ignore the high-order terms,
    so as to achieve the decoupling of range and azimuth, that is, range migration
    correction processing. In general, RD algorithm is mainly divided into three steps:
    distance compression; range migration correction and azimuth compression. The
    RD algorithm steps are shown in Figure 6. Figure 6. The rd algorithm steps Show
    All Before constructing the algorithm, we firstly analyze the mathematical logic
    of the algorithm design. Assume that the radar transmission signal is a Chirp
    pulse train s t (t) , s t (t)= Σ n=∞ n=−∞ p(t−nPRT) (1) View Source Where p(t)
    = s 0 (t)cos[2π f 0 t+φ(t)],  φ(t)= π r t 2 , View Source s 0 (t) is the envelope
    of the transmitted signal, k r is the FM slope of the transmitted signal, f 0
    is the center frequency of the transmitted signal, and PRT is the pulse repetition
    period. Then, the echo signal s r (t) reflected by the target at the slant distance
    R(t) received by the radar at time t can be expressed as: s r (t)=σ W a [t− R(t)
    c ] s t [t− 2R(t) c ] = Σ n=∞ n=−∞ σ W a [t− R(t) c ]p[t−nPRT− 2R(t) c ] (2) View
    Source Where σ is the backscattering coefficient of the target, W a (t) is the
    antenna azimuth function, and c is the speed of light. After quadrature demodulation,
    s r (t) can be expressed as a complex signal s(t) [11]: s(t)= ∑ n=−∞ n=∞ σ W a
    [t− R(t) c ] s 0 [t−nPRT− 2R(t) c ] exp[−j 4π λ R(t)]exp{−j[φt−nPRT− 2R(t) c ]}
    (3) View Source Where λ is the radar wavelength, and the two exponential directions
    in (3) respectively represent the phase modulation in the azimuth direction and
    the phase modulation in the range direction. To regard the process of radar system
    receiving echo signal as the process of a ground target backscattering through
    a linear system, and decompose time into the fast time components τ and the slow
    time component r a , then s(τ, t a )=σ⊕ h 1 (τ, t a ) ⊕ τ h 2 (τ) (4) View Source
    Where ⊕ represents two-dimensional convolution, and ⊕ τ represents the convolution
    of. And t=τ+ t a , t a =k⋅PRT, h 1 (τ, t a )= W a ( t a )exp[−j 4π λ R( t a )]δ[t−
    2R( t a ) c ], h 2 (τ)= s 0 (τ)exp(jπ k r τ 2 ). View Source Then, h 1 (τ, t a
    ) indicates the azimuth phase modulation caused by the relative motion between
    the radar platform and the target. If R( t a ) is expanded by the second-order
    Taylor expansion, the azimuth phase of echo is a quadratic function of τ a , that
    is, a Chirp signal; And h 2 (τ) represents a Chirp signal in the range direction
    [12]. Range processing is to complete the matched filtering of h 2 (τ) . Select
    the reference function for distance direction processing, g r (τ)= h ∗ 2 (−τ)=
    s 0 (−τ)exp(−jπ k r τ 2 ), View Source then the processed range signal can be
    approximately expressed as: s(τ, t a )=σ⊕ h 1 (τ, t a ) ⊕ τ A r (τ) (4) View Source
    Where A r (τ) is the sinc function. Expanding R( t a ) by the second-order of
    Taylor expansion, using the time-frequency relationship of the azimuth echo Chirp
    signal, and Fourier transforming the azimuth signal, then, the frequency domain
    azimuth signal after range migration correction can be obtained as s RMC (τ, t
    a ) , S RMC (τ, t a )=σ⋅ W a ( t a ). exp[−jπ f dr ( t a − X v a )] A r [τ− 2
    R ref c ] (5) View Source Where R ref is the reference range after range migration
    correction, f dr is the modulation slope of azimuth Doppler frequency. The azimuth
    signal can be obtained by pulse compression of s RMC (τ, t a ) . According to
    the above derivation process, the MATLAB programs are compiled to simulate the
    imaging process of a single point target at a distance of 2m from the radar, as
    shown in Figure 7. Figures 7 (a) and 7 (b) show the profile of the echo signal
    in the range and azimuth directions respectively, and Figure 7 (c) shows the imaging
    results of a single point target. Figure 7. The simulation calculation results
    Show All SECTION IV. Experiment and System Performance Verification In order to
    check whether the UVA airborne microwave radar system can realize target recognition
    and imaging, an experiment has been designed to collect and process the radar
    echo. That is, place known targets on the ground, and use the airborne microwave
    radar system to locate and image the target shape and position. This experiment
    was completed in the China Academy of Water Saving Agriculture in Dry Areas, Northwest
    A&F University. Angle reflectors and aluminum spheres of different sizes were
    placed on the ground in turn and at equal intervals to be measured. Figure 8 shows
    the commissioning site. Figure 8. The experimental site Show All When the distance
    between the two measured targets is 25cm and the flight height of the UAV is about
    3m, the imaging result is shown in Figure 9 (a), and the amplitude curve of the
    imaging result in the range direction is shown in Figure 9 (b). It can be seen
    from Figure 9 that the imaging results are in the same direction; and the distance
    between the two peaks of the amplitude curve is 22.1 cm, which means that the
    relative deviation of the distance is 9.6%. Analyze the above results, it can
    be found that the UAV airborne microwave radar imaging system and its algorithm
    designed and developed in this paper can realize the detection and imaging of
    ground targets. However, there are some errors in the system measurement results.
    The main reason for errors generation is that when the UAV flies close to the
    ground (flight height is 3m), the left and right deviation of the route is obvious,
    and it will bring the vector deviation of the two directions of range and azimuth
    in the data processing. The GPS positioning system used on the UVA is not precision
    enough to carry out accurate positioning and measurement of such deviation. Thus,
    more accurate sensors for UAV motion track monitoring need to be added, and compensation
    algorithms based on this need to be designed to improve the imaging accuracy.
    Figure 9. The experimental results Show All SECTION V. Conclusion In this paper,
    an imaging system using UVA airborne microwave radar is designed and developed.
    The hardware part of the system includes the PTZ device, its control system, and
    the airborne core processor module. The PTZ device and its control system were
    designed for carrying microwave radar, and realizing the adaptive adjustment and
    maintenance of radar attitude through the real-time monitoring of radar pitch
    angle by the attitude acquisition module. Then, an airborne core processing module
    is developed to realize the communication, control and data transmission between
    radar, UAV and ground flight controller. At the same time, an imaging algorithm
    based on Range Doppler algorithm is constructed to process the echo signal received
    by microwave radar. Through analyzing the mathematical logic of the algorithm
    design and compiling the corresponding MATLAB programs, the imaging results of
    a single point target at a distance of 2m from the radar has been obtained, which
    proves the correctness of the algorithm. Finally, an experiment has been constructed
    to test the performance of the system for ground target recognition and imaging.
    In which, angle reflectors and aluminum spheres arranged at fixed positions have
    regarded as identification target. The results of simulation and actual experiments
    show that the system performs well in target detection and imaging, however, due
    to the difficulty of keeping a straight flight path when UAV flies at low altitude,
    the imaging results have a certain deviation, and the relative distance deviation
    is 9.6%. The GPS positioning system used on the UVA is not precision enough to
    carry out accurate positioning and measurement of such deviation. Thus, more accurate
    sensors for UAV motion track monitoring need to be added, and compensation algorithms
    based on this need to be designed to improve the imaging accuracy. In the subsequent
    research, we will be committed to further improving the performance of the system,
    compensating the flight path deviation of the UAV in real time, and improving
    the phase problem of the matching function in the range direction processing,
    so as to improve the target recognition accuracy. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research

  description: Improving the traction of an agricultural tractor on the field increases
    its working efficiency and capacity. Heavy work, like plowing, entails high levels
    of tire slip, which is directly related to power loss when the transmission of
    drawbar pull is required. Accordingly, it is possible to hypothesize that a tire
    with a higher traction capability could increase the working efficiency of the
    machine. The natural evolution for measuring the geometrical parameters of tires
    has led to the consideration of three-dimensional (3D) footprints since the distribution
    of the vertical stresses at the soil-tire interface may be highly non-uniform.
    In this study, the data acquired from 3D footprints of 10 sets of tires underwent
    processing along with the data from drawbar tests carried out with the same tires
    on soil terrain at different slip ratios. Subsequently, artificial intelligence
    multivariate methods based on artificial neural networks allowed traction prediction
    and verified the importance that the acquired geometrical parameters have on the
    measured drawbar pull. The study confirmed the correlation of the geometrical
    parameters of the 3D tire footprint with the drawbar pull and the results of the
    artificial intelligence modelling underlined the impact of these acquisitions.
    However, further work that considers various lug geometries is required to extend
    the generalizability of the studied methodology.

  description: 'The transmission of water through soil is one of the critical links
    to reflect the hydrological process. At present, there are controversies about
    the infiltration of farmland irrigation water and the replacement of old and new

    irrigation policy formulation. In this study, we monitored the temporal and spatial
    changes of stable isotopes of soil water in Minqin Oasis farmland, analyzed the
    infiltration process of irrigation water, used the MixSIAR isotope mixture model

    Get rights and content Highlights • Temporal and spatial changed of soil moisture
    caused by irrigation and evaporation. • The contribution time of irrigation water
    to the 20–60 cm soil layer was only 4 d. • Plastic film extended the contribution
    time of irrigation water to 0–20 cm soil layer. Abstract The transmission of water
    through soil is one of the critical links to reflect the hydrological process.
    At present, there are controversies about the infiltration of farmland irrigation
    water and the replacement of old and new water in arid areas, which significantly
    reduces the scientific nature of the irrigation policy formulation. In this study,
    we monitored the temporal and spatial changes of stable isotopes of soil water
    in Minqin Oasis farmland, analyzed the infiltration process of irrigation water,
    used the MixSIAR isotope mixture model to estimate the contribution of irrigation
    water to soil water and evaluated their effective contribution time to different
    soil layers. This study suggests that: The temporal and spatial changes in pore
    water isotope reflect the process of artificial irrigation and evaporation. Within
    5 days after irrigation, the average contribution rate of irrigation at 0–20 cm,
    20–60 cm, and 60–100 cm soil layers was 31.11 ± 17.74%, 19.17 ± 12.72%, and 31.56
    ± 12.42%, respectively. Under the influence of soil water content, topography,
    and plastic film cover, the effective contribution time of irrigation water to
    0–20 cm and 60–100 cm soil layers was more than 5 d, and the effective contribution
    time to the 60–100 cm soil layer is only 4 d. The research results will help understand
    the hydrological process of farmland in the arid oasis area and provide a scientific
    basis for improving agricultural irrigation mode, which will help realize the
    sustainable development of regional agriculture. Previous article in issue Next

    rateEffective contribution time 1. Introduction As an essential part of the hydrological
    cycle, shallow soil water is the primary water source for most plants (Pan et
    al., 2020) and a solvent for many nutrients (Gazis and Feng, 2004). In the ecosystem,
    whether it is natural precipitation or artificial irrigation water, it can only
    provide the water needed for crop growth after being converted into soil water
    (Yamanaka, 2004; Beyer and Dubbert, 2019). The replacement of old and new water
    caused by water infiltration has always been a hot topic in soil hydrology. In
    any soil hydrological system, plug and preferential flow are coexistent infiltration
    methods (Dusek et al., 2012). Under plug flow, the input water infiltrates along
    the hydraulic gradient, forcing the original soil pore water to flow downwards.
    In this process, new and old water is often mixed (Xiang et al., 2020). As a widespread
    form of water and solute transport in field soil, preferential flow exists widely
    throughout the soil layer. The preferential flow path is generally soil macropores
    caused by cracks, rotting plant roots, rocks, etc (Dusek et al., 2012, Gazis and
    Feng, 2004). At this time, a large amount of water input often causes solutes
    to quickly migrate down the preferential flow path, which may cause groundwater
    pollution (Klaus et al., 2013). In natural soil, soil macropores, soil structure,
    soil texture, soil water content, soil initial water content, the application
    rate of water and solute, and solute application method are important factors
    affecting water infiltration (Liu et al., 2015, Li et al., 2017, Li et al., 2017,
    Jačka et al., 2021). In contrast, farmland soil is more disturbed by human activities.
    Under the same irrigation system, irrigation and rainfall in film mulching treatment
    can only flow into corn growth porosity and the bare area between film mulching.
    At this time, the soil water potential under plastic film mulching is higher than
    that of no film mulching (Li et al., 2021, Sintim et al., 2021). So plastic film
    mulching was more likely to increase water leakage after irrigation. In addition,
    high-intensity artificial irrigation will inevitably lead to more preferential
    flows in arid oasis areas (Li et al., 2019, Li et al., 2019). The stable isotope
    has the functions of tracing, integrating, and indicating to the research object
    and can more accurately record the process information of infiltration, evaporation,
    transpiration, and mixing in various water bodies. It is a powerful tool for exploring
    hydrogeological processes and characteristics (Barnes and Allison, 1988; Zhu et
    al., 2019; Wenninger et al., 2010). Seasonal changes in precipitation isotopes
    are often used to track the seepage process of soil moisture (Koeniger et al.,
    2016). The high variability of the isotope signals of the soil profile and the
    seasonal absence of precipitation signals can identify preferential flows in the
    soil (Peralta‐Tapia et al., 2015), and the cyclic changes of isotope composition
    reflect the passage of new water to old water (Ma et al., 2017). Furthermore,
    the soil isotope profile can not only distinguish the replenishment ratio of preferential
    flow and plug flow (Xiang et al., 2019) but also can be used to track the contribution
    ratio of various water sources to soil moisture to determine the effective contribution
    time of different water sources to soil moisture (Liu et al., 2015). At present,
    stable isotopes are not only used in the hydrological analysis to obtain soil
    water infiltration process (Stumpp and Maloszewski, 2010), residence time (Liu
    et al., 2015), and update rate (Hu et al., 2015). It is also used to model preferential
    flow paths (Weiler and McDonnell, 2004) and soil water travel time (Sprenger et
    al., 2015, Sprenger et al., 2016b). In arid areas where water resources are extremely
    scarce, agricultural water resources are generally higher than 80% of the total
    water resources. Water shortage is the most important limiting factor for agriculture
    in arid regions (Wang et al., 2018). We monitored the soil moisture after each
    irrigation event in Minqin Oasis in 2019. To further understand the infiltration
    process and replenishment mechanism of irrigation water in the unsaturated zone
    of farmland soil in an arid oasis area, we proposed the following research goals:
    (i) The contribution and effective contribution time of irrigation water to the
    soil moisture of farmland; (ii) The infiltration of irrigation water in the soil
    reflected by the isotope of pore water. 2. Study sites 2.1. Overview of the study
    area Minqin Oasis (38°27′10″–39°06′53″N, 102°53′16″–103°49′00″E) is located in
    the eastern end of Hexi Corridor and the lower reaches of Shiyang River basin,
    surrounded by Badain Jaran Desert and Tenge Desert in the west, north, and east.
    Minqin Oasis is formed under Shiyang River''s nourishment, are 206 km east-west
    and 156 km north-south (Fig. 1). It is a typical continental climate, with intense
    solar radiation, long sunshine hours, and a large temperature difference between
    day and night, sparse precipitation (113.2 mm per year), and strong evaporation
    (2675.6 mm per year), which is one of the regions with the most severe water resources
    shortage and sand storm hazards in the world. The formation process of oasis soil
    was affected by parent material, and soluble salts accumulate. Natural soil includes
    gray-brown desert soil, aeolian sandy soil, saline soil, and meadow soil. Cultivated
    soil is mainly irrigated silt soil, which evolved under the effects of long-term
    cultivation, irrigation, and fertilization. The Minqin area has little precipitation,
    and surface water and groundwater are the keys to the oasis''s existence. The
    only external surface runoff is the Shiyang River, which originates from the Qilian
    Mountains, and its main replenishment sources are alpine snow meltwater and atmospheric
    precipitation. Download : Download high-res image (615KB) Download : Download

    experiment station is located in Beidong Village (38°47′29″N, 103°13′52″E), Datan
    Township in the middle of Minqin Oasis. The experiment field is 67 m long and
    26 m wide, surrounded by roads, irrigation canals, and ridges. The changes in
    temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, and irrigation volume during the
    experimental station''s growth period in 2019 are shown in Fig. 2. During the
    corn growing period, there were 6 irrigations in total. The irrigation water source
    was underground well water, and the irrigation mode was surface flooding. We used
    the HZQP-D IC card intelligent water distribution terminal to monitor the irrigation
    water volume during the irrigation process. The experiment field is covered with
    plastic film (width 115 cm, thickness 0.012 mm) at 40 cm intervals. The original
    width of the plastic film is 140 cm. We took approximately 12.5 cm from the left
    and right sides of the plastic film and bury it in the soil. Download : Download

    3.1. Sample collection This study collected soil water, rainwater, and irrigation
    water samples in the experimental field during the corn growing period from April
    to September 2019. 3.1.1. Sample collection Fresh soil samples in 0–5, 5–10, 10–20,
    20–30, 30–40, 40–50, 50–60, 60–70, 70–80, 80–90, 90–100 cm layers were drilled
    in the sample plot. The sampling location is covered by the film and located in
    the field ditches. During the observation period, there were 6 irrigations in
    total. Soil samples were collected intensively before and after irrigation, once
    before irrigation, and continuously for five days after irrigation. Four parallel
    samples were collected for each soil layer. Put three of them into a 50 mL glass
    bottle, sealed the bottle with Parafilm, wrote down the sampling date and depth
    on the bottle, and then frozen and stored until experimental isotope analysis.
    Put another parallel sample in an aluminum box and store it for soil moisture
    content determination. Immediately after each irrigation or precipitation event,
    irrigation water and rainwater samples were transferred to an 80 mL high-density
    polyethylene sample bottle, sealed with a Parafilm membrane, and then frozen and
    stored until the experimental analysis. 3.2. Sample analysis Sample analysis processing
    and determination were all completed in the isotope laboratory of the College
    of Geography and Environmental Science, Northwest Normal University. Water from
    the soil was extracted using an LI-2100 fully automated cryogenic vacuum extraction
    system. All water samples were analyzed using a DLT-100 liquid water isotope analyzer
    developed by Los Gatos Research, USA. During the analysis, each water sample and
    isotope standard sample was injected consecutively 6 times. In order to avoid
    the memory effect of isotope analysis, we discarded the values of the first two
    injections, and used the average value of the last four injections as the final
    value. The analysis is expressed as a thousandth of the Vienna Standard Mean Ocean
    Water (V-SMOW): (1) ‰ In the formula, Rsampleis the ratio of 18O/16O or 2H/1H
    in the sample. and Rstandard is the ratio of 18O/16O or 2H/1H in V-SMOW. The standard
    error of measurement is ± 0.6‰ for δ2H and ± 0.2‰ for δ18O, respectively. 3.3.
    Meteorological data The automatic weather station (WatchDog 2000 Series Weather
    Stations) set up near the sample site was used to obtain and record the local
    temperature and relative humidity and other meteorological data during the sampling
    period. 3.4. lc-excess The linear relationship between δ2H and δ18O in precipitation
    and soil water is defined as the LMWL (local meteoric water line) and SWL (soil
    waterline), respectively. The lc-excess in different water bodies can characterize
    the evaporation index of different water bodies relative to local precipitation
    (Landwehr and Coplen, 2006; Landwehr et al., 2014): (2) where a and b are the
    slope and intercept of LMWL, respectively, δ2H and δ18O are the hydrogen and oxygen
    isotope values in the sample. Based on the isotope analysis''s precision and the
    slope of the LMWL, the lc-excess of soil water and rainfall was derived, and their
    uncertainty was estimated to be ± 2.27‰. 3.5. MixSIAR model The MixSIAR isotope
    mixture model based on Bayesian theory was used to identify the water source of
    soil water and quantify the contribution ratio(f) of different water sources (Stock
    and Semmens, 2013). The Bayesian mixing models have advantages over simple linear
    mixing models in estimating probability distributions of source contributions,
    which combines multiple sources of uncertainty, isotopic characteristics, and
    isotopic fractionation. In this study, the underground water level is 26 m, far
    beyond the groundwater evaporation limit. In addition, the Minqin Oasis had very
    little rainwater, the strong surface evaporation made most of the rainwater evaporate
    quickly after falling on the surface of the mulch, and only a small amount of
    water entered the soil to mix with the original pore water. Therefore, groundwater
    and rainwater were not considered as the water source of soil water in this study.
    Soil water mainly comes from irrigation water, soil water in the previous layer,
    and early soil water. In the MixSIAR model, the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
    running step length was “very long,” and the model error was selected from “Process + residual.”.
    After running the MixSIAR, we conducted a check diagnostic according to Stock
    and Semmens (2013) for confirming the validity of the result (Stock and Semmens,
    2016). 4. Results 4.1. Temporal variation of soil water isotope in farmland During
    the 6 irrigation events, the average values of δ2H and δ18O of soil water were
    − 67.35 ± 5.90‰ (− 93.07‰ to − 54.73‰) and − 9.02 ± 1.06‰ (− 13.13‰ to − 5.19‰)
    (Table 1). The slope and intercept of SWL were smaller than LMWL, indicating that
    input water entered the soil and was affected by evaporation, making the soil
    water isotope enriched. Most of the soil water isotope values fell on the lower
    right of the irrigation water, confirming that artificial irrigation was the main
    source of soil water replenishment. The study compared 6 irrigation events with
    different input water volumes (I1 = 112 mm, I2 = 90.6 mm, I3 = 92.1 mm, I4 = 94.7 mm,
    I5 = 94.7 mm, I6 = 92.6 mm). According to Dunn’s test results, the soil isotope
    (2H and 18O) was significantly different from other irrigations after the fifth
    irrigation. There was little difference in the amount of input water during each
    irrigation process, and it had no obvious correlation with the isotope value.
    The amount of irrigation water didn''t affect the enrichment and depletion of
    the isotope value (Fig. 3a). Table 1. General characteristics of δ2H and δ18O

    in the dual-isotope map (a. 6 irrigation processes; b. different periods during
    the irrigation process) were represented by different symbols. According to the
    post-hoc Dunn test, the same letter indicates soil isotope data with no significant
    differences at the top of the box plot. The water in the soil pores underwent
    a renewal process before and after the irrigation event. We further compared the
    similarities and differences of soil isotope in the period before and after irrigation.
    The results showed that the soil water isotope values (2H and 18O) were significantly
    different between the 1–3 days after the irrigation water input and before the
    irrigation. By the fourth day, this difference ceased to exist. After irrigation,
    the input water was mixed with the original water in the soil pores, making the
    latter have the former''s isotopic characteristics and deplete, which is especially
    obvious in shallow soils. After the irrigation was completed, the dynamic fractionation
    of isotopes was caused by the soil pore water''s evaporation. The isotopic composition
    gradually returned to the state before irrigation after the fourth day (Fig. 3b).
    4.2. Spatial variation of soil water isotope We can observe clear signals of irrigation
    water input in the soil water isotope profile (Fig. 4). The arid environment caused
    fractionation of soil moisture that had not been input by precipitation or irrigation
    water. At that time, the isotope values in the topsoil pores were significantly
    enriched, and the SWlc-excess was still negative at 80 cm. After the irrigation
    start, the isotopes of irrigation water were significantly smaller than those
    of shallow soil water, so water infiltration and mixing depleted the surface soil
    water isotopes and weakened the evaporation signal. As the water continued to
    penetrate, the soil in the middle and lower parts was also affected. After we
    stop irrigation, the soil moisture penetrates the deep soil (60–100 cm), at this
    time, the evaporation effect is smaller, and the isotope value is more depleted.
    Due to the arid environment, the isotope fractionation of middle and upper soil
    water gradually appeared, and the light isotope fractionation in the surface soil
    water made heavy isotopes quickly enriched on the surface. As time went by, the
    fractionation signal (SWlc-excess) gradually went to the lower layer of soil,
    and the isotope value of soil pore water gradually returned to the level before
    irrigation. The change of GWC in soil pores is the most intuitive manifestation
    of water infiltration. When irrigation occurred, with water input, the GWC content''s
    growth in the gaps at different soil depths was different at different infiltration
    stages. The topsoil first received irrigation water and became moist. At that
    time, The change range of GWC would be reduced in each soil layer. When the water
    completely penetrated the underlying soil''s pores, the newly input water would
    mix with the original soil pore water, causing the GWC to reach the peak value.
    We could observe this phenomenon in every irrigation process. It often occurred
    on the second or third day after irrigation. After the GWC reached its peak, part
    of the water continued to infiltrate to cause deep leakage, and the other part
    of the water became vapor into the atmosphere due to evapotranspiration. Download

    soil profiles Based on changes in soil water isotope, we estimated the contribution
    of irrigation water to soil moisture five days after the event (Fig. 5). From
    one day to five days after the event, the average contribution f of irrigation
    water to soil water within 1 m was 33.98 ± 16.76%, 32.59 ± 8.71%, 34.29 ± 15.51%,
    19.93 ± 8.74%, and 13.86 ± 9.66%. To understand the migration of irrigation water
    in the soil layer more clearly, we divided the 1 m soil layer into 3 layers (shallow
    layer: 0–20 cm; middle layer: 20–60 cm; deep layer: 60–100 cm). On the first day
    after the irrigation event, the 0–20 cm soil layer reached the peak contribution
    (59.53 ± 3.73%). In the five consecutive days, the contribution f of irrigation
    water to the soil layer was greater than 10%. The 20–60 cm soil layer reached
    the peak contribution (34.25 ± 10.69%) on the second day after irrigation. From
    the fifth day, the contribution f of irrigation water to this layer of soil water
    was less than 10%. The peak contribution of irrigation water to the 60–100 cm
    soil layer appeared on the third day (50.55 ± 11.87%). Overall, within five days
    after irrigation, the average contribution rate of irrigation water to 0–20 cm,
    20–60 cm, and 60–100 cm soil layers is 31.11 ± 17.74%, 19.17 ± 12.72%, and 31.56 ± 12.42%,
    respectively. The contribution of irrigation water to 20–60 cm soil is relatively
    small. Download : Download high-res image (149KB) Download : Download full-size

    time of irrigation water to soil water 5.1.1. Effective contribution time of irrigation
    water Unlike natural soil, farmland is easily disturbed by human activities, such
    as farming and irrigation, altering the water supply to the soil. In this research,
    when the irrigation contribution rate is less than 5% in the model calculation
    on a certain day after irrigation, the contribution of this irrigation event disappears
    from the soil moisture. The time that irrigation water contributed to the different
    soil layers of agricultural land was different after the irrigation event. The
    average contribution of the 0–20 cm soil layer exceeded 10% on the fifth day after
    irrigation, which means that irrigation water''s contribution to soil water still
    existed after 5 d. The 20–60 cm soil layer''s contribution rate on the fifth day
    was less than 5%, and the effective contribution time of irrigation water to this
    layer of soil water was only 4 d. On the fifth day, the average contribution rate
    of the 60–100 cm soil layer was greater than that of the 0–20 cm and 20–60 cm
    soil layers. It is reasonable to believe that the contribution of irrigation water
    to the soil layer will continue and that the soil layer''s effective contribution
    time will be longer (Table 2). Table 2. Effective contribution time of irrigation

    contribution time of irrigation water The time during which irrigation water actually
    contributes is affected by natural conditions and human activities. Preferential
    flow is a common form of water and solute transportation in farmland soil, which
    changes the effective contribution of irrigation water to soil water by affecting
    the hydrological transport of soil water (Gazis and Feng, 2004). Our research
    was in an extremely arid environment, the average soil water content was much
    lower than the saturated water content, and excessive water input would cause
    the rapid movement of soil water (Padilla et al., 1999). Compared with the vertical
    push-type seepage method, the preferential flow of macropores quickly seeps through
    the soil matrix to the deep soil, shortening the contribution of input water to
    the middle and upper soil (although the effective contribution time of 0–20 cm
    soil layer irrigation water was more than 5 d, its contribution rate had become
    lower). The use of plastic film to cover the topsoil in arid areas allows for
    the purpose of cooling and hydration and interferes with water infiltration. On
    the one hand, after covering with mulch, irrigation water can only flow into corn
    growth porosity and the bare area between film mulching. At this time, the soil
    water potential under plastic film mulching is definitely higher than that of
    no film mulching (Li et al., 2021), so plastic film mulching was more likely to
    increase water leakage after irrigation. On the other hand, Plastic film may weaken
    the direct exchange between the soil and the atmosphere, thereby significantly
    reducing the evaporation of surface soil moisture (Yang et al., 2015). Water vapor
    that evaporates from the soil under the mulch will accumulate on the surface soil
    or adhere to the mulch, thereby increasing the moisture of the surface soil. This
    assists in increasing the effective duration of irrigation water on the surface
    soil. In the 60–100 cm soil layer, evaporation becomes weak, and the distribution
    of corn roots in this soil layer is also less, and it is not easy to form a large
    pore flow. In addition, the slop and softness of the terrain affected the contribution
    of the inlet water to the soil water. Studies found that the average residence
    time of soil water in a 1 m soil profile with a gentle catchment is 0.4–4 months,
    while the average residence time in a steep catchment area is only 4–27 d (McGuire
    et al., 2002). Our test field is located in a small oasis basin. Compared with
    sloping land, irrigation water will remain in the farmland after input, and it
    has not been easy to form runoff, which increases the replenishment time for shallow
    soil. 5.2. Migration of irrigation water in the soil Our research has revealed
    that soil water isotopes'' temporal and spatial changes in farmland are the result
    of the interaction between artificial irrigation and evaporation. Before irrigation,
    evaporation is the main driving force of soil moisture changes, and it is particularly
    evident in the topsoil (Sprenger et al., 2017, Gazis and Feng, 2004, Tang and
    Feng, 2001, Tian et al., 2002). After irrigation water enters the soil, the difference
    in the evaporation intensity of different soil layers, the push of plug flow to
    water, and the ubiquitous preferential flow in the soil are the main factors to
    explain the isotope changes of the soil profile (Renshaw et al., 2003, Kortelainen
    and Karhu, 2004). The difference in lc-excess between soil layers is a clear evaporation
    signal (Sprenger et al., 2016a, McCutcheon et al., 2017). The arid environment
    causes the topsoil isotope have strong evaporation signals and pushes the evaporation
    signals to move to the middle and lower soil layers. Before irrigation, the lc-excess
    of 0–5 cm soil water was the smallest (lc-excess < − 20‰), and the most concentrated
    evaporation. Overall, soil water isotope fractionation is relatively stable. After
    the irrigation water was input, the mixing of new water and old water caused the
    isotopes to be depleted quickly, thereby losing the fractionation signal and increasing
    the isotopic variability in the soil profile. In the irrigation process, plug
    flow and preferential flow coexisted, and the two interacted to complete the replacement
    of water (Fig. 6). Plug flow is the complete mixing of water with shallow free
    water after passing through the soil matrix. Under the action of plug flow, the
    input water infiltrates along the hydraulic gradient, pushing the original soil
    pore water to flow downward (Xiang et al., 2020, Gazis and Feng, 2004). In the
    preferential flow, the external input water rapidly enters the shallow soil through
    the large soil holes and forms deep leaks (Tang and Feng, 2001, Gazis and Feng,
    2004). In unsaturated soils, preferential flow dominates when the water content
    is low or non-existent (Padilla et al., 1999). The changes in soil water isotope
    in farmland correspond to irrigation, which further confirms that a part of irrigation
    water can penetrate the middle and lower part of soil quickly through preferential
    flow (Tian et al., 2002). As the main source of replenishment in our research,
    irrigation water could reach a soil layer less than 100 cm and effectively replace
    old water in the farmland soil. Download : Download high-res image (937KB) Download

    5.3. Enlightenment to farmland management strategies in arid areas The isotope
    method was used to analyze the migration and replenishment of irrigation water
    in the soil, and it was found that the infiltration depth of single irrigation
    water exceeds the depth of water absorption by crop roots in farmland in arid
    oasis areas (maximum maize root depth: seedling stage (20 cm); jointing period
    (40 cm); heading period (60 cm); Grouting period (80 cm); maturation period (90 cm)).
    Extensive irrigation mode (overflow irrigation) is inefficient, which causes the
    residual toxic and harmful substances in agricultural production to migrate with
    water to the deep soil, resulting in groundwater pollution (Li et al., 2017, Li
    et al., 2017, Zhao and Chang, 2014). A scientifically effective irrigation scheme
    should aim to replenish water deficits in the root zone while minimizing leaching
    in this depth (Zhang et al., 2014, Bourazanis et al., 2015). Therefore, the accurate
    assessment of soil moisture balance components (irrigation, drainage, and evapotranspiration)
    is essential to improve oasis farmland irrigation management strategies (Li et
    al., 2019, Li et al., 2019). The root system of corn is mostly distributed within
    60 cm, and under the traditional flood irrigation method, the effective contribution
    time of irrigation water to the middle and upper soil water is shorter. This will
    lead to a serious waste of agricultural water resources. The cost of a drip irrigation
    system is high, and when drip irrigation is performed on soil with high salt content,
    the salt will accumulate on the edge of the wet area. In the precipitation event,
    the salt will be washed into the root area of the crop without being diluted,
    which will damage the plant’s roots. Under film-mulched drip irrigation, which
    combines the advantages of drip irrigation technology and mulching technology,
    can effectively solve the above problems (Li et al., 2019, Li et al., 2019, Ning
    et al., 2021). Drip irrigation only wets the crop root development area, which
    is a form of local irrigation. Since the drip intensity is less than the soil''s
    infiltration rate, it will not form runoff to harden the soil. Under film-mulched
    drip irrigation has a small amount of drip water and can make the limited water
    in the soil circulate between the soil and the mulch, reducing the evaporation
    of crops. Covering with mulch can also turn small ineffective rainfall into effective
    rainfall and improve the utilization rate of natural rainfall.In addition, drip
    irrigation strips have replaced country water transport ditches, reducing evaporation
    and unnecessary leakage during water transport. Arid oasis is a unique ecosystem
    in a state of delicate ecological-hydrological balance (Liu et al., 2015). Based
    on ensuring food security, reducing water consumption to improve water resource
    utilization efficiency, and reducing groundwater pollution, formulating an effective
    irrigation plan is necessary for realizing regional sustainable agricultural development
    (Zhang al. et al., 2014). 6. Conclusion Our research monitored the dynamic changes
    of soil water isotope and its water content in the Minqin Oasis during the irrigation
    period, estimated the contribution rate of irrigation water to different soil
    layers for 5 days after irrigation, and discussed the effective contribution time
    and its influencing factors. In the farmland of Minqin Oasis, the contribution
    rate of irrigation water to different soil layers is different. Within 5 days
    after irrigation, the average contribution rate from irrigation at 0–20 cm, 20–60 cm,
    and 60–100 cm soil layers was 31.11 ± 17.74%, 19.17 ± 12.72%, and 31.56 ± 12.42%,
    respectively. Irrigation water contributes relatively light to the 20–60 cm soil
    layer. Soil water content, topography, and plastic film cover are important factors
    which affect the effective contribution time of irrigation water. The 0–20 cm
    soil layer peaks on the first day after irrigation, with an effective contribution
    time of more than 5 d. The 20–60 cm soil layer reached its peak on the second
    day after irrigation, and the effective contribution time was only 4 d. The peak
    of the contribution of irrigation water to the 60–100 cm soil layer appeared on
    the third day, and the effective contribution time was longer than that of the
    upper- middle layer. As the primary source of replenishment in our research, irrigation
    water could reach a soil layer less than 1 m and effectively replace the old water
    in the farmland soil. The research results will help understand the process of
    soil moisture infiltration and replenishment after irrigation of farmland in arid
    oasis areas, and provide a scientific basis for agricultural operators to plan
    irrigation schemes rationally. CRediT authorship contribution statement Guofeng

    Monte Carlo (MCMC) to incorporate fractionation parameters with a large number
    of observation data for a series of maximizations or simulations (Wu et al., 2019).

  description: Studies of microplastics (MPs) in remote, trans-boundary and alpine
    rivers are currently lacking. To understand the sinks and transport mechanisms
    of MPs, this study investigated the distributions and sources of MPs in the surface
    waters and sediments of five tributaries of the Koshi River (KR), a typical alpine
    river in the Himalayas between China and Nepal. Mean abundances of MPs in water
    and sediment were 202 ± 100 items/m3 and 58 ± 27 items/kg, dry weight, respectively.
    The upstream tributary, Pum Qu in China, had the smallest abundance of MPs, while
    the middle tributary, Sun Koshi in Nepal, had the greatest abundance. Compared
    to international values in rivers, contamination of the KR with MPs was low to
    moderate. Fibers represented 98% of all MP particles observed, which consisted
    of polyethylene, polyethyleneterephthalate, polyamide, polypropylene, and polystyrene.
    Blue and black MPs were prevalent, and small MPs (<1 mm) accounted for approximately
    60% of all MPs. Atmospheric transmission and deposition were considered to be
    the principal sources of MPs in the upstream tributary. The results imply that
    point sources associated with mostly untreated sewage effluents and solid wastes
    from households, major settlements, towns, and cities were most important sources
    of MPs in the KR. Non-point sources from agricultural runoff and atmospheric transport
    and deposition in the middle stream tributaries also contribute a part of microplastics,
    while the least amount was from fishing in the downstream tributary. Urbanization,
    agriculture, traffic, and tourism contributed to pollution in the KR by MPs. Equations
    to predict abundances of MPs based on river altitudes revealed that different
    trends were affected by both natural and human factors within the KR basin. This
    study presents new insights into the magnitude of MP pollution of a remote alpine
    river and provides valuable data for developing MP monitoring and mitigation strategies
    in similar environments worldwide.

    rights and content Highlights • The first report on microplastic (MP) pollution
    in the Koshi River, a remote, transboundary, alpine river in the Himalayas. •
    Globally, MPs in the water and sediments of the Koshi River corresponded to low
    to medium pollution levels. • MPs were PE, PET, PA, PP, and PS fibres with dominant
    sizes of 0.1–1 mm and black and blue colors. • Atmospheric transport and deposition,
    urbanization, agriculture, tourism, traffic, and fishing possibly caused MP hotspots.

    Plastic debrisRemote areaMountainFreshwaterSediment 1. Introduction Microplastics
    (MPs) (<5 mm in size) (Thompson, 2014) are continually increasing in environments
    due to improper use and disposal of plastic products (Jambeck et al., 2015; Rochman,
    2018). MPs have been found in freshwater systems, including remote lakes and mountain
    catchments worldwide (Allen et al., 2019; Evangeliou et al., 2020; Feng et al.,
    2020; Jiang et al., 2019; Lebreton et al., 2017; Schmidt et al., 2017; Xiong et
    al., 2018). As a global issue, contamination of freshwater systems by MPs has
    raised increasing concern from scientists, policymakers and the public (Blettler
    et al., 2018; Eerkes-Medrano et al., 2015; Lebreton et al., 2017; Rochman, 2018;
    Yang et al., 2021a). Large abundances of MPs have been reported in down-stream
    reaches of large rivers, such as the Yangtze, Pearl, and Yellow in China (Fu and
    Wang, 2019; Li et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018). Moreover,
    recently, MPs have been detected in upper reaches of these rivers, which are largely
    considered to be remote, sparsely populated, and pristine (Feng et al., 2020,
    2021; Jiang et al., 2019). The Himalayas, on the southwest edge of the Tibetan
    Plateau, are rich in glaciers and snow meltwater, and are headstream regions for
    several large rivers, such as the Yangtze in China, Koshi in Nepal and Ganges
    in India. Thus, the Himalayas are known as the “Asian Water Towers” that support
    diverse ecosystems and more than one billion people (Immerzeel et al., 2020; Kang
    et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020). Due to absence of effective prevention and control
    measures of plastic wastes in these remote areas (Jiang et al., 2019; Lusher et
    al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016; Zheng et al., 2020), MPs have been introduced into
    vulnerable and sensitive ecosystems (Zhang et al., 2019, 2021). Riverine input
    is assumed to contribute to abundances of MPs in remote areas on the Tibetan Plateau
    (Jiang et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2016), where MPs in alpine rivers might have
    unique characteristics and transfer mechanisms. However, little is known about
    MPs in these remote Himalayan rivers. The Koshi River (KR) is a typical remote,
    alpine, and trans-boundary river, and the Koshi River Basin (KRB) is rich in biodiversity
    and value of ecosystem services, supporting millions of people, economic development,
    and natural ecosystems for China, Nepal, and India. The KR is closely linked with
    well-being of people in China and South Asia (Wu et al., 2017). In recent years,
    the KR ecosystems have faced increasing pressures because of local natural and
    geographical conditions, demographic growth, and urbanization (Zhang et al., 2013).
    Due to poor management of domestic sewage effluents and solid wastes within the
    KRB (Manfredi et al., 2010), the river is affected by poor water quality (Wu et
    al., 2017). Due to atmospheric pollution and monsoons in South Asia and dry and
    wet deposition in the Himalayas (Tripathee et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2020), light-weight
    MPs can be found in remote alpine rivers and then transported long distances along
    steep river course gradients (Feng et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2019; Zhang et
    al., 2021) before finally entering the Indian Ocean. Therefore, the sources, pathways,
    and destinations of MPs in the KR is of international importance (Allen et al.,
    2019; Evangeliou et al., 2020; Lusher et al., 2015). Determining magnitudes of
    pollution in surface waters and sediments of the KR by MPs was considered to be
    essential. Amount of MPs in water can be used to determine the current status
    of pollution with MPs, while that in sediment can be used to demonstrate the longer-term,
    integrative record of MP pollution. Goals of this study were to: 1) determine
    abundances and characteristics, such as size, color, shape, and polymer type of
    MPs in waters and sediments of main tributaries of the KR; 2) reveal distribution
    and transport of MPs in this alpine river system; 3) identify possible sources
    of MPs and explore effects of natural and anthropogenic factors on MPs in remote
    alpine rivers. Results of this study will improve our understanding of MPs in
    a trans-Himalayan river, provide guidance for future monitoring and risk assessment
    of MP pollution, and subsequently assist in the formulation of policies for protecting
    remote alpine rivers worldwide. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study area The KR
    originates on the northern slope of the Himalayas in China, passes through the
    Himalayas to south of Nepal, merges with the Ganges River in India, and finally
    empties into the Indian Ocean. This study, focused on a section of the river that
    crosses a range of altitudes from 4653 m above sea level (m.a.s.l.) in China to
    95 m. a.s.l. in Nepal (Fig. 1). The studied area covers 28,300 km2 in China and
    39,407 km2 in Nepal. The KR drains from north to south, and the climate changes
    from cold to tropical. Most rainfall occurs between June and September during
    the summer monsoon. Due to the varying climate and topography, rainfall is unevenly
    distributed. The southern part of the basin is on average wetter than the northern
    part. Mean discharge of the river is 1564 m3/s (Chinnasamy et al., 2015). Mean
    annual temperatures range from −5 to 30 °C (Li et al., 2020). The Pum Qu is an
    important upstream tributary of the KR in China. Four other major tributaries
    include the middle streams Sun Koshi, Arun, and Tamor and the downstream Sapta
    Koshi in Nepal. The Sun Koshi, Arun, and Tamor tributaries merge with the Sapta
    Koshi tributary at Dhankuta in Nepal. Natural environment and land use within
    the KRB vary significantly from upstream north to downstream south. Upper reaches
    of the KRB are dominated by snow, ice, grassland, and a virtual lack of urban
    or industrial activities. Middle reaches in Nepal are characterized by hills and
    hilltop basins with cultivation, forestry, and tourism. Down-stream reaches are
    affected by the South Asian monsoon and provide abundant land for agriculture
    and large towns (Fig. 1A). Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download :

    distributions of microplastic abundances in surface waters and sediments (B) within
    the Koshi River catchment in China and Nepal. 2.2. Sampling Based on natural characteristics,
    land use types, and human activities within the KRB, 13 representative sampling
    sites were selected along five principal tributaries (Fig. 1A). Two, three, three,
    three, and two sites were located on the Pum Qu (S1–S2), Arun (S3–S5), Sunkoshi
    (S6–S8), Tamor (S9–S11), and Sapta Koshi (S12–S13) tributaries, respectively.
    Surface water and sediment samples were collected during May and July 2018. Eight
    sub-samples were collected at each sampling site from surface waters of 0–20 cm
    in depth along both banks of the river using a 5 L water sampler (a total volume
    of 40 L), and filtered through a 100 μm stainless-steel sieve. Sieved contents
    were carefully washed with filtered pure water (through a Whatman GF/B glass microfiber
    filter with a pore size of 0.45 μm) into a clean 50 mL glass bottle and fixed
    in 5% formalin at 4 °C. Eight sub-samples of 1 kg surface sediment were collected
    at each sampling site from upper 0–10 cm of the river bottom using a stainless-steel
    shovel, and then thoroughly mixed. Only 1 kg of the mixed sediment sample was
    kept at each site, stored in a clean aluminum box, and preserved at 4 °C. Before
    analysis, sediment was dried for 72 h, to a constant mass in an oven at 50 °C
    (Zobkov and Esiukova, 2017). 2.3. MP extraction Water and sediment samples were
    prepared, with slight adjustments, by use of previously described methods (Masura
    et al., 2015; Zobkov and Esiukova, 2017). Water samples were incubated at 75 °C
    with 10 mL of 30% H2O2 for 12 h to degrade organic matter, then filtered through
    a gridded 0.45 μm filter (Whatman GF/B glass microfiber, 47 mm diameter) under
    vacuum. The filters were stored in covered glass dishes and air dried for further
    analysis. MPs were then extracted from each sample of sediment by use of density
    separation. Each sample was divided into three glass beakers for replicate analysis.
    ZnCl2 solution (ρ = 1.6 g/mL) was used to isolate MPs from water and sediment
    (Xu et al., 2020). In each glass beaker, 200 g of dry sediment was mixed with
    300 mL of ZnCl2 solution and stirred with a magnetic stirrer for 30 min. After
    4 h of settling, the solution above the sediment layer was carefully transferred
    to another glass beaker. This isolation procedure was repeated three times for
    each glass beaker to increase rates of recovery of MPs. Subsequently, 20 mL of
    30% hydrogen peroxide and Fe (II) solution (catalyst) was added to degrade organic
    matter (Rodrigues et al., 2018). After 24 h of sedimentation, the supernatant
    was filtered through a Whatman GF/B glass microfiber filter (pore size 0.45 μm)
    under vacuum. Filters were placed into covered glass dishes and dried in air for
    microscopic inspection. 2.4. Observation and identification of MPs MPs were observed
    under a stereo-microscope (NIKON SMZ800N, Japan) equipped with an Olympus digital
    camera (DP26, Tokyo, Japan). Physical properties (texture, flexibility, color,
    and structure) of MPs were primarily determined based on the standards used by
    MERI (2012) and Hidalgo-Ruz et al. (2012). Color, size, and shape of each MP particle
    in each sample were recorded. Except for those that are too small to move (<100
    μm), 100 suspected MP particles (approximately more than 70% of total suspected
    MP particles) representing the most common colors, sizes, and shapes of MPs in
    the water and sediment samples were selected respectiverly, and transferred to
    glass slides for analysis of polymer types by μ-FTIR (Thermo Fisher Nicolet™ iN™10).
    The transmittance mode for the Nicolet™ iN™10 and ATR (attenuated total reflection)
    mode for LUMOS were chosen to acquire spectra. To precisely identify polymer types,
    the match factor threshold was calculated as 0.70 (Klein et al., 2015; Peng et
    al., 2018). 2.5. Quality assurance and control Strict control measures were employed
    during sample collection and laboratory analyses to prevent contamination from
    plastic products. In laboratory, cotton lab-coats, cotton masks, and powder-free
    latex gloves were worn during experimental processes. All liquids used in experiments
    were filtered through a glass fiber filter (0.45 μm, GF/F, Whatman) before use.
    Tools were washed with filtered ultrapure water. Procedural blanks were used to
    check for background contamination from laboratory sources via air, clothes, sampling
    tools, and vessels (Vaughan et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2016). Less than two fibers
    were found in the blank laboratory samples, which were subsequently conﬁrmed as
    cotton. 2.6. Statistical analysis A Pearson Product Moment Correlation analysis
    was conducted to investigate the relationship between MP abundances in surface
    water and sediment. Trinomial and exponential regression analyses were conducted
    to test changes in MP abundances in water and sediment samples at different river
    altitudes. A one-way ANOVA was used to determine differences in MP abundance among
    different sampling sites and tributaries. Statistical analyses were conducted
    using SPSS 19 (SPAS, IBM., USA) and considered statistically significant at p
    < 0.05. Variability was described by use of the standard deviation (SD). ArcGIS
    (10.0, Esri, USA) was used to describe geographic locations. 3. Results and discussion
    3.1. Abundance of MPs in the Koshi River MPs were detected in surface water and
    sediment throughout the KR, indicating extensive dispersion and pollution (Table
    1). Abundances of MPs in water varied from 50 ± 11 to 325 ± 35 (mean ± SD, n =
    3) items/m3, with a total mean of 202 ± 100 items/m3 (n = 13). Abundances of MPs
    in sediment ranged from 15 ± 3 to 120 ± 23 (n = 3) items/kg, dw, with a total
    mean of 58 ± 27 items/kg, dw (n = 13). The overall variation in MP abundance was
    relatively low across the KR, spanning roughly an order of magnitude in water
    and sediment. Table 1. Mean ± standard deviation (minimum–maximum) of microplastic

    the lack of standardized sampling, analytical protocols and uniform units, comparing
    pollution of rivers by MPs worldwide remains challenging (Hidalgo-Ruz et al.,
    2012; Hoellein et al., 2014). Studies selected for an international comparison
    was restricted to those that reported measurements as number of items per water
    volume and per dry sediment weight. Among 47 documents on MPs in river waters
    worldwide (Table S1), 68% of the documents (32) reported that means or ranges
    of abundance of MPs in water are greater than that in the present study, while
    among 41 documents on MPs in river sediments worldwide (Table S2), 88% of the
    documents (36) reported that means or ranges of abundance of MPs in sediment are
    greater than that in the present study. Therefore, MP pollution in the Koshi River
    could be considered to be at low to medium level, compared to that reported in
    other rivers. Furthermore, we made a comparison with studies that used the same
    bulk sampling method (collecting MPs in water with a 100 μm sieve) as the one
    in the present study, and found that the mean MP abundance in waters of the KR
    was similar to that of the Ottawa River (Vermaire et al., 2017), but much less
    than those of rivers on the Tibetan Plateau (Feng et al., 2020; Jiang et al.,
    2019) and the Gallatin (Barrows et al., 2018), Snake, and Lower Columbia rivers
    in the USA (Kapp and Yeatman, 2018). Some characteristics, including altitude-related
    topography, climate, hydrology, hydrodynamics, land use, population density and
    socio-economic status in our study, which were different from those in other studies,
    were signiﬁcant factors leading to lesser pollution of the waters of the KR by
    MPs. There were fewer MPs in sediment samples than in water samples in the present
    study. This result agrees with those of Deng et al. (2020), Scherer et al. (2020),
    and Yuan et al. (2019), but differs from those of McCormick et al. (2016) and
    Watkins et al. (2019). Strong hydrodynamic forces can move MPs that settle on
    riverbeds (Rodrigues et al., 2018; Yin et al., 2020). Additionally, less biofilm
    on MPs (i.e. MP properties and water quality), large hydrological variations (such
    as rainfall and storms), geomorphology (such as altitude and location within the
    river network including headwater streams and large rivers) could be responsible
    for the lesser total mean abundance in sediments. Due to relatively steep topography,
    more rapid flow velocity can scour MPs from sediments and move them down-stream
    of the KRB. Thus, fewer MPs in sediment samples than in water samples indicated
    that the sediments are not only a temporal sink of MPs, but a transport conduit
    of MPs (Klein et al., 2015). These results agree with those reported for 29 Japanese
    rivers (Kataoka et al., 2019), the Pearl River catchment, China (Fan et al., 2019;
    Li et al., 2018), and the Snake and Lower Columbia rivers, USA (Kapp and Yeatman,
    2018). 3.2. Physical characteristics of MPs in the Koshi River Fibers accounted
    for 98 and 95% of MPs in water and sediments respectively (Fig. 2A). Similarly,
    fibers comprised 91% of the total MPs in surface water samples collected from
    the Ganges, India (Napper et al., 2021), 95% from the Ottawa River, Canada (Vermaire
    et al., 2017) and 100% from the Seine River, France (Dris et al., 2015; Dris et
    al., 2018) (Table S1). However, relative abundances of fibers in this study were
    significantly greater than those in the rivers on the Tibetan Plateau, China (Feng
    et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2019) and in Ganges River, India (Napper et al., 2021;
    Sarkar et al., 2019; Singh et al., 2021), where are in close proximity to the
    KR. Fibers are ubiquitously present in most river waters irrespective of the proximity
    to Urban agglomerations (Table S1); they are likely carried by the wind and enter
    freshwater primarily via air movement and rainfall (Kaliszewicz et al., 2020).
    Fibers are mainly derived from production, washing, and natural aging of textiles
    (Yang et al., 2021a). Domestic laundry discharges, solid wastes, and atmospheric
    fallout indoor and outdoor may be major sources of fibers for the KR (Dris et
    al., 2017, 2018). Insufficient collection and treatment systems for domestic sewage
    effluents and solid wastes in the studied area should be responsible for great
    abundances of fiber in the KR. Scarcity of pellets in the waters and sediments
    (Fig. 2A) could be explained by the small number of cosmetic, detergent, and personal
    care product (facial cleansers) (Napper and Thompson, 2016) and industrial plastic
    sources (Hidalgo-Ruz et al., 2012; Shruti et al., 2019) within the KRB, owing
    to the poor economic conditions (Manfredi et al., 2010). The less fragmented MPs
    in the sediments indicate that degradation and decomposition of larger household
    plastic products (Eo et al., 2019) does not play an important role in MP pollution
    in the KR. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size

    colour (C), and polymer type (D) for water and sediment samples collected from
    the Koshi River. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure
    legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.) The surface
    waters and sediments of the KR were dominated by small MPs (0.1–1 mm) which accounted
    for approximately 60% of the total MPs (Fig. 2B). The relative abundance of small
    MPs in water was lower than those of most rivers worldwide but comparable to those
    in the Yangtze (Wang et al., 2017), Hanjiang (Tan et al., 2019), Pearl (Yan et
    al., 2019), and Yongjiang rivers (Zhang et al., 2020b) (Table S1). Relative abundances
    of large-sized MPs (2–5 mm) observed in the waters and sediments of the KR were
    low compared to other rivers (Fig. 2B and Table S1). As MP sizes increased, their
    relative abundances in water and sediment decreased. The reason may be that strong
    variations in rainfall, flooding, water flow, storm, light, temperature, snow,
    landslide, and debris flow within the KRB (Sinha et al., 2019) act on large sized
    dominant fibers and break them down to a greater number of small sized ones. Napper
    et al. (2021) collected a less volume of water sample (30 L) at each site from
    the Ganges, India and filtered through a larger seive (333 μm) than we did from
    the KR (a 40 L water sample through a 100 μm seive). The mean abundance of MPs
    in waters of the KR was greater than that of the Ganges, India (38 items/m3),
    while the mean size of MPs (dominant in 0.1–1 mm) in waters of the KR was less
    than that of the Ganges, Indian (2.459 ± 0.209 mm), indicating that differences
    in filtration have a substantial effect on estimating concentration of MPs in
    water. Blue was the dominant color, accounting for 20–100% of the total number
    of MPs in surface waters of the KR, whereas blue and black were prevalent colors
    comprising 25–60% and 5–100% of the total MPs in the sediments, respectively.
    Most (98%) MPs in the waters and sediments were colorful (primarily blue, black,
    and red) (Fig. 2C). The Pum Qu tributary in China had only black and blue MPs,
    whereas the other tributaries in Nepal contained more than three colors (mainly
    blue, black, and red). The dominant colors found in the present study are somewhat
    different from those in rivers on the Tibetan Plateau (Feng et al., 2020; Jiang
    et al., 2019) and the Manas River in the Tianshan Mountains, China (Wang et al.,
    2020) (Table S1 and Table S2). This indicates different sources of MPs in these
    remote alpine rivers. However, in addition to the daily use of colored plastic
    products, such as clothing and packaging (Di and Wang, 2018), weathering caused
    by variations in temperature, light, and rainfall in the Himalayan regions (Li
    et al., 2020) can result in colored plastic particles. 3.3. Chemical components
    of MPs in surface water and sediment samples of the Koshi River Polyethylene (PE)
    and polypropylene (PP) were the dominant polymer types, accounting for 38% and
    30% of the total MPs in water, respectively (Fig. 2D). This prevalence could be
    attributed to their densities of less than 1.0 g/mL (Klein et al., 2015; Koelmans
    et al., 2019; Sathish et al., 2019; Su et al., 2016), their extensive manufacture
    in China and export to Nepal. PE and PP are the most abundant polymer types in
    other riverine waters (Table S1). PE and PP are susceptible to photo-oxidation
    by strong ultraviolet radiation (Rodrigues et al., 2018; Song et al., 2017), and
    they can also be degradated due to abrasion and aging (Zhang et al., 2020a) caused
    by climate and hydrodynamic variations within the KRB (Li et al., 2020), especially
    on the Tibetan Plateau (Jiang et al., 2019; Nel et al., 2018). Relative abundances
    of polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) and polystyrene (PS) detected in the waters
    of the KR were less than those found in riverine waters on the Tibetan Plateau
    (Jiang et al., 2019). The greater flow rates and lower water levels in the Himalayas
    may produce sufficient turbulence to mix surface water and sediment. Consequently,
    denser polymer types such as PET and PS could re-suspended in the water. In sediments,
    PE was the most dominant polymer type, with a relative abundance of 44.26%, followed
    by polyamide (PA (nylon), 32.79%), PET (16.39%), and PS (6.56%) (Fig. 2D). Only
    the Brisbane River in Australia has a similar polymer composition, which is completely
    different from that in most rivers worldwide (He et al., 2020) (Table S2). Despite
    having a density less than that of freshwater, because of its complex interactions
    with aquatic environments and organisms (Cole et al., 2013; Eo et al., 2019; Zhu
    et al., 2020), PE can settle into sediments (Klein et al., 2015; Sathish et al.,
    2019; Su et al., 2016). PA, PET, and PS have densities greater than that of freshwater
    (Koelmans et al., 2019). However, PET and PA were detected in surface waters of
    the KR, indicating that they have complex interactions with water and sediment
    in alpine river (Li et al., 2019). Lower relative abundances of PS in both water
    (10%) and sediment (6.56%) from the KR (Fig. 2D) might have been caused by its
    less frequent usage and different transport mechanisms in the river system (Klein
    et al., 2015). The principal polymers in the waters and sediments of the KR had
    typical shapes, colors, and FTIR spectra (Fig. S1). A stereo-microscope showed
    that all fibres were long and thin, black or blue. The FTIR spectra of PE, PP,
    PA, and PET were all within typical ranges. 3.4. Spatial distribution and potential
    sources of MPs in the Koshi River There were significant differences in mean abundance
    of MPs in surface water among different tributaries of the KR (p < 0.05) (Table
    1). The Sun Koshi tributary had the greatest mean abundance (308 ± 14 items/m3),
    followed by the Tamor (233 ± 38 items/m3), Sapta Koshi (225 ± 141 items/m3), Arun
    (142 ± 63 items/m3), and Pum Qu (63 ± 18 items/m3) tributaries (p < 0.05). Except
    for that significant differences in mean MP abundance were not observed in the
    sediments of the Sun Koshi and Tamor tributaries (p > 0.05), there were significant
    differences in mean abundance of MPs in sediment among the other tributaries (p
    < 0.05). The total mean MP abundances in surface water and sediment were greater
    in Nepal than in China (p < 0.05) (Table 1). Lower abundances of MPs were found
    in the waters and sediments of the Pum Qu, China (S1–S2) (Table 1 and Fig. 1B),
    which is characterized by many glaciers, cold, strong sunlight (UV radiation)
    (Chen et al., 2020), semi-arid, sparse population and higher altitude (∼4000–8800
    m. a.s.l) (Figs. 1 and 3A). This result confirms ubiquitous diffusion of MPs in
    the remote Himalayas. Some MPs were detected in high-altitude glaciers on the
    Tibetan Plateau, where is to >100 km far away from multiple South and East Asia
    cities and industrialized areas (Zhang et al., 2019, 2021) and in snow from Apls
    to the Arctic (Bergmann et al., 2019). Atmospheric transmission and deposition
    may be local and distant sources of small MPs in remote areas (Allen et al., 2019;
    Brahney et al., 2020; Carr, 2017; Dris et al., 2015; Evangeliou et al., 2020;
    Gonzalez-Pleiter et al., 2020). It was reported that surface road dust in Kathmandu,
    capital of Nepal, contained 12.5 ± 10.1 items/m2 of MPs comprising 15 polymer
    types (Yukioka et al., 2020). These findings suggest that airborne MPs in South
    and East Asia countries may be potential sources of MPs in the Pum Qu. Download

    Spatial distributions of population densities and roads (A), and regression of
    microplastic abundances against altitude in the Koshi River (Blue solid circles
    represent the water samples, and black hollow circles represent the sediment samples)
    (B). (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the
    reader is referred to the Web version of this article.) In the Arun tributary,
    abundances of MPs in water increased from up-stream to down-stream sites especially
    at S4 where approached a major settlement, Chainpur (Paudel et al., 2016a), while
    the abundances in sediment decreased correspondingly (Table 1 and Fig. 1B). Based
    on land use and population density within the Arun catchment (Figs. 1A and 3A),
    the dominant shapes (fiber), sizes (<1 mm), and colors (black and blue) of MPs
    in water and sediment at sites S3–S5 (Fig. 2), as well as possible sources of
    MPs in remote or natural or semi-natural mountain areas (Allen et al., 2019; Barrows
    et al., 2018; Baldwin et al., 2020; Feng et al., 2020; Kapp and Yeatman, 2018;
    Wang et al., 2020), it can be deduced that less domestic sewage and anthropogenic
    litter from forest, pasture, and agriculture, as well as atmospheric transport
    and deposition may be potential sources of MPs in the Arun. This conclusion is
    supported by the facts that the Arun catchment is free from sewage inputs and
    dominated by natural broadleaved forests with rough pasture (Juttner et al., 1996)
    and had the smallest areas of crop land (14.64% of total cropland within the KRB)
    (Paudel et al., 2016a). Therefore, the Arun might be used as semi-natural references
    of MPs for the KR. In the Sun Koshi tributary, abundances of MPs in water did
    not change from up-stream (S6 in the sub-tributary Bhote Koshi) to down-stream
    (S8) sites, with the exception of a relatively large abundance found at middle
    stream site (S7), which is located close to Kathmandu (Table 1 and Fig. 1B). However,
    abundances in sediment varied greatly from the middle stream (S7) to down-stream
    (S8) sites. Compared with the other tributaries in the KR, the Sun Koshi was heavily
    polluted by MPs in the waters and sediments. The potential non-point sources of
    MPs in the Sun Koshi are urban and rural roads (Bondelind et al., 2020; Rodland
    et al., 2020), especially in Kathmandu (Yukioka et al., 2020) and busy Sino-Nepalese
    Highway approaching S6 (Fig. 1B), as well as agriculture practices (Kurmar et
    al., 2020) (the area of cropland within the Sun Koshi catchment accounts for 62%
    of the total cropland area within the KRB) (Paudel et al., 2016a). In addition,
    potential point sources of MPs in the Sun Koshi are large amounts of untreated
    domestic sewage effluents (Amrutha et al., 2020; Napper et al., 2021; Sarkar et
    al., 2019; Singh et al., 2021) from some major settlements, such as Tatopani in
    Nepal and Zhangmu in China in upstream area (Khanal et al., 2015) and partly treated
    sewage effluents and sludge from waste water treatment plants (WWTPs), industries
    (clothing and carpet factories) and hospitals (Bhatt et al., 2014; Kannel et al.,
    2007; MOPE, 2000), and plastic wastes (accounting for 16.31% of municipal solid
    waste) from landfills and open dumping sites in Kathmandu (Gurung and Oh, 2012;
    Pokhrel and Viraraghavan, 2005) and medium cities like Ramechhap and towns near
    S8 (Paudel et al., 2016a), and tourism sites (plastic wastes accounted for 7%
    of the total solid waste collected in a national park) (Feng et al., 2020, 2021;
    Manfredi et al., 2010) (Fig. 1). Furthermore, a combination of diverse sizes and
    colors of MPs in water and sediment at sites S6–8 (Fig. 2) with land use, road
    and population density (Figs. 1 and 3A) confirms the potential sources of MPs
    in the Sun Koshi. Therefore, the Sun Koshi may demonstrate effects of the point
    and non-point sources of MPs on the KR. In the Tamor tributary, with the exception
    of relatively high abundance of MPs in the water at site S10, which was located
    adjacent to a small city, Taplejung (Paudel et al., 2016a), the abundance of MPs
    in water varied a little bit from 200 ± 21 to 225 ± 24 items/m3 at other sites.
    The MP abundance in sediment increased from 60 ± 11 items/kg, dw at upstream site
    S9 to 80 ± 13 items/kg, dw at downstream site S11. Bothe the waters and sediments
    were moderately polluted with MPs (Table 1). Based on relatively large area of
    crop land within the Tamor catchment (23.03% of the total crop land area within
    the KRB), expansion of agricultural land, intensive livestock grazing, sparse
    forest cover, few small cities (such as Taplejung and Phidim) (Paudel et al.,
    2016a) with moderate population density (0–200 inhabitants/km2) (Fig. 3A), as
    well as possible sources of MPs in similar rivers (Amrutha and Warrier, 2020;
    Feng et al., 2020. 2021; Jiang et al., 2019; Napper et al., 2021; Singh et al.,
    2021) and agricultural soils (Kumar et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2021b), we can
    judge that besides some point sources from few small cities, non-point sources
    from agricultural runoff and atmospheric deposition may be potential main sources
    of MPs in the Tamor. Therefore, the Tamor may display effects of the non-point
    sources of MPs on the KR. Abundances of MPs in water and sediment were relatively
    high at S12, where three tributaries (the Sun Koshi, Arun and Tamor) merge into
    the Sapta Koshi tributary, and then decreased at downstream site (S13) of the
    Sapta Koshi (Table 1 and Fig. 3A). The potential point sources of MPs in the Sapta
    Koshi are densely populated medium-size cities, such as Rampur, Thokshila, and
    Bharaul, which had no WWTPs and sanitary disposal facilities (Pokhrel and Viraraghavan,
    2005; Gurung and Oh, 2012), and potential non-points sources are agriculture and
    atmospheric deposition. Another potential point source is fishing (Dowarah and
    Devipriya, 2019; Ranjani et al., 2021) in the Sapta Koshi, which is the primary
    form of income for 79% of people in this region (Paudel et al., 2016b). Thusly,
    the Sapta Koshi may stand for collective characteristics of MPs in the KR before
    it leaves Nepal. A trinomial regression of MP abundances in water against river
    altitudes suggests that altitude explains the abundance variability well (R2 =
    0.62, p < 0.05) (Fig. 3B). Thus, the MP abundances in water increased with increasing
    altitudes at ≤1240 m. a.s.l, but decreased with increasing altitudes at >1240
    m. a.s.l. We conduncted an exponential regression analysis and found a significant
    correlation between the MP abundances in sediment and river altitudes (R2 = 0.72,
    p < 0.05) (Fig. 3B). The MP abundances in sediment exponentially decreased with
    increasing altitudes. The trends of MP abundances in the KR reflect effects of
    altitude-related natural and human factors on the alpine river environment. Furthermore,
    trend of rainfall within the KRB (Sinha et al., 2019) is in agreement with our
    modelling trend of MP abundances in water against the river altitudes. It indicates
    that altitude-related rainfall especially flooding plays an important role for
    altitude related distribution of MPs in alpine river. Interestingly, the majority
    of the cropland was within 600–1500 m. a.s.l (Paudel et al., 2016a), while most
    urban areas within the KRB are also located at this range of altitudes. This may
    partly explain the modeled peak abundance in water at the altitude of 1240 m.
    a.s.l. in terms of human factors. Sediments driven by rainfall especially flooding
    can transport together with MPs from the hinterland and deposit downstream (Hurley
    et al., 2018) because of a major topographic break, drastically reducing the slope
    within the KRB (Sinha et al., 2019). Thus, deposition of MPs in sediment is inversely
    proportional to altitude. 4. Conclusions This study presents data on MP pollution
    throughout a remote alpine river, the KR in the Himalayas, which flows from the
    Tibetan Plateau, China to Nepal. The mean MP abundances in water and sediment
    were 202 ± 22 items/m3 and 58 ± 10 items/kg, dw, respectively. Therefore, alpine
    riverine sediments are not only a temporal sink of MPs, but a transport conduit
    of MPs. In global perspective, MP pollution in the KR was at lower to medium level.
    Black and blue microfibers were ubiquitous across the KR. Small MPs (<1 mm) accounted
    for approximately 60% of the total MPs. PE, PET, PA, PP and PS were all the detected
    polymer types. The least abundances in the upstream tributary can be explained
    by air transport and deposition of MPs, and the greater abundances of MPs in the
    middle and downstream tributaries are mostly derived from point sources (sewage
    effluents and solid wastes from urbanization, traffic, tourism, and a minor contribution
    from fishing) and partly by non-point sources (agricultural runoff, atmospheric
    transport and deposition). The different trends relating MP abundances in water
    and sediment with river altitudes demonstrate effects of natural and human factors
    on the KR. This study provides valuable evidence of MP pollution along a remote
    alpine river. However, further studies are needed to address long-term monitoring
    and modelling of MPs in alpine river systems and to determine their ecological
    effects, to enable better MP pollution control, ecological protection, and management
    of alpine rivers. Credit author statement Lin Yang: Methodology, Software, Formal

    16 September 2019 Introduction Malaysia has reached malaria pre-elimination status
    and is currently under review for certification malaria elimination in 2021. Despite
    strong progress in reducing the incidence of human malarias, disease control efforts
    have been hampered by the emergence and increase in human cases of the zoonotic
    Plasmodium knowlesi1. Previously misidentified as P. malariae, P. knowlesi was
    first identified as a public health threat in 20042. Since then, the reported
    incidence of human cases of the simian malaria has increased, and P. knowlesi
    is now the most common cause of malaria in humans in Malaysia3. Most human cases
    of P. knowlesi occur in the Malaysian Bornean state of Sabah; with a large cluster
    in the northern district of Kudat, where P. knowlesi constituted 98% of malaria
    admissions in 20174,5. Taking improvements in molecular diagnostics and surveillance
    into account, the increase in P. knowlesi cases in Malaysian Borneo likely represents
    a genuine incidence rise. Sabah is a global hotspot for deforestation, and a clear
    association between the rise of P. knowlesi incidence in humans and deforestation
    have been shown in Sabah6,7. While the mechanisms which underly this association
    are unknown, it has been suggested that they may be influenced by changes in macaque
    behaviour and densities, human behaviour and vector bionomics8. P. knowlesi transmission
    is sustained by primary reservoir hosts: the long tailed, and pig tailed macaques
    (Macaca fasicularis and Macaca nemestrina). Spillover events occur when infected
    anopheline mosquito vectors feed on humans. Mosquitoes, including the Anopheles
    genus, have 4 main life stages. The juvenile egg, larva and pupa stages are aquatic,
    and the adult stage is terrestrial9. The primary vector of P. knowlesi in Sabah
    is Anopheles balabacensis; a member of the Leucosphyrus group of Anopheles10.
    Anopheles balabacensis are described as a primarily forest-dwelling species, with
    the larval stages preferring humid, shaded aquatic habitats11. The high levels
    of land-use change in Sabah are impacting this vector’s ecology. Deforestation
    separates habitats into fragments, bringing distinct ecosystems into closer contact,
    and can create new habitats at the forest fringe12. Higher abundances of An. balabacensis
    have recently been reported in disturbed, logged forest than in unmodified primary
    forest13. In Kudat, high densities have been found in shrub and bush habitats,
    often close to human settlements, deforested areas, plantations and farms14, and
    higher densities have been found in peri-domestic settings than in plantation
    and secondary forested sites15. A recent study of the ecology of P. knowlesi vectors
    over a wider geographic area in Sabah found different patterns of vector-habitat
    associations, with higher An. balabacensis abundances in farms and forest patches
    than peri-domestic settings, highlighting the local context of the findings from
    Kudat16. There are a number of suggested mechanisms which may explain these changes
    in P. knowlesi vector abundance and distribution in response to land use change
    in Sabah. Deforestation can change microclimate, vegetation and soil composition,
    possibly creating new habitat types for mosquito populations6,17. Brant et al.13
    suggested that the changes in P. knowlesi vector abundance and distribution may
    be explained by an increased availability of larval habitats resulting from land-use
    change. Data on the fine-scale landscape factors which may mediate such a process,
    are largely unreported. However, the current knowledge on An. balabacensis vector
    ecology relies strongly on studies based on adult populations. Kudat has seen
    extensive land-use change, with large areas of forest converted to palm oil and
    rubber plantations18. Rohani et al.19 characterised the breeding sites of An.
    balabacensis in Kudat, describing associations between water body types and the
    vector’s larvae. They reported An. balabacensis larvae in ground pools, tyre tracks,
    slow-flowing streams and swamps. The survey employed a ‘purposeful’ sampling design,
    sampling in locations where one would expect to find higher An. balabacensis densities.
    Study sites were selected based on high village incidence of P. knowlesi malaria
    and large vector populations. Their results, therefore, may not be representative
    of Kudat’s various habitat types and their different ecologies. The study did
    not describe the associations between breeding sites and their surrounding environment.
    Ageep et al.20 demonstrated the benefits of using geospatial tools (remote sensing
    and geographic information systems) to plan and execute spatially representative
    and randomly sampled larval surveys. The advantage of this study design is that
    one can acquire a dataset with a reasonable representation of all habitat types.
    This will result in an accurate representation of the variability of vector breeding
    sites across a study site, rather than an overrepresentation of habitats which
    are easy to access or for which there is a prior knowledge of association with
    larval presence21. Such data can provide a comprehensive picture of the whole
    vector population across the full range of land types in the study site. This
    could highlight areas where aquatic habitats likely or unlikely to be present,
    which may be useful for formulation of vector control strategies. These spatially
    representative data additionally provide opportunities to examine how landscape
    configuration influences vector breeding sites20. Organisms interact with their
    surrounding environment at varying spatial extents, or “spatial scales”. These
    are the different distances over which environmental factors influence and determine
    the distribution of predators, food sources and breeding sites. As a result, the
    spatial distribution of aquatic habitats selected by female mosquitoes for oviposition
    is likely determined by interactions between mosquitoes and their environment
    occurring over varying spatial scales, rather than solely at the point of oviposition22,23.
    We hypothesised that land-use change is increasing the availability of Anopheles
    vector larval habitats, resulting in an increase in human P. knowlesi incidence
    in Sabah. The aim of our study was to assess the associations between fine-scale
    landscape factors over multiple spatial scales and the presence of potential P.
    knowlesi vector larval habitats in an anthropogenically disturbed landscape of
    Kudat. The key objectives were to develop a larval survey sampling frame which
    was representative of the study site using aerial drone imagery, to use remote
    sensing (satellite and drone) data to assemble environmental and spatial covariates
    for the study site, and to identify the fine-scale landscape risk factors for
    P. knowlesi vector larval habitats at their most influential spatial scales. We
    also assessed key indicators for the presence of potential P. knowlesi larval
    habitats and predicted their presence within the study site over time. Together,
    this study illustrates the role of fine-scale land use to anopheline larval ecology
    and highlights potential targets for surveillance and control. Results This study
    area was highly fragmented and consisted of secondary forest, village areas, plantations
    and open areas. Prior to the start of larval collections, detailed high-resolution
    aerial imagery was generated through aerial drone surveys, using the methods described
    by Fornace et al.24. To define a sampling frame representative of all land cover
    types, we divided this study area into a 3 × 2 km grid of 600 sampling blocks
    of 100 × 100 m. We assigned each sampling block to a habitat strata based on visual
    identification of the predominant land type within the sampling block (Fig. 1).
    This yielded 217 sampling blocks classified as forest, 175 as clearing, 91 as
    palm oil plantation, 41 as rubber plantation, 37 as settlement and 39 as coconut
    plantation. Figure 1 (A) Drone image of a sub-section of the sampling site. (B)
    The sub-section split into 100 × 100 m sampling blocks. (C) Sampling blocks classified
    by their predominant land use, used to create the larval survey sampling frame
    which ensured an even representation of habitats. All drone images collected by24.
    Full size image From the 600 blocks, we sampled the same 1 fixed block every month
    to capture temporal variation at the same sites. We additionally sampled at least
    3 randomly selected blocks per land strata every month. This resulted in a total
    of 516 blocks which were sampled at least once throughout the sampling period
    (Table 1). 365 water bodies were sampled in total (Table 2). Anopheles larvae
    were collected from 95 water bodies, including artificial containers, borrow pits,
    ditches, irrigation canals, intermittent streams, leaf axils, ponds, puddles,
    rock pools, rivers, streams and tree holes. Of these Anopheles positive water
    bodies, Culex larvae were collected from 30 (32%), and Aedes larvae were collected
    from 3 (3%). A total of 25 Anopheles larvae were speciated further than the genus
    level, with 19 of these being identified as the primary P. knowlesi vector in
    Sabah An. balabacencis (75%). Table 1 Numbers of sampling blocks sampled for water
    bodies and proportions of these which were positive for Anopheles and An. balabacensis
    larvae by habitat strata. Full size table Table 2 Numbers of water bodies sampled
    and proportions positive for Anopheles larvae by sampling block strata. Full size
    table The number of Anopheles positive water bodies found per month ranged from
    1 to 43 with a mean of 15 (± 11). The highest numbers of water bodies positive
    for Anopheles larvae were found in November and December, and the highest mean
    EVI and rainfall levels were recorded in February (Supplementary Information Fig.
    3). To determine the effect of fine-scale landscape factor and land use patterns,
    we extracted remote sensing derived variables on land cover, fragmentation, rainfall
    and topography (Table 3) at buffer distances from 50 to 500 m, at 50 m intervals,
    from each surveyed water body (Supplementary Information Fig. 1). We additionally
    extracted variables aggregated to the 100 m2 level, for all sampling blocks within
    the survey site. We first fit models to determine the presence or absence of anopheline
    larvae in water bodies, (univariate model results presented in the Supplementary
    Information Table 1). Of the 185 univariate models run for the presence of Anopheles
    in the larval survey water bodies, 35 were significant at p < 0.2. When the significant
    variables were assessed for their most influential spatial scales, 12 variables
    were assessed for inclusion in the multivariate model. These variables comprised
    enhanced vegetation index (EVI) at 500 m, aspect at 350 m, distance from bush
    forest at 400 m, distance from rice agriculture at 250 m, distance from rice plantations
    over 100 m, perimeter: area ratio at 300 m, water body situated in a palm oil
    plantation, water body situated in an area of recent deforestation, shrub vegetation,
    dense vegetation, Culex mosquito larvae present in the water body and Aedes mosquito
    present in the water body. In the final multivariate model increases in mean perimeter:
    area ratio at a 300 m spatial scale, average distance from rubber plantations
    at a 100 m spatial scale, mean aspect at a 350 m spatial scale and Culex larvae
    presence were all positively associated with the presence of Anopheles larvae
    in aquatic habitats (Fig. 2). There was no association between the land class
    at the site of the water body and larval presence. Table 3 Environmental and spatial
    covariates assessed and their sources. Full size table Figure 2 Odds ratios and
    95% confidence intervals for risk factors for Anopheles larval habitats, at their
    most influential spatial scales. Full size image The second part of the analysis
    involved fitting two models to determine the presence or absence of water bodies
    within sampling blocks, and the presence or absence of anopheline larvae in sampling
    blocks. The univariate results are presented in the Supplementary Information
    Tables 2 and 3. Results of the final multivariate regression indicated that the
    presence of water bodies in sampling bodies was negatively associated with elevation
    and slope and positively with rainfall lagged by 2 months and EVI (Fig. 3). The
    Moran’s I statistic for residual spatial autocorrelation in the water body presence
    model was low, but significant (Moran’s I 0.16, 0.01). There was no residual temporal
    autocorrelation. Predictive power of the model as Area Under the Curve (AUC) was
    moderately strong (AUC 0.76, 95% CI 0.72–0.81). The four variables which comprised
    the final model for water body presence in sampling blocks were used to create
    a time-series of predictive maps over the study time period (Video 1). Although
    aspect and elevation were both significantly associated with Anopheles presence
    in sampling blocks in the univariate analysis (Supplementary Information Table
    3), these variables did not remain significant in the multivariate analysis. Thus,
    none of the environmental factors investigated were significantly associated with
    presence of Anopheles larvae in sampling blocks. The Moran’s I statistics for
    residual spatial autocorrelation in the sampling block model for Anopheles larvae
    presence was not significant (Moran’s I 0.03, 0.06). There was no residual temporal
    autocorrelation, and the predictive power was moderately strong (AUC 0.75, 95%
    CI 0.71–0.80). In the final multivariate models for both water body presence and
    larval presence within sampling blocks, there were no associations between the
    majority land class of the sampling block and presence of the response variable.
    Figure 3 Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for risk factors for presence
    of water bodies within sampling blocks. Full size image In these initial models
    of water body presence in sampling blocks, collection month was retained as a
    random effect to account for correlations between repeat samples. In a second
    step, we investigated whether month of collection was the main source of variation
    in water body and Anopheles larvae presence by removing this random effect and
    examining the impact of the AUC. The predictive power for the water body models
    remained stable when month was removed as a random effect, with only a minor reduction
    in AUC from 0.761 to 0.756 (95% CI 0.71–0.80). This confirms temporal variation
    between months was not a major source of variation for water body presence. In
    contrast, the predictive power of the Anopheles model fell more substantially
    (0.75 to 0.60, 95% CI 0.53–0.67) when month was removed, indicating that temporal
    variation may be a more important determinant of larval presence. Discussion The
    key objective of this study was to address the gap in our understanding of the
    role of land use change and fine-scale environmental factors in driving increases
    in incidence of human P. knowlesi by increasing the availability of vector larval
    habitats. We found positive associations between Anopheles larval presence and
    distance from agriculture, forest fragmentation and topology, and key environmental
    indicators for potential vector breeding sites in the study site. The probability
    of detecting Anopheles larvae in aquatic habitats did not very between land classes,
    and there was no association between deforestation and Anopheles larvae presence.
    To our knowledge, this is the first study which has systematically assessed the
    environmental and spatial risk factors for Anopheles vector breeding ecology in
    Kudat. We demonstrated how aerial and satellite-based remote sensing data can
    be used to make a study more robust by informing a spatially representative sampling
    frame, and to evaluate risk factors for vector breeding over multiple spatial
    scales, a methodology highly relevant to other vector-borne diseases. Overall,
    the findings show that there are interactions at play between Anopheles vector
    breeding, distance from plantation agriculture, forest fragmentation and topology.
    The associations with forest fragmentation and distance from rubber plantations
    indicate that An. balabacensis vector ecology may be more complex than its previous
    descriptions as a primarily forest dwelling group, or the vector has adapted to
    the new environment resulted from changing land use patterns. This is supported
    by the lack of association between Anopheles positive water bodies and forested
    land types, and the lowest proportions of Anopheles larvae positive water bodies
    being found in forested land classes. These findings support our hypothesis that
    land use change is creating more suitable habitats for Anopheles vector larvae
    and this may be contributing to the higher P. knowlesi incidence in humans in
    Kudat. Our findings are consistent with recent findings of increased adult An.
    balabacensis abundance in disturbed forests, plantations, farms and close to human
    settlements13,14,15. The findings also align with those of Fornace et al.29, that
    fragmentation, aspect and agriculture are associated with increased risks of P.
    knowlesi exposure, and may explain some of the mechanisms underlying this link,
    whereby these changes to land cover may increase potential for P. knowlesi vector
    proliferation and disease transmission. Culex larvae were collected from roughly
    one third of the water bodies which were positive for Anopheles larvae, resulting
    in a strong positive association between these species’ larval presence. This
    may be driven by finer-scale micro habitat characteristics which were not analysed
    in this study, such as the physical and chemical characteristics of the water
    bodies which may create favourable conditions for oviposition in both species.
    However, further studies are needed to investigate this further. The ecological
    processes which determine vector breeding ecology likely occur over multiple spatial
    scales8,22,31,32,33; however these scale-dependent effects are rarely considered
    in standard investigations of larval ecology. This study used a novel data-driven
    approach to incorporate and assess the contribution of environmental variables
    acting across different spatial scales (from 50 to 500 m around the larval collection
    points). The results showed that fragmentation, distance from agriculture and
    aspect were most strongly associated with larvae positive sites, each at different
    spatial scales. Habitat fragmentation, measured as perimeter: area ratio, over
    a 300 m buffer radius was positively associated with the presence of Anopheles
    breeding sites. Perimeter to area ratio is a strong and widely used indicator
    for habitat fragmentation34. Lower habitat patch size within a given area results
    in higher perimeter to area ratio, meaning that the area is constitutes smaller
    islands or “fragments” of habitat making up a complex mosaic, rather than larger
    homogenous patches of habitats35. Fragmented landscapes form a patchwork of land
    types and can expose more forest fringe, providing more potential larval habitats
    than one continuous patch36. This association may explain the findings by Fornace
    et al.29, that fragmented landscapes contribute to increased human exposure to
    P. knowlesi in Sabah. We additionally identified that mean proximity to rubber
    plantations was associated with increased risk of larval presence, and the highest
    proportions of Anopheles larvae were found in sampling blocks which were classified
    as rubber plantations. Although adult malaria vectors have been reported from
    rubber plantations in Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia37,38,39, there is limited
    evidence for anopheline breeding around rubber plantations in South East Asia.
    These habitats are, however, inhabited by P. knowlesi reservoir macaques40, and
    breeding in close proximity to macaque habitats may be beneficial to vectors as
    they can provide essential bloodmeals before oviposition. The rubber farmers in
    these habitats may also be a source of bloodmeals. The association of larval presence
    close to, but not within rubber plantations is consistent with previous reports
    of malaria vectors breeding on the outskirts of plantations in Thailand41. The
    central tendency of aspect over a 350 m radius was associated with Anopheles larvae
    presence. This finding supports, and may offer partial explanation to the findings
    of Brock et al.8, who found mean aspect over 1–2 km to be a potential determinant
    of household P. knowlesi infection risk in Northern Sabah. Aspect is highly correlated
    with agriculture type in Kudat and the association may arise from the availability
    of aquatic larval habitats in local agriculture8. While the mechanisms underlying
    these associations and the varying spatial scales over which they occur may be
    due to complex ecosystem processes, the results are useful in identifying the
    most influential spatial scales at which these fine-scale landscape risk factors
    work. Additionally, we demonstrate how remote sensing data can be used to design
    sampling frames and stratify by habitat type. Although larval surveys are routinely
    conducted, these are typically only done in areas with water bodies. Quantifying
    the availability of aquatic habitats across different land types provides further
    insight into how land use change impacts larval distribution by identifying areas
    where no aquatic habitats are likely to be present. This sampling approach allowed
    us to identify An. balabacensis larvae in water bodies which are not usually surveyed
    for Anopheles larvae. The sampling block-level analysis provided key temporal
    indicators of water body presence within the study site. The results show that
    the presence of water bodies is largely governed by topographic and climactic
    variables; slope, elevation, rainfall levels two months prior and EVI. There were
    no strong indicators for the presence of Anopheles larvae within sampling-blocks.
    The experimental removal of collection month as a random effect in this model
    greatly reduced its predictive power, indicating that temporal trends may drive
    some of this variation. The lack of strong association with any of the environmental
    variables may also be due to the smaller sample size of larval presence compared
    to water body presence, or due to the more complex relationships between vector
    breeding, agriculture and fragmentation. Nevertheless, identification of factors
    associated with water bodies allows prioritisation of areas to sample or to target
    for preventative control programs and larval source management; for example, choosing
    areas to sample or treat based on topography and rainfall within the past two
    months. While this study has generated several new insights into the larval ecology
    of P. knowlesi vectors, it has several important limitations. As we aimed to characterise
    fine-scale environmental risk factors, with 500 m as the maximum spatial extent
    of prediction, this study cannot be used to generalise about larval distribution
    over wider spatial scales or predict over larger areas. As this study area was
    highly disturbed and in close proximity to human settlements, future studies could
    evaluate larval distribution within primary forests or across disturbance gradients.
    We were also limited by the water bodies which we could reach. It is possible
    that some potential larval habitats such as tree holes higher in the canopy and
    water collecting plants such as Bromeliads may have been missed in this sampling
    frame. High mortality rates when rearing Anopheles larvae, and the unavailability
    of molecular tools in the field to identify mosquitoes to the species level, meant
    that only a minority of Anopheles larvae could be speciated. Seventy six percent
    of the speciated Anopheles larvae were, however, identified as An. balabacensis,
    the primary P. knowlesi vector in the study region. We can therefore assume that
    a high majority of the Anopheles larvae from which the conclusions of this study
    are drawn, were of the An. balabacensis species. This indicates that the results
    presented in this study are directly relevant to P. knowlesi transmission. The
    study is also limited by the fact that it was conducted over one year and cannot
    be used to examine temporal fluctuations in vector breeding sites between years.
    More extensive long-term studies could additionally characterise breeding sites
    of different Anopheles species and confirm the majority within this area were
    An. balabacensis. Despite these limitations, this study sheds important insights
    on anopheline vector ecology relevant for P. knowlesi transmission. Additionally,
    we develop a new methodology using drones to collect aerial imagery to define
    sampling frames which are representative of the land types present. Despite the
    complexities of land cover and landscape aspects associated with P. knowlesi breeding,
    it is clear from the results that P. knowlesi vectors are not strictly forest
    breeding in Kudat. Many of the results correspond with, and may offer partial
    explanation to the mechanisms underlying findings by Fornace et al.1 on the contribution
    of agriculture, topography and habitat configuration to human P. knowlesi exposure.
    We have provided key indicators which can inform the future surveys to be used
    in planning, and shown how datasets derived from freely available remote sensing
    sources and drone technology can be used to interrogate how fine-scale landscape
    factors are related to P. knowlesi vector breeding ecology. Methods Study site
    Kudat experiences a tropical climate, with temperatures averaging 32 °C in lowlands,
    and 21 °C in highlands (Fig. 4). Rainfall is frequent throughout the year, with
    higher volumes during the November to March north-east monsoons14. The landscape
    is comprised of lowland secondary forest, with extensive conversion to palm oil
    and rubber plantations18. Figure 4 Map of Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, including drone
    image of sampling site in Kudat. Full size image Larval survey A randomly stratified
    longitudinal larval survey was completed from May 11th 2015 to April 14th 2016
    within a major transmission focus of P. knowlesi in Kudat, Sabah in Malaysian
    Borneo, previously described by Fornace et al.1. The survey was conducted within
    a 3 × 2 km grid composed of 600 sampling blocks of 100 × 100 m. To ensure an even
    representation of habitats sampled, drone imagery was used to classify each sampling
    block into 6 different land types based on visual classification of predominant
    vegetation by local field staff. The field staff were familiar with both the landscape
    and interpreting drone imagery using standardised guidelines describing each land
    type (Fig. 1). Every month, at least 3 random blocks from each land stratum were
    surveyed. Additionally, a single fixed block per strata was sampled every month
    to evaluate temporal trends. During the surveys every potential aquatic habitat
    which was within-reach of field technicians on the ground in the sampling block
    was sampled for mosquito larvae by larval dipping. Larvae were collected from
    water bodies by the conventional 10-dipping42. In smaller aquatic habits such
    as tree holes where dipping was not possible, a plastic pipette was used43. The
    GPS point of each sample site was recorded. Collected larvae were sorted by land
    use type and larval habitat and brought to the field laboratory for rearing to
    adult stages. Identification of adult mosquitoes was by microscope, and based
    on keys44,45. Remote sensing data analysis We extracted the covariates to be assessed
    as risk factors from the drone and remote sensing data described in Table 3. Slope,
    aspect and topographic wetness index were calculated from the elevation raster
    in ArcGIS (10.8.1). The distance from different land cover classifications were
    calculated as Euclidean Distance in ArcGIS. EVI and NDVI were filtered for pixel
    quality, and raster values were scaled to a factor of 0.0001. Mean habitat fragmentation
    indices were calculated using the “landscapemetrics” package in R (v1.2.1335)46.
    The indices assessed were perimeter: area ratio (the ratio of habitat patch perimeter
    length to total patch area), shape index (measure of patch shape complexity adjusted
    for size of patch) and fractal dimension (degree of patch complexity across a
    number of spatial scales)35,47. Drone images of the sampling frame were visualised
    in QGIS (3.12) and the density and diversity of the vegetation surrounding each
    larval sampling site were qualitatively assessed. Vegetation density was categorised
    as dense (tightly-packed vegetation with no clear patches of forest floor), patchy
    (some low canopy with patches of low lying shrubbery and forest floor visible),
    planted (evenly spaced vegetation of the same species) and sparse (large portions
    of ground visible and little to no vegetation nearby) (Fig. 5). Vegetation diversity
    was categorised as edge (a visible transition between forest and another form
    of vegetation), mixed-farmed (mixture of planted species and natural growth),
    mixed forest (mixture of natural growth), monoculture (single species evenly planted)
    and shrub (low canopy level of majority of vegetation) (Fig. 6). Number of months
    since a deforestation event in 2014 was calculated for each sampling block using
    a series of 4 classified images of deforestation. Full details of the preparation
    of environmental and spatial covariates are explained in Supplementary Information
    Table 4, with visual examples of distance, EVI, rainfall and topographic rasters
    in Supplementary Information Fig. 1. Figure 5 Examples of vegetation density levels.

    size image The mean and standard deviation of the covariates in Table 3, aside
    from time since deforestation and vegetation density and diversity, were extracted
    at 10 buffer radii (50–500 m in 50 m intervals), using the “raster” package in
    R. These buffer radii were used as a proxy for the spatial scales at which associations
    between covariates and Anopheles breeding may occur (Supplementary Information
    Fig. 2). Statistical analysis All statistical models were built and run in R using
    the “lme4” package. Univariate binomial repeated measure mixed-effect logistic
    regression models were run for each covariate at each spatial scale (buffer radius).
    The primary outcome of this analysis was a binary presence or absence of larvae,
    and sampling block and collection month were included as random effects. All variables
    with p < 0.2 were assessed for inclusion in the multivariate analysis. Variables
    which were significant over multiple spatial scales or over multiple fragmentation
    indices were compared, and single variables were selected based on lower Akaike
    Information Criterion (AIC). The final multivariate model was developed using
    a foreword stepwise procedure, retaining all variables significant at p < 0.05
    and assessing each step for reduction in AIC and interactions. Two sampling block-level
    risk factor analyses were undertaken. The outcomes were the presence or absence
    of water bodies, and the presence or absence of Anopheles larvae, within sampling
    blocks. The variables assessed in the sampling block level analyses comprised
    the mean EVI, NDVI and monthly rainfall for collection month and lagged by 1 and
    2 months, distance from a large water body, elevation, slope, aspect, TWI, the
    majority land class for each sampling block, and a binary variable for whether
    deforestation had occurred in each sampling block. These were analysed using the
    logistic regression procedure described above, with collection month as a random
    effect. To avoid overfitting these models by including sampling block as both
    an outcome and a random effect, sampling block was not included as a random effect.
    Residual spatial autocorrelation for risk of water body or Anopheles larval presence
    in sampling blocks was assessed using Moran’s I. Residual temporal autocorrelation
    functions and partial autocorrelation functions were also assessed for significance.
    The predictive power of the sampling block models were assessed by AUC. To determine
    whether collection month was a key source of variation in the sampling block-level
    models, it was experimentally removed, and AUC was examined. The results of the
    multivariate model for water body presence were used to predict the presence and
    absence of water bodies in each sampling block cell over the study period. Ethics

  description: The transport of agricultural nonpoint source (NPS) pollutants in water
    pathways is affected by various factors such as precipitation, terrain, soil erosion,
    surface and subsurface flows, soil texture, land management, and vegetation coverage.
    In this study, based on the transmission mechanism of NPS pollutants, we constructed
    a five-factor model for predicting the path-through rate of NPS pollutants. The
    five indices of the hydrological processes, namely the precipitation index (α),
    terrain index (β), runoff index (TI), subsurface runoff index (LI), and buffer
    strip retention index (RI), are integrated with the pollution source data, including
    the rural living, livestock and farmland data, obtained from the national pollution
    source census. The proposed model was applied to the headwater of the Miyun Reservoir
    watershed for identifying the areas with high path-through rates of agricultural
    NPS pollutants. The results demonstrated the following. (1) The simulation accuracy
    of the model is acceptable in mesoscale watersheds. The total nitrogen (TN) and
    total phosphorus (TP) agriculture loads were determined as 705.11 t and 3.16 t
    in 2014, with the relative errors of the simulations being 19.62% and 24.45%,
    respectively. (2) From the spatial distribution of the agricultural NPS, the TN
    and TP resource loads were mainly distributed among the upstream of Dage and downstream
    of Taishitun, as well as the towns of Bakshiying and Gaoling. The major source
    of TN was found to be farmland, accounting for 47.6%, followed by livestock, accounting
    for 37.4%. However, the path-through rates of TP were different from those of
    TN; rural living was the main TP source (65%). (3) The path-through rates of agricultural
    NPS were the highest for the towns of Wudaoying, Dage, Tuchengzi, Anchungoumen,
    and Huodoushan, where the path-through rate of TN ranged from 0.17 to 0.26. As
    for TP, it was highest in Wudaoying, Kulongshan, Dage, and Tuchengzi, with values
    ranging from 0.012 to 0.019. (4) A comprehensive analysis of the distribution
    of the NPS pollution load and the path-through rate revealed the towns of Dage,
    Wudaoying, and Tuchengzi as the critical source areas of agricultural NPS pollutants.
    Therefore, these towns should be seriously considered for effective watershed
    management. In addition, compared with field monitoring, the export coefficient
    model, and the physical-based model, the proposed five-factor model, which is
    based on the path-through rate and the mechanism of agricultural NPS pollutant
    transfer, cannot only obtain the spatial distribution characteristics of the path-through
    rate on a field scale but also be applicable to large-scale watersheds for estimating

    in water pathways is affected by various factors such as precipitation, terrain,
    soil erosion, surface and subsurface flows, soil texture, land management, and

    pollutants, we constructed a five-factor model for predicting the path-through

    loads were determined as 705.11 t and 3.16 t in 2014, with the relative errors

    distribution of the agricultural NPS, the TN and TP resource loads were mainly
    distributed among the upstream of Dage and downstream of Taishitun, as well as
    the towns of Bakshiying and Gaoling. The major source of TN was found to be farmland,
    accounting for 47.6%, followed by livestock, accounting for 37.4%. However, the
    path-through rates of TP were different from those of TN; rural living was the

    highest in Wudaoying, Kulongshan, Dage, and Tuchengzi, with values ranging from
    0.012 to 0.019. (4) A comprehensive analysis of the distribution of the NPS pollution
    load and the path-through rate revealed the towns of Dage, Wudaoying, and Tuchengzi
    as the critical source areas of agricultural NPS pollutants. Therefore, these
    towns should be seriously considered for effective watershed management. In addition,
    compared with field monitoring, the export coefficient model, and the physical-based
    model, the proposed five-factor model, which is based on the path-through rate
    and the mechanism of agricultural NPS pollutant transfer, cannot only obtain the
    spatial distribution characteristics of the path-through rate on a field scale
    but also be applicable to large-scale watersheds for estimating the path-through
    rates of NPS pollutants. Keywords: nonpoint source pollution; path-through rate;
    pollution load; hydrological process 1. Introduction The second national census
    of pollution sources indicated that agriculture is the leading cause of nonpoint
    source (NPS) pollution in China [1]. Sustainable agriculture depends on a delicate
    balance between economic stability (achieved through the increase in agricultural
    productivity to meet national food demands), reduction in the use of finite natural
    resources, and reduction of NPSs, which have detrimental effects on the environment
    [2,3]. Contrary to point source pollution, NPS pollution is characterized by random
    and intermittent occurrences, complex mechanisms and processes, uncertain discharge
    channels and amounts, variable spatial and temporal pollution loads, and difficulties
    in monitoring, simulation, and control [4]. These characteristics cause challenges
    in the simulation and evaluation of the transport processes of NPS pollutants
    from agricultural sources to sinks [5]. Many studies have indicated that NPS pollution
    is closely related to watershed runoff and confluence, while it is not evidently
    related to watershed-scale loading and concentration [6]. In general, the migration
    of NPS pollutants and their transport process can be divided into two hydrological
    processes: the generation of pollutants and their transfer to waterbodies [7].
    The path-through rate is an all-new concept and a comprehensive parameter that
    can describe the NPS pollution transfer process, starting from pollutant generation
    to transfer to waterbodies [8]. Based on this concept, risk assessment can be
    performed for NPS pollutants from each grid to the receiving waterbodies in the
    watershed scale by determining the risk grade according to the water criteria
    of different water environmental function zones. Although some scholars have also
    conducted similar studies through point monitoring (based on the coefficient of
    NPSs into the river), their results cannot be extended to the watershed scale.
    In particular, the pollutants generated and accumulated in watersheds are derived,
    transmitted, and intercepted by precipitation, slope, and other surface and terrain
    factors, expressed as a scaling factor, which is obtained by dividing the part
    of the pollutant load transferred to waterbodies by the total pollutant load.
    Currently, there are approximately three types of estimation methods for calculating
    the path-through rate of watershed agricultural NPS pollutants: field monitoring,
    the traditional empirical model, and physical-based models [9]. Field monitoring
    has several advantages such as high accuracy and the ability to monitor the entire
    migration process of NPS pollutants. However, owing to its high cost and time
    requirement [10], it is more applicable to small-scale watersheds or fields rather
    than to large-scale watersheds on a national scale. The traditional empirical
    model involves the export coefficient mode (ECM), hydrologic curve partitioning,
    the soil conservation service curve number (SCN-CN), and so on. [11]. This model
    integrates the transport process as a “black box” or “gray box” model, completely
    ignoring the migration mechanism and the transformation of NPS pollutants at the
    watershed scale [12]. In addition, the export coefficients are inherently highly
    variable and reflect particular site conditions for each study. Physical-based
    models include SWAT, HSPF, and AnnAGNPS, which are integrated with a large number
    of parameters and functional formulas for simulating the whole process of NPS
    pollutant transfer from sources to sinks and are more commonly applied for mesoscale
    watersheds. However, there are uncertainties with regard to their practical application
    because of differences in input data, insufficient localization of parameters,
    and lack of operator experience [13]. To overcome these weaknesses and to fully
    leverage the advantages of the existing physical-based and empirical models, two
    hypotheses were proposed. First, it is possible to generalize the major process
    of transfer of pollutants from sources to sinks, and second, the generalized process
    can be integrated into a new model on the watershed and administrative scales.
    In this study, a novel path-through rate model of NPS pollutants is developed
    using five major factors, namely the precipitation index (α), terrain index (β),
    runoff index (LI), subsurface runoff index (TI), and buffer strip retention index
    (RI). Hereafter, the model is referred to as the path-through rate five-factor
    model (or PTRFFM). The technical framework of the PTRFFM is illustrated in Figure
    1. To check the reliability of the PTRFFM, a case study is conducted in a headwater
    watershed of a prominent drinking water supply in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region.
    Overall, the objective of this study is to establish the PTRFFM to predict the
    path-through rate of NPS pollutants jointly on the watershed and administrative
    scales and estimate the resources, load, and distribution of agricultural NPS
    pollutants. The study also aims to verify the reliability of the PTRFFM through
    the assessment of the pollution load, critical source areas, and spatial distribution.
    Figure 1. Technical framework of the PTRFFM. 2. Methods and Materials 2.1. Study
    Area The Miyun Reservoir is the most important source of drinking water in the
    Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region (Figure 2). The Chaohe watershed is the upper watershed
    of the Miyun Reservoir, and it covers a drainage area of 4888 km2, consisting
    of 16 rainfall stations and 3 hydrology stations. The average annual precipitation
    is between 350 mm and 630 mm, where approximately 70% of the precipitation occurs
    from June to September, during which the region frequently receives heavy rainfalls.
    Figure 2. Map of the study area. The watershed governs 24 towns, which are mainly
    composed of agricultural populations (~390,000). Livestock, poultry farming, and
    agriculture are more developed in the area compared with other industries, and
    the main crops are wheat, corn, and soybean. In the recent two decades, agricultural
    NPS pollution has become the dominant factor affecting the water quality of the
    Miyun Reservoir, where nitrogen and phosphorus predominantly limit the eutrophication
    of water bodies. Consequently, forecasting the critical source areas of the upper
    watershed is highly significant for ensuring the safety of the water environments
    and promoting sustainable development in this area. 2.2. Construction of the PTRFFM
    2.2.1. Conceptualization of Five Major Parameters Considering the effects of precipitation,
    terrain, runoff, surface runoff, and buffer strip retention on NPS pollution,
    the five-factor model is described by Equation (1). 𝜆 𝑖 =𝑓(𝛼,𝛽,𝑇𝐼,𝐿𝐼,𝑅𝐼) (1) where
    𝜆 𝑖 is the path-through rate, 𝛼 is the precipitation index, 𝛽 is the terrain index,
    𝑇𝐼 is the surface index (mm), 𝐿𝐼 is the subsurface runoff index (mm), and 𝑅𝐼 is
    the buffer strip retention index. These five indices are correlated with the spatial
    unit (grid cell), which was set to be 30 m × 30 m based on the digital elevation
    model (DEM), precipitation, slope, land use, and vegetation coverage map using
    ArcGIS 10.2. Precipitation index. The precipitation index (α) is determined by
    multiplying the impact factors of the spatial and temporal changes in annual precipitation,
    denoted by 𝛼 𝑠 and 𝛼 𝑡 , respectively. In this paper, the spatial changes in precipitation
    are obtained from the rainfall data of 16 stations based on the inverse distance
    weighting interpolate method. The NPS pollution load delivered to a river is positively
    correlated with precipitation; therefore, the NPS pollutant loss can be identified
    as a function of rainfall [14]. 𝐿=𝑓(𝑟) (2) 𝛼= 𝛼 𝑠 × 𝛼 𝑡 = 𝑓(𝑟) 𝑓 (𝑟) ¯ × 𝑅 𝑗 𝑅
    ¯ (3) where 𝐿 is the annual loss of NPS pollutants that drain into rivers with
    runoff (kg), which can be obtained by observing the outlets, and r is the annual
    rainfall in the entire study watershed for a given year (mm). According to hydrology
    and water quality data, monitored by 16 hydrological stations near the Chaohe
    River watershed from 1991 to 2018, the correlation equation between the watershed
    annual rainfall and the load of the NPS pollutants discharged into rivers can
    be realized as follows: 𝐿 𝑁 =0.0402 𝑟 2 −27.81𝑟+530.14  𝑅 2 =0.8631 (4) 𝐿 𝑃 =0.0007
    𝑟 2 −0.4538𝑟+77.939  𝑅 2 =0.7374 (5) In addition, the spatial variation impact
    factor 𝛼 𝑠 , is obtained as, where 𝑅 𝑗 is the annual rainfall in a grid cell for
    a given year (mm) and 𝑅 ¯ is the average rainfall of the entire watershed for
    a given year (mm). Terrain index. The terrain index (β) is used to describe the
    terrain heterogeneity effect on NPS pollutant loads. Many studies have demonstrated
    that the slope has a profound impact on parameters such as runoff flux and velocity.
    Since runoff is the primary carrier of nutrients, nutrient loss is also greatly
    impacted by the slope [15]. The relationship between the runoff and slope can
    be established as shown below [16]: 𝛽= 𝜃 𝑗 𝑑 𝜃 ̲ 𝑑 (6) where 𝜃 𝑗 is the slope
    for grid j (30 m × 30 m), and 𝜃 ̲ is the average slope of the entire study watershed.
    The temporal variation of the terrain is not remarkable in short time periods;
    therefore, the 𝛽 value varies for different grid cells. In a specific grid cell,
    the 𝛽 value does not change over the year. The runoff index (TI) was used for
    the calculation of the runoff index using the Soil Conservation Services Curve
    Number method (Soil conservation service curve number, SCS-CN) [17]. 𝑆=( 25,400
    𝐶𝑁 )−254 (7) 𝑇𝐼= (𝑃−0.3𝑆) 2 𝑝+0.7𝑠 (8) where 𝑇𝐼 is the runoff depth (mm); CN is
    the curve number, which is a function of land use, soil, management, and hydrologic
    condition; P is the rainfall of the watershed (mm/a); S is the potential maximum
    retention (mm/a). In SCS models, soils are defined by groups based on their runoff
    potential-low, moderately low, moderately high, and high. Subsurface flow index.
    In China, NPS pollution by nitrate leaching is not exclusively limited to intensively
    used agricultural ecosystems, but it has also been reported for forest ecosystems
    exposed to high loads of atmospheric N deposition. LI is a widespread method for
    evaluating the soil water infiltration capacity with regard to the impact on the
    losses of nitrogen and phosphorus, through which hydrological soil groups are
    based on the soil type, land use, and previous soil moisture condition. LI is
    determined by multiplying the rainfall spatial distribution index (PI) and seasonal
    distribution index (SI), where the PI represents the maximum theoretical rainfall
    that can be used for the infiltration of watershed units and SI represents the
    effect of seasonal rainfall changes on the soil moisture infiltration [18,19].
    The specific calculation formula is as follows: 𝐿𝐼=𝑃𝐼×𝑆𝐼= (𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑐−0.4×𝑆) 𝑝𝑟𝑐𝑒+0.6×𝑆
    2 × 2× 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑐(𝑙𝑠) 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑐 − − − − − − − − − − √ 3 (9) where prec is the annual precipitation
    (mm/a), S is the annual potential maximum retention (mm/a), and prec(ls) is the
    total precipitation in non-flood seasons (November to May of the following year).
    Buffer strip retention. Runoff rates have spatial patterns controlled by loading
    and filtering along with the flow paths from the upslope contributing area and
    downslope dispersal area [20]. RI values are a relative estimate of high to low
    buffering, and they represent a relative buffering likelihood. RI can be expressed
    as follows: 𝑅𝐼=𝑙𝑛 ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ∑ 𝑁 𝐷𝐴=1 𝑇 𝐷 𝐴 𝑖 𝑡𝑎 𝑛 𝐵 𝐷𝐴𝑖 ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ (10) where ∑
    𝑇 𝐷𝐴𝑖 is the cumulative trapping efficiency within a dispersal area, and 𝐵 𝐷𝐴𝑖
    is the average slope of a dispersal area. Soil erosion index. Phosphorus is lost
    in the form of particles in water reservoirs owing to soil erosion. The universal
    soil loss equation is applied to evaluate the path-through rate of total phosphorus
    in this study [21]. 𝐴=𝑅×𝐾×𝐿×𝑆×𝐶×𝑃 (11) where A is the estimated average soil loss
    in tons per acre per year, R is the rainfall-runoff erosivity factor, K is the
    soil erodibility factor, L is the slope length factor, S is the slope steepness
    factor, C is the cover management factor, and P is the support practice factor.
    2.2.2. Data Standardization of the PTRFFM The five-factor raster data are standardized
    to unify the calculation unit. After the normality test, the standardization of
    the normal and skewed distribution data is calculated as follows: Normal distribution
    𝑋= 𝑋 𝑖 −𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑥) 𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑥)−𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑥) Skewed distribution 𝑁𝑋= 𝛷 𝑋 𝑖 𝑋 𝑖  𝛷 𝑋 𝑖 < 𝑋 𝑖 𝑁𝑋=
    𝑋 𝑖 𝛷 𝑋 𝑖  𝛷 𝑋 𝑖 > 𝑋 𝑖 where X and NX are standardization factors, 𝑋 𝑖 is the
    value of each factor for grid i, 𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑥) is the minimum grid value for each factor,
    𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑥) is the maximum grid value for each factor, 𝑋 𝑖 is the maximum value for
    factor i, and 𝛷 𝑋 𝑖 is the median for factor i. The precipitation and terrain
    indices are both dimensionless quantities; therefore, α and β do not need to be
    standardized. TI, LI, RI, and A have dimensions to ensure that the NPS pollutant
    load to water bodies is less than the pollutant source load; therefore, they need
    to be standardized, and then a spatial overlay operation needs to be performed
    for each of the standardized results. The standardization method of total nitrogen
    (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) is as follows: 𝜆 𝑇𝑁 =𝛼×𝛽×𝑁𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑇𝐼×𝑁𝑜𝑟𝑚𝐿𝐼×𝑁𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑅𝐼 (12)
    𝜆 𝑇𝑃 =𝛼×𝛽×𝑁𝑜𝑟𝑚(𝐴+𝑇𝐼)×𝑁𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑅𝐼×𝑁𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑅𝐼 (13) 2.3. Data Source The input data include
    a DEM, land use, soil type, vegetation map, weather data, hydrological data, and
    socioeconomic data of the study area (Table 1). The land-use types are classified
    into five types: farmland, grassland, forest, residential land, and unused land.
    The NPS of the study watershed is categorized into three types: rural living,
    livestock, and land use. Table 1. Source and description of basic data. 2.4. Estimation
    of the Agricultural NPS Pollutant Loads The ECM is used to estimate the NPS loads
    when the path-through rate is obtained using the PTRFFM. The calculation method
    is as follows: 𝐿= ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑛 𝑃 𝐸 𝑖 [ 𝐴 𝑖 ( 𝐼 𝑖 )] (14) where L is the loss of nutrients
    (kg), 𝐸 𝑖 is the export coefficient of the nutrient source i (kg·ca−1·a−1 or kg·km−2·a−1)
    (see Table 2 for details), 𝐴 𝑖 is the area of the watershed occupied by the land
    use type i (km2), or the number of livestock type I, or of people, 𝐼 𝑖 is the
    nutrient input to the source i (kg), and p is the path-through rate of each grid.
    Table 2. Export coefficients for different pollution sources. 3. Results and Discussion
    3.1. Major Parameters of the Spatial Distribution from the PTRFFM The results
    show that αTN and αTP were 1.28–8.18 and 0.29–7.42, respectively. β, LI, and TI
    were the same for TN and TP, that is, 0–2.57, 301.99–663.32 mm, and 182.49–483.12
    mm, respectively. In addition, RITN and RITP were 0.21–17.5 and 0–17.81, respectively,
    and ATP was 0.00166–852.63 (t/(hm2·a)). A comprehensive analysis of the spatial
    distribution of the five factors (Figure 3 and Figure 4), TN, TP, α, LI, and TI
    was performed; the results show a high similarity of the spatial distribution
    characteristics with the rainfall map. Specifically, the areas with high rainfall
    (upstream Wudaoying, Tuchengzi, Dage, Anchungoumen, and downstream Tuchengzi)
    also had high α, LI, and TI because these three indices were mainly calculated
    on the basis of rainfall. The terrain index β is proportional to the watershed
    slope, showing a high trend in some parts northwest and a low trend in the cultivated
    land in the valley. From the perspective of the impact degree of the land use,
    the cultivated land area was characterized by high LI and TI and low β and RI.
    The likely reason for this trend is that the CN value of the cultivated land was
    larger than those of other types of land use, which promoted the generation of
    surface and subsurface runoffs. In addition, β of the cultivated land in the valley
    was lowest because of the gentle slope in the area. Low RI is possibly because
    of interception by forest grass and the water surface buffer system. Thus, cultivated
    land has no intercepting effect on NPS pollution. Figure 3. Spatial distribution
    of the five factors of NPS with respect to TN. Figure 4. Spatial distribution
    of the five factors of NPS with respect to TP. 3.2. Spatial Distribution Characteristics
    of the Path-through Rate For a field of scale (Figure 5), the path-through rate
    of TN was mainly distributed in the farmland of the towns of Wudaoying, Dage,
    Tuchengzi, Anchungoumen, and Huodoushan; this is similar to the spatial distribution
    characteristics for TP. Figure 5. Spatial distribution of path-through rate for
    the NPS pollution of field and town scales. For the town scale (Figure 5), the
    primary spatial distribution of the path-through rate of TN was in towns such
    as the upper reaches of Wudaoying, Dage, and Tuchengzi and the lower reaches of
    Anchungou Gate and Huodoushan; the rates ranged from 0.17 to 0.26. However, the
    upper reaches of the basin and the west side of the middle reaches, including
    Wudaoying, Kulongshan, Dage, and Tuchengzi, were the primary distribution areas
    for the path–through rate of TP, with the rates ranging from 0.012 to 0.019. 3.3.
    NPS Pollution Load and Source Analysis The TN and TP loads of the research area
    in 2014 were obtained according to the ECM and coefficient models. The simulation
    results indicate that the TN load was 13.87 times that of the TP load, which were
    7505.0 t and 540.95 t, respectively. As shown in Table 3, for different pollution
    sources, the pollution loads of TN were 1118.2 t, 2815.3 t, and 3616.5 t, for
    rural living, livestock, and land use, correspondingly accounting for 15%, 37.4%,
    and 47.6% of the TN loads, respectively. Among all the pollution sources, farmland
    was the major contributor (2258.9 t·a−1.), mainly owing to the unreasonable fertilizer
    rate and long-term conventional tillage [22]. Among the four types of livestock,
    big livestock was the primary contributor (1404.9 t), followed by poultry (1187.7
    t), because of the improper management of animal feed and livestock manure. The
    major TP pollution sources differed from the major TN pollution sources. The main
    contributors of TP loads were rural living (351.65 t·a−1), followed by livestock
    (156.6 t·a−1) and land use (32.7 t·a−1), which account for 65%, 28.95%, and 6.05%
    of the TP loads, respectively. In recent years, the urbanization level in most
    parts of the studied watershed gradually increased, and the living standards of
    people continued to increase, resulting in rural living becoming the major contributor
    to the TP load. Table 3. NPS pollution load from various sources in 2014. 3.4.
    Validation of the Results from the PTRFFM Comparison with the monitoring data.
    The water quality monthly data of TN and TP, C (mg/L), as well as the monthly
    average runoff data, Q (mg/l), monitored by the Xiahui hydrological station at
    the watershed outlet, were utilized to estimate the TN and TP fluxes of the watershed
    𝐿 𝑜 . The pollutant flux data obtained from the Xiahui hydrological station were
    calibrated and validated by multiplying with water quality and runoff, based on
    the following calculation formula:  𝐿 𝑜 = ∑ 12 𝑖=1 10 −6 × 𝐶 𝑖 × 𝑄 𝑖 . The relative
    error Re was analyzed by comparing the simulated value L with the monitored value
    𝐿 𝑜 to assess the accuracy of the PTRFFM. 𝑅𝑒= 𝐿− 𝐿 𝑜 𝐿 𝑜 ×100% (15) The results
    demonstrated the effectiveness of the five-factor model based on the mechanism
    of the transport pathways of agricultural NPS pollutants (Table 4). In 2014, the
    fluxes of the TN and TP of the studied watershed were 570.86 t and 2.54 t, and
    the simulated values were 705.11 t and 3.16 t, respectively. The relative errors
    were less than 25%, 19.62% and 24.45%. The simulated values for TN and TP were
    both overestimated, probably because the interception, retardation, and attenuation
    effects of the pollutants after entering the watercourse were not considered in
    the PTRFFM. Table 4. Validation results of the five-factor model. Comparison with
    other relevant studies. To further verify the reliability of the model simulation
    results, some typical results from the literature on the NPS pollution path-through
    rate of China were reviewed (Table 5). For instance, according to Zhou et al.,
    the path-through rates of N and P in the Haihe watershed were 0.2 and 0.1, respectively.
    A field monitoring evaluation conducted in the Xinanjiang River Basin showed that
    the point source path-through rate was approximately 2–3 times that of the NPS
    path-through rate; the TN and TP path-through rates were 0.2 and 0.21, respectively
    [23]. Deng et al. studied the path-through rates of different NPS pollution sources
    in the Changle River Basin using the SWAT model and demonstrated that the atmospheric
    deposition of the NPS path-through rate of TN was 0.17, followed by nitrogen fertilizers
    (0.15), rural living (0.12), and livestock (0.03) [24]. Ma et al. utilized the
    pollutant load estimation method in the Laizhou Bay of the Yellow River Basin
    and discovered that the NPS path-through rate of TN for rural living was 0.17,
    followed by farmland (0.1) and livestock (0.07) [25]. Based on the analyses mentioned
    above, the results of the NPS path-through rate of TN in this study are similar
    to those of other studies. The NPS path-through rate of TP is lower compared with
    those of the other studies. This is probably because the studied watershed is
    in the North of China, which is characterized by inadequate annual rainfall. Moreover,
    phosphorus is mainly lost in the particulate form by soil erosion, and in the
    North of China, scarce rainfall leads to less soil erosion compared with other
    research areas with abundant rainfall. Table 5. Results of the other studies on
    the path-through rate of NPS pollutants in China. 3.5. Identification of the Critical
    Source Area of NPS Pollution A comprehensive analysis of the distribution of the
    NPS pollution load and the path-through rate was performed, and the critical source
    areas (CSA) with high risks of NPS pollution and high path-through rates were
    identified (Figure 6). The results demonstrated that Dage, Wudaoying, and Tuchengzi
    were critical TN source areas with path-through load intensities of 4.31 kg/ha,
    4.23 kg/ha, and 2.95 kg/ha, respectively. From the perspective of the path-through
    pollutant load, Dage, Wudaoying, and Tuchengzi only accounted for 22.09% of the
    studied area. Nevertheless, they contributed 57.16% of the TN amount discharged
    into water bodies. Figure 6. Spatial distribution characteristics of the path-through
    rate load of NPS pollutants. The upper and middle reaches of the studied watershed,
    namely Dage, Wudaoying, Heishanzui, and Tuchengzi, were CSAs of TP, where the
    path-through load intensity was 0.03–0.008 kg/ha. These four towns contributed
    1.37 t, 0.24 t, 0.25 t, and 0.28 t in 2014, accounting for 67.69% of the path-through
    pollutant load of TP. In summary, Dage, Wudaoying, and Tuchengzi should be considered
    for the placement of conservation practices for the effective and efficient implementation
    of watershed management. 4. Conclusions (1) The simulation accuracy of the PTRFFM
    model was acceptable. On the watershed scale, the TN and TP NPS pollutant loads
    from agriculture were 705.11 t and 3.16 t, respectively, in 2014. Meanwhile, the
    relative errors of the simulations were 19.62% and 24.45%, respectively. From
    the spatial distribution of the agricultural NPS, the TN and TP resource loads
    were mainly distributed among the upper reach towns of Dage, and lower reaches
    of Taishitun, Bakshiying, and Gaoling. The major source of TN load was farmland,
    which accounted for 47.6% of the TN load, followed by livestock (37.4%). As for
    the TP load, rural living was the primary source (65%). The path-through rate
    of the agricultural NPS pollutants was primarily distributed in Wudaoying, Dage,
    Tuchengzi, Anchungoumen, and Huodoushan, where the path-through rate of TN ranged
    from 0.17 to 0.26. However, the priority areas for the path-through rate of TP
    were distributed among Wudaoying, Kulongshan, Dage, and Tuchengzi, ranging from
    0.012 to 0.019. A comprehensive analysis of the distribution of the NPS pollution
    load and the path-through rate was performed. The results indicated that Dage,
    Wudaoying, and Tuchengzi were the CSA of agricultural NPS pollution; therefore,
    they should be considered for effective watershed management. (2) The spatial
    distribution characteristics of the path-through rate in the field scale could
    be obtained. Compared with other methods of estimating the path-through rate for
    NPS pollutants, such as field monitoring, the ECM, and the physical-based model,
    the PTRFFM could assess the path-through rates of NPS pollutants in the whole
    field, watershed, or sub-watershed. It was also able to accurately estimate the
    watershed path-through rate per unit area of spatial coordinates in the field
    scale. (3) The results can be scaled to watersheds with larger scales. Unlike
    the “black box” or “gray box” models, which facilitate the increase or decrease
    of the measurement parameters to reflect regional differences when applied to
    different regions, the five-factor model regards the transport pathways of NPS
    pollutants by obtaining a functional relationship between the corresponding typical,
    natural, and geographic parameters of the locations. Thus, the results of the
    five-factor model can be scaled to obtain the path-through rates for larger watersheds.
    In this study, the PTRFFM was developed by considering the pollutant production,
    surface runoff generation, leaching potential of soil moisture, and landscape
    interception in the given watershed. The model can be used as an effective tool
    to identify critical paths for NPS contamination transportation. In the future,
    to expand this method further, supplementary field monitoring should be performed.
    For example, the saturated water holding capacity of different soil types should
    be monitored to decrease the uncertainty of soil infiltration capacity differences
    among different areas. Future research is also required to establish new criteria
    and more efficient optimization techniques to identify the key parameters of NPS
    pollutants, such as the time lag index [26], and incorporate them into the PTRFFM
    to realize a better representation of the whole process of NPS pollutant transfer.

    IEEE Conference Location: Denver, CO, USA SECTION I. Introduction As wireless
    technologies are gaining a strong foothold in agriculture, more tasks can be accomplished
    through connected devices such as cameras, sensors, drones and robots, thus facilitating
    rapid access to reliable data in decision making which can have significant financial
    implications. This influx of connected devices available to farmers coupled with
    ag data analytics form precision agriculture. On average, the farmers spend a
    lot of their time monitoring crop development and analyzing how the crops respond
    to their crop management practices. With advanced wireless technologies, farmers
    can remotely observe the development of their crops without being in the field.
    Timely periodical reports summarizing data collected from a variety of sensors
    monitoring the fluctuation of soil moisture, tree foliage, temperature, nitrogen,
    humidity, pH, CO2 can be forwarded to a Farm Management System through radio links.
    While these substantial advances in farming aim at assisting farmers in maintaining
    good crop growing conditions, they also enable farmers to predict and prevent
    plant diseases, detect bugs, geolocate the right parcels that will help to optimize
    yields, decide which fertilizers to use, control irrigation systems, and develop
    new agricultural practices. Advanced agricultural practices coupled with IoT-based
    technology [1],[2] aim at growing crops in controlled environments in order to
    enhance yields. With the recent advances in genetic improvement via breeding,
    phenotyping is emerging as a promising crop engineering based technique in agriculture.
    Phenotyping is the process of analyzing traits to select more productive and less
    input-demanding genotypes. High-resolution RGB imaging enables the identification
    of favorable phenotypic traits (e.g., leaf arrangement) and thus more productive
    genotypes. Implantable plant nanosensors not only enable breeders to identify
    hybrids requiring less agricultural inputs but also enable farmers to optimize
    functions such as fertilization and irrigation. The selection of an appropriate
    wireless technology depends on agricultural application requirements. For instance,
    some applications may require low data rate and low energy consumption (e.g.,
    sensor-based measurements) while others will require high data rates and can accommodate
    more power consumption (e.g., video streaming). For the connectivity between sensors,
    Zigbee is typically used for short range communications, Bluetooth Low-Energy
    (BLE) for applications that have low-power requirements, LoRa for applications
    with low data rates and long range requirements, and narrowband technology (e.g.,
    NB-IoT, SigFox) for applications where a large number of sensors transmit a small
    amount of data at the same time. For long-range communications between in-field
    devices (wireless sensors, UAVs, robots) and the Cloud, existing solutions employ
    LTE or WiFi. LTE does not scale well since it involves a subscription fee which
    can be costly for large farms [3]. As for WiFi, signals operating in the 2. 4GHz
    band may suffer from attenuation, scattering, absorption and diffraction caused
    by vegetation [4]. IEEE ratified the 802.11af standard also known as TVWS that
    uses spare channels in the low frequency radio spectrum traditionally allocated
    to television: 470MHz to 698MHz (UHF and VHF bands). One advantage of the TVWS
    band is an extended range of 10 to 15 km, or more in good conditions (up to 30
    km in flat terrain). Signals at TVWS band can more easily spread over rugged areas,
    through forests or buildings, where higher-frequency signals experience interference.
    Thus, TVWS communication is ideal in near-line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight
    scenarios. Another benefit is that only TV signals are potential interferers.
    Because TVWS uses lower frequencies that can penetrate obstacles and enable the
    use of applications with different bandwidth requirements [3], it is an appealing
    candidate for smart agriculture. However, only a few TVWS measurement campaigns
    exist and they have only focused on rural [5] and indoor environments [6]. Assessing
    TVWS performance in harsh agricultural settings has yet to be done. In this paper,
    we present a measurement campaign of TVWS wireless channels at Curtiss Farm, a
    research farm located in Ames, Iowa, USA. We deploy an end-to-end TVWS network
    between the farm office and the fields, and perform an extensive measurement study
    of TVWS channels by taking into consideration antennas’ placement, variations
    of temperature and humidity, crop diversity (soybean vs. corn), height and density
    of corn fields. Some past studies analyzed the impact of crops [7],[8],[9] and
    the impact of weather [10],[11],[12] on the signal propagation. However, they
    focused exclusively on IEEE 802.15.4 WSNs. To date, there is no comprehensive
    study of TVWS in such agricultural settings. This measurement campaign provides
    unique insight into the spatiotemporal behaviour of TVWS channels in corn fields.
    Particularly, the contributions from our measurement campaign are as follows:
    We perform a detailed real-world measurement analysis of the spatiotemporal behaviour
    of TVWS channels subject to a variety of environmental factors such as weather
    components, antenna heights, crop varieties, crop densities and distance from
    the TVWS Access Point. We measure Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), Received
    Signal Strength (RSS), Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), noise and throughput using
    actual OpenWrt-based TVWS radios from HuWoMobility, and we assess how aforementioned
    metrics are impacted by environmental factors. Representative key findings of
    this study are summarized in Table I. We investigate which path loss model is
    most applicable to TVWS in agricultural environments according to the empirical
    path loss computed for different antenna heights. We find out that, when antennas
    are close to the ground, the path loss is better modeled by the Okumura-Hata (suburban)
    path loss model, and, for higher antenna heights, it is better modeled by the
    Plane Earth path loss model. TABLE I 95% Confidence Intervals of the Impact of

    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II we take a look at
    the current context and environment in which this measurement campaign was conducted.
    Then, Section III covers the methodology and tools used for this study. The measurement
    results are presented and analyzed in Section IV. Finally, we conclude this study
    by a summary on our key findings in Section V. SECTION II. Preliminaries CyNet
    wireless living lab. CyNet [13] is an end-to-end software-defined cyberinfrastructure
    integrating advanced field-deployed wireless networks for agriculture and transportation
    research. It is a joint effort between the ISU Department of Electrical and Computer
    Engineering (ECE), ISU Institute for Transportation (InTrans) and ISU Plant Science
    Institute (PSI). Due to its wireless resource virtualization through whole-stack
    slicing [14], it is an ideal platform for prototyping and deploying new PHY and
    MAC layers in the field, as well as Predictable, Reliable, Real-time, and high-Throughput
    (PRRT) algorithms for research and education in smart agriculture and smart transportation.
    CyNet consists of two cellular RANs deployed at the Iowa State University (ISU)
    Curtiss Research Farm and Research Park in the City of Ames, Iowa, USA. Each RAN
    targets a specific use case: the former is aimed at smart agriculture while the
    later is aimed at smart transportation. The Curtiss Research Farm RAN is composed
    of LTE and TVWS technologies. This study focuses on the TVWS technology. CyNet
    agriculture use case. The ISU Plant Science Institute (PSI) is a leader in plant
    phenotyping, genotyping, and nanosensors. In recent years, Schnable’s team and
    their collaborators have deployed Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) with high-definition
    cameras, ∼ 100 implantable nitrate sensors and ∼ 1,000 stationary cameras for
    phenotype analysis in the ISU Curtiss Research Farm (see Figure 1). Each camera
    records an image of an individual row of 6 corn plants every 5 minutes and each
    sensor records a reading every 10 seconds. In the current solar-powered deployment,
    the cameras and sensors are controlled by Raspberry Pi single board microcomputers,
    and the Raspberry Pis are connected to a field-deployed server via WiFi Access
    Points. The server collects, renames, and stores photos on a local hard drive.
    The server also displays information about the system’s health, to help diagnose
    any potential problems with the system. As part of the connectivity use cases,
    interconnecting the in-field PSI server to the farm to access and analyse data
    anytime, anywhere is crucial. Fig. 1: Stationary field cameras for phenotype analysis
    Show All In-field TVWS Radio Access Network. To establish connectivity between
    different in-field devices (UAVs, UGVs, cameras) and the farm office, we have
    secured an FCC experimental license in the TVWS spectrum bands. A 18m pole has
    also been installed at Curtiss Farm, and it is equipped with TVWS Access Points,
    Tower Mounted Boosters (TMBs), directional and omnidirectional antennas in order
    to provide connectivity from the farm office to the in-field devices. An overview
    of the in-field TVWS network is presented in Figure 2. Fig. 2: CyNet TVWS network
    Show All The in-field TVWS network considered in this study is composed of two
    TVWS devices: The TVWS AP (Access Point) mounted on the 18 m pole is plugged to
    directional antennas as depicted in Figure 3. This TVWS AP is connected to a Cisco
    Catalyst switch in an enclosure inside the farm office. The switch interconnects
    the farm to the ISU Durham data center through an optical backhaul link. The TVWS
    CPE (Customer Premise Equipment) is used to cover several location points for
    measurement data collection. It is connected through SMA cables to 2×2 MIMO antennas
    and through Ethernet to a Dell Laptop that runs an automation script sending probes
    to the TVWS AP and storing measurements for further analysis. SECTION III. Methodology
    In this section we discuss the rationale behind the selection of in-field location
    points, the devices used during the measurement campaign along with their configurations,
    the spatial coverage of the TVWS directional antennas and the relevance of the
    metrics collected to characterize the TVWS channel quality. Finally, we describe
    the tools and overall process used to conduct all the measurements. A. In-field
    location points Figure 4 shows the probed area in Curtiss Farm. The map indicates
    the location points denoted by LPX. We carefully selected the location points
    that exhibit high diversities such as crop type, crop density, and crop height.
    To demonstrate the impact of crop types on channel quality, we picked pairs of
    location points close to each other where one is within a corn field and the other
    in a soybean field (i.e., LP25-LP26, LP10-LP11). Due to space limitations, this
    paper focuses only on a representative subset of the location points listed in
    Table II. Specifically, those location points have been selected for their diverse
    characteristics such as their distance to the TVWS AP, the crop type, the density
    and height of the corn plants, and whether or not they are in the line-of-sight
    of the TVWS AP. One notable exception is the group composed of LP12 and LP13.
    Those location points are close to the corn field but not inside, instead they
    are on the roadside obstructed by tree leaves. Fig. 3: TVWS AP mounted on pole
    (red-circled) and TVWS bow-tie antennas (blue-boxed) facing the field Show All
    B. NWS system TVWS devices. We carry out our TVWS measurement campaign with HuWoMobility
    HL3210 TVWS devices. Those TVWS devices use an integrated Qualcomm Atheros QCA9533
    System-On-Chip and their TVWS configuration is shown in Table III. Two TVWS APs
    have been installed at the Farm Site, each being connected through jumper cables
    to directional bow-tie antennas. In this study, we use the TVWS AP that is connected
    to antennas pointing to the farm fields. Since we had CLI access through SSH to
    the TVWS devices operating under OpenWrt, we create a set of automation scripts
    that automatically collect metrics with the desired sampling frequencies to be
    discussed shortly. TVWS antennas. The two TVWS antennas used at the AP are bow-tie
    antennas, mounted on the pole, facing the fields. They have a 14dB gain with a
    60 o horizontal beamwidth. The omnidirecitonal antennas used at the CPE also have
    a 14dB gain. The distance between the antennas is λ 0 2 (i.e.: 1 2 wavelength)
    where λ 0 is the free space wavelength obtained by the following formula: λ 0
    = c 0 f where c0 is the speed of light in free space (i.e.: 3× 10 8 m/s ) and
    f the frequency (i.e.: 578MHz). Hence, the separation between the two MIMO antennas
    is ∼26cm . TABLE II Selected Location Points In Curtiss Farm TABLE III TVWS Parameters
    C. Automation scripts for data collection In order to minimize in-field time and
    collect as much data as possible, we implement automation scripts that collect
    on-the-fly average and per-antenna metrics for each location point. All the metrics
    are collected when UDP traffic is transmitted/received in the background with
    the iperf tool. To probe a particular location point, we start the main script
    from the laptop connected to the TVWS CPE. The main script instructs the TVWS
    CPE to start recording iperf throughput measurements of the TVWS link with a sampling
    interval of 100 ms. Then, the main script spawns a remote shell instance on the
    TVWS AP which collects average link quality statistics such as Noise, RSSI (Received
    Signal Strength Indicator) and SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) available from the
    CLI frontend iwinfo. Finally, another shell instance is spawned on the TVWS CPE
    that collects per-antenna Noise, RSSI and SNR gathered by the Atheros kernel driver
    (ath9k) debug traces. Fig. 4: Location Points in Curtiss Farm fields Show All
    Those channel metrics help to characterize spatiotemporal behaviour of the TVVWS
    channels. The script collects the following channel metrics: Average MIMO SNR
    and per-antenna SNR: indicator of link reliability between the AP and CPE; Average
    MIMO RSSI and per-antenna RSSI: received signal power at CPE side; Noise power:
    quantifies the amount of noise on the channel. End-to-end performance metrics
    are also collected. They include downlink throughput and packet loss at the CPE
    along with delay and jitter of the TVWS link. D. Data collection process This
    measurement campaign has been conducted during the summer of 2019 (July-August
    period) before the harvest season in September-October. This was the period where
    most of the plants were tall with a high water content, regardless of the corn
    variety. Since we had a wet summer in 2019, there was no drought stressed plants.
    The corn fields and soybean fields were either composed of commercial or experimental
    hybrid plants. Experimental corn plants were planted much denser than commercial
    ones. In order to obtain reliable data that account for diverse factors (e.g.,
    humidity, temperature), we repeated data collection several times at each location
    point during the early morning, when the humidity was high (~90%) and the temperature
    between 11− 14 ∘ C , and during the early afternoon, when the humidity was ~60%
    and the temperature between 28− 30 ∘ C . Plants contain more water during morning
    hours than during the afternoon, and the soil moisture does not vary much during
    daytime. As part of this study, we analyze the effect of changing the MIMO antenna
    height of the TVWS CPE. Figure 5 shows a 214 cm fiberglass ladder that we used
    during the measurement campaign. For each location point and time of day, we collected
    data for different antenna heights: when antennas are located at the bottom (∼20
    cm above the ground), in the middle ( ∼110 cm above the ground) and on top of
    the ladder ( ∼214 cm above the ground). Each measurement runs for a duration of
    4 minutes. We captured one sample every 100 ms for the throughput and one sample
    every 20 ms for other metrics. In total, we collected 232 MB of raw data. Fig.
    5: MIMO antennas mounted of top of the ladder Show All SECTION IV. Measurements
    and Results A. Impact of weather We begin by considering the impact of temperature
    on the TVWS RSS, SNR and noise. The RSS (Received Signal Strength) is different
    from the RSSI and is computed as follows: RSS = RSSI - noise [dBm]. For this first
    set of measurements, we focus on one pair of location points (LP25-LP26), one
    in the corn field composed of commercial corn and the other one in the soybean
    field composed of commercial soybeans. The choice of these location points is
    motivated by the fact that they are in the LOS of the pole antennas, exhibit dense
    foliage and high density. Thus, we end up collecting data during morning and daytime
    for different CPE antenna heights in order to assess the impact of weather components
    (i.e., temperature and humidity) and antenna height variability on link quality.
    This analysis allows us to determine if temperature and humidity have a significant
    impact depending on multiple factors. Here we present the data for the location
    point LP25 in a dense corn field where corn plants are 2.5 m tall, located 474m
    away from the TVWS AP. Similar behavior has been observed for LP26 in a dense
    soybean field composed of 30cm tall commercial soybean plants; details can be
    found in the technical report [15]. Fig. 6: Impact of humidity and temperature
    on RSS at LP25. Show All Figure 6a and Figure 6b show the temporal behaviour of
    the RSS in the early morning when the temperature is around 12 ∘ C and the humidity
    slightly above 90% and in the afternoon (i.e., Daytime) when the temperature is
    around 29 ∘ C and the humidity below 60%. In the early morning, the mean RSS is
    -94.8dBm when MIMO antennas are on top of the ladder, -97.6dBm when antennas are
    located at mid height of the ladder and 113 dBm when antennas are located just
    20 cm above the ground. Consequently, the RSS increases when the antenna height
    increases. In the early afternoon, the RSS is negatively impacted by the rise
    in temperature. This negative correlation between RSS and temperature was also
    observed for IEEE 802.15.4 links in the ISM bands [11] and for indoor sensors
    using sub-GHz bands [12]. In both cases (morning and daytime), we notice that
    the RSS increases with the antenna height but not proportionally to the relative
    height. This can be explained by the fact that the signal suffers from a greater
    attenuation at Ground and Mid antenna heights due to the presence of corn biomass
    surrounding the antennas. Fig. 7: Average SNR and Noise at LP25: SNR decreases
    with humidity while noise increases with humidity. Show All Conversely, while
    the RSS dropped for all antenna heights in the afternoon, Figure 7a shows that
    the SNR increases when the temperature increases for all antenna heights. This
    is because the noise decreases when temperature increases as depicted in Figure
    7b. We observe this trend at other location points as well, independently of the
    crop type. Figure 8 clearly shows that temperature and humidity have a stronger
    impact than antenna height variability on TVWS RSS. Moreover, in the morning,
    the density plot width is reduced especially outside the interquartile range.
    Interestingly, the RSS measured during daytime exhibits similar distribution shapes
    for all antenna heights, with RSS values being concentrated around the lower and
    upper adjacent values (i.e., first and third quartile). In the morning, the major
    RSS gap between Ground and Mid antenna height is due to the high humidity that
    induces a higher corn leaf water content. Therefore, the high concentration of
    water molecules on leaves surrounding antennas close to the ground tends to attenuate
    the signal. Fig. 8: RSS distribution and probability density for LP25. Show All
    B. Impact of tree foliage The south of Curtiss Farm is bordered by a forest composed
    of trees with dense foliage. Due to the height of those trees, we will be able
    to see how performance are impacted in NLOS scenarios for different antenna heights.
    Roadside location points (LP12-LP13). The pair of location points LP12-LP13 along
    the roadside are located 563 m and 370 m from the TVWS AP, respectively. They
    are in NLOS due to the heavy tree foliage along the roadside. At LP12, a dense
    foliage obstructs the line-of-sight while at LP13 the foliage is less dense but
    the ladder is close to the tree. We investigate the temporal behaviour of the
    RSS in Figure 9a and Figure 9b. For the sake of readability the curves have been
    smoothed out, but the fluctuations can be seen in Figure 10 that shows a side-by-side
    comparison of LP12-LP13 RSS distribution. From Figure 9b, we observe that for
    LP13, the RSS margin between Ground and Top antenna height is relatively small
    (i.e.: 4 dBm). LP13 exhibits an average RSS of-111 dBm, -114dBm, -115dBm at Top,
    Mid and Ground antenna height, respectively. Since the foliage is equally dense
    from Ground to Top but present small gaps at Top antenna height, there is no significant
    gains from placing the antennas on top of the ladder. While the signal is stronger
    at Top antenna height, it fluctuates a lot as shown by the wide interquartile
    range in Figure 10. At LP12, a section of the tree is directly obstructing the
    line-of-sight at Ground and Mid antenna height. This clearly impacts the received
    signal: the average RSS for Top antenna height is -117dBm while for Mid and Ground
    antenna height it ranges between -123dBm and -124dBm, which is a 7 dBm RSS margin.
    Figure 11 shows the average SNR at LP12 and LP13. The SNR at LP12 for Ground and
    Mid antennas is poor (i.e.: below 5dB). The SNR doubles when antennas are located
    on top of the ladder. As for LP13, the average SNR is comprised between 14 dB
    and 18 dB which indicates that a decent link quality can be expected even under
    tree foliage obstruction. Fig. 9: Impact of tree foliage on RSS at LP12-LP13.
    Show All Fig. 10: RSS distribution at LP12-LP13: LP13’s RSS oscillates between
    -128 and -109dBm due to the presence of dense foliage at Top antenna height. Show
    All Fig. 11: Average SNR at LP12-LP13. Show All Throughput fluctuations in Figure
    12 confirms the previous observations. At LP12, the average throughput is of 18.1
    Mbps for Top antenna height and of 0.19 Mbps and 0.79 Mbps for Ground and Mid
    antenna height, respectively. At LP13, the stable RSS and decent average SNR of
    Mid antenna height translate to a stable temporal behaviour of the throughput
    and an average throughput of 14.6 Mbps. At Top antenna height, the average throughput
    is 21 Mbps. Due to the close proximity of antennas and tree foliage, the throughput
    exhibits rapid fluctuations over time. Finally, at Ground antenna height the throughput
    remains stable around 2.31 Mbps. Fig. 12: Downlink throughput at LP12 and LP13.
    Show All C. Impact of crop type In order to capture the TVWS channel behaviour
    for different crop types (corn, soybean), we collect measurements for the pair
    of location points LP10-LP11 which are located more than 800 m from the TVWS AP.
    LP10 is located in a moderately dense corn field with tall corn plants, and LPII
    is located in a dense soybean field. They are located at 830 m and 822 m from
    the TVWS AP, respectively. Figure 13 presents the RSSI of MIMO antennas. As we
    can notice for Antenna 1, the RSSI gap between Mid and Ground antenna height is
    of 10 dBm at LP10, much more that the gap between Mid and Ground antenna height
    at LPII. We also notice for Ground antenna height that the RSSI at LP10 is 10
    dBm weaker than the one at LPII. We can infer that the thickness of corn has a
    negative influence on the radio signal, the attenuation is less important for
    soybean plants even though they tend to be much more concentrated as the distance
    along row and the distance between rows is much smaller than that of corn plants.
    Interestingly, we observe different trends between antennas: Antenna 0 exhibits
    more fluctuations and a weaker RSSI regardless of the antenna height which highlights
    the importance of antenna placement. In Table IV we can notice that the RSSI standard
    deviation is higher at Ground antenna height and that the RSSI standard deviation
    decreases with antenna height for both LP10 and LPII. Fig. 13: RSSI of MIMO antennas
    at LP10 and LPII. Show All TABLE IV Per-Antenna RSSI Standard Deviation At LP10
    and LP11. In Figure 15, it is worth mentioning that the throughput for the corn
    field at LP10 shows more fluctuations over time than the throughput for the soybean
    field at LPII. Especially at Top antenna height, we can notice a strong deviation
    from the mean throughput over time. Fig. 14: Average SNR at LP10 and LPII. Show
    All Fig. 15: Downlink throughput at LP10 and LPII. Show All D. Impact of crop
    density Dense vs Sparse corn field (LP4-LP5). To show the impact of corn density
    on TVWS performance, we select the pair of location points LP4-LP5. They are located
    at 1.086 km and 1.074 km from the TVWS AP, respectively. LP4 is located inside
    the field where the density is high. On the other hand LP5 is located in a path
    in-between two rows of corn plants (i.e.: low density). Figure 16 shows the per-antenna
    RSSI of both location points. Even though TVWS has superior penetration characteristics
    than WiFi, the penetration loss is exacerbated when the signal has to penetrate
    through the trunks and kernels of mature corn plants. Therefore, due to the high
    corn density at LP4, the signal was lost when antennas were located close to the
    ground. At LP4, we notice an important gap of 10 dBm between Ground and Top antenna
    height for Antenna 1. There is also a 10 dBm difference between LP4 (i.e.: -76dBm)
    and LP5 (i.e.:-66dBm) RSSI at Mid antenna height. The RSSI gap is reduced at Top
    antenna height where LP4 exhibits an RSSI of -66dBm and LP5 of -60dBm. Similarly
    to LP10-LP11, we witness lower RSSI values for Antenna 0 and a less significant
    gap between antenna heights. Fig. 16: RSSI of MIMO antennas at LP4 and LP5. Show
    All Table V shows once again that the RSSI standard deviation is stronger in the
    presence of dense vegetation and that it decreases with antenna height. TABLE
    V Per-Antenna RSSI Standard Deviation At LP4 and LP5. SNR results are shown in
    Figure 17. At top antenna height, LP5 SNR is 2.07 dB higher that the SNR at LP4,
    and at Mid antenna height it is 3.21 dB higher than the SNR at LP4, confirming
    the link quality degradation due to high corn density. Fig. 17: Average SNR at
    LP4 and LP5. Show All The performance metrics collected in Table VI for LP4 and
    LP5 also reflect the SNR discrepancies. Propagation at LP4 is dominated by scattering,
    thus the signal amplitude decreases with crop density. Performance measured at
    LP4 are on average 41% worse than LP5 due to corn plant penetration. Still, LP4
    exhibits a throughput that is sufficient to accommodate video streaming at Top
    antenna height. The throughput for LP4 and LP5 is shown in Figure 18. At LP4 for
    Top antenna height, even though the throughput reaches 20 Mbps, it oscillates
    frequently between 3 Mbps and 20 Mbps. At LP5 on the other hand, the throughput
    is more stable toward the mean value of 20.7 Mbps. TABLE VI LP4-LP5 Performance
    Metrics. Fig. 18: Downlink throughput at LP4 and LP5. The signal is lost at Ground
    antenna height for LP4. Show All Results collected for the pair LP22-LP23 can
    be found in the technical report [15]. We summarize collected measurements (RSS,
    RSSI and SNR) in Table VII for each antenna height. The table also includes measurements
    for distant location points LP2 (corn) and LP3 (soybean). E. NWS empirical path
    loss Since path loss depends on antenna height, distance, and frequency, we compare
    the empirical TVWS path loss measured at Curtiss Farm with existing path loss
    models to see which existing model best predicts the loss of TVWS systems in agricultural
    settings. We select well-known path loss models typically used in wireless mobile
    communications such as Plane Earth, Okumura-Hata for open and suburban environments
    and COST231-Hata. Compared to the free-space path loss model, the plane earth
    model includes the effect of ground reflection. Okumura-Hata is a widely used
    propagation model and its correction factor for suburban environments targets
    terrains with trees and houses. The COST231-Hata model is an extension of the
    Okumura-Hata model and is aimed at urban environments with CPE antenna heights
    up to 10 m and AP antenna heights between 30 m and 200 m. Figure 19 shows the
    empirical path loss for Ground antenna height. Since the loss at Ground antenna
    height is mainly due to ground reflection and vegetation (trunks, kernels, stems)
    the Okumura-Hata model for suburban environments approximately models the TVWS
    empirical path loss measured at Curtiss Farm. On the other hand, at Top antenna
    height (Figure 20), the empirical path loss is better modeled by the Plane Earth
    model. TABLE VII Average RSS, RSSI and SNR Measurements of Location Points For
    Each Antenna Height. Fig. 19: Empirical path loss (Ground antenna height). Show
    All Fig. 20: Empirical path loss (Top antenna height). Show All SECTION V. Conclusion
    This paper explored the impact of farm crops on the spatiotemporal behaviour of
    TVWS channels. We observed that while the SNR is negatively correlated with humidity,
    noise and RSS are positively correlated with humidity. While humidity can be beneficial
    to the RSS for long distances beyond 1 km, it can be detrimental to the TVWS performance
    at short distances if either the TVWS CPE Rx gain or the TVWS AP transmit power
    are not controlled. Moreover, the per-antenna RSSI standard deviation decreases
    with antenna height which indicates that the link suffers less from RSSI fluctuations
    when MIMO antennas are distant from the ground. Notably, crop diversity tends
    to influence the signal propagation. The thickness of trunks/stems played only
    a minor role in signal attenuation. However, factors such as crop density and
    tree foliage depth have a stronger negative impact on TVWS performance than crop
    trunk thickness. This measurement campaign also highlights that the antenna height
    has a positive influence on TVWS performance if the TVWS system lies in a steady-state
    regime where the received signal is not too strong. Even though fading and scattering
    affect the TVWS performance, throughput beyond 30 Mbps can be achieved intermittently
    in harsh agricultural conditions. Finally, we show that, when MIMO antennas are
    placed close to the ground, the Okumura-Hata model for suburban environments can
    be utilize to predict the pass loss of TVWS systems in crop farms, while for 7-feet
    antenna height the plane earth model is the best candidate to predict the path
    loss. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like This Temperature

    wireless sensor networks (WSN) have been implemented with great acceptance and
    success. This kind of technology aids in the reduction of water consumption and
    the use of pesticides and fertilizers, as well as favoring the preservation of
    ecosystem. Additionally, it allows generating alerts about the arrival of frost,
    floods, fires, etc. Precision agriculture covers multiple practices related to
    the management of crops, trees, flowers, plants, livestock, among others [1].
    In this sense, an important agricultural sector in our country, such as coffee,
    can work closely with technology and provide a new vision and projection towards
    agricultural productivity. On the other hand, it can generate innumerable benefits
    destined to increase the performance of production processes and optimize the
    final result of the harvested products. Among the most interesting applications
    of precision agriculture is pest and disease control. By means of strategically
    located sensors, a number of parameters can be monitored, such as temperature,
    relative humidity, soil moisture, leaf temperature and humidity, and solar radiation,
    among others, in order to quickly detect adverse situations and establish early
    treatments. The great advantage of using this technology is early detection and
    the optimal application of pesticides only in areas where it is really necessary
    [2]. However, like all crops, coffee is exposed to a set of environmental variables
    such as temperature, soild type, air humidity, rain, and the wind index, in addition
    to pests such as the drill bit and rust, which end up affecting grain quality
    and production [3]. Colombia is known for producing the best soft coffee in the
    world. One of the statistics that most worries coffee growers and the guilds in
    charge of their commercialization are grain exports. If you look at the last year
    in coffee production (as of March, 2020), Colombia reached 14.3 million bags.
    Likewise, The Federation’s statistics show that when comparing the periods from
    October, 2018 to March, 2019 with October, 2019 to March, 2020, which corresponds
    to a section of the coffee year, the harvest is 6% higher. “From the point of
    view of the price of coffee, we are in a historical moment, but with some important
    challenges in the harvest, which implies what will come in the future on the subject
    of coffee with the arrival of this pandemic”, Added Vélez, who stressed that,
    in the midst of the quarantine, the consumption of this product in Colombian households
    has increased by 25% [4]. Currently, with information and communication technologies,
    significant advances have been made in the collection, analysis and distribution
    of information related to the state of the weather, monitoring of environmental
    variables, and biodiversity studies, among others. This information has different
    purposes, such as the digital preservation of data, its graphic representation,
    and the modeling of weather patterns. Some initiatives focus on improving the
    people’s quality of life by obtaining and estimating factors that affect the human
    environment, for example, infrastructure and transportation, agriculture, and
    data on the biodiversity of the observed site, among others [5]. That is why there
    are innumerable drawbacks when optimizing harvesting and production processes,
    since this sector has not received the necessary attention for many years. Our
    country has great agricultural potential, but government support is scarce or
    nonexistent, in addition to other factors such as the high price of inputs and
    fertilizers and the high rates at which money is lent to coffee growers. These
    conditions end up discouraging investment in grain harvesting and cultivation
    processes. Therefore, it becomes evident that, with the rise of new technologies,
    industrial processes in fields such as agriculture can be improved and automated.
    Taking the landscape described above as reference, a collection of data on the
    main environmental variables that are significant in the cultivation of coffee
    in a specific land area is proposed. This is carried out by means of a wireless
    sensor network (WSN Through a wireless sensor network (WSN). Then, later said
    data will be uploaded to a cloud computing platform (Ubidots), where the data
    sent by the sensor nodes will be received. As a final stage, the data will be
    uploaded through CSV files generated by Ubidots to the BigML platform, where a
    supervised learning model will be applied to evaluate said information using decision
    trees. This valuable information will allow coffee growers to establish and predict
    the behavior of environmental variables such as temperature, soil moisture, and
    relative humidity, in order to make decisions regarding the allowed parameters
    vs. the collected information, in addition to considering said information as
    danger factors in the development of diseases or factors that represent hazards
    to crops and that have a direct impact on processes like harvesting and the preservation
    of natural resources. Materials and methods Research methodology For the development
    of this research, the following phases have been proposed: Design and configuration
    of the WSN: In this phase, the logical and physical design of the sensor network
    is carried out. In the logical design phase, the network design is designed according
    to the selected topology, a star, in this case, since it is the most efficient
    topology with a fast implementation speed. Next, in the physical design phase,
    each of the devices will be located in their designated place. Finally, the configuration
    of each of the sensor nodes with their respective measurement and communication
    elements is carried out; the Gateway and the base station are configured to act
    as intermediaries between the data sent by the sensors and the cloud platform.
    Collecting and sending data: The data collection tests will be carried out through
    the different nodes and its sensors. The data is then sent to the Gateway and
    from there to the base station. Thus, the continuity of the information and the
    appropriate format are verified. Sending data to the IoT platform: The data is
    sent from the base station to the Ubidots platform. Uploading data to the Machine
    Learning Platform: Once the data is uploaded to the Ubidots platform, a CVS file
    is downloaded which contains the information sent by the sensor nodes. This file
    is uploaded to the BigML machine learning platform, and it will be our input for
    data analysis phase. Data transformation and model application: Once the CSV file
    is loaded on the BigML platform, the dataset is created. Then, a field is taken
    as a pivot to serve as reference for the model, and the supervised model is applied
    through classification with decision trees. The model is then launched, and the
    confidence percentage associated with the predictive model is evaluated. Finally,
    we determine whether the model meets the initial expectations. Fig. 1 shows the
    phases in which the research has been structured. Figure 1: Phases of the research
    proposed for the development of the project Architectural design of the system
    A WSN is a network consisting of distributed autonomous devices, which uses different
    kinds of sensors to monitor physical or environmental conditions. This kind of
    system incorporates a Gateway, which provides wireless connectivity as a complement
    of wired networks and distributed nodes. The selected wireless protocol depends
    on the application requirements. Some of the available standards include 2,4 GHz
    radios based on IEEE 802.15.4 or IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) standards or proprietary
    radios, which are regularly 900 MHz [6]. The proposed architecture for the development
    of the WSN system consists of three sensor nodes [7], each consisting of a Lucy
    3 programmable card, connected to temperature, environmental humidity, and soil
    humidity sensors. These nodes is at a distance of 100 m from each other, covering
    a total area of 300 m2 of coffee cultivation. The nodes also communicate wirelessly
    through the ZigBee protocol with the Xbee modules. The architecture of the proposed
    system can be seen in Fig. 2 The Gateway is responsible for coordinating and communicating
    the sensor nodes with the base station through the 802.3 standard. Finally, the
    data collected by the sensors is sent to a central unit or base, where it will
    then be uploaded to the cloud platform (Ubidots), which is in charge of receiving
    the information from the base station to store and processing it. Subsequently,
    a CSV file is downloaded from the platform. This input is uploaded to the BigML
    platform, where it will go to the information analysis phase and the application
    of the supervised learning model, which will allow decision-making regarding the
    behavior of the environmental variables in the crop and their respective corrective
    measures. Table I shows the different measurement ranges of the TEGR-101 soil
    moisture sensor [8]. Table I: Dryness or humidity conditions measured by the TEGR-101
    soil moisture sensor. For the communication section between sensor nodes and the
    Gateway, we found several standards that meet the necessary characteristics and
    conditions, but the ZigBee 802.15.4 protocol or standard was selected, mostly
    due to economic factors. The ZigBee Alliance (ZigBee Alliance) [9] consists of
    an association of industries that work together to develop standards and products.
    ZigBee is the name of the specification for a set of high-level wireless communication
    protocols for use in low-consumption digital broadcasting applications based on
    the IEEE 802.15.4 standard for wireless personal area networks Network or WPAN).
    ZigBee technology is integrated into a wide range of products and applications
    for commercial, industrial, and government consumers. The implementation of the
    WSN will be carried out in a 300 m2 area of a coffee crop in El Cortijo farm,
    located in the town of Pueblo Tapao, a district of Armenia (Quindío). Table II
    shows the description and physical characteristics of the terrain. Table II: Physical
    description of the farmland. Internet of things and machine learning platforms
    For the development of this research we used two Internet platforms with different
    purposes: Ubidots, an Internet of Things (IoT) platform in charge of managing
    the information received by each of the sensor nodes. The BigML platform, a machine
    learning platform, in charge of receiving the data in a CSV file, transforming
    the loaded data into its own DataSet for a subsequent analysis through the application
    of a supervised model, namely a classification model based on decision trees.
    Ubidots (IoT platform) Ubidots is a production-ready cloud for data collection,
    analysis, and visualization. This platform has advantages that make it stand out
    from the rest. Among the main features, there is an API and protocols that can
    be connected from any hardware to the Ubidots cloud through HTTP, MQTT, TCP, UDP
    or Parse (custom protocol). Regarding the presentation board, data can be analyzed
    in real time because the platform creates pictures. Therefore, the devices and
    the information they collect can be controlled. Additionally, the platform has
    a user management feature, which helps organize permissions and restrictions depending
    on the operator or end user. Other features are sensor communication (input/output),
    API creation, extended monitoring, and data analysis of API applications of all
    kinds. On the other hand, its data storage depends on the acquired plan, back-end
    possibilities, and daily visualization of the stored data. The data output is
    called scheduled reports and is delivered in PDF or Excel formats. A delivery
    can be scheduled for anyone who needs it. In Fig. 3, the different services offered
    by the Ubidots platform are shown [10]. Figure 3: Services offered by the Ubidots
    platform. BigML platform This working environment offers a platform to build and
    share datasets and models in the form of machine learning as a service (MLaaS).
    Consequently, BigML is a proposal to make machine learning understandable to users.
    BigML manages to exploit the benefits of existing cloud solutions. For example,
    it allows data import from AWS S3, MS Azure, Google Storage, Google Drive, Dropbox,
    etc., which benefits developers because public cloud infrastructures could have
    become a basic need, that is to say, a solution for the providers of various services.
    Also, as it is solely focused on machine learning, BigML offers a comprehensive
    set of features, all well integrated within an interface where the user can load
    datasets, train and evaluate models, and generate new predictions, one by one
    or in batches. It contains a wide gallery of datasets and free models to probe,
    organized in categories, in addition to being accessible to the public. It also
    contains algorithms for Educational Clues, as well as grouping and selection to
    create high-quality models [11]. In Fig. 4 the data transformation process can
    be observed. Figure 4: Process of loading and transforming data on the BigML Machine
    learning models Machine learning [12] involves coding models that automatically
    adjust performance to agree with the presented data. This kind of learning is
    achieved through a model where the parameters are automatically adjusted according
    to certain performance criteria. Machine learning can be considered a subfield
    of artificial intelligence (AI), and it can be classified into the following application
    models: Supervised learning: it consists of algorithms that learn from a set of
    training examples, to generalize and label all possible inputs to the set. As
    technical examples in supervised learning, we have logistic regression, support
    vector machines, decision trees, random forest, etc. Unsupervised learning: it
    consists of algorithms that learn from an unlabeled training set. Examples of
    this type of learning are used to explore data according to some statistical,
    geometric or similarity criteria. Unsupervised learning is present in k-media
    grouping, grouping, principal component analysis, association detector, anomalies,
    etc. Reinforcement learning: it consists of algorithms that learn through the
    reinforcement of criticism. It provides information on the quality of a solution,
    but not on how to improve it. Improved solutions are achieved by iteratively exploring
    the solution space. The following phases were applied in the project: Data understanding:
    in this phase, the analysis of data from coffee cultivation was carried out, all
    the information was correlated with the experiences of coffee growers. Data preparation:
    for this phase, it is important to review the data, refine it, find inconsistencies,
    create, and verify the variables that are repeated. Selecting the variable homogenization
    technique: in this phase, the most important variables of the coffee crop to be
    measured were identified. In this case, some variables that are not easy to measure
    due to cost issues were discarded. One of the discarded variables was the PH measurement,
    despite its importance. Figure 5: phases applied to the analysis of coffee cultivation
    data In this section, it is important to mention that, among the different machine
    learning techniques, there are also other analysis tools such as neural networks,
    classification trees, support vector trees, and Bayesian classifiers, which are
    used to find useful information and make decisions. Coffee and its environmental
    conditions In this section, we intend to present a series of environmental variables
    that were taken as a reference for the present study. These variables are of great
    importance in the planting and cultivation of coffee, as well as in its future
    production: 1. Temperature Optimal conditions: The optimal area for growing Arabica
    coffee is between 19 and 21,5 °C. Other conditions: In cold climates, where the
    average temperature is below 19 °C, its production is lower, and the harvest is
    distributed throughout the year. In hot climates, where the average temperature
    is higher than 21,5 °C, the productive life of coffee is shorter, and the harvest
    is earlier and more concentrated. Therefore, rust is more severe when it attacks,
    and there is an increase in pests such as the bit or the miner [13]. 2. Sunshine
    and cloudiness Optimal conditions: Colombia is close to the equator and therefore
    receives abundant solar radiation throughout year. The maximum values that reach
    the top of the atmosphere occur in March and September and are close to 432 Wm-2.
    The minimums are observed between December and January and are close to 384 Wm-2.
    Due to uneven terrain, there are regions that are exposed to sunlight than others.
    In mountainous regions, due to horizon restriction, the effective time of sunlight
    can be reduced by two hours or more. This happens, for example, in coffee regions
    located in deep valleys [14]. 3. Soil humidity Optimal conditions: Soil moisture
    is a function of the distribution of rainfall within the crop, planting density,
    leaf distribution, the evaporative demand of the atmosphere, the slope of the
    land, and the physical and hydraulic properties of the soil. Currently, a variety
    of techniques are available to measure soil moisture directly in the field, without
    the need to take soil samples and alter their properties [15]. In the coffee zone,
    organizations such as Cenicafé recommend a humidity of 75 to 85 %. Other conditions:
    The pH (acidity) suitable for a good coffee crop must be between 5,0-6,0; a pH
    of less than 4,0 results in problems of Aluminum and Manganese toxicity and Calcium
    deficiencies. The crop must have adequate levels of Magnesium, Potassium, Sulfur,
    Boron, Copper, and Zinc. 4. Relative humidity Optimal conditions: It is a component
    of the climate that measures the relationship between a completely watersaturated
    air and the amount of water vapor at a given moment. Relative humidity is expressed
    in terms of percentage. Coffee is a plant that grows well in environments with
    humidity above 75% without reaching full saturation. Harvesting in regions such
    as the coffee axis occurs in the months with the lowest relative humidity, which
    facilitates the handling of the grain [16]. Discussion and results It was determined
    that the Lucy 3 programmable cards in each of the sensor nodes were programmed
    to receive the values sent by each of the sensors every 10 minutes, in order to
    send said data to the Gateway and from there to the station base. From there,
    the information was sent to the Ubidots platform, where the measured values were
    analyzed, and it was determined whether they were within the established ranges.
    Comparisons between the received values and the allowed ranges could be established
    to determine anomalous variations in said measurements. Distance tests were developed
    to determine the maximum range of the Xbee -Pro S2C wireless modules, to ensure
    reliable data transmission without loss and signal attenuation. It was thus found
    that the maximum range is within the established 100 m limit in open field. Fig.
    6 shows the data from transmitted variables being measured through the Lucy 3
    platform. This information is useful because it can determine if any data was
    lost or arrived without any error during the broadcast. We can see the DataSet
    loaded to the BigML platform to apply the supervised model. Figure 6: dataset
    transformed on the BigML platform. Applying the supervised model with classification
    through decision trees, we were able to establish that, as the environmental humidity
    increases, the number of instances decreases, and the soil humidity remains up
    to 79,69 %. In conclusion, if the humidity of the environment increases, the soil
    moisture tends to decrease. In Fig. 7, we can see a decision tree taking the environmental
    humidity variable as a pivot. Figure 7: Environmental humidity taken as reference
    in a decision tree By loading the data on the BigML platform, different learning
    models could be created that allowed us to delve into the analysis of variables
    such as temperature, ambient humidity, and soil moisture. In the same way, we
    were able to establish different evaluations and predictions, for example: As
    the day progresses, the ambient temperature logically increases at specific time
    intervals, but the ambient humidity also decreases. On the other hand, as the
    day passes, the environmental temperature has a greater influence on other variables
    such as temperature and humidity. In another model, soil humidity was taken as
    a reference variable. It was found that, as the temperature and environmental
    humidity increase, the number of instances decreased, and soil humidity increased
    up to 81,16 %. In conclusion, the two previous variables are directly proportional
    to soil moisture, that is, a higher temperature and relative humidity produce
    drying out of the ground. In Fig 8, we can see a decision tree taking the soil
    moisture variable as a reference. Figure 8: Soil moisture taken as reference in
    a decision tree. A training model was executed for the reference dataset, which
    was measured for 24 hours, as can be seen in Fig. 9. The measurements were made
    every 10 minutes and an average of 6 measurements was obtained every hour. Once
    the appropriate parameter was determined by homogenizing the data, the percentages
    for temperature and relative humidity were compared. According to the ML training,
    it was found that the greater number of instances in the temperature variable
    indicates that, if the ambient temperature increases, then the relative humidity
    tends to decrease. This means that both variables are inversely proportional.
    Therefore, the system would indicate that it is necessary to water the crop, since
    the relative humidity must be over a 75 % threshold. Figure 9: Measurement of
    temperature and relative humidity for training and decision making in a coffee
    crop Conclusions The design and configuration of the wireless sensor network met
    the initial expectations; there were no problems in collecting and transmitting
    data through the proposed hardware architecture. It could be established that,
    among the fundamental factors in coffee crops, there is the quality of the soil
    where the crop is planted, which depends on the growth rate and development of
    the tree, the start of production, the quantity and quality of the itself, resistance
    to attack by pests and diseases, and the duration of its productive life. It was
    established that the same problem can be treated with different models of supervised
    learning. There are combinations of decision trees, such as the assembly of repeated
    samples and random decision forests that can improve the results. Another type
    of model called logistic regression can also be used for the classification problem.
    The minimum and maximum parameters to be reached for each of the variables such
    as temperature, environmental humidity, and soil humidity were established on
    the Internet of Things platform (Ubidots) in order to compare them with the measurements
    sent by the node sensors. Temperature, relative humidity, and soil moisture were
    found to be variables of great importance in coffee cultivation. On the other
    hand, through the construction of supervised learning models, periods of time
    where the temperature decreases or increases could be evinced, which allows optimizing
    processes such as irrigation. Various supervised machine learning models were
    built with the purpose of evaluating the behavior of the aforementioned variables.
    There were two models: one predictive and the other evaluative. Thereupon, comparisons
    could be made based on previously defined patterns. References [1] J. D. Pinto,

    Antimicrobial resistance continues to outpace the development of new chemotherapeutics.
    Novel pathogens continue to evolve and emerge. Public health innovation has the
    potential to open a new front in the war of “our wits against their genes” (Joshua
    Lederberg). Dense sampling coupled to next generation sequencing can increase
    the spatial and temporal resolution of microbial characterization while sensor
    technologies precisely map physical parameters relevant to microbial survival
    and spread. Microbial, physical, and epidemiological big data could be combined
    to improve prospective risk identification. However, applied in the wrong way,
    these approaches may not realize their maximum potential benefits and could even
    do harm. Minimizing microbial-human interactions would be a mistake. There is
    evidence that microbes previously thought of at best “benign” may actually enhance
    human health. Benign and health-promoting microbiomes may, or may not, spread
    via mechanisms similar to pathogens. Infectious vaccines are approaching readiness
    to make enhanced contributions to herd immunity. The rigorously defined nature
    of infectious vaccines contrasts with indigenous “benign or health-promoting microbiomes”
    but they may converge. A “microbial Neolithic revolution” is a possible future
    in which human microbial-associations are understood and managed analogously to
    the macro-agriculture of plants and animals. Tradeoffs need to be framed in order
    to understand health-promoting potentials of benign, and/or health-promoting microbiomes
    and infectious vaccines while also discouraging pathogens. Super-spreaders are
    currently defined as individuals who play an outsized role in the contagion of
    infectious disease. A key unanswered question is whether the super-spreader concept
    may apply similarly to health-promoting microbes. The complex interactions of
    individual rights, community health, pathogen contagion, the spread of benign,
    and of health-promoting microbiomes including infectious vaccines require study.
    Advancing the detailed understanding of heterogeneity in microbial spread is very
    likely to yield important insights relevant to public health. Peer Review reports
    Background public health in the pre and the post antibiotic eras The antibiotic
    era began in the 1940’s. A trend toward decreasing mortality from infectious diseases
    began fifty years earlier in the late nineteenth century [1]. At least three quarters
    of the decrease in mortality from infectious disease from 1900 to the present
    day era appears due to public health measures because antibiotics became significant
    only in the 1940’s (see Fig. 1). Resistances to antimicrobials are increasingly
    common and threaten an end of the era of reliable treatment. It is “our wits against
    their genes” without a clear advantage to the former [2]. New antimicrobials will
    be discovered and developed but new resistances will arise. The continuing power
    of antimicrobials is at risk and alternatives must be actively considered [3,
    4]. Personalized and/or Precision public health could fit under already-existing
    rubrics of prevention via surveillance and sanitation. Alternatively, these approaches
    may be considered radical and different enough to suggest Personal and Precision
    Public Health as including novel elements and emphases. Fig. 1 Crude death rate
    for infectious diseases – United States, 1900–1996 (adapted by the CDC from [112]).
    Mortality from infectious diseases began to decrease before the advent of antimicrobials.
    The slope of decrease in crude mortality does not show evidence of being affected
    by the introduction of antimicrobials. The first clinical use of sulfonamids was
    in 1935, penicillin in 1943, with others throughout the following decades, albeit
    with decreasing frequency of novel compounds. The 1918 spike in mortality was
    caused by the Spanish flu pandemic which is estimated to have infected 500 million
    people, one third of the world’s population at that time, and killed between twenty
    and fifty million people Full size image The meaning and scope of the terms Personalized
    and/or Precision Public Health are a subject of current debate [5,6,7,8,9]. There
    is controversy about what Precision Public Health encompasses, how new the parts
    are, and what value they may or may not have. Some differences in the present
    article compared to other expositions should be noted. Here we: 1) Emphasize monitoring
    physical characteristics in ‘smart buildings’ 2) De-emphasize the contribution
    of human genomic DNA sequences. As a related remark, susceptibility to infectious
    diseases is more likely to have a meaningful and robust genetic component in the
    young than in adult or aged individuals [10]. 3) Emphasize finding the optimum
    granularity. By “granularity” we mean the size, time, or other divisions for which
    heterogeneity is most meaningful. We hypothesize the individual human being as
    likely to represent an especially meaningful level of granularity with regard
    to the microbial environment. 4) Future-oriented scenarios that anticipate Precision
    Public health promoting the spread of health-promoting microbiomes including,
    but not limited to, infectious vaccines. Heterogeneity in biology Technical innovations
    that allow higher resolution scrutiny have led to progress- even revolutions-
    in many subfields of biology. Examples include dividing tissues into cellular
    subtypes [11], single cell expression profiles from defined anatomy, cell types,
    or developmental lineages [12,13,14], and cells themselves fractionated into organelles
    [15]. An analogous revolution in public health might be possible through higher
    resolution mapping of relevant parameters. This commentary focuses on technologies
    for, and the consequences of, increased spatial and temporal resolution of microbiological,
    chemical, physical, spatial and temporal measurements relevant to public health.
    There is a “chicken and egg” or “Catch 22” problem in anticipating the benefits
    of higher-resolution data. This limitation follows from our current ignorance
    of how heterogeneous the relevant physical and microbiological parameters are.
    New insights and benefits are likely to be proportional to how much heterogeneity
    is discovered as a consequence of gains in resolution. To begin research that
    might crack the chicken and egg problem, one must initially speculate on the relevant
    heterogeneity. By hypothesis, a relevant unit of heterogeneity to consider for
    airborne infection will be at the level of each individual human being. The scales
    at which heterogeneity is hypothesized to exist affect the research programs to
    search for it. The results will subsequently be used to modify the hypotheses
    and research program. Heterogeneity will be discussed further in following sections.
    The technical means and value of increasing spatial and temporal resolution in
    other areas of public health, such as ensuring healthy drinking water [16] and
    optimal transformation of sewage [17] or compost, [18] will not be covered here.
    The human exposome is currently defined elsewhere as the sum of an individual’s
    lifetime exposure to microbes and chemicals [19]. We suggest that this definition
    of the human exposome misses vital elements of what matters and the definition
    could usefully be extended in two related ways: 1) It should explicitly include
    microbes and chemicals sourced directly from other humans which probably are a
    major contributor in many circumstances and 2) The exposome should be understood
    as a reciprocal and interactive process to account for the fact that each individual
    is both a source and a sink of microbes and chemicals. The current definition
    of the exposome seems to consign a role to individual humans as passive recipients
    or victims of their environment. This is a valid way to model parts of the system,
    including the political system, but it is biologically an incomplete description
    of the consequences of our being social animals. Individual humans are major microbiological
    and probably chemical contributors to their immediate environment. Humans in proximity
    are exposed to each other’s microbiomes and chemicals. Some of this is classical
    epidemiology of infectious disease, such as transmission of human-specific viruses
    including influenza. Some chemical influences might be classed as behavioral,
    e.g. cigarette smoke and the experience of second hand smoke. However, it is also
    plausible that significant chemicals that modify the exposome of self and of others
    arise via the microbiome or other metabolic sources over which an individual has,
    at present, no means of knowledge or control. Mapping what matters for human-relevant
    microbes and microbiomes Tang et al. propose more precisely mapping the global
    epidemiology of non-influenza RNA respiratory viruses, based on the whole genome
    sequencing of these viruses [20]. We are supportive of this and other related
    large-scale data-mining projects, i.e. with the aim that such efforts yield copious
    and interpretable data. Information currently undiscovered might also be obtained
    using a different approach to sampling, particularly air-sampling. Current air
    sampling strategies concentrate microbes from larger volumes (liters to hundreds
    cubic meters) of air into smaller volumes of liquid (either directly or from filters
    that are extracted) [21]. Concentration economizes the use of reagents and may
    (depending on inhibitors and dilution effects) minimize the frequency of assays
    that yield no signal. However, vacuum sampling alter airs flow making it a biological
    instantiation of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle whereby the act of measurement
    affects the object of measurement. This sampling approach makes a trade-off between
    sensitivity and localization. How much heterogeneity is there in the spatial and
    temporal distribution of microbes in the built environment? Airborne fungi in
    different rooms vary across seasons in residences [22]. The microbial exposure
    where infants crawl and young children toddle is distinct from that at the level
    where adults are breathing [23, 24]. In a case study reported in this issue, Tang
    et al. find that individual samplers on different individuals varied from zero
    RSV RNA copies to a high of 2778/m3. It is currently unknown how much heterogeneity
    is inside the cubic meter that contains thousands of genomes. At the extremes,
    the entire viral load could have been confined to one compact particle or, alternatively,
    it could have been evenly dispersed through the entire volume. Sequences or detection
    alone are not the only informational product. The usefulness of spatial and temporal
    metadata depends on how much they reveal heterogeneity. PCR can now be carried
    out inside nanoliter or picoliter volumes with many millions carried out in parallel
    and rare hits separated by Florescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) from a majority
    of negative droplets [25]. Single molecule sequencing is becoming routine and
    molecules can uniquely labeled with barcoded primers. What remains to be invented
    are ways to combine barcoding with nanodrop assays and single molecule sequencing
    such that each molecule’s sequence or nanoliter drop PCR assay can be linked to
    its unique metadata. Small droplet assays are likely to decrease background due
    to contamination of molecular reagents with bacterial DNA [26]. Rapid and focused
    public health actions motivated by precision data could lead to less overall disruption
    and more efficient prevention [27]. For example, if infected animals can be reliably
    identified, there may be less need to cull larger groups. Individual cattle, pigs
    and chicken cages are already identified in current agricultural settings to allow
    the tracing of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) [28]. Globally, approximately
    20% of livestock are lost to preventable diseases, costing around USD $2 billion
    per annum in Africa alone, with much of this loss in low- and lower-middle income
    settings [29]. There is substantial potential for veterinary, human public health
    and economic benefit. Toward improved microbial sampling in the built environment
    A widely cited survey estimated that most people in the US spend 90% or more of
    their time either inside buildings or automobiles [30]. Similar considerations
    apply in buildings and more broadly for example ships, subways, and airplanes.
    Most potentially consequential microbial exposure probably occurs in these venues
    [31]. There are three sources of microbes in buildings [32]: a) occupants, i.e.
    people and other animals if present b) penetration from the outside environment
    c) growth in/on the structure itself e.g. walls, pipes and on surfaces that are
    intermittently wet [33]. Microbial growth in garbage, among foodstuffs, on furnishings
    and cloths contributes in some cases [34]. The contribution of each source to
    the medically relevant microbiome is not equally distributed. Most airborne viruses
    that infect humans spread from other humans although zoonotic transmission in
    farms and markets should not be overlooked. Heterogeneity and sampling The optimum
    mode of sampling depends on the distribution of targets. If the target is rare
    and evenly distributed, then gathering as much of the environment as possible
    into each sample is best. However, if the target is unevenly distributed, then
    smaller sample sizes may be better so that rare targets are not diluted below
    the detection threshold. If the environment or reagents also contain inhibitors
    or decoy targets, then large scale concentration may decrease sensitivity. Taq
    polymerase and many other reagents contain bacterial DNA that is residual from
    their production. Assays that use minimal amounts of Taq decrease this background
    [26] and small volumes assays should further help. For the detection of Biowarfare
    agents that are normally absent and for which quick, specific, and sensitive detection
    are paramount, many thousands of liters of air rapidly collected are appropriate
    [35]. On the other hand, to best understand the undisturbed environment the sampling
    method should be gentle, not itself create additional airflow, and it should be
    granular. Individual vacuum samplers are an intermediate methodology. They are
    worn or left near a patient and draw air onto a filter. Depending on the airflow
    rate they sample a variable-sized environment. The time resolution is typically
    one to several hours. As currently used the whole filter, which is typically 25 mm
    in diameter is extracted as a single sample [36, 37]. Insight into heterogeneity
    of the air might be gained through a modification of the way that the sampling
    filter is currently processed. Instead of extracting the filter in one piece,
    suppose it were cut into a number of equal segments that are processed and assayed
    independently. If most segments are negative but a few contain a strong signal
    that would be clear indication of heterogeneity in the air volume sampled. This
    reasoning and experimental design take their inspiration from classic studies
    that determined the independence of bacterial mutation from its subsequent selection
    [38, 39]. Individual passive sampling If spatial and temporal variation are high,
    then smaller more localized and less mixed samples become relatively advantageous.
    The mouth and nose are the expected source and the reservoir for most airborne
    infectious agents. Dilution into the air volume predicts that the concentration
    of an airborne agent will decrease as a cubic function of distance from its source.
    Deactivation of viruses in aerosol may lead to a more dramatic drop-off of viable
    virus. Samplers should be unobtrusive and not alter the sampled environment. The
    assay of tiny volumes and the ability isolate rare positive samples recommend
    a new generation of small volume and/or passive samplers. Clothing is a promising
    personal environmental sampling site [40, 41] but difficult to standardize. One
    might build on the clothing idea to design defined samplers optimized for capture
    and preservation of the microbial and chemical environment. Sampling material
    might be housed in specially-designed holders, akin to radiation badges. For example,
    in hospitals, all patients, staff and visitors might wear standardized samplers.
    The top of the shoulders appears to offer a minimally obtrusive yet maximally
    sensitive sampling site. Top-of-the-shoulder samplers would be closer to the mouth
    and nose than samplers worn as chest badges but relative sensitivity remains to
    be tested. Epaulettes such as those worn as military insignia might provide design
    inspiration. These approaches would potentially dovetail with simultaneously tracking
    movements within the environment of interest, and thus early consideration of
    the ethical issues and public or user concerns would be critical. Passive samplers
    have different characteristics that in some scenarios may make them superior to
    vacuum-enhanced air sampling: i) if the target distribution is highly heterogenous
    in space, then source proximity may give the highest signal to noise ratio. ii)
    the related ability to identify the source with less distortion due to the sampler’s
    altering airflow. Each sampling patch could contain internal standards. Research
    to design samplers might take inspiration from materials for replica plating of
    bacteria [39, 42]. There may even be specific overlap of optimal materials such
    as velveteen (a velvet-like cloth) for capture. Prospective identification of
    super-spreaders Super-spreaders or super-shedders are individuals who disproportionately
    infect others and may dominate the epidemiology of infectious disease [43,44,45,46].
    In some contexts super-spreaders of infectious agents might be identified prospectively
    by molecular criteria rather than by post facto epidemiology [47, 48]. Asymptomatic
    super-spreaders of airborne infections might be identified as those whose samplers
    harbor the most signal for the agents in question [48]. Super-spreaders or super-shedders
    have been documented in people and also among cattle and in mouse model systems
    [49, 50]. There are important unknowns concerning super-spreaders. A study in
    cattle argues that super-shedding may be time rather than individual dependent,
    i.e. the same individuals may not be super-spreaders a mere few hours later [51].
    It is currently unclear- in fact the question appears to be unasked- whether super-spreaders
    are agent-specific or generalized. By further hypothesis generalized super-spreaders
    might excrete more of their own DNA as well as that of infectious agents. In this
    case the detection of spreading potential might be seen in two ways: i) by the
    presence of more self-sequences on the individual’s samples and ii) by the presence
    of individual sequence-specific DNA from the sampling of others. The anticipation
    would be that those who shed either the “wrong”, i.e. potential pathogen, or perhaps
    simply too much, DNA may be considered candidates for a variety of control measures,
    up to and including confinement. Rational discussions about policy and human rights
    should be informed by facts [52]. Not all infections spread between individuals
    are harmful or neutral. Health-positive microbial spreading, e.g. the live attenuated
    oral polio and rotavirus vaccines, also occurs. Analogous to the way that some
    individuals are more influential than others in spreading ideas or memes [53],
    some may be more influential in spreading health-promoting microbiomes. If social
    and environmental transmission of benign and of positively helpful microbiomes
    turns out to be the case, will it follow the same rules as the spread of detrimental
    infections? Depending on their resident microbiomes, the same individuals may
    turn out to be super-spreaders of benign, health-promoting, or harmful microbes.
    Toward mapping the 3D topography of relevant variables The survival and distribution
    of airborne infectious agents depends on temperature, humidity [54,55,56,57,58,59,60]
    and airflow [61, 62]. Improved mapping of these parameters would better inform
    building design, and real-time monitoring of these parameters in occupied buildings
    might open the way for their dynamic optimization. For example, there is generally
    a temperature difference between indoor and outdoor environments, which results
    in a temperature gradient across rooms whose windows or walls form a building’s
    exterior. Regions of every intermediate temperature and relative humidity will
    exist when the outside is below freezing and the inside is warm. Temperature gradients
    necessarily traverse the dew point where water vapor condenses into liquid. The
    stability of regions where water vapor liquifies, and the consequences for microbes
    are complex and situation-specific. Moreover, most things microbial in the built
    environment also depend on the behavior of occupants. It is therefore challenging
    for modelling to predict, for example, that a specific region of hospital room,
    such as the southeast corner near the ceiling, happens to be in a “sweet spot”
    for bacteria or virus. An increasing number of ‘smart’ buildings, including hospitals,
    are fitted with sensors [63,64,65] which monitor temperature and/or humidity at
    a given position and are networked in an Internet of Things (IoT) [66, 67]. These
    IoT systems can provide 3D maps of the monitored parameters in real-time, and
    can be used e.g. to optimize heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)
    systems [68, 69] or to monitor the integrity of the building structure [70]. Such
    IoT systems could be readily adapted for applications targeting the microbiome,
    with additional sensors placed in at-risk areas. Sensors can be installed during
    building construction, retrofitted permanently, or temporarily installed. The
    IoT systems could be augmented with other sensors to monitor e.g. levels of particular
    gas types or volatile organic compounds (VOC) relevant to microbial growth [71,72,73].
    Environmental sensing will interface with wearable technology and individual-identified
    information [74]. In addition to the temperature and humidity information provided
    by an IoT network of sensors, there is a need for devices that provide portability,
    remote sensing, and high spatial resolution. These could be used to rapidly assess
    large areas without having to install an IoT system, monitor targets otherwise
    difficult to access, or provide the cm- or mm-scale spatial resolution required
    to localize problem sources. High resolution, remote imaging of temperature is
    routinely performed using infrared (IR) cameras for radiometry, exploiting the
    dependence of the blackbody radiation intensity at a given wavelength on temperature.
    This IR thermal imaging can be used e.g. to identify thermal leakage between indoor
    and outdoor environments [75]. Blackbody radiation is also emitted at microwave
    frequencies. Although the emission intensity from room temperature bodies is much
    lower at microwave frequencies than at IR frequencies, microwaves can penetrate
    through dielectric materials such as walls to assess spaces hidden to visible
    or IR frequencies, and can still provide spatial resolution on the mm- to cm-scale.
    Whilst promising, microwave thermometry for applications in the built-environment
    is at a much earlier stage of development than IR cameras and requires further
    development, with single-channel sensors of moderate sensitivity and spatial resolution
    reported [76, 77]. Water in all its forms (humidity, moisture, condensation, etc.)
    and its distributions are often key variables for the health of a building’s occupants
    [78,79,80]. Microwave radiometers are used in the large scale environment for
    remote measurement of atmospheric humidity. Water vapor can be identified from
    its distinct absorption peak at a frequency of 22.235 GHz in its microwave spectrum
    [81], and multi-frequency measurements can be used to detect liquid water (e.g.
    suspended microdrops). However, atmospheric measurements integrate over 100 s
    to 1000s of meters of air, and the research has not been done to determine if
    indoor microwave radiometry, integrating over much smaller volumes, would provide
    a sufficient signal for practical humidity measurements. It may be more immediately
    practical to look for water in materials, such as walls with water leakage, which
    can both drive local humidity and host infectious agents themselves. Wet material
    can be indirectly detected with IR imaging, through the resulting change in surface
    temperature [75]. Direct remote sensing techniques for indoor water are less advanced,
    and would require research and development effort to become practical. Microwave-based
    sensing is again promising, due to its through-wall imaging capability and ability
    to provide sufficient spatial resolution [82] (unlike radiation of longer wavelengths).
    Microwave sensors for water can be based on the scattering of microwaves generated
    by an external source, as discussed in this issue [83], with holographic techniques
    able to provide 3D reconstructions of scattering objects [84, 85]. In the short
    to medium term, single-channel point-sensors could be developed, with imaging
    performed by scanning the sensor. As a long-term aspiration, one could envisage
    a camera providing images of 3D moisture levels in real time, similar to temperature
    imaging with IR cameras. Schlieren and shadowgraph optics allow 3D imaging of
    air movements at distance [86]. It remains to be seen if these and/or other methods
    can be developed to noninvasively monitor the full range of airflows relevant
    to building occupants. A strength of microwaves are their ability to penetrate
    many building materials even though they are strongly absorbed by water and reflected
    by metals. Infrared has the advantage of better specific spectra for many materials
    of interest. Real time carbon dioxide (CO2) imaging in the built environment seems
    a reasonable approach to become both practical and informative. The atmospheric
    concentration of CO2 is about 400 ppm (ppm), 0.04% and increasing at an annual
    rate of approximately 2-4 ppm per year [87]. Directly exhaled human breath is
    between 4 and 5% CO2, approximately 100 fold more than the atmosphere. Increased
    ambient CO2 correlates well with subjective reports of stuffy air [88] and local
    areas of increased concentration correlate well with increased airborne concentrations
    of Mycobacterium tuberculosis [89]. CO2 quantification is carried out with compact
    devices that measure concentration via specific IR spectral absorption. Wavelength-specific
    IR is used for earth [90] and extraterrestrial [91] quantification of atmospheric
    CO2. To our knowledge IR imaging of CO2 has not yet been used in the built environment.
    If there is clear motivation to do it, then it can be done. Real time IR imaging
    of CO2 might, for example, be used to direct a small fan into regions of high
    CO2 thereby dispelling patches of stagnant air in an energy efficient manner.
    Public health policymakers The global health world is waking up to the challenges
    posed by respiratory infectious diseases outbreaks, with lessons being learned
    from high profile outbreaks covering coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, and
    the ‘bird flu’ and ‘swine flu’ events from 2005 and 2009 [92]. The Ebola outbreak
    in west Africa across 2014 and 2015, although not primarily driven by respiratory
    transmission, has also triggered international and national level plans for dealing
    with communicable disease [93]. Powerful global health actors, that for example
    include the World Health Organization [94], Wellcome Trust [95], World Bank [96]
    and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation [97], have now developed action plans,
    protocols, policy documents and research programs that address some current needs
    and tentatively cover emerging and future priorities. However, we feel there is
    much they could still do in leading a conversation about the future of public
    health, and how interventions and technology can drive both subtle and radical
    transformations in this particular landscape. Infections usually disproportionately
    affect the most vulnerable populations, such as children with severe malnutrition
    in resource-poor settings. An arguably lower-profile aspect of the 2030 Sustainable
    Development Goals, within the ‘no one left behind’ mantra, is the concept of healthy
    ageing [98]. With an increasingly ageing global population, we hypothesize that
    managing newly-geriatric populations in low- and middle-income settings will result
    in requirements for entire new medical and public health specialties in countries
    where currently few people live in to their 70s or older. An increasing number
    of older people, presenting with numerous morbidities (such as cardiovascular,
    musculoskeletal complications, and dementia), will therefore not be able to be
    cared for in a family home, and local equivalents of care homes will be set up.
    The elderly institutionalized remain vulnerable to infection. This will result
    in development of clinical practice, and ethical and legal, frameworks for patient
    management and research in vulnerable populations and these may best adopted from
    existing frameworks (such as the Mental Capacity Act in the UK), and adapted to
    suit local needs and cultures [99, 100]. Future public health preventive measures
    include more efficiently- targeted approaches to vaccination. The concept of transmissible
    vaccines is being widely considered, and initial theoretical research has suggested
    that even weakly transmissible vaccines could provide significant benefit in reductions
    of disease burden [101, 102]. The additional benefit of improved vaccination programs
    would be to slow the development of antimicrobial resistance [103, 104]. However,
    the potential negative consequences on vulnerable immunocompromised individuals,
    must be clearly considered. Public discussion concerning new vaccine programs
    has sometimes been politically charged [105]. Conclusions A data-driven dilemma
    in the future of public health ethics Public health, with reference to microbiology,
    utilizes several streams of data all of which are subject to improvements whose
    combined information have the potential to be synergistic: 1) identification and
    quantification of microbes, their locals of growth, metabolism, evolution, carriers,
    and 2) mapping the physical parameters that contribute to microbial survival and
    dissemination. 3) Patient and epidemiological reporting 4) Correlation indicators
    such as Google searches. New technologies will increase the temporal and spatial
    resolution of data collection and move closer to real time apprehension of the
    microbial environment. Higher resolution information will inspire architectural
    and social designs that aim to diminish detrimental human-pathogen encounters
    while enhancing those that may be beneficial. Personal and Precision Public Health
    have the potential to greatly reduce the spread of infections and the burden of
    antibiotic resistance both directly by spotting antibiotic resistance genes earlier
    and indirectly by decreasing the overall rate of primary infection. The displacement
    of antibiotic tolerant C. difficile with microbiomes introduced via fecal transplants
    are already a clinical application of introducing health-promoting microbiomes
    [106]. It remains to be seen if this is an isolated and specialized application
    or, more hopefully, a harbinger of a broader future. The realization of Precision
    Public Health will require new interdisciplinary collaborations inclusive of sensor
    engineers, microbiologists (both medical and environmental), building engineers,
    architects and bioethicists. Focused multi-disciplinary training programs in high-income
    settings can lead the way for significant knowledge and skill transfer into low-
    and middle-income settings. Fine grained spatial and temporal mapping of physical
    and biological parameters along with reduced lag between data gathering and interpretation
    will progress toward real time analysis. Transformative benefits in personal care
    via personal and precision medicine are widely touted [107] but we assert that
    personal and Precision Public Health offer opportunities for impact at greater
    scale. Ethical issues that encompass work, civil, and human rights need to be
    considered right from the very start of planning around Precision Public Health.
    The public must have a say in these future public health initiatives. Retrospective
    public and community engagement can lead significant and harmful loss of trust
    in public health, as demonstrated in the UK with the failed implementation of
    the care.data digital health program [108], and in Denmark where unwarranted anti-vaccine
    messages about the HPV vaccine overwhelmed a limited health promotion campaign
    [109]. In the event of infection with highly-infectious or serious pathogens,
    people- no one can say yet how many- may be excluded from their chosen work, travel,
    or even confined against their will based only on their predicted and unintended
    likelihood of spreading disease. It would be a new kind of sequence-based discrimination
    and the incriminating sequences would not even be their own. On the other hand,
    with appropriate intervention that may include confinement, the spread of contagion
    might be greatly diminished in many circumstances, with work and health of the
    entire group- especially the most immunologically vulnerable- greatly enhanced.
    Who could argue against increasing the safety of hospital workers and patients?
    Who could argue against greater microbiological safety and health for the crew
    of long term space flights who live at close quarters for months at a time [110]?
    If there were clear evidence for wider public health benefit, how could we not
    do this? Even in Typhoid Mary’s day (early 1900’s, See Table 1) asymptomatic carriers
    of the typhoid bacillus could be identified through individual stool samples.
    Present and foreseeable technologies make us all candidates for routine high resolution
    screening. Future approaches to sampling in Precision Public Health will ideally
    be unobtrusive but consequences, i.e. how the information is used, are part and

    Whole body vibrationTransmissionNeck painFarmingAll-terrain vehicle 1. Introduction
    Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are common reasons for work related sick-leave,
    and incur substantial costs for modern society (Buckle and Devereux, 1999). Vehicle
    driving is an occupational task that often exposes the driver to whole body vibration
    (WBV) and mechanical shocks (Tiemessen et al., 2008). Such exposure can increase
    the risk of low back MSDs for drivers of a variety of vehicle types used in mining
    (McPhee, 2004, Eger et al., 2008), forestry (Rehn et al., 2002), passenger transport
    (Bovenzi and Zadani, 1992), and heavy machinery in shipping and construction (Boshuizen
    et al., 1992, Bovenzi et al., 2002, Waters et al., 2008). Farmers using tractors
    and other farm vehicles, including quad bikes, are also exposed to WBV and report
    a high prevalence of low back pain (LBP), often exacerbated during farm vehicle
    operation (Bovenzi and Betta, 1994, Walker-Bone and Palmer, 2002, Scarlett et
    al., 2005, Milosavljevic et al., 2011). Although exposure thresholds for WBV and
    mechanical shocks are recommended in European Directive 2002/44/EC and in the
    ISO 2631-1 and 2631-5 standards, there is no established dose-response relationship
    between vibration exposure and MSD. Despite this, researchers have reported associations
    between drivers exposed to WBV and LBP (Bovenzi and Hulshof, 1998, Lings and Leboeuf-Yde,
    2000, Tiemessen et al., 2008, Milosavljevic et al., 2012b). In one study, exposure
    to WBV from rural quad-bike use was strongly associated with the 12-month prevalence
    of LBP (Milosavljevic et al., 2012b). Tiemessen et al. (2008) also found a significant
    association between WBV cumulative exposure and driving-related LBP in a prospective
    cohort of 229 drivers; however they were unable to determine a dose-response relationship
    with the intensity or disability of LBP. Many individuals also report neck problems
    from driving (Viikari-Juntura et al., 1996, Rehn et al., 2002, Eger et al., 2008),
    although the association is considered weak (Magnusson et al., 1996, Viikari-Juntura
    et al., 1996, Scutter et al., 1997, Ariëns et al., 2000, Walker-Bone and Palmer,
    2002). Other than whiplash-associated disorders from vehicle accidents, ergonomic
    risk factors for the neck during driving have not been extensively studied. Suggested
    risk factors include: i) extreme forward flexion of the cervical spine, ii) static
    contraction of the neck and shoulder muscles to counteract the weight of the head,
    iii) elevated arms, and iv) twisted or bent working postures (Magnusson et al.,
    1996). The transmission of translational seat vibration to the head and neck region
    has been previously identified in laboratory research, with a review identifying
    seat-to-head transmissibility (STHT) between 0.5 and 20 Hz (Rakheja et al., 2010).
    Wang et al. (2006) investigated vibration transmission using a helmet mounted
    accelerometer in response to randomly generated vertical vibration at the seat.
    They found peak seat-to-head amplification was 1.75 times greater at the head
    with a coinciding phase lag of 100° between 4 and 5 Hz in testing conditions without
    a back-rest. The biodynamic response to WBV is also influenced by several driving
    factors, including seated posture (Mansfield and Griffin, 2002, Rakheja et al.,
    2002, Wang et al., 2004), backrest inclination (Nawayseh and Griffin, 2004, Wang
    et al., 2006), and use of a steering wheel (Rakheja et al., 2002). Amplified and
    out-of-phase accelerations at the head/neck may increase compressive load of the
    cervical spine (Wang et al., 2010) and cause sensorimotor disturbances, including
    visual and vestibular perceptual deficits (Zahov and Medzhidieva, 2005, Santos
    et al., 2008). Mani et al. (2015) observed standing balance perturbations following
    30 min of vibration exposure, indicating a somatosensory disturbance, which may
    also contribute to the development of LBP (Mok et al., 2007). Paddan and Griffin
    (1988) found that fore-and-aft vibration produced at a seat contributed to both
    fore-and-aft and vertical head motion. Furthermore, head nodding has been observed
    in individuals during exposure to vertical vibration at the seat, likely due to
    the offset between the centre of gravity of the head and its pivot point (Sandover,
    1991). Oscillatory motion of the head appears to have different characteristics
    from vertical axis vibration applied at the seat, with substantial between and
    within subject variability (Paddan and Griffin, 1998). An in vivo study also found
    horizontal and rotational motions in lumbar vertebrae subjected to pure vertical
    vibration in the resonant frequency span (Panjabi et al., 1986). These findings
    indicate that transmission of vibration from the seat to the head/neck is complex.
    While the biodynamic response of STHT has been extensively studied under controlled
    laboratory conditions, further fieldwork of occupational vibration at the head/neck
    of drivers will help clarify exposure levels and the relationship to risk of injury
    or MSDs. Recent research of farmers found that daily WBV exposure from quad bike
    driving was high, and likely associated with the prevalence of low back and neck
    pain (Milosavljevic et al., 2010, Milosavljevic et al., 2011). Previous surveys
    also identified a high prevalence of neck pain and headache in farmers, with vibration
    exposure from farm vehicles considered a plausible source of symptoms (Scutter
    et al., 1997, Sjaastad and Bakketeig, 2002, Milosavljevic et al., 2012b). The
    purpose of this fieldwork investigation was to compare the dose and spectral characteristics
    of vibration simultaneously measured at the seat and head while farmers used a
    quad bike on farm terrain over a 30-min sampling frame. While vibration dosage
    recorded at the head may differ from the seat, we hypothesized a strong spectral
    relationship between the measurements, and amplifed STHT coinciding with resonant
    frequencies of the spine. 2. Methodology 2.1. Field testing Following ethical
    approval from the University of Saskatchewan Behavioural Research Ethics Board,
    a convenience sample of 10 healthy full-time rural workers experienced in operating
    farm vehicles, including quad bikes, was recruited for this field-based study.
    Seat and head vibrations were simultaneously recorded as each rural worker operated
    one of two quad bikes, either a 2007 Yamaha King Quad 450 (n = 4) or a 2006 Arctic
    Cat 650 (n = 6). Each worker completed a standardized route over typical farm
    terrain, with the track length designed to accommodate a riding duration of approximately
    30 min (Fig. 1). The farm terrain included a mix of surfaces typical in grain
    and pulse cultivation as well as livestock production, including gravel, packed
    earth, soft earth, and rough surfaces (e.g. ditches and stones). Prior to completing
    the test route, each worker received a detailed overview of the farm track. In
    addition, participants were instructed to: (a) operate the quad-bike continuously
    without stoppage; remain seated for the duration of the ride; (c) drive at a speed
    not exceeding 20 km/hr. Download : Download high-res image (471KB) Download :

    with inertial measurement units mounted in a rubber seat pad and on a helmet,
    and data loggers fixed to the rear carrying rack. Inset shows close-up of one
    inertial measurement unit. 2.2. Data collection Seat-based vibrations were measured
    with a 6-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU) encompassing a triaxial accelerometer
    and a triaxial gyroscope (AccelrateRate3D, MemSense LLC, Rapid City, SD). The
    full-scale range of the accelerometers and gyroscopes was ±10 g and ±1200°/s,
    respectively, with an operating temperature range between −45 °C and +85 °C and
    an anti-aliasing filter set at a bandwidth of 100 Hz. The sensor was mounted in
    a rubberised seat-pad (NexGen Ergonomics, Pointe Clair, QC) placed on the seat
    of the quad bike, directly under the ischial tuberosities of the farmer (ISO,
    1997, Milosavljevic et al., 2010). Head/neck vibration data were gathered with
    an identical 6-axis IMU mounted to the crown of a lightweight and adjustable open
    faced helmet (Fig. 1). The helmet/IMU combination weighed 0.5 kg and was individually
    adjusted and firmly fitted to the head of each farm worker. Seat and head data
    were sampled at 1000 Hz with 2 synchronized 8-channel data recorders (DataLOG
    MW8X, Biometrics Ltd, Newport UK), enabling simultaneous collection of both 6-axis
    IMUs attached to the seat and helmet. 2.3. Data analysis Since the current standards
    draw attention to linear accelerations measured at the seat (European Directive
    2002/44/EC; ISO 2631-1), we performed a focused investigation of seat and head
    linear accelerations in the 0.5–20.0 Hz frequency range associated with resonant
    WBV (Boileau et al., 1998, Paddan and Griffin, 1998, Sandover, 1991). All analyses
    were conducted in MatLab (v. 2016a, The Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA). Raw accelerations
    in the X (anterior-posterior), Y (medial-lateral), and Z (vertical) orthogonal
    axes were de-biased and band-pass filtered using a 4th order Butterworth filter
    between 0.5 and 20 Hz. Accelerometers were calibrated by a 30-s data sample gathered
    at the beginning of each collection with each worker maintaining a neutral back
    and head position (gaze anteriorly oriented), aligning the vertical axes of the
    sensors with the gravitational field. The amplitude and spectral relationships
    between the seat and head/neck were determined by investigating the ∼30-min recorded
    vibration data in 10-s epochs. Root-mean-squared accelerations in the X, Y, and
    Z axes at the seat and head were calculated using the following equation adapted
    from the ISO 2631-1 guidelines (Eq. (1)): (1) where, RMS is the root-mean-squared
    acceleration (m/s2) at time t, and T is the measurement duration (s). As the ISO
    2631-1 axis-dependent multiplying factors are only specified for the lumbar spine,
    we chose not to use X and Y axis 1.4 weightings in our comparative calculations
    for vibration exposure at the seat and head/neck. We also reported the ratio of
    RMS at the head relative to the seat (RMSHead/RMSSeat) to determine whether vibration
    magnitude was higher at the head/neck (Jack and Eger, 2008). Fast Fourier Transforms
    (FFTs) were computed on seat and head acceleration data in the respective X, Y,
    and Z axes, which were used to calculate power spectral densities (PSDs) as a
    measure of energy at each frequency (Mansfield, 2005). PSDs were computed with
    a Hanning window in 10-s, 50% overlapping segments resulting in a frequency resolution
    of 0.1 Hz. Average PSDs were computed for each ∼30-min trial, and the frequency
    response function was calculated in each axis to determine the transfer function
    from the seat to the head according Eq. (2): (2) where, STHT is seat-to-helmet-transmissibility
    (no units) at frequency f (Hz), and PSDHead and PSDSeat are power spectral densities
    (m2/s4/Hz) of the head and seat, respectively. If vibration is amplified at the
    head/neck relative to the seat at any frequency, STHT is greater than 1. Alternatively,
    if vibration is attenuated, STHT is less than 1 (Mansfield, 2005). Head and seat
    phase angles were also computed, which were used to determine the phase shift
    between the head and seat at each frequency, θhead(f) – θseat(f). A positive phase
    shift indicated a leading phase difference while a negative phase shift indicated
    a lagging phase difference between the head and seat. Thus, a negative phase difference
    would indicate the vibration response measured at the head was lagging behind
    the vibration input measured at the seat. Signal coherence was also computed in
    each axis to determine whether there was a relation between seat and head vibration,
    indicative of mechanical transference (Mansfield, 2005). Coherence quantified
    the correlation between the input energy output energy (Eq. (3)): (3) where, γ2
    is signal coherence (no units) for frequency f (Hz), calculated from the signal
    cross-spectral density (CSDseat.head) and power-spectral densities (PSDseat and
    PSDhead). Coherence ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect relation between
    seat (input) and head (output). 2.4. Data presentation and statistics Mean (±SD)
    demographic data are presented in tabular format. Time domain RMSHead, RMSSeat,
    and RMSHead/RMSSeat are reported as means with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).
    The relationships between seat and head RMS in the X, Y, and Z axes were further
    explored with Pearson correlation, allowing the expression of linear correlations
    in each orthogonal axis. Spectral analyses, including PSDs, STHT, phase shift,
    and signal coherence for simultaneously recorded seat and head vibrations are
    presented in graphic format from 0.5 to 20 Hz (mean ± 95% CI). 3. Results Descriptive
    data for the 10 rural workers are presented in Table 1. Vibration data were gathered
    for a mean ± SD driving time of 26.7 ± 4.2 min. In the X-axis, RMSHead was (mean ± 95%
    CI) 2.19 ± 0.37 times greater than RMSSeat; however, the Pearson correlation for
    X-axis vibration simultaneously measured at the seat and head was weak (Table
    2). In the Y-axis, the correlation was very weak, and RMSHead was lower than RMSSeat.
    Conversely, the Pearson correlation between seat and head vibration was strong
    in the Z-axis, and RMSHead was 1.37 ± 0.12 times greater than RMSSeat. Table 1.

    results demonstrate mechanical transference and amplification of resonant vibration
    in the Z-axis. The very strong relationship between simultaneously recorded seat
    and head vibration in the vertical direction (r = 0.89; γ2 > 0.8 between 1.3 and
    4.9 Hz) are indicative of low frequency quad bike vibration being transmitted
    from the pelvis to the head. Whether expressed in the time domain (RMSHead/RMSSeat)
    or the frequency domain (Seat and Head PSDs and coinciding STHT), comparative
    Z-axis vibration demonstrated amplification at the head relative to the seat,
    in particular from 1.3 to 4.9 Hz (Table 2; Fig. 2, Fig. 4). These results are
    consistent with the head and neck of farmers (who use quad bikes) being exposed
    to resonant occupational vibration amplified in the Z direction through the osseous,
    articular, and collagenous structures of the spine (Paddan and Griffin, 1998,
    Fritz et al., 2005). Despite weak relationships between seat and head vibrations
    in both the X and Y directions, X-axis vibration at the head still demonstrated
    considerably greater magnitudes compared to the seat. Head rotations during quad-bike
    operation such as looking down at the terrain, or left or right when completing
    a turn would result in misaligned axes of the helmet IMU relative to the seat
    IMU. Misalignments due to head rotations would affect the transmissibility analyses,
    and may, in part, account for low spectral coherence in the X- and Y- axes, despite
    high X-axis vibration at the head. It is also possible that other factors influenced
    the high vibration exposure at the head. The head/neck complex in sitting and
    driving is essentially an open chain and not supported by any external structure.
    As the nature of most human function demands mobility of the cervical spine, it
    is highly likely that head-nodding phenomena will considerably magnify accelerations
    at lower frequencies, overlapping with spinal resonant frequencies in the X direction
    (Sandover, 1991, Paddan and Griffin, 1998). Although vibration transmitted via
    the quad bike handlebars to the hands, arms, and trunk might also contribute to
    linear vibration recorded at the head, they were not recorded in this study. Interestingly,
    there is evidence that hands on a steering wheel can reduce the biodynamic response
    to vibration exposure around 6 Hz while a secondary resonance appears to exist
    between 10 and 12 Hz (Rakheja et al. 2002). This may require further exploration
    relative to quad bike use. We chose to focus on the transference and amplification
    of linear vibration from the seat to the head/neck since the current standards
    (European Directive 2002/44/EC; ISO 2631-1) primarily draw conclusions on injury
    risk from linear measurements. However, rotational accelerations of the head/neck
    may be important in the development of neck pain and injury, based on the mechanical
    function of the cervical spine. For completeness, we also calculated rotational
    accelerations (pitch, roll, and yaw) at both the seat and the head. Spectral coherence
    between seat and head/neck rotational accelerations was only weakly observed for
    all three rotational degrees of freedom between 0.5 and 20 Hz (γ2 < 0.45). Despite
    the weak relationship between the seat and head, RMS rotational accelerations
    were still high. At the seat, pitch, roll, and yaw accelerations were 4.23 ± 0.55 rad/s2,
    3.23 ± 0.48 rad/s2, and 1.14 ± 0.30 rad/s2, respectively, which were considerably
    greater than rotational vibration previously measured in forestry, mining, and
    construction (Dickey et al., 2010). Rotational accelerations at the head/neck
    were even higher, with pitch, roll, and yaw accelerations of 7.92 ± 1.79 rad/s2,
    4.49 ± 0.76 rad/s2, and 3.69 ± 0.78 rad/s2. Further research is needed to determine
    the relationship between rotational vibration at the head/neck and musculoskeletal
    pain and injury, particularly during quad-bike use by rural workers. Although
    we did not question or explore the relationship to low back and neck pain, simultaneous
    exposure to resonant low back and head/neck vibration may be a factor in previously
    documented high prevalence rates for farmers who use quad bikes (Milosavljevic
    et al., 2012b). Seat characteristics may further influence Z-axis STHT; greater
    biodynamic response has also been observed with use of a higher seat, likely due
    to a larger proportion of supported body mass (Wang et al., 2004). This is supported
    by recent research where anthropometrics also influenced vibration exposure during
    quad bike use (Milosavljevic et al., 2012a). Further research that looks for such
    exposure relationships may help to identify common vibration (and mechanical shock)
    exposure factors (Kartha et al., 2014), or alternatively adverse postural disturbance
    for low back and neck disorders in rural workers. Participants in the current
    study wore an individually adjusted helmet with an attached IMU that had a combined
    mass of 0.5 kg. Calculation of mean head/neck mass from data published by Winter
    (2005) and extrapolated to the mean 80.9 kg body mass of participants in this
    study gives a head/neck mass of 6.6 kg. The addition of 0.5 kg therefore likely
    increased total head/neck mass by 7.6% to 7.1 kg. Although it is unknown what
    affect a 7.6% increase in mass will have on vibration exposure, we expect this
    to be minor on Z-axis vibration exposure, while the inertial effect of a 0.5 kg
    helmet may have amplified vibration exposure in the X and Y directions. We found
    mean and peak STHT was 1.44 (±0.08) and 1.66 (±0.14), respectively, between 1.3
    and 4.9 Hz, comparable to laboratory studies that exposed participants to either
    sinusoidal or randomly generated vibration (Hinz et al., 2001, Kim et al., 2005,
    Smith, 2001, Wang et al., 2006, Wang et al., 2008). Wang et al. (2006) also used
    accelerometry to quantify transmission, and found a similar peak amplification
    of 1.75 times at the head (relative to the seat) between 4 and 5 Hz. In a review
    of seated vibration exposure without a back rest, peak seat-to-head amplification
    was similar to our study, although the researchers noted a high degree of variability,
    17.2% lower to 28.0% higher than this study (Rakheja et al., 2010). Differences
    are likely attributable to the spectral characteristics of the vibration dosage,
    participant anthropometry, and methodology, including measurement techniques.
    Overall, our results overlap with values reported in the literature, suggesting
    high level of Z-axis transmissibility from operating farm equipment without a
    back rest, including quad bikes. We also determined that vertical acceleration
    measured at the head lagged behind acceleration measured at the seat, with a phase
    shift of −66.5° (±13.9°) at a frequency of 4.9 Hz. Wang et al. (2006) noted a
    phase lag of up to 100.0° between 4.0 and 5.0 Hz. However, there is a great degree
    of variability in phase angle as a function of frequency in the literature (Boileau
    et al., 1998, Rakheja et al., 2010). Although a phase lag generally increases
    from 0 to 20 Hz, Hinz and Seidel (1987) found a leading phase shift up to 4.0
    Hz. Interestingly, in our study, the phase lag increased from 0.5 to 5.6 Hz (−0.55°
    to −68.8°), and then gradually decreased thereafter (+5.5° at 20 Hz). While the
    diminished phase response may be indicative of reduced spectral power, occasionally
    observed in field studies, our results are in good agreement with the literature
    for frequencies that result in spinal resonance, particularly from 1.3 to 4.9
    Hz, where Z-axis coherence was above 0.8. The seat-to-head transfer function,
    including amplified and out-of-phase acceleration of the head/neck, may help explain
    the high prevalence of neck pain in farmers that use quad bikes (Milosavljevic
    et al., 2012b). In one study, kinematic data were fed into a finite element model
    of the spine to simulate the biodynamic response to seated WBV (Wang et al., 2010).
    Muscle recruitment was important to dynamic equilibrium and stability of the spine,
    resulting in greater spinal loading. Higher muscle activity may also induce muscle
    fatigue (Santos et al., 2008), influence coordination strategies (Falla et al.,
    2014), and inhibit proprioception (Zabihhosseinian et al., 2015). Recent research
    has investigated and demonstrated negative effects of occupational vibration on
    kinaesthetic and postural control of the head and trunk during standing (Mani
    et al., 2010, Mani et al., 2015), implying an alternative pathway to LBP from
    exposure to WBV. Greater muscle co-activation owing to vibration induced fatigue
    in concert with inhibited proprioception may increase sensorimotor noise for postural
    control, delaying response times and negatively influencing corrective movements
    (van Dieën et al., 2010). This paradigm may be particularly pertinent for driving
    on the farm, due to the frequency of postural disturbances from mechanical vibration
    and shock. Additional implications from this current field-based research include
    vehicle structure (e.g. seat, suspension, and tires), terrain, operator anthropometrics,
    and driving behaviour, which all govern vibration transmission through the spine,
    and ultimately the head/neck region. These factors were investigated in recently
    published research of WBV exposure in 130 rural workers that verifies the current
    findings recorded at the seat (Milosavljevic et al., 2011). The seat to head transmission
    components identified in the current study are consistent with high 7-day and
    12-month low back and neck pain prevalence rates previously identified by Milosavljevic
    et al. (2012b). 5. Conclusion Fieldwork exploration of rural workers using quad
    bikes demonstrated a strong relationship between simultaneously recorded vertical
    accelerations at the seat and head. Spectral analysis of Z-axis seat and head
    vibration revealed strong coherence between 1.3 and 4.9 Hz, with amplified and
    out-of-phase vertical vibration at the head/neck relative to the seat in this
    frequency range. While these results are indicative of spinal resonance in the
    vertical direction, the absence of published thresholds for the cervical spine
    means it is unknown whether the current exposure could lead to neck pain, previously
    observed in rural workers who use quad bikes (Milosavljevic et al., 2012b). Other
    factors such as mechanical shocks, sustained postures, and non-vibration factors
    such as manual materials handling may also play some part in musculoskeletal disorders
    of the neck in the farming community. These amplified and out-of-phase vibrations
    measured at the head relative to the pelvis, in this sample of rural workers using
    quad bikes, has become a focus for future laboratory based investigation to determine
    biodynamic, proprioceptive, and perceptual effects from such exposures. Acknowledgements

    performance.


    The paper''s findings are particularly relevant to the point on considerations
    for data volume, frequency, format, and source in automated irrigation systems
    because it provides empirical insights into how these factors influence the performance
    of wireless communication networks in agricultural settings. Specifically, the
    paper investigates the impact of PHY settings on the packet delivery ratio (PDR),
    which is a key measure of reliability in wireless networks.


    The paper''s strengths include:


    1. **Relevance**: The paper directly addresses the key issues pertaining to data
    volume, frequency, format, and source by examining how different PHY settings
    affect the reliability of LoRa networks in two distinct environments.

    2. **Insight**: The paper provides novel and meaningful information by demonstrating
    that PDR in tree farms is more sensitive to PHY factors compared to open areas.
    It also identifies specific PHY configurations that result in optimal performance
    in each environment.

    3. **Credibility**: The paper''s findings are based on rigorous experimentation
    and analysis, and the methodology is clearly described, enhancing the credibility
    of the results.

    4. **Scope**: The paper comprehensively covers topics relevant to the point on
    data considerations, including the effects of PHY settings on PDR, the comparison
    of performance in different environments, and the influence of external factors
    such as tree density.

    5. **Recency**: The paper is current and up-to-date, providing the most recent
    findings on LoRa network performance in agricultural settings.


    The paper''s limitations include:


    1. **Limited generalization**: The findings may not be generalizable to other
    agricultural environments, such as vineyards or orchards, due to differences in
    vegetation density and terrain.

    2. **Lack of consideration for other factors**: The paper only investigates the
    impact of PHY settings on PDR and does not consider other factors that may affect
    data considerations, such as data volume, frequency, and format.


    Overall, the paper provides valuable insights into the performance of LoRa networks
    in agricultural settings and its relevance to data considerations in automated
    irrigation systems. The findings can inform the design and implementation of reliable
    wireless communication networks for data collection and monitoring in agriculture.'

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Seoul, Korea (South) SECTION I. Introduction
    IoT(Internet of Things) applied to agriculture can be a great help to increase
    efficiency of growing crops. For applying IoT to agriculture industry, using a
    kind of devices and data obtained by sensing are essential. Sensing devices can
    make us gather useful and meaningful data from enormous farmland with little additional
    attentions. The data collected from wireless sensors in farmland also can help
    farmers to monitor the status of their crops and farmland and researchers to analyze
    the consistencies of growth of crops. There have been many attempts to implement
    IoT technology to agriculture. Furthermore, in agriculture with IoT, networking
    is one of the most important parts. Recently, LPWAN(Low-Power Wide Area Network)
    is most widely used network in IoT data communications. Because it is wireless
    network which allows long range communications at a lower bit rate compared to
    other wireless network. There are several kinds of LPWAN protocols, such as LoRa(Long-Range),
    NB-IoT(Narrow Band-Internet of Things), Sigfox and so on. NB-IoT has better advantages
    in coverage and QoS(Quality of Service). And Sigfox has better advantages in cost.
    On the other hand, LoRa is one of the great representatives among several LPWAN
    protocols to implement Agriculture IoT. Because LoRa has a lot of advantages,
    especially in terms of low costs and excellent battery performance in general.
    Although it is now on early stage, there have been a number of research focusing
    on evaluating the performance of LoRa, including reliability and coverage. Unfortunately,
    most of these researches are about experiments which is conducted in open area,
    urban area or several crop farms. Researches about tree farm were not done so
    far before. Therefore, in our paper, we did some experiments to verify LoRa network
    performance according to changing PHY setting in tree farm and open area. We focused
    on investigating performance with changing PHY(Physical layer) factors to measure
    the performances such as reliability and distance. As a result of, we can show
    up the results which is acquired by our experiments from this experiments in this
    paper. SECTION II. Related Work In a tree farm, tree for Christmas sales needs
    a period of at least six years and takes up to 50 years to become timber for building
    or furniture. Failure to manage tree farm properly and not be able to harvest
    good quality trees will result in long losses of time and investment. If IoT is
    applied to manage the tree farm efficiently, in long losses of time and investment
    can be prevented. As mentioned above, There are several kinds of LPWAN protocols
    like LoRa, NB-IoT, Sigfox and so on. Among these things, we thought Lora is the
    best for IoT network. Because it can reduce the cost of building initial equipment
    and environment for IoT network much more than NB-IoT. In addition, LoRa is open
    to everyone, therefore it can make a lot of partnership with companies and constructive
    ecosystem for IoT [12], [13]. It means that it has richable environment than NB-IoT
    and Sigfox. There are no previous works that use the LoRa network in tree farm.
    On the other hand, there are works that have tested the performance of LoRa networks
    in urban areas, mountains, and open area. In urban areas, the packet delivery
    ratio varies depending on the location of the building [10]. In the mountain,
    the packet delivery ratio varies with the altitude of the terrain [8]. In the
    open area, the packet delivery ratio per distance was higher than that of mountain
    and urban area, because there is no obstacle in the open area [7]. Testing and
    analyzing LoRa network performance on a tree farm will provide useful information
    for someone who wants to use IoT to their tree farm. And testing and analyzing
    LoRa network performance in open area will provide useful information for comparing
    with a few areas such as mountains and urban areas. Above all, we investigated
    technical background and definition of LoRaWAn, because it is main subject in
    our paper. LoRaWAN is a Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN). It is a chirp spread
    spectrum modulation scheme using wideband linear frequency which improves receiver
    sensitivity and tolerance to miscommunication between receiver and transmitter
    [3]. LoRa network has three significant features. The first one is low cost. It
    reduces costs in three ways: infrastructure investment, operating expenses and
    end-node sensors [4]. Also, LoRa uses license-free sub Gigahertz radio frequency
    bands like 169 MHz, 433 MHz, 868 MHz (Europe) and 915 MHz (North America). Since
    LoRa uses low frequency bands, we can minimize the cost for building network [5].
    Second one is low power. Its protocol is designed specifically for low power consumption
    extending battery lifetime up to 20 years. And the last one is long range. Single
    base station provides deep penetration in dense urban/indoor regions, plus connects
    rural areas up to 30 miles away. Besides, LoRa network uses a star topology network.
    A number of networks using LoRa can provide coverage that is greater in range
    compared to that of existing cellular networks [1]. Existing studies on LoRa are
    so few, and most of them are focusing on experiments performed in mountain [8],
    underground [7] or over water with the end-device attached to the radio mast of
    a boat [9]. Furthermore, the concept of Fresnel zone clearance may be used to
    analyze interference by obstacles near the path of a radio beam. The first zone
    must be kept largely free from obstructions to avoid interfering with the radio
    reception. However, some obstruction of the Fresnel zones can often be tolerated.
    As a rule of thumb the maximum obstruction allowable is 40%, but the recommended
    obstruction is 20% or less [2]. SECTION III. Performance Comparison It takes up
    to 50 years to produce wooden timber. In addition, price fluctuations due to the
    quality of wood are very large. Therefore, if you cannot manage the tree farm
    properly and cannot harvest the quality trees, the profit and the loss is very
    high. Also, since the scale of the tree farm is considerably large, it is thought
    that it is necessary to manage it effectively. So, we considered about applying
    IoT. With IoT, everyone who wants to grow up own crops can efficiently manage
    large-scale tree farm and save a significant amount of time and money. One of
    the most attended IoT communication technology is LoRa network. We used it to
    analyze network performance in a tree farm by changing PHY factors. Also, We conducted
    the same experiments in open area and analyzed LoRa network performance and compared
    characteristics of LoRa network by PHY factors. A lot of previous works tested
    the performance of the LoRa network in mountainous and urban areas. However, there
    are no researches to test the performance of a LoRa network in a tree farm. In
    mountainous areas, the packet transmission rate is affected by the altitude of
    the terrain [8]; urban areas are affected by the location of the building [10].
    Therefore, we supposed to have some experiments which check the effects of the
    factors affecting the packet transmission rate in the tree farm, and compared
    the performance according to locations, tree farm, open area. In addition, the
    definition of PHY factors and understanding is very important part of this paper.
    LoRa''s communication performance can be fine-tuned by varying the selection of
    several PHY settings, including bandwidth(BW), spreading factor(SF), coding rate(CR),
    transmission power(Tx). 1) Spreading Factor Representing the number of chirps
    per symbol used in the treatment of data before transmission of the signal. It
    can take values from 6 to 12. The larger the spreading factor, the more the receiver
    will be capable to recognize the right symbol. However, a larger spreading factor
    also increases the transmission time to send a packet [8]. 2) Bandwidth Varying
    the range of frequencies (bandwidth) over which LoRa spread allows for trading
    radio air time against radio sensitivity, thus energy efficiency against communication
    range and robustness. The higher is the bandwidth, the shorter is the air time
    and the lower is the sensitivity. A lower bandwidth also requires a more accurate
    crystal in order to minimize problems related to the clock drift. Typically the
    range of the bandwidth is between 125… 500 kHz [7]. 3) Coding Rate Coding Rate
    is the FEC(Forward Error Correction) rate used by the LoRa modem that offers protection
    against bursts of interference, and can be set to either 4/5, 4/6, 4/7 or 4/8.
    A higher CR offers more protection, but increases time on air. Radios with different
    CR can still communicate with each other if they use an explicit header, as the
    CR of the payload is stored in the header of the packet [11]. 4) Transmission
    Power Similar to most other wireless radios, LoRa transceivers also allow transmission
    power adjustment. However, increasing transmission power accompanies drastic increase
    of energy consumption for packet transmission [7]. Thus, adjusting transmission
    power is not a viable option to improve the performance of LoRa network. Due to
    the reason stated above, we control only three PHY settings, leaving Transmission
    Power unchanged. Thus, the performance of the LoRa network is analyzed by adjusting
    only spreading factor, bandwidth, and coding rate. A. Research Environment We
    used the LoRa IoT Development Kit made by Dragino company located in China. It
    offers LoRa shield based on Semtech SX1276 chip and ‘LGOI-P’ LoRa Gateway. Furthermore,
    two arduino equipped with an SX1276 radio module that works in the 915 MHz band
    and photosensitive, flame, temperature and humidity sensor was packaged. To get
    data on the temperature and humidity of the day we used DHT11 sensor made by Dragino
    which is a composite sensor that contains a calibrated digital signal output of
    temperature and humidity Table 1. Research development environment B. Experimental
    Method 5) Sites Our experiments were performed three times in the same tree farm.
    The tree farm is located at 13455 S 525 W, Romney, IN 47981, USA. It has a flat
    meadow, but some small hills in the middle and maple trees, oak trees, pine trees
    are planted. The other place is located at Stadium Mall, Purdue University, West
    Lafayette, IN 47907, USA. Fig. 1. Experiments sites (a: Tree farm, b: Open area)
    Show All 6) PHY Settings and Data Packet Table 2. Arduino node ID according to
    PHY setting The experiment was carried out by assigning a Node ID according to
    each PHY Setting. Table 1 shows these variant settings. In this experiment, we
    want to check the communication ability of each node according to PHY factor.
    SF can be set from 6 to 12. We set SF to 7 (default), 9, and 11 evenly distributed.
    The CR is set to a minimum value of 5 and a maximum value of 8. BW is basically
    set to 125kHz. But only SF7 can be set to 250kHz, so we tested SF7 in two cases
    of 125kHz and 250kHz. The value of TX power was fixed at 13(default). Considering
    the Fresnel Zone in 200m of 60% of 1st Fresnel zone, receiver''s and transmitter''s
    antenna were fixed 2.5m above the ground by using poll. We needed 4 gateways since
    in LoRaWAn spreading factor and bandwidth are orthogonal. However, prior researches
    showed LoRa shields with different coding rate can transmit data packets to the
    same gateway. Therefore, each two settings with same spreading factor and bandwidth
    and different coding rate, such as 001 and 002, sent data packets to one gateway.
    Table 3. Data packet composition The data structures of payload used in transmitted
    data packets is character type and has 9 bytes of size. The first three bytes
    make it possible to distinguish which setting is sending data. We sent data with
    3 second interval with 0.5 second of delay between sensing. Each time, nodes collected
    150 data packets at one position according to distance 100, 150, 200M. We set
    the transceivers not to retransmit lost data so as to check packet delivery rate
    accurately. If we didn''t get data packet right, we considered it as data loss
    and skipped to the next data packet transmission right away. Maintaining same
    conditions, every end-device is operated on different distances, 100m, 150m and
    200m. The same conditions mentioned here refer to the temperature and humidity
    of the day tested. First experiment was conducted on the day with temperature
    25°C, humidity 80%, Second on temperature 24°C, humidity 62%. The third experiment
    was done on temperature 27°C, humidity 70%. We put shields in a box to minimize
    meteorological factors affecting experiment results. Every experiment was carried
    out for about three hours. Plus, all the experiments were performed at a height
    of 2.5m, considering Fresnel zone of LoRa network frequency and overall tree farm
    area. The result data was made by averaging each three experiment results. In
    addition, Fresnel zone test were not done with every different setting. LoRa Shield''s
    PHY Setting conditions are set to default values. SF was set to 7, BW was set
    to 125, and CR was set to 5, and the experiment was conducted under the same conditions
    with the change of height only at Om, 1m, 2m, and 3m at 200m. We received only
    100 packets to figure out tendency of performance improvement accordance with
    height. C. Metrics When experiments are done, we calculated reliability and RSSI
    (Received Signal Strength Indication) to analyze data of different settings at
    different distance. Reliability is calculated as the ratio of valid received packets
    to the number of packets transmitted to the Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), which
    provides information about the reliability of the communication [8]. RSSI is a
    measurement of the power present in a received radio signal [6]. PDR= D T ∗100

    Results of each setting at different distance in open area Show All Fig. 4. PDR
    graph in tree farm Show All Fig. 5. PDR graph in open area Show All First of all,
    a noticeable comparison between tree farm and open area is that the variation
    of tree farm is bigger than the variation of open area. For that reason, we can
    recognize that PDR is more sensitive to PHY factors in the tree farm. Therefore,
    setting PHY factors properly will be helpful for creating an environment of IoT
    in tree farm. This will be discussed in future studies. In general, it appears
    that PDR is higher in the open area. In the tree farm, you can see that CR8 has
    higher PDR than CR5 in 100M and 200M; 001 and 002, 003 and 004, 005 and 006. However,
    in the open area, only the variation of PDR according to CR is theoretically increased.
    In addition, as SF increases, PDR also increases like odd numbered ID 001, 003,
    005 and even numbered ID 002, 004, 006 in tree farm. At last, we can only find
    the difference according to changing BW 125 to 250 in the comparison of 001 and
    007, 002 and 008 in 150M in the tree farm. And we can also find out the difference
    between 001 and 007 in 100M, 002 and 008 in 150M. Fig. 6. RSSI graph in tree farm
    Show All Fig. 7. RSSI graph in open area Show All The variation of RSSI appears
    more consistently in tree farm than in open area. RSSI in tree farm are quite
    plain than RSSI in open area. The reason will be treated in future studies. In
    this study, we cannot identify why the measured RSSI in open area looked similar
    over the three different distances. We plan to find out the reason in the next
    stage of the work. SECTION IV. Conclusion In this paper, we had done some experiments
    to analyze the performance of LoRa network in two places, tree farm and open area.
    Among many LPWAN protocols, the reason why we choose LoRa is because it can be
    deployed with much less costs and have rich ecosystem due to alliance with many
    participating companies. In addition, there were no researches to verify the performance
    of LoRa network for tree farm. So, we had done three times experiments in tree
    farm by adjusting the PHY configuration setting of nodes using LoRa network. Also,
    we wanted to compare the performance of LoRa network in tree farm with open area
    after conducted three more times experiments in open area. It is for checking
    which PHY factors have powerful effects to communications by using LoRa network.
    Consequently, we can find some points. First, comparison between tree farm and
    open area is that the variation of tree farm is bigger than the variation of open
    area. So, we can recognize that PDR is more sensitive to PHY factors in the tree
    farm. Second, it appears that PDR is higher in the open area than the tree farm.
    However, in the open area, only the variation of PDR according to CR is theoretically
    increased. In addition, as SF increases, PDR also increases like odd numbered
    ID 001, 003, 005 and even numbered ID 002, 004, 006 in tree farm. At last, we
    can only find the difference according to changing BW 120 to 250 in the comparison
    of 001 and 007, 002 and 008 in 150M in the tree farm. And we can also find out
    the difference between 001 and 007 in 100M, 002 and 008 in 150M. Additionally,
    the variation of RSSI appears more consistently in tree farm than in open area.
    RSSI in tree farm are quite plain than RSSI in open area. The reason will be treated
    in future studies. In future work, we will study effects of external environment
    to LoRa network performance and make more nodes to compare each other and verify
    its performance more precisely. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This research was supported by

- analysis: 'The paper titled "Field microclimate monitoring system based on wireless
    sensor network" is related to the consideration of data volume, frequency, format,
    and source in the context of irrigation management data. It describes the design
    and implementation of a field microclimate monitoring system using wireless sensor
    networks, focusing on real-time data acquisition and transmission from the field
    to a big data analysis platform.


    While the paper does not explicitly discuss automated irrigation management, it
    provides insights into data collection and transmission aspects that are relevant
    to the broader context of real-time irrigation management. By highlighting the
    importance of real-time data acquisition and wireless transmission, the paper
    contributes to the understanding of data considerations for automated irrigation
    systems that require timely and accurate data for decision-making and control.


    However, the paper''s focus on a specific wireless sensor network-based monitoring
    system limits its scope in addressing the broader considerations of data volume,
    frequency, format, and source in the context of irrigation management data. It
    does not provide comprehensive insights into the specific requirements and challenges
    of data management for automated irrigation systems or discuss different data
    sources and formats commonly used in this domain.


    Overall, the paper''s relevance to the specific point within the literature review
    is moderate, as it provides some insights into data acquisition and transmission
    aspects but lacks a broader perspective on data considerations for automated irrigation
    management.'

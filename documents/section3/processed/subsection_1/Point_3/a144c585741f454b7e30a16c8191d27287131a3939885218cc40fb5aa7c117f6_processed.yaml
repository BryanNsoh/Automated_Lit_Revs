    \ of investments in the agricultural sector has increased by\n80%. The goal of\
    \ these investments is to achieve productivity growth of at least 70% by 2050\
    \ [1] to meet\nthe increased needs of the population of the Earth considering\
    \ the fact that the area under cultivation\nwill decrease. Emerging technologies\
    \ such as Internet of Things (IoT) can provide signiﬁcant potential\nin Precision\
    \ Agriculture and Smart Farming, enabling the long-term increase in productivity\
    \ [2].\nThe IoT (Internet of Things) paradigm offers a new perspective for precision\
    \ agriculture enabling the\nreal- time and site speciﬁc management of the cultivated\
    \ ﬁelds. In IoT-based Smart farming, a system\nis built for monitoring the crops\
    \ targeting in the automation of various important farming operations\nsuch as\
    \ monitoring of the growth, irrigation process, application of fertilizers, disease\
    \ detection, etc.\nIn this context, technologies such as IoT can assist in the\
    \ acquisition of real-time information from the\nagricultural ﬁelds. This information\
    \ can be timely processed and exploited to support critical decisions\nregarding\
    \ the management of the crops.\nInformation 2019, 10, 349; doi:10.3390/info10110349\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/information\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n2 of 26\nRemote sensing\
    \ is generally considered one of the most important technologies for Precision\n\
    Agriculture and Smart Farming. It is commonly used for monitoring cultivated ﬁelds,\
    \ providing\neffective solutions for Precision Agriculture in the last 35 years\
    \ [3]. Remote sensing can monitor many\ncrops and vegetation parameters through\
    \ images at various wavelengths. In the past, remote sensing\nwas often based\
    \ on satellite images [4,5] or images acquired by using manned aircraft in order\
    \ to\nmonitor vegetation status at speciﬁc growth stages. However, satellite imagery\
    \ is often not the best\noption because of the low spatial resolution of images\
    \ acquired and the restrictions of the temporal\nresolutions as satellites are\
    \ not always available to capture the necessary images. In addition, it is often\n\
    required to wait long periods between acquisition and reception of images. In\
    \ addition, environmental\nconditions, such as clouds, often hinder their reliable\
    \ use. Considering the use of manned aircrafts,\nusually it results in high costs,\
    \ and many times it is not possible to carry out multiple ﬂights to obtain\nmore\
    \ than a few crop images.\nThe development of UAV-based remote sensing systems\
    \ have taken remote sensing and Precision\nAgriculture (PA) one step further.\
    \ The use of UAVs to monitor crops offers great possibilities to acquire\nﬁeld\
    \ data in an easy, fast and cost-effective way compared to previous methods. UAV-based\
    \ IoT\ntechnology is considered as the future of remote sensing in Precision Agriculture.\
    \ UAVs’ ability to ﬂy\nat a low altitude results in ultra-high spatial resolution\
    \ images of the crops (i.e., a few centimeters).\nThis signiﬁcantly improves the\
    \ performance of the monitoring systems. Furthermore, UAV-based\nmonitoring systems\
    \ have high temporal resolution as they can be used at the user’s will. This enhances\n\
    the ﬂexibility of the image acquisition process. In addition, UAVs are a lot simpler\
    \ to use and also\ncheaper than manned aircrafts. Moreover, they are more efﬁcient\
    \ than the ground systems as they can\ncover a large ﬁeld in a short amount of\
    \ time and in a non-destructive way, which is very important.\nUAVs are not a\
    \ recent technology since the ﬁrst attempt to construct a powered UAV was recorded\n\
    in 1916 [6]. UAVs were initially exploited for military purposes; however, in\
    \ recent years, their use has\nrapidly expanded to other types of applications\
    \ (commercial, scientiﬁc, agricultural, etc.). The wider\nuse of UAVs was led\
    \ by the technology advancements and the miniaturization of the associated\nhardware\
    \ during the 1980s and 1990s.\nUnmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) are now very commonly\
    \ used in remote sensing applications\nfor Precision Agriculture. Equipped with\
    \ sensors of different types, UAVs can be exploited to identify\nwhich zones of\
    \ the crops need different management, e.g. some kind of input. This gives the\
    \ farmers the\nability to react on time in any problem detected. UAS can be used\
    \ in a plethora of different applications\non Precision Agriculture, such as health\
    \ monitoring and disease detection, growth monitoring and\nyield estimation, weed\
    \ management and detection, etc. As the use of UAVs in PA applications is very\n\
    frequent in the last years and it is considered the future of remote sensing,\
    \ it is a ﬁeld that draws a\nlot of attention. Thus, several reviews exist for\
    \ their application in Precision Agriculture and Smart\nFarming. Most of the reviews\
    \ focus mainly on the different types of applications that UAVs can have in\n\
    agricultural crops [7–12] or environmental monitoring in general [13]. In [14],\
    \ the authors reviewed the\nhyperspectral imagery and the techniques used in these\
    \ cases. Maes et al. [15] focused on the suitability\nof the different available\
    \ sensors for each application, providing with important perspectives for the\n\
    use of UAVs in PA. However, this work does not review the techniques used for\
    \ exploiting the acquired\ninformation. In addition, a survey that discusses the\
    \ use of Deep Learning in agricultural data has\nbeen conducted [16].\nTo the\
    \ best of the authors knowledge, a review focusing also on the most frequently\
    \ used\ntechniques exploiting and processing UAV imagery from agricultural ﬁelds\
    \ is currently missing from\nthe literature, despite its necessity. We believe\
    \ that it is very important mainly because the absence of a\nstandardized workﬂow\
    \ is one of the major drawbacks that affects the wider use of UAV systems in\n\
    commercial PA applications. This fact results in the adoption of a variety of\
    \ heterogeneous procedures\nand methods by different researchers, for the same\
    \ goal. This results to not always having the best\noutcome. Furthermore, we believe\
    \ that a study reviewing the most recent works is of paramount\nimportance, as\
    \ it is a research area that is advancing really quickly. In this work we extend\
    \ [17],\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n3 of 26\nreviewing the most recent studies\
    \ about UAV-based applications for PA, focusing on the most common\ntechniques\
    \ applied on UAV imagery in recent works to monitor crop ﬁelds in Precision Agriculture.\n\
    The goal is to identify the most used sensors and practices for each type of application.\n\
    To properly perform a review on UAV applications in Precision Agriculture, we\
    \ formulated the\nfollowing research questions (RQs):\n1.\nWhich are the different\
    \ types of UAV applications in Precision Agriculture? In this research\nquestion,\
    \ we aim to explore the current trends in the application of UAVs in precision\
    \ agriculture.\nThe initial goal of UAVs in their early application in agriculture\
    \ was to derive direct image-based\nproducts.\nNowadays, this has changed, and\
    \ the applications of UAVs in agriculture are\nintelligence-based oriented products\
    \ that process images and provide informed decision-making\napplications to the\
    \ farmers. In this question, we provide a thorough description of the different\n\
    types of applications that UAVs can support based on the different operational\
    \ needs of\nagriculture ﬁelds.\n2.\nWhat types of crops are monitored by UAV systems?\
    \ In this research question, our target is\nto record the different types of crops\
    \ that have been monitored so far with the help of UAVs.\nAdditionally, we provide\
    \ general information regarding the geographical distribution of these\ncrops,\
    \ their size and the different stages of growth where monitoring can take place.\
    \ By answering\nthis research question, we can identify how the different characteristics\
    \ of each crop and its life\ncycle affect the use of UAVs.\n3.\nWhich UAV system\
    \ technologies are adopted in Precision Agriculture?\nIn this research\nquestion,\
    \ we identify the system characteristics of UAV-based applications for Precision\n\
    Agriculture. By answering this question we can locate the speciﬁc UAV types and\
    \ sensors\nthat can be used for monitoring crops.\n4.\nWhat types of data can\
    \ be acquired by UAVs? In this research question, we record the different\ntypes\
    \ of data that can be acquired by UAVs based on the sensor technology employed.\
    \ We also\nprovide a review of the advantages and disadvantages of the different\
    \ types of data that can be\ngathered with the help of different sensors based\
    \ on the associated cost and the types of the ﬁeld\noperations applied.\n5.\n\
    Which data processing methods can be used to exploit the agricultural data acquired\
    \ by UAVs?\nIn this research question, we identify the methods that are used for\
    \ image analysis in agricultural\ncrops. We distinguish between three types of\
    \ data processing methods that can be used alone or\ncomplementary so as to gain\
    \ insights regarding a ﬁeld namely: (a) Photogrammetric techniques;\n(b) Machine\
    \ Learning techniques; and (c) Vegetation Indices.\nTo answer these research questions,\
    \ we reviewed 100 recent papers [18–117] published during the\n2017–2019 period.\n\
    The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the basic\
    \ UAV-based applications\nfor Precision Agriculture, including the types of crops\
    \ being monitored, the application domains and\nthe UAV technologies being used\
    \ for Precision Agriculture purposes. In Section 3, we focus on the\nbasics of\
    \ UAV-based data acquisition and the types of sensors used. Section 4 discusses\
    \ the most\nused image processing methods that stood out in the literature: the\
    \ photogrammetry techniques, the\nvegetation indices calculation and machine learning.\
    \ Next, Section 5 focuses on the limitations in the\nuse of UAVs for Precision\
    \ Agriculture. Finally, Section 6 discusses the results of the review and make\n\
    some concluding remarks.\n2. UAV-Based Monitoring of Crops\nIn this section, we\
    \ introduce the applications of UAVs for Precision Agriculture, along with the\n\
    types of crops being monitored and the UAV technologies adopted.\nInformation\
    \ 2019, 10, 349\n4 of 26\n2.1. Types of UAV Applications in Precision Agriculture\n\
    To date, UAV technologies have been successfully employed in a variety of applications\
    \ for\nPrecision Agriculture such as site-speciﬁc herbicide applications, water\
    \ deﬁciency identiﬁcation,\ndetection of diseases, etc. Using the information\
    \ acquired by the UAVs several decisions can be made\nto handle the problem(s)\
    \ detected and/or optimize harvesting by estimating the yield.\nThe most common\
    \ applications of UAVs for Precision Agriculture, as recorded in the literature,\n\
    are the following:\n•\nWeed mapping and management [70,98]\n•\nVegetation growth\
    \ monitoring and yield estimation [48,65,87]\n•\nVegetation health monitoring\
    \ and diseases detection [46,77]\n•\nIrrigation management [64,118]\n•\nCorps\
    \ spraying [89,95]\nAmong the most popular application of UAVs in Precision Agriculture\
    \ is Weed mapping.\nWeeds are not desirable plants, which grow in agricultural\
    \ crops and can cause several problems.\nThey are competing for available resources\
    \ such as water or even space, causing losses to crop yields\nand in their growth.\
    \ In addition to the problems in the growth of the crops, weeds can cause problems\n\
    at harvesting. The use of herbicides is the dominant choice for weed control.\
    \ In conventional farming,\nthe most common practice of weed management is to\
    \ spray the same amounts of herbicides over the\nentire ﬁeld, even within the\
    \ weed-free areas. However, the overuse of herbicides can result in the\nevolution\
    \ of herbicide-resistant weeds and it can affect the growth and yield of the crops.\
    \ In addition,\nit poses a heavy pollution threat to the environment. In addition,\
    \ the above practice signiﬁcantly\nincreases the cost. To overcome the above problems,\
    \ in Precision Agriculture practices, Site-Speciﬁc\nWeed Management (SSWM) is\
    \ used. SSWM refers to the spatially variable application of herbicides\nrather\
    \ than spraying them in the whole ﬁeld. In this context, the ﬁeld is divided into\
    \ management\nzones that each one receives a customized management, as usually\
    \ weed plants spread through only\nfew spots of the ﬁeld. To achieve this goal,\
    \ it is necessary to generate an accurate weed cover map for\nprecise spraying\
    \ of herbicide. UAVs can gather images and derive data from the whole ﬁeld that\
    \ can\nbe used to generate a precise weed cover map depicting the spots where\
    \ the chemicals are needed:\n(a) the most; (b) the least; or (c) they should not\
    \ be applied at all.\nUAVs are also frequently used for Monitoring the growth\
    \ of the vegetation and providing\nestimation regarding the yield. The lack of\
    \ means for systematically monitoring the progress of\ncultivation is considered\
    \ as one of the major obstacles to increasing the agricultural productivity\n\
    and quality. This problem is also compounded by the variability of weather conditions\
    \ that alter the\nmicro-climate of crops jeopardizing the agricultural production.\
    \ Regular collection of information\nand visualization of crops using UAVs, provides\
    \ increased opportunities to monitor crop growth\nand record the variability observed\
    \ in several parameters of the ﬁeld. Many recent works focus on\nmonitoring the\
    \ biomass and nitrogen status of the crops along with yield estimation. Biomass\
    \ is the\nmost common crop parameter, which together with information related\
    \ to nitrogen content can be\nused to determine the need for additional fertilizer\
    \ or other actions. In addition, the information\nacquired by the UAVs can be\
    \ used for the creation of three-dimensional digital maps of the crop, and\nfor\
    \ the measurement of various parameters, such as crop height, distance between\
    \ rows or between\nplants, and the index Leaf Area Index (LAI). UAVs offer the\
    \ potential to systematically collect crop\ninformation, therefore farmers can\
    \ plan in a controlled manner the crop management, use of inputs\n(e.g., use of\
    \ nutrients), timing of harvesting and soil and yield pathogens, or even identify\
    \ possible\nmanagement errors.\nUAVs are also used to monitor vegetation health.\
    \ Crop health is a very important factor that\nneeds to be monitored, as diseases\
    \ in crops can cause signiﬁcant economic loss due to the reduced yield\nand the\
    \ reduction of quality. Crops should be monitored constantly to detect the diseases\
    \ in time and\navoid spreading problems. Traditionally, this task is performed\
    \ by human experts directly in the ﬁeld.\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n5 of 26\n\
    However, this can be very time consuming, as it can require months to inspect\
    \ an entire crop preventing\nthe potentials of “continuous” monitoring. Another\
    \ common disease control method is the application\nof pesticides in certain dates.\
    \ Such a strategy incurs a high cost and also increases the likelihood of\nground\
    \ water contamination as pesticide residues in the products. In Precision Agriculture,\
    \ site-speciﬁc\ndisease control takes place. PA practices adopt a decision-based\
    \ disease management strategy, in which\nautomated non-destructive crops disease\
    \ detection plays a very important role. Disease detection\nis feasible as diseases\
    \ induce changes in biophysical and biochemical characteristics of the crops.\n\
    UAV-based data processing technologies use crop imaging information to identify\
    \ changes in plant\nbiomass and their health. Therefore, diseases can be detected\
    \ in their early stages enabling farmers\nto intervene in order to reduce losses.\
    \ In this context, UAVs can be used in the two different stages\nof disease control:\
    \ (a) at the initial stage of infection by collecting crop health relevant information,\n\
    during which UAVs can detect a possible infection before visual indications appear\
    \ and map the size of\nthe infection to different parts of a culture; and (b)\
    \ during the treatment of infection when farmers can\nuse UAVs for targeted spraying\
    \ as well as for accurately monitoring the course of their intervention.\nCrop\
    \ irrigation management is a very important area of application of UAV technologies\
    \ in\nPrecision Agriculture. Currently, 70% of the water consumed worldwide is\
    \ used for the irrigation of\ncrops [119,120], a fact that highlights the need\
    \ for precision irrigation techniques. Precision irrigation\ntechniques can improve\
    \ the efﬁciency of water use, so that the resource is applied effectively: (a)\
    \ in\nthe right places; (b) at the right time; and (c) in the right quantity.\
    \ The detection of the areas where\nmajor irrigation is needed can help the farmers\
    \ to save time and water resources. At the same time,\nsuch precision farming\
    \ techniques can lead to increased crop productivity and quality. In the context\n\
    of precision agriculture, the ﬁeld is divided in different irrigation zones, to\
    \ precisely manage the\nresources. The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles incorporating\
    \ suitable sensor types makes it possible\nto identify parts of a crop that need\
    \ more water. At the same time, the above technologies allow for the\nproduction\
    \ of specialized maps that illustrate the morphology of the soil, thus supporting\
    \ the more\nefﬁcient irrigation planning of each crop separately.\nAn application\
    \ of UAVs in precision agriculture that is more rarely met is Crop spraying. The\
    \ main\nspraying equipment used in conventional farming are the manual air-pressure\
    \ and battery-powered\nknapsack sprayers. However, these conventional sprayers\
    \ can cause major pesticide losses. In addition,\nthe operators need to be present\
    \ when spraying, which leads to exposure of the operators. In addition,\nit may\
    \ be time-consuming to spray the entire ﬁeld, which is not only limiting the resources\
    \ but also can\nlead to not-timely spraying. In this manner, UAVs can be useful\
    \ due to the lower operator exposure\nand improved ability to apply chemicals\
    \ in a timely and highly spatially resolved manner. The use\nof precision systems\
    \ for measuring distances allows UAVs to follow the morphology of the ground,\n\
    keeping their height constant. Therefore, an aircraft has the ability to spray\
    \ the appropriate amount\nof herbicide spatially, adjusting both its height and\
    \ the amount it sprays depending on the crop site\nin which it is located. Crop\
    \ spraying is particularly important in cases where diseases have been\nidentiﬁed\
    \ where it is important to reduce pesticide use without affecting crop yield.\
    \ In conclusion,\nUAV-based systems can make a decisive contribution to crop spray\
    \ management.\nIn addition to the common applications mentioned above, UAVs have\
    \ also been used for soil\nanalysis [108,112], cotton genotype selection [48],\
    \ mammal detection [24], and assessment of soil\nelectrical conductivity [66].\n\
    2.2. Types and Properties of Crops Monitored by UAV-Based Systems\nIn the recent\
    \ years, UAV technologies have been employed to monitor a variety of different\
    \ types\nof crops, located in several countries all over the world. UAV applications\
    \ in Precision Agriculture\nhave been carried out in 29 different countries. The\
    \ majority of applications are located in economically\ndeveloped countries, with\
    \ the US and China standing out. Lately, however, the applications in Europe\n\
    have increased as well.\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n6 of 26\nRegarding the different\
    \ types of crop species that can be monitored with the help of UAVs, more\nthan\
    \ 30 different species were identiﬁed. Among the most common crop species monitored\
    \ by UAV\ntechnologies are Maize, Wheat, Cotton, Vineyards, Rice and Soya. In\
    \ addition, we observe that these\ntechnologies have been used to monitor crops\
    \ with completely different characteristics, such as olive\ntrees and rice crops.\n\
    Another observation is that the monitoring of crops can take place during the\
    \ different stages\nof growth, even at the early ones before being able to draw\
    \ inferences from soil characteristics.\nThe purpose of constant and continuous\
    \ monitoring of crops at different stages of development\nis to record various\
    \ factors that may affect the ﬁnal performance of crops, as well as to evaluate\n\
    the effectiveness of actions taken to address problems identiﬁed at an earlier\
    \ stage of development.\nRegarding the size of the crops monitored we observe\
    \ in this review that it is possible:\n•\nTo monitor large ﬁelds (>10 ha), where\
    \ data are collected from all areas.\n•\nTo monitor small farms or small parts\
    \ of a ﬁeld.\n•\nTo monitor areas of great heterogeneity. This is achieved by\
    \ using a UAV equipped with automatic\npilot systems and ground-level sensors.\n\
    2.3. UAV System Technologies\nAn Unmanned Aerial System that applies to Precision\
    \ Agriculture usually includes the following\nkey elements [121]:\n•\nOne or more\
    \ UAVs: Flying vehicles that have no operator on their spindle but operate either\n\
    autonomously or remotely.\n•\nA Ground Control Station (GCS): It is a computer\
    \ that either communicates with the UAV Control\nSystem or controls and monitors\
    \ the UAV directly. The GCS monitors information related to the\nﬂight of the\
    \ UAV. The user has the ability to receive data relevant to the ﬂight of the aircraft,\
    \ but\nalso data recorded by the sensors that support the ﬂight (i.e., ground-based\
    \ sensors or sensors\nembedded in the aircraft). In addition, the GCS contains\
    \ the software required for the processing\nof data acquired by the UAV and the\
    \ extraction of the information needed by the system operator\nfor the crop monitoring.\n\
    •\nUAV Control System (UAV CS): It is used to control the UAV. It can be either\
    \ a two-way data\nlink, such as a remote control, or a built-in computer (usually\
    \ with a built in GPS). The UAV CS\nincludes the ﬂight control system and/or the\
    \ autopilot system, which controls the operation of\nthe UAV. This system receives\
    \ and processes data from the autopilot or ﬂight control system for\nthe proper\
    \ operation of the UAV. It usually contains sensors to monitor the ﬂight properties,\
    \ such\nas sensors for measuring distance from ground, air force, etc. The control\
    \ system has the ability to\nprocess information from sensors to correct any problems\
    \ that may arise, and to communicate\nwith the GCC wireless and in real time by\
    \ sending and receiving the necessary information.\n•\nSensors for data acquisition:\
    \ They are cameras intended to collect the information needed. The\nnext section\
    \ provides a detailed presentation of possible ways of collecting information\
    \ and the\ntechnologies exploited. In the case that UAVs are not intended to collect\
    \ information but are used\nfor another purpose, such as spraying, the sensors\
    \ are replaced with the necessary components.\nFocusing on the UAV technologies\
    \ being used for PA, the types of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles can\nbe divided into\
    \ ﬁve basic categories, based on their design characteristics (see Figure 1).\n\

    \ (Tetracam) [90].\n1.\nFixed-wing: These are unmanned planes with wings that\
    \ require a runway to take off from\nthe ground or a catapult. This type of UAVs\
    \ has high endurance as well as the ability to\nﬂy at high speeds. In addition,\
    \ ﬁxed-wing UAVs have the ability to cover large areas on\neach ﬂight and can\
    \ carry more payload. However, they are more expensive than the other\ntypes.\
    \ In the works reviewed, 22% used ﬁxed-wing UAVs. One type of ﬁxed-wing UAVs that\n\
    has not been identiﬁed in the reviewed literature, but is a very promising technology,\
    \ is the\nsolar-powered UAVs [124]. Solar-powered UAVs offer signiﬁcantly increased\
    \ ﬂight times because\nthey exploit and store the sun’s energy during the day.\
    \ This is the reason that they are preferred\nfor long-endurance operations.\n\
    2.\nRotary-wing: The rotary-wing UAVS, also called rotorcrafts or Vertical Take-Off\
    \ and Landing\n(VTOL), offer the advantages of steady ﬂying at one place while\
    \ keeping the maneuverability\nattribute. These features are useful for many different\
    \ types of missions. However, they cannot\nﬂy at very high speed or stay in the\
    \ air for a long time. They are generally the most widely used\nUAVs in all kinds\
    \ of applications, but especially in Precision Agriculture. One reason for this\n\
    is the fact that they present lower cost compared to the other types of UAVs.\
    \ In addition, this\ntype of UAVs is suitable when the monitored crops are not\
    \ very large, which is usually the case.\nA UAV of this type may be:\n•\nAn unmanned\
    \ helicopter: They include main and tail rotors such as conventional helicopters.\n\
    Overall, 4% of the works used this type.\n•\nMulti-rotor: This category includes\
    \ rotary-wing UAVs with four or more rotors (quadcopter,\nhexacopter, octocopter,\
    \ etc.). These aircraft are generally more stable in ﬂight than unmanned\nhelicopters.\
    \ Overall, 72% of the works used this type.\n3.\nBlimps: This type of UAV is lighter\
    \ than air, has high endurance, ﬂies at low speeds and is\ngenerally larger in\
    \ size compared to the other types. Their manufacturing characteristics allows\n\
    them to remain in the air even in the event of a total loss of power, while being\
    \ considered\nrelatively safe in the event of a collision. Usually, they are not\
    \ used in Precision Agriculture\napplications. In the recent works reviewed, no\
    \ application was found using this type of UAVs.\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n\
    8 of 26\n4.\nFlapping wing: These UAVs are very small and they have ﬂexible, shaped\
    \ little wings inspired by\nthe way birds and insects ﬂy. They are not often used\
    \ in Precision Agriculture as they require\nhigh energy consumption due to their\
    \ size. No work was found in the literature review using\nthis type of UAVs.\n\
    5.\nParafoil-wing. Usually aircrafts of this type have one or more propellers\
    \ at the back in order to\ncontrol the course of their ﬂight, but at the same\
    \ time for harnessing the power of the air to ﬂy\nwithout consuming much energy.\
    \ They are also capable of carrying a larger payload. They are\nnot usually exploited\
    \ for PA applications. Only 2% of the works analyzed use this type.\nIn addition\
    \ to the above classiﬁcation, UAVs can also be categorized according to their\
    \ size [121].\nHowever, the categorization used in this study is more common,\
    \ as it takes into account more factors\naffecting the performance of UAVs and\
    \ their use in Precision Agriculture.\nThe majority of the recent works in Precision\
    \ Agriculture use multi-rotor UAVs. This is mainly\ndue to the fact that in most\
    \ applications the area under consideration is not very large. For this reason,\n\
    it is not necessary to use UAVs with high speed and the ability to cover large\
    \ areas in a few ﬂights, such\nas ﬁxed-wing UAVs. Thus, rotary-wing aircraft are\
    \ preferred because of the following advantages:\n•\nEasy to operate\n•\nSlower\
    \ speeds\n•\nAbility to maneuver\n•\nRelatively low cost\nThese advantages provide\
    \ greater opportunities for collecting information from crops through\nimaging,\
    \ which is the main use of UAVs in vegetation monitoring. In cases where the monitoring\
    \ area\nis relatively large, ﬁxed-wing aircraft are preferred, which enable the\
    \ monitoring of the entire area in a\nshort time.\n3. UAV Data Acquisition\nEquipped\
    \ with specialized sensors, UAVs are becoming powerful sensing systems that\n\
    complement the IoT-based techniques. The role of the sensors is to capture images\
    \ of high-spatial and\ntemporal resolution, which can assist in monitoring many\
    \ different characteristics of the vegetation.\nA variety of different types of\
    \ sensors can be used in an agricultural UAV depending on the different\ncrop\
    \ parameters that should be monitored [9]. However, the needs for low payload\
    \ capacity and the\nutilization of small platforms pose several limitations on\
    \ the selection s of the sensor(s) to be used.\nThe main criteria that the sensors\
    \ have to meet are the low weight, the low energy consumption\nand the small size.\
    \ Of course, all of the above must be combined with the ability to capture high\n\
    resolution images.\nModern commercial on-board sensors complying with the above\
    \ restrictions that are used for PA ,\nmainly belong to the following four types:\n\
    •\nVisible light sensors (RGB)\n•\nMultispectral sensors\n•\nHyperspectral sensors\n\
    •\nThermal sensors\nIn addition to the above types of sensors, other types of\
    \ sensors can be used, such as laser\nscanners, also mentioned in the literature\
    \ as light detection and ranging (LiDAR). Laser scanners\nare a well-established\
    \ technology used extensively for environmental sciences, however they are\nmostly\
    \ used for terrestrial scanning. Airborne laser scanning has been exploited since\
    \ 1994 [125], when\ncommercial systems became available. However, they were not\
    \ widely used in the studies reviewed,\nmainly due to the increased cost compared\
    \ to other types of sensors used for data acquisition [84].\nEach sensor type\
    \ can monitor different characteristics of the vegetation, such as the color and\n\
    texture of vegetation or the geometric outline of the crops. In addition, some\
    \ sensors can measure\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n9 of 26\nthe radiation in certain\
    \ wavelengths. The data acquired by these sensors can be further processed to\n\
    monitor plant biomass, vegetation health, soil moisture and other important crop\
    \ characteristics at the\ndifferent growth stages. Figure 2 presents examples\
    \ of the main types of sensors used.\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\nFigure 2. Examples of\
    \ sensors used by UAVs for PA: (a) thermal sensor [103]; (b) RGB sensor [59];\n\
    (c) multispectral sensor [26]; and (d) hyperspectral sensor [88].\n•\nVisible\
    \ light sensors (RGB): RGB sensors are the most frequently used sensors by UAV\
    \ systems\nfor Precision Agriculture applications. They are relatively low cost\
    \ compared to the other types\nand can acquire high resolution images. In addition,\
    \ they are easy to use and operate and they\nare lightweight. In addition, the\
    \ information acquired requires simple processing. The images\ncan be acquired\
    \ in different conditions, on both sunny and cloudy days, but a speciﬁc time frame\n\
    is required based on weather conditions to avoid inadequate or excessive exposure\
    \ of the image.\nConsidering the drawbacks of these sensors, the main disadvantage\
    \ is the fact that they are\ninadequate for analyzing a lot of vegetation parameters\
    \ that require spectral information in the\nnon-visible spectrum. They are commonly\
    \ used in tandem with the other types of sensors.\n•\nBy using multispectral or\
    \ hyperspectral imaging sensors, UAVs can acquire information about\nthe vegetation’s\
    \ spectral absorption and reﬂection on several bands. Spectral information can\n\
    be signiﬁcantly helpful in assessing a lot of biological and physical characteristics\
    \ of the crops.\nFor example, unhealthy parts of the crops can be discriminated\
    \ in an image, as visible radiation\nin the red channel is absorbed by chlorophyll,\
    \ while near infrared (NIR) radiation is strongly\nreﬂected. Thus, even if it\
    \ is not yet visible in the red channel, it can be identiﬁed by the information\n\
    in the NIR channel. Spectral information can be used to calculate several vegetation\
    \ indices and\nmonitor several crop characteristics based on them.\nMultispectral\
    \ and hyperspectral sensors are frequently used, despite their higher costs. However,\
    \ a\ndrawback of these sensors arises from the fact that it is required to apply\
    \ more complex\npre-processing methods in order to extract useful information\
    \ from the captured images.\nThe pre-processing procedure of spectral images often\
    \ contains the radiometric calibration,\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n10 of 26\n\
    geometric correction, image fusion and image enhancement. The main difference\
    \ between\nmultispectral and hyperspectral sensors is the number of bands (or\
    \ channels) that each sensor\ncan capture and the width of the bands. Multispectral\
    \ sensors capture 5–12 channels while\nhyperspectral images can usually capture\
    \ hundreds or thousands bands, but in a narrower\nbandwidth. Although in the recent\
    \ works studied multispectral sensors are used a lot more\nfrequently than hyperspectral\
    \ because of their lower cost, hyperspectral technology seems to have\na lot of\
    \ potential and is considered as the future trend for crop phenotyping research\
    \ [9].\n•\nThermal infrared sensors capture information about the temperature\
    \ of the objects and generate\nimages displaying them based on this information\
    \ and not their visible properties. Thermal\ncameras use infrared sensors and\
    \ an optical lens to receive infrared energy. All objects warmer\nthan absolute\
    \ zero (−273 ◦C/−459 ◦F) emit infrared radiation at speciﬁc wavelengths (LWIR\
    \ and\nMWIR bands) in an amount proportional to their temperature. Hence, thermal\
    \ cameras focus\nand detect the radiation in these wavelengths and usually translate\
    \ it into a grayscale image for\nthe heat representation. Many thermal imaging\
    \ sensors can also generate colored images. These\nimages often show warmer objects\
    \ as yellow and cooler objects as blue. This type of sensors\nis used for very\
    \ speciﬁc applications (e.g., irrigation management). As a result, they are not\n\
    frequently used in PA applications of UAV systems that focus on monitoring other\
    \ characteristics\nof the crops.\nIn the image acquisition by UAVs, it is typical\
    \ to acquire several overlapping images of the\ncrops. In the most cases they\
    \ capture both front and side overlapping images. This is desired as the\noverlapping\
    \ images can be used for the construction of 3D models and/or orthophotos of the\
    \ crops, as\nthe next section discusses. The rate of the overlap depends on the\
    \ type of the application. The front\noverlap usually ranges 60–95% while the\
    \ side overlap ranges 40–95% to generate three-dimensional\nmodels and 25–40%\
    \ for other uses.\nIn addition, the altitude of the UAV ﬂights varies according\
    \ to the application and spatial accuracy\nof the information we want to collect.\
    \ The distance between the target (crop) to be visualized and the\nUAV plays an\
    \ important role in determining the detail of the information acquired. This is\
    \ something\nthat depends on both the sensors and the resolution they offer. In\
    \ the majority of cases, depending on\nthe purpose of the application, the spatial\
    \ resolution of the photographs is between 0.5 cm/pixel and\n10 cm/pixel.\nQuite\
    \ often, RGB sensors are modiﬁed to acquire information about the radiation in\
    \ other bands\ntoo, usually the Near Infrared (NIR) or the Red Edge (RE) band.\
    \ This approach is observed when\nthe stakeholders want to avoid the higher costs\
    \ of buying multispectral cameras. This is achieved by\nreplacing one of the original\
    \ optical ﬁlters with one that enables the perception of near-infrared channel,\n\
    resulting often in a hybrid (e.g., NIR-RGB) sensor. The visible channel that is\
    \ no longer captured by\nthe modiﬁed RGB sensor is often captured by using another\
    \ embedded RGB sensor. The use of both\nmultispectral and visible sensors was\
    \ observed in many cases [22,23,27,31,33,49,50,55,56,61,65,69,72,\n87,103,107,113,117].\n\
    4. UAS Data Processing\nThis section focuses on the data processing techniques\
    \ utilized to analyze the UAV imagery. To be\nmore precise, we discuss the different\
    \ ways the information UAVs capture can be exploited to study\ndifferent vegetation\
    \ features. The most common features that can be monitored with UAV-based\nremote\
    \ sensing for Precision Agriculture are presented in Table 1:\nInformation 2019,\
    \ 10, 349\n11 of 26\nTable 1. Crop features that can be monitored with UAVs.\n\
    Crop Features\nVegetation\nbiomass [22,103]\nnitrogen status [22,99,103,110]\n\

    \ shape of different elements and plants\nvegetation indices [54–56]\nSoil\nmoisture\
    \ content [109,112]\ntemperature [66,69]\nelectrical conductivity [66]\nWith the\
    \ use of specialized sensors, UAVs can acquire information for various features\
    \ of the\ncultivated ﬁeld. However, as mentioned above, there is still no standardized\
    \ workﬂow or well\nestablished techniques to follow for analyzing and visualizing\
    \ the information acquired. The most\ncommonly used image processing methods y\
    \ to analyze UAV imagery for Precision Agriculture\npurposes are the following:\n\
    •\nPhotogrammetry techniques: Photogrammetry regards the accurate reconstruction\
    \ of a scene or\nan object from several overlapping pictures. Photogrammetric\
    \ techniques can process the 2D data\nand establish the geometric relationships\
    \ between the different images and the object(s), obtaining\n3D models. To construct\
    \ the 3D models, photogrammetry requires at least two overlapping\nimages of the\
    \ same scene and/or object(s), captured from different points of view. These kind\
    \ of\ntechniques can be used for extracting three-dimensional digital surface\
    \ or terrain models [37,40,43]\nand/or orthophotos [50,55]. UAV low-altitude data\
    \ acquisition enables the construction of 3D\nmodels with a much higher spatial\
    \ resolution compared to other remote sensing technologies\n(such as satellites).\
    \ However, the collection of many images is required to have information for\n\
    the entire ﬁeld under study. Thus, in most cases, it is necessary to collect many\
    \ overlapping\nimages to construct Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the crops\
    \ and/or create orthophotos\n(also referred to as orthomosaics). The 3D models\
    \ and the orthophotos include information about\nthe 3D characteristics of the\
    \ crops based on the structure of the vegetation (e.g., the vegetation\nheight,\
    \ the canopy, the density, etc.) and can be very useful for applications that\
    \ can exploit only\nRGB imagery. The works reviewed showed that photogrammetric\
    \ techniques are very commonly\nused in all types of applications as they are\
    \ also required to create vegetation indices maps.\nIn addition, the 3D information\
    \ they include is very important and is often used in tandem with\nother techniques.\n\
    •\nMachine learning methods: Machine Learning (ML) has been used to process the\
    \ data acquired,\nfor prediction and/or identiﬁcation purposes, with great results\
    \ in many domains, such as medical\nsystems [126,127], marketing [128], biology\
    \ [129], etc. Machine learning techniques are often\nbeen applied in Precision\
    \ Agriculture to exploit the information from the large amount of data\nacquired\
    \ by the UAVs. ML is able to estimate some parameters regarding the crop growth\
    \ rate,\ndetect diseases or even to identify/discriminate objects in the images.\
    \ Machine learning usage\nhas increased a lot recently due to the fast advancements\
    \ taking place especially in the deep\nlearning ﬁeld.\n•\nVegetation Indices calculation:\
    \ Vegetation Indices (VIs) are one of the most popular products\nof remote sensing\
    \ applications for Precision Agriculture.\nThey use different mathematical\ncombinations/transformations\
    \ of at least two spectral bands of the electromagnetic spectrum,\ndesigned to\
    \ maximize the contribution of the vegetation characteristics while minimizing\
    \ the\nexternal confounding factors. They can deliver reliable spatial and temporal\
    \ information about the\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n12 of 26\nagricultural crops\
    \ monitored. In most cases, many VIs are extracted and used to draw conclusions.\n\
    They can be calculated based on information of either each photograph individually\
    \ or after the\nproduction of orthophotos depicting the whole crop. Calculating\
    \ vegetation indices may serve\nin the identiﬁcation of useful crop characteristics,\
    \ such as biological and physical parameters of\nthe vegetation.\nSince the processing\
    \ of data may be time consuming, several software tools and techniques have\n\
    been developed to enable faster data processing. The most commonly adopted software\
    \ solutions in\nthe works reviewed to support and accelerate the data analysis\
    \ procedure are summarized in Table 2.\nIn addition to the software tools referenced\
    \ in the table, there are several other promising software\ntools that can assist\
    \ in the data analysis process, such as Erdas Imagine [130], eCognition [131],\
    \ and\nPixelWrench 2 [132].\nTable 2. Most common software tools used in the literature\
    \ for image processing.\nSoftware Tool\nDescription\nAdobe Photoshop [21,100]\n\

    \ [22,36,37]\nExploited for the construction of 3D models and orthomosaics. It\
    \ also\nallows the calculation of vegetation indices\nQGIS [23,55]\nUsually exploited\
    \ for the calculation of the vegetation indices from\nmultispectral data\nMATLAB\
    \ [35,100]\nApplied mainly for the calculation of vegetation indices. It can also\
    \ be\nexploited for other image processing methods\nPix4D [29,35,55]\nThe most\
    \ commonly used tool. It can be used for calculating VIs and/or\nconstructing\
    \ of 3D models and orthomosaics\nIn the following subsections, we provide the\
    \ details of the three most commonly used data\nprocessing techniques to analyze\
    \ data acquired from UAV ﬂights in the agricultural domain.\n4.1. Photogrammetric\
    \ Techniques\nPhotogrammetric techniques are mainly be applied for the construction\
    \ of orthomosaics and/or\nDigital Elevation Models (DEMs) in order to exploit\
    \ the 3D information regarding the vegetation.\nAs mentioned above, this can be\
    \ done by acquiring many overlapping images of the agricultural crops\nmonitored.\
    \ The advancements in computer vision and photogrammetric techniques have lead\
    \ to many\ndifferent techniques and algorithms that are able to match large numbers\
    \ of overlapping images and\ndetect common objects and scenes in them. The images\
    \ are processed by applying aerial triangulation\nand adjusting camera orientation.\
    \ Computer vision methods are used for matching the overlapping\nimages and the\
    \ common characteristics. To achieve object tracking as well as to identify the\
    \ scale and\nthe orientation of a particular image; in some cases, Ground Control\
    \ Points (GCPs) are being used.\nGCPs distributed in the cultivated ﬁeld can be\
    \ identiﬁed within the overlapping images: (a) to link the\nimages; and (b) to\
    \ identify the coordinates of each image and its slope. However, recent advancements\n\
    have made this redundant, as many techniques can be used without GCPs, with similar\
    \ precision.\nThe construction of the 3D Digital Elevation Models can provide\
    \ to the producer information\nabout the altitude of the earth surface, the natural\
    \ and artiﬁcial objects/structures on the surface, the\ndensity of the vegetation,\
    \ and their growth, among others. There are two types of DEMs used:\n•\nThe Digital\
    \ Terrain Model (DTM) represents the altitude of the surface of the Earth, i.e.,\
    \ of the\nterrain. These models do not take into account either artiﬁcial or natural\
    \ (e.g., trees, vegetation,\nbuildings) objects that exist in the ﬁeld. DTMs just\
    \ present the elevation of the bare Earth. Figure 3\nshows a Digital Terrain Model\
    \ from Ronchetti et al. [79].\n•\nThe Digital Surface Model (DSM) represents the\
    \ altitude of the surface that is ﬁrst encountered by\nthe remote sensing system\
    \ (i.e., when the aerial image captures the top of a building, tree, the\nInformation\
    \ 2019, 10, 349\n13 of 26\nvegetation etc.). Hence, the elevation model generated\
    \ includes the elevation of the bare Earth\nalong with artiﬁcial and natural objects\
    \ that may exist in the ﬁeld.\nThe DEMS constructed can be exploited either for\
    \ the extraction of 3D information directly\nor to construct orthomosaics of the\
    \ crops. An orthoimage, orthomosaic or orthophoto is an aerial\nphotograph that\
    \ is orthorectiﬁed (i.e., geometrically corrected). Thus, the scale of the constructed\n\
    image is uniform. As a result, the ﬁnal orthophoto has the same lack of distortion\
    \ as a map. In contrast\nwith a simple aerial image of a ﬁeld, an orthophoto can\
    \ be used to measure true distances as it contains\nthe 3D characteristics of\
    \ the crops.\nThe use of photogrammetry techniques have the following procedure:\
    \ create point cloud\nrepresentations of the 3D surface and either combine all\
    \ objects into a single Digital Elevation Model\nor use the DEMs to generate an\
    \ orthophoto. The most commonly used set of algorithms for this\npurpose is Structure\
    \ from Motion (SfM) [133]. The main advantage of SfM is that it does not require\n\
    any information regarding the camera parameters or the environmental settings.\n\
    (a)\n(b)\nFigure 3. (a) A Digital Terrain Model [79]; and (b) a Digital Surface\
    \ Model [109].\nPhotogrammetric techniques are commonly used in all types of applications\
    \ as they are also\nrequired for constructing the vegetation indices maps. Photogrammetric\
    \ techniques are used in the\nmajority of recent works (93%) to exploit and extract\
    \ information regarding the 3D characteristics of\nthe crops. However, photogrammetric\
    \ techniques are in most cases used to compliment other types of\ndata processing\
    \ methods.\n4.2. Using Machine Learning\nMachine Learning (ML) and Data Mining\
    \ methods are widely used in PA to exploit the\ninformation acquired by the UAVs.\
    \ Taking into account the large amounts of data collected from\nagricultural ﬁelds,\
    \ machine learning can be applied to enhance the performance of UAV-based systems\n\
    for PA, by extracting knowledge for several parameters of the vegetation. ML is\
    \ used in many cases\nand for different purposes. Both unsupervised and supervised\
    \ learning techniques are being exploited,\nvia clustering, classiﬁcation and\
    \ regression methods.\nRegression methods are widely used in UAV applications\
    \ for PA for a variety of purposes.\nRegression has been used to estimate spectral\
    \ vegetation indices by analyzing data acquired from RGB\nimages [35], presenting\
    \ generally good results. Additionally, regression has been used to examine the\n\
    correlation of some vegetation indices with vegetation features such as nitrogen\
    \ [22,38,99], leaf are\nindex [36,103], and biomass [22,36,103]. For this purpose,\
    \ both linear (simple and multiple) regression\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n14\
    \ of 26\nand nonlinear regression methods have been used. In a comparison of different\
    \ regression algorithms,\nfor estimating leaf nitrogen content, Random Forests\
    \ presents the best results among 14 algorithms,\nwith the coefﬁcient of determination\
    \ (R2) being up to 0.79 [38]. Regression methods are also used\nto predict crop\
    \ water status, by using information derived from RGB, multispectral and thermal\n\
    sensors [64,92,104]. In this context, Artiﬁcial Neural Networks present generally\
    \ good results (R2 up\nto 0.87 by using and information from some spectral bands).\n\
    Classiﬁcation methods are also very commonly used for weed mapping [18,33,44,73,106,111]\
    \ and\ndisease detection [46,77,97]. The most popular and precise classiﬁcation\
    \ techniques are the Artiﬁcial\nNeural Networks (ANNs) family [18,44,73,104] and\
    \ the Random Forest algorithm [22,38,49]. These\nalgorithms directly use the RGB\
    \ colors, the intensity, spectral information or other features derived\nfrom\
    \ the image acquired. In some cases, data about the neighborhood of each pixel\
    \ are also considered.\nApart from the above data, classiﬁcation algorithms can\
    \ also use vegetation indices as features in\nthe model to achieve higher accuracy.\
    \ In general, ANNs present higher accuracy, compared to other\nclassiﬁcation algorithms,\
    \ that reaches up to 99% for weed mapping in some cases [98]. The accuracy\nof\
    \ the method depends on the type of the crops monitored [73] as expected. Convolutional\
    \ Neural\nNetworks (CNNs), is among the most used family of algorithms. CNNs belong\
    \ to deep learning\nalgorithms that have been proved to be very effective in object\
    \ detection in large datasets.\nThe use of Deep Learning (DL) in Precision Agriculture\
    \ applications is a recent, modern and\npromising technique, having increasing\
    \ popularity. Deep learning techniques extend typical ML by\nadding more complexity\
    \ into the derived models. DL techniques transform the data using various\nfunctions\
    \ that allow data representation in a hierarchical way, through several levels\
    \ of abstraction.\nAdvancements and applications of Deep Learning into other domains\
    \ indicate its large potential.\nAs indicated in [16,134], the use of Machine\
    \ Learning and more particular Deep Learning will be even\nmore widespread in\
    \ the next years.\nA very common application of Machine Learning methods in PA\
    \ is Object Based Image Analysis\n(OBIA). The purpose of OBIA is to discriminate\
    \ objects within agricultural images obtained from\nUAVs [32,43].\nIn contrast\
    \ to traditional pixel-based image classiﬁcation, which classiﬁes each\npixel,\
    \ OBIA groups small pixels together into vector objects. With the higher spatial\
    \ resolution\nof UAV imagery, pixel-based classiﬁcations have become much less\
    \ effective.\nThat is due to\nthe fact that the relationship between the pixel\
    \ size and the object size has changed signiﬁcantly.\nTherefore, object-oriented\
    \ classiﬁcation methods are increasing in popularity. They use segmentation\n\
    methods to divide the image pixels into homogeneous segments/groups. Then, these\
    \ segments/objects\nare arranged into classes based on their geometric, spectral,\
    \ textural and other characteristics.\nOBIA is usually composed of two main steps:\n\
    1.\nImage segmentation\n2.\nFeature extraction and classiﬁcation\nThese methods\
    \ are exploited to recognize and detect weeds or discriminate different species\
    \ in\nthe ﬁeld. A detailed review of algorithms and challenges for OBIA, from\
    \ a remote sensing perspective,\nwas reported by Hossain and Chen [135].\n4.3.\
    \ Vegetation Indices\nVegetation Indices (VIs) have been widely used in remote\
    \ sensing applications for Precision\nAgriculture. They are considered to be very\
    \ effective for monitoring the growth and health of crops\nin qualitative and\
    \ quantitative vegetation analysis [25,29,30]. Vegetation Indices are based on\
    \ the\nabsorption of electromagnetic radiation by the vegetation.\nThey are mathematical\
    \ transformations of the absorption and scattering in different bands of\nthe\
    \ electromagnetic spectrum. The reﬂectance in several bands is affected by parameters\
    \ such as\nvegetation biochemical and physical properties, environmental effects,\
    \ soil background properties,\nmoisture content, etc. The understanding of the\
    \ spectral behavior of the vegetation is fundamental\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n\
    15 of 26\nto remote sensing applications to monitor various vegetation features\
    \ (e.g., biomass [22], nitrogen\nstatus [19,22], vegetation health [46], etc.)\
    \ It has been shown that certain VIs are signiﬁcantly related\nwith different\
    \ parameters of the vegetation.\nSimple Vegetation Indices that can combine RGB\
    \ information and some spectral bands such as\nNIR and RE have signiﬁcantly improved\
    \ the ability to detect green and healthy vegetation. Several VIs\nhave been developed,\
    \ as different environments have their own complex characteristics, which needs\n\
    to be taken into account when using a Vegetation Index. Thus, each VI has its\
    \ own speciﬁc combination\nof the reﬂectance in different bands, in order to detect\
    \ vegetation. Hence, its VI is suitable for speciﬁc\nuses. The main concept is\
    \ to combine the reﬂections of different bands to decrease the “noise” from\n\
    external factors (e.g., sensors calibration, lighting, atmosphere, soil properties,\
    \ etc.). For example, as\nmentioned in the previous section, visible radiation\
    \ to the red is absorbed by the chlorophyll while the\nradiation in the NIR band\
    \ is strongly reﬂected. In this way, vegetation can be discriminated by the soil\n\
    in an image. In way, unhealthy vegetation can also be detected.\nVegetation Indices\
    \ that are based on the radiation in the Red and NIR channels, such as the RVI\n\
    or the NDVI index, are designed to increase the contrast between the vegetation\
    \ and the soil. The\nrelationship between the reﬂections of the two zones allows\
    \ the elimination of disturbances by factors\nthat affect the radiation of each\
    \ zone in the same way.\nThe effort to model the biophysical parameters of vegetation\
    \ has led to the creation of several\ndifferent vegetation indices [136–139].\
    \ The vegetation indices can be divided into two main categories:\n1.\nVegetation\
    \ Indices based on multispectral or hyperspectral data. Most of the developed\
    \ Vegetation\nIndices use multispectral and/or hyperspectral information that\
    \ can combine several bands.\n2.\nVegetation Indices based on information from\
    \ the visible spectrum. Several VIs in the visible\nspectrum have been developed\
    \ and are widely used due to the high cost of multispectral and\nhyperspectral\
    \ sensors.\nA list of the most used vegetation indices is presented in Table 3.\
    \ For the interpretation of\nthe following formulas, the following abbreviations\
    \ represent the reﬂection in the respective color\nor spectrum:\n•\nR: Red (620–670\
    \ nm)\n•\nG: Green (500–560 nm)\n•\nB: Blue (430–500 nm)\n•\nNIR: Near Infrared\
    \ (720–1500 nm)\n•\nRE: Red Edge (670–720 nm)\nConcerning the multispectral vegetation\
    \ indices, one of the ﬁrst well-known indices was Ratio\nVegetation Index (RVI).\
    \ This index enhances the contrast among vegetation and soil. However, it is\n\
    sensitive to the optical properties of ground. The best known and most widely\
    \ used vegetation index\nis the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI),\
    \ which is the evolution of RVI and is calculated\nby the visible and near infrared\
    \ light reﬂected from the vegetation. Unhealthy or sparse vegetation\nreﬂects\
    \ more visible light and less near infrared light, making it easy to monitor the\
    \ growth and health\nof many agricultural crops. It is based on absorption in\
    \ Red due to chlorophyll and reﬂectance in NIR.\nRVI and NDVI are calculated as\
    \ shown in Table 3.\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n16 of 26\nTable 3. Most used vegetation\
    \ indices.\nVegetation Index\nAbbreviation\nFormula\nVegetation Indices derived\

    Several other VIs have been developed based on NDVI. NDRE uses the method of NDVI\
    \ to\nnormalize the ratio of NIR radiation with Red Edge (RE) radiation. The same\
    \ applies for GNDVI with\nNIR and Green (G) bands.\nFigure 4 shows examples of\
    \ crop maps constructed from information of spectral VIs (NDVI and\nNDRE) in different\
    \ growth stages. We can see that the difference in the maps while the vegetation\n\
    grows is quite clear.\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 4.\nVegetation indices maps of crops in\
    \ different growth stages [29]:\n(a) NDVI maps;\nand (b) NDRE maps\nFocusing on\
    \ the VIs extracted from RGB images, Excess Greenness Index (ExG) and Normalized\n\
    Difference Index (NDI) are the most used indices. ExG is based on the assumption\
    \ that plants display\na clear high degree of greenness, and soil is the only\
    \ background element. Thus, it is calculated\nby doubling the radiation in the\
    \ Green channel minus the radiation in Red and Blue channels.\nNDI was proposed\
    \ to separate plants from soil and residue background images, using only green\
    \ and\nred channels.\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n17 of 26\nAlthough the VIs that\
    \ use information in the visible light can be useful for crop monitoring,\nthey\
    \ cannot provide information for several parameters of the vegetation and also\
    \ they are sensitive\nto working environment properties such as the atmosphere,\
    \ lighting, etc. Hyperspectral remote\nsensing is expected to be the future trend\
    \ in crop monitoring and this is mainly because it allows the\ndevelopment of\
    \ new bands combination of vegetation indices. In many cases, it has been proved\
    \ that\nhyperspectral vegetation indices are less sensitive to saturation, change\
    \ in viewing/lighting geometry,\nand atmospheric contamination. The combination\
    \ of new bands can eliminate noise from the working\nenvironment and in the same\
    \ time exploit the information of certain bands and extract information for\n\
    more biophysical features of the vegetation.\n5. Limitations in the Use of UAVs\
    \ for Precision Agriculture\nAlthough the use of UAVs for PA is expanding there\
    \ are several limitations that prevent their\nwider use. The absence of a standardized\
    \ workﬂow leads to the adoption of ad-hoc procedures for\ndeploying PA applications,\
    \ a fact that discourages the relevant stakeholders. In addition, as PA requires\n\
    data-intensive procedures for the exploitation of the images acquired, skilled\
    \ and expert personnel\nis usually needed. This means that an average farmer may\
    \ need training or even been forced to hire\nexperts to assist with the image\
    \ processing, which may be costly. This fact may prohibit the adoption\nof UAV\
    \ technologies from individual farmers with only a few and small agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds.\nThe high investment cost to purchase the Unmanned Aerial System is another\
    \ prohibitive factor.\nProducers with larger cultivated areas and higher proﬁt\
    \ rates are able to use more sophisticated,\nhigh-cost systems, though this is\
    \ not the case for the majority of the ﬁelds in Europe. There were\n10.5 million\
    \ agricultural holdings in the EU in 2016, two-thirds of which were less than\
    \ 5 hectares in\nsize, as shown in the Eurostat survey [140].\nAnother drawback\
    \ stems from UAV technology limitations. Most commercial UAVs have a short\nﬂight\
    \ time, ranging from 20 min to 1 h, covering a very restricted area at every ﬂight.\
    \ UAVs that can\noffer longer ﬂight time are relatively expensive. In addition,\
    \ the effective use of UAVs is prone to\nclimatic conditions. For example, on\
    \ a very windy or rainy day, the ﬂight should be postponed.\nAs the use of UAVs\
    \ for agriculture purposes is considered to be commercial, UAV ﬂights should\n\
    also adhere to the related legislation and national rules. However, the EU regulations\
    \ [141,142] for the\nuse of UAVs will replace national rules from July 2020. In\
    \ practice, these regulations report that, once\nan UAV pilot has received the\
    \ appropriate authorization, he/she will be allowed to freely use UAVs in\nthe\
    \ EU. The EU legislation will cover all types of possible UAVs operations, fostering\
    \ the development\nof innovative applications (e.g., for PA).\nThe EU regulations\
    \ consider three categories of operations:\n1.\nOpen category: Operations in this\
    \ category do not require authorization or pilot license.\nThis category is limited\
    \ to operations: in visual line of sight (VLOS), up to 120 m ﬂight height and\n\
    performed with UAVs compliant with some technical requirements deﬁned.\n2.\nSpeciﬁc\
    \ category: This is the second level of operations, which covers operations that\
    \ are not\ncompliant to the restrictions of the open category and are considered\
    \ “medium risk” operations.\nOperators must perform a risk assessment (using a\
    \ standardized method) and deﬁne mitigation\nmeasures. Operations involving UAVs\
    \ of more than 25 kg or not operated in VLOS will typically\nfall under this category.\
    \ The technical requirements for this category depend on the speciﬁc\nauthorized\
    \ operation.\n3.\nCertiﬁed category: This category is considered high risk and\
    \ includes operations involving large\ndrones in controlled air-spaces. Rules\
    \ applicable to this category will be the same as for manned\naviation. This category\
    \ does not concern the use of UAVs for Precision Agriculture.\nTaking into account\
    \ the rapid developments in UAV technology and the sensors use in PA,\nthe cost\
    \ of the Unmanned Aerial Systems will be reduced in the near future. Practical\
    \ limitations,\nsuch as the short ﬂight time, are also expected to be solved by\
    \ the advancements in technology.\nInformation 2019, 10, 349\n18 of 26\nThese\
    \ improvements will ensure that farmers can reap more from the use of UAVs for\
    \ remote sensing\nin Precision Agriculture.\n6. Discussion and Conclusions\nIn\
    \ this work, we review 100 recent applications of UAVs for Precision Agriculture.\
    \ We present the\nmost frequent applications, the UAV types used and the Unmanned\
    \ Aerial systems architecture for\nPA. Then, we focus on the most used sensors\
    \ for monitoring the crops and the processing methods\nexploiting UAV imagery.\
    \ We show that UAVs can have several applications, however monitoring crop\ngrowth\
    \ is the one that stands out. The following three main processing techniques stand\
    \ out in the\nliterature for exploiting the information acquired:\n1.\nPhotogrammetry\
    \ techniques are used to construct Orthophotos or DEMs from the overlapping\n\
    images acquired. They are used in most of the applications to create vegetation\
    \ maps considering\nseveral characteristics; however, they are also used standalone\
    \ mainly when only RGB sensors\nare available, to exploit the 3D characteristics\
    \ of the vegetation.\n2.\nMachine Learning methods can be used to monitor several\
    \ different characteristics of the crops.\nThey can exploit RGB and/or multispectral/hyperspectral\
    \ images. A very frequent technique\nexploited in the literature is the Object\
    \ Based Image Analysis.\n3.\nVegetation Indices use combinations of the reﬂection\
    \ of several bands obtained by RGB or spectral\nsensors. They are proved to be\
    \ most effective when multispectral or hyperspectral information is\nused. They\
    \ have been used in many recent studies. They have been proved to be very effective\
    \ in\nmonitoring various parameters of the crops, by using different combinations\
    \ of spectral bands.\nIn Figure 5, we present some statistics for the use of sensors\
    \ and processing methods for the\ndifferent applications.\nFigure 5. The use of\
    \ sensors and processing techniques in the different UAVs applications.\nWe can\
    \ observe that there is no standardized workﬂow in most cases and different techniques\n\
    are used to exploit UAV-acquired information for the same type of application.\
    \ For example, looking\nat the sensors and techniques used for monitoring the\
    \ health of the crops, we can see that it is\nrelatively premature. Disease detection\
    \ is mainly applied through temporal analysis of the vegetation’s\ngrowth. However,\
    \ multispectral and hyperspectral sensors seem to have great potential in this\n\
    context. An approach using multispectral sensing technologies could reliably deliver\
    \ Vegetation\nIndices, discriminating healthy and unhealthy portions of the vegetation.\
    \ In such an approach, the\nfarmer could locate the “weak” corps ﬁeld areas and\
    \ take timely decisions to save the parts of the crop\nproduction that seem unhealthy.\n\
    On the contrary, considering weed mapping, we can see that some studies use machine\
    \ learning\ntechniques to detect weeds, mainly OBIA, while others use the 3D characteristics\
    \ of the crops though\nDEMs, VIs or other processing methods. Weed detection with\
    \ UAVs based on object-based image\nanalysis seems to be at an advanced stage\
    \ and can be used for site-speciﬁc weed management. We can\nsee that machine learning\
    \ techniques are exploited in 62.50% of the applications that used RGB sensors\n\
    and in all the applications with multispectral sensors.\nInformation 2019, 10,\
    \ 349\n19 of 26\nFocusing on UAV-based growth monitoring, many different methods\
    \ are really promising but it\nseems that their integration in a standardized\
    \ workﬂow can improve its applicability and efﬁciency.\nGrowth monitoring and\
    \ yield prediction is most commonly performed with the use of RGB (30%)\nand multispectral\
    \ (59%) sensors. The information acquired is exploited for estimating the density\
    \ of\nproduction and the biomass. The ﬁndings of this review appoint that combining\
    \ information coming\nfrom Vegetation Indices with the 3D characteristics of the\
    \ crops coming from RGB images can improve\nthe accuracy of growth and yield estimation\
    \ methods.\nIn contrast with the above, the use of UAV systems for irrigation\
    \ management is closer to\na standard workﬂow, which involves the use of thermal\
    \ and/or multispectral sensors to monitor the\nneeds of water of different parts\
    \ of the crops. Equipped with thermal sensors, the Unmanned Aerial\nVehicles are\
    \ able to detect possible deﬁciencies in the irrigation of different sites. This\
    \ information\ncan be processed through photogrammetry techniques into a single\
    \ high-resolution vegetation map,\nhighlighting the stressed areas. A map in this\
    \ context can be constructed though the use of some VIs\nwhen multispectral imagery\
    \ is used. Thus, a map such as this can support the producers to apply\nVariable\
    \ Rate Irrigation (VRI) applications.\nFunding: This research was co-funded by\

  title: A Review on UAV-Based Applications for Precision Agriculture
  verbatim_quote1: '"Vegetation Indices (VIs) are one of the most popular products
    of remote sensing applications for Precision Agriculture.

    They use different mathematical combinations/transformations of at least two spectral
    bands of the electromagnetic spectrum, designed to maximize the contribution of
    the vegetation characteristics while minimizing the external confounding factors.
    They can deliver reliable spatial and temporal information about the agricultural
    crops monitored. In most cases, many VIs are extracted and used to draw conclusions.
    They can be calculated based on information of either each photograph individually
    or after the production of orthophotos depicting the whole crop. Calculating vegetation
    indices may servein the identification of useful crop characteristics, such as
    biological and physical parameters of the vegetation."'
  verbatim_quote2: '"Photogrammetric techniques are mainly be applied for the construction
    of orthomosaics and/or Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) in order to exploit the
    3D information regarding the vegetation.

    As mentioned above, this can be done by acquiring many overlapping images of the
    agricultural crops monitored. The advancements in computer vision and photogrammetric
    techniques have lead to many different techniques and algorithms that are able
    to match large numbers of overlapping images and detect common objects and scenes
    in them."'

    SHARE Abstract Abstract: Efficient water resource management is one of the most
    important policy issues facing agriculture in Hawaii in the years ahead. Soil
    water sensors, multisensor capacitance probes (MCP), have been successfully used
    for different water management projects. These MCPs monitor water content at multiple
    depths and at various locations in real-time. The objectives of this study were
    to determine the effect of water content on field soil bulk density of Wahiawa
    silty clay tropical soil; measure field saturated hydraulic conductivity of this
    tropical soil: calibrate MCP system for this soil: and monitor and evaluate real-time
    soil water content variations under a tomato crop using the calibrated MCP system.
    Sensor calibration was conducted under laboratory conditions. Soil bulk density
    at different water contents and saturated hydraulic conductivity were measured
    on the field. Bulk density increased with increasing water content: there was
    a 30 percent bulk density increase as a result of 0.25 cm3 cm-3 water content
    variation. Compared with the manufacturer''s calibration, site specific laboratory
    calibration of MCP gave a more accurate determination of soil water. Field determined
    saturated hydraulic conductivity was higher than laboratory determined values
    reported in the literature for the same soil type. Real-time soil water content
    monitoring within the root zone showed substantial variations due to water input
    (irrigation and rainfall) and water output (evapotranspiration and deep percolations).
    However, water content variations were much further reduced in the soil layer
    below the root zone. References Citing Literature Volume42, Issue6 December 2006

  analysis:
  - The results obtained in the agronomic trials showed that the gravimetric method
    was more efficient in terms of yield followed by the method based on accumulated
    radiation with similar results to the method based on volumetric water content.
    A gravimetric control system was developed to achieve a more affordable commercial
    prototype.
  - 'All the acquired information was sent through Modbus RS-485 RTU with only four
    wires. If the installation had more than one control zone, it was possible to
    work with a parallel connection by means of the Modbus-RTU protocol, which guaranteed
    the scalability of the equipment and made it possible to increase the number of
    control zones in an installation at a reduced cost.

    Since the control panel was in the service area and the SDB in the greenhouse,
    to simplify sensor calibration, the option of using a mobile application via Bluetooth
    connection was offered, which could also be used to update the software if necessary.'
  - Programming was carried out in the Codesys environment using function blocks and
    variable structures to create scalable equipment. The system was able to be adapted
    to the needs of the individual installation as the modular structure of the programming
    made it easy to expand the software from one control zone to as many as necessary
    and the intuitive and visual Ladder language was chosen for programming.

    \ (F.J.O.)\nAbstract: Due to the edaphoclimatic conditions in southeast Spain,\
    \ which are expected to worsen\ndue to climate change, more efﬁcient ways of using\
    \ water must be found to maintain sustainable\nagriculture. Due to the current\
    \ high price of irrigation control systems in southern Europe, 60–80% of\nsoilless\
    \ crops are still irrigated, based on the experience of the grower or advisor.\
    \ The hypothesis\nof this work is that the development of a low-cost, high-performance\
    \ control system will allow\nsmall farmers to improve the efﬁciency of water use\
    \ by obtaining better control of soilless crops.\nThe objective of the present\
    \ study was to design and develop a cost-effective control system for the\noptimization\
    \ of soilless crop irrigation after evaluating the three most commonly used irrigation\n\
    control systems to determine the most efﬁcient. Based on the agronomic results\
    \ comparing these\nmethods, a prototype of a commercial smart gravimetric tray\
    \ was developed. The device records the\nirrigation and drainage volumes and drainage\
    \ pH and EC. It also offers the possibility of determining\nthe temperature, EC,\
    \ and humidity of the substrate. This new design is scalable thanks to the use\
    \ of\nan implemented data acquisition system called SDB and the development of\
    \ software in the Codesys\nprogramming environment based on function blocks and\
    \ variable structures. The reduced wiring\nachieved by the Modbus-RTU communication\
    \ protocols means the system is cost-effective even with\nmultiple control zones.\
    \ It is also compatible with any type of fertigation controller through external\n\
    activation. Its design and features solve the problems in similar systems available\
    \ on the market at an\naffordable cost. The idea is to allow farmers to increase\
    \ their productivity without having to make a\nlarge outlay. The impact of this\
    \ work will make it possible for small-scale farmers to have access to\naffordable,\
    \ state-of-the-art technology for soilless irrigation management leading to a\
    \ considerable\nimprovement in productivity.\nKeywords: soilless cultivation;\

    \ (FAO, Rome, Italy) estimates the world\npopulation to be 9.6 billion by 2050\
    \ [1]. The sustainability of irrigated agriculture in the\nsemi-arid Mediterranean\
    \ region is threatened by the overexploitation of natural resources\nand changes\
    \ in the use of agricultural land. Agriculture is the dominant water consumer\
    \ in\nthe region, accounting for 81% of the total water consumed, and is particularly\
    \ vulnerable\nto climate conditions due to its dependence for most of the year\
    \ on a plentiful supply\nof good-quality water [2]. Climate change is expected\
    \ to have a major impact on water\navailability and supply, infrastructures, and\
    \ farmers’ incomes; it also leads to reduced\nSensors 2023, 23, 3177. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23063177\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2023, 23, 3177\n2 of 25\nproduction\
    \ and increased food insecurity, with social and economic consequences involved,\n\
    such as higher levels of poverty and migration [3].\nPopulation growth, urban\
    \ development, and industrial progress will be difﬁcult to\nsustain without proper\
    \ support for agriculture, which consumes most of the world’s\navailable water\
    \ resources [4]. For example, in Europe [4], the United States [5], India [6],\n\
    Ethiopia, and South Africa [7], agriculture accounts for about 60% of the total\
    \ social\nwater consumption, more than 90% in some regions. Water-saving technologies\
    \ (WST) in\nagriculture, developed through technological development applied to\
    \ the management of\navailable water resources, are encouraged in many areas [8].\
    \ Although improved irrigation\nand water-saving practices have been adopted by\
    \ some growers, they have not been widely\nadopted since the growers do not beneﬁt\
    \ directly from saving water, and these systems\nare expensive. Studies show that\
    \ low adoption rates are an important factor in restricting\nthe effectiveness\
    \ of WST [9]. Increasing farmers’ WST adoption rates undoubtedly has\na positive\
    \ impact on increasing yields and income [10]. Saving water resources is also\n\
    conducive to improving the ecological environment and maintaining sustainable\
    \ economic\nand social development [4]. Mediterranean countries have been identiﬁed\
    \ globally as\nclimate change “hot spots” in which heat waves are expected to\
    \ increase by 200 to 500%\ndue to greenhouse gas emissions [11]. Indeed, irrigation\
    \ demands are relatively high,\nespecially in arid and semi-arid areas, due to\
    \ the high radiation load throughout the year,\nbut this is now also expected\
    \ to occur in more temperate and sub-tropical zones [12].\nTomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum\
    \ L.) are one of the most important crops worldwide [13] and\nare of great interest\
    \ to today’s society as they are a source of compounds with great health\nbeneﬁts\
    \ [14]. According to the FAO [15], Spain is the second-largest tomato producer\
    \ in\nEurope, with approximately 56,000 hectares under cultivation and a yield\
    \ of 85 t/ha.\nFarming land, soil, and water are the fundamental resources required\
    \ for conventional\nagriculture. The ﬁrst step towards the optimal use of these\
    \ resources is the incorporation of\nsoilless farming techniques [16]. With these\
    \ methods, plants can grow in an indoor envi-\nronment, reserving the land for\
    \ some other use. Soilless culture systems (SCS) in an almost\ncompletely controlled\
    \ environment constitute a relatively modern cultivation technology\nand are used\
    \ almost exclusively in greenhouses. Cultivation on horticultural growing\nmedia\
    \ (GM) such as rock wool, perlite, and coconut are the most frequently used SCS\
    \ for\nthe production of fruit, vegetables, and cut ﬂowers all over the world\
    \ [17]. Attempts have\nlong been made to eliminate the problems associated with\
    \ soil in greenhouses, including\nsoil-borne diseases, low soil fertility, and\
    \ high salt levels. Over the past 30–40 years, the\ndevelopment of suitable growing\
    \ media with optimal physical and chemical properties has\nled to soilless cultivation\
    \ in greenhouses taking a leading role. This development has also\nbeen favored\
    \ by advances in plant nutrition and irrigation through modern fertilization\n\
    approaches and automation [18].\nIn arid and semiarid regions, the demand for\
    \ water is constantly increasing as fresh-\nwater resources are being exhausted.\
    \ However, more water is needed to meet the future\ndemands of food production.\
    \ The best solution is thus to develop a water-saving man-\nagement technique\
    \ and/or move to adopt non-conventional sources of water for crop\nproduction.\
    \ The ideal solution would be to promote the use of marginal quality water,\n\
    especially saline water, for agricultural purposes [19].\nHowever, if saline water\
    \ is to be used on a large scale for crop irrigation, it must be\nbased on proper\
    \ irrigation management, and this is much more complicated than that of\nfreshwater\
    \ [20]. Many of the problems in irrigated soil can be controlled in soilless crops,\n\
    so there is considerable potential for employing saline water irrigation in soilless\
    \ media,\nparticularly for the production of vegetables [21]. Using saline water\
    \ for irrigation involves\na higher leaching fraction in soilless crops, which\
    \ affects plant nutrition and physiology [22].\nIrrigation systems should thus\
    \ consider the quality of water for irrigation management.\nDifferent irrigation\
    \ methods have been described [23], such as occasional irrigation,\npulse irrigation,\
    \ high-frequency irrigation, and continuous irrigation. These authors also\ndescribe\
    \ several approaches to making irrigation decisions: look-and-feel, gravimetric,\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 3177\n3 of 25\ntimer-based, sensor-based, and model-based methods.\
    \ In the current state of research on\nautomatic irrigation systems in soilless\
    \ crops, various systems can be found, many of them\ncommercial products already\
    \ in operation. Some irrigation scheduling methods are based\non the application\
    \ of a water balance and require an accurate estimation of the plants’ water\n\
    consumption. Crop evapotranspiration (ETc) can be estimated by indirect (climate-based)\n\
    methods or direct methods (using weighing or drainage lysimeters, balances, etc.)\
    \ [24].\nThe indirect methods of ETc calculation require climate sensors for radiation,\
    \ temperature,\nand humidity. Direct methods include gravimetric sensors [25],\
    \ measuring the moisture of\nthe substrate, using granular matrix sensors or capacitive\
    \ sensors [26], or measuring the\nwater potential or matrix voltage by tensiometers\
    \ or electro-tensiometers [27]. An optimally\ndesigned irrigation system will\
    \ deliver water to the plants to maximize water use efﬁciency\n(WUE) [23]. A detailed\
    \ review of the most representative irrigation methods for soilless\ncrops has\
    \ been performed [28].\nFor scheduling the irrigation of soilless crops, 60–80%\
    \ of the crops in Italy, France,\nPoland, Greece, and Hungary are irrigated based\
    \ on the experience of the grower and/or\nadvisor. Methods that either calculate\
    \ ETc or are based on incoming solar radiation are used\nin 60–95% of the crops\
    \ in The Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Portugal, and Belgium.\nDemand trays\
    \ are the predominant method in Spain [29]. Weighing balances are used in\n25%\
    \ of Dutch soilless crops. Soil/substrate moisture sensors (including tensiometers)\
    \ are\nused in 10–15% of soilless crops in Spain, Italy, The Netherlands, and\
    \ Portugal. These data\nshow that there is considerable room for improvement in\
    \ the irrigation management of\nsoilless vegetable crops [30].\nIn all irrigation\
    \ systems, decisions must be made about when to irrigate and for\nhow long. In\
    \ soilless growing systems, the irrigation process can last a few seconds or as\n\
    long as several minutes. Irrigation schemes are management strategies designed\
    \ to attain\nspeciﬁc crop production goals through various delivery and monitoring\
    \ methods. Optimal\nirrigation management is required to appreciably enhance water\
    \ productivity (or water use\nefﬁciency) for crops produced in greenhouses [31].\n\
    Agriculture 4.0 has been triggered by emerging technologies such as the Internet\
    \ of\nThings (IoT), artiﬁcial intelligence, data analytics, blockchain, big data,\
    \ etc. [32]. These tech-\nnologies address food safety-related issues, modernize\
    \ the agricultural supply chain [33],\nimprove data representation, storage, and\
    \ analysis, and provide better management\nand control.\nFinding a new way to\
    \ monitor single-plant water consumption is important to better\ndetermine how\
    \ much water should be provided to improve crop yield, quality, and so\non. Some\
    \ authors have explored the relationship between the daily irrigation applied\n\
    and melons’ daily weighted ET (WET) and then calculated the appropriate amounts\
    \ by\nweighing the plants [34]. A new, low-cost weighing lysimeter has been developed\
    \ for potted\nplants and its technical and economic evaluation in a 16-unit lysimetric\
    \ water consumption\nanalysis station [35].\nAfter studying the current state\
    \ of the art and the existing commercial systems, we\ndetected a market requirement\
    \ for a low-cost, scalable control system able to work together\nwith any type\
    \ of fertigation equipment. The systems currently available on the market are\n\
    considered expensive and require a large investment, so the technology is only\
    \ available to\nlarge-scale producers, leaving out the small farmer. As they can\
    \ only work with an irrigation\ncontroller of the same brand, the cost of expansion\
    \ to multiple zones skyrockets due to the\nsoftware and wiring required. The hypothesis\
    \ of this work is that the development of a\nlow-cost control system with high\
    \ performance will allow small farmers to improve the\nefﬁciency of water use\
    \ by obtaining better control of soilless crops. Therefore the aim of\nthis work\
    \ was to develop a low-cost system for self-managed irrigation of soilless crops\n\
    after selecting the most efﬁcient method of the three most representative irrigation\
    \ systems\nand considering the quality of the irrigation water.\nThe new system\
    \ is scalable and able to work with any of the fertigation controllers\ncurrently\
    \ on the market. The impact of this work will make it possible for small farmers\
    \ to\nSensors 2023, 23, 3177\n4 of 25\nhave access to affordable, cutting-edge\
    \ technology for soilless irrigation management with\nconsiderably improved productivity.\n\
    2. Materials and Methods\nThree irrigation control methods were compared in a\
    \ study to collect data for the\ndevelopment of an intelligent irrigation monitoring\
    \ and control system. Our aim was to\ndetermine the best sustainable system of\
    \ obtaining higher yields together with efﬁcient use\nof water.\n2.1. Agronomic\
    \ Trials\nThe experiment was carried out in a greenhouse in the experimental farm\
    \ “Tres\nCaminos” of the Centro de Edafología y Biología Aplicada del Segura (CEBAS)\
    \ in the munic-\nipality of Santomera (Murcia), whose coordinates are 38◦06′26.32′′\
    \ N and 1◦02′07.14.14′′ W\n(Figure A1).\nAgronomic trials were carried out with\
    \ the Sigfrid variety of tomatoes (Solanum\nlycopersicum) to evaluate three different\
    \ irrigation control systems for soilless crop produc-\ntion: Accumulated solar\
    \ radiation (AR); Gravimetry (G); and Volumetric Water Content\n(VWC) with two\
    \ types of water: Control (C, “Hoagland” Nutrient Solution); and Salinity (S,\n\
    “Hoagland” Nutrient Solution with 50 mM NaCl). The trials had a bifactorial design\
    \ (3 × 2)\nwith three irrigation methods combined factorially with two water qualities\
    \ in a random\nblock distribution. In each treatment, 4 culture bags were placed\
    \ per block, with 3 plants\neach, which made a total of 6 treatments and 24 plants\
    \ (replicates) per treatment. Planting\ndensity was 2.5 plants/m2. The drip irrigation\
    \ system consisted of a 2 L/h non-draining\nand self-compensating dripper per\
    \ plant. Treatments C-RA, C-G, and C-VWC were irri-\ngated from a single control\
    \ tank, and S-RA, S-G, and S-VWC from another tank containing\na saline solution.\
    \ The nutrient solution pH and EC were monitored, and drainage EC was\nmeasured\
    \ periodically. This distribution can be seen in Figure 1.\nThe 100 × 18 × 16\
    \ cm culture bags were made of cocopeat, and the cocopeat substrate\nhad the following\
    \ composition: organic material 92%, ash 8% m/mS, contraction <15% v/v,\ndry bulk\
    \ density 69 g/L, pH 5.5–6.5 and EC < 2.5 mS/cm.\n2.1.1. Analytical Data\nThe\
    \ plants were allowed to grow until production. Tomato fruits were harvested\n\
    daily when they turned red. The fresh weight and size of the individual tomatoes\
    \ were\ndetermined by the plant and treatment. The fruits were classiﬁed into\
    \ commercial and\nnon-commercial categories (small for weight less than 50 g or\
    \ having some physiopathology\nsuch as cracked or blossom-end-rot).\n2.1.2. Statistical\
    \ Analysis\nThe statistical analyses of production were carried out by two-way\
    \ ANOVA (SPSSv27\nStatistical Package, Chicago, IL, USA) with water quality and\
    \ irrigation methods as the\nmain factors, using a p = 0.05 probability cut-off\

    \ Devices, METER Group, Inc., \nPullman, WA, USA) was used to measure the volumetric\
    \ content of the substrate, operated \nby measuring the dielectric constant of\
    \ the substrate to determine its volumetric water con-\ntent, which is very sensitive\
    \ to water content. The sensor supplies a 70 MHz oscillating \nFigure 2. General\
    \ view of the test facility control architecture to manage three different irrigation\n\
    methods, Gravimetry (G); Volumetric Water Content (VWC); Accumulated solar radiation\
    \ (AR).\n2.2.1. Volumetric Water Content (VWC) Control System\nThis simple system\
    \ consisted of an on-off control to activate irrigation when a certain\nvolumetric\
    \ water content is detected in the substrate below a deﬁned set point and stop\n\
    it when the limit is reached. A MAS-1 model sensor (Decagon Devices, METER Group,\n\

    operated by measuring the dielectric constant of the substrate to determine its\
    \ volumetric\nwater content, which is very sensitive to water content. The sensor\
    \ supplies a 70 MHz\noscillating wave, which induces an electromagnetic ﬁeld in\
    \ the substrate around the sensor.\nA microprocessor in the sensor measures the\
    \ dielectric constant of the substrate, which is\nrelated to its volumetric content.\
    \ The microprocessor measures the dielectric and updates\nthe current once per\
    \ second. The transmitted 4–20 mA current is converted to volumetric\nsubstrate\
    \ content by the following correlation in the control software using rock wool\n\
    as substrate:\nVWC = 0.00446 × mA2 − 0.0359 × mA + 0.0741\n(1)\nThe scale 0–100\
    \ (% VWC) is expressed as a percentage of Span (FS). Applying these\nequations\
    \ will generally result in an accuracy of ±4% VWC as long as the electrical conduc-\n\
    tivity of the medium is less than 8 dS/m. The system is based on activation below\
    \ a VWC\nSet Point and a stop above a set maximum VWC value.\n2.2.2. Radiation\
    \ (AR) Control System\nSolar radiation is the most important energy source for\
    \ a plant and a determining\nclimatic factor for crop development and yield. Low\
    \ radiation levels lower the chlorophyll\ncontent and reduce the plant’s photosynthetic\
    \ activity and photochemical concentration.\nSolar radiation determines the demand\
    \ for water vapor in the atmosphere and is, therefore,\na condition for the crop’s\
    \ irrigation needs. Irrigation is initiated when the energy set in\nWh/m2 is reached,\
    \ restarting the accumulated radiation counter (0 Wh/m2) and continuing\nuntil\
    \ the set point is reached again.\nThe Apogee SP-110 sensor pyranometer was used\
    \ in the AR-controlled areas. This\nhad a supply voltage of 12 Vdc, a sensitivity\
    \ of 0.20 mV per W·m−2, and an uncertainty\ncalibration of 5%. It was mounted\
    \ on a level horizontal surface and faced north to minimize\nSensors 2023, 23,\
    \ 3177\n7 of 25\nAzimuth error. The sensor was connected to a transmitter capable\
    \ of measuring the signal\nin a range of 0–250 mV. The input range was adjusted\
    \ to the pyranometer output range\nto maximize signal resolution and minimize\
    \ noise. The pyranometer can be used to ﬁnd\nthe instantaneous value of the solar\
    \ irradiance in W/m2 or by integration to ﬁnd the\ntotal energy per square meter,\
    \ which strikes the instrument during a given period. The\ncalibration factor\
    \ K can be expressed as follows:\nK = 200 mV/(kW/m2)\n(2)\nThis value means that\
    \ when the solar irradiance equals 1 kW/m2 (typical for a\nclear, sunny day around\
    \ noon), the pyranometer output voltage will be about 200 mV.\nIf the output voltage,\
    \ for example, is 100 mV, then the solar irradiance would be about\n0.5 kW/m2\
    \ = 500 W/m2. In other words:\nS[kW/m2] = U[mV]/K\n(3)\nwhere U is the signal\
    \ voltage in millivolts, and S is measured in kW/m2.\n2.2.3. Gravimetric Control\
    \ System\nFor the treatments controlled by the gravimetric method (G), 4 weighing\
    \ trays were\nplaced on the crop line, following the continuity of the channel.\
    \ The drainage from the\nweight trays was ﬁrst measured by the double bucket counter\
    \ equipped with a reed contact,\ndrained through the ﬁltered drains at the base\
    \ of the collector, and then fell into the channel\nto be counted by another counter\
    \ at the end of the line together with the drainage from the\nother three bags.\n\
    After the drainage has been completed, the weight variation of the tray deﬁnes\
    \ the\nplant’s water needs and, unlike the (VWC) and (AR) systems, is a direct\
    \ measure of the\nstate of the crop. When the weight variation is equivalent to\
    \ the volume consignment\nconsumed by the Tray System, a new irrigation cycle\
    \ will begin.\nFor the weight measurement, two traction load cells in each tray\
    \ converted the load\nacting on them into electrical signals proportional to the\
    \ weight. For maximum sensi-\ntivity and temperature compensation, two strain\
    \ gauges under tension and two under\ncompression were connected to a Wheatstone\
    \ bridge.\nKnowing the power supply voltage, the force value was quantiﬁed by\
    \ connecting both\nload cell outputs to a box with the 4–20 mA signal conditioning\
    \ and transmission circuit.\nSince the output voltage in each load cell is proportional\
    \ to the variation of the resistances\nin the Wheatstone bridge, and this, in\
    \ turn, is proportional to the linear variation of the\nweight on the platform,\
    \ a 4–20 mA output signal with linear variation with respect to the\nweight on\
    \ the tray is obtained.\nAll the load cells receive the same power supply, and\
    \ when they are “unbalanced” by\nthe effect of the weight of the product, each\
    \ one supplies the same mV signal. Since the\ncells are in parallel, the end result\
    \ is the mV signal. The tray was aligned so that the same\nweight was supported\
    \ by each of the “S” type load cells, in this case, 40 kg, so the weighing\nsystem\
    \ can support 80 kg, including the dead weight (tray where the load is placed)\
    \ and\nthe maximum weight of the load. An ampliﬁer was used to condition the output\
    \ of the\nload cells.\nIt is very important to calculate the error measurement\
    \ for system validation. To\ndo this, the linearity error of the load cell was\
    \ taken into account, which is expressed as\na percentage of span (FS), or the\
    \ difference between the upper and lower measurement\nlimits, and which, in this\
    \ case, has a value of 0.03% FS. To calculate the error of the analog\nconditioning\
    \ system, the “Accuracy” value offered by the transmitter’s table of technical\n\

    \ two types of water and three systems for monitoring the crop\nwater status (gravimetric,\
    \ accumulated radiation, and volumetric water content sensor).\nDifferent agronomic\
    \ parameters were determined to validate both the calculation systems\nand the\
    \ accuracy of the measurement systems. Under the control conditions, the irrigation\n\
    method signiﬁcantly affected the yield, the gravimetric method being the one that\
    \ obtained\nthe greatest commercial yield. The other two methods used obtained\
    \ the same production,\nSensors 2023, 23, 3177\n10 of 25\nbelow the gravimetric\
    \ method. This difference in production could be explained by the\ngravimetric\
    \ method being adjusted more precisely to the plants’ water needs.\nThe impact\
    \ of different irrigation methods could be related to the water availability\n\
    in the tomato plants’ different phenological stages [36]. According to [37], increasing\
    \ soil\nmoisture during the last three stages (fruit growth, FG; fruit development,\
    \ FD; and fruit\nmaturity, FM) could signiﬁcantly increase tomato yield. Excessive\
    \ and insufﬁcient soil\nmoisture during the fruit setting (FS) stage had negative\
    \ effects on tomato yield. The\ncommercial tomato yield is signiﬁcantly reduced\
    \ by water deﬁciency during ﬂowering\nand/or yield formation phases [38]. Under\
    \ saline conditions, the irrigation method also\nsigniﬁcantly affects the commercial\
    \ yield. As can be seen in Figure 5, salinity drastically\nreduced the commercial\

    \ of the three under study was the gravimetric method in terms of yield. According\n\
    to the good results, the gravimetric method seems to be the best adapted to the\
    \ irrigation\nmanagement of the cocopeat substrate since it seems that it was\
    \ the method that improved\nthe availability of water of the substrate in relation\
    \ to the plants’ water needs. When\nthe irrigation method was VWC, the production\

    \ due to possibly imprecise measurements on\nsome occasions, as well as some failures\
    \ detected in the sensor measurements of the sensors\nthroughout the crop cycle.\
    \ With the accumulated radiation method, the commercial yield\nresults were similar\
    \ to those of the VWC method, which was not successful because the\nplants continued\

    \ Gravimetric Control System\nFrom the data obtained during the tests, it can\
    \ be concluded that gravimetric control is\nthe most efﬁcient method of improving\
    \ crop yield. For this, a more affordable commercial\nprototype smart tray was\
    \ developed with numerous improvements over the current com-\nmercial systems\
    \ as regards both hardware and software, thanks to the experience gained\nduring\
    \ the agronomic trials.\n3.2.1. General Architecture of the Gravimetric Control\
    \ System\nTo reduce costs and create highly competitive equipment, we decided\
    \ to work with\na Schneider PLC of the 241 series, model TM241CE24T/U, in the\
    \ Codesys programming\nenvironment. The main reason for changing the PLC model\
    \ was the possibility of digital\ncommunication via the Modbus RTU protocol without\
    \ incurring any additional costs.\nIn this development, the PLC communicates through\
    \ a switch with an HDMI screen\nand through the Modbus RTU protocol with a data\
    \ acquisition card that will collect infor-\nmation from all the sensors in the\
    \ control zones. This reduces wiring costs and simpliﬁes\nassembly, as it is no\
    \ longer necessary to send individual signals to the control panel, as\nwhen using\
    \ 4–20 mA signals.\nA 7′′ Weintek MT807oiE HMI screen was chosen instead of the\
    \ PC-based SCADA\nsystem due to its features and low price and for the following\
    \ reasons:\n-\nIt provides remote access to the program and to data, graphs, and\
    \ historical data and\ncan download data, which requires a license at a very low\
    \ cost.\n-\nIt can even act as a gateway to access the PLC programming itself\
    \ and even modify it\nif necessary.\nAs depicted in (Figure 8), in this case,\
    \ the control equipment can give an activation\norder to any of the currently\
    \ available fertigation devices through an operations panel,\nwhich can be any\
    \ type of device (mobile, PC, tablet) with an internet connection.\n3.2.2. Improvements\
    \ in Electronic Instrumentation and Communication\nTensile load cells were used\
    \ for the tests. This presented a structural problem as\nthe cell supports interfered\
    \ with the plant support, so torsion load cells were used in the\ncommercial model.\n\
    Another common problem that arose during the tests in equipment with low ﬂow\n\
    meters was related to the magnetized double spoon counters with reed contacts\
    \ to measure\nthe drainage volume. Other systems of pot cultivation use a conduit\
    \ crossing the platform\nconnected to a spherical PVC drainage tank. This container\
    \ was suspended from another\nloadcell which weighed it and the water it contained.\
    \ Once the tank was full, two electro-\nvalves (one connected to the input and\
    \ the other to the output) took over to open or close\nthe tank in such a way\
    \ that no drainage water was lost in the process [35]. Ref. [45] used\nload cells\
    \ for direct estimation of irrigation and drainage water in soilless systems.\
    \ As cited\nin [46], measurement systems range from weighing the lysimeter measuring\
    \ output every\n10 min to calculating a 60 min average of 1 min measurements,\
    \ although the expense of\nthese systems limits their use to research on plants\
    \ grown in containers.\nA reed relay has a mechanical switching capacity of millions\
    \ of operations; its service\nlife is conditioned by its load, which can be a\
    \ maximum of a few tens of mA with a\nmaximum voltage of tens of volts. The fact\
    \ that it was installed switching a 24 Vac relay\nwith no RC in either the relay\
    \ coil or the reed relay itself may have been the cause of the\nproblems. Although\
    \ the magnetization in the double spoon counters was mainly due to\nvoltage peaks\
    \ caused by the intermediate relays, mitigated by solid state relays, it was\n\
    decided to use another technology to obtain a permanent solution, as the company’s\
    \ export\nproﬁle requires robust solutions that require little maintenance.\n\
    Figure 9a shows the voltage peaks caused in a reed contact when an intermediate\n\
    relay is used. When a solid-state relay was used (Figure 9b) the voltage peaks\
    \ were\nconsiderably reduced.\nSensors 2023, 23, 3177\n14 of 25\nDespite the reduction\
    \ of voltage peaks, as the reed contact has a limited number of\noperations, a\
    \ new technology based on the Hall effect was developed. The Hall effect is\n\
    based on the appearance of an electric ﬁeld due to the separation of charges inside\
    \ a con-\nductor through which a current ﬂows in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld\
    \ with a component\nperpendicular to the movement of the charges. This electric\
    \ ﬁeld is perpendicular to the\nmovement of the charges and to the perpendicular\
    \ component of the applied magnetic\nﬁeld. A Hall-effect sensor, being a semiconductor\
    \ with no mechanical elements, is thus\ncapable of an unlimited number of maneuvers.\

    \ the number of control zones\nin an installation at a reduced cost.\nSince the\
    \ control panel is in the service area and the SDB in the greenhouse, to simplify\n\
    sensor calibration, the option of using a mobile application via Bluetooth connection\
    \ is\noffered, which can also be used to update the software if necessary.\nWhen\
    \ communicating with more than one SDB, termination resistors must be used\nthat\
    \ reduce the sensitivity to electrical noise, with a termination resistance equal\
    \ to the\ncharacteristic impedance of the cable (normally 120 Ω for twisted pairs).\n\
    3.2.3. Control System\nIn order to create scalable equipment, in addition to using\
    \ SDB modules with Modbus-\nRTU connection, programming was carried out in the\
    \ Codesys environment using function\nblocks and variable structures (Figure A3).\n\
    The equipment can thus be adapted to the needs of the individual installation,\
    \ as\nthe modular structure of the programming makes it easy to expand the software\
    \ from\none control zone to as many as necessary. As in the test control system,\
    \ the intuitive and\nvisual Ladder language was chosen for programming. For the\
    \ screen, we opted for an HMI\ncontrol panel as it has practically all the possibilities\
    \ of a SCADA system, such as:\n•\nVisualizing the information and monitoring the\
    \ processes running in the machine in\nreal-time. As shown in (Figure A4), it\
    \ is possible to record the values of the irrigation\nand drainage volumes, the\
    \ weight of the tray, and its drainage percentage, as well as\nthe irrigation\
    \ time and the values provided by each of the sensors.\n•\nEntering the information\
    \ needed to operate, select recipes, display indicators, etc.\n•\nDisplay and\
    \ control instruments and mechanisms. In this case, the number of plants\nand\
    \ the number of drippers per plant, the drainage command, and the counter volumes\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 3177\n18 of 25\nper pulse must be entered (Figure 11). It is\
    \ also necessary to deﬁne an active schedule\nas well as the volume consumed per\
    \ plant.\n•\nAlarms, permissions, irrigation graphs, and logs (Figure 12). Macros\
    \ were created\nto obtain all the information regarding the measured weight magnitudes,\
    \ EC, pH\nand drainage temperature, EC, VWC, and substrate temperature and the\
    \ values of\nthe irrigation and drainage volumes, and other indirectly calculated\

    \ the data obtained during the agronomic tests, it can be concluded that the best\
    \ \ncontrol system of the three under study was the gravimetric method in terms\
    \ of yield. \nJudging by the good results, the gravimetric method seems to be\
    \ the best adapted to co-\ncopeat substrate irrigation management since it was\
    \ the method that was found to im-\nprove the availability of water in the substrate\
    \ in relation to the pants’ watering needs. \nAfter selecting the method with\
    \ the best agronomic performance, we developed a com-\npetitive, cost-effective\
    \ automatic gravimetric control system based on the experience \ngained during\
    \ the field trials of the first prototype. This new system had a significant cost\
    \ \nreduction of around 50% less than the current leading commercial systems.\
    \ It is also scal-\nable, can be remotely controlled, receives software updates,\
    \ and provides access to all the \nirrigation data. This new design is compatible\
    \ with any current fertigation controller \nthrough the use of external activations\
    \ and shutdowns, unlike the costly equipment on \nthe market, which requires a\
    \ controller of the same brand. The two factors of price and \ncompatibility put\
    \ this control equipment within reach of small producers, who can in-\ncrease\
    \ their production significantly for a small investment. \nValuable know-how was\
    \ gained from experience obtained during the trials to design \ngravimetric commercial\
    \ irrigation control equipment. Although traction load cells were \nused in the\
    \ tests, it was found that their supports interfered with the plant trellises,\
    \ so it \nwas decided to opt for torsion load cells, which do not interfere with\
    \ the plant. The tray \nis also aligned with the cultivation line for minimal\
    \ visual impact. Another problem that \narose during the tests was that the contact\
    \ counters used became magnetized and stopped \ncounting the pulses, which interfered\
    \ with the control system. A new non-magnetizing \nHall-effect sensor was thus\
    \ developed for flow meters that can withstand an unlimited \nnumber of operations,\
    \ replacing the reed contacts in the double-bucket meters for a slight \ncost\
    \ increase. These meters did not become magnetized during the tests, while the\
    \ error \nwas in no case greater than 5%. \nThe SDB data acquisition card was\
    \ developed to receive all the signals from the mul-\ntiple sensors to reduce\
    \ wiring and minimize assembly times. This data acquisition system \ndeveloped\
    \ for the weighing control system, in addition to receiving information from the\
    \ \npH and EC drainage sensors, the load cells, and the irrigation and drainage\
    \ meters is able \nto communicate by the SDI-12 communication protocol with several\
    \ substrate sensors. \nThese sensors provide information on temperature, volumetric\
    \ water content, and the \nFigure 13. (a) Weighing tray with torsion load cells\

    \ agronomic tests, it can be concluded that the\nbest control system of the three\
    \ under study was the gravimetric method in terms of\nyield. Judging by the good\
    \ results, the gravimetric method seems to be the best adapted\nto cocopeat substrate\

    \ the experience\ngained during the ﬁeld trials of the ﬁrst prototype. This new\
    \ system had a signiﬁcant\ncost reduction of around 50% less than the current\

    \ developed for ﬂow meters that can withstand an unlimited\nnumber of operations,\
    \ replacing the reed contacts in the double-bucket meters for a slight\ncost increase.\
    \ These meters did not become magnetized during the tests, while the error\nwas\
    \ in no case greater than 5%.\nThe SDB data acquisition card was developed to\
    \ receive all the signals from the\nmultiple sensors to reduce wiring and minimize\
    \ assembly times. This data acquisition\nsystem developed for the weighing control\
    \ system, in addition to receiving information\nfrom the pH and EC drainage sensors,\
    \ the load cells, and the irrigation and drainage meters\nis able to communicate\
    \ by the SDI-12 communication protocol with several substrate\nsensors. These\
    \ sensors provide information on temperature, volumetric water content,\nSensors\
    \ 2023, 23, 3177\n20 of 25\nand the crop EC, which is obtained by a correlation\
    \ according to the crop in question. The\ninformation obtained by the SDB is sent\
    \ via Modbus-RTU protocol to the PLC. A PLC\nworking in the Codesys environment\
    \ was chosen to enable the use of standard Modbus-\nRTU communication protocols.\
    \ Thanks to the SDB, this equipment is scalable because\nparallel communication\
    \ can be made with a PLC via Modbus-RTU, allowing a large number\nof trays to\
    \ be networked, considerably reducing the wiring requirements and labor costs\n\
    and facilitating future expansion. The SDB communication sensors can be calibrated\
    \ via\nan APP on a mobile phone. This is a signiﬁcant improvement over other equipment\n\
    currently available on the market, as the sensors can be calibrated via Bluetooth\
    \ in direct\ncommunication with the SDB data acquisition system. A single operator\
    \ can thus remotely\ncalibrate the sensors in a tray hundreds of meters away from\
    \ the service area with the main\ncontrol panel.\nAn HMI display was chosen, which\
    \ offers the same features as an expensive SCADA\nsystem, with the possibility\
    \ of remote control, and which does not charge according\nto the number of variables\
    \ used. This HMI interface will also serve to access the PLC\nprogramming. Communication\
    \ between data acquisition cards and PLC via radio is\nforeseen in future developments,\
    \ which will eliminate the need for wiring. The fact that\nthe software works\
    \ in the Codesys environment, based on function blocks and variable\nstructures,\
    \ means the equipment’s control zones can be increased almost automatically.\n\
    It should be noted that remote access is available to the programming parameters,\
    \ to all\nthe irrigation data, and to remote graphics. These features make this\
    \ new equipment an\naffordable and efﬁcient irrigation control system for soilless\
    \ crops, with improved crop\nyields and savings in water and fertilizers, making\
    \ it possible for small-scale farmers to\nobtain a huge improvement in productivity.\
    \ In the next steps, we expect to increase the\ncomplexity of the control so that\
    \ other parameters, such as drainage EC or the daily light\nintegral (DLI), are\
    \ taken into account without incurring system cost increases.\nFinally, it should\
    \ be noted that this control system has been thoroughly tested, both\nin the laboratory\
    \ and in the test facility itself, and has recently been put on the market\nwith\
    \ encouraging results while further trials are being conducted to determine how\
    \ well a\nweighing tray represents the conditions in a given area.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    \ Pakistan, 22–24 September 2022.\nAbstract: Soil moisture sensors and hydraulic\
    \ modeling play a vital role in managing surface irriga-\ntion systems. Crop water\
    \ productivity can be improved by managing the inﬂow cut-off time and\noptimizing\
    \ the other ﬁeld scale measurements. As such, hydraulic modelling and ﬁeld experiments\n\
    were carried out at the University of Agriculture Faisalabad-Pakistan. The soil\
    \ moisture sensor\n(SEN-13322) and the WinSRFR model were used for this purpose.\
    \ In total, nineteen treatments\nincluding eighteen simulated treatments and one\
    \ conventional treatment were designed at two levels\nof discharge (Q1:0.0025\
    \ and Q2:0.0035 m3s−1), at three sensor positions (S1:55%, S2:65%, and S3:75%)\n\
    across the ﬁeld length, as well as with three different border widths (B1:6.4m,\
    \ B2:8.5m, and B3:10.7m)\nafter successful sensor and model calibration during\
    \ the two growing seasons of 2016–2017 and\n2017–2018. The results revealed a\
    \ signiﬁcant difference between the means and the treatment T10 i.e.,\nQ2S1B1\
    \ that were found to be highly efﬁcient and uniform.\nKeywords: cut-off time;\
    \ WinSRFR model; border width; irrigation science; crop production\n1. Introduction\n\
    Water shortage has become a major problem and challenge around the world in recent\n\
    decades. The shortage of water has also affected agricultural output and encouraged\n\
    scientists to consider how best to manage the available water resources. Pakistan\
    \ is a\ndeveloping nation that struggles with problems, including the lack of\
    \ water as a result\nof industrialization, urbanization, and the rising demand\
    \ for water [1]. The current per\ncapita amount of water resources in Pakistan\
    \ ranges from 5600 m3 to 1000 m3 [2]. To\naddress the issue of water scarcity\
    \ and to satisfy the demand for agricultural products\nwhile maximizing the use\
    \ of limited amounts of available water resources and minimizing\nwater losses,\
    \ efﬁcient irrigation methods at the farm level are needed [3]. The farmers in\n\
    Pakistan irrigate their crops using age-old techniques (i.e., ﬂood irrigation)\
    \ that involve\nﬂowing water like a sheet along the ﬁeld's length.\nWith the ﬂood\
    \ irrigation technique, uncontrolled water runs toward the end of the ﬁeld,\n\
    which usually waterlogs the crop and irrigates it more than the crop water requirement,\n\
    resulting in overall yield decrease and the wastage of water. If irrigation water\
    \ is cut-off\nat the right time before it reaches the ﬁeld tail-end boundaries,\
    \ the effectiveness of the\nEnviron. Sci. Proc. 2022, 23, 38. https://doi.org/10.3390/environsciproc2022023038\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/environsciproc\nEnviron. Sci. Proc. 2022, 23, 38\n\
    2 of 5\nsurface irrigation system can be improved [4]. To use the cut-off approach,\
    \ a farmer must\nmake numerous ﬁeld rounds to determine when the dose of water\
    \ has reached a particular\ndistance from the starting end or away from the tail\
    \ end. But this investigation could be\ndifﬁcult, therefore, advanced techniques\
    \ are required for accurate measurements to cut-off\nwater supply and to save\
    \ water while increasing crop productivity. A common surface\nirrigation system\
    \ is ﬁtted with soil moisture sensors, which may help supply minimal water\nwithout\
    \ over-irrigating [5]. Although there are many different hydrological models,\
    \ the\nWinSRFR is a more sophisticated version of the SRFR model and offers more\
    \ computational\npossibilities than other hydrological models [6]. In this study,\
    \ the traditional sensor-\nbased systems were also integrated with Wi-Fi and computer\
    \ communication networks to\nautomate Pakistan's irrigation system and determine\
    \ the actual irrigation interval.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Experimental\
    \ Site\nThis experiment was carried out at the Postgraduate Agriculture Research\
    \ Station\n(PARS), University of Agriculture, and Faisalabad-Pakistan. For the\
    \ experiment, a ﬁeld of\n33.84 m × 27.44 m was divided into 30 equal grids. Each\
    \ grid was 5.64 m × 5.488 m, and\nsoil samples were collected from each grid at\
    \ the depth of 9 in for physical and chemical\nanalysis. The ﬁeld capacity in\
    \ the experimental ﬁeld area was determined using a soil\nmoisture tester.\n2.2.\
    \ Hydraulic Simulation Model of Surface Irrigation System\nIn the present study,\
    \ the USDA-developed WinSRFR 4.1.3 was used to simulate a\nsurface irrigation\
    \ system. The WinSRFR is the latest and most popular model being used\nfor this\
    \ type of study [7].\n2.3. Model Calibration\nThe location of the single directing\
    \ point affects the ﬂow rate, cut-off time, and inﬁltra-\ntion parameters. During\
    \ land preparation, which includes making a border with varying\nwidth and length\
    \ at the experimental site, 10 pegs of 30 cm height were positioned at equal\n\
    intervals along the borders. Subsequently, the time was noted when the water reached\n\
    each peg. Finally, the WinSRFR model and the advance times derived from ﬁeld data\
    \ were\ncompared.\n2.4. Experimental Design in WinSRFR\nAlmost ninety treatments\
    \ were created in the model by combining different border\nwidths, discharge cut-offs,\
    \ and inﬂow cut-offs concerning distance. However, all the other\nparameters including\
    \ ﬁeld length, ﬁeld slope, and ﬁeld depth, etc. were held constant\nduring the\
    \ simulation process. Among these total treatments, 19 (one traditional and 18\n\
    simulated) were used in the actual ﬁeld studies. These treatments had three levels\
    \ for\nsensor position (55%, 65%, and 75%) and border width (6.4 m, 8.5 m, and\
    \ 10.7 m).\n2.5. Water Use Efﬁciency\nIn this study, crop yield and the total\
    \ water consumed by the crop over the season\nwas used to calculate water use\
    \ efﬁciency (Equation (1)), which is also known as true\nagricultural water productivity\
    \ [8].\nCWP = Grain yield (Kg ha−1)\nWater applied (mm)\n(1)\n3. Results and Discussion\n\
    3.1. Soil Chemical Analysis\nThe analysis of the soil samples showed that the\
    \ soil pH ranged from 7.7 to 8.7\nand had a range of 2 to 11 ppm for the readily\
    \ available phosphorus. High phosphorus\nEnviron. Sci. Proc. 2022, 23, 38\n3 of\
    \ 5\nconcentration in soil is recommended [9] because it appears to be crucial\
    \ for soil fertility\nand for preventing soil from becoming zinc deﬁcient. Additionally,\
    \ the range of the amount\nof accessible nitrogen in soil samples was between\
    \ 0.017 to 0.042%.\n3.2. Moisture Sensors Calibration\nThe relationship between\
    \ the moisture content and the sensor reading resistivity was\nsuccessfully established.\
    \ These sensors are excellent for irrigation scheduling due to the\nhigh coefﬁcient\
    \ of determination i.e., 0.98 (Figure 1).\nEnviron. Sci. Proc. 2022, 23, 38 \n\
    3 of 5 \n \n \n3. Results and Discussion \n3.1. Soil Chemical Analysis \nThe analysis\
    \ of the soil samples showed that the soil pH ranged from 7.7 to 8.7 and \nhad\
    \ a range of 2 to 11 ppm for the readily available phosphorus. High phosphorus\
    \ \nconcentration in soil is recommended [9] because it appears to be crucial\
    \ for soil fertility \nand for preventing soil from becoming zinc deficient. Additionally,\
    \ the range of the \namount of accessible nitrogen in soil samples was between\
    \ 0.017 to 0.042%. \n3.2. Moisture Sensors Calibration \nThe relationship between\
    \ the moisture content and the sensor reading resistivity \nwas successfully established.\
    \ These sensors are excellent for irrigation scheduling due to \nthe high coefficient\
    \ of determination i.e., 0.98 (Figure 1). \n \nFigure 1. Comparison between soil\
    \ moisture content (%) and sensor reading (resistivity). \n3.3. WinSRFR Hydraulic\
    \ Simulations \nThe WinSRFR model was successfully calibrated, and to prevent\
    \ over- or under-\nirrigation, hydraulic simulations of all the treatments were\
    \ run on the model. \nApplication efficiency (AE) alone cannot provide a reliable\
    \ indicator of how well surface \nirrigation is working. Additional measurements\
    \ are needed that include the distribution \nuniformity lower quarter (DUlq) and\
    \ the distribution uniformity minimum (DUmin) \n[10]. These three performance\
    \ indices (i.e., AE = 92, DUmin = 87, and DUlq = 91) showed \nhigher values, indicating\
    \ that the treatment T10 has excellent uniformity and efficiency. \n3.4. Plant\
    \ Growth Parameters for Maize \nThe crop yield is affected by various plant growth\
    \ factors, including the plant \npopulation per unit area, the plant height, the\
    \ number of leaves per plant, the leaf area \nindex, the length of a cob, the\
    \ number of cobs per row, and the number of seeds per cob. \nThe average number\
    \ of plants for the treatments T10 and T11 was 230 and 225, \nrespectively. The\
    \ lowest counts were in the second year when there was an average of \n215 and\
    \ 170 plants for T12 and T14, respectively. The smallest plant height in T9 was\
    \ 146.3 \ncm, while the largest in T14 was 181.44 cm. \n3.5. Water Use Efficiency\
    \  \nWater use efficiency provides information about how effectively the field's\
    \ crop \nutilized the applied water. A sensor was used to compare the differences\
    \ in the \nirrigation water application between the two years based on the total\
    \ rainfall and the soil \nmoisture levels. Figure 2 displays the Water use Efficiency\
    \ (WUE) of maize for the year \n2016–2017 and 2017–2018. The Maximum WUE was 15.78\
    \ kg/ha/mm observed in T10; \n13.88 kg/ha/mm in T11; 13.07 kg/ha/mm in T1; and\
    \ 3.17 kg/ha/mm using the conventional \nmethod in year 1. WUE for the treatment\
    \ T10 in the second Year was 14.93 kg/ha/mm, \nfollowed by the treatment T11 at\
    \ 13.64 kg/ha/mm and the treatment T1 at 12.38 \nkg/ha/mm. The conventional treatment\
    \ method showed the lowest WUE, at 3.64 \nkg/ha/mm. \ny = 0.0932x + 13.495\nR²\

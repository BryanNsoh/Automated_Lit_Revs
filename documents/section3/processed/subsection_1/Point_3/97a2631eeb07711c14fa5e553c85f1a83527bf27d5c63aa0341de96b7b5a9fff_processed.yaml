  analysis: Initial evaluation of seasonal ET measurements via neutron moisture meters
    with drone-based ET modeling results showed reasonable performance with the modeling
    technique. The ET estimates from the drone-based ET modeling approach could effectively
    estimate seasonal cotton water use at this field site. The basal crop coefficients
    (Kcb) time series for each plot in the breeding trial were variable according
    to the combined effect of planting date, irrigation rate, and cotton variety on
    fc, as measured using drone-based images. The results suggest highly variable
    water use patterns among the treatments imposed in the cotton breeding trial.
    Mean fiber yield for the 2016 and 2017 cotton breeding trials was 1831 kg ha-1,
    and seasonal ET ranged from 661 to 1223 mm. TWUE was correlated with the fiber
    elongation at failure, while seasonal ET and T were correlated with the upper
    half mean fiber length. Linear mixed modeling identified many differences (p <
    0.05) for the eleven cotton traits in response to the treatments imposed with
    the cotton breeding trial. However, among the fiber quality traits, only UI was
    different with growing season. Planting date led to differences in most of the
    cotton traits, with the exception of two fiber quality traits, STR and SFC. Likewise,
    irrigation rate led to differences in all traits except for the STR fiber quality
    trait. Differences among the eight cotton cultivars were found for all eleven
    cotton traits. Fiber yield and ET were different for all the interaction terms
    included in the linear mixed model, while the remaining cotton traits were occasionally
    different for these interactions. Most importantly, the mixed modeling results
    show that the methodology used to estimate cotton water use and CWUE led to differences
    for these traits among the eight cultivars. Thus, the approach may have value
    for breeding programs that aim to improve CWUE and identify drought tolerant cultivars.
    Eight cotton cultivars were ranked based on TWUE, and DP1044B2RF (C3) had the
    highest TWUE and Arkot9704 (C2) had the second highest TWUE. DP1044B2RF (C3) and
    FM958 (C5) consistently achieved higher TWUE at the 80% irrigation level as compared
    to the higher irrigation levels, which may highlight commercial breeders’ efforts
    to select for drought tolerance in the development of these varieties.

    \ of crop water use efﬁciency (CWUE), deﬁned as crop yield per volume of\nwater\
    \ used, is an important goal for both crop management and breeding. While many\
    \ technologies\nhave been developed for measuring crop water use in crop management\
    \ studies, rarely have these\ntechniques been applied at the scale of breeding\
    \ plots. The objective was to develop a high-throughput\nmethodology for quantifying\
    \ water use in a cotton breeding trial at Maricopa, AZ, USA in 2016\nand 2017,\
    \ using evapotranspiration (ET) measurements from a co-located irrigation management\n\
    trial to evaluate the approach. Approximately weekly overﬂights with an unmanned\
    \ aerial system\nprovided multispectral imagery from which plot-level fractional\
    \ vegetation cover (fc) was computed.\nThe fc data were used to drive a daily\
    \ ET-based soil water balance model for seasonal crop water\nuse quantiﬁcation.\
    \ A mixed model statistical analysis demonstrated that differences in ET and\n\
    CWUE could be discriminated among eight cotton varieties (p < 0.05), which were\
    \ sown at two\nplanting dates and managed with four irrigation levels. The results\
    \ permitted breeders to identify\ncotton varieties with more favorable water use\
    \ characteristics and higher CWUE, indicating that the\nmethodology could become\
    \ a useful tool for breeding selection.\nKeywords: breeding; drought; evapotranspiration;\

    Drought stress arising from water deﬁcit is a leading cause of crop production\
    \ losses worldwide.\nSpeciﬁc regions of the world are also projected to experience\
    \ increases in the frequency and severity\nof future drought events due to effects\
    \ of climate change on precipitation patterns [1,2]. To maintain\nproductivity\
    \ and security of food, ﬁber, and other agricultural products, increasing crop\
    \ water use\nefﬁciency (CWUE), deﬁned as the ratio of crop yield and water consumption\
    \ volume, is an important\ngoal to ameliorate impacts of future drought. Increases\
    \ in CWUE can result both from improvements\nin agronomic management practices\
    \ [3] and by developing improved crop cultivars that yield highly\nunder water\
    \ deﬁcit conditions [4]. Although these pathways are often pursued independently\
    \ within\ndisciplinary boundaries, the most comprehensive solutions towards CWUE\
    \ improvement will be\nachieved through multidisciplinary efforts.\nAdoption of\
    \ information technologies for problem solving in the agricultural sciences has\
    \ been\nan especially pervasive occurrence in recent years. For example, precision\
    \ irrigation, where water\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1682; doi:10.3390/rs10111682\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1682\n2 of 19\napplications\
    \ are tuned based on the spatial and temporal crop need, is a primary technology\
    \ for\nimproving CWUE in crop production settings [5,6]. Other agronomic solutions\
    \ involve improved\nfertility management, optimizing sowing dates, using cover\
    \ crops or mulches, and choosing\nalternative crops or crop rotations [3]. In\
    \ the plant sciences, high-throughput plant phenomics,\nwhich involves deployment\
    \ of crop sensing systems for rapid phenotyping of breeding populations,\nhas\
    \ potential to guide crop improvement efforts toward cultivars with increased\
    \ tolerance to drought\nstress [4,7,8]. Information technologies in the form of\
    \ sensors, imagers, data loggers, sensor deployment\nvehicles, geographic information\
    \ systems, geostatistical methods, data management approaches,\nand engineering\
    \ control systems are central to the success of these technical solutions to improving\n\
    CWUE. However, further efforts are needed to solidify the role of information\
    \ technology for practical\nadvancement towards this goal.\nRemote sensing has\
    \ been used to estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET) and predict drought stress\n\
    at multiple scales [9–13]. For example, Yebra et al. [14] combined vegetation\
    \ metrics derived from\nthe MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)\
    \ satellite with the Penman-Monteith\nequation to estimate ET for evergreen and\
    \ deciduous broadleaf forests. At the agricultural ﬁeld scale,\nColaizzi et al.\
    \ [15] installed infrared thermometers on an overhead sprinkler irrigation machine\
    \ to\nestimate daily ET. They proposed that the approach could improve CWUE through\
    \ better irrigation\nscheduling. In addition, Hunsaker et al. [16] used multispectral\
    \ cameras aboard a manned helicopter\nto map the normalized difference vegetation\
    \ index (NDVI) of a cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) ﬁeld,\nestimated basal crop\
    \ coefﬁcients from NDVI, and scheduled irrigation using an ET-based soil water\n\
    balance model [17]. Results for one growing season showed that the recommendations\
    \ from the\nscheduling model led to increased CWUE when NDVI was used to estimate\
    \ basal crop coefﬁcients.\nAdditional ﬁeld testing is needed to further realize\
    \ CWUE improvements using remote sensing to\nguide irrigation management decisions.\n\
    Leveraging the technology previously developed for precision agriculture applications,\
    \ remote and\nproximal sensing has recently become a highly popular tool for field-based\
    \ plant phenotyping,\nparticularly by integrating imaging equipment with unmanned\
    \ aerial systems (i.e., drones) to obtain very\nhigh resolution imagery of plant\
    \ breeding trials. For example, Zaman-Allah et al. [18] related nitrogen\nstress,\
    \ senescence, and yield for ten maize (Zea mays L.) hybrids to NDVI from multispectral\
    \ images\ncollected with a drone. In addition, Sankaran et al. [19] used a multispectral\
    \ camera with a drone to\nestimate seedling emergence and stand density for more\
    \ than 100 winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)\nvarieties in Washington State.\
    \ Condorelli et al. [20] measured NDVI with a drone-based multispectral\ncamera\
    \ over 248 durum wheat (Triticum durum L.) lines at different growth stages and\
    \ water regimes.\nA subsequent genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified\
    \ 22 single quantitative trait loci (QTL)\nfor NDVI, particularly as related to\
    \ terminal drought stress. Although many important advancements\nhave been made,\
    \ moving remote sensing data analyses beyond the NDVI will enhance the quantification\n\
    of useful phenotypes.\nFew studies, if any, have aimed to directly phenotype crop\
    \ water use or CWUE for purposes\nof breeding or genomic analysis. Rather, the\
    \ focus has been to estimate related plant traits, such as\nspectral indices that\
    \ correlate with plant water status, under both well-watered and water-limited\n\
    conditions [21–24]. A key difference is that plant water status describes the\
    \ plant state at a singular\ntime point, whereas crop water use is a process that\
    \ occurs over time. For this reason, efforts to\nintegrate process-based simulation\
    \ models with spectral measurements of plant states may provide\nphenotypes that\
    \ better express the process-based nature of plant growth and water consumption\
    \ [25].\nAlthough the integration of remote sensing data with models of radiation\
    \ transfer, crop growth,\nand soil water balance has been widely studied for regional\
    \ and ﬁeld-scale mapping of crop water use,\nsuch techniques have not been applied\
    \ for ﬁeld-based, high-throughput plant phenomics.\nThe main goal of this study\
    \ was to develop a methodology for phenotyping crop water use\nand CWUE in a cotton\
    \ breeding trial, using ET estimates from a co-located irrigation management\n\
    study to evaluate the approach. It attempts to merge efforts from the ET remote\
    \ sensing community\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1682\n3 of 19\nwith efforts in the\
    \ plant science community in a multidisciplinary effort toward CWUE improvement.\n\
    Speciﬁc objectives were to (1) estimate fractional vegetation cover (fc) from\
    \ multispectral images\ncollected over the cotton ﬁeld trials with a drone, (2)\
    \ use plot-level fc to derive crop water use\ncalculations from an ET-based daily\
    \ soil water balance model, and (3) identify cotton cultivars with\nfavorable\
    \ yield, ﬁber quality and water use efﬁciency across treatments and growing seasons.\n\
    2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Field Experiments\nCotton ﬁeld experiments were\
    \ conducted at the University of Arizona’s Maricopa Agricultural\nCenter (MAC)\
    \ near Maricopa, AZ (33.079◦N, 111.977◦W, 360 m above sea level) during the 2016\n\
    and 2017 growing seasons (Figure 1).\nThe environment in central Arizona is arid\
    \ and hot,\nwith maximum daily air temperatures regularly exceeding 38 ◦C in July\
    \ and August. Growing\nseason precipitation from April through September amounted\
    \ to 42 and 51 mm in 2016 and 2017,\nrespectively. In comparison, short crop reference\
    \ ET during the same period was 1364 and 1404 mm in\n2016 and 2017, respectively.\
    \ Thus, cotton production required irrigation to meet evaporative demand.\n2014\n\

    \ 2018, 10, 1682\n4 of 19\nSoil variability at the 6-ha ﬁeld site was characterized\
    \ via a multi-year soil sampling effort at\n160 locations (not shown). A tractor-mounted\
    \ soil sampler (model 25-TS, Giddings Machine Co.,\nWindsor, CO, USA) was used\
    \ to collect cylindrical soil samples (0.04-m diameter × 0.4-m depth)\nat ﬁve\
    \ incremental soil proﬁle depths centered at 0.2, 0.6, 1.0, 1.4 and 1.8 m. Soil\
    \ texture analysis\nwas conducted in the laboratory using the hydrometer method\
    \ of Gee and Bauder [26], and the soil\nwater holding limits of each sample was\
    \ computed from texture data using the Rosetta pedotransfer\nfunctions [27]. For\
    \ ET estimation purposes (discussed below), ordinary kriging was used to spatially\n\
    interpolate soil water limits at the central location of each ﬁeld plot (Figure\
    \ 1). Geostatistics were\nconducted using the “geoR” package within the R Project\
    \ for Statistical Computing software. Primarily,\nsoil texture at the ﬁeld site\
    \ was sandy loam and sandy clay loam with drained upper limits between\n0.16 and\
    \ 0.22 cm3 cm−3 and lower limits between 0.08 and 0.11 cm3 cm−3.\nData from two\
    \ ﬁeld experiments (Experiment #1 and Experiment #2), each with a unique\nexperimental\
    \ design and purpose, were used to complete the objectives of this study. The\
    \ two ﬁeld\nexperiments were established on adjacent land areas (Figure 1), both\
    \ receiving irrigation from the same\noverhead, lateral-move sprinkler irrigation\
    \ system (Zimmatic, Lindsay Corporation, Omaha, NE, USA).\nAdvanced technology\
    \ on the irrigation machine permitted the application of variable irrigation rates\n\
    based on georeferenced irrigation maps uploaded to the machine’s control panel.\
    \ The variable-rate\nirrigation system permitted unique control of irrigation\
    \ rates from individual drop hoses, which were\nspaced 1.0 m apart and located\
    \ at the center of each interrow area. Nozzles were positioned to emit\nwater\
    \ less than 1.0 m above the soil surface. For uniform soil wetting prior to cotton\
    \ emergence, spray\npads giving a spray diameter of approximately 5.0 m were used.\
    \ After emergence, the pads were\nchanged to a “bubbler” style, which emitted\
    \ large droplets with a 0.3-m spray diameter at the center of\neach interrow area.\
    \ In addition to reducing water loss to evaporation, the bubbler pads increased\
    \ the\nspatial accuracy of irrigation applications relative to the intended application\
    \ areas delineated in the\ngeoreferenced irrigation maps. Spatial application\
    \ error with the variable-rate irrigation machine was\nestimated to be less than\
    \ 2.0 m. The overhead irrigation system with variable-rate capability permitted\n\
    both ﬁeld experiments to incorporate multiple irrigation rates as a primary treatment.\n\
    Experiment #1 tested cotton yield and water use responses to variable irrigation\
    \ rate and timing\nfor one commercial cotton variety (Deltapine 1549 B2XF, Monsanto\
    \ Company, St. Louis, MO, USA).\nTreatment plots were relatively large (12.2 m\
    \ (12 cotton rows) × 30.0 m) and required a majority of\nthe ﬁeld area (Figure\
    \ 1). The experimental design included four replications of sixteen irrigation\n\
    management treatments (64 plots), which involved all the possible combinations\
    \ of four irrigation\nrates applied during two distinct periods of the growing\
    \ season. The four irrigation rates were 60%,\n80%, 100%, and 120% of the recommendation\
    \ provided by an irrigation scheduling tool based on the\nCSM-CROPGRO-Cotton agroecosystem\
    \ model [28]. The two irrigation periods were from ﬁrst square\nto peak bloom\
    \ (approximately the ﬁrst of June through mid-July) and from peak bloom to 90%\
    \ open\nboll (approximately mid-July through the ﬁrst week of September). The\
    \ various combinations of the\nfour rates during the two times resulted in sixteen\
    \ total irrigation treatments, which led to cotton\ngrown under a variety of soil\
    \ water status conditions. The entire ﬁeld area was disked and planed\nprior to\
    \ planting. Cotton was planted with a north-south row orientation on 25 April\
    \ 2016 (day of year\n(DOY) 116) and 18 April 2017 (DOY 108).\nOf highest relevance\
    \ to the present study, Experiment #1 incorporated weekly soil water content\n\
    measurements via a ﬁeld-calibrated neutron moisture meter (model 503, Campbell\
    \ Paciﬁc Nuclear,\nMartinez, CA, USA). After crop emergence, steel access tubes\
    \ were installed at the center of each\ntreatment plot (Figure 1) using the tractor-mounted\
    \ soil sampler. From mid-May to early October,\nthe neutron moisture meter was\
    \ deployed on a weekly basis (approximately 20 times per growing\nseason) to measure\
    \ soil water content from 0.1 to 1.9 m in 0.2-m incremental depths at each access\n\
    Remote Sens. 2018, 10, 1682\n5 of 19\ntube. Soil water content data were used\
    \ to estimate ET and deep seepage (DS) between successive\nmeasurement events\
    \ using the soil water balance approach described by Hunsaker et al. [29]:\nET\
    \ =\n7\n∑\ni=1\n(Di,1 − Di,n−1) +\nn−1\n∑\nj=1\n(Rj + Ij) − DS,\n(1)\nDS = max\
    \ (0.0,\n10\n∑\ni=8\n(Di,1 − Di,n−1)),\n(2)\nwhere ET is the total evapotranspiration\
    \ and DS is the total deep seepage occurring from the\nbeginning of a given measurement\
    \ day (denoted as day j = 1) to the end of the day before the\nsuccessive measurement\
    \ date (denoted as j = n − 1), Di,1 and Di,n−1 are respectively the water depth\n\
    measurements at soil depth increment i at the beginning of day 1 and at the end\
    \ of day n − 1, and Rj\nand Ij are respectively the precipitation and net irrigation\
    \ depths received on day j. For the sake\nof practicality, soil water content\
    \ measurements collected on the morning of day n were used to\napproximate soil\
    \ water content at the end of day n − 1. Deep seepage was not permitted to be\
    \ negative,\nmeaning upﬂux from below the neutron access tube was considered negligible.\
    \ The seasonal ET\nestimates from neutron moisture meter data provided important\
    \ veriﬁcation that the ET estimation\nmethodology (discussed below) provided reasonably\
    \ accurate results.\nExperiment #2 was a breeding trial that tested the responses\
    \ of eight cotton cultivars (Table 1) to\ntwo planting dates and four irrigation\
    \ rates (Figure 1). The experimental design was a randomized\ncomplete block design\
    \ with planting date as the block and irrigation rate treatments nested within\n\
    the blocks. Each cultivar was replicated three times for each irrigation treatment,\
    \ totaling 96 plots\nper block. The first planting date treatment was sown on\
    \ 26 April 2016 (DOY 117) and 19 April 2017\n(DOY 109), and the second planting\
    \ date treatment was sown on 18 May 2016 (DOY 139) and 10 May\n2017 (DOY 130).\
    \ The four irrigation rates were 60%, 80%, 100%, and 120% of the recommendation\n\
    provided by a simulation tool for irrigation scheduling [28] and were administered\
    \ consistently from\nfirst square (early June) to 90% open boll (early September).\
    \ Irrigation rates were administered uniformly\nwithin spatial areas containing\
    \ 24 treatment plots (8 cultivars × 3 replications). Buffer areas with width\n\
    of 6.0 m (six cotton rows) and planted to a single commercial cotton variety were\
    \ incorporated centrally\nalong the boundaries of irrigation treatments to prevent\
    \ spatial error in the variable-rate irrigation\napplication from affecting cultivar\
    \ treatments. In 2016, the plot dimensions for cultivar treatments\nwere 3.0 m\
    \ (three cotton rows) × 4.6 m with a 1.5 m buffer area between plots. In 2017,\
    \ the plot size\nwas reduced to 2.0 m (two cotton rows) × 4.6 m, and the buffer\
    \ area between plots remained 1.5 m.\nDue to the relatively small size and large\
    \ number of treatment plots (i.e., 192 per growing season),\nplot-level ET estimation\
    \ via neutron moisture meter measurements and other common ET measurement\nmethodologies\
    \ was impractical. Thus, this study aimed to estimate ET by integrating plot-specific\n\
    remote sensing data and an ET-based soil water balance model with site-specific\
    \ soil parameterization,\nproviding an approach for high-throughput phenotyping\
    \ of cotton water use in this breeding trial.\nTable 1. Summary of eight cotton\

    \ DAP1; days after the second planting, DAP2.\nOn the morning of remote sensing\
    \ surveys, four 8-m × 8-m calibration tarps (Group VIII\nTechnologies, Provo,\
    \ UT, USA) were positioned near the cotton ﬁeld. Concurrently with drone\nimage\
    \ acquisition, ground-based radiometric measurements of each calibration tarp\
    \ were collected\nwith a portable ﬁeld spectroradiometer (FieldSpec 3, Analytical\
    \ Spectral Devices, Inc., Boulder,\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1682\n7 of 19\nCO,\
    \ USA), which was sensitive to wavelengths between 350 and 2500 nm. Additional\
    \ radiometric\nmeasurements over a calibrated, 99% Spectralon panel (Labsphere,\
    \ Inc., North Sutton, NH, USA) were\nused to characterize incoming solar irradiance\
    \ and to compute spectral reﬂectance factors of each tarp\nduring overﬂight. Based\
    \ on the quantum efﬁciency and ﬁlter functions for the multispectral cameras,\n\
    the tarp spectral reﬂectance data were ﬁltered to provide singular reﬂectance\
    \ factors for each tarp,\ncorresponding to each channel of the multispectral cameras.\
    \ The ﬁltered tarp reﬂectance data were\nused for image calibration efforts.\n\
    A commercial photogrammetry software (Pix4DMapperPro, Pix4D S.A., Lausanne, Switzerland)\n\
    was used to stitch images for each channel of the multispectral cameras. Geographic\
    \ coordinates from\n21 ground control points around the ﬁeld area were surveyed\
    \ with a real-time kinematic (RTK) global\npositioning receiver and were incorporated\
    \ into the image processing for georeferencing purposes.\nThe Pix4D software was\
    \ set to use camera calibration information and measurements from the upward\n\
    facing solar irradiance sensor for initial image calibration. Additionally, the\
    \ software provided an\noption to input the known reﬂectance of one calibration\
    \ target. Because reﬂectance measurements\nwere available for the calibration\
    \ tarps, the darkest calibration tarp was used for the known reﬂectance\ninput,\
    \ instead of the typical reﬂectance panel supplied by the camera manufacturer.\n\
    Comparisons of the measured tarp reﬂectance data with the values from tarp pixels\
    \ in the\northomosaic suggested that additional image calibration was needed following\
    \ Pix4D image processing.\nFor each multispectral image band, linear regression\
    \ equations were developed to relate the measured\nreﬂectance of all four calibration\
    \ targets to the average pixel value of each target in the images.\nUsing the\
    \ band math function in a commercial remote sensing software (Environment for\
    \ Visualizing\nImages (ENVI), Version 5.5, Exelis Visual Information Solutions,\
    \ Boulder, CO, USA), the linear\nregression equations were applied to compute\
    \ reﬂectance for all pixels in the image. The set of four\n(Sequoia) or ﬁve (RedEdge)\
    \ calibrated multispectral image bands were then layer stacked, such that\nfalse\
    \ color composite images (e.g., Figure 1) could be inspected for accuracy of image\
    \ calibration\nand georeferencing.\nBased on spectral information in all image\
    \ channels, a supervised maximum likelihood classiﬁer\nwithin the ENVI software\
    \ was used to segment the composite images into bare soil and vegetation\ncomponents.\
    \ The classiﬁer was trained by manually selecting regions of interest associated\
    \ with the\ntwo classes. Due to the relatively high spatial resolution from drone-based\
    \ images, it was generally\nsimple to select multiple regions of interest that,\
    \ with high certainty, represented pure spectral data\nfor each class. The image\
    \ classiﬁcation result was used to produce a binary image with values of\n0 for\
    \ bare soil and 1 for vegetation. The binary image was loaded into a geographic\
    \ information\nsystem (QGIS, www.qgis.org) for calculation of zonal statistics\
    \ within the boundaries of each ﬁeld\nplot, as delineated with shapeﬁle polygons\
    \ (Figure 1). Based on the total vegetation pixels within\neach polygon, the fractional\
    \ vegetation cover (fc) of each ﬁeld plot was computed for each ﬂight date\n(Table\
    \ 2).\n2.3. Fractional Cover Modeling\nTo facilitate calculations of cotton water\
    \ use for each ﬁeld plot (discussed below), daily fc estimates\nwere obtained\
    \ using a Kalman smoothing algorithm [30] to integrate drone-based fc measurements\n\
    with fc from a daily logistic growth model:\ndfc\ndt = r fc\n\x12\n1 −\nfc\nfc,max\n\
    \x13\n,\n(3)\nwhere r describes the growth rate (d−1) and fc,max is the maximum\
    \ value that fc attains. This differential\nequation has an analytical solution:\n\
    fc =\n \ncer(t−t0)\n1 +\nc\nfc,max er(t−t0)\n!\n,\n(4)\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10,\
    \ 1682\n8 of 19\nwhere\nc =\nfc,max fc,0\nfc,max − fc,0\n(5)\nand fc,0 is fc at\
    \ the initial time (t0). The model was parameterized for each ﬁeld plot by adjusting\
    \ r,\nfc,0, and fc,max to minimize error between modeled fc and the drone-based\
    \ fc measurements. The t0\nterm was ﬁxed as the DOY for planting each plot. Subsequently,\
    \ Equation (3) with ﬁtted parameters\nwas incorporated into an unscented Kalman\
    \ smoothing algorithm to develop daily fc time series that\nconsidered uncertainty\
    \ in both the measured and modeled fc data. Kalman smoothing was especially\n\
    important for characterizing fc in plots where the imposed treatments caused atypical\
    \ growth patterns\n(Figure 2). To achieve reasonable time series as assessed visually,\
    \ the fc state transition variance was\nset to 0.0002 while the measurement variance\
    \ was set ﬁve times higher at 0.001. A Python script was\ndeveloped to conduct\
    \ this analysis, which incorporated a Nelder–Mead optimizer within the “scipy”\n\
    package for parameter ﬁtting and the “pykalman” package for unscented Kalman smoothing.\n\

    the 2017 growing season at Maricopa, AZ, USA.\n2.4. Crop Water Use Estimation\n\
    The daily fc time series from Kalman smoothing were rescaled to formulate basal\
    \ crop coefﬁcient\n(Kcb) time series, which were used to drive an ET-based daily\
    \ soil water balance model as described\nin the Food and Agriculture Organization\
    \ of the United Nations Paper No. 56 (FAO-56) [17]. Brieﬂy,\ndaily crop water\
    \ use (ETc) was calculated with the following equation:\nETc = (KcbKs + Ke) ETos,\n\
    (6)\nwhere ETos is the standardized short crop reference evapotranspiration [31],\
    \ Ke is the soil water\nevaporation coefﬁcient, and Ks describes the effect of\
    \ water stress on transpiration. Daily ETos was\ncomputed using data from an Arizona\
    \ Meteorological Network station (AZMET) approximately 1.2 km\nfrom the ﬁeld site.\
    \ Required meteorological measurements included the daily minimum and maximum\n\
    air temperature, dew point temperature, solar irradiance, and wind speed. Based\
    \ on recommended\ncomputations for maximum Kcb given environmental data for Maricopa,\
    \ the Kcb time series were\nrescaled from fc with a minimum value of 0.15 and\
    \ maximum value of 1.225. The coefﬁcients Ke and\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1682\n\
    9 of 19\nKs were calculated as described in FAO-56. For Ks in particular, calculations\
    \ were based on a daily\nsoil water balance methodology, where soil water holding\
    \ limits deﬁne the total plant available water.\nUnder non-stressed conditions\
    \ with root zone soil water at the drained upper limit, Ks is 1.0 and has\nno\
    \ effect on ETc calculations (Equation (6)). As soil water is depleted, reductions\
    \ in Ks are calculated,\nwhich lead to decreased ETc from plant transpiration.\
    \ As mentioned above, the soil water holding\nlimits were speciﬁed uniquely for\
    \ each treatment plot based on soil sampling, soil texture analysis,\npedotransfer\
    \ function evaluations, and geostatistical calculations at the ﬁeld site. Thus,\
    \ the crop water\nuse calculations were based on plot-level, site-speciﬁc information\
    \ for both the soil water holding\nproperties and the plant growth impacts on\
    \ Kcb as characterized through drone-based fc. The soil\nwater status on day i\
    \ was calculated as follows:\nDi = Di−1 − Pi − Ii + ETci + DSi,\n(7)\nwhere D\
    \ is the depth of root zone soil water depletion from the drained upper limit\
    \ at the end of the\nday, P and I are the precipitation and irrigation received\
    \ on the day, ETc is the daily crop water use\nfrom Equation (6), and DS is the\
    \ water lost to deep seepage, which is calculated when water inputs\nexceed the\
    \ root zone soil water storage capacity. This ET-based soil water balance model,\
    \ as described\nin FAO-56 [17], was coded as a Python script for use in all cotton\
    \ water use calculations in this study.\nFor each treatment plot in both ﬁeld\
    \ experiments in both growing seasons, ETc calculations were\ninitiated on the\
    \ day of planting and terminated after crop maturity in the ﬁrst week of October.\n\
    To summarize the seasonal crop water use, daily ETc calculations were aggregated\
    \ over time.\nFor comparison to measured ETc data in the irrigation management\
    \ study (Equation (1)), daily ETc\ncalculations were aggregated from the ﬁrst\
    \ to the last neutron moisture meter measurement dates in\neach growing season.\
    \ For the cotton breeding trial, ETc data were aggregated over the entire calculation\n\
    period from planting to crop maturity. Furthermore, seasonal CWUE (kg m−3) was\
    \ calculated from\nthe ratio of measured cotton ﬁber yield and modeled seasonal\
    \ cotton ET. To eliminate the effect of\nsurface soil water evaporation, seasonal\
    \ water use efﬁciency was also computed considering only the\ntranspiration component\
    \ of ET (TWUE, kg m−3).\n2.5. Statistical Analysis\nStatistical software (SAS\
    \ for Windows, ver. 9.3, SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) was used to ﬁt a\nlinear\
    \ model for each of eleven cotton traits in response to the experimental treatments\
    \ in the breeding\ntrial. The eleven cotton traits were ﬁber yield (FY, kg ha−1),\
    \ seasonal evapotranspiration (ET, mm),\ncrop water use efﬁciency (CWUE = FY:ET,\
    \ kg m−3), seasonal transpiration (T, mm), transpiration water\nuse efﬁciency\
    \ (TWUE = FY:T, kg m−3), micronaire (MIC, unitless), upper half mean ﬁber length\
    \ (UHM,\nmm), uniformity index (UI, mm mm−1), ﬁber strength (STR, HVI g tex−1),\
    \ ﬁber elongation at failure\n(ELO, %), and short ﬁber content (SFC, %). Mixed\
    \ model analysis of variance was conducted for each\ntrait using the SAS MIXED\
    \ procedure with the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) method. In the\ncase\
    \ that more than one trait estimate was available per plot, the plot mean was\
    \ used as the dependent\nvariable. The statistical model for each trait (Y) was\n\
    Yijklmn = µ + αi + βj + γk + δl(k) + (αβ)ij + (αγ)ik + (βγ)jk + (αδ)il(k) + (βδ)jl(k)\n\
    +(αβγ)ijk + (αβδ)ijl(k) + ζm + (αζ)im + ϵn(ijklm),\n(8)\nwhere experimental year\
    \ (αi), cotton cultivar (βj), planting date (γk), irrigation treatment nested\
    \ within\nplanting date (δl(k)), and corresponding interaction terms were ﬁtted\
    \ as ﬁxed effects, and the replicate\n(ζm) and year by replicate interaction ((αζ)im)\
    \ were ﬁtted as random effects. To examine associations\namong traits, Pearson’s\
    \ correlation coefﬁcients (r) were determined using the SAS CORR procedure.\n\
    Remote Sens. 2018, 10, 1682\n10 of 19\n3. Results\n3.1. Crop Water Use Evaluation\n\
    Evaluation of seasonal cotton water use estimates from the drone-based ET modeling\
    \ approach as\ncompared to ET measurements from neutron moisture meters demonstrated\
    \ reasonable performance\nwith the modeling technique (Figure 3). The root mean\
    \ squared errors (RMSE) between measured and\nmodeled seasonal ET among 64 treatment\
    \ plots in the irrigation management study were less than 5%.\nIn both seasons,\
    \ the model underestimated ET for the four treatment plots with the highest ET\
    \ amounts.\nThese treatment plots received 120% of the recommended irrigation\
    \ rate over the whole season and\nwere therefore overwatered. One possibility\
    \ is that measured ET from the neutron moisture meters\nwas overestimated, which\
    \ is likely considering that deep seepage was estimated from soil moisture\nstates\
    \ typically one week apart (Equation (2)). In actuality, more water ﬂux to deep\
    \ seepage may have\noccurred for the overwatered plots, which would reduce estimates\
    \ for measured ET (Equation (1))\nif it could be accurately measured. For other\
    \ treatment plots, which were not overwatered for the\nentire season, the agreement\
    \ between measured and modeled ET was very good. In 2016 and 2017,\nmeasured deep\
    \ seepage ranged from 45 to 97 mm and from 21 to 63 mm, respectively (not shown).\n\
    Modeled deep seepage in both years ranged from 0 to 146 mm with a majority of\
    \ plots modeled as\nhaving zero seepage. On average, measured deep seepage was\
    \ less than 7% and 4% of ET in 2016 and\n2017, respectively, which demonstrates\
    \ the high importance of crop water use as a pathway for water\nloss from the\
    \ agroecosystem. Overall, the results show that the drone-based fc and soil water\
    \ balance\nmodeling approach could effectively estimate seasonal cotton water\
    \ use at this ﬁeld site.\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\n1.1\n1.2\nMeasured ET (m)\n\

    \ in 2017 at Maricopa, AZ, USA.\n3.2. Basal Crop Coefﬁcients\nThe basal crop coefﬁcient\
    \ (Kcb) time series for each plot in the breeding trial were variable\naccording\
    \ to the combined effect of planting date, irrigation rate, and cotton cultivar\
    \ on fc, as measured\nusing drone-based images (Figure 4). For example on DOY\
    \ 184 in 2016, which is approximately the\ndate of ﬁrst ﬂower, the Kcb among plots\
    \ in the ﬁrst planting varied from 0.40 to 1.09 (Figure 4a).\nThis means that\
    \ some plots were transpiring as low as 23% of full transpiration capacity on\
    \ this day,\nwhile others were transpiring as high as 88% of full capacity. As\
    \ compared to the standard trapezoidal\nKcb time series, which were computed based\
    \ on days after planting as recommended in FAO-56,\nmany plots reached full transpiration\
    \ capacity earlier than the standard, while others never reached\nRemote Sens.\
    \ 2018, 10, 1682\n11 of 19\nfull transpiration capacity. The drone-based fc data\
    \ also suggested that late season Kcb remained\nhigher than the standard Kcb recommendation,\
    \ which may be true because cotton was traditionally a\nperennial plant and for\
    \ agronomic purposes requires defoliation by desiccant application to terminate\n\
    leaf growth and transpiration. Overall, to the extent that Kcb via drone-based\
    \ fc correlates to plant\ntranspiration rates, the data suggest highly variable\
    \ water use patterns among the treatments imposed\nin the cotton breeding trial.\n\

    \ and ranged from 703 to 2929 kg ha−1 (Table 3),\nas measured in the cotton breeding\
    \ trial for two growing seasons, two planting dates, and four irrigation\nrates.\
    \ Computations of seasonal ET with the drone-based fc and soil water balance modeling\
    \ approach\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1682\n12 of 19\nranged from 661 to 1223 mm,\
    \ indicating that some plots used up to twice as much water as others.\nEstimates\
    \ of the seasonal transpiration component of ET ranged from 389 to 1069 mm. On\
    \ average,\n0.19 kg of cotton ﬁber was produced per m3 of water consumed (i.e.,\
    \ CWUE). Considering only\nthe transpiration component of ET, mean TWUE was 0.25\
    \ kg m−3, a 26% increase as compared to\ncalculations that included surface evaporation.\
    \ This establishes an upper limit on the potential for\nCWUE improvements through\
    \ management practices that reduce surface evaporation.\nThe ﬁber quality measurements\
    \ suggested desirable ﬁber characteristics in some cases and less\ndesirable characteristics\
    \ in others. With micronaire values above 4.3, none of the plots produced ﬁber\n\
    with micronaire in the range required for premium pricing (i.e., 3.7 to 4.2).\
    \ Upper half mean length\nranged from 26 to 32 mm, indicating medium to long ﬁber\
    \ lengths. Uniformity indices ranged from 79\nto 86 mm mm−1, indicating average\
    \ to high ﬁber length uniformity. Fiber strength ranged from 27 to\n40 HVI g tex−1,\
    \ indicating average to very strong ﬁbers. Elongation at failure ranged from 4.0%\
    \ to 7.6%,\nindicating very low to high ﬁber elongation and an overall wide range\
    \ for this study. With r equal to\n0.31 and 0.33 (not shown), CWUE and TWUE, respectively,\
    \ were correlated with ﬁber elongation at\nfailure. Thus, the plots with higher\
    \ water use efﬁciency tended to produce ﬁbers that could stretch\nmore before\
    \ breaking. In addition, with r equal to 0.30 and 0.34, seasonal ET and T, respectively,\
    \ were\ncorrelated with upper half mean ﬁber length. Thus, plots with higher water\
    \ use generally produced\nlonger ﬁbers. Fiber yield did not correlate with any\
    \ ﬁber quality metrics with r greater than 0.24. Thus,\nCWUE and TWUE were better\
    \ estimators of ﬁber quality metrics than ﬁber yield in some cases.\nTable 3.\

    \ mixed modeling identiﬁed many differences (p < 0.05) for the eleven cotton traits\

    \ 4). Mean FY, ET, CWUE,\nT and TWUE were different in the two growing seasons.\
    \ However, among the ﬁber quality traits,\nonly UI was different with growing\
    \ season. The two planting date treatments led to differences\nin most of the\
    \ cotton traits, with the exception of two ﬁber quality traits, STR and SFC. Likewise,\n\
    irrigation rate led to differences in all traits except for the STR ﬁber quality\
    \ trait. Differences among\nthe eight cotton cultivars were found for all eleven\
    \ cotton traits. Fiber yield and ET were different for\nall the interaction terms\
    \ included in the model (Equation (8)), while the remaining cotton traits were\n\
    occasionally different for these interactions (not shown). Most importantly, the\
    \ mixed modeling results\nshow that the methodology used to estimate cotton water\
    \ use and CWUE led to differences for these\ntraits among the eight cultivars.\

    0.0006\n3.4. Relevance to Breeding\nImproving CWUE via plant breeding requires\
    \ the identiﬁcation of cultivars that yield highly\nbut with reduced transpiration.\
    \ An important aspect of the modeling methodology is that the crop\ncoefﬁcients\
    \ (Equation (6)) permit partitioning of water use among plant transpiration and\
    \ surface\nevaporation components. Thus, for purposes of breeding, the results\
    \ can be discussed in terms of\nTWUE, the crop yield per volume of water transpired\
    \ because breeding will primarily improve CWUE\nthrough the transpiration component\
    \ of ET.\nPlots of ﬁber yield versus seasonal transpiration demonstrated a positive\
    \ correlation for all\ngrowing season and planting date combinations (Figure 5),\
    \ generally equating higher yield with higher\nwater use as commonly shown in\
    \ crop water production functions [3]. Coefﬁcients of determination (r2)\nbetween\
    \ ﬁber yield and seasonal transpiration were higher with the second planting than\
    \ with the ﬁrst\nplanting, indicating water management was a stronger driver of\
    \ yield variability with later planting.\nBoth ﬁber yield and seasonal transpiration\
    \ were reduced with the second planting as compared to the\nﬁrst planting. The\
    \ effect was due in part to a shorter growing season for the second planting because\
    \ it\nwas planted approximately one month later than the ﬁrst planting while irrigation\
    \ for both planting\ndate treatments was terminated at the same time in early\
    \ September. Extending the irrigation period\nlater into September may have increased\
    \ ﬁber yield and transpiration for the second planting.\nReduction in seasonal\
    \ transpiration for the second planting may also be due to environmental\ndifferences.\
    \ In central Arizona, the month of June (DOY 152 to 181) typically has high ambient\n\
    temperatures and low humidity, which leads to increased evaporative demand (i.e.,\
    \ ETos). In addition,\nas seen in Figure 4, the Kcb (i.e., transpiration rate)\
    \ during this period was much higher for the ﬁrst\nplanting than for the second\
    \ planting due to higher fc. Thus, water use in the month of June was\nmuch greater\
    \ for the ﬁrst planting (Equation (6)). With the second planting, the hot and\
    \ dry period in\nJune was largely avoided, and maximum Kcb was not attained until\
    \ July when the Arizona monsoon\nseason brought higher humidity, reduced ambient\
    \ air temperatures, and lower evaporative demand.\nThus, improvements in CWUE\
    \ may come from better timing of the maximum Kcb period with the\nArizona monsoon\
    \ season. Furthermore, because r2 between ﬁber yield and transpiration was greater\n\
    for the second planting, the Arizona monsoon season may provide a better environment\
    \ for selecting\nheritable traits that improve yield and CWUE and increase genetic\
    \ gain in breeding populations.\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 1682\n14 of 19\n0.0\n\

    Data were collected as part of a cotton breeding trial conducted at Maricopa,\
    \ AZ, USA.\nThe calculated TWUE for each cotton variety in the breeding trial\
    \ showed signiﬁcant variation\namong planting dates and irrigation rates (Figure\
    \ 6). The TWUE for the ﬁrst 2017 planting at the\n60% irrigation rate was unreasonably\
    \ high (Figure 6c). This was likely due to errant irrigation\napplications to\
    \ those plots, which was supported by soil moisture measurements (data not shown).\n\
    After removing this treatment from consideration, DP1044B2RF (C3) and Arkot9704\
    \ (C2) demonstrated\nthe most consistent TWUE across years, planting dates, and\
    \ irrigation treatments. Furthermore, C3 was\nranked as the second highest yielding\
    \ line and also had consistent ﬁber quality traits across years\nand treatments.\
    \ This means producers should expect consistent yields with C3 and C2 over a range\n\
    of soil water status conditions. However, selecting on yield stability alone can\
    \ be unreliable due to\nthe effects of environmental variation across growing\
    \ seasons. Calculated TWUE may provide an\nalternative phenotype for selection\
    \ because aggregated environmental conditions are included in the\nestimate, thus\
    \ reducing selection error caused by environment or management variation. For\

    A main advantage of the ET-based soil water balance model (Equations (6) and (7))\
    \ is its\npartitioning of crop water use into surface evaporation and plant transpiration\
    \ components via\ncrop coefﬁcients (Kcb, Ks, and Ke). As dictated by the model\
    \ equations [17], Ks and Ke are mainly\ninﬂuenced by soil water holding characteristics,\
    \ and Ke is additionally inﬂuenced by the irrigation\nsystem and ground cover.\
    \ Thus, reductions in crop water use via changes to these coefﬁcients can\nbe\
    \ achieved only through adjustments in management practices. Some options include\
    \ switching to\nsubsurface drip irrigation to limit surface evaporation, adopting\
    \ conservation tillage to increase ground\ncover, or using variable-rate irrigation\
    \ to adjust irrigation rates based on the site-speciﬁc soil water\nholding characteristics.\
    \ The remaining coefﬁcient, Kcb, is the primary driver of plant transpiration\
    \ in\nthe model. As such, reductions in crop water use via changes to Kcb can\
    \ be achieved mainly through\nplant breeding. The goal for breeding should be\
    \ to select varieties that yield highly while exhibiting\nKcb time series (Figure\
    \ 4) that reduce water use through transpiration. By incorporating models of\n\
    Remote Sens. 2018, 10, 1682\n16 of 19\ncropping system processes into crop breeding\
    \ and management efforts, the improvements offered by\nmanagement versus breeding\
    \ can be better quantiﬁed.\nThe present study achieved high-throughput phenotyping\
    \ of crop water use efﬁciency using\nrelatively simple imaging and modeling technologies.\
    \ Obviously, plant transpiration is dictated by\nprocesses with higher complexity\
    \ than can be described through fc time series alone. For example,\nthe processes\
    \ of root water uptake, water transport through the plant, leaf stomatal conductance,\n\
    and other plant water regulatory mechanisms are not considered in this study.\
    \ Incorporation of more\ncomplex models that consider plant water status in greater\
    \ detail may improve transpiration estimates,\nalthough models with higher complexity\
    \ often also increase the model parameterization requirements.\nTo be effective,\
    \ the model parameters would need to be accurately estimated, or perhaps phenotyped,\n\
    for each variety, which could be the subject of future studies. In this study,\
    \ a simpler model was\nchosen due to the relative ease of driving the model with\
    \ basic fc measurements from drone-based\nmultispectral imaging. A main contribution\
    \ is the use of time-series fc estimates with a simple soil\nwater balance model\
    \ to provide seasonal transpiration estimates for breeding trials at the plot-level.\n\
    As such, the relatively simple methodology provides a practical way to incorporate\
    \ information on\ncrop water use into decisions on breeding selection and may\
    \ be especially useful when the goal is to\nsimply determine which varieties to\
    \ keep in the breeding program.\nAs this study represents one of several initial\
    \ efforts with drone-based imaging at the Maricopa\nresearch station, much has\
    \ been learned over the duration of the study. Regarding the choice of\nsensors,\
    \ the commercial multispectral cameras (i.e., Micasense RedEdge and Parrot Sequoia)\
    \ were\npopular products marketed for the agricultural sector at the time of the\
    \ study, and they were therefore\ngiven primary focus for ﬂight hours. As such,\
    \ the data from these sensors more fully covered the\ngrowing season as required\
    \ for time-series fc estimates herein. An astute reader will note that fc time\n\
    series could perhaps be more easily attained from digital color (RGB) cameras,\
    \ which is a simpler\nand more pervasive imaging technology with greater commercial\
    \ options for choices of camera and\ndrone platform. Additionally, the image spatial\
    \ resolution is often higher for RGB cameras, and image\ncalibration methods are\
    \ simpler as compared to multispectral image calibration. Data from RGB\ncameras\
    \ were also collected over the ﬁeld site but with less frequency and consistency,\
    \ which made\nthese data less useful for the study. Because the Parrot Sequoia\
    \ camera collected both RGB and\nmultispectral data, efforts with this camera\
    \ in 2017 (Table 2) aimed to collect both types of data in\na single drone ﬂight.\
    \ However, the success of this approach was reduced by data reliability issues\n\
    with the camera and multiple crashes of the ﬁxed-wing drone for which the camera\
    \ was designed.\nHence, the MicaSense RedEdge camera on a custom hexacopter drone\
    \ was the favored conﬁguration\nherein. For future efforts to map fc time series,\
    \ an even better conﬁguration may be an RGB camera\non a copter-style drone, for\
    \ which there are now many commercial options. However, future studies\nshould\
    \ also further contrast the advantages and disadvantages of multispectral versus\
    \ RGB imaging\nfrom drone platforms.\nMissing from this study is the use of thermal\
    \ cameras to quantify differences in plant water status\namong varieties, which\
    \ again was related to giving primary focus for ﬂight hours to the multispectral\n\
    cameras. Incorporating canopy temperature information from thermal cameras into\
    \ the methodology\nhas great potential to improve transpiration estimates among\
    \ varieties. For example, Kullberg et al. [32]\nrecently described the use of\
    \ stationary infrared thermometry to adjust Ks in the ET-based soil water\nbalance\
    \ model (Equation (6)), applied to maize. Although their data was collected from\
    \ ground-based\nsystems rather than drones, their approach demonstrates the integration\
    \ of Kcb from RGB data and\nKs from thermal data into the ET-based soil water\
    \ balance model for quantifying maize water use.\nFuture efforts should evaluate\
    \ this data fusion technique for improved high-throughput phenotyping\nof crop\
    \ water use among crop varieties, likely using RGB and thermal data from drone-based\
    \ images\nor sensors mounted on ground-based phenotyping vehicles [25].\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2018, 10, 1682\n17 of 19\n5. Conclusions\nHigh-throughput phenotyping\
    \ of water use in 192 cotton breeding plots was achieved using\napproximately\
    \ weekly vegetation cover estimates from drone-based multispectral cameras to\
    \ drive\nbasal crop coefﬁcients in a daily soil water balance model. Differences\
    \ in water use estimates among\neight cotton cultivars were found via linear mixed\
    \ modeling, indicating that the approach can assist\nbreeders in the identiﬁcation\
    \ of cultivars with favorable water use characteristics. Combining the\nwater\
    \ use estimates with crop yield can quantify crop water use efﬁciency, allowing\
    \ breeders to\nselect varieties that maximize crop production per volume of water\
    \ used. Options for improving\nthe methodology include considering models with\
    \ greater complexity in crop water use processes,\nassessing alternative options\
    \ for drone-based image data collection, and incorporating other crop\nphenotypes\
    \ such as canopy temperature. Taken together, the study demonstrates a methodology\
    \ for\nhigh-throughput phenotyping of crop water use, providing breeders a tool\
    \ for water use quantiﬁcation\nand additional traits for consideration in selective\
    \ breeding.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, K.R.T. and A.L.T.; Methodology,\

  limitations: This study did not consider the use of thermal cameras to quantify
    differences in plant water status among varieties, which may result in improved
    ET estimates. In addition, the image spatial resolution is often higher for RGB
    (Red, Green, and Blue color channels) cameras, and image calibration methods are
    simpler for RGB cameras as compared to multispectral cameras, which may make RGB
    cameras a better choice for future studies.

  title: High-Throughput Phenotyping of Crop Water Use Efficiency via Multispectral
    Drone Imagery and a Daily Soil Water Balance Model
  verbatim_quote1: '"The main goal of this study was to develop a methodology for
    phenotyping crop water use and CWUE in a cotton breeding trial, using ET estimates
    from a co-located irrigation management study to evaluate the approach."'
  verbatim_quote2: '"It attempts to merge efforts from the ET remote sensing community
    with efforts in the plant science community in a multidisciplinary effort toward
    CWUE improvement. Specific objectives were to (1) estimate fractional vegetation
    cover (fc) from multispectral images collected over the cotton field trials with
    a drone, (2) use plot-level fc to derive crop water use calculations from an ET-based
    daily soil water balance model, and (3) identify cotton cultivars with favorable
    yield, fiber quality and water use efficiency across treatments and growing seasons."'
  verbatim_quote3: '"The mixed modeling results show that the methodology used to
    estimate cotton water use and CWUE led to differences for these traits among the
    eight cultivars. Thus, the approach may have value for breeding programs that
    aim to improve CWUE and identify drought tolerant cultivars."'

    \ is considered immature and its adoption ad hoc, despite a relatively\nadvanced\
    \ technology innovation sector. In this review, we focus on the technical, governance\
    \ and\nsocial factors of digital adoption that have created a disconnect between\
    \ technology development\nand the end user community (farmers and their advisors).\
    \ Using examples that reﬂect both successes\nand barriers in Australian agriculture,\
    \ we ﬁrst explore the current enabling technologies and\nprocesses, and then we\
    \ highlight some of the key socio-technical factors that explain why digital\n\
    agriculture is immature and ad hoc. Pronounced issues include fragmentation of\
    \ the innovation\nsystem (and digital tools), and a lack of enabling legislation\
    \ and policy to support technology\ndeployment. To overcome such issues and increase\
    \ adoption, clear value propositions for\nchange are necessary. These value propositions\
    \ are inﬂuenced by the perceptions and\naspirations of individuals, the delivery\
    \ of digitally-enabled processes and the supporting\nlegislative, policy and educational\
    \ structures, better use/conversion of data generated through\ntechnology applications\
    \ to knowledge for supporting decision making, and the suitability of the\ntechnology.\
    \ Agronomists and early adopter farmers will play a signiﬁcant role in closing\
    \ the\ntechnology-end user gap, and will need support and training from technology\
    \ service providers,\ngovernment bodies and peer-networks. Ultimately, practice\
    \ change will only be achieved\nthrough mutual understanding, ownership and trust.\
    \ This will occur when farmers and their\nadvisors are an integral part of the\
    \ entire digital innovation system.\nKeywords: agricultural data, data analytics,\
    \ digital literacy, digital maturity, internet of things,\ninteroperability, precision\
    \ agriculture, remote sensing, robotics, sensors.\nIntroduction\nIt is well known\
    \ that agriculture faces enormous challenges now and in the future with the \n\
    need to feed a rapidly-growing global human population at a time of declining\
    \ arable land, \nwater and soil resources caused by ongoing environmental degradation\
    \ and climate change \n(Schneider et al. 2011; Rockström et al. 2017). Global\
    \ human population projections of \nnearly 10 billion people by 2050 will require\
    \ a 70% increase in food production \n(Kopittke et al. 2019). To meet this rapidly-growing\
    \ demand for food will require the \nsustainable intensiﬁcation of agriculture\
    \ (Rockström et al. 2017) including improving \ncrop yields, increasing agricultural\
    \ production in developing countries, improving food \ndistribution and reducing\
    \ waste (Ray et al. 2013; Shepherd et al. 2020). Digital agriculture \nis promoted\
    \ as the fourth agricultural revolution and has the potential to meet future food\
    \ \nrequirements, but is not without limitations (Barrett and Rose 2020). \nAustralian\
    \ farmers have a reputation for innovation and use of technology (Lowenberg-\n\
    DeBoer and Erickson 2019). Digital agricultural innovations are deployed in some\
    \ form or \nanother across the whole agricultural sector and some notable innovations\
    \ have originated \nfrom Australia, for example, application of soil moisture\
    \ sensors, grape yield monitoring \nand grain protein mapping (Lamb et al. 2008).\
    \ Yet the overarching state of digital \nagriculture in Australia is considered\
    \ immature and adoption ad hoc (Baker et al. 2017). \nwww.publish.csiro.au/cp\n\
    Crop & Pasture Science\nDigital maturity can be viewed as a process that converts\
    \ \nmanual tasks to digital by way of digitisation of data, \ndigitalisation of\
    \ process and ultimately, digital transforma-\ntion (Savi´c 2019). Many players\
    \ in the Australian agri-food \nvalue chain use digitised data by way of platforms\
    \ (e.g. \nsoftware applications and online decision-support tools), \nbut few\
    \ have evolved to digitalisation of process, let alone \ndigital transformation\
    \ (Skinner et al. 2017). \nAustralia agriculture has some notable diﬀerences to\
    \ \nother countries in terms of farm management, government \npriorities, the\
    \ policy environment and the climate. Dominated \nby family farming businesses,\
    \ Australian farmers tend to be \nthe decision-makers in a farming enterprise\
    \ but often rely \non advisors who are private operators (Llewellyn and \nOuzman\
    \ 2014). The Australian agricultural workforce is an \n‘aging demographic’ relative\
    \ to the general workforce (Binks \net al. 2018), while employment costs are high\
    \ compared to \nother countries (https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-\n\
    rankings/minimum-wage-by-country). Australian agriculture \noperates on commercial\
    \ principles with minimal ﬁnancial \nintervention from government and is dominated\
    \ by com-\nmodity production for an export market (Perrett et al. \n2017). Generally,\
    \ farm size and enterprise scale are large \nand human resources per hectare low,\
    \ a product of the \npositive relationship between farm size and proﬁtability\
    \ \n(Sheng and Chancellor 2019). Farm and enterprise size \nreﬂects Australia’s\
    \ geographical and geological uniqueness \nas the oldest, ﬂattest and driest permanently\
    \ inhabited \ncontinent on earth, with a principal land mass of 7.69m km2 \nand\
    \ a wide range of climate zones including tropical, arid, \ntemperate and alpine\
    \ (Beck et al. 2018). Approximately 55% \nof Australia’s landmass is used for\
    \ agricultural production, \nwith the gross value of agricultural, ﬁsheries and\
    \ forestry \nproduction increasing to AU$67billion GDP in 2019–20 \n(ABARES 2021)\
    \ including the dominant industries of red \nmeat (cattle and sheep), arable crops\
    \ and horticulture. \nAustralian agriculture, ﬁsheries and forestry sector aims\
    \ \nto achieve AU$100billion in annual farm gate output by \n2030 (DAWE 2020)\
    \ and embracing digital agriculture could \ncontribute approximately AU$20.3 billion\
    \ each year (Perrett \net al. 2017). However, achieving this uplift requires work\
    \ to \ndeliver the value proposition of digital agriculture speciﬁc to  \nAustralian\
    \ requirements (Baker et al. 2017). \nReview process and objectives\nHere we provide\
    \ a narrative about the state of digital agricul-\nture in Australia from the\
    \ perspective of increasing digital \nmaturity in Australia. This review is not\
    \ intended to be \nexhaustive and there are others that have comprehensively \n\
    reviewed a range of technical and social topics (e.g. Kamilaris \net al. 2017;\
    \ Tzounis et al. 2017; Wolfert et al. 2017; Bahlo et al. \n2019; Kirkegaard 2019;\
    \ Klerkx et al. 2019; Fielke et al. 2020; \nShepherd et al. 2020; Cook et al.\
    \ 2021; Durrant et al. 2021). \nInstead, we approach the topic from the viewpoint\
    \ of the \nhallmarks of increasing digital \nmaturity (converting \nmanual to\
    \ digital) and provide insights into bridging the \ngap between the technology\
    \ providers and end users \n(farmers and their advisors). We used an unstructured\
    \ review \nprocess, starting with the peer-review and grey literature \nwe had\
    \ from previous research, and guided by keyword \nsearches of literature (‘Australia’,\
    \ ‘digital agriculture’, ‘digital \nadoption’, ‘digital maturity’) in various\
    \ search engines, and a \n‘snowball’ approach to obtain further literature. We\
    \ combined \nour review of peer-review and grey literature with Australian \n\
    examples collated from the authors’ collective knowledge and \nexperience. We\
    \ used this information to provide an overview \nof three interlinked concepts\
    \ that inﬂuence digital adoption \nand how they combine to provide value: (1)\
    \ enabling \ntechnologies and processes (and their value); (2) governance, \n\
    and (3) the people. On this basis, we explore some key factors \nthat will help\
    \ improve the value proposition for digital \nadoption. We conclude by providing\
    \ commentary on the \nroles of agronomists, early adopter farmers and government\
    \ \norganisations in enabling technology-mediated change. \nOverview of enabling\
    \ technologies, processes\nand their value\nThere is a broad range of enabling\
    \ technologies currently \navailable to the agriculture sector (Table 1) and each\
    \ type \ndemands a range of competencies and skills, underpinned \nby both formal\
    \ and informal learning. Together these \ntechnologies can support eﬃcient and\
    \ sustainable farm \nmanagement and create value for customers, supply chains\
    \ \nand the broader community through data and information \nsharing. The following\
    \ section provides an overview of \nsome of the key enabling technologies that\
    \ have experienced \nwidespread development and deployment in Australia via the\
    \ \nresearch and commercial sectors. \nProximal sensors, robots and the internet\
    \ of\nthings\nSensing technologies and robots are underpinned by \ncyber-physical\
    \ systems (CPS) and the Internet of Things \n(IoT), which are essentially equivalent\
    \ (Greer et al. 2019). \nConnecting sensing devices through the Internet (i.e.\
    \ IoT) \nallows multi-directional sharing of data, analytics, insights \nand applications\
    \ across the network (Elijah et al. 2018; \nZhou et al. 2021). \nAustralian CPS\
    \ development and deployment research has \nfocused on grain, tree crops, wine\
    \ grapes and sugar, from the \nperspective of weed, pest and disease management,\
    \ water \nuse eﬃciency and yield forecasting (for example: Anderson \net al. 2018;\
    \ Wang et al. 2018; Brinkhoﬀ and Robson 2021). \nIoT soil moisture sensing plays\

    \ and identify fruit ﬂy in real time (Moraes \net al. 2019) and measure the eﬀectiveness\
    \ of precision \napplication of insecticide (e.g. RapidAIM 2021). \nIoT and sensor\
    \ applications in livestock are dominated by \ntracking, control and animal health\
    \ monitoring (Farooq et al. \n2019; Chang et al. 2022), which have particular\
    \ value for \ngeographically large pastoral systems (Bahlo et al. 2019). In \n\
    the dairy sector, digital deployment is characterised by \ntechnologies such as\
    \ rotary automatic milking systems \ndeveloped to meet the speciﬁc needs of Australian\
    \ milk \nharvesting (https://futuredairy.com.au/publications/). \nAutonomous harvesting\
    \ and crop manipulation robots \ncould signiﬁcantly reduce reliance on and the\
    \ cost of \nmanual labour and improve overall eﬃciency (Lowenberg-\ndeBoer et\
    \ al. 2020). Lowenberg-deBoer et al. (2020) note \nthat there is a scarcity of\
    \ research on the economics of \nrobotics technologies, when use of robotics is\
    \ likely to \nimprove the consistency and resilience of Australian supply \nchains,\
    \ which have been notably disrupted by COVID19-\nrelated labour shortages (Bulgari\
    \ et al. 2021). Outside the \ndairy industry, on-farm robotics have focused on\
    \ broadacre \ngrain and horticultural crops speciﬁcally for chemical \napplication,\
    \ weeding and harvesting (e.g. Sukkarieh 2016; \nhttps://www.swarmfarm.com/applications/).\
    \ \nDespite Australia being an early leader in the development \nand adoption\
    \ of precision agriculture (Bramley and Trengove \n2013), limitations of connectivity\
    \ technology both across and \nbetween farms has hampered widespread uptake of\
    \ IoT. Many \nremote farming enterprises must rely on satellite solutions \nwhich\
    \ oﬀer inferior data allowances and speeds, or pay to \ninstall their own infrastructure\
    \ (Lamb 2017). Several state \ngovernments have been investing in a range of initiatives\
    \ \naimed at increasing uptake of IoT, for example, New South \nWales’ Farms of\
    \ the Future program (NSW Government \n2021), Victoria’s On-farm IoT trial (State\
    \ Government of \nVictoria 2021), Western Australia’s eConnected Grainbelt \n\
    program and IoT DecisionAg grants (Government of \nWestern Australia 2021) and\
    \ South Australia’s AgTech \ndemonstration farms (Government of South Australia\
    \ 2021). \nRemote sensing\nThe cost of farm ﬁeld sampling and monitoring can be\
    \ \nprohibitive, especially at large scales and in remote locations. \nRemote\
    \ sensing is the acquisition of information about \nan object or phenomenon from\
    \ a distance and provides \nan alternative (often cheaper) means of collecting\
    \ data. \nImprovements in computing and processing power, the \nresolution of\
    \ satellite data and improved access to platforms, \nsuch as Cubesats (Akyildiz\
    \ and Kak 2019) and unmanned \naerial vehicles (UAV), have driven increasing popularity\
    \ of \nremote sensing methods for production and other land \nmanagement practices\
    \ (Scarth et al. 2019). \nIn Australia, digital agriculture has historically been\
    \ \nconstrained by limited access to, and the useability of, satellite \nimagery.\
    \ Organisations such as CSIRO have been working \nalongside Geoscience Australia\
    \ to create an Earth Observation \nData Hub that will provide ‘data cubes’ of\
    \ satellite information \nfor applications in digital agriculture (Lewis et al.\
    \ 2017). \nSeveral companies have capitalised on the availability of \nhigh spatial\
    \ and temporal resolution data from Sentinel \nsatellites (ESA 2021) and are at\
    \ the forefront of commercial \nremote sensing services, e.g. CiboLabs (CiboLabs\
    \ 2018). \nIn the current state, the data collected via remote sensing \nsystems\
    \ are often complemented by proximal sensing systems, \nsuch as handheld devices,\
    \ vehicle mounted devices or even \ncameras on smartphones (e.g. Trotter 2010).\
    \ In precision \nirrigation, for example, there are exciting possibilities of\
    \ link-\ning satellite information, weather forecasts and crop models \nwith ground-based,\
    \ spot sensing of crop canopy temperature. \nThis involves static infrared thermometers\
    \ (wireless IoT \ndevices) giving precise warnings of the need for irrigation\
    \ \nover whole farms and the consequences of delay (Bange and \nJamali 2018).\
    \ At the time of writing there was still no \nremote sensing system that can non-invasively\
    \ measure soil \nfertility, biotic stressors in crops nor diagnose animal health.\

    Crop & Pasture Science\nnew and improved ways. The pace of monitoring and \nmeasurement\
    \ in digital agriculture is leading to the \ngeneration of unprecedented volumes\
    \ of data, particularly \nin the private sector. These data require more sophisticated\
    \ \ntreatment and analyses in order to derive insights for making \nfarming decisions\
    \ (Wolfert et al. 2017). For example, while \ncropping and horticulture make a\
    \ substantial contribution \nto Australian production value (ABARES 2021), crop\
    \ \nyield forecasting is challenging due to high production, \nenvironmental and\
    \ climate variability. To address these \nforecasting challenges, increasingly\
    \ sophisticated crop mod-\nelling approaches are being used to improve certainty\
    \ for \ncropping production systems. CSIRO-developed system \nGrainCAST™ has helped\
    \ increase the accuracy of near real-\ntime wheat yield predictions (Hochman and\
    \ Horan 2019). \nThe Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) \nmodel\
    \ (Holzworth et al. 2018), also developed by CSIRO \nand a predominantly Australian\
    \ team, has seen widespread \nuptake (APSIM 2021), for example, in tools like\
    \ Yield \nProphet® which provides paddock-scale forecasts (https:// \nwww.yieldprophet.com.au/).\
    \ Remote data collection, analysis \nand visualisation oﬀers opportunities for\
    \ new supporting \nservices, but not without the challenges of disruption \n(Fielke\
    \ et al. 2020). \nThe volume of data generated in agriculture (and other \ndisciplines)\
    \ is driving the practice of ‘big data analysis’ \n(Kamilaris et al. 2017; Newton\
    \ et al. 2020). This is matched \nby increasing use of artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ (AI) and machine \nlearning (ML), and many new research programs and \ncompanies\
    \ in digital agriculture seek to utilise these \napproaches \nfor \nanalysis,\
    \ \nprediction \nand \ndecision \nmaking. Sensor/AI based microclimate forecasting\
    \ systems \n(Nolet 2018) are expected to drive productivity gains \nthrough increasing\
    \ operational eﬃciency and optimising \nresource use (see for example Baker et\
    \ al. 2017; Llewellyn \net al. 2017). Use of ML regression methods applied to\
    \ \nremote sensing data have increased the accuracy of wheat \nyield gap mapping\
    \ (Kamir et al. 2020). However, despite a \ngrowing list of reviews published\
    \ on the potential or current \nstate of AI in relation to sustainable and/or\
    \ precision \nagriculture (e.g. AgriFutures 2016; Peters et al. 2020; \nLinaza\
    \ et al. 2021), there remains a paucity of detail on the \nuse of such capability\
    \ to support decisions based upon \nbusiness rules at the farm or operational\
    \ level. This is an \nongoing impediment to actual, and impactful adoption of\
    \ \nAI/ML, not only in Australia but worldwide. \nThe way the industry engages\
    \ with digital data can be \naﬀected by the perceptions of who the end users are\
    \ \n(Fleming et al. 2018). The implementation of technologies \nto translate data\
    \ to decisions is largely the domain of the \ncommercial sector, and agricultural\
    \ technologies companies \nand their investors are at the centre of eﬀorts to\
    \ integrate \ndata sources and scale up analytics to predictive platforms \nfor\
    \ farmer decision making (Nolet 2018). \nThe role of Australian AgTech in implementing\n\
    digital technologies\nAgricultural and agri-food technology (‘AgTech’) companies\
    \  \nplay an important role in customising enabling technology, \ndeveloped through\
    \ research, to digital solutions for producers. \nAs such, AgTech is expected\
    \ to continue to grow as a domain \nand support achieving (and surpassing) the\
    \ $100b target for \nthe sector (Baker et al. 2017). \nAgTech research is strong\
    \ in Australia and Australian \ninnovators producing world-leading digital technologies\
    \ \n(Hudson and Wood 2017; Nolet 2018). Some of the leading \nexamples are direct\
    \ from the research sector, like CSIRO \n(virtual fencing, Cerestag) and the University\
    \ of Sydney \n(Australian Centre for Field Robotics), with products \nand services\
    \ that have subsequently been commercialised \n(Campbell et al. 2021; Aquilani\
    \ et al. 2022). Other \nexamples come from the corporate and farming sectors (e.g.\
    \ \nFarmbot, Pairtree and Farmers2Founders). The Australian \nAgritech Association\
    \ (ausagritech.org) and AgTech Finder \n(agtechﬁnder.com) are intended to help\
    \ expose and link the \ntechnology industry to end users. \nUnlike countries like\
    \ the United States of America that \nhave invested heavily in AgTech development,\
    \ Australia \nlags in investment despite an expanding AgTech industry \nand a\
    \ doubling in size of Australia’s venture capital \nmarket between 2016 and 2017\
    \ (Maughan et al. 2018; \nNolet 2018). This lag reﬂects a disconnect between the\
    \ \nexpectations of Australian farmers and technology compa-\nnies in terms of\
    \ the perceived value of technology \n(Nolet 2018). This disconnect has resulted\
    \ in many AgTech \ntools being developed without a good understanding of the \n\
    needs of the next-(advisors) and end-users (farmer), which \ncan diﬀer. This is\
    \ a signiﬁcant problem for the Australian \nAgTech industry with a myriad of digital\
    \ solutions \navailable that are largely isolated and lack the socio-\ntechnical\
    \ \nfoundations \nto \nmake \nthem \ninteroperable \n(Nolet 2018). \nThe value\
    \ of digital solutions\nThe pace of digital innovation and deployment in agriculture\
    \ \nis overwhelming. It is clear that some technologies will \nbe greatly beneﬁcial\
    \ for end users, particularly given the \nunpredictable nature of climate and\
    \ markets in Australia. \nExport market demands, consumer expectations in relation\
    \ \nto sustainability and traceability, and COVID-19 pandemic \nimpacts on supply\
    \ chains and labour all add increasing \npressure on Australian food production\
    \ to improve processes \nand eﬃciencies (Snow et al. 2021). Digital agriculture\
    \ is well \nplaced to help address these challenges and even solve \nsome, for\
    \ example, increased digital maturity in Queensland \nsugarcane farming has improved\
    \ water use eﬃciency as well \nas making labour and cost savings (Fig. 1). However,\

    \ a case study\nfarm on the Burdekin River in Far North Queensland, which was\
    \ used for sugarcane production. The conversion of the farming operation to\n\
    an automated furrow irrigation system ultimately resulted in labour savings (farmer\
    \ time), cost savings (reduced water tariffs), and yield\nimprovements. This presents\
    \ a strong value proposition for adopting digital transformation in other similar\
    \ enterprises. Figured created\nbased on material in Leonard (2019) and Wang et\
    \ al. (2019). O&M, operations and maintenance.\ntechnical expertise required,\
    \ insuﬃcient technical support, \ntrust, inequality and regulatory lags (Fielke\
    \ et al. 2019) \n(Table 1). \nMaturity encapsulates a number of elements: strategic\
    \ \nleadership, governance, technology, availability and use of \ndata and the\
    \ digital capability of users in the agricultural \nsector (Baker et al. 2017).\
    \ These elements are interrelated \nsuch that low maturity in one factor can limit\
    \ all others; \ntherefore, all elements are considered necessary to inﬂuence \n\
    the value proposition of digital agriculture (Leonard 2022). \nFor example, connectivity\
    \ is a key enabling technology \nfor digital agriculture. The value of many digital\
    \ solutions \nrelies on adequate network connectivity and poor connec-\ntivity\
    \ in Australia diminishes the value of deploying \nsensor networks in remote rural\
    \ areas. In a survey of 1000 \nAustralian farmers (Lamb 2017), of those who owned\
    \ \nsensor networks, more than 75% of them rated their \nnetworks as moderately\
    \ to extremely challenging to \nmaintain. This type of overarching issue will\
    \ require \nexternal drivers such as legislation or consumer demand to \naddress\
    \ and accelerate digital uptake (Klerkx et al. 2019). \nWhere potential adverse\
    \ impacts outweigh the relative \nbeneﬁt of digital solutions, the case for adoption\
    \ is likely \nto be weak. \nGovernance and people\nGovernance and legislation\n\
    Governance structures and processes are essential for provid-\ning certainty in\
    \ the sector to invest in and adopt digital \ntechnologies (Wiseman et al. 2019).\
    \ However, Australia \nlags in providing appropriate regulation and governance\
    \ \nframeworks for the sector, and there is little government \nguidance for responsible\
    \ development and deployment of \ndigital innovations (Fielke et al. 2019). \n\
    Data is a key area for improvement across the sector. In the \nUnited States of\
    \ America, the Department of Agriculture \n(USDA) facilitates access to a wide\
    \ range of data and \ninformation for entrepreneurs and researchers to develop\
    \ \ntechnologies upon (Keogh and Henry 2016). Australia has \ninstead focused\
    \ on mechanisms to provide more certainty \naround data exchange and access via\
    \ industry bodies, \nfor example, the National Farmers Federation Farm Data \n\
    Code (NFF 2020b) and the Get Australia Growing strategy \n(NFF 2020c), but has\
    \ so far failed to provide appropriate \nregulatory standards for many parts of\
    \ the industry. \nGovernance for data ownership, use of robots on public \nroads\
    \ and animal welfare approval for virtual fencing all \nremain at an immature\
    \ stage, with some issues dealt with \n530\nwww.publish.csiro.au/cp\nCrop & Pasture\
    \ Science\ndiﬀerently between states (NSW Farmers 2022). This problem \nis not\
    \ peculiar to Australia, for example, regulation in cellular \nagriculture lags\
    \ behind technology innovation, which is \neﬀectively acting as barrier to developing\
    \ alternative innova-\ntion pathways (Chiles et al. 2021). The recent announcement\
    \ \nof the Australian Agrifood Data Exchange (www.integrity \nsystems.com.au/ozdata),\
    \ has been met with mixed responses \nfrom the farming sector (www.abc.net.au/news/rural/\
    \ \nprograms/landline/2022-02-20/data-doubts:-harvesting-big-\ndata-from-farmers/13762796)\
    \ partly because of the lack of \ngovernment regulation in relation to consumer\
    \ data laws \nand mistrust in how farm data are used (Zhang et al. 2021). \nPeople\n\
    In Australia, digital maturity and thus, digital adoption in \ngeneral remains\
    \ low (Baker et al. 2017). Motivation to \nadopt digital technologies will be\
    \ limited by the time \nrequired to select, and skills to implement, appropriate\
    \ \ndigital technology (Ayre et al. 2019). Trust associated with \nreliability\
    \ of technology, and ownership and use of data \npresent additional barriers (Baker\
    \ et al. 2017). Adoption \ntheory is littered with examples of the human elements\
    \ of \ninnovativeness and social inﬂuence helping or hindering \nadoption. This\
    \ is speciﬁcally true for family farming \nbusinesses where utility is found to\
    \ be a greater driver of \nchange than proﬁt (Leonard 2022). Yet the characteristics\
    \ \nof the technology only become relevant once the decision \nto adopt has commenced\
    \ as attitude to change and external \nsupport for change are most inﬂuential\
    \ (Streuer 2020). \nEstablishing robust measures of agricultural adoption is \n\
    limited by a lack of comprehensive models (Montes de Oca \nMunguia et al. 2021).\
    \ Of those that exist the ADOPT model \n(Kuehne et al. 2017) is highly regarded\
    \ in Australia as it \nconsiders the individual’s attitude to a new technology\
    \ in \nrelation to an established or incumbent technology. However, \nthe ADOPT\
    \ model is weak when measuring attitude to the \nuse of data. As data use is pivotal\
    \ to the use of technologies, \nthe ADOPT model fails to distinguish between the\
    \ uptake of a \nprecision versus a digital technology. Beyond the quantitative\
    \ \napproach oﬀered by the ADOPT model, there are few studies \nthat have quantiﬁed\
    \ adoption (but see Zhang et al. 2017; \nBramley and Ouzman 2019). Where adoption\
    \ measures are \nspeciﬁed they include examples like greater collection/use \n\
    of more data types, use of modelling products and software \nsolutions for decision\
    \ making, the installation and use of \nsensors and technology infrastructure\
    \ on farming enterprises, \nand use of software solutions in irrigation cotton\
    \ growing \n(Baker et al. 2017; Ayre et al. 2019; Cook et al. 2021). We \nconsider\
    \ adoption here in terms of uptake of digital tools \nby next- and end-users,\
    \ and generation/use/sharing of data \n(and by inference, investment from various\
    \ parts of the \nsector in shifting to digital solutions over analogue), \nalthough\
    \ we do not attempt to quantify it. \nImproving the value proposition for digitial\n\
    agriculture in Australia\nThe success of agricultural technology innovation to\
    \ drive \nsector-wide change hinges on next- and end-user adoption \n(Shepherd\
    \ et al. 2020), which in itself depends most strongly \non the value proposition\
    \ presented by the technology and the \ndigital maturity of the sector to engage\
    \ with technology \ninnovations (Annosi et al. 2020; Ball et al. 2021). To \n\
    increase digital maturity will require a range of simultaneous \nstrategies (Kirkegaard\
    \ 2019), focused primarily on closing the \ngap between the technology development\
    \ and end users. At \nthe same time there need to be improvements to support-\n\
    ing legislation and education, knowledge brokering and \nexchange, conversion\
    \ of data to decisions, and to the \nenabling technologies themselves. \nClosing\
    \ the gap: individual perceptions and the\nsuitability of technology\nMany digital\
    \ solutions are immature and not always ﬁt for \npurpose because of a disconnect\
    \ between developers and \nusers. Individual users perceive and interact with\
    \ technology \ndiﬀerently and therefore, technology adoption needs to \naddress\
    \ cognitive, emotional and contextual concerns \n(Straub 2009). The value proposition\
    \ is often expressed as a \nﬁnancial beneﬁt. In reality, users adopt when there\
    \ is a \nneed, and that need is serviced by a technology that is easy \nto use\
    \ and provides a cost beneﬁt. Yet, technologies such as \nmobile phones, internet\
    \ banking and autosteer primarily \noﬀer utility, which may or may not provide\
    \ a ﬁnancial \nreturn (Leonard 2022). Within family farming businesses \ndigital\
    \ capability and aspirations can diverge, therefore \nunderstanding the demands\
    \ of all individuals and their \npotential to inﬂuence a business’s purchasing\
    \ and adoption \ndecision is vital to achieve change. The value is tightly \n\
    entwined with users’ personal perceptions, goals and \npriorities (Leonard 2022).\
    \ \nPeople, not the technology, are at the heart of digital \nagriculture adoption,\
    \ but technology providers tend to \nfocus on promoting the functions and applications\
    \ of the \ntechnology (Leonard 2022). The ongoing failure to unlock \nthe value\
    \ proposition of digital agriculture is considered to \nbe due to digital solutions\
    \ being oﬀered at a task level, \nrather than a process level, and failure to\
    \ align digital \nsolutions with human inﬂuences on adoption (Leonard \n2022).\
    \ Technology developers need to work directly with \nend users using a co-design\
    \ process (Ayre et al. 2019; \nStitzlein et al. 2020). This helps reduce the time\
    \ and cost \nrequired to set up and use a new digital practice, builds end \n\
    user conﬁdence in the technology and their skills to operate \nit, and establishes\
    \ systems to place full control of the data \nwith the end users (Streuer 2020).\
    \ To support on-farm \ndigital change, co-design approaches need to bring together\
    \ \nall members of the family, farm and support team of the \n531\nB. D. Hansen\
    \ et al.\nCrop & Pasture Science\nbusiness to capitalise on skills and knowledge\
    \ (Leonard \n2022). This will be essential to break down the digital \ndivide\
    \ and help remove barriers to the communication of \nclear value propositions\
    \ (Lamb 2017). \nDelivery of supporting legislation and education\nA long-term\
    \ strategy is needed for the Australian agriculture \nsector that generates conﬁdence\
    \ in farmers to invest in digital \nsolutions and recognise value in the digital\
    \ opportunities for \nthe sector (see also Fielke et al. 2019). High priorities\
    \ for \nnational legislation are the creation of regulations around \nfarmer data\
    \ rights, the use of robotics and animal welfare \nimplications of remote management\
    \ methods, e.g. virtual \nfencing and sensors for health monitoring. New and existing\
    \ \nregulations require improved enforcement and compliance \nmonitoring (e.g.\
    \ drones; Commonwealth of Australia 2020). \nFurthermore, diﬀerences between state\
    \ legislation need to \nbe reconciled with stronger leadership from the Australian\
    \ \nnational government (a problem which plagues other \nsectors, e.g. environmental\
    \ legislation: Hamman et al. 2021). \nStronger oversight of the agricultural knowledge\
    \ and \nadvice network, which is mostly privatised and lacks \nregulation, is\
    \ required (Fleming et al. 2021). There is a \ncrucial need for developing skills\
    \ and knowledge in end \nusers to engage with data and available digital platforms.\
    \ \nPolicy-driven education and skills training play a role in \nmeeting this\
    \ need and should be supported and expanded, \nfor example, through government\
    \ initiatives like AgSkilled \n2.0 which is being rolled out by the NSW State\
    \ Government. \nTAFE/University courses, advisor accreditation and in-person \n\
    training programs are recommended as mechanisms to \naddress awareness and knowledge\
    \ gaps in the sector (NFF \n2020a). Government policy guidance on responsible\
    \ digital \nagricultural innovations for the sector is also needed (Ayre \net\
    \ al. 2019; Fielke et al. 2019), and could be linked to and \nused in conjunction\
    \ with commercial solutions like digital \ndirectories (e.g. AgTech Finder). \n\
    Knowledge brokering/exchange\nKnowledge and advice networks will be essential\
    \ to diﬀusing \ndigital innovations across the sector (Ayre et al. 2019; \nFielke\
    \ et al. 2020). This centres around several approaches: \nworkforce integrated\
    \ learning and training, building and \nsupporting social networks, smart farm\
    \ demonstrations, and \nwell-evidenced case studies. Government and corporate\
    \ \norganisations need to support the creation of a workforce \nof digital agriculture\
    \ professionals with relevant domain \nexpertise, and support social agricultural\
    \ networks for \nknowledge exchange and upskilling, for example, grower \ngroups\
    \ like North Australia Beef Research Council and Birchip \nCropping Group (e.g.\
    \ Anil et al. 2015). Social networks \nwill help lift the capabilities of people\
    \ of all genders \nin businesses, as they may activate practice change in \ndiﬀerent\
    \ ways (e.g. in livestock production rural women \nuse most components of technology\
    \ three times more often \nthan men: Hay and Pearce 2014). Social networks will\
    \ \nalso help facilitate participatory technology design (Stitzlein \net al. 2020).\
    \ Building and supporting citizen science \ninitiatives provides an alternative\
    \ and under-utilised avenue, \nnot only for collecting data, but also for encouraging\
    \ \nknowledge exchange between diﬀerent stakeholders across \nthe value chain\
    \ (e.g. Ryan et al. 2018). Strengthening \nlinkages between farmers, agronomists\
    \ and knowledge \nproviders (Rijswijk et al. 2019) and the promotion of key \n\
    inﬂuencers, opinion leaders and experienced farm advisors \ncreates an information\
    \ rich environment, which will help \nsustain and expand farming networks. \n\
    Farmers generally prioritise learning from their peers and \nin-person events\
    \ (NFF 2020a). Given that many farmers \nprefer to be provided with practical\
    \ facts in a logical \nsequence rather than lots of information (Nicholson et\
    \ al. \n2015), ﬁeld days, demonstration and smart farms play an \nimportant role\
    \ in increasing farmer awareness, knowledge \nand skills, and exposing the economic\
    \ value propositions \nthrough well-evidenced use of technology (Ayre et al. 2019).\
    \ \nDemonstration farms help test and de-risk the practical \nimplementation of\
    \ new agriculture technology for farmers, \nas they can learn from others’ mistakes\
    \ and understand the \nreturn on investment. \nBetter data, access and interoperability\
    \ of digital\nsystems\nAccess to, and custodianship of data is both a barrier\
    \ and \nenabler of digital adoption (and farming productivity more \ngenerally:\
    \ NFF 2020a). A fundamental issue for digital \nagriculture is whether the necessary\
    \ data exist and are ﬁt-\nfor-purpose, and how to access these data to inform\
    \ and \nimprove decision making (Darnell et al. 2018; Durrant et al. \n2021).\
    \ All elements of data (standards, storage, exchange, \nsecurity and conversion\
    \ to information products) need \nto be aligned to build conﬁdence in stakeholders\
    \ and end \nusers to engage in digital agriculture (Bahlo et al. 2019). \nEarly\
    \ steps to achieve this are development of policies for \ndata \nuse \n(nﬀ.org.au/programs/australian-farm-data-code\
    \ \nand www.farmdatacode.org.nz) and autonomous machinery \n(Grain Producers Australia\
    \ (GPA), Tractor and Machinery \nAssociation (TMA) and the Society of Precision\
    \ Agriculture \nAustralia (SPAA) 2021). \nData sharing practices that aim for\
    \ greater interoperability \nof data systems with clear governance and stewardship\
    \ \narrangements should be the focus for future development of \nthe agricultural\
    \ data sector (Box et al. 2015). Open data \nexchange systems, data cooperatives\
    \ and data trusts will \nneed to have technical and legal mechanisms to ensure\
    \ the \ndata provider (farmer or other party) retains full control of \naccess\
    \ to their data, regardless of where those data are \nhosted (Box et al. 2015;\
    \ Jouanjean et al. 2020; Agricultural \n532\nwww.publish.csiro.au/cp\nCrop & Pasture\
    \ Science\nResearch Federation 2021; Durrant et al. 2021). Data supply \nchain\
    \ infrastructure should be underpinned by semantic and \nsyntactic web technologies,\
    \ distributed ledger technologies, \nand privacy preserving technologies (Durrant\
    \ et al. 2021), \nwith dataset access linked to electronic licences, smart \n\
    contracts and data sharing agreements. Even greater \ncertainty for data custodians\
    \ is provided via analytical \nprocesses and systems that do not require local\
    \ copies of \ndata (e.g. federated learning: Zhou et al. 2021). Deployment \n\
    of multi-stakeholder cooperative models (e.g. Cultured Meat \nModelling Consortium\
    \ for cellular agriculture innovation: \nChiles et al. 2021) would have multiple\
    \ beneﬁts in terms of \naddressing data control and privacy concerns of custodians,\
    \ \nbut also brokering knowledge and advice on appropriate \napplication of digital\
    \ innovations. \nAcross all sectors there is increasing recognition that \ndata\
    \ should be FAIR: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable \nand Reusable, in order\
    \ to increase eﬃciencies in conversion \nof data to knowledge for end users (Wilkinson\
    \ et al. 2016). \nThis is an ambitious but necessary goal for the agri-foods \n\
    sector to maximise value from vast quantities of (often) \ndisparate data being\
    \ collected (Darnell et al. 2018) and \nensure data are analysis-ready. Without\
    \ better access to ﬁt-\nfor-purpose data and the insights from data to inform\
    \ farming \ndecision making, it will be very diﬃcult to demonstrate the \nvalue\
    \ proposition for agricultural data sharing between \nmany actors. \nImprovements\
    \ to enabling technologies\nOne fundamental reason for using technology in agriculture\
    \ \n(e.g. IoT) is to sense or collect information about phenomena \nin an attempt\
    \ to create a deeper understanding of the full \nagricultural system. Doing so\
    \ aims to move away from \nreactive responses/systems and toward proactive, predictive\
    \ \nand prescriptive systems for supporting decision making \n(Zhou et al. 2021).\
    \ Therefore, improving the design of \ncyber-physical systems (CPS) and the underlying\
    \ sensing \ntechnology that generate data will be necessary to help \nfarmers\
    \ achieve eﬃciencies and production growth at scale. \nDeveloping and deploying\
    \ new sensing technologies and \nCPS suitable for Australian agriculture, particularly\
    \ large-\nscale farms with remote connectivity (Jawad et al. 2017), will \nneed\
    \ to focus on solutions for power, sensing, connectivity \nand security. \nNew\
    \ power-related technologies that will enhance existing \nsensor usage and enable\
    \ new uses include hybrid energy \nstorage (Ongaro et al. 2012), ambient energy\
    \ scavenging \n(Kim et al. 2014) and simultaneous wireless information and \n\
    power transfer (SWIPT) (Zhang and Ho 2013). Conversion \nof freely available ambient\
    \ radio frequency (RF) energy \n(e.g. solar, wind, thermal) to electricity oﬀers\
    \ a novel and \nsustainable approach for recharging super capacitors \n(Collado\
    \ and Georgiadis 2013). This can be achieved by \ncombining antennas and rectifying\
    \ circuits to create a \nrectifying antenna (rectenna), which harvest RF energy\
    \ \nfrom a focused beam (wireless power transfer) and ambient \nenergy sources\
    \ (Shariati et al. 2015). This is a matter of \nparamount importance for autonomous\
    \ systems in remote \nor climatically-harsh areas where accessibility for servicing\
    \ \nand data retrieval is a problem. Ultimately, this technique \ncan introduce\
    \ more robust and trusted autonomous \nmonitoring systems (Shariati et al. 2015;\
    \ Keshavarz and \nShariati 2021) than otherwise possible. \nEnhancement of sensing\
    \ technology will require research \ninto metamaterial-based and multi-band-based\
    \ RF sensing \ntechnology, synthetic and indirect sensing and calibration \n(Amiri\
    \ et al. 2020). The fundamental need to get data from \nsensors and where those\
    \ data are destined, which is typically \nthe cloud, ultimately requires internet\
    \ connectivity. From a \ntechnology improvement perspective, advanced antenna\
    \ \ndesign can lower the cost and enhance long range communica-\ntion while enabling\
    \ greater system integration beyond the use \nof oﬀ-the-shelf antenna technology.\
    \ As systems supported by \nIoT technologies present several attack vectors e.g.\
    \ biosecurity, \ndata security, and cyber-physical system security (sensing and\
    \ \nactuation), these vectors need to be addressed and continually \nnegated to\
    \ not only protect economic success but to ensure \n‘Brand Australia’ safety (Zhou\
    \ et al. 2021). \nClosing remarks\nIncreasing digital maturity and adoption in\
    \ Australian \nagriculture heavily relies on the knowledge brokering role \nof\
    \ agronomists and early adopters, supported by industry \norganisations that are\
    \ themselves supported by government \n(e.g. Agrifutures, National Farmers Federation),\
    \ rather than \ndirectly by government. Agronomists are generally in a \nbetter\
    \ position to invest time in understanding how the \ntechnology works and the\
    \ value proposition it will provide, \nas it will help improve their existing\
    \ client service. \nAgronomists are seen as trusted, key actors, in educating\
    \ \nthe broader farming community on digital maturity and \nadoption. Therefore,\
    \ despite the current trend of corporate-\nlevel digital transformation, in order\
    \ to get grass-roots \ntraction in Australia, knowledge transfer remains critical,\
    \ \nand digital systems and tools need to provide personalised \nadvice and come\
    \ with ongoing technical support to \nagronomists and farm management consultants.\
    \ Ultimately, \npractice change will only be achieved when researchers, \ntechnology\
    \ developers and suppliers, farmers and their \nadvisors collaborate across the\
    \ entire digital innovation \nsystem. \nReferences\nABARES (2021) ‘Snapshot of\

    reliable and valuable information, but may have minor limitations in scope, depth,
    or recency. While the paper provides a comprehensive model for integrated water
    quantity and quality allocation, it focuses on a specific reach of the Yellow

    SLIDE identification and control, integrated allocation model, synergetic coupling,
    water quality and quantity, Yellow River INTRODUCTION Listen Water quantity and
    quality are two basic attributes of water resources, and they belong to an interdependent
    unity. With the growth of population, economic and social development, the increasing
    demand of water resources and the increase of sewage discharge, the double pressure
    of water quality and quantity is increasing, and the integrated allocation of
    quantity and quality has become a hot issue in the current research field (Wang
    et al. 2013). Globally speaking, research on river water quantity and quality
    is limited by many factors, and research findings on the integrated regulation
    of water quantity and quality are few (Shokri et al. 2014). There are few studies
    on the joint allocation of water quantity, quality and water shortage. The main
    research works focus on the impact of water quality on the process of water resources
    allocation, or use water quality as a constraint to develop water resources allocation
    schemes (Dong et al. 2009; Peng et al. 2015). The key technology of integrated
    water quality and quantity research is to establish an integrated allocation model.
    The regulation objectives of an integrated allocation model of water quantity
    and quality include: water allocation, pollution control and water ecological
    protection. The model can be divided into three categories according to the purpose
    of solving problems: (1) a model for joint optimal regulation of water quantity
    and quality with reservoir optimal operation as central (Nikoo et al. 2014); (2)
    a model based on a carrying capacity assessment of the ecological environment
    system of a river network, and taking the simulation of water quantity and quality
    of the river network as central (Chen et al. 2014a, 2014b); (3) a model focusing
    on the hydrological environment effect of rivers under the control of sluice dams,
    and the regulation and control of sluice dams on polluted rivers (Liu et al. 2014).
    From the view point of modeling method, the current joint allocation of water
    quality and quantity can achieve the goal of water quality and quantity control
    through water quality and quantity joint simulation models. ‘Loose coupling’ is
    widely used in coupling technology (Zhao et al. 2012), i.e. the separation of
    the water quality and quantity model, and the realization of water quantity and
    quality simulation in turn, ignoring the relation and interaction between water
    quality and quantity. Control technology generally simplifies the water quality
    target as a constraint, and lacks process coordination within the model, which
    does not consider real-time feedback and on-line identification function. Therefore,
    most models only solve the problem of water quality effect evaluation of river
    water allocation and do not realize the integrated allocation of water quantity
    and quality. The Yellow River is short of water resources, the contradiction between
    water supply and demand is prominent, and water pollution is serious. At present,
    research on Yellow River regulation mainly focuses on flood control, silt reduction,
    water supply and power generation. For the study of water quality, it is based
    on the ability to absorb pollution and the law of pollutant transformation. It
    mostly aims at a single problem such as water regulation, capacity assessment,
    or water quality evaluation and so on. Study on the integration of water quantity
    and quality is still at the stage of comprehensive evaluation (Lyu et al. 2013).
    The research methods and means of water resources integration allocation need
    to be deepened. Therefore, taking the Lanzhou to Hekouzhen reach as an example,
    by means of systematic generalization and supported by numerical simulation, a
    model of integrated allocation of water quantity and quality is established, and
    the water allocation scheme is optimally put forward. GENERALIZATION OF TYPICAL
    REACH General situation of the reach Listen The soil and water resources distribution
    in the Yellow River Basin is uneven. The main water production area is located
    above the Lanzhou section, and the runoff discharge at the Lanzhou section accounts
    for 62% of the total runoff of the Yellow River. The reach from Lanzhou to Hekouzhen
    is 1,362 km long. It spans Gansu, Ningxia and Inner Mongolia provinces and regions.
    It belongs to arid and semi-arid areas with less water production. The average
    annual water consumption of the reach accounts for 41% of the total water use
    in the Yellow River Basin, and the discharge of waste water accounts for 32%.
    It is the main water resource consuming area and pollutant source area of the
    Yellow River, and the water quantity and quality problems are prominent. The Longyang
    Gorge, Liujiaxia and other large reservoirs have been built in the upper reaches
    of the Yellow River, with a regulation capacity of more than 200.0 × 108m3, which
    has the basic conditions for carrying out the integrated regulation of water quantity
    and quality. Generalization of the reach Listen The calculation is carried out
    according to different sections. The main engineering nodes, control nodes and
    system elements such as water supply and drainage are expressed by generalized
    ‘point’ and ‘line’ elements, and the system network node diagram describing the
    hydraulic connection of the watershed is drawn, which is used as the basis of
    simulation and calculation. In order to ensure the simulation accuracy of the
    model, the river reach generalization and node division could follow five principles:
    reflecting the characteristics of river flow and sewage production; reflecting
    the hydraulic connection and the process of movement transformation; reflecting
    the taking and using of drainage characteristics; reflecting the engineering conditions
    of the reach; and reflecting the water quality and quantity requirements of the
    reach. According to the investigation, there are 23 water intake outlets, 44 drainage
    outlets, three tributaries and 20 hydrological and water quality monitoring stations
    from Lanzhou to Hekouzhen section. The river reach water system is generalized
    into ten basic nodes of runoff, confluence, power station, reservoir, urban water
    use, agricultural irrigation, runoff control, wetland, hydrological station and
    water quality monitoring station. The generalized network nodes of the river reach
    water system are summarized in Figure 1. Figure 1 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Generalized
    nodes of the reach from Lanzhou to Hekouzhen of the Yellow River. INTEGRATED ALLOCATION
    MODEL CONSTRUCTION OF WATER QUANTITY AND QUALITY Water quantity model Listen Based
    on the hydraulic connection of the nodes and the evolution, transformation and
    balance of river flow, a water allocation model with network technology as the
    core is established to simulate the response of the river water resources system
    under different allocation strategies of water resources (Lee et al. 2010). Construction
    of water quantity model Listen Aiming at the minimum water shortage and reasonable
    distribution of water in the reach of the river, the main purpose is to solve
    the problem of the spatial–temporal equilibrium of water volume and water allocation
    in different water demand departments. When the water supply cannot meet the water
    demand, the spatial–temporal distribution of water is optimized through reasonable
    allocation, to increase the system water supply and realize the minimum water
    shortage and reasonable water distribution. The objective function is as follows:
    (1) in which QD(i, j, t), QS(i, j, t) (m3/s) denote the water demand and water
    intake of the j water user in area i during the t time period, respectively. W
    is the water shortage, (m3); I is the total number of provinces and regions, J
    is the total number of water users and T is the total number of time periods.
    In order to meet the water demand of the ecological environment in a river channel,
    it is necessary for the river to maintain a certain amount of ecological environmental
    discharge. This is characterized by the water demand satisfaction degree E of
    the ecological environment of the section. (2) in which E is the water demand
    satisfaction degree of the river ecological environment, and the larger the value,
    the higher the satisfaction degree of river ecological water demand will be; QR(x,
    t) (m3/s), De(x, t) (m3) is the section discharge and ecological environmental
    water demand of the river channel in t time period and x river reach respectively;
    ϕx is the weight coefficient of the reach; X is the total number of river reaches.
    Constraints Listen The purpose of setting up the constraints of the water quantity
    model is to realize the simulation of the environment and the operation boundary.
    Here, the unit of Q is m3/s. Discharge constraint Listen To ensure river function
    and meet section discharge requirements. (3) Engineering constraint Listen Water
    supply amount of the water source project does not exceed its water supply capacity.
    (4) Output constraint Listen The hydropower station should meet the requirement
    of system output (Qian et al. 2013). (5) Safety constraint Listen Safety requirements
    for reservoir operation. (6) Water balance constraint Listen (7) Water available
    constraint Listen The total water consumption in the region is less than the water
    distribution index in this region (Peng et al. 2013). (8) Variables non-negative
    constraint Listen In which QR(x, t) is the discharge in the t period of the x
    reach; Qmin(x,t) is the minimum discharge demand of the reach; QM(m, t) is the
    water intake in the m project of t period; Qp.max(m) is the maximum water intake
    capacity; N(n, t) is the output of reservoir n in t period; Nmin(n) is the minimum
    output of installed units in reservoir n; Nmax(n) is installed capacity; V(n,
    t) is the storage capacity of n reservoir during t period; Vmin(n) is for dead
    storage; Vmax(n,t) is the maximum allowable reservoir capacity in t period; QR(x
    − 1, t) is the runoff in t period of the upper reach x; QRn(x, t) is interval
    inflow in t period of reach x; QSx(x, t) is water intake in t period of reach
    x; QL(x, t) is water loss in t period of reach x; QT(x − 1, t) is the channel
    receding water in t period in the upper reaches; Qcon(i) is the annual water consumption
    in i region; QY(i) is the index of water allocation in i area. Water quality model
    Listen Based on the simulation of pollutant migration and transformation in river
    channels and the control goal of water quality in the water function areas, a
    water quality model with numerical simulation as the core is established to simulate
    the river environmental effects under different water resource allocation and
    pollutant discharge scenarios. Construction of water quality model Listen In order
    to meet the requirement of water quality in the water function areas, the model
    was established with the aim of minimum deviation between water quality index
    and target water quality index (Razmkhah et al. 2010). (9) in which θj is the
    weight coefficient of water quality in reach j; Cob is the target water quality
    control index in the water function areas; is the water quality index function
    under water intake ⁠. Boundary condition treatment Lateral inflow Listen This
    mainly includes three categories. (1) Tributary inflow. Runoff and pollutant concentration
    can be calculated with long-term observation data. (2) Sewage discharged to the
    river channel. Regular monitoring of discharges and emission concentrations. (3)
    Interval surface inflow. Inflow and pollutant concentration are calculated by
    using a distributed model. There is no underground water inflow because the river
    bed is higher than the surface land outside the river. The mass of the lateral
    pollutants entering the equilibrium region can be expressed as follows (Tang et
    al. 2014): (10) in which m1t is the mass of pollutants from lateral inflow; QRu(l,
    t) is the inflow at the I lateral entry point in the x reach; Clt is the pollutant
    concentration at the I entry point; and L is the total inflow reaches. Boundary
    outflow Listen This mainly refers to the amount of water (agricultural, industrial,
    living water use) taken from the section, which is generalized as the intake node
    with spatial coordinates, and the pollutant concentration of the water intake
    is deduced according to the water quality model. The quality of the extraction
    pollutant is related to the quantity of water intake and the concentration of
    the pollutant. The pollutant mass of the water intake can be expressed as follows:
    (11) in which m2t is the mass of water intake pollutants; Cijt is the pollutant
    concentration for the j user, t period and in i area; Qs(i, j, t) is the water
    intake for the j user, t period and in i area; and I, J is the total number of
    water users and regions in the reach, respectively. Considering the degradation
    of pollutants, discharge of pollutants along the river and water intake, a model
    of river water quality is established according to the principle of material balance
    (Yang et al. 2014). (12) in which Cx-1 is the pollutant concentration at time
    t above the cross-section x; Z is the length between the upper and lower section;
    Kp is the degradation coefficient of pollutant p; Zl is the length between the
    section x and the l lateral inflow; u is the flow velocity of the reach, there
    being a nonlinear relationship between the flow velocity and the flow rate; and
    the other symbols have the same meaning as above. Model coupling and control Listen
    Joint control of water quantity and quality is the basis of integrated allocation,
    and data transmission, coupling and coordination are the key to realizing joint
    control. Using decomposition, coordination, coupling and control methods, the
    model is decomposed into water quantity model M1 and water quality model M2. The
    function of M1 is to calculate reservoir operation, water evolution, water distribution
    and section water balance in the reach, and output discharge from the section
    and nodes will be used as the basic input of M2. Based on the output of M1, M2
    simulates the process of pollutant transfer and transformation and gives feedback
    to M1 on the concentration of pollutants. The real time connection between the
    two models is established by means of data transfer, and the synchronous coupling
    of the two models is realized. The coordinated control model M0 is used to identify
    the water intake, the discharge under the section and the water quality of the
    water function areas output by the water quantity model. According to the satisfaction
    degree of the system information identification control target, Model M0 gives
    feedback to M1 and M2 on the target deviation of water quantity and quality allocation
    according to the satisfaction degree of the control target of system information
    identification, and controls the direction of adjustment and correction to guide
    the model to be optimized step by step. The composition of the model is shown
    in Table 1. Table 1 Model composition of integrated water quality and quantity

    following measures: cross-section water intake control, cross-section discharge
    control, taking the water quality of the water function areas as identification
    control variables, the top-down forward calculation of water quality and the reverse
    control of water quality from bottom to top, on-line adjustment, rolling correction
    of water amount and pollutants into the river, etc. being carried out. The model
    framework and control flow are shown in Figure 2. Figure 2 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD
    SLIDE Model framework and control process. Forward calculus Listen According to
    the water requirement of the section below the Liujiaxia Reservoir, water inflow
    and water loss between sections, the initial operation line of the Longyangxia
    Reservoir and the Liujiaxia Reservoir is preliminarily determined. Discharge is
    carried out according to preset flow. The water evolution is carried out at intervals
    of one hour and river reach by reach. Reverse control Listen The reverse calculation
    is carried out to determine the minimum discharge of the reservoir. Taking the
    requirement of water intake, cross-section discharge and water quality index as
    the control condition, when the result output does not meet the control condition,
    the discharge under Longyangxia Reservoir and Liujiaxia Reservoir is automatically
    changed to recalculate the discharge, so as to iterate calculation until the section
    discharge and water quality meet the requirements (Zhang et al. 2011). Process
    adjustment Listen To identify the water intake, the section discharge and the
    water quality parameters of the water function areas, if the outputs are not satisfied,
    then, coordinate the control to reduce the amount of water intake and the amount
    of pollutants entering the river in a discounted proportion; if it is still not
    satisfied, then go up by feedback and adjust the parameters (Zhang et al. 2010).
    Rolling correction Listen The water quality and quantity simulation results and
    system status are renewed at time intervals. According to the results of the water
    quantity calculation in the previous period and the pollution control situation,
    the remaining period water allocation scheme is recalculated, that is, revise
    the scheme, and then roll to the end of the sequence (Yuan et al. 2015). MODEL
    VERIFICATION Model parameters Listen (1) Water quantity parameters. Considering
    the relatively complex flow in the Lanzhou to Hekouzhen reach, the Muskinggem
    algorithm is used to calculate the flow. The relevant main parameters include:
    flow advance time and flow specific gravity factor, which is determined by the
    flow, the flow velocity and the distance between the upper and lower sections.
    (2) Water quality parameters. According to the relevant research results, the
    variation range of chemical oxygen demand (COD) attenuation coefficient is 0.15–0.25
    and the ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) attenuation coefficient is 0.3–0.6 in the Yellow
    River (Yun et al. 2005). There are many factors affecting the attenuation coefficient
    of pollutants. The fluctuation of influence factors will cause the change of pollutant
    attenuation coefficient. Through sensitivity analysis, the concentration of pollutants,
    water temperature, hydraulic characteristics and suspended solids are considered
    as the key factors affecting the comprehensive attenuation coefficient of a water
    quality model (Zhou et al. 2013). The attenuation coefficient of pollutants in
    a river reach consists of two parts: the basic coefficient and the influence coefficient.
    (13) in which is the basic value of attenuation coefficient of polluntant p; ⁠,
    is the affecting coefficient of pollutant p attenuation of factor q at time t
    and their variation respectively. The influence factors of the main pollutant
    attenuation coefficient are set out in Table 2. Rating and verification Listen
    (1) Parameter rating. The main parameter rating in the model is carried out based
    on the period 2001–2007. The measured runoff of Lanzhou section is taken as the
    basic inflow of the model, and the amount of water intake, the process of water
    intake and the discharge of pollutants are taken as the basic input. The simulated
    discharge process and pollutant concentration in different sections are compared
    with the measured water quantity and quality data from 2001 to 2007 in the section
    from Lanzhou to Hekouzhen of the Yellow River, and the parameters are adjusted
    until the fitting accuracy meets the requirement, then, the parameter rate is
    determined. (2) Model verification. The reliability of the model is verified using
    2008–2010 as the verification period. The discharge of 14 main sections from Lanzhou
    to Hekouzhen are simulated using the water volume model. The model simulation
    accuracy criteria are required as follows. The average deviation of monthly discharge
    is less than 8%. The Nash coefficients of section water flow simulation are greater
    than 0. 84. The main pollutant concentration, water quality category and change
    trend of the main section simulated by the water quality model are basically consistent
    with the actual measurement. The relative errors of COD and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N)
    are less than 20%. Table 2 Influence factors of main pollutant attenuation coefficient

    ANALYSIS Basic data analysis Listen (1) Water resources quantity. From 1956 to
    2000, the average annual natural runoff at the Tangnaihe section is 205.2 × 108
    m3, and 329.90 × 108 m3 at the Lanzhou section. The amount of surface water resources
    between Lanzhou and Hekouzhen is 17.68 × 108 m3, the loss of evaporation and leakage
    between the two sections is 15.82 × 108 m3, the natural runoff at the Hekouzhen
    section is 331.8 × 108 m3, and the amount of groundwater availability is 40.55
    × 108 m3. (2) Water demand. It is predicted that the total water demand from Lanzhou
    to Hekouzhen at the 2020 level (relative to probabilities of 50%, 75% and 90%)
    is 191.1 × 108 m3, 200.0 × 108 m3, and 207.3 × 108 m3 respectively, of which more
    than 50 percent are agricultural water use. Water demands for different reaches
    are shown in Table 3. (3) Pollutant emission. Pollutants in the reach come mainly
    from municipal sewage, industrial waste water and agricultural irrigation water
    recession. According to the current pollutant discharge level and the development
    trend of different water use and drainage technology, and based on the water demand
    of different sectors in the river reach, the average annual COD emission from
    Lanzhou to Hekouzhen at the 2020 level is predicted to be 53.8 × 104t. The amount
    of ammonia and nitrogen (NH3-N) emission is 6.328 × 104t. Emissions of major pollutants
    are shown in Table 4. (4) Section discharge and ecological water flow control.
    According to ‘The Detailed Rules in the Implementation of the Yellow River Water
    Allocation Act’, the minimum control discharge at the sections of Xiaheyan, Shizuishan
    and Toudaoguai is 200 m3/s, 150 m3/s and 50 m3/s respectively. Annual discharge
    quantity at the Hekouzhen section should not be less than 197.0 × 108 m3. (5)
    Water quality objectives in water function areas. There are five water function
    primary areas and 22 water function secondary areas in the reach from Lanzhou
    to Hekouzhen. The water quality targets in the water function areas are all of
    class III, corresponding to the target water quality control index: COD is not
    more than 20 mg/L, ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) is not more than 1 mg/L. Table 3 Prediction

    chart of simulation, feedback, coordination and control, under the guidance and
    control of water discharge and water quality target in the water function areas,
    through water intake adjustment, control and feedback, and reducing the amount
    of pollutant emission, the integrated allocation purpose of water quality and
    quantity can be realized. (1) Water quantity allocation. The requirements of section
    discharge and water quality in function areas are met by the water intake control
    and water supply process. Water allocation results: the annual average water supply
    above Hekouzhen is 202.50 × 108 m3, in which surface water supply is 166.50 ×
    108 m3, underground water supply is 23.59 × 108 m3, reclaimed water is 12.42 ×
    108 m3, and water shortage in the reach is 22.41 × 108 m3. Water intake is controlled
    reasonably. The annual average natural runoff at the section of Lanzhou is 329.90
    × 108 m3, the annual average water intake above the Lanzhou section is 30.67 ×
    108 m3, and the water consumption is 22.02 × 108 m3. The annual average water
    discharge at the Lanzhou section is 315.9 × 108 m3. The annual average surface
    water consumption in the reach from Lanzhou to Hekouzhen is 125.2 × 108 m3. The
    reduction of water consumption is 6.72 × 108 m3 compared with the surface water
    consumption index allocated by the ‘87 Water Diversion Scheme’. The section discharge
    meets the relevant requirements. The average annual inflow of the Lanzhou section
    is 307.90 × 108 m3. The section discharge at Xiaheyan, Shizuishan and Hekouzhen
    is 288.0 × 108 m3 and 263.7 × 108 m3, and 206.6 × 108 m3 respectively. Water allocation
    in the different reaches is shown in Table 5. (2) Water quality allocation. Through
    controlling the section discharge volume, the environmental capacity is improved,
    the amount of pollutant emission is controlled and the water quality in the water
    function areas is improved. Water quality allocation results: the discharge of
    waste water is controlled to 41.34 × 108 m3, in which the discharge of industrial
    and domestic sewage is 17.28 × 108 m3 and the agricultural irrigation water recession
    is 24.05 × 108 m3. The main pollutant COD into the river is reduced to 26.5 ×
    104t, which is reduced by 27.3 × 104t, and the rate of reduction is 50.6%. The
    amount of ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) entering the river is controlled within 2.17
    × 104 t, which is reduced by 4.15 × 104t, and the rate of reduction is 65.7%.
    The water quality in 14 water function areas in the river reach achieves the third
    class (class III), and the water quality control goal is realized. The pollutants
    entering the river are shown in Table 6. Table 5 Water allocation scheme in the

    of water quantity and quality allocation Listen (1) Water distribution in the
    reach. The exploitation of groundwater is controlled to 23.59 × 108 m3. Under
    the condition of meeting the discharge quantity and water quality target, the
    average annual water supply from Lanzhou to Hekouzhen is 202.50 × 108 m3, water
    shortage is 27.45 × 108 m3, and the water shortage rate is 14.1%. Uniform distribution
    of water shortage in time and space and the target of the minimum water shortage
    have been realized. (2) Section discharge. The annual discharge at Hekouzhen section
    is 206.6 × 108m3, which is greater than the amount of the water regulation requirement
    (197.0 × 108 m3). The minimum discharge at the section is 269 m3/s, which is over
    the minimum controlled flow (250 m3/s). The discharge at the 14 control sections
    all meet the requirements of the downstream discharge process. (3) Water quality
    in the water function areas. The main pollutants (COD and NH3-N) in the reach
    of the river are strictly controlled. The maximum COD is no more than 20 mg/L,
    the highest ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) is no more than 0. 8 mg /L. The water quality
    at the main section and in the water function areas is up to class III (The State
    Surface Water Quality Standard). The water quality target rate in the water function
    areas reaches 100%. CONCLUSIONS Listen In view of the characteristics of the river
    reach from Lanzhou to Hekouzhen, such as the large amount of water intake and
    recession points, the large amount of water requirement and the complicated process,
    the reach was abstracted as a conceptual element of parameter expression by means
    of generalization. The water system network of a river reach was established in
    describing the hydraulic relation between various elements in mathematical language.
    Using decomposition, coordination, coupling and control methods, an integrated
    model of water quantity and quality was established. Through real-time transfer
    of water quantity and quality models the synchronous coupling of water quantity
    and quality was realized. Taking the 2020 level year of the Lanzhou to Hekouzhen
    reach as an example, the integrated allocation of water quantity and quality was
    carried out. It is shown by the results that the model can control the surface
    water intake from Lanzhou to Hekouzhen by identifying the water intake and section
    discharge. The surface water consumption of Lanzhou to Hekouzhen is 125.2 × 108m3,
    and the surface water intake is 166.5 × 108m3. Through the identification of water
    quality in the water function areas, the optimized COD and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N)
    flow control reduction rates are 50.6% and 65.7% respectively, which effectively
    improve the water quality in the water function areas and meet the water quality
    target in the water function areas. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Listen The study is financially

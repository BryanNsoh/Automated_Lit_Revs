  analysis: 'In this review, we have examined 61 related articles to characterize
    the application of visualization techniques in the agriculture domain. Out of
    the 61 tools, 31 include a dashboard, 15 are simulation-based tools, 24 have been
    designed for real-world applications, and 2 are designed for whole-farm management.
    Our analysis found that geographical data is the most widely used data type in
    agricultural visualization (69%). It is closely followed by soil (41%) and crop
    data (41%). Regarding visualization techniques, 46 out of 61 articles have used
    a map, either 2D or 3D. Time-series (39%) and heatmap (28%) are the other commonly
    used visualization techniques.


    Our review of the 61 articles also reveals that uncertainty visualization is another
    aspect that many existing DSSs have ignored, but can unquestionably improve user
    understanding of the decisions provided by the system. The role of uncertainty
    visualization is further discussed in RQ3.


    We also found that only a few of the tools (11 out of 61) included a report about
    the usability evaluation or a participatory design process. Although we have discovered
    a great amount of visualization tools in agriculture, it is still a difficult
    task to select the most suitable visualization and interaction techniques for
    end-users. Feedback from end-users is an important aspect in developing tools
    that are usable in practical settings.'

    Get rights and content Highlights • Various visualisation techniques are being
    used in differing areas of agriculture. • The majority of DSS utilise maps with
    satellite imagery as the central visualisation. • There are great opportunities
    for dashboard and uncertainty visualisations in DSS. • There is little work on
    visualisation support for whole-farm management approaches. • Design guidelines
    towards the development of interactive and visual DSS are provided. Abstract Decision
    Support Systems (DSSs) are used in precision agriculture to provide feedback to
    a variety of stakeholders, including farmers, advisers, researchers and policymakers.
    However, increments in the amount of data might lead to data quality issues, and
    as these applications scale into big, real-time monitoring systems the problem
    gets even more challenging. Visualisation is a powerful technique used in these
    systems that provides an indispensable step in assisting end-users to understand
    and interpret the data. In this paper, we present a systematic review to synthesise
    literature related to the use of visualisation techniques in the domain of agriculture.
    The search identified 61 eligible articles, from which we established end-users,
    visualisation techniques and data collection methods across different application
    domains. We found visualisation techniques used in various areas of agriculture,
    including viticulture, dairy farming, wheat production and irrigation management.
    Our results show that the majority of DSSs utilise maps, together with satellite
    imagery, as the central visualisation. Also, we observed that there is an excellent
    opportunity for dashboards to enable end-users with better interaction support
    to understand the uncertainty of data. Based on this analysis, we provide design
    guidelines towards the implementation of more interactive and visual DSSs. Previous

    Support Systems (DSSs) are designed to assist humans in making more effective
    decisions. In the field of agriculture, different stakeholders such as farmers,
    advisers and policymakers use software tools that facilitate farm management by
    gathering data from multiple sources, analysing these data and utilising a series
    of suggestions that are presented by different visual outputs. Many DSSs are designed
    to support the concept of precision agriculture (PA) which seeks to provide a
    holistic approach to assist farmers with optimising resources (Paustian and Theuvsen,
    2017). McBratney et al. (2005a) defined PA as the “kind of agriculture that increases
    the number of (correct) decisions per unit area of land per unit time with associated
    net benefits”. Thus, PA research concentrates on enabling users to make the right
    decisions considering both space and time. In the history of agricultural systems,
    user-driven data and model development has played an essential role in meeting
    users’ analysis need for decision-support (Jones et al., 2017). Still, models
    remain unfriendly, inside a black-box and behind DSS software. This black-box
    nature often leads to trust issues, notably when suggestions coming from a DSS
    fail (He et al., 2016). Moreover, an increase in the use of farm sensors, high-tech
    harvesters and drones, among others, has created a massive amount of data that
    might be difficult for decision-makers to grasp (Manos et al., 2004). Users, therefore,
    need additional tools for understanding and interpreting their data (Ruß et al.,
    2009a). Visualisation is a powerful technique to address these issues and has
    demonstrated its usefulness in PA (Wachowiak et al., 2017) to communicate uncertainty
    from both the data and the models (Frías et al., 2018). Visualisation techniques
    have been used to assist users to better interact and understand data by aggregating,
    filtering, searching or otherwise sifting through and scaling down relevant information.
    Moreover, visualisations are often explicitly designed to assist our visual system
    in handling detail that might otherwise require significant cognitive effort.
    For instance, visualisations provide information that can be easily perceived,
    recognised and processed into inferences. In this sense, visualisations also offer
    short-term or long-term memory aids to reduce memory and cognitive load. Such
    support can make data, including potentially complex information, more easily
    consumable. As Rind et al. (2013,) suggest, visualisation tools and techniques
    “combine the processing power of modern computers with human cognition and visual
    abilities to better support analysis tasks”. In line with participatory DSS development,
    visualisations can be especially practical and useful when following user-centred
    design approaches (Hertem et al., 2017). In fact, a number of qualitative PA studies
    highlighted the importance of using a participatory-design approach (Odom, 2010,
    Aragó Galindo et al., 2012a), where the farmer’s perspective is used as the central
    focus of the design. A key goal of such an approach is to support complex data
    analysis by providing diverse visualisation techniques and adapting the tool according
    to the farmer needs (Stojanovic et al., 2017a). A great number of visualisations
    and visual analytics tools have been proposed in the domain of agriculture with
    the aim to support the decision-making process. However, to the best of our knowledge,
    a comprehensive analysis of such tools, by considering their application areas,
    visualisation techniques and intended end-users, does not yet exist. Previous
    literature reviews in agriculture have focused on similar areas such as DSSs and
    PA, but not on visualisation techniques. For example, Kamilaris et al. (2017)
    presented a survey on the recent practices of big data analysis in agriculture
    that would help farmers and companies to extract value from data, improving their
    productivity. This survey highlighted the opportunities of big data analysis for
    smarter farming. A different systematic review (Le Gal et al., 2011) highlighted
    the methodologies that can be used to support farmers in designing innovative
    agricultural production systems. In the context of precision agriculture, Imam
    et al. (2015) reviewed design issues for wireless sensor networks and showed a
    comparison of different characteristics of humidity sensors, such as sensor type,
    their sensitivity and power consumption, which play a key role for wireless sensor
    networks for precision agriculture applications. As such, a number of reviews
    have addressed the issues surrounding DSSs and PA, but the use of visualisations
    in DSSs has yet to be understood. To address this gap, in this paper, we review
    the use of information visualisation techniques in 61 articles that report their
    support for end-user decision-making. From an HCI (Human-Computer Interaction)
    perspective, we explore the design methodology behind the implementation of such
    systems and investigate the rationale behind the use of visual components in different
    application domains. HCI is a discipline in which users as well as technology
    and environment are emphasised in the design process (Saizmaa and Kim, 2008).
    For example, paying little attention to the environment could result in the DSS
    being unfit for the intended environment. A recent study (Rose et al., 2018) explored
    the reasons behind the lack of interest by farmers in the computer-based support
    systems and highlighted the importance of HCI perspectives when designing DSSs.
    The study also found clear benefits of designing a DSS that is easy to use, fits
    the existing workflow of users, performs well and incubate trust (Rose et al.,
    2018), which are some of the most commonly accessed metrics of HCI research. We
    had two specific goals in this review: our first goal was to examine user interaction
    with DSS for agriculture (i.e., input to the system, output from the system and
    other interface factors) in order to identify design features that go into the
    making of effective DSS. Our second goal was to gain insight into the evaluation
    of DSS, as well as to learn from these evaluations to identify opportunities for
    future research. To guide this work, we have defined our research questions as
    follows: • RQ1: What visualisation techniques are being used across different
    domains in agriculture? • RQ2: How are these visualisations being used by end-users
    to make decisions? • RQ3: What is the role of uncertainty in the visualisation
    tools that support decision-making? • RQ4: What is the role of HCI in the design
    and development of visualisation tools to support end-user decisions? The contributions
    of this paper are the following: first, we present an extensive overview of visualisation
    and visual analytics techniques that have been elaborated in the agriculture field,
    highlighting the potential of DSSs and their use of visualisations for decision-making
    in agricultural contexts. Second, we present an analysis of a wide range of characteristics,
    including visualisation techniques that are commonly used, how data is captured
    and how these systems have been evaluated. Based on this analysis, we outline
    guidelines for the design of DSSs as well as directions for future research for
    this area. 2. Method In this section, we first elaborate the method employed for
    the selection of articles/papers for our systematic review. We also define the
    different categories that were used for coding the existing tools. 2.1. Eligibility
    criteria This review includes articles that investigated or reported the usage
    of DSSs involving visualisation techniques to support end-users in the field of
    agriculture. The eligibility criteria were specified according to the PICO framework
    (Table 1), stated in the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis
    statement (Moher et al., 2009). Table 1. Overview of the search strategy, keywords

    written in English. The population was targeted to all articles reporting end-users
    (i.e. farmers, policymakers or advisers) using any kind of decision tools, (i.e.
    demos, proof-of-concept tools, dashboards and simulations) in the agriculture
    domain and being supported by the use of any type of visualisation for decision-making.
    DSSs were included without restrictions on the platform of use (i.e. desktop,
    web-browser or mobile applications). Literature was included if they added a clear
    description of the DSS, stating the data input, collection and outcome for any
    end-user involved in the agriculture domain (i.e. farmers, advisers, policymakers).
    Articles describing the use of visualisations in text or figures were included.
    Papers that reported the design process of the tool and user studies regarding
    visualisation techniques were included and analysed in detail separately. 2.2.
    Search strategy A scoping exercise to nail down search keywords was conducted
    in the Google Scholar and ScienceDirect databases in May 2018. The keyword identification
    was complemented by using keyword services such as Google Keyword Planner and
    Keyword Tool. The produced keywords are presented in Table 1. Using the defined
    keywords, hand searching (i.e., a method of manually examining a paper to identify
    all eligible criteria (Higgins et al., 2005)) of relevant authors and articles
    was conducted in Google Scholar. As Google Scholar provides a broad result of
    papers, we used the advanced search functionality for initial searches and narrowed
    down the search using the specific keywords defined in the eligibility criteria
    section, and listed in Table 2. Journals in the agriculture domain were identified
    using ScimagoJR.2 The search of papers within the identified journals was done
    in the ScienceDirect platform. Results from the search are presented in Table

    (n = 2132). Titles and abstracts were screened, excluding those who were not relevant
    to our research and/or did not meet the previously defined eligibility criteria.
    Afterwards, the remaining articles were retrieved and assessed for eligibility
    at full-text (n = 140). The process of paper selection is illustrated in Fig.
    1. In summary, the search identified 2132 papers, from those, only 140 documents
    were retrieved and reviewed in full-text from this initial set based on our criteria.

    Flow diagram illustrating the literature selection process. 2.4. Data extraction
    Data from the included articles were coded and extracted in a spreadsheet designed
    for this review: https://goo.gl/SeJDdV. The 61 papers included in this review
    were coded based on the following main categories: end-user, tool type, development
    status, platform, the visualisation technique, data source, research domain and
    evaluation. At the beginning of this stage, an inter-coder reliability assessment
    was conducted between the researchers using Cohen’s kappa (McHugh, 2012). A random
    selection with 20% of the papers was listed in a spreadsheet and coded following
    the defined coding categories and subcategories. The decisions made by the second
    researcher were compared against the first, generating Cohen’s Kappa statistics.
    The statistics revealed a substantial agreement between the researchers, ( CI,
    to ), . Disagreements were discussed and resolved. Consistency in coding was kept
    throughout the remaining reviewed papers. Categories and subcategories were identified
    based on our research questions and objectives, most of them emerged as common
    themes derived from the articles in this review, for all the categories we used
    both open and closed coding approaches (see Table 3 for an overview of the categories).
    In the following subsections, we briefly describe these categories. Table 3. Definitions

    are the main targets of DSSs in agriculture. In this review, we identified four
    types of stakeholders: farmers, domain experts (farm advisers or agronomists),
    academic researchers and policymakers (see Table 3). In this review, we used the
    end-user category to identify the types of visualisations that are targeted at
    specific types of stakeholders. 2.4.2. Tool type Some DSSs are designed to provide
    a simulation approach where farmers can walk-through simulated farming scenarios
    to explore and better understand their practices (e.g. Dolinska, 2017). This approach
    can also help leverage learning of farmers. Unlike the simulation approach, there
    are DSSs that have been designed for practical applications in real farms. Such
    systems provide decision support solutions for a particular decision-making scenario
    (e.g. irrigation scheduling, fertiliser application, etc.). In addition, there
    are systems that provide farmers with necessary tools for the planning required
    for the whole farm. As such, we categorised the papers into three tool types based
    on their approach: simulation, real practice and whole-farm management. 2.4.3.
    Development status DSSs are often evaluated at different stages of the development
    life circle. Thus, although certain papers present the systems that are currently
    being applied in real farms, there are others that are under development or at
    a concept stage. We used this category to identify the status of the application
    and understand the usage of visualisation at different levels. Subcategories include
    concept, prototype and production. 2.4.4. Platform Since the scale of agricultural
    operations has increased over the years, DSSs are required to support on-the-fly
    access and in-field decision-making (Tan et al., 2012). Thus, many researchers
    have started looking into the use of different devices (i.e. desktop or mobile).
    The systems themselves and visualisation requirements can differ according to
    the platform. In this review, we identified the papers that are intended for mobile
    and/or desktop uses. 2.4.5. Visualisation techniques One main goal of this review
    was to identify visualisation techniques that are proposed for agricultural decision
    support systems. Visualisation techniques may vary according to the needs of the
    users, application domain, visual literacy, etc. With this category, we identified
    an exhaustive list of visualisation techniques that are used to display agricultural
    data and predictions. 2.4.6. Data source Outputs of DSSs are driven by data (Pham
    and Stack, 2018). The type of data collected and how they are utilised play an
    important role in providing optimal decisions and can vary depending on the decision-making
    requirements. Thus, we identified data sources of the selected DSSs. 2.4.7. Application
    domain There are diverse sub-domains in agriculture, some of which include: wheat
    production, irrigation management, crop management, etc. Depending of the domain,
    decision requirements can also vary vastly. Since our initial analysis showed
    that DSSs have been proposed for many sub-domains of agriculture, we identified
    the application domain of each DSS. 2.4.8. Design approach The design stage has
    been identified as one of the critical steps in the development of visualisation
    tools and agricultural DSSs (Parker and Sinclair, 2001). It also plays an important
    role in the adoption of the system (Lindblom et al., 2017). Thus, significant
    efforts have been put into applying user-centred approaches for developing DSSs
    (Parker, 1999). We categorised the selected DSSs based on the following user-centred
    design approaches: participatory, focus group and iterative. A brief definition
    for each of these categories has been provided in Table 3. It is important to
    note that the design approach generally defines a framework for evaluating a system.
    Various evaluation methods maybe used under a selected framework. These evaluation
    methods are described in Section 2.4.9. 2.4.9. Evaluation methods Evaluation is
    an important part of the software development life circle as it ensures that all
    the requirements of the software are met. As mentioned in Section 2.4.8, different
    evaluation methods can be used under a selected design framework. Our initial
    analysis showed that a number of evaluation methods have been used by previous
    work in agriculture. Thus, we identified DSSs based on the following evaluation
    methods: observation, questionnaire, interview and workshop. A brief definitions
    for these categories can be found in Table 3. In general, user observations are
    conducted “in the wild” where users are typically allowed to explore a given tool
    freely. Interactions with the tool are observed and recorded. In certain cases,
    questionnaires may be administered to users who then provide written answers to
    a set of questions which can include both open- and close-ended questions. Unlike
    asking the questions verbally as in interviews, questionnaires demand less effort
    from the questioner and provide structured sets of answers. On the other hand,
    interviews involve delivering both questions and answers verbally. Interviews
    allow the questioner to capture in-depth feedback and to pose further questions
    which is not possible with the questionnaire approach. Workshops, unlike interviews,
    involve a group of users answering to a set of questions which are typically introduced
    by the questioner. Workshops create a great environment to capture rich opinions
    from users by allowing them to discuss the questions and come up with solutions.
    3. Analysis We analysed the selected papers based on the nine categories presented
    in Table 3 as explained above. An overview of the number of papers identified
    within each category is shown in Fig. 2. In the following subsections, results

    DSSs that have been elaborated in various application domains and demonstrate
    how they have been applied to assist with decision support tasks. Although many
    of the systems are grouped by their application domain, some fall under various
    domains, as illustrated in Fig. 3. Although this figure is by no means exhaustive,
    it provides insights into the typical cross-domain supports of current DSSs in
    agriculture. A complete list of DSSs under each application domain is presented

    vineyard monitoring, reducing costs and at the same time, generating a more transparent
    representation of the existent variability in the vineyard, which is valuable
    for the optimisation of the harvest and producing high-quality grapes (Best et
    al., 2005). Rossi et al. (100 (2014)) is a DSS for crop management of vineyards
    (Fig. 4a). Using sensors, the system shows visual information about soil water
    content to help farmers monitor adequate water levels. Decision support modules
    provide information about vine growth, pest control and diseases in grape berries.
    The visualisation of real-time information supports farmers to make informed decisions
    and maintain a record behind each management action. Blauth and Ducati (2010)
    introduced a map visualisation of the land usage in vineyards (Fig. 4b). The system
    monitors grape variety, production and inventory information, using a map to indicate
    vineyards, vegetation, bare soil or nearby urban areas. Terribile et al. (2017)
    provides support to farmers at a landscape level (Fig. 4c) with an interactive
    dashboard that allows the selection and comparison of areas of interest together
    with multiple data layers on top of a map. Download : Download high-res image

    Dairy farming According to an annual report published by United States Department
    of Agriculture,3 feeding animals for dairy farming is one of the highest expenses
    for dairy producers across the states. In order to optimise productivity, dairy
    producers focus on formulating diets based on the growth rate, milk production
    and reproduction. Thus, DSSs have also become widely popular in dairy farming.
    Oliver et al. (2017) is a DSS that provides a visualisation of the agricultural
    land to manage microbial pollution risks (Fig. 5a). A participatory design approach
    was used to engage with stakeholders in order to create a user-friendly system
    for guiding on-farm risk assessment. The resulting tool visualises patterns of
    E. coli in space and time. Cabrera et al. (2005) is a DSS intended for producers
    and regulatory agencies. The main purpose of this tool is to integrate nutrient
    budgeting, crop and optimisation models to assess nitrogen leaching from dairy
    farm systems. The user interface of DyNoFlo Dairy provides a graphical representation
    of all system modules and their connections, allowing users to interact with different
    models in order to optimise nitrogen leaching and profit (Fig. 5b). Download :

    than any other commercial crop and continues to be the most important food grain
    source for humans. Its production leads all crops, including rice, maize and potatoes.
    We found four tools (Armstrong and Nallan, 2016, Lorite et al., 2013, Thierry
    et al., 2017, Lundström and Lindblom, 2018) that visually support end-users in
    the wheat production domain. Armstrong and Nallan (2016) provides valuable information
    for Western Australian wheat growers, using diverse visualisation techniques to
    illustrate seasonal rainfall and yield production (Fig. 6a). AquaCrop (Lorite
    et al., 2013) provides simulation analysis towards the impact of climate change
    on wheat yield in Southern Spain by visualising yield and rainfall (Fig. 6b).
    ATLAS (Thierry et al., 2017) simulates crop availability at the landscape scale
    by visualising in 2D and 3D maps different crop scenarios in relation to pests,
    diseases and biological control (Fig. 6c). cropSAT (Lundström and Lindblom, 2018)
    is a DSS to visually analyse nitrogen fertilisation of winter wheat using satellite
    images: farmers can recognise and explain visualised variation in the crop biomass
    (Fig. 6d). Download : Download high-res image (516KB) Download : Download full-size

    et al., 2017), (d) cropSAT (Lundström and Lindblom, 2018). 3.1.4. Pest and disease
    control Pest control is a vital process in the agricultural business, as pests
    and diseases can lead to important economic and ecological losses (del Águila
    et al., 2015). A number of DSSs have focused on providing support for farmers
    to identifying and treating (Rossi et al., 100 (2014), Rupnik et al., 2019) a
    particular pest (see Fig. 7). CognitiveInputs (Devitt et al., 2017) (Fig. 7a)
    is an interactive tool aimed for cotton growers that allows them to explore weed
    management decisions while considering uncertainties under climate conditions.
    Designed as an extension for existing farm management systems, AgroDSS (Fig. 7b)
    (Rupnik et al., 2019) uses data mining and statistical methods to make predictions
    for simulated scenarios and to better understand the dependencies within a domain.
    This includes identifying pest populations and species. AgroDSS uses time-series
    graphs to visualise such data. Vite.net (Fig. 7c) (Rossi et al., 100 (2014)) is
    a comprehensive farm management system that can also visually represent pest occurrences
    over the season. Time-series graphs are used to show in-depth information regarding
    a disease, an infection chain and/or infection severity. Further decision support
    is provided for treatment plans using a decision tree. In addition, a dashboard
    shows alert levels of a disease and protection of the last fungicide spray against
    diseases. Download : Download high-res image (455KB) Download : Download full-size

    et al., 100 (2014)). 3.1.5. Irrigation management Irrigation advisory services
    provide the farmers with assistance in irrigation scheduling knowledge, considering
    crop water conditions in different crops, optimising production and cost-effectiveness.
    Visualisations support farmers with a better overview of water distribution to
    their crops by showing moisture content, water uptake, etc. Such views allow farmers
    to adjust their irrigation process depending on the soil, farm area and season
    in order to optimise crop production. As an example, the tool designed by Byishimo
    and Garba (2016) uses real-time data collected from in-field sensors to produce
    live visualisations allowing farmers to monitor and process information about
    the soil, temperature and irrigation. Interaction is limited as users can only
    hover over the time-series visualisation to see annotations indicating details
    about the data over time (Fig. 8a). Another example is DIDAS (Friedman et al.,
    2016), a tool that allows to evaluate a farm based on a number of inputs such
    as soil, evaporation, plant resistance and land structure and assists with the
    design and scheduling of drip irrigation systems (Fig. 8b). By visualising water
    flow, DIDAS can assist farmers in taking decisions about irrigation schedules
    under conditions where water is a crucial limiting factor in crop productions.
    HydroQual (Accorsi et al., 2014) uses a dataset consisting of sequences of biological
    indices and physico-chemical values for geo-localised river stations and allows
    experts to visually analyse river water quality of different geographical areas
    (Fig. 8c). Download : Download high-res image (554KB) Download : Download full-size

    and Garba (Byishimo and Garba, 2016), (b) DIDAS (Friedman et al., 2016), (c) HydroQual
    (Accorsi et al., 2014). 3.1.6. Crop management Crop production is deeply dependent
    on climate conditions, diseases and pests, making it essential to provide farmers
    with risk management technology. AquaGIS (Fig. 9a) (Lorite et al., 2013) is a
    visualisation tool that uses AquaCrop, a crop growth model, to simulate results
    of crop management in multiple fields and seasons. AquaGIS features visualisation
    modules that facilitate the presentation of spatial data. It allows an efficient
    visualisation in a map using different colours that facilitate spatial visualisation.
    An interactive component allows interaction between different maps that describe
    the evolution over time of the results provided by AquaCrop. AgMine (Fig. 9b)
    (Armstrong and Nallan, 2016) is a DSS that comprises multiple components of statistical
    analysis powered by visualisation modules. Visualisation is used in this tool
    as a powerful technique for geo-spatial analysis, climate and crop-yield mapping.
    With the proposed framework, farmers can use the visualisations to detect seasonal
    patterns of rainfall and see the effects on various scenarios comparing dry and
    wet years in crop production. Download : Download high-res image (315KB) Download

    Fertiliser management The aim of precision agriculture is to optimise farm outputs
    while preserving resources (McBratney et al., 2005b). Thus, fertiliser management
    plays an important role in precision agriculture. CropSAT (Fig. 10) (Lundström
    and Lindblom, 2018) is a tool developed for calculation of variable rate application
    files for nitrogen fertilisation from satellite images. The images generated in
    CropSAT show visual representations of crop biomass variation, which is difficult
    to achieve by just walking or driving in the field. Download : Download high-res

    Weather prediction and climate Weather forecast is a big challenge in the practical
    application of seasonal predictions in different economic sectors (Frías et al.,
    2018). Fortunately, interactive visualisation is well known for facilitating the
    analysis of probabilistic predictions under uncertainty (Spiegelhalter et al.,
    2011, Diehl et al., 2017), particularly towards non-expert users (Kay et al.,
    2016). An example tool, Geovisage (Jarvis et al., 2017), is a web-based decision
    support system designed for farmers that displays graphs of current sensor data
    from several weather stations. The tool visualises real-time data in a time-series
    plot offering a quick view of recent weather conditions where time periods and
    different weather stations are compared; a table provides extra details with statistical
    information (Fig. 11a). CAMDT (Fig. 11b) (Han et al., 2017) is another example
    that aims to facilitate probabilistic seasonal weather forecasts. The tool provides
    a user interface to help decision-makers adjust their crop and water management
    practices that may improve outcomes given the expected weather condition of the
    growing season. It provides “what-if” scenarios where the forecast is presented
    for visual comparison. Download : Download high-res image (303KB) Download : Download

    majority of tools we reviewed are designed to support farmers, there are some
    that also support other end-users including domain experts (farm advisers and
    agronomists), policymakers and academic researchers. In this section, we present
    our findings of tools that have been designed to help different stakeholders in
    agriculture. A comprehensive list of these tools is presented in Table 5. Table

    34 9 4 4 4 Percent (%): 56 15 7 7 7 3.2.1. Farmers We discovered that a large
    number of tools in agriculture (34 out of 61) are designed for farmers. These
    tools focus on assisting farmers with various aspects of farming. The majority
    of the tools used one or more visualisation techniques to help the farmers better
    understand the status of their farm and crops and to be able to make accurate
    decisions regarding irrigation schedules (Fig. 8), fertiliser applications (Fig.
    10), pest control (Fig. 7), etc. Details of individual visualisation techniques
    found in each of these tools are presented in Section 3.3. 3.2.2. Policymakers
    We found a total of four tools (Tayyebi et al., 2016, Gandhi et al., 2016, Río
    et al., 2011, de Souza et al., 2003) that are designed to be used by policymakers.
    Policymakers, such as rural extension technicians, use DSSs to facilitate the
    evaluation of consequences of changes in agriculture, such as crop affectations
    in landscapes. For instance, SmartScape (Tayyebi et al., 2016) provides diverse
    visual components, such as maps and radar charts, to provide assistance to policymakers
    in evaluating the consequences of ecosystem services in agriculture landscapes
    (see Fig. 12). In addition, some tools (e.g. de Souza et al., 2003) are designed
    to help with information dissemination, allowing policymakers to exchange knowledge
    back and forth with farmers. Download : Download high-res image (656KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 12. User interface of SmartScape (Tayyebi et al.,
    2016), a tool to support policymakers. 3.2.3. Domain experts Farm advisers, including
    agronomists, are considered domain experts who are often consulted by farmers,
    as well as by researchers for designing DSSs (Adinarayana et al., 2008, Accorsi
    et al., 2014, de Souza et al., 2003). They also assist policymakers to implement
    farming policies and in changing farmer behaviour (Ingram, 2008). Farm advisers
    typically assess the farms by using varieties of statistical models and analysis
    methods, evaluating the risks of different management scenarios and finally propose
    strategies/guidelines for farmers. Thus, the tools designed for both farm adviser
    and farmers are typically capable of conducting analyses and simulations, as well
    as visualising the resulting guidelines for farmers (Fig. 8c). There are nine
    tools (Han et al., 2017, Lorite et al., 2013, Yalew et al., 2016, Aragó Galindo
    et al., 2012b, Rossi et al., 100 (2014), Oliver et al., 2017, Acutis et al., 2014,
    Thysen and Detlefsen, 2006, Han et al., 2019) that have been designed to support
    farm advisers. Agronomists, amongst all domain experts, are known for establishing
    good communication with farmers due to regular on-site meetings, local knowledge
    and long-term relationships with farmers (Ingram, 2008). Agronomists tend to provide
    practical farming decisions that are more likely to coincide with those of farmers,
    instead of urging new initiatives or regulations as some advisers do (Ingram,
    2008). In this review, we found a total of four tools (Stojanovic et al., 2017b,
    Han et al., 2017, Le Ber et al., 2006, Devitt et al., 2017) that have been designed
    to support agronomists. 3.2.4. Academics We found four tools (Stojanovic et al.,
    2017b, Ochola and Kerkides, 2004, Gandhi et al., 2016, Tan et al., 2012) that
    have been designed for academics. AgriAG (Stojanovic et al., 2017b) was developed
    with the aid of academics that provided feedback to the elaboration of the tool.
    Mostly, these applications (Tan et al., 2012, Gandhi et al., 2016) are used by
    academic researchers to explore new technologies to support agricultural decision-making.
    3.3. Visualisation techniques Through this review, we found a number of visualisation
    techniques currently being used in DSSs for agriculture. Table 6 shows an exhaustive
    list of different visualisation techniques that are found in the papers we reviewed.
    In the following subsections, we present the ten most common visualisation techniques.

    used in agriculture to visually communicate geo-spatial data, providing an overview
    of the farms. In total, our review identified 46 papers (i.e. 75%) that used a
    type of map visualisation (see Table 6 for details). As seen in Fig. 13, both
    2D and 3D map visualisations have been proposed to represent physical landscapes.
    Out of the 46 papers, a large proportion (i.e. 42 papers) have implemented 2D
    maps. Examples include ViPER (Oliver et al., 2017) (Fig. 13a) and AQUAGIS (Lorite
    et al., 2013) (Fig. 13b), where plots of physical landscapes are virtually displayed
    on a 2D map. Example usage of 3D maps includes AgriAG (Stojanovic et al., 2017b)
    (Fig. 13c) and ATLAS (Thierry et al., 2017) (Fig. 13d). Both 2D and 3D maps are
    often layered with various colour representations, such as a heatmap to further
    visualise areas of interest in the farm. Download : Download high-res image (843KB)

    Heatmap Heatmaps represent data values contained in an area of interest using
    a colour range. Since heatmap visualisations generally highlight areas of interest,
    they are often used as an overlay on top of geographical maps. Heatmaps are for
    instance used to represent the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to
    indicate the density of green on a patch of land. Other types of data visualised
    with heatmaps include biomass, weather, water density, risk of flooding, etc.
    We found a total of 17 tools that used heatmaps to visualise regions of interest
    across landscapes (see Table 6). CropSAT (Lundström and Lindblom, 2018), for example,
    uses heatmaps to indicate biomass in a patch of farm using satellite-based images
    (see Fig. 10). Another example is the vineyard management tool designed by Blauth
    and Ducati (2010) (see Fig. 4b) that uses a heatmap to differentiate vineyards
    from other vegetation, bare soil and urban areas. CAMDT (Han et al., 2017), as
    shown in Fig. 11b, uses heatmaps to indicate areas of land that are at the risk
    of flooding. 3.3.3. Time-series Time-series visualisations are used to show a
    distributions of data points that are ordered by time. They are similar to line
    graphs in that they present two dimensional data where a sequence of time (e.g.
    months) is usually plotted on the x-axis. Due to their simplicity and effectiveness
    in presenting data points through time, time-series are commonly seen in agricultural
    tools. We found a total of 24 tools (see Table 6) that used time-series to visualise
    various farm data. An example is CropGIS (Machwitz et al., 2019) which displays
    the biomass growth of a farm over time (see Fig. 10). In a similar way, DIDAS
    (Friedman et al., 2016) shows relative water uptake using time-series (see Fig.
    8b). Other example applications include AgMine (Armstrong and Nallan, 2016), visualising
    wheat yield and rainfall patterns, and LMTooln (Falloon et al., 2018), visualising
    temperature, precipitation and wind speed. 3.3.4. Bar chart Bar charts present
    bars clustered in groups, showing the values of more than one measured variable.
    One axis of bar charts shows the specific categories being compared and the other
    axis represents a measured value. We found a total of eight tools (see Table 6)
    that used bar charts to present data. We also discovered that, in agriculture,
    bar charts are commonly used in combinations with other types of visualisations.
    For instance, AgMine (Armstrong and Nallan, 2016) (Fig. 9b) uses bar charts with
    time-series to show average wheat yield between years. Similarly, DIDAS (Friedman
    et al., 2016) (Fig. 8b) shows water supply scheduling for irrigation over a 24-h
    period. AgriSuit (Yalew et al., 2016) (Fig. 14c) uses a heatmap and bar chart
    together to present the distribution of suitable agricultural lands in an area
    of interest. Download : Download high-res image (784KB) Download : Download full-size

    3.3.5. Histogram Histograms are used to represent an estimate of the probability
    distribution of a continuous variable (Pearson, 1895). It differs from a bar chart
    in the sense that a bar graph represents categorical variables, whereas in a histogram
    each column/bar represents a continuous quantitative variable. We found seven
    tools that used histograms to present farm-related data. SmartScape (Tayyebi et
    al., 2016) (Fig. 12) uses a histogram to illustrate simulation results of various
    crop change scenarios. The results illustrated include changes in vital soil chemical
    contents, bird habitat, biofuel, pollinators, net income and net energy. In AquaGIS
    (Lorite et al., 2013) (Fig. 6c), histogram is used to illustrate a comparison
    between crop yield and rainfall over time. 3.3.6. Pie chart A pie chart is a circular
    visualisation which is divided into slices with different colours to illustrate
    a numerical proportion. Much like bar charts, pie charts are used to visualise
    a distribution between categories of data. However, compared to bar charts, pie
    charts are less popular in agriculture. We found a total of five tools that used
    pie charts to visualise farm data. The VBoxReporting system (Bimonte et al., 2016)
    is an example of usage of the pie chart in agriculture. This tool uses pie charts
    to illustrate a comparison of work time and fuel consumption in a day between
    different plots. 3.3.7. Radar chart Radar charts are frequently used to visualise
    multivariate data in the form of a two-dimensional chart. Thus, they can be used
    when three or more variables are present. In agriculture, however, radar charts
    are less common. In this review, we discovered three tools that uses radar charts.
    SmartScape (Tayyebi et al., 2016) (Fig. 12) is an example tool that uses a radar
    chart to illustrate environmental outcomes between current and hypothetical crop
    change scenarios. The outcomes include vital soil chemical contents, bird habitat,
    biofuel, pollinators, net income and net energy. As presented in Section 3.3.5,
    SmartScape (Tayyebi et al., 2016) also uses a histogram to illustrate such outcomes
    in two different ways. 3.3.8. Clustering A clustering view shows clusters of similar
    information organised by colours and shapes. While clustering is a commonly used
    prediction technique, the visualisation of these clusters for interpretation by
    end-users is quite uncommon: we found only one tool, HydroQual (Accorsi et al.,
    2014), that offers such a view. In HydroQual, water stations across a map are
    illustrated in groups by their behavioural similarity (see Fig. 8c). 3.3.9. Temporal
    pattern view Also in HydroQual (Accorsi et al., 2014) (Fig. 8c), a “temporal pattern
    view” is described, which is essentially a variation of a node-link diagram. It
    is used to illustrate patterns of changes in biological indices and physico-chemical
    parameters over time. In this review, we found the use of such a temporal pattern
    view, or node-link diagram, only in HydroQual. 3.3.10. Dashboards Dashboards are
    a collection of visualisations that provide relevant information to be monitored
    on a single screen at a glance (Few, 2006). They provide an easy access to diverse
    visual components to display detailed data, providing a unified display to the
    decision-maker for interaction and exploration (Saket et al., 2019). In this review,
    we identified 11 tools that use a dashboard. Fig. 14 illustrates example applications
    of dashboards in DSSs for agriculture. Notice how all five examples in this figure
    have a main interface from which various other visualisations can be accessed.
    For instance, Geovit (Terribile et al., 2017) (Fig. 14a), a dashboard designed
    for viticulture, provides diverse interactive components surrounding a heatmap,
    allowing instant access to various different features. Similarly, SmartScape (Tayyebi
    et al., 2016) (Fig. 14b), a spatial decision support system, uses a map together
    with a radar chart, histograms and various diverse interactive components. AgriSuit
    (Yalew et al., 2016) (Fig. 14c), tool for agricultural land suitability assessment,
    also uses a map which is augmented by heatmap and bar chart visualisations, surrounded
    by various interaction elements. HydroQual (Accorsi et al., 2014) (Fig. 14e),
    tool for visual analysis of river water quality, uses a clustering view together
    with a map and a pattern view. A vineyards management system, Vite.net (Rossi
    et al., 100 (2014)) (Fig. 14d), unlike the previous dashboards, does not use a
    map but rather a unique combination of progress bars, time-series, barometer,
    colour shades and decision tree. We discovered that dashboards in agriculture
    are substantially used in farm management and landscape assessment tasks, with
    some tools (e.g. HydroQual Accorsi et al., 2014) designed for the analysis of
    river water quality. It appears that the primary goal of dashboards is to show
    an overview map to users, which is logical given that landscape is an important
    part of farm management. As shown in Table 6, the majority of the tools that have
    a dashboard (9 out of 11) use 2D maps to provide an overview of the landscape.
    A few other familiar visualisations used in the dashboards include heatmaps (6
    tools), time-series (5 tools), a bar chart (2 tools), a histogram (1 tool), a
    radar chart (1 tool) and a pie chart (1 tool). We discovered that a few unique
    visualisations such as a cluster view, horizontal plots and a pattern view have
    also been used as part of a dashboard. Since dashboards are designed to provide
    a unified display to the decision-maker (Saket et al., 2019), we believe that
    the use of familiar visualisations is an important aspect of dashboards, especially
    because most end-users in agriculture are non-experts in visualisation and data
    analytics. Overall, the 11 tools that have a dashboard covered the following application
    domains: land suitability assessment, crop biomass analysis, crop control, wheat
    production, fertiliser management, pest control, dairy farming and vineyard management.
    For the other domains such as livestock management, aquaculture analysis, cotton
    production, rice production and soil-moisture analysis (see Table 4), various
    visualisation tools exist but a dashboard has yet to be introduced. We believe
    that many of such domains can also greatly benefit from a dashboard. Based on
    an analysis of various aspects of these dashboards, we highlight opportunities
    for future research in Section 4. 3.4. Interaction Interaction is an important
    aspect of visualisation tools since perception and understanding of complex data
    can be strongly influenced by the interactivity of a visualisation component (Zudilova-Seinstra
    et al., 2009). The benefits of visualising complex data arise from being able
    to better interact and understand data by aggregating, filtering, searching or
    scaling down relevant information. Examples of interactive visualisation components
    can be found in various agricultural DSSs. Thirty-one of the reviewed papers reported
    the use of interactive visualisations in their tools (see Table 6). Many of the
    reported interactive visualisations are included in dashboards, where visualisation
    components interact together to provide insights to user. ViPER (Oliver et al.,
    2017) is an example tool that provides an interactive drag-and-drop interface
    where users can explore livestock and examine “what-if?” scenarios. Moreover,
    AgriSuit (Yalew et al., 2016) provides an interface to allow a customised selection
    of weights based on user preferences to achieve better insights. Geovit (Terribile
    et al., 2017), provides an interactive dashboard that allows the selection of
    areas of interest: based on this selection, users can explore information about
    soil, climate and hydrology in real-time. 3.5. Tool type, platform and development
    status All 61 papers of this review present one or more visualisations which are
    designed to support various farming applications (e.g. irrigation scheduling,
    fertiliser application, etc.) and platforms (e.g. mobile and desktop). We found
    15 tools (see Table 7) that are designed to assist with decision support requirements
    by using a simulation approach. These tools allow farmers to walk-through simulated
    farming scenarios helping them explore and better understand their practices.
    On the other hand, we found 24 tools that have been designed for applications
    in real farming practices (i.e. non-simulation). These tools are designed to assist
    with decision support requirements for a particular real-world decision-making
    scenario, for example, irrigation scheduling or fertiliser application. Table

    while a number of tools have focused on individual farming practices such as irrigation
    scheduling or fertiliser application, only two out of the 61 tools used visualisations
    to support whole-farm planning. Whole-farm planning is a difficult task, and its
    practices are often delivered to farmers by technicians and experts.4 Whole-farm
    planning systems provide users with necessary tools for all the planning required
    for the whole farm, something farmers have to engage in nearly every day. We believe
    that future tools should provide farmers with various plug-and-play components
    allowing them to perform plannings for the whole farm or individual requirements.
    In addition, we found that many of the tools have been designed to support a particular
    device (i.e. desktop or mobile), with the exception of two tools (Tan et al.,
    2012, Mudisshu et al., 2016) that were designed for both mobile and desktop devices.
    Overall, 30 out of the 61 tools are desktop applications while only nine are mobile
    applications, out of which two are designed for both desktop and mobile devices.
    Clearly, the support for mobile devices has been considered less frequently. However,
    since the scale of agricultural operations has increased over the years, it is
    important that the tools are scalable and support multiple devices for on-the-fly
    access and in-field decision-making (Tan et al., 2012). Finally, we also discovered
    that while some of the tools (16 out of 61) are being used in practice, the majority
    of them (33 out of 61) are under the prototype stage (see Table 7 for details).
    Out of the two DSSs we discovered for whole-farm planning, only one (Cabrera et
    al., 2005) is currently available for end-users whereas the other one (Acutis
    et al., 2014) is at the prototype stage. Similarly for the tools that are designed
    for mobile devices, we found only one (Luvisi et al., 2011) that is currently
    available for end-users, which again supports the argument that more tools should
    consider support for multiple devices for flexible decision-making (Tan et al.,
    2012). 3.6. Data source Since PA is driven by data to support decision-making
    (Pham and Stack, 2018), the type of data collected and how they are utilised play
    an important role. We found various types of data that are being used amongst
    the DSSs reviewed in this paper. An overview of the different types of data together
    with the respective DSSs is presented in Table 8. Table 8. DSS categorised by

    41 69 21 7 33 13 3 10 11 8 2 2 5 5 5 13 7 7 7 3 We found that geographical data
    such as coordinates is the most widely used data type in agricultural visualisation.
    In total, we discovered 42 tools (i.e. 69%) that used it geographical data. This
    result is unsurprising, as we also discovered that maps are the most common type
    of visualisation in agriculture (see Section 3.3.1). In order to plot map visualisations,
    coordinates are vital. The second most common data types are soil and crop data,
    both having been used in 25 of the tools. it Soil data usually contains vital
    elements for crops such as potassium, calcium, phosphorous, nitrogen, iron, magnesium,
    zinc, copper and pH. it Crop data often contains growth rate, species and any
    other data that is related to the particular crop’s anatomy. Both it soil and
    crop data, separately or together, are often used to predict additional requirements
    for any given farm, which includes irrigation planning, fertiliser management,
    environmental management, etc. SmartScape (Tayyebi et al., 2016) (Fig. 12), for
    example, uses both data to evaluate and compare different crop change scenarios,
    assisting policymakers with their decisions. The third most commonly found data
    type is weather data. Our review has seen a total of 20 tools that use it weather
    data to provide decision support. Both soil and weather play an important role
    for crops development. They are also unpredictable as changes can occur rapidly
    and without warning. Soil chemicals, for example, can vary frequently depending
    on animal waste on the farm. Thus, many DSSs take into account these data. As
    we can see in Table 8, it weather and soil data are often measured by sensors.
    Following weather data, rainfall (13 tools) and it crop yield (14 tools) have
    been used most frequently. Rainfall, like weather data, is vital for crops. However,
    rainfall alone does not determine crop development; humidity, it soil temperature,
    etc. are also important for crops. Thus, weather data is more commonly used than
    rainfall alone. For instance, AquaGIS (Lorite et al., 2013) uses both rainfall
    and weather predictions to show water levels in an area of interest, allowing
    for selection of a field. it Crop yield, as seen in 14 tools, is often used as
    a metric to measure return and farm performance. In addition, four tools have
    also used economy data to be able to optimise resources and leverage profit. Next,
    we found that landscape data is also used as an input in 12 different DSSs. The
    ability to hold water, for example, is greatly defined by the shape of a landscape.
    This, in turn, has an impact on irrigation requirements of the farm. In a few
    cases, it irrigation data has also been used as an input for decision support.
    We discovered five tools that used irrigation data as an input. As discussed in
    Section 3.1.5, irrigation data is often used in irrigation management systems,
    together with additional data such as soil, location, crop type, rainfall and
    weather predictions (see Table 8). Similarly, there are tools designed for fertiliser
    management (7 tools) and live stock management (4 tools) which keep track of crop
    fertilisation and it live stock data, respectively. These management tools usually
    illustrate the current status of a farm, allowing farmers to keep track of the
    impact on crops and environment. ViPER (Oliver et al., 2017), for example, illustrates
    the risk of microbial pollution (e.g. E. Coli) on a land using livestock data.
    Pest control is also an important aspect of agriculture. However, we found only
    four tools that used it pest data for decision support with pest and disease control.
    Interestingly, the use of it pest data is only found in DSSs that are designed
    to assist with whole-farm management (e.g. Vite.net Rossi et al., 100 (2014) and
    MOTIFS Meul et al., 2008). Tools designed for other stakeholders in addition to
    farmers, such as farm advisers, agronomists, policymakers and academic researchers,
    tend to use different sets of data compared to those designed for farmers only.
    These data include: vegetation (8 tools), it water quality (6 tools), it water
    resources (4 tools), biomass (2 tools), it environmental risk (2 tools), it biological
    index (1 tool), pollution (1 tool), it flux data (1 tool) and it domain ontology
    (1 tool). However, as can be observed in Section 3.2, not many of the tools are
    designed for farm advisers, agronomists, policymakers and academic researchers;
    the majority of the tools are designed for farmers. 3.7. Uncertainty Large amounts
    of unstructured data and complex predictive models are known to lead to uncertainty
    (Daradkeh et al., 2010). Given the concerns regarding trust and technology adoption
    in PA, the study of uncertainty assessment through visualisation is relevant to
    our research (Marra et al., 2003). Visualisation mechanisms for communicating
    uncertainty have proven to be successful gaining trust particularly for non-expert
    users (Kay et al., 2016). The incorporation of uncertainty into the decision-making
    process is crucial for making decisions and maximising benefits (Daradkeh et al.,
    2017). Only two out of the 61 papers considered the communication of uncertainty
    through visualisation: CropGIS (Machwitz et al., 2019) and visualizeR (Frías et
    al., 2018). CropGIS (Machwitz et al., 2019) uses a time-series to show information
    about biomass development of maize with a range of uncertainty describing various
    meteorological scenarios (see Fig. 15a). visualizeR (Frías et al., 2018) uses
    a bubble plot together with a map to visualise seasonal forecasting of climate,
    where the colour and size of the bubble are used to encode different levels of
    probability (see Fig. 15b). Such uncertainty representations better reflect the
    reality compared to static forecasts, making the prediction more reliable for
    farmers. Download : Download high-res image (948KB) Download : Download full-size

    al., 2018) uses bubble plot to communicate uncertainty in climate change scenarios.
    3.8. Design and evaluation Despite the potential of visualisation, many approaches
    are poorly received by end-users, which is attributed to a lack of engagement
    in the design process of the tools (Whitman et al., 2015). To tackle this gap
    between complex scientific tools and more “user-friendly” systems, a human-centred
    approach is desired. In this review, we found a total of 11 articles that followed
    a user observation approach (see Table 9). The majority of these articles (10
    out of 11) also reported using questionnaires for evaluation. In total, we found
    12 articles that used questionnaires to evaluate their DSSs. Besides, we found
    that nine out of 61 articles reported using interviews as a feedback method during
    evaluation. Amongst these articles that used observations, questionnaires and
    interviews, only one (i.e. Geovisage Jarvis et al., 2017) reported the use of
    a qualitative analysis method, thematic analysis, to analyse feedback from end-users.
    Finally, we found four articles that declared the use of workshops to obtain feedback
    from end-users. Table 9. The visualisation tools categorised by evaluation methods

    used by end-users in the agriculture domain, with the purpose of gaining trust
    and technology acceptance, increasing adoption with end-users. However, only 11
    out of 61 articles reported using a participatory design approach. Meanwhile,
    three articles used a focus group approach during the design process, and four
    reported the use of an iterative design approach. 4. Discussion The results presented
    have many implications to consider for many future research directions. Here,
    we discuss the results around the research questions presented in Section 1. 4.1.
    RQ1: What visualisation techniques are being used across different domains in
    agriculture? As presented in Section 3.3, the vast majority of visualisations
    in agriculture used a 2D map to provide an overview of the landscape to the user
    with a few attempts of 3D maps to provide more detail about the terrain. On top
    of these maps, the use of heatmaps is relevant, which are often layered over the
    maps to highlight different kinds of data for the user. Time-series are commonly
    used to display information over time, such as daily data coming from sensors.
    Histograms are also often used to provide information coming from sensors to show
    the distribution of data over time. Clustering visualisations, radar and pie charts
    were used to compare metrics from data in the map. Dashboards are relevant since
    they provide immediate access to various interactive components to monitor and
    display data, offering a set of visual tools to the decision-maker for interaction
    and exploration. We also discovered that dashboards are being used in a wide variety
    of application domains such as land suitability assessment, crop biomass analysis,
    crop control, wheat production, fertiliser management, pest control, dairy farming
    and vineyard management. In a number of other domains that we looked at, such
    as livestock management, aquaculture analysis, cotton production, rice production
    and soil-moisture analysis (see Table 4), dashboards are not yet introduced. We
    believe that these domains (but not limited to) can also greatly benefit from
    a dashboard. Uncertainty visualisation is another aspect that many existing DSSs
    have ignored, but can unquestionably improve user understanding of the decisions
    provided by the system. The role of uncertainty visualisation is further discussed
    in RQ3. 4.2. RQ2: How are these visualisations being used by end-users to make
    decisions? Most of the applications discovered in this review are intended for
    farmers for various activities in the field, ranging from land suitability assessment
    to livestock and crop management. Some others are used by advisers and agronomists
    to provide feedback to farmers in their decision-making. A few of these applications
    are designed for policymakers who use systems to simulate conditions and plan
    ahead on how policies can affect particular environments. For instance, visualisation
    of crop status in maps allows the farmer to know the right amount of fertiliser,
    irrigation water or pesticide needed to achieve the optimum yield at a particular
    location within a parcel. Overall, three different types of DSSs were observed:
    those designed for a particular farming requirement, simulation and whole-farm
    management (see Section 3.5 for details). Unfortunately, while whole-farm management
    is a difficult task and is often engaged by farmers nearly every day, not many
    tools are currently available to support such a task. More tools should provide
    farmers with various plug-and-play components allowing them to perform planning
    for whole-farm management or individual farming requirements. Similarly, with
    the growth in agricultural operations over the years, we should consider designing
    tools that are scalable and support multiple devices (i.e. desktop and mobile)
    for on-the-fly access and in-field decision-making. 4.3. RQ3: What is the role
    of uncertainty in the visualisation tools that support decision-making? Despite
    the importance of illustrating uncertainty in visualisations, the agriculture
    domain has not yet seen many applications of uncertainty visualisations. In this
    review, only two tools reported communication of uncertainty through visualisation.
    We claim that representation of uncertainty provides higher reliability and better
    reflection about the reality, making predictions more reliable for end-users (Sacha
    et al., 2016) and producing high quality and informed decisions (Fernandes et
    al., 2018). While many of the DSSs analysed in this review presented visualisations
    to aid stakeholders in their decision-making, they often lack an appropriate representation
    of uncertainty, despite this being an essential part of the decision-making process.
    Moreover, uncertainty has to be represented in a way that corresponds to the user’s
    expectations and knowledge in a way that is easy to understand (Kwon et al., 2011).
    We believe that visualisation should be used to support the fundamental parts
    of the analysis, especially during uncertain scenarios, allowing users to control
    and evaluate data at all stages and empowering their decision-making process (John
    et al., 2015). Presentation of uncertainty to non-expert users can be helpful,
    but to maximise its effectiveness it must be displayed in a way that reveals its
    advantages to end-users (Kinkeldey et al., 2015). 4.4. RQ4: What is the role of
    HCI in the design and development of visualisation tools to support end-user decisions?
    As presented in Section 3.8, only a few tools included a report about the usability
    evaluation or a participatory design process. Although we have discovered a great
    amount of visualisation tools in agriculture, it is still a difficult task to
    select the most suitable visualisation and interaction techniques for end-users.
    Feedback from end-users is an important aspect in developing tools that are usable
    in practical settings (Saizmaa and Kim, 2008, Rose et al., 2018). A lack of uptake
    of agricultural DSSs has been noted previously by researchers as a major challenge
    in the field (Rose et al., 2018). The “problem of implementation” is based on
    the knowledge that participatory strategies during the design and development
    stages are the most critical factors to build technology adoption (Lindblom et
    al., 2017). In fact, there is a significant effort to adopt a more user-centred
    approach in the design of DSS applications (Parker, 1999). A user-centred approach
    in the design and development of DSSs has shown to have a positive influence,
    for instance, in crop production (Parker and Sinclair, 2001), being seen as a
    beneficial method for transferring knowledge from scientists to farmers. One of
    the main reasons on low adoption and acceptance is because most of the existing
    DSSs are based on what scientists and developers consider as the necessary knowledge
    that should be implemented in the tool, but in reality, they fail to capture the
    expertise and practical needs of the farmers. In this review, the System Usability
    Scale (SUS), focus groups and semi-structured interviews appeared in some of the
    design and development stages of applications. In particular, the case of VisAdapt
    presented a collaborative and interactive design process, leading to satisfactory
    results towards the development of the tool. Focus groups and semi-structured
    interviews are well-established methodologies for exploring perceptions and gathering
    ideas from the stakeholders which are developed as a result of the social and
    interactive nature of the process. 5. Limitations There are some limitations to
    this systematic review study that should be articulated. First, our included studies
    were limited to those written in English, meaning that relevant studies written
    in other languages may have been excluded. Second, even though an extensive scope
    search was conducted in scientific databases and most relevant journals of the
    agriculture domain, some relevant literature in other domains might have been
    excluded. Third, we may have missed some tools that are used in practice, but
    that are not reported in scientific literature. Finally, some of the categories
    we used in this review could not be clearly identified in the papers we analysed.
    For example, a few papers did not clearly state the development status of the
    tools being presented. 6. Conclusion This systematic review presents a comprehensive
    report on the use of visualisation techniques in the field of agriculture. We
    have discussed the most used visualisation techniques considering end-users, data
    sources, representation of uncertainty and evaluation methods. Based on this analysis,
    we have also provided design guidelines towards the implementation of interactive
    visual DSSs. We found that while the vast majority of applications are intended
    to use maps for visualisation together with satellite imagery, there is a significant
    opportunity of using dashboards to support farmers and advisers with more interactive
    components and dashboards to handle and interact with uncertain data. We also
    recommend the use of participatory design research, that has been successfully
    applied to increase the usability of applications for farmers. In addition, we
    highlight the role of representing uncertainty to increase user confidence and
    trust. The extensive body of analysed tools provide rich examples of how DSSs
    for agriculture can be designed on top of a variety of data sources involving
    different stakeholders in the design process, and representing both the data as
    well as underlying uncertainty to support informed decision making. We hope that
    this review will inspire and motivate many researchers and practitioners towards
    creating dashboards and visualisations following participatory research methods
    and uncertainty representations in future design and developments of agricultural
    DSSs. Acknowledgements Funding for this research has been provided by the European

    very critical when models present outcomes that do not fully match their expectations

    process to ensure that these tools respond to the needs of agricultural workers
    and can be quickly and easily made available to the interested parties. Concerns
    regarding the ‘black box’ approach to soil management, which ignores farmers’
    experience, have been voiced with regards to a variety of decision support tools
    [40–42] and should be avoided in the ICT-mediated smart farming approach at all
    cost. MFs represent a substantial draw on farmers’ financial resources [43]. Show

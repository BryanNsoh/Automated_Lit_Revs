  analysis: 'The paper investigates a long-range, low-power IoT-driven irrigation
    system that combines soil and weather data with ML algorithms to optimize crop
    irrigation. In the review of automated irrigation systems, this work is found
    to address important concerns including short-range communication, complex design,
    sparse knowledge-based ML approaches, and the omission of crucial agricultural
    metrics. The proposed method uses low-power, long-range wireless communication
    for soil data collection, an IoT-connected weather station for weather data collection,
    and cloud storage and monitoring of both datasets.


    The paper contributes to addressing the specified point within the context of
    the review by employing ML algorithms to anticipate irrigation needs based on
    a six-column dataset of weather and soil conditions. Six unique ML algorithms
    are used to process the data, with LDA producing the highest accuracy of 91.25%
    and being chosen as the best match for predicting the necessity for irrigation.


    Among the paper''s several strengths is its description of the created system,
    including details on the sensors, IoT weather station, and ML algorithms used.
    Additionally, the paper presents an analysis of the system''s effectiveness, including
    details on the dataset, algorithm testing, and precision irrigation decision support
    system results.


    Regrettably, the paper does not offer a comparison of the chosen ML algorithm
    with other popular ML techniques used in comparable irrigation prediction applications,
    which is one of its shortcomings. The paper might also benefit from giving more
    details about the system''s implementation, such as the hardware components used
    and the IoT cloud platform utilized.'

    Agriculture is the major portion of GDP in both developing\nand developed countries.\
    \ It has been estimated that the\nworld population will be about 10 billion by\
    \ 2050. To feed\nthe growing population always, food production requires to\n\
    be increased minimum by 70%. Sustainable agriculture\npractices are required in\
    \ agriculture and are keys to ensure\nfood security for growing population. Sustainable\
    \ agricul-\nture aims to enhance the overall agriculture productivity\ntowards\
    \ reducing the negative impact on environment due\nto less eﬃcient agriculture\
    \ practices. Smart agriculture\npractices tend to lack behind in research and\
    \ call for much\nresearch and development (R&D) to achieve goal of sus-\ntainable\
    \ agriculture. One of the areas in agriculture, which\nneeds much attention, is\
    \ irrigation. Extensive irrigation\nmakes use of 70% of the available freshwater\
    \ resources.\nInternet of 'ings (IoT) and machine learning (ML)-based\nsolution\
    \ may help in eﬃcient monitoring, controlling, and\nirrigation scheduling for\
    \ agriculture ﬁelds [1–7].\nMany IoT and ML-based irrigation systems have been\n\
    developed for monitoring and control application. One ir-\nrigation system developed\
    \ integrates sensors and energy\nmodule on the top of sprinkler. Another implementation\n\
    connects soil moisture sensor to Internet for monitoring soil\nmoisture [8], yet\
    \ another system designed for irrigation uses\nair temperature, humidity, and\
    \ air quality for irrigation\nscheduling and ML for data processing [6].\nGround\
    \ water is the main source of socio-economic\ndevelopment, but agriculture is\
    \ using major portion of\nHindawi\nSecurity and Communication Networks\nVolume\

    ground water for irrigation purpose. Since last two decades,\nboth artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ (AI) and ML are registering their\npresence in many application areas including\
    \ agriculture.\nML has been used for predicting river ﬂow and water quality\n\
    [9].\nWater management is of paramount importance due to\nits scarcity, and this\
    \ also aﬀects agriculture as major portion\nof fresh water is used for irrigation.\
    \ 'e various methods of\nirrigation as identiﬁed are drip irrigation, spray irrigation,\n\
    nebulizer irrigation, and most used form of irrigation in\nIndia, that is, ﬂood\
    \ irrigation. Soil moisture, humidity, and\ntemperature are some of the some of\
    \ the most observed\nagriculture parameters for irrigation planning. Mainly open-\n\
    source platforms, speciﬁcally Arduino, are utilized as main\nboard in various\
    \ systems developed for irrigation man-\nagement [10].\n'ere is a need of sustainable\
    \ agriculture with minimal\nimpact on environment and maximum productivity, to\
    \ feed\never growing population and monitor eﬃcient utilization of\navailable\
    \ limited fresh water in agriculture for irrigation.\nConventional less eﬃcient\
    \ irrigation practices, which focus\nof past research mainly on monitoring of\
    \ closed greenhouse\nenvironment with low-range technology, high initial cost\
    \ of\nweather monitoring systems, and negligible use of intelligent\nalgorithm\
    \ in irrigation management, has motivated authors\nto propose the present automated\
    \ irrigation systems. Recent\ndevelopments in IoT, wireless sensor networks (WSN),\n\
    information and communication technology (ICT), and ML\nhave further opened new\
    \ opportunities to researchers to-\nwards agriculture. Proper irrigation planning\
    \ aﬀects both\nquality and quantity of agriculture product. IoT and ML\nalong\
    \ with sensor network can facilitate farmers in proper\nirrigation planning and\
    \ eﬃcient utilization of irrigation\nwater.\nIn the present article, a low-cost\
    \ long-range irrigation\nsystem is proposed. 'e proposed system uses ML to predict\n\
    the irrigation requirement by crop. 'e main contributions\nof the present article\
    \ are as follows:\n(1) Long-range soil condition monitoring system. It\nconstitutes\
    \ as array of sensor with long-range\nwireless communication module to communicate\n\
    the soil conditions to weather station.\n(2) Low-cost IoT enables weather station\
    \ for weather\ncondition monitoring. Weather station collects the\nsoil conditions\
    \ from various soil sensor nodes and\ncollects the weather information from sensor\
    \ in-\nstalled on weather station.\n(3) Best ML algorithm for predicting when\
    \ to start\nirrigation.\n(4) IoT-based data storage and remote monitoring of\n\
    soil and weather conditions. Weather station with\nsoil and weather data sends\
    \ the data to IoT cloud for\nstorage and monitoring.\n'e system proposed identiﬁed\
    \ the various communi-\ncation technologies for their communication capabilities,\n\
    scalability and power consumption, and the suitable\nmember s selected for the\
    \ present proposed system. For\nmaking the system intelligent, ML is used, and\
    \ various al-\ngorithms employed in agricultural application are reviewed.\n'e\
    \ review of ML in agriculture provided the most deployed\nalgorithms for agricultural\
    \ application, and based on their\nperformance, the system used linear discriminant\
    \ analysis\n(LDA) for irrigation requirement for decision-making. 'e\nirrigation\
    \ requirement is aﬀected by the weather and soil\nparameters carefully selected\
    \ through extensive literature\nreview. 'e selected soil and weather parameters\
    \ are sensed\nthrough various sensors and are communications to cloud\nfor monitoring.\n\
    'e present article is divided into diﬀerent sections and\nsubsections to present\
    \ the concept and proposed system.\nSection 2 presents the state-of-the-art study,\
    \ identiﬁes the\npresent work on ML, and uses of ML in agriculture, pre-\ncision\
    \ irrigation, and the challenges with the past automated\nirrigation systems.\
    \ Section 3 presents the design of the\nproposed irrigation system and provides\
    \ the testing result\nand data captured by the developed system and thereafter.\n\
    Section 4 provides the ML algorithm with for irrigation\nprediction. In the end,\
    \ Section 5 concludes the ﬁndings of\nthe proposed work.\n'e present study is\
    \ important as the proposed system\nutilizes both soil and weather conditions\
    \ for irrigation\nplanning to come up with eﬃcient irrigation water utili-\nzation\
    \ strategy in agriculture. Other than farmland irrigation\nplanning, the study\
    \ also contributes towards improving the\neconomic condition of farmers by reducing\
    \ higher manual\nsupervision cost and minimizing the negative impact on\nenvironment\
    \ such as freshwater resource pollution and\nchange in soil properties due to\
    \ less eﬃcient irrigation\npractices. IoTand long-range, low-power WSN are the\
    \ most\nadvance technologies in the proposed system and use of ML\nalgorithm that\
    \ makes the system much eﬀective with pre-\ndictive irrigation scheduling.\n2.\
    \ Literature Survey\n'is section presents the status of research in automated\n\
    irrigation\nsystems\nand\nuse\nof\nmachine\nlearning\nin\nagriculture.\n2.1. Machine\
    \ Learning. In ML, data-driven prediction is\ndone by programming the system.\
    \ ML computers are\nequipped with human learning capabilities to learn from\n\
    experience, acquire new knowledge, and improve system\nperformance. Basic elements\
    \ of ML system are raw data, data\npreprocessing, ML algorithms, generalization,\
    \ and decision-\nmaking [11, 12].\nOne of the important applications of ML is\
    \ data mining.\n'e article [13] discussed the supervised learning algorithms\n\
    in ML, and decision tree, neural networks, and instance-\nbased learning are some\
    \ of the important supervised\nlearning algorithms. ML learning is faster in making\
    \ deci-\nsion as compared to humans. 'e various methods of\nlearning as described\
    \ in article are role learning, analog\nlearning, and knowledge discovery. Various\
    \ applications of\n2\nSecurity and Communication Networks\nRETRACTED\nML are ﬁnance,\
    \ telecommunication, marketing, and analysis\nof network [14].\nML is a subbranch\
    \ of AI and gives machines the ca-\npability to learn from experience. ML is quite\
    \ diﬀerent from\nstatistic method, which is based on likelihood, whereas the\n\
    ML provides solution based on certain set of rules. Machine\nlearning gains knowledge\
    \ in the form of experience gathered\nfrom historical data. ML techniques are\
    \ mainly categorized\nin three categories, namely, supervised, unsupervised, and\n\
    reinforcement learning. Classiﬁcation and regression falls\nunder supervised learning,\
    \ while cluster, anomaly detection,\nand dimensionality reduction are the applications\
    \ of un-\nsupervised learning [15, 16].\n2.2. Machine Learning in Precision Agriculture.\
    \ PA also\ncalled digital farming is the technology-driven farm man-\nagement\
    \ system. PA focused on reducing the production\ncost and eﬀect on environment\
    \ while increasing the proﬁt of\nfarmers. ML and IoT are the essential element\
    \ of future\nfarming. Deploying ML in agriculture helps in controlling,\noptimizing\
    \ farm practices, and predicting the weather and\nrainfall. 'e various areas exploiting\
    \ ML are predicting\nweather conditions, soil properties, and crop yield [12].\n\
    In agriculture and other applications, ML oﬀers com-\nputational and analytical\
    \ solutions to diﬀerent types of\ndatasets. Deploying ML for agriculture is quite\
    \ tedious due\nto unavailability of data collecting equipment and un-\navailability\
    \ of trained manpower to handle the collected\ndata. Agriculture yield gets aﬀected\
    \ by many parameters,\nand some of the important parameters are fertility of soil,\n\
    climatic conditions, water availability, pests, and crop dis-\nease. Rainfall,\
    \ wind speed, solar radiations, heat ﬂux,\nevapotranspiration, and temperature\
    \ are few of the major\nfactors aﬀecting the crop yield [15].\nIoT, WSN, and ICT\
    \ have potential to take care of the\nvarious challenges posed to agriculture.\
    \ AI has been\ndeployed for weather, water usage monitoring, energy, and\nsoil\
    \ health analysis. AI can be helpful in training robots for\nharvesting and other\
    \ similar kinds of labour-intensive ag-\nricultural activities. ML is a branch\
    \ of AI and, along with\nICT, is used for smarter data analysis. ML has been used\
    \ in\ncrop management, livestock management, soil management,\nand water management.\
    \ ML does help in predicting crop\nyield, weed detection, and phenotype classiﬁcation.\
    \ 'e use\nof AI, IoT, robotics, and WSN is on upswing in agriculture\napplications.\
    \ Recent advances in IoT, WSN, and ICT have\nfurther triggered their deployment\
    \ in agriculture. With AI,\nweather conditions, water usage, and soil condition\
    \ can be\nanalysed by farmers for better decision [16].\n'e various agricultural\
    \ practices where technology is\nplaying an important role are animal welfare,\
    \ livestock\nmanagement, yield prediction, disease detection, weed de-\ntection,\
    \ crop quality, species recognition, water manage-\nment, and soil management.\
    \ Only 10% of the research has\nfocus on water management, and more than 61% of\
    \ the\nresearch has been focused on crop management. Moreover,\nwater management,\
    \ that is, water quality and irrigation,\nplays an important role in crop management.\
    \ 'e various\nagricultural areas getting beneﬁtted from ML are crop yield\nprediction,\
    \ crop disease detection, crop weed detection,\nlivestock welfare, and many more\
    \ as summarized in Figure 1.\nSupport vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbour\n\
    (KNN), and Gaussian naive Bayes (NB) are some of the ML\nalgorithms, which are\
    \ used in majority of the agriculture\npractices [17].\nRemote sensing such as\
    \ satellite and photography is also\nused to build better decisive system in precision\
    \ agriculture.\n'e aim of the precision agriculture is to reduce the pro-\nduction\
    \ cost and impact on environment. Weather condi-\ntions, soil properties, irrigation,\
    \ and fertilization are some of\nthe parameters aﬀecting the crop yield. Much\
    \ attention is\ngiven to ML as being able to process data from various\nsources\
    \ and can work with nonlinear data. ML needs\nminimal or no human intervention\
    \ and incorporates better\nknowledge-based system. ML has been used for detecting\n\
    biotic stress of crop, disease detection in crops, determining\nphysiological\
    \ and structural properties of plant, and sug-\ngesting automatic irrigation.\
    \ SVM and KNN are the two ML\nalgorithms used extensively in various agriculture\
    \ applica-\ntions [18].\n2.3. Precision Irrigation Models and Challenges. Traditional\n\
    irrigation practices result in excessive application of water\nresulting in ﬁeld\
    \ runoﬀ and pollution in freshwater re-\nsources. A ML-based algorithm is built\
    \ with the gathered\ndataset to predict the allowable time for irrigation. Five\n\
    diﬀerent ML algorithms were compared based on mean\nsquare error. Ridge regression\
    \ oﬀers the least mean square\nerror and has been selected as the best match for\
    \ irrigation\nprediction [19].\nAgriculture sector particularly for irrigation\
    \ consumes\nmajority of the fresh water. Scarcity of fresh water and use of\n\
    traditional less eﬃcient irrigation practices in agriculture has\nignited the\
    \ use of advanced and intelligent technologies for\nirrigation monitoring, controlling,\
    \ and scheduling. IoT and\nML are oﬀering the better techniques in developing\
    \ intel-\nligent solutions for irrigation. An intelligent irrigation\nsystem is\
    \ developed using Arduino and Raspberry Pi. Soil\ntemperature, humidity, UV radiations,\
    \ and air temperature\nare the parameters observed for the developed irrigation\n\
    monitoring and control system. For communicating the\nmeasured parameters, short-range\
    \ communication tech-\nnology ZigBee has been deployed. HTTP-based web server\n\
    and IoT-controlled water pump are the other elements of the\ndeveloped intelligent\
    \ system. Soil moisture and need of\nirrigation are predicted by applying SVM\
    \ and KNN ML\nalgorithms to soil temperature, humidity, UV radiations,\nand air\
    \ temperature, which measured through sensors with\nweather forecast information\
    \ [20].\nIoT along with WSN, mobile computing, and intelligent\nagricultural machinery\
    \ has succoured farmers to adopt\nvarious PA practices. An irrigation control\
    \ system is de-\nveloped using data from twenty-two soil sensors for a period\n\
    of two years to develop ML algorithm. Various regression\nand classiﬁcation methods\
    \ were applied to the dataset. Out\nof the ML algorithms selected, Gradient Boost\
    \ Regression\nSecurity and Communication Networks\n3\nRETRACTED\ngave 93% of accuracy\
    \ in prediction and the best performance\nwas given by Boosted Tree Classiﬁer\
    \ with 95% of accuracy in\npredicting the irrigation requirement. Evapotranspiration,\n\
    the indirect method for estimating the crop’s water need,\nwas used to estimate\
    \ the irrigation requirement using wind\nspeed, humidity, and solar radiations\
    \ to measure through\nsensors [21].\nEighty-ﬁve percentage (85%) of fresh water\
    \ is utilized by\nagriculture particularly for irrigation [22]. For the eﬃcient\n\
    use of fresh water in agriculture, intelligent IoT-based ir-\nrigation systems\
    \ are required for monitoring, controlling,\nand scheduling of irrigation. Based\
    \ on short-range com-\nmunication technology, AI, ML, and remote sensing, dif-\n\
    ferent intelligent irrigation models have been developed.\nFew of the developed\
    \ smart solutions of irrigation are\nsummarized in Table 1. In Table 1, the last\
    \ column also\nprovides the challenges in the developed system, which\nneeds to\
    \ be addressed to develop a better solution for in-\ntelligent irrigation system.\n\
    3. System Design and Testing\nAs mentioned in Table 1, the challenges faced with\
    \ present\nautomated irrigation systems are short range, complex de-\nsign, limited\
    \ use of knowledge-based ML techniques, and\nﬁltering out of certain important\
    \ agriculture parameters. 'e\nsystem proposed in the present article focuses to\
    \ address\nmajority of the challenges. 'e proposed intelligent irriga-\ntion system\
    \ comprises soil monitoring sensor nodes, IoT-\nconnected weather station, IoT\
    \ cloud for data storage and\nmonitoring, and ML algorithms for the prediction\
    \ of irri-\ngation need. 'e agriculture parameters observed, as\nidentiﬁed from\
    \ literature survey section, for proposed ir-\nrigation decision support system,\
    \ which are soil tempera-\nture, soil moisture, air temperature, relative humidity,\
    \ wind\nspeed, and wind direction.\nPutting together Internet of 'ings (IoT) which\
    \ is\nscalable long-range, low-power wireless communication,\nand machine learning\
    \ algorithm in the proposed system\nmake it more advanced and reliable. System\
    \ uses multiple\nsoil sensor nodes for farmland monitoring. Soil sensor nodes\n\
    are equipped with soil moisture sensor, soil temperature\nsensor, and LoRa wireless\
    \ communicating module. With the\nLoRa technology, soil sensor nodes can be installed\
    \ upto a\nrange of 1 km to 1.5 km [28–30], although the module\ndeployed claims\
    \ range upto 8 km and enables to monitor the\nlarger farmland.\nWeather station\
    \ other than capturing the local weather\nconditions also acts as a central unit\
    \ between IoT cloud and\nsoil sensor nodes. Weather station observes air temperature,\n\
    relative humidity, wind speed, and wind direction. Weather\nand soil conditions\
    \ (from soil sensor nodes) are sent to IoT\ncloud for storage and monitoring.\
    \ 'ingSpeak IoT cloud is\nused being available with no cost for upto 8 channels\
    \ and\nprovides good data visualization in graphical form. Figure 2\ngives the\
    \ block diagram of the proposed system.\n'e system is tested with two soil sensor\
    \ nodes, as shown\nin Figure 3, and weather station, as shown in Figure 4.\n'e\
    \ weather station uploads the soil and weather con-\ndition data to 'ingSpeak\
    \ IoT cloud. 'ingSpeak IoT cloud\nprovides data visualization in graphical form,\
    \ and data\nuploaded can be downloaded in “.csv” form for analysis. 'e\nmobile\
    \ interface for data visualization is shown in Figure 5.\n'e captured weather\
    \ station data are compared with the\nweather data from https://www.worldweatheronline.com\
    \ as\nshown in Tables 2 and 3.\nFrom the three days of observation, maximum diﬀerence\n\
    in temperature from the two sources of data was 1.4°C. For\nhumidity, the diﬀerence\
    \ between the two sources of data was\nmeasured as 2% and wind speed diﬀers by\
    \ maximum of\n1 kmph. 'e developed system performs satisfactorily, as the\nobserved\
    \ data in within the limits of sensors [10].\n4. Machine Learning Modelling for\n\
    Precision Irrigation\n'e dataset contains 500 observations of soil and weather\n\
    conditions (100 rows and 5 columns), with 100 entries for\neach observed parameter.\
    \ “AirTemperature,” “Humidity,”\n“WindSpeed,” “Volumetric Moisture Content (VMC),”\
    \ and\n“SoilTemperature” are the ﬁve columns of measurement for\nsoil and weather\
    \ conditions, respectively. 'e data store is\nexpanded to include a sixth column,\
    \ “Decision,” which\ncontains 0 s and 1 s depending on whether irrigation is\n\
    necessary or not based on soil and weather conditions suited\nfor rice and wheat\
    \ [31–33]. Figure 6 depicts the various\ncharacteristics of the libraries utilized\
    \ to execute ML\nalgorithms.\nSix diﬀerent ML algorithms are applied to the weather\n\
    and soil information in order to discover the best ML\ntechniques for the current\
    \ application. Machine learning\ntechniques such as linear logistic regression\
    \ (LR) and\nnonlinear K-nearest neighbour (KNN), classiﬁcation and\nregression\

    \ world\npopulation needs modernization of agriculture. For food\nsecurity to\
    \ increased population, reducing impact on en-\nvironment and eﬃcient utilization\
    \ of irrigation water ag-\nriculture needs to adapt modern technologies. IoT,\
    \ ICT,\nWSN, and ML provide intelligent solutions to agriculture\npractices including\
    \ irrigation. Many irrigation models have\nbeen developed, but they neglect one\
    \ or the other important\naspects of either technology or agriculture. An advanced\n\
    knowledge-based long-range scalable irrigation decision\nsupport system is proposed\
    \ in the present paper. 'e pro-\nposed design tries to address some, or all the\
    \ challenges faced\nin present automated irrigation systems and providing the\n\
    cost-eﬀective solution. 'e cost comparison of developed\nweather station with\
    \ some of the available commercial\nweather stations is provided in Table 5. Weather\
    \ stations\nwith the cost of eve as high as Rs 32500/- are not supported\nwith\
    \ IoT. 'e weather station developed for the proposed\nsystem cost 50%–60% less\
    \ than as mentioned weather sta-\ntions in Table 5.\nWeather and soil conditions\
    \ are observed for the\nproposed irrigation support system. 'e use of scalable\n\
    long-range, low-power communication technology in\nsoil sensor nodes gives systems\
    \ the ability to monitor\nlarger ﬁelds with more accuracy. IoT cloud is used for\n\
    weather and soil data visualization eliminating the re-\nquirement of local storage\
    \ and display. Knowledge-based\nML technique is used for making decision regarding\n\
    irrigation. Six diﬀerent linear and nonlinear ML algo-\nrithms are used with the\
    \ observed dataset, and their\naccuracy in predicting irrigation is calculated.\
    \ 'e best\neﬃciency of 91.25% was observed with LDA algorithm.\nAfter selecting\
    \ the eﬃcient ML algorithm, the selected\nalgorithm is tested for the diﬀerent\
    \ soil and weather\nconditions for decision-making. 'e intelligent irrigation\n\
    decisive support system was successfully able to monitor\nsoil and weather condition\
    \ of farmland using IoT and\nmakes correct decision regarding irrigation.\nData\

  analysis: 'This paper presents a wireless system for irrigation management in smart
    farming using a fuzzy logic strategy integrated with a WSN-based monitoring system.
    While the paper primarily focuses on the actuation and control aspects of irrigation,
    it acknowledges the importance of data collection and processing in the overall
    irrigation management system.


    The paper provides a brief overview of the data acquisition process, highlighting
    the use of wireless sensor nodes for real-time soil parameter monitoring. The
    authors emphasize the advantages of wireless sensor networks, such as scalability,
    low cost, and multi-sensing capabilities, in enabling precision irrigation.


    However, the paper does not delve deeply into the specifics of data volume, frequency,

    adaptive irrigation scheduling based on real-time soil and weather data.


    Therefore, while the paper touches on the broader context of irrigation management

    PDF TOOLS SHARE ABSTRACT This work is aimed at presenting the water saving potentialities
    of a scalable smart irrigation system applied to precision agriculture. A fuzzy
    logic strategy is integrated in a distributed monitoring system based on the wireless
    sensor network technology. The optimal irrigation schedule is adaptively estimated
    according to the real-time measurement of the soil status and the weather conditions.
    The objective of the system is to optimize the water content in the soil to (i)
    maximize the health status of the plants, (ii) improve the quality of the products,
    and (iii) reduce the waste of water. The proposed system has been prototyped and
    experimentally validated in an apple orchard, close to the city of Trento, in
    the north of Italy. The performances of the proposed system are compared with
    those of a standard irrigation scheduler to point out the amount of saved water
    as well as the improved stability of the soil moisture level. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals,
    Inc. Microwave Opt Technol Lett 58:2186–2189, 2016 1 INTRODUCTION The irrigation
    in agriculture considerably impacts on the global water consumption (up to 80–90%
    in the developed countries), and the water withdrawal is expected to increase
    by 20% before 2050 1. A more efficient exploitation of water resources is mandatory
    to guarantee the sustainable food production for the fast growing world population
    2. The information and communication technologies have been recognized as fundamental
    tools to support the technological advancements in the management of the agricultural
    processes. In this framework, the wireless sensor network (WSN) technology 3 has
    been applied to enable the distributed monitoring of different physical parameters.
    The WSN properties such as the scalability, low-cost, self-configurability, and
    multi-sensing have stimulated the diffusion of small and low-power wireless sensors
    to implement the so-called “precision agriculture” 4-6. However, even if the sensing
    technologies and their integration in embedded wireless devices are available
    in the state-of-the-art (also commercial products exist nowadays), advanced methodologies
    for the sensor data processing and for the adaptive control of the irrigation
    systems have been less investigated. To the best of the author''s knowledge, the
    actuation strategies are limited to preliminary studies or to proprietary and
    customized management software, often calibrated for specific irrigation modalities
    and equipment. The dissemination of research results as well as their critical
    analysis and comparison with the performance of standard irrigation methods is
    only partially documented. In this paper, an actuation strategy based on the fuzzy
    logic 7 for the unsupervised estimation of the optimal irrigation schedule is
    proposed. The heuristically defined rules have been defined starting from the
    empirical knowledge of expert farmers in order to adaptively apply the human experience
    to the time-varying conditions of the monitored field. The real-time and distributed
    acquisition of the soil parameters is performed by the wireless nodes of a WSN-based
    measurement system, while the irrigation is managed by a set of wireless actuator
    nodes, which control the valves according to the output of the fuzzy logic. The
    system prototype has been deployed in an apple orchard for experimental validation.
    A selected set of experimental results are reported and discussed to show the
    improved quality of the irrigation obtained with the proposed approach, which
    has led to a better soil condition in comparison to the one achieved by a standard
    irrigation method based on a fixed daily schedule. 2 MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION
    Let us consider a set of K = N + M wireless nodes, N and M being the sensing (Fig.
    1) and actuation (Fig. 2) nodes, respectively, deployed in known and fixed positions
    rk, k =1,…,K, within the monitored area Ω. Each sensing node is equipped with
    multiple sensors for the acquisition of the soil temperature τ(n), n = 1,…,N,
    and the soil humidity h(n) (dp), where dp, p = 1,…,P, are the depths of the buried
    sensors. The wireless nodes are interconnected by means of radio-frequency links
    (f being the working frequency of the IEEE802.15.4 transceivers) to enable the
    collection of the sensor data towards the control unit, and the transmission of
    the irrigation commands to the actuation nodes. Each actuation node is interconnected
    to an irrigation valve, which controls the sprinklers installed in different spatial
    sub-domains Ωm, m = 1,…,M. The irrigation commands sent to each actuation node
    are independent and evaluated according to the status of the culture within the
    different sub-domains. Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Sensing device—Smart
    wireless sensor with multiple soil probes. [Color figure can be viewed in the
    online issue, which is available at wileyonlinelibrary.com.] Figure 2 Open in
    figure viewer PowerPoint Actuation device—Irrigation valve controlled by the WSN
    actuator node. [Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available
    at wileyonlinelibrary.com.] The default status of the irrigation valves is “closed”
    and changes to “open” for the irrigation time α(m) (t), m = 1,…,M, computed by
    the fuzzy logic at the time instant t. The computation of the irrigation time
    is iteratively repeated at the discrete time instants tz =t0 +zΔt, z = 0,…,Z −
    1, where Δt is the time interval. Each irrigation time α(m) (t) is evaluated as
    (1) where Sm, m = 1,…,M, are the subset of nodes located in rn ∊Ωm, m = 1,…,M,
    n = 1,…,N. The proposed fuzzy logic strategy is implemented following the block
    scheme shown in Figure 3. First, the humidity measured ad different depths are
    averaged to obtain a single representative value of the soil moisture in rn, n
    = 1,…,N. Successively, such a value is compared with the desired humidity threshold
    hth. Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Block scheme of the proposed fuzzy
    logic strategy. [Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available
    at wileyonlinelibrary.com.] The differential value Δh(n) together with the soil
    temperature τ(n) are used as inputs of the fuzzy logic system, which operates
    according to a set of predefined rules, composed by Γi, i = 1,…,I antecedents
    and Λ j, j = 1,…,J relative consequences, as described in Ref. 8. Gaussian membership
    functions ψ(·) are associated to the input samples and the fuzzifier process is
    applied to evaluate the degree of similarity with the antecedents. Finally, the
    output of the defuzzifier provides the irrigation time α(n) evaluated as the center
    of the activated areas of the consequences. 3 EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION A set of
    K = 30 (N= 27 and M = 3) nodes have been manufactured and deployed in a real test
    field within an apple orchard of size 5000 [m2]. The irrigation system has been
    divided in three sub-domains Ωm, m = 1,…,M, M = 3, in order to compare the proposed
    fuzzy logic strategy applied in the zone Ω1, with the standard irrigation schedule
    (zone Ω2) and the absence of irrigation in zone Ω3. Each sensing node has P =
    3 humidity sensors, buried at the depths d1 =0.2[m], d2 = 0.5 [m], and d3 = 0.8[m],
    and one soil temperature sensor. The data acquisition and transmission (the working
    frequency of the IEEE802.15.4-compliant transceivers is f = 868 [MHz]) is iterated
    with time interval Δt = 600 [s]. The humidity threshold is set to hth =30 [%].
    Besides the WSN infrastructure, a weather station equipped with a rain gauge has
    been installed in the proximity of the test field to take in consideration the
    effects of the rain level ρ on the soil humidity. Concerning the fuzzy logic,
    a customized combination of I = 6 triangular, trapezoidal, and Gaussian antecedents
    Γi (Δh,τ) (Δh ranging from Extremely Dry to DUmp [Fig. 4(a)], and τ from Very
    Cold to WArm [Fig. 4(b)]) and J = 5 triangular consequences Λj(Δh, τ) (α (n) from
    Null to Long [Fig. 4(c)]) have been configured according to the suggestions of
    the expert farmers involved in the irrigation management. Figure 4 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Fuzzy logic rules—Antecedents for humidity (a) and temperature
    (b), and consequences (c). [Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which
    is available at wileyonlinelibrary.com.] The measurement campaign has been performed
    both in autumn and in summer periods. For the sake of brevity, a representative
    week (Z = 1152 acquisitions) during the summer period has been selected to analyse
    the daily performance of the system in presence of time-varying weather conditions.
    Figure 5 shows the soil status in the three sub-domains of the apple orchard,
    where the three different irrigation strategies have been applied: r20 (no irrigation),
    r14 (standard irrigation), and r5 (fuzzy logic strategy). Three rain events happened
    during the selected days and the soil moisture level changed accordingly, as clearly
    shown in Figure 55a). The absence of irrigation in highlighted the very high correlation
    between the soil humidity and the rain. The humidity rapidly increased from low
    values ( ) up to short and isolated peaks ( ), and decreased according to the
    soil evapotranspiration. Concerning the effects of the standard irrigation schedule,
    a higher soil humidity has been measured in r14 [Fig. 5(b)], as expected. In the
    sub-domain Ω2, the valve of the actuator m = 2 has been opened every day for a
    fixed time slot and provided a constant irrigation time αstd, regardless the weather
    and soil conditions. Figure 5(b) clearly points out that the humidity is higher
    than the desired threshold, especially during the rain events, since any adaptive
    calibration of the irrigation time has been considered. Figure 5 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Experimental validation without irrigation (a), with standard
    irrigation schedule (b), and with the proposed fuzzy logic strategy (c). [Color
    figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available at wileyonlinelibrary.com.]
    In order to assess the performance of the proposed fuzzy-based irrigation strategy,
    the indicator has been defined as (2) where 0 ≤ α (tz) ≤ α std. Lower values of
    σ(n) indicate that a more stable soil humidity is obtained with a lower quantity
    of water, and this reflects in a higher irrigation efficiency. Such an indicator
    has been evaluated for the standard and fuzzy-based irrigation approaches, the
    value σ(14) =0.56 has been obtained with the standard irrigation, while the proposed
    fuzzy logic strategy reached a lower value σ(5) =0.15. As shown in Figure 5(c),
    the adaptive control of the irrigation time has guaranteed a higher stability
    of soil humidity, which is closer to the reference value hth even in presence
    of time-varying weather conditions. 4 CONCLUSION In this letter, a wireless system
    for the advanced management of the irrigation in smart farming applications has
    been presented. A customized methodology based on a fuzzy logic strategy has been
    integrated in a WSN-based sensing and actuation system for the adaptive evaluation
    of the best irrigation time. The proposed solution has been experimentally validated
    in an apple orchard and the irrigation efficiency has been improved more than
    40 [%] respect to the standard irrigation approach. The obtained results pointed
    out a more accurate exploitation of the irrigation water with positive effects
    on the stability of the soil moisture level, which reflects on the health status
    of the crops and the quality of the products. REFERENCES Citing Literature Volume58,

  analysis: 'This study introduces an interoperable IP-based wireless sensor network
    (WSN) architecture for smart irrigation systems. The architecture leverages the
    Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm and IPv6 over Low Power Wireless Personal Area
    Network (6LoWPAN) protocols. The study evaluates the performance of this network
    in terms of round-trip time (RTT), packet loss, and energy consumption. The results
    indicate that RTT and packet loss increase with the number of hops and packet
    size due to environmental noise and link quality issues. The paper also examines
    the radio duty cycle (RDC) as a lifetime indicator of sensors, with lower RDC
    indicating less power consumption and longer sensor lifetime.


    This paper is very relevant to the point of considerations regarding volume, frequency,
    format, and source of the data within the context of the literature review. It
    provides valuable insights into the performance of an interoperable IP-based WSN
    architecture for smart irrigation systems, including the impact of hop count,
    packet size, and link quality on RTT, packet loss, and energy consumption. However,
    it lacks in-depth analysis of the frequency, volume, and format of data generated
    by the WSN architecture and does not provide any specific recommendations or solutions
    for optimizing data management.


    This study has several limitations. First, it does not consider the impact of
    different soil types and crop water requirements on irrigation scheduling. Second,
    it does not evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the soil moisture sensors
    used in the WSN architecture. Third, it does not provide a detailed analysis of
    the security and privacy implications of using an IP-based WSN architecture for
    smart irrigation systems.


    Overall, the paper contributes to the broader literature on automated irrigation
    management systems by demonstrating the feasibility of using an interoperable,
    IP-based WSN architecture to monitor soil moisture and control irrigation systems.
    The findings have implications for researchers and practitioners working in the
    field of precision agriculture and can inform the design and implementation of
    future smart irrigation systems.'

    Keywords Metrics Abstract: Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) have been highly developed
    which can be used in agriculture to enable optimal irrigation scheduling. Since
    there is an absence of widely used available methods to support effective agriculture
    practice in different weather conditions, WSN technology can be used to optimise
    irrigation in the crop fields. This paper presents architecture of an irrigation
    system by incorporating interoperable IP based WSN, which uses the protocol stacks
    and standard of the Internet of Things paradigm. The performance of fundamental
    issues of this network is emulated in Tmote Sky for 6LoWPAN over IEEE 802.15.4
    radio link using the Contiki OS and the Cooja simulator. The simulated results
    of the performance of the WSN architecture presents the Round Trip Time (RTT)
    as well as the packet loss of different packet size. In addition, the average
    power consumption and the radio duty cyde of the sensors are studied. This will
    facilitate the deployment of a scalable and interoperable multi hop WSN, positioning
    of border router and to manage power consumption of the sensors. Notes: This article

    Las Vegas, NV, USA SECTION I. Introduction Shortage of fresh water is a common
    problem in the world. The demand for water supplies is expected to increase due
    to population growth; food demand needs, and changes in water availability. Irrigation
    is a primary user of freshwater, with the Food and Agricultural Organization of
    the United Nations (FAO, 2014) reporting that 70% of freshwater in the world is
    used for irrigation purposes. Irrigation is expected to be much more crucial for
    the food production in the near future, as most probable climate change scenarios
    predict large water deficits in certain areas in the world. Irrigation holds the
    most promise for increasing food productivity and security, provided it is managed
    efficiently. Also irrigation consumes large quantities of energy, which is a crucial
    constraint for development. To better manage the competing demands for water,
    agricultural policies will have to make water efficiency a priority. Hence the
    scientific and technology based irrigation scheduling of water is one of the ways
    to improve the irrigation processes to optimize the use of water and energy consumption.
    The incorporation of sensors in the context of agricultural production for water
    management and conservation has concerned an increasing interest for establishing
    irrigation management strategies. The use of water for agricultural production
    in water scarcity regions requires innovative and sustainable research and an
    appropriate transfer of technologies. Moreover, food security is an important
    issue since systems aiming at ensuring optimal production of crops form a vital
    part of any country''s overall security system. Ubiquitous and pervasive computing
    are key technologies significantly contributing to the advent of IoT. They bring
    computation capability to physical objects, which can communicate, in the Internet
    by producing, consuming, and computing information. WSNs are a prevalent instance
    of ubiquitous computing that enables small things to connect to the Internet.
    Sensor networks today are sensing and computing environmental phenomena and thus
    such a WSN can be used in real time application like irrigation scheduling. In
    reality these types of networks are heterogeneous by nature, arises from the fact
    that there are different types of WSN devices that do not use the same standards.
    The migration of WSN communication towards an all-IP mode, eliminate most of the
    heterogeneity. The Internet is smoothly migrating from an Internet of people towards
    an Internet of Things (IoT). Such a migration induces a strong level of complexity
    when handling interoperability between the heterogeneous IoT and also these types
    of networks are low power and lossy network. To support the connectivity, interoperability
    ad compatibility of heterogeneous WSN, IPv6 over Low Power Wireless Personal Area
    Network (6LoWPAN) was proposed by the IETF working group. Therefore the system
    proposed in this paper uses the wireless sensor networks and the architecture
    of Internet of things, allowing the users to analyze the moisture level of the
    field obtained by the array of sensors from any smart device in efficient way
    to take the decision of irrigation scheduling. This paper presents a multi hop
    WSN for smart irrigation scheduling that relies on 6LoWPAN, RPL and IEEE 802.15.4g
    protocols along with the performance evaluation of the WSN in terms of round trip
    time, packet loss and radio duty cycles of the sensors. The remainder of this
    paper is organized in the following way: Section 2 covers related work, whereas
    Section 3 presents our proposed system architecture. Section 4 includes details
    on our prototype design, while Section 5 conveys information about the simulations
    performed. Section 6 presents our results and the analysis performed, while Section
    7 finally concludes the paper and indicates future work. SECTION II. Related Work
    In GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication) based automated irrigation control
    using rain gun [1] irrigation will take place only when there will be intense
    requirement of water that save a large quantity of water. This system is not affordable
    economically due to coverage range of agriculture land. Siuli Roy et al. [2] proposed
    a Zigbee based wireless sensor network with the help of IEEE 802.15.4 link layer
    protocol. This work focuses to monitor agricultural parameter remotely and to
    control irrigation and fertilization. Evapotranspiration (ET) is affected by solar
    radiation, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and crop factors, such as stage
    of growth, variety and plant density, management elements, soil properties, pest,
    and disease control [3]. Systems based on ET have been developed that agree to
    water savings of up to 42% on time-based irrigation program [4]. To monitor the
    agricultural system a microcontroller based system developed by Zeldi [5], where
    the real time values of atmospheric condition displayed by the microcontroller
    by sensing of different parameters of agriculture like soil moisture, humidity
    and temperature. An electromagnetic moisture sensor was the basis for developing
    an irrigation system at a savings of 53% of water compared with irrigation by
    sprinklers in an area of 1000 m2 of territory [6]. By using soil sensor and an
    evaporimeter [7], to adjust the irrigation in different weather conditions, a
    scheduling system was developed to reduce the water consumption. However no performance
    analysis was made to look after the power consumption and fundamental issues of
    6LoWPAN protocol stack in these studies. These issues made us to decide to study
    the performances of irrigation system through Cooja Simulator. Since 6LoWPAN is
    an immerging technology and is suitable for constraint environment, smart irrigation
    based on this stack can be a new application area. The purpose of this research
    is to develop a smart irrigation system using 6LoWPAN wireless sensor network
    [8]–[13] and analyze the performances of the WSN. The system will be integrated
    with wireless sensor network technology where solar energy can be used to overcome
    the power crisis along with optimizing the irrigation management based on the
    6LWAN standard. Our own previous work includes performance analysis of an IP based
    protocol stack for WSNs [14] [15]. SECTION III. System Architecture Fig. 1 depicts
    the systems architecture to implement real time irrigation scheduling in a crop
    field. Fig. 1. Proposed system architecture Show All The architecture consists
    of a LoWPAN wireless sensor network, an IoT gateway for Internet connectivity,
    a web server to store sensor data, application software implementing our decision
    support system to provide irrigation scheduling, and a control system for interfacing
    and controlling the irrigation pumps. A LoWPAN is the collection of 6LoWPAN Nodes,
    which share a common IPv6 address, prefix. LoWPAN are connected to other IP networks
    through edge routers or border router. The edge router plays an important role
    as it routes traffic in and out of the LoWPAN, while handling 6LoWPAN compression
    and neighbor discovery for the LoWPAN. Multiple edge routers can be supported
    in the same LoWPAN if they share a common backbone link. Each LoWPAN node is identified
    by a unique IPv6 address, and is capable of sending and receiving IPv6 packets.
    Typically LoWPAN Nodes support ICMPv6 traffic such as ping and use the user datagram
    protocol (UDP) as a transport protocol. In the WSN, the upper leftmost sensor
    node acts as edge router as well as sink node and also the root of directed acyclic
    graph formed by the network topology. The rest of the nodes act as source nodes
    and send their sensing data to the sink node, which then forwards to the destination
    server through the gateway. To connect the WSN with the Internet backbone, a gateway
    is deployed between edge router and the LoWPAN. The gateway enables the connectivity
    of the LoWPAN to the Internet. Hence sensor data from the radio network can be
    transmitted to the server located anywhere in the Internet. The server in the
    architecture is used to collect and store the sensors data. The sensors sense
    moisture level of the crop field and forward the data to the server through the
    gateway. We can implement the server as a cloud from where the farmer, user or
    client retrieves sensor data to analysis for making decision such as moisture
    level, to make irrigation scheduling. The web based decision support system (DSS)
    analyzes the real time moisture level of the crop field and provides users with
    an irrigation schedule for crops during different phases of phonological development
    based on moisture level. If the DSS recommends for irrigation, then the user send
    a positive flag to the control system which then switches on the relay driver
    to turn on the irrigation pump. A relay is an electromagnetic switch operated
    by a relatively small electric current that can switch a much larger electric
    device. The LED in the microcontroller indicates the ON and OFF states of the
    relay circuit. Here we propose the source of energy for the pump is solar renewable
    energy due to power crisis of Bangladesh and remote location of the crop field.
    SECTION IV. Prototype Desgin We have implemented a prototype of smart irrigation
    system. A moisture sensor is used to detect the moisture. An Arduino Uno board
    is used to control whole system. The Arduino module compares the moisture level
    of the field with the threshold moisture level. Arduino will instruct the pump
    to be activated if the moisture of the field is smaller than the set threshold.
    When the moisture level is more than the threshold, the irrigation will be stopped
    by the Arduino. A solar system is used to provide the power need for this system.
    Fig. 2 presents the prototype implementation of our proposed system. Fig. 2. Prototype
    implementation of smart irrigation system Show All SECTION V. Simulation Scenario
    To closely reflect real deployments, nodes run Contiki OS with the whole protocol
    stack. We have compiled Contiki for the Tmote Sky platform based on MSP430 microcontroller
    with 10 KB of RAM and an IEEE 802.15.4 compliant radio. By using the MSP430 hardware
    emulator, Cooja thus takes into account all the hardware constraints of the devices.
    The simulation scenario is presented in Fig. 3. Fig. 3. WSN topology and radio
    environment in cooja. The green disk represents the transmission range and the
    gray disk represents the interference range of the sensor. The yellow nodes are
    source nodes while the blue node is the sink node. Show All The propagation model
    used in the simulations is COOJA''s Unit Disk Graph Medium (UDGM) with constant
    loss. This model uses two concentric disks of different radius. Any node within
    the transmission range receives transmitted packets with a probability of 100%
    (default value). Any node within the interference range but outside of the transmission
    range is not able to receive any packets but see its own transmissions affected.
    Finally nodes outside of the interference range are not able to receive packets
    and are not affected by transmitted packets. The border router or edge router
    is typically a device sitting at the edge of our network, which allows us to talk
    to outside networks using its built-in network interfaces, such as Wi-Fi, Ethernet,
    Serial, etc. In Contiki the current and most used border router application implements
    a serial based interface called SLIP, it allows to connect a given mote to a host
    using scripts like tunslip6 over the serial port, creating a tunneled network
    interface, which can be given an IPv6 prefix to set the network global IPv6 addresses.
    Node 1 corresponds to the border router, which has only one neighbor in its wireless
    coverage area the sensors are deployed to establish multi hops network from the
    border router. The simulation parameters including the protocol stack used are
    shown below in Table 1. For capturing data collected from sensors we use Collect
    view visualization tool provided by the Contiki OS. Table 1. Simulation parameters
    SECTION VI. Results and Analysis To illustrate the performance of the proposed
    WSN scenario we evaluate three important parameters named round trip time as delay,
    packet loss and energy consumption (radio duty cycle and average power consumption.
    This evaluation also tests the RPL routing protocol used in 6LoWPAN, as the scenario
    features nodes with 1 to 4 hops to the router. A. Round Trip Time (RTT) The RTT
    is an important parameter of concern as it is an indicator of the network congestion
    as well as the processing delays. It is computed as function of time by the ping
    request as the time difference between the time of successful response for a request
    and the time instant at which the request is sent. In our simulation, payload
    size is varied from 8 bytes to 56 bytes. Twenty ICMP messages are sent to each
    source node in the WSN through the border router from Contiki client and the statistics
    of round trip time are recorded and plotted in Matlab simulation software. The
    plots below illustrate minimum RTT, maximum RTT, median RTT and deviations of
    RTT for different packet size and multi hop scenarios. It can be seen from Fig.
    4 and Fig. 5 that packets moving further away from the sink experience higher
    RTT, as expected and with the higher payload, the RTT is also higher especially
    in multi hop cases. Fig. 7 presents cumulative distribution function (CDF) as
    a function of deviation of RTT for different hop counts, while Fig. 8 shows packet
    loss for different hop. Fig. 4. Minimum RTT Show All Fig. 5. Maximum RTT Show
    All Fig. 6. Median of RTT Show All Fig. 7. CDF of deviation of RTT for different
    hops Show All Fig. 8. Packet loss for different hop Show All Fig. 9. Average power
    consumption of the source nodes Show All Fig. 10. Average power consumption of
    the source nodes Show All B. Packet Loss The ping ICMP request sent by the client
    computer in the simulation scenario, which are not acknowledges within the specific
    waiting time determines the packet loss. Packet loss occurs in wsn networks due
    to noise, interference and collisions. The scenario is simulated in Cooja by considering
    TX with 100% and RX with 90%. The statistics of packet loss is obtained from the
    reply of ping ICMP packets. Fig. 2 illustrates the packet loss for the scenario.
    It is seen that the packet loss increase as the packet size and hop increases.
    C. Energy Consumption In this section, we look at the energy consumption of nodes
    under the ContikiMAC protocols. We use the duty cycle as an estimator of the energy
    consumption. The lower the duty cycle, the longer the nodes batteries should last.
    ContikiMAC is a suitable and energy efficient radio duty cycle mechanism (RDC)
    for sensor networks running Contiki. Contiki has a power efficient wake-up mechanism
    and uses a fast sleep optimization to allow receivers to quickly detect false
    positive wake-ups. It also uses a transmission optimization to allow run time
    optimization of the energy efficiency of transmission. The ContikiMAC implementation
    in Contiki 2.5 uses the Contiki real-time timers (rtimer) to schedule its periodic
    wake ups. The ContikiMAC wake-up mechanism runs a protothread, which performs
    the periodic wake, ups and implements the fast sleep optimization. The phase-lock
    mechanism is implemented as a separate module from ContikiMAC, which maintains
    a list of neighbors and their wake-up phases. The neighbor is evicted from the
    list after a fixed number of failed transmissions or having no link layer ack
    within a fixed time. In our experiments, the default parameters of ContikiMAC
    have been used. Due to the fast sleep optimization the duty-cycle of ContikiMAC
    is dynamic. The most important contribution to the ContikiMAC reduction in duty-cycle
    is the fast sleep optimization at the heart of the wake-up procedure. The Duty
    Cycle provides information regarding the energy consumption of a node by evaluating
    the time spent by a node in the following states: listen, RX, TX. The Duty Cycle
    is expressed as the ratio between the time spent by a node in those three states
    and the wake-up interval. The Duty Cycle value is computed via the Cooja Power
    tracker tool. The visualizations of radio duty cycle and average power consumption
    have been collected using the Cooja collect view tool and are presented in Fig.
    9 and Fig. 10. From Fig. 8 we observe that the node 5 and 9 experience less duty
    cycle than other nodes in the network as these are not intermediate node and generate
    less traffic. Consequently the average power consumption is also less in these
    two nodes for the same. SECTION VII. Conclusion and Future Work The purpose of
    this paper is to apply the functionality of Internet of things in the field of
    agriculture such as smart irrigation to provide optimum use of fresh water and
    better crops production. The main components of the paper are the system architecture
    for irrigation control system, the analysis of the performance of the 6LoWPAN
    protocol stack, Contiki OS and RPL routing protocol in terms of round trip time,
    packet loss and energy consumption, also investigation of the interoperability
    between heterogeneous network. Based on simulation we observe that the RTT and
    percentage of packet loss will increase as the hop and the payload size become
    larger due to environmental noise such as interference, collision and link quality.
    Radio Duty Cycle is a lifetime indicator of the sensors. It is observed from the
    result that less power consumption means less RDC and hence more lifetime of the
    sensors. ContikiMAC use a RDC protocol that is responsible for power saving mechanism.
    The stack simulated in this work is interoperable as it can be connected to different
    motes platform and does not require gateway to connect to the Internet. Cooja
    enables emulator with real hardware motes, which make the network simple and reusable.
    In addition to it, we browse the contents of the sensors from Mozilla browser
    using Copper plug-in, which implement the CoAP protocol. In a nutshell, one can
    decide the scalability of WSN in terms of multi hops, positioning of border router,
    desired latency and data uncertainty in terms of packet loss for real time application
    of IoT like smart irrigation systems. In the future we intend to implement this
    system in a real field scenario so that performance can be analyzed along with
    the development of web based DSS. There is also an opportunity to analyze the
    real time data streaming where a lot of data will be transmitted by sensors. We
    also plan to study how to handle anomalies of data from sensors. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
    We would like to extend our gratitude to the Swedish Research Council (under grant
    2014-4251) for the funding and the provision of resources to conduct this research.

    Abstract: As the global population soars from today''s 7.3 billion to an estimated
    10 billion by 2050, the demand for Food, Energy and Water (FEW) is expected to
    more than double. Such an increase in population and consequently, in the demand
    for FEW resources will undoubtedly be a great challenge for humankind. A challenge
    that will be exacerbated by the need for humankind to meet the greater demand
    for resources with a smaller ecological footprint. This paper is proposing a system
    developed to optimize the use of water, energy, fertilizers for agricultural crops
    as a solution to this great challenge. It is an automated smart irrigation system
    that uses real time data from wireless sensor networks to schedule an irrigation.
    The test-bed consists of a wireless network monitoring soil moisture, temperature,
    solar radiation, humidity, and fertilizer sensors embedded in the root area of
    the crops and around the test-bed. Wireless sensor data transmission and acquisition
    is managed by an Access Point (AP) using ZigBee protocol. An algorithm was established
    based on threshold values of temperature and soil moisture automated into a programmable
    micro-controller to control irrigation time. The system''s energy demand is completely
    supplied by a solar Photo-voltaic (PV) panel supplemented with an energy storage
    unit. The experimental data obtained from this prototype will be modeled and optimized
    to investigate food production profile as a function of energy and water consumption.
    It will also attempt to understand the effect of extreme weather conditions on
    food production. This holistic approach will explore the nexus between water and
    energy resources, and crop yield for several essential crops in an attempt to
    design a more sustainable method to meet the forecasted surge in demand. Published

    IEEE Conference Location: San Jose, CA, USA SECTION I. Introduction Currently,
    almost 70% of the global fresh water is being used for agriculture [1]. The demand
    for water is expected to increase to 55% by 2050 [2]. Similarly, 30% of total
    global energy consumption is spent on producing, transporting and distributing
    food as well as in the application of pumping, extracting, treating and transporting
    water [3], [4]. Global energy consumption is projected to increase to 80% by 2050
    [2], [4], [5]. As the demand for food soars to 60% by 2050, food security along
    with water and energy supply pose key issues in the availability, accessibility
    and utilization of these resources. Increased population growth, economic development
    and urbanization are the driving factors in the demand for food, energy and water
    resources more than ever [6]. The solution to solve the food requirement has to
    be more innovative. Fig. 1: Drivers of smart farming technology Show All Smart
    agriculture or precision farming is a recent concept that came out of the Internet
    of Things (IoT) applications [7]. The growing IoT landscape can almost be applied
    to different sectors and the agriculture field has been the recent one [8]. The
    combination of IoT along with predictive data analytics in agriculture can equip
    farmers with critical information on soil and environmental parameters to take
    actions. The driving factor behind smart agriculture has been the demand for more
    food production to increase yields, optimize interdependent resources of energy,
    water and land and impact of urbanization [3], [6]. With advances in technology,
    there is more push by global stakeholders like the Food and Agriculture Organization
    (FAO) for farmers to use innovative tools and digital technologies [1], [3], [5].
    The agricultural sector is faced with challenges connected to limited availability
    of arable land, water and energy, global climate change, and labor supply [6].
    The IoT framework can be used to understand the interdependency of energy, water
    and food resources through wireless sensor networks (WSN) for each sub-systems
    [9]. With realtime data, farmers can predict their yield, optimize water utilization
    through smart irrigation control and precisely know when to harvest thereby reducing
    energy and labor input. Although, smart agriculture is a recent phenomena with
    the saturation of digital technologies, there is a great body of work in IoT enabled
    farming [10]–[19]. Several works have been done in smart irrigation as part of
    smart farming model to optimize water utilization. The design and implantation
    of novel wireless mobile robot is demonstrated in [7] to monitor environmental
    parameters suitable for optimal crop yield. The use of distributed WSN of soil-moisture
    and temperature to automate irrigation system has been implemented in [10], [11].
    Remote sensing and the use of distributed WSN for a site-specific irrigation scheme
    is implemented in [12] based on soil property map. The key components in smart
    agriculture; data sensing, communications, storage and processing are integral
    in achieving robust predictive capabilities [16]. Once data has been collected,
    it has to be analyzed using different algorithms to get predictive capabilities.
    In [17] prediction models based on linear regression, neural networks and Support
    Vector Machines (SVM) are proposed from WSN data. Machine learning algorithms
    like Artificial Neural Network (ANN) are often used in the data analytics to manage
    the bid data [18] side of smart farming [19]. The objective of this paper is to
    design and deploy a WSN for monitoring energy, water and crop development to further
    develop a nexus model based on real-time data. The scope of this paper is to describe
    the overall system description and deployment outlining the future proposed work.
    This paper is organized as follows: Section II presents background work and major
    industry players in the IoT application of smart farming system. Section III describes
    the overall system design and implementation. Section IV presents the future work.
    SECTION II. Smart Farm Test Bed The smart farm test bed hereby reported consists
    of distributed WSN, off-grid PV panel, smart irrigation and data infrastructure.
    The purpose of the project is to develop an optimized smart solar-powered farm
    systems that maximize vegetation yield, minimize energy consumption, environmental
    effect through real-time monitoring from sensor data. The design requirements
    are to optimize input of fertilizers and pesticides, energy consumption using
    an off-grid PV and battery backup system and water consumption. The optimization
    function for this problem statement will be further investigated in the future
    work. The end goal is to build a circular system where energy, water, weather,
    and crop data will be collected to develop a nexus computational model. The conventional
    way of thinking about the challenges of FEW systems had focused on “peace-meal
    approach” where decisions are made in one of the nexus areas without making an
    allowance for the consequences on the other areas [6]. The nexus approach provide
    decision makers with better information through optimization of synergies and
    trade-offs. One of the objectives of the nexus is the development of modeling
    tools to support integrated decision making. Big, precise and reliable data from
    all the three systems is required to address the computational challenge for FEW
    nexus. This creates the primary reason for designing intelligent agriculture infrastructure.
    SECTION III. System Design and Implementation The design of the smart farm prototype
    included field preparation which incorporated crop-line accommodation and soil
    preparation, along with solar panel footing foundation and pole placement. The
    farm consists of three 4×25 ft raised beds as shown in Fig. 2 Fig. 2: Field preparation
    Show All A. Electrical System Units The system''s energy demand is completely
    supplied by a PV panel supplemented with an energy storage unit. A 320W at peak
    power with V mpp of 37.2V PV panel with 16.3% module efficiency is used. The tilt
    angle is fixed at 26° same as the latitude of the location. The default tilt angle
    for a PV panel is set to the latitude of the location which will maximize annual
    energy production [20]. The PV panel is connected to a 20A 12V DC Maximum Power
    Point Tracking (MPPT) solar charge controller to prevent overcharging of the batteries.
    The MPPT charge controllers vary from the traditional PWM charge controller by
    allowing the solar panels to function at their optimum power output voltage thereby
    increasing their performance. The charge controller is installed between the PV
    and the batteries to automatically maintain the charge on the batteries using
    the bulk, acceptance and float charge cycles. In addition, the load for the system
    which comes mainly from the water pump is controlled by the MPPT. Two 12V, 250
    Ah are connected in series to the MPPT. Power meters with RS485 serial communication
    capability from the generation and load side are connected. They have an RS485
    serial communication capability for energy data acquisition. Energy data is acquired
    from the power meter through RS485 serial communication to Arduino and then sent
    to gateway through Zigbee protocol. Fig. 3: Electrical system unit Show All B.
    Wireless Sensor Unit WSU are equipped with different types of sensors with the
    capability of measurement, acquisition and synchronization of data. The WSU used
    for this project is an Arduino based node with various radio options for connectivity.
    It has two main component boards consisting of the sensor board and main functionality
    module board. Environmental and agriculture parameters are measured by the sensor
    board. Ambient temperature and humidity, atmospheric pressure, pluviometer, anemometer,
    solar radiation, soil temperature, soil moisture and leaf wetness data are collected
    every hour interval. The WSU device has been programmed to sense and transmit
    these data to a gateway router using XBee-Pro S2 module. All functionality such
    as sensing, data collection, communication and power is programmed in open source
    Integrated Development Environment (IDE). As part of the power saving mechanism,
    the micro-controller has real time clock (RTC) module that can be programmed to
    only wake the device at the time of measurement. The device is programmed to operate
    in deep sleep mode and wakes up every hour to collect and transmit sensor data.
    The device is powered by 6600 mAh rechargeable lithium ion battery. The charge
    on the battery is maintained by a 7 V-500mA solar panel for full energy autonomy.

    for irrigation scheme. Drip-irrigation is a method to water crops by dripping
    near plant roots through a network of pipes. It is the best option for irrigating
    crops by reducing water usage, improving productivity and is relatively cheaper.
    In addition, it requires low operating pressure thus reducing overall energy consumption.
    The system is fully automated that uses real time data from the WSU to schedule
    irrigation events. The control system integrates a switch regulator, 24 V DC water
    pump, 24 V DC solenoid valves, relays and Arduino. Soil moisture and temperature
    sensors are connected to the Arduino and the relays activate the solenoid valves
    and the pump at threshold value. Fig. 6: Flow chart for control system algorithm

    8: Data transmission, reception and storage scheme of the system Show All SECTION
    IV. Data Infrastructure Wireless sensor data transmission and acquisition is managed
    by IoT gateway router designed to connect to the WSN. The router can work as an
    RF-XBee interface, local and external database for WSU. For this project the WSU
    sends sensor data to gateway via ZigBee protocol. The gateway automatically stores
    the data on its local storage with an additional capability to synchronize to
    an external database or connect to a cloud platform. At the time of reception
    in the router, sensor data are timestamped, parsed and stored in local or synchronized
    to an external database. Energy data infrastructure is connected similar to the
    wireless sensor nodes. The protocol uses Max485 for serial communication between
    an Arduino Mega and the power meters. Arduino sends voltage, current and power
    data in frames to router with ZigBee protocol as shown in Fig. 7. SECTION V. Future
    Work The experimental data obtained from this prototype will be modeled and optimized
    to investigate food production profile as a function of energy and water consumption.
    It will also attempt to understand the effect of extreme weather conditions on
    food production. Instead of the peace-meal approach, a holistic approach will
    be developed and explore the nexus between water and energy resources, and crop
    yield for several essential crops in an attempt to design a more sustainable method
    to meet forecasted surge in demand. The conventional way of thinking about these
    intertwined problems focus on “peace-meal approach” where decisions are made in
    one of the nexus areas of water, energy and food without making an allowance for
    the consequences on the other areas. In the future work, data collection from
    this smart farm will be crucial in analyzing the gap between the water, energy
    and crop data will be used to model the interdependency of these systems. SECTION
    VI. Conclusion The abundance of vast amount of data and the ability of analyzing
    data to make decisions have quickly become part of any sector with the advent
    of IoT technologies. Agriculture is one of the sectors with smart farming that
    relies on machine to machine communication to get precise and reliable data. This
    paper presents the design and implementation of smart farm prototype to further
    investigate and model the energy, water and food nexus in the future. In this
    paper, the overall system design, implementation and functionality is explained.
    The test-bed consists of distributed WSN that monitors different agricultural
    and environmental parameters. Wireless sensor data transmission and acquisition
    is managed by IoT gateway router through ZigBee protocol. An algorithm was established
    based on threshold values of temperature and soil moisture to automated into a
    programmable micro-controller to control irrigation time. Authors Figures References

    with enhanced water conservation, using weather forecast and concept of wireless

    sensors communicates with the coordinator, using ZigBee protocol, which then sends
    updates to the farmer via SMS using GSM protocol. Hargreaves equation for reference
    evapotranspiration has been used for the determination of water requirements of
    the crop. Based upon the calculated crop evapotranspiration from the equation
    and rainfall forecast obtained from the internet, irrigation cycle of the crop
    has been modified. An experimental test bed has been developed to implement the
    proposed idea which can be easily and effectively extended to actual crop fields.

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Mathura, India SECTION I. Introduction Water
    is the key to survival of life on this planet. Over the years, there has been
    increased stress over this essential resource, leading to its scarcity. There
    is an alarming need to develop conservation mechanisms so as to achieve effective
    and efficient use of water. One of the major requirements of water is in the field
    of agriculture for irrigational purposes. For conventional irrigation methods
    used today, the crop yield is not up to the mark in many regions. There is a need
    to develop optimum techniques for the effective water management, so as to reduce
    wastage of water as well as to enhance the crop yields. This can be done by development
    of an automated system that takes into account several factors including current
    soil moisture levels, temperature and rainfall prediction for the area, and the
    actual water requirement of crop, which can help in optimal use of water. If water
    is considered to be the lifeline of the crops, there are certain factors which
    are responsible for damaging the crop, fire being one of the major factors among
    all, ruining all the hard work of a farmer. For example, in north India, fire
    destroys hectares of crops, mainly wheat. If not taken care of in time, fire spreads
    and leads to more damage. So, if an accurate and efficient system is made to detect
    and alert the concerned about those fires, a huge amount of loss may be prevented.
    In this paper, we have presented an efficient technique for water management along
    with prevention of the fields from fire hazards, by using a network of sensors
    communicating via ZigBee protocol, Hargreaves equation and weather forecast available
    from internet. Rest of the paper is organized as follows. Technical background
    is presented is Section II, the proposed solution in Section III, implementation
    in Section IV, result in Section V and conclusion in Section VI. SECTION I. Technical
    Background The present day automated irrigation systems make use of a network
    of sensors to get the data from the field [1]–[3]. The farmer receives the information
    on his mobile phone in the form of a SMS. Another method includes use of webpage
    to deliver the information to the farmer where a person can manually access the
    internet to check the data available on that webpage [4]. These kind of systems
    require a separate web server that continuously needs to keep an eye on the data
    being received [5]. Based on the different data received and its interpretation,
    the motor used for irrigation is automatically turned ‘ON’ or ‘OFF’ [6]. Furthermore,
    there are separate systems that make use of sensors to detect fires in the field
    and notify the farmer about the same. A continuous monitoring by the farmer is
    required in all the previously proposed systems. Moreover, these systems are not
    able to judge the weather conditions in time and vary the irrigation scheme accordingly.
    So there is a need for a system that will collectively utilize the benefits of
    existing systems and eliminate the shortcomings, by employing weather forecast
    and Hargreaves equation as supplements. SECTION II. Proposed Solution This paper
    presents an enhanced water conservation using weather forecast, which collects
    data from a webpage about the rain prediction and then accordingly adjusts and
    delays the irrigation cycle. Consider a case when the farm is just irrigated and
    suddenly rain occurs, it is the case of water logging which can damage the crop.
    Moreover, the rain water which could have been used to irrigate the field is wasted.
    So, using the rainfall prediction can help save water to a great extent. Also,
    by using the optimum value of moisture for a particular crop in given soil, its
    yield increases, hence we calculate the water requirement of a crop (expressed
    in mm/day, mm/month or mm/season) [7]. Evapotranspiration (ET) accounts for the
    water lost due to evaporation plus transpiration through plants. The crop coefficients
    ( K c ) for different crops is calculated as the ratio crop evapotranspiration
    to reference crop evapotranspiration. ET c (crop evapotranspiration) is calculated
    from climatic data by directly integrating the effect of crop characteristics
    into ET0 as given in the following equation [8]: E T c =E T ∗ 0 K c (1) View Source
    Where, ET c = Crop evapotranspiration (mm/day); ET 0 = Reference crop evapotranspiration
    (mm/day); K c = Crop coefficient. Several methods have been developed to calculate
    the value of ET 0 [9]. In our system, we have used a temperature-based method
    given by the Hargreaves-Samani equation expressed as [10]: E T 0 = 0.0023 ∗ (
    T mean +17.8)∗( T max − T min ) 0.5 ∗ R a (2) View Source Where, ET 0 = reference
    grass evapotranspiration (mm per day); where T max = daily maximum temperature
    (°C); T min = daily minimum temperature (°C); T mean = average daily temperature,
    T mean =( T min + T max )/2; R a = extraterrestrial radiation (MJ m-2 day-l) [10].
    The values of ET c and CWR (Crop Water Requirements) are identical, whereby ET
    c refers to the amount of water lost through evapotranspiration and CWR is the
    amount of water that has to be provided to compensate the loss [11]. Thus, we
    can find out the value of threshold moisture level of soil and adjust the water
    given to field accordingly for a particular crop [12]. In case of fire, the sprinkler
    system is activated which controls the fire to a certain extent and notifies the
    farmer and the fire department about the same. The microcontroller receives analog
    input from the sensors installed in the field. Three type of sensors have been
    used, namely, soil moisture sensor for detecting the moisture content present
    in the soil, temperature sensor for determining the temperature in the field,
    and smoke sensor to detect concentration of smoke in the air. A large number of
    nodes comprising the sensors are installed at suitable locations in the field
    which send the collected information to the coordinator node using ZigBee protocol
    [13]. The coordinator unit interprets the data received from the sensors and accordingly
    performs the required action (see Fig. 1, and Fig. 2,). When the soil moisture
    content is below the threshold value, the motors are automatically turned on and
    SMS is sent to the farmer using GSM module, informing about the same. Similarly,
    the smoke sensor detects the raised levels of smoke in the air and microcontroller
    activates the sprinkler actuator, sending SMS to the farmer. Furthermore, Internet
    is used to access the website for weather forecast, the rainfall prediction is
    read and if there is high probability of raining the next day, the crops are not
    irrigated that day. In this way, water can be conserved through efficient use
    of rainwater and water logging is also prevented. SECTION III. Implementation
    A. Hardware Implementation 1) Microcontroller Unit The use of Arduino Mega 2560
    [14] is employed to intercept the data from the sensors and then act accordingly.
    It mainly consists of 54 digital input/output pins, 16 analog inputs, 4 UARTs,
    USB slot etc. The advantage of using Arduino is that it is open source, easy to
    program and there are many compatible accessories available in market like Arduino
    shields for various modules. It is a low power microcontroller having a very high
    number of I/O pins making it easy to interface a large number of sensors at a
    time. The processing speed is also very high (16MHz). Fig. 1: Central coordinator
    system Show All Fig. 2: Block diagram of central unit Show All 2) Inputs The inputs
    are in the form of analog values coming from the sensors. The remote transmitter
    unit that provides the inputs. The system and block diagram is shown in Fig. 3,
    and Fig. 4, respectively. Three sensors have been used in the system. Moisture
    Sensor It senses the moisture level in the soil which gives analog values as the
    output according to the change in the conductivity of the soil as the moisture
    content varies. This data is sent to the controller which compares it with the
    threshold value as defined for the crop and the soil. This data is used turn on
    or off the motor for irrigating the field. Smoke Sensor (MQ-2) This sensor has
    good sensitivity to smoke or combustible gases present in air. It is highly sensitive
    to LPG, hydrogen and propane. When a gas interacts with the sensor, firstly it
    gets ionized into its constituents and then absorbed by sensor, creating a potential
    difference. The analog voltage output is fed to the controller and is compared
    with the preset threshold for generating an alert signal. Temperature Sensor Temperature
    sensor LM35 has an output voltage that is directly dependent on the temperature
    of the environment it is exposed to. The scale factor is of value 1mV/C. It draws
    only 60 micro amperes from its supply and has very low self-heating. Its operating
    range is −55°C to 150°C. The temperature data is sent to the farmer by piggybacking
    on the data related to status of motor and sprinkler. Ethernet Shield The Ethernet
    shield [15] is used for the connection of the Arduino with the Internet using
    NTP protocol and the yahoo weather site is accessed with the help of temboo library
    of Arduino. The data related to the weather forecast of next three days is extracted
    from the html form of the webpage. XBee XB24-Z7WIT-0004 Module XBee XB24-Z7WIT−
    004 Digi. Series 2 module creates a wireless network using ZigBee protocol. These
    provide an indoor/urban range up to 133 ft. (40m) and an outdoor RF line-of-sight
    range up to 400 ft. (120m). It is used to connect various nodes to the Central
    coordinator wirelessly. Fig. 3: Remote transmitter unit (end device) Show All
    Fig. 4: Block diagram of remote transmitter node Show All 3) Outputs The outputs
    of the controller are fed to the relays which control the working of motors used
    for water pumps and the sprinklers. The farmer is notified by sending an SMS,
    as shown in Fig. 5, regarding the status of motor, weather, temperature of soil
    every 6 hours using GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication) module SIM900A
    [16] so that he can also monitor the system and his farm with the system working
    on the algorithm shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 5: Screenshots of SMS alerts received by
    the farmer Show All Fig. 6: Flow chart of algorithm for outputs Show All A. Software
    Implementation Following development environments were used to program and configure
    the hardware. 1) Arduino IDE-1.6.5 The open source Arduino ide which has high
    abstraction level using C++ language is used to program the Development board
    Arduin o mega 2560 [14]. 2) X-CTU 6.1 XCTU is a free multi-platform application
    that enables the Developers to interact with Digi RF modules through a simple-to-use
    graphical interface. This software is used to configure the X-bee modules as coordinator,
    router and end devices. The configuration setting includes the transmission mode,
    security keys, type of encryption etc. SECTION IV. Results Thus, according to
    the soil moisture level and rainfall prediction the motor is controlled as shown
    in Table I. When the sensors sense smoke levels greater than the threshold, i.e.
    an indication of fire accident, the sprinklers are turned ON until the value drops
    below the threshold value (see Table II). The graph for voltage values from soil
    moisture sensor against the water supplied, as obtained in Table III is plotted
    in Fig. 7. Fig. 7: Plot for voltage values (v) obtained by soil moisture sensor
    for different amount of water supplied (mm) Show All Table 1: Moisture value,
    rainfall and motor status Table 2: Smoke, temperature and sprinklers status Table
    3: Voltage values (v) obtained by soil moisture sensor for different water supplied
    values (mm) If the value is less than the calculated crop water requirements,
    the prediction of rain for the next day is checked using Arduino Ethernet shield.
    If prediction of rain is negative, the motor is turned ON until the value of soil
    moisture reaches the desired value. On the contrary, if the prediction of rain
    is positive, we need not supply water to the fields as shown in Table 1. All this
    information is sent to farmer''s cell phone using GSM module. Therefore, the proposed
    system is effectively determining the water requirements for the crop by knowing
    the information of the crop, and season provided by the farmer, and through the
    network of sensors installed in the field. The information about temperature and
    weather of the region was read from the internet and used to further optimize
    the irrigation system. Depending upon the required moisture level, the field was
    watered as and when required. The system would work out to be very efficient for
    optimum use of available water resources, reduction in irrigation costs as well
    as to ensure the crop receives appropriate amount of water for its proper growth.
    SECTION V. Conclusion Our proposed system successfully provides an appropriate
    amount of water for the selected crop and soil combinations, thereby reducing
    wastage of water resource as well as resulting in better yields for the crop.
    In addition, chances of rainfall gathered from a weather forecasting were also
    taken into account so as to prevent over irrigation of the crop and make use of
    rainwater. The fire accidents are also prevented by early detection and quick
    prevention measures. Moreover, all the information about what is going on in the
    field has been continuously sent through SMS on farmer''s mobile phone. This reduces
    human intervention and also the labour cost. The proposed solution is highly efficient
    in terms of performance installation and operational cost. The system does not
    require any special training and can be used by anyone easily. Authors Figures

  analysis: 'The paper proposes a hybrid decision model for weather-dependent farm
    irrigation that utilizes a combination of resilient backpropagation-based neural
    network pattern classification and fuzzy logic.


    The neural network pattern classification algorithm, optimized using the Resilient
    Back-propagation (Rprop) technique, predicts soil moisture content based on various
    soil and environmental parameters, including soil moisture, soil temperature,
    environmental temperature, environmental humidity, CO2 levels, and sunlight intensity.
    This prediction is crucial for determining irrigation requirements and optimizing
    water usage.


    The predicted soil moisture content is then used as input to a fuzzy logic weather
    model, which considers weather parameters such as sunlight intensity, wind speed,
    environmental humidity, and environmental temperature to generate appropriate
    irrigation suggestions. The fuzzy logic model is designed to handle imprecise
    and uncertain information, making it well-suited for weather-dependent irrigation
    decision-making.


    The proposed system leverages real-time sensor data collected from a wireless
    sensor network (WSN) to monitor soil and environmental conditions. The use of
    real-time data enables timely irrigation decisions, ensuring that crops receive
    the optimal amount of water at the right time.


    The effectiveness of the proposed model was evaluated using field test data, demonstrating
    its ability to predict soil moisture content with high accuracy. The paper also
    includes a detailed description of the methodology, including the neural network

    of the proposed system could be further strengthened by providing more detailed
    results and performance metrics, such as error rates or irrigation efficiency

    Overall, the paper addresses the point of considerations for volume, frequency,

    conference paper PDF 1 Introduction Irrigation is a crucial practice in several
    agricultural cropping systems in semiarid and arid areas, and also useful water
    applications and management are key concerns. The efficiency and uniformity of
    irrigation could be maintained from the complex and diverse information based
    systems by considering weather, soil, water, and crop data. Irrigation water management
    forms a major part of precision agriculture. It involves better assessment of
    need and availability of soil water level for crop cultivation. The statistical
    data from the United Nations indicate worldwide, agricultural accounts for 70
    % of all water consumption, compared to 20 % for industry and 10 % for domestic
    use [1]. There are models developed that use the remotely sensed data to profile
    the soil moisture. However, remote sensing can be used to directly infer soil
    moisture. Microwave emissivities and infrared data were proven to be highly correlated
    with the soil moisture [2]. A lot of research has been concentrated in this area
    during the last two decades. Recently many researchers have been reported for
    soil moisture level control in an agriculture land by collecting soil and environmental
    information using wireless sensor network technique. Liang et al. [3] have proposed
    a design and implement of a real-time soil moisture prediction system based on
    GPRS and wireless sensor network. The front-end of the system utilizes wireless
    sensor network (WSN) environment to collect soil moisture data and a GPRS network
    to transmit the acquired data. The back-end of the system utilizes genetic backpropagation
    neural network to analyze and process the acquired data, simulate using annealing
    algorithm to optimum result, and to gives a real-time prediction output. The experimental
    results concludes that this system has the major advantages like low cost, high
    degree of accuracy and convenient maintenance [3]. The method proposed by Liang
    et al. [3] is a direct sensing of soil moisture content using WSN environment
    but the proposed method does not emphasizes on the irrigation mechanism. In the
    similar context, the other land related parameters and environmental parameters
    may affect the irrigation requirements. Timely prediction of soil moisture content
    will provide better irrigation management in a land by considering almost all
    the required parameters which affects the soil water evaporation. This prediction
    requires efficient algorithms which will produce future irrigation requirements
    in an agriculture land. The algorithm is tested for the prediction of soil moisture
    content in 1 h advance by considering eleven different soil and environmental
    parameters. The performance of Resilient Back-propagation is compared using MSE
    (Mean Square Error), RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), and R-squared error. In the
    similar context, Goumopoulos et al. [4] describe the design of an adaptable decision
    support system and its integration with a wireless sensor/actuator network (WSAN)
    to implement autonomous closed-loop zone-specific irrigation. Using ontology for
    defining the application logic emphasizes system flexibility and adaptability
    and supports the application of automatic inferential and validation mechanisms.
    Furthermore, a machine learning process has been applied for inducing new rules
    by analyzing logged datasets for extracting new knowledge and extending the system
    ontology in order to cope, for example, with a sensor type failure or to improve
    the accuracy of a plant state diagnosis. A deployment of the system is presented
    in zone specific irrigation control in a greenhouse setting. The method proposed
    by Goumopoulos et al. [4], consider only on the soil moisture content data from
    a greenhouse environment. This technique does not include other soil and environmental
    data like soil temperature, environmental humidity, environmental temperature
    and sun light intensity which are most required parameters for soil evapotranspiration.
    The timely prediction of soil moisture content is also not included in the method
    proposed by Goumopoulos et al. [4]. Our proposed method emphasises on the timely
    prediction of soil moisture content in any farming area like a greenhouse, polyhouse
    and large farmland by considering different soil and environmental parameters.
    The summarized literature review of the articles used in this work is listed with
    some of the comparison statements in Table 1. Table 1 Summarized literature review
    Full size table 2 Proposed Methodology Agriculture system models are complex nonlinear
    systems which can be solved using powerful estimation methodologies like neural
    network algorithms [6]. In this work neural network pattern classification technique
    is proposed for the prediction of soil moisture content by considering soil and
    environmental parameters. A feedforward neural network is trained using Resilient
    Back-propagation (Rprop) which update weight and bias values. In the similar context,
    Chai et al. [5] have proposed Resilient Back-propagation (Rprop) for the prediction
    of soil moisture content during a field test during National Airborne Field Experiment
    2005 (NAFE’05). According to the experiment, the RMSE obtained is about 4.93 %v/v
    [5]. In our proposed technique, the collection of soil and environmental data
    is performed using wireless sensor network (WSN) environment for the real-time
    monitoring and analysis of soil moisture content (MC) of the test site located
    in the eastern region of India. The test site of (50 m × 100 m) is planted with
    bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon) which is used for stomach ulcer, colitis, and
    stomach infections as ayurvedic medicine. The test site contains nine WSN nodes
    with nine individual irrigation valves. The WSN nodes are used to collect data
    from soil moisture sensor, soil temperature sensor, environmental temperature
    sensor, environmental humidity sensor, CO2 sensor, and sun light intensity sensor
    for multi-point measurement of land data in agricultural production. The proposed
    single node fabricated during this work is shown in Fig. 1a. The collected data
    were stored in a gateway node consisting of Raspberry Pi, Zigbee series 2 and
    wifi connectivity as shown in Fig. 1b. The proposed data collection architecture
    is shown in Fig. 1c. The complete scheme is utilized to collect twenty four numbers

    numbers of datasets signifies the collection of all the data in 24 h in a day.

    Full size image 2.1 Resilient Back-Propagation (Rprop) Resilient Back-propagation
    is an efficient learning approach for supervised learning mechanism in feedforward
    artificial neural networks architectures [7–9]. It is a first order optimization
    technique. This technique is also an efficient new learning scheme focusing on
    a direct adaptation of the weight steps depending on local gradient information.
    To achieve this, individual update-value \(\Delta _{\text{ij}}\) is introduced
    for each weight, which solely determines the size of the weight-update [10–12].
    This adaptive update-value evolves during the learning process based on its local
    sight on the error function E, according to the following learning-rule: 2.2 Fuzzification
    and Defuzzification Fuzzification is the mechanism of constructing a crisp fuzzy
    set. It is performed by recognizing that several of the quantities is thought
    about to be crisp and settled which are actually not deterministic at all [13].
    If the shape of uncertainty exists to arise as a result of impreciseness, ambiguity,
    or unclearness, then the variable may be fuzzy and portrayed by a membership operate.
    Defuzzification is that the conversion of a fuzzy amount to an explicit quantity,
    just as fuzzification is the conversion of an explicit amount to a fuzzy quantity.
    In this work, the fuzzy membership functions are considered as sunlight intensity,
    wind speed, environmental humidity, environmental temperature and predicted soil
    moisture content which was obtained using neural network pattern classification.
    The membership function selected for the fuzzy weather model is a triangular shape
    function. The fuzzy logic input and output membership functions are listed in
    Figs. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11. 3 Results and Discussions The overall performance
    of the optimization techniques for the prediction of soil moisture content is
    examined by considering eleven soil and environmental parameters. The input and
    output data are listed in Table 2. The predicted soil moisture content for 1 h
    advance is compared with ideal moisture content using time, MSE (Mean Square Error),
    RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), and R-squared error during ideal weather condition.

    100 % performance. Also from the neural network training state as shown in Fig.

    model is tested with different test inputs and it is observed that the neural
    network and fuzzy logic algorithms are performing well good. Some of the test
    conditions are listed in Table 4. Table 4 Test inputs and outputs of the proposed
    irrigation model Full size table 4 Conclusion The soil moisture content in 1 h
    advance is efficiently predicted by taking various soil and environmental parameters.
    The performance analysis of Resilient Back-propagation optimization technique
    for neural network pattern classification is done by calculating MSE, RMSE and
    R-squared error. From the errors obtained during prediction shows that the performance
    of Resilient Back-propagation based neural network pattern classification gives
    better result in soil moisture content prediction. The MSE and RMSE obtained by
    Resilient Back-propagation based neural network pattern classification are 6.5198e-05
    and 0.008074. The predicted soil moisture content is successfully used in the
    fuzzy logic weather model for generating adequate irrigation suggestions. Hence
    it concluded that the proposed weather condition dependent hybrid irrigation model
    will help to predict soil MC and to generate necessary irrigation suggestions
    using real-time sensor data from the agriculture locations. The complete work
    is successfully tested in the test land (Latitude: 20.351323, Longitude: 85.806547).
    The proposed model needs more rigorous multiple farm testing to obtain complete
    performance of the soil moisture control mechanism. References Worldometers about

  analysis: 'This paper presents a system for smart irrigation using wireless sensor
    networks, real-time sensors, and an automated irrigation system. It utilizes machine
    learning models, including logistic regression, to predict water requirements
    based on soil moisture, weather conditions, and crop type. The system aims to
    optimize water usage and improve crop yields.


    While the paper aligns with the review point on data considerations, it mainly
    focuses on the hardware configuration and data collection aspects of the proposed
    system. It briefly mentions the use of logistic regression for water requirement
    prediction but does not provide in-depth analysis or insights into data requirements
    specific to the logistic regression model.


    The paper''s relevance to the review point is moderate as it touches upon data
    considerations but lacks detailed analysis of data requirements and model-specific
    information.

    It is no longer necessary to rely on someone to do irrigation while we are away
    or every time when there is a need of watering the crops, due to technology advancement.
    Many researchers have attempted the automated watering of crops but accuracy,
    timeliness and cost issues are rarely handled as well as prioritized. The suggested
    method uses a wireless sensor network, real-time sensors, and irrigation system
    control to carry out autonomous watering which leads to smart irrigation. This
    technique aids in keeping the necessary water in the container and reduces waste.
    With automated irrigation, the soil''s moisture, type of crop and weather conditions,
    these all three parameters determine whether the requirement of the water to the
    crops instead of only considering soil moisture. Machine learning method like
    logistic regression can be used to forecast the requirement of water by considering
    above three parameters. The arduino based IoT circuitry is used to pass the information
    of three mentioned parameters based on values of which, the logistic regression
    model predicts the watering requirements of the plants. The approach described
    is useful from the point of view of accuracy, timeliness and cost. Published in:

    India SECTION I. Introduction Water must be planned, produced, protected, managed,
    and most importantly used responsibly because it is a valuable and rare natural
    resource that is also essential to life. Due to rising demands and finite supplies,
    farms must manage their water resources as efficiently as possible. In order to
    produce crops at their full potential and satisfy future food production needs,
    crop yields must be increased in areas with scarce water resources. To effectively
    irrigate more land with the same amount of water from the restricted source [1].
    The act of artificially watering plants in a regulated manner at regular periods
    of time is known as irrigation [2]. There are many different kinds of automatic
    irrigation systems, including Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)-based
    automatic irrigation systems, solar-powered automatic irrigation systems, and
    soil moisture content sensors [3]. Every form of irrigation system has unique
    advantages and disadvantages. As an illustration, the Automated Irrigation System
    on Detecting Soil Moisture Content system tracked and managed the irrigation status
    based on the moisture content of the soil. Users cannot access the plant''s online
    status, however, as the component is not network-connected. While a solar-powered
    auto irrigation system is beneficial for reducing electrical energy usage, it
    may not function well during the rainy season or in the absence of sunshine, especially
    in arctic nations. A global network connecting society through information and
    communication technology is known as the Internet of Things (IoT). It makes it
    possible for services to link real and virtual objects. Via the link, real-time
    data can be sent between the two objects. IoT technologies are progressively being
    applied to almost every aspect of daily life. As an illustration, customers can
    effortlessly turn on and off their home''s fan using their Smartphone, wherever
    they are. The Internet of Things has been used in agriculture as well as for home
    automation. Crop monitoring and irrigation can both be greatly facilitated by
    IoT. If we consider the scenario of urban side, then urban gardening is becoming
    more popular among some people, such as city dwellers, from time to time. For
    a healthy lifestyle, these people are interested in growing their own affordable,
    organic fresh food. The COVID-19 epidemic may possibly have disrupted the food
    supply system in several nations. Consequently, urban gardening may offer simple
    daily access to fresh produce, enhancing food security and promoting enriched
    and balanced meals [4]. Currently, the majority of individuals water their plants
    by hand. However, carrying out hand irrigation has a number of drawbacks. First
    of all, if someone has a busy day or week, they cannot be expected to water their
    plant. For the plant to live and flourish, it needs a steady supply of water.
    The plant''s development and photosynthetic activities will be impacted by a shortage
    of water. The plant will eventually wilt and die [5]. In case of villages, where
    the farmers have their farms full of crops and want to water these crops, have
    to wake up midnights and water the crops due to the electricity issues at villages.
    Also, during COVID-19, it was not possible for them to reach the farms and water
    the plants, because of which we have witnessed the lot of damage in agricultural
    sector leading to food shortages. Hence, manual process of irrigation should have
    been replaced by the smart IoT based automated irrigation systems. As above mentioned
    about existing scenarios have their limitations, hence we are taking the advantage
    of the IoT and data science relation to develop the smart irrigation without the
    need of manual intervention. This research work is proposed to avoid the inconveniences
    of the manual irrigation system as well as to overcome the disadvantages of the
    existing smart irrigation system. The smart irrigation system proposed has two
    parts, in first part the configuration of the system is hardware based where multiple
    sensors are required to capture the certain values related to crop field, the
    attribute names are soil moisture, weather conditions and the type of crop in
    the crop field which have high correlation with the water required to the crops.
    In second part the captured attribute values are used by the machine learning
    technique such as logistic regression which predicts the amount of water required
    by the crop field, if any. Hence, this research work is a combination of IoT and
    machine learning. Main attributes which are focused here are accuracy of the system,
    timeliness and cost of the system. The next subsequent sections of this research
    article is focusing on the literature review of the existing methodologies , proposed
    architecture of the research work related to smart irrigation, the nature of data
    to be used, followed by summary insights of the work. SECTION II. Literature Survey
    The authors have carried out the thorough survey and studied many existing smart
    irrigation systems and concluded as follows for every such system. In [6], Vishal
    Saraswat et al have designed and tested the "Smart Irrigation system based on
    soil moisture utilizing Arduino." It was created by integrating functionality
    from every piece of hardware used. It has been verified that the mechanism works
    mechanically. The wetness (water content) of the various plants is measured by
    the moisture sensors. The moisture sensor transmits a signal to the Arduino board,
    which in turn causes the Water Pump to switch ON and supply water to each individual
    plant, if the dampness level falls below the desired and set level. The system
    shuts down automatically and the water pump is turned off when the desired moisture
    level is reached. As a result, the system''s functioning has been rigorously tested
    and is said to perform as intended. But, here the system works only with the sensor
    and no mechanism which can analyse the data and predict the water requirement.
    Along with that, it also depends on only moister level and other important parameters
    are not considered here. In [7], Aman Bafna et al have method wherehuman contact
    in plant watering is fully eliminated when the weather system predicts and adjusts
    the plant watering cycle according to the weather. With the development of water
    soluble fertilizers, farmers are no longer required to fertilize their crops.
    The water tank could simply be filled with fertilizer, and the irrigation system
    would take care of the rest. Here, the limitations are the system do not consider
    the predictions of water requirement and system only suggests the plants that
    can grow in the available soil type and does not talk about automation of watering.
    In [8], Dr. Geetha S et al have proposed the autonomous irrigation system which
    is intended to continually monitor the soil''s moisture content. When the desired
    level of soil moisture is reached, the system responds accordingly by watering
    the soil with exactly the right amount of water and then turning off the water
    supply. There are two useful elements. These are a motor or pump and a moisture
    sensor. The Arduino IDE software is used to programme Arduino boards. The soil
    moisture content is determined using a soil moisture sensor. Plants receive water
    by a motor or pump. The timer module delivers the water at predetermined intervals
    of time that is defined in Arduino, regardless of moisture level. The overall
    power consumption of the circuit is between 200 and 220 mA. The system''s key
    benefit is that it only activates the water pump when necessary and shuts it down
    immediately when there is enough water. This avoids water waste and guarantees
    that water is used as efficiently as possible. The limitation of the system is
    where the attributes for predicting the water needs is only one and other important
    parameters are not considered which does not guarantee about accuracy of the system,
    specially false positives can be raised and excessive water could been provided
    to plants. In [9], V. Vinoth Kumar et al. have proposed an irrigation system using
    IoT where data is collected at the user end regarding status of the soil moisture,
    if there is any deviation from the reference value, the user can send a command
    through the IoT server to maintain the set point value of the field parameter
    for proper irrigation. The proposed IoT-based irrigation system can measure the
    soil moisture and temperature of the field and transmits real-time data to the
    user through the Wi-Fi and IoT server. The limitation of the system is, it does
    not operate the irrigation system automatically and provide the technical field
    values to the users who may not understand it hence this system cannot be generalized
    for all type of farmers and gardeners. In [10], Ancy Stephen at al have outlined
    the process for performing automated irrigation. The suggested system includes
    a wireless sensor network, real-time sensors, and control of an irrigation system
    to carry out autonomous watering. This technique aids in preserving the necessary
    water in the container and prevents waste. With automated irrigation, the soil''s
    moisture determines whether the pumping motor turns on or off automatically. Machine
    learning methods like the KNN algorithm and Naive Bayes algorithm are used to
    forecast how dry the soil is. The linear algorithm is applied to determine how
    much water is needed and to estimate when the next water cycle will occur. The
    pumping ON/OFF prediction technique is then developed using an artificial neural
    network. The system is proposed with linear algorithm and also the classification
    algorithms do not provide the desired predictions with high accuracy. The system
    does not specify the data requirements, the linear algorithm structure and results.
    This system does not provide water level predictions and requirements for crops
    in the crop field. In [11], P. Mercy Nesa Rani et al. have described an automated
    irrigation system that enables farmers to irrigate crops with the right amount
    of water without hindering their growth. By monitoring the resistivity of the
    electrodes put into the soil, this irrigation system ascertains the soil''s moisture
    content and waters the plant appropriately. The ADC readings of the moisture sensors
    are used to calculate the soil''s moisture content. The water pump is turned on
    to irrigate the crop based on the amount of moisture in the soil. Such moisture
    measuring techniques have the disadvantage of requiring individual calibration
    and failing in saline soil. The authors have sensed the water content of the soil
    over a wider area by extending the electrode''s length. Wireless sensor networks
    are not used and monitoring of huge agricultural fields is not provided by the
    work. In [12], G.Ravi kumar et al. have proposed a modern design method for monitoring
    and managing soil moisture using LabVIEW, providing all the tools necessary to
    construct any measurement or control application in a significantly shorter amount
    of time. The work also contains a rain sensor, which is crucial to prevent needless
    power use. The authors have claimed that, by managing soil moisture more effectively
    throughout critical plant growth stages, farmers are not only able to produce
    crops with less water overall, but they are also able to boost crop yields and
    quality. The use of an embedded system for computerized irrigation in agriculture
    provides a useful option for page-accurate irrigation control that enables farmers
    to increase production while conserving money. The disadvantage of the system
    is only limited parameters are used and complete automation of the irrigation
    system is demonstrated. It also does not elaborate the quality attributes achieved
    through the research work as a part of results. SECTION III. Concepts and Definitions
    Here, in this research work, the two parts are important, in first part we talk
    about the hardware configuration of the system and second part focuses on the
    machine learning technique for prediction of water needs for the crops. A. Arduino
    hardware for desgining IoT System As it has many user-friendly features and a
    large network of supporters, Arduino is an open source hardware and software platform
    that is highly well-liked among designers and manufacturers [13] [14]. Fig. 1.
    Arduino board Show All Fig. 1 shows the hardware diagram for arduino board. Following
    are the key features: Arduino boards have the ability to take analogue or digital
    input data from various sensors and convert them into an output, such as turning
    on or off a motor, an LED, connecting to the cloud, or doing a number of other
    tasks. By sending a set of instructions to the board''s microprocessor via the
    Arduino IDE, you may control how your board behaves (referred to as uploading
    software). Unlike the majority of earlier programmable circuit boards, the Arduino
    does not require a separate hardware component known as a programmer to load new
    code into the board. All you need is a USB cord. Moreover, the Arduino IDE employs
    a condensed form of C++ that makes learning to programme simpler. Last but not
    least, Arduino offers a standard form factor that separates the micro-functionality
    controller''s into a more approachable container [13]. B. Logistic Regression
    The second part of proposed system is prediction of water needs using logistic
    regression. So, here in this section we are elaborating logistic regression. One
    of the most often used Machine Learning algorithms, within the category of Supervised
    Learning, is logistic regression [15]. With a predetermined set of independent
    factors, it is used to predict the categorical dependent variable. With a categorical
    dependent variable, the output is predicted via logistic regression. As a result,
    the result must be a discrete or categorical value [16] [17]. Rather of providing
    the precise values of 0 and 1, it provides the probabilistic values that fall
    between 0 and 1. It can be either Yes or No, 0 or 1, true or false, etc. Since
    it can classify new data using both continuous and discrete datasets, logistic
    regression is a key machine learning approach. Following eq. (1) is the logistic
    regression formula: log[ y 1−y ]= b 0 + b 1 x 1 + b 2 x 2 + b 3 x 3 +⋯+ b n x
    n (1) View Source Logistic Regression can be classified into three types: Binomial:
    There are only two conceivable forms of dependent variables in binomial logistic
    regression, such as 0 or 1, Pass or Fail, etc. Multinomial: In multinomial logistic
    regression, the dependent variable may be one of three or more potential unordered
    kinds, such as "cat," "dogs," or "sheep." Ordinal: There are three or more potential
    ordered sorts of dependent variables in ordinal logistic regression, such as "low,"
    "Medium," or "High." [18]. SECTION IV. Proposed Methodology The methodology uses
    the hardware based design of the system for collecting the soil’s moisture, weather
    data and type of crop. The hardware consists of arduino circuit with the required
    sensors which sense the data related to these attributes. The fundamental reason
    for utilizing IOT and machine learning to build a low-cost smart irrigation system
    was to make it simpler for farmers to comprehend how much water is required for
    healthy, disease-free crops that are rich in nutrients. The sensors capture the
    data from the crop field and send that data to the model. The prediction model
    and automated system is driven with logistic regression which predicts the water
    needs. The data collected from the sensors will be applied as input to the logistic
    regression; the logistic regression determines whether the input leads to the
    water needs or sufficient water availability in the crop field. The logistic regression
    when determines the water level is below the requirement, it drives the water
    pump switch to turn on and hence water is supplied to the crop field. If the logistic
    regression model determines that, the sufficient water level is reached or available
    in the crop field, the water pump switch is automatically driven to turn off and
    hence, wastage of water will be avoided. The Fig. 2 shows the proposed method
    working architecture. Fig. 2. Architecture of Smart Irrigation system Show All
    SECTION V. Data Requirements The Kaggle dataset is obtained. This dataset was
    obtained from a system that uses a wireless sensor network to monitor and regulate
    an irrigation system in real-time. The factors in the dataset used in the proposed
    method are temperature (C), humidity percentage, and soil moisture need. The dependent
    factors are temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, while the independent parameter
    is the amount of water required. When water is unclean, some systems take the
    pH value and filter the water to ensure good crop output. SECTION VI. Conclusion
    Here, the research work carried out for smart irrigation system using IoT based
    circuit and machine learning focuses on the fully automated approach for watering
    the farms and the crop fields. It specifies the approach without manual intervention
    and accuracy based water needs predictions using the logistic regression technique.
    The cost of the system is also very low as only arduino board is involved and
    it can be afforded by every individual having farms. This system reduces the efforts
    of the farmers, as farmers do not have to operate the system by reaching actual
    crop fields or farmers do not have to operate anything in the system. Once the
    model is instantiated in the actual environment, the automation in the model will
    operate the water pump ON and OFF scenarios as per requirement. The future scope
    of the system is, other attributes can be considered and faster processing can
    be targeted with more advanced hardware circuitry. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors

    concept of IoT caught attention in 1999, by means of Auto-ID center at MIT and
    its relevant market investigation publications. Basically, IoT is an integration
    of multiple devices which communicate, sense and interact with their internal
    and external states through the embedded technology that IoT contain [1]. IoT
    has become the megatrend for next generation technologies which can impact the
    whole business spectrum with extended benefits which are advanced connectivity
    of end devices, system and services. IoT offers appropriate solutions for multiple
    applications such as smart health care, smart cities, security, retail, traffic
    congestion industrial control and agriculture [3]. A significant amount of work
    has been done regarding IoT technology in agricultural area to develop smart farming
    solutions [4]. IoT has brought a great revolution in agriculture environment by
    examining multiple complications and challenges in farming [5]. Now a days, with
    the advancement of technology it has been expected that by using IoT agriculturalists
    and technologists are finding out the solution of those problems which farmer
    are facing such as shortages of water, cost management and productivity issues
    [6], [7]. State-of-the-art IoT technologies have detected all these issues and
    provide solutions to increase productivity while lowering the cost. Efforts made
    on wireless sensors networks enable us to collect data from sensing devices and
    send it to the main servers [8]. Data collected through sensors gives information
    about different environmental condition to monitor the whole system properly.
    Monitoring the environmental conditions or crop productivity is not only the factor
    for the evaluation of crop but there are many other factors which effect the crops’
    productivity, e.g. field management, soil and crop monitoring, movement of an
    unwanted object, attacks of wild animals, and thefts etc. [9], [10]. Moreover,
    IoT provides a well-organized scheduling of restricted resources which makes sure
    that the best use of IoT enhances the productivity. Figure 1 shows a schematic
    diagram showing the agricultural trends which provide easy and cost effective
    interactions through a secure and unblemished connectivity across individual Greenhouse,
    Livestock, Farmer, and Field monitoring. Whereby, the IoT agricultural networks
    using the wireless devices enable real time crop and animal monitoring. The figure
    shows that two sensor kits (Libelium Smart Agriculture Xtreme IoT Vertical Kit
    and Crop/Plant Monitoring Sensor Kit) have been implemented which monitor the
    soil moisture, leaf wetness, temperature, humidity, productivity, and air flow.
    While, MooMonitor sensor monitors the animal health, fertility, feeding, ruminating
    and resting. The agricultural servers, gateways, and agriculture database play
    an important role to store agriculture records and provide on demand agricultural
    services to authorized users. FIGURE 1. Agricultural trends. Show All As a whole,
    in agriculture field there are multiple applications, protocols and prototypes.
    IoT agriculture research trends include network platform, network architecture,
    applications, security, and challenges among others [28]–[30]. Moreover, in many
    countries and organizations over globe different IoT policies and guidelines have
    been implemented in agriculture field. However in IoT agricultural environment
    a reasonable amount of work has been done and there is a need of thorough study
    on IoT in agriculture context to understand the current research status. To transform
    agriculture technologies via IoT innovation this paper analyzes various issues
    and trends in IoT smart farming. In this research as a contribution following
    IoT agricultural techniques have been added from literature: Present major components
    of IoT based smart farming along with relevant technologies in Section II. Section
    III presents a rigorous discussion on network architecture of IoT that involves
    network architecture and layers, network topologies used; and devices and protocols
    used in agriculture IoT. Different application domains and relevant smart phone
    and sensor based applications have been discussed in Section IV. The security
    and privacy issues in IoT based agriculture have been discussed in Section V.
    The industrial trends have been discussed in Section VI that provides the details
    related to top technology industries investing in this area. The IoT agricultural
    policies made by different countries for the standardization of IoT based agriculture
    have been discussed in Section VII. This section also presents few success stories
    in this area. Lastly, the open issues and challenges to improve IoT based agricultural
    technologies from many aspects have been presented in Section VIII. SECTION II.
    Major Components and Relevant Technologies for IoT Based Smart Farming A. Major
    Components of IoT Based Smart Farming IoT based smart farming consist of four
    major components as shown in Figure 2. FIGURE 2. Major components of IoT based
    smart farming. Show All These four major components are physical structure, data
    acquisition, data processing, and data analytics. The physical structure is the
    most important factor for precision agriculture to avoid any unwanted happening.
    Whole system is designed in such a way which controls the sensors, actuators,
    and devices. A sensor performs multiple tasks like soil sensing, temperature sensing,
    weather sensing, light sensing, and moisture sensing. Similarly devices perform
    many control functions like, node discovery, device identification and naming
    services etc. All these functions are performed by any device or sensor which
    is controlled through a microcontroller. This controlling operation is performed
    by any remote device or a computer which is connected through the Internet. Data
    Acquisition is further divided into two sub components namely: IoT data acquisition
    and standard data acquisition. Whereby, the IoT data acquisition component consists
    of seven protocols that are Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Websocket,
    Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Node, Constrained Application Protocol
    (CoAP), Data Distribution Service (DDS), and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
    Depending on the requirements and condition more protocols can be used for the
    implementation of smart farming. Whereas, in the standard data acquisition ZigBee,
    WIFI, Long Range Wide Area Network (LoraWan), SigFox and ISOBUS protocols have
    been used. Data processing consists of multiple features that are image or video
    processing, data loading, decision support system, and data mining as shown in
    Figure 2. According to the system requirements any feature may be added that may
    work in parallel to provide other services. Data analytics consists of two main
    features that are monitoring and controlling. Monitoring involves three main application
    in smart agriculture that are Live Stock Monitoring, Field Monitoring, and Green
    house Monitoring. IoT enables farmers to monitor livestock via multiple sensors
    which are used to monitor different animal’s diseases like temperature, heart
    rate, and digestion etc [11]. Whereas field monitoring applications intend to
    report different conditions of field like soil richness, temperature, humidity,
    gas, pressure (air pressure and water pressure), and crop disease monitoring [12],
    [13]. A smart greenhouse design eliminates the manual intervention and measures
    different climate parameters by intelligent IoT devices and sensors according
    to plants requirements [14]–[16]. B. Iotagricultural Relevant Technologies A Large
    number of technologies are being used in IoT agricultural solutions due to which
    it is hard to make an explicit of all those due to which our discussion focused
    on several core technologies which have played a vital role to modernize the IoT
    agricultural services. 1) Cloud and Edge Computing Collaboration of IoT and cloud
    computing in agriculture provides pervasive access to shared resources. To meet
    various agricultural needs upon request over network and execute operations cloud
    computing plays vital role [17]. Cloud based software architecture has been proposed
    which process and retrieve information and agricultural tasks in a more accurate
    way [18], [19]. In the field of IoT edge computing is considered as a solution
    to facilitate data processing at the source of data generation which are sensors,
    actuators and many other embedded devices. Edge computing or fog computing are
    measured as the backbone of cloud computing. This technology is deployed according
    to the features and requirements of smart farming [20]. 2) Big Data Analytics
    and Machine Learning Big data consist of a large amount of essential which are
    generated by agricultural sensors. Big data analysis provides different and efficient
    crop monitoring methods at different stages [21]. A good systematic review on
    big data analysis in agriculture has been presented [22]. Neural networks are
    very famous because they provide optimal solutions at a very high speed. Intrusion
    detection has been realized by using advance principles and technology of neural
    network. On the other hand most important feature of neural network is that they
    provide detection module and data training [23]. By using deep neural networks
    an IoT based hydroponic system has been developed [24]. 3) Communication Networks
    and Protocols IoT agricultural network consist of different kinds of long ranges
    and short ranges networks for communications. Several IoT networks technologies
    help to design a crop or field monitoring sensors and devices [25]. Communication
    protocols are the backbone of IoT agricultural network system and applications
    [26]. They are used to exchange all agricultural data or information over the
    network. 4) Robotics Multiple Agribots have been developed for the purpose of
    smart farming which are minimizing the amount of farmers by increasing the speed
    of work through advance techniques. Agribots performs elementary functions like
    weeding, spraying and sowing etc. All these robots are controlled by using IoT
    to increase the crop productivity and efficient resource utilization. A multi
    sensor robotics approach has been proposed for characterization and ground mapping
    [27]. SECTION III. IoT Agricultural Networks IoT agricultural network or IoT network
    for agriculture is one of the vital elements of IoT in agriculture. It helps to
    monitor agriculture data and facilitate the transmission and reception of agriculture
    data. As shown in Figure 3, the framework consists of IoT agricultural network
    architecture, IoT agricultural network platform and IoT agricultural network topologies
    and protocols. FIGURE 3. IoT agricultural network. Show All A. IoT Agricultural
    Neworkt Architecture The IoT agricultural network is the main factor of IoT in
    agriculture field [31]. IoT Agricultural network architecture suggests an outline
    for the specification of an IoT agricultural network physical elements as well
    as their working principles, and techniques. Most of the IoT applications usually
    follow the four layer architecture (Network Layer, Application layer, Physical
    and Mac Layer and Transport Layer) due to the popularity and interoperability
    of IP as suggested by Naik [32]. After reviewing these four layers protocol we
    have also survey two more approaches that are IPv6 and 6LoWPAN as shown in Figure
    4. This layer is the final level of abstraction which allows the development of
    multiple user applications. At this layer deployed communication protocols monitor
    different agricultural parameters such as weather information, soil moisture values,
    irrigation monitoring etc. FIGURE 4. Layer structure of the 6LoWPAN. Show All
    1) Application Layer Due to the energy constraints and stringent computation involved
    by the IoT devices there are many lightweight protocols on application layer such
    as CoAP, MQTT, AMQP, and HTTP. These protocols can be increased or decreased according
    to the system requirement. CoAP protocol runs on UDP and works on the principle
    of request or response architecture [33]. AMQP protocol runs over the TCP protocol
    by following publish/subscribe architecture asynchronously and use TSL/SSL for
    security assurance. MQTT is a bandwidth-efficient protocol which uses little battery
    power and designed for receiving and transmitting sensor information [34]. HTTP
    is a well known web messaging protocol which based on the request/response architecture
    [35]. Runs over TCP and does not define any QoS, uses TSL/SSL for security purpose.
    2) Transport Layer This layer is also called host to host transport layer, and
    is directly transferred from IP to IoT domain. The main task of network layer
    is to collect and encapsulate the agricultural information which is obtained through
    sensor layer. There are two protocols that are transmission control protocol (TCP)
    and user datagram protocol (UDP). TCP is a connection oriented protocol which
    ensures the reliability of delivered data. TCP data transmission speed is low
    as compare to UDP. UDP is a connection less protocol which does not ensure reliability
    of data. Its data transmission speed is high as compared to TCP. Both of these
    protocols are used in different applications because their choices depend upon
    the requirements of application. 3) Network Layer This layer is an indispensable
    technology for precision farming and responsible to transmit agricultural information
    at application layer. IP is the major choice with the existing two versions that
    are IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 came into existence due to increasing the large number
    of addressable devices. Whereas, invention of IPv6 was expected which gradually
    establish on all networking devices. Routing protocol for Low Power and Lossy
    Networks (RPL) is considered as the main protocol while applying routing on 6LoWPAN
    [36]. RPL consist of distance vector routing protocol which uses Destination Oriented
    Directed Acyclic Graphs (DODAG) to specify routes. To support different flows
    of traffic RPL modify itself according to network speed and acknowledge routing
    metrics such as status of the battery used in device, link quality, and higher
    computational cost exchange. 4) Adaptation Layer Adaptation Layer (AL) aim is
    to ensure the interoperability, and implement fragmentation, compression and reassembly
    mechanism. Although AL attained many advances but still there is a complexity
    for IPv6 supporting because its direct use on IoT devices is not considered reasonable.
    Usually clashes were seen with constraints which are associated with IoT devices.
    That’s why, 6LoWPAN made a big effort in order to decrease the limitations of
    IPv6 and make it suitable for IoT devices. Sensors and devices use IPv6 and 6LoWPAN
    to transmit data over IEEE 802.15.4 protocol in IoT agricultural network. 5) Physical
    and Mac Layers This is the bottom most layer in agriculture network archichture
    which is responsible to sense and actuate different agricultural parametrs. Within
    physical and MAC layer IEEE 802.15.4 is one of the most popular standard which
    was designed for low cost, low consumption and low complexity [37]. This standard
    was adopted by many protocols like Wireless HART, ZigBee and ISA100. IEEE802.15.4
    mainly operates in ISM band of 2.4 GHz. Furthermore, it also operate 915 MHz (in
    United Nations of American) 868 MHz (in European countries) and supports up to
    250 kbps data rates. However literature shows some significant limitation of later
    approaches, which are regarding to mobility and network formation [38]. EPC-Global
    (designed for RFID technologies) [39] and Z-wave (particularly designed for domotics)
    [40] have also been used as alternative of IEEE 802.15.4 to exchange information
    directly from internt protocol (IP). B. IoT Agricultural Network Platform IoT
    agricultural network platform refers to both the big data analytics model and
    cloud model. 1) Big Data Analytics Big data analysis applied to find out the required
    and meaningful information from the large amount of data from different data formates.
    The crop disease control and crop growth models build on the basis of farm data.
    Big data analysis also provides decision support services to farmers for crop
    productivity and optimal cost analysis. Figure 5 shows IoT agricultural network
    platform based on big data analytics. The proposed network platform consists of
    six components namely: i) Farmer/User experience, ii) Big Data analysis, iii)
    Sensing and monitoring, iv) Storage services, v) Communication protocols, and
    vi) Physical implementations. This platform provides access to the IoT backbone,
    and helps collecting information about soil fertility, weather conditioning, moisturization,
    and online crop monitoring etc. FIGURE 5. IoT agricultural network platform based
    on big data analysis. Show All a: Farmer Experience Farmer experience layer is
    designed to help the farmers to monitor crop productivity in multiple ways such
    as, for effective growth of crops farmers are awared by identifying the appropriateness
    of fertile selection. Climate conditions, crops growth conditions, soil quality,
    or cattle health monitoring helps the farmers to track the state of their business
    and mitigate the lower production risks. b: Predictive Analysis This analysis
    makes the whole environment smarter by the combination of smart farming market
    intelligence and IoT technology. The major task of predictive analysis is to analyze,
    explore and process the agricultural information for digital awareness. Predictive
    analysis is made to check the probabilistic chance of crop productivity up to
    the next season. Here different detecting devices are applied to check the, Crop
    disease, weather conditions, and estimate the profit/loss on the basis of crop
    productivity. Predictive analysis facilitates the farm to understand the optimal
    time for planting & harvesting and various farm management techniques. c: Multicultural
    Analysis Elaborates the multiple forms of agriculture. In this analysis big data
    analysis minimize the risk of crop destruction according to scientific ways. To
    enhance the growth rate of water featured Botanic Aquaculture layer is equipped
    with big data. Other multicultural techniques like Citriculture, Horticulture
    and Floriculture avail direct benefits when enabled with big data analysis. It
    is helpful for decision making related to crop or plants seasonal growth, and
    pest control. Vermiculture is used for the cultivation of earthworms. Arboriculture
    is basically used for the cultivation of woody plants. Olericulture is an application
    which is used for the prediction and measure the growth rate of different vegetables.
    d: Sensing and Monitoring Sensing and monitoring analysis is made by applying
    different sensing and monitoring devices. Sensors sense data and store the crop
    disease information. Data which is processed through multiple resources is automatically
    achieved by sensing layer. Ststistical analysis has been made on data received
    from sensors in order to actuate the disease. Farmers obtain necessary information
    such as ph value, temperature, soil moisture and humidity through web and message
    service. Real time image and video monitoring on data helps the farmer to gat
    timely and accurate information. e: Communication Protocols Communication protocols
    collect and encapsulate agricultural data. To process and transmit data by using
    these protocols have been considered as the nerve center of IoT in agriculture.
    These protocols consist of internet related technologies like WIFI, LoraWan and
    Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technologies. ZigBee is considered as the
    main enabler for communication over long distances when third party service providers
    such as Long-Term Evolution (LTE), CDMA or Global System for Mobile (GSM) are
    not available. f: Storage Services Farmers’ store crop related information to
    make better analysis in future and use stored information in multiple seasons
    for more productivity. g: Physical Implementations Multiple sensors, different
    types of actuators and microcontrollers are implemented physically to monitore
    different agricultural applications. Many other network equipments also implemented
    at physical layer like switches, routers and gateways are included. At this layer
    whole environmental conditions are sensed and then actuate according to a predefined
    instructions. Microcontroller plays the supervisor role and performs networking
    related operations and some other functionality which are done by sensors and
    actuators. An IoT based functional frame work is shown in figure 6. The functional
    framework shows that how agriculturists and farmers can access multiple databases
    with the assistance of support layer from application layer. Business layer contains
    all necessary operation which are important for any IoT farm. Data acquisition
    layer provides connection with session layer through IoT protocols like MQTT,
    AMQP and COAP etc. FIGURE 6. Functional framework for an agricultural information
    service model. Show All 2) Cloud Infrastructure Cloud provides a large amount
    of storage through large virtualized servers which are connected together to perform
    necessary action. A cloud based IoT design has been presented in [41] for precision
    farming. In which IoT techniques are applied to analyze and manage data from farms
    through sensors and devices to generate information for decision making. Design
    recommendations for IoT agricultural network on the basis of Cloud is shown in
    Figure 7. FIGURE 7. IoT agricultural network platform based on cloud. Show All
    Platform has been proposed on the basis of four layers which are Cloud Storage,
    Gateway, Fog Computing and hardware modules. Cloud storage layer centerlized the
    all agricultural related data such as weather related, soil, fertilization, crop
    and agricultural marketing in the cloud and provides on demand resources through
    networked infrastructure. Analyics resources and web services are also installed
    on cloud or internet which are accessible by cloud services. Most of the devices
    or sensors are not designed in such a way which can connect with internet for
    the purpose of data sharing. To resolve this data sharing problem local gateways
    are designed which act as bridge between all hardware devices and sensors for
    connectivity, security and controllability. Implementation of gateway in greenhouse
    or field improves the ability of automation and control the real time greenhouse
    monitoring system. Hardware modules and cloud services are distributed whereas
    resources are integrated through fog computing. Fog computing reduces the computational
    load of cloud and ensures the real time processing. Basic purpose of fog computing
    in this proposed network platform is to leverage the on demand scalability of
    cloud computing resources by taking the advantage of both cloud and edge computing.
    In hardware modules multiple actuators, sensors, microcontrollers and central
    processing unit have been implemented to monitor and sense various agricultural
    variables. Hardware modules are distributed in global or local networks and used
    to create services or processes. For the implementation of smart farming fast
    response time and capability to exchange information is necessary. Both of these
    requirements (fast response time and capability to exchange information) are fulfilled
    by two protocols that are Representational State Transfer (REST) and Message Queuing
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT). Instead of using big data center distributed system
    is more effective for smart farming because it breaks up large computation into
    easy and smaller tasks like: Crop, Temperature, nutrients, energy, climate, moisture
    of soil etc. C. IoT Agricultural Network Topology and Protocols IoT agricultural
    network topology shows the arrangement of multiple elements of an IoT Agricultural
    network and represents an ideal scenario for smart farming. Figure 8 described
    how heterogeneous computing grid collects necessary sensor data by using multiple
    sensing devices such as moisture sensor, humidity sensor, temperature sensor,
    gas sensor, ph sensor, ultra violet sensor etc and forms an IoT agricultural network
    topology. FIGURE 8. Conceptual illustration of IoT-based ubiquitous agricultural
    solutions. Show All This ubiquitous Agricultural solution transforms the storage
    capacity of multiple electronic devices like Smartphone, Laptops, and agricultural
    terminals into hybrid computing grids. Figure 9 visualize a scenario in which
    multiple crop parameters are monitored by implementing agricultural devices and
    sensors in all over the field. FIGURE 9. Farm remote monitoring in agriculture.
    Show All Sensed data is then analyzed and stored, and stored data from multiple
    sensors and devices becomes useful for aggregation. On the basis of aggregation
    and analysis agriculturists/farmer can monitor the different crop variables in
    all over the field from anywhere. Moreover, topology consists of a proper network
    configuration for the streaming of agricultural videos. For example figure 9 support
    the streaming of pests via an interconnected network with an internet protocol
    (IP), GSM, WiMAX and access service network gateway. 1) Low Power WSN Topology
    Figure 10 shows a topology in which low power wireless sensor network has been
    designed to monitor and control the various farming factors. In this topology
    ZigBee is being used for data transmission which consists of multiple end devices
    and router to propagate the information on larger distances. End devices which
    are scattered in the field consist of different kind of sensors such as temperature,
    gas, humidity, soil, Motion detector, PH, UV, PIR sensors and a microcontroller.
    FIGURE 10. Low power WSN topology. Show All End devices are directly connected
    to the router and controller, where controller communicates with base station
    by using serial port to analyze the received information. According to software
    monitoring perspective each end device is properly initialized and attached sensors
    are activated in an appropriate way. Once the sensors are activated then each
    device follows the router to connect in the same way according to which they have
    been designed. After confirmation end device may connect to the WSN by using identical
    key. Data which is collected through sensors is send to the base station which
    takes analysis on received data. When the sensors attached with end devices are
    being read then data is transmitted via ZigBee to the Controller or router. Major
    advantage of this net topology is its bi-directional communication by using ZigBee.
    2) IoT Protocols for Agriculture There are many IoT communication protocols which
    are widely used in agriculture for the purpose of smart farming. By using these
    protocols farmers can communicate in a more convenient way and make more efficient
    decisions for smart farming to enhance and monitor the growth of crop. Most common
    wireless protocols which are being used named: IEEE 802.11 WIFI, 2G/3G/4 G-Mobile
    Communications Standards, LoraWan, WiMax, Low Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks,
    Bluetooth, RFID, and ZigBee. Comparison of all these wireless protocols is given
    in Table 1. TABLE 1 Comparison of Existing Wireless Protocols a: IEEE 802.11 WiFi
    IEEE 802.11 is a compilation of communication standards Wireless Local Area Network
    that is 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n and 802.11ac. All these standards operate
    in different bandwidths that are 5 GHz, 2.2GHz, 2.4/5 GHz, 60 GHz and 5 GHz. Data
    transfer range of these standards is from 1Mb/s to 7 Gb/s. Its communication range
    is from 20 m to 100 m [42]. A wifi based wireless sensor network in IoT has been
    discussed for smart agriculture [43]. b: LoraWan LoraWan is a long range communication
    protocol which is developed by an open and non-profit association namely Lora
    TM Alliance. The main purpose of this LoraWan protocol is to assure the interoperability
    between multiple operators [44]. To improve agricultural productivity and anticipate
    the problems a framework has been presented in [45] whose component based on Lora
    and ARIMA technology. c: WiMax Data transfer range of Worldwide Interoperability
    for microwave access is from 1.5 Mb/s to 1 Gb/s. But now a days with the advancement
    of technology data transfer rate has been changed [46]. WiMax provides broadband
    multi access connectivity that includes fixed, portable, nomadic and mobile communication
    through wired or wireless connectivity. Both WiFi and WiMax technologies have
    been deployed in Ministry of Food and Agriculture, Ghana (MOFA) which enables
    user to connect either WiMax networks or building Wifi [47]. d: 2G/3G/4G-Mobile
    Communications Standards There are multiple generations of Mobile Communication
    Standards consist of Second Generation, Third Generation, and Fourth Generation.
    IoT devices Communicate by using these standards over cellular networks. Through
    the use of mobile communication farmer can detect temporal variability across
    their fiels and monitor crop yield, soil and climate conditions [48]. e: LR-WPAN
    Low Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks figure out the specification of high
    level communication standards like ZigBee. Data transfer rate of LR-WPAN consist
    of 40 Kb/s-250 Kb/s. The major property of this standard is that it provides low
    speed and low cost communication services [49]. LR-WPAN is mostly used for indoor
    agriculture such as home garden or in small farms. f: RFID RFID works on the principal
    by assigning a unique number individually to each object in order to record information.
    RFID consists of readers, host and tags where tags receive and transmit radio
    waves due to which it is also known as responder. RFI tags consist of active tags
    and passive tags which are available in different sizes and shapes. Passive tag
    is more advantageous as compare to active tag because it is cheap than active
    tags. Tags have unique ID number and environmental information such as moisture
    level, temperature condition, and humidity etc. These tags are embedded and attached
    in multiple objects to identify that object. g: ZigBee ZigBee is on the top of
    IEEE 802 standards created by ZigBee Alliance. It is a set of specifications for
    device to device network having low power data rates. With the advancement of
    technology and increasing the demand of throughput there is a need of faster and
    low power consumption technology. These requirements are fulfilled by more established
    technologies which provides faster data transfer. In agriculture environment IoT
    sensors sense the data and transfer it towards remote server. After sensing, collected
    data is analyzd for decisions making [50]. h: MQTT MQTT is a messaging protocol
    in IoT which is mainly designed for remote connections. It’s a bandwidth efficient
    protocol and uses little battery power. MQTT is used for continuous analysis and
    deploy a smart system for agriculture sector. A low cost web based IoT solution
    has been presented by using MQTT for monitoring, tracking and analyzing agricultural
    data and collect knowledge from field ambience and improve environmental conditions
    [51]. By using MQTT a low cost irrigation system has been proposed for receiving
    and transmitting sensor information [52]. i: SigFox It’s a low data rate and an
    ultra narrowband wireless cellular network which is appropriate for IoT and machine
    type communications [53]. To construct a geo location system SigFox network was
    used which localize animals pasture of the whole summer [54]. System proposed
    in [55] helps the farmers to locate their cattle’s position and increase their
    productivity. j: Bluetooth Bluetooth is a low power and low range Personal Area
    Network which is best for short range mobile communication. There are many IoT
    agricultural devices which are bluetooth enabled such as Farmnote Air gateway
    and color sensor work with bluetooth enabled sensors. Bluetooth has ubiquitous
    nature due to which it is considered as an appropriate technology for multi-tier
    agricultural applications [56]. SECTION IV. IoT Agriculture Applications IoT agriculture
    system applied as an array of wide variety of fields such as, Precision farming,
    livestock monitoring, and greenhouse monitoring. Agriculture applications have
    been categorized into three sections: IoT agricultural applications, Smartphone
    based applications and sensor based applications. IoT and sensor based applications
    categorization has been illustrated in figure 11 which is framed by reviewing
    the today’s available IoT solutions in agriculture. FIGURE 11. IoT structure in
    agriculture. Show All A. IoT Agricultural Application Domains There are number
    of IoT agriculture applications which are being used to create more efficient
    resources for agriculture productivity. Main domains of IoT agriculture applications
    are precision farming, livestock monitoring, greenhouse monitoring and agricultural
    drones. The following subsection consists of various types of agricultural applications.
    1) Precision Farming Precision farming helps the farmers to improve, automate
    and optimize all feasible directions in order to enhance the agricultural productivity
    and make cropping system smart [57]. Different IoT sensors are deployed to measure
    soil quality, weather conditions, moisture level, and effectively plan to optimize
    harvesting techniques. To enhance the crop production a correlation analysis between
    agricultural environment information and crop statistical analysis has been developed
    to collect crop data [28]. In [58] an IoT based platforms has been developed for
    precision agriculture and ecological monitoring. IoT based weather forecasts helps
    to optimize productivity and take anticipatory analysis to prevent the crop from
    damage. Multiple monitoring devices/sensors are used to predict pest behavior,
    plant or crop growth and address any pending pest issue before they damage crop.
    Ranchers use IoT based irrigation solutions to manage and analyze crop irrigation
    requirements. In [59] a remote agricultural monitoring platform has been presented
    on the basis of monitored data. A conceptual architecture based on cyber systems
    and software defined setworks has been presented in [60] for precision farming.
    IoT base Precision farming consist of multiple monitroing and controling applications
    such as climate conditions monitoring, soil patterns monitoring, pest and crop
    disease monitoring, irrigation, determine optimal time to plant and harvest and
    tracking/tracing. a: Climate Conditions Monitoring In agriculture it is the most
    important to monitor weather conditions continuously so that future activities
    can be planed accordingly. Weather stations are the most popular gadgets in the
    field of agriculture which are used to monitor different climte conditions. Weather
    parameters which are being monitored include temperature, humidity, wind direction,
    and air pressure etc. Located across the field, weather stations collect the environmental
    data and send it to the cloud server. Collected data is used for weather analysis
    to map climate conditions, and provide new insights to take required actions to
    improve agricultural productivity. US Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
    has been defined a weather related approach called Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA)
    which helps the user to transform agriculture system by identifying climate conditions
    [61]. A wireless sensor network has been deployed by using IoT technology to monitor
    weather changes by integrating the sensors and devices [62]. b: Soil Patterns
    Soil monitoring has become one of the most demanding practices in agriculture
    field for both industries and farmers. In soil monitoring there are many environmental
    issues which affects on crop production. If hese kinds of issues are identified
    data accurately then the farming patterns and processes can be understand easily.
    Soil patterns which are being monitored consists of Soil Humidity, moisture, fertilization
    and temperature. Soil humidity and moisture sensors are deployed to monitor the
    moisture content in soil [63]. An adequate amount of fertilization in the field
    also increase crop yield [64]. Soil monitoring test report increase crop productivity
    and recommends an appropriate fertilization solutions to farmer [65]. Moreover,
    identification of contaminated soil by using IoT technologies protect the field
    from over fertilization and crop loss. c: Pest and Crop Disease Monitoring Root
    causes of revenue and production losses are crop diseases. Due to the boom of
    IoT agricultural system has been changed into digital system which helps the farmer
    to make informed decisions. Prediction of crop diseases at early stages helps
    the farmers to generate more revenue by saving crop from pest attacks. IoT protect
    crop in multiple ways by detecting different diseases and prevent crop from animal
    attacks. An IoT based monitoring system has been presented in [66] to monitor
    the wheat diseases, pest and weeds. Crop raiding is the biggest issue due to contraction
    of cultivated land into different wildlife haunts. In [67] a monitoring and repelling
    system for the protection of crop against wild animals attack has been presented.
    Detection of crop disease at early stages is very challenging in the field of
    agriculture. Because to detect crop or leaf disease a team of experts is called,
    which is expensive and time taking process. Whereas, automatic detection of diseases
    is very beneficial, accurate and cheaper for farmer as compared to manual observation
    by experts. Image processing technique also plays a vital role for the earlier
    detection of plant disease [68]. A crop disease detection scenario has been shown
    in figure 12. FIGURE 12. Disease detection scenario. Show All Sensed raw data
    via sensing devices is converted into usable format via remote server and then
    stored into database which is displayed through a user interface. After getting
    data multiple data mining models are applied for disease (bacterial, fungal, viral
    etc) analysis. d: Irrigation Monitoring System IoT improve the current irrigation
    system in a more innovative way. A farmer can optimize irrigation system in multiple
    ways by monitoring weather conditions and soil conditions. IoT technology monitor
    irrigation system in four ways like weather forecasting data, control and monitor
    whole field from anywhere, Ethernet connection and WIFI. This modern irrigation
    system facilitates the farmers by installing multiple sensors, reducing farmers
    monthly irrigation cost, and limit water resources [69]. In [70] an intelligent
    irrigation management system has been presented by using Maching learning and
    open source technologies which sense different soil and weather parametrs. An
    IoT based Low cost irrigation system has been designed in [71] which uses HTTP
    and MQTT protocols to inform the user. Water quality is monitored by sensor nodes
    which are empowered with wireless communication. IoT technology measure both physical
    and chemical constraints of ph, dissolved, temperature, conductivity and oxygen
    [72]. Gathered data about water management system is viewed on internet by using
    cloud computing services. Recently multiple IoT irrigation platforms have been
    developed to control the water consumption in the field. In [73] a simple irrigation
    system has been developed by using WSN. In more advance system users can control
    the process of irrigation through cellular technologies. Likewise, system is proposed
    in [75] in which user transfer sensors data via cellular technologies to a database
    system. e: Determine the Optimal Time to Plant and Harvest IoT increase operational
    efficiency and enhance the crop productivity by determining the best possible
    time to harvest and plant. IoT amalgamate multiple existing technologies like
    cloud computing applications, end user applications, wireless sensor networks
    (WSN’s) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) to determine the accurate time
    of weeding and seeding [76]. f: Tracking and Tracing IoT provides informative
    data to agricultural companies for better decisions making such as planning, managing
    and connect with business partners intelligently by saving money and time. In
    growing environment soil, air, water, fertilizers, and pesticides conditions are
    monitored by RFID and Global Positioning System (GPS). GPS system is used to find
    the exact location of agriculture field and monitor various agricultural parameters
    by using wireless communication networks. In [77] an architecture has been develop
    which remotely monitor the soil condition and soil structure as per requirement
    of crops culture. In this structure ZigBee is connected with other devices like
    content management system (CMS), Global System for Mobile (GSM) and General Packet
    Radio Service (GPRS) by using Wireless sensor networks to monitor and realize
    real time data checking. GPS provides interface to interact with ARM (an intelligent
    monitoring system to achieve functions like SMS/MMS) and gives an alarm to farm
    manager when an unwanted changes occur and helps the farmers to take corrective
    action. Although it’s operational and maintenance cost is high but it is widely
    used in agriculture due to its exact location monitoring and tracking property.
    g: Farm Management System The adoption of smart farming is correspondingly increasing
    the amount of productivity by reducing the environmental impact but this smart
    farming technique can be possible via Farm Management System (FMS). FMS is a key
    element for processing, planning, and decision making for the purpose of smart
    farming [78]. An integrated FMS allows the farmers to monitor the entire where
    whole data is collected via WSN, GSM modules and microcontroller. An identifier
    is used on the sensors and devices in all over the farm which gives the proper
    knowledge of fertilization, weather data, automatic buffer zone width monitoring,
    and automatic detail record is generated according to per day activities of farm.
    This whole information is stored in the computer in standard format and can be
    accessible via cell phone or internet for further processing. To optimize the
    use of water resources an automated irrigation and monitoring system is used [73].
    Apart from irrigation system farm is also protected from pest and animal intrusion
    [66], [67]. h: Agricultural Drones Drones are defined as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
    (UAVs) which are being utilized in agriculture to improve various practices of
    farming. These flying devices are controlled remotely by remote control or autonomously
    programmed. Agricultural processes which are performed by drones are crop health
    assessment, spraying, screening, planting, scouting reports, measurement of nitrogen
    in wheat and analysis of soil conditions. Drones facilitate the farmers via integration
    with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) mapping, and crop health imaging. Drones
    are mostly deployed in large farms where issues related to bacteria fungus are
    difficult to handle and require regular monitoring. In the area of agriculture
    pesticides and fertilizers are very important for crop yield [65], [66]. Agricultural
    drones are carrying out this job efficiently because of its high speed and effectiveness
    in the spraying operation. In addition they also deployed to monitor forests,
    livestock and aquaculture. An organization Precision Hawk is using drones for
    valuable data gathering through sensors for surveying mapping, and imaging of
    agricultural land. They perform in-flight monitoring, farmers enters the detail
    about which field to survey and select a ground resolution. An IoT based Farm
    management information system approch has been developed to meet the bussiness
    objectives [29]. Agricultural drones are integrated with GPS devices cameras and
    sensors to monitor crop health, like planting, crop spraying, screening and analysis
    of soil. There are many other advantages of drone’s utilization like crop health
    imaging, plant counting, amount of nitrogen in wheat, plant height, drainage mapping,
    and weed pressure etc. 2) Greenhouse Monitoring In greenhouse plants are grown
    under controlled environment. This glasshouse technology provides benefits to
    growing plants anytime anywhere by monitoring appropriate environmental conditions.
    Cultivation of greenhouse is more intense, therefore in terms of controlling and
    monitoring it requires high precision. To monitor environmental or weather conditions
    there have been several studies on the applications of WSN’s in greenhouse. Recent
    studies shows that how IoT can be implemented in greenhouse to minimize the human
    resources, accumulate energy and provides direct link of greenhouse from ranchers
    to customers. Most of the studies have focused only on remote monitoring and localized
    [14]–[16]. In addition, for the purpose of high precision there have been a lot
    of studies which integrates meta-processing structure with data to transfer it
    on remote infrastructures through internet. By applying well evaluated crop models,
    assessment of the crop status helps the ranchers to take better decisions [80].
    In Figure 13 a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has been implemented to monitor the
    greenhouse environment. Whole network is divided into multi parts which processes
    the data and gives feedback. FIGURE 13. WSN for monitoring greenhouse environment.
    Show All Data can be obtained by corresponding sensors and detectors and then
    transferred to the main server for processing. In physical implementation the
    major components are the sensors and network for accurate data transmission. Growers
    setup the different monitoring devices and sensors according to the specific requirements
    and track or record the required information. Agriculturists make better decisions
    by analyzing the received information and achieve specific goals by obtaining
    optimal data. There are many IoT based greenhouse applications such as water management,
    plant monitoring, and climate monitoring etc. a: Water Management To measure the
    exact amount of required water in greenhouses is a key problem. Smart sensors
    are implemented which are controlled by applying multiple IoT techniques to avoid
    from excessive use of water. In greenhouses water management is carried out by
    using automatic drip irrigation which works by following soil mositure threshhold
    that is set accordingly [81]. b: Plant Monitoring IoT sensors and cameras creates
    ideal environment for plants by monitoring the state of plants regularly and generates
    an alert if any problem is recognizable. On the other side, cloud based IoT solutions
    store the sensed data and view it periodically which is helpful for growers to
    ensure that all plants obtains ideal attention in the greenhouse [82]. c: Climate
    Monitoring There are many parameters which are combined to maintain and create
    an ideal environment for plants within strict limits such as, the maintenance
    of ventilation, temperature, carbon dioxide, and oxygen level. This can be made
    possible by deploying IoT enabled greenhouse where smart devices and sensors share
    their information for strong decision making [81]. 3) Livestock Monitoring Optimal
    environment or weather circumstances which absorbs excessive amount of climate
    conditions leaves negative impact on the productivity of animals that is a serious
    issue for many researchers [83]. Whereas, due to increasing the demand of high
    quality dairy products precision livestock also considered as the major concern.
    Each year ranchers lose a large amount of profit because of animals illness. But
    IoT based livestock management solutions helps the farmers to improve the farming
    principles, livestock conditions and dairy products [11]. Just like crop monitoring
    sensors, different livestock monitoring sensors are also attached to the animals
    to monitor their log performance. Livestock monitoring factors varies on the categories
    of animals under consideration such as conductivity of milk, pest attack, humidity,
    and water quality. By tagging RFID to individual animal allow farmers to track
    their location, thereby preventing animal from theft. Connected sensors and wearables
    in the livestock allow the farmer to monitor overall animals’ activities and data
    streamed to the cloud directly helps the farmers to identify the issues. Cowlar
    and SCR by Allflex are using smart agriculture sensors to monitor animals health,
    activity, temperature, nutrition and collect information on each individual as
    well as about the herd [84], [85]. In the field of livestock several studies have
    been realized. Wireless Sensor have been used which are most advantageous for
    large farm as well as for hazardous gas monitoring. An IoT based livestock scenario
    is shown in Figure 14. FIGURE 14. IoT based livestock scenario. Show All In the
    field different IoT sensing devices have been deployed to monitor the weather
    conditions via weather station and sense other activities in the field by all
    other data sources which have been implemented in the whole farm. Sensed data
    is stored on the cloud server, which user can use for decision making. User can
    interact remotely by using multiple smart devices (Laptops, Tablets, and Mobile
    etc.). Some IoT base applications of livestock monitoring have discussed below:
    a: Animal Temperature Monitoring Identification of disease symptoms and prevention
    is the major function for animal health monitoring. Normal body temperature of
    dogs is 38.3°C-39.2°C and cow’s is 38.5°C-39.5°C. When the body temperature is
    increased or decreased from the normal body temperature then it indicates that
    animal is suffering from any disease [86]. b: Heat Stress Level Heat stress decreases
    the cow’s milk productivity with same dietary input, due to which farmers face
    the cost production issues. In summer season moisture content becomes low due
    to which stress level in animals increased, because of this animal can also die.
    c: Physical Gesture Recognition Gesture analysis can be made by using IoT animal
    monitoring devices. Animal’s gesture behavior is classified into different groups
    such as in cattle, this behavior is consisting of two classes that are traveling
    and stationary. Traveling behavior consists of animal’s walking, running and grazing
    whereas stationary behavior is animal’s sitting, sleeping and standing. d: Rumination
    Rumination monitor the digested food by animal and it is detected by mounting
    a monitoring device in the animal’s (cows) nose. In this way farmer can get accurate
    indication about animal’s health. e: Heart Rate Measurement of heart rate is an
    indirect method which impacts due to the agitation and stress that cow have. Normal
    heart rate of cow is 43 to 84 bpm whereas calf’s normal heart rate is 100 to 140
    bpm. By using IoT devices and sensors heart rate can be monitored constantly.
    f: GPS Based Monitoring GPS system is used to obtain the specification of farm
    and sends the monitored parameters to central monitoring station by using wireless
    sensor network. To prevent animals from theft, wild attacks or weather conditions
    a repelling system has been provided by using wireless technologies like Zigbee,
    WIFI, and LoWPAN [88]. B. Agricultural Solutions by Using Smart Phones From the
    last few years it has been observed that integration of electronic devices with
    smartphones innovate the technology world and smartphones are taken as a driver
    of IoT. To make smart phones versatile in agriculture field various hardware and
    software have been designed. A good (but not complete) survey of smart phone apps
    providing agricultural solutions has been presented [98]. Figure 15 showing a
    classification illustration of smart phone apps for smart farming. Morever, there
    is a number of recent apps which are serving similar functionalties. All smart
    phone apps which are elaborated in figure 15 discussed in tabular form with a
    small description of each. These smart phone apps are not limited; developers
    from all over the world have developed many e-Farming apps therefore, this paper
    highlighted some selected apps which have been discussed according to their popularity.
    FIGURE 15. Smartphone applications for agriculture. Show All C. IoT Devices and
    Sensors in Agriculture In today’s modern world everything needs to be automatic
    with less man power by consuming less time. Sensor is such a device which can
    fulfill this requirement by detecting same input from the existing physical environment
    and responds back. User set some setting over sensing devices to perform their
    task without the involvement of human. There are some major IoT sensors like:
    Motion Detector, PIR, Soil Moisture, Temperature, Humidity, Barometric Pressure,
    Ultra Violet, PH, and gas sensor. In Table 3 various sensor based agricultural
    applications, their operations and IoT association have been discussed but table
    2 pay attention only on smart phone agricultural apps. TABLE 2 Smartphone Agricultural
    Applications Description TABLE 3 IoT Sensor Based Applications in Agriculture
    SECTION V. IoT Agricultural Security In the coming years agricultural sector is
    expected to witness the extensive acceptance of IoT and grow through the new e-farming
    IoT applications and devices. These agricultural applications and devices are
    expected to deal with a large amount of sensitive data. Due to the distributed
    nature of IoT a single security protocol is not sufficient therefore, leakage
    of information is a major security concern [107]. If we adopt IoT fully in the
    field of agriculture then it will be more critical to analyze and identify the
    distinctive features of privacy and security like different security requirements
    and threat models in the perspective of Agriculture. On the basis of literature
    some security issues has been presented in Figure 16. FIGURE 16. IoT security
    issues in agriculture. Show All A. Security Requirements IoT based smart farming
    security requirements are similar to standard security scenario. Therefore, to
    achieve a secure farming solution we have need to pay attention on the following
    security requirements: Confidentiality: Agricultural information or personal data
    relevant to it should be accessible only by authorized users. Integrity: Here
    integrity means received and stored data or content is not changed. Authentication:
    Authentication means peer devices should have an identity to which it is communicating.
    Data Freshness: It consists of key freshness and data freshness because IoT agricultural
    networks sometime provides varying measurements, therefore it is necessary to
    ensure that every message is fresh. Non Repudiation: Its means a node can never
    deny to send a message that sent earlier. Authorization: Here authorization means
    for network or any other resources only authorized devices are allowed. Self Healing:
    If any device in an IoT based agricultural network fail or out of energy then
    other devices in the network should be able to provide security to some extent.
    B. Security Challenges Security of IoT based smart farming mainly consists of
    three basic requirements that are Authentication, access control and confidentiality
    of the stakeholders. Whereas, at the perception layer network must be secured
    from external attacks and in the network layer aggregation of the data should
    be secured. Authorize specific entities ensures that only authorized user can
    access data from application layer [28]. The most common issue of security in
    the perception layer is physical security that is the security of hardware and
    information acquisition security [108]. Here physical security is very important
    because all the devices are deployed in an open field. That’s why a single security
    protocol is not enough because IoT devices may be implemented in a diverse environment.
    Another major security issue is leakage of information, this information consist
    of location and sensitive data. Security countermeasures consist of data encryption,
    jamming, blocker tags use, modification in tag frequency, and tag destruction
    strategy. There is a difference between sensor nodes and RFID tags that’s’ why
    while implementing encryption algorithm, intrusion detection policies, key distribution
    and routing policies, hardware restrictions should keep in mind [109]. In IoT
    concept data flows from an end device towards gateway, during this process data
    also uploaded to other platform such as cloud infrastructure. There are multiple
    security policies exist for sensor nodes like identity authentication, data filtering,
    cryptographic algorithm, data flow control mechanisms etc. Cheating, wiretapping,
    replay attacks and tampering are also security threats. Due to which, confidentiality,
    authentication and integrity should be must employed while data acquisitions phase
    [17]. C. Stack Challenges Middleware layer also plays a vital role in IoT to increase
    security. Middleware stands in between application layer and network layer which
    is responsible to process data and provide interface for communication between
    these layers. Middleware layer requires secure and confidential data storage.
    Secure transmission via wireless medium is very challenging in IoT deployment
    due to which IoT based architecture is at risk like vulnerability, denial of services,
    illegal access, and many virus injects. In this way data integrity and confidentiality
    is affected by such attacks. According to IoT vision application layer is one
    of the top most layers and closely related to the cloud due to its computation
    resources and storage nature. Security issue at application layer and cloud are
    very similar such as data security, backup, recovery and privacy. Therefore, access
    rights of the data, information and ownership for physical users, machines and
    organizations should manage and administered by a control mechanisms. D. Threat
    Model Both IoT agricultural devices and networks are at risk because of increasing
    attack surface. IoT agricultural threat model consist of three scenarios. First
    one is cloud networks, second is native networks expansion and third is cloud
    services. Threat may be generates from internal or external network. If an attack
    is arise from an agriculture device then it will be considered as one of the more
    severe attack. Because it is very difficult to detect the malicious device within
    the network. In addition an adversary may attack on an agriculture device and
    network and use power device like mobile, laptop or tablet or may be same kind
    of IoT devices to penetrate the network. E. Attack Taxonomy There are many types
    of attacks in IoT paradigm due to which an attacker may attack by adopting a method
    on future or existing IoT agriculture devices and networks. In IoT agricultural
    field threat may be tangible, predictable or unpredictable. In this paper existing
    and possible threats are classified on the basis of three key factors: which are
    Information Disruption, Host, and networks. 1) Attacks on the Basis of Information
    Disruptions Stored agricultural data may be analyzed or manipulated by a hacker
    to provide wrong information. Such attacks consist of Interruption (denial of
    services), Interception (threaten data privacy and confidentiality), Modification
    (unauthorized access to the agricultural data), Fabrication and replay. 2) Attacks
    on the Basis of Host Properties Host properties attacks occure in two forms namely:
    hardware compromise (attacker may attact on device program code data or keys and
    reprogram the devices with malicious code) and software compromise (attacker may
    take the advantage of software vulnerabilities and glitches like operating system,
    applications software and system software). 3) Attacks on the Basis of Networks
    Properties Two types of attacks can be arised on basis of networks properties.
    Namely: standard protocol compromise (to threat service availability like integrity
    and authenticity where attacker deviates from standard protocols) and network
    protocol stack (consist of different types of vulnerabilities). F. Reference Security
    Model for IoT Based Agriculture IoT agricultural paradigms are not yet strong
    but continued to build up due to which currently it is difficult to discover all
    possible threats and vulnerabilities in IoT agricultural field. However, when
    experts find the security solution to solve the apparent security threats at that
    point they should have the ability to mitigate the hidden security issues. To
    accomplish a security solution, security checks should be deployed with dynamic
    properties. Consider a framework in which security mechanism consist of different
    systems which can detect and prevent IoT agricultural system from attacks. Now
    consider, that an attacker generate a new type of attack on agricultural applications
    devices and networks to steal agricultural information integrity. In such conditions
    existing security techniques should indentify this new attack by using dynamic
    algorithm. A security model presented in Figure 17 has been discussed to resolve
    these issue. The model is illustrated with its three security systems: protection
    system is designed to mitigate the attack while, dignosing system collects activity
    data from agricultural applications, networks, nodes and analyzes detected agricultural
    data. Reaction system is designed to help the agricultural entities survive all
    types of attacks. FIGURE 17. An intelligent collaborative security model for smart
    farming. Show All FIGURE 18. Selected IoT agricultural products. Show All Whole
    system has been designed by following dynamic algorithms. To prevent from present,
    probable and hidden attacks this system has strong collaboration. Upon intrusion
    detection system issues an operation command and store in reaction system after
    that share their anomaly diagnosing experience with protection system to prevent
    from further attacks. Operation command receive response from identification service,
    reaction system remove the system failure risks and after that pass out its experience
    with other two systems that are protection and diagnosing systems. In this way
    a complete inter collaboration system is accomplished. SECTION VI. IoT Agricultural
    Industry Trends and Practices The IoT in agriculture field has experienced a burst
    of creativity, activity, venture capital firms and exciting entrepreneurs. The
    space becomes visible as an active group of large firms and new start ups that
    are willing to become the part of what may be a giant market and technologies.
    In this section an extensive record of some products and technologies has been
    provided for a good understanding of IoT position in agriculture field. 3D Crop
    Sensor Array with PAR Addon can be mounted on any location, to monitor temperature,
    humidity and carbon dioxide in the farm [110]. EC-1 Controller monitors the environmental
    conditions and then programs them to control the environment by turning off and
    on devices [111]. Arable Mark is the first device which links the global weather
    data within the field observations developed by Arable. With the unprecedented
    ground truth accuracy device makes informed decisions and deliveres real time
    monitoring information to the palm of user’s hand [112]. Growlink designed Growlink
    one controller to deliver smart farming experience. It has highest processing
    power and components quality to coordinate with multiple sensors and devices in
    all over the farm. This device is simply all in one and farmers can expand the
    system according to their requirements by adding additional microcontroller via
    IP networks [113]. Easternpeak offers an IoT GreenIQ agricultural device which
    control irrigation and saves water of your garden’s lawn from anywhere. Growers
    can save up to 50% outdoor water bills by using a GreenIQ smart sprinklers controller
    [114]. Grofit provides a climate monitoring device based on Bluetooth and its
    transmission range is up to 200 m in all over field. This device also provide
    data log which store maximum 30 days measurements. Growers can monitor air humidity,
    real time air temperature and sun radiations by using this device [115]. MeteoHelix
    weather station designed by allmeteo which provides reliable, stable and open
    meteorological solutions according to weather requirements. This weather station
    provides multiple features like temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, dew
    point, sun radiations, and solar radiations measurement [116]. Leaf Wetness sensor
    is developed by Smart Element which determine the wetness of leaf by electrical
    resistance on the surface of sensor. It is used to measure wet and dry time on
    the leaf surface [117]. Swip Track Micro locates any moving object in all over
    the field that may be any farming machine, vehicle or engines [118]. Waspmote
    Plug & Sense! Smart Agriculture Xtreme is a sensor node which provides more reliable
    and accurate information about weather. This sensor measures the wind and rainfall
    condition via optical technology. The presence of fertilizers and soil morphology
    can be analyzed through this sensor by measuring the oxygen level, water content,
    and soil water potential [119]. SKY – Lora Weather Station can easily communicate
    to nearby master sensor through LoRa [120]. This is suitable for those locations
    where there is nearby connectivity. This weather station can send data up to 600
    meter away to a master sensor which has WIFI connection. Pycno has been developed
    a Pulse IoT automation sensor which comes in a self-sustained package powered
    by a tiny solar panel [121]. Sensor is WIFI and LoRa enabled device which has
    multiprotocol port in the bottom. In future Pulse Automation Sensor and Pycno
    soil sensor will be integrated to actuate devices and talk with each other in
    the field. CropX Starter Kit – Soil Temperature 24/7 is a real-time soil-temperature
    monitoring Sensor. This sensor has direct cellular connection and better accuracy
    which provides advance sensing capabilities [122]. Some top technologies firm’s
    trends and directions are highlighted in Table 4. TABLE 4 IoT Agricultural Trends
    and Directions of Some Well Known Technology Industries SECTION VII. IoT Smart
    Farming Policies and Success Stories A. Policies Many countries have understood
    the importance of IoT and facilitating through its advance monitoring techniques.
    Government of different countries is seizing the IoT opportunity and investing
    maximum to boost up the crop productivity. Adaptation of IoT technology in different
    countries has been discussed in this section. 1) Australia Government of Australia
    has invested AU$ 134 million to boost up farming. Due to this large investment
    a center was created by a private company in Sidney to implement IoT technologies
    for Smart farming [150]. In 2014 an Innovative Network for Precision Agriculture
    System was established for the purpose of a collaborative frame work to create
    a national agenda in Australian agriculture. In terms of privacy and security,
    in 2015 an American farm Bureau took the lead in establishing a privacy and security
    set for farm data [151]. 2) Ireland Irish Farmer’s Association (IFA) Launched
    a program for agriculturists to reduce the cost, to improve the soil quality and
    guides the farmer how to save water and energy by adopting new technologies [8].
    When the farmers follow these instructions the results were very positive and
    encouraging. Companies saved almost 8700 euro, 10% reduction in green house gas
    emission, 21% savings in pasture management and 47% saving was achieved by Soil
    Fertility. In 2016 a nationwide SigFox network was launched by VT-Networks Ireland
    which provides solution for tracking security sensors and farm assets [153]. 3)
    France Ministry of Agriculture in France has become the partner of the Agriculture
    Innovation Project 2025. The basic aim of this project is to increase the strengthen
    of agricultural land, monitor the climate conditions and create incubators to
    improve agriculture field in France. Ministry of agriculture also share the collected
    data with farmer’s to propose new solution in the field of Agriculture [154].
    French agriculture is administrated by European Union (EU) rules and supported
    through a policy called Common Agriculture Policy (CAP). A new CAP framework was
    defined in 2015 at EU level for next five years which is beneficial for different
    agro ecology projects for farming. 4) China In 2016 china launched its 13th five
    years plan to integrate IoT in the field of agriculture to enhance profitability
    [156]. Project has been started in different eight provinces, with multiple products,
    technologies and 426 applications. Data was collected from multiple provincial
    and national level data centers. Moreover, NB-IoT App by Huawei company in china
    transforming the agriculture in a more efficient and an innovative way. NB-IoT
    provides low cost agriculture solutions as compare to cellular network where gateway
    implementation is not necessary. Huawei NB-IoT has large number of connections
    and wide coverage due to which it can resolve issue of scattered agricultural
    data [157]. 5) Malaysia Agricultural policy in Malaysia was established in two
    periods of time policy before and after independence 1948–1957 and 1957–2020 [158].
    The purpose of the policy was to enhance the growth of crop and decrease the poverty.
    Multiple solutions have been created by Malaysian Institute of Microelectronic
    System (MIMOS) which are best for agriculture development. A sensor named Mi-MSCANT
    PH has been developed by MIMOS to gather environmental data. An agricultural framework
    has been developed by MIMOS to integrate IoT technologies which create a bonding
    between suppliers, traders, and agricultural producers mutually in unified manners.
    This framework utilizes technologies named Micro Electro Mechanical System (MEMS)
    and WSN which automatically collect environmental data [159]. 6) USA USA has funded
    million Dollars to generate new agricultural technologies to fulfill the necessary
    requirements of energy and food. National Institute of Food and Agriculture worked
    on a project that is Internet-of-Ag-Things and develop sensing technologies for
    smart farming practices. The major purpose of this project is to develop precision
    technologies to enhance the efficiency of agriculture industries and make better
    use of water, fertilizers and organic food [160]. The U.S. Department of Agriculture
    (USDA) has started a project to address water management challenges and develop
    new solution for those issues which are affecting agriculture. Technology experts
    are using USDA datasets to improve and design agricultural services [161]. 7)
    Thailand In Thailand National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC)
    applying innovative IT technologies for the purpose of smart farming and their
    major focus is on four agricultural products including Rubber, Rice, Sugar and
    Cassava [162]. The major concern of this movement is to increase the agricultural
    productivity and facilitate the farmers in all rural areas of Thailand [163].
    Faculty of Science and Technology at Thammasat University developed an IoT-based
    irrigation control system which helps the grower to preset watering cycle timing
    in advance. A smart farm service provider namely; FarmD Asia was established in
    2015 to boost up the agricultural productivity by its flagship products. FarmD
    Asia has also designed a pesticides aerial drone which covers upto eight acres
    land in single fly. National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA)
    launched Agricultural System Integrator (ASI) program which was primarily designed
    for farmers to start and run smart farm successfully [164]. 8) India Different
    IoT policies have been formulated by Indian government in order to leverage the
    strength of their agricultural field in all over the world. Indians basic purpose
    is to monitor the earth density, soil conditions, temperature and alerts the farmers
    to control pest related issues. In 2015 a policy on IoT in India was released
    by Ministry of Communication and Information Technology to transform digital landscape
    by using IoT [165]. 9) Philippine Philippines have used the remote sensing techniques
    to increase the production of rice. They are also using ground data processing
    and satellite imagery techniques to generate more information on different agricultural
    conditions. University of Southeastern Philippines (USeP) proposed an intelligent
    solution to monitor crop heat stress by using IoT technology with the collaboration
    of Western Mindanao State University (WMSU). In this project research team is
    on the brink with an effective technology counter heat stress which helps the
    farmer to get maximum benefit with the fewest inputs [166]. B. Food and Agriculture
    Organization of United NATIONSNN Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations
    (FAO) is an e-agricultural organization which follows the international efforts
    to fulfill the deficiency of food in all over 130 countries worldwide. FAO predicted
    that there is a most probability that world population will reach 9.8 billion
    by 2050 therefore, it is necessary to increase the food production 70% by 2050
    to fulfils the growing demand of food through the utilization of IoT technology.
    Mitsubishi Corporation (MC) and Vegetalia, changing Japanese agricultural sector
    by their join forces through AI and IoT. By using tensiometer sensors Tevatronic
    develops an autonomous irrigation system which is placed in the ground near the
    plants for monitoring. From the last 74 years FAO has been changed the agricultural
    world by launching its top ten achievements given in table 5 [167]. TABLE 5 Top
    10 E-Agricultural Strategies of FAO C. IoT Agriculture Success Stories This research
    indicates that there have been several tools and techniques which helps the farmers
    to improve the crop productivity in a more innovative ways. Some IoT agriculture
    relevant technologies have been discussed in section I which provides additional
    tools to the farmers or agriculturists to increase the crop yield. Section III
    describes the different IoT and Smartphone based applications which facilitate
    the farmers to enhance the agriculture productivity by providing extended benefits.
    However over the globe governments are seizing the IoT opportunities in agriculture
    by making large investment. There are many pilot projects which reflects a great
    potential in the future of IoT in agriculture at country level such as china,
    India, Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan etc. Therefore, in this research we have also
    discussed the results of some pilot projects conducted and being executed in different
    countries. Table 6 prepresents the success stories of these pilot projects in
    different countries with the main IoT agricultural applications (precision farming,
    greenhouse, and livestock). TABLE 6 IoT Agriculture Success Stories SECTION VIII.
    IoT Agricultural Challenges Many researchers have worked on IoT agriculture system
    and solve multiple technological issues and architectural problems by implementing
    and designing various IoT agricultural solutions. Moreover, according to the research
    point of view in the literature, there are also several open issues and challenges
    which are needed to address successfully [57]. There are many challenges which
    are linkage with IoT smart farming deployment and applications. This research
    has identified some explored and unexplored IoT agricultural issues and challenges.
    A. Hardware Challenges Several challenges arise in IoT agricultural setup. First
    of all the equipments which exists at the perception layer are directly expose
    to harsh environmental experience such as, rain, high level temperature, extreme
    humidity, hard winds, and many other possible dangers which destroy electronic
    circuits. End devices works consistently for a long period by depending on inadequate
    batteries power resources. So, a suitable programming tools and less power potential
    is necessary because in case of any program failure instantly battery replacement
    is complicated especially in a large scale open field [144]. B. Networking Challenges
    These challenges are not only for the hardware implementations, but also exist
    at the network layer. Due to high cost of wiring, wireless communication is most
    important for the deployment of IoT based agriculture. Physical deployment shows
    that accepted transceivers performance is exaggerated by human presence, temperature,
    humidity and many other barriers inside the space where wireless device or node
    wants to communicate. Due to which there should use most reliable and robust technologies
    to transfer data according to the environmental challenges and rural conditions
    [8]. A detailed analysis on IoT agriculture networking challenges and issues is
    given [145]. C. IoT Agricultural Platforms IoT agricultural architecture is more
    complicated as compare to other IoT end devices and requires real time monitoring
    system with additional stringent requirements. For this a tailored computing platform
    is needed with run time libraries. A service oriented approach (SOA) can also
    take to build a suitable platform; such services can be exploited by using different
    API’s. In addition, appropriate frameworks and libraries should be developed so
    that agricultural developers can make resourceful use of available document, classes,
    codes and other useful data. D. Other Technical Issues 1) Interfernce To implement
    smart farming a large number of IoT devices are deployed for agricultural purpose
    that creates hindrance especially for those IoT devices which are using unlicensed
    spectrum like Sogfox, ZigBee, LoRa, and WIFI. These technical issues reduce the
    reliability and loss of data. Moreover, unnecessary interference can be eliminated
    by using IoT devices with licensed spectrum. But, among the IoT devices which
    are using cellular licensed spectrum the reprocess of non-orthogonal multiple
    access method can create hindrance because of restricted pilot assignment in cellular
    band. 2) Reliability In agriculture field mostly the IoT devices are deployed
    in an open environment. Due to which there may occur some inconsiderate environmental
    impacts which may cause the communication failure as well as degradation of deployed
    sensors. Therefore, physical safety of IoT devices and system is necessary to
    secure the expensive gadgets from unauthorized user and severe attacks like weather
    conditions or theft. 3) Scalability Billions of IoT devices have been increased
    gradually, due to which more devices are getting connected. Therefor, large number
    of gateways and protocols are needed to support IoT devices. Moreover, IoT agricultural
    back end databases and network applications should be reliable and scalable because
    with the addition of diverse application related operations becomes more complex.
    Therefore, design a highly scalable security scheme and an intelligent IoT system
    for each end device. 4) Resource Optimization Farmers need optimization of resources
    to measure how many IoT devices, gateways, size of cloud storage, and amount of
    transmitted data is required. Due to different farm sizes and variables like crop
    or livestock monitoring resource optimization has become challenging because there
    is a need of different sensors and devices to perform each function. Therefore,
    this will require complex mathematical models and algorithms are required to determine
    the resource allocation for maximum agriculture productivity. 5) Cost Analysis
    and Lack Knwoledge of Technology In the field of agriculture profit margin is
    very important, there is a need of stability the trade-off between the deployments
    of IoT enabling technologies. When an IoT system is deployed the cost of implementations
    are very high like IoT devices/Sensors, gateways, and base station infrastructure.
    After that maintenance cost also important for the use of central services which
    are necessary for IoT devices management, data collection, and information sharing
    among all other services. Moreover, the major factor of slowing IoT in rural areas
    is basically the lack knowledge of IoT and its applications. This is the main
    problem because majority of ranchers is uneducated and lives in rural areas. Therefor,
    it is most important to overcome these obstacles by educating farmers in order
    to generate more revnue [7]. 6) Deployment of LPWA Technologies There is a large
    number of IoT devices in Agriculture scenario, and such devices should liable
    to be heterogeneous in the context of their transmit, receive, sleep, and deep
    sleep along with others. In the terms of power requirements each communication
    layer confronts a supplementary challenge. For example, to confirm the service
    accessibility at MAC layer to find a low power device discovery protocol is a
    difficult task. 7) Universal Platform Adaptation of IoT in agriculture will shift
    from just specific crop to a standard platform which can support multiple smart
    farming applications for crop productivity. This standard platform creates a system
    which can be easily modified to support multiple agricultural applications ranging
    from monitoring to managing. This kind of platform will be free from any kind
    of geographical limitations work as an enabler in IoT agriculture system. 8) Mobility
    IoT agricultural network should have the capability to hold up and maintain the
    farmers mobility. So, that they can connect their farms from anywhere at any time
    [146]. 9) Quality of Service (QOS) Recent studies on QoS highlight that at each
    layer of IoT architecture QoS is required [147] [148]. The ability to make sure
    that devices which needs to transmit sensitive information will be capable to
    do this by using IoT technology without any barrier is still an open research
    issue. There is a need to do more work by providing a mechanism that guarantees
    QoS throughout IoT network layers. E. The Business Model IoT agricultural business
    approach is not still vigorous because it consists of a set of essential elements
    with the latest requirements like new operational policies and processes to transform
    the organizational structure. F. Organizational Challenges When talk about food
    organizations and agricultural sectors, is mean the exchange of information and
    goods transportation. IoT is renovating this whole business process by providing
    reliable and accurate delivery of all products and materials [1]. At the circumference
    of network to store and process the data cloud computing provides highest quality
    of services like efficient storage, computational resources, and application development
    tools for hardware diagnostic. That’s why cloud computing is an ideal accompaniment
    in the world of IoT technologies. At the end of the network a large amount of
    data is produced which needs high cost to transfer towards cloud in terms of latency
    and money [18]. Due to which it is a serious issue because of workload and optimal
    balancing. On the other hand fog computing also the cloud computing extension
    which expanding cloud technologies like tools, and the application development
    scope [149]. SECTION IX. Conclusion All over the globe researchers are exploring
    technological solutions to enhance the agriculture productivity in a way that
    complements existing services by deploying IoT technology. In this article, we
    have presented a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art for IoT in agriculture.
    To this end, we discuss agricultural network architecture, platform, and topology
    which help to access to IoT backbone and facilitates farmers to enhance the crop
    productivity. In addition, this article provides an extensive overview on current
    and continuing advances in IoT agricultural applications, devices/sensors, communication
    protocols and many innovative technologies. This research considers various IoT
    agricultural challenges and security requirements for the better understanding
    of IoT smart farming security. Furthermore, many important dimensions of IoT based
    agricultural including technologies, industries trends and countries policies
    have been also been presented to facilitate various stake holders. Government
    has started patronizing IoT in agriculture and it is anticipated that soon IoT
    in agriculture will revamp the conventional farming method. It is also clear that
    many big organizations have started investing and developing new techniques for
    farm management system using IoT. Finally, it is expected that this comprehensive
    survey results into a very useful piece of information for researchers, professionals,
    agriculturists and policy makers who are participating and working in IoT field
    and agricultural technologies. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

    Science ((CCIS,volume 702)) Abstract The fields of precision agriculture, environmental
    engineering, among others, often have applications that use sensors to monitor
    the environment. Examples of such applications include pest control, irrigation
    process, soil fertility mapping, monitoring of forest areas and of urban rivers
    etc. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been proposed as distributed infrastructures
    for these applications. These networks produce a large volume of data and use
    low-cost sensors. However, these sensors usually have low-reliability, generating
    anomalous data (outliers), affecting the final quality of the monitoring. These
    conditions imply the need to use methods for outlier detection and treatment,
    allowing the correct operation of the network and increasing the confidence in
    the monitored data. This article proposes an architecture for information fusion
    focusing on low-reliability sensors. The architecture is integrated with techniques
    for detection and treatment of outliers, and it was evaluated through two case
    studies. The first one involving low-cost barometric pressure sensors, whose monitored
    data were processed by outlier detection techniques. The second one involves the
    LUCE (Lausanne Urban Canopy Experiment) large-scale scenario, whose database is
    fed by 84 sensors for monitoring weather conditions. The results show that some
    of the low-level fusion methods and outliers detection techniques, when combined
    and organized according to the proposed architecture, can replace a single centralized,
    high-cost sensor, maintaining the confidence of the monitored data. Keywords Information

    A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) consists of a network composed of low-cost nodes,
    with small dimensions and with some processing and transmission capacity. In this
    type of network, nodes are equipped with sensors capable of monitoring scalars,
    and they have capabilities that go beyond of simply collecting information. They
    have features that allow them to analyze data, remove spurious data, detect events
    in the environment and perform data fusion of the sensor data, in order to reduce
    the amount of transmitted data. Usually, nodes communicate with a base station,
    thus data can be analyzed and eventually stored [1]. The application fields of
    these networks range from industrial, domestic, military, urban and rural areas
    [2]. WSNs are becoming widely used in automation monitoring processes of various
    physical phenomena. One advantages these networks is that they replace traditional
    centralized monitoring applications, where there is a single sensor monitoring
    the environment. This sensor, being unique, needs to be highly reliable, robust
    and expensive. The deployment of this sensor, in order to guarantee the measurements
    reliability, has a high cost associated. This centralized approach also entails
    costly maintenance because, commonly, data storage is done in data loggers that
    are dedicated devices for locally storing data collected by sensors. The high
    cost of maintenance is also a problem, since there is often a requirement that
    this type of sensor is deployed in places of difficult access, making it impossible
    to constantly replace its batteries and making difficult the access to data loggers.
    Consequently, several applications that use a WSN infrastructure, such as environmental
    monitoring, are no longer exclusively investigated by the academy and are gradually
    being adopted by companies, replacing traditional solutions [3]. However, there
    are several challenges that need to be overcome, for example: (i) large amount
    of data, (ii) energy consumption of nodes must be reduced and (iii) there are
    difficulties in detecting anomalous data, and when these data are detected, they
    need to classify whether they are spurious data (e.g. resulting from sensor failures)
    or relevant events in the environment (e.g. forest fire). This work focuses on
    problems (i) to (iii), dealing with them from the point of view of data fusion
    methods [4,5,6,7]. These techniques, through the mathematical manipulation of
    the monitored data set, are capable of handling large amounts of data and can
    reduce the energy consumption. Besides, they are able to increase the degree of
    truthfulness of the monitored network data. More specifically, this paper proposes
    that these problems can be treated in a systematic way, through an information
    fusion architecture that organizes data flow and the various activities required
    to integrate different types of data fusion techniques. The main question that
    motivates this work is to know if a set of low-cost sensors can replace the conventional
    use of centralized and high-cost sensors, maintaining, or even increasing, the
    degree of truthfulness achieved in the monitored data. In the following of this
    article, the relevant aspects of information fusion are presented in Sect. 2.
    The proposal of an architecture for the data fusion of WSN low-cost sensor data
    is presented in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4, a case study is described, which uses low-cost
    barometric sensors. In Sect. 5, in order to assess the proposed architecture in
    an environment with a higher number of nodes and greater information traffic,
    is introduced a case study of temperature sensors installed in a large scale area.
    Finally, some final considerations and future works are presented. 2 Background
    2.1 Information Fusion Information Fusion (or data fusion) is a largely used denomination
    [3], and can be defined as the investigation of efficient methods that automatically
    or semi-automatically can transform information of several sources and with different
    time stamps to a consistent information. This information can be used by humans
    or machines for decision making. The advantages of using a multisensor information
    fusion are high availability, better spatial and temporal coverage and better
    accuracy and/or precision. However, when a large number of sensors present erroneous
    sensing values, the global performance of the system can be affected [8, 9]. Large
    WSNs based on low-cost nodes are generally used in the monitoring of scalars.
    However, these low-cost sensors are not reliable individually. Thus, data fusion
    methods are used to overcome this low reliability based on the fusion of several
    sensor readings. This way, data fusion can be used to detect outliers [10]. The
    techniques for information fusion can be classified according to the abstraction
    level of the sensed data [11]. In low-level data fusion, the raw sensed data is
    provided as inputs and combined directly with other raw data, assuming that the
    resulting data will present more accuracy than the individual inputs. In the intermediate
    level, the data abstraction occurs in such a way that it is possible to represent
    an object in a precise and concise way. In the high-level data fusion or decision-making
    process, decision-making takes place based on information from the low- and middle-level
    layers, where a priori knowledge and specific information about decision-making
    can be incorporated. Data Fusion can be also classified based on the topology
    of sensors [12]. In the complementary configuration, sensors do not depend directly
    on each other but act in a cooperative way to obtain a complete picture of the
    observed phenomenon. In a redundant configuration, independent measurements of
    the same property are provided at different times or by two or more sources at
    the same instant in order to provide better accuracy. In the cooperative configuration,
    information is provided by more than one sensor to derive information that would
    not be available if only one were used. Typically, in this type of data fusion,
    there is a loss of precision and reliability. 2.2 Outlier Detection Methods This
    section addresses some statistical methods for outlier detection in wireless sensor
    networks. The choice of these methods is justified: it does not require a history
    of the previous messages and the low computational nodes consumption. Detection
    can be performed, for example, by simple inspection of the sensor operating range.
    Therefore, the sensed data that are outside the sensor operational range must
    be discarded. In outlier data fusion methods, the data of the sensors are compared
    in order to detect possible conflicting sensors. Several data fusion algorithms
    can be considered. In our architecture, we consider as an appropriate algorithm,
    the one with the ability to compare the data obtained by the sensors involved
    in the data fusion and, following a specific criterion, to decide whether or not
    to suppress its data. However, it is not desirable to unnecessarily exclude sensor
    observations when the readings are correct. Besides, it is convenient that when
    an observation is discarded, somehow the algorithm has the ability to clearly
    mark or show which sensor and why the data must discarded. Due to uncertainty
    about the quality of the low-cost sensors, it is desirable that the algorithm
    has mechanisms capable of computing sensor quality during the data fusion process.
    A widely used method for data fusion is a simple average, which is not suitable
    for the vast majority of applications. The following subsections describe the
    main characteristics of methods evaluated in this article. It is important to
    note that there are several other techniques that could be evaluated, such as,
    for example, techniques based on the Kalman filter [8]. However, these approaches
    are statefull, since they require a history of the previous messages of each sensor,
    and the methods studied in this paper are stateless. A. Fault Tolerant Average
    - FTA One of the methods of sensor fusion with a simple application and good results
    is the Fault Tolerant Average (FTA) proposed by [13]. Basically, it divides an
    ordered set of data into three parts, eliminating the edges. The first step in
    this technique is to sort the set of data sent by the sensor nodes. Taking \(t
    = N / 3\), where N is the size of the set, we discard the borders of the ordered
    sample, that is, the largest and the smallest t values. This approach assumes
    that if there are outliers, they will be removed along with those “extreme” values.
    The final value is the calculation of mean and standard deviation of the remaining
    values. B. Confidence-Weighted Averaging - CWA Elmenreich [3] proposed a data
    fusion method setting for each sensor a value of “confidence” inversely associated
    with the variance of the sensor. Variance is a useful measure in many cases because
    they are additive, thus different groups of data can be compared. The standard
    deviation, in turn, has the advantage of being expressed in the same unit as the
    measured variable, making it easier to compare results. Following this approach,
    in the best case, the variance is close to zero, achieving a maximum confidence
    value. The worst-case variance can be calculated as the variation of a random
    function evenly distributed between the limits a and b, where these values are
    the minimum and maximum values of a uniformly distributed random function. C.
    CWA+FTA Method Elmenreich [3] suggested that CWA could be used in conjunction
    with other methods, such as FTA proposed by [13]. Thus the method becomes fault
    tolerant and considers the quality of the sensor in the data fusion. The method
    consists of calculating the weighted mean including all sensors using the CWA
    method and subsequently eliminating 2/3 of the sensors as specified in the FTA
    and calculating the weighted average again. D. Modified CWA with a Test of Fixed
    Value Locked Sensor The method proposed in [3] to fuse information from different
    sensors, prioritizes the sensors with lower variance. An exception pointed out
    by the author of the algorithm is that, if the variance is zero, some treatment
    to avoid division by zero is required. However, in preliminary experiments carried
    out in this work, another problem was observed, since, as the proposed architecture
    is focused on WSNs using low-cost sensors. It was observed in some execution scenarios
    that readings of data collected by a single sensor could have equal values for
    a long period of time, characterizing a faulty and locked sensor. This sensor
    lock may be permanent or temporary for a short or long time. This locked sensor,
    due to its low variance, makes its incorrect data contribute to a greater weight
    in the calculation of the weighted average than the correct sensors. Thus, a simple
    alteration of the original algorithm was necessary for implementation. Basically,
    when a sensor exhibits variations between readings below and a specified value
    (and dependent on the type and specification of the sensor), its calculated variance
    will be artificially increased to the maximum possible value, thus contributing
    minimally to the weighted average calculation. E. Chauvenet Method The Chauvenet
    criterion is a statistical method that was developed for detection of outliers,
    and can be used to Byzantine fault detection. It is based on the hypothesis that
    an arbitrary measurement can be rejected if the probability of obtaining the deviation
    from the mean to this value is less than the inverse of twice the number of measurements
    [14]. The sample size is very important in using the method because, with a large
    sample, there is little chance that one of the values influence the average significantly.
    A divergent value in a large sample should be very far from the average to move
    to distribution. This makes the use of few data requirements. F. Peirce Criterion
    The Peirce method is a statistical technique for detecting outliers, in a sample
    with normal behavior. The original article dates from 1852, however, it is widely
    used on current days [14]. The basic idea of the proposed method is that the observations
    should be rejected when the actual deviations from the mean obtained by keeping
    them, are less than the deviations obtained by its rejection, multiplied by the
    probability of making as many and not more, unusual observations. Hence, the goal
    of his technique was to generate error probabilities occurring in the system where
    all n observations are retained versus the rejected samples. Thus, k observations
    are rejected and it checks whether the sample is closer to normal than previous
    one. The Peirce Criterion provides for detection of more than one discordant data
    in the sample. However, Peirce’s calculation method is mathematically complex
    to use. In this way, there are tables derived from the work of Peirce [15] that
    can be used To improve the performance of the calculations. 3 Architecture for
    Low-Cost Sensor Data Fusion In this paper we propose an architecture for monitoring
    with WSN and divides the activities carried out into three layers: Local Fusion
    Layer, Low-Level Fusion Layer, Management Layer and User Interface (Fig. 1). Fig.
    1. Proposed architecture for sensor data fusion in WSN. Full size image The main
    contribution of this article is in the definition of the Low-Level Fusion Layer,
    which is responsible for receiving data from the WSN, processing, and forwarding
    to the Management Layer and User Interface layer [11]. Techniques commonly employed
    in the Local Fusion Layer are presented in the following. 3.1 Local Data Fusion
    Layer The purpose of this level of processing is to configure the sensors to collect
    data about the environment where they are inserted, to perform some type of local
    data fusion, and to forward the data for the transmission. One of the first steps
    is to check with the sensor manufacturer the recommended sampling rates. It is
    also necessary to check if there is any kind of adjustment to be made in the sensor,
    such as micro calibration. Depending on the rate, it can be applied locally to
    the data, such as the arithmetic average. Some methods in the upper layers of
    the architecture may use other information in its processing, such as variance
    or variance generated by the local data fusion method. For the calculation of
    these values, a good option is to perform the fusion between beacons Footnote
    1. 3.2 The Low-Level Data Fusion Layer The low-level data fusion layer is subdivided
    into: calibration; timestamping; detection of systematic and gross errors; methods
    of fusion and feedback (Fig. 1). Sensor calibration is a fundamental problem in
    WSN [16]. It consists of the set of establishes and corrects the difference between
    a measured value and the true value. In some cases, it may consist of an additive
    or multiplicative correction of the indication with a measurement uncertainty.
    As the true value is ignored, the calibration tends to minimize the difference
    between the read value and the true value of importance. The calibration of each
    device, individually and manually, known as a micro-calibration may be intractable
    when a large number of sensors is considered [16]. Therefore, self-calibration
    can be employed in this process. A conventional calibration is the readings corrections
    of each sensor based on a common reference, or be based on the reference of a
    sensors group [17]. In the proposed architecture, low-level data fusion can be
    executed online or offline. In the case of off-line data fusion, cluster heads
    do not perform the role of fusion centers, they only forward the data received
    towards the PAN coordinator, where the data fusion will be carried out. Offline
    data fusion can be considered for further study of the observed environment. In
    this case, it is necessary to associate time stamps referring to the moment of
    observation of each stored data. Data Fusion Centers play an important role in
    the Low-level Data Fusion when online data fusion occur, being paramount in WSN
    that also have actuators, so that their results can be used immediately. 4 Experimental
    Assessment The proposed architecture is tested through a case study. An environmental
    monitoring application based on atmospheric pressure is used to validate the proposal.
    Atmospheric pressure is important for several applications like meteorology and
    environmental engineering. Usually, just one sensor (high-quality sensor) is used,
    however, it is a high-cost sensor. The chosen place to execute the experiments
    was near the Hercilio Luz Airport in Florianópolis, SC-Brazil. Figure 2 shows
    the external reference sensor that was used for comparison (identified in this
    work as Vaisala), this reference sensor is used by the Brazilian Air Force and
    is located near the end of an airport landing strip, at 5 m high. The distance
    between the airport sensor (reference sensor) and the site of the experiments
    is 1300 m. Moreover, aiming the comparison between the low-cost sensor and the
    reference sensor, another reference sensor was used (identified in this work as
    internal reference sensor Young). Fig. 2. Place of experiment. Full size image
    The communication between experimental sensors was performed based on an IEEE
    802.15.4 wireless sensor network in star topology. Four low-cost sensors were
    used in the experiments, which is required by data fusion techniques discussed
    in previous sessions of this paper. The fifth node was configured as a PAN coordinator,
    this node is responsible for storing data. The WSN was configured in beacon mode,
    PAN coordinator is responsible for synchronizing the networks through beacon sending.
    In order to configure the network the periodicity of the application was BO =11,
    that defines a Beacon Interval (BI) of 30 s. Other nodes were equipped with the
    low-cost sensor, and the system was implemented over the MAC layer. This way,
    it was not used WSN operating systems like TinyOS or FreeRTOS. Nodes 1, 2, 3 and
    4 use 2 1.5 V batteries for the embedded system and sensors. Node 5 use AC/DC
    power and was connected to a computer using serial communication. The collected
    data were stored in text file using the following format: \({<}timestamp, node
    [1 - 10],\) variance \([1 - 10]{>}\). The base station computer was synchronized
    through NTP protocol, the same protocol used in the airport system. The data fusion
    was performed later due to experiment constraints. 4.1 Experimental Results The
    first data analysis was based on internal and external reference sensor. The main
    goal was to verify the proximity of internal and external reference sensors. It
    was selected data regarding 24 h of readings and the average of atmospheric pressure
    was calculated (Fig. 3). Fig. 3. Reference sensors comparison. Full size image
    In order to make the comparison, it was necessary to compute the difference of
    altitude among two sensors (more or less 1.5 m), that is 0.1 hPa. Besides the
    altitude, it was considered the precision of sensors. It is informed that sensor
    readings may vary 0,3 hPa, thus the reading difference between two sensors can
    not be over 0,6 hPa. It was observed that the maximum difference was 0,25 hPa.
    Thus, we considered that the reference sensor is validated, this validation is
    based on external reference sensor (Vaisala) that is periodically calibrated,
    because these readings are used for landing and take-off operations. The data
    collected by sensors and the results obtained by data fusion will be compared
    just with the internal reference sensor. Diverse analysis was performed in order
    to assess the data fusion techniques. In this paper, we present an analysis of
    a data sample that contains an incorrect sensor (Fig. 4). Fig. 4. Data sample
    with a discordant sensor. Full size image It is possible to note that this sensor
    always sends the same atmospheric pressure reading, thus it is considered a high
    precision sensor (variance zero). However, the difference observed is due to the
    low battery level of nodes. Figure 4 shows that values of Bosch4 sensor remain
    different from reference sensor 1.31 hPa, and other sensors just 0,07 hPa. Fig.
    5. Application of data fusion methods. Full size image Figure 5 shows the results
    of data fusion techniques over these data. The average method shows the worst
    performance due to the fact that all data are considered in the data fusion method.
    The erroneous sensor in the sample causes a distortion in the final result and
    it is not possible to detect the outlier. The Chauvenet method detects the sensor
    4 as an outlier, obtaining the same result of the arithmetic mean. It is interesting
    to note that if the reference sensor was considered in data fusion, the Chauvenet
    method would achieve a better performance: the outlier would be eliminated and
    the average will be performed with other sensors. The Peirce method could also
    detect the sensor 4 as an outlier. The maximum difference between reference sensor
    and the data fusion value was 0.03 hPa. MTF always discard the values of 2/3 of
    sensors, even if these values are similar, this behavior is not noticed in Chauvenet
    and Peirce. Elmenreich method (CWA) can be considered a complete method, because
    it considers the sensor quality. However, the variance values must be available.
    There are three ways to execute the method. The first one considers just variance
    informed by sensors (CWA); the second way includes the modifications proposed
    in this paper (altered CWA) and, finally, the modified CWA algorithm combined
    with a fault tolerant average (CWA+FTA). It is possible to notice that results
    presented in Table 1 show that Elmenreich method (CWA) presents a bad performance,
    obtaining a 1,2 hPa from the reference sensor. This result shows that when a sensor
    presents equal readings, the variance is zero and the system presents the highest
    level of confidence in the faulty sensor. Table 1. Elmenreich method. Full size
    table When modified CWA method is used, we consider that a sensor with constant
    variance near zero, during a certain period, is considered an outlier, and its
    variance is artificially raised to a maximum value. Thus, the use of faulty sensor
    in the weighted average does not change the result, and an approximate value from
    the reference sensor was achieved. CWA+MTF achieved values near the reference
    values. Table 2 shows the results of MTF and CWA+MTF. It is possible to notice
    that readings of sensor 2 were considered by all methods and the values from sensor
    4 were discarded by CWA+MTF and MTF. However, sensor 1 even presenting correct
    readings was discarded in 80% of data fusion tasks. When MTF results are compared
    with reference sensor readings, 0,02 hPa value is showed. Table 2. MTF and CWA+MTF
    averages with sensor 4 as a source of outliers. Full size table 5 Simulation Assessment
    of a Large-Area WSN In the previous section, it was concluded that the use of
    low-cost sensors in a cooperative way to perform the monitoring is equivalent
    in terms of results to the use of a centralized high-cost sensor. In this section,
    the goal is to extend the scenario and number of nodes to evaluate the behavior
    of statistical methods to detect outliers in WSN. Based on this premise and due
    to the technical difficulties to build a real large-scale WSN, a simulator was
    used for this study. Fig. 6. Sensorscope Lausanne Urban Canopy Experiment (LUCE).
    Full size image 5.1 Large-Area Scenario Description The dataset used for the simulation
    and validation of the methods has been obtained through the project LUCE Footnote
    2 (Lausanne Urban Canopy Experience). The WSN that was structured in a campus
    of the Federal Polytechnic School of Lausanne (EFPL). This network was deployed
    with 110 nodes distributed over an area of 300\(\,\times \,\)400 m, characterizing
    a large-scale WSN [18]. The objective of this project was to monitor the meteorological
    changes and various data was collected, such as temperature, relative air humidity,
    wind speed among other physical magnitudes. The data collected, and made available
    for public use, corresponds to the period from July 2006 to May 2007. In this
    paper, just 85 nodes were used in the simulator, being one of them assumed as
    the coordinator of the network (sink). The distribution of the nodes across the
    campus is illustrated in Fig. 6. The data used to assess the methods was sensed
    in a 24-hour period, referring to April 03, 2007; and just one physical scalar
    was used: the temperature. For the WSN simulation, the Castalia 3.0 framework
    was used Footnote 3. Castalia is an open source simulator based on the OMNeT++
    platform Footnote 4, and focused on WSNs and BANs (Body Area Networks) simulation.
    The reason for its choice was motivated by the great acceptance and use in the
    WSN community for its realistic characteristics, in terms of radio models, as
    well as the possibility to change algorithms and protocols [19]. 5.2 Evaluated
    Methods Four outlier statistical techniques were evaluated using the Castalia
    simulator. These methods were selected based on their characteristics, previously
    highlighted, that best meet the sensor networks scenario. The methods evaluated
    were: Chauvenet, Peirce, FTA and CWA+FTA. Parametrizing the simulations for the
    evaluated methods: The monitoring was performed every 30 s and after obtaining
    30 readings the outlier detection method was applied; Each sensor node uses the
    outlier detection algorithm; After the detection process, each node sends to the
    coordinator the average. In order to analyze the efficiency of the outlier detection
    methods, outliers were inserted into the monitoring data. The choice of outliers
    values was chosen at random. In order to analyze the results, nine nodes with
    the best frequency of submissions to the coordinator were selected. The chosen
    nodes reached 100% of freight rate and 36 outliers were distributed between nodes.
    The Fig. 7 shows the temperature readings of nodes in a fifteen minute period
    together based on artificial outliers. It is possible to observe the discrepancy
    of the values and the need for treatment so that these anomalous data do not change
    the result, thus modifying the real value of the means. Thus, results for the
    analyzed methods were described: Fig. 7. Sensed values with/without outliers’
    detection. Full size image Chauvenet: Chauvenet method detected 13 outliers from
    36 artificial outliers (Table 3). As can be seen in Fig. 8, points from the temperature
    of 10 \(^\circ \)C, have many points farther from the normal behavior of the captured
    readings. Peirce: Peirce technique shows a behavior very similar to that of Chauvenet,
    13 outliers were correctly identified (Table 3). In Fig. 9, it is possible to
    notice that the undiscovered outliers present results very similar to the Chauvenet
    method. FTA Method: This method proved to be very efficient in outliers detection,
    it was able to find all the inserted outliers (Table 3). Despite being a relatively
    simple method it proved to be efficient for detection and removal of outliers.
    Figure 10 above shows the readings resulting from the FTA method, a problem identified
    is the aimless removal even of values that are not considered anomalous by always
    excluding 2/3 of samples. CWA+FTA: The Elmenreich technique combined with FTA
    method obtained results similar to the FTA method, reaching 100% efficiency in
    outliers detection (Table 3). Fig. 8. Event detection using Chauvenet method.

    with the CWA+FTA method. Full size image 5.3 Comparative Analysis of Methods The
    methods have generally obtained good results in the detection of large-scale WSN
    outliers. However, the FTA and CWA+FTA methods detected 100% of the outliers.
    On the other hand, Peirce and Chauvenet methods detected just 36.11% of the outliers.
    Table 3 shows the outliers detected per node. Table 3. Amount of outliers detected.
    Full size table The Table 4 presents the final averages of the readings of the
    nodes by analyzed method. The Table 4 shows the resulting averages. As a result,
    the table shows that outliers detection techniques are necessary to provide higher
    accuracy in monitoring. In the analysis, nodes 1, 15 and 18 present high averages,
    the presence of outliers, which do not correspond to the normal behavior of the
    temperature variation in that period. In this way, it must be withdrawn in order
    to not disturb the final average. For example at node 15, six outliers were inserted
    into the set of readings, which resulted in an average of 20.63 \(^\circ \)C degrees.
    After the application of the CWA+FTA technique, the average resulted in 9.61 \(^\circ
    \)C degrees. Thus, an average reduction in temperature was 46.58% when compared
    to the average with outliers. FTA technique presented a reduction of 46.97%, while
    Chauvenet and Peirce techniques did not change the average. Thus, outliers were
    not removed. After the detection and removal of the outliers with the FTA and
    CWA+FTA techniques, it is possible to observe the regularization of final node
    average, through a data fusion information more accurate and reliable (Fig. 11).
    Table 4. Local averages obtained by each technique, in degrees Celsius. Full size
    table In summary, comparing the outliers detection capability, both the CWA+FTA
    and the FTA technique achieved the same results, Table 4. Regarding precision,
    the techniques also obtained similar results, according to Table 4. 6 Conclusions
    WSNs based on low-cost sensors have been replacing the traditional centralized
    systems that use a single, reliable, high-cost sensor. WSN advantages like deployment
    flexibility, better area coverage and low-cost sensors are the main reasons for
    its choose. However, new challenges emerge as these networks become popular. For
    example, they generate a large amount of data, need to have an adequate operation
    due to its limited energy budget, as well as failures and errors caused by WSN
    nodes equipped with low-cost sensors. Thus the use of raw data generated by sensor
    nodes has not been suitable. Therefore, this work focuses on these problems, treating
    them from the point of view of the methods of information fusion, that is, techniques
    that reduce the amount of data and increase its reliability. The proposed architecture
    was applied in the monitoring of environments. Low-cost sensors were calibrated
    based on a reference sensor. Without this operation, the fusion methods would
    not reach the expected performance due to the constant deviation of the values
    observed in the low-cost sensors. The timestamps were added, making it feasible
    to perform offline the data fusion. Systematic and gross errors, such as “zero”
    values, were correctly discarded before reaching the fusion methods. Among the
    experimentally tested methods, Peirce and CWA+FTA were more suitable for the fusion
    of the sensors. However, the arithmetic means, Chauvenet and CWA without modifications,
    did not perform well in the presence of faulty nodes. In the simulation of a large-scale
    WSN, the CWA+MTF and FTA methods were the best at eliminating all outliers; while
    the Chauvenet and Peirce methods did not perform satisfactorily since they did
    not detect much of the outliers. Regarding accuracy, the Chauvenet and Peirce
    techniques obtained poor results in their means when compared to CWA+FTA and FTA.
    Therefore, the CWA+FTA and FTA techniques have achieved good results in the large-scale
    simulated WSN scenarios giving good detection, accuracy and reliability in monitoring.
    As a conclusion, the WSN configuration used in conjunction with low-cost sensors
    and the proposed architecture deliver as good performance as the use of a single
    high-cost sensor. Notes 1. Beacons are control packets periodically generated

    \ of Things (IoT)-based automation of agricultural events can change the agriculture\n\
    sector from being static and manual to dynamic and smart, leading to enhanced\
    \ production with\nreduced human efforts. Precision Agriculture (PA) along with\
    \ Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) are the\nmain drivers of automation in the agriculture\
    \ domain. PA uses speciﬁc sensors and software to ensure\nthat the crops receive\
    \ exactly what they need to optimize productivity and sustainability. PA includes\n\
    retrieving real data about the conditions of soil, crops and weather from the\
    \ sensors deployed in the\nﬁelds. High-resolution images of crops are obtained\
    \ from satellite or air-borne platforms (manned\nor unmanned), which are further\
    \ processed to extract information used to provide future decisions.\nIn this\
    \ paper, a review of near and remote sensor networks in the agriculture domain\
    \ is presented\nalong with several considerations and challenges. This survey\
    \ includes wireless communication\ntechnologies, sensors, and wireless nodes used\
    \ to assess the environmental behaviour, the platforms\nused to obtain spectral\
    \ images of crops, the common vegetation indices used to analyse spectral\nimages\
    \ and applications of WSN in agriculture. As a proof of concept, we present a\
    \ case study\nshowing how WSN-based PA system can be implemented. We propose an\
    \ IoT-based smart solution\nfor crop health monitoring, which is comprised of\
    \ two modules. The ﬁrst module is a wireless sensor\nnetwork-based system to monitor\
    \ real-time crop health status. The second module uses a low altitude\nremote\
    \ sensing platform to obtain multi-spectral imagery, which is further processed\
    \ to classify\nhealthy and unhealthy crops. We also highlight the results obtained\
    \ using a case study and list the\nchallenges and future directions based on our\
    \ work.\nKeywords: smart agriculture; precision agriculture; vegetation index;\
    \ Internet of Things\n1. Introduction\nThe rapidly-growing human population has\
    \ increased food demands for human survival on\nthe Earth. Meeting the food requirements\
    \ with limited resources of the planet is a big challenge [1].\nSeveral state-of-the-art\
    \ technologies are being incorporated in the agriculture domain to enhance\nthe\
    \ productivity to cope with this challenge. Precision Agriculture (PA) is comprised\
    \ of near and\nremote sensing techniques using IoT sensors, which help to monitor\
    \ crop states at multiple growth\nlevels. PA involves the acquisition and processing\
    \ of a large amount of data related to crop health.\nMultiple parameters are involved\
    \ in plants health, including water level, temperature and others.\nPA enables\
    \ a farmer to know precisely what parameters are needed for healthy crop, where\
    \ these\nparameters are needed and in what amount at a particular instance of\
    \ time. This requires collecting\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796; doi:10.3390/s19173796\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n2 of 25\nmassive information\
    \ from different sources and different parts of the ﬁeld such as soil nutrients,\
    \ the\npresence of pests and weeds, chlorophyll content in plants and some weather\
    \ conditions. All collected\ninformation needs to be analysed to produce agronomic\
    \ recommendations. For instance, given the\ndevelopmental stage of plants, their\
    \ level of greenness (chlorophyll content) reveals the nutrients\nneeded. This\
    \ information is combined with the characteristics of the soil where the plant\
    \ is located\nalong with weather forecast. All collected information is further\
    \ used to determine how much of a\ncertain fertilizer should be applied to that\
    \ plant on the next day. The delivery of agronomic information\non the right time\
    \ to farmer and ensuring that he/she applies these recommendations are key to\n\
    enhancing the yields.\nThe foremost driver of PA is a WSN, which is a network\
    \ of multiple wireless nodes connected\ntogether to monitor the physical parameters\
    \ of environment. Each wireless node is comprised of a\nradio transceiver, a micro-controller,\
    \ sensor(s), an antenna, along with other circuitry that enables it\nto communicate\
    \ with some gateway to transmit information collected by the sensor(s) [2]. Sensors\n\
    measure the physical parameters and send the collected information to the controller,\
    \ which further\ntransmits this information to the cloud or a portable device.\
    \ The agriculture sector has multiple\nrequirements comprised of soil statistics,\
    \ crops’ nature, weather conditions, fertilizer types and water\nrequirements.\
    \ Crops have diverse requirements depending on different crops on the same land\
    \ and the\nsame plant on different lands with different weather conditions. Sensors\
    \ monitor the varying behaviour\nof these crop parameters. Due to rapid advancement\
    \ in WSN technologies, the size and the cost of\nsensors have reduced, which make\
    \ it feasible to implement them in many sectors of life including\nagriculture.\
    \ The most common sensors used in the agriculture domain that capture environmental\n\
    parameters related to crops [3] are listed in Table 1.\nIn general, a WSN consists\
    \ of one or more wireless nodes that are further connected with sensors.\nThese\
    \ nodes are tiny devices that are responsible for collecting data. Nodes are divided\
    \ into two types,\na source node that collects the data, and the other is sink\
    \ or gateway node, which receives data from the\nsource nodes. A sink node has\
    \ more computational power compared to a source node. However, there\nare energy,\
    \ memory, power, size, data rate and price constraints when choosing wireless\
    \ nodes. Table 2\nshows a comparison of wireless nodes along with their common\
    \ speciﬁcations [3]. Among all wireless\nnodes presented in Table 2, MICA2 is\
    \ considered to be more suitable as compared to others because of\nits large number\
    \ of expansion connectors, which makes it suitable to connect with several sensors.\n\
    Many applications using WSN have been proposed since the last decade to monitor\
    \ crops’ health\nremotely. In [4], a cyber-physical system was presented for monitoring\
    \ of a potato crop. Cyber physical\nsystems can be expressed as smart systems\
    \ that are comprised of software, hardware and physical\ncomponents, integrated\
    \ together to sense the varying states of the real world. The proposed system\n\
    consists of three layers: the ﬁrst layer is the physical layer, in which all sensory\
    \ data are collected;\nthe second layer is the network layer in which data are\
    \ transmitted to the cloud; the third layer is\nthe decision layer in which the\
    \ data are analysed and processed to make decisions according to the\nobservations.\n\
    There are several challenges in IoT-based systems due to exponential increasing\
    \ devices. As in\na typical IoT network, every node transmits data to the remote\
    \ cloud, which results in cloud\ncongestion, and the main challenges underlying\
    \ the IOT-based system are latency with minimum\npower requirements, better usage\
    \ of bandwidth and intermittent Internet connectivity. Fog computing\nand edge\
    \ computing are the state-of-the-art techniques to overcome these issues; which\
    \ reduce the\ncomputational burden of cloud. The main goal of fog computing is\
    \ to conserve energy and bandwidth,\nwhich helps to increase the quality of service\
    \ to the end users. In [5], an energy-efﬁcient architecture of\nthe Fog of Everything\
    \ was presented, which was comprised of six layers. The ﬁrst layer was an Internet\n\
    Of Everything (IOE) layer, where things (could be ﬁxed, mobile or nomadic) functioned\
    \ under multiple\nspatially-distributed clusters. The second was a wireless access\
    \ network that supported Thing to Fog\n(T2F) and Fog to Thing (F2T) communication\
    \ over the wireless channel. In the third layer, the connected\nfog nodes behaved\
    \ such as a virtualized cluster. There was an inter-fog backbone in the fourth\
    \ layer,\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n3 of 25\nwhich was responsible for connectivity\
    \ among fog nodes. The next layer was the virtualization layer,\nwhich provided\
    \ each connected thing with the ability to augment its limited resource set, exploiting\n\
    the computation capability at the virtual clone. In the last layer, there was\
    \ an overlay inter-clone\nvirtual network that empowered Peer to Peer (P2P) communication.\
    \ Then, a protocol stack for FOE\nwas presented, which was further tested by creating\
    \ a small prototype named as V-FOE and simulated\non the iFogsim toolkit. The\
    \ results provided strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed\nframework\
    \ and more energy efﬁciency with reduced failure rate and delay.\nTable 1. Wireless\

    The energy efﬁciency is the most serious consideration while developing any fog\
    \ architecture.\nIn [6], an energy-efﬁcient protocol for a fog-supported wireless\
    \ sensor network was presented, which\nmaximized the lifetime of the network by\
    \ uniformly distributing the energy among connected nodes.\nThe performance of\
    \ the proposed algorithm was compared with the existing state-of-the-art algorithms\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 3796\n4 of 25\nin MATLAB. The results showed that the proposed\
    \ algorithm was highly energy efﬁcient with a\nprolonged network lifetime.\nRegardless\
    \ of all the advancements in the IoT domain, the adoption of PA has been limited\
    \ to\nsome developed countries. Because of the lack of resources, remote sensing-based\
    \ techniques to\nmonitor crop health are not common in under-developed countries\
    \ such as Pakistan, which results in\na loss of yield. Pakistan is an agricultural\
    \ country due to is large arable land and climatic variations,\nwhich make it\
    \ suitable to cultivate multiple types of crops. Despite all these natural resources,\
    \ Pakistan\nis still unable to produce massive yields [7]. The main reason behind\
    \ the low production is traditional\nfarming practices, which are used for crop\
    \ health monitoring and yield estimation. These techniques\nare completely based\
    \ on farmer’s intuition and experience. Farmers visit the ﬁelds in order to monitor\n\
    the crop, which is very laborious and quite challenging in the case of large arable\
    \ land. In this case, the\narea under insect/pest attack is inaccurately measured,\
    \ which can result in over spraying of insecticide\nand pesticide, which adversely\
    \ affects the nutrition in crops.\nKeeping in mind all these issues, our motivation\
    \ is to provide the industry and research\ncommunities with a survey of technologies,\
    \ metrics and current practices concerning communication\ndevices, sensors and\
    \ platforms used to monitor and analyse multiple sources of data (spectral images,\n\
    IoT, etc.) used in environmental and agriculture applications. As the main contribution,\
    \ we generated\na technological taxonomy for PA, which was driven by an IoT-based\
    \ architecture to monitor the crops’\nhealth. The developed system had two modules\
    \ including wireless sensor network-based crop heath\nmonitoring in which multiple\
    \ sensors were used to get the real-time heath status of crop; the other\none\
    \ was NDVI-based analysis of spectra images captured by a drone to assess the\
    \ chlorophyll content,\nwhich was further used to monitor the health of the crop.\n\

    \ protocols have been introduced in the last few decades due to the rapid\nincrease\
    \ in IoT devices and WSN technologies. Each protocol has its own speciﬁcations\
    \ depending on\nthe bandwidth, number of free channels, data rate, battery timing,\
    \ price and other factors [8]. The most\ncommonly-used protocols for wireless\
    \ communication in IoT-based applications in agriculture are:\nSensors 2019, 19,\
    \ 3796\n5 of 25\n2.1. Cellular\nCellular technology is most suitable for applications\
    \ that require an extraordinary data rate.\nIt can utilize GSM, 3G and 4G cellular\
    \ communication capabilities by providing reliable high-speed\nconnectivity to\
    \ the Internet, requiring higher power consumption.\nIt requires infrastructure\
    \ to\nbe deployed and operation cost and back up staff for it with a centralized\
    \ managed authority.\n4G cellular technology requires more battery power, but\
    \ cellular technology is a good option in\nunderground wireless sensor networks,\
    \ such as security systems in smart home projects and agriculture\napplications\
    \ [9]. A smart irrigation systems was presented in [10], in which several soil\
    \ moisture\nsensors were deployed in the ﬁeld in the ZigBee mesh network. The\
    \ reading captured from the ﬁelds\nwere transmitted over the cloud using the cellular\
    \ 4G LTE network.\n2.2. 6LoWPAN\n6LoWPAN is an IP-based communication protocol,\
    \ which was the ﬁrst protocol used for IoT\ncommunication. 6LoWPAN is also low\
    \ cost because of the low bandwidth and low power consumption.\n6LoWPAN supports\
    \ multiple topologies such as star and mesh topologies. To handle interoperability\n\
    between IPv6 and IEEE 802.15.4, there is an adaptation layer between the network\
    \ layer and the\nMAC layer [8]. The applications for 6LoWPAN are monitoring the\
    \ health equipment, environment\nmonitoring and in security and home automation\
    \ systems. In [11], a 6LoWPAN-enabled wireless sensor\nnetwork was presented to\
    \ monitor the soil properties of crops. The 6LoWPAN system architecture\nfor precision\
    \ agriculture application was discussed in [12] where the performance evaluation\
    \ of this\nprotocol was discussed with several baud rates and power constraints.\n\
    2.3. ZigBee\nZigBee is a wireless communication protocol widely used in precision\
    \ agriculture to monitor\nenvironmental conditions related to crops’ health [13].\
    \ It is based on the wireless 802.15.4 standard.\nBasically, it was developed\
    \ for personal area networks by the ZigBee alliance [8]. It has a ﬂexible\nnetwork\
    \ structure, long battery life, supports mesh, star and tree topology with multi-hop\
    \ data\ntransmission, is easily installed and supports large nodes. It has a short\
    \ range with limited data speed\nand is less secure compared to Wi-Fi-based systems.\
    \ ZigBee is very common in smart agriculture\napplications such as smart green\
    \ houses and smart irrigation systems [14]. In [15], a smart irrigation\nsystem\
    \ was presented based on the ZigBee communication protocol. This system consisted\
    \ of two\nnodes, i.e., a sensor node and an actuator node. The sensor node was\
    \ comprised of soil moisture\nsensors, which monitored the water level in the\
    \ soil. The actuator module was responsible for taking\nactions according to the\
    \ water level of the soil. All communication was carried out by means of\nZigBee\
    \ protocol.\n2.4. BLE\nBLE is as famous as the Bluetooth smart technology, which\
    \ is a suitable protocol for IoT\napplications including agriculture [16]. It\
    \ is particularly designed for low bandwidth, low latency and\nshort range for\
    \ IoT applications. The main advantages of BLE over typical Bluetooth include\
    \ lower\nsetup time, lower power consumption and unlimited support for nodes in\
    \ a star topology. It has a\nvery limited range of 10 meters. However, the drawbacks\
    \ are that it can only provide communication\nbetween two devices, it presents\
    \ low security, and it can lose connection during communication. In [17],\na BLE-based\
    \ infrastructure was presented to collect the sensors’ data. The proposed system\
    \ utilized a\nsmart phone to collect the data of sensors using BLE, where sensors\
    \ were deployed in the plants, i.e.,\nsoil moisture sensors and soil temperature\
    \ sensor.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n6 of 25\n2.5. RFID\nRFID systems consist of\
    \ a reader and a transponder, which have a very small radio frequency,\ncalled\
    \ the RF tag. This tag is programmed electronically with distinctive information\
    \ that has a reading\ncharacteristic. RFID has two technologies for the tag system\
    \ the ﬁrst is the active reader tag system,\nand the other is the passive reader\
    \ tag. Active reader tag systems are more expensive, as they utilize\nmore battery\
    \ power and use high frequencies. However, passive reader tag systems are low\
    \ powered.\nSome IoT applications using RFID include smart shopping, healthcare,\
    \ national security and smart\nagriculture applications. An IoT-based smart irrigation\
    \ system based on RFID was presented in [18].\nThe system was comprised of soil\
    \ moisture and soil temperature sensors along with a water control\nsystem, so\
    \ it collected the reading of the sensors and sent these readings to the cloud\
    \ using RFID\ncommunication protocols, where the user controlled a water pump\
    \ based on the water level of the soil.\n2.6. Wi-Fi\nWi-Fi is the most common\
    \ communication protocol that enables devices to communicate over\na wireless\
    \ signal. Wi-Fi provides Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) connectivity to millions\
    \ of\nlocations, i.e., homes, ofﬁces and public locations such as cafes, hotels\
    \ and airports with high speed.\nThe Wi-Fi protocol supports IEEE 802.11, 802.11a,\
    \ 802.11b, 802.11g and 802.11n. Wi-Fi is widely used\nin IoT-based applications\
    \ including agriculture systems, i.e., smart irrigation, crop health monitoring\n\
    and greenhouses. In [19], an infrastructure was presented to monitor environmental\
    \ parameters\ninside the greenhouse such as temperature, light intensity and soil\
    \ moisture level. This platform\nwas comprised of sensors that collected the data\
    \ related to the environmental variation and sent to\nthe cloud using Wi-Fi. Similarly,\
    \ another smart agriculture system based on Wi-Fi communication\nprotocols was\
    \ presented in [20]. This last one consisted of a Raspberry Pi connected with\
    \ multiple\nsensors, which collected the data. The collected data were further\
    \ transmitted to the cloud using Wi-Fi\ncommunication protocols.\n2.7. LoRaWAN\n\
    LoRaWAN operates on the LoRa network. LoRaWAN deﬁnes the system architecture and\n\
    communication protocol of the network, while the physical layer of LoRa enables\
    \ the link for\nlong-range communication. LoRaWAN manages the frequencies in communication,\
    \ data rate and\npower consumption for all devices. LoRaWAN is common in agricultural\
    \ applications because of\nits large coverage area and low power consumption [21].\
    \ In [14], a smart irrigation system based on\nLoRaWAN was presented. Table 3\
    \ shows the comparison of all mentioned wireless communication\nprotocols [8].\
    \ Among all wireless communication technologies, 6LoWPAN and ZigBee are considered\n\
    to be more suitable for PA application because both are based on mesh networking,\
    \ which makes them\nsuitable to cover large area.\nTable 3. Wireless communication\

    \ Image-Based Remote Sensing\nRemote sensing has been widely used in PA to monitor\
    \ crops’ health for the last two decades.\nRemote sensing is a phenomenon in which\
    \ physical conditions of the Earth are observed remotely by\ncalculating the emitted\
    \ and reﬂected radiation from some distance. There are special cameras that\n\
    are used to capture images for further analysis to ﬁnd the characteristics of\
    \ a speciﬁc area. Multiple\nplatforms are used to mount these cameras that capture\
    \ images of the objects.\n3.1. Spectral Image Platforms\nRemote sensing platform\
    \ considerations for spectral images are airborne-based, satellite-based\nand\
    \ Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based [22]. Each platform has its own coverage\
    \ range, which\nis determined by three factors: (i) Ground Sampling Distance (GSD),\
    \ which is computed in terms of\nspatial resolution, (ii) data collection rate\
    \ or frequency and (iii) average distance between the object\nand sensor. Apart\
    \ from coverage range, several factors [23] affect the performance of platforms,\n\
    as mentioned in Table 4.\nTable 4. Key differences between spectral image platforms.\n\

    \ are considered to be the most stable platforms among\nall others. These platforms\
    \ consist of satellites, rockets and space shuttles. Space borne platforms are\n\
    categorized based on the orbits and timing. The advantages of satellite-based\
    \ remote sensing include\nhigh spatial resolution, which makes it promising to\
    \ extract extensive time-series data. The images\nobtained by satellite platforms\
    \ cover large area and are stable without noise, which is normally induced\ndue\
    \ to interference while image capturing. However, the main problem with satellite-based\
    \ platforms\nis their high cost in the case of high spatial resolution images.\
    \ The second problem is their strictly ﬁxed\ntime schedule, so data cannot be\
    \ collected at critical timings. The re-visitation times vary from twice\nin one\
    \ day to 16 days, depending on the orbit of the satellite. The other big problem\
    \ is that satellite\nplatforms are highly sensitive to weather conditions, so\
    \ if the weather is cloudy, the captured image will\nhave less detailed information.\
    \ Table 5 shows the main types of satellites with their speciﬁcations [22].\n\
    Among all satellite platforms presented in Table 5, some satellite data are freely\
    \ available,\nwhile others provide a commercial solution. The commercial solutions\
    \ such as Pleiades-1 provide\nimages with a high resolution and a revisit time\
    \ of one day. QuickBird, Landsat-8 and Sentinel are\nfrequently-used satellite\
    \ platforms used to obtain hyperspectral imagery. QuickBird was launched\nin 2001\
    \ by USA. The Panchromatic (PAN) and four Multi-Spectral (MS) imagery sensors\
    \ are used in\nQuickBird with a GSD of 0.7 × 0.7–2.6 × 2.6 m with a revisit time\
    \ 1–3.5 days. QuickBird provides a\nsmall revisit time, but it is a commercial\
    \ solution. In contrast to QuickBird, Landsat-8 and Sentinel\nprovide free solutions.\
    \ Landsat-8 was launched in 2013 by the USA. Landsat-8 provides a GSD of\n16 days\
    \ with PAN and 11-MS imagery sensors. Though revisit time of Landsat-8 is much\
    \ higher\ncompared to QuickBird, but it provides images with 11 different multi-spectral\
    \ bands.\nSentinel is another broadly-used satellite launched by the EU. It currently\
    \ has three missions,\ni.e., Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3. These missions\
    \ provide images with 21 MS bands with\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n8 of 25\nrevisit\
    \ times of 5–10 days depending on which Sentinel mission is used. However, Sentinel-2\
    \ is a\ncommonly-used platform in precision agriculture as it provides data freely\
    \ at a 10-m spatial resolution\nand covers a swath width of 290 km. By combining\
    \ Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B, the revisit time is\nfurther reduced to ﬁve days,\
    \ which helps in change detection. The complete details of all satellite\nplatforms\
    \ with their speciﬁcations are listed in Table 5, where other platforms such as\
    \ SAT, MODIS\nand WordView are also considered.\nTable 5. Satellite platforms\

    much smaller than satellite-based ones, but relatively greater than the UAV platforms.\

    \ a vibrant alternative to satellite and airborne, which are quite ﬂexible and\
    \ cost\neffective. A typical UAV platform consists of a communication and navigation\
    \ system that incorporates\na set of sensors mounted on it. Among UAV platforms,\
    \ there are mainly ﬁxed-wing platforms. and\nmultirotor options are available.\
    \ The ﬂying time is based on the payload weight. In general, a longer\nﬂying time\
    \ is achieved by ﬁxed-wing systems, which demands lighter weight payloads. For\
    \ example,\nhigh-deﬁnition cameras weighing less than 300 grams as the payload\
    \ of a ﬁxed-wing UAV allow it to ﬂy\nfor around two hours using currently available\
    \ battery power [24]. On the contrary, battery-powered\nmultirotor UAV with higher\
    \ payload capacity have a reduced ﬂying time, i.e., around 15–25 min.\nTable 7\
    \ shows UAV platforms commonly used in the agriculture domain and concretely to\
    \ monitor\nthe health of crops remotely [22]. Among these platforms, DJI/Phantom-2\
    \ is a more suitable choice\nfor intermediate agricultural land because of its\
    \ low cost and ease of use. The other advantage of this\nplatform is that it provides\
    \ support for mounting multiple cameras, which helps to monitor the crop in\n\
    multiple electro-magnetic bands. The American Aerospace/RS-16 is also an option\
    \ because of its ﬂight\ntime and large are coverage, but due to its high cost,\
    \ this platform is not common.\nIn [25], the ESAFLY A2500_WH helicopter was used\
    \ to implement the platform of the UAV\nwith Tetra cam ADC Micro as the camera\
    \ to capture hyper-spectral images of two different types of\ncultivation, i.e.,\
    \ vineyard and tomato. The images captured by the UAV platform are very high in\n\
    resolution, so more information can be extracted as compared to satellite images.\
    \ To assess the health\nof a crop, three types of Vegetation Index (VI) maps have\

    \ described above, a series of Vegetation\nIndices (VIs) can be computed. Vegetation\
    \ Indices (VIs) obtained from remote sensing-based canopies\nare effective algorithms\
    \ for quantitative and qualitative evaluations of vigour, vegetation cover and\n\
    growth dynamics, among other applications [26]. Hitherto, no uniﬁed mathematical\
    \ expression exists\nthat deﬁnes all VIs due to the complexity of the several\
    \ light spectra combinations, instrumentation,\nresolutions and platforms used.\
    \ In particular, this section focuses on vegetation indices NDVI, GDVI\nand SAVI,\
    \ as they are widely used in PA.\n3.2.1. NDVI\nThe Normalized Difference Vegetation\
    \ Index (NDVI) is the most popular VI that is extensively\nused to ﬁnd the content\
    \ of green in PA applications [27,28]. It uses Red (R) and Near Infrared (NIR)\n\
    channels to compute the NDVI index. More NIR light is absorbed by healthy vegetation;\
    \ however,\nabsorption ratio is very small for red light. NDVI is computed by\
    \ Equation (1) and returns a value\nbetween −1 and 1 [29].\nNDVI = NIR − R\nNIR\
    \ + R\n(1)\nHigher NDVI value indicate healthy vegetation, while smaller values\
    \ of NDVI show that vegetation is\nvery small at that speciﬁc region. There is\
    \ another form of NDVI, i.e., the Green Normalized Vegetation\nIndex (GNDVI),\
    \ which uses the green channel instead of red. GNDVI is computed by Equation (2):\n\
    GNDVI = NIR − G\nNIR + G\n(2)\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n11 of 25\n3.2.2. Difference\
    \ Vegetation Index\nThe DVI was proposed to reduce the effect of soil reﬂectance,\
    \ which is not covered by NDVI [30].\nDVI is different between the reﬂectance\
    \ of the NIR band to the reﬂectance of the red band. DVI is also\ncomputed with\
    \ the green band, i.e., GDVI. Both DVI and GDVI are computed by Equations (3)\
    \ and (4):\nDVI = NIR − R\n(3)\nGDVI = NIR − G\n(4)\n3.2.3. SAVI\nNDVI and DVI\
    \ do not compensate the background effect of soil. Therefore, many vegetation\n\
    indices were introduced to compensate the effect of soil reﬂectance. The Soil\
    \ Adjusted Vegetation Index\n(SAVI), the Green Soil Adjusted vegetation Index\
    \ (GSAVI), the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation\nIndex (OSAVI), the Green Optimized\
    \ Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OGSAVI) and the Modiﬁed\nSoil Adjusted Vegetation\
    \ Index (MSAVI) [31–33] are common among them, which are computed by\nEquations\
    \ (5)–(9):\nSAVI =\n1.5(NIR − R)\n(NIR + R + 0.5)\n(5)\nGSAVI = 1.5(NIR − G)\n\
    NIR + G + 0.5\n(6)\nOSAVI =\n(NIR − G)\nNIR + R + 0.16\n(7)\nGOSAVI =\n(NIR −\
    \ G)\nNIR + G + 0.16\n(8)\nMSAVI = 0.5[2(NIR + 1) −\nq\n(2NIR + 1)2 − 8(NIR −\
    \ R)]\n(9)\n3.2.4. NR and NG:\nNormalized Red (NR) and Normalized Green (NG) are\
    \ two other famous vegetation indices being\nused in PA [33]. NR focuses on the\
    \ part of spectrum where radiation is absorbed by chlorophyll, while\nNG focuses\
    \ on the part of the spectrum where radiation is absorbed by other pigments, excluding\n\
    chlorophyll. NR and NG are computed by Equations (10) and (11):\nNR =\nR\nNIR\
    \ + R + G\n(10)\nNG =\nG\nNIR + R + G\n(11)\n4. Wireless Sensor Network Applications\
    \ in Agriculture\nMultiple applications of wireless sensor networks are being\
    \ utilized today in the agriculture sector.\nSome very common applications are\
    \ smart irrigation, smart fertilization, smart pest control and green\nhouse monitoring.\n\
    4.1. Smart Irrigation Systems\nSmart irrigation is an artiﬁcial irrigation application\
    \ that controls the quantity of water by making\na decision about where water\
    \ is needed. It is the most signiﬁcant constituent in agriculture, which has\n\
    a great impact on crops’ health, cost and productivity. One major aspect of smart\
    \ irrigation is to avoid\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n12 of 25\nthe wastage of water\
    \ since most countries in the world are facing water scarcity problems. A smart\n\
    irrigation system was presented in [34] in which a Raspberry Pi was used along\
    \ with two sensors:\na soil moisture sensor was used to assess the water level\
    \ in the soil, while a temperature and humidity\nsensor was used to monitor the\
    \ environmental condition. The Raspberry Pi was connected to these\nsensors and\
    \ the water supply network. A mobile application was developed for remote monitoring\n\
    and remote water ﬂow control enabling both manual and automatic water ﬂow control.\
    \ In automatic\nmode, water ﬂow was automatically turned ON/OFF based on the water\
    \ level of the soil without\nhuman intervention. In manual mode, the user was\
    \ able to monitor the soil moisture level. An alert\nwas generated when the water\
    \ level of soil was getting below a speciﬁc threshold, and the user turned\nit\
    \ ON/OFF using a mobile application.\nPower is a big concern in IoT-based platforms,\
    \ so many researchers have developed power-\nefﬁcient systems. A power-efﬁcient\
    \ water irrigation system was presented using solar power [35]\nin which the controller\
    \ was connected to the soil sensor and water supply valve. The water valve\nwas\
    \ turned ON/OFF based on the water level monitored by the moisture sensor. The\
    \ power was\nsupplied by the solar panel, so the system was independent of any\
    \ external power module. Another\nsensor-based IoT system for water irrigation\
    \ was presented in [36] in which the controller controlled\nthe opening and closing\
    \ of a solenoid valve based on the water level of the soil. In addition, a series\
    \ of\nweather alerts were sent to the user via a mobile application to update\
    \ the temperature and humidity of\nthe environment, which had a direct inﬂuence\
    \ on the water level of the soil. In [37], an energy-efﬁcient\nirrigation system\
    \ for cultivated crops was presented using a wireless sensor network in which\
    \ water\nwas effectively controlled based on environmental conditions. This system\
    \ estimated the quantity of\nwater needed for normal irrigation based on the humidity,\
    \ temperature and wind speed collected by\nsensors along with historical data.\n\
    In [38], an IoT-based irrigation system was presented using soil moisture sensors\
    \ controlled by\nATMEGA 328P on an Arduino UNO board along with a GPRS module.\
    \ The data collected from the\nsensors were sent to the cloud, i.e., Things Speak,\
    \ where graphs were generated to visualize the data\ntrends. A web portal was\
    \ also designed where the farmer was able to check the status of water, if it\n\
    was ON/OFF. Similarly, a real-time prototype for an irrigation system was presented\
    \ in [39] in which\nsoil moisture sensors and soil temperature sensors were used\
    \ to assess the water status of the soil.\nRFID was used to transmit data to the\
    \ cloud for further data analysis. Using ATMEGA 328, a water\nsprinkler system\
    \ for smart irrigation was presented in [40] using temperature, humidity and soil\n\
    moisture sensors. The water sprinkler was controlled based on the soil moisture\
    \ level to save water\nand reduce human effort. In [41], a cost-effective drip\
    \ irrigation system for a home was proposed in\nwhich a Raspberry Pi, Arduino,\
    \ electronic water control valve and relay were used. ZigBee protocols\nwere used\
    \ for communication. The user turned ON/OFF the water valve by sending commands\
    \ to the\nRaspberry Pi, which further processed the commands through the Arduino.\n\
    The sensors placement is a big issue that affects the accuracy of sensors. A detailed\
    \ discussion of\nsoil moisture positioning in the ﬁeld and their accuracy was\
    \ presented in [42]. For real-time irrigation\nsystems, complete software and\
    \ hardware requirements, problems and challenges and advantages\nwere discussed\
    \ in [43] where a big picture of the complete system was provided.\n4.2. Smart\
    \ Fertilization System\nFertilizer is an artiﬁcial or natural substance having\
    \ some chemical elements used to enhance\nthe growth and productivity of plants.\
    \ Manual spraying is a common technique used for fertilization.\nHowever, the\
    \ optimal way of fertilization requires sensing capabilities to ﬁnd the exact\
    \ place where\nfertilizer is needed, which chemical components are missing and\
    \ the amount of fertilizer needed.\nIt is important to provide fertilizers in\
    \ a very precise amount in order to improve productivity [44].\nMultiple fertilization\
    \ techniques have been presented by researchers since the last decade using WSN\n\
    and IoT.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n13 of 25\nAn automated fertilization system\
    \ was presented in [45] using real-time sensors to measure the\nsoil fertility.\
    \ The system consisted of three modules including input, output and decision support.\n\
    The decision support module measured the optimal amount of fertilizers needed\
    \ for the growth of the\nplants based on the real-time sensory data captured by\
    \ the sensors. A mechanical sensor named the\n“Pendulum Meter” was introduced\
    \ in [46], which was used for optimal fertilization. This sensor was\nmounted\
    \ on the tractor to measure the density of the crop, so the corresponding fertilizer\
    \ spreader\nwas controlled based on the readings of this sensor. The IEEE 802.11\
    \ Wi-Fi module was used for\ncommunication along with GPS. Real-time data of soil\
    \ were collected by several sensors, i.e., soil\nmoisture, temperature, conductivity,\
    \ NO2, CO2, etc. A Geographical Information System (GIS) server\nwas used to interpolate\
    \ sensory data.\n4.3. Smart Pest Control and Early Disease Detection System\n\
    Pest attacks are the root cause of low productivity in the agriculture sector.\
    \ These pests result in\nseveral serious diseases in plants that affect the plant’s\
    \ growth. However, disease prediction provides\nearly warning to the farmers,\
    \ which enables them to make appropriate decisions to control the disease\non\
    \ time. Pest control systems are comprised of electronic devices that enable humans\
    \ to identify traps\nin a speciﬁc range of these electronic devices [47]. These\
    \ electronic devices are sensors capable of\ncalculating the environmental parameters\
    \ for further analysis.\nMuch research has been done in the agriculture sector\
    \ for early disease detection and pest control\nsystems using more advanced and\
    \ sophisticated technologies [48,49]. Multiple imagery sensors have\nbeen used\
    \ by different researchers to collect imagery data, such as: RGB sensors, ﬂuorescence\
    \ imagery\nsensors, spectral sensors and thermal sensors [50]. The thermal sensors\
    \ are used to measure the water\nstatus in the plant by measuring the temperature,\
    \ since this parameter has a direct inﬂuence on the\nwater level in the plants.\
    \ RGB images have three colour channels, i.e., red, green and blue, which\ncan\
    \ be used to perceive the biometric effect in the plants. Multi- and hyper-spectral\
    \ sensors capture\nimages containing the spatial information of objects in multiple\
    \ wavebands. The spatial resolution is\ndependent on the distance between the\
    \ object and the sensor. That is why satellite images contain less\nspatial resolution\
    \ as compared to low altitude platforms such as drones. The ﬂuorescence sensors\
    \ are\nused to distinguish the photosynthetic activities in the plants. Various\
    \ image processing techniques\nare applied to these imagery data to identify the\
    \ diseases in plants.\nIn [50], an IoT-based plants disease and pest prediction\
    \ system was presented to minimize the\nexcessive use of fungicides and insecticides.\
    \ Weather condition monitoring sensors, i.e., temperature,\ndew, humidity and\
    \ wind speed, are used to monitor weather parameters to ﬁnd a correlation between\n\
    pest growth with weather. The sensors have been deployed in orchards, and data\
    \ collected from these\nsensors are sent to the cloud. The farmer is informed\
    \ about the alarming condition of the pest attack\non the crops.\nFrom a different\
    \ point of view, hyper-spectral images are used to analyse crops’ health and pest\n\
    attack using manned or unmanned vehicles on which spectral cameras are mounted.\
    \ The captured\nimages are analysed in depth using machine learning techniques\
    \ to identify the disease in the plants.\nAdvance Neural Networks (ANNs) are more\
    \ common for processing imagery data due to their ability\nto learn complex structures\
    \ and patterns. Using hyper-spectral images, a system was presented [51] to\n\
    identify disease or pest attack in crops. The proposed system for disease detection\
    \ used an ANN with\nmultiple layers.\nEarly disease detection in sugar beet plants\
    \ was presented in [52]. For early detection, four\nsupervised classiﬁcation algorithms\
    \ were applied on spectral images. Spectral images were then\ncollected for each\
    \ image, and multiple vegetation indices were calculated to be used in predictive\n\
    and perspective analysis. The vegetation indices used were NVDI, SR, SIPI, PSSRaand\
    \ PSSRb, ARI,\nREP, mCAIand RRE. These vegetation indices values were used as\
    \ features in the dataset. Support\nVector Machine (SVM), ANN, and decision tree\
    \ were used for classiﬁcation. A comparative analysis\nwas performed which, showed\
    \ that SVM outperformed other classiﬁers for disease detection with an\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 3796\n14 of 25\naccuracy of 97.12%. In [53], a data mining technique\
    \ was applied on the already collected dataset of\ntwo types of crops, i.e., wheat\
    \ and paddy (rice), in India. For dimension reduction, Sammon’s mapping\nwas used\
    \ for multi-dimension scaling, i.e., to reduce the dimension also for unsupervised\
    \ learning.\nFor high dimensional data, dimension reduction is required prior\
    \ to performing further data analysis\nfor better data visualization and accuracy,\
    \ since redundant dimensions reduce the effectiveness of\nany data analysis algorithms.\
    \ Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is a very often-used technique\nalong with\
    \ Sammon’s mapping. Data from multi-dimensions were reduced to two or three dimensions.\n\
    Then, the Self-Organized Maps (SOM) algorithm for clustering was used to ﬁnd correlations\
    \ between\nthe data. The accuracy comparison of SOM and Sammon’s mapping was presented,\
    \ which showed\nthat SOM performed better on a large dataset, while Sammon’s mapping\
    \ was suitable for small ones.\nSmart phones played important role in data acquisition,\
    \ which were further used to monitor the crops’\nhealth. In [54], the health of\
    \ wheat crop was monitored using near surface imagery captured by a smart\nphone.\
    \ The crop was classiﬁed as healthy or unhealthy based on the green level by computing\
    \ Gcc.\nMost of the applications in PA have been either IoT-based in which multiple\
    \ sensors are used to\nassess the health of the crop or remote sensing-based in\
    \ which crop health is assessed by performing\nsome computation on spectral images.\
    \ We can compare crop health monitoring application based\non some attributes\
    \ such as which sensors are used in particular applications, whether web or mobile\n\
    services are provided or not, etc. The comparative analysis of some existing crop\
    \ health monitoring\napplications is presented in Table 8 based on some attributes.\n\
    To precisely monitor the crop health, both IoT-based techniques and remote sensing\
    \ techniques\nshould be used together to provide more reliable and accurate information\
    \ about the crop. As a\nproof of concept, we present a case study in which a crop\
    \ health monitoring system based on IoT and\nremote sensing techniques is proposed.\
    \ We provide a complete end-to-end solution in the agriculture\ndomain by facilitating\
    \ the agricultural user with web and mobile services so that he/she could be\n\
    informed about the latest condition of the crop in a timely manner. In this way,\
    \ remedy actions could\nbe performed in time, which will result in enhanced production.\n\

    \ Precision Agriculture\nWe developed a complete solution for crop health monitoring\
    \ based on IoT and remote sensing.\nIn the proposed system, crop health is monitored\
    \ using data collected from multiple IoT sensors,\nas well as NDVI mapping of\
    \ spectral images captured by a drone. The architecture of the proposed\nsystem\
    \ is shown in Figure 1, which was designed according to two main modules. The\
    \ ﬁrst module\nwas a wireless sensor network-based system in which multiple wireless\
    \ nodes were developed. Each\nwireless node was comprised of a soil moisture sensor\
    \ used to monitor the water level of the soil,\na soil temperature sensor used\
    \ to check the temperature of the soil and air temperature and humidity\nsensors.\
    \ These nodes were deployed across the ﬁeld in a star topology fashion where the\
    \ master node\ncollected readings from all slave nodes and transmitted the captured\
    \ reading to the back-end server for\nfurther processing. The master node acted\
    \ as a gateway node, which received data from all slave nodes\nusing NRF communication\
    \ module. After performing initial processing, the master node transmitted\nthe\
    \ data to the cloud using GSM communication technology. In the case of the unavailability\
    \ of the\nGSM network, this node stored the captured data and transmitted to the\
    \ cloud upon the availability\nof network.\nThe second module was used to monitor\
    \ crop health using multi-spectral imagery, which was\ncollected by a multi-spectral\
    \ camera mounted on a drone. The NDVI was computed using Equation (1)\nto classify\
    \ between healthy and unhealthy plants by measuring the chlorophyll content in\
    \ the crops,\nwhich was further used to localize the area under stress precisely.\n\
    All collected data were sent to the cloud where further analysis was performed.\
    \ The web portal\nwas designed to help the farmer monitor the crop proﬁle over\
    \ the whole life cycle. Currently, we are\nmonitoring soil moisture, soil temperature,\
    \ air moisture and air temperature readings in real time\nalong with NDVI mapping\
    \ of spectral imagery. Multiple web services were provided on the web\nportal\
    \ including historical/real data visualization using graphs, weather monitoring,\
    \ NDVI mapping\nand the correlation among measured parameters. Figure 2 shows\
    \ the snapshots of the web portal\nalong with different services.\nFigure 1. System\
    \ architecture.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n17 of 25\nFigure 2. User interface of\
    \ the web portal.\nFor portability and remote monitoring, a mobile application\
    \ was also developed to facilitate the\nfarmer/agronomist/landlord with all the\
    \ web services that are available on web portal. The alerts\nare generated when\
    \ an abnormal behaviour is observed in the crop, which help the farmer to take\n\
    remedy actions in a timely manner. The user interfaces of the mobile application\
    \ are shown in Figure 3.\nTherefore, the web portal along with mobile applications\
    \ provides a complete solution, which enables\nagricultural users monitor the\
    \ current status of the crop, as well as previous details.\nFigure 3. User interface\

    \ Discussion\n6.1. Analysis of the Data Collected by IoT Nodes\nThe developed\
    \ IoT nodes were deployed across the wheat ﬁelds of an area of 1.4375 hectare.\n\
    The selected area was located in Islamabad, Pakistan. The wheat ﬁelds are shown\
    \ in Figure 4 along\nwith the IoT node and sensors. We deployed the system across\
    \ the wheat ﬁeld in March 2019 when\nwheat was in the grain ﬁlling and grain ripening\
    \ stage.\nFigure 4. System deployed across the wheat ﬁelds.\nWe collected the\
    \ sensors’ readings such as air temperature, air humidity, soil temperature and\n\
    soil moisture. We compared the observed crop parameters with the ideal wheat temperature\
    \ proﬁle\nas shown in Figure 5. Extreme variation in the weather of Islamabad\
    \ was observed in that particular\ntime period, which can be seen by how the actual\
    \ temperature for wheat crop deviated from the ideal\ntemperature proﬁle of the\
    \ wheat crop.\nFigure 5. Deviation of observed temperature from the ideal temperature\
    \ proﬁle.\nAdditionally, we performed linear regression to ﬁnd the correlation\
    \ between observed parameters,\nwhich provided insight into how changes in one\
    \ parameter can effect the other parameter. The linear\nregression found a relation\
    \ between the two parameters by ﬁtting the equation of the line using the\nobserved\
    \ dataset [69]. Equation (12) represents an equation of the line where mrepresents\
    \ the slope of\nline, while c indicates the y-intercept. The variables m and c\
    \ were learned from the data.\ny = mx + c\n(12)\nFigure 6A shows the correlation\
    \ between the observed air temperature and air humidity, which showed\nthat both\
    \ were negatively correlated. The correlation between air temperature and soil\
    \ temperature is\nshown in Figure 6B, which shows that both were positively correlated.\n\

    The rise in air temperature caused the air humidity to reduce, while it resulted\
    \ in an increase in\nsoil temperature and vice versa.\n6.2. Analysis of Multi-spectral\
    \ Images Captured by Drone\nTo collect multi-spectral imagery, we used the DJI-Phantom\
    \ Pro Advanced drone with the Sentera\nMulti-spectral-imaging sensor. The drone\
    \ had its own optical camera, while the multi-spectral camera\nwas mounted on\
    \ it to obtain spectral images. Multiple ﬂights of the drone were carried out\
    \ at the\nspeciﬁc growing stages of the crop, i.e., grain ripening and grain ﬁlling\
    \ stage. After collecting these\nimages, they were transferred to the cloud for\
    \ NDVI mapping. Figure 7A shows the optical image\nthat was captured on 16 May\
    \ 2019 when wheat was in the harvesting stage, while Figure 7B is its\nspectral\
    \ image, and Figure 7C is the NDVI mapping. Since wheat was at a mature stage,\
    \ its NDVI\nshould be very small, i.e., ideally there should be no green region\
    \ in the ﬁeld. However, in NDVI\nmapping, a large green region indicated the abnormal\
    \ behaviour of the crop. The green region was\ndue to naturally growing plants.\
    \ This information can be visualized on the web portal.\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nFigure\

    \ same process was performed in a maize ﬁeld when maize was in the grain ripening\
    \ stage.\nFigure 8A shows the optical image that was captured on 24 July 2019\
    \ when maize was in the grain\nripening stage, while Figure 8B is its spectral\
    \ image, and Figure 8C is the NDVI mapping. The same\nbehaviour can be observed\
    \ with the maize crop, i.e., there should be a minimal green region in the\nﬁeld.\
    \ However, in NDVI mapping, a large green region indicated the abnormal behaviour\
    \ of the crop.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n20 of 25\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nFigure 8. Maize\

    PA has been used since the last few decades to enhance crops’ yield with reduced\
    \ costs and\nhuman effort, although the adoption of these novel techniques by\
    \ farmers is still very limited owing to\nthe following reasons or challenges.\n\
    7.1. Hardware Cost\nPA relies mostly on hardware such as sensors, wireless nodes,\
    \ drones, spectral imaging sensors,\netc., which are used to assess multiple parameters\
    \ in real time. These sensors have multiple limitations\nincluding high development,\
    \ maintenance and deployment cost. Some systems in PA are cost effective\nand\
    \ are suitable for small arable land, i.e., smart irrigation systems that require\
    \ low-cost hardware\ncomponents and sensors. However, drone-based systems for\
    \ crops’ health monitoring are feasible for\nlarge arable land due to high installation\
    \ cost.\n7.2. Weather Variations\nEnvironmental variation is one of the major\
    \ challenges that affects the accuracy of data collected\nby sensors. Sensor nodes\
    \ deployed in the ﬁeld are sensitive to environmental variations, i.e., rain,\n\
    ﬂuctuation in temperature, wind speed, sun light, etc. Communication between wireless\
    \ nodes\nand the cloud can be interrupted due interference induced in wireless\
    \ communication channels by\natmospheric disturbance. The satellite, air borne\
    \ and drone platforms are also sensitive to weather\nvariations. Imagery acquired\
    \ by these platforms is affected by contamination of clouds and other\nnatural\
    \ aerosols. The development of advanced techniques for atmospheric correction,\
    \ cloud detection\nand noise interpolation is a current open challenge, which\
    \ requires hard efforts from the research\ncommunity.\n7.3. Data Management\n\
    The sensors in PA constantly generate data. To ensure the integrity of data, some\
    \ data security\nmeasures needs to be in place, which will in turn enhance the\
    \ cost of the system. The readings from\nthe sensors have to be accurate in order\
    \ to take appropriate actions precisely when and where required.\nAn intruder\
    \ can corrupt the readings, and false readings will adversely reduce the effectiveness\
    \ of\nthe system. PA systems generate immense amounts of data, which require enough\
    \ resources to\nperform data analysis. Real-time data collected from sensors deployed\
    \ across the ﬁelds after a few\nminutes and spectral imagery acquired from high-altitude\
    \ or low-altitude platforms produce the bulk\nof the data, which increase the\
    \ storage and processing requirements. New software platforms and\nfacilities\
    \ for scalable management of Big Data sources are demanded. In this regard, the\
    \ generation\nof software-as-a-service solutions is focused on merging data management\
    \ and IoT thorough cloud\ncomputing platforms.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n21 of\
    \ 25\n7.4. Literacy Rate\nLiteracy is an important factor that inﬂuences the adoption\
    \ ratio in PA. In developing countries\nwhere the illiteracy rate is high, farmers\
    \ grow crops based on their experience. They do not utilize the\nstate-of-the-art\
    \ technologies in agriculture, which results in loss of production. Farmers need\
    \ to be\neducated in order to understand the technology or they have to trust\
    \ a third party for technical support.\nTherefore, in underdeveloped areas where\
    \ the literacy rate is not high, PA is not very common due to\nthe limitations\
    \ of resources and education.\n7.5. Connectivity\nNext-generation 5G networks\
    \ can be 100-times faster than 4G ones, making communication\nbetween devices\
    \ and servers much quicker. 5G can also carry much more data than other networks,\n\
    which makes it an ideal technology for transmitting information from remote sensors\
    \ and drones, key\ntools that are being tested in PA environments. The adoption\
    \ of new communication networks based\non 5G is a must in current applications\
    \ where secure and rapid data transfer enables real-time data\nmanagement and\
    \ support for decision making.\n7.6. Interoperability\nOne of the biggest problems\
    \ PA faces is the interoperability of equipment due to different digital\nstandards.\
    \ This lack of interoperability is not only obstructing the adoption of new IoT\
    \ technologies\nand slowing down their growth, but it also inhibits the gain of\
    \ production efﬁciency through smart\nagriculture applications. New methods and\
    \ protocols to integrate different machine communication\nstandards to unlock\
    \ the potential of efﬁcient machine-to-machine communication and data sharing\n\
    between machines and management information systems are required in the current\
    \ scenario of PA.\n8. Conclusion and Future Directions\nPrecision agriculture\
    \ is a modern practice used to enhance crops’ productivity using latest\ntechnologies,\
    \ i.e., WSN, IoT, cloud computing, Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning\n\
    (ML). Most of the research done so far indicates that PA-based practices have\
    \ a great inﬂuence on\nsustainability and productivity. The objective of PA is\
    \ to provide decision support systems based\non multiple parameters of crops,\
    \ i.e., soil nutrients, water level of the soil, wind speed, intensity of\nsunlight,\
    \ temperature, humidity, chlorophyll content, etc. However, several challenges\
    \ are involved\nin the development and deployment phase of these systems. This\
    \ article was aimed at providing a\nsurvey of modern technologies involving current\
    \ PA platforms, with the goal of supporting industry\nand research communities\
    \ on the development of modern applications for smart agriculture. A case\nstudy\
    \ was presented to prove the effectiveness of the PA in the agriculture domain.\n\
    Since the main objective of precision agriculture is to produce surplus yield\
    \ by optimizing the\nresources such as water, pesticides, fertilizers, etc., for\
    \ resource optimization, prescription maps play\nan important role, which enables\
    \ farmers to quantify resources required for healthy crops at any\nparticular\
    \ growth stage. Most of the research accomplished in the agriculture domain focuses\
    \ on the\nremote sensing platforms to collect imagery, which reﬂects only Vegetation\
    \ Indices (VIs) such as NDVI.\nThe prescription maps cannot be generated by only\
    \ using VIs; instead, multiple other factors need to\nbe considered such as soil\
    \ properties, soil moisture level, meteorological behaviour, etc.\nFunding: This\

    A smart city is a city which functions in a sustainable and intelligent way, by\
    \ integrating all its \ninfrastructures and services into a cohesive whole and\
    \ using intelligent devices for monitoring and \ncontrol, to ensure sustainability\
    \ and efficiency [1]. In a world where population numbers are constantly \nrising,\
    \ significantly driving the consumption of resources causing resource shortages\
    \ and climate \nchange, the incentive for innovative solutions is evident. Urban\
    \ areas, in particular, are responsible for \nthe major part of resource consumption,\
    \ instigating an increasing need to create smarter infrastructures, \nin search\
    \ of greener and more energy efficient urban dynamics. Solutions to these issues\
    \ comprise of \nimprovements to a majority of components of urban dynamics, as\
    \ illustrated in Figure 1. \nFigure 1. Sensing in smart cities. \nThe Smart \n\
    City\nSmart \nInfrastructures\nSmart Electricity \nand Water \ndistribution\n\
    Smart \nTransportation\nSmart \nBuildings\nSmart \nSurveillance\nSmart Services\n\
    Smart \nHealthcare\n \nIt is predicted that the global economy will be significantly\
    \ disproportionate due the growth of \ncities, with forecasts that by 2050 more\
    \ than 6 billion people will live in urban areas [2]. This growth \nwill aggravate\
    \ further existing energy and climate related challenges. To solve these challenges,\
    \ cities \nwhich are more resource efficient and technology driven, are necessary.\
    \ \nSensing is at the heart of smart infrastructures, which can monitor themselves\
    \ and act on their own \nintelligently. Using sensors to monitor public infrastructures,\
    \ such as bridges, roads and buildings, \nprovides awareness that enables a more\
    \ efficient use of resources, based on the data collected by these \nsensors.\
    \ Real-time monitoring eliminates the need for regular scheduled inspections,\
    \ therefore \nreducing costs; measuring energy consumption in households allows\
    \ for accurate load forecasting; and \nsensors deployed in roads for traffic monitoring\
    \ collect data which is necessary for the implementation \nof intelligent transportation\
    \ systems (ITS). \nFor these approaches to be effective, sensors have to be deployed\
    \ in very large numbers and they \nhave to be interconnected, so that the collected\
    \ data can be sent to a central information system, where \nintelligent decisions\
    \ based on this data can be made. This poses a number of challenges. Firstly,\
    \ there \nneeds to be a communication infrastructure in place for these sensors\
    \ to communicate with each other. \nSecondly, what is the most efficient way to\
    \ aggregate and process this data? \nSensors 2013, 13 \n395 \n \n \nAspects related\
    \ to sensing in smart cities as well as efficient processing of data collected\
    \ by these \nsensors is discussed in the remainder of this paper. It is organized\
    \ as follows: Sections 2 and 3 review \nthe current state of sensing and enabling\
    \ technologies, respectively. In Section 4 existing sensing \nplatforms for smart\
    \ cities are discussed, and in Section 5 sensing applications in smart cities\
    \ are \ndiscussed. Some ongoing and future pilot projects for smart cities are\
    \ described in Section 6. \nChallenges and future directions are discussed in\
    \ Section 7, and the paper is concluded in Section 8. \n2. The Sensing Evolution\
    \ \nSensors are a crucial component of any intelligent control system. A process\
    \ is improved based on \nits environment and for a control system to be aware\
    \ of its environment, it is typically fitted with an \narray of sensors, from\
    \ which it collects the required data. It then uses the appropriate variables\
    \ to \ncharacterize its environment and adjusts its operations accordingly.  \n\
    The availability of a multitude of different sensors and continuously evolving\
    \ technology enable \napplications that were infeasible in the past due to high\
    \ costs and limited availability. Technology \nadvances not only drive the innovation\
    \ behind sensors, they also enable sufficient processing power for \nsmall-scale\
    \ devices to which these sensors can be interfaced to at a relatively low cost.\
    \ From the \nperspective of the requirements for smart cities, wide availability\
    \ of these technologies translates to a \nlarge number of opportunities in terms\
    \ of sensing. \nAs an example within the context of the smart city, meters to\
    \ determine gas, electricity and water \nconsumption have traditionally been mechanical.\
    \ However, smart metering implies a new generation \nof technologies [3]. As with\
    \ mechanical solutions, they must be robust, cheap, easy to maintain and \nreliable,\
    \ as their readings will be used to determine billing. Electricity meter readings\
    \ have evolved \nfrom the manual procedure of reading the mechanical meter, to\
    \ automatic meter reading (AMR) which \nwere deployed to reduce costs and improve\
    \ the accuracy of meter readings, eventually to an advanced \nmetering infrastructure\
    \ (AMI) which differs from the AMR in that it enables two-way communications \n\
    with the meter, driven by a growing understanding of the benefits of two-way interactions\
    \ between \nsystem operators, consumers and their loads and resources. \nA sensor\
    \ is a converter which converts parameters of a physical nature to an electronic\
    \ signal, \nwhich can be interpreted by humans or can be fed into an autonomous\
    \ system. These signals for \nconventional sensors, amongst others, include light,\
    \ pressure, temperature, humidity, moisture and a \nvariety of other parameters.\
    \  \nMore sophisticated sensors include accelerometers which can be used to measure\
    \ acceleration and \nvibration. In the context of structural health monitoring\
    \ (SHM), for instance, sensors like corrosion rate \nsensors (working on the principle\
    \ of an increase in electrical resistivity due to corrosion); acoustic \nemission\
    \ sensors (used to detect propagation of sound waves); and magneto-strictive sensors\
    \ (detects \nthe change in magnetic induction in the material caused by strain\
    \ or stress). An even later generation of \nsensors is based on semiconductor\
    \ physics and nano-technology, and intelligent sensing devices \ninclude, amongst\
    \ others, smart phones. \nCMOS based sensing, due to the relative low cost, enables\
    \ a range of smart sensors. In [4], a smart \ntemperature sensor with a one-point\
    \ calibration technique and MOSFET circuits is proposed. This \nsensor is primarily\
    \ aimed at low-power devices. Other CMOS-based sensor applications include \n\
    Sensors 2013, 13 \n396 \n \n \nmonitoring the quality of food products, by observing\
    \ the temperature and time of exposure, which are \nparameters related to the\
    \ quality of food products [5]. Within the context of the smart city, these \n\
    devices can also sense air and water quality, amongst others. \nIn particular,\
    \ stick-on or printed sensors can be attached to devices as labels to measure\
    \ various \nphysical parameters, such as humidity [6], temperature [7] and gas\
    \ [8]. Also, sensors have been \nproposed in plastic foil, e.g., chemical gas\
    \ sensors, implemented on a variety of substrates, coated with \na sensing film.\
    \ These enable sensing of multiple parameters from a single sensor. For instance,\
    \ on a \nsingle flexible foil, a multi-parameter sensor for temperature, humidity\
    \ and gas, using flexible \npolyimide foils, is proposed in [9], with the capability\
    \ of sensing propane and similar gases. A possible \napplication for these sensors,\
    \ as indicated in [9], is humidity monitoring, by embedding these sensors \ninto\
    \ construction materials, or environmental monitoring [10], an important capability\
    \ for smart cities. \nNano-technology, although mostly applicable for bio-sensing\
    \ applications, is a key enabling \ntechnology for sensor development, as advances\
    \ in nano-technology will undoubtedly drive \ndevelopment in MEMS and photonics,\
    \ inevitably leading to the development of highly sophisticated \nbut low-cost\
    \ sensors. This technology will enable applications where not only an individual’s\
    \ \nsurroundings can be sensed, but also the person’s health, at high granularity,\
    \ for instance, and linked to \nsocial networks. \nThe ever increasing number\
    \ of smartphones opens up a totally new sensing scenario. Smartphones \nare fitted\
    \ with a variety of sensors such as GPS, gyroscopes, accelerometers and compasses,\
    \ enabling a \nvariety of crowd sourcing applications, which will eventually be\
    \ augmented by the Internet of Things. \nIn particular, collaborative data collection\
    \ is a popular crowd sourcing application. Crowd sourcing \nwill be discussed\
    \ in Section 5.10. \n3. Enabling Technologies \nSome technical issues regarding\
    \ communication between sensor nodes still have to be resolved. In \nthe context\
    \ of the Internet of Things (IoT), the communication between sensors nodes has\
    \ to be \nwireless, as cabling costs for millions of sensors is impractical and\
    \ extremely expensive. Low power \ncommunication standards, suitable for an extremely\
    \ large number of devices and their heterogeneity, \nare necessary. In particular,\
    \ depending on location and necessary coverage, there are a number of \ndifferent\
    \ networks in smart cities. Depending on location and coverage, these can be classified\
    \ as [11]: \nHome Area Networks: these typically use short range standards, with\
    \ operating frequencies in \nthe ISM bands. Standards include ZigBee, Dash7 and\
    \ Wi-Fi (802.11 g/n), or wired standards \nsuch as Ethernet. All the monitoring\
    \ and control system’s components in a home are connected \nby the HAN. \nWide\
    \ Area Networks: these provide for communication between utilities and customers’\
    \ \npremises, which requires a much broader coverage than HANs, with infrastructure\
    \ such as \nleased lines based on optic fiber or broadband wireless, e.g., 3G\
    \ and LTE, and managed by \nservice providers. \nField Area Networks: typically\
    \ used in a smart grid to connect customers’ premises to substations. \nTable\

    \ ZigBee \nWith the advent of ubiquitous computing, one of the concepts of smart\
    \ cities is to have sensors \ndeployed virtually everywhere, in the millions,\
    \ such as in PlanIT Valley, where the aim is to have  \n100 million sensors. As\
    \ sensor nodes are typically designed to be low-power devices, the communication\
    \ \nstandard has to take that into account, as communication consumes the most\
    \ energy. \nLow power standards like IEEE 802.15.4 have limited range and a significant\
    \ number of repeaters \nwould have to be deployed in a city for full coverage.\
    \ Additionally, addressing schemes would have to \nsupport billions of devices.\
    \ 6LoWPAN defines mechanisms which allow transmission of IPv6 packets \nover IEEE\
    \ 802.15.4 based networks. Although this certainly presents itself as a solution\
    \ to the \naddressing issue, the coverage issue is tightly coupled to the communication\
    \ technology itself, which is \ninherently short range (in the order of hundred\
    \ meters). \n3.2. Dash7 \nDash7 is a promising standard for WSNs and is aimed\
    \ at long distance, low power sensing \napplications. Some of these applications\
    \ include building automation and logistics, to name a few. This \nprotocol stack\
    \ has a very small footprint; its communication range is in the order of kilometers;\
    \ and it \noperates at 433 MHz, a frequency which allows better penetration than\
    \ 2.4 GHz [12]. For home area \nnetworks (HANs), for instance, this frequency\
    \ is appealing, as it allows better penetration through \nwalls than 2.4 GHz.\
    \ For wide area networks (WANs), Dash7 is also appealing because of the long \n\
    ranges. Dash7 has received considerable attention for military applications, including\
    \ substantial \ninvestments. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there\
    \ is no significant active academically \ndriven research focused on Dash7. \n\
    3.3. 3G and LTE \nIn terms of existing wireless communication infrastructures,\
    \ 3G and LTE, have available \ninfrastructures worldwide, even in third world\
    \ countries. These technologies are meant for broadband \nconnectivity, and were\
    \ not designed for short range, low power operation. Although they have been \n\
    adopted by mobile devices such as smartphones, these devices operate on a rechargeable\
    \ battery, in \ncontrast to sensor nodes which are ideally deployed sparsely,\
    \ with no intention of charging or \nreplacing batteries. Furthermore, these services\
    \ are provided by service providers and the data cost is \nstill relatively expensive\
    \ compared to their fixed line counterparts such as ADSL. With millions of \n\
    sensors uploading gigabytes or even terabytes (in case of video) of data to the\
    \ cloud, these \ntechnologies are rendered infeasible for IoT. Furthermore, these\
    \ standards are not optimized for use in \nSensors 2013, 13 \n398 \n \n \nsensor\
    \ networks (i.e., low power). Hence, for these technologies to be adopted for\
    \ sensor networks, \npower consumption has to be considered. In the absence of\
    \ embedding these technologies into the \nsensor node (i.e., integrating LTE or\
    \ 3G into the sensor platform), gateways can be used between the \nsensor devices\
    \ and the web, as shown in [13]. LTE, in particular, has been a main enabler of\
    \ high \nperformance M2M applications, due to coverage, high throughput and low\
    \ latency. \n3.4. RFID and NFC \nWith regards to short range communication, there\
    \ are two prominent technologies in the context of \nsmart cities. Radio Frequency\
    \ Identification (RFID) consists of an RFID tag (which can be either \npassive\
    \ or active), where data is stored, and an RFID reader, which induces an electromagnetic\
    \ field \nwhen in near proximity to passive tags and by this means provides power\
    \ to the devices (longer ranges \nfor active tags), enabling it to read data from\
    \ the tag’s memory. RFID enables a range of applications \nfor smart cities, such\
    \ as localization and tracking of objects [14], healthcare applications [15],\
    \ asset \nmanagement [16] and smart parking [17], to name a few. As the circuitry\
    \ in tags is printed, it is natural \nto integrate these tags with smart label\
    \ sensors, therefore creating RFID tags which do not only \ncontain data which\
    \ has been manually written, but they also capture environmental data as described\
    \  \nin [9]. Hence, each tag can also act as a sensor. Additionally, because passive\
    \ tags are inexpensive, \nthese can be deployed in very large numbers for pervasive\
    \ sensing. Furthermore, the passive nature of \nthese tags translates to low cost\
    \ and low power consumption, as these tags only need to be powered \nwhen needed.\
    \ \nNear Field Communication (NFC) is used in mobile and similar devices, for\
    \ a very short  \nbi-directional communication range (in contrast with RFID which\
    \ is unidirectional). These ranges are \nusually in the centimeter range. The\
    \ recent integration of NFC into smartphones has enabled a range of \napplications\
    \ which facilitate day-to-day activities and enable smart living. A selection\
    \ of general \napplications which have emerged with NFC is given: \nThe most predominant\
    \ application of NFC is the digital wallet. This allows customers to use their\
    \ \nsmartphones as a substitute for their cards, which can be for public transportation,\
    \ bank, access control \nor identification [18]. \nSince NFC is bidirectional,\
    \ it is possible to use it to share data between devices, multimedia as well \n\
    as documents, such as business cards or similar contact information [19]. \nOccupancy\
    \ and user context in smart homes are accomplished by placing NFC tags at strategic\
    \ \nlocations in a house and have these tags interface with the central information\
    \ system It is possible to \ndetermine whether a user has entered a room and to\
    \ change the settings according to the location  \n(e.g., switch on Wi-Fi if the\
    \ user enters the house) [17]. \nThe following are real-world examples of NFC\
    \ application within the context of the smart city: \nSmart energy metering: NFC-enabled\
    \ post-pay electricity meters were deployed in the city of \nChongqing, China,\
    \ which enable consumers to read their smart meters with an NFC phone. \nPayment\
    \ for the electricity is automatically done after the encrypted reading has been\
    \ send \nover-the-air to the service’s banking back-end [20]. \nSensors 2013,\
    \ 13 \n399 \n \n \nData acquisition and control: NFC enabled smartphones can be\
    \ used to interface with control \nsystems for remote control [21] and can be\
    \ used as platforms for advanced measurement and \nprocessing [22]. \nCity touristic\
    \ surfing: with an NFC enabled smart phone and smart posters disseminated \nalong\
    \ the city, the user can navigate through points of interest within the city [23].\
    \ \nSmart car parks: motorists can use their NFC enabled smart phone as an electronic\
    \ ticket to \nenter the parking lot and when leaving as an electronic wallet to\
    \ affect payment [24]. \nWith the addition of NFC to smartphones and the widespread\
    \ of smartphones, NFC is envisaged as \na key enabling technology in smart cities.\
    \ \n4. Sensing Platforms \nWith the advent of ubiquitous sensing, various devices\
    \ and platforms are currently available  \nfor this purpose. Although ideas to\
    \ implement these platforms have been around for decades, only \nrecently have\
    \ these systems been feasible from a cost perspective, driven by reduced manufacturing\
    \ \ncosts as well as low-cost electronic components such as radio transceivers,\
    \ microcontrollers, \nmicroprocessors and sensors. Sourcing these components in\
    \ bulk becomes increasingly less expensive \nas technology progresses. \nSensor\
    \ nodes can be interfaced to a number of sensors. The most common include humidity,\
    \ light \nand temperatures sensors. These platforms are built in such a way that\
    \ the sensed data is collected by \nthe sensors, sometimes pre-processed, and\
    \ then transmitted to a sink node via other sensor nodes; \nhence they are usually\
    \ set up in a network, also known as a wireless sensor network (WSN). \nAdditionally,\
    \ these systems will be deployed outdoors and thus have to cope with the harsh\
    \ \nenvironmental conditions. In this context, properties from industrial control\
    \ networks can be applied in \nthese sensor networks for added robustness and\
    \ reliability [25]. \n4.1. Wireless Sensor Networks \nWireless sensor networks\
    \ consist of wireless sensor nodes, which are devices equipped with a \nprocessor,\
    \ a radio interface, an analog-to-digital converter, multiple sensors, memory\
    \ and a power \nsupply. The general architecture of a wireless sensor node is\
    \ illustrated in Figure 2. \nA range of open source sensor nodes are available\
    \ to the research community. Some of the most \nwidely used sensor nodes recently\
    \ in research are Mica, Mica2, IMote, Telos, TelosB, Stargate and \nIMote 2. Table\
    \ 2 contains details on available sensor motes used in research and commercial\
    \ \napplications. The utopia of WSNs is an extremely tiny low-power, low-cost\
    \ sensor node which can be \ndeployed in any environment, with sufficient battery\
    \ power to last for a few years, with the capability \nto continuously sense its\
    \ surroundings. In reality, even with recent advances in microelectronics, these\
    \ \nhave still not been realized. The only project to come close to this idea\
    \ was Smart Dust, which was \nactive up to the early 2000s [26]. \nSensors 2013,\

    \ are characterized by severe resource constraints, one of which is the \nreliance\
    \ on battery life. With the deployment of sensor nodes in very large numbers in\
    \ smart cities, it is \ninfeasible to replace or recharge batteries in these devices.\
    \ Creating energy efficient solutions from \nprotocol design to sophisticated\
    \ power management schemes are efficient and necessary methods, but \nnot sufficient.\
    \ A popular way of supplementing power includes solar panels, but sunlight is\
    \ not always \navailable and it is not the most cost effective solution. The harvesting\
    \ of energy from alternative \nsources in the environment is actively being researched\
    \ and developed. Examples of these energy \nsources include thermal, light (solar),\
    \ wind, mechanical (vibration) and many others. However, \nefficient ways of capturing\
    \ this energy are vital, as the energy from these sources is usually available\
    \ \nin extremely small quantities. \nHence, ways to scavenge energy from the environment\
    \ to prolong the nodes’ lifetimes and improve \nmarket adoption are essential.\
    \ Sources are typically from light, heat and sources of kinetic energy such \n\
    as vibrations, etc. Of course, this technology can also be applied to drive any\
    \ other low-energy device.  \nMethods of energy harvesting, in the context of\
    \ smart cities include: \nWind energy: small scale turbine rotation is converted\
    \ to electrical energy. Such turbines can \nbe located in open places where wind\
    \ is easily accessible. For instance, nodes used for \nstructural health monitoring,\
    \ deployed in bridges and similar structures, can readily use this \nSensors 2013,\
    \ 13 \n401 \n \n \nkind of harvesting. Other methods involve the use of piezo-electric\
    \ materials [27] or vibrating \nmembranes [28]. \nRF energy: an antenna receives\
    \ RF signals and an RF-DC converter module converts the RF \nsignals to DC voltages.\
    \ With multiple antennae emitting signals, this type of harvesting is \nworth\
    \ exploring [29]. \nElectric field: electric and magnetic fields around power\
    \ lines, for instance, can be exploited \nfor energy scavenging, as shown in [30,31].\
    \ Sensors deployed in the near proximity of these \noverhead lines can exploit\
    \ these electric or magnetic fields. \nVibrations and movement: kinetic energy,\
    \ from vibrations for instance, can be harvested in \nmany different locations.\
    \ For instance, at utility’s facilities, nodes deployed for condition \nmonitoring\
    \ can exploit vibrations for energy scavenging, as shown in [32]. Vibration is\
    \ probably \nthe most efficient energy sources for scavenging, as well as HVAC\
    \ ducts in office buildings. \nLight and Thermal Sources: these are common both\
    \ indoors and outdoors. In houses for \ninstance, these can be ambient artificial\
    \ light or heat from appliances [33]. \nPiezo-electric harvesters in bridges and\
    \ highways: to meet the demands in power requirements \nfor sensor nodes for SHM,\
    \ the structure’s vibration, in case of bridges or highways, is a good \nenergy\
    \ scavenging source [34]. \nAlthough there is a lot of research and development\
    \ ongoing in this domain, these techniques are \nstill not completely mature for\
    \ powering of low-power devices, and even when they are used, it should \nbe for\
    \ ultra low duty cycles only, to preserve as much energy as possible. Amongst\
    \ these scavenging \ntechniques, harnessing energy from vibration is probably\
    \ the most efficient approach. \n4.2. Internet of Things Systems \nSensor nodes\
    \ described in the previous section, typically send their data to a sink node,\
    \ which in \nturn sends it to some sort of processing centre. These two components\
    \ (sensing and processing) are not \nexplicitly unified, from a WSN perspective.\
    \ Some unified solutions include:  \nThingspeak [35]: Thingspeak is a platform\
    \ which enables users to upload information from \ntheir sensor nodes to the Cloud.\
    \ Users create an account on the platform, register their devices, \nand get access\
    \ to their sensor data as desired. The system allows querying by location, allowing\
    \ \nthe user to have access to data from various locations in the world. \niOBridge\
    \ [36]: in contrast to Thingspeak and Cosm, where libraries for different sensing\
    \ \nplatforms are available, iOBridge develops its own hardware modules that are\
    \ connected to the \nCloud, which in turn can be accessed through web interfaces,\
    \ for remote monitoring and API’s \nallow integration of the collected information\
    \ into other web services or third-party \napplications, for example mobile applications\
    \ for controlling these ioBridge devices remotely \nfrom smartphones such as Android\
    \ and iPhone. \nIn contrast to the systems described above, there are also proprietary\
    \ solutions. These include \nHPCense [37] and Smarter Planet [38]. HPCense’s ultimate\
    \ goal is to deploy more than a trillion \nsensors around the planet to collect\
    \ a range of information such as seismic activity. Smarter Planet is \nan IBM\
    \ initiative which encourages companies to adhere to their solutions to improve\
    \ the efficiency of \nSensors 2013, 13 \n402 \n \n \ntheir current systems. These\
    \ include building management solutions and IT infrastructures for scalable \n\
    data storage. \n4.3. Cloud of Things \nThe Cloud is a vital component of smart\
    \ cities. As sensors collect terabytes of information, this data \nneeds to be\
    \ aggregated and processed. With the recent technological advances in mobile computing,\
    \ in \nthe form of smartphones, the Cloud has become a critical element for data\
    \ storage and processing. In \nsimple terms, the Cloud is a collection of platforms\
    \ and infrastructures on which data is stored and \nprocessed, allowing users\
    \ to retrieve and upload their data for a specific mobile application or \ncomputer\
    \ program, at any location with available Internet access. Hence, the Cloud is\
    \ a pool of \nresources accessible via the Internet. \nThe ability of outsourcing\
    \ processing power is particularly appealing, because resource intensive \napplications\
    \ can be dispatched to the Cloud instead. From the perspective of ubiquitous computing\
    \ and \nsensing, the Cloud is essential. \nFor smart cities, combining the Cloud\
    \ and sensors is crucial, so that the sensing data can be stored \nor processed.\
    \ In [39], a high-level architecture to interface sensors and the Cloud is described.\
    \ The \nexchange of data follows the Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) standard. \n\
    In the context of Cloud computing, all these platforms can be classified as either\
    \ infrastructure as a \nservice (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) or software\
    \ as a service (SaaS). Infrastructure as a service \n(IaaS) consists of providing\
    \ storage or processing capabilities through the use of virtual machines; \nplatform\
    \ as a service (PaaS) comprises a platform with execution environment and databases;\
    \ and \nsoftware as a service (SaaS) provides facilities for users to access their\
    \ applications or personal files on \nthe cloud. The integration of sensor devices\
    \ into the Internet requires IP compatible protocol stacks. \nThe Constrained\
    \ Application Protocol (CoAP) is an application layer protocol, specifically for\
    \ \nenergy constrained devices, described in [40]. The device in question (in\
    \ this context, a sensor node) \ncommunicates with a CoAP client, which in turn\
    \ communicates with a web server. CoAP and \n6LoWPAN allow sensor nodes to be\
    \ integrated into the web, through the use of proxies for HTTP to \nCoAP conversion.\
    \ In this context, if sensor nodes running CoAP are connected to the network,\
    \ sensing \ndata could be retrieved by a web browser through GET requests, in\
    \ the same way a HTTP agent is \nqueried. Figure 3 illustrates how CoAP and HTTP\
    \ co-exist. \nFigure 3. CoAP to HTTP conversion through a proxy in the Cloud.\
    \ \n \nSensors 2013, 13 \n403 \n \n \nEfforts are made to integrate these services\
    \ into each layer of the protocol stack, such as in \nSensinode [13], where these\
    \ are combined in the protocol stack. IoT standardizing efforts are also a \n\
    challenge as a large number of companies are involved with IoT development. \n\
    Other standardizing efforts include the Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) framework\
    \ [41], by the \nOpen Geospatial Consortium (OGC), with the goal of seamlessly\
    \ integrating sensor nodes independent \nof hardware platform, and defining structures\
    \ for describing measured data from sensors to a suite of \nweb services available\
    \ to the platform.  \nWhen using smartphones as ubiquitous sensing tools, standards\
    \ have to put in place for efficient \ndata exchange between devices. In [42]\
    \ a performance analysis on Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) \nprotocols for data exchange\
    \ between mobile devices for environmental monitoring applications is \npresented.\
    \ SWE protocols are based on XML, which introduce a considerable amount of overhead.\
    \ By \nanalyzing the execution speed of the XML parsing process, and comparing\
    \ to alternative formats, such \nas JSON, or EXI, with reductions in the file\
    \ size in the order of 40% to 90%, as well as faster parsing \ntimes, it was concluded\
    \ that EXI-C, even though it adds considerable overhead in processing times, \n\
    results in greatly reduced message lengths. Apart from the integration of sensor\
    \ devices onto the Web, \nanother issue is the large volume of data due the large\
    \ number of sensors. \nAn example of Cloud architecture to solve the high volume\
    \ data issue, named CLEVER, is \npresented in [43]. This architecture allows the\
    \ virtualization of different types of sensing structures so \nthat a common interface\
    \ can be used for multiple sensor networks. It provides services for sensing,\
    \ \nstorage and computation. From a cloud perspective, CLEVER is mainly an IaaS\
    \ solution. A module \nnamed C-SENSOR is responsible for managing the sensors’\
    \ physical resources and abstraction/ \nvirtualization. C-SENSOR is compliant\
    \ with SWE and it interacts with sensor data in an event-based \nor on-demand\
    \ fashion. A Host Manager directly interfaces with the sensor network and a Cluster\
    \ \nManager, which interacts with the system’s front-end and database. Each sensor\
    \ network is virtualized \nas a virtual pervasive element (VPE), which is an integral\
    \ part of the Host manager. \n5. Applications \n5.1. Water Distribution Systems\
    \ \nWater (along with electricity) is one of the most important resources in urban\
    \ areas. From supplying \nresidential customers to public infrastructures, such\
    \ as public parks, the distribution of water has to be \ndone efficiently and\
    \ has to be regulated. Furthermore, efficient quality control has to be performed\
    \ to \nensure that water is safe for human consumption. A typical water distribution\
    \ system consists of a \nwater collecting point (such as a river or lake), storage\
    \ facilities (such as reservoirs) and a distribution \nnetwork, which typically\
    \ consists of pipes (placed either above or underground and underwater) \nconnecting\
    \ water collecting points, storage facilities, to the customers’ premises. \n\
    These distribution systems are in essence non-intelligent. For instance, if there\
    \ is a leak in one of \nthe distribution pipes, it can be tricky to diagnose the\
    \ system early enough to detect the fault, \nespecially if it is not readily visible\
    \ (in case of underground pipes for instance). Advanced sensing \nenables a more\
    \ reliable fault detection system. Possible locations to deploy sensors and parameters\
    \ of \ninterest, from a monitoring perspective, in water distribution systems,\
    \ are shown in Figure 4. Examples \nSensors 2013, 13 \n404 \n \n \nof such applications\
    \ include monitoring the content level in reservoir tanks, leak detection and\
    \ \nmonitoring the water quality at specific points along the distribution system.\
    \ \nFigure 4. Applications of sensing in water distribution systems. \n \nFor\
    \ pipeline monitoring, the method shown in [44] consists of sensors deployed around\
    \ the pipeline \nfor continuous monitoring. Typically, three parameters used to\
    \ indicate faults in pipelines are \nvibration, pressure, sound (made by the liquid\
    \ as it leaks) and water flow [45]. By monitoring these \nparameters, a leakage\
    \ can be successfully detected. In [46], a WSN monitors hydraulic, flow and \n\
    acoustic data, as well as water quality, with nodes deployed at strategic locations\
    \ along the pipeline \nand also in sewers to determine content levels. \nFor pressure\
    \ sensing, this system uses a piezo-resistive sensor and for measuring water pH\
    \  \n(for quality monitoring purposes), a glass electrode is used. For water level\
    \ monitoring, an ultrasonic \nsensor was placed on top of the collector, and two\
    \ pressure transducers were placed at the bottom [45]. \nAdditionally, using dual-axis\
    \ accelerometers, vibration data is collected. These sensors are deployed \nalong\
    \ the pipes as shown in Figure 5. \nFigure 5. Vibration, pressure, and flow sensors\
    \ in a pipeline. These are used to monitor the \nintegrity of the pipeline, as\
    \ described above. \n \nSensors 2013, 13 \n405 \n \n \nThe collected data is then\
    \ analyzed to search for leaks. By analyzing the pressure data using Haar \nWavelet\
    \ transforms, pressure pulses along the pipe can be detected to determine whether\
    \ bursts \noccurred and their approximate location. High magnitude noise in the\
    \ acoustic signal is also an \nindication of a leak. Since sensors are typically\
    \ placed apart and by cross-correlating the data collected \nby neighbor nodes,\
    \ and considering time differences due to the sensors’ spatial positioning, the\
    \ \nlocation of a leak can be determined. As these analysis methods require considerable\
    \ processing \nresources, the data collected is analyzed remotely and not locally\
    \ on the sensor nodes. A device to \nmitigate effects from the leak can be activated\
    \ when an anomaly is detected. In the context of pipeline \nmonitoring, this could\
    \ consist of a device that would instruct an electro-mechanical device (i.e.,\
    \ \nactuator) to act in order to restrict the flow of water to sections of the\
    \ pipe which could have been \ncompromised by the leak. Other methods consist\
    \ of placing meters inside the pipe to determine liquid \nflow [47]. \nHence,\
    \ integrated sensing, processing and actuators results in an intelligent structure,\
    \ where the \nactuator’s decisions do not require human intervention. The data\
    \ is collected by the sensing agent, \nanalyzed, classified and an intelligent\
    \ decision is carried out by the actuator. \n5.2. Electricity Distribution Systems\
    \ \nConventional electricity distribution systems are in essence non-intelligent.\
    \ Typically, these energy \ndistribution infrastructures provide unidirectional\
    \ flows, from the generating station to the customers. \nThe amount of supplied\
    \ electricity is estimated or predicted, through previous available data, in order\
    \ \nto perform load shedding for instances where the demand exceeds the supply.\
    \ \nAn improvement to the conventional distribution scheme is a bi-directional\
    \ system, in the sense that \nelectricity flows from the utility to the client’s\
    \ premises and vice versa. A more efficient use of energy \nis then possible,\
    \ whereby electricity can flow back to the utility (to be stored for later use)\
    \ in cases of \nlow demand. These systems are collectively known as smart grids.\
    \ The concept of distributed \ngeneration enables a scenario where, instead of\
    \ having a centralized generation scheme, additional \nelectricity generation\
    \ points can be located closer to customers, therefore reducing the impact of\
    \ losses \non electricity transportation over long distances. Additionally, this\
    \ enables more innovative demand \nresponse programs to be put into action. \n\
    In contrast to conventional power grids, smart grids introduce many improvements.\
    \ Firstly, smart \ngrids have self-monitoring capabilities [48], where sensors\
    \ can be deployed anywhere along the \ndistribution network, in locations such\
    \ as substations or overhead transmission lines, for instance. \nSensor data can\
    \ then be used to report relevant events (in terms of performance and reliability)\
    \ back to \nappropriate entities. An important sensing application in smart grid,\
    \ amongst others, is the monitoring \nof overhead transmission lines. By monitoring\
    \ the lines, utilities ensure that power delivery occurs \nwithin safe limits.\
    \ For instance, systems like STAMP [49] sense the temperature, sag and tension\
    \ \nvalues of an overhead line in real time and determine the state, or health,\
    \ of the line from these \nmeasurements (illustrated in Figure 6). STAMP achieves\
    \ this using a distributed temperature system \n(DTS) and thermocouples for temperature\
    \ measurements, a laser range finder to detect sag and ground \nclearance, and\
    \ two load cells to monitor tension. These parameters have to be carefully monitored\
    \ to \nensure that the conductor is operating at its ampacity rating, which is\
    \ dependent on temperature. \nSensors 2013, 13 \n406 \n \n \nFigure 6. Location\
    \ of current sensors in a transmission line to monitor the line’s state. \n \n\
    Furthermore, parameters such as voltage, current and phase can be determined through\
    \ voltage and \ncurrent sensors, such as medium voltage (MV) sensors [50], placed\
    \ directly on the transmission lines, \nor non-intrusive sensors, which measure\
    \ magnetic field variations. An example of a stick-on, low-cost \nsensor for such\
    \ purposes is proposed in [51], which can be readily deployed in transformers\
    \ and \noverhead conductors. \n5.3. Smart Buildings and Homes \nIn an effort to\
    \ promote green living and sustainability, there are various initiatives to decrease\
    \ \nenergy consumption in buildings. In this context, methods to significantly\
    \ reduce energy consumption \nin buildings are various, from intelligent systems\
    \ to smart design. These are necessary because \nbuildings (especially with the\
    \ easy accessibility to inexpensive electrical appliances or other electronic\
    \ \ndevices such as computers, etc.) consume a very large portion of generated\
    \ electricity. In particular, \nheat, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC)\
    \ constitutes the largest contributors to increased \nconsumption. Hence, sensing\
    \ is crucial in buildings for appropriate actions to reduce consumption can \n\
    take place. For building automation systems, for instance, before an appropriate\
    \ action can take place \n(which could be dimming lights or switching of air conditioning)\
    \ the state of the environment has to be \nproperly assessed. At the heart of\
    \ household energy sensing are smart meters. Energy sensing \nmeasurements are\
    \ interfaced with a smart meter for accurate consumption reports. Sensing can\
    \ also aid \nin demand prediction. \n5.3.1. Approach to Energy Sensing \nAccurate\
    \ power usage measurement at the load side requires appropriate sensing. Additionally,\
    \ the \nexistence of a bi-directional grid enables the use of smart meters at\
    \ customer premises. Determining \nhow much power electrical appliances and electronic\
    \ devices are utilizing is crucial. To this end, \nsensors can be placed on these\
    \ electrical appliances for accurate measurements. \nThree different approaches\
    \ for energy sensing at the customer’s premises are: distributed direct \nsensing,\
    \ single point sensing and intermediate sensing [52]. With distributed sensing,\
    \ a sensor is placed \non each appliance, which means that although measurements\
    \ will be more accurate, it is an expensive \napproach due to installation and\
    \ maintenance costs. Single-point sensing, in contrast to distributed \nSensors\
    \ 2013, 13 \n407 \n \n \nsensing, measures voltage and current entering a household.\
    \ Although not as accurate as distributed \nsensing, it lowers costs significantly.\
    \ By monitoring raw current and voltage waveforms, and \nsubsequently performing\
    \ feature extraction on these measurements, a classification algorithm can be\
    \ \nused to determine which appliances are on or off, by comparing the measurements\
    \ to existing device \nsignatures. Intermediate sensing falls between direct and\
    \ single-point sensing. For intermediate \nsensing, smart breaker devices are\
    \ installed in a household’s circuit panel to provide a more detailed \nanalysis\
    \ of consumption. Other sensing approaches described in [52] are based on voltage\
    \ signatures, \nwhere voltage noise signatures or current signatures are used\
    \ to classify operation of electrical \nappliances, by observing the spectral\
    \ envelope of the harmonics and comparing these observations to \nexisting templates.\
    \  \n5.3.2. Correlation between Demand Prediction and Weather Conditions  \nThe\
    \ concept of Smart World as an interconnection of smart infrastructures is introduced\
    \ in [53]. \nThis concept includes sensing a range of parameters describing the\
    \ earth’s state, such as environmental \npressure, temperature, radiation and\
    \ similar parameters which can be exploited by the global \ncommunity to improve\
    \ the efficiency of services provided to the community. \nFor instance, accurate\
    \ demand prediction is necessary to avoid rolling blackouts or similar measures\
    \ \nwhen demand exceeds supply. With regard to demand prediction, the correlation\
    \ between weather \n(which is typically characterized by temperature, pressure,\
    \ humidity and wind speed and direction) and \ndemand, or human behavior, is of\
    \ particular interest. In [53], the effect of weather on electricity \nconsumption\
    \ is investigated. It is found that the highest correlation weather variables\
    \ with power \nconsumption are temperature, global solar radiation and humidity\
    \ [53], for different times of the day \nand seasons. The work in [53] specifically\
    \ focuses on smaller areas, such as micro-grids. This is \ncorrelated with the\
    \ usage of appliances, as heaters, geysers and air conditioners tend to comprise\
    \ a \nlarge percentage of a house’s electricity consumption, and the use of these\
    \ appliances is correlated \nwith seasons. By using environmental data and intelligent\
    \ agents to help predict load, it is possible to \nachieve greatly improved demand\
    \ prediction. \n5.3.3. Occupancy and User Context \nThe most basic action when\
    \ it comes to occupancy is to determine whether there are people in a \nroom or\
    \ not. Typically, this can be achieved through a combination of sensors, as shown\
    \ in [54]. These \nsensors include passive-infrared (PIR) sensors [54] or more\
    \ sophisticated camera based methods such \nas the methods shown on [55], where\
    \ people can be actively counted to determine occupancy numbers \nand locations.\
    \ PIR detectors are used in home alarm systems for motion detection (i.e., to\
    \ detect \nwhether there is a person in a room). Apart from occupancy, another\
    \ important feature is the user \ncontext, as highlighted in [56]. This can be\
    \ achieved by behavior activity classification using video \ncameras for instance,\
    \ as shown in [57]. The data from these sources enables an appropriate plan of\
    \ \naction with regards to the people in the room. For instance, lights in corridors,\
    \ elevators, and or other \nfacilities can be dimmed if there is no human activity,\
    \ hence reducing the overall energy consumption. \nSensors 2013, 13 \n408 \n \n\
    \ \n5.3.4. Indoor Monitoring \nOf interest are also the buildings’ ambient temperature\
    \ and ambient lighting. For instance, with \nlight emitting diodes (LEDs) lamps,\
    \ the intensity can be reduced in cases where ambient light, from \nopen windows\
    \ for instance, is sufficient. These windows are made of tintable material which\
    \ reacts to \nchanges in the environment [58], and can reflect or absorb light,\
    \ depending on an external electrical \nstimulus. This is a simple example of\
    \ how energy consumption can be reduced by smart design. \nIndoor temperature\
    \ can also be monitored so that parameters in the HVAC system can be adjusted\
    \ \nto meet specified temperatures, described by predefined set-points. For these\
    \ purposes, humidity and \ntemperature are deployed in strategic positions to\
    \ collect the required data for actuation. \nThe smart thermostat proposed in\
    \ [59] is an example of a combination of sensors and actuators in \nthe smart\
    \ building context. The thermostat is coupled with motion sensors to detect occupancy\
    \ and \nthen creates an optimal setback schedule based on this collected data\
    \ for autonomous operation. \nIn [60] a ZigBee based HVAC control system is described\
    \ for ensuring an adequate comfort level in \nbuildings, using machine learning\
    \ techniques. Sensor nodes are equipped with temperature and \nhumidity sensors,\
    \ from which data is collected at one-minute intervals and sent to a logging system.\
    \ \nThis data is clustered and matched to user feedback, where users can indicate\
    \ their current comfort \nlevel. In the control phase, the control system and\
    \ clusters classified as uncomfortable can be moved to \nthe closest comfortable\
    \ cluster. \nApart from monitoring and controlling HVAC systems, it is also necessary\
    \ to monitor electrical \nappliances, to detect any faults and to be able to assess\
    \ current operating status remotely, and having \nthe appliances wirelessly connected\
    \ to each other in a home area network (HAN). Furthermore, these \nsystems can\
    \ be connected to social networks to share notifications, enabling remote monitoring.\
    \ An \nexample of such a system is described in [61]. All appliances have a set\
    \ of sensors (to measure \nhumidity, temperature or pressure) mounted on them,\
    \ which are connected to a local sensor host \n(LSH), and are equipped with 802.3\
    \ u and 802.11 g interfaces, so that these nodes can be connected to \nan available\
    \ wired or wireless network, which is connected to the Internet. Each appliance\
    \ is fitted \nwith a specific set of sensor types. For instance, a refrigerator\
    \ can be fitted with pressure and acoustic \nsensors on each tray to determine\
    \ the quantity of food. Examples of notifications from appliances \ninclude warnings\
    \ from washing machines upon completion of a washing cycle. \n5.3.5. Smart Building\
    \ Evacuation \nAnother aspect of smart buildings is smart evacuation systems.\
    \ Conventional evacuation systems \nactivate an alarm when an alert for an emergency\
    \ situation is triggered. This model assumes that \npeople within the building\
    \ are aware of the routes to exit the building. A more efficient way to perform\
    \ \nbuilding evacuation is to count the number of people and direct them through\
    \ the quickest routes by \nconsidering congestion information, obtainable from\
    \ a variety of sensors, such as beam sensors or \nvideo cameras. Examples of such\
    \ WSNs are described in [62] and [63], using beam sensors and \ndetection of tags\
    \ worn by the people in the building, respectively. Although not as accurate,\
    \ these \nmethods are preferable to video camera based methods, from a processing\
    \ cost perspective. Instead of \nusing these systems stand-alone, they can be\
    \ interfaced to the building’s infrastructure, to obtain an \nSensors 2013, 13\
    \ \n409 \n \n \nestimate of the number of people through existing occupancy and\
    \ user context functionality, typically \nbased on motion sensors or video cameras,\
    \ if available. \n5.4. Monitoring Bridges and Seismic Activity \nAll public infrastructures\
    \ have to be monitored to assess their condition. Even if these \ninfrastructures\
    \ are monitored by personnel through scheduled visits, a visual inspection is\
    \ often not \nsufficient, as anomalies may still go undetected. A more efficient\
    \ approach to monitoring is to install a \nvariety of sensors across the structure\
    \ to continuously monitor its state and determine its health. \nThere are a variety\
    \ of parameters which characterize a structure’s state. In [64], the most common\
    \ \nparameters for monitoring of structures are listed as chemical (pH, oxidation,\
    \ and corrosion), \nmechanical (strain, stress and deformation) and physical (temperature\
    \ and humidity). A variety of \nsensors capable of measuring these parameters\
    \ can be deployed in large numbers across a structure for \naccurate monitoring,\
    \ but these can incur a significantly high cost. Recently, fiber optic sensing\
    \ (FOS) \nhas received substantial attention from the research community. \nRecent\
    \ approaches for SHM include using sophisticated fiber optic sensors [65]. In\
    \ bridges, for \ndamage detection, optic fiber sensors can be used for structure\
    \ monitoring. An optic fiber sensor works \nby detecting the change in the detected\
    \ signal from a transmitted signal, after it has passed through the \nstructure\
    \ of interest, and is able to measure strain, pressure and temperature, by interpreting\
    \ changes in \nwavelength. This typically requires the installation of fiber into\
    \ the structure to be monitored. These \ndistributed sensors work on the basis\
    \ of back-scattering. As light propagates through the fiber, some of \nit is scattered\
    \ back along the length of the fiber. Since the properties of the back-scattered\
    \ light depend \non the strain, deformation or temperature of the fiber, by using\
    \ this information one can determine the \nstate of the structure where the fiber\
    \ is installed. A fiber distributed sensor is equivalent to having a \nlarge number\
    \ of sensors deployed along a line with high resolution, since all points along\
    \ the fiber can \nbe considered sensing points, as described in [66]. Other approaches\
    \ to sensing for SHM use WSNs \nwith sensor nodes equipped with multiple accelerometers\
    \ to sense vibration along a 1,300 m long \nbridge [67]. The appeal of these systems\
    \ is the relatively low cost and ease of installation in \ncomparison to more\
    \ sophisticated sensing solutions. These sensors were deployed over the main span\
    \ \nand tower, and collected information of structural accelerations from wind\
    \ load. Additional approaches \ninclude the use of thermal responses and combination\
    \ of multiple sensors such as strain gauges,  \nstrain-gage displacement and force\
    \ sensors, as well as non-intrusive sensing methods using video \ncameras [68].\
    \ These computer vision based systems can be used for instance for structural\
    \ crack \ndetection [69]. \nAnother important application of sensor networks in\
    \ smart cities is monitoring the ground to detect \nany anomalies. These allow\
    \ early detection of earthquakes or landslides, which can be used for early \n\
    warnings in emergency situations. In [70] a wireless sensor network is suggested\
    \ to monitor sub-soil \nactivity. Sensor nodes are buried underground. In contrast\
    \ to other monitoring techniques, which rely \non sensors attached to the sensor\
    \ node, the technique proposed in [70] relies on how the propagation \nsignal\
    \ is affected by soil conditions. By considering changes in the received signal\
    \ strength (RSS), it is \npossible to infer events based on how each soil parameter\
    \ affects the signal. In particular, water \nintrusion, detection of relative\
    \ motion and relative density change can be detected using this technique. \n\
    Sensors 2013, 13 \n410 \n \n \n5.5. Environmental Monitoring \nTo ensure quality\
    \ of life, as well as safety, environmental monitoring is of utmost importance.\
    \ By \nmonitoring the quality of air, quality of water, and other parameters such\
    \ as humidity, temperature and \nambient carbon dioxide level, as well as other\
    \ harmful gases, it is possible to assess anomalies in the \nenvironment; therefore\
    \ ensuring pollution is kept to an acceptable level. In particular, reducing the\
    \ \nlevel of carbon emissions, which is a serious threat to our planet is one\
    \ of the main goals of smart \ncities. Environmental monitoring requires deploying\
    \ a variety of sensors outdoors, in locations such as \nparks and rivers, etc.\
    \ With the proliferation of smartphones, it is possible to use them for collaborative\
    \ \nenvironment monitoring. Furthermore, it is necessary to better understand\
    \ how human behavior is \ninfluenced by weather conditions, with regards to mobility\
    \ and other aspects. \nIn [71], the relationship between human behavior and weather\
    \ is studied, in an attempt to gain a \nbetter understanding of the dynamics of\
    \ an urban system. Data characterizing air quality and weather \nwas collected\
    \ from environmental monitoring stations and analyzed in conjunction with network\
    \ \nmobile traffic data generated during a period of 20 days. It was demonstrated\
    \ that by combining data \nfrom different ubiquitous sensing sources (environmental\
    \ data and mobile traffic data), it is possible to \nanalyze environmental and\
    \ social dynamics, which can be used to improve on a lot of aspects in the \n\
    context of smart cities, such as public transportation and other services. \n\
    5.6. Intelligent Transportation Systems \nWith the steep increase in car numbers\
    \ over recent years, there is an increasing need for efficient \ntraffic management,\
    \ to avoid traffic jams and optimize traffic flow, especially at intersections.\
    \ A \nconventional way to regulate traffic flow is through the use of traffic\
    \ lights. These typically have fixed \nswitch interval times (i.e., from red to\
    \ green and to yellow), which are not adjustable to traffic \nconditions. Traffic\
    \ jams have significant impacts on fuel consumption due to the frequent starts\
    \ and \nstops, as well as increased carbon emissions. An adaptive scheme, dependent\
    \ on traffic conditions, is \nmore attractive. In this context, a method to estimate\
    \ the number of cars approaching an intersection \ncould generate information\
    \ for switch interval times to be dynamically adjusted based on traffic \nconditions.\
    \ For such an intelligent system to be realized, efficient methods to detect traffic\
    \ (i.e., count \nthe number of cars) are required. Approaches where traffic lights\
    \ and stop signs are completely \nremoved have also been proposed, as described\
    \ in [72]. Such an approach is based on an intelligent \nintersection where vehicles,\
    \ which are wirelessly connected to each other, can communicate with each \nother\
    \ and use decision-making for collision avoidance. Using a time-slot for each\
    \ vehicle, crossing of \nintersections is coordinated amongst vehicles [73]. A\
    \ vehicle which misses its time-slot has to stop \nwhen it reaches the intersection\
    \ and wait for a new time-slot. The wireless communication can be \nperformed\
    \ through RFID, as proposed in [74]. In [74] a system to control a vehicle’s speed\
    \ \nautonomously based on the traffic signs is described. RFID was used for communication\
    \ between the \nvehicle and traffic signs, with RFID tags placed on traffic signs\
    \ and RFID readers placed on the side of \nthe doors of the car, and a Hall Effect\
    \ sensor placed on the vehicle’s wheels for speed control. \nInexpensive methods\
    \ of sensing cars involve induction loop detectors which are buried in roads.\
    \ \nLoops detectors can be used to detect the presence of metals. When a vehicle\
    \ approaches the loop, the \nSensors 2013, 13 \n411 \n \n \nloop’s resonant frequency\
    \ increases, and this change in frequency is interpreted as a vehicle. The \n\
    increase in frequency differs according to car size (or height), enabling an estimate\
    \ of the kind of car \nwhich has been sensed. This information can then be used\
    \ to estimate vehicle speed or other \nparameters, which can be useful for traffic\
    \ flow management. To estimate a vehicle’s weight, other \nmethods such as weight\
    \ in motion (WIM) can be used. A WIM system captures vehicle gross and axle \n\
    weights using sensor mats on road surfaces. Various types of WIM systems are discussed\
    \ in [75]: \npiezoelectric systems (which detect changes in voltage due to pressure);\
    \ capacitive mats (two inductive \nloops and one capacitive weight sensor); bending\
    \ plates (which record the strain on the plate due to the \ndynamic load of the\
    \ vehicle); load cells (which use a single load cell with two scales for each\
    \ side of \nthe vehicle’s axle); and optical WIM (where pressure on the optical\
    \ fiber creates a phase shift in \npolarization modes which is directly related\
    \ to the load on the fiber). All methods highlighted above \nusually carry significant\
    \ installation and maintenance costs. A WIM system is illustrated in Figure 7.\
    \ \nLess intrusive (but not as accurate) and more sophisticated methods involve\
    \ video cameras. These \napproaches are more attractive mainly because cameras\
    \ can be easily installed and the level of required \nmaintenance is low, compared\
    \ to previously described approaches. Furthermore, in instances where \nthere\
    \ are surveillance cameras installed, these can be used for intelligent transportation\
    \ applications. A \nwireless real-time traffic monitoring system is proposed in\
    \ [76]. The system consists of multiple \nstandard CCTV cameras and personal computers\
    \ (PCs), which process the captured data from the \ncameras. Each camera is controlled\
    \ by the PCs, and each PC implements all the necessary algorithms \nfor recognition\
    \ and tracking. \nThe system was tested in different environments, such as airports\
    \ and tunnels. One of the \ndrawbacks of computer vision-based methods is their\
    \ performance dependency on environment \nconditions, such as lighting and occlusions.\
    \ Dealing with occlusions or weather conditions is \nchallenging in computer vision,\
    \ so such scenarios have to be handled with care. For instance, in the \npresence\
    \ of fog or rain, vehicle detection or counting is more challenging. For night-time\
    \ scenarios, \nstreet lamps and vehicle lights also have to be considered [77].\
    \ In particular, street lamps, traffic lights \ncan be used for vehicle sensing,\
    \ as vehicles can be detected by considering the distance between \nvehicle’s\
    \ headlights. \nFigure 7. Weight in motion system. Weight information recorded\
    \ by the weight detectors \nis sent to the controller via wired connectors, such\
    \ as a fiber optic cable, for storage  \nand processing. \n \nSensors 2013, 13\
    \ \n412 \n \n \n5.7. Surveillance \nWith the availably of conventional CCTV systems\
    \ for surveillance purposes, an infrastructure for \nsmart surveillance systems\
    \ already exists. Security, especially in urban areas, is of paramount \nimportance.\
    \ Although these cameras are typically connected to a digital video recorder (DVR),\
    \ most \nonly record and do not have any built-in intelligent processing capabilities.\
    \ Furthermore, these systems \nare run by human operators who are prone to loss\
    \ of concentration. The benefits of using smart \nsurveillance are obvious. For\
    \ instance, by monitoring peoples’ actions, it is possible to determine \nwhether\
    \ violent actions are taking place, and even trying to identify and recognize\
    \ the people involved. \nIn this context, smart surveillance systems could alert\
    \ users by triggering alerts when events of \ninterest take place. Additionally,\
    \ monitoring people’s behavior can help in determining pedestrian \ntraffic patterns\
    \ which can be of help in the design of future pedestrian facilities or modification\
    \ of \ncurrent facilities. \nIn the instance of gatherings, it is important to\
    \ have crowd control schemes in place, especially in \ncases where there are large\
    \ numbers of people, such as in concerts, or other public areas such as \nairports.\
    \ This is especially relevant in emergency management systems or pedestrian crowd\
    \ \nmonitoring, especially at night-time. To track and detect pedestrians at night,\
    \ an infrared video can be \nused [78], as infrared cameras work on the basis\
    \ of temperature and not on reflected light, hence \ninfrared based computer vision\
    \ techniques are less susceptible to lighting. \nAnother important aspect of crowd\
    \ surveillance, especially in security applications, is to determine \nwhether\
    \ people are carrying any objects, such as suitcases, etc. This allows determining\
    \ whether a \nperson, for instance, is entering a restricted area while carrying\
    \ an object which they are not allowed \ncarrying in specific facilities. A framework\
    \ to detect objects carried by people from video sequences is \npresented in [79].\
    \ This method works by considering irregularities in a person’s silhouette. This\
    \ is \nperformed by comparing a template of an individual walking in the same\
    \ direction as the individual \nbeing observed, with any protrusions noticed considered\
    \ as possible pixels for carrying objects. \nAnother important aspect of crowd\
    \ control is determining violent behavior. Monitoring of fights, \nriots and similar\
    \ events is important for safety reasons. A crowd behavior classification algorithm\
    \ is \nproposed in [80]. \nA semantic video surveillance system able to autonomously\
    \ detect abnormal situations, able to run \non low resolution (320 × 240) cameras\
    \ is described in [81]. The system’s cameras run motion \ndetection algorithms\
    \ with are used to extract information from the video and format it in XML, \n\
    aggregating several frames, which are then used to perform route detection, which\
    \ consists of \nextracting information of objects which enter or exit the scene.\
    \ Finally, a semantic reasoning module is \nused to classify the semantic data\
    \ obtained from semantic translation to determine whether there are \nanomalies\
    \ such as cars driving on the sidewalks or similar situations which could indicate\
    \ abnormal \nsituations. This system can be used to detect pedestrians crossing\
    \ streets without using crosswalks or \nwalking on railways and vehicles going\
    \ in the wrong direction. Hence, this system can be deployed in \ndifferent scenarios\
    \ only changing its rules’ set to fit that specific environment. \nSensors 2013,\
    \ 13 \n413 \n \n \n5.8. Public Services—Law Enforcement and Fire Fighting \nThe\
    \ conventional law enforcement model is impractical and inefficient. Investigations\
    \ and other \nprocesses within law enforcement are aggravated by human incompetency\
    \ and lack of automation in \nprocesses. For law enforcement, IBM has solutions\
    \ within the Smarter Planet initiative, integrating \ninvestigations, geographic\
    \ information systems (GIS) and intelligence analysis [82], enabling \ninformation\
    \ sharing across agencies, resulting in a more efficient and more coordinated\
    \ law \nenforcement scheme. Another public service that can be improved by use\
    \ of technology is  \nfire-fighting. Fire fighters risk their lives in the line\
    \ of duty, due to the harsh conditions in which they \nhave to carry out their\
    \ work. \nConventional fire-fighting can also be improved, as shown in [83]. This\
    \ system consists of a TelosB \nbased wireless sensor network, where the nodes\
    \ are placed on firefighters’ bodies. Each TelosB mote \nis equipped with sensors\
    \ to measure temperature, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen and hydrocarbon \nconcentration.\
    \ Using RSSI based localization, firefighters are aware of their position relative\
    \ to other \nfighters within the network. This also enables computation of escape\
    \ paths, so that firefighters can exit \nthe work location safely. \n5.9. Health\
    \ Care \nOne of the most important applications of sensor networks is in healthcare.\
    \ To facilitate \nmanagement in hospitals or clinics, sensors can be used in these\
    \ environments for various applications. \nIn particular, wireless body area networks\
    \ (WBANs), is a very active research field. Body area \nnetworks consist of inter-connected\
    \ sensors placed in different parts of the human body. Hence, with \nsensors attached\
    \ to one’s body, either internally or externally, it is possible to monitor an\
    \ individual’s \nvital signs remotely. Examples of parameters which can be monitored\
    \ include electrocardiography \n(ECG), respiration, skin conductance and skin\
    \ temperature [84]. The advantage of WBANs is their \ncapability to upload this\
    \ data to remote logging systems so that the collected data can be viewed by a\
    \ \nmedical practitioner in real-time. Individuals with heart problems, for instance,\
    \ can be constantly \nmonitored and alerted if there are signs of an anomaly.\
    \ Activity monitoring and classification, which is \nuseful in health monitoring,\
    \ can also be performed by WBANs. But healthcare applications using \nsensing\
    \ technology are not limited to WBANs. \nOther examples of sensing applications\
    \ in healthcare involve emergency response [85]. In [85], a \nprotocol for emergency\
    \ reporting using cognitive wireless sensor networks is proposed. This protocol\
    \ \nis modeled after ants’ behavior and is used to coordinate cluster-heads actions\
    \ more efficiently, which \nresults in a decrease in reporting time delays. \n\
    A framework for long-term activity monitoring is proposed in [86]. The system\
    \ is able to recognize \nuser activity in real time and classifying activities,\
    \ using an array of sensors deployed in the home \nenvironment and attached to\
    \ doors, refrigerators and cupboards, as well as light sensors. From activity\
    \ \nclassification, it is possible to infer whether the person has a certain disease\
    \ or not. For instance, if \nfrequent sleep is detected, it is possibly due to\
    \ fatigue, which could indicate that an individual has \ndiabetes, for instance.\
    \ This framework can be used for disease prediction based on day-to-day activities.\
    \ \nSensors 2013, 13 \n414 \n \n \nA user-context recognition system is presented\
    \ in [87]. It uses Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to \nassess users’ stress levels.\
    \ Users insert their stress levels into a questionnaire through a smartphone \n\
    application. The entered data is matched to smartphone’s context data, such as\
    \ location and activity \ninformation, which is then used for HMM training. Stress\
    \ levels can then be classified after the \ntraining phase. \n5.10. Crowd Sourcing\
    \ \nCrowd sourcing consists of outsourcing tasks to a group of people, or crowd,\
    \ in an attempt to \ncollaboratively completing tasks quickly. The smart city\
    \ not only consists of smart infrastructure and \nsustainability: smart people\
    \ are also an integral part of the smart city. With the recent proliferation of\
    \ \nsocial platforms and mobile computing, crowd sourcing becomes a viable medium\
    \ for exchange of \nskills and services. Workflows, in crowd sourcing, consist\
    \ of tasks which have been unified. For crowd \nsourcing to be effectively carried\
    \ out, workflow processes have to be designed so that jobs can be \nbroken into\
    \ tasks and efficiently dispatched to human actors, and these workflow processes\
    \ have to be \nideally integrated into social platforms. To this end, various\
    \ tools have been developed. In [88], a \ncollaborative workflow tool for Amazon\
    \ Mechanical Turk is described. It allows requesters to view \ntasks’ current\
    \ status and reduces required planning by requesters. CrowdScape [89] attempts\
    \ to include \nuser behavior into the crowd sourcing process, in an attempt to\
    \ improve work efficiency. User \nbehavior whilst completing a task is considered\
    \ in conjunction with worker outputs, using machine \nlearning. Actions considered\
    \ to characterize user’s behavior include frequency of mouse click events, \n\
    key presses and scrolls. By correlating the user behavior with good work outputs,\
    \ it is possible to \nidentify traits of good workers, helping make crowd sourcing\
    \ task assignments more efficient. \nWith smartphones becoming increasingly more\
    \ powerful in terms of resources, crowd sourcing \nusing smartphones phones has\
    \ been thoroughly investigated. For instance, as users regularly update \ntheir\
    \ location status on social networks like Twitter and Facebook, based on this\
    \ location information, \nit is possible to aggregate this data, enabling tasks\
    \ to be dispatched to people in specific locations. \nFurthermore, by using sensor\
    \ data on a smartphone, it is possible to determine a person’s state (i.e., \n\
    whether the user is stationary or not), as well as environment. This data can\
    \ be collaboratively used to \nobtain information regarding the weather with location\
    \ information [90]. \nGiven the number of smartphones users in the world, this\
    \ enables pervasive sensing. With \nsmartphones fitted with a variety of sensors\
    \ such as GPS, gyroscopes, accelerometers and compasses, \nsmartphones enable\
    \ a variety of crowd sourcing applications, which will be eventually augmented\
    \ by \nthe Internet of Things. In particular, collaborative data collection is\
    \ a popular crowd sourcing application.  \nExamples include MobSens [91], which\
    \ combines four applications: PollutionSpy to monitor air \npollution; NoiseSpy\
    \ which captures noise levels; MobAsthma, a personalized asthma monitoring \n\
    application; and Fresh, an application which provides a platform to let users\
    \ discuss issues regarding \ntheir environment. \nAlthough crowd sourcing is typically\
    \ outsourcing work tasks to people, crowd sourcing can also be \nused for sensing,\
    \ as described in [92]. Crowd reporting, as described in [92], consists of collecting\
    \ \ninformation from sources such as mobile devices and social networks. The data\
    \ reported can be in the \nform of messages which are aggregated and converted\
    \ into a uniform format, for processing. The data \nSensors 2013, 13 \n415 \n\
    \ \n \nis collected from Twitter as using a set of keywords to select relevant\
    \ information. This data is then \npre-processed, filtered and clustered so that\
    \ event correlation can be determined. \nAlthough sensing through crowd sourcing\
    \ (i.e., pervasive sensing) is appealing to a number of \npromising applications,\
    \ there are still a number of challenges, which are not necessarily of a  \ntechnical\
    \ nature. Privacy, in particular, is possibly the biggest challenge. Additionally,\
    \ involving the \nnot-so-evident risks related to large-scale data collection\
    \ as well as legal issues such as data ownership, \nuser protection [93] and trust\
    \ needs to be insured as entities responsible for analyzing the collected \ndata,\
    \ can abuse the collected information or use it to harm the user. \n5.11. Summary\
    \ of Benefits of Smart Sensing \nFrom the content presented in this section, it\
    \ is evident that advanced sensing applications in cities \nenable improvement\

    \ \nThe concept of a smart city as a system that is highly intelligent and autonomous\
    \ is far from being \nrealized. Even with recent breakthroughs in technology,\
    \ available technology is still not sufficiently \nmature for smart cities to\
    \ be truly autonomous. Nevertheless, there are currently pilot projects of smart\
    \ \ncities in development worth mentioning. \nSensors 2013, 13 \n416 \n \n \n\
    Development for Songdo [94], a fully ubiquitous 1,500 acre city in South Korea,\
    \ started in 2001 \nand is predicted to be complete by 2015. Smart systems in\
    \ every building are used to monitor the water \nand electricity, which also allow\
    \ residents to connect remotely using their smartphones. Sensing \ntechnologies\
    \ include RFID tags on vehicles, which send signals to sensors on the road to\
    \ monitor \ntraffic flow, surveillance systems as well as smart street lights,\
    \ which can be adjusted to pedestrian \ntraffic. Some of the innovative technologies\
    \ in Songdo [95] include home and building automation \nwhere users will be able\
    \ to control the systems in their houses remotely. Ubiquitous sensors are \ndeployed\
    \ virtually everywhere, from buildings, (for safety purposes, for fire, etc.)\
    \ to flow sensors, \nwhich control the canal in Songdo’s Central Park, and on\
    \ street lights to adjust the level of  \nlighting according to the pedestrians’\
    \ flow. Smart power in Songdo is generated by natural gas and \ndistributed through\
    \ a smart grid. Tele-presence facilities are being installed in homes, hospitals\
    \ and \nshopping centers. \nPlanIT Valley [96] in Northern Portugal is another\
    \ pilot project for a fully ubiquitous city built from \nthe ground up, which\
    \ will accommodate 225,000 residents once it is completed. Completion is \nscheduled\
    \ for 2015. Ultimately, PlanIT has a goal of having 100,000,000 sensors deployed.\
    \ \nFujisawa Sustainable Smart Town (SST) [97] in Japan is also another project\
    \ which is currently \nunder development. Fujisawa is scheduled to be completed\
    \ by 2014 and fully inhabited by 2018, and \ndevelopment has started in September\
    \ 2012. It is being developed on 19 ha of land, with the goal of \naccommodating\
    \ 1,000 residents. Targets of 70% reduction of carbon emission are planned. \n\
    Amsterdam, unlike the previously mentioned fully ubiquitous cities which are being\
    \ built from \nscratch, has seen some recent developments en route to make it\
    \ a smart city. The main driver of this \ndevelopment is Amsterdam Smart City\
    \ project [98], which started in 2009, with the main goal of \nincreasing green\
    \ growth using technology. Currently, there are various initiatives within the\
    \ scope of \nAmsterdam Smart City; these services are tested in specific city\
    \ locations, such as IJburb. It includes \ninnovations such as West Orange (a\
    \ residential energy management system, which is able to let users \nknow about\
    \ their energy consumption on a per appliance basis) and a smart grid initiative\
    \ in Nieuw \nWest which services about 10,000 households. In Groningen, there\
    \ is a pilot project aiming to develop \na system which will use GPS data for\
    \ real time information of bus locations, readily available to users’ \nmobile\
    \ phones through a downloadable application [99]. \nThe city council of Norfolk\
    \ has also pilot projects which aim to make data services delivery to \ncitizens\
    \ more efficient, through the improvement of their data collection and data analysis,\
    \ to \nultimately gain improved customer insight [100]. This project also aims\
    \ to develop schemes of \ndelivering data to groups of users through localized\
    \ and personalized web services, based on users’ \ngeographical location. \nAnother\
    \ pilot project which has recently received significant attention is in Santander\
    \ [101]. This is \ncollaboration between academia and industry players which aims\
    \ to conduct IoT research in available \nlarge scale test-beds. Currently, various\
    \ sensor nodes are deployed in the city. A backbone provides the \narchitecture\
    \ necessary for all communication between these sensor nodes.  \nExamples of applications\
    \ enabled by sensor networks in Smart Santander include traffic \nmanagement,\
    \ irrigation optimization for parks and gardens, augmented reality and waste management.\
    \ \nEventually, it is envisaged that 12,000 sensors and actuators will be deployed\
    \ throughout the city by \n2013. Currently, there are approximately 2,000 nodes\
    \ deployed. Examples of implemented trial \nSensors 2013, 13 \n417 \n \n \napplications\
    \ include outdoor parking area management, real time monitoring of light, temperature\
    \ and \nenvironmental noise, as well as participatory sensing using sensors in\
    \ mobile phones. \nIn Barcelona, there are also important initiatives [102]. As\
    \ part of this initiative, for instance, \nsensors have been deployed in garbage\
    \ bins. Firstly, these allow remote monitoring of the content of \nbins, which\
    \ enable the development of an improved garbage collection system, therefore optimizing\
    \ \ngarbage collection services. Additionally, built-in sensors monitor the content\
    \ type in bins and smart \nhumidity sensors enable an automated intelligent water\
    \ use for public park irrigation. Panels \nstrategically placed announce free\
    \ parking places, saving residents’ time in locating parking spots. \nSensors\
    \ on streetlights detect presence and adjust the light intensity accordingly as\
    \ well. \nIn Malaga, another smart city initiative in Spain, smart city initiatives\
    \ aim to achieve a reduction of \nmore than 6,000 tons of carbon dioxide annually\
    \ [103]. To this end, Malaga has invested significantly \nin the city infrastructure,\
    \ including investments in a fiber optic network, municipal Wi-Fi networks and\
    \ \ngeographic information systems for the virtualization of urban indicators.\
    \ The current deployment \nincludes more than 17,000 deployed smart meters. \n\
    Vienna is another city with a number of initiatives from the smart city perspective.\
    \ The main \ninitiatives in Vienna deal primarily with energy efficiency, carbon\
    \ footprint reduction and climate \nprotection [104]. A large number of projects\
    \ are currently underway in Vienna. Table 4 summarizes \nthe goals of the cities\
    \ discussed in this section. \nTable 4. Current smart city pilot projects. \n\

    There are various challenges related to sensing in smart cities, both of a technical\
    \ and social nature. \nSome of these challenges are: \nAddressing and coordination\
    \ issues between sensor nodes: when nodes are deployed in \nmillions, how can\
    \ they be efficiently managed? Although 6LoWPAN enables IPv6 addressing \nsupport\
    \ on IEEE 802.15.4, efficient coordination (in terms of routing, for instance)\
    \ between \nsuch a high number of devices is a big challenge. \nSensors 2013,\
    \ 13 \n418 \n \n \nSecurity: enabling technologies for sensing applications have\
    \ a number of issues which have  \nto be considered within the context of smart\
    \ cities. These networks will be prone to  \ncyber-terrorism and cyber-vandalism.\
    \ Some of these issues are highlighted in [105] and [106]. \nData ownership and\
    \ privacy: who will own the rights for all data collected by these sensing \n\
    applications? For instance, if the electricity utility has access to an individual’s\
    \ energy \nconsumption data, can that data be used without one’s consent? \nTrust:\
    \ can individuals trust the entities responsible for aggregating and storing their\
    \ data? For \ninstance, the Cloud can be considered a central information system\
    \ where access to data is \ntypically controlled by the company which owns the\
    \ infrastructure. Can these companies  \nbe trusted? \nSocial Issues: residents\
    \ have always been actively involved in a city. For instance, there are \ncollaborative\
    \ initiatives where people come together and help keeping the city clean by \n\
    promoting no littering, etc. Will smart cities (with all the automated processes\
    \ and sophisticated \ntechnology), create some sort of disconnect between the\
    \ people and the city? Then there is the \nissue of education as well. Is the\
    \ average person educated enough to use and understand all \nthese systems? \n\
    Centralized control: it is evident from the content of this paper that we are\
    \ moving towards a \ncentralized control scheme, where all services are being\
    \ progressively aggregated, to be \nmanaged by one huge central system. This translates\
    \ to complete control by the governing \nbodies, which can be used to illegally\
    \ track people or invade someone’s privacy. This is related \nto the trust and\
    \ privacy issues previously mentioned. \nCosts incurred in upgrading current cities:\
    \ how expensive will it be to upgrade current cities \nto make them smart cities?\
    \ As smart cities are heavily dependent on communication and other \ninfrastructures,\
    \ it will certainly be very expensive to update all the current systems. \nThe\
    \ reader is referred to [48], where the authors discuss the major technical challenges\
    \ of WSNs in \nsmart-grid applications. \n8. Conclusions \nIn this paper, the\
    \ role of advanced sensing in smart cities was discussed. An array of applications\
    \ in \nsmart cities which can benefit from advanced sensing were described. These\
    \ include infrastructure \nhealth monitoring, electricity and water distribution\
    \ systems, transportation systems and surveillance, \namongst others. The state\
    \ of the art in each of the considered applications is reviewed and inherent \n\
    challenges are highlighted. In a world where carbon emissions have to be reduced\
    \ for greener living \nand sustainability is promoted, there are a still a lot\
    \ of challenges to be resolved. \nIt is evident that the evolution of technology\
    \ will play a major role in advanced sensing, as the \nevolution of hardware required\
    \ for sensing applications will certainly be driven by these technological \n\
    advances. Even though there are pilot projects for smart cities, there are various\
    \ challenges. These \nchallenges require a holistic approach for solving, which\
    \ will involve multi-disciplinary collaborations. \nFor instance, standardization\
    \ efforts should consider all involved parties, such as municipalities, \nutilities\
    \ and other services providers so that unified solutions in terms of sensing and\
    \ communication \ninfrastructures are put in place. It will be inefficient to\
    \ have separate infrastructures (in terms of \nSensors 2013, 13 \n419 \n \n \n\
    sensing platforms), but it will also be challenging to unify these services under\
    \ a single infrastructure \n(i.e., have the same network on the water distribution\
    \ system as well as the electricity system). \nFurthermore, non-technical challenges\
    \ regarding social issues, like education, also need to be \nconsidered. In the\
    \ context of smart city, it is expected that people will have a certain level\
    \ of skill to \nunderstand these systems and be able to use them. For instance,\
    \ the innovative solution brought about \nby advances in sensing technologies,\
    \ such as improved demand prediction and smart metering, result \nin a more efficient\
    \ electricity distribution system, where the customer also plays a role, by adhering\
    \ to \nincentive programs. But to what extent does the customer want to be really\
    \ involved? Some \nindividuals might not even take advantage of such services.\
    \ These factors should be taken into \nconsideration before services are implemented.\
    \ \nAlthough there are already existing systems and initiatives for smart cities,\
    \ the infrastructure to \nimplement a fully ubiquitous city will be costly. Furthermore,\
    \ the cost of restructuring existing cities to \nfit the fully ubiquitous city\
    \ model will incur much higher costs. \nThe first pilot projects mentioned in\
    \ this paper will serve as a model for fully ubiquitous cities to be \nimplemented\
    \ in future, and will provide insights into additional challenges in the realization\
    \ of smart \ncities. Still, there are numerous challenges to be solved before\
    \ fully ubiquitous cities become a reality. \nAcknowledgment \nThe research was\

    \ to provide farmers with a\nlarge amount of information. Precision agriculture\
    \ (PA) is a management strategy that employs\ninformation technology to improve\
    \ quality and production. Utilizing wireless sensor technologies\nand management\
    \ tools can lead to a highly effective, green agriculture. Based on PA management,\n\
    the same routine to a crop regardless of site environments can be avoided. From\
    \ several perspectives,\nﬁeld management can improve PA, including the provision\
    \ of adequate nutrients for crops and the\nwastage of pesticides for the effective\
    \ control of weeds, pests, and diseases. This review outlines the\nrecent applications\
    \ of WSNs in agriculture research as well as classiﬁes and compares various wireless\n\
    communication protocols, the taxonomy of energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting\
    \ techniques for\nWSNs that can be used in agricultural monitoring systems, and\
    \ comparison between early research\nworks on agriculture-based WSNs. The challenges\
    \ and limitations of WSNs in the agricultural domain\nare explored, and several\
    \ power reduction and agricultural management techniques for long-term\nmonitoring\
    \ are highlighted. These approaches may also increase the number of opportunities\
    \ for\nprocessing Internet of Things (IoT) data.\nKeywords: energy-efﬁcient; energy\

    1. Introduction\nWireless sensor network (WSN) technologies have rapidly developed\
    \ over the years. Ecological\nphenomena in a vast area can be monitored using\
    \ pervasive devices called motes or sensor nodes.\nBattery-powered WSNs comprise\
    \ several sensors, processors, and radio frequency (RF) modules.\nThe sensor nodes\
    \ or motes can communicate wirelessly through a communication link and forward\n\
    their data to a base station or coordinator node by communicating with a gateway.\
    \ The communication\namong sensor nodes depends on the merging of diverse sensors\
    \ from simple (i.e., humidity, pressure,\nand temperature) to complex (i.e., localization,\
    \ tracking, micro-radars, and images), thereby allowing\nWSNs to monitor a wide\
    \ range of surroundings to obtain precise information from the ﬁeld [1].\nAccordingly,\
    \ the sensing, storage, processing, and communication capabilities of sensor nodes\
    \ have\ncontinuously increased [2].\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781; doi:10.3390/s17081781\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n2 of 45\nWSNs have been\
    \ used in different applications, such as military, agriculture, sports, medicine,\
    \ and\nindustry. Agriculture can be considered as one of the most favorable facilities\
    \ for WSNs to improve\nfood crop yields and minimize the burden of farmers [3].\
    \ Several projects have been introduced in\nthe precision agriculture (PA) literature.\
    \ PA aims to prevent the application of the same management\nroutine to a crop\
    \ regardless of site circumstances and to improve ﬁeld management from several\n\
    perspectives. For instance, PA can minimize the wastage of pesticides for the\
    \ effective control of weeds,\npests, and diseases as well as guarantee that crops\
    \ receive an adequate amount of nutrients, thereby\nleading to a highly effective,\
    \ green agriculture. Speciﬁcally, PA is a management strategy that employs\ninformation\
    \ technology to improve agricultural quality and production. PA differs for traditional\n\
    farming in the sense that this process accurately identiﬁes variations and relates\
    \ the spatial data to\nmanagement activities. PA involves ﬁve stages, namely,\
    \ (i) data collection, (ii) diagnosis, (iii) data\nanalysis, (iv) precision ﬁeld\
    \ operation, and (v) evaluation [4].\nWSNs are used as cost-effective processes\
    \ to increase agricultural yield. Accordingly, WSNs have\nbeen used in different\
    \ agricultural applications, such as for monitoring climate and using soil nutrient\n\
    data to forecast the health of crops and the quality of agricultural products.\
    \ Irrigation planning can\nbe predicted using WSNs by observing weather conditions\
    \ (such as temperature and humidity) and\nsoil moisture. Other sensor nodes can\
    \ be added to the existing WSN to improve the parameters of the\nagricultural\
    \ monitoring system and to make the network scalable. However, some challenges\
    \ have\nhindered the agricultural application of WSNs, such as determining optimum\
    \ deployment schemes,\nmeasurement periods, routing protocols, energy efﬁciency,\
    \ cost, communication range, scalability, and\nfault tolerance [5]. For example,\
    \ the scattered deployment of sensor nodes with a long data-gathering\nperiod\
    \ can help extend the network lifetime. However, some factors may challenge the\
    \ selection of the\ndistribution region. When the agricultural ﬁeld faces many\
    \ obstacles, the communication link may\nbe weakened or lost as a result of signal\
    \ attenuation. The sensor nodes in WSNs are supplied from\nthe battery, thereby\
    \ preventing connections to the main supply in the deployment location. Reducing\n\
    power depletion and prolonging battery life are imperative for WSNs considering\
    \ their limited battery\npower. Although the application of WSNs has increased\
    \ constantly over the years, the manufacturing\nof batteries has not developed\
    \ at the same rate [6]. Therefore, WSNs are mainly limited by their\nbatteries\
    \ [7]. Among the aforementioned challenges, this paper focuses on energy management\
    \ and\nhighlights energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting techniques that can be\
    \ used in agriculture.\nTo fulﬁll PA requirements, such as addressing the problems\
    \ resulting from the long distance\nbetween farms and base stations, a mobile\
    \ data connection service can be established by connecting\nunmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ or drones with the base station [4]. Such connection allows the sensor nodes\n\
    to relay their data to the base station within the wide area of the farm ﬁeld.\
    \ However, this solution is\nlimited by the quality of service of WSNs.\nThe main\
    \ contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n(i)\nThe potential of\
    \ using wireless communications protocols or technologies in agriculture was\n\
    investigated, and the technology with the best power consumption and communication\
    \ distance\nwas identiﬁed.\n(ii)\nThe taxonomy of energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting\
    \ techniques was examined to address the\npower consumption problems in agriculture\
    \ and to identify those methods that are most suitable\nfor solving these problems.\n\
    (iii)\nThe existing solutions, applicability, and limitations of applying WSNs\
    \ in agriculture were\nreviewed and compared.\n(iv)\nRecent studies using WSN\
    \ in PA applications based on Internet of Things (IoT) were surveyed\nand compared\
    \ in terms of type of sensors and actuators, IoT end devices, IoT platforms, and\
    \ IoT\napplication layer.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n3 of 45\n2. Wireless Communication\
    \ Technologies for Agriculture\nThis section presents the different wireless protocols\
    \ and standards that are used in agriculture.\nThese wireless technologies are\
    \ also compared to identify the most convenient technology in terms of\npower\
    \ consumption and communication range, where the two metrics are posed challenges\
    \ in current\nsolution of agriculture application [5,8]. IoT is a revolution for\
    \ the future realm where everything\nthat can utilize a connection will be connected.\
    \ Cellular technologies are grown and developed to\nplay a crucial role in the\
    \ IoT realm [9]. Narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT) is a new IoT system constructed\nfrom\
    \ current Long Term Evolution (LTE) functionalities. Subsequently, NB-IoT is possible\
    \ to share the\nspectrum of LTE without coexistence problems and to utilize the\
    \ same pieces of equipment, as well\nas it is possible to connect seamlessly into\
    \ the LTE main network. This permits all network facilities\nsuch as security,\
    \ tracking, policy, charging, and authentication to be totally supported [10].\
    \ The design\ngoals of NB-IoT cover high coverage area, extended battery life\
    \ (i.e., 10 years), high network size\n(52,000 devices/channel/cell), and low-cost\
    \ devices [10,11]. However, in the near future, NB-IoT\ntechnologies, such as\
    \ Long Range radio (LoRa) will take place in agricultural applications due to\
    \ low\npower consumption and preferably used when the agricultural information\
    \ are to be transmitted over\nlong distances.\n2.1. ZigBee Wireless Protocol\n\
    ZigBee wireless protocol is considered one of the best candidate technologies\
    \ for the agriculture\nand farming domains. Given its low duty cycle, ZigBee is\
    \ considered appropriate for PA applications,\nsuch as irrigation supervision\
    \ [12], water quality management, and fertilizer and pesticide control,\nall of\
    \ which require a cyclic information update. Based on this technology, the sensor\
    \ nodes in the\nagricultural ﬁeld can communicate with the router or coordinator\
    \ node over a long range (i.e., 100 m)\nwhen XBee Series 2 is used. ZigBee can\
    \ also reduce the communication distance by up to 30 m for\nindoor conditions\
    \ (i.e., greenhouses) [13]. The number of deployed sensor and router nodes will\
    \ be\nincreased to cover the entire ﬁeld area under surveillance. Some studies\
    \ have employed Zigbee for PA.\nFor instance, ZigBee was used to investigate the\
    \ effect of signal strength on node spacing, base station\nantenna height, and\
    \ leaf density [14]. In [14], three experiments were conducted in palm orchards\
    \ in\nto evaluate a signal propagation model based on the received signal strength\
    \ indicator (RSSI) of the\nZigBee wireless protocol. Through their experiments,\
    \ the authors concluded that the wireless channel\npropagation model must be determined\
    \ before deploying the sensor nodes in palm orchards to obtain\nrobust signal\
    \ strength characteristics. A path loss model in a mango greenhouse was investigated\n\
    based on the ZigBee wireless protocol [15].\nA cattle-localization-system-based\
    \ ZigBee WSN was also applied in a grazing ﬁeld [16]. Instead of\nrequiring additional\
    \ hardware, ZigBee relies on link quality indication (LQI) to measure distance.\
    \ The\nZigBee protocol achieves cattle localization at a low power consumption\
    \ and minimum cost. The key\nparameters of greenhouse climate (i.e., humidity,\
    \ temperature, CO2, and solar radiation) are considered\nin [17] to ensure the\
    \ comfortable growth of plants with 22% energy savings and 33% water usage.\n\
    ZigBee and Global System for Mobile communication/General Packet Radio Service\
    \ (GSM/GPRS)\ntechnologies were used to monitor and control the climate condition\
    \ of greenhouses [17]. The ZigBee\nwireless protocol has also been used to monitor\
    \ animal behavior (e.g., walking, grazing, lying down,\nand standing) [18]. ZigBee\
    \ was also adopted in [18] to overcome the high power consumption and\nunreliability\
    \ issues in mobile ad hoc WSNs.\nA WSN-based greenhouse that uses ZigBee star\
    \ topology is merged with artiﬁcial intelligence\n(i.e., fuzzy logic controller)\
    \ in [19]. The ZigBee wireless protocol is adopted to preserve energy by\nswitching\
    \ between active and sleep states. Thus, power consumption can be minimized, and\
    \ the\nbattery lifetime of sensor nodes can be extended. ZigBee is currently applied\
    \ in smart beehives [20],\norange orchards [21], dairy healthcare monitoring of\
    \ cows in pastures and barns [22], automation in\nirrigation [23], greenhouse\
    \ monitoring systems [24,25], and livestock monitoring [26]. As a universal\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n4 of 45\nstandard for WSNs, the ZigBee protocol was used\
    \ in several agricultural applications because of its\nlow power consumption,\
    \ low cost, self-forming characteristics, and suitable communication range.\n\
    2.2. Bluetooth (BT) Wireless Protocol\nThe BT standard has been utilized to establish\
    \ a communication link between movable and\nportable devices, such as laptops,\
    \ over a short distance of up to 10 m. Given its pervasive nature\nand availability\
    \ in most mobile devices, BT has been employed to satisfy multi-level agricultural\n\
    requirements [5].\nWeather information, soil moisture, sprinkler position, and\
    \ temperature are\nmonitored remotely using Global Positioning System (GPS) and\
    \ BT technologies. The proposed\nsystem in [27] was developed for irrigation application\
    \ to increase ﬁeld productivity and conserve\nwater. The irrigation application\
    \ proposed in [28] collects ﬁeld information in real time via the BT\nwireless\
    \ communication protocol. Several software and hardware were developed in [29]\
    \ to monitor\nthe relative humidity and temperature in greenhouses based on BT.\
    \ The BT module was employed in\nintegrated control method [30] to control the\
    \ irrigation system in greenhouses based on soil and weather\ninformation, and\
    \ this technology improved the leaf number, height, dry weight, and fresh weight\n\
    of red and romaine lettuce in greenhouses. Result of estimation for water usage\
    \ and electricity also\nimproved by 90% based on integrated control method using\
    \ BT technology relative to the traditional\nmethod (i.e., timer control strategy).\
    \ Given its low energy consumption, wide availability, and ease of\nuse for farmers,\
    \ smartphone-based BT has been employed in different agricultural applications\
    \ [31–35],\nsuch as controlling irrigation systems, monitoring soil and weather\
    \ conditions, and controlling the use\nof fertilizers and pesticides.\n2.3. WiFi\
    \ Wireless Protocol\nWiFi is currently the most extensively utilized wireless\
    \ technology available in portable devices,\nincluding tablets, smartphones, laptops,\
    \ and desktops. WiFi has a suitable communication distance of\nabout 20 m and\
    \ 100 m in indoor and outdoor environments, respectively. In PA applications,\
    \ WiFi\nextends diverse architectures by connecting several types of devices via\
    \ an ad hoc network. WiFi and\n3G wireless technologies were employed in [36]\
    \ to estimate the agricultural applications of mobile\nphones. Remote access and\
    \ short message services have also been used for controlling and monitoring\n\
    protected crops. In [37], agricultural data, such as soil temperature, soil moisture,\
    \ weather temperature\nand humidity, sunlight intensity, and CO2, were stored\
    \ in a gateway before they were transmitted\nto the server computer over a WiFi\
    \ network. A Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11g)-based smart WSN is proposed\nfor agricultural\
    \ monitoring in [38]. The proposed system consists of three nodes: sensor, router,\
    \ and\nserver. The climate conditions of the greenhouse or agricultural ﬁeld,\
    \ such as humidity, temperature,\nair pressure, light, water level, and soil moisture,\
    \ are monitored. The said work attempts to lower cost,\nminimize wiring connections,\
    \ and enhance the mobility and ﬂexibility of the sensing points in WSN.\nHowever,\
    \ the energy consumption of the proposed system is extremely high at 42.17 J/h.\n\
    Given that WiFi requires much power [5], long communication time, and huge data\
    \ payload [26].\nWiFi technology is not preferable for agricultural applications\
    \ in spite of the fact that a Wi-Fi server\nprevents data losses by adopting data\
    \ redundancy techniques. In addition, WiFi cannot be employed\nfor multi-hope\
    \ applications and inﬂuenced by number of users and the signal intensity; thereby,\n\
    it is inappropriate for agriculture WSNs. Moreover, the WiFi nodes listen all\
    \ the time, so power\nconsumption will increase [39].\n2.4. GPRS/3G/4G Technology\n\
    General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is a packet data service for GSM-based cellular\
    \ phones.\nGPRS frequently experiences variable delays and throughputs, and such\
    \ technology depends on the\nvolume of consumers that share the same communication\
    \ channels and resources. Gutiérrez et al. [40]\nused the GPRS module and WSN\
    \ to develop an automatic crop irrigation system based on the\ninformation collected\
    \ by temperature and soil moisture sensors installed at the root zone of plants,\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n5 of 45\nand considered this system a cost-effective and\
    \ practical solution for improving water quality in\nPA. A drip irrigation process\
    \ was evaluated in [41] by measuring soil moisture. A prototype system\nwas also\
    \ developed based on a data management server and a WSN-GPRS gateway. WSN-GPRS\n\
    gateway acts as a bridge between WSN and GPRS where the data from the WSN are\
    \ transferred to a\ndata management center. Navarro-Hellín et al. [42] equipped\
    \ various wireless nodes with GPRS to\nmeasure and transmit soil, plant, and atmosphere\
    \ information. The wireless nodes have unlimited\nautonomy because of their independent\
    \ nature and use of solar energy. Different sensors may transmit\ninformation\
    \ to a remote location via a GPRS network for further analysis by using tablets,\
    \ mobile\nphones, or computers. All agriculture sensors are interfaced to the\
    \ sensor board to obtain agricultural\ninformation. Such information is transmitted\
    \ to the remote server for further analysis through the\nGPRS-board, which depends\
    \ on a GSM/GPRS mobile network.\n2.5. Long Range Radio (LoRa) Protocol\nLoRa is\
    \ introduced by the LoRa Alliance as a protocol stack for low power and wide area\
    \ Internet\nof Things (IoT) communication technologies that are associated with\
    \ indoor transmission [43]. The\nbasic network architecture of a LoRaWAN consists\
    \ of LoRa end devices, LoRa gateways, and a LoRa\nnetwork server. The LoRa end\
    \ device communicates with gateways that employ LoRa with LoRaWAN.\nLoRa gateways\
    \ pass raw LoRaWAN packets from the end devices to a LoRa network server with\n\
    a high throughput based on the backhaul interface, which is typically 3G or Ethernet.\
    \ Accordingly,\nLoRa gateways act as a bidirectional communication or protocol\
    \ adapter with the LoRa network\nserver. In this case, the LoRa network server\
    \ takes charge of decoding the data packets transmitted by\nthe LoRa devices and\
    \ creating the frames that would be directed back to the devices. LoRa offers\
    \ a\nbidirectional solution that matches machine-to-machine (M2M) WiFi or cellular\
    \ technologies. LoRa\npresents a cost-effective method for linking batteries or\
    \ mobile devices to the network or to end devices.\nThe LoRa wireless protocol\
    \ was used in [44] to monitor bee colonies in rural areas and to ensure a\ncommunication\
    \ between the bee node and the local server that is located in a remote location.\
    \ The\nsoil moisture and temperature, air temperature and humidity, and light\
    \ intensity inside greenhouses\nwere also monitored using different sensors, microcontrollers,\
    \ and the LoRa wireless protocol [8]. The\nLoRa gateway collects data from LoRa\
    \ nodes to construct the topology of a star network, and may\ncommunicate with\
    \ a cloud server over a long communication range and with high scalability.\n\
    LoRa was recently utilized in several agriculture research projects developed\
    \ by the Libelium\nCompany (Zaragoza, Spain) [45], such as improving kiwi production\
    \ based on a smart irrigation system\n(Italy), monitoring of green areas by using\
    \ a smart garden system (Spain), improving fertilization\nmethods of corn yields\
    \ (Italy), improving production of banana yields (Colombia), increasing\ntobacco\
    \ crops by controlling the climate condition (Italy), saving water through a smart\
    \ irrigation\nsystem (Barcelona), monitoring of vineyard crops (Spain), and monitoring\
    \ of diseases that affect\nvineyards (Switzerland).\n2.6. SigFox Protocol\nSigFox\
    \ is an ultra-narrowband wireless cellular network [43] with low data rate applications,\n\
    thereby making this technology appropriate for IoT and machine-type communications\
    \ systems.\nSigFox has been used in different applications, including telephone,\
    \ security, mobile, broadband, and\ntelevision. The SigFox network was used in\
    \ [46,47] to construct a geolocation system that localizes\nanimals in mountain\
    \ pastures throughout the summer. A system was proposed in [46] to help farmers\n\
    locate their cattle and enhance their production. The importance of power consumption\
    \ analyses was\nhighlighted in [47], especially when the cattle are located in\
    \ high mountainous areas.\n2.7. Performance Comparison of Wireless Communication\
    \ Protocols\nTable 1 compares the aforementioned wireless communication protocols\
    \ or technologies relative\nto different parameters, including power consumption,\
    \ communication range, data rate, cost, system\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n6 of 45\n\
    complexity, and other parameters. The challenges in agricultural applications\
    \ may be developed from\nthe selection of the deployment range. For instance,\
    \ the transmitted signal by the sensor node is\nattenuated when the agriculture\
    \ ﬁeld is separated by obstacles. Power consumption is considered as\nanother\
    \ limitation in the WSN design in agricultural applications [5]. The ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol was\ndesigned to run with a suitable communication range and low power\
    \ consumption. LoRa and SigFox\nare considered to work with low power consumption\
    \ and long radio range. Accordingly, the power\nconsumption and communication\
    \ distance of the above technologies have been assessed as follows.\nZigbee and\
    \ Bluetooth low energy (BLE) are designed for battery-powered devices.\nThese\n\
    technologies conserve power through low duty cycling and enter sleep mode to extend\
    \ the battery\nlifetime. Classic BT, WiFi, GPRS, LoRa, and SigFox have a higher\
    \ power consumption than ZigBee.\nAlthough ZigBee has a shorter communication\
    \ range than LoRa, SigFox, and GPRS, this range may be\nextended with a router\
    \ node to overcome the node deployment limitations in agricultural applications.\n\
    BLE outperforms ZigBee in terms of power consumption, but this wireless protocol\
    \ is limited in\nagricultural applications because of its short communication\
    \ distance of 10 m, as reported in [48].\nZigBee also has a higher network elasticity\
    \ than BT, thereby permitting various topologies. Given the\nlarge number of nodes\
    \ (more than 65,000) in the ZigBee network, the ZigBee technology can be used\n\
    to cover a wide agricultural. Accordingly, the ZigBee wireless protocol has been\
    \ adopted in many\nagriculture studies [5,49–53]. One of these studies [5] prefers\
    \ to utilize ZigBee in farming domains and\nagricultural applications owing to\
    \ its energy-efﬁcient, reliable, and low-cost wireless protocol.\nThe LoRa wireless\
    \ protocol covers a large communication area with low power consumption.\nTherefore,\
    \ it can be suitably deployed in vast agricultural ﬁelds. The network size of\
    \ the LoRa protocol\nis limited by its duty cycle, where a 1% duty cycle can lead\
    \ to a maximum communication time of 36 s\nper hour for each end device [54].\
    \ In addition, LoRa gateways have a limited message capacity of less\nthan 100\
    \ messages per minute because of the unplanned deployment of LoRa gateways in\
    \ urban areas,\nthereby interfering with low power wireless area networks, such\
    \ as SigFox. Therefore, increasing the\nnumber of gateways can challenge the infrastructure\
    \ of the LoRa network [54]. Moreover, the LoRa\ntechnology is complex and has\
    \ sizable hardware implementations [55].\nSigFox has an extremely low data rate\
    \ (100 bps) and slow transmission time (10 s for 10 bytes)\ncompared with ZigBee\
    \ and LoRa [56]. SigFox supports star topology supervised by a centralized sever\n\
    that manages connectivity between devices and the base stations, whereas the LoRa\
    \ supports wide\narea network based on star-to-star topology creating a bridge\
    \ of LoRa gateways. Given that data rate\nand transmission time are both critical\
    \ issue in any communication system, SigFox cannot be widely\nused for agricultural\
    \ applications. Moreover, this technology does not support the collision avoidance\n\
    scheme, thereby affecting the network because several M2M devices may be operated\
    \ in the same\narea. Moreover, SigFox has a limited reliability because of its\
    \ one-way communication (without an\nacknowledgment signal) and low received power.\
    \ However, both the LoRa and SigFox infrastructures\nare still in progress. Ali\
    \ et al. further discuss the limitations of these protocols [56].\nFrom the above\
    \ discussion and the comparison results presented in Table 1 and Figure 1\nand\
    \ as will be shown in Tables 2–8 the ZigBee and LoRa wireless protocols have been\
    \ identiﬁed\nas the most suitable wireless protocols for agricultural applications\
    \ because of their low power\nconsumption, communication range (acceptable for\
    \ ZigBee and long for LoRa), small size, easy\nnetwork implementation, simplicity,\
    \ low latency (for ZigBee), scalability, and network size.\nSensors 2017, 17,\
    \ 1781\n7 of 45\n \ninfrastructures are still in progress. Ali et al. further\
    \ discuss the limitations of these protocols [56].  \nFrom the above discussion\
    \ and the comparison results presented in Table 1 and Figure 1 and as \nwill be\
    \ shown in Tables 2–8 the ZigBee and LoRa wireless protocols have been identified\
    \ as the most \nsuitable wireless protocols for agricultural applications because\
    \ of their low power consumption, \ncommunication range (acceptable for ZigBee\
    \ and long for LoRa), small size, easy network \nimplementation, simplicity, low\
    \ latency (for ZigBee), scalability, and network size. \n \nFigure 1. Different\
    \ wireless technologies in terms of power consumption and communication \ndistance.\
    \ \nFigure 1. Different wireless technologies in terms of power consumption and\
    \ communication distance.\nPA using sensors, actuator, processor, wireless transceiver,\
    \ and other information technologies,\npotentially permits manufacturers to computerize\
    \ site-speciﬁc management for automated agriculture.\nIn terms of precision, the\
    \ considered wireless protocols for agricultural applications have improved\n\
    the agriculture domain. Precision irrigation is frequently regarded as optimizing\
    \ irrigation accuracy\ndue to its ability to control the optimum amount of water\
    \ and irrigation time. The water savings\nof 90% (based on ZigBee), 33% (based\
    \ on ZigBee), 50% (based on Bluetooth), and 90% (based on\nBluetooth) were achieved\
    \ for precision irrigation systems relative to traditional irrigation systems\
    \ in\nresearch [17,28,30,40], respectively. Animal behavior, such as laying down,\
    \ standing, grazing, walking,\nand other modes, was monitored in [18] using ZigBee\
    \ wireless protocol. The authors found that\nlaying down and grazing could be\
    \ improved by 83.5% compared with the ﬁndings from similar\nstudies. In another\
    \ study that has adopted a proposed algorithm that depended on the ZigBee wireless\n\
    protocol [20], an accuracy rate of 95.4% was expected for the proposed algorithm\
    \ to monitor the\nhoney bee and the agricultural and environmental aspects. In\
    \ [23], the automation of the irrigation\nsystem based on ZigBee saved the system\
    \ cost between 1.24% and 6.72% relative to the entire cost\nof the water user\
    \ associations, with energy savings of 2.05 to 8.21% and water savings of 0.71\
    \ to\n6.46%. The proposed model in [35] utilized a smartphone platform (based\
    \ on Bluetooth and GSM\ntechnologies) and permitted three types of irrigation\
    \ systems. The efﬁciency factors were improved\nby 90% for subsurface drip type\
    \ and 85% and 75% for high- and low-pressure overhead sprinkler\ntypes, respectively,\
    \ to compute for drift and evaporation before the water droplets approached the\n\
    soil. 3G technology was adopted by Libelium based on Waspmote wireless sensor\
    \ devices to monitor\nthe vineyards in Northwest Spain [57]. Phytosanitary treatments,\
    \ such as fungicides and fertilizers,\nwere minimized by 20% and growing yields\
    \ were enhanced by 15% based on PA. In [8], LoRa wireless\nprotocol was considered\
    \ to monitor the agriculture environments with 90% power efﬁciency. The cost\n\
    of pumping and water for precision irrigation system in green areas was reduced\
    \ by 30% based on\nSigFox wireless protocol [58].\nThe preceding survey for different\
    \ agricultural applications revealed that PA can be achieved\nin terms of water\
    \ savings, animal behavior, accuracy, power efﬁciency, and reducing system cost\n\
    for various wireless protocols. Consequently, agriculture can be improved based\
    \ on agricultural\nautomation systems compared with traditional agriculture systems.\n\

    \ may operate at different energy states. Therefore, the lifespan of a sensor\
    \ node is the\ntime consumed to exhaust its batteries under a sustainable operation\
    \ threshold.\nNumerous scholars have developed power reduction techniques to provide\
    \ sensor nodes an\ninﬁnite lifespan. This section reviews several power reduction\
    \ techniques of WSNs that can be used in\nagricultural applications. The purposes,\
    \ wireless protocols, ﬁndings, advantages, and limitations of\neach technique\
    \ are also discussed.\n3.1.1. Sleep/Wake Strategy\nWireless transceivers consume\
    \ a signiﬁcant amount of power relative to processors. The energy\nof the wireless\
    \ nodes is mostly dissipated during the reception and transmission processes.\
    \ The radio\nof sensor nodes can enter sleep mode via the sleep/wake strategy\
    \ to reduce the power consumption\nof the RF components of WSNs. No data communication\
    \ occurs during the sleep mode. The sensor\nnodes wake up to collect and transmit\
    \ data within a certain period and then return to sleep mode\nto conserve energy.\
    \ In agricultural applications, the sleep/wake strategy is implemented via (i)\
    \ duty\ncycling, (ii) medium-access control (MAC) protocols, and (iii) topology\
    \ control.\nDuty cycle is proposed in several studies to lower the power consumption\
    \ for different agricultural\napplications based on WSN. Zhang et al. [69] proposed\
    \ a WSN-based system to monitor soil moisture\nand analyzed the temporal and spatial\
    \ variability of soil moisture for variable irrigation. To reduce the\npower consumption\
    \ of the soil sensor nodes, the soil moisture sensors were always in sleep mode\
    \ and\nactivated only when data were to be collected. Million et al. [70] designed\
    \ a WSN for PA in Malawi\nand called it WiPAM. This system was intended to automate\
    \ irrigation and implement an irrigation\nmanagement system (IMS). The authors\
    \ investigated soil moisture variability. The sensor nodes\nwere homogeneous,\
    \ and each was composed of a ZigBee end device (ZED) and a ZigBee coordinator\n\
    (ZC). In the star topology, three sensors nodes were conﬁgured as ZED (in ﬁeld-nodes)\
    \ and one as a\ngateway node. Another node was conﬁgured as ZC for aggregating\
    \ data and actuating the irrigation\nvalves. The power source to sustain the operation\
    \ of the network was solar power. This approach\nwas complemented by an energy-efﬁcient\
    \ management approach. In other words, sensor nodes went\nto sleep when idle and\
    \ woke up to transmit data when required. The irrigation valves opened or\nclosed\
    \ depending on the values stored in the coordinator node. Ouadjaout et al. [71]\
    \ presented an\nenergy-efﬁcient WSN for soil moisture monitoring in an irrigation\
    \ system. The new platform, DZ50,\nconsists of an RFM12b transceiver and an ATmega328P\
    \ microcontroller. This platform consumes very\nlow power, and much energy can\
    \ be saved in sleep mode, in which the transceiver goes inactive (sleep\nmode)\
    \ for long periods. Comparison showed that the performance of DZ50 is better than\
    \ that of\nTelosB and MicaZ. Speciﬁcally, the battery lifetime of DZ50 is seven\
    \ times that of TelosB and MicaZ\nbased on a 10 s sampling period. Monitoring\
    \ of environmental conditions, such as wind direction,\nwind speed, humidity,\
    \ temperature, conductivity, rain level, pH, and water level, in crop ﬁelds was\n\
    presented in [72]. A solar cell was used to power several sensor nodes deployed\
    \ at a distance of 500 m\nto 5 km. WSNs based on IEEE 802.15.4 (C1120 transceiver)\
    \ and GPRS/3G were adopted to transmit the\nrural environments to the base station.\
    \ Energy was saved through low duty cycling (3.3%) for the RF\ntransceiver; the\
    \ saved energy is equivalent to 30 s of wake up time every 15 min. In addition,\
    \ a 2-watt\nsolar cell was used to supply power to the overall system, whose total\
    \ average power consumption\nwas 207 mW.\nMAC protocols were also proposed in\
    \ previous research on agriculture WSNs [39,73–76].\nSudha et al. [39] proposed\
    \ an energy-efﬁcient TDMA-based algorithm for wireless sensor\ncommunications\
    \ in an automatic irrigation system. Their experiment involved a header node that\n\
    collected data directly from all the nodes in the ﬁeld and passed these data to\
    \ the base station (BS).\nThis network arrangement was a star single-hop topology.\
    \ These techniques attain power savings\nof 10% with a high communication distance\
    \ of 1 km between the sensor node and the base station.\nHowever, when this distance\
    \ increases, the power consumption also increases. López et al. [75]\nproposed\
    \ a WSN for monitoring horticultural yields, which are disseminated among small\
    \ plots\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n11 of 45\nscattered at a communication distance\
    \ of 10 km. The air temperature and soil moisture are collected\nduring a 10-week\
    \ period. The authors adopted the MAC protocol and star topology to conserve the\n\
    power consumption of the sensor nodes that used the IEEE 802.15.4 standard based\
    \ on the CC2420\ntransceiver. The lifetimes of the soil moisture and air temperature\
    \ sensor nodes are 1024 days and\n222 days, respectively, utilizing a battery\
    \ that delivers 2700 mAh.\nThe topology protocol scheme can be used in agricultural\
    \ monitoring WSNs to modify the network\ntopology according to the application\
    \ requirements, thereby reducing the number of active nodes in\na network. Some\
    \ nodes in the network can enter sleep mode to prolong the network lifetime when\n\
    they are not sensing the same area of interest. Aneeth and Jayabarathi [77] implemented\
    \ Ad hoc\nOn-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocols\
    \ over a different\ntopology of ZigBee WSN (i.e., cluster topology, random topology,\
    \ star topology with gateway based\non two cases; inside and outside) in simulation\
    \ environments by using the OPNET software (Riverbed,\nSan Francisco, CA, USA).\
    \ Twenty soil moisture sensor nodes and one gateway node were distributed\nin\
    \ a farmland with a dimension of 100 × 100 m2. Each node sends information about\
    \ the soil moisture\nto the gateway node through the ZigBee wireless protocol.\
    \ The gateway node passes the information to\nthe controlling system to control\
    \ the irrigation valve system. Their study showed that the star topology\nusing\
    \ DSR protocol reduces the power consumption of the WSN because it has less routing\
    \ overhead\ncompared with AODV protocol. Table 2 shows the comparison of power\
    \ reduction technique based on\nsleep/wake schemes for previous research in agricultural\
    \ applications.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n12 of 45\nTable 2. Sleep/wake schemes\

    \ power is mostly dissipated in the RF components of WSNs than\nin data processing\
    \ units, such as microcontrollers and microprocessors [80]. A number of scholars\n\
    have applied various radio optimization schemes or techniques, including (i) transmission\
    \ power\ncontrol (TPC), (ii) modulation scheme, and (iii) cognitive radio, to\
    \ reduce the power consumption\nof the RF components of agriculture sensor nodes.\
    \ In the TPC scheme, the sensor nodes modify the\ntransmitted power to save energy,\
    \ stimulate avoiding interference, and establish a communication\nlink [81]. TPC\
    \ can be used in the agricultural ﬁeld [82,83], where the RF transmitted power\
    \ of the\nsensor nodes can be modiﬁed to reduce their power consumption based\
    \ on the measured distance\nbetween the sink node and the sensor nodes. Sahota\
    \ et al. [82] have investigated the application of\nTPC in reducing the power\
    \ consumption of the sensor nodes in precision agriculture-based WSNs.\nSeveral\
    \ power levels and different receiver sensitivity levels are considered to perform\
    \ the said process.\nThe network layers and MAC protocol in a WSN (based on CC1110)\
    \ for the agriculture domain are\nadopted to further lower the power consumption\
    \ of the sensor node. Results show that the power\nsaving that employs multiple\
    \ modes of transmitted power can be improved by approximately 10%\nrelative to\
    \ the traditional mode. By contrast, Kamarudin et al. [83] prolonged the lifetime\
    \ of the sensor\nnode by more than 8.5% by modifying the transmitted power of\
    \ the CC2420 communication device.\nA cognitive radio is an intelligent wireless\
    \ communication network [84] in which the wireless\ncommunication channel in the\
    \ spectrum band can be selected efﬁciently [85]. The transmission metrics\n(e.g.,\
    \ transmitted power, carrier frequency, and modulation scheme) can be adjusted\
    \ accordingly.\nA cognitive radio requires more energy than conventional devices\
    \ do because it includes sophisticated\nand complex functions [86]. Therefore,\
    \ an energy-efﬁcient cognitive radio network poses challenges,\nespecially with\
    \ regard to the use of battery energy. In wireless communication, the electromagnetic\n\
    spectrum is fully occupied, with several bands being partially used or unused.\
    \ This situation supports\nthe utilization of a cognitive radio, in which spectrum\
    \ holes can be utilized.\nSabri et al. [19] fused fuzzy logic control (FLC) with\
    \ a ZigBee wireless sensor actor network\n(WSAN), which can sense the surroundings\
    \ and respond in ideal performance without interference\nfrom agricultural crops.\
    \ FLC assists the specialists in managing complex systems more compared with\n\
    traditional control methods, which are ineffective in terms of ﬂexibility, energy,\
    \ productivity, and labor\ninterference. Two signiﬁcant greenhouse environment\
    \ parameters (i.e., humidity and temperature)\nare monitored during daytime and\
    \ nighttime. The results show that the intelligent technique-based\nFLC can signiﬁcantly\
    \ improve the WSAN lifespan. Therefore, the WSAN can work for 14 years with a\n\
    210 mAh battery power based on the FLC merged with WSAN.\nThe power consumption\
    \ of networks can be directly affected by the modulation scheme [87]. The\nmodulation\
    \ parameters can be adjusted to their optimal values to preserve the minimum power\n\
    consumption of radio modules. Anane et al. [88] investigated the Frequency-shift\
    \ keying (FSK) and\nMinimum-shift keying (MSK) modulation strategies to minimize\
    \ the total power consumption of\nthe sensor node required to transmit given data\
    \ packets. Through their extensive study, the authors\nconcluded that MSK outperforms\
    \ FSK in terms of power consumption. However, several modulation\nschemes cannot\
    \ be used in the ZigBee wireless protocol that operates at 2.4 GHz because this\
    \ protocol\nsupports a single modulation scheme. Speciﬁcally, the ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol works with offset\nquadrature phase-shift keying (OQPSK) [89]. Table\

    \ Data Mitigation\nData mitigation presents another power consumption solution\
    \ for agriculture WSNs to reduce the\namount of data transmitted from source nodes\
    \ to destination nodes. Data mitigation can be achieved\nvia (i) data gathering,\
    \ (ii) data comparison, (iii) data rate, and (iv) data-driven techniques.\nData\
    \ gathering can extend the lifetime of sensor nodes in WSNs by minimizing redundant\
    \ data\ntransmission. In different applications of agriculture WSNs including\
    \ environment observation, the\nsensed data of the neighboring nodes may spatially\
    \ be associated. In this case, data combination\npresents an important method\
    \ for reducing the amount of redundant data, reducing the number\nof transmissions,\
    \ and minimizing the power consumption of the nodes in the network [90]. Data\n\
    gathering also reduces latency by minimizing data trafﬁc and improving the delay\
    \ between the sink\nand sensor nodes; after reducing the number of communications,\
    \ this approach can improve the\nexploitation of bandwidth [91]. Data merging\
    \ can be accomplished along a route starting from sensor\nnodes to sink nodes.\
    \ The nodes in a route can rebroadcast only the maximum, minimum, or average\n\
    amount of received data. The design of an energy-efﬁcient WSN-based data-gathering\
    \ scheme poses a\nsigniﬁcant challenge because this scheme must ensure a trade-off\
    \ among power consumption, latency,\nsecurity, data accuracy, and fault tolerance.\n\
    Gathering data in agricultural applications, including humidity, weather, temperature,\
    \ and soil\nmoisture, can minimize the power consumption of environment sensor\
    \ nodes by spatially correlating\nthe ﬁeld and redundant data of the sensor nodes\
    \ when the temperature does not change signiﬁcantly [1],\nespecially during nighttime.\
    \ For example, if the microcontroller of the temperature sensor node\nmeasures\
    \ the same temperature value for extended hours, then the sensor node sends the\
    \ temperature\nvalue every four hours to reduce power consumption. Merging the\
    \ temperature and humidity\nsensors into a single sensor may also reduce the power\
    \ consumption, size, and system complexity.\nAzaza et al. [17] integrated climate\
    \ condition parameters (i.e., temperature, CO2, humidity, and\nilluminance sensors)\
    \ inside a greenhouse and observed a comfortable growth of plants while saving\n\
    water resources and energy. The greenhouse was equipped with environment control\
    \ devices, such as\nventilation system, fogging system for humidiﬁcation, and\
    \ electrical heaters. A smart system based on\nfuzzy logic control correlated\
    \ humidity and temperature measurements is implemented to improve\nthe fogging\
    \ system operation. In that way, the power consumption of the fogging system can\
    \ be\nsigniﬁcantly reduced. In addition, the system was improved by a wireless\
    \ data observing platform\n(STM 32/F4 microcontroller and Virtex V FPGA board)\
    \ for logging and data routing, which provides\ndata access in real time. The\
    \ suggested control system based on fuzzy logic control was experimentally\nimplemented\
    \ and validated. The results revealed that the total energy and water usage decreased\
    \ by\n22% and 33%, respectively.\nMusaazi et al. [92] introduced a data caching\
    \ algorithm (DCAL) that optimizes the sleep/wake up\nperiods of ZigBee WSNs to\
    \ achieve low energy consumption and latency in PA application. In WSNs,\ndata\
    \ are collected from the source nodes and routed to the sink node; from the sink\
    \ node, the data\nare sent to the Internet. Reducing the transmission of duplicated\
    \ sensed data reduces the power\nconsumption. Energy conservation is paramount\
    \ during the communication phase to prolong the\nlifetime of sensor nodes. The\
    \ main method utilized to conserve energy involves switching off the nodes’\n\
    transceiver when they are not transmitting nor receiving packets. Additionally,\
    \ the data-gathering\nmethod for agriculture WSNs has been investigated in [93].\
    \ The proposed system includes ZigBee\nwireless sensor nodes, customized farming\
    \ personal digital assistants (PDAs), and a host PC. Each\nsensor node contains\
    \ four sensors to identify ﬁve agricultural ﬁeld parameters: soil temperature,\
    \ soil\nmoisture, environmental humidity, soil electrical conductivity, and environmental\
    \ temperature. The\nPDA combines the ZigBee coordinator node, GPRS module, and\
    \ GPS module. The ZigBee WSN\ngathers farming data and obtains GPS information\
    \ for each sensor node. It then passes the data to the\nhost PC through GPRS.\
    \ The experimental results show that the battery power of the sensor nodes can\n\
    be saved based on the data-gathering scheme.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n16 of 45\n\
    Data compression is a useful method for deploying sensor nodes with restricted\
    \ energy resources.\nInformation encoding can be performed in sensor nodes, whereas\
    \ information decoding can be\nperformed in sink nodes. Using compression techniques\
    \ to reduce the size of information that the\nsink nodes transmit over wireless\
    \ channels may also reduce the power consumption and extend the\nbattery life\
    \ of the sensor nodes. One study has applied data compression approaches to reduce\
    \ the\npower consumption for auto-irrigation system which based on CC1000 RF module\
    \ [41]. Based on this\nmethod, the battery of the sensor node can be extended\
    \ to 359 days.\nThe data-driven power reduction technique aims to reduce the amount\
    \ of sampled data by\nconserving the sensing accuracy to an appropriate level\
    \ for a speciﬁed application [94]. Thereby,\nthe amount of data to be transmitted\
    \ to the sink nodes can be minimized. Therefore, this technique\ncan reduce the\
    \ power consumption of agriculture WSNs and extend their battery life. A data-driven\n\
    algorithm is considered by Lerdsuwan and Phunchongharn [95] to solve the energy\
    \ consumption\nproblem of the sensor node in PA with low complexity and maintain\
    \ the transmission rate. Their\nexperiment reveals that their proposed algorithm\
    \ has higher energy efﬁciency than the ESPIN and\nSPIN algorithms in [96,97] by\
    \ 36.84% and 81.53%, respectively.\nThe data rate of RF transceivers can be adjusted\
    \ in the physical layer of a wireless protocol to\nreduce the power consumption\
    \ of the sensor node. Davis et al. [98] investigated the low battery\ncondition\
    \ of a sensor node to attain prolonged battery life for separate wireless sensor\
    \ nodes that\ncan preserve sampling suitability and reliability in communicating\
    \ accurate data. Different sensors,\nsuch as those for soil moisture, sap ﬂow,\
    \ and soil water, were examined to study the effect of sensing\ndebility due to\
    \ low battery voltage. The comparison of the data sampling rate of these sensors\
    \ shows\nthat sap ﬂow measurement is the best option for agricultural WSN. This\
    \ ﬁnding is attributed to the\nlow error obtained when the sampling interval increased\
    \ to 15 min while maintaining measurement\naccuracy. Table 4 shows the comparison\
    \ of power reduction technique based on data mitigation schemes\nfor previous\

    \ power reduction scheme for agriculture WSNs to minimize\nthe path between sensor\
    \ nodes and sink node, thereby the power consumption of the WSN is reduced.\n\
    Routing protocol can be performed via (i) sink mobility, (ii) multi-path routing,\
    \ (iii) cluster architecture,\nand (iv) routing metric.\nSink mobility was adopted\
    \ in previous research [99,100]. Mathur et al. [99] proposed a novel\nmechanism\
    \ that adopts unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to gather data from forest regions\
    \ instead\nof classical sensing from nodes deployed in WSN. The proposed method\
    \ enables the UAV to collect\ndata from WSN in harsh terrain and transmit it to\
    \ the base station situated far from the sensing area.\nTherefore, the multi-hop\
    \ transmission between cluster heads can be completely avoided, and the\ncommunication\
    \ range can be extended.\nMulti-path routing has also been suggested by other\
    \ scholars for agriculture WSNs [67,68,101].\nRecently, Nikolidakis et al. [67]\
    \ proposed an agricultural ﬁeld weather monitoring system based on\nthe ZigBee\
    \ wireless protocol. An advance energy-efﬁcient routing protocol was implemented\
    \ for WSN\nto automate irrigation management. The transmitter could modify its\
    \ power based on the distance\nbetween the sensor node and base station to save\
    \ energy. The results revealed that network lifetime\nincreased to 1825 min. Hedley\
    \ et al. [101] developed a WSN soil moisture mapping and monitoring\nmethod to\
    \ provide information for irrigation scheduling. To conserve power, the sensor\
    \ nodes relayed\ndata to the BS every 15 min through the greatest energy-efﬁcient\
    \ route.\nCluster head method is considered by Ndzi et al. [102] to extend the\
    \ ZigBee WSN lifetime for\nagricultural application.\nIn addition, the quality\
    \ of the crop yields is improved and their cost\nis minimized. The research presented\
    \ WSN coverage measurements in a mixed crop farmland.\nAn adaptive energy consumption\
    \ model for each sensor node was proposed and used to compute the\nenergy consumption\
    \ in the network. A deployment model with a cluster head and two antennas was\n\
    also proposed and simulated to alleviate short network lifetime due to the vegetation\
    \ attenuation of\nsignals. This network deployment model extended the lifetime\
    \ of the network by a factor of more than\n20 compared with a deployment where\
    \ cluster heads are not used. Nikolidakis et al. [103] proposed\na new routing\
    \ protocol for WSN that can reduce the power consumption of sensor nodes through\n\
    balanced clustering. This protocol was called “equalized cluster head election\
    \ routing protocol”\n(ECHERP). ECHERP was implemented in Java language for 500\
    \ homogeneous nodes distributed in a\n100 × 100 m2 land. The simulation results\
    \ showed that the proposed protocol outperforms existing\nprotocols in terms of\
    \ power consumption. A potential application of this protocol is PA.\nAnother\
    \ type of routing protocol is called routing metric. Chen et al. [104] used two\
    \ routing\nmetrics, namely, remained energy and expected transmission count, to\
    \ compute the optimal routing\npath to the sink node that ensures low power consumption.\
    \ “A scalable context-aware objective\nfunction (SCAOF)” is proposed by combining\
    \ robustness-aware, energy-aware, resource-aware, and\nreliability-aware contexts\
    \ that render to the compound routing metrics scheme. The experiment is\nconducted\
    \ in a garden based on a testbed, which includes a uIPv6 protocol stack and contiki\
    \ OS. The\nobtained results prove that SCAOF can convey the desired advantages\
    \ on network lifespan prolonging,\nas well as high efﬁciency and reliability in\
    \ different hardware testbeds and simulation scenarios.\nTable 5 shows the comparison\

    \ the power saving or battery lifetime,\ncommunication distance, and limitations\
    \ of WSNs in different agricultural applications in the work of\nseveral scholars\
    \ (Tables 2–6). The tables show that most previous studies used ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol\nfor different agricultural applications. The use of ZigBee supports\
    \ our assumption that this wireless\nprotocol is suitable for agricultural monitoring\
    \ systems as discussed in Section 2. A combination of two\nor more power reduction\
    \ schemes was also highlighted by several scholars [106–108] to further lower\n\
    the power consumption of the WSN. Table 6 shows the comparison of power reduction\
    \ technique\nbased on a combination of power reduction schemes for previous research\

    \ Techniques\nA major limitation of sensor nodes is their limited battery capacity.\
    \ Several energy-efﬁcient\nschemes have been introduced in previous research to\
    \ solve the power consumption problem of sensor\nnodes. An alternative method\
    \ that has been utilized to address the problem of limited node lifespan is\n\
    the use of energy-harvesting techniques. Numerous techniques have been developed\
    \ to allow sensor\nnodes to harvest different types of energy, such as solar,\
    \ wireless power transfer (WPT), mechanical\nvibration, kinetic, and wind energy,\
    \ from different environments [110] (Figure 2). Compared with\ntraditional sensor\
    \ nodes, rechargeable sensor nodes can work continuously for a long lifetime.\
    \ Ambient\nenergy can be converted to electrical energy and used directly to supply\
    \ the sensor nodes or can be\nstored and used later on. In agricultural applications,\
    \ energy harvesting can be used to prolong the\nlifetime of sensor nodes. Energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques for previous research works employed in\nprecision agriculture are\
    \ shown in Table 7. The said table lists the categories of energy-harvesting\n\
    techniques, types of wireless protocols, and output energy/power of energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques.\nIn addition, the form of agricultural applications, and limitations\
    \ of each article are also highlighted.\nEnergy-harvesting mechanisms can be implemented\
    \ with batteries for the sensor nodes. For\nexample, a sensor node using solar\
    \ energy to charge its batteries can work extensively during daytime\nwhen adequate\
    \ sunlight is available. Meanwhile, the sensor node can use its batteries through\
    \ power\nreduction techniques, such as sleep mode (i.e., duty cycle), at night\
    \ when sunlight is unavailable to save\nenergy. In addition, the sensor node can\
    \ enter restricted sleep periods (i.e., low duty cycle) and reduce\ntransmission\
    \ power when its batteries possess low residual energy [111]. Furthermore, adopting\
    \ a\nmaximum power point tracking system is a reliable battery charging technique\
    \ for long-term operation.\nThe charge–discharge cycle of the battery is minimized\
    \ [112].\n3.2.1. Solar Energy\nSolar energy based on photovoltaic system and methods\
    \ can be used in agricultural applications\nbased on WSNs [113]. Therefore, solar\
    \ cells provide a good solution [114] to ensure the survivability\nof the agriculture\
    \ monitoring system. Solar cell energy has been used by several studies to provide\n\
    long-term energy to sensor nodes in agriculture applications.\nGutiérrez et al.\
    \ [40] developed an irrigation system based on the ZigBee wireless protocol. The\n\
    system was developed to improve water usage for agricultural crops. Temperature\
    \ and soil moisture\nsensors in WSN were placed in the root of the plants to send\
    \ sensor information to a web application\nvia a gateway. The proposed algorithm\
    \ controls the water quantity based on threshold values of soil\nmoisture and\
    \ temperature that are programmed in a microcontroller-based gateway. The WSN\
    \ is\npowered by solar cell panels and rechargeable batteries. Water savings of\
    \ up to 90% were achieved\nrelative to the conventional irrigation method. Considering\
    \ that the system is cost effective and\nautonomous, it can be utilized in geographically\
    \ isolated regions where water sources are limited.\nZou et al. [68] improved\
    \ the battery lifetime of a WSN based on harvested energy (i.e., solar cell)\n\
    utilizing shadow detection. With this strategy, sensor nodes can accordingly modify\
    \ their scheduling\nto optimize their power production and remaining battery levels.\
    \ Furthermore, data transmission is\noptimized through routing and clustering\
    \ mechanisms. A Bayesian network was employed to provide\nwarning reports of bottlenecks\
    \ along the path. The system was deployed in real time based on the\nTexas Instruments\
    \ CC2530 platform that includes the ZigBee wireless protocol. The battery (lithium\n\
    type with a storage capacity of 2500 mAh) of the sensor node was charged from\
    \ the solar cell panel\nwhen the harvested power was adequate. The experimental\
    \ results showed that these techniques\nallow network activities to occur in a\
    \ continuous and effective manner.\nIn [115], a micro-irrigation system that relies\
    \ on a small solar-powered cell was developed. The\nenergy input, energy output,\
    \ greenhouse gas productions, and solar cell installation for rural areas\nwere\
    \ investigated with the proposed co-located system. The researchers compared their\
    \ system\nwith another commonly used method (i.e., aloe vera cultivation) in terms\
    \ of life cycle. The life cycle\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n23 of 45\nevaluation\
    \ showed that the proposed system is economical for several rural areas and may\
    \ provide\nopportunities for agriculture electriﬁcation and motivate economic\
    \ growth.\nRoblin [116] presented an irrigation system relying on a solar cell\
    \ for rural areas where sunlight is\noften available. The irrigation system includes\
    \ pumps working on a solar cell instead of an electricity\ngrid and/or a diesel\
    \ generator. The study showed that the irrigation system based on a solar cell\
    \ is\nbetter than systems that depend on other energy resources because the electricity\
    \ grid is unavailable at\nall times, and the operating cost of diesel pumps is\
    \ high and relies mainly on the diesel price. Although\nthe solar-powered system\
    \ was relatively expensive, it became a free source of energy after installation\n\
    in the rural area and proved to be a worthwhile investment in the long term. A\
    \ similar irrigation\nsystem was proposed in [117]. The system adopts photovoltaic\
    \ panels to power a water pump that\nconverts the continuous drift of water into\
    \ a drop drift to achieve increased water usage efﬁciency.\nKwon et al. [118]\
    \ suggested a novel prediction technique for energy harvesting with a solar\n\
    cell within three hours. Moreover, the packet transmissions of the sensor nodes\
    \ can be controlled\ndepending on the estimated energy. Packet transmissions and\
    \ energy harvesting are integrated to\nimprove the WSN performance. The integration\
    \ of these schemes enhances the prediction accuracy\nand improves the WSN throughput\
    \ and power consumption. The throughput of the sensor node can\nbe increased by\
    \ shortening the packet transmission period. By contrast, when the packet transmission\n\
    period increases, the power consumption of the sensor node decreases. The experimental\
    \ results show\nthat the proposed packet transmission scheme is superior to the\
    \ others in terms of data throughput\nand deadline miss rate. The proposed energy-harvesting\
    \ method is also predicted more precisely than\nothers by 6.92%.\nA study [119]\
    \ used a solar cell to provide energy to a WSN deployed in a greenhouse. The\n\
    humidity and temperature of the greenhouse were controlled through a management\
    \ and monitoring\nsystem, which was based on a low-power MSP430 (Texas Instruments,\
    \ Dallas, TX, USA) microcontroller\nand an ultra-low-power nRF24L01 transceiver\
    \ (Nordic Semiconductor, Oslo, Norway). The power\nconsumption of the WSN was\
    \ minimized as much as possible. In another study, a WSN-based ZigBee\n(CC2420\
    \ module) wireless transceiver and microcontroller (low-power ATmega128L) supplied\
    \ by\nthe solar cell as a battery charger were considered to monitor the humidity,\
    \ temperature, rain level,\nand leaf wetness of vineyards [120]. The WSN covered\
    \ 30 m between ZigBee units with a low power\nconsumption (35 and 38 mW in transmission\
    \ and reception modes, respectively).\n3.2.2. Wireless Power Transfer\nRecent\
    \ developments in wireless power transfer (WPT) are expected to increase the lifetime\n\
    of WSNs signiﬁcantly and make them continuously operational, given that WPT techniques\
    \ can\nbe utilized to transmit electromagnetic energy between transmitter and\
    \ receiver devices without\nany contact between the two. WPT is expected to overcome\
    \ the constraint of the supply of WSNs.\nConsequently, some researchers highlighted\
    \ the utilization of mobile node that can deliver power\nto deployed sensor nodes\
    \ such as [121,122].\nWPT technology poses a challenge to the energy\ncooperation\
    \ between neighboring nodes in WSNs. Therefore, in the future, sensor nodes could\n\
    harvest energy from the environment and transfer this energy to other nodes in\
    \ the network; in this\nmanner, a self-sustaining network can be achieved [123].\
    \ Accordingly, recent research has investigated\nmulti-hop energy transfer [124,125],\
    \ which paved the way for new energy cooperative schemes and\nWPT charging protocols.\n\
    WPT can be classiﬁed into three main subcategories:\n(i) electromagnetic (EM)\
    \ radiation,\n(ii) magnetic resonator coupling, and (iii) inductive coupling,\
    \ as shown in Figure 2. Wireless charging\nin WSNs can be performed via EM radiation\
    \ and magnetic resonant coupling. EM signals suffer from\nattenuation over distance,\
    \ and active radiation may pose a threat to the human body. Meanwhile,\nmagnetic\
    \ resonant coupling can address the power requirements of agriculture based on\
    \ WSNs because\nof its efﬁciency within a distance of several meters. Many studies\
    \ used WPT to charge sensor nodes\nfor different applications and ﬁelds. WPT-based\
    \ inductive coupling [121] has been used to charge\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n24\
    \ of 45\nthe battery of sensor nodes scattered in agriculture ﬁelds. The energy\
    \ is transferred from the source\ncoil (mounted on a UAV) to the receiver coil\
    \ (attached with sensor nodes). A 2.4 W transfer power\nis transferred to charge\
    \ a single sensor node. The results addressed a number of limitations and\nchallenges\
    \ related to the charging of sensor nodes via a UAV. In addition, the results\
    \ revealed that\nthe battery lifetime of the deployed sensors can be signiﬁcantly\
    \ extended through the UAV. A similar\napproach was adopted by Chen et al. [122]\
    \ to charge a WSN in an agricultural ﬁeld through the\nharvesting of electromagnetic\
    \ radiation.\n3.2.3. Air Flow Energy\nHarnessing wind energy is another energy-harvesting\
    \ technique that can be utilized to provide\npower to sensor nodes in agricultural\
    \ applications. An adaptive routing protocol, wind energy\nharvesting, and sleep\
    \ scheduling were considered in [126] to minimize the power consumption of the\n\
    ZigBee transceiver and extend the lifetime of the WSN.\n3.2.4. Vibration Energy\n\
    Vibration energy based on piezoelectric can be used to charge the battery of sensor\
    \ nodes to prolong\ntheir lifetime. Müller et al. [127] have been analyzed various\
    \ WSN protocols based on ZigBee (CC2420\nand CC2500) and CC1100 with respect to\
    \ their applicability in the agricultural setting. Furthermore,\na fully synchronous\
    \ protocol with a time-slot architecture for a WSN has been proposed for agricultural\n\
    machinery to achieve real-time capability, low latency, and deterministic behavior.\
    \ The objective of\ntheir application was to monitor the back door position and\
    \ ﬁlling level of a forage wagon using a\nZigBee (CC2420) RF transceiver. Clock\
    \ synchronization among all nodes is implemented to ensure\nstrict power on/sleep\
    \ times of each sensor node. Meanwhile, an energy-harvesting unit based on a\n\
    piezoelectric material has been designed; the unit provides an average power of\
    \ 200 µW to sensor\nnodes. In this case, the sensor node can transmit a data payload\
    \ of nine bytes in 40 ms.\n3.2.5. Water Flow Energy\nMulti-energy sources (water,\
    \ wind, and solar) platform is designed for precision agricultural\napplications\
    \ by Morais et al. [128]. The authors explored water ﬂow, wind speed and solar\
    \ radiation\nfeasible energy sources to encounter the requirements of ZigBee router\
    \ node in WSN. Thus, several\npowered solutions for WSN is presented. Design considerations\
    \ regarding water ﬂow energy, the water\nﬂow in the pipes of crops irrigation\
    \ system are employed to generate the energy for ZigBee router node.\nThis idea\
    \ can be applied in different agricultural applications such as greenhouses, aquaculture,\
    \ and\nhydroponic systems, where the water recirculation in pipes is continuous.\
    \ Like to bulky hydroelectric\ngeneration utilities, a water ﬂow in the pipes,\
    \ derived from the main water source, can be employed\nto run a turbine joined\
    \ to a small direct current (DC) generator. The experimental results revealed\n\
    that the three energy sources combined together can generate an energy of 58 mAh,\
    \ more than the\nrequirement of the ZigBee router node (39 mAh).\n3.2.6. Microbial\
    \ Fuel Cell Energy\nAnother type of energy harvesting technique is called microbial\
    \ fuel cell. This technique is extracted\nfrom energy neutral system. Sartori\
    \ and Brunelli [129] proposed microbial fuel cell to supply the\nunderground freshwater\
    \ system that used for monitoring the water level in the phreatic zone, artesian\n\
    wells, and tanks. The proposed system comprises a low-cost phreatimeter sensor,\
    \ a low-power\nmicrocontroller (i.e., MSP430FR5739), and a low-power LoRa wireless\
    \ protocol. However, the amount\nof microbial fuel cell energy extraction of 296\
    \ µW is not enough to supply LoRa wireless protocol and\nmicrocontroller directly\
    \ when they are in active mode. Therefore, a DC-to-DC boost is employed to\nraise\
    \ the small input voltages of 130 mV to 4.5 V.\nEvidently, most agricultural applications\
    \ prefer to use solar cells as battery chargers of WSNs\nbecause these cells are\
    \ easy to install, work efﬁciently when sunlight is available, and supply more\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n25 of 45\nenergy compared with other energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques as shown in Table 7. In addition, the table\nshows most of the previous\
    \ scholars adopted ZigBee wireless protocol. Clearly, employing ZigBee\nsupports\
    \ our study that this wireless protocol is more suitable for agricultural monitoring\
    \ systems.\nSolar panels can supply 100 mW/cm2, whereas radio frequency, thermal,\
    \ vibration, wind, microbial\nfuel cell, magnetic resonant coupling WPT, and water\
    \ ﬂow can supply 0.001, 0.06, 0.8, 1.0, 0.296, 14, and\n19 mWs, respectively [128–131].\
    \ For example, as shown in Figure 3 (Part A), if the power consumption\nof the\
    \ WSN components presented in [120] is 35 mW for ZigBee (Chipcon CC2420), 0.27\
    \ mW for\nthe temperature sensor, 3 mW for the humidity sensor, 0.27 mW for the\
    \ rain gauge sensor, 5 mW\nfor the leaf wetness sensor, and 24 mW for the ATmega128L\
    \ microcontroller [132], a single solar cell\n(2 × 2 cm2) panel can adequate supply\
    \ this WSN. However, when the power consumption of the WSN\nincreases, the dimension\
    \ of the solar cell panel also needs to be increased.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n\

    \ the visibility of a group of systems, technologies, platforms, and design \n\
    principles for joining things, depending on the physical surroundings, through\
    \ the use of the Internet. \nPA is an application that can employ the benefits\
    \ of IoT to increase production efficiency, improve \nthe quality of yields, reduce\
    \ the negative ecological impact, prevent the prevalence of plant-eating \npests\
    \ or plant diseases, alert farmers about farm fires [141], and increase the profitability\
    \ of several \nagricultural production schemes. Agriculture involves farming,\
    \ planting, and animal rearing, and it \nhas grown under the scope of IoT recently\
    \ [5]. Tracking of animals, monitoring of farms, and \nirrigation processes are\
    \ the main domains of IoT for cultivation [142]. Furthermore, feeding, rearing,\
    \ \nmedication, and vaccination are essential applications of IoT in the agricultural\
    \ domain [143]. \nConsequently, several IoT modular architectures have been proposed\
    \ and implemented by scholars \nfor PA monitoring (as presented in Table 8). Real-time\
    \ ecological information can be remotely \ngathered from the agricultural surroundings\
    \ based on different sensors, which transmit the \ninformation to be processed\
    \ to determine problems, take required actions using actuators, or store \ndata.\
    \ \nSensors in WSN can be employed to gather information about environmental and\
    \ physical \nfeatures, whereas actuators are used to respond to the feedback to\
    \ control or to perform an action \nover the conditions (Figure 3, Part B). The\
    \ use of sensors in agricultural applications poses a number \nof requirements,\
    \ including gathering of soil, weather, and crop information; surveillance of\
    \ \nagricultural areas, water and fertilizer requirements of diverse pieces of\
    \ rough land, several crops on \na single piece of acreage, different requirements\
    \ of crops for unlike soil and weather circumstances, \nand eliminating of interactive\
    \ solutions and relying on proactive solutions. All these requirements \nare applied\
    \ and processed in parallel. Therefore, different sensors and actuators must be\
    \ used to \nhandle this information and respond to different conditions. Processed\
    \ information can be utilized \nto make a decision instead of raw data of the\
    \ sensor [132]. This information can be transmuted to the \ncloud computing via\
    \ gateway for data processing and data storage, as shown in Figure 3 (Part C).\
    \ \nReference [144] proposed a modular architecture for a wireless sensor node\
    \ implemented for PA \napplications. The sensors employed in this modular were\
    \ soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and \nwind direction and speed sensors\
    \ to monitor the agricultural environments. “Adafruit Pro Trinket” \nplatform\
    \ was selected for the data processing, and nRF wireless protocol was used as\
    \ a transceiver \nto transfer sensor data to the gateway (i.e., Intel Edison to\
    \ reduce the power consumption). The \ngateway was in charge of collected information\
    \ from different sensors and passed the information to \nFigure 3. Example of\

    \ the data processing, and nRF wireless protocol was used as a transceiver to\n\
    transfer sensor data to the gateway (i.e., Intel Edison to reduce the power consumption).\
    \ The gateway\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n29 of 45\nwas in charge of collected information\
    \ from different sensors and passed the information to the cloud\nserver. The\
    \ proposed system resulted in improved crop quality and minimized negative ecological\n\
    effect. In [145], the usage of water in smart irrigation systems was controlled\
    \ based on developed IoT\nplatforms. A cloud agriculture ﬁeld-monitoring scheme\
    \ was designed and implemented to enable\nthe farmer to monitor the soil condition.\
    \ Soil moisture and weather temperature were monitored to\nautomate the irrigation\
    \ system in farm while minimizing water consumption, which led to reduced\ncost\
    \ and maintained environmental beneﬁts. The proposed water irrigation system included\
    \ three\nmain parts: a WSN and actuator, a cloud platform, and user application.\
    \ The WSN and actuator part\nconsisted of sensor nodes for collecting the soil\
    \ moisture and weather temperature, an actuator node\nto control the irrigation\
    \ process, and a sink node that could pass all farm information to the cloud\n\
    platform. All sensor, sink, and actuator nodes adopted low-power ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol.\nWSN and 3G network-based agriculture IoT was considered in [146]\
    \ to monitor the air\ntemperature, air humidity, and soil moisture. The entire\
    \ system consisted of sensor nodes, actuators\nsink nodes, server, gateway, and\
    \ the mobile phone device of the farmer. The collected information by\nthe sensor\
    \ nodes was sent to the server via gateway and Internet network. The gateway connected\
    \ the\nWSN with the Internet to relay the command control among the sensor nodes,\
    \ the phone of the farmer,\nthe actuators, and the server. However, in this system,\
    \ the data transmission over the 3G network\nmust ensure real-time communications\
    \ to support the agricultural WSN.\nIoT-based agriculture applications changed\
    \ classical agricultural surveillance approaches by\nspeedily providing quantitative\
    \ data with signiﬁcant temporal and spatial resolution. Several IoT\nplatforms\
    \ have recently been available in the market. For instance, in agricultural applications,\n\
    SmartFarmNet [147] platforms can be used to provide more than 30 packages for\
    \ good commercial\nproducts, such as Libelium [45], and experimental, such as\
    \ Motes [148] and Arduino [149] sensor\nplatforms. Other examples of agricultural\
    \ applications based on IoT are provided in Table 8. The table\npresents a comparative\
    \ analysis of several scholars in terms of sensors, actuators, IoT devices, and\
    \ IoT\nplatforms that can be used to support agricultural applications.\nSensors\

    \ of PA domain such as sensors, microcontrollers, and wireless technologies\n\
    are highlighted and classiﬁed in Table 9. For better clariﬁcation, the sensors\
    \ are classiﬁed into three\nmain categories leaf wetness/plant, soil moisture,\
    \ and environment sensors [5,132]. These sensors can\nbe utilized in several potential\
    \ agriculture applications. In Table 9, the microcontroller/processor and\nwireless\
    \ protocols are also highlighted. Among the microcontrollers, the majority of\
    \ agriculture sensor\nnodes adopting ATmega128L because this microcontroller supports\
    \ data aggregation, decision making,\nstorage capability, ﬂash memory, low complexity,\
    \ and energy management through multi-levels of\npower down modes [132]. ZigBee\
    \ and LoRa wireless protocols/technologies are widely used in several\nagricultural\
    \ applications, as discussed previously in Section 2.\nIn precision agriculture,\
    \ to obtain high-quality products, the environmental parameters should be\ncontrolled\
    \ to provide optimal values. For example, the temperature rate that has a positive\
    \ effect on the\ngrowth of the pepper ﬁeld is between 20 and 25 ◦C. The temperature\
    \ in rainy, sunny, and nightly days\nshould be kept between 20 and 22 ◦C, between\
    \ 25 and 28 ◦C, and between 18 and 20 ◦C, respectively\nand the minimum value\
    \ should be not lower than 16–17 ◦C. Air humidity for pepper vegetables should\n\
    be kept between 60% and 70%. The high-temperature value combines with low humidity\
    \ value may\nbe caused a negative inﬂuence on the growth of the pepper. The maximum\
    \ humidity value in pepper\ngreenhouse should be not above 70%. Soil pH (i.e.,\
    \ soil acidity) is another factor that directly effects\non the pepper crops,\
    \ where it can measure the quantity of calcium in the soil. The soil for pepper\n\
    crops can be acid or alkaline depending on the weather conditions. It should be\
    \ acid for wet climate\nand alkaline for a dry climate. Soil with pH levels above\
    \ 7.0 is considered alkaline, while soil with\npH levels below 7.0 has acid nature.\
    \ Soil pH values must be controlled according to the type of the\nagricultural\
    \ yield. For pepper crop, the best values for pH gauge are between 6.5 and 5.5.\
    \ Therefore,\nthe humidity, temperature, and soil pH should be constantly supervised\
    \ in order to identify the right\ntime for draining and watering the agricultural\
    \ crops.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n33 of 45\nTable 9. Types of sensors, microcontrollers,\

    \ Limitations\nThe development of WSNs prompted new research trends in the agricultural\
    \ domain. Micro\nelectromechanical system (MEMS) technologies allow for the manufacture\
    \ of cheap and small sensors.\nThe pervasive nature of the process, together with\
    \ tiny, self-regulating sensor nodes, cost-effective\nequipment, and scalability,\
    \ indicate that WSNs can be used for agriculture automation [5]. However,\nregarding\
    \ the distribution of WSNs to observe different agricultural climates, a number\
    \ of open\nchallenges and limitations remain. Several of these challenges and\
    \ limitations in existing agricultural\napplications based on WSNs are listed\
    \ below together with suggestions on how to address them.\n(1)\nPower consumption\
    \ and battery life:\nA WSN consists of three main components:\nsensors,\nmicrocontrollers,\
    \ and RF transceivers. Given that the battery of a sensor node provides limited\n\
    energy, ensuring that the components of the sensor node consume minimum power\
    \ is crucial.\nIn particular, reducing the power consumption of the RF transceiver,\
    \ which consumes more power\nthan the other components in a sensor node, would\
    \ alleviate this problem [67,127]. Moreover,\nthis issue can be addressed in two\
    \ steps. The ﬁrst is to propose an intelligent energy-efﬁcient\nalgorithm. The\
    \ second step can be performed by utilizing available energy-harvesting techniques,\n\
    such as solar cells, vibration, and WPT.\n(2)\nCommunication range: WSNs suffer\
    \ from the effect of harsh ecological conditions because of the\nwide range of\
    \ open agricultural surroundings [5]. The WSN protocol contains mechanisms to\n\
    resist the effect of data transmission failures in the network, which increase\
    \ due to ecological\neffects. In agricultural applications, most wireless sensor\
    \ technologies support a relatively short\ncommunication range. Therefore, many\
    \ sensor and router nodes need to be diffused in a WSN.\nIn the point-to-point\
    \ Zigbee network, the communication distance can reach 100 m in outdoor\nenvironments.\
    \ The ZigBee communication range can be extended by adopting multi-tire, ad-hoc,\n\
    decentralized, and mesh network topologies. Drones or UAV also can be used as\
    \ a mobile router\nnode to extend the communication range within a farm ﬁeld.\
    \ A drone could pass the collected\ndata from the sensor nodes to the master node\
    \ through multi-hop. However, using drones entails\nother challenges and limitations.\n\
    (3)\nPropagation losses:\nIn agricultural applications, WSNs must be able to work\
    \ in diverse\nsurroundings, such as ground, bare land, orchards, greenhouses,\
    \ farms, and complex topography;\nthey must also be able to operate in all climate\
    \ conditions. All these conditions inﬂuence the\nperformance of radio propagation.\
    \ Whether the topography is simple or complicated, the\ncommunication possibility\
    \ between the points in a WSN still suffers from serious challenges.\nThe signal\
    \ transmitted from the sensor nodes in agricultural applications need to pass\
    \ through a\nheavy crop canopy to arrive to at the receiver nodes, which cannot\
    \ ensure a sufﬁcient clearance\narea and will cause signal propagation absorption,\
    \ reﬂection, attenuation, and scattering. In\nthis case, the link quality is degraded,\
    \ especially when the signal spreads through dense crops.\nTherefore, when deploying\
    \ WSNs, communication link quality and temporal and spatial variables\nmust be\
    \ guaranteed. The communication performance of WSNs is related to the working\n\
    surroundings. Therefore, due to the limited resources and power budget of WSNs,\
    \ an accurate\nwireless channel path loss model must be adopted to reﬂect the\
    \ propagation features. This model\nis expected to demonstrate correct optimization\
    \ and network evaluation performance throughout\nthe deployment design process\
    \ to develop the energy efﬁciency of the nodes [15], improve the\ntarget detection\
    \ and localization applications [16], decrease the number of retransmission, and\n\
    ensure Quality of Service (QoS) of the network [175].\n(4)\nRouting: Different\
    \ problems can emerge due to packet collision and limited bandwidth, which\nare\
    \ introduced by channel propagation, and so on. Therefore, when a WSN is deployed\
    \ in a wide\narea in farm ﬁelds, multi-hop is required. Kim et al. [3] developed\
    \ an independent mobile robot\nplatform based on a mobility task for surveillance\
    \ to overcome channel interference.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n35 of 45\n(5)\nLocalization\
    \ and tracking: Tracking and localization of a herd of cattle are considered smart\
    \ farm\napplications based on WSNs. For example, a WSN can be employed to track\
    \ and localize of dairy\ncows to enable herd management. ZigBee wireless protocol\
    \ is used to monitor animal locations\nand behaviors, such as walking and standing,\
    \ lying down, and grazing [16,18]. In this context,\nseveral considerations, such\
    \ as radio interference, animal situation, and mobility, changes in\nWSN topology,\
    \ penetration depth of the signal through the animal body, height of the collar,\
    \ and\naccess point antennas, need to be taken into account [176]. These considerations\
    \ pose challenges\nin the localization and tracking of the animals.\n(6)\nReliability:\
    \ Agricultural monitoring systems based on different environmental sensors can\
    \ also\nbe used to monitor pollution aside from climate conditions. Important\
    \ information on climate\nconditions is reported to related agencies and farmers\
    \ from a remote location for advance\ninvestigations. Dangerous information needs\
    \ to be dealt with immediately in an emergency,\nwhich means that data transmission\
    \ in WSNs should demonstrate high reliability [3].\n(7)\nScalability: In agricultural\
    \ applications, the construction of WSN-based fault-tolerant and\nrobust hierarchical\
    \ architectures requires large-scale deployment relative to single-level network\n\
    architectures.\nA hierarchical architecture can be scaled up for developing applications\
    \ by\nduplicating to several ﬁelds. In this context, to increase the number of\
    \ WSNs over a vast area,\nmultiple wireless router nodes are placed in an agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld to guarantee sustained operation.\n(8)\nCost: The total hardware and software\
    \ costs of sensor nodes are important. The design of sensor\nnodes for any agricultural\
    \ application level must involve a low cost while demonstrating a robust\nperformance;\
    \ moreover, the design needs to be available for use by poor country markets [5].\n\
    This challenge can be overcome by reducing software and hardware costs further.\n\
    (9)\nReal time: Most crops are vulnerable to climate conditions, such as humidity,\
    \ intensity of\nillumination, and temperature. This vulnerability is a burden\
    \ to farmers who monitor changes\nin climate conditions hourly and/or daily because\
    \ doing so is labor-intensive. Moreover, in\ngreenhouses, a ﬁre can occur and\
    \ lead to severe agricultural disasters. This evidence suggests\nthat the monitoring\
    \ of the ecological conditions of agricultural WSNs needs to be in real time.\n\
    Real-time monitoring will enhance yield production and plant growth and avoid\
    \ dangerous\ndisasters in farms [3].\n(10) Storage and recording of data: Large\
    \ amounts of data are recorded from agriculture observing\nsystems because several\
    \ WSNs in agricultural applications contain several sensors for crop\ngrowth analysis\
    \ and harvesting estimation. This condition requires the base station to monitor\n\
    changes in farm ﬁelds by analyzing patterns. The base station must thus be supported\
    \ by a high\nstorage capacity.\n(11) Security: Security and protection are important\
    \ issues in agricultural products. Protection\nfrom insects or attacks of rodents\
    \ in grain stores or ﬁelds is essential. Such a challenge must\nbe considered\
    \ to maintain the security level of agriculture. Protection and security can be\n\
    achieved based on real-time analysis and processing of agricultural information\
    \ without human\nintrusion [159].\n(12) Delay tolerance: Critical delay poses\
    \ a challenge to agricultural applications. Some agricultural\napplications can\
    \ be considered as time sensitive, such as those used in farm ﬁre detection,\n\
    detection of exposure of crops to pests, cow heat event detection during milking,\
    \ and exposure of\ncattle to heat for a certain period. Such information must\
    \ be transmitted as fast as possible if the\ncritical issue is to be handled.\
    \ In such a case, a tradeoff between energy consumption and data\ntimelines is\
    \ necessary. By contrast, some agricultural applications are delay tolerant (i.e.,\
    \ time\ninsensitive), such as protein content, milk fat [177], gathering data\
    \ from soil and grass monitoring.\nWith delay tolerant approach, the short range\
    \ low power wireless protocols can be used [178].\nWhere the information of the\
    \ agricultural ﬁeld can be collected and transferred to the master\nnode or to\
    \ a cloud computing node using “messengers” e.g., a mobile node (mobile robot\
    \ or\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n36 of 45\nUAV). Consequently, the cost [179] and\
    \ the complexity of the agriculture WSN will be reduced\nand the lifetime will\
    \ be increased.\n(13) Fault tolerance: Fault tolerance is a crucial feature of\
    \ WSNs for succeeding PA. Several faults may\noccur in PA based on the WSN system,\
    \ which are (i) communication failure, (ii) faulty sensor\nsetting, (iii) sensor\
    \ component faults producing incorrect value, and (iv) node failure because of\n\
    exhausted battery or any other cause. Gutiérrez et al. [40] introduced communication\
    \ failure and\nnode fault tolerance for an irrigation system. If any fault occurs,\
    \ the irrigation system tracks the\ndefault irrigation program. The node energy\
    \ depletion failure was minimized in [1,40,180] by\nadopting solar-cell-powered\
    \ nodes. Data aggregation and topology control schemes are probable\nto be fault\
    \ tolerant for deploying sensor nodes in a vast area.\n(14) Data management: The\
    \ data management in agriculture poses a challenge because the large\namount of\
    \ data that can be collected from several sensors spread in agricultural ﬁeld,\
    \ especially\nwhen the agricultural data are intended to be connected to the cloud.\
    \ Determination of the\n(i) data analysis method, (ii) data collection schemes,\
    \ (iii) sensor types, (iv) semantic sensor\nnetworking, (v) big data, and (vi)\
    \ complex event processing enables the designer to manage\nthese crucial aspects.\
    \ The integration of IoT and software-deﬁned network also introduces a\npromising\
    \ and new methodology in deployment, monitoring, and design of network services\n\
    and resources [181].\n(15) Heterogeneous sensors: Integration of wired and wireless\
    \ heterogeneous sensors into information\nplatforms to perform interoperability\
    \ pose challenges in PA. Chen et al. [152] proposed “web\nservice-enabled cyber-physical\
    \ infrastructure” to solve this issue. The proposed system was able\nto integrate,\
    \ process, acquire, and distribute surveillance data from different physical sensors\n\
    spread in the PA system over the Internet. The infrastructure was executed to\
    \ serve as an\narchitecture middleware between PA clients and heterogeneous sensors.\n\
    6. Conclusions\nA review of WSN-based agricultural applications was presented.\
    \ A comparison was conducted\namong different wireless technologies or protocols,\
    \ such as WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, GPRS/3G/4G,\nLoRa, and SigFox. The comparison\
    \ results revealed that the ZigBee and LoRa wireless protocols are\nmore convenient\
    \ for agricultural applications than the others because of its low power consumption\n\
    and suitable communication range for ZigBee and long for LoRa. A classiﬁcation\
    \ of energy-efﬁcient\ntechniques or algorithms and energy-harvesting techniques\
    \ was also provided. Based on the presented\ntaxonomy, we show that signiﬁcant\
    \ types of energy-efﬁcient and energy-harvesting techniques\ncan be used in the\
    \ agriculture domain. Previous research was also investigated and compared\nto\
    \ explore the current problems in agricultural applications based on WSNs and\
    \ obtain optimum\nsolutions for maintaining system performance. Challenges and\
    \ limitations were introduced for\ndesign considerations in the future. The state-of-the-art\
    \ approaches of IoT in agricultural applications\nwere reviewed and compared to\
    \ explore various sensors, actuators, devices, IoT platforms, and\napplication\
    \ layers.\nAcknowledgments: The authors would like to thank Al-Raﬁdain University\

  analysis: '1. Soil Moisture Content. Artificial intelligence has the potential to
    revolutionize the agriculture industry, including the management of soil moisture.
    ML algorithms can be used to predict soil moisture content, which can help farmers
    make informed decisions about when and how to water their crops. This can lead
    to increased crop yields and reduced water usage.


    2. Pest and weed detection. Computer vision and ML algorithms can be used to detect
    pests and weeds in crops. This can help farmers identify and treat problems early
    on, which can reduce crop damage and increase yields.


    3. Disease detection. ML algorithms can be used to detect diseases in crops. This
    can help farmers identify and treat diseases early on, which can reduce crop damage
    and increase yields.


    4. Crop yield prediction. ML algorithms can be used to predict crop yields. This
    can help farmers make informed decisions about how much to plant and when to harvest,
    which can lead to increased profits.


    5. Irrigation management. ML algorithms can be used to manage irrigation systems.
    This can help farmers optimize water usage and reduce costs.


    Below you will find more specific examples:


    The authors of [17] used an extreme learning machine (ELM) based regression model
    to predict soil surface humidity. The authors selected two terrains having area
    4 KM2 and 16 KM2 located in Dicle university campus for experimental analysis.
    The real-time field data was extracted using polarimetric Radarsat-2 data, which
    was pre-processed using the SNAP toolbox [18] and features were added with the
    help of local measurements by separating the field into square grids. Once the
    pre-processing and feature extraction is done the data is passed to ELM based
    regression model to predict the soil surface humidity. The algorithm was tested
    with 5 different kernel functions and the prediction was validated using leave-one-out
    cross-validation technique. The experimental results confirmed the lowest root
    mean square error (RMSE) of 2.19% when using ‘sine’ kernel function.


    The authors of [86] explored robust deep learning models Inception-v3 and ResNet-50
    for weed species identification and classification from a dataset of images collected
    in Australian rangeland. Simulation results show that the average classification
    performance of both the models is 95.1% and 95.7%. These results found fruitful
    for automatic real-time robotic weed control in the agricultural field.


    Machine learning algorithms like those presented in this paper can help to improve
    the efficiency and effectiveness of precision agriculture. By using machine learning,
    farmers can make better decisions about how to manage their crops and resources,
    which can lead to increased yields and profits.'

    Keywords Metrics Abstract: Agriculture plays a vital role in the economic growth
    of any country. With the increase of population, frequent changes in climatic
    conditions and limited resources, it becomes a challenging task to fulfil the
    food requirement of the present population. Precision agriculture also known as
    smart farming have emerged as an innovative tool to address current challenges
    in agricultural sustainability. The mechanism that drives this cutting edge technology
    is machine learning (ML). It gives the machine ability to learn without being
    explicitly programmed. ML together with IoT (Internet of Things) enabled farm
    machinery are key components of the next agriculture revolution. In this article,
    authors present a systematic review of ML applications in the field of agriculture.
    The areas that are focused are prediction of soil parameters such as organic carbon
    and moisture content, crop yield prediction, disease and weed detection in crops
    and species detection. ML with computer vision are reviewed for the classification
    of a different set of crop images in order to monitor the crop quality and yield
    assessment. This approach can be integrated for enhanced livestock production
    by predicting fertility patterns, diagnosing eating disorders, cattle behaviour
    based on ML models using data collected by collar sensors, etc. Intelligent irrigation
    which includes drip irrigation and intelligent harvesting techniques are also
    reviewed that reduces human labour to a great extent. This article demonstrates
    how knowledge-based agriculture can improve the sustainable productivity and quality
    of the product. A graphical abstract for Machine Learning Applications for Precision

    Bluetooth Low Energy SECTION I. Introduction The population of the world will
    increase to 9.1 billion approximately thirty-four percent as of today by the end
    of 2050. Food requirement will increase by 70 percent and due to rapid urbanization,
    land availability for agriculture will decrease drastically in the coming years.
    India will be the most populated country by 2050 and presently it is already lagging
    the domestic food production. The main reason for reduced food production is the
    lack of planning, unpredictable weather conditions, improper harvesting and irrigation
    techniques and livestock mismanagement. In the last few years, nature has experienced
    a drastic change in weather conditions due to global warming. The average temperature
    of the earth has been increased due to which there is uncertainty in climatic
    conditions. Frequent droughts, heavy rainfall are the biggest challenge for poor
    farmers. According to the government of India annual economic survey, adverse
    climatic conditions, reduce the farmer’s income by 20-25%. Precision agriculture
    [1], [2] is one of the solutions to ensure food security for the entire world
    [3]. Precision agriculture also abbreviated as digital agriculture is a technology-enabled
    data-driven sustainable farm management system. It is basically the adoption of
    modern information technologies, software tools, and smart embedded devices for
    decision support in agriculture [4] as shown in figure 1. Mechanized agriculture
    and the green revolution are the two key components of the first and second agriculture
    revolution. Precision farming is an important part of the third agriculture revolution
    [5]. FIGURE 1. Precision agriculture. Show All John Deere introduced this technology
    in 1990 for the sowing of seeds and spraying of fertilizers using global positioning
    system (GPS) controlled tractors. The main focus of precision farming is to reduce
    the production cost and environmental effects to increase the farm’s profitability.
    Digital technologies such as IoT [6], AI, data analytics, cloud computing, and
    block-chain technology play a key role in precision agriculture. In precision
    farming, IoT based smart sensors are deployed in the agriculture land for collecting
    data related to soil nutrients, fertilizers, and water requirements as well as
    for analysing the crop growth. Autonomous and semi-autonomous devices such as
    an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) [7] and robots are used for identifying weed
    and disease in the plants using computer vision techniques. Satellite images are
    also used in precision agriculture for monitoring the field and identifying the
    diseases in the plants. The data obtained from the deployed sensors [8] are processed
    and analyzed using ML algorithms to make farming practice more controlled and
    optimized. ML algorithms are also used for weather and rainfall prediction based
    on the data obtained from sensors, climatic records, and satellite images. This
    could save the lives of thousands of farmers who commit suicide because of crop
    loss due to uncertainty in weather conditions. Smart livestock management is an
    important component of precision agriculture. It helps in monitoring the health,
    welfare, productivity, and reproduction of animals throughout their life cycle.
    Sensors and cameras monitor animal’s health and computer vision techniques help
    in making intelligent decisions such as stopping the communal spread of diseases.
    Autonomous tractors and automated irrigation systems provide modern farming solutions
    to farmers. The widespread utilization of precision farming across the world is
    due to the presence of innovative machine and deep learning (DL) algorithms, high-speed
    internet access, and efficient computational devices. In [10] authors have discussed
    applications of ML for sustainable agriculture supply chain (ASC) performance.
    Authors have presented a unique ML-ASC framework that can guide researchers and
    agriculture practitioners to understand the role and importance of digital technologies
    in the agriculture industry. In [11] authors reviewed different ML applications
    in agriculture and discussed how digital technologies will benefit the agriculture
    industry. In this paper, the authors have presented a comprehensive review of
    the ML application for precision agriculture. This review article will provide
    an insight into the research community about the adoption of digital practices
    in the agriculture management system. It is anticipated that government agencies
    will frame policies to promote precision farming across the world. The main contribution
    of the article is outlined as follows: Applications of artificial intelligence
    and IoT in precision agriculture are discussed along with their practical implications.

    II. Impact of Artificial Intelligence and IoT in Agriculture The term AI was first
    coined in the Dartmouth conference in the year 1956 by John McCarthy and he defined
    it as a science and engineering of making intelligent machines or more specifically
    intelligent computer programs. AI technology provides computational intelligence
    to machines so that they can learn, understand and react according to the situation.
    ML, DL, natural language processing (NLP), swarm intelligence (SI), expert systems,
    fuzzy logic, and computer vision are the subfields of AI as shown in figure 2.
    This field finds endless applications across different sectors of human life.
    Intelligent AI programs are widely explored in health-care, agriculture, finance,
    robotics, e-commerce and the automation industry. Samsung, Apple, and other electronics
    giant companies announced that they will be utilizing this technology in every
    device they will manufacture in the near future. IoT is another emerging technology
    in which smart sensors, devices are interconnected through the internet. These
    smart sensors can be utilized to gather data across different disciplines such
    as solar plants, agriculture fields, disaster-prone areas, manufacturing industry
    for efficient resource utilization. With the increase in population over the year’s
    demand for agriculture products is increasing day by day. However, with limited
    land availability for farming and reduce interest among the young generation to
    adopt farming as their profession, it has become a challenging task for the agriculture
    industry to satisfy the food requirement of millions of people. Now, the agriculture
    industry is widely adopting smart technologies like IoT and AI to efficiently
    cultivate organic products in limited land areas as well as to overcome the traditional
    challenges of farmers. FIGURE 2. Artificial intelligence techniques. Show All
    IoT based smart farming system is built for monitoring soil nutrients and soil
    moisture using sensors. ML algorithms are explored for determining the optimum
    amount of fertilizers required for soils before the sowing of crops. Drones are
    revolutionizing the agriculture industry. These drones are cameras enabled and
    are used for different applications such as field and crop monitoring, spraying
    of pesticides, and drip irrigation. The images captured by the drones over the
    entire lifecycle of crops can be examined using DL and computer vision algorithms
    for disease and weed identification. Thereafter, these drones are used for spraying
    pesticides over the weeds and infected crops. Over the years uncertainty in weather
    conditions is the main concern of farmers. Drip irrigation using drones is an
    efficient AI-empowered irrigation system which is basically trained on weather
    pattern and can effectively reduce the water problems of farmers. AI-enabled robots
    can be used for harvesting the crops at a much faster pace and in large volumes.
    Robots can reduce human labour to a large extent and can be used along with drones
    for monitoring the field. Livestock management is another major concern for farmers.
    IoT based sensors can be deployed in the field for health monitoring of cattle.
    This information can be utilized for protecting the bunch of cattle from diseased
    cattle. NLP based virtual assistant applications like chatbots can update the
    farmers with the latest advancement in technologies for agriculture. Farmers can
    finds solutions for their problems and incorporate the latest technology in their
    farming for improving their field productivity. Thus, AI and IoT are the two major
    technologies that will play a vital role in the agriculture industry. SECTION
    III. Machine Learning Algorithms ML is the subfield of computer science that gives
    computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. (Arthur Samuel,
    1959) [12]. Alan Turing in the year 1950 proposed the concept of learning machines
    and wrote a research article “The Turing Test for Machine Intelligence” [13].
    He performed a test and examined the machine’s ability to demonstrate intelligent
    behaviour similar to humans. A machine or intelligent computer program learns
    and extract knowledge from the data, builds a framework for making predictions
    or intelligent decisions. Thus, the ML process is divided into three key parts,
    i.e. data input, model building, and generalization as shown in figure 3. Generalization
    is the process for predicting the output for the inputs with which the algorithm
    has not been trained before. ML algorithms are mainly used to solve complex problems
    where human expertise fails such as weather prediction, spam filtering, disease
    identification in plants, pattern recognition. FIGURE 3. A Machine learning process.
    Show All Today, due to the availability of innovative algorithms and large data
    sets through internet resources industries and research communities are widely
    using ML algorithms for solving a diverse set of problems. DL is the subfield
    of the family of ML algorithms which is trained from large sets and uses an artificial
    neural network (ANN) to make intelligent decisions. ML algorithms are categorized
    as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning as shown
    in figure 4. Supervised learning as the name suggests is learning with the supervisor
    or teacher. This set of algorithms works with labeled data-set which means corresponding
    to each input there are outputs. The algorithm builds an input-output relationship
    with this labeled data set and thereafter generalize or predicts outputs for unseen
    inputs. Supervised learning algorithms used for predicting the categorical value
    are known as classification algorithms and the algorithms that are used for predicting
    the numerical value are known as regression algorithms. Unsupervised learning
    algorithms works with unlabelled data and discovers unknown objects by grouping
    similar objects. The goal of an unsupervised learning algorithm is to extract
    hidden knowledge from the training data set thus this approach is difficult to
    implement than supervised learning algorithms. Reinforcement learning is another
    approach that learns from the environment through reward and punishment. AlphaGo,
    a chess-playing game developed by DeepMind utilized reinforcement learning for
    defeating the world’s best chess-playing computer program. FIGURE 4. Categorization
    of machine learning algorithms. Show All In this paper the performance of different
    ML algorithms are analysed and discussed in the field of agriculture. Table 2
    presents different types of supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning
    algorithms utilized for soil and weather prediction, disease and weed identification,
    intelligent irrigation and harvesting techniques as well as livestock management.
    TABLE 2 Machine Learning Algorithms SECTION IV. Machine Learning Applications
    in Precision Agriculture In many countries, the farmers rely on the traditional
    ways of farming which is based on the reliability of the suggestions from the
    elderly and their experience. This method leaves farmers at the mercy of random
    climatic conditions which are already getting random due to global warming and
    uneven rainfall patterns. The manual spraying method for pesticides led to improper
    usage of resources and harms the environment. AI and IoT enabled precision agriculture
    removes the randomness and assist new age farmer to optimize every step of the
    farming process. Figure 5 (a) and (b) presents a pictorial view of traditional
    agriculture and technology enabled farm management system. FIGURE 5. (a) Traditional
    agriculture cycle (b) Precision agriculture cycle. Show All Gaitán [14] provided
    a systematic study of the impact of extreme weather events, such as hail events,
    cold waves, heat waves, and their impact on agricultural practices. The author
    reported floods, droughts, frost, hail, heatwaves, and pest outbreaks are impacted
    by climatic conditions. The AI systems are applicable in each farming operation
    as depicted in figure 4 and some of them even extend beyond the conventionally
    recognized steps. In this section we will discuss the state of art techniques
    proposed/implemented by various researchers and practitioners worldwide. A. Soil
    Properties and Weather Prediction Prediction of soil properties is the first and
    the most crucial step which influences the selection of crop, land preparation,
    selection of seed, crop yield, and selection of fertilizers /manure. The soil
    properties are directly related to the geographic and climatic conditions of the
    land in use and hence is an important factor to take into consideration. The soil
    properties prediction mostly consists of predicting nutrients in the soil, soil
    surface humidity, weather conditions during the lifecycle of the crop. Human activities
    have highly affected the properties of soil and hence our ability to cultivate
    the crops [15]. In general, there are 17 essential elements as listed in table
    3 which play an important role in plant growth [16]. The growth of crops depends
    on the nutrients available in a particular soil. The soil nutrients are mostly
    monitored by electric and electromagnetic sensors [8]. Depending on the nutrients
    farmers make informed decisions as to which crop is optimal for the land. However,
    the nutrients can be added through fertilizers, manure, etc. but with an additional
    cost. Some of them may also damage the environment and have an adverse effect
    on the soil cycle. TABLE 3 Essential Plant Nutrients [2] A scientific analysis
    of soil nutrients, soil moisture, pH is important for determining the soil properties.
    Acar et al. [17] employed an extreme learning machine (ELM) based regression model
    for prediction of soil surface humidity. The author selected two terrains having
    area 4 KM2 and 16 KM2 located in Dicle university campus for experimental analysis.
    The real-time field data was extracted using polarimetric Radarsat-2 data, which
    was pre-processed using the SNAP toolbox [18] and features were added with the
    help of local measurements by separating the field into square grids. Once the
    pre-processing and feature extraction is done the data is passed to ELM based
    regression model to predict the soil surface humidity. The algorithm was tested
    with 5 different kernel functions and the prediction was validated using leave-one-out
    cross-validation technique. The experimental results confirmed the lowest root
    mean square error (RMSE) of 2.19% when using ‘sine’ kernel function. Wang et al.
    [19] deployed soft sensors based on ELM for the measurement of nutrient solution
    composition in the soilless cultivation method. The soilless cultivation method
    is an emerging planting method. It is imperative to monitor the pH value, temperature
    and concentration changes in nutrient solution composition as the performance
    of soilless cultivation is highly dependent on these parameters. The significant
    variables in a nutrient solution cannot be measured directly hence these are determined
    with the help of auxiliary variables. The authors utilized conductivity, pH value,
    flow rate, and temperature measurements for auxiliary measurements. These auxiliary
    measurements are fed to a deep belief network-based ELM which predicts the values
    of significant variables. For experimental analysis, the authors deployed the
    model to measure the concentration of SO 2− 4 , and H 2 PO − 4 in a nutrient solution.
    The authors reported an average RMSE of 1.2414 for predictions in SO 2− 4 and
    RMSE of 0.8892 for prediction of H 2 PO − 4 . Park et al. [20] utilized ML algorithms
    to predict the soil moisture using data from MODIS. The authors downscaled the
    AMSR2 soil moisture to 1KM using random forest (RF) and Cubist algorithms. An
    ensemble of these algorithms was used to obtain soil moisture data. The results
    obtained through the ML methods were compared with the statistical ordinary least
    squares technique. The ML model exhibited a R 2 (coefficient of determination)
    of 0.96 and an RMSE of 0.06, whereas a R 2 of 0.47 and a RMSE of 0.16 was associated
    with the statistical ordinary least squares. Reda et al. [21] explored ML algorithms
    to estimate soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) in soil samples
    collected from four agricultural lands of Moroccan. Data set of near-infrared
    spectroscopy is utilized in comparison to traditional chemical methods as this
    technique reduces the computation time and resource utilization. The ensemble
    learning modeling algorithm presents the best performance among other regression
    models and back-propagation neural networks (BPNN) algorithm. The proposed algorithm
    presents R 2 of 0.96, RMSE of 1.92, performance to deviation (RPD) of 4.87 for
    SOC and R 2 of 0.94 and RMSE of 0.57, RPD of 4.91 for TN prediction. Morellos
    et al. [22] also utilized visible and infrared spectroscopy to determine TN, SOC,
    and moisture content (MC) in the arable field in Premslin Germany. Spectroscopy
    dataset is used for building the predictive ML model for estimating all three
    soil properties. Least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) and cubist ML algorithms
    outperform principal component regression and partial least square regression
    multivariate methods in terms of RMSE and residual prediction deviation (RPD).
    LS-SVM best predict SOC and MC with RMSE of 0.062 and 0.457, RPD of 2.24, and
    2.20. Cubist best predicts for TN with RMSE of 0.071 and RPD of 1.96. Andrade
    et al. [23] build ordinary least square regression, RF, cubist regression, XGboost
    prediction model for determining soil properties from portable X-ray fluorescence
    (pXRF) spectrometry dataset in Brazilian coastal plains. Three soil properties
    total nitrogen, soil organic matter (SOM), cation exchange capacity (CEC) were
    analyzed using RF, ordinary least squares regression (OLS), cubist regression
    (CR), XGBoost (XGB). RF algorithm gives the best performance with R 2 of 0.50
    for TN, R 2  0.75 for CEC and 0.56 for SOM. Deiss et al. [24] estimated the soil
    properties (clay, sand, pH, SOC) in northern Tanzania and USA Midwest from the
    spectroscopy dataset using ML algorithms. THE tuned SVM model outperforms the
    partial least square (PLS) regression model in terms of predicting all the soil
    parameters. Mahmoudzadeh et al. [25] explored the ML algorithm to predict SOC
    in the Kurdistan province of Iran. The simulation results suggest that RF accurately
    predicts SOC with R 2 of 0.60 and RMSE of 0.35% in comparison to SVM, kNN, Cubist,
    and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) ML algorithm. The study also suggests
    that air temperature, annual rainfall, valley depth, texture of terrain surface
    are some of the important factors that influence SOC spread over the Kurdistan
    region. Veres et al. [26] explored DL architecture such as CNN for predicting
    the soil properties from the infra-red spectroscopy dataset. Benke et al. [27]
    predict soil electrical conductivity (EC) and SOC in different regional locations
    of Victoria, Australia using pedotransfer function (PTF) based on ML algorithm.
    PTF basically converts soil measurement into soil properties and provides inputs
    for ML simulation algorithms. In the proposed approach PTF use Generalised Linear
    Mixed Effects Model (GLMM) model and Residual Maximum Likelihood (REML) to predict‘
    the soil properties. Traditional approaches to soil properties and crop yield
    prediction require time-consuming field surveys and the deployment of expensive
    sensors. Khanal et al. [28] proposed an alternative approach in which the dataset
    for the prediction of soil properties and crop yield is generated using remotely
    sensed aerial images of agricultural land. Five soil properties, viz. pH value,
    magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), SOM, CEC, and crop yield were predicted using RF,
    SVM, Cubist, NN, Gradient Boosting Model (GBM) ML algorithms. NN presents the
    highest prediction accuracy for SOM having R 2 of 0.64, RMSE of 0.44 and CEC having
    R 2 of 0.67, RMSE of 2.35; SVM best predicts K having R 2 of 0.21, RMSE of 0.49
    and Mg having R 2 of 0.22, RMSE of 4.57; and GBM best predicts pH having R 2 of
    0.15, RMSE of 0.62. RF outperforms other algorithms in terms of crop yield prediction
    and presents higher accuracy having R 2 of 0.53 and RMSE of 0.97. Labrador et
    al. [29] estimate calcium and Mg content in soil using generalized regression
    NN and genetic algorithm (GA). The digital elevation model and satellite images
    were used as input to the prediction model for estimating the soil properties.
    Chlingaryan et al. [30] discussed different ML approaches used in precision agriculture
    for accurate crop yield prediction and soil nitrogen estimation over the last
    fifteen years. Ju-Young et al. [31] investigated a seasonal climatic forecasting
    model using regularized ELM to predict day-wise mean air temperature at field
    level for a period of 90 days. The authors selected data from Korea Metrological
    Administration using the Met GloSea5GC2 model [32]. The authors fed 240 days of
    forecast data and hindcast data from the ensemble based model to the RELM algorithm.
    The algorithm performance was evaluated by measuring: RMSE, mean absolute error
    (MAE) the model prediction vs the actual values. The authors achieved an RMSE
    in the range of 1.02 to 3.35 which outperformed the meteorological data which
    has an RMSE range of 1.61 to 3.37. Soil moisture content is an important parameter
    to acknowledge in the agriculture industry as it addresses precise irrigation
    scheduling. Stamenkovic et al. [33] build a support vector regression (SVR) prediction
    model to predict soil moisture content from remotely sensed hyperspectral images.
    Song et al. [34] proposed a macroscopic cellular automata (MCA) model and combined
    its deep belief network (DBN) to predict soil moisture content over a cornfield
    in northwest china. The simulation results of DBN-MCA outperforms the multi-layer
    perceptron (MLP)-MCA in terms of RMSE. Acheing [35] explored the SVR model (i.e.
    RBF), ANN, DNN for simulating soil water retention curve (SWRC) curve of loamy
    sand. Dataset of loamy sand subjected to wetting and drying condition is collected
    using a reflectometer and tensiometer. RBF based SVR model best predicts SWRC
    under both wet and dry conditions. Feng et al. [36] estimate soil temperature
    at various soil depths of Loess Plateau of China. Four different ML algorithms
    ELM, generalized regression neural networks (GRNN), backpropagation neural networks
    (BPNN), and RF were investigated for predicting the soil temperature. ML algorithms
    were trained with air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and vapour pressure
    and solar radiation as input parameters and the simulations show that ELM outperforms
    other ML algorithms in terms of RMSE, MAE, Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient (NS) and
    concordance correlation coefficient. Mohammadi et al. [37] explored ELM for predicting
    daily dew point temperature in different parts of Iran. This part of the world
    experience different climatic conditions throughout the year. The proposed model
    accurately predicts dew point temperature than SVM and ANN algorithms. Zhu et
    al. [38] accurately predict daily evapotranspiration in Northwest China using
    hybrid particle swarm optimization (PSO)-ELM model to optimize crop water requirement
    in agriculture. Alizamir et al. [39] accurately predicts soil temperature at different
    depths of 5, 10, 50 and 100 cm using ELM, ANN, classification and regression trees,
    group method of data handling using dataset obtained from Mersin station operated
    by Turkish Meteorological Service. The simulation results suggest that soil temperature
    can be estimated easily using air temperature upto depth of 50 cm while for depth
    of 100 cm additional information of solar radiation and wind speed is required.
    Rainfall prediction plays a critical role in the water resource management system,
    flood risk assessment, and the agriculture industry. Acknowledging the chaotic
    nature of rainfall, it is very difficult for statistical approaches to accurately
    predict the rainfall. Cramer et al. [40] evaluated the performance of seven ML
    algorithms for rainfall prediction. The statistical results show that the radial-basis
    function neural network (RBFNN) shows the best performance among other state of
    the art algorithms. Sierra and Jesus [41] predicted the rainfall in Tenerife,
    an island in Spain based on atmospheric synoptic patterns using different ML algorithms
    and found NN gave the best performance among other ML algorithms. Kamatchi and
    Parvathi [42] employed NN for weather prediction and proposed a hybrid recommender
    system for enhancing the success ratio of the system. Lazri et al. [43] build
    a multi-classifier model for estimating precipitation using MSG images (Meteosat
    second generation) and dataset obtained using radar. The proposed approach shows
    that the proposed multi-classifier improves the standard of classification. Shardoor
    and Rao [44] surveyed three different approaches i.e. ML techniques, data mining
    techniques, and satellite forecasting techniques for rainfall prediction. Table
    4 presents a comparative study of different ML algorithms for prediction of soil
    properties and weather prediction. TABLE 4 Different ML Algorithms for Prediction
    of Soil Properties and Weather Conditions B. Crop Yield Prediction A significant
    piece of information for any farmer is the prediction of crop yield and how the
    yield can be increased. pH value, soil type, and quality, weather pattern: temperature,
    rainfall, humidity, sunshine hours, fertilizers, and harvesting schedules are
    some of the parameters which play an important role in predicting the crop yield
    [45]. Scientifically manual farming can be considered as a feedback control system
    in which the corrective action is taken once a setback in a crop is observed.
    The crop yield will highly depend on the efficiency of the optimal utilization
    of the above-mentioned resources. If some kind of anomaly goes undetected in the
    initial stage may harm the crop yield in an unprecedented way. Singh et al. [46]
    assessed hailstorms on India’s wheat production and observes that in February
    and March 2015 alone the hailstorm events caused a decline of 8.4% in national
    wheat production. For financially weak farmers in a country such as India, where
    intermittent storage of harvested crops is a rare resource, accurate weather predictions
    may turn to be miraculous for farmers. ML models when systematically applied to
    a system act as feedforward control. With the help of accurate ML models, we can
    anticipate the factors which are going to affect the crop yield. Hence the corrective
    action can be taken before even an anomaly hits the crop production. Kamir et
    al. [47] used ML models to identify the yield gap hotspots in wheat production.
    Authors generated very high-resolution yield maps using data from various sources
    between 2009 and 2015. The data was collected from various sources:(a) NDVI time-series
    data across Australia using the MOD13Q1 data set [48], (b) rainfall and temperature
    data were collected from historic climate data at Australia bureau of metrology,
    (c) maps for observed grain yield were collected at source using intelligent harvesting
    machines. The dataset generated were tested with 9 ML algorithms: RF, XGBoost,
    Cubist, MLP, SVR, Gaussian Process, k-NN, and Multivariate Adaptive Regression
    Splines. The authors combined predictions from each of the algorithms into ensembles
    for prediction optimization [49]. Out of these algorithms, SVR with RBFNN outperformed
    other algorithms and investigators were able to achieve the yield estimate with
    an R 2  of 0.77 and an RMSE value of 0.55t ha −1 . The results were validated
    using 10-fold cross-validation techniques applied to the full data set. Aghighi
    et al. [50] used various advanced regression algorithms to predict the yield of
    silage maize crops. The authors selected maize fields located at Moghan Agro-Industrial
    and Animal Husbandry Company (MAIAHC), which is about 28,000 hectares’ area and
    located in Iran. The crop yield dataset was collected for around 40 silage maize
    fields were collected for a period from 2013-2015. In addition to it, the historic
    crop yield data the authors also gathered time-series NDVI data from Landsat 8
    OLI satellite. The data was fed to advanced regression algorithms: (a) Gaussian
    Process Regression, (b) SVR, (c) Boosted Regression tree (d) RF Regression models
    and the prediction form each of the regression models were compared and evaluated.
    Authors found out the boosted regression tree reported best evaluation parameters
    with an average R-value of higher than 0.87, and RMSE in a range of 8.5 to 11.10,
    with a mean value of 9.5 during the period 2013-14. Kuwata and Shibasaki [51]
    employed DL models to estimate the crop yield. Authors deployed SVR for predicting
    the yield of corn in Illinois. For input following dataset was employed by the
    authors: (a) 5 year moving average of corn crop yield, (b) The enhanced vegetation
    index is obtained using the MOD09A1 dataset MODIS satellite, and (c) Historic
    climatic data. The dataset was fed to support the vector regression model and
    the authors reported an RMSE of 8.204 and a correlation coefficient of 0.644 for
    the model. For result, validation authors conducted 10-fold cross-validation on
    the full data set. Kulkarni et al. [52] utilized DL models to predict rice crop
    yield. The authors utilized soil properties and nutrients measurements recorded
    over 31 years and historic rainfall data. The input data was fed to recurrent
    neural network models for crop yield prediction. For effective prediction the
    authors explored different activation functions viz. sigmoid, reLu, and linear
    in the neural network. Chu and Yu [53] builds an end to end summer and winter
    rice prediction model in 81 counties in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,
    China. The proposed BBI model works in three stages, in the first stage the original
    area data and time series metrological data is pre-processed and its output works
    as input for the second stage where BPNN and RNN (recurrent neural network) learns
    deep spatial and temporal features from the input data. In the third stage, BPNN
    learns the relationship between deep features and rice yield to predict the summer
    and winter rice yields. The performance of the model is evaluated in terms of
    error and rate of convergence, the model presents lowest error values with MAE
    and RMSE of 0.0044 and 0.0057 for summer rice prediction and 0.0074 and 0.0192
    for winter rice prediction while the algorithm converges within 100 iterations.
    Feng et al. [54] proposed a hybrid approach for wheat yield prediction in new-south
    Wales in southeastern Australia. Multiple growth specific indicators, viz. agricultural
    production system simulators (APSIM), NDVI, and SPEI (Standardized Precipitation
    and Evapotranspiration Index) are used before the prediction of wheat yield using
    regression models (multiple linear regression (MLR) and RF). APSIM+ RF hybrid
    model presents the best performance among other predictors in terms of prediction
    accuracy. Cai et al. [55] integrated two data sources, i.e. climate data and satellite
    data over fourteen years to predict the wheat yield in Australia using ML algorithms
    (SVM, RF, and NN). Simulation results show that climate data provides distinctive
    information in comparison to satellite data for yield prediction with R 2 of around
    0.75. Planting the crops on accurate date plays an important role in improving
    productivity and reducing financial loss. Gumuscu et al. [56] explored three supervised
    ML algorithms; kNN, SVM, and decision trees for predicting planting dates; early,
    normal, and late for wheat crops in Turkey. The authors utilized climate data
    of the last 300 days to train ML algorithms and explored GA for feature selection.
    kNN classification ML algorithm shows robust performance and best predicts the
    planting dates of wheat crops. Several African, American, and Asian countries
    are the major producer of coffee in the world. Nevavuori et al. [57] explored
    a deep learning approach, i.e. CNN for wheat and barley yield prediction in the
    agriculture field of Pori, Finland. NDVI and RGB dataset obtained from cameras
    installed in UAV is used to train the six-layer CNN. RGB dataset best predicts
    the crop yield in CNN with MAE of 484.3 kgha−1 and mean absolute percentage error
    (MAPE) of 8.8%. Koirala et al. [58] reviewed deep learning approaches for fruit
    detection and yield estimation. CNN in the context of computer vision is widely
    used for feature extraction from images that provide useful insight to object
    detection and yield estimation. Kouadio, et al. [59] predicted the Robusta coffee
    yield using ML techniques from soil fertility dataset of Vietnam. ELM model outperforms
    multiple linear regression and RF algorithm with RMSE of 496.35 kg ha−1 and MAE
    of 326.40 kg ha−1. Gamboa et al. [60] predict the cocoa yield in Santander, Columbia
    using a generalized linear model (GLM) and SVM. In recent decades researchers
    have explored statistical and probabilistic models for crop yield prediction.
    Gyamerah et al. [61] proposed a novel robust probabilistic forecasting model based
    on quantile random forest and Epanechnikov kernel function (QRF-E) for crop yield
    prediction in Ghana. The proposed approach didn’t only predict discrete yield
    values but completely showcase probability descriptions for prediction interval
    for the two crops groundnut and millet. The simulation result shows the superior
    performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of prediction intervals coverage
    probability and prediction interval normalized average width under uncertain weather
    conditions. Peng et al. [62] explored remote sensed satellite-based Solar-Induced
    Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) dataset for training ML algorithms to predict maize
    and soybean yield in the mid-west region of the United States. Simulation results
    show that non-linear algorithms such as SVM, ANN, RF best predict the crop yield
    in comparison to least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (LASSO)
    and ridge regression (RIDGE) algorithm. Khaki and Wang [63] predicted the hybrid
    maize yield with a dataset of 2,267 locations of the United States and Canada
    between the years 2008 to 2016 using deep neural networks (DNN). Genotype, weather,
    and soil properties were the three components used to train DNN. The proposed
    model accurately predicts the maize yield with RMSE of 12% of the average yield
    for predicted weather dataset and 11% of the average yield for perfect weather
    dataset and outperforms LASSO, shallow neural network (SNN) and regression tree
    (RT). Simulation results show that environmental factors have a large impact on
    the prediction accuracy of crop yield. In most areas of Africa, agriculture field
    data is scarcely available thus remotely sensed dataset is widely used for monitoring
    the field. Leroux et al. [64] explored the ML algorithm for predicting the maize
    yield in Burkina Faso with a remotely sensed dataset. A process-based crop model
    SARRO which is basically designed to simulate attainable agricultural yields under
    tropical conditions is used in this study. RF outperforms MLR in maize yield prediction
    with R 2 of 0.59 at the end of the season and 0.49 before two months of harvest.
    Li et al. [65] build a statistical model for predicting the rain-fed crop yield
    using climate, satellite, and country-specific datasets in the mid-west region
    of the USA. Maimaitijiang et al. [66] explored the potential of UAV with DNN for
    soybean yield prediction from the fields of Columbia, Missouri, USA. Multi-modal
    information such as canopy spectral, structural, and thermal features extracted
    from images obtained from the sensors installed on UAV is used as the input dataset
    for training DNN. The simulation result shows that DNN accurately predict the
    crop yield and outperforms partial least square regression (PLSR), RF, SVR algorithms
    with R 2 of 0.720 and RMSE of 15.9%. Zhang et al. [67] explored ANN for prediction
    of annual crop planting utilizing a historical cropland data layer (CDL) dataset
    of corn-belt of mid-west, USA. Kocian et al. [68] utilized both approaches to
    predict crop growth in greenhouses. IoT smart sensors are installed in the greenhouses
    to monitor different environmental parameters, soil properties and plant growth
    parameters such as leaf area index (LAI), accumulated dry weight (DW) and evapo-transpiration
    (ET). These parameters are in real-time send to the cloud through IoT devices
    and permit the implementation of an agriculture decision-support system. The probabilistic
    Bayesian network is explored in the proposed system to predict crop development
    parameters. Shahinfar and Kahn [69] explored ML algorithms for early prediction
    of adult wool growth in Merino sheep of Australia. Model Tree algorithms best
    predict the wool growth in comparison with NN with a correlation coefficient of
    0.93, 0.90, 0.94, 0.81 and 0.59, MAE of 0.48 kg, 0.41 kg, 0.92 μm , 6.91mm and
    6.82 N/ktex, for predicting Greasy Fleece Weight, adult Clean Fleece Weight, adult
    Fibre Diameter and adult Staple Length. Table 5 presents a comparative study of
    different ML algorithms for crop yield prediction. TABLE 5 Different ML Algorithms
    for Crop Yield Prediction C. Disease and Weed Detection Disease fungi, microorganisms,
    and bacteria take their energy from the plants they live on, which in turn affects
    the crop yield. If not detected at the right time may account for a huge economic
    loss to farmers. A lot of financial burden goes to a farmer in the form of pesticides,
    to get rid of diseases and restore the functioning of crops. Excessive use of
    pesticides also leads to environmental damage and the effects of the water and
    soil cycle of the agricultural land. Using an optimally designed AI system during
    crop growth period not only reduces the risk of crop disease and minimizes the
    economic impact, but it also results in minimizing the adverse impact of unsystematic
    farming on the environment. Sambasivan and Opiyo [70] used a CNN based DL model
    to detect disease in cassava crops for imbalanced datasets. The authors took a
    database of 10,000 labeled images that were pre-processed to improve the image
    contrast using contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization algorithm. The
    model evaluation was done using the performance metrics: confusion matrix, accuracy
    measure, precision measure, sensitivity, and F1 score. The authors reported a
    best-case accuracy of 99.30% and the lowest accuracy was reported as 76.9%. Ramcharan
    et al. [71] used DL algorithms to detect diseases in cassava crops. Authors deployed
    deep CNN to identify three different diseases and two types of pests from a set
    of 11,670 images dataset. Author’s utilized GoogLeNet algorithm based Inception
    v3 in Tensor Flow. The authors achieved efficiency in a range of 80% to 93.0%,
    and the validation of the results was done with the help of the confusion matrix.
    Mohanty et al. [72] employed DL methods to detect crop disease from the image
    dataset of plant leaves. The authors used a public database consisting of smartphone
    generated 54,306 images of diseased and healthy plants leaves. These images were
    resized to 256×256 pixels and were assigned 38 different class labels of crop-disease
    pair, and transformed into 3 datasets color, grayscale and segmented. The dataset
    was then fed to two of the most common deep CNNs: AlexNet [73] and GoogLeNet [74].
    The authors achieved an accuracy of 99.34% for GoogLeNet, and an accuracy of 85.53%
    for AlexNet network. The results were validated using F1 score, authors achieved
    a mean F1 score of 0.9886 for GoogLeNet, and a mean F1 score of 0.9848 for AlexNet.
    Amara et al. [75] used LeNet based CNN architecture for disease detection in banana
    leaves. Authors utilized data from open source local and digital libraries which
    were pre-processed and resized to 60×60 pixels, and the model was implemented
    for RGB as well as grayscale images. Hughes and Salathe [76] utilized this developed
    model for the identification of diseases in the images dataset. The authors achieved
    the best F1 score of 0.9971 for detection in RGB images and a score of 0.976 for
    grayscale images. Ferreira et al. [77] deployed CNN for the identification of
    weeds in soybean crops. The image dataset for soy plantation located at São José
    farm, Campo Grande Brazil was acquired using phantom DJI3 drone. The images are
    segmented using the SLIC algorithm into square grids. For training, the segmented
    images were manually annotated to their class. The segmented images dataset was
    fed to AlexNet (a convolution neural network) for classification. The performance
    of the AlexNet was compared with SVM, AdaBoost, and RF. To evaluate the performance
    of the AlexNet the model was fed with a balanced dataset and the authors reported
    an overall accuracy of above 90% and 96.3% images were correctly classified. Waheed
    et al. [78] proposed a cost-effective optimized dense CNN (DenseNet) for disease
    detection in corn leaves with an accuracy of 98.0%. Simulation results show that
    the proposed model outperforms other CNN models such as EfficientNet, VGG19Net,
    NASNet, and XceptionNet in terms of fewer parameters, accuracy, computation complexity,
    and computation time. Pereira et al. [79] proposed an expert system for identifying
    three species of aquatic weeds from aquatic weed leaves dataset based on their
    shape and supervised pattern recognition techniques. The author explored five
    shape descriptors with different shape-based skills viz. Beam Angle Statistics
    (BAS), Fourier Descriptors (FD), Moment Invariants (MI), Multi-scale Fractal dimension
    (MS), and Tensor Scale Descriptor (TSD) along with five ML algorithms viz. Optimum-Path
    Forest (OPF), SVM, Naive Bayes, ANN, MLP. Simulation results show that OPF using
    the BAS-100 descriptor presents the best results with a recognition rate of 96.41%
    in comparison to other approaches. Jiang et al. [80] proposed a semi-supervised
    CNN feature-based Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for identifying weeds utilizing
    6000 images of corn, lettuce, radish, and mixed weed dataset. The proposed approach
    works in two parts, i.e. in the first part CNN model is used for feature extraction
    thereafter in the second part GCN graph is explored utilizing CNN feature dataset
    for extracting feature of an unlabelled dataset using labelled dataset. The proposed
    approach shows the best results in comparison with AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet-101
    approaches with recognition accuracies of 97.80%, 99.37%, 98.93%, and 96.51% on
    four different weed datasets. Oppenheim and Shani [81] explored CNN for identifying
    four different types of diseases in potatoes. The simulation result shows that
    the model trained on 90% of the images and tested on 10% of images give the best
    results with 96% accuracy. Sugar beet contributes around 30% of world sugar production.
    Leaf spot diseases in sugar beet can create a loss of around 10 % to 50 % of yearly
    sugar yield. Rumpf et al. [82] proposed SVM with a radial basis function as a
    kernel based model for early detection and classification of three diseases Cercospora,
    leaf spot, leaf rust, and powdery mildew in sugar beet leaves. Diseased and non-diseased
    leaves were classified with an accuracy of 97% and three diseases were identified
    with accuracy higher than 86%. Ozguven and Adem [83] proposed updated faster R-CNN
    for leaf spot disease identification and classification in sugar beet. Leaf spot
    disease initially generates as small circular spots and later spread over the
    entire leaf surface. The proposed R-CNN architecture changes its parameters according
    to the images and the disease infected regions, which improves the overall classification
    rate to 95.48%. Bah et al. [84] explored CNN for weed detection in images obtained
    using UAV from bean and spinach fields. The proposed model first identifies the
    crop rows and then identifies the inter-crop row weeds which are used as a training
    dataset for CNN for crop and weed identification and classification. Kerkech et
    al. [85] identified the vine diseases from visible and infrared UAV images obtained
    in the Center Val de Loire region in France. A CNN model is trained with this
    dataset of images to classify each pixel according to different instances, namely,
    shadow, ground, healthy, and symptom. The model identifies with an accuracy of
    92% at grapevine-level and 87% at leaf level. Oslen et al. [86] explored robust
    deep learning models Inception-v3 and ResNet-50 for weed species identification
    and classification from a dataset of images collected in Australian rangeland.
    Simulation results show that the average classification performance of both the
    models is 95.1% and 95.7%. These results found fruitful for automatic real-time
    robotic weed control in the agricultural field. Sudars et al. [87] establish an
    experimental set up with RGB digital cameras in Latvia to collect images of the
    field having 6 food crops and 8 weed species grown in normal field conditions
    and controlled environment. This dataset can be utilized by deep learning algorithms
    for weed identification and classification. Sethy et al. [88] identified the rice
    leaf disease based on a hybrid CNN and SVM. In this model, CNN is explored for
    deep feature extraction from 5932 diseased rice leaf images and this data is used
    as input for SVM classifier. The resnet50 with SVM classification model best classify
    with respect to other models with F1 score of 0.9838. Garcia et al. [89] proposed
    an ML and DL learning hybrid approach for weed and crop identification in the
    agriculture fields of Greece. Image dataset of two crops tomato and cotton and
    two weeds black nightshade and velvetleaf was generated for training and testing
    of the model. Initially CNN (Xception, Inception-Resnet, Vignette’s, Mobilenet,
    and Densenet)) is used for feature extraction and this feature set is later used
    to train ML classifier (SVM, XGBoost and Logistic Regression) for classification.
    The simulation result shows that Densenet and Support Vector Machine outperforms
    other approaches with F1 score of 99.29%. Shah and Jain [90] identified the disease
    in cotton leaf through ANN with some image pre-processing techniques. Yu et al.
    [91] explored deep learning algorithms with a dataset of images for identifying
    dandelion, ground ivy, and spotted spurge in perennial ryegrass. Parraga-Alava
    et al. [92] generated a robusta coffee leaf image dataset (RoCoLe) for disease
    identification using ML algorithms. Glezakos et al. [93] proposed an innovative
    method to identify two viruses Tobacco Rattle Virus (TRV) and the Cucumber Green
    Mottle Mosaic Virus (CGMMV) in plants. In the proposed research Bio-Electric Recognition
    Assay (BERA) technique is utilized to obtain time-series information of the two
    viruses by measuring the waves through biosensors for 331s. This time-series data
    is preprocessed using GA to eliminate noise and for dimensionality reduction of
    a large dataset. Thereafter this meta-data is used to train MLP neural network
    classifier. The proposed model is tested against other ML classifiers via cross-validation.
    Ramesh and Vydeki [94] explored optimized deep NN with the Jaya algorithm for
    the identification of paddy leaf diseases. A dataset of rice plant leaves was
    taken from the agricultural field to identify and classify normal, bacterial blight,
    brown spot, sheath rot, and blast diseases. Simulation results show that the proposed
    model accurately classifies the diseased and normal images with an accuracy of
    98.9%, 95.78%, 92%, 94%, and 90.57% for blast affected, bacterial blight, sheath
    rot, brown spot, and normal rice leaf images. Chechlin’ ski et al. [95] explored
    CNN for weed identification in four plant species at different growth level and
    under varying light conditions. CNN architecture combines U-Net, MobileNets, DenseNet,
    and ResNet models for classification of weeds in crops. In [96]–[99] author has
    reviewed machine and deep learning techniques for weed, pests and disease identification,
    and classification in crops at different growth stages. Table 6 presents a comparative
    study of different ML algorithms for disease and weed identification. TABLE 6
    Different ML Algorithms for Disease and Weed Identification D. Drip Irrigation
    In the modern era, irrigation for crops has been improvised using the concept
    of drip irrigation [100], where the system consists of thin plastic tubes placed
    in or above the soil along the vertical rows of the plants for nurturing the water
    supply to the crops. Employing the proper operational management of drip irrigation,
    minimizes the utilization of water supply for crop production, and provides a
    better yield of crops. Socio-economic and environmental demands have widely appreciated
    in use of drip irrigation on farmlands for agriculture, especially for the high
    cost valued crops i.e., vegetables and fruits. Furthermore, drip irrigation is
    based on the low-pressure watering system in comparison to sprinkler systems;
    this makes the system more efficient in terms of energy consumption [101]. Various
    advantages have been observed using drip irrigation in agriculture over other
    irrigation systems which include sub-irrigation systems or sprinkler irrigation
    systems. These advantages are entitled to minimal usage of water supply, usage
    of soluble fertilizers through a drip irrigation system, automated system, minimization
    of soil erosion, uninterrupted activities, minimized weed problems, facilitation
    of double-cropping. Precision irrigation is another innovative approach in intelligent
    farming where it uses the water intelligently that further helps the farmers to
    achieve better yield in crops with minimal water usage. It can also be featured
    as providing the right amount of water, at the right time and the right place
    in the field. It focuses its implementation based on variable rate irrigation
    (VRI) methods employing drips or sprinklers. [102]–[104]. Advancements in the
    field of on-farm sensor technologies, weather forecasting, IoT based sensor detection
    system of vegetation and precision-based smart irrigation produces a huge size
    of data that ultimately benefits the farmers in optimizing the usage of water
    resources, improve the yield of crops and maximizes the profit of farmers [105].
    ML and DL and reinforcement learning are employed on the historical data and it
    provides various opportunities for real-time prediction and decision making purposes
    for smart irrigation which are solely based on the data collected by the sensors
    and IoT enabled systems [106]–[109]. Roberts et al. [110] have discussed that
    a sensor-based control system might create some bottleneck in terms of reducing
    the reliability of decision support tools on process-based crop models, which
    further may require costly calibration and affect in generating an uncertain representation
    of soil-plant-atmosphere processes. Further, ML techniques have been employed
    extremely well for protection analysis of hydrological processes i.e., soil moisture
    and groundwater levels [111], [112]. Li et al. [113] utilized ANN for estimating
    nitrate distribution in different types of soils under a drip irrigation system.
    Kavianand et al. [114] proposed a fully automated drip irrigation system based
    on the ARM9 processor along with different kinds of sensors equipped for monitoring
    the PH content and nitrogen content of the soil and controlling the irrigation
    of the field. Emmanuel et al. [115] establishes an experimental set-up in a greenhouse
    in Malaysia to monitor the growth of mustard leaf vegetable plants through IoT
    devices and alongside developed a data-driven model of drip irrigation system.
    Soil moisture, irrigation volume, evapotranspiration were measured through sensors
    and were given to the Raspberry Pi 3 controller for storing it in the cloud. This
    data was utilized by different predictive models ARX, BJ, and state-space models
    to predict soil moisture content for an optimized drip irrigation system. ARX
    model outperforms other predictive models in terms of MSE and response time. Seyedzadeh
    et al. [116] explored ML algorithms to optimize the uniform emitter discharge
    rate of drip irrigation system under varying pressure and temperature conditions.
    In this model operating pressure, water temperature, discharge coefficient, pressure
    exponent, and nominal discharge were taken as input parameters while ration of
    emitter discharge to nominal discharge is taken as output temperature. Authors
    explored four different ML algorithms for optimizing emitter discharge rate and
    simulation results show that LS-SVM presents best results with the least error
    of mean absolute error. Peng et al. [117] utilize soil moisture, soil electrical
    conductivity, air temperature, and light intensity parameters to build an optimized
    irrigation prediction model using backpropagation NN in China. The proposed prediction
    model presents good results with MSE of 0.00857724. The authors also identified
    an optimized layout and network arrangement for pipe in a drip irrigation system
    using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. The simulation results present
    that the H-shaped network layout is more suitable for field crop irrigation than
    the comb-shaped and fish bone-shaped layout. Drip irrigation system gives the
    best performance when the wetting front dimension, i.e. diameter, depth, and upward
    movement are optimized. Shiri et al. [118] explored soft-computing approaches
    viz., gene expressions programming (GEP), and RF techniques in modeling wetting
    front dimensions over different soil types for surface and sub-surface irrigation
    system. Proposed model, best predicts ETc with an improved correlation coefficient
    and decreases MSE and MAE. Elnesr and Alazba [119] explored ANN for predicting
    the wetting front dimensions from the dataset of a well-tested HYDRUS 2D/3D model.
    The simulation results show that the proposed model has a good correlation of
    0.93-0.99. Chang et al. [120] developed a smart irrigation model based on ML with
    the LoRa P2P network to learn the irrigation experiences from the expert farmers
    working on greenhouse organic crops. Singh et al. [121] have discussed an ML and
    IoT based model for soil moisture prediction during irrigation. Torres-Sanchez
    et al. [122] proposed a decision support system for irrigation management of citric
    crops in southeast Spain. In the proposed model smart sensors are deployed in
    the field to monitor water supplied previous week, weather data, soil water status,
    and based on this data three regression models SVM, RF, and Linear regression
    was trained to build the irrigation decision support system. RF best predicts
    with comparatively less prediction error. Hellín et al. [123] explored the Partial
    Least Square Regression (PLSR) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)
    model for building a smart irrigation decision support system crops in southeast
    Spain. Goumopoulos et al. [124] proposed a real-time adaptable intelligent and
    autonomous closed-loop irrigation management system. The authors built an experimental
    set-up in a greenhouse and deployed wireless sensors for monitoring the plant
    growth and environmental conditions along with plant growth control actuators.
    Estimation of evapotranspiration (ETc) plays a vital role in water resource management
    system. Chen et al. [125] estimate crop actual ETc from temporal convolution network
    (TCN) from the dataset of lysimeters for maize under drip irrigation with film
    mulch. Simulation results show that the proposed model best predicts ETc with
    an improved correlation coefficient and decreases MSE and MAE. Table 7 presents
    a comparative study of different ML algorithms for drip irrigation. TABLE 7 Different
    ML Algorithms for Drip Irrigation E. Livestock Production and Management Livestock
    production is basically related to the production and management of cattle i.e.,
    sheep, pigs, etc. for human consumption in terms of meat. Livestock production
    and their management are based on the farming parameters of these cattle i.e.,
    health, food, nutrition, and behaviour to optimize their production in such a
    way that the economic efficiency of this livestock can be maximized. In the present
    scenario, Artificial intelligence, IoT and Blockchain technologies [126] are widely
    explored to improves livestock sustainability and for analysis of their chewing
    habits, eating patterns, their movement patterns i.e., standing, moving, drinking
    and feeding habits, indicate the amount of stress the animal is going through
    which in turn helps in predicting the vulnerability to disease, weight gain, and
    production of the livestock. Furthermore, an ML-based weight predicting system
    can help in the estimation of their body weight 90–180 days before the slaughtering
    day. According to these analyses and estimations, farmers can change their diet
    plans and living conditions for their better growth in terms of health, behaviour,
    and weight gain which in turn will improve the economic efficiency of these livestock
    [127], [128]. Villeneuve et al. [129] build a decision support system that encounters
    not only real-time data but also expert knowledge for precision sheep farming.
    Livestock production and management can be further classified into two sub-categories,
    i.e., animal welfare and livestock production. Animal welfare generally deals
    with the animal’s health and their well-being; for this ML techniques are applied
    to their health monitoring feature for prospective of early disease detection.
    Whereas, livestock production employs the ML on the estimation of the balanced
    production of livestock for the producers to achieve economic benefits. Dutta
    et al. [130] described a procedure for the classification of cattle behaviour
    employing the ML techniques for data collection using collar-based sensors i.e.,
    magnetometers and three-axis accelerometers. In this study, events such as oestrus
    and dietary changes on cattle have been analyzed for their well-nutrition. Pegorini
    et al. [131] presented an automatic identification and classification of chewing
    habits of claves employing ML-based techniques for analysing their health and
    behavioural patterns. Ebrahimie et al. [132] proposed ML predictive model for
    estimating Sub-Clinical Mastitis (SCM) from milking parameters in dairy herds.
    Mastitis is an inflammatory disease that is widely affecting the dairy industry.
    Author’s explored four classification models decision trees, stump decision trees,
    parallel decision trees, and random forest to discover SCC independent of Somatic
    Cell Count (SCC) which is widely used to measure SCM worldwide. RF with Gini Index
    criteria best predicts SCM with an accuracy of 90%. Ebrahimie et al. [133] explored
    the attribute weighting model (AWM) for identifying lactose concentration and
    electrical conductivity in milk, which are two of the major indicators of SCM
    in dairy cattle. Hyde et al. [134] also explored RF to predict the route of transmission
    of germs and classify them into contagious (CONT) or environmental (ENV) with
    ENV further sub-classified into non-lactating “dry” period (EDP) or lactating
    period (EL). The simulation results show that an accuracy of 98% was achieved
    for discovering CONT vs ENV and 78% for discovering EDP and EL. Esener et al.
    [135] utilized spectral profiles dataset to discriminates CONT and ENV strains
    using GA, NN, and quick classifier. Ebrahimi et al. [136] predicted sub-clinical
    bovine mastitis using a large milking dataset collected through an automated in-line
    monitoring system in commercial New Zealand dairy farm. The simulation results
    show that GBM outperforms other ML model and best predict sub-clinical bovine
    mastitis with an accuracy of 84.9%. Sharifi et al. [137] explored meta-analysis
    and decision trees data mining tools to discover genes that can help to find mastitis
    in dairy cattle. Machado et al. [138] explored the RF model to identify factors
    influencing the occurrence of Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) viral disease
    in cattle in southern Brazil. The proposed approach identifies that insemination,
    the number of cattle in neighbouring farms, and routine rectal palpation are among
    the main factors of the occurrence of this disease. Matthews et al. [139] developed
    an ML-based automated monitoring system for tracking animal behaviour and movement
    i.e., standing, moving, feeding, and drinking by employing the depth video cameras
    and sensors. Qiao et al. [140] explored the DL technique Mask R-CNN for examining
    cattle health and welfare information in precision livestock management. The proposed
    model extract key features from image frames, enhance the image to remove non-uniform
    illumination shadow influences, segment image of cattle from the background image
    using the Mask R-CNN DL tool, and lastly extract cattle contour lines from the
    segmented image. The proposed approach outperforms SharpMask and DeepMask image
    segmentation models with mean pixel accuracy of 0.92 and an average distance error
    of 33.56 pixels. Liakos et al. [141] explored ML model for predicting healthy
    cattle and cattle suffering from lameness utilizing basic features of cattle which
    includes per day habits of cattle like steps taken, overall walking, lying, and
    eating habits. Morales et al. [142] employed a method based on SVM for early detection,
    warnings, and production issues of eggs in the poultry farms. The simulation results
    show that the proposed technique alerts a day before with an estimation accuracy
    of 0.9854. The identification of livestock is an important aspect of monitoring
    growth and animal welfare. Hansen et al. [143] explored deep learning techniques
    CNN for identifying pigs faces from the dataset of digital images of pigs obtained
    from commercial farm environment where the parameters such as dirt and lighting
    are highly unpredictable. The proposed approach accurately predicts the faces
    with an accuracy of 96.7%. Fenlon et al. [144] build a decision support system
    using predictive ML algorithms to provide calving assistance in the dairy industry.
    Four ML techniques multimodal regression, decision trees, RF, and NN were explored
    to predict three calving difficulties unassisted, slight assistance, and veterinary
    assistance. The simulation result shows that NN and multimodal regression models
    accurately classify 75% of calving difficulties with an average prediction error
    of 3.7% and 4.5%. Fenlon et al. [145] analyzed calving difficulties in dairy herds
    in Ireland using ML algorithms. A dataset of parity, log days in milk, inter-service
    interval, difficulties faced in the last calving, herd body conditions were built
    to predict conceptions using artificial insemination in the Iris dairy industry.
    Logistic regression outperforms RF, decision trees, and Naive Bayes in predicting
    conception using artificial insemination. Borchers et al. [146] explored RF, linear
    discriminant, and NN for calving prediction in dairy cattle by examining their
    behaviour which includes number the of steps, lying time, standing time, transition
    from one state to other and total motion 14 days before the predicted calving
    date. Although, the innovative algorithms play a crucial role in livestock management
    but combining livestock data with public data will improve precision livestock
    farming standards [147]. Table 8 presents a comparative study of different ML
    algorithms for livestock production and management. TABLE 8 Different ML Algorithms
    for Livestock Production and Management F. Intelligent Harvesting Techniques Smart
    harvesting systems helps the farmers to harvest agriculture goods by reducing
    human efforts. In this approach, technologies such as smart sensors, robotics,
    UAVs, and IoT devices [148], AI, and ML-based computer vision techniques are employed
    to intelligently harvest the crops. The research community has provided a comprehensive
    review of different intelligent techniques used to automate the agriculture industry
    [149]–[151] and have analyzed the potential and challenges of this decision support
    system [152]. In the last few years, different robots have been developed for
    harvesting fruits and vegetables [153]. Smart harvesting offers better insight
    into the crops and helps farmers to achieve the potential harvest of crops which
    leads to increased productivity. Smart harvesting system has numerous advantages
    in comparison to traditional harvesting approaches like it requires less labour,
    optimized crop yield, maximum probability, better insight into crops, reduced
    cost of harvesting, and cost-efficient production. A significant problem in the
    Japanese agriculture industry is a labour shortage. Sakai et al. [154] utilized
    machine vision for asparagus robot harvesting in Nagasaki prefecture. The speed
    of asparagus robot harvesting is three times faster than the human being. Since
    asparagus harvesting is modeled on their size and doesn’t require color properties
    thus laser sensor is used to collect 3D distance information in the proposed work.
    Monta et al. [155] also explored laser sensors along with color cameras for tomato
    harvesting through robots. Preter et al. [156] developed an autonomous system
    consisting of e-vehicle, cameras, robotic arm, localization system, gripper, quality
    monitoring, and logistic handling system, which can efficiently detect, plucks,
    and puts the strawberries in a box. The proposed robot prototype is fast enough
    to pluck the fruit in just 4 seconds. Hayashi et al. [157] practically evaluated
    the performance of strawberry harvesting robots in a greenhouse test field. The
    proposed autonomous system efficiently access the fruit position and its maturity
    level and pick the fruit with and without suction in a duration of two to three
    weeks without damaging the fruit. Horng et al. [158] proposed a smart harvesting
    system that employs IoT and smart image recognition systems for the detection
    of mature crops using object detection feature trained on MLP neural network.
    The mature crop can be harvested using a robotic arm whose movement is predicted
    using ML algorithms. Zhang et al. [159] explored Regions-CNN (RCNN) for multi-class
    canopy object detection in shake and catch the apple harvesting system. A dataset
    of RGB images was created in the commercial orchard using a Kinect v2 sensor and
    pre-trained RCNN is utilized for real-time detection of apple, branches, and trunks.
    The authors also developed an estimation algorithm to predict shaking location
    based on the results of RCNN. Spectral and thermal images have also been explored
    for the detection of fruits and vegetables [160], [161]. Zhang et al. [162] investigated
    eleven canopy parameters using principal component analysis (PCA) and classified
    the removal status of apples into mechanically harvested and mechanically unharvested.
    Zhang et al. [163] reviewed technology progress in the mechanical harvesting of
    apples which includes shake and catch, robots, and harvest assist platforms. Pise
    and Upadhye [164] explored Naive Bayes and SVM ML techniques for grading of harvested
    mangoes based on their color, size, features, quality, and maturity. Grading of
    fruits increases the profit of the agriculture and food industries. A mango image
    dataset comprising of three different colors red, green, and yellow is created
    and is used for training and testing the ML algorithm. The proposed approach presents
    limited scope as it can detect defects in a particular surface area which can
    be overcome by creating a dataset of rotational view images. Wu et al. [165] explored
    NN for recognition, classification of fruits and vegetables, and obstacle avoidance
    in a harvesting robot. Table 9 presents a comparative study of different ML algorithms
    for intelligent harvesting. TABLE 9 Different ML Algorithms for Intelligent Harvesting
    SECTION V. IoT Applications in Precision Agriculture Precision agriculture refers
    to a system with minimizing direct involvement of the caretaker/farmer except
    when there is an urgent need or an emergency i.e. when there is a failure in the
    system. IoT helps in maintaining the defined standards of parameters needed for
    day to day work in agriculture. The parameters can be measured using the required
    sensors and can be uploaded to an IoT cloud for remote monitoring so that the
    direct involvement of farmers is minimized. The IoT cloud can be used for control
    purposes also, say for example in detecting and avoiding animal intrusion in the
    agriculture field. Sensors are an integral part of IoT for precision agriculture
    without which the monitoring and controlling becomes next to impossible task.
    Figure 6 shows the trend search of keywords “IoT in agriculture” and “sensor in
    agriculture” on google in the last 10 years. Apart from monitoring and controlling,
    IoT in agriculture is also used as data-storage technology. Parameters like properties
    of soil, crop yield, seasonal behaviour data, temperature changes, etc can be
    stored on the IoT cloud which will be helpful in analyses, prediction, and deciding
    on estimated crop production. FIGURE 6. Google trend response for keywords IoT
    in agriculture and sensor in agriculture for the last 10 years. Show All A. Sensors
    for IoT in Precision Agriculture IoT is defined as the interconnection of things,
    where one example of a thing is a sensor. A group of sensors can communicate with
    every other sensor and thereby with the control center. A WSN in IoT has the benefits
    of increasing the efficiency of production, enhancing the yield quality, detecting
    and avoiding plant-eating pets, detecting the fires in the farms [166]. IoT has
    helped in increasing the scope of farming, animal, and pet rearing along with
    smart irrigation [167]. Sensors form an integral part of IoT architecture in agriculture.
    A sensor is defined as a transducer that converts the sensed parameter (soil moisture,
    for example) into the equivalent electrical signal. Depending on the nature of
    the output signal they generate, sensors are classified as analog or digital sensors.
    An analog sensor’s output needs to be converted to digital before it is being
    fed, processed by any IoT system. On the other hand, sensors that generate signals
    in digital form can be directly connected to any IoT system. Table 10 compares
    the list of some important sensors applicable in precision agriculture. Addressing
    the complete list of sensors available for precision agriculture is beyond the
    scope of this article, although, table 10 provides the list of sensors and their
    parameters that are very widely used and covers almost every aspect of IoT in
    agriculture. A pair of sensors and actuators can be used to collect information
    about some of the vital parameters of precision agriculture and react to perform
    predefined action whenever required. IoT plays an important role in assuring that
    the action performed happens instantaneously with minimum delay. The factors that
    can affect the real-time decision making and causes a delay is the tolerance of
    the measuring parameter and the communication protocol used. The operating temperature
    where the sensors are placed have a proportional effect on tolerance. An increase
    temperature on either side will increase the tolerance of the measuring parameter
    and sensor reading will deviate the value of the measurand from the actual value.
    The communication protocol is used to send the readings of the sensor to the microcontroller
    from where the value will be uploaded to the IoT cloud. The data rate of communication
    protocol decides the time required for this data transfer. TABLE 10 Sensor Parameters
    Used in Precision Agriculture B. Wireless Sensor Networks in Precision Agriculture
    WSN is the collection of spatially displaced sensor deployed to monitor the physical
    parameters of the environment and coordinating the collected data at central location.
    IoT transfers the recorded data to cloud which is further processed and analyzed
    through intelligent algorithms. In precision agriculture integration of artificial
    intelligence with WSN allows real time monitoring and intelligent decision making
    in agriculture fields. IoT sensor network which includes soil moisture senor,
    electrochemical sensor, optical sensors, etc. continuously monitor the field data
    and works as a training data for ML and DL algorithms. Edge computing enabled
    AI systems assist in reducing the amount of data to be uploaded to IoT cloud by
    identification of meaningful data to be communicated and discarding the redundant
    data. Intelligent processing of data generated from nodes result in better management
    of sensor network In [185] author utilized AI driven sensor network to classify
    land as suitable, more suitable, moderately suitable and unsuitable after every
    cultivation. In [186] author developed a power efficient WSN using Arduino microcontroller
    and ZigBee module to monitor and control essential parameters that effect crop
    growth such as soil and weather conditions in Florida, USA. In [187] author integrating
    sensor nodes with AI systems to reduce the power consumption of nodes by optimizing
    the performance and data transmission of respective nodes. RNN based Long-Short
    term (LSTM) network was built which increases the runtime of a single sensor and
    guarantees 180 days autonomous operation using Li-ion battery. The proposed system
    continuously monitors the growth dynamics of plant leaves. In [188] author presents
    an autonomous system built with low power sensor nodes and IoT based cloud platform
    to estimate level of phosphorous in soil through ANN. Author incorporates dynamic
    power management system to maintain balance between energy consumption and estimation
    accuracy. In [189] author presents GA optimized WSN for precision agriculture
    applications. Thus, we conclude that integrating artificial intelligence with
    WSN, IoT plays a key role in assuring the best yield of crops. SECTION VI. Assessment
    and Evaluation of Knowledge-Based Agriculture System In this section ML algorithms
    used by different researchers in the precision agriculture system are analyzed.
    The agriculture industry is facing many challenges across the world, and a knowledge-based
    agriculture system allows sustainable use of resources by the farmers aiming to
    get maximum output from the agriculture land. There are two basic stages in precision
    agriculture, i.e. pre-processing stage and processing stage. In the pre-processing
    phase market trends are studied and based on geographical conditions and soil
    properties of the land seeds are selected and the land is prepared for precision
    agriculture system. In the post-processing stage machine vision techniques are
    explored for disease and weed identification while intelligent techniques are
    used for irrigation and harvesting. In this article, author reviewed and discussed
    70 articles where multiple ML algorithms are presented for performance optimization
    of the agricultural cycle. Figure 7 shows the classification of articles based
    on different applications of precision agriculture. FIGURE 7. Classification based
    on agriculture cycle. Show All Figure 8 depicts the cumulative distribution of
    the ML and DL models used by researchers in precision agriculture. The graph depicts
    the broad categorisation of the techniques with their applications to agricultural
    cycle. It has been observed that in majority of the literature the researchers
    have applied multiple algorithms for classification and parameter prediction.
    Regression models and ANN together make up around 65% of the AI techniques employed
    by researchers. Hence, it is important to investigate the techniques used and
    compared by the authors. The individual best performing algorithms have already
    been covered in appropriate sections, however the figure 8 depicts the distribution
    of the various regression algorithms and DL models throughout the literature.
    ELM algorithm is widely explored in prediction of soil properties such as soil
    moisture, soil temperature, surface humidity, ETc. ANN accurately predicts the
    rainfall and crop yield across different regions of globe. DL based CNN model
    finds wide applications for accurate disease and weed classification in agriculture
    crops. ANN model best predicts the nitrate content and water requirement in drip
    irrigation system. SVM regression model estimates the emitter outflow discharge
    under varying temperature and pressure conditions. Decision Tree algorithm accurately
    identify the chewing habits and predicts SCM in dairy herds. CNN have widely explored
    for livestock identification. Metaheuristic optimized ML algorithms are also explored
    by researchers in precision agriculture. FIGURE 8. ML techniques used in precision
    agriculture applications. Show All In the reviewed articles, authors have used
    around 22 different regression algorithms for prediction, however 5 most commonly
    used algorithms are identified and depicted in the figure 9. Remaining 17 algorithms
    which are used either only for comparison or employed as a support algorithms
    have been classified into others. FIGURE 9. Regression algorithm in precision
    agriculture. Show All DL models have contributed significantly and outperforms
    ML classification algorithms in classification of crop disease and weed as well
    as for livestock diseases identification. Figure 10 shows CNN, ANN and RNN algorithms
    explored in precision agriculture. In the reviewed articles, authors have used
    around 10 different DL/NN algorithms for prediction/classification, however 8
    most commonly used algorithms are identified and depicted in the figure 10. Remaining
    2 (LeNet, and Caffee) algorithms which are used either only for comparison or
    employed as a support algorithms have been classified into others. FIGURE 10.
    Classification algorithm in precision agriculture. Show All A. Performance Comparison
    of ML Algorithms in Precision Agriculture The application of ML and DL algorithms
    highly depends on the agriculture cycle and the dataset involved. This section
    discusses the advantages and limitations of various ML and DL algorithms such
    as regression and classification algorithms based on the agriculture cycle involved.
    1) Soil Properties and Weather Prediction The application of AI techniques in
    prediction of soil parameters and weather is dependent on various factors. The
    researchers generally employ around 3 to 4 algorithms in for prediction and select
    the algorithms which has most accurate prediction and is robust to factors such
    as: noise, non-linearity, outliers etc. the most commonly employed algorithms
    are ELM, RF, SVR, and cubist algorithm. Advantages of using ML in prediction of
    soil properties and weather pattern: Non-linear dataset – these predictions often
    attributes a non-linear dataset which can be utilized for accurate prediction
    by regression algorithms such as: ELM, RF, SVR Large dataset – the dataset for
    is often obtained from satellite which can be well handled by the regression algorithms
    with less convergence time and accurate predictions. Insensitivity to outliers
    – Weather patterns often encounter outlier events which may affect the prediction
    accuracy, however algorithms such as ELM, NN are robust to outliers and provide
    accurate predictions. Accurate prediction – prediction of parameters using ML
    exhibit low error indices such as RMSE, and R2 which are standard measures of
    accuracy for statistical analysis. Challenges and limitations in prediction of
    soil properties and weather pattern: Varying geographical conditions poses a challenge
    for universal design of the prediction algorithms. Soil parameters prediction
    is highly dependent on the sample selection philosophy. Dataset selection and
    filtering is a challenge for researchers with non-computing background. 2) Crop
    Yield Prediction The application of AI techniques in prediction of crop yield
    is a mammoth task and lack of availability of a universal model makes designing
    of the algorithm challenging. The most promising algorithms for crop yield prediction
    are regression algorithms, and neural networks. Advantages of using ML in crop
    yield prediction: Complex dataset – crop yield prediction involves enormous dataset
    composing of satellite data and/or historic data. Faster and accurate predictions
    can be made by utilizing the AI techniques such as regression algorithms (SVR,
    RF) Neural networks (CNN). Parameter variation – the crop yield depends on a lot
    of parameters, like climatic factors, soil quality, NDVI, altitude, air parameters.
    The AI based prediction systems handle the parameters dependency efficiently.
    Accurate prediction – prediction of parameters using ML exhibit low error indices
    such as RMSE, and R2 which are standard measures of accuracy for statistical analysis.
    Challenges and limitations in prediction of crop yield: Varying parameters and
    complex datasets pose a challenge for universal design of the prediction algorithms.
    Dataset selection is critical due to the complexity; as an improper selection
    of data may result in underfit/overfit prediction pattern. 3) Disease and Weed
    Detection The applications of AI techniques in disease and weed detection primarily
    depends on the advances in image processing. CNN’s are the most prominent choice
    for building a disease identification system. Training dataset will govern the
    performance of the algorithm, although these are available in open-source format,
    users have to be cautious while using the dataset. Advantages of using ML in detection
    of weed and disease in a crop field: Prediction accuracy – AI offer accurate detection
    of disease and weeds with an accuracy of 99% which is better compared to manual/classical
    techniques. Robust prediction – the algorithms can predict the disease/weed even
    with smartphone images, which is commonly available with farmers. Easy configuration
    – with CNN being the most common and reliable technique, designing a disease/weed
    detection system is not a complex job unlike other systems discussed in text.
    Challenges and limitations in detection of weed and disease in a crop field: The
    accuracy of prediction depends on the quality of training dataset some of which
    is available as an open-source dataset, but is applicable to only a limited number
    of crops. Improperly labelled data may result in a disastrous prediction system,
    as the training of the system plays a major role in the performance of the system.
    Overtraining the model may result in a sensitive prediction system. 4) Drip Irrigation
    Smart irrigation systems are not only crop friendly but are environmental friendly
    too. The combination of IoT with the AI not only reduces the manual intervention
    but also utilizes the available in an optimum way to ensure no adverse effect
    to environment. Regression and Advantages of using ML in drip irrigation for an
    agricultural field: Optimum resource utilization – accurate estimation of irrigation
    requirements results in a system which optimizes the resource (water, electricity)
    utilization (NN algorithms). Crop protection – optimized irrigation practices
    minimizes water related damage to the crops and hence increases the crop yield.
    Robust to weather variations – an accurately designed AI based (Regression algorithms)
    irrigation system handles the random weather events in a better way when compared
    with the non-AI based irrigation methods. Challenges and limitations in drip irrigation
    for an agricultural field: Accurate prediction sometimes depends on the number
    of sensors and hence increases the initial investment of the farmers. An incorrect
    sensor placement in the filed affects the accuracy of the system, hence sensor
    optimization becomes imperative in designing a smart irrigation system. The architecture
    of prediction system highly depends on the dataset; hence no universal guidelines
    can be laid out for system design. 5) Livestock Production and Management The
    livestock management primarily focuses on the well-being of the farm animals and
    uses advanced image recognition (CNN) algorithms, and regression techniques to
    detect and predict the disease/ disease spread. Advantages of using ML in livestock
    production and management: Decreased risk of diseases – AI systems assists in
    identifying the livestock diseases and also helps in combating the disease, by
    predicting the root of diseases and transmission (Regression algorithms). Minimization
    of disease spread – timely diagnosis and treatment reduces the risk of spreading
    the disease. Psychological analysis – advanced image recognition and behavioural
    analysis (CNN techniques) help is detecting the stress in animals ensuring heath
    of the livestock. Challenges and limitations in drip irrigation for an agricultural
    field: With varying geographic and climatic conditions the attributes of the cattle
    and diseases changes hence, no universal system can be designed to cater to the
    diversities. Some viruses are difficult to predict even using the state-of-art
    prediction algorithms. 6) Intelligent Harvesting The applications of AI techniques
    in harvesting is primarily an assistive technology for automatic harvesting systems.
    Harvesting prediction system largely relies on the advances in image processing
    and CNN’s are the most prominent choice for building these systems. Advantages
    of using ML in intelligent harvesting: Assistive technology – AI in conjunction
    with existing harvesting robots exhibit high accuracy in harvesting. Image processing
    – the identification of harvesting relies on the state-of-art image processing
    algorithm (CNNs) and hence the developments in the image processing algorithms
    result in direct accuracy enhancement of intelligent harvesting techniques. Universal
    algorithms – the AI harvesting techniques largely depend on image recognition
    methods, hence CNNs can easily be deployed for implementing intelligent harvesting
    techniques. Challenges and limitations in intelligent harvesting: The accuracy
    of the prediction systems largely depends on the training dataset, hence accurately
    labelled dataset is a primary requirement of implementing an intelligent harvesting
    system. Inaccurate harvesting recognition system result in economic loss for farmers,
    as a delay in harvesting might lead to an overripe crop or early harvesting might
    lead to rejection of the product. SECTION VII. Challenges and Limitations of Artifical
    Intelligence in Precision Agriculture Artificial intelligence has the potential
    of playing an important role in meeting the food requirement of entire world.
    However, there are certain challenges which are hampering its adoption in agriculture
    industries which are outlined as follows: A recent government survey in India
    estimated that literacy rate of Indian farmers is very low therefore bridging
    the gap between farmers and technology is a challenging task. Farmers are less
    motivated to come out from their comfort zone and learn digital skills to improve
    their farming standards. Agriculture lands are mostly situated in rural areas.
    Implementation of IoT architecture and WSN which requires cloud services for data
    storage and analysis is a big issue in rural areas where reliable internet connectivity
    is not available. Accurate prediction and classification through cognitive ability
    of machines is difficult in varying geographical conditions. Initial set up of
    digital farming which includes hardware and software requires huge investment.
    Deployment of smart sensors and other electronic gadgets requires heavy energy
    consumption. SECTION VIII. Future Trends of Artifical Intelligence and IoT in
    Precision Agriculture Agriculture industry is globally US$5 trillion industry
    and now it has been revolutionized with artificial intelligence and IoT technologies.
    These innovative tools are assisting famers to improve crop yield, monitor soil
    parameters, livestock health and temperature conditions, control pests and improve
    other agriculture related tasks. Conventional ML and DL models such as SVM, RF,
    ANN finds difficult to accurately estimate soil parameters and weather conditions
    in varying ecosystem. Therefore, swarm intelligence optimized robust and adaptive
    ML and DL algorithms such as SVM-PSO, ANN-GWO algorithms can be explored to effectively
    forecast different parameters in precision agriculture. In large agriculture fields
    swarm intelligence inspired autonomous system can be built for crop health and
    growth monitoring. UAV swarm can be utilized for near real time field and livestock
    monitoring through computer vision and DL algorithms and accordingly swarm of
    UAV can be used for spraying of pesticides and fertilizers in the infected crops.
    Greenness of crops can be identified through UAVs installed cameras and an automated
    irrigation system can be built in large agriculture fields. Swarm of mobile robots
    can be used in the agriculture fields to efficiently automate task such as harvesting,
    weed identification and elimination, etc. Metaheuristic algorithms can be explored
    for nodes localization in agriculture fields in order to optimize the sensor deployment
    in the field and keep the minimize cost to farmers. Offline service chatbots can
    be built to assist farmers in developing countries where farmers don’t have good
    internet connectivity. These chatbots can assist farmers by providing timely advice
    based on expert recommendations and will help to resolve their specific farming
    problems. Artificial intelligence assisted renewable energy plants can be installed
    in agriculture lands to maximize the power output of clean energy in unpredictable
    weather conditions. This will allow for sustainable agricultural practices. Artificial
    intelligence can also be explored in vertical and soilless agriculture. In near
    future artificial intelligence systems, robotics and smart sensor technology will
    automate the whole farming process starting from seed sowing to intelligent fruits
    and vegetables harvesting and packaging. SECTION IX. Conclusion Precision agriculture
    is empowering the farmers with technology intending to get optimum outputs with
    precise inputs. IoT enabled smart sensors, actuators, satellite images, robots,
    drones are some of the key technological revolutions that boosted the agriculture
    industry. These components play a vital role in collecting real-time data and
    accordingly making decisions without human support. Artificial intelligence which
    is the automation of intelligent behaviour is continuously benefiting our planet
    and helping humans in various aspects of life. In this paper, authors have reviewed
    ML applications for precision agriculture. The impact of AI and IoT in smart farm
    management is discussed with a brief introduction to ML algorithms which are most
    commonly used in precision agriculture. Regression algorithms are the backbone
    for soil properties, weather, and crop yield prediction. DL algorithms such as
    CNN and ML classification algorithms such as SVM, Decision trees, and RF were
    explored for the identification of disease and weeds in the plants. Smart irrigation
    systems and harvesting techniques play an important component in precision agriculture
    as these techniques quickly complete the work and reduces human labour. Drones
    and robots enabled with a digital camera are employed for this work. Livestock
    management is an important concern for farmers across the world. Knowledge-based
    agriculture system which includes smart IoT devices and AI tools efficiently handle
    livestock management. As a scope of future work, NLP based chatbots can be built
    for famers and more ML, DL and hybrid algorithms can be explored in the agriculture
    industry for sustainable use of available resources. Authors Figures References

  limitations: '1. The accuracy of the prediction systems largely depends on the training
    dataset, hence accurately labelled dataset is a primary requirement of implementing
    an intelligent harvesting system.

    2. Inaccurate harvesting recognition system result in economic loss for farmers,
    as a delay in harvesting might lead to an overripe crop or early harvesting might
    lead to rejection of the product.'

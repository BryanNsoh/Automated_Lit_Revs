- analysis: In the current research, researchers employed high-resolution satellite
    imagery (from PlanetScope sensors) and machine learning algorithms to estimate
    stem water potential (Ψstem) in olive trees. Their approach involved calculating
    vegetation indices (VIs) from image reflectance data and comparing the predictive
    performance of support vector machines (SVM), random forests (RF), and multiple
    linear regression (MLR) models. The random forest model, utilizing spectral reflectance
    bands as predictors, outperformed other models in estimating Ψstem. The study

    Figures Versions Notes Abstract Assessing plant water status accurately in both
    time and space is crucial for maintaining satisfactory crop yield and quality
    standards, especially in the face of a changing climate. Remote sensing technology
    offers a promising alternative to traditional in situ measurements for estimating
    stem water potential (Ψstem). In this study, we carried out field measurements
    of Ψstem in an irrigated olive orchard in southern Italy during the 2021 and 2022
    seasons. Water status data were acquired at midday from 24 olive trees between
    June and October in both years. Reflectance data collected at the time of Ψstem
    measurements were utilized to calculate vegetation indices (VIs). Employing machine
    learning techniques, various prediction models were developed by considering VIs
    and spectral bands as predictors. Before the analyses, both datasets were randomly
    split into training and testing datasets. Our findings reveal that the random
    forest model outperformed other models, providing a more accurate prediction of
    olive water status (R2 = 0.78). This is the first study in the literature integrating
    remote sensing and machine learning techniques for the prediction of olive water
    status in order to improve olive orchard irrigation management, offering a practical
    solution for estimating Ψstem avoiding time-consuming and resource-intensive fieldwork.

    olive; modeling 1. Introduction The Mediterranean basin is famous for its rich
    history of olive tree cultivation since the Roman and Greek civilizations [1],
    both for table olives and olive oil production, which represent essential components
    of the Mediterranean diet [2]. The climate condition in these areas is generally
    characterized by hot summers and mild winters, which are well-suited for olive
    tree growth [3]. According to the International Olive Oil Council [4], Mediterranean
    countries accounted for approximately 97% of the world’s olive cultivation, with
    countries such as Spain, Italy, Portugal, Greece, and France being the leaders
    in global olive production, representing 81% of the total olive production [2].
    In addition to their economic value, olive agroecosystems have a long-lasting
    history and represent an invaluable local heritage for landscape, trade, and social
    traditions [5], sometimes cultivated as a part of agroforestry systems [6]. Most
    of the olive-growing areas of the Mediterranean region are located in a semi-arid
    environment with high annual ETo and low annual rainfall. The general trends for
    fresh water supply limitations in Mediterranean countries make it essential to
    understand the olive tree water relations [7], as well as to develop measurement
    methods for olive tree water status and stress detection in large areas [8]. It
    is widely accepted that water deficiencies can lead to significant yield loss,
    whereas adequate management of irrigation water can optimize crop production as
    well as the fruit quality (technological, nutraceutical, and health) of the extra
    virgin olive oil obtained [9]. Moreover, reducing water supplies in the most drought-tolerant
    phenological phases does not decrease fruit yield, accelerate fruit maturity,
    and improve the polyphenols content of the olive oil [10]. It has always been
    believed that plant water requirements differ among species and even cultivars,
    making irrigation scheduling and management a complex task for growers [11]. Therefore,
    site- or crop-specific water status monitoring is becoming crucial to optimize
    irrigation scheduling [12]. Traditionally, in situ measurements of plant water
    status are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and destructive, allowing only limited
    samples and repetitions. Therefore, reliable measurements of plant water stress
    over large areas are often required for water management applications in agriculture.
    Remote sensing has increasingly been utilized to detect plant water stress, with
    interesting advantages, e.g., cost-effectiveness and versatility, leading to a
    useful spatial display of the water stress patterns necessary to manage orchard
    irrigation [13]. Various vegetation indices have been related to leaf and canopy
    water content [13]. Leaf water potential (Ψleaf) measurements can detect the onset
    of water deficiency, allowing a reaction before permanent damage occurs [14].
    However, it can result in high variability within one tree. Recent studies regarding
    irrigation water scheduling and management have focused on the stem water potential
    (Ψstem) as an important parameter of the water status of non-transpiring leaves,
    which is related to water availability and transpiration. To solve the problem
    of water status variability within one tree, most researchers focused on the measurement
    of Ψstem as an indicator of plant water status in several fruit orchards [14,15,16],
    including olive trees, for which Ψstem measurement is crucial for irrigation planning
    and scheduling [17,18]. Nevertheless, there is little information in the literature
    regarding irrigation strategies using Ψstem in olive trees [19] due to the lack
    of reliable methodology for continuous and economically viable monitoring of Ψstem
    in different olive orchard environments. Although numerous works are showing the
    usefulness of monitoring some physiological parameters such as Ψstem [20] and
    stomatal conductance [21] in an open field (using proximal sensors) for the correct
    water irrigation management and to optimize water use efficiency in olive cultivation,
    the potential of remote monitoring of Ψstem, using different remote sensing (RS)
    platforms, has not yet been fully explored nor widely adopted [22], especially
    in olive orchards. Recent studies by Caruso et al. [18,22] for the estimation
    of some physiological parameters based on images acquired by UAVs showed the benefits
    of RS technology in terms of simplifying the data acquisition, which is useful
    for irrigation management. Nevertheless, the use of UAVs is still expensive and
    needs extensive fieldwork to operate them. A previous study by Suárez et al. [23]
    used a series of diurnal airborne campaigns by Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner
    (AHS) over two years in an olive orchard field to investigate changes in the canopy
    photochemical reflectance index (PRI), the combined TCARI/OSAVI, and normalized
    difference vegetation index (NDVI), as an indicator of water stress, as a function
    of field-measured physiological indicators of water stress such as stomatal conductance,
    stem water potential, steady-state fluorescence, and the canopy crown’s temperature.
    Among the three VIs calculated, the authors found that only the airborne PRI demonstrated
    sensitivity to diurnal changes in physiological indicators of water stress, including
    Ψstem measured in the field at the time of each image acquisition. However, the
    use of airplanes is still time-consuming and can add significant costs to farmers
    due to their operational costs. Therefore, using satellite images to estimate
    plant water status parameters would be a viable option as a rapid data acquisition
    source. In this study, remote sensing data were acquired from commercial smallsats,
    specifically Planet’s PlanetScope sensors [24], and processed in QGIS [25] to
    obtain the reflectance value of each spectral band and to calculate vegetation
    indices. The reflectance value of each band and the vegetation indices were used
    to test different machine-learning models to predict stem water potential for
    olive trees. The main objective of this study was to develop, through the integration
    of remote sensing and machine learning techniques, a predictive model of olive
    orchards’ water status to support farmers in managing irrigation water, reducing
    expensive, difficult, and time-consuming fieldwork in the frame of sustainable
    water irrigation management. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Site and Climatic
    Conditions This study was conducted in a commercial olive orchard situated near
    Gallipoli (Apulia Region, Southern Italy) (latitude: 40°01′23.3″ N; longitude:
    18°03′06.4″ E; 23 m above sea level) over two years (2021 and 2022). Olive trees
    at the study site were planted with Olea europaea L. cv. Leccino at a spacing
    of 7 m × 7 m between rows and between trees, covering a study area of about 0.80
    ha (Figure 1). The studied olive orchard was fertilized using commercial fertilizer
    with N 70 kg/ha—P2O5 40 kg/ha—K2O 60 kg/ha according to the regional guidelines
    [26] for sustainable crop management given by the local government of the Apulia
    Region. Figure 1. Location of the olive orchard experimental field. Red points
    indicate Ψstem measurements on the selected olive tree during the two study years
    (2021 and 2022) (Google Earth image ©). The climate condition at the studied olive
    orchard is Mediterranean, belonging to a temperate-dry-hot summer climate-Csa
    class according to Köppen and Geiger, with hot and dry summers and mildly cold
    winters [27]. Generally, the hottest month at the study site is August (the average
    temperature is around 26.4 °C), and the average annual rainfall is about 678 mm.
    Climate data during the two years were provided by the Apulia Region meteorological
    stations [28]. The analysis of climate data indicates that the amount of rainfall
    in both years was reported to be 415.4 mm and 579 mm during 2021 and 2022, respectively.
    However, the rainfall amount in both years was less than the annual average amount
    typical of the area (678 mm). In the 2021 season, the highest average temperature
    was reported in August (32.6 °C), whereas the lowest average temperature was reported
    in January (8.2 °C), and the rainiest month was November (123.2 mm). In the 2022
    season, the highest average temperature was reported in August (32.9 °C), and
    the lowest average temperature was reported in January (7.2 °C), with the rainiest
    month reported to be in December (120.9 mm). The highest values of actual evapotranspiration
    (ETo) were recorded in June and July in both years (Figure 2; Tables S1 and S2).
    Figure 2. The monthly amount of rainfall, irrigation water applied, and trend
    of ETo were calculated following the Hargreaves–Samani equation [29] (a). The
    monthly trend of average minimum and maximum temperatures in the study area during
    the two years of the experiment (b). 2.2. Irrigation Management and Plant Water
    Status Determination In both seasons (2021 and 2022), irrigation water in the
    experimental olive orchard was managed using a decision support system (DSS).
    Irrigation scheduling was organized to keep the soil water content (SWC) of the
    first 30 cm (active root zone) of the soil at an optimum level (set as a recharge
    point (RP) where water can be easily taken up by the plant). This was possible
    by identifying the field capacity and the welting point according to the specific
    physical soil characteristics of the study site. Each year, irrigation interventions
    were applied in full irrigation (FI) regimes scheduling, considering the differences
    in water needs as the crop grows, according to the phenological stages. The soil
    moisture was kept at 34% Ɵ, while RP was set to 26%. Soil moisture was monitored
    using sensors (TEROS 12 Advanced; Meter Group, 2365 NE Hopkins Ct., Pullman, WA,
    USA) and a control unit (ZL6 Advanced Cloud data logger; Meter Group, 2365 NE
    Hopkins Ct., Pullman, WA, USA). The amount of irrigation water applied in 2021
    was 799 m3; in 2022, it was 1311 m3 (Table S3). The olive orchard was irrigated
    more in 2022 than in 2021, considering the fruit load (in 2021, there was no production,
    whereas in 2022, production was about 800 kg/ha). Figure 2 reports the monthly
    amount of irrigation water applied and rainfall and the trend of ETo in both years.
    The salinity of the water used for irrigation was adequate (2.11 ± 0.30 dS/m),
    not exceeding the threshold value of 4.2 ds/m, as reported in Pedrero et al. [30].
    Plant water status was measured in both years on 24 sample olive trees by detecting
    the stem water potential (Ψstem; MPa) using a pressure chamber (Plant Water Status
    Console 3000F01, SOILMOISTURE CORP., Santa Barbara, CA, USA). However, before
    the measurement of Ψstem, mature and fully expanded leaves were placed in aluminum
    foil for 60 min. Hence, every shoot was placed in the pressure chamber, and gaseous
    nitrogen was insufflated until the equilibrium was reached; then, the water potential
    value was read on the console. In each year, Ψstem was measured 4 times during
    the irrigation season (from June to October; in both years, all Ψstem measurements
    were conducted at midday (11.00 to 13.00 h solar time)). 2.3. Satellite Data,
    Image Processing, and Vegetation Indices In this study, we used PlanetScope (PS)
    high-resolution satellite images (Imagery© 2021 and 2022, Planet Labs PBC, San
    Francisco, CA, USA [24]). The PS constellation, consisting of more than 130 satellites,
    currently includes three generations of satellites, including SuperDoves (PSB.SD).
    PSB.SD is the third generation of PlanetScope sensors, which acquire daily imagery
    utilizing 8 spectral bands (i.e., Coastal Blue, 431–452 nm, Blue, 465–515 nm,
    Green I, 513–549 nm, Green, 547–583 nm, Yellow, 600–620 nm, Red, 650–680 nm, Red
    Edge, 697–713 nm and NIR, 845–885 nm) with a spatial resolution of 3 m and the
    equator crossing time of 7.30–11.30 a.m. (local solar time) [24,31]. In this study,
    8 PlanetScope images were downloaded from the online tool “Planet Explorer” as
    orthorectified and radiometrically corrected TIFFs [24] on the same days as Ψstem
    field measurement. We used a spectral image acquired from a UAV at the beginning
    of the 2019 irrigation season to identify the trees under consideration within
    the field. For each tree considered, we calculated the average reflectance of
    the pixels—within the same spectral band—in the correspondence of the tree canopy
    by using the QGIS tool “Zonal statistics” (QGIS Białowieża, 3.22.5 for Windows).
    Additionally, several vegetation indices (VIs) were calculated: normalized difference
    vegetation index (NDVI), optimized soil adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI), transformed
    chlorophyll absorption reflectance index (TCARI), combined TCARI/OSAVI, enhanced
    vegetation index (EVI), modified chlorophyll absorption reflectance index (MCARI),
    combined MCARI/OSAVI, simple ratio (SR), transformed vegetation index (TVI), and
    normalized difference red edge (NDRE). The full range of the VIs calculated in
    this study can be seen in Table 1, along with their description and application
    references in olive orchards. Table 1. Formulation and source of the vegetation
    indices (VIs) used in this study. 2.4. Statistical Analysis and Machine Learning
    In this study, the performances of two machine learning techniques (support vector
    machine (SVM) and random forest (RF)) and linear regression (multiple linear regression
    (MLR)) were tested to create Ψstem predictive models and test their robustness.
    The first approach used was the SVM [40,41]. To test the performance of the SVM,
    a radial basis kernel was used by applying a tune grid-search with the function
    tune() (“e1071” package) to test different combinations of cost and gamma. The
    best combination found for our datasets was cost = 1.5; gamma = 1 and cost = 1.5;
    gamma = 0.5 for PBs and VIs, respectively. The second approach used was the MLR.
    In this approach, we avoided using all the variables to predict Ψstem, maintaining
    only the statistically significant (p < 0.05) variables. The third modeling was
    the RF [42], an ensemble learning technique. In this study, the RF models were
    implemented using the “ranger” package. Moreover, to optimize the performance
    of the models, we utilized the “caret” package. In the ranger implementation of
    RF, we fine-tuned several parameters, including the number of trees, the number
    of variables to potentially split each node (mtry), the splitting rule, and the
    minimum node size. Model calibration was run multiple times using various combinations
    of these parameters, except for the number of trees, which was fixed at 500, as
    it did not significantly impact the overall performance of the models. To evaluate
    the importance of each variable, we used a permutation method [43], where the
    increase in model prediction error was calculated for each run with one variable
    excluded from the predictors set. The resulting values were then scaled from 0
    to 100. Pearson’s r of the correlation, coefficient of determination (R2), root
    mean square error (RMSE), normalized root mean square error (nRMSE), and mean
    absolute error (MAE) were used as measures of the performance to compare the models.
    The statistical analysis and modeling were performed using Rstudio (Rstudio, PBC,
    Boston, MA, USA) for Windows, Version 2022.12.0 + 353. For the graphical representation
    of information and data, SigmaPlot (SigmaPlot, Systat Software Inc., Version 14
    for Windows) was used. Data Handling The analyses were conducted using two distinct
    approaches to data handling. In the first approach, data collected during the
    two years of the experiment were combined in a unique dataset (n = 192) and then
    randomly divided into a calibration (80%) and a testing (20%) dataset. The training
    dataset was used to fit the model, while the testing dataset was used to test
    the goodness of fit of the predictive model. In the second approach, models were
    trained on the first-year dataset (n = 96), and the performance of the models
    was tested on the second-year dataset (n = 96). In both approaches, to predict
    Ψstem as a function of the variables derived from the satellite (PSB.SD), two
    groups of predictors were tested: (1) A dataset containing the PBs reflectance
    value for each sample tree. (2) A dataset containing the VIs value calculated
    for each sample tree. 3. Results 3.1. Stem Water Potential of Olive Trees During
    the experiment, Ψstem varied over a wide range (−0.8 to about −3.5 MPa). Figure
    3 shows a boxplot of Ψstem during the different phenological stages of the olive
    trees and in both years. The data indicates a significant variation of Ψstem between
    the different periods of the olive trees’ development stages in both years. Figure
    3 shows higher Ψstem variations over the summer period (July and August) in both
    years. The analysis of olives’ water status results indicates that Ψstem was decreased
    during the fruit development (50%) phase (2021 DOY: 210; 2022 DOY: 206) and then
    increased during the successive phenological stages (beginning of fruit color
    and harvest maturity) in both years (Figure 3). Despite the variation of Ψstem
    across years and between crop development stages, the overall results showed that
    Ψstem did not fall below −4 MPa. Figure 3. Box plot showing the variation of field
    measured Ψstem at different development stages of olive trees during both growing
    seasons (2021 and 2022). Green circles indicate the mean values. 3.2. Multispectral
    Planet Band Reflectance Value and Vegetation Indices In this study, the ratio
    of the reflectance in different spectral bands was used to calculate 10 VIs (Table
    1) according to the spectral characteristics of the PlanetScope sensors. Table
    2 reported the mean and standard error of the considered predictors (PBs and VIs)
    in this study during the different phenological stages. The calculated VIs reported
    different values during the different olive phenological stages. In general, the
    maximum value was reported for TVI, whereas the minimum was reported for MCARI
    in both years. Some VIs values did not have a regular trend and changed (with
    higher or lower values) according to the phenological phase and/or the study year.
    The NDVI values, for example, show the same trend as the Ψstem, where the values
    dropped during the summer period (particularly in July and August) in both study
    years. Among the calculated VIs, the TVI index gave the highest value, whereas
    the lowest value was reported for MCARI at the different olive phenological stages
    and during both seasons. Table 2. Mean and standard error of the predictors considered
    in this study (vegetation indices (VIs) and Planet Bands’ reflectance (PBs)) during
    the different phenological stages (mean of 24 sample olive trees) for the two
    years of the study (2021 and 2022). 3.3. Evaluation of Ψstem Prediction Performance
    3.3.1. Dataset Combination Approach The following subsections report the results
    of the models’ training conducted after combining the datasets from the two years
    of the experiment. Random Forest The results obtained from the RF-based model
    were similar to the results obtained using the other modeling approaches when
    considering VIs as Ψstem predictors (Testing R2 = 0.57; Testing nRMSE = 18.80%)
    (Table 3; Figure S2). However, when PBs were used as model predictors, the results
    significantly improved (Testing R2 = 0.78; Testing nRMSE = 13.20%). Table 3. Performance
    of the robustness of the models trained with datasets combination. The optimization
    of RF model parameters (min node size, mtry, and splitting rule) with PBs as predictors
    are reported in Figure 4. The importance of the variables is reported in Figure
    5. A high percentage of importance indicates that the explanatory variables are
    an important predictor for the Ψstem of the olive trees. In this study, the results
    indicate that B5 (600–620 nm) had the highest value of importance in the model
    (100%), followed by B4 (547–583 nm), with the second-best value of importance.
    In contrast, the other PBs had an importance value lower than 40%. The B2 (465–515
    nm in the blue region) had no weight of importance in the model. Figure 4. Optimization
    of RF-based model parameters (min node size; mtry; splitting rule) using PBs as
    Ψstem predictors. Figure 5. Results of permutation procedure to assess the importance
    of the variables of the RF-based model using PBs (B1–B8) as predictors of olive
    Ψstem. According to the values of the model performance parameters (R2, RMSE,
    nRMSE, MAE), it is evident that the RF-based model gives more accurate Ψstem prediction
    results compared to the MLR and SVM models at both calibration and testing levels
    (Table 3). In addition, Pearson’s correlation (Figure 6) showed a significant
    correlation between measured Ψstem and predicted Ψstem of the RF-based model when
    the model uses the PBs as predictors. In particular, the correlation between measured
    and predicted Ψstem from the calibration dataset was higher (r = 0.95) than the
    correlation from the testing dataset (r = 0.89). Figure 6. Pearson’s correlation
    between measured and predicted Ψstem using the RF-based model and PBs as predictors.
    Support Vector Machine The results indicate that the SVM-based model had the lowest
    accuracy results in predicting olive Ψstem when compared to other models (Table
    3). This was supported by the Testing R2 and Testing nRMSE values both when using
    VIs (R2 = 0.19 and nRMSE = 19.80%) and PBs (R2 = 0.53 and nRMSE = 17.90%) as model
    predictors (Table 3; Figures S1 and S2). Multiple Linear Regression Considering
    PBs as predictors, the performance results of the MLR-based model are lower than
    those obtained with RF (MLR: Testing R2 = 0.57; RF: Testing R2 = 0.78) but very
    similar to those obtained with SVM (MLR: Testing R2 = 0.57; RF: Testing R2 = 0.53)
    (Table 3; Figures S1 and S2). Considering VIs as predictors, the MLR-based model
    performed worse than RF. On the contrary, the MLR-based model performed better
    compared with the results of SVM (MLR: Testing R2 = 0.57; SVM: Testing R2 = 0.19).
    Stem Water Potential Predictive Map Using the RF-based model, a Ψstem prediction
    map was produced for each DOY of field measured Ψstem in both years (Figure 7).
    The figure shows high-resolution olive Ψstem prediction maps, using the RF-based
    model and the PBs as model predictors, at the different olive Ψstem field measurements.
    Most of the maps in Figure 7 show a distribution of Ψstem across the studied olive
    orchard in both years. Considering the maps of the 2021 season (Figure 7a–d),
    Ψstem values appear higher in June than the other three dates. On the contrary,
    considering the maps of the 2022 season (Figure 7a’–d’), Ψstem values appear higher
    in the middle of the season (July and August). Figure 7. High-resolution Ψstem

    conducted using the second approach (training on the first-year dataset and testing
    on the second-year dataset) did not lead to notable results. The results of the
    model training and testing are detailed in Table 4. Table 4. Performance of the
    robustness of models trained on the first-year dataset. 4. Discussion In this
    study, Ψstem was measured during two irrigation seasons in order to investigate
    the ability of the proposed prediction models to estimate olive Ψstem with reasonable
    accuracy, which can represent an economically viable option for olive growers
    and help them manage water resources more sustainably. The high variation in Ψstem
    (particularly in July and August) is in line with the results found in the literature
    [8]. Previous studies have highlighted that, as the olive tree is considered a
    drought-resistant species, a wide range of Ψstem in olive orchards can be expected
    under different cultivated conditions [44] and different cultivars [45]. In addition,
    Giorio et al. [46] highlighted that the olive tree is characterized by low hydraulic
    conductivity, which can be responsible for a high degree of variation in Ψstem
    in response to changing environmental factors [9]. The Ψstem range reported in
    this study agreed with the ranges reported by several other studies [47,48] for
    ‘Arbequina’ trees. Despite the variation, Ψstem values lower than −4 MPa were
    not recorded, perhaps due to some root absorption of water occurring at deeper
    layers of the soil profile, in line with the result reported by Alcaras et al.
    [49]. In our study, we did not obtain notable results when the models were trained
    with the first-year data; this could probably be due to the limited size of the
    training dataset (the first-year dataset consists of 96 observations) [50]. Hereinafter,
    the discussion is focused only on the models trained after combining the data
    from the two experimental years. Several studies used satellite thermal data to
    monitor crop water status. However, thermal bands (e.g., bands 10 and 11, Landsat-8)
    are characterized by low spatial resolution, which could affect the applicability
    of the model in water status monitoring, particularly in fruit tree crop systems
    [51]. A review by Ollinger [52] highlighted that the difference in visible vs.
    NIR reflectance could be significantly related to various properties of plant
    density or canopy ‘greenness’. In this study, we used the full spectral measurements
    in the VIS, Red Edge, and NIR regions to improve Ψstem prediction accuracy in
    olive trees. Rallo et al. [53] indicated that the technological progress in the
    industrial production of hyperspectral sensors, characterized by a high number
    of contiguous spectral bands, has driven scientists to a more accurate analysis
    aimed at selecting specific wavebands that should be more sensitive to crop-related
    variables [54,55]. For example, using hyperspectral imagery, Zarco-Tejada et al.
    [56] demonstrated the ability of a VI, centered at 570 and 515 nm wavelengths,
    as a water stress indicator. Various studies have considered the full spectral
    information on the basis of multivariate statistical techniques to take advantage
    of an increased number of wavebands and to improve the prediction of crop-related
    parameters [53,57]; however, little research has considered PBs and VIs independently
    as model predictors in order to improve the model prediction accuracy. RF, SVM,
    and MLR were previously used [41] to predict the canopy nitrogen weight from individual
    multispectral bands and associated vegetation indices (VI). The authors found
    that both machine-learning models provided much better accuracy than linear regression.
    Regarding water status estimation, however, very few studies have been carried
    out on the applicability of machine learning techniques such as SVM and RF in
    determining crop water stress in different crops [58] using multispectral remote
    sensing data. These results show that the RF-based model, using PBs as predictors,
    is a good machine-learning technique to estimate Ψstem in the olive orchard using
    Planet satellite data. In fact, as it becomes easier to implement artificial intelligence
    algorithms, more and more studies focus on the use of machine learning that uses
    all available spectral bands [59], taking into account all the information included
    in the spectra [59,60]. Our findings suggest that the most important PBs to predict
    Ψstem with an RF-based model were B5 and B4. The high-importance variable found
    for B5 could be explained by alterations in leaf characteristics due to the water
    stress that could determine changes in optical properties in the specific spectral
    range of 600–620 nm. Carter et al. [61] reported that leaf dehydration could determine
    a change in the spectral response of the leaf around the yellow region. Furthermore,
    a vegetation index (Yellowness Index) was reported in the literature that was
    developed to assess chlorosis in stressed leaves by evaluating how the reflectance
    changes around 600 nm [62]. It should be taken into account that drought stress
    and the consequent reduction of water in the tissues reduce cell turgor and could
    lead to photosystem damage and chlorosis [63,64]. The findings related to the
    importance of the variables are specific to our study, field conditions, cultivar,
    and RF-modeling approach. Thus, they cannot be generalized; moreover, further
    research is needed to confirm or deny our findings. According to the authors’
    knowledge, there have been no attempts in the literature to develop a reliable
    prediction model for the estimation of water status in terms of Ψstem in olive
    orchards using spectral bands and vegetation indices as model predictors through
    the machine learning technique. Nevertheless, this modeling approach has been
    widely used for the estimation of water status in other tree crops. In vineyards,
    for example, a study by Rienth and Scholasch [65] relied on a relationship between
    VI (e.g., NDVI) and crop coefficients to predict crop water status. In contrast,
    other studies [66,67] highlighted that VI with red edge (RE) and shortwave infrared
    (SWIR) positions are more related to crop water status. In agreement with our
    findings, several studies on vineyards [59,60] have suggested that machine learning
    techniques can provide more accurate results in predicting crop water status in
    terms of Ψstem when using single bands instead of VIs. In particular, the study
    of Laroche-Pinel et al. [59] tested five machine-learning algorithms to find possible
    relationships between stem water potential and data acquired from Sentinel-2 images
    (bands reflectance values and vegetation indices). The authors found that when
    using red, NIR, red edge, and SWIR bands, the regression model gave promising
    results in predicting Ψstem (R2 = 0.40, RMSE = 0.26) in vineyards. However, sentinel-2
    has some disadvantages compared to Planet, including lower spatial and temporal
    resolution (Planet provides daily images [24]). The RF algorithm is a widely used
    machine learning approach to highlight non-linear relationships between predictor
    variables [67]. Such a model is well suited for natural and biological phenomena
    that are complex and non-linear [68]. However, the choice of predictors is essential.
    In our modeling approach, using VIs as predictors, the performance was lower than
    the one using PBs. The RF algorithm was probably able to identify different and
    better relationships between the bands for the Ψstem prediction compared to linear
    relationships identified by well-known VIs [69]. In this study, another commonly
    used machine learning model, SVM, was applied to test its ability to predict olive
    Ψstem despite the advantage of the SVM modeling approach due to its ability to
    successfully handle small training data sets with only a few samples [70]. In
    our study, SVM had the worst performance compared to RF and MLR. The results suggest
    that the SVM-based model is not sufficiently acceptable for predicting Ψstem using
    images acquired by PSB.SD. A previous study by Fernandes et al. [71] indicates
    that the use of the SVM method for water stress detection in olives implies some
    assumptions, such as data normality, and requires that independent variables are
    identically distributed, thus reducing their applicability. In agreement with
    the results of this work, Pôças et al. [72] selected three hyperspectral reflectance
    vegetation indices (NIR, WI, and D1) and the DOY as predictors for the inclusion
    in RF and SVM predictive machine learning models for assessing water stress in
    grapevines. The authors found that the RF-based model gave the best water stress
    prediction results (R2 = 0.77) compared to SVM (R2 = 0.71). Furthermore, a recent
    review of support vector machines in precision agriculture [73] indicates that
    SVM had better performance, both for classification and regression problems, than
    other machine learning techniques except for RF, in line with the results of our
    study. The imaging tools provide technicians and researchers the opportunity to
    better examine and understand spatial and temporal variability through the use
    of maps [74]. Maps can be obtained using vegetation indices, a linear combination
    of a certain number of bands, and so on [75], or, as in the case of this study,
    considering a particular parameter predicted through a machine learning technique.
    Pearson’s correlation of the RF-based model data and the PBs as model predictors
    showed a high correlation between measured and predicted Ψstem for the calibration
    dataset (r = 0.95), whereas, for the testing dataset, a slightly lower correlation
    was obtained (r = 0.89). The prediction maps indicate that the RF-based model
    was able to reproduce the spatial variability of Ψstem close to field measured
    Ψstem. The maps show a wide spatial variability within the olive orchard, particularly
    due to the absence of olive trees in specific portions of the field. Moreover,
    it should be taken into account that other factors could influence the spectral
    response within each pixel, e.g., soil management and weed communities’ composition.
    Borgogno-Mondino et al. [76] obtained Ψstem maps of a pomegranate orchard using
    Sentinel-2 images. The maps obtained in this work have the advantage of a better
    spatial resolution (3 m per pixel). In fact, a limitation in the use of satellites
    in agriculture could be due to the low resolution of the images [32]. 5. Conclusions
    The lack of a time-saving and reliable remote sensing methodology for the estimation
    of crop water status in olive orchards inspired us to develop a practical solution
    for the reasonable estimation of Ψstem that can avoid expensive and time-consuming
    fieldwork within the framework of precision management of irrigation water. We
    used Planet reflectance data and measured Ψstem data from 24 olive trees to derive
    a Ψstem prediction model for in-season estimation of Ψstem at the olive orchard.
    Our study found that the random forest (RF)-based modeling approach using PBs
    as predictors can provide a more accurate Ψstem prediction compared with SVM and
    MLR. The variable importance found in RF modeling suggests that the yellow and
    green spectral regions (B5 and B4, respectively) were the most important in Ψstem
    prediction. However, our findings are specific and related to the field conditions
    and, therefore, need to be confirmed by further and long-term studies. This is
    the first study to combine machine learning techniques and high-resolution satellite
    data for the development of a reliable prediction model of water status in olive
    orchards. Our findings can help farmers and technicians monitor the variability
    of olive water status during the irrigation season for better water irrigation
    management. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using satellite multispectral
    imagery and machine learning to create a semi-automated olive water stress modeling
    framework. However, these results are site-specific, and further studies are needed
    to test the temporal and spatial prediction accuracy. Our results open the door
    for deeper studies in which our models can be integrated with other agrometeorological
    information and used to implement more complex algorithms and software that can
    support farmers in water irrigation management in olive orchards (e.g., decision
    support systems). Supplementary Materials The following supporting information

    unmixingSoil waterSoil saltIrrigation area 1. Introduction In arid and semi-arid
    regions, soil water and salt are important factors restricting the development
    of agriculture. Their spatial distribution is a key issue in water-salt regulation
    and has recently become a research hotspot in precision agriculture and irrigation
    (Ge et al., 2019, 2021). Salinization is significantly more severe in northern
    China than in wet areas due to drought, low precipitation, and high evaporation
    (Wang, Zhao, et al., 2021; Wang, Zhang, et al., 2021). Salinized soil in the Hetao
    irrigation district located in the upper reaches of Yellow River, accounts for
    about 63.8% of the total irrigated croplands (57 × 104 hm2) (Ren et al., 2016;
    Xiong, Xu, Engel, Huang, et al., 2021). Imperfect drainage systems and high water
    consumption in Hetao irrigation district may initiate both soil salinization and
    waterlogging (Li, Wang, et al., 2021; Li, Wu, et al., 2021). Timely and accurate
    prediction of soil water and salt dynamics is crucial for regional ecological
    conservation and sustainable development of agriculture (Cambou et al., 2022;
    Wang, Wang, et al., 2022; Wang, Luo, et al., 2022; Wang, Zhao, et al., 2022).
    In researches monitoring soil water and salt, although traditional field sampling
    is highly accurate, it is time-consuming, labor-consuming and discontinuous sampling,
    which cannot realize real-time monitoring of soil water and salt dynamic. Remote
    sensing technologies become powerful tools for mapping soil water and salt content
    from local to global scales, due to their frequent observations with fine resolution
    (Ge, Ding, Teng, Xie, et al., 2022; Ge, Ding, Teng, Wang, et al., 2022). There
    are four main types of remote sensing methods in monitoring water and salt content:
    (1) single-band analysis; (2) spectral index construction; (3) parametric regression
    method; (4) non-parametric regression method. The spectral reflectance in shortwave
    infrared (SWIR) band can reflect vegetation''s response to soil water deficit
    in marshy areas. This feature allows further measurement of dynamic changes of
    soil water table to some extent (Burdun et al., 2020). Spectral indices developed
    from difference in spectral reflection characteristics of each band contribute
    to highlighting the spectral features of specified objectives (Acharya et al.,
    2022; Vo Quang et al., 2022). The salinity index (SI) calculated from spectral
    reflectance in red, blue and green bands was used to recognize the presence of
    salt in palm trees (Allbed et al., 2014). As an integrated soil moisture index
    derived from near infrared-red triangular spectral space, MTSMI showed the capability
    of reasonable estimation for soil water in densely vegetated land surfaces (Amani
    et al., 2016; Chang et al., 2019). Parametric regression method provides empirical
    equations to explain relationship between spectral covariate and target variable
    (like soil water or salt). Wang et al., 2022, Wang et al., 2022, Wang et al.,
    2022 used stepwise multiple linear regressions(SMLRs) to connect short-wave infrared
    drought index (VSDI), normalized differential infrared index (NDII), short-wave
    infrared water stress index (SIWSI) with vegetated soil moisture together. The
    R2 between the water content predicted by the developed model and the measured
    water content ranged from 0.84 to 0.87. With the advantage of discovering knowledge
    from high-dimensional dataset, non-parametric regression methods (e.g. machine-learning
    approaches) become popular modeling techniques for soil water and salt content
    estimation, mainly including Bootstrap Neural Networks (BPNN), Gradient Boosting
    Regression Tree(GBRT), Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR), Random Forest Regression
    (RFR), Support Vector Regression (SVR) etc. (Li et al., 2022; Wang, Zhao, et al.,
    2021; Wang, Zhang, et al., 2021; Zhang, Han, et al., 2023; Zhang, Fan, et al.,
    2023; Zhang, Hou, et al., 2023). A common modeling strategy is to combine machine
    learning approaches with procedurally screened optimal spectral indices (Nguyen
    et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023). For example, PLSR-PCC model was used to map
    the soil salt distribution of rice-growing place on the coastal zone of the Jaffna
    Peninsula (Yang et al., 2023). In general, soil water and salt content estimation
    based on optical remote sensing under vegetation cover have been performed on
    various types of land (e.g., irrigated, rained), and on different types of crops
    (e.g., tomato, wheat, corn, rice, and cotton) on coastal land. (Leng et al., 2022;
    Ma et al., 2022; Wen et al., 2022; Zhang, Han, et al., 2023; Zhang, Fan, et al.,
    2023; Zhang, Hou, et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2022). However, there are two problems
    in the current researches: One is that most of the studies focus on monitoring
    water or salt content alone, and studies on simultaneous estimation of water-salt
    content during the growth of crop and analysis of their spatio-temporal variation
    characterizations in agricultural irrition region are relatively scarce. The another
    is that the vegetation spectral area easily affected by soil water and salt are
    basically the same. Various vegetation indices differ in assessing water and salt
    content separately (Guan et al., 2022). Studies on how to extract spectral features
    of each component from vegetation spectra and use them to quantitatively access
    soil water and salt content respectively are less reported. With the implementation
    of water conservation renovation programs and cultivated land quality improvement
    programs, the average annual net water diversion amount in the Hetao irrigation
    district decreased from 5.2 billion m3 to 4.7 billion m3. And the water cycle
    and burial depth of groundwater in irrigation district changed dramatically, resulting
    in spatial and temporal re-distribution of soil water and salt in irrigation district
    (Liu et al., 2022; Wang, Wang, et al., 2022; Wang, Luo, et al., 2022; Wang, Zhao,
    et al., 2022; Yuan, 2021). Analysis of water-salt evolution in irrigated area
    after water conservation renovation is of importance for soil salinization prevention
    and sustainable agricultural development.(Khasanov et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2022).
    However, The complex soil and groundwater conditions in Hetao irrigation district,
    together with intense human activities, led to strong spatial and temporal variability
    of soil salt, which exacerbated the complexity and diversity of spectral characteristics
    of vegetation within irrigation area and made it difficult to effectively diagnose
    soil water and salt from mixed spectra (Ren et al., 2016; Xiong, Xu, Engel, Huang,
    et al., 2021). In this context, this study proposed a new method combining linear
    spectral unmixing and machine learning to monitor soil water and salt content
    within agricultural filed, taking Huangjiqu in Yongji irrigation area of Hetao
    irrigation district as the study area. This study was designed to explore the
    following: (1) Use spectral unmixing technique to linearly decompose image spectra
    and extract endmember spectra (soil water, salt and water-salt interactions);
    (2) Estimate water and salt content from endmember spectra based on the optimal
    combination of spectral indices and machine learning algorithms; (3) Analyze spatial
    and temporal variations characteristics of farmland water-salt content during
    crop growth. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Description of study area The study
    area was Huangji canal of Yongji irrigation sub-district in Hetao Irrigation District
    (Fig. 1(a)). The geo-graphical coordinates are 107°17′∼107°25′E and 41°02′∼41°10′N.
    The annual average rainfall is 172 mm and the annual average evaporation is 2180
    mm (Guo et al., 2018). The local precipitation was much lower than evaporation,
    which made study area become a non-agriculture region without irrigation. The
    elevation was between 1038.6 and 1040.7 m, and the total area was about 1000 hm2.
    Groundwater data comes from the monitoring wells of Hetao Irrigation District
    Administration Bureau. The depth range of groundwater level from June to October
    was 1.2∼1.9 m. The two main land use types were cultivated cropland and salt wasteland.
    The distribution of salt wasteland was mainly concentrated on the northwest and
    southwest regions of the study area (Fig. 1(b)). The water-salt dynamics was controlled
    by Huangji irrigation canal, Dagu irrigation canal and the forth drainage canal.
    The locally grown crops were mainly sunflower and corn which both were cultivated
    once a year (June–October) (Fig. 1(c–d)). Download : Download high-res image (1MB)

    data Currently, the optical remote sensing satellites used for soil water and
    salt content estimation include WorldView-2 (Vermeulen & van Niekerk, 2016), ASCAT
    (Lindell & Long, 2016), MODIS (Paliwal et al., 2019), Landsat series (Landsat
    ETM+ and Landsat OLI) (Bannari & Al-Ali, 2020), GF-1 (Dong et al., 2019) and Sentinel-2
    (Ambrosone et al., 2020). Compared to other optical satellites, the Sentinel-2
    satellite covers more spectral reflectance at wavelengths (700–800 nm) and is
    sensitive to crop growth, and allows better specification in spatial resolution
    and revisit cycle (Uniyal et al., 2017). The multispectral images of Sentinel-2
    were downloaded from the European Space Agency (https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/browser/)
    and the acquisition time of these images were consistent with sampling time. Sentinel-2
    images were processed in three steps with SNAP and ENVI software: atmospheric
    correction, image cropping and image resampling. Eventually, spectral reflectance
    (spectral range was 443∼2202 nm) of multispectral images (spatial resolution was
    10∗10 m2) was obtained from processed Sentinel-2 satellite data. 2.2.2. Soil sampling
    Soil samples were collected in Huangjiqu during crop growing period (Jun∼September
    2019) (Table 1). The sampling sites of study area were chosen to enable adequate
    representatives of collected samples, with number of each sampling ranging from
    48 to 164 (Fig. 2). Sampling sites covered main crop (corn/sunflower) under various
    phonological periods and under various water and salt conditions (Fig. 1c–d).
    The five-points method was employed for each sampling site to make up the spatial
    mismatch between in-situ sampling and Sentinel-2 satellite data (Fig. 1(e)). The
    ranges of sampling depth were <20, 20–40 and >40–60 cm, respectively (Fig. 1(f)).

    and salt content of collected soil samples were obtained from laboratory experiments.
    Soil water content was determined by gravitation measurement, which indicated
    the mass percentage of water in a soil sample. Soil salt content was calculated
    from measured electric conductivity (EC, unit: mS/cm) of mixed soil solution (mass
    ratio of soil sample and purified water was 1:5) by using an empirical formula
    (i.e., soil salt content = 0.2882∗EC+0.0183). The responding mathematical distribution
    over study area were summarized in Table 2. Table 2. Distribution of soil salt

    retrieval In Hetao irrigation district, soil water, soil salt and water-salt coupling
    effects are the main factors affecting crop growth. Therefore, the study identified
    soil water, salt and water-salt interaction as three endmembers of vegetation
    spectrum, and used a linear spectral unmixing method to retrieve the abundance
    of each endmember. Decomposition of the mixed spectra and calculation of abundance
    were divided into three steps: water-salt spectrum correlation construction, pure
    endmember extraction and spectral linear unmixing. 2.3.1. Water-salt-spectrum
    correlation In the field of optical remote sensing, “triangles” or “trapezoids”
    two-dimensional spectral feature spaces are commonly used to estimate soil water
    under vegetation cover. Sadeghi et al.(2017) proposed the optical TRApezoid model
    (OPTRAM) based on the distribution of image pixels in STR-NDVI space. STR is the
    SWIR-transformed reflectance and NDVI is the normalized vegetation index difference.
    In this model, the correlation between soil water content and vegetation spectral
    characteristics in root zone is defined as (1) (2) (3) (4) where SM represents
    the soil water content; STRw and STRd represent the STR under saturated soil moisture
    conditions and dry conditions, respectively; RSWIR represents the spectral reflectance
    of SWIR region; bd and kd are intercept and slope of the dry edge and bw and kw
    are intercept and slope of the wet edge (Fig. 3(a)). Download : Download high-res
    image (1MB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Sketch illustrating parameters
    of the STR-NDVI space and the Reflectance-NDVI space. In the Hetao irrigation
    district, both soil water and salt conditions affect vegetation growth. Changes
    in water and salt content can lead to changes in the spectral characteristics
    of vegetation. Based on this fact, we assumed a nonlinear correlation between
    soil water and reflectance, soil salt and reflectance and developed the spatial
    distribution of spectral reflectance in NDVI into a binary quadratic regression
    model, i.e. (5) (6) (7) (8) where, Rλ is the spectral reflectance at wavelength
    λ.; Rλ,max and Rλ,min are the maximum and minimum values of spectral reflectance
    of specified NDVI respectively, expressed as vegetation health and stress boundary
    (e.g. Fig. 3(b–d); bmax and kmax are intercept and slope of health Boundaries;
    kmin and kmin are intercept and slope of stress Boundary; f (·) are empirical
    expressions of the correlation among soil water, salt and spectral reflectance;
    SM and SS represent soil water and salt content, respectively; a1,λ and a2,λ represent
    the first- and second-order coefficients between soil water and spectral reflectance;
    a3,λ and a4,λ represent the first- and second-order coefficients between soil
    salt and spectral reflectance; a5,λ represents the coefficients between soil water-salt
    interaction and spectral reflectance; a6,λ is a fixed constant. Therefore, quantitative
    correlation among spectral reflectance of wavelength λ, soil water and salt content
    can be determined by the following empirical equation. (9) 2.3.2. Pure endmember
    extraction In Eq. (5), soil water, salt and water-salt interaction are the main
    factors affecting the vegetation spectrum. In this study, the integral means was
    used to extract the three pure endmember: soil water, soil salt and water-salt
    interactions, which were calculated as follows: (10) (11) (12) (13) where, SMmax
    and SSmax are the maximum values of soil water and salt content, respectively;
    and SMmin and SSmin are the minimum values of soil water and salt content, respectively.
    2.3.3. Linear spectral unmixing The linear spectral unmixing (LSU) method was
    used to calculate the enmember abundance of each pixel. LSU assumes that the mixed
    spectrum is a linear combination of all enmember spectra within a pixel, and the
    enmember abundance reflects the proportion of the response of soil water, soil
    salt and water-salt interaction to the vegetation spectrum. The general equation
    of spectral linearity decomposition can be expressed as: (14) Two constraint conditions:
    (15) (16) Eq. (14) is organized as: (17) where, R ij, λ is reflectance at wavelength
    λ of pixel ij, i is the column pixel number and j is the line pixel number; f
    ij,n (n = 1,2,3) is fraction of endmember n contributing to the reflectance of
    pixel ij, and f ij,n can be solved by using a least-square method with fully constrained
    conditions; n is the total number of endmembers; R n,λ (n = 1,2,3) is the reflectance
    of endmember n at wavelength λ; and Eλ is the error at wavelength λ of the fit
    of total spectral endmembers. R SM,λ, R SS,λ and R SM∗SS,λ represent the soil
    water spectrum, soil salt spectrum and water-salt interaction spectrum at wavelength
    λ, respectively. And they reflect soil water information, salt information and
    water-salt interaction information in the mixed spectra, respectively. 2.4. Spectral
    index A linear decomposition technique was used to obtain soil water spectrum,
    soil salt spectrum and water-salt interaction spectrum from the mixed spectra
    of each pixel of images, to calculate spectral indices (vegetation indices, moisture
    indices and salinity indices) (Table 3). Moisture indices and salinity indices
    were used to estimate soil water and salt content, respectively. The vegetation
    indices reflected the growing conditions of vegetation under stress conditions
    and were used to estimate water-salt content. When estimating soil water content,
    the required spectrum was the water spectrum. When estimating soil salt content,
    required spectrum was salt spectrum. The R2 between spectral index and the water
    content or R2 between spectral index and salt content were used as evaluation
    criterion. Table 3. Selected spectra indices. Data Abbreviation Formula References

    machine learning methods used in this study were BP Neural Networks (BPNN), Partial
    Least Squares Regression(PLSR), Support Vector machines Regression(SVR), Random
    Forests Regression (RFR), Gradient Boost Regression Tree (GBRT), and eXtreme Gradient
    Boosting tree (XGboost). BPNN is a multilayer feed-forward neural network consisting
    of three parts: input, hidden and output layers (Rumelhart et al., 1986). PLSR
    finds the best functional match for a data set by minimizing the sum of squares
    of errors (Wold et al., n.d.). SVR is a theoretical method, to enhance generalization
    ability of a model by promoting the minimization of the upper bound of error,
    and the kernel function selected in this study was a radial basis kernel function
    with kernel function parameters and penalty coefficients filtered by Sequential
    Minimal Optimization (SMO) algorithm (Berueco et al., 2015). RFR is an integrated
    algorithm for discriminating and classifying data using multiple decision trees,
    which can improve prediction accuracy without a significant increase in computing
    power, and it is more robust in the absence of data and non-equilibrium (Breiman,
    1996). GBRT is a decision tree algorithm implemented by multiple iterations, which
    can flexibly handle continuous and discrete data and effectively prevent the overfitting
    condition(Friedman, 2001). Based on GBRT, XGBoost uses regularization terms to
    improve cost function and second-order Taylor formula to optimize the model, reducing
    model complexity and improving generalization capabilities (Jing et al., 2022).
    To ensure that training and validation sets can represent statistical data characteristics
    of the samples, Kennard-Stone (K-S) algorithm was used to divide total 505 soil
    samples into a modeling set (303 soil samples) and a validation set (202 soil
    samples) at a ratio of 3:2. The validation accuracy of the model was evaluated
    by coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE). The larger
    the R2, the smaller the RMSE, the better the model is. 3. Results 3.1. Spectral
    linear decomposition accuracy assessment and enmember abundance analysis Linear
    spectral unmixing method simulated the hybrid spectrum by calculating abundance
    of each enmember spectrum. Fig. 4(a) showed the reconstruction effect of the spectra
    of each band. The performance of Linear spectral unmixing method was stable and
    reliable, with R2 and RMSE between measured spectral reflectance and simulated
    spectral reflectance at each band ranging from 0.42 to 0.70 and 0.048 to 0.170
    respectively. This indicated that the vegetation spectral characteristics respond
    closely to changes in soil water and salt content, especially the spectral reflectance
    in red-edge range. Water Vapor and spectra of SWIR-Cirrus range were affected
    by water vapor in atmosphere, weakening the correlation between vegetation growth
    and soil salt, vegetation growth and soil water, and leading to a lower accuracy
    (R2 = 0.42–0.49; RMSE = 0.097–0.105). The endmember abundance of the image pixel
    spectrum was determined by Eqs. (14), (15), (16), and the pattern of changes of
    image pixel spectrum with the changes of soil water-salt content was shown in
    Fig. 4(b–c). The water and salt content clearly affected the endmember abundance
    value. With the increase of soil water content, water abundance decreased from
    0.53 to 0.28, salt abundance varied steadily (0.21–0.36), and water-salt interactions
    abundance increased from 0.15 to 0.40. With the increase of soil salt content,
    water abundance decreased from 0.62 to 0.41, salt abundance increased from 0.26
    to 0.31, and abundance of water-salt interactions spectrum increased from 0.09
    to 0.28. The dynamic changes in abundance of each endmember indicated that spectral
    features of image pixels were able to effectively characterize the changes in
    soil water and salt content of farmland. Download : Download high-res image (392KB)

    unmixing method (LSU) and enmember abundance analysis. 3.2. Index construction
    of endmember spectra Each endmember spectra obtained from the linear decomposition
    results was used to calculate spectral indices and analyze water-salt correlation.
    The correlations between spectral indices and soil water, spectral indices and
    soil salt were quantified by using R2 (Fig. 5). Correlation analysis showed that
    all the spectral indices could effectively reflect the soil water and salt content
    (R2 = 0.33∼0.62, p < 0.01). For soil salt, the spectral indices with R2 ranked
    in the top 8 were SI-10 (R2 = 0.62), SI-4 (R2 = 0.61), SI-8 (R2 = 0.59), MCARI
    (R2 = 0.58), NDI (R2 = 0.57), NDRE (R2 = 0.57), VARI(R2 = 0.54)and SI-9(R2 = 0.53).
    For soil water, the spectral indices with R2 ranked in the top 8 were CIG (R2
    = 0.61), GRVI (R2 = 0.61), VARI (R2 = 0.60), ARVI (R2 = 0.60), TCARI (R2 = 0.56),
    GVMI (R2 = 0.56), NDRE (R2 = 0.55) and NDVIgb(R2 = 0.54). Repeated application
    of the same band in calculating spectral indices could cause linear phenomena,
    therefore further screening for variables was needed to reduce the collinearity
    among spectral indices. After selection, the best combinations of spectral indices
    for estimating soil water content were CIG, ARVI, TCARI, GVMI, NDRE and NDVIgb,
    and the optimal combinations of spectral indices for estimating soil salt content
    were SI-10, MCARI, NDI, NDRE, VARI and SI-9. The optimal combination of spectral
    indices ensured a relatively low collinearity among indices (R2 = 0.37∼0.48).
    NDRE was calculated from spectra in near-infrared and red-edge ranges and was
    used to estimate chlorophyll content of vegetation leaves (Gitelson et al., 2003).
    As a spectral index for soil water and salt content estimation, NDRE could effectively
    express the physiological response of crops to water and salt stress (Ahmad et
    al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2018). Download : Download high-res image (311KB) Download

    content estimation. 3.3. Performance of soil water-salt content estimation The
    best combination of spectral indices selected in subsection 3.2 was used as input
    variables and the corresponding soil water and salt content were used as output
    variables, and soil water-salt content estimation models were established based
    on BPNN, PLSR, SVR, RFR, XGBoost, and GBRT algorithms. The suitability of the
    six machine learning algorithms was evaluated using RMSE and R2 (Fig. 6). In the
    validation set of soil water, XGBoost algorithm had the lowest RMSE (1.77%) and
    the highest R2 (0.74), with the best estimation performance, followed by GBRT,
    RFR, SVR, BPNN, and PLSR. In validation set of soil salt, GBRT algorithm had the
    lowest RMSE (0.11) and the highest R2 (0.67), with the best estimation performance,
    followed by XGBoost, RFR, BPNN, PLSR, and SVR. As the first traditional machine
    learning algorithm used in the field of quantitative remote sensing inversion,
    PLSR combines principal component analysis and canonical correlation analysis
    to reduce the effect of collinearity among independent variables. However, the
    model accuracy decreased when the degree of collinearity exceeds the PLSR dimensionality
    reduction limit. The learning process of BPNN neural network was mapping to a
    new feature space from low to high layer-by-layer. Although BPNN network structure
    required many parameters, sufficient number of samples (modeling set 303, validation
    set 202) ensured the learning effect, and the accuracy was better than PLSR. However,
    BPNN relied the setting of network parameters and was susceptible to over-learning
    problems. SVR, with strong generalization capability, is to seek the optimal solution
    of a problem with the goal of controlling the overall error. It avoided local
    optimal solution, and estimation accuracy of modeling sets and validation sets
    were same. RFR, GBRT and XGBoost were improved algorithms based on decision tree
    regression algorithms, and their estimation accuracy were all higher than the
    above three traditional machine learning algorithms. RFR constructed multiple
    decision trees with the idea of bagging for training randomly selected data and
    making prediction. RFR model didn''t not require the selection of feature variables.
    RFR was insensitive to collinearity, and has good noise reducing capability. GBRT
    based on boosting idea used a serial approach to build multiple decision trees
    and integrated the decision trees with gradient boosting method, and it''s estimation
    accuracy was better than RFR. Based on GBRT, XGBoost optimized cost function for
    reducing the complexity of decision trees and enhancing generalization capability
    of the model. Compared with GBRT, XGBoost had better model stability and less
    difference in estimation accuracy of modeling and validation sets. Considering
    both estimation accuracy and stability, XGBoost was more suitable for soil water-salt
    content estimation of farmland in the study area. The performance of soil water-salt
    content estimation models constructed based on XGBoost were further evaluated
    (Fig. 7). Model performance showed differences in crop type and fertile phase.
    The soil water estimation accuracy of sunflower (R2 = 0.76; RMSE = 1.58%) was
    better than that of corn (R2 = 0.65; RMSE = 1.98%), while the salt content estimation
    accuracy of sunflower (R2 = 0.65; RMSE = 0.13%) was lower than that of corn (R2
    = 0.72; RMSE = 0.09%). This difference may be related to the salt tolerances of
    the crop. As a salt-tolerant crop, sunflower was more sensitive to soil water
    than soil salt. Corn was more sensitive to soil salt compared to sunflower. For
    sunflower, the accuracy of water and salt content estimation for different fertile
    phases were ranked from high to low: Squaring, Maturation and Seeding. For corn,
    the accuracy of water content estimation for different fertile phases was ranked
    from high to low: Heading, Milk maturation and Seeding emergency, and the accuracy
    of salt content estimation was ranked from high to low: Heading, Seeding emergency
    and Milk maturation. In general, the accuracy of water content estimation was
    relatively low at early stage of growth of crop (Seeding or Seeding emergency)
    (Corn:R2 = 0.42, RMSE = 2.28%; Sunflower:R2 = 0.61, RMSE = 3.19%). Due to the
    low vegetation coverage, spectral reflectance was actually the mixture of soil
    and vegetation spectral reflectance. Soil background (e.g., soil organic matter)
    may distort the originally constructed correlation between spectral reflectance
    and water content, and add error to water-salt content estimation. Download :

    content changes during crop growth period The spatial distribution of soil water-salt
    content was shown in Fig. 8, Fig. 9. The water-salt content of farmland during
    crop growing period had strong temporal variability. In June, water and salt content
    in the experimental area were over 17.71% (Fig. 8(a-b)) and below 0.25% (Fig.
    9(a-b)), respectively. In July and August, the decreased water content (<17.71%)
    and increased salt content (> 0.2∼0.5%) caused drought (Fig. 8(c-d)) and salt
    aggregation (Fig. 9(c-d)), respectively. In September, water and salt content
    were over 17.71% (Fig. 8(e-f)) and below 0.2% (Fig. 9(e-f)), respectively. Download

    9. The spatial-temporal variation of soil salt content during June ∼ September
    2019. From the overall variation, soil water and salt content over the experimental
    area decreased from 20.31% to 19.14% and increased from 0.09% to 0.12%, respectively
    (Fig. 10). From June 16 to August 20, an apparent decreasing tendency of water
    content was observed due to large water consumption driven by crop growth. Meanwhile,
    salt aggregation in the experimental area resulted from enhanced salt absorption
    effect of increased root depth in the course of crop growth. However, these problems
    were mitigated by timely irrigation (Chang et al., 2019). From August 20 to September
    27, water content increased from 16.18 to 19.14% and salt content decreased from
    0.17% to 0.12%, respectively. However, salt content exhibited rebound after irrigation
    to some extent (from September 22 to 27). This phenomenon indicated that a portion
    of salt from irrigation water remained in the soil due to the unsoil salt contentisfactory
    performance of local drainage (Blanc, 2020; Wang et al., 2020). Thus, local irrigation
    management was faced with a tradeoff between crop growth water requirement and
    salt-induced negative effect on crop growth (Chen et al., 2021; Xiong, Xu, Engel,
    Xiong, et al., 2021). Download : Download high-res image (173KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 10. Time series of soil water and salt content during June
    ∼ September 2019. 4. Discussion 4.1. Soil water-salt content change analysis Local
    agricultural production was family-based individual production with different
    crops grown on small adjacent farmland and every family follow different irrigation
    schemes (Xiong, Xu, Engel, Huang, et al., 2021). Farmland topography, groundwater,
    and soil texture further increased the complexity of spatial and temporal changes
    in soil water and salt content (Zhang, Han, et al., 2023; Zhang, Fan, et al.,
    2023; Zhang, Hou, et al., 2023). The spatial distribution of salt content showed
    an increasing trend from south to north, which might be related to the topography
    and burial depth of groundwater (Zhang et al., 2022). The topography of the study
    area was high in the south and low in the north, and both irrigation water and
    groundwater flow from south to north. Soil salts were carried to the soil tillage
    layer by groundwater mainly through phreatic evaporation. When the water table
    was shallow, the soil tillage layer was more susceptible to salt accumulation
    (Mao et al., 2017). Soil water content of sunflower and corn fluctuated from 15.7
    to 21.8% and 18.2–25.6%, respectively. This difference was related to irrigation
    system and crop water consumption (Xiong, Xu, Engel, Huang, et al., 2021). After
    irrigation, severe drought occurred in localized areas due to relatively fast
    water consumption rate (e.g., area I in Fig. 6(d)). Soil salt content of sunflower
    was significantly higher than that of corn due to human activities. In Hetao irrigation
    district, salt-sensitive corn and salt-tolerant sunflower were often grown in
    slightly saline or non-saline land, and moderately saline land, respectively (Ren
    et al., 2016). Compared to other months, the severe salinization was more easily
    observed in September (Fig. 9(e–f)). The reduced effectiveness of salt control
    might be due to relatively weaker salt uptake capacity of crop root system in
    later growth stages(Sreelash et al., 2017). Drainage ditches had the dual benefits
    of regulating soil salinity of farmland and water conservation, avoiding water
    deficit and water accumulation during non-irrigation and irrigation periods, respectively
    (Jia et al., 2011). Driven by irrigation water, soil salt usually flew from farmland
    to the drainage ditch. Slight and severe salinization could occur in farm land
    (Fig. 9(c–d)). This might be the results of inadequate drainage facilities. When
    the irrigation volume exceeds the drainage capacity of irrigation facilities in
    farmland (e.g., Zones II to III in Fig. 8(c)), salts in irrigation water will
    accumulate in soil because of evaporation (e.g., Zones III to II in Fig. 9(c)).
    If unsuitable irrigation is repeated (e.g., zones II to III in Fig. 8(d)), increasing
    salt accumulation will lead to more severe salinization (e.g., zones II to III
    in Fig. 9(d)). At the same time, canal leakage during water transportation in
    irrigation canal could lead to a rise in groundwater level, and strong evaporation
    could exacerbate the accumulation of soil salts (Mao et al., 2017). 4.2. Importance
    assessment of soil water-salt content estimation model factors The importance
    of factors of estimating soil water-salt content was estimated by using interpretable
    performance of decision trees (Fig. 11). In GBRT, the importance difference among
    the factors were small. The more the factors being considered when estimating
    soil water-salt content, the higher the complexity of this model. While in RFR,
    the importance difference among the factors were large, and the fewer the factors
    being considered when estimating soil water-salt content, the lower the utilization
    of spectral information. The bands with high importance were mainly red-edge and
    near-infrared bands, which was consistent with the findings of previous studies
    (Ballester et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2021). NDRE had a high weight in all the
    three algorithms and had an irreplaceable role for soil water-salt content estimation
    in farmland. And it was less sensitive to soil background changes and was sensitive
    to vegetation physiological stress responses and biomass, which was beneficial
    for water and salt stress detection in early stages of crops (Thompson et al.,
    2020). The SWIR bands used in SI-10 were closely correlated with vegetation transpiration
    rate and stomatal conductance, and were often used to estimate vegetation water
    content and diagnose vegetation water deficit status. Soil salt stress could affect
    physiological processes like water uptake of vegetation roots and transpiration
    of leaves. In salt content estimation, SI-10 showed the highest importance, indicating
    that crops in irrigation areas were more susceptible to salt stress, and the effects
    caused by salt stress were higher than those caused by water stress. In contrast,
    SI-9 and VARI were relatively less important, which was also related to their
    correlation with soil salt content. This might be due to soil salt contenturation
    of red band after canopy close under severe stress. And low greenness might also
    result in low reflectance of green band, which was more suitable for monitoring
    growth of healthy vegetation (Zhu et al., 2021). The importance of the spectral
    index NDRE, calculated from the red edge and near infrared bands, showed the highest
    importance in soil water content estimation, which was consistent with previous
    research findings (Easterday et al., 2019). GVMI was closely related to vegetation
    water content with a secondary importance performance (Yue et al., 2019). When
    the crop was subjected to continuous water stress, the red edge parameters showed
    a shift to blue edge (Ren et al., 2022). Importance performance of TCARI and ARVI
    were good and TCARI and ARVI were suitable for characterizing response of crop
    to different soil water conditions. Download : Download high-res image (213KB)

    boundaries of reflectance-NDVI spectral space In this research, the Reflectance-NDVI
    space was developed to express the correlation between soil water and spectrum,
    soil salt and spectrum (Eqs (5), (6), (7) in Section 2.3.1). In this method, the
    upper and lower boundaries of spectra space were obtained from visually best fit.
    The failure to determine boundaries with rigorous mathematical definition may
    introduce an uncertainty to estimation (Ambrosone et al., 2020; Babaeian et al.,
    2021; Sadeghi et al., 2017). For this limitation, Babaeian et al.(2021) randomly
    generated visually-fit boundaries with fixed errors (i.e., ±5%, ±10%, ±15%, and
    ±20%). By comparing the effectiveness of all boundaries (best-fit and random-fit
    boundaries) in estimation, uncertainties of fitting methods were qualified. Another
    research suggested that nonlinear boundaries can achieve better visual fit compared
    with linear boundaries. Ambrosone et al.(2020) applied the curves defined by exponential
    function to fit boundaries, and emphasized the advantages of these nonlinear boundaries
    in estimations. As was mentioned above, the potential uncertainties from boundaries
    using different methods should be thoroughly considered. Thus, on the basis of
    existing visually best-fit boundary, additional boundaries were generated, which
    included four linear boundaries with fixed errors and a nonlinear boundary (Fig.
    3). By comparing the difference among the existing estimations (Fig. 7) and newly
    generated estimations from additional boundaries, effect of uncertain boundaries
    on the estimation was clarified (Fig. 12). The estimation errors caused by uncertain
    boundaries were acceptable (soil water content:R2 = 0.65∼0.78, RMSE = 0.77∼4.22%;
    soil salt content:R2 = 0.65∼0.78, RMSE = 0.06∼0.20%). Compared with linear fitting,
    nonlinear fitting approach produced lower visual bias in fitting boundaries, but
    failed to estimate soil water and salt content better. The remote estimations
    of soil water and salt content were not sensitive to boundaries, which suggested
    general applicability of spectra-space method used in this research. Download

    fitted boundaries. 4.4. Potential of hybrid method for practical application In
    arid and semi-arid agricultural regions affected by soil salt, the crop usually
    suffers from water and salt stress. In this study, the free-access Sentinel-2
    soil salt contentellite images were used to evaluate the spatiotemporal variations
    of soil water-salt from farmland in an irrigation region. Remote sensing technology
    allows soil water-salt measurement to cut down on costs and increase productivity.
    Importantly, we proposed a hybrid method of Linear Spectral Unmixing (LSU) and
    machine learning algorithms, which has the ability to consider the impact of soil
    water-salt interaction on crop spectral information. The accurate remote estimation
    of soil water and salt content provide scientific data support for local water
    management and soil saline prevent (Fig. 8, Fig. 9, Fig. 10). The adapted LSU
    and machine learning algorithms are currently the mainstream methods and the most
    widely used. Thus, the proposed hybrid method is a practicably strategy and holds
    true for other salt-affected regions of the world. It is worth emphasizing that
    our result reveals some further research work. On one hand, the proposed hybrid
    method can be extend to other remote sensing platforms (small, medium and large-scale).
    For example, in recent years, the application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
    in smallholder farms has increased, and our study contribute to the UAV application
    in precision agriculture. On the other hand, the proposed method can also be extended
    and used for other field management strategies (e.g. water-nitrogen management)
    (Mwinuka et al., 2022). 5. Conclusion In salt affected irrigation region area,
    the timely and accurate monitoring of soil water-salt within cropland has significance
    for the water resources management and soil saline prevention. The complex soil
    and groundwater conditions, together with irrigation management, led to strong
    spatial-temporal variability of soil water-salt content. These factors exacerbated
    the complexity of crop spectral information and made it difficult to accurately
    estimate soil water and salt from mixed spectra. To address this issue, in this
    study, the hybrid method of Linear Spectral Unmixing (LSU) and machine learning
    algorithms was proposed for the simultaneous estimation of soil water and salt
    content. By LSU, the crop spectra from Sentinel-2 multispectral images was separated
    into endmember spectra (water, salt and water-salt), diminishing the impact of
    the water-salt interaction on crop spectral behavior. Based on endmember spectra,
    machine learning algorithms were used to construct soil water-salt content estimation
    model, in which XGBoost algorithm had the best performance (Fig. 6, Fig. 7). The
    mapping of soil water-salt within irrigated cropland revealed the evolution of
    water-salt content due to crop growth and irrigation management (Fig. 8, Fig.
    9, Fig. 10). Fragmentation of planting structures, inadequate irrigation facilities
    and inadequate drainage facilities increased the spatio-temporal variability of
    soil water-salt distribution. Our results demonstrate that the hybrid method of
    LSU and machine learning is a practical strategy for vegetated soil water-salt
    content estimation. The proposed strategy can be extended to other salt-affected
    region of the word and remote sensing platforms (e.g., UAV, airplane, in-situ
    sensor). At the same time, the applicability of this strategy to other field management
    (e.g. water-nitrogen management) can be further explored. Financial support The

  description: 'Agriculture provides for the most basic needs of humankind: food and
    fiber. The introduction of new farming techniques in the past century (e.g., during
    the Green Revolution) has helped agriculture keep pace with growing demands for
    food and other agricultural products. However, further increases in food demand,
    a growing population, and rising income levels are likely to put additional strain
    on natural resources. With growing recognition of the negative impacts of agriculture

    Figures Versions Notes Abstract Agriculture provides for the most basic needs
    of humankind: food and fiber. The introduction of new farming techniques in the
    past century (e.g., during the Green Revolution) has helped agriculture keep pace
    with growing demands for food and other agricultural products. However, further
    increases in food demand, a growing population, and rising income levels are likely
    to put additional strain on natural resources. With growing recognition of the
    negative impacts of agriculture on the environment, new techniques and approaches
    should be able to meet future food demands while maintaining or reducing the environmental

    Abstract 1. Introduction Agriculture, an engine of economic growth for many nations,
    provides the most basic needs of humankind: food and fiber [1,2]. Technological
    changes during the past century, such as the Green Revolution, have transformed
    the face of agriculture [3]. The improved crop varieties, synthetic fertilizers,
    pesticides, and irrigation during the 1960s–1980s, known as the Green Revolution
    or third agricultural revolution, enhanced crop productivity and food security,
    especially in developing nations [4]. Consequently, despite the doubling population
    and tripling food demand since the 1960s, global agriculture has been able to
    meet the demands with only a 30% expansion in the cultivated area [4,5]. The demand
    for food and agricultural products is projected to further increase by more than
    70% by 2050 [6]. Given the limited availability of arable land, a significant
    part of this increased demand will be met through agricultural intensification,
    i.e., increased use of fertilizers, pesticides, water, and other inputs. However,
    intensified use of agricultural inputs also causes environmental degradation,
    including groundwater depletion, reduced surface flows, and eutrophication [7,8,9,10,11].
    Excessive and/or inefficient use of natural resources (e.g., soil and water),
    fertilizers, and pesticides for agricultural production cause economic losses
    as well as increased water and nutrient losses from agriculture that lead to environmental
    degradation [12]. For an economically and environmentally sustainable production
    system, there is a need to develop techniques that can increase crop production
    through increased efficiency of inputs use and reduced environmental losses [13].
    Precision agriculture (PA) is a key component of sustainable agricultural systems
    in the 21st century [13,14]. PA has been defined in multiple ways, yet the underlying
    concept remains the same [15]. PA entails a management strategy that uses a suite
    of advanced information, communication, and data analysis techniques in the decision
    making process (e.g., application of water, fertilizer, pesticide, seed, fuel,
    labor, etc.), which helps enhancing crop production and reducing water and nutrient
    losses and negative environmental impacts [16,17,18,19,20]. Information-based
    management, site-specific crop management, target farming, variable rate technology,
    and grid farming are some other names used synonymously for PA [15,21]. In addition
    to crop production, PA has been used in viticulture, horticulture, pasture, and
    livestock production and management [18,22]. Presently, agriculture can be considered
    to be going through a fourth revolution facilitated mainly by advances in information
    and communication technologies [23]. Emerging technologies, such as remote sensing,
    global positioning systems (GPS), geographic information systems (GIS), Internet
    of Things (IoT), Big Data analysis, and artificial intelligence (AI) are promising
    tools being utilized to optimize agricultural operations and inputs aimed to enhance
    production and reduce inputs and yield losses [13,24,25]. Several IoT technology
    systems utilizing cloud computing, wireless sensors networks, and big data analysis
    have been developed for smart farming operations such as automated wireless-controlled
    irrigation systems and intelligent disease and pest monitoring and forecasting
    systems [24,25]. AI techniques, including machine learning (e.g., artificial neural
    networks) have been used to estimate ET, soil moisture, and crop predictions for
    automated and precise application of water, fertilizer, herbicide, and insecticides
    [23]. These technologies and tools enable farmers to characterize spatial variability
    (e.g., soils) among farms and large crop fields that negatively affect crop growth
    and yields [21]. These state-of-the-art technologies for the development and implementation
    of site-specific management are integral part of PA [16]. Remote sensing systems,
    using information and communication technologies, usually generate a large volume
    of spectral data due to high spatial/spectral/radiometric/temporal resolutions
    needed for application in PA [26]. Emerging data processing techniques such as
    Big Data analysis, artificial intelligence, and machine learning have been utilized
    to draw useful information from the large volume of data [27]. Also, cloud computing
    systems have been used to store, process, and distribute/utilize such a large
    amount of data for applications in PA [28,29,30]. All these advanced data acquisitions
    and processing techniques have been applied globally, to aid the decision-making
    process for field crops, horticulture, viticulture, pasture, and livestock [27,31,32,33,34,35,36].
    In the past, several studies have provided reviews of remote sensing techniques
    and applications in agriculture. While some studies focused on specific application
    areas such as soil properties estimation [37], evapotranspiration (ET) estimation
    [38,39], and disease and pest management [40], others included more than one area
    of applications [41,42,43]. Many of these studies reflected the state of the art
    of remote-sensing-based techniques along with their limitations and future challenges
    for application in agriculture. Some of these notable efforts include Mulla et
    al. [42], Weiss et al. [43], Maes and Steppe [44], and Angelopoulou et al. [45].
    The primary purpose of this review is to complement these efforts to provide a
    comprehensive background and knowledge on applications of remotely sensed data
    and technologies in agriculture, focusing on precision agriculture. Specifically,
    we provide an overview of remote sensing systems, techniques, and applications
    in irrigation management, nutrients management, disease and pest management, and
    yield estimation along with a synthesis table of vegetation indices used for a
    variety of applications in PA. The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
    Section 2 describes the types of remote sensing systems covering different sensors
    and platforms used for applications in PA. Section 3 provides a brief history
    of applications of remote sensing in agriculture with a focus on PA. Section 4
    discusses some popularly used vegetation indices derived from remote sensing data
    and their applications in PA. Section 5 has five sub-sections discussing recent
    applications of remote sensing in PA for (i) irrigation water management, (ii)
    nutrient management, (iii) disease management, (iv) weed management, and (v) crop
    monitoring and yield. Particularly, in Section 5, we focus our review/discussion
    on studies published during 2015–2020. The final section in the paper discusses
    the progress made, needs, and challenges for applications of remote sensing in
    PA. 2. Remote Sensing Systems Used in Precision Agriculture Remote sensing systems
    used for PA, and agriculture in general, can be classified based on (i) sensor
    platform and (ii) type of sensor. Sensors are typically mounted on satellites,
    aerial, and ground-based platforms (Figure 1). Since the 1970s, satellite products
    have been extensively used for PA. Recently, aerial platforms, which include aircraft
    and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are also used in PA. Ground-based platforms
    used for PA can be grouped into three categories: (i) hand-held, (ii) free standing
    in the field, and (iii) mounted on tractor or farm machinery. Ground-based systems
    are also referred to as proximal remote sensing systems because they are located
    in close proximity to the target surface (land surface or plant) as compared to
    aerial or satellite-based platforms. Figure 1. A typical layout for the remote,
    aircraft, and ground sensing systems deployed for precision agriculture. SMAP
    = Soil Moisture Active Passive; PA = Precision Agriculture; SM = Soil Moisture;
    UAV = Unmanned Aerial Vehicle; EM = Electromagnetic. (UAV photo credit—Dr. Ripendra
    Awal, PVAMU, Prairie View, TX, USA). Sensors used for remote sensing differ based
    on the spatial, spectral, radiometric, and temporal resolution they offer [46].
    Spatial resolution of a sensor is defined by the size of the pixel that represents
    the area on the ground. Sensors with high spatial resolution tend to have small
    footprints, and sensors with large footprints tend to have a low spatial resolution.
    Temporal resolution can be considered to be associated with the sensor platform
    rather than the sensor itself. For example, temporal resolution for a satellite
    is the time it takes to complete an orbit and revisit the same observation area.
    Spectral resolution of a sensor is indicated by the number of bands captured in
    the given range of electromagnetic spectrum [47]. Hyperspectral images contain
    a large number (10s to 100s) of contagious bands of narrow width (<20 nm) separated
    by small increments in wavelength [48]. Numerous vegetation indices and statistical
    and machine learning approaches, such as deep convolutional neural network and
    random forest, have been applied to reduce the dimensionality of hyperspectral
    data to extract useful information on crop conditions [49,50,51]. More recently,
    quantification of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from hyperspectral
    images has increasingly been applied to estimate photosynthesis, plant nutrients,
    and biotic and abiotic stresses such as disease and water stress [49,50,51,52,53,54].
    Although numerous recent satellites provide high spatial (<5 m) and temporal (daily)
    resolution images, most publicly available satellite products are rather coarse
    for many PA applications. Appropriate spatio-temporal resolution required for
    PA depends on several factors including management objectives, size of the field,
    and the ability of farm equipment to vary the inputs (irrigation, fertilizer,
    pesticide, etc.) application rates. Crop biomass and yield estimation typically
    require higher spatial resolution (1–3 m) compared to variable rate fertilizer
    and irrigation (5–10 m) applications [42]. Furthermore, weed mapping and variable
    herbicide application require spatial resolution that is finer than the weed patches
    (e.g., 5–50 cm) [55,56]. Aerial platforms such as UAVs generally provide higher
    spatial resolution (<5 m) images as compared to the satellites. Thus, UAVs and
    other ground-based platforms offer greater flexibility in providing images at
    fine spatial and temporal resolution (more frequent) or as needed. Sensors mounted
    on satellites, airplanes, and UAVs are generally passive sensors, i.e., they do
    not have their own light source. However, some of the satellites have active sensors
    onboard, such as the active microwave instrument (AMI) on the ERS-1/2. Many of
    the ground-based remote sensing platforms have active proximity sensors. For example,
    commercially available variable fertilizer rate application systems such as Green
    Seeker and Crop Circle have active proximity sensors. In such systems, variations
    in daylight have minimum effect on measured reflectance, thus providing more accurate
    and reproducible normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) or other vegetation
    indices (VI) used for crop nutrient status assessment. Two other sensors (thermal
    infrared and microwave) mounted on recent satellites are increasingly being used
    in agriculture. Thermal infrared sensors measure energy emitted from a target
    (e.g., crops) to estimate its temperature, which could be further used to estimate
    crop water stress, ET, and irrigation requirements [57]. Microwave sensors work
    in a similar way as the thermal sensors to measure the emitted energy (although
    in longer microwave wavelengths) from the land surface. Microwave sensors are
    mainly used to estimate soil moisture contents and crop water use over large areas
    [58]. Also, microwaves can penetrate through clouds, which is advantageous over
    other types of sensors that use visible and NIR wavelengths. However, coarse spatial
    resolution (10s of km) of the microwave satellite sensors, especially passive
    sensors, limits their application in PA. Recently, many methods have been developed
    and used to downscale passive microwave data to a finer resolution for use in
    PA [59,60,61,62]. Active microwave sensors (e.g., synthetic aperture radar—SAR)
    generally offer a higher spatial resolution; however, they are also more sensitive
    to surface roughness (e.g., vegetation) that can introduce errors in soil moisture
    estimation. Overall, there are a variety of remote sensors and platforms available
    that can be used to generate high-resolution (spatial, spectral, radiometric,
    and temporal) images critical to develop and implement site-specific management.
    3. Historical Applications of Remote Sensing in Agriculture Researchers have long
    recognized the need to map soil and land use databases for sustainable management
    of natural resources at local, regional, and national scale [63,64]. Knowledge
    of soil physical, biological, and chemical properties is important to design and
    implement irrigation, drainage, nutrient, and other crop management strategies,
    which are essential components of PA. Similarly, land use mapping can help assess
    the impacts of existing management and policy at regional to national scale. A
    traditional approach of using remote sensing techniques in agriculture has been
    around even before 1958, when the term “remote sensing” was first introduced [65].
    For example, aerial photography has been used to map soils, land use, and crop
    conditions in the United States during the 1930 and 1940s [66]. However, these
    conventional methods of soil mapping and land use classification (e.g., low altitude
    photography and ground crews) typically involve extensive fieldwork and laboratory
    analysis, which are expensive and time-consuming [67,68]. Advent of satellite
    remote sensing during later years facilitated more efficient and effective mapping
    of land use and land cover at regional, national, and global scales. Launch of
    Vanguard 2 and TIROS 1 in 1959 and 1960, respectively, marked the start of satellite
    remote sensing for meteorological information [69]. However, the era of satellite
    remote sensing for agriculture started with the launch of Landsat 1 (formerly
    known as the Earth Resources Technology Satellite—ERTS) on 23 July 1972 by the
    National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). NASA and the US Department
    of the Interior through the US Geological Survey (USGS) jointly manage the Landsat
    program. After Landsat 1, a series of Landsat satellites (Landsat 2–8) were launched
    to provide high quality images to researchers, land managers, and policy makers
    to help in the management of natural resources globally (Table 1). Images acquired
    from Landsat have been used for land use classification, crop classification,
    and monitoring and irrigation water requirement estimations in many parts of the
    world [70,71,72,73,74,75]. Later, in 1984, the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper was launched
    to collect higher resolution (30 m) images in more bands in visible and NIR region.
    Currently, the USGS-NASA is planning to launch Landsat 9 (resolution 30 m, 100
    m) by mid-2021. In 1986 and 1988, France and India also launched the SPOT 1 and
    IRS-1A satellites, respectively (Table 1). Table 1. Spatiotemporal resolutions
    of the satellite sensors used for precision agricultural (PA) applications. Satellites
    that provide high spatial (<30 m) and temporal resolutions (e.g., daily) are more
    suitable for PA. Satellite products from these missions were used for land use
    and crop classification in many large regions of the world. In addition, satellite
    products are used to monitor soil health, vegetation health, and hydrologic and
    climatic parameters, which are important for PA (e.g., soil organic carbon, soil
    moisture, NDVI, leaf area index (LAI), groundwater, and rainfall). Use of the
    satellite images proved to be cost-effective compared to aerial photography previously
    used for land use classification over large regions. However, coarse spatiotemporal
    resolution satellite products are not quite adequate for many PA applications.
    Satellites adequate for PA, such as IKONOS, were launched in the late 1990s. IKONOS,
    launched in 1999, collected imageries at 4-m spatial resolution in visible and
    NIR bands with a revisit period of up to five days [42]. Imageries collected from
    IKONOS have been used for multiple purposes in PA, including soil mapping, crop
    growth and yield prediction, nutrient management, and ET estimation [77,85,86,87].
    Launching of numerous nanosatellite constellations during later years addressed
    further limitations associated with spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution
    of the satellite imagery [110]. Nanosatellite constellations consist of a large
    number of small satellites with compact sensors that are cheaper and replaceable
    [91]. Nanosatellites and other satellites launched after 2000, such as GeoEye-1
    (2008), Pleiades-1A (2011), Worldview-3 (2014), SkySat-2 (2014), and Superview-1
    (2018), collect multispectral images at a high spatial resolution of ≤2 m with
    a daily or sub-daily revisit period. Pleiades-1A and Worldview-3 have been used
    for many PA applications requiring high spatial resolution imagery, including
    disease and crop water stress detection [118,119,120]. To take advantage of a
    wide variety of publicly available satellite data, several data fusion approaches
    have been proposed to combine high/moderate spatial resolution data with high
    temporal resolution data (and vice-versa) to generate high spatial–temporal resolution
    data products [121,122]. Satellite data with moderate spatial resolution but high
    temporal resolution (e.g., Sentinel 2) can also be used with reference ground
    truth data to help develop PA decision support systems [112]. Despite significant
    advances in spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution of satellite sensors, the
    use of satellite images is still limited in commercial agriculture production.
    Limited flexibility in on-demand imaging solutions, high costs, cloud cover restriction,
    and lack of automated or established frameworks for image analysis and application
    are factors affecting large-scale adoption of satellite imageries in PA [123].
    These limitations have promoted interest in low-cost proximal remote sensing techniques,
    including UAVs. Use of UAVs and hand-held, tractor-mounted, and other sensors
    mounted on farm machinery (e.g., spray boom, fertilizer applicator) has increased
    tremendously during the last two decades. UAVs with multispectral, hyperspectral,
    and thermal sensors can provide on-demand information at a spatial scale necessary
    for PA operations. Getting continuous or frequent satellite scanning during a
    crop growing season can be problematic due to cloud cover and/or other limitations/uncertainties
    associated with the sensor platform (e.g., revisit period) [124]. However, UAVs
    can be flown multiple times during a growing season to acquire information on
    a cm-scale as required. Most satellites do not offer the data at cm-scale needed
    for many field-scale PA applications such as weed mapping and disease detection
    [125,126]. Unprecedented availability of low-cost UAVs is likely to change the
    face of PA in the future. The average size of a farm in the United States was
    179 ha in 2018 [127] and is even smaller in other countries [126]. Acquiring high
    spatial resolution images obtained from commercial satellites can be expensive,
    especially for small farms, as many of these images are not available for free.
    In addition, flying airplanes to obtain such images may be cost-prohibitive for
    small farms. Images acquired from UAVs offer a low cost alternative to expensive
    airplane and satellite products [126]. Although the cost of utilizing UAVs (including
    equipment cost, data processing, and software) at a commercial scale is likely
    to be a sizable investment for limited resources farmers, continuous development
    of low-cost sensor technologies and input-production cost savings and/or benefits
    are likely to outweigh these costs in the future [128,129]. Growth in the development
    and use of UAVs has enabled the acquisition of high spatial, spectral, and temporal
    resolution data needed to implement PA management at a crop field or farm scale.
    Multispectral, high spatial resolution data acquired with UAVs could also be used
    with available satellite data for scale-up applications over large areas [130].
    4. Vegetation Indices Solar radiation reflected by plants depends on the chemical
    and morphological characteristics of the plant. Plant type, water content, and
    canopy characteristics affect the light reflected in each spectral band differently.
    Measured reflected light in ultraviolet, visible (blue, green, red), and near-
    and mid-infrared portions of the spectrum has commonly been used to develop various
    vegetation indices that provide useful information on plant structure and conditions
    [131] (Table 2). Vegetation indices are mathematical expressions that combine
    measured reflectance in many spectral bands to produce a value that helps assess
    crop growth, vigor, and several other vegetation properties such as biomass and
    chlorophyll content [132]. Mapping of these indices can help understand spatio-temporal
    variability in crop conditions, which is crucial for PA applications. Table 2.
    Some recently used vegetation indices for remote sensing applications in precision
    agriculture *. Popularly used vegetation indices such as normalized difference
    vegetation index (NDVI), green NDVI (GNDVI), and soil adjusted vegetation index
    (SAVI) (Table 2) utilize the fact that within the visible range of spectrum, plant
    reflectance is low in blue and red regions, while it peaks in the green region
    (Figure 2). Plant pigments, mainly chlorophyll and carotenoids, adsorb strongly
    in the visible part of the spectrum except for the green region. However, such
    strong adsorption does not occur in the NIR part of the spectrum, thus causing
    high reflectance in NIR region from green and healthy plants (Figure 2). The NDVI
    uses measured reflectance values in red and NIR regions to provide valuable information
    on crop growth (LAI, biomass), vigor, and photosynthesis (Table 2). The value
    of NDVI ranges from −1 to 1, where positive values indicate increasing greenness
    (LAI and vigor), and negative values indicate non-vegetated surfaces such as urban
    areas, bare soil/land, water, and ice. External factors to the vegetation conditions
    such as solar and viewing geometry, soil and crop residue on the land surface,
    and atmospheric effects may cause interferences in spectral signals [133]. NDVI
    is sensitive to confounding effects caused due to soils, atmosphere, cloud, and
    leaf canopy shadow that may result in erroneous information on crop or plant conditions
    [134,135]. In addition, NDVI is also known to be insensitive to changes in LAI
    and biomass after reaching a threshold (saturation), especially in dense vegetative
    conditions [136,137]. A large number of alternative indices have been developed
    to address these shortcomings in NDVI [135,138,139]. Some of the indices that
    address these limitations are the soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), atmospherically
    resistant vegetation index (ARVI), and wide dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI).
    Red edge based vegetation indices such as red-edge NDVI (RNDVI), normalized difference
    red edge (NDRE), and red edge difference vegetation index (REDVI) have been shown
    to perform better than NDVI in estimating plant nutrient status, LAI, and biomass
    in dense vegetation conditions such as those present during the later growth stages
    of corn [139,140,141,142]. Figure 2. Typical reflectance spectrum of (A) a healthy
    and a stressed plant (taken from Govaerts and Verhulst [143]) and (B) soil, water,
    and vegetation (taken from Mondal [82]). Measurement of reflectance or emissivity
    in near- and mid-infrared bands is particularly useful in developing indices that
    help to understand several intrinsic plant characteristics such as water content,
    pigments, sugar, carbohydrate, and protein contents [131]. Reflected or emitted
    radiation in thermal infrared bands is directly related to the plant temperature.
    Since plant temperature is related to plant transpiration rate, indices obtained
    from thermal/infrared reflectance data can be used to understand plant water status
    and other biotic and abiotic stresses such as disease [178,179]. In the past,
    many indices have been developed based on infrared and thermal reflectance or
    emission such as crop water stress index (CWSI) and shortwave infrared water stress
    index (SIWSI; Table 2). These indices have been used for a variety of applications
    in PA, including water stress and drought monitoring, soil moisture, plant disease,
    and crop yield estimations [57] (Table 2). 5. Applications 5.1. Irrigation Water
    Management Application time and rate of irrigation play an important role in mitigating
    crop water stress and achieving optimum crop growth and yield. A variety of irrigation
    management practices are used by farmers depending on many factors including water
    availability, existing water management infrastructure at the farm (e.g., storage
    and conveyance system, type of irrigation system), local/regional water laws,
    economic status, size of the farm, knowledge of farmer, and others [180,181].
    Many farmers apply uniform irrigation at regular intervals based on their prior
    knowledge or experience of farming, soils, and climate at the location [182].
    Large commercial farmers deploy soil moisture monitoring systems (wired or wireless
    moisture sensors) to irrigate (automatically or manually operation mode) based
    on the measured soil moisture data and crop/plant water requirements [183,184].
    Local and regional agricultural agencies may provide irrigation advisory services
    based on the observed climate and weather conditions in the area [185,186]. Almost
    all of these conventional farming practices do not consider the variability within
    a field and use a uniform irrigation rate for the entire field. Remote sensing
    data can help discern the variability within the field and apply variable rate
    irrigation with commonly used irrigation systems such as a center pivot. Variable
    rate application can help mitigate water stress arising from extreme wet and dry
    conditions to achieve uniformly high yields in all parts in the field while reducing
    water and nutrient losses [187,188]. Remote sensing images, collected multiple
    times during a growing season, are used to determine various indicators of crop
    water demand such as ET, soil moisture, and crop water stress. These indicators
    are used to estimate crop water requirement and schedule irrigation precisely.
    5.1.1. Water Stress Remote sensing products, either in optical, thermal, and microwave
    bands, have been used to develop and test multiple indices and techniques for
    precision water management [189] (Table 2). For example, normalized difference
    vegetation index (NDVI) and soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), developed from
    optical images, can be used to diagnose water stress and soil moisture conditions
    for many crops (Table 2). As shown in Table 2, these indices, combined with forecasted
    weather data, could be used for irrigation scheduling. Thermal remote sensing–based
    crop water stress index (CWSI) is a popular indicator used to estimate irrigation
    water demand and scheduling [57]. 𝐶𝑊𝑆𝐼=  ( 𝑇 𝑐 − 𝑇 𝑎 )− ( 𝑇 𝑐 − 𝑇 𝑎 ) 𝐿𝐿 ( 𝑇 𝑐
    − 𝑇 𝑎 ) 𝑈𝐿 − ( 𝑇 𝑐 − 𝑇 𝑎 ) 𝐿𝐿 where Tc is the canopy temperature extracted from
    thermal images, and Ta is the air temperature. LL and UL indicate the upper and
    lower limit of the difference in canopy and air temperature. Conceptually, the
    lower limit (LL) corresponds to the condition when the canopy is transpiring at
    the potential rate, and the upper limit (UL) corresponds to the condition when
    transpiration from the canopy is ceased. Multiple methods have been used to calculate
    the UL and LL of difference in canopy and air temperature, each having their own
    set of strengths and weaknesses [57]. CWSI has been extensively used for precision
    irrigation management in orchards [44,190]. For example, Katsigiannis et al. [123]
    used an autonomous multi-sensor (multi-spectral and thermal sensor) UAV system
    to develop CWSIs maps for irrigation scheduling and management in kiwi, pomegranate,
    and vine fields. However, some studies have indicated that more research is needed
    to establish climate-soil-crop specific trigger/threshold values to enable the
    use of CWSI for irrigation scheduling [191]. 5.1.2. Evapotranspiration (ET) Evapotranspiration
    (ET), the largest water flux from the Earth’s surface to the atmosphere, is a
    critical component of the hydrologic cycle and water balance. Conventional methods
    of ET measurement (e.g., weighing lysimeter and eddy covariance) are generally
    expensive and do not provide spatially variable ET estimates resulting from differences
    in land use, soils, topography and other hydrologic processes [192,193]. Remote
    sensing data is widely used to estimate ET, which is needed to determine crop
    water requirements to schedule irrigation [193,194,195]. ET estimation approaches,
    based on the remote sensing data, can be grouped into three categories: (i) surface
    energy balance, (ii) crop coefficient, and (iii) the Penman–Monteith method [193,194,196].
    Many studies in the past have provided a review of remote-sensing-based ET estimation
    techniques [39,192,197], including a recent review from Zhang et al. [198] that
    discussed the theories of development of several ET estimation approaches/methods
    along with their advantages and limitations. The surface energy balance approach
    has been extensively used for ET estimation in the past five years. Some of the
    studies have used hybrid methods to combine crop coefficient and energy balance
    approaches for ET estimation [195]. In a surface energy balance approach, net
    radiation flux (Rn), soil heat flux (G), and sensible heat flux (H) are typically
    calculated from remotely sensed data in visible, near-infrared and thermal infrared
    bands, while the latent heat flux ( 𝜆𝐸𝑇 ) is calculated as a reminder of the term
    in the energy balance equation [195,196]. 𝜆𝐸𝑇= 𝑅 𝑛 −𝐺−𝐻 Recently, Liou and Kar
    [192] and McShane et al. [197] provided a detailed review of various surface energy
    balance algorithms used for estimating landscape-scale ET at high spatial resolution
    and discussed their physical basis, assumptions, uncertainties, and limitations.
    Surface energy balance techniques use a variety of empirical and physically based
    models, input data, and assumptions to fully or partially solve the energy balance
    equation for ET estimation. Popularly used methods such as surface energy balance
    algorithm for land (SEBAL) and mapping ET at high resolution with internalized
    calibration (METRIC) fully solve the energy balance equation by determining the
    sensible heat flux (H) based on the identification of dry and wet pixels in the
    image [199]. Empirical constants derived from dry and wet pixels and measured
    radiometric surface temperature are then used to determine pixel-wise surface-air
    temperature difference and sensible heat-flux. In METRIC, a variant of SEBAL,
    net radiation is calculated using measured narrowband reflectance and radiometric
    surface temperature data, while soil heat flux is estimated using net radiation,
    surface temperature and vegetation indices [197]. Most of the surface energy balance
    methods typically use similar methods to calculate net radiation and soil heat
    flux; the major difference lies in the way sensible heat flux is calculated [200].
    The primary difference between METRIC and SEBAL is that the METRIC method uses
    reference ET data calculated from ground-based weather data to calibrate sensible
    heat and ET estimations obtained from the surface energy balance [199]. Surface
    energy balance methods are also classified based on the sensible heat sources;
    two-source energy balance methods account for the individual contributions of
    soil and vegetation to the total heat flux, while one-source methods do not distinguish
    between soil and vegetation [195]. Simpler surface energy balance methods, such
    as simplified surface energy balance index (S-SEBI) and the operational simplified
    energy balance model (SSEBop) does not require pixel-wise calculation of sensible
    heat flux and can thus be considered as partial surface energy balance models
    [199]. Recently, several studies have evaluated these energy balance approaches
    with satellite data (e.g., Landsat 7 and 8) to estimate ET for irrigation management
    in PA [201,202,203]. However, coarse spatio-temporal resolution of thermal satellite
    data limits the application of surface energy balance approaches in PA. More studies
    are needed to develop and evaluate downscaling techniques that can provide ET
    estimates at a spatio-temporal resolution necessary for irrigation scheduling
    in PA. Crop coefficient based approach for ET estimation involves developing a
    statistical relationship between a vegetation index (e.g., NDVI, SAVI) and basal
    crop coefficient (or crop coefficient). A product (ETref*Kc) of reference ET (ETref),
    estimated from weather data, and crop coefficient (Kc) provides an estimation
    of potential crop water requirements which can be used in a water balance model
    to determine irrigation water requirements [122,204,205,206,207]. In the third
    approach, crop biophysical parameters such as LAI, canopy height, and albedo,
    estimated from remotely sensed data, are used to determine unknown parameters
    in Penman-Monteith equation [196,208] for ET estimation. Calculated ET from these
    approaches is generally used in a soil water balance model to estimate crop irrigation
    requirements. Bhatti et al. [205] used Landsat 7 and 8 and UAV data to estimate
    crop coefficient based ET and variable rate irrigation (VRI) requirements for
    corn and soybean grown in Nebraska, USA. Similarly, Stone et al. [209] demonstrated
    that variable rate irrigation scheduling based on the NDVI derived crop coefficient
    and ET can provide corn yields similar to the other precision irrigation techniques
    relying on measured in-situ soil moisture data. Using crop parameters (LAI and
    albedo) derived from Sentinel 2A/B images, Bonfante et al. [210] calculated Penman–Monteith
    ET and time-variable irrigation requirements to demonstrate the application of
    a publicly available decision support system for maximizing corn yields in Italy.
    A large number of approaches exist for ET estimation based on the remote sensing
    data, each having its own set of advantages and limitations. Some surface energy
    balance approaches such as S-SEBI do not require any ground-based measurements,
    and thus, ET can be estimated solely based on the remote sensing data [192]. However,
    surface energy balance approaches work for only clear sky conditions and suffer
    from various uncertainties related to the retrieval/estimation of surface temperature,
    solar parameters, land surface variables (e.g., LAI, vegetation coverage, plant
    height) and other parameters due to uncertainties in surface emissivity, atmospheric
    corrections, diurnal variation and aerodynamic surface characteristics [192,198].
    In addition, ET estimates derived by solving the surface energy balance equations
    are instantaneous and require temporal extrapolation to generate daily or larger
    time step estimates using further assumptions and methods [198]. The Penman–Monteith
    approach, which uses a process-based model, can provide temporally continuous
    ET estimations. However, it requires several meteorological parameters that are
    not easily available at the needed spatio-temporal resolution. Studies have shown
    that surface energy balance methods such as METRIC and SSEBop provide reasonably
    accurate (80–95% accuracy) ET estimations on daily to seasonal/annual scales [197].
    Generally, ET estimation error of less than 1 mm/day can be considered to be reasonable
    [211]. However, it also depends on the crop and growth stage; higher accuracies
    (mm/day) are desirable during initial crop growth stages when ET is lower. However,
    the accuracy of many of these models (e.g., SEBAL) varies greatly from one spatial
    and temporal scale to another, making it difficult to quantify the uncertainty
    in ET estimation [194]. In order to advance the development of remote sensing
    based ET estimation approaches, further studies are needed to identify and characterize
    the spatio-temporal structure of uncertainties in the ET estimation due to forcing
    errors, process errors, and parametrization errors, among others [198]. Advanced
    approaches that use the knowledge developed from process-based physical models
    to complement the machine learning based surface energy balance methods need to
    be explored to develop more accurate and reliable ET estimates at a scale necessary
    for PA management [212]. 5.1.3. Soil Moisture Remote sensing data acquired in
    multiple bands, including optical, thermal, and microwave, have been used to estimate
    soil moisture globally [28,193,213]. Optical and thermal remote sensing data has
    been extensively used for soil moisture and ET estimations in an approach referred
    to as “triangle” or “trapezoid” or land surface temperature-vegetation index (LST-VI)
    method [198,214,215,216]. The triangle or LST-VI method is based on the physical
    relationship between the land surface temperature (and thus soil moisture and
    latent heat fluxes) and vegetative cover characteristics. Soil moisture estimation
    in this method is based on the interpretation of the pixel distribution in the
    LST-VI plot-space. If a sufficiently large number of pixels are present in an
    image covering a full range of soil moisture and vegetation density and when cloud,
    surface water, and other outliers are removed, the LST-VI space resembles a triangle
    or trapezoid [214]. One edge of the LST-VI triangle or trapezoid falling toward
    higher temperatures represent dry edge (low soil moisture), while the opposite
    side represents the wet edge (high soil moisture) [217]. Triangular or trapezoidal
    shape of the LST-VI space is formed due to the low sensitivity of LST to soil
    moisture under dense vegetative conditions, which is contrary to the high sensitivity
    of LST to soil moisture under bare soil or sparse vegetation conditions. Once
    upper and lower limit moisture content for wet and dry edges is determined, theoretically,
    soil moisture for remaining pixels can be estimated using interpolation techniques.
    The triangle method uses a simple parametrization approach and does not require
    ancillary atmospheric or surface data for soil moisture estimation [214,218].
    However, a subjective determination of wet and dry edges in the triangle method
    can introduce significant uncertainties in soil moisture estimation especially
    over relatively homogenous land-surface areas (e.g., rainfed agriculture during
    dry season) and after rainfall events when there is a general lack of variability
    in soil moisture to form an LST-VI triangle [215]. In addition, the traditional
    triangle method requires individual parametrization for each observation date,
    which is a time-consuming and computationally demanding process [60]. The traditional
    triangle method also needs both optical and thermal data that may not be available
    in certain instances (e.g., Sentinel-2). Recently, a newer generation of triangular
    models has been developed and tested for high spatial resolution mapping of soil
    moisture in PA applications [59,60]. One such technique, called the optical trapezoid
    model (OPTRAM), replaces the LST in the traditional triangle model with short-wave-infra-red
    transformed reflectance (STR). Analogous to the traditional triangle model, soil
    moisture in OPTRAM is estimated based on the interpretation of STR-VI space [60].
    Using Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 data, Sadeghi et al. [53] showed reasonably accurate
    (<0.04 cm3/cm3) soil moisture estimations with OPTRAM model for grass and cropland
    dominated watersheds in Arizona and Oklahoma, USA. The OPTRAM model does not require
    thermal remote sensing data, thus making it more suitable for a wide range of
    remote sensing data. Unlike LST, surface reflectance (STR) is a function of surface
    properties and does not vary significantly with ambient atmospheric conditions,
    which eliminates the need to parametrize/calibrate the model for individual dates
    [216]. However, compared to the traditional triangle model, the OPTRAM model is
    more sensitive to saturated land areas, which may result in increased uncertainty
    in soil moisture estimates [60]. More studies are needed to further evaluate these
    newer models for their applicability in a diverse range of climatic, hydrologic,
    and environmental conditions. Compared to the data acquired in visible, NIR, and
    SWIR bands, microwave remote sensing data have a greater potential to provide
    accurate soil moisture estimations [216]. Signals in visible and NIR regions have
    weaker penetration ability, compared to microwave, and is more likely to get affected
    by interferences caused due to atmospheric and cloud conditions [135]. Microwave
    sensors measure dielectric properties of soil based on land surface emissivity
    or scattering for soil moisture estimation. Several satellites with active and
    passive microwave sensors have been launched for soil moisture monitoring such
    as the advanced microwave scanning radiometer-earth observing system (AMSR-E),
    soil moisture and ocean salinity (SMOS), soil moisture active passive (SMAP),
    and Sentinel-1 [216]. Active microwave sensors provide higher spatial resolution
    as compared to the passive sensors. However, active sensors also suffer from measurement
    uncertainties caused due to land surface roughness and vegetative cover or canopy
    [219]. On the other hand, although passive sensors are more accurate and provide
    better temporal resolution, they also provide a coarser spatial resolution (e.g.,
    10s of km) [215]. Typically, watershed and regional scale hydrologic and agricultural
    applications, especially PA, require finer resolution data [220]. Several spatial
    downscaling techniques have been developed and used in the past to address the
    coarse spatial resolution limitation of passive microwave sensors. These techniques
    can be broadly categorized into two main groups: (i) satellite-based methods and
    (ii) modeling methods [221]. Typically, satellite-based methods use vegetation,
    surface temperature, and other geophysical and environmental information obtained
    from high spatial resolution satellite data (in optical and thermal bands) to
    downscale coarse resolution soil moisture data [61,62]. Machine learning and data
    mining techniques have been used with topography, land surface temperature, albedo,
    land cover, NDVI, and ET obtained from high spatial resolution satellite data
    to downscale coarse resolution soil moisture data from passive microwave sensors
    [135,222]. Higher resolution (1 km) land surface temperature and vegetation data
    derived from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) have popularly
    been used in many studies to downscale coarse resolution soil moisture data [135,223,224].
    Many others have used higher spatial resolution backscatter data from active microwave
    sensors to disaggregate and downscale brightness and soil moisture data from passive
    sensors [225]. Some studies have used a combination of SAR (Sentinel 1/2) and
    optical remote sensing data with machine learning techniques to downscale passive
    microwave (e.g., SMAP) data [226,227]. Modeling-based methods use high spatial
    resolution data derived from physically-based and statistical models with data
    assimilation approaches to downscale coarse-resolution soil moisture data [221,228].
    Despite the development of these downscaling techniques, spatio-temporal resolution
    of soil moisture estimates generated from microwave data is still coarse and/or
    lacks the accuracy needed for PA, limiting their application for irrigation scheduling
    in PA. Recent launches of multi-polarization sensors (e.g., Radarsat-2) along
    with the development of new polarization parameters and polarization decomposition
    methods can potentially help generating soil moisture and crop information at
    higher spatial resolution [229]. Multi-polarization SAR data can be combined with
    optical satellite data to generate soil moisture estimates at high spatial resolution
    [230]. Further efforts are needed to develop advanced downscaling techniques that
    can combine data from multiple sources (e.g., optical and microwave remote sensing,
    biophysical and hydrologic models) and provide temporally continuous (e.g., daily)
    soil moisture estimates at the finer spatial resolution necessary for PA [221].
    Overall, in addition to satellites, high spatial resolution data acquired from
    UAVs in optical, thermal, infrared, and microwave bands carry great promise for
    soil moisture mapping and other PA applications [231,232,233]. 5.2. Nutrient Management
    Timely and appropriate application of fertilizers is essential to optimize crop
    growth and yields while minimizing environmental damage through nutrient losses
    to groundwater and surface water. Typically, a recommended rate of fertilizer
    is uniformly applied during planting and later crop growth stages. However, the
    fertilizer requirement of crops varies spatially and temporally (during and among
    seasons) due to differences in soils, management, topography, weather, and hydrology
    [12,234]. Mapping of such variability in crop nutrient status/requirement for
    PA applications could be challenging with conventionally used tools such as chlorophyll
    meters [165]. Several vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI, SAVI), derived from remote
    sensing data, have been shown to be significantly correlated with plant chlorophyll
    content, photosynthetic activity, and plant productivity (Table 2). Mapping of
    these indices can thus help understand the spatial variability in crop nutrient
    status, which is important for PA. Recently, several tractor mounted remote sensors
    have become available that can measure plant nutrient status for real-time application
    of spatially-variable fertilizer rates. Green Seeker, Yara N-sensor, and Crop
    Circle are some examples of commercially available hand-held and tractor mounted
    remote sensors that use crop reflectance data to determine and apply spatially
    variable fertilizer rates in real-time [235]. In tractor mounted systems, remote
    sensors are usually mounted ahead of the spray boom. Nitrogen (N) application
    rates in these systems are determined based on the calculated vegetation indices
    (e.g., NDVI), which are further communicated to nutrient applicator/spreader for
    real-time fertilizer application. Different algorithms are used to convert the
    measured vegetation indices into recommended N-application rates. In general,
    the N-application rates are calculated by comparing measured vegetation indices
    in the target field with a reference vegetation index measured in a well fertilized
    (N-rich) plot/strip that is representative of the target field. Several fertilizer
    rate calculation algorithms (e.g., the nitrogen fertilizer optimization algorithm)
    [236,237] have been developed and successfully implemented in these commercially
    available sensors to determine vegetation-indices based in-season N-requirements
    for many crops [238,239]. Despite the commercialization of variable rate N-management
    technologies based on proximal remote sensing, farmer’s adoption remains low in
    many agricultural enterprises [240]. A lack of clear evidence on significant economic
    benefits (crop yield and/or profits), especially in commercial farm settings (i.e.,
    large fields) is a limiting factor for the large scale adoption of these technologies
    [241]. To further refine these remote sensing based technologies and enhance its
    benefits, research is being conducted with UAVs and other remote sensors for a
    variety of crops in different climatic regions. Maresma et al. [165] used images
    captured from a UAV to determine the suitability of several vegetation indices
    and crop height in determining in-season fertilizer application rates for corn
    grown in Spain. Cao et al. [242] showed that Green Seeker and Crop Circle sensors
    resulted in reduced N-fertilizer use and increased N-productivity for winter wheat
    production in China. Overall, remote sensing based mapping of crop nutrient status
    in PA can help increase crop nutrient use efficiency while maintaining/increasing
    crop yields and reducing off-site nutrient losses that are damaging to the environment.
    Remote sensing has also been used to determine soil organic matter and phosphorus
    content to develop spatial maps that can aid in site-specific management [243,244,245,246].
    Blasch et al. [243] used multi-temporal satellite images from RapidEye in conjunction
    with principal component analysis to develop field-scale soil organic matter maps
    to aid in site-specific precision management. Castaldi et al. [245] used images
    obtained from Sentinel-2 to develop soil organic carbon maps at both field and
    regional scales in Germany, Luxembourg, and Belgium and showed that the satellite
    data have an adequate spatial resolution for field scale planning in PA management.
    Crop growth is a function of several biotic and abiotic factors related to soils,
    management, topography, hydrology, and other environmental variables. Therefore,
    vegetation indices derived from remote sensing of crop growth/status are reflective
    of the combined variability in these factors or stressors. While using the vegetation
    indices to determine the plant nutrient status or N-application rates, one should
    also consider potentially confounding effects caused due to other stressors such
    as moisture stress and disease. 5.3. Disease Management Diseases can cause a significant
    loss of crop production and farm profits. Early detection of plant disease and
    its spatial extent can help contain the disease spread and reduce production losses.
    Field scouting, a conventional method of disease detection, is time consuming,
    labor intensive, and prone to human error [126]. In addition, with field scouting,
    it may be difficult to detect the disease during the early stages when the symptoms
    are not fully visible. Furthermore, some diseases do not show any visible symptoms,
    or the effect may not be noticeable until it is too late to act [247]. It is also
    difficult to map the spatial extent and severity of the disease spread with the
    traditional method of field scouting. Remote sensing could be used to monitor
    the disease efficiently, especially in the early stages of disease development,
    when it may be difficult to discern the signs of disease with field scouting.
    Multiple techniques using RGB, multi-spectral, hyperspectral, thermal, and fluorescence
    imaging have been used to identify diseases in a variety of crops [178]. Di Gennaro
    et al. [248] found a good correlation between grapevine leaf stripe disease and
    NDVI generated from UAV imageries in Italy. Abdulridha et al. [172] used a machine
    learning approach with vegetation indices derived from hyperspectral UAV images
    to detect citrus canker with 96% accuracy even during the early stage of disease
    development. As the differences in spectral signatures observed in a field can
    occur due to a combination of biotic and abiotic stresses, it could be challenging
    to discern the effects caused due to individual stressors (e.g., disease, water
    or nutrient stress). As compared to the typically used vegetation indices (e.g.,
    NDVI), the development of disease specific spectral disease indices (SDI) can
    increase the accuracy of disease detection and differentiation under real world
    field conditions [249,250]. Higher disease detection accuracies during critical
    crop growth stages such as flowering can help implement effective management plans
    in a timely manner to mitigate or avoid large yield and fruit quality losses.
    Use of SDIs, in place of typical VIs, can also reduce the complexity of disease
    detection methods and increase the system efficacy by reducing the computational
    demand [250]. Although studies have been conducted for plant disease classification
    [251], further efforts are needed to develop more accurate, automated and reproducible
    methodologies for disease detection under diverse climatic and real-world field
    conditions [40]. 5.4. Weed Management Conventional weed management approaches
    involving a uniform application of herbicide is an inefficient practice that increases
    the risk for off-site pesticide losses [252]. Application of herbicide at a variable
    rate as per need can help enhance the treatment efficiency and reduce input costs
    and environmental pollution [253]. Remote sensing has widely been used for mapping
    weed patches in crop fields for site-specific weed management [43]. Weeds can
    be identified or differentiated from crop plants based on their peculiar spectral
    signature related to their phenological or morphological attributes that are different
    from the crop. Over the last few years, machine learning approaches have emerged
    as a highly accurate and efficient method of image classification for weed mapping
    [254,255,256]. Two general types of image classification approaches are commonly
    used for weed mapping; supervised and unsupervised classification. Although each
    method has its own strengths and weaknesses, supervised classification is time-intensive
    and requires more manual work [26]. UAVs have been the most popular remote sensing
    platform for weed mapping and management primarily due to its capability to produce
    cm-scale resolution (5 cm) [257]) images needed for weed detection and mapping.
    Using the fully convolutional network approach, Huang et al. [254] mapped weeds
    in a rice field in China with up to 90% accuracy. Partel et al. [255] developed
    a target weed sprayer using deep learning neural network approach for ground-sensor
    based weed detection that yielded in 71% application accuracy in experimental
    fields in Florida, USA. However, the commercial adoption of these technologies
    remains challenging, given the expertise required to use advanced software and
    technical processes involved in their applications [258]. 5.5. Crop Monitoring
    and Yield Monitoring crop growth and yield are necessary to understand the crop
    response to the environment and agronomic practices and develop effective management
    plans for fieldwork and/or remedies [259]. LAI and biomass are two essential indicators
    of crop health and development [28]. LAI is also used as an input in many crop
    growth and yield forecasting models [260]. In-situ methods of LAI estimation (physical
    and optical) are time consuming and labor intensive, similar to the destructive
    field methods used for biomass estimation. Also, these methods do not provide
    a spatial variability map of crop growth and biomass [261,262]. Remote sensing
    data on crop growth (e.g., LAI) and biomass can help obtain valuable information
    on site-specific properties (e.g., soils, topography), management (e.g., water,
    nutrient, and other inputs), and various biotic and abiotic stressors (e.g., diseases,
    weeds, water, and nutrient stress) [263]. Similarly, remote sensing data can also
    be used to map differences in tillage and residue management and its effects on
    crop growth [264]. Several studies have used hyperspectral images with various
    machine learning and classification techniques to map tillage and crop residue
    in agricultural fields [265,266]. Such information on crop conditions and tillage
    practices can help develop site specific management plans, including variable
    water, nutrient, and pesticide application to increase production and management
    efficiency. Remote sensing data have been used to estimate LAI and biomass for
    a variety of crops, including row crops, orchards, and vine crops [267,268,269].
    Typically, such studies use a set of reference data (e.g., measured LAI and corresponding
    vegetation indices) to develop a regression or machine learning based approach
    to estimate LAI and/or biomass for a target field. Yue et al. [262] used multiple
    spectral indices in conjunction with measured plant height to estimate biomass
    (R2 = 0.74) in multiple irrigations and nutrient treatment plots for winter wheat
    grown in China. Ali et al. [269] used red-edge position (REP) extracted from hyperspectral
    images to predict LAI (R2 = 0.93) and chlorophyll content (R2 = 0.90) for Kinnow
    mandarins grown in Pakistan. REP is the position of the main inflection point
    of the red-NIR slope created due to strong chlorophyll absorption in the red spectrum
    and canopy scattering in the NIR region [269]. Reliable LAI estimation from reflectance
    data could be difficult, especially during early crop growth stages due to interference
    from the bare soil surface. To overcome this limitation, modified vegetation indices
    adjusted for soil and other interferences have been proposed and used to estimate
    LAI [270]. Recently, red-edge based vegetation indices have been shown to be promising
    for estimating LAI in multiple crops [271]. For PA, knowledge of spatial variability
    in crop yield is important to understand crop response to management practices
    and environmental stressors. Remote sensing derived crop biophysical parameters,
    or vegetation indices have a strong correlation with observed crop yield and biomass,
    indicating their potential for use in yield estimation [259]. Crop yield estimation
    from remotely sensed data has generally been conducted in two ways. First, biophysical
    parameters (e.g., LAI) derived from remotely sensed data are used in a crop model
    to estimate the crop yield and biomass. Second, statistical (e.g., regression)
    or empirical relationships are developed between remote sensing derived crop parameters/indices
    (e.g., NDVI, LAI) and observed crop yield and biomass in a representative crop
    field. The developed regression model or empirical relationship could then be
    used to map crop yield at a target crop field. Crop modeling is a data-intensive
    approach, which requires a large amount of information as model input parameters,
    meteorological data, and observed yield and biomass data. Maresma et al. [161]
    used a regression based approach to evaluate the relationship between corn yield
    and biomass and spectral indices measured at the V12 stage. Similar to other studies,
    they also found that the red-based indices NDVI and wide dynamic range vegetation
    index (WDRVI) had the highest correlation with grain yields for a range of fertilizer
    application rates. Spatial mapping of crop biophysical parameters or indices at
    multiple times during a growing season is likely to provide a better estimation
    of crop biomass and yield as compared to a single snapshot during the season [263].
    6. Progress Made, Needs, and Challenges Remote sensing has potential applications
    in almost every aspect of PA, from land preparation to harvesting. The abundance
    of high spatial resolution multi-temporal satellite data along with low-cost UAVs
    and commercially available ground-based proximity sensors have changed the face
    of PA. A large number of advanced techniques, including empirical, regression,
    and various forms of machine learning approaches have been used to explore the
    potential applications of remote sensing in PA. Similarly, many vegetation indices
    have been developed and tested for their ability to help PA operations, including
    variable fertilizer management, irrigation scheduling, disease control, weed mapping,
    and yield forecasting. However, many challenges need to be addressed before the
    remote sensing technologies can potentially see a large-scale adoption in commercial
    and non-commercial agriculture. Although most of the satellite data are available
    for free, it may require a significant amount of technical knowledge and expertise
    to process them for real-world applications. For example, image pre-processing
    and post-processing require expert knowledge and software. In addition, many PA
    operations such as disease and weed management require fine spatial resolution
    (cm-scale) data with high spectral and temporal (e.g., daily) resolution. Most
    of the publicly available satellite data do not meet such requirements. Furthermore,
    cloudy days and variable or inconsistent irradiance or sunlight may render many
    satellite images unsuitable for use. Users/farmers may need to purchase high resolution
    (spatial, temporal and spectral) satellite data, which can be cost-prohibitive,
    especially for small farms. However, images acquired from UAVs are likely to offer
    a low-cost alternative for small farm operations [272]. Use of UAVs and tractor-mounted
    sensors also involve the use of special software for data analysis and need professional
    operators (e.g., drone licensing) [235]. Hyperspectral images acquired from the
    state of the art sensors mounted on some of the recently launched satellites and
    UAVs provide a large amount of information on crop biophysical parameters. However,
    these sensors are expensive (UAVs), and the processing of imageries is complex
    [246]. There is a need to explore and develop advanced information and communication
    technologies as well as chemometric and spectral decomposition methods to synthesize
    and generate practical information needed for PA applications. Artificial intelligence
    techniques, including machine learning, has great potential to generate spatially
    and temporally continuous information from instantaneous satellite data at a scale
    necessary for many PA applications [212]. Hybrid methods, combining the knowledge
    obtained from physically based models, can complement such AI techniques to help
    develop techniques useful in PA decision making [43,212]. Despite a large number
    of studies on remote sensing applications in PA, there is a general lack of established
    techniques and/or framework that are accurate, reproducible, and applicable under
    a wide variety of climatic, soil, crop, and management conditions. Accuracies
    of methods using remote sensing (satellite, aerial, and UAV) data depends on a
    variety of factors including image resolution (spatial, spectral, and temporal);
    atmospheric, climatic, and weather conditions; crop and field conditions (e.g.,
    growth stage, land cover); and the analyses technique (e.g., regression-based,
    machine learning, physically based modeling). For example, the accuracy of surface
    energy balance techniques for ET estimation varies significantly in space and
    time, causing a large uncertainty in PA decision making. More studies are needed
    to understand the spatio-temporal structure of uncertainty in estimating ET, soil
    moisture, disease stress, and other crop parameters. Spectral signature from a
    crop is a reflection of crop status/response to site characteristics (e.g., soil,
    topography), management, and simultaneously acting multiple biotic and abiotic
    stressors (e.g., diseases, weeds, nutrient and water stress, etc.). A disease
    detection method found suitable under controlled experimental conditions may not
    perform similarly well in real-world conditions where multiple biotic and biotic
    stressors govern crop response or conditions. Given the complexity of image processing
    methods and the amount of technical knowledge and expertise it requires for application,
    there is a need to explore and develop a simple and reliable workflow for image
    pre-processing, analysis and application in real time. Major challenges and gaps
    remain in the development of tools and frameworks that can facilitate the use
    of satellite data for real-time applications by the end-users. Development of
    accurate, user-friendly systems is likely to result in wider adoption of remote
    sensing data in commercial and non-commercial PA operations. Author Contributions

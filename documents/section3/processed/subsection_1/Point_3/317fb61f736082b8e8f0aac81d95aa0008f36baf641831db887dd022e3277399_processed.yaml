    Fields Talk** by Muhammad Ayaz, Mohammad Ammad-Uddin, Zubair Sharif, Ali Mansour,
    and El-Hadi M. Aggoune from IEEE Access (Volume: 7) published in 2019 is reviewed
    here. With the rapidly increasing world population, food security has become a
    global concern. A sustainable and efficient agricultural system is required to
    meet the increasing food demand. The existing agricultural system faces several
    challenges, such as climate change, decreasing arable land, and water scarcity.
    IoT-based smart agriculture offers a range of solutions to address these challenges
    by providing real-time data, enabling precision farming, and improving resource
    utilization. The paper presents an overview of major applications of IoT in agriculture,
    including soil and crop monitoring, irrigation management, yield optimization,
    and pest and disease control. It also discusses the role of IoT in advanced agricultural
    practices such as greenhouse farming, vertical farming, and phenotyping. Furthermore,
    the paper highlights the importance of wireless sensors, robots, drones, and communication
    technologies in implementing IoT-based smart agriculture systems. While it provides
    a comprehensive review of the current state of IoT in agriculture, the paper lacks
    a discussion on ongoing and future research challenges and directions, which could
    have provided valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the field.
    Overall, the review offers a valuable summary of IoT applications and technologies
    in agriculture, emphasizing the potential of IoT to transform the agricultural
    sector. However, to fully harness the benefits of IoT, further research and innovation
    are needed to address the challenges and limitations of existing systems and explore
    new frontiers in smart agriculture.'

    the agricultural process, the reality is that today''s agriculture industry is
    data-centered, precise, and smarter than ever. The rapid emergence of the Internet-of-Things
    (IoT) based technologies redesigned almost every industry including “smart agriculture”
    which moved the industry from statistical to quantitative approaches. Such revolutionary
    changes are shaking the existing agriculture methods and creating new opportunities
    along a range of challenges. This article highlights the potential of wireless
    sensors and IoT in agriculture, as well as the challenges expected to be faced
    when integrating this technology with the traditional farming practices. IoT devices
    and communication techniques associated with wireless sensors encountered in agriculture
    applications are analyzed in detail. What sensors are available for specific agriculture
    application, like soil preparation, crop status, irrigation, insect and pest detection
    are listed. How this technology helping the growers throughout the crop stages,
    from sowing until harvesting, packing and transportation is explained. Furthermore,
    the use of unmanned aerial vehicles for crop surveillance and other favorable
    applications such as optimizing crop yield is considered in this article. State-of-the-art
    IoT-based architectures and platforms used in agriculture are also highlighted
    wherever suitable. Finally, based on this thorough review, we identify current
    and future trends of IoT in agriculture and highlight potential research challenges.

    I. Introduction To improve the agricultural yield with fewer resources and labor
    efforts, substantial innovations have been made throughout human history. Nevertheless,
    the high population rate never let the demand and supply match during all these
    times. According to the forecasted figures, in 2050, the world population is expected
    to touch 9.8 billion, an increase of approximately 25% from the current figure
    [1]. Almost the entire mentioned rise of population is forecasted to occur among
    the developing countries [2]. On the other side, the trend of urbanization is
    forecasted to continue at an accelerated pace, with about 70% of the world’s population
    predicted to be urban until 2050 (currently 49%) [3]. Furthermore, income levels
    will be multiples of what they are now, which will drive the food demand further,
    especially in developing countries. As a result, these nations will be more careful
    about their diet and food quality; hence, consumer preferences can move from wheat
    and grains to legumes and, later, to meat. In order to feed this larger, more
    urban, and richer population, food production should double by 2050 [4], [5].
    Particularly, the current figure of 2.1 billion tons of annual cereal production
    should touch approximately 3 billion tons, and the annual meat production should
    increase by more than 200 million tons to fulfill the demand of 470 million tons
    [6], [7]. Not only for food, but crop production is becoming equally critical
    for industry; indeed crops like cotton, rubber, and gum are playing important
    roles in the economies of many nations. Furthermore, the food-crops-based bioenergy
    market started to increase recently. Even before a decade, only the production
    of ethanol utilized 110 million tons of coarse grains (approximately 10% of the
    world production) [7], [8]. Due to the rising utilization of food crops for bio-fuel
    production, bio-energy, and other industrial usages, food security is at stake.
    These demands are resulting in a further increase of the pressure on already scarce
    agricultural resources. Unfortunately, only a limited portion of the earth’s surface
    is suitable for agriculture uses due to various limitations, like temperature,
    climate, topography, and soil quality, and even most of the suitable areas are
    not homogenous. When zooming the versatilities of landscapes and plant types,
    many new differences start to emerge that can be difficult to quantify. Moreover,
    the available agricultural land is further shaped by political and economic factors,
    like land and climate patterns and population density, while rapid urbanization
    is constantly posing threats to the availability of arable land. Over the past
    decades, the total agriculture land utilized for food production has experienced
    a decline [9]. In 1991, the total arable area for food production was 19.5 million
    square miles (39.47% of the world’s land area), which was reduced to approximately
    18.6 million square miles (37.73% of the world’s land area) in 2013 [10]. As such,
    the gap between demand and supply of food is becoming more significant and alarming
    with the passage of time. Further examination showed that every crop field has
    different characteristics that can be measured separately in terms of both quality
    and quantity. Critical characteristics, like soil type, nutrient presence, flow
    of irrigation, pest resistance, etc., define its suitability and capability for
    a specific crop. In most of situations, the differentiations of characteristics
    can exist within a single crop field, even if the same crop is being cultivated
    in entire farm; hence, site-specific analyses are required for optimal yield production.
    Further, adding the dimension of time, specific crops in the same field rotate
    season-to-season and biologically reach different stages of their cycle within
    a year in areas where locational and temporal differences result in specific growth
    requirements to optimize the crop production. To respond to these demands with
    a range of issues, farmers need new technology-based methods to produce more from
    less land and with fewer hands. Considering the standard farming procedures, farmers
    need to visit the agriculture sites frequently throughout the crop life to have
    a better idea about the crop conditions. For this, the need of smart agriculture
    arises, as 70% of farming time is spent monitoring and understanding the crop
    states instead of doing actual field work [11]. Considering the vastness of the
    agriculture industry, it incredibly demands for technological and precise solutions
    with the aim of sustainability while leaving minimum environmental impact. Recent
    sensing and communication technologies provide a true remote “eye in the field”
    ability in which farmers can observe happenings in the field without being in
    the field. Wireless sensors are facilitating the monitoring of crops constantly
    with higher accuracy and are able to, most importantly, detect early stages of
    unwanted state. This is the reason why modern agriculture involves the usage of
    smart tools and kits, from sowing to crop harvesting and even during storage and
    transportation. Timely reporting using a range of sensors makes the entire operation
    not only smart but also cost effective due to its precise monitoring capabilities.
    Variety of autonomous tractors, harvesters, robotic weeders, drones, and satellites
    currently complement agriculture equipment. Sensors can be installed and start
    collecting data in a short time, which is then available online for further analyses
    nearly immediately. Sensor technology offers crop and site-specific agriculture,
    as it supports precise data collection of every site. Recently, the Internet-of-Things
    (IoT) is beginning to impact a wide array of sectors and industries, ranging from
    manufacturing, health, communications, and energy to the agriculture industry,
    in order to reduce inefficiencies and improve the performance across all markets
    [12]–[16]. If looking closely, one feels that the current applications are only
    scratching the surface and that the real impact of IoT and its uses are not yet
    witnessed. Still, considering this progress, especially in the near past, we can
    predict that IoT technologies are going to play a key role in various applications
    of the agriculture sector. This is because of the capabilities offered by IoT,
    including the basic communication infrastructure (used to connect the smart objects—from
    sensors, vehicles, to user mobile devices—using the Internet) and range of services,
    such as local or remote data acquisition, cloud-based intelligent information
    analysis and decision making, user interfacing, and agriculture operation automation.
    Such capabilities can revolutionize the agriculture industry which probably one
    of most inefficient sectors of our economic value chain today. To summarize this
    discussion, figure 1 provides the main drivers of technology, while figure 2 highlights
    the major hurdles of technology implementation in smart agriculture. FIGURE 1.
    Key drivers of technology in agriculture industry. Show All FIGURE 2. Major hurdle’s
    in technology implementation for smart agriculture. Show All Researchers and engineers
    around the globe are proposing different methods and architectures and based on
    that suggesting a variety of equipment to monitor and fetch the information regarding
    crop status during different stages, considering numerous crop and field types.
    Focusing on the market demand, many leading manufactures are providing a range
    of sensors, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), robots, communication devices, and
    other heavy machinery to deliver the sensed data. In addition, various commissions,
    food and agriculture organizations, and government bodies are developing polices
    and guidelines to observe and regulate the use of these technologies in order
    to maintain food and environment safety [17]–[20]. There are reasonable efforts
    that highlight the role of the IoT in the agriculture industry, but most of the
    published work focuses only on applications [10], [21], [22]. Most of the existing
    articles either provide no insight or show limited focus on the various IoT-based
    architectures, prototypes, advanced methods, the use of IoT for food quality,
    and other future issues considering the latest facts and figures. This manuscript
    examines the trends in IoT-based agriculture research and reveals numerous key
    issues that must be addressed in order to transform the agriculture industry by
    utilizing the recent IoT developments. The major contribution of this article
    is to provide real insight regarding: Expectations of the world from the agriculture
    industry Very recent developments in IoT, both scholarly and in industry are highlighted
    and how these developments are helping to provide solutions to the agriculture
    industry. Limitations, the agriculture industry is facing. Role of IoT to cope
    these limitations and other issues like resources shortage and their precise use,
    food spoilage, climate changes, environmental pollution, and urbanization. Strategies
    and policies that need to be considered when implementing IoT-based technologies
    Critical issues that are left to solve and possible solutions that are further
    required, while suggestions are provided considering these challenges. This article
    is a compendium of knowledge that can help the researchers and agriculture engineers
    implementing the IoT-based technologies to achieve the desired smart agriculture.
    The rest of this document is organized as follows. Section II provides a deep
    overview of major applications of IoT in agriculture and what we can achieve by
    utilizing these technologies. Section III gives insight regarding the role of
    IoT in advanced agriculture practices, like vertical farming (VF), hydroponics,
    and phenotyping, to manage the issues of increased urban population. Section IV
    highlights various technologies and equipment, like sensors, robots, tractors,
    and communication devices, being used to implement IoT in this industry. Accepting
    the worth of UAVs in precision agriculture, Section V caters application achievements
    that are not possible even using other latest technologies. Food safety and transportation
    are other critical areas requiring focus to overcome the hunger issues which did
    not get the attention of researchers as it deserves. Section VI supplies the role
    of the IoT to ensure food quality for longer periods and to deliver to remote
    areas. Section VII identifies current and future trends of this technology in
    the crop industry by highlighting potential research challenges. Finally, Section
    VIII concludes this article. SECTION II. Major Applications By implementing the
    latest sensing and IoT technologies in agriculture practices, every aspect of
    traditional farming methods can be fundamentally changed. Currently, seamless
    integration of wireless sensors and the IoT in smart agriculture can raise agriculture
    to levels which were previously unimaginable. By following the practices of smart
    agriculture, IoT can help to improve the solutions of many traditional farming
    issues, like drought response, yield optimization, land suitability, irrigation,
    and pest control. Figure 3 lists a hierarchy of major applications, services and
    wireless sensors being used for smart agriculture applications. While, major instances
    in which the advanced technologies are helping at various stages to enhance overall
    efficiency are discussed below. FIGURE 3. General hierarchy of possible applications,
    services and sensors for smart agriculture. Show All A. Soil Sampling and Mapping
    Soil is the “stomach” of plants, and its sampling is the first step of examination
    to obtain field-specific information, which is then further used to make various
    critical decisions at different stages. The main objective of soil analysis is
    to determine the nutrient status of a field so that measures can be taken accordingly
    when nutrient deficiencies are found. Comprehensive soil tests are recommended
    on an annual basis, ideally in Spring; however, based on soil conditions and weather
    consents, it may be done in in Fall or Winter [23]. The factors that are critical
    to analyze the soil nutrient levels include soil type, cropping history, fertilizer
    application, irrigation level, topography, etc. These factors give insight regarding
    the chemical, physical, and biological statuses of a soil to identify the limiting
    factors such that the crops can be dealt accordingly. Soil mapping opens the door
    to sowing different crop varieties in a specific field to better match soil properties
    accordingly, like seed suitability, time to sow, and even the planting depth,
    as some are deep-rooted and others less. Furthermore, growing multiple crops together
    could also lead to smarter use of agriculture, simply making the best use of resources.
    Currently, manufacturers are providing a wide range of toolkits and sensors that
    can assist farmers to track the soil quality and, based on this data, recommend
    remedies to avoid its degradation. These systems allow for the monitoring of soil
    properties, such as texture, water-holding capacity, and absorption rate, which
    ultimately help to minimize erosion, densification, salinization, acidification,
    and pollution (by avoiding excessive use of fertilizer). Lab-in-a-Box, a soil
    testing tool kit developed by AgroCares, is considered a complete laboratory in
    itself based on its offered services [24]. By using this, any farmer, without
    having any lab experience, can analyze up to 100 samples per day (overall, more
    than 22,000 nutrient samples a year) without visiting any lab. Drought is a major
    concern which limits the productivity of crop yield. Most of the regions around
    the globe face this issue with various intensities. To deal with this issue, especially
    in very rural areas, remote sensing is being used to obtain frequent soil moisture
    data which helps to analyze the agricultural drought in far regions. For this
    purpose, the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite was launched in
    2009 which provides global soil moisture maps every, one to two days. Authors
    in [25] used SMOS L2 to calculate the Soil Water Deficit Index (SWDI) in Spain
    in 2014. In this effort, they followed different approaches to obtain the soil
    water parameters in order to compare with the SWDI acquired from in situ data.
    In [26], authors used the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS)
    sensor to map various soil functional properties to estimate the land degradation
    risk for sub-Saharan Africa. The soil maps and field survey data, which covered
    all major climate zones on the continent, were used to develop the prediction
    models. Sensors and vision based technologies are helpful to decide the distance
    and depth for sowing the seed efficiently. Like in [27], sensor and vision based
    autonomous robot called Agribot is developed for sowing seeds. The robot can perform
    on any agricultural lands on which the self-awareness of the robot’s placement
    is ascertained through the global and local maps generated from Global Positioning
    System (GPS) while the on-board vision system is paired with a personal computer.
    Advancing further, various non-contact sensing methods are proposed to determine
    the seed flow rate as in [28] where the sensors are equipped with LEDs; consist
    of infrared, visible light and laser-LED as well as an element as a radiation
    receiver. The output voltage varies based on the movement of the seeds through
    the sensor and band of light rays, and falling of shades on the elements of receiver.
    The signal information, linked to the passing seeds, is used to measure the seed
    flow rate. B. Irrigation About 97% of Earth’s water is salt-water held by oceans
    and seas, and only the remaining 3% is fresh water—more than two-third of which
    is frozen in the forms of glaciers and polar ice caps [29], [30]. Only 0.5% of
    the unfrozen fresh water is above the ground or in the air, as the rest lies underground
    [31]. In short, humanity relies on this 0.5% to fulfill all its requirements and
    to maintain the ecosystem, as enough fresh water must be kept in rivers, lakes,
    and other similar reservoirs to sustain it. It is worth mentioning that solely
    the agriculture industry uses approximately 70% of this accessible fresh water
    [32], [33]. In many countries, situation rises to 75% e.g. Brazil, further in
    some underdeveloped countries, even it exceeds 80% [34]. The main reason for this
    high water consumption is the monitoring procedure as even in 2013, crops visual
    inspection for irrigation decision-making was very common, as nearly 80% of farms
    in United States were observed by this [10], [35]. According to the UN Convention
    to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) estimates in 2013 show that there were 168 countries
    affected by desertification and by 2030, almost half of the world population will
    be living in areas with high water shortages [36]. Considering the figures of
    water crises around the globe, same time its increasing demands in agriculture
    and many other industries, it should be provided to places only where it is needed,
    most importantly, in required quantities. For this purpose, increased awareness
    has been implemented to conserve the existing under-stress water resources by
    employing more efficient irrigation systems. Various controlled irrigation methods,
    like drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation, are being promoted to tackle the
    water wastage issues, which were also found in traditional methods like flood
    irrigation and furrow irrigation. Both the crop quality and quantity are badly
    affected when facing water shortage, as irregular irrigation, even excess, leads
    to reduced soil nutrients and provokes different microbial infections. It is not
    a simple task to accurately estimate the water demand of crops, where factors
    like crop type, irrigation method, soil type, precipitation, crop needs, and soil
    moisture retention are involved. Considering this fact, a precise soil and air
    moisture control system using the wireless sensors not only makes an optimal use
    of water but also leads to better crop health. The current situation of irrigation
    methods is expected to be changed by adopting the emerging IoT technologies. A
    significant increase in crop efficiency is expected with the use of IoT based
    techniques, such as crop water stress index (CWSI)-based irrigation management
    [10], [35]. For this, attaining crop canopy at different periods and air temperature
    are needed for the calculation of CWSI. A wireless sensors based monitoring system
    where all the field sensors are connected to collect the mentioned measurements,
    further transmit to processing center where corresponding intelligent software
    applications are used to analyze the farm data. Not only this but information
    from other sources including weather data and satellite imaging is applied to
    CWSI models for water need assessment, and finally specific irrigation index value
    is produced for each site. A prominent example is VRI (Variable Rate Irrigation)
    optimization by CropMetrics [37], which works according to topography or soil
    variability, ultimately improves the water use efficiency. C. Fertilizer A fertilizer
    is a natural or chemical substance that can provide important nutrients for the
    growth and fertility of plants. Plants mainly need three key macronutrients: nitrogen
    (N) for leaf growth; phosphorus (P) for root, flowers, and fruit development;
    potassium (K) for stem growth and water movement [38]. Any sort of nutrients deficiency
    or applying them improperly can be seriously harmful for the plant health. More
    importantly, excessive use of fertilizer not only results in financial losses
    but also creates harmful impacts to the soil and environment by depleting the
    soil quality, poisoning ground water, and contributing to global climate changes.
    Overall, crops absorb less than half the nitrogen applied as fertilizer, while
    remaining either emitted to the atmosphere or lost as run off. Unbalanced use
    of fertilizer leads to an imbalance in both soil nutrient levels and global climate
    as, reportedly, around 80% of the world’s deforestation has occurred due to agricultural
    practices alone [39]. Fertilization under smart agriculture helps to precisely
    estimate the required dose of nutrients, ultimately minimize their negative effects
    on the environment. Fertilization requires site-specific soil nutrient level measurements
    based on various factors, such as crop type, soil type, soil absorption capability,
    product yield, fertility type and utilization rate, weather condition, etc. The
    reason is that the measurement of soil nutrient level is not only expensive but
    also time consuming, as, typically, investigations of soil samples at each location
    are required. To better depict this discussion, figure 4, summarizes the major
    inputs, processes and resultant outputs of smart agriculture. FIGURE 4. Some key
    inputs, processes involved and possible outputs of smart farming. Show All New
    IoT-based fertilizing approaches help to estimate the spatial patterns of nutrients
    requirements with a higher accuracy and minimum labor requirements [40], [41].
    For example, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) uses aerial/satellite
    images to monitor crop nutrient status [42], [43]. Basically, NDVI is based on
    the reflection of visible and near-infrared light from vegetation and is used
    to estimate the crop health, vegetation vigor, and density, further contributing
    to assess the soil nutrient level. Such precise implementation can significantly
    improve the fertilizer efficiency, simultaneously reducing the side effects to
    the environment. Many recent enabling technologies, like GPS accuracy [44], geo
    mapping [45], Variable Rate Technology (VRT) [46], [47], and autonomous vehicles
    [48], are strongly contributing to IoT-based smart fertilization. Other than precision
    fertilization, fertigation [49] and chemigation [50], [51] are other benefits
    of IoT. In these methods, water-soluble matters, such as fertilizers, soil amendments,
    and pesticides, can be applied through the irrigation system. Although, these
    methods are not new to agriculture and have been applied over last three decades,
    their precise use with real results has been witnessed only with IoT integration
    [52], [53]. Based on recent outcomes, fertigation is considered as the best management
    practice to improve the effectiveness of many agriculture matters; most importantly,
    it can be integrated with IoT-based smart farming infrastructure seamlessly. D.
    Crop Disease and Pest Management The Great Famine, also known as the Irish Potato
    Famine, in which approximately one million Irish people died around 1950, resulted
    due to crop failure and yield reduction caused by “potato blight” disease [54].
    Even today, corn growers in the US and southern Canada are facing an economic
    loss of approximately one billion USD due to “southern corn leaf blight” disease
    [55]. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that 20–40% of global
    crop yields are lost annually due to pests and diseases [56]. To control such
    vast production losses, pesticides and other agrochemicals became an important
    component of the agriculture industry during the last century. It is estimated
    that, in each year, around half a million tons of pesticide are used in the US
    alone, while more than two-million tons are used globally [57]. Most of these
    pesticides are harmful to human and animal health, leaving severe, even irreversible,
    impact to the environment, ultimately causing significant contamination to entire
    ecosystems [58], [59]. Recent IoT based intelligent devices, such as wireless
    sensors, robots and drones are allowing the growers to slash pesticide uses significantly
    by precisely spotting crop enemies. Compared to traditional calendar or prescription
    based pest control procedures, modern IoT-based pest management provides real-time
    monitoring, modeling, disease forecasting, hence proving more effective [60],
    [61]. Generally, the reliability of crop disease monitoring and pest management
    depends on three aspects: sensing, evaluating, and treatment. The advanced disease
    and pest recognition approaches are based on image processing in which raw images
    are acquired throughout the crop area using field sensors, UAVs, or remote sensing
    satellites. Usually, remote sensing imagery covers large areas and, hence, offers
    higher efficiency with lower cost. On the other hand, field sensors are capable
    to support more functions in collecting data, like environment sampling, plant
    health, and pest situations, in every corner throughout the crop cycle. For example,
    IoT-based automated traps [62], [63] can capture, count, and even characterize
    insect types, further uploading data to the Cloud for detailed analysis, which
    is not possible through remote sensing. Approaches like vehicle precise spray
    and automatic VRT chemigation [64], commonly used under smart fertilization, can
    also be utilized for disease treatment and other pesticide applications. Moreover,
    the advancement of robotic technology offers new solutions. When equipping an
    agricultural robot with multispectral sensing devices and precision spraying nozzles,
    it can locate and deal with pest problems more precisely under the manipulation
    of a remote IoT disease management system. This IoT-based pest management system
    has many advantages, as it can reduce the overall expenditures while, at the same
    time, support the restoration of the natural climate. For example, recently, it
    has been found that yields of many crop types are facing severe threat due to
    the lack of pollination [65], [66]. In fact, the pollination is being affected
    due to bee colony collapse disorder resulting from the uncontrolled pesticides.
    E. Yield Monitoring, Forecasting, and Harvesting Yield monitoring is the mechanism
    used to analyze various aspects corresponding to agricultural yield, like grain
    mass flow, moisture content, and harvested grain quantity. It helps to accurately
    assess by recording the crop yield and moisture level to estimate, how well the
    crop performed and what to do next. Yield monitoring is considered an essential
    part of precision farming not only at the time of harvest but even before that,
    as monitoring the yield quality plays a crucial role. Yield quality depends on
    many factors, e.g. sufficient pollination with good quality pollen especially
    when predicting seed yields under changing environmental conditions [67]–[69].
    Currently, when we are dealing with more open markets, buyers around the world
    become more particular about fruit quality; hence, effective production depends
    on the right fruit size to the right market at the right time [13]. Crop forecasting
    is an art to predict the yield and production (tons/ha) before the harvest takes
    place. This forecasting helps the farmer for near-future planning and decision
    making. Furthermore, analyzing the yield quality and its maturity is another critical
    factor which enables the determination of the right time for harvesting. This
    monitoring covers various development stages and uses fruit conditions like its
    color, size, etc., for this purpose. Predicting the right harvesting time not
    only helps to maximize the crop quality and production but also provides an opportunity
    to adjust the management strategy. Although, harvesting is the last stage of this
    process, proper scheduling can make a clear difference. To obtain the real benefits
    from crops, farmers need to know when these crops are actually ready to harvest.
    Figure 5 represents a snapshot of a farm area network (FAN) that can portrait
    the whole farm to the farmer in real time. FIGURE 5. An IoT based farm area network
    (FAN). Show All A yield monitor, developed in [70], can be installed on any harvester
    combine and linked with the mobile app FarmRTX, which displays live harvest data
    and uploads it automatically to the manufacturer’s web-based platform. This app
    has the ability to generate high-quality yield maps and share these maps with
    an agronomist, and the farmer also has the option to export to other farm management
    software to analyze them. To estimate the production and quality of yield precisely,
    the measurement of fruit growth can be highly beneficial. This idea is used in
    [71], where authors considered the fruit growth as the most basic and relevant
    parameter to estimate that how well the crop is progressing. Satellite images
    can be a good option to monitor the yield of crops with vast areas. This method
    is utilized in [72], where authors used Sentinel-1A Interferometric images to
    map the rice crop yield and intensity in Myanmar. As we mentioned earlier in this
    section, fruit size always plays a critical role to estimate its maturation, making
    decisions regarding harvesting, and targeting the right market, for this purpose,
    color (RGB) depth images are used in [73] to track the different fruit conditions
    in mango farms. Similarly, multiple optical sensors are used in [74] to monitor
    the shrinking of papayas, especially during drying conditions. SECTION III. Advanced
    Agricultural Practices Adopting the novel methods to enhance the quality and quantity
    of food is not something new, as humans have been doing this for centuries. Initially,
    we tried to enhance the crop production by focusing on seed variety, fertilizers,
    and pesticides. Soon it was realized that these conventional ways were not adequate
    enough to fit this demand gap; hence, agriculture scientists have begun thinking
    of other alternatives, like bioengineered (BE) foods. BE foods, also known as
    genetically modified (GM) or genetically engineered (GE) foods, are foods produced
    by introducing changes into their DNA using the methods of genetic engineering.
    However, several studies highlight their serious effects on human health, including
    infertility, disruption in immune system, accelerated aging, faulty insulin regulations,
    etc. [75], [76]. All these and many other similar technologies did not receive
    much popularity and acceptance in society because people prefer bio and organic
    food. In this regards, massive research has been conducted for decades in which
    sensors and IoT-based technologies are helping to improve conventional agriculture
    processes to enhance yield production without, or with minimum, effect on its
    originality. For this purpose, new sophisticated and more controlled environments
    are projected to tackle the above-mentioned issues. The importance and involvement
    of new technologies is more critical, as we are moving toward more cultured and
    urban farming. In fact, it would not be incorrect for one to say that the success
    of these advanced practices is in doubt without using sensor-based technologies.
    A. Greenhouse Farming Greenhouse farming is considered the oldest method of smart
    farming. Although, the idea of growing plants in controlled environment is not
    new as found since Roman times but it gained popularity in 19th century where
    largest greenhouses were built in France, Netherlands and Italy. Further, the
    practice was accelerated in the mid-20th century and highly promoted in countries
    that facing harsh weather conditions [77]. Crops grown indoors are very less affected
    by environment; most importantly, they are not limited to receiving light only
    during the daytime. As a result, the crops that traditionally could only be grown
    under suitable conditions or in certain parts of the world are now being growing
    anytime and anywhere. This was the actual time in which sensors and communication
    devices started to support various agriculture applications genuinely. The success
    and production of various crops under such controlled environment depend on many
    factors, like accuracy of monitoring parameters, structure of shed, covering material
    to control wind effects, ventilation system, decision support system, etc. A detailed
    analysis is provided in [78], where all these factors, their impacts, and how
    wireless sensors can help for all this are considered. Precise monitoring of environment
    parameters is the most critical task in modern greenhouses, where several measurement
    points of various parameters are required to control and ensure the local climate.
    In [79], an IoT-based prototype is proposed to monitor the greenhouses where MicaZ
    nodes are used to measure the inside parameters like humidity, temperature, light,
    and pressure. B. Vertical Farming The world needs more farmable lands to fulfill
    increased food demands, but reality is that one-third arable land was lost during
    the last four decades due to erosion and pollution [80], [81]. Unfortunately,
    current agricultural practices based on industrial farming are damaging the soil
    quality far faster than nature can rebuild it. Overall, it is estimated that erosion
    rates from cultivated fields is 10 to 40 times greater than the soil formation
    rates [82]. Considering the reduction of arable land issues, it could be a disaster
    for food production in the near future with current agriculture practices. Further,
    as we mentioned, 70% of fresh water is only used for agriculture purpose, which
    can increase the burden on existing limited water reservoirs. Vertical Farming
    (VF) is an answer to meet the challenges of land and water shortages. VF in the
    form of urban agriculture offers an opportunity to stack the plants in a more
    controlled environment resulting in, most importantly, significant reduction in
    resource consumption. By following this method, we can increase the production
    multiple times, as only a fraction of ground surface is required (depending on
    the number of stacks) as compared to traditional agriculture practices. Not only
    for ground surface, this system is highly efficient in terms of other resources,
    as well. For example, according to Mirai, a Japan based indoor farm developer
    presented the figures regarding a Japanese farm comprised of 25,000 square meters.
    The figures are highly encouraging, as it is producing 10,000 heads of lettuce
    per day (double the production when compared with traditional methods) and is,
    most importantly, consuming 40% less energy and up to 99% reduced water consumption
    compared to outdoor fields [83]. Aerofarms, a leader in VF, growing agricultural
    products with upto 390 times higher yields while utilizing 95% less water at Newark
    [84]. Under this farming method, many parameters are important, but CO2 measurements
    are most critical; hence, non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) CO2 sensors play a critical
    role to track and control the conditions in vertical farms. Boxed Gascard, developed
    by Edinburgh Sensors [85], is especially designed by considering such an environment,
    which employs a pseudo dual beam NDIR measurement system to enhance the stability
    and reduced optical complexity. Human hands are not required to touch the crops
    at any stage when following the IoT-connected vertical farm; this is the claim
    made by Mint Controls [86] developers who offer a wide range of solutions, like
    waste containers and sensors and their integration for various VF applications.
    C. Hydroponic In order to enhance the benefits of greenhouse farming, agriculture
    experts moved forward another step and provided the idea of hydroponic, a subset
    of hydroculture in which plants are grown without soil. Hydroponic is based on
    an irrigation system in which balanced nutrients are dissolved in water and crop
    roots stay in that solution; in some cases, roots can be supported by medium like
    perlite or gravel. When combining hydroponics with VF, a farm of 100 sq. meters
    can produce the crop equivalent to 1 acre of traditional farm, most importantly
    upto 95% less water and fertilizers utilization and without pesticides/herbicides
    [87]. Currently, available systems and sensors e.g. [88], [89] are not only used
    to monitor a range of parameters and take readings at predefined intervals but,
    also, the measurements are stored so that can be used to analyze and diagnostic
    purpose later on. Under this application, the precision of nutrient measurements
    is crucial, as such, a highly reliable wireless control system for tomato hydroponics
    is proposed in [90] in which they focused on various communication standards that
    are least effected by plants’ presence and their growth. The monitoring of solution
    contents and their precision is most critical under this method; for this purpose,
    many systems are offered to check the presence of contents considering the plant
    demands. In [91] a wireless-sensor-based prototype is proposed to deliver a turn-key
    solution for the hydroponic cultivation which offers real-time measurements for
    soilless indoor growing. Further, a compact sensor module is presented in [92],
    which uses oscillator circuits to measure the presence and concentrations of various
    nutrients and water levels. D. Phenotyping The previously discussed smart methods
    look more promising for the future of agriculture, as they are already being used
    to produce different crop products under precise environments. Other than these,
    a few advanced techniques are under experiment to further enhance the crop capabilities
    by controlling their limitations with the help of advanced sensing and communication
    technologies. Among these methods, the more prominent is phenotyping, which is
    based on emerging crop engineering, which links plant genomics with its ecophysiology
    and agronomy, as shows in Figure 6. The progress in molecular and genetic tools
    for various crop breeding was significant in the last decade. However, a quantitative
    analysis of the crop behavior, e.g. grain weight, pathogen resistance, etc., was
    limited due to the lack of efficient techniques and technologies that we can now
    enjoy. FIGURE 6. The process of phenotyping [96]. Show All Research investigations,
    completed in [93], conclude that plant phenotyping can be highly beneficial to
    investigate the quantitative characteristics, such as those are responsible for
    its growth, yield quality and quantity, and resistance capabilities to handle
    various stresses. Similarly, the role of sensing technologies and image-based
    phenotyping are highlighted in [94] and describes how these solutions can help
    to boost the progress not only for screening numerous biostimulants but also their
    role in understanding the mode of actions. Furthermore, an IoT-based phenotyping
    platform, CropQuant, is designed to monitor the crop and relevant trait measurements
    that can provide facility for crop breeding and digital agriculture [95]. Here,
    an automatic in-field control system was developed to process the data generated
    by platform. The provided trait analyses algorithms and machine-learning modeling
    help to explore the relation among the genotypes, phenotypes, and environment
    where it grows. SECTION IV. Major Equipment and Technologies Different from ancient
    farming, most of the tasks in modern, large-scale agriculture are being done by
    heavy and urbane equipment, such as tractors, harvesters, and other robots which
    are fully or partially supported by remote sensing and other communication technologies.
    In precision agriculture, when tasks like sowing, fertilizing, irrigation, and
    harvesting are being performed, the operating vehicles are equipped with GPS and
    GIS facilities so that they can work precisely, site-specifically, and autonomously.
    In fact, the idea of site-specific crop management is not possible without involving
    the recent advanced technologies. The success of precision agriculture is based
    on the accuracy of collected data, which is usually done in two ways [10]. The
    first entails the usage of multifunctional imaginary devices equipped with remote
    sensing platforms, such as satellites, agriculture airplanes, balloons, and UAVs;
    the second is from various types of sensors—those that are mostly deployed for
    specific purpose across various sites of our interest. The gathered data is identified
    with the precise location information by using GPS devices so that the site-specific
    treatment can be provided afterwards. Agriculture has transformed during the last
    few decades from small/medium farming operations to highly industrialized and
    commercial farming. This transition allows the leading corporations to treat agriculture
    like other industries, e.g., manufacturing where the measurements, data, and control
    are very important to provide a balance between costs and production in order
    to boost the profits. Accordingly, every aspect of agriculture that can be automated,
    digitally planned, and managed will benefit from IoT technologies and solutions.
    Based on this fact, efforts are being focused to offer more sophisticated tools
    such as agricultural robots to perform a range of activities, like planting, watering,
    weeding, picking, thinning, fertilizing, spraying, packing and transporting. This
    revolution is being driven not only due to the advancement of technology, but
    is also a result of factors like fear of losing the low-cost labor, most importantly
    need for better and cheaper food. Based on these facts, during the period of 2017
    to 2022, the global smart farming market is predicted to rise at a growth rate
    of 19.3% per year to touch $23.14 billion in 2022 [97]. Here it is worth mentioning
    that UAV/drones are generating and further expected to generate the highest revenue
    amongst all agricultural robots utilized in smart farming (UAVs are discussed
    in Section V). Evergreen demand for higher crop yield, increased incorporation
    of information and communication technology (ICT) in farming and the rapid global
    climatic changes are some of the major drivers resulting to such high market growth.
    Manufacturers in the market offer a variety of products and solutions, mostly
    based on sensors and efficient communication for a range of applications; a few
    are shown in figure 7. The key technologies and equipment’s that are currently
    available for this purpose are discussed in following. FIGURE 7. Selected IoT
    based products and prototypes for smart agriculture. Show All A. Wireless Sensors
    Among all the equipment for smart farming currently available in the market, wireless
    sensors are the most crucial and play a key role when it comes to collecting the
    crop conditions and other information. Wireless sensors are being used standalone
    wherever required, further integrated with almost every portion of advanced agricultural
    tools and heavy machinery, depending on application requirements. In the following,
    major sensor types are discussed according to their working procedure and purpose
    and the benefits they offer. 1) Acoustic Sensors Acoustic sensors offer a miscellaneous
    appliance in farm management, including soil cultivation, weeding, fruit harvesting,
    etc.; the main benefit of this technology is its low-cost solutions with fast
    response, especially when considering portable equipment. It functions by measuring
    the change in the noise level as the tool interacts with other materials, e.g.,
    soil particles [98]. Acoustic sensors are commonly used for pest monitoring and
    detection [99] and classifying the seed varieties according to their sound absorption
    spectra [100]. 2) Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-Based Sensors FPGA based
    sensors are starting to be used in agriculture recently due to their flexibility
    of reconfiguration. The major options where these can be employed include measuring
    real-time plant transpiration, irrigation, and humidity [101], [102]. However,
    their utilization in agriculture is in the early stages due to their limitations,
    such as size, cost, and power consumption. These sensors require more power; hence,
    they are not suitable for continuous monitoring, further high in cost even compromising
    on performance [103]. By overcoming these issues, FPGA-based sensors can offer
    satisfactory solutions according to specific application requirements. 3) Optical
    Sensors These sensors use light reflectance phenomena and help to measure soil
    organic substances, soil moisture and color, presence of minerals and their composition,
    clay content, etc. [104], [105]. These sensors test the soil’s ability to reflect
    light based on different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. The changes occurred
    in wave reflections help to indicate the changes in soil density and other parameters.
    Fluorescence-based optical sensors are used for basic plant assessment, especially
    to supervise the fruit maturation [106]. Further, when integrating optical sensors
    with microwave scattering, it can be used for characterizing grove canopies, like
    olives and other similar crops [107]. 4) Ultrasonic Ranging Sensors Sensors of
    this category are considered a good choice being low cost, potential to operate
    in a variety of applications, and ease of use and adjustability, such as the sampling
    rate. Common uses are tank monitoring, spray distance measurement (e.g., boom
    height and width control in order to perform uniform spray coverage, object detection,
    and collision avoidance), and monitoring crop canopy [108], [109]. When combined
    with a camera, these sensors can then be used for the weed detection [110], where
    the heights of plants are identified using the ultrasonic sensors and the camera
    determines the weed and crop coverage. 5) Optoelectronic Sensors Optoelectronic
    sensors can differentiate plant type; hence, they help to detect weeds, herbicides,
    and other unwanted plants, especially in wide-row crops [111]. When combining,
    an optoelectronic sensor and location information, it can map the weed distribution
    and resolution [112]. Optoelectronic sensors are also capable of differentiating
    between vegetation and soil from their reflection spectra. 6) Airflow Sensors
    These sensors are capable of measuring soil air permeability and percentage of
    moisture and identifying soil structure to distinguish different types of soils.
    Measurements can be made at singular locations or dynamically while in motion,
    e.g., can be used on a fixed position or in mobile mode. The desired output is
    the pressure required to push a predetermined amount of air into the ground at
    a prescribed depth. It follows the procedure of various soil properties, including
    compaction, structure, and moisture levels, producing unique identifying signatures
    [113]. 7) Electrochemical Sensors These are mostly used to assess the significant
    soil characteristics to analyze the soil nutrient levels, such as pH [114]. The
    standard chemical soil analysis, which are mostly expensive and time consuming,
    can be easily substituted with these sensors. To be more precise, the macro and
    micro nutrients in the soil, salinity and pH [115], are measured using sensors
    of this nature. 8) Electromagnetic Sensors Electromagnetic sensors are used to
    record electrical conductivity and transient electromagnetic response, identify
    electrical response, and adjust variable rate applications in the actual situation.
    Sensors based on this technology use electric circuits to measure the capability
    of soil particles to conduct or accumulate electrical charge, which is mostly
    done by the following two methods: contact or non-contact [116]. Residual nitrates
    and organic matter in the soil can also be measured using the electromagnetic
    sensors, as done in [117]. 9) Mechanical Sensors Mechanical sensors assess the
    soil mechanical resistance (compaction) to indicate the variable level of compaction.
    The mechanical sensors enter or cut through the soil and record the force assessed
    by strain gauges or load cells [118]. A pressure unit is used to measure the soil’s
    mechanical resistance, which is actually the ratio of the force needed to go into
    the soil medium using the frontal part of the tool, actually engaged with the
    soil. 10) Mass Flow Sensors Category of this sensors are used for yield monitoring,
    as it provides the yield information by measuring the amount of grain flow, e.g.,
    when passing through the combine harvester. Sensing the mass flow of grain to
    determine the crop yield is not new, as it has been performed the last two decades
    [119]. The mass flow sensor is the most critical component, but, overall, the
    yield monitoring system consists of several other modules, like the grain moisture
    sensor, data storage device, and an internal software to analyze the data, which
    are within the interface provided in the John Deere tractors [120]. 11) Eddy Covariance-Based
    Sensors This type of sensors can be used for quantifying exchanges of carbon dioxide,
    water vapor, methane or other gases, and energy between the surface of the earth
    and the atmosphere. This method offers an accurate way to measure surface-atmosphere
    fluxes of energy and trace gas fluxes over a variety of ecosystems for, most importantly,
    agricultural applications [121]. Currently, the sensors based on this technology
    are preferred over other similar options, like the close chamber, due to high
    precision and its ability to measuring continuous flux over large areas [122].
    12) Soft Water Level-Based (SWLB) Sensors SWLB sensors are being utilized in agriculture
    catchments to characterize hydrological behaviors, such as water level and flow,
    at adjustable time-step acquisitions. This is done by measuring rainfalls, stream
    flows, and other water presence options [11], [123]. 13) Light Detection and Ranging
    (LIDAR) This technology is widely used in a range of agriculture applications,
    such as land mapping and segmentation, determining soil type, farm 3D modelling,
    monitoring erosion and soil loss, and yield forecasting [124]–[126]. LiDAR is
    also commonly used to obtain dynamic measurement information regarding fruit-tree
    leaf area, and, when combined with GPS, it can produce a 3D map [127]. Moreover,
    this technology is often used when estimating the biomass of various crops and
    trees [128]. 14) Telematics Sensors Telematics sensors support telecommunication
    between two places—more precisely, among two vehicles when considering the agriculture-based
    applications. Telemetry sensors are used to collect data from remote locations
    (especially inaccessible points), operations of machines that report on how the
    components are working, and record location and travel routes to avoid visiting
    the same patch [129]. These services enable farm managers to record and store
    all information related to farm operations automatically, which maximizes the
    utilization of environmental benefits, further can minimize threats like farm
    equipment theft as utilized in [130], [131]. 15) Remote Sensing Sensors belong
    to this category are used to capture and store the geographic information, further
    analyze, manipulate, manage and present all types of spatial or geographical data.
    Similar to LiDAR, these sensors also found significant use in agriculture applications
    including crop assessment, forecasting yield dates, yield modelling and forecasting,
    identification of plants and pests, land cover and degradation mapping etc [132]–[134].
    Argos sensor is one of leading example, a satellite-based sensor system used to
    collect, process and disseminates environmental data from fixed and mobile platforms
    worldwide [135]. Moreover, automatic packet reporting system (APRS) is being integrated
    to report telemetry data through satellite communication [136]. Table 1 lists
    a few sensors to provide the idea about their possible uses and the environment
    where they can be placed. TABLE 1 Some Selected Sensors and Their Possible Uses
    in IoT Based Agriculture B. IoT Based Tractors As rural labor resources have started
    to come under stress due to the expansion of the crop industry, tractors and other
    automatic heavy machinery started to enter the agriculture sector. Where available,
    an average size tractor can work 40 times faster with significantly less expenses
    than traditional farm labor [157]. To fulfill the continuously increasing demands,
    agricultural-based equipment manufacturers, like John Deere, Hello Tractors, Case
    IH and CNH (New Holland), have started to provide better solutions focusing on
    the grower’s requirements. With the advancement of technology, most of these manufacturers
    are offering tractors with automatic-driven and even Cloud-computing capabilities.
    This technology is not new, as self-driving tractors have been in the market even
    before semi-autonomous cars. One of the main advantages of self-driving tractors
    is their ability to avoid revisiting the same area or row by reducing the overlap
    even less than an inch. In addition, they can make very precise turns without
    a driver’s physical presence. This facility offers better precision with reduced
    errors, especially when spraying insecticide or targeting weeds; those are mostly
    unavoidable when a human controls the machinery. Although, at the moment, no fully
    autonomous tractor is available in market, many researchers and manufactures are
    hardly working to mature the technology. Based on current progress and future
    demands of high-tech tractors, it is predicated that around 700,000 tractors equipped
    with facilities like autosteer or tractor guidance will be sold in 2028 [158],
    while the same study expects that around 40,000 unmanned, fully-autonomous (level
    5) tractors will be sold in 2038 [159]. When talking about such cultured machines,
    most farmers can’t afford to own them while most of the tractor service providers
    and manufacturers operate well below their potential. Considering the challenge,
    Hello Tractor has developed a solution to sort these issues. The company has developed
    a low-cost monitoring device that can be placed on any tractor, provides powerful
    software and analytics tools [160]. The benefits of this device are twofold- on
    one side it ensures that overall cost of tractor remains affordable for the most
    of growers while at the same time it monitors the condition of the tractor and
    reports if any problems occur. The software connects tractor’s owner to farmers
    in need of tractor services, just like Uber for tractors. Another major example
    is Case IH’s Magnum series [161] tractor which uses on board video cameras and
    LiDAR sensors for object detection and collision avoidance. Recently, Case IH
    used this tractor to plant soybeans by following the concept of autonomous tractors.
    In another development made by standards group ETSI where world’s first tractor
    connected to a car in France, using IoT [162] to control the accidents due to
    farm vehicles. After collecting all the important crop data, the next step is
    pushing computing from the Cloud to the edge, as John Deere [163] wants. In their
    proposed system, an analytics engine works locally on the farmer’s tractor rather
    than in the Cloud in order to adjust the local inputs. For this purpose, they
    considered all the existing analytics and recommendations to modify the current
    data in real time depending on the field conditions. Based on this phenomenon,
    the manufacturer is bringing their tractors to next level by connecting their
    machine to the Internet and creating a method to display the information wherever
    farmer wants to see it. C. Harvesting Robots Harvesting is the most critical stage
    during the production process, as this last phase dictates the crop’s output and,
    ultimately, its success. In some crops, this is done a single time while, in some
    others, performed several times, even on a daily basis, as crop reaches a certain
    stage. Harvesting the crop at the right time is very critical, as doing so either
    early or late can affect the production significantly. When talking about the
    labor, it is estimated that the US faces a $3.1 billion decline in crop production
    on a yearly basis due to labor shortage [164]. Not only this, but, according to
    a study conducted by the United States Department of Agriculture, overall 14 %
    of farm costs go to wages and labor costs, while it can be upto 39% in some labor
    intensive farms [165]. Considering the worth of this stage and labor issues, farm
    experts expect that involvement of agriculture robotics may not only ease the
    labor pressure but also provide the flexibility to harvest whenever needed. In
    order to automate the harvesting process and make it more precise, the role of
    robots has been increasing over the recent decades. Considering the robot services,
    many researchers have done intensive research in order to mature the sensitivity
    of fruit detection, its shape, size, color, and localization [166]–[169]. Automatic
    harvesting of fruits requires deep investigation of sophisticated sensors that
    are capable of collecting precise and unambiguous information of that particular
    crop and fruit. The task of detecting the right target in natural scenes is not
    simple since most of the fruits are occluded partially—sometimes even fully—under
    the leaves and branches or are overlapped with other fruits [170]. Here, most
    of the prominent studies found in regard to this purpose are deeply based on computer
    vision, image processing, and machine learning techniques. This process needs
    very specialized and sophisticated tools to differentiate the fruit conditions,
    as there are more than sixty shapes, sizes, and colors for a pepper alone when
    it is ready to harvest. Considering such complexity, many robots are being developed
    for specific crops. Some of the leading robots being used for crop harvesting
    include SW 6010 [171] and Octinion [172] for strawberries, SWEEPER robot [173]
    for peppers, and FFRobot [174] for tree-based fruits like apples which can pick
    up to 10,000 fruits per hour. Strawberries are one of the most consumed fruits,
    available mostly throughout the year while labor is the major contributor to the
    high cost of this fruit, especially during harvesting and packaging stages [175].
    As the strawberry farms are grown mostly under greenhouse systems hence the harvesting
    robots are designed to move on defined paths like rails where the translational
    motion is restricted and robots can move backward and forward only. Robots developed
    by Agrobot are able to collect strawberries along the side of strawberry plant
    rows in the field, further packed by human operators [176]. For example, SW6010
    by Agrobot is a specialized and semi-automatic robot towards the specific task
    of strawberry harvesting [177]. Tektu T-100 is an all-electric rechargeable strawberry
    harvester run silently with zero emission inside the poly-tunnels [178]. The installed
    pickers are able to position over the crop rows and gather the fruit quickly and
    efficiently, directly into punnets. D. Communication in Agriculture Communication
    and reporting the information on a timely basis are considered the backbone of
    precision agriculture. The real purpose cannot be achieved unless a firm, reliable,
    and secure connection among various participating objects is provided. To achieve
    communication reliability, telecom operators can play a crucial role in the agricultural
    sector. If we truly want to implement IoT on a large scale in the agriculture
    industry, we have to provide a suitably large architecture. Here, the factors
    like cost, coverage, energy consumption, and reliability are critical and have
    to be considered before choosing the mean of communication. Low-energy networks
    can provide connectivity only on one site and mostly do not offer services in
    remote areas where sensed data need to be transmitted to the farm management system
    (FMS). Depending on availability, scalability and application requirements, various
    communication modes and technologies are being used for this purpose, most common
    are discussed here, 1) Cellular Communication Cellular communication modes from
    2G to 4G can be suitable, depending on the purpose and bandwidth requirement;
    however, the reliability, and even availability, of a cellular network in rural
    areas is a major concern. To tackle this, data transmission via satellite is another
    option, but, here, the cost of this communication mode is very high, which makes
    it not suitable for small- and medium-sized farms. The choice of communication
    mode also depends on application requirements, such as some farms required sensors
    that can operate with low data rate but need to work for long periods hence demand
    long battery life. For such scenarios, a new range of Low Power Wide Area Network
    (LPWAN) is considered a better solution for cellular connectivity, not only in
    terms of long battery life but also a larger connectivity range with affordable
    rates (2 to 15 USD per year) [179]. Currently, crop and pasture management are
    two of the main applications where LPWAN networks are highly suitable, and, further
    considering its success, it can be utilized in many other farming-related uses.
    Besides WAN connectivity option, many short range and medium level communications
    are being used in mesh networks [180]. For example, a mesh-network of sensor nodes
    collects data and transmits it to the gateway which is located somewhere in the
    same area. The gateway further sends this data to the farm management system using
    the WAN network. The communication technologies used within the mesh networks
    vary e.g. Bluetooth and Zigbee can be used to provide connectivity for peer-to-peer
    wireless communications. From here, the sensed data forwarded to the FMS, which
    gathers and analyses the information about all the activities happening at different
    parts even the historical data regarding the weather and climate updates, economic,
    products being used and their specifications etc, in short making it decision
    farming. It is important to mention that, the communication technology has its
    own worth but the FMS also plays a critical role which must be custom designed
    considering the specific application requirements. Generally, based on communication
    data rates and power consumption, wireless sensors for agriculture applications
    are divided in three broad categories as shown in table 2. TABLE 2 Data and Power
    Specifications of Wireless Sensors Commonly Used for Agriculture Applications
    2) Zigbee Zigbee is primarily designed for a wide range of applications especially
    to replace existing non-standard technologies. Depending on the application requirements,
    the devices based on this protocol can be one of three types including Coordinator,
    Router and End User. Further, three different topologies are supported by Zigbee
    networks named, Start, Cluster Tree and Mesh [34]. Based on these characteristics,
    and further considering the agriculture application requirements, Zigbee can play
    vital role especially targeting the greenhouse environment where usually short
    range communications are required. During monitoring the various parameters, the
    real time data from the sensor node is transferred through Zigbee to end server.
    For the applications like, irrigation and fertilization, Zigbee modules are networked
    for communication, e.g. in drip irrigation used to monitor soil contents like
    moisture. Further, SMS is forwarded to the farmer to update about the field data
    where GSM is required at long distance or Bluetooth module can help at the shorter
    distances. 3) Bluetooth Bluetooth is a wireless communication standard that connects
    small-head devices together over shorter distances usually cooperating in a close
    proximity. Due to its advantages of low power requirements, easy to use and low
    cost, this technology is being utilized in many smart farming applications. Further,
    Bluetooth making advancements in many IoT systems with the release of Bluetooth
    Low Energy (BLE) or commonly known as Bluetooth Smart. The study conducted in
    [181] which tests Bluetooth and PLC (programmable logic controller) with ICS (integrated
    control strategy), timer control and soil moisture control approach for smart
    irrigation. The target of this study is to find an optimum utilization of water
    and energy consumption for various greenhouse or field applications. A moisture
    and temperature sensor based on BLE is developed in [182] especially focusing
    on the agriculture environments and weather conditions of crop fields. Here the
    reason of choosing BLE for communication purpose is due to its inherent support
    for smart phone accessibility. Further, a similar effort is done in [183] where
    a new sensor node is designed to monitor ambient light and temperature employing
    BLE communication protocol preferable for IoT based agriculture applications.
    Other than short range, WiFi is utilized whenever LAN communications are required
    in smart agriculture. Along short range connectivity, WiFi is utilized whenever
    LAN communications are required in smart agriculture. Study presented in [184]
    investigates a remote monitoring system using WiFi, where the sensor nodes were
    based on WSN802G modules. The deployed nodes communicate wirelessly with a central
    server, which is responsible to collect and store the monitored data and further
    allow displaying the information after required analysis. 4) LoRa LoRa wireless
    technology is a long-range, low-power platform used extensively in IoT applications.
    Being low in power consumption, it offers LPWAN connectivity between the wireless
    sensors and the Cloud. It has proved itself much more effective and reliable than
    Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, etc. especially in restaurants or kitchen environments. Sensors
    based on LoRa can be installed in smaller devices for reliable monitoring. Most
    importantly, LoRa signals can penetrate thick and insulated objects, even buildings,
    and can, hence, cover a larger network area. Overall, LoRa-based networks perform
    higher in terms of lifespan and, at the same time, pose reduced maintenance and
    upkeep burden [185]. Considering the advantages, many researchers tested this
    communication method in kitchens, storage rooms, and transport systems. In [186],
    a test was conducted in a warehouse with a capacity to store 40 tons of apples,
    and results show that it provided full coverage, where the temperature and airflow
    readings transferred successfully with a packet rate of more the 96%. Similarly,
    [187] presents a system to achieve information traceability in the grain transport
    system to ensure the food quality by monitoring the temperature and humidity levels.
    5) Sigfox Sigfox is also used to provide network connectivity services to low-powered
    objects as “things” required. It is based on narrowband or ultra-narrowband technology;
    hence, it takes very narrow chunks of spectrum and changes the phase of the carrier
    radio wave to encode the data. Based on these characteristics, it offers high
    level performance, even if 100 sensors need to transmit data at the same time,
    as experiments done in [188]. Figure 8 gives an idea that how end-to-end communication
    possibilities can be divided in various layers to interact with each other in
    order to provide the services for smart agriculture. FIGURE 8. End to end communication
    for smart farming. Show All E. Smartphones Despite its availability concerns for
    remote fields, cellular communication is the major technology in rural areas;
    mobile phones are a very common source and primary mode of communication whenever
    the need arises to contact or update most of the farming community. Recent advancements
    in the smartphone industry have resulted in sharp price decreases, making this
    industry more attractive, especially to the smallholder growers in remote areas.
    The rapid spread of cellular networks in developing countries offers the opportunity
    to reach remote and dispersed farms with improved services. Mobile-phone-based
    agriculture services (m-services) are far from their assumed potential; according
    to an analysis done by GSM Association, only at 8 per cent [189]. However, the
    flexibility and functionality, such as the camera, GPS, microphone accelerometer,
    proximity, and gyroscope, attract the IT experts, and they are developing more
    appealing mobile apps that consider the farmer’s various needs [190], [191]. The
    conclusion of FAO’s 10-year investigations states that “solid information is needed
    regarding the impact of previous initiatives, including lessons learned, in order
    to inform the design and approach of future efforts” [192]. Interestingly, the
    smartphone is the first device that comes to mind when planning how to achieve
    this goal, especially considering the often dispersed and poorly serviced areas.
    Recent years have seen rapid expansion of research, with researchers conducting
    a growing number of studies and developing various models to highlight the scope
    of smartphone crop applications. These researchers mostly belong to developing
    nations, as proposed systems are based primarily in countries like Kenya [193],
    [194], Ghana [195], [196], Nigeria [197], [198], Mali [199], Uganda [200], and
    Zimbabwe [201], [202]. Although, the scope of smartphone utilization in agriculture
    has been more commonly observed in Africa, experiments in countries like Cameroon
    [203], China [204], [205], Turkey [206], [207], and India [208], [209] are also
    increasing. Analysing the success of m-services depends on many factors. One of
    the most comprehensive studies regarding the use of mobile phones for various
    agriculture applications was conducted to review all the important factors [210].
    This study concludes that the service will be of no effect if the developer of
    the application does not truly understand the farmer needs. Obviously, the most
    important factor for such applications is that the farmer should access and use
    them. In other words, an easy-to-use, free or low-cost app that supports various
    languages could attract the farmer’s attention. In addition, developers should
    study and consider the relevant factors before making their suggestions. For example,
    market prices are of great interest to farmers, but would be of no use in cases
    of bad roads and unavailability of proper transport vehicles. The developers should
    target the problems of the wider community instead of focusing only on farmers,
    considering the transporters, brokers, and other agriculture experts as well.
    Unfortunately, most of the applications are developed on growers’ perceptions,
    instead of using independent and verified market data. For this purpose, the developer
    should not only focus on the data retrieved by independent investigators but also
    assess it under various usage patterns covering longer durations. Table 3 lists
    smartphone based sensors that are attracting the researchers to utilize them for
    various agriculture purposes. While, last column provide some of the references
    where these sensors have been used. Further, Table 4 includes some of the important
    mobile apps developed for various agriculture applications along their features
    and achievements. TABLE 3 Smartphone Based Sensors That Being Used in Various
    Agriculture Applications TABLE 4 Selected Important Smartphone Applications for
    Various Agriculture Applications F. Cloud Computing Precision agriculture is showing
    its potential and benefits by improving agricultural operations through better
    data-driven decision making. However, to continue this success, precision agriculture
    not only requires better technology and tools to process data efficiently but
    also at a reasonable cost such that the received data can be used to make field
    decisions efficiently. For this purpose, farmers can use Cloud services to access
    information from predictive analysis institutes so that they can choose the right
    product available according to their specific requirements. Cloud computing offers
    an edge to farmers to use knowledge-based repositories that contain a treasure
    of information and experiences related to farming practices as well as on equipment
    options available in the market with the necessary details. In most cases, all
    this comes along with expert advice from a wide range of sources (for example,
    on farming and the processing of agricultural products). To make it more effective,
    the scenario can be extended further to include access to consumer databases,
    supply chains, and billing systems. Surely, moving towards Cloud-based services
    offer opportunities to explore advancements, but it comes with new challenges,
    as well. First, a vast range of sensors are being developed and used in precision
    agriculture, each of which has its own data format and semantics. Secondly, most
    of the decision-support systems are application-specific while, on the other hand,
    a farmer can be in the need of accessing various systems for a specific application,
    e.g., soil monitoring. Considering both of these cases, the Cloud-based decision-support
    system not only needs to handle the diversity of data and their formats but also
    must be able to configure these formats for different applications. An open Cloud-based
    system has been established by AgJunction [243] which gathers and disseminates
    the data on a form from different precise agriculture controllers, leading to
    a decrease in costs and environmental impacts. Furthermore, “Akisai” Cloud [244],
    proposed by Fujitsu, focuses on food and agricultural industries and incorporates
    information communication technology for increasing the food supply in the coming
    years. Similarly, SourceTrace developed and offering Cloud-based mobile applications
    to provide visibility and relations between farms and markets, further tracking
    the value chain at the source, e.g., ’eService Everywhere’ [245]. An important
    note about their applications is that, during the development, they considered
    the farms’ remoteness and low bandwidth environments. Figure 9 presents possible
    infrastructure and relationship scenario of fluid computing including Edge, Mist
    and Fog for smart agriculture. FIGURE 9. Fluid computing infrastructure for smart
    farming. Show All SECTION V. UAVs in Agriculture Recently, the IoT has made remarkable
    progress in many industries, including farming sectors like poultry, fishing,
    etc. but when we talk about agriculture, the communication facilities like base
    stations or Wi-Fi are very limited, which prevents the growth of the IoT in this
    sector. Such communication infrastructure and related facilities are even worst
    in developing counties and rural areas, which is one of the major hurdles when
    introducing the IoT in the agriculture industry. The data acquired through the
    wireless sensors cannot be transmitted in the absence of reliable communication
    infrastructure. In such a scenario, UAVs offer an alternative, as they visit and
    communicate with the wireless sensors spread over large areas in order to harvest
    data for further processing and analysis. Furthermore, UAVs, better known as drones,
    fitted with high-resolution cameras and precise sensors, can be flown over thousands
    of hectares of farms. The role of surveillance in all agriculture applications
    is highly critical, especially in forestry and crop monitoring due to the need
    to cover large areas [246]. Therefore, a fast, low-cost, real-time, and large-scale
    surveillance supported with an accurate data acquisition and transmission facility
    is crucial for agriculture production. Currently, mostly two options are used
    to obtain aerial images of a field area: satellite and airplanes. Both of them
    are good for a macro view of a landscape, but they face serious issues in terms
    of quality when it comes to micro views. These macro-view images are not good
    in resolution and cannot offer the image quality which is required during the
    analyses and decision making. Secondly, not only the resolution but visiting frequency
    also matters and, through both of these, it is not simple to take and collect
    images frequently (on average, four times a month [247]). Another serous issue
    is that these operate above the cloud level where there is a strong possibility
    that both are obstructed in bad weather. When we talk about UAVs that provide
    an “eye in sky”, we can overcome— or even eliminate— the above mentioned issues
    when we consider the micro views. The quality of images taken through UAVs depends
    on the attached camera’s resolution—normally dozens of times better than satellite
    images—and, most importantly, we can adjust according to application requirements.
    More specifically, UAVs supports faster and better NDVI to assess crop conditions,
    like weed mapping, leaf assessments, etc., and provide immediate feedback so that
    farmers can take timely actions. Similarly, UAVs are better in terms of frequency,
    even if requires multiple times in a single day, and are also the option least
    affected by weather conditions, unless it is raining. Due to the mentioned advantages,
    UAVs are considered the future of precision agriculture, and this is the reason
    they are generating the highest revenue amongst all agricultural robots developed
    for precision agriculture. According to quoted figures by a report published by
    FAO in 2018, it is estimated that the agriculture drone-related market to be worth
    USD 32.4 billion [248]. The current condition of the entire field is one of the
    most valuable pieces of information to obtain in the precision program. With the
    help of this collected data, a farmer can spot problems early and rapidly; hence,
    appropriate interventions can be applied. Agricultural drones represent a new
    way to collect field-level data; the results are on-demand whenever and wherever
    needed, as the drone can be easily and quickly deployed. Most importantly, it
    is not all about their hardware but the convenience, quality, and utility they
    are offering, as the drone-enabled surveillance offers the real facility to have
    an idea of what is happening in the farm fields at that moment. The UAVs, used
    for agricultural applications usually fall into two categories: fixed-wing and
    multi-rotor drones [249] (figure 10). Although both are available in various ranges
    in terms of cost, payload capacity and mostly distinguished based on hardware
    differences. For example, when it is required to cover a large area, fixed-wing
    drones are suggested due to their long-range flight capacity, most importantly
    they are crash tolerant e.g senseFly’s eBee SQ [250] and DATAhawk [251]. On the
    other hand, multi-rotor drones are more common due to their easy and faster set
    up as can take off and land vertically. Multi-rotors actually have many advantages
    over the fixed wings as they are easier to operate, require no advance wind planning
    and have the ability to fly more precisely. Moreover, in scenarios where low altitude
    flight is required in order to capture extremely detailed images, which is more
    common in agriculture applications then the multi-rotor are considered the better
    choice, some major examples belongs to this type are DJI Matrice 200 [252] and
    Introducing Scout by American Robotics [253] which considered a fully autonomous
    drone for daily agriculture scouting. FIGURE 10. Types of agricultural drones.
    Show All Generally, drones collect information through the light reflected by
    the ground it is maneuvering, over, either from soil or plants. For agricultural
    applications, specific cameras and sensors are used, depending on the grower’s
    interest—most commonly mentioned are thermal and hyper-spectral. Thermal sensors
    can help to recognize the water quantity, as leaves of plants with more water
    access appear cooler in an image. The same phenomenon is used in near-infrared
    (NIR) sensors; commonly used to note the difference between the NIR reflectance
    and the visible reflectance, such as NDVI [254]. The resultant NDVI-based images
    help to distinguish the water stress areas, as shown in figure 11. Hyper-spectral
    based sensors or cameras record the wavelengths of both visible and invisible
    lights, are able to identify the specific type of plant by measuring the color
    of reflected light. This reflected light is used to distinguish various plant
    types, ultimately helping to detect the unwanted herbicide and weeds [255]. The
    idea is used in [256], where authors used the multispectral images to classify
    various weeds. FIGURE 11. NDVI based water stress map of 160 acre walnut orchard
    [258]. Show All Due to their nature and flexibility, UAVs are being used in a
    range of agricultural applications, including crop health monitoring, planting,
    plant counting, spraying, agriculture photography, and many other variable rate
    applications. After being equipped with automation and GPS capabilities, they
    are ready to take the agriculture sector to a further-modernized level. With every
    passing day, drones are becoming more inexpensive and reliable, hence, making
    themselves an ideal choice for new farming applications. Focusing on the success
    of this technology, SAP (Systems, Applications, and Products), one of the largest
    vendors of enterprise resource planning, has brought three of its major technologies
    together in order to make the information harvested through UAVs more effective
    [257]. The technologies include the HANA, a Cloud database which supports speedy
    data capture, retrieval, and analytics; the Leonardo IoT suite to connect and
    exchange information over any protocol; and the Connected Agriculture suite to
    provide a GUI-based, graphical-use interface to the farmers. While it depends
    on the situation, in most cases, few hours delays doesn’t leave serious impact
    in most of the agriculture applications but flight time is more important as need
    to cover larger areas due field vastness. Not only vastness, but in some applications
    of pesticide and fertilizer, UAVs need to carry heavy payloads. In such situations,
    optimum battery utilization becomes crucial to extend the flight time. For this
    purpose, many factors can be considered to increase the drone efficiency. Firstly,
    when flying, choose right conditions e.g. weather or air direction. Next, try
    to include optimum payload and place it appropriately. For this situation, it
    can be helpful to attach the payload near the field, better in smaller quantities
    and the refilling again instead of putting heavy quantities. Further, depending
    on area size and visiting frequency, optimum path selection plays a critical role.
    For this purpose, many routing schemes like [259], [260] are proposed especially
    for the UAVs so choosing and implementing the right scheme can provide clear difference.
    Considering the application of pesticide and UAV based irrigation where drone
    need to fly with heavy payloads then new procedures like tethering system can
    be helpful. In UAV tethering, a connection that provide power through the long
    cable, is provided so that it can fly as long as you have power backup on the
    ground, most importantly it doesn’t require to lift heavy batteries. Currently,
    agriculture is being considered one of the most favorable fields where UAVs can
    offer solutions to resolve many dominant and long-lasting issues. Some of key
    areas in which drones are already playing key roles to assist farmers throughout
    the crop cycle are highlighted below. A. Soil and Field Analysis Drones are able
    to produce precise information to analyze the soil before sowing the crop, which
    helps to determine the most suitable crop for specific land; furthermore, it suggests
    the seed type and its planting patterns. In [261] authors shared their experimental
    results using Sirius I, a fixed-wing aircraft, affixed with a Lumix GF1 digital
    camera by Panasonic to capture images from different sites to monitor the soil
    erosion issues in Morocco. Similarly, authors in [262] targeted the issues of
    soil analyses where they used Lumix DMC-LX 3 to take the images and Pix4UAV for
    mapping the results. B. Planting Millions of acres of land are currently under-utilized
    due to being human inaccessible or lack of suitable workers. Safety concerns of
    rough terrain are main reason not to utilize these areas for forestry or agriculture
    purpose. For this purpose, drone based planting systems are being developed that
    decrease planting costs upto 85 percent [263]. Not only cost, but within shorter
    time as some recently developed drones can plant 100,000 trees in a single day
    [264]. These systems shoot pods which include the seeds and necessary nutrients
    required to grow the plant. This method is found very effective for rough terrain;
    most importantly the success rate is more than 75% [265]. Due to the success and
    flexibility they offer, UAVs are being considered the best candidate for plantation
    all over the world, from NASA engineer [266] to countries like Pakistan [267]
    and India [268]. C. Crop Monitoring Crop monitoring is one of tough jobs and facing
    low efficiency due to covering large area. Drones are offering the solutions by
    allowing real-time monitoring of far farms, more accurately and cost-effectively
    comparing with previously used satellite imagery. The Microdrones +m [269] is
    an accessory toolkit which provides aerial imaging facility to observe the crop
    nutrients, moisture levels and monitoring of other necessary parameters. A study
    conducted in [270] where authors used UAVs along digital camera to monitor the
    crop conditions. The purpose of the study was to find the relationship between
    the crop spectral characteristics and effect of fertilizer availability for plant
    health. Further, [271] presents an innovative procedure to compute and map the
    3-dimensional geometric characteristics of trees and tree-rows. The generated
    maps can be helpful to understand the relation between the trees’ growth and field
    related factors like its geometry and nutrients ultimately help to optimize the
    crop management operations. D. Irrigation Use of drones for irrigation applications
    is, again, two-fold. On one side, equipping UAVs with a variety of sensors and
    cameras can help to identify areas that are under water stress and conclude what
    irrigation changes are required. At the same time, they can be used for sprinkling
    water and pesticides on the crops precisely, especially in emergency cases, which
    would save both time and wastage. In [272], multispectral images of citrus crops
    were acquired using the fixed-wing UAV, where the retrieved data was used to assess
    and detect structural and physiological changes in the targeted crop. Further,
    [273], [274] are similar efforts in which UAVs were used to estimate the crop
    water stress. Furthermore, UAVs are not only used to analyze the irrigation properties
    but also provide solutions by sprinkling water precisely over the water stress
    areas as in [275]. Due to this application of UAVs, they are being considered
    the newest water-saving tool, while their use is helping not only to increase
    watering efficiency but also detect possible pooling or leaks in irrigation. Examples
    like ’JT20L-606’ [276] and ’AGRASMG-1’ [277] are specialized drones that were
    developed and are being used for this purpose. E. Plant Counting and Gap Detection
    Precision agriculture critically needs the spatial data on crop density when making
    decisions during various applications. The quantity and plant numbering not only
    reflects the field emergence but allows better and more precise assessment of
    the yield production, in fact, determining the crop fate. Again, UAVs are offering
    flexible solutions for this purpose. In [278], authors performed digital counting
    of Maize plants with the help of UAVs. Further, in [279], authors proposed a method
    in which they used UAVs to estimate the density of wheat plants at the emergence
    stage while a Sony ILCE α5100L RGB camera was used to take the images. F. Spraying
    the Pesticides/Herbicides Similar to irrigation, UAVs can be used to spray herbicides/
    pesticides on crops, but their use for these applications is more critical. Spraying
    application would be highly efficient compared to current procedures; herbicides/pesticides
    are usually sprayed over the entire farm, which is not required in most cases.
    If using an UAV to spray herbicide, it can spray directly on the unwanted weeds
    or can target the affected areas only. Furthermore, as spraying using drones would
    be highly targeted, the drone would figure out and spray as per requirements,
    helping to reduce the overall expenditures. Handling the sudden environment changes
    like wind direction or speed is another issue for an UAV especially when being
    used for spraying applications. For this purpose, [280] proposed a computer based
    system that autonomously adopt the UAV control rules to keep precise pesticide
    deposition. G. Health Assessment Scanning crops with visible and Infrared (IR)
    light sensors fitted on drones can identify which plants may be infected by bacteria
    or fungus. Using UAVs, this can be done frequently and with flexibility. The early
    detection of any such issues helps to prevent the disease being spread to other
    plants or crop areas. Multispectral images can help to detect the disease or sickness
    at early stages even before reaching the level in which it is possible to detect
    with the human eye. Experiments done in [280] present the data collection campaign
    performed over a sorghum crop which was severely damaged by white grubs. Further,
    in [281], UAVs are used to collect data from ground-based sensors, including a
    chlorophyll meter, water potential meter, and spectroradiometer, and the collected
    information was used to evaluate the plant health and crop condition, ultimately
    reflecting the ground truth. H. Detection/Recognition of Plant Species Recently,
    UAVs are being started to detect and recognize the plant species, especially those
    are considered extinct or remains only few on our Earth. An UAV is a best candidate
    to perform this task as it can go in very remote locations those are almost inaccessible
    to humans. As National Tropical Botanical Garden (NTBG) stated that, Hibiscadelphus
    woodi, a Hawaiian flower, which thought to be extinct in 2009, is discovered on
    a vertical cliff face using the drone [282]. Similarly, using the special cameras
    that can detect the forest biomass and fuel, forest fuel estimation is possible
    through UAVs which is mostly being done from radars and satellites [283], [284].
    SECTION VI. Food Safety and Transportation With the increasing population, we
    have to feed around 25% more mouths until 2050, as compared to 2010, which appears
    to be a monumental task when considering the vast hunger issues that the world
    is currently facing. The numbers are shocking, as more than one-quarter of the
    planet’s population suffers from malnutrition [285] and nearly one billion people
    are chronically hungry [286]. Considering this current hunger scenario, it could
    be big ask to feed the new billions of mouths in the future. In order to handle
    the situation, some believe the solution lies simply in growing more food. This
    has also been reinforced by a latest research, published in the journal Bioscience,
    which concludes that from the present time until 2050, the rise in total food
    production should be in the bracket of 25–70%. [287]. However, what if someone
    tells you that there’s already enough food currently grown on farms to feed 10
    billion people? [288]. Yes, the good news is that we are already producing enough
    food for that many people; however, it is a crucial matter to figure out that
    how to distribute this food while maintaining its quality. Considering this fact,
    one can say that increasing the food production is also important, but transporting
    the existing available food safely and efficiently to more people is the real
    subject of issue of the food industry [289]. A comprehensive report regarding
    the future food requirements published by World Resources Institutes (WRI) in
    2018, highlights that we need sustainable food industry to feed 10 billion people
    by 2050. The report suggests a five-course menu of solutions to tackle the future
    food issues where “reduction in food losses and waste” is declared as the first
    and most important course [290]. Further it conclude that, reducing the food loss
    and waste only by 25% can help to reduce the food gap by 12%, the land gap by
    27% and greenhouse gas mitigation gap by 15%. To have better idea, detailed figures
    about the food loss are highlighted in figure 12 based on various geographical
    locations and considering the stages along food supply chain where these losses
    are occurring. FIGURE 12. Food losses occurring along food supply chain [290].
    Show All Other than WRI, the figures released by United Nations’ FAO are also
    shocking as it is estimated that one-third of all the global food produced for
    human use, valued at $1 trillion, is lost or wasted each year [291]. The US food
    waste alone represents 1.3% of its total GDP [292]. Based on these scary figures,
    it can be concluded that food waste is massive market inefficiency—the kind of
    which does not persist in other industries [293]. Although, the loss of $1 trillion
    has its own worth, but, more crucially, environmental implications of these losses
    are real, such as the water wasted to produce the food that is never eaten being
    equal to the water that can fulfill the needs of all of Africa [285]. Furthermore
    the CO2 emissions that resulted during the growing process of this food are equivalent
    to removing every car off the road across the world [290]. Moreover, according
    to another study conducted by FAO, if you consider food waste as a source of greenhouse
    gas emissions, it would be the third biggest emitter in the world behind only
    China and the United States [294]. In addition, when food waste goes to the landfill,
    where it mostly ends up, it decomposes in the absence of oxygen and produces methane,
    which is 23 times more potent than carbon dioxide in terms of negative effects.
    In short, every which way you look at it; food waste is a major culprit in destroying
    our planet. Among all perishable food produced in the world today, only 10% is
    preserved properly [295]. When we talk about most of the developed countries,
    a robust food cold chain is maintained where essential quality checks are followed,
    entailing temperature-regulated refrigerated warehouses to refrigerated trucks
    to ensure that food gets from farm to market safely. On the other hand, many developing
    countries lack such proper cold chain infrastructure, simply resulting the majority
    of food spoiling when being transported to the end-user. Considering this fact,
    there is a huge opportunity to cut food waste and improve food distribution by
    simply implementing a controlled-temperature transportation system. Based on the
    facts, one can conclude that increasing food production is not sufficient to achieve
    food security, but, rather, some practical actions are required to find skillful
    ways for efficient distribution of the already available food. There are different
    ways to monitor and control food temperature. The manual method of checking a
    thermometer and recording the temperature has many drawbacks, where someone must
    actually do it and, most importantly, take the readings correctly. On other side,
    implementing an automatic method that uses wireless sensors to electronically
    measure and record temperatures can substantially improve food safety. This method
    allows for a continuous data stream of temperatures simply—24 hours a day, 7 days
    a week. By doing so, temperatures can be recorded consistently and on time, leaving
    little room for interpretation; in short, the entire process is based on facts
    and nothing more. Further, utilizing the recent technologies, the recorded data
    can be stored in the Cloud and accessed via any type of internet-connected device.
    Notifications can be established that will send real-time alerts if the temperature
    strays outside preset limits, allowing for immediate action to remedy the situation.
    Further, IoT offers predictive maintenance and indicate when the monitoring equipment
    itself is going to end its useful life so it can be replaced before it fails and
    compromises product quality. These are only couple of scenarios, now if we consider
    the figures presented in figure 12, IoT has the potential to monitor and keep
    the food quality at every stage of the supply chain, from production to consumption.
    A research study conducted by Indian School of Business in which students worked
    with a local grower to transport fruits and vegetables in refrigerated trucks
    from Punjab to Bangalore, a distance of more than 2,500 km through rough roads
    under high temperatures. The results were highly encouraging to implement the
    cold chain to transport the agriculture products. The out of conducted study brought
    benefits in three ways: (1) increased food shelf-life from one week to two months;
    (2) an up to 23% higher profit for everyone linked in the supply chain was observed;
    (3) a 76% reduction of food wastage (post-harvest). Besides all this, another
    critical factor is the emission of greenhouse gases was observed to be reduced
    by 16% [296]. To provide the recommended environment, a device with supported
    technology can be installed at the storage site, even in transport trucks. Further,
    it is linked to an online dashboard that can be configured to send alerts in the
    event of abnormal temperature levels to trigger swift remedial action. Some of
    key technologies available for this purpose and their use cases are mentioned
    here. A. Compliancemate Compliance with hazard analysis and critical control points
    (HACCP) offers a food safety and quality monitoring program which collects temperature
    data inside coolers and other kitchen equipment continuously. For example, its
    integration with Touchblock is used to capture temperatures in coolers and prep
    rooms at every minute [297]. B. Laird’s Sentrius A battery-powered and long-range
    integrated sensor platform that leverages the benefits of LoRaWAN and Bluetooth
    Low Energy (BLE) connectivity. It provides LoRaWAN options at 868/915 MHz, based
    on the Semtech SX1272 and Nordic nRF51 silicon. Further, it offers high RF performance
    in a precise temperature and humidity. Two major series, including RS1xx and RG1xx
    (multi-wireless gateways), work together in order to provide Cloud-based services.
    Most importantly, it requires an inexpensive endpoint radio and a more sophisticated
    base station to manage the network. As compared to LoRa, Sigfox communication
    tends to be better if it is headed up from the endpoint to the base station. Although
    it supports the bidirectional functionality, its capacity going from the base
    station back to the endpoint is constrained, as it provides less link width going
    down than going up. C. CCP Smart Tag (RC4) CCP claims to be a complete monitoring
    solution for the food service and food retail industry [298]. It is capable to
    automate the temperature environment which meets the food safety regulations suggested
    for various food items. Further, temperature and other data are interpreted and
    viewed on a service provider Cloud platform via web and mobile applications. D.
    Tempreporter In compliance with HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points),
    it is used to monitor temperatures 24/7. Further, it logs the readings automatically.
    Reports are auto-filled by considering HACCP & HPRA (Health Products Regulatory
    Authority) recommendations regarding temperature monitoring. According to Finistere
    Ventures report, as of 2018, around $2 billion has been invested globally in AgTech.
    Several investments are expected to cross these figures in 2019. Considering the
    future needs of IoT in agriculture applications, almost all leading technological
    giants are supporting this progress in their own way. Table 5 provides a list
    of several of the leading global organizations who have proposed and are proposing
    initiatives in AgTech, especially in regard to IoT-based agriculture solutions.
    TABLE 5 Current Status and Future Vision of Major Technological Giants Regarding
    the IoT in Agriculture Industry SECTION VII. Current Challenges and Future Expectations
    According to a plan announced in 2015 under “The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”,
    the UN and international community set a target to end hunger by 2030. However,
    recent figures released by WHO (World Health Organization) do not look encouraging
    enough to support the agenda, as more than 800 million people worldwide are facing
    the food shortage—one out of every nine people [313]. Although these figures are
    quite alarming on their own, what is more shocking is the quality of food. Other
    than availability, the quality of food is becoming another serious issue and even
    more critical. According to a research supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
    published in “The Lancet”, either shortage or poor diets are diverting 11 million
    people to an early grave annually, making it more deadly than smoking [314]. The
    research, which reflects the effect of poor diet on health, was conducted in 195
    countries from 1990 to 2017 and concluded that one out of five deaths per year
    could be prevented by providing better diet. The report summarizes that, globally,
    a diet lower in whole grains was the most common and leading risk factor for deaths.
    Other than the basic food needs, per capita incomes of most of the countries in
    2050 are expected to be a multiple as compared to today’s levels [315]. Such an
    increase in income will result in a more health-conscious population that expects
    quality food that is rich in fiber and other minerals. Trends, like increased
    population where the world needs to feed one third more mouths with increased
    demand of quality food, show that food demands continue to grow rapidly. In response
    to all this, overall crop production needs to increase not only for food but cash-crops
    are also required to grow in order to fulfill the demands of industry, like cotton
    and rubber, and, most importantly, increasing demands for bioenergy like ethanol.
    Figure 13 presents a snapshot of major challenges that future agriculture expected
    to face in 2050. This diagram, basically presents three major issues: how to feed
    around 10 billion people; without using more land and; by reducing the emission
    of greenhouse gasses by more than 60%. However, when we look closely then these
    three challenges lead to many new, including smaller rural labor, continuously
    shrinking arable land, water scarcity, harsh weather conditions, and many more.
    As the world moves toward urbanization, the rural populations are not only shrinking
    but are rapidly aging; hence, fewer and younger growers need to step up to take
    the responsibility. Such population imbalance and generation shift can create
    serious implications, not only for the remaining workforce but also for production
    patterns and land tenure. Furthermore, on one side, arable land is shrinking while,
    among the remaining regions, many are only suitable for specific crops due to
    certain geographic and environmental limitations. Moreover, harsh climate changes
    are starting to affect almost every aspect of crop production. These changes are
    expected to enhance the intensity of many of the existing long-term environmental
    issues, like droughts, floods, groundwater depletion, soil degradation, etc. FIGURE
    13. Major challenges for sustainable future agriculture. Show All During the 20th
    century, in most regions, growers kept following the traditional agricultural
    methods while trying to meet the food demands by greater utilizing fertilizers
    and pesticides. Implementation of such chemicals is facing two issues: these can
    help to increase the production to only a certain level and, at the same time,
    their blind use is creating irreversible implications to the environment. Furthermore,
    implementation of any resource, like water, seed, fertilizers, and pesticides,
    uniformly across an entire field is not going to solve the problem. Rather than
    dealing with every farm and crop in same way, farmers need to use these resources
    according to the requirement of specific areas, even if they have to consider
    the requirement of every plant. Focusing on the above discussion, one can feel
    that the farms and relevant crop operations need to be run differently than the
    past practices. One of the major reasons is the advancements in technology, including
    sensors, communication methods, machines, and even robots. In fact, technology
    has proved this already, as, in most developing countries; more than 50% of the
    population is somehow engaged in the agriculture industry yet are far behind in
    providing both the quantity and quality when compared with the developed countries,
    where less than 2% of the population is performing much better. The difference
    is clear, as countries like Australia, the US, and most of Europe are pioneers
    to employ the advanced tools and methods multiplying the crop yields during the
    last five decades. These comparisons show that recent technologies and advanced
    methods are making the farms not only highly profitable but safe and environmentally
    friendly. Considering this scenario, future agriculture is expected to evolve
    as a high-tech industry where interconnected systems will enjoy the luxury of
    artificial intelligence and Big Data facilities. The resultant systems will converge
    into a single unit where farm machinery and management, starting from seeding
    to production forecasting, are combined. By involving the advanced technologies
    like agricultural robots, Big Data, and cloud-computing artificial intelligence,
    agriculture can create a new era of superfusion. Following are some of the key
    technologies and methods that need to apply; focusing to achieve sustainable future
    agriculture. A. Wireless Sensors and the IoT Wireless sensors placed strategically
    around fields are providing farmers with up-to-date information in real time,
    allowing them to adapt the care that the crops need, which results in higher food
    production with less waste. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are also being used
    to inform farmers about nearly all aspects of their crop growth as well as about
    the readiness state of the farm’s machinery, thus, helping in preventing loss
    of crop as well as enhancing the readiness of the equipment which cultivates it.
    WSNs with GPS capability are helping tractors in compensating for uneven terrain
    and optimizing land preparation for growing crops. Recently, advances in image
    recognition and digital signal processing gave even more capabilities to WSN to
    accurately determine crop quality and health. In order to make agriculture sustainable,
    the use of the IoT will be at the center and forefront in agricultural operations.
    This includes everything from water and power usage, crop transportation, farm
    machinery operation and maintenance alerts, and market price updates. The IoT
    has the capability to make these tasks streamlined and more predictable by recognizing
    the crop’s needs at every stage. It has already proved a breakthrough and is further
    going to change the way we look at various agriculture activities by providing
    the farmer control over their land and assets in an unprecedented way, thus, maximizing
    their effectiveness and efficiency. Further, the future of the IoT can be shaped
    by the phenomenal advances in WSNs and the fifth generation (5G) of cellular mobile
    communication technologies to provide farmers with real-time data and information
    anytime and everywhere their land is. Based on recent success, it is estimated
    that more than 75 million IoT-based devices will be operating in the agriculture
    industry by 2020. Further, the average farm is expecting to generate 4.1 million
    data points on a daily bases by 2050 [316]. B. Communication Real success of IoT
    in agriculture largely depends on advances in connectivity. From telecom’s perspective,
    providing mainly connectivity and other value-added services has an immense potential
    and can influence the entire chain greatly [317]. Most of the telecom operators
    around the globe offer connectivity services, but such services only represent
    a tiny amount of the entire smart agriculture market. Considering its worth, especially
    in rural areas, the cellular operators have to offer a new range of services targeting
    the growers’ demands. Accepting the fact that most of the community belong to
    this industry are not highly educated and mostly unaware of new technologies,
    hence the operator should provide end-to-end solutions other than just providing
    the connectivity. If so, then it will certainly help to increase the market share
    of mobile and telecom operators. Further, these operators need partnerships with
    the investors to provide end-to-end solutions, which demands higher investment,
    even before advantages can be seen. The results of success when inviting the investors
    depend on the nature of the partnership and the involved bodies, like device manufacturers,
    solution providers, non-cellular connectivity service providers, system integrators,
    etc. On one side, the outcome of this partnership would help operators to enter
    deeper into the industry, ultimately boosting their market share. At the same
    time, this opportunity can create strong relationships among the organizations
    and farmers to help to educate them about the benefits of smart agriculture. The
    success of cellular technology is only possible when service providers leverage
    its real benefits like portability, flexibility and luxury of two way communication
    to offer low cost but customized solutions. They must provide what the farmer
    is in need, at the place they choose. Furthermore, to provide fast penetration
    in agriculture industry, policy changes are required in order to provide access
    of reliable and quality inputs. The research conducted in [172] which considers
    23 studies where mostly belong to developing countries, concludes that the cellular
    services and smartphone technology carry a promising future for smallholder farmers
    being capable to improve their yields. Furthermore, licensed LPWA (low-power wide-area)
    technology is expected to be a game changer for smart agriculture. Due to its
    characteristics and supported services including low power consumption and efficient
    coverage are well suited to the geography and economics of agriculture hence expected
    to play a critical role in future smart farming. Consequently, narrowband IoT
    (NB-IoT) got strong industry support and becoming an effective global standard
    for LPWA connectivity. It has the potential to provide major connectivity changes
    in agriculture industry by changing the perceptions about Internet capabilities.
    Believing in its future success, it is expected that leading cellular operators
    with strong IoT ambitions can generate significant revenues by providing smart
    agriculture services when collaborating with LPWA technology providers. In order
    to achieve long term success of these short, mid and long range communication
    technologies, necessary steps for infrastructure construction are required towards
    attaining the technology-based agriculture. C. UAVs and Other Robots Drones are
    being widely used by farmers for crop growth monitoring and as a means to combat
    hunger and other harmful environmental impacts. Furthermore, they are being used
    to spray water and other pesticides efficiently, considering the tough terrains,
    especially when the crops possess different heights. Drones have proven their
    value, not only in terms of spraying speed but precision, as well, when compared
    with traditional machinery of same purpose. With recent advances in swarm technology
    and mission-based control, groups of drones equipped with heterogeneous sensors,
    including 3D cameras, can work together to provide farmers with comprehensive
    capabilities to manage their land. With the inclusion of UAVs in agriculture,
    farmers are able to put their eye in sky, but many challenges need to be addressed
    in order to enjoy the real advantages of this technology, especially the integration
    of other technologies and how to use them in poor weather conditions. Beside drones,
    robotics within agriculture have improved productivity and resulted in higher
    and faster yields. Such robots, like spraying and weeding robots, are reducing
    agrochemical use. Robots equipped with laser and camera guidance are being used
    for identifying and removing weeds without human intervention. They navigate between
    rows of crops on their own, ultimately increasing the yield with reduced manpower.
    More recently, plant-transplanting and fruit-picking robots are emerging to add
    a new level of efficiency to traditional methods. D. Machine Learning and Analytics
    Machine learning and analytics are used to mine data for trends. In farming, machine
    learning is used, for example, to predict which genes are best suited for crop
    production. This has been giving growers all over the world the best seed varieties,
    those which are highly suitable to respective locations and climate conditions.
    Machine-learning algorithms, on the other hand, have indicated which products
    are of high demand and which products are currently unavailable in the market.
    Thus, for the farmer, this has given valuable clues for future farming. Recent
    advances in machine learning and analytics will make it possible for farmers to
    accurately classify their products and weed out less desirable crops before they
    arrive to customers. E. Power Consumption, Renewable Energy, Microgrids, and Smart
    Grids Despite its future opportunities, smart agriculture facing some limitations
    that are holding back the growth of IoT. One of them is power issue as due to
    its nature; smart farming requires wide use of energy. Among the main reasons
    of extensive power consumption some are including, long term sensor deployment,
    use of GPS repeatedly and transmission of sensed data via GPRS. Traditionally,
    farmers in remote areas have bought and utilized renewable energy sources randomly
    and at a hefty price, which has limited their ability to use them in farming to
    a great extent. However to solve the power issues in long term, deep analysis
    of power consumption sources like remote data transmission can help to tackle
    the problem at some extent. Further, smart grids and microgrids, however, lend
    themselves to seamless integration of distributed energy sources (DERs), thus,
    making them appealing for adoption by farmers. The emergence of smart power meters
    has further given the farmers the confidence to invest in DER, especially since
    they have the option to sell the excess power to the grid. Recent advances in
    energy storage devices, integrated electricity and heat systems will make DER
    even more attractive for farmers, as they will be able to store energy and use
    the heat generated by cooling and heating when needed. However, healthy investment
    requirements and public perceptions are two other barriers on the way to making
    these solutions successful. F. Hydroponics and Vertical Farming (VF) Other than
    employing the advanced technologies, new agricultural practices can be very crucial
    to overcome the geographic and resource limitation challenges. On one side, arable
    land is shrinking, and, at the same time, it is estimated that three million people
    around the globe are migrating to cities, resulting in more pressure on the existing
    limited urban resources [318]. Considering this rapid migration, it is estimated
    that by 2030, 60% of the world’s population is going to depend on cities, and
    this number is further expected to rise to 68% until 2050 [319]. Considering both
    of these issues, it could be disaster for food production in the near future with
    current agriculture practices. VF is an answer of these issues, as it meets the
    challenges of land and water shortage and, at the same time, looks highly suitable
    to be adopted near the cities. VF is portrayed as the answer to the looming shortage
    of food and shrinking arable land, at least in some areas of the world. Further,
    hydroponics can play a key role, as this method lowers the requirements of water
    and space to a great extent. Rapid growths in computer power are propelling scientific
    discoveries in plant nutrition and growth that would make VF even more appealing
    to growers. Along VF and hydroponics, new and advanced solutions are required
    to increase the arable land without disturbing the forests and other natural animal
    habitats. For this, we have to focus on the deserts as these cover one third of
    the Earth’s land surface. The solutions are started already as Norwegian and Chinese
    firms/experts are doing efforts in Dubai, Qatar, Jordan and Chinese deserts [320]–[322].
    Agriculture is not just an industry; in fact, it provides the basis of human society,
    as the goal is not just to grow crops, but the target is the perfection of human
    being. A vibrant and prosperous agriculture sector can provide the basis for a
    happy and healthy society, as recent decades witnessed this. The presence of advance
    technologies, especially the involvement of the IoT, matters a great deal in regard
    to reaching this goal. Environmental issues continue to cage the planet, which
    increases the need for safe and clean agriculture. This is the reason humanity
    is witnessing a second green revolution, largely based on the IoT. The use of
    these technologies makes the farming industry highly productive with reduced labor
    and other resource consumption; same time, minimizing the impact on the environment.
    Our planet has the resources, but we have to learn how to utilize them wisely
    and precisely. Sensible use of technology can lead us where we can utilize these
    resources efficiently in order to ensure the food security of the current and
    coming generations. For this purpose, we need collective efforts to build such
    institutions that can shape long-term decisions and polices to eliminate hunger
    effectively. On this route, the experience, tools, and support from those nations
    that have succeeded in overcoming hunger should provide to those regions that
    are fighting to feed its local mouths. Although growth in every industry matters,
    growth in agriculture, particularly among small growers, can be highly effective
    to control the undernourishment issues, as more than 70% of the population of
    developing countries belongs to rural areas and somehow depends on agriculture
    sector. SECTION VIII. Conclusion The focus on smarter, better, and more efficient
    crop growing methodologies is required in order to meet the growing food demand
    of the increasing world population in the face of the ever-shrinking arable land.
    The development of new methods of improving crop yield and handling, one can readily
    see currently: technology-weaned, innovative younger people adopting farming as
    a profession, agriculture as a means for independence from fossil fuels, tracking
    the crop growth, safety and nutrition labeling, partnerships between growers,
    suppliers, and retailers and buyers. This paper considered all these aspects and
    highlighted the role of various technologies, especially IoT, in order to make
    the agriculture smarter and more efficient to meet future expectations. For this
    purpose, wireless sensors, UAVs, Cloud-computing, communication technologies are
    discussed thoroughly. Furthermore, a deeper insight on recent research efforts
    is provided. In addition, various IoT-based architectures and platforms are provided
    with respect to agriculture applications. A summary of current challenges facing
    the industry and future expectations are listed to provide guidance to researchers
    and engineers. Based on all this, it can be concluded that every inch of farmland
    is vital to maximize crop production. However, to deal with every inch accordingly,
    the use of sustainable IoT-based sensors and communication technologies is not
    optional—it is necessary. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

    Talk'
  verbatim_quote1: Wireless sensors are facilitating the monitoring of crops constantly
    with higher accuracy and are able to, most importantly, detect early stages of
    unwanted state. This is the reason why modern agriculture involves the usage of
    smart tools and kits, from sowing to crop harvesting and even during storage and
    transportation.
  verbatim_quote2: A significant increase in crop efficiency is expected with the
    use of IoT based techniques, such as crop water stress index (CWSI)-based irrigation
    management [10], [35]. For this purpose, attaining crop canopy at different periods
    and air temperature are needed for the calculation of CWSI.

  analysis: The paper titled "Wireless Sensor Network Effectively Controls Center
    Pivot Irrigation of Sorghum" offers a relevant analysis regarding data source
    selection for automated irrigation systems, though the focus is primarily on the
    effectiveness of wireless sensor networks rather than the broader considerations
    mentioned in the outline point. The study's use of a wireless sensor network (WSN)
    to collect data for irrigation scheduling of grain sorghum demonstrates the feasibility
    of using such networks for irrigation management. The findings suggest that data
    from WSN systems can be used to calculate crop water stress indices that inform
    irrigation decisions, ultimately leading to improved water use efficiency. While
    the paper does not explicitly examine various data volume, frequency, format,
    or sources, the use of real-time data from the WSN aligns with the need for reliable
    and timely data in automated irrigation systems. Furthermore, the study provides
    evidence that wireless sensor networks can deliver data effectively, with delivery
    rates ranging from 90% to 98%, highlighting the viability of these networks for
    data transmission in automated irrigation systems. Overall, the paper provides
    valuable insights into the use of wireless sensor networks for data collection
    and its potential benefits for automated irrigation management, but it has limited

    Automatic irrigation scheduling has been demonstrated using wired sensors and
    sensor network systems with subsurface drip and moving irrigation systems. However,
    there are limited studies that report on crop yield and water use efficiency resulting
    from the use of wireless networks to automatically schedule and control irrigations.
    In this 2011 study, a multinode wireless sensor network (WSN) system was mounted
    onto a six-span center pivot equipped with a commercial variable rate irrigation
    (VRI) system. Data from the WSN was used to calculate an integrated crop water
    stress index (iCWSI) threshold for automatic irrigation scheduling of grain sorghum.
    Crop response to the automatic method was compared with manual irrigation scheduling
    using weekly direct soil water measurements. The WSN system was operational throughout
    98% of the growing season, and the delivery rates for data packets from the different
    nodes ranged between 90% and 98%. Dry grain yields and WUE in the automatic and
    manual treatment plots were not significantly different from each other at any
    of the irrigation levels. Crop water use and WUE were highest in the I80% irrigation
    treatment level. Average seasonal integrated crop water stress indices were negatively
    correlated to irrigation treatment amounts in both the manual and automatic plots
    and correlated well to crop water use. These results demonstrate that it is feasible
    to use WSN systems for irrigation management on a field-scale level. (Download

    Abstract Available supplies of water for irrigation and other uses are becoming
    more limited around the world, and this trend is accelerating. Emerging computerized
    precision irrigation technologies will enable growers to apply water and agrochemicals
    more precisely and site-specifically to match the status and needs of soil and
    plants as determined by the analysis of data from a variety of sensor networks,
    wireless communications systems and decision support systems. Speed control and
    zone control options for site-specific variable rate irritation (SS-VRI) system
    are currently available, with speed control the most common. Site-specific variable
    rate sprinkler irrigation systems are wonderful research tools that can provide
    maximum amounts of information from relatively small areas. A self-propelled SS-VRI
    sprinkler system has been developed for agricultural research applications and
    5 of these systems are now in use. This fully functional research machine has
    been used from 2005 to 2012 and has been very reliable. These SS-VRI systems offer
    many benefits for research and they have tremendous potential for a greater use
    in sprinkler irrigation systems worldwide for both in research and general practice
    to conserve water, fertilizer and energy. Keywords Precision agriculture Decision

    is facing a series of major challenges in providing sufficient food, fiber, and
    fuel to support a growing global population while our water resources, environmental
    health, and available arable land decline and climate changes. In agricultural
    ecosystems, physical and biological processes such as cycling of carbon, water,
    and nutrients are linked with social and economic processes. To achieve sustainability,
    it is essential that we understand how these processes interact, and their impacts
    on the environment through space and time. Innovative approaches will be needed
    to address these issues and maintain a safe and abundant food supply as the agronomic,
    economic and social problems facing production agriculture gain in complexity.
    Irrigation can be fundamentally characterized as a temporal adaptation to seasonal
    and annual variation in rainfall (Turral et al. 2010). Irrigation has shaped the
    economies of many semi-arid and arid areas around the world over many centuries.
    It has stabilized rural communities, increased income and provided many new opportunities
    for economic growth. These practices have enabled human habitation, at times quite
    dense populations, where it otherwise could not exist (Postel 1999). In short,
    irrigated crop production underpins large sections of current society and lifestyles
    throughout the world. Irrigated agricultural activities support diverse components
    of the world’s food chain and provide much of the fruit, vegetables and cereals
    consumed by humans plus the grain fed to animals that are used eventually as human
    food. It also provides much of the feed to sustain animals used for work in many
    parts of the world, and these lands provide considerable sources of food and foraging
    areas for migratory and local birds as well as other wildlife. Irrigated land
    constitutes approximately 18 % of the world’s total cultivated farmland, but currently
    produces more than 40 % of its food and fiber. However, irrigation of lands accounts
    for over 70 % of fresh water consumed in the world, and is also a major user of
    energy for farming operations and pumping. Nevertheless, output from irrigated
    agriculture will have to increase dramatically in the next few decades to help
    meet the projected world food requirements and to maintain food security and irrigation
    will necessarily continue to be a major part of world’s future agricultural production.
    The importance of water and its uneven geographical distribution has made its
    acquisition and use a matter of great contention between various users and nations.
    Population growth, rising standards of living and competing uses are forcing major
    changes in how fresh water is allocated. Agricultural water resources are also
    coming under increasing pressure from environmental and other social issues, including
    declining water tables in many areas, industrial and municipal pollution and escalating
    energy costs. In addition, there is also a persistent loss of arable land to soil
    salination, soil erosion and urbanization, which collectively emphasize the need
    to maximize total irrigated food productivity wherever possible. Thus, current
    water use patterns and practices may not be sustainable in many regions of the
    world. Reduced availability of water and energy for irrigated agriculture will
    require much greater levels of crop and water management than currently in use;
    but this will be difficult, if not impossible, without advanced irrigation methods.
    Higher levels of irrigation management and systems that enable greater efficiency
    of water use can potentially reduce operating costs as well as conserve energy,
    nutrients and water use. The potential to conserve water depends on the capabilities
    of the irrigation system and the commitment of the operator to implement timely
    water-saving practices and technologies (Schütze and Schmitz 2009). 2 Advanced
    Irrigation Systems There are basically three types of irrigation systems: surface
    (which flows by gravity), and pressurized micro and sprinkler systems. Surface
    (also called gravity) irrigation introduces water at the highest elevation point
    in a field and the water flows over the soil surface by gravity. Pressurized irrigation
    systems that include several types of microirrigation and sprinkler systems where
    water is conveyed by pressurized pipes or tubing to a point in the field where
    it is applied by various devices. In addition, pressurized systems commonly function
    as site-specific application methods for fertilizers and other agrochemicals (chemigation),
    which require appropriate management to avoid environmental contamination. Technology
    levels in all three types of systems vary widely, and they all have advantages
    and disadvantages (Hoffman et al. 2007). The design of a water application system
    will determine the maximum potential performance level, whereas management dictates
    the actual benefits realized and the magnitude of any positive or negative ecological
    impacts. Thus, the amount of water that can be conserved by advanced irrigation
    systems and practices depends on the ability of a particular type of irrigation
    system to implement various improved management strategies. Management skills
    are gained through education and technical assistance, but they are maintained
    by the irrigator’s commitment and economic incentives. 3 Microirrigation Methods
    Microirrigation includes drip and microsprinklers. It is a flexible set of technologies
    that can potentially be used on almost every crop, soil type and climatic zone
    if justified economically. It is characterized by the applications of water in
    small amounts using frequent irrigations (i.e. daily). It is also sometimes referred
    to as localized irrigation and can provide numerous crop production and water
    conservation benefits that address many of the water quality and supply challenges
    facing modern irrigated agriculture. Microirrigation acreage is increasing steadily
    worldwide and is fully expected to continue its rapid growth in the foreseeable
    future (Lamm et al. 2007). Novel applications for microirrigation systems, such
    as the reuse of municipal wastewater in turf areas, are providing new opportunities
    for growth. These systems can be laid on the soil surface or buried, and can be
    permanent or temporary installations. They can be used on gardens as well as in
    fields from 0.5 to more than 50 ha. Because of the relatively high capital cost
    of these advanced systems and the need for high levels of management, modern microirrigation
    technologies are typically permanent installations on small blocks of land (e.g.
    <10 ha) of intensively-managed, high-value specialty crops (e.g. vegetables, grapes,
    nuts, fruits and berries). Microirrigation could also become more common in perennial
    forage crops (i.e. alfalfa) and annual row crops such as maize using widely-spaced,
    buried drip lines in areas with limited water supplies or high water costs. Greenhouse
    culture is largely irrigated by microirrigation methods. Year around greenhouse
    production of fresh vegetables, cut flowers and other high-value crops is rapidly
    expanding with some of the largest increases occurring around the Mediterranean
    Basin. All the major factors affecting plant growth can be controlled and managed
    precisely in these conditions, including the environment, water, nutrients, pests
    and diseases. Thus, these growing systems provide the ultimate opportunities for
    the application of many PA concepts. Microirrigation systems are well suited for
    automated adaptive control with real-time sensor feedback and decision making
    capabilities. However, site-specific water management often occurs by default
    as a function of the scales of underlying environmental variability. Microirrigation
    systems are generally designed and installed in small blocks to match the needs
    of particular crop varieties or variations in soil texture and topography across
    a farm. Thus, additional site-specific irrigation within blocks may not be warranted,
    although it is technically possible. A low-cost microirrigation method called
    pitcher or clay pot irrigation (Siyal et al. 2009) is used on some small fields
    (e.g. <0.5 ha) in several areas in northern Africa and Middle East. This labor
    intensive method uses unglazed, porous clay pots which are buried in the ground
    up to their neck to irrigate individual plants (i.e. fruit and nut trees) that
    are typically spaced 1 m or more apart. There may be more than one pitcher per
    plant, which are filled manually with water on at least a daily basis. Water seeps
    out through the unglazed walls of the pitcher to irrigate the crop. The above
    discussion suggests that purposely designed pressurized microirrigation and sprinkler
    methods are the most suitable for advanced forms of site-specific irrigation.
    Of these, most of the following discussion will be directed towards self-propelled,
    continuous move sprinkler irrigation systems, which cover much larger areas than
    microirrigation methods and their use is rapidly expanding (Sadler et al. 2005;
    Evans and King 2012). 4 Self-Propelled Sprinkler Irrigation Systems Self-propelled
    sprinkler irrigation systems such as centre pivots and linear (also called lateral)
    move systems have allowed large scale agricultural development of marginal lands
    that were unsuitable for surface irrigation including areas with light sandy soil
    and a large variation in topography within the same field. These adaptable systems
    have experienced tremendous growth around the world over the past 50 years due
    to their: (1) potential for efficient and uniform water application; (2) high
    degree of automation requiring less labor than most other irrigation methods;
    (3) coverage of large areas; and (4) ability to apply water and labeled agrichemicals
    (chemigation) economically and safely over a wide range of soil, crop and topographic
    conditions. Similar to microirrigation, these systems apply limited amounts of
    water during each irrigation event and require frequent applications. A single
    machine can irrigate fields ranging from about 5 ha to over 200 ha. These large
    machines basically consist of a pipeline (lateral) mounted on motorized structures
    (towers) with large rubber tires. The section between the two towers is called
    a span, which can vary from about 30 to 70 m in length. Sprinkling devices are
    mounted on or below the pipe. Maximum application depths of water applied are
    controlled by varying the speed of machine travel. Field-scale water applications
    by these systems can be quite uniform. A center pivot machine basically rotates
    around a ‘pivot’ at one end, usually in the centre of the field. These continuously
    moving systems can irrigate areas ranging from part circle segments to whole circles.
    Various optional accessories are also available to irrigate portions of field
    corners. Self-propelled linear move sprinkler systems look and perform almost
    identically to centre pivot systems except that they move in straight lines to
    irrigate square- or rectangular-shaped fields. Linear move systems require a global
    positioning system (GPS) or other methods for physical guidance, and they require
    considerably greater management and manual oversight than centre pivot systems.
    Center pivot and linear move sprinkler systems are designed and generally operated
    so as to replace the average water used by the crop over the past few days as
    uniformly as possible across the field. Irrigations are frequent and apply relatively
    low amounts of water so that soil water is ideally maintained at relatively constant
    levels. Application rates and base uniformity are primarily established by the
    sprinkler nozzle package, but the depth of water applied per irrigation with self-propelled
    center pivots and linear move sprinkler systems is generally controlled by the
    travel speed of the machine. Traditionally, irrigation system design and management
    has strived for maximum uniformity of water applications over the entire irrigated
    field. However, agricultural fields are never physically or biologically uniform
    and substantial agronomic and environmental differences can occur. The effects
    of different spatial and temporal sources of variation on management can be additive,
    and the stochastic variation of several interrelated factors across a field can
    affect crop growth, yields and crop quality. Often, the underlying causes of crop
    performance variation are often not well understood, and they can vary substantially
    from field to field and year to year. Some sources of variation such as pest problems
    may have both temporal and spatial considerations. The high frequency of the irrigations
    under these machines potentially reduces the magnitude of variability in soil
    water content in the field. However, stochastic spatial and temporal variability
    of a number of other interrelated factors (e.g., variations in soil properties,
    topography, runoff, within field runoff (also called runon), pests, tillage, fertilization,
    uneven incident precipitation and hail, pesticide carryover effects, and herbicide
    drift from adjacent fields) across a field can still affect crop growth during
    the growing season and from one season to the next. These factors can influence
    management decisions over time, which may also introduce additional in-field variability
    to crop production. Consequently, the center pivot industry is beginning to market
    irrigation systems that can adjust for at least some of this spatial and temporal
    variability, which is typically referred to as site-specific variable rate irrigation
    (SS-VRI). Manufacturers are just starting to offer site-specific controls for
    linear move sprinkler systems. Kranz et al. (2012) has summarized characteristics
    of some of the various currently available commercial site-specific control systems
    and panels. SS-VRI can be defined as the ability to vary water application depths
    spatially across a field to address specific soil, crop and/or other conditions.
    It is included in the spectrum of precision agriculture technologies because advanced
    SS-VRI methods can potentially impose treatments in ways that optimize plant responses
    for each unit of water applied in different areas of the same field. It can also
    include site-specific applications of water-soluble agrochemicals including fertilizers.
    Irrigation management can amplify the negative effects of different sources of
    variation with a field or it can help to minimize these effects depending on the
    grower’s objectives. Site-specific irrigation management strategies can be justified
    to account for variation under non-uniform growing conditions. Reducing areas
    of excess water applications within a field will decrease the potential for runoff,
    limit the movement of nutrients and agrochemicals below the plant root zone and
    create conditions for improving crop yield and quality. Spatial and temporal variation
    can influence irrigation management decisions, and site-specific managers attempt
    to characterize the major sources of variation throughout the growing season.
    However, growers cannot practically manage for all of the many sources of variability.
    Therefore, they tend to group the most critical properties into relatively homogeneous
    management zones within a field as much as possible. Thus, different PA technologies
    may be managed simultaneously at different scales in the same field. For example,
    the smallest zone that a large scale farmer (e.g. >20 ha fields) prefers to manage
    for irrigation is probably in the order of about 5 ha even though other PA technologies
    (e.g. planting and spraying) will often be managed at much smaller scales (e.g.
    0.1 ha). These factors can also accelerate localized leaching of soil nutrients
    and other agrichemicals past the root zone. Field variability can result in excessive
    energy use for pumping, affect irrigation system design initially, and, later,
    management decisions. Furthermore, some management decisions may introduce additional
    sources of within-field variability. Self-propelled center pivot and linear move
    sprinkler irrigation systems are particularly amenable to site-specific approaches
    because of their current levels of automation and large area coverage with a single
    lateral pipe. The definition of sprinklers in these applications includes the
    use of LEPA, bubblers, sprayers, spinners and other related spray techniques to
    apply water. These devices are usually on drop tubes in or just above the crop
    canopy. Impact type sprinklers are generally not included because the methods
    used to vary applied depths of water (e.g., pulse modulation) on commercial systems
    are not compatible in practice. The ability to vary water application along the
    main lateral of a center-pivot system based on position in the field allows the
    field manager to address specific soil and/or slope conditions and avoid areas
    of over- or under irrigation, depending on preset management criteria. By aligning
    irrigation water application with variable water requirements in the field, total
    water use may be reduced, decreasing deep percolation and surface runoff. Reducing
    excess water applications will decrease the potential to move nutrients past the
    plant root zone (Sadler et al. 2000, 2005; King et al. 2009), and fungal disease
    pressure should also decrease. Site-specific application technologies can be used
    to treat small areas of a field with simple on/off sprinkler controls in single
    span-wide treatment areas or to treat the whole field by controlling all spans.
    Thus, site-specific irrigation can potentially provide water conservation benefits
    in cases of overirrigation, erroneous irrigation scheduling, in-season precipitation
    harvesting, or inefficiencies associated with particular crop production practices
    (e.g., potatoes). Some examples of water conservation strategies under full ET
    conditions (minimal water stress throughout season) where site-specific applications
    are potentially able to reduce total water applied include: A major cause of excessive
    water applications can occur when dry areas appear in a center-pivot irrigated
    field; irrigators tend to run the irrigation systems longer and more often to
    ensure adequate water across the whole field. These poor management practices
    result in much of the area being over-irrigated, and large amounts of water are
    wasted to compensate for suspected drought in relatively small areas. Site-specifically
    varying water applications can assist in addressing the management decisions that
    lead to localized, within-field drought and help conserve water, but they do not
    address the root causes. Water can also be conserved by applying less water to
    hillsides to reduce within-field runoff to low areas, to improve yields by eliminating
    water ponding in low areas, or to purposefully manage wet areas to reduce the
    extent of waterlogging problems. Water application amounts are generally high
    for the first span from the pivot point to the first tower even though application
    rates are low because it moves much more slowly than the outer towers. This area
    is typically either overwatered by as much as 20 %, because the available nozzle
    selections do not allow for the correct application of water, or too dry since
    the nozzles are very small and prone to plugging. The often-wetted foliage in
    this area also has higher incidences of fungal diseases. One option is to turn
    off every other sprinkler along the first span for one or two rotations, and then
    turn on the sprinklers that are off and turn off the sprinklers that are on for
    one or two rotations. Another approach to eliminate both the overwatering and
    plugging problems within the first span area is to use relatively large nozzle
    sizes and site-specifically pulse the sprinklers on and off, applying the desired
    amount over time. Reduce or eliminate irrigation in wet areas in a field that
    develop from precipitation runoff, subsurface flow, high water table, springs,
    or unavoidable irrigation runoff. Manage soil water deficits on a spatial basis
    to maximize the opportunity to capture in-season precipitation in humid climates
    for subsequent use as crop evapotranspiration. The development of control and
    management technologies that can spatially and temporally direct the amount and
    frequency of appropriate agrochemical applications by site-specific self-propelled
    irrigation systems could also be very powerful tools that could increase productivity
    while reducing total water applications and minimizing adverse water quality impacts.
    Evans and King (2012) conducted an analysis of several published simulation studies
    comparing conventional and SS-VRI management and reported water savings of 0–26
    %. Ironically for well-watered crop production, water savings from site-specific
    irrigation may be greatest in humid climates by spatially optimizing use of non-uniform
    growing season precipitation. In arid and semi-arid climates, the greatest potential
    water savings could come from highly managed deficit irrigation strategies (managed
    drought stress). 5 Site-Specific Sprinkler Irrigation Technologies Recent innovations
    in low-voltage sensor and wireless radio frequency (RF) data communications combined
    with advances in Internet technologies offer tremendous opportunities for development
    and application of real-time management systems for agriculture. These have enabled
    implementation of advanced state-of-the-art water conservation measures with self-propelled
    sprinkler systems such as SS-VRI for economically viable, broad scale crop production
    with full or limited water supplies. SS-VRI technologies use many of the same
    management tools as other precision agriculture technologies, and make it possible
    to vary water and agrochemical (chemigation) applications to meet the specific
    needs of a crop in each unique zone within a field. However, site-specific sprinkler
    irrigation technologies and strategies are not a silver bullet for conserving
    water and energy; and they must also be integrated with other state-of-the-art
    farming technologies for maximum potential benefit (Sadler et al. 2005). Basically,
    any water application device used on self-propelled sprinkler systems can be utilized
    for site-specific management of water and agrichemicals applied by the irrigation
    system. Water application methods commonly used on self-propelled sprinkler irrigation
    systems are high elevation sprinkler (usually impact style) head applications
    mounted on the top of the main pipe and medium elevation spray application heads
    (MESA), low elevation spray application heads (LESA) and low energy precision
    application (LEPA) methods. MESA is the most common method used on self-propelled
    irrigation systems in northern Great Plains region. Early work on LEPA was directed
    towards achieving relatively uniform application depths (Lyle and Bordovsky 1981,
    1983, 1995; Bordovsky et al. 2003). Schneider (2000) reported that LEPA could
    potentially achieve application efficiencies greater than 95 % and that MESA was
    about 85 % depending on management. Application depths on self-propelled sprinkler
    systems are generally controlled by the speed of the machine. However, this is
    not sufficient under site-specific conditions where variable amounts are needed
    along the length of the machine. It is possible to control every sprinkler individually,
    but the management level may increase to the point that the system is not practical
    because growers probably cannot manage areas less than 0.4–0.5 ha within a field
    in other cultural aspects of their operation. However, individual sprinkler control
    would allow more accurate site-specific applications to irregularly shaped areas.
    Increasing the number of sprinklers per bank would decrease cost, but the control
    system would lose some ability to adequately match pre-selected treatment areas.
    Controlling sprinkler heads in groups 10–15 m wide is generally a practical compromise
    to match operational limits (Evans et al. 2000; Sadler et al. 2000). Types of
    SS-VRI Sprinkler Irrigation Systems. In the past few years some commercial companies
    began marketing center pivot control panels with an option to change center pivot
    travel speed in increments ranging from 1 to 10° as the machine rotates around
    the field. This tactic effectively changes application depths in each defined
    radial sector of the field, and no additional hardware is needed compared to a
    standard machine (some may need a GPS). This practice is commonly referred to
    as speed or sector control. It could also be referred to as variable depth irrigation,
    although some erroneously refer to it as variable rate irrigation. Nevertheless,
    field variability seldom occurs in long, narrow triangular-shaped parcels and
    adjusting machine speed may not always be a sufficient level of control because
    soil and crop conditions often vary substantially in the radial direction. Consequently,
    center pivot manufacturers are also offering site-specific variable rate irrigation
    systems that can differentially apply water site-specifically to irregularly shaped
    areas or management zones. This is referred to as zone control. Specialized equipment
    such as control, panels, many valves, supplemental wiring and a GPS are required
    to control the irrigation in each management zone. Most zone control SS-VRI systems
    vary water application depths by various forms of pulse modulation (on–off cycling
    of spray-type sprinkler heads) for a given machine speed. Valves are located on
    every sprinkler head or groups of heads. Water is then applied to each zone by
    controlling water output amounts from each group of heads along the length of
    the machine depending on their location in the field. Zone control has a larger
    potential for achieving efficient management of water and energy than speed control,
    and is the general focus of this paper. The most common site-specific sprinkler
    irrigation systems in use today are speed control systems, and it is anticipated
    that much of the short term growth will likely occur with these types of systems.
    Speed control technologies are probably being used close to their technical capacity
    to improve water productivity at this time. However, zone control systems can
    achieve the same effects provided by speed control, but with greater flexibility
    and provide more management options (Evans et al. 2012, 2013). Site-specific control
    systems manage water application amounts by controlling individual or grouped
    sprinkler nozzle assemblies. These technologies can be used to treat predefined
    large areas in a whole field or a range of small areas within a field with simple
    on/off sprinkler controls. Small area (e.g., 0.5–10 ha) site-specific systems
    can be used to address issues in well defined, localized problem areas where the
    cost of a full precision irrigation control system may not be justified such as
    under the first span from the pivot point to avoid overirrigation or minimize
    foliar disease incidence in that area. These technologies can also be used to
    treat diverse areas of varying sizes within a large field by variably controlling
    groups of sprinkler heads across all spans as the machine moves. SS-VRI Systems
    for Agricultural Research. There is little doubt that SS-VRI systems are wonderful
    research tools. They can be used to adjust water applications for artificial variability
    (e.g., research treatments) on top of natural variability within a field. For
    example, these systems could serve as an efficient, replicated screening method
    to identify drought and heat tolerance of various genotypes at a number of different
    locations to advance crop breeding efforts. SS-VRI systems could also be established
    to impose a range of abiotic stresses (deficit irrigation) using a line source
    sprinkler concept to develop water production functions (yields vs. range of available
    water). Another use would be to evaluate the effects of various degrees of potential
    climate change in different area on various cropping systems by simulating changing
    rainfall patterns and other conditions. SS-VRI research systems can be used to
    develop and test sensor networks that measure crop response to abiotic (e.g.,
    water deficits) and biotic (e.g., insect and disease) stresses for improved management.
    Data from these types of experiments would also be quite beneficial in developing
    and testing various models and strategies for automatic control of commercial
    SS-VRI systems. A case study of a SS-VRI system currently being used for agricultural
    research is presented below. 6 Case Study of SS-VRI Systems for Agricultural Research
    An example of research using SS-VRI system for research is a project conducted
    on a 4 ha field at the Montana State University (MSU) Eastern Agricultural Research
    Center) farm (near Sidney, MT (47.73º N, 104.15º W) over five years from 2005
    through 2009. The site-specific irrigation control system was designed to implement
    research comparing tillage method (strip till vs clean, conventional till) by
    irrigation method (LEPA vs MESA) in a two year, irrigated crop rotation of sugar
    beet (Beta vulgaris L.) and malting barley (Hordeum vulgare). The soil was classified
    as a relatively heavy Savage clay loam (fine, smectitic, frigid Vertic Argiustolls)
    with 21 % sand, 46 % silt, and 33 % clay. Average field slope was about 0.5 %
    to the east. The research was laid out in fifteen east–west strips parallel to
    the bi-directional travel of the linear move irrigation system (Fig. 1). Fourteen
    of these strips were used for research, but all fifteen were capable of site-specific
    irrigation. Each research strip was divided into four plots with two plots irrigated
    with MESA and two with LEPA for a total of 56 plots. Each 15 m by 24 m plot including
    buffers was planted either to sugar beet or malting barley, which alternated from
    year to year. Half of the plots were irrigated with MESA and the others with LEPA
    each year. There were 15 m alleys across the middle and ends of the block for
    turning farm equipment, and 1.2 m wide alleys between the sides of all plots.
    Fig. 1 Plot layout diagram of the field where the site-specific controls were
    implemented (Evans et al. 2010) Full size image All plots were irrigated with
    a Valley (Valmont Industries, Inc., Valley, NE) 244 m, 5 span, self-propelled
    linear move sprinkler irrigation system including the cart, which was installed
    in the spring of 2003. A diesel engine powered an electrical generator (480 V,
    3 phase) was located on the cart that provided electricity for the tower motors,
    cart motors, irrigation water pump, air compressor and control valves. A buried
    wire alignment system was used with antennas located in the middle of the machine.
    The linear move machine used a screened floating pump intake in a level ditch
    as its water supply. Nominal operating pressure was about 250 kPa. Two double
    direction boom backs were installed at each of the towers (although not at the
    cart) because the machine irrigated in both directions. Spans were 48.8 m in length
    except for the center span with the guidance system which was a 47.5 m span. The
    machine moved at about 2.1 m min−1 at the 100 % setting. A Valley CAMS Pro control
    panel (Valmont Industries, Valley, NE) was used to turn the machine on or off
    and control machine ground speed. A separate programmable logic controller (PLC)
    was designed and fabricated with the purpose of being able to irrigate every plot
    with either MESA or with LEPA. Individual, pneumatically activated solenoid valves
    were installed on every sprinkler head and controlled in banks of five MESA or
    thirteen LEPA heads. The PLC-based control system activated grouped networks of
    electric over air-activated control valves. Thirty 15-meter wide banks of sprinklers
    were controlled with this system (15 MESA banks, 15 LEPA banks.) Both the depth
    and method of irrigation were varied depending on the location of each plot in
    the field. When not being used, low-cost pneumatic cylinders lifted the LEPA heads
    above the MESA heads to avoid spray interference when the MESA is operating over
    a given plot width and length (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 Photograph of the LEPA heads lifted
    above the crop canopy and avoiding interference with the MESA spray head water
    distribution patterns and LEPA heads in operation in the adjacent strip (Evans
    et al. 2010) Full size image The amount of water applied was adjusted by pulsing
    heads on and off (pulse modulation) to achieve a target depth based on a digital
    map stored in the PLC (or in a remote base computer) of depths for each nozzle
    location as the machine moved down the field. Water was applied to meet the calculated
    actual evapotranspiration of each crop using data from a nearby agricultural weather
    station reconciled with weekly neutron probe soil moisture readings. Equivalent
    depths of water were applied for both irrigation methods for the same crop. Distributed
    Sensor Systems and Control. A distributed wireless sensor network (WSN) was integrated
    into the existing site-specific linear move sprinkler irrigation system described
    above. Field conditions were monitored by six in-field sensor stations with Campbell
    CR200 dataloggers (Campbell Scientific, Inc, Logan, UT) distributed across the
    field based on a soil property map and monitored soil moisture, soil temperature,
    and air temperature. The CS616 water content reflectometers (Campbell Scientific,
    Inc, Logan, UT) were calibrated with a neutron probe and individually identified
    for their response ranges at each zone. All in-field sensory data were sampled
    on 10 s intervals. A nearby weather station monitors micrometeorological information
    on the field, i.e., air temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, wind speed,
    wind direction, and solar radiation. Communication signals from the sensor network,
    weather station and PLC irrigation controller to the base station were successfully
    interfaced using low-cost Bluetooth wireless radio communication. Results. The
    overall focus of the project was to assess the environmental impacts of cultural
    practices and improved management of water, nutrient, and chemical applications
    as part of a multi-year team project involving several scientists from the location.
    Practical application of site-specific irrigation technologies with the variability
    of the research combined with natural variability is certainly more complicated
    and more challenging than general site-specific field irrigation. This project
    illustrates it is possible to effectively install and operate precision site-specific
    irrigation systems on self-propelled linear move and center pivot systems. The
    knowledge of soil variability within a field is fundamental to the development
    of site-specific management areas since different soils have different water holding
    capacities. The ability to vary water application along the main lateral of the
    linear move based on position in the field allows researchers as well as producers
    to address specific soil, crop, and/or special research conditions/treatments.
    By aligning irrigation water applications with variable water requirements in
    the field, total water use may be reduced, decreasing deep percolation and surface
    run off. Reducing excess water applications will decrease the potential to move
    nutrients past the plant root zone and fungal disease pressure should also decrease.
    Cropping systems that more efficiently utilize soil water have been shown to reduce
    costs and energy use as well as reduce water quality concerns. There is still
    a need to develop more efficient methods of site-specifically applying crop amendments
    (e.g., nutrients, pesticides) through self-propelled sprinkler irrigation systems
    to reduce total amounts applied, improve profit margins and reduce adverse environmental
    impacts. References Bordovsky JP, Lascano RJ (2003) Variable rate irrigation using

  analysis: 'The paper primarily focuses on the application of IoT technology in agriculture,
    particularly in the context of Vietnam. It highlights the potential benefits of
    IoT in enhancing agricultural productivity and efficiency, such as through precision
    farming, smart greenhouses, and the use of drones for crop monitoring and spraying.


    While the paper does mention the importance of data volume, frequency, format,
    and source for IoT applications in agriculture, it does not delve deeply into
    the specific considerations or challenges related to these aspects.


    Overall, the paper provides a broad overview of IoT applications in agriculture
    but does not offer a detailed analysis or specific insights pertaining to the
    outline point on data considerations in the context of the systematic review.'

    \ manage it through computers. Tagging can \nbe done through many technologies,\
    \ such as RFID, NFC, barcode, QR code, dig-\nital watermark. Put simply, IoT is\
    \ all connected devices and the connection can \nbe made via Wi-Fi, broadband\
    \ telecommunications networks (3G, 4G, 5G), Blu-\netooth, ZigBee, infrared, etc.\
    \ With more than 7 billion connected IoT devices \ntoday, experts expect this\
    \ number to grow to 22 billion by 2025. \nIn the past ten years, the world has\
    \ made many advances in technology such \nas manufacturing sensors, Internet protocols\
    \ to connect many devices, wireless \ndata transmission technology and data processing\
    \ and analysis technology, etc. \nThese advancements give us many opportunities\

    \ for new resources, and \nIoT allows us to exploit available resources, that\
    \ is, information resources, to \ncreate a competitive advantage. IoT is considered\
    \ a potential technology trend \nthat can bring significant benefits. IoT has\
    \ several characteristics that can be \nseen as follows (Gillis, 2021; What Is\
    \ the Internet of Things? Configuring IoT \nTechnology and Applications in Implementation,\
    \ 2021, April 28): \n- Intelligence: In recent times, the combination of IoT with\
    \ autonomous con-\ntrol creates a network of intelligent entities capable of acting\
    \ individually de-\npending on specific situations. At the same time, they can\
    \ exchange information \nwith each other. The inclusion of AI technology in data\
    \ processing analysis will \nmake IoT systems more and more intelligent; \n- Complex\
    \ systems: In an open world, IoT will be complex because it in-\ncludes a large\
    \ number of links between devices, machines, and services and the \nability to\
    \ scale with new elements; \n- Size: An IoT network can contain up to 50 to 100\
    \ trillion connected objects, \nand the network can track the movement of each\
    \ object; \n- Data: The collected IoT data is extensive; besides important data\
    \ informa-\ntion, there is also data about time, place, space, etc. Therefore,\
    \ it is necessary to \nconsider what types of data to collect and how often to\
    \ sample data as well as \ncollecting event-based data to optimize network resources;\
    \ \n- Enormous potential: Currently, IoT has reached a stage, and the cost of\
    \ \ndeployment is getting cheaper. Many ARM embedded devices can collect and \n\
    transmit data on the network but cost less than 40 USD per product. Currently,\
    \ \nwe can see 32-bit ARM-based microcontrollers for less than 1 USD. With this\
    \ \nmicrocontroller, it is possible to do many things on it, such as collecting\
    \ and \ntransmitting data much cheaper: only about 50 cents for a 32-bit ARM micro-\n\
    controller. In the next 5 years, products will become more abundant and afford-\n\
    able. Ongoing challenges are data management and migration to IPv6 (IPv6 is \n\

    \ of Social Sciences \n \nnow available and running with allocated addresses).\
    \ With IPv6, we will have an \nabundance of addresses, and this will open up the\
    \ possibility of assigning ad-\ndresses to each device (gadget) and chip. Solutions\
    \ will be easier and more \nstraightforward, clearer, recoverable to individual\
    \ address entries, and the scope \nfor growth is immense; \nIn Vietnam, according\
    \ to the policy of integration into the international \neconomy of the Party and\
    \ the State, the Vietnamese IT industry cannot stand \naside from this trend.\
    \ In the coming time, at the state level, the exploitation of \ndata as a resource\
    \ for forecasting and management will be promoted more \nstrongly. On the part\
    \ of information technology, businesses need to take advan-\ntage of this opportunity\
    \ to launch a new application layer that allows exploiting \nthe business’s hidden\
    \ potential through the analysis of relevant data. IoT has the \npotential to\
    \ be applied in a variety of fields that are of interest to society, such as \n\
    transportation, health care, agriculture, education, etc., to help lower costs\
    \ and \nimprove service quality. In particular, agriculture is one of the fields\
    \ attached to \nthe country for thousands of years, but its potential has not\
    \ been effectively ex-\nploited. \n2. IoT Application in High-Tech Agricultural\
    \ Development \nA report by the McKinsey global economic research institute (USA)\
    \ estimates \nthat by 2025, the Internet of Things could bring in more than 11\
    \ trillion USD \nper year. The report summarizes that the potential of IoT is\
    \ being underesti-\nmated because IoT is not only present in all areas of life,\
    \ but it also creates many \nnew concepts and areas in Life and Business. \nThe\
    \ world population will reach 9.8 billion people by 2050. Therefore, to serve\
    \ \nthis population well, agriculture must accept IoT. To combat challenges such\
    \ as \nextreme weather conditions, increased climate change, and the impact on\
    \ the \nenvironment caused by intensive farming practices, more food needs to\
    \ be met. \nApplications of IoT-based smart agriculture target large-scale livestock\
    \ opera-\ntions and provide new levers to enhance other development trends in\
    \ agriculture \nsuch as organic farming, family livestock, and intensification\
    \ of agriculture \n(Ayaz, Ammad-Uddin, Sharif, Mansour, & Aggoune, 2019). \n2.1.\
    \ The Concept of IoT Application in High-Tech Agriculture \nHigh-tech agriculture\
    \ is a system that relies heavily on investment capital and \nhigh-tech techniques\
    \ to grow crops. In high-tech (smart) agriculture, we have \nsuccessfully applied\
    \ IoT to create a system built to monitor crop fields. The \npurpose of most agricultural\
    \ IoT models is to allow businesses and farmers to \npre-plan operations around\
    \ planting, watering, harvesting, etc. Specifically, the \napplication of IoT\
    \ in agriculture will be (What Is the Internet of Things? Confi-\nguring IoT Technology\
    \ and Applications in Implementation, 2021, April 28): \n- Applying science and\
    \ technology to the whole process in agriculture (the \nclosed process): Particularly,\
    \ applying information technology, electronics, and \nD. M. Quan, T. T. H. Van\

    \ \n \ntelecommunications to processes from seed preparation, soil, etc. -> cultivation\
    \ \n– breeding -> harvesting -> processing -> preservation -> distribution ->\
    \ to the \ntable; \n- Apply new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI)\
    \ to process the \ncollected big data. Collected data must form a large-scale\
    \ database to automate \nthe whole process gradually (i.e., eliminate progressively\
    \ human “experience” \nproactively recognizing problems and proposing solutions);\
    \ \n- Application of new and modern equipment such as drones in planting, \nhealth\
    \ monitoring, crop care, pesticide spraying, irrigation, etc.; \n- Greenhouses:\
    \ Greenhouses are now commonly used in our country, espe-\ncially in Da Lat—where\
    \ has the advantage of climate and weather. Greenhouses \nwere initially born\
    \ to help isolate plants from outside weather conditions. Grad-\nually, additional\
    \ climate control systems inside greenhouses (temperature, hu-\nmidity, light,\
    \ etc.) and irrigation control systems were added. Greenhouses con-\ntain two\
    \ central systems as follows: \n+ Irrigation control systems: The system includes\
    \ devices: A drip irrigation \nhead or a mist/rain sprinkler, a fertilizer injector,\
    \ an irrigation controller, etc. \nThe systems help to water/fertilize in an economical,\
    \ efficient, and high-yield \nway, helping farmers reduce production costs; \n\
    + Microclimate control systems: The system includes sensors to detect tem-\nperature\
    \ and humidity inside and outside the greenhouses, the ventilation fan \nsystem\
    \ for the air convection, the lighting system to be able to increase the light\
    \ \nwhen needed; the weather station measures the following parameters: solar\
    \ radi-\nation intensity, rain warning, wind speed, rain volume, etc. The goal\
    \ is to help \nthe greenhouses stay in the desired conditions. \nAll these applications\
    \ of IoT technology in agriculture contribute to reducing \nlabour costs, input\
    \ costs through the rational use of fertilizers, water sources, etc. \nand improving\
    \ the quality of the plants; bringing the country’s agriculture to a \nnew height,\
    \ gaining a position in the international agricultural product market. \n2.2.\
    \ Benefits of IoT Application in Agriculture \nIoT applications in agriculture\
    \ play a vital role in the current technology era. We \nneed more support to promote\
    \ IoT technology adoption in agriculture and bring \nabout greater efficiency.\
    \ The above is considered a successful step for many ma-\njor agricultural brands\
    \ with benefits such as: \n- Agricultural coverage: Combining many types of farming\
    \ including green-\nhouse growing methods, hydroponics, some farm models can be\
    \ located in ci-\nties; \n- Resources reduction: Optimizing the use of resources\
    \ such as water, land, \nenergy, etc. This resource-saving is significant, and\
    \ productivity is improved; \n- Clean processes: Applying IoT to the production\
    \ process helps to minimize \nthe use of pesticides, chemical fertilizers, etc.\
    \ Therefore, agricultural products \nwill ensure better quality and can be exported\
    \ to many more countries; \nD. M. Quan, T. T. H. Van \n \n \nDOI: 10.4236/jss.2022.101015\
    \ \n174 \nOpen Journal of Social Sciences \n \n- Fast: With the support from the\
    \ IoT system, the living and growing envi-\nronment of the plants are at ideal\
    \ levels. Plants are monitored and cared for right \nfrom the time of sowing to\
    \ harvesting, helping the plants to grow very quickly \nand soon to harvest; \n\
    - Improving the quality of agricultural products: With the 24/7 continuous \n\
    operation of the IoT system in particular and smart agriculture in general, agri-\n\
    cultural products will be developed in quality (and quantity), thereby increasing\
    \ \nthe value of products; \n- Risk control: Estimating production in advance\
    \ when businesses, farmers \nplan product distribution and accurately predict\
    \ how many crops you will harv-\nest; as a result, ensuring to have products that\
    \ will make sales more convenient. \nThe application of IoT in high-tech agriculture\
    \ in Vietnam will create great \nopportunities for farmers to become businesses\
    \ with outstanding productivity \nand value and an increasingly better quality\
    \ of life. Thereby helping farmers save \nresources, operating costs, improve\
    \ production, crop quality, labor optimization, \nmanagement time, etc. Currently,\
    \ IoT applications are widely applied by farmers \nto reduce labour and accelerate\
    \ the development of crops, helping farmers in-\ncrease their income. \nAgricultural\
    \ IoT applications are helping farmers collect meaningful data. \nSmall landowners\
    \ and farmers must understand the potential of the IoT market \nfor agriculture\
    \ by installing innovative technologies to increase the competitive-\nness and\
    \ sustainability of their production. Increasing population demand can \nbe achieved\
    \ if ranchers and smallholder farmers implement IoT agricultural so-\nlutions\
    \ successfully. \n3. Advantages, Disadvantages, and Directions of IoT  \nApplications\
    \ for Agriculture in Vietnam \n3.1. Advantages and Disadvantages \nVietnam is\
    \ a country with a long history of agriculture through which farmers \nhave gained\
    \ a lot of experience in farming and animal husbandry. Farmers have \nbeen used\
    \ to farming for generations; since then, they are willing to stick with \nthe\
    \ land where they were born and pursue this work for the rest of their lives.\
    \ In \nrecent years, the policies of the Communist Party and the Vietnamese State\
    \ on \nland accumulation have facilitated the implementation of IoT application\
    \ for \nagriculture more favorable. \nVietnam has many advantages when it comes\
    \ to emerging as a dynamic \ncountry, with many tech startups and this community\
    \ being supported by the \nGovernment. Technological human resources in Vietnam\
    \ are huge, young, intel-\nligent, passionate, and hard-working to learn new things.\
    \  \nBesides the advantages, Vietnam also faces difficulties and challenges to\
    \ pro-\nmote IoT development: \n- Firstly, we lack businesses that provide technologies,\
    \ solutions, and data \nanalysis and processing services. To have strong companies\
    \ in data analysis and \nD. M. Quan, T. T. H. Van \n \n \nDOI: 10.4236/jss.2022.101015\
    \ \n175 \nOpen Journal of Social Sciences \n \ncreate competitive advantages,\
    \ Vietnam needs to have policies to attract talent, \ndevelop appropriate training\
    \ and research programs in this field; \n- Secondly, there is a gap between the\
    \ research sectors and enterprises, which \nleads to the low application of research\
    \ results into practice; \n- Thirdly, the issue of funding, when applying new\
    \ technology, the first diffi-\nculty often mentioned is the issue of the financing.\
    \ The actual cost is not high, \nbut the price is mainly on the design stage.\
    \ Therefore, farmers can connect to \ntheir farms through smartphones. And since\
    \ then, farmers have been communi-\ncating with the farm through intelligent devices,\
    \ unfamiliar with changing tradi-\ntional farming methods; \n- Fourthly, the issue\
    \ of farmers’ awareness: The main factor in Vietnamese \nagriculture is farmers\
    \ and cooperatives, but the reality shows that they are still \nconfused with\
    \ the application of technology in agriculture. Therefore, it is ne-\ncessary\
    \ to have a companion, buy agricultural products, apply flexible processes \n\
    and technologies to make agricultural products effective, valuable, and of high\
    \ \nquality; \n- Fifthly, there is a lack of ideas when applying IoT in agriculture\
    \ in Vietnam; \ncurrently, mainly uses sensors, programming for irrigation, automatic\
    \ indoor \nhydroponics and is only applied to large-scale enterprises. \nVietnam’s\
    \ agriculture has many advantages, but mainly small-scale produc-\ntion based\
    \ on household economy, labour productivity is still low. Therefore, the \napplication\
    \ of IoT in agriculture will create significant opportunities for farmers \nto\
    \ become businesses with outstanding productivity and value that bring a better\
    \ \nquality of life. \n3.2. Some Directions for IoT Application in Agricultural\
    \  \nDevelopment in Vietnam \nOne of that premises is resolution No. 36-NQ/TW\
    \ of the Politburo (XI term) on \npromoting IT application and development to\
    \ meet the requirements of sus-\ntainable development and international integration,\
    \ issued on 1st July 2014. The \nresolution mentioned building industry and IT\
    \ services ecosystem to meet ex-\nport and domestic markets, supporting the development\
    \ of Vietnamese brand \ntechnology products and services with high intellectual\
    \ content, investing in \nsoftware products research, etc. \nIt is necessary to\
    \ propagate to businesses and cooperatives that understand the \nimportance and\
    \ trends of IoT application in agriculture in the long run. Pro-\nmote the trend\
    \ of IoT and innovation (DDI) for businesses to develop in this di-\nrection.\
    \ The development of the IoT ecosystem is necessary to create a commu-\nnity of\
    \ companies to participate, promote creativity and competition. IoT appli-\ncations\
    \ can only be effectively deployed if the right infrastructure is in place. The\
    \ \nIoT infrastructure has many layers: the transport layer, the underlying IT\
    \ service \nlayer, the data providers and data analytics service providers, and\
    \ finally, the \ncommunity of businesses that develop data mining tools to service\
    \ agencies, or-\nD. M. Quan, T. T. H. Van \n \n \nDOI: 10.4236/jss.2022.101015\
    \ \n176 \nOpen Journal of Social Sciences \n \nganizations, and companies. \n\
    In this model, the State plays the role of providing supportive policies and de-\n\
    veloping primary infrastructure layers. The State makes appropriate policies to\
    \ \nencourage businesses and agricultural households to apply IoT technology in\
    \ \nagriculture. It is expected that the State will support the infrastructure\
    \ and initial \npromotion. In addition, there should also be solutions for new\
    \ ideas to be kept \nto express; demonstrate novelty, creativity, and feasibility.\
    \ Another important \nissue is that it is necessary to have a mechanism to ensure\
    \ the rights of inventors \nin the future, especially a strict management mechanism\
    \ for intellectual property. \nOn the side of businesses, farmers with dynamism\
    \ will play an active role in \npromoting IoT development. Moreover, startups\
    \ and innovative companies \nmust prove that their ideas are good, realistic,\
    \ technologically advanced, and \nhighly feasible to receive support from the\
    \ community according to the market \neconomy model. IoT allows us to collect\
    \ a lot of data, but this will become mea-\nningless if we cannot exploit the\
    \ data to make decisions that serve a specific \npurpose. Therefore, we need new\
    \ technology to analyze and process data ac-\ncording to creating innovation based\
    \ on data potential (Data-Driven Innovation \nor DDI). Thus, in the coming time\
    \ and focusing on hardware and software in-\nformation technology services, it\
    \ is necessary to invest in data analysis technol-\nogy, turning data into a resource\
    \ to create a competitive advantage. \nIn recent times, policies to support IoT\
    \ applications in agriculture have been \nincreasingly encouraged and developed\
    \ by agencies and ministries, including the \nMinistry of Information and Communications,\
    \ which has enabled businesses to \npropose IoT initiatives proactively and discuss\
    \ with functional units of the Min-\nistry to be able to come up with specific\
    \ and reasonable policies. The connection \nbetween government agencies, businesses,\
    \ and scientific research is an essential \nfactor in promoting the development\
    \ of information technology. The application \nof IoT in agriculture is more and\
    \ more widespread. \n4. Potential IoT Applications Applied to Agriculture in \
    \ \nVietnam \n4.1. Using IoT for Precision Farming \nPrecision farming is a process\
    \ that makes the farming process more controlled \nand precise for raising livestock\
    \ and growing crops. The key components are the \nuse of IT and feature such as\
    \ sensors, autonomous vehicles, autonomous hard-\nware, control systems, robots,\
    \ etc., in this approach (Figure 1). \nPrecision agriculture in recent years has\
    \ become one of the most well-known \napplications of IoT in the agricultural\
    \ sector, and a lot of organizations have \nstarted using this technique around\
    \ the world. \nThe products and services provided by the IoT system include soil\
    \ moisture \nsensors, VRI optimization (Variable Rate Irrigation), PRO virtual\
    \ optimizer, etc. \nVRI optimization is a process of maximizing profits in crop\
    \ fields irrigated with \nsoil change, thus improving yield and increasing water\
    \ use efficiency. \nD. M. Quan, T. T. H. Van \n \n \nDOI: 10.4236/jss.2022.101015\
    \ \n177 \nOpen Journal of Social Sciences \n \n \nFigure 1. The precision agriculture\
    \ model (Image: Internet). \n \nVariable Rate Technology (VRT)—VRT refers to technologies\
    \ that allow in-\nput changes and help farmers control the number of inputs in\
    \ a particular area. \nThe essential components of this technology include a computer,\
    \ software, a \ncontroller, and a differential global positioning system (DGPS).\
    \ There are three \nbasic approaches to using VRT—map-based, sensor-based, and\
    \ manual-based \n(The Future of Manufacturing Is Digital—Predictive Maintenance,\
    \ 2021, De-\ncember 9). \nGPS Soil Sampling—Check the soil properties of an area\
    \ to determine availa-\nble nutrients, pH, and many other types of data necessary\
    \ for making informed \ndecisions and profitability. In essence, soil sampling\
    \ allows farmers to look at \nyield differences in a field and develop a plan\
    \ to consider these differences. Sam-\npling and analysis services are essential,\
    \ allowing data to be used for input with \nvariable factors to optimize seeding\
    \ and fertilization. \nComputer applications—Computer applications can be used\
    \ to create farm \nplans, farming area maps, and yield maps. This allows for more\
    \ precise use of \ninputs such as pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers, reducing\
    \ costs, giving high \nyields, and being environmentally friendly. The challenge\
    \ with these software \nsystems is that they sometimes provide only modest value,\
    \ not allowing the data \nto be used to make large-scale agricultural decisions.\
    \ Another concern with \nmany software applications is their poor user interface\
    \ and inability to integrate \nthe information they provide with other data sources\
    \ to give farmers more valu-\nable information. \nIt uses remote sensing technology\
    \ to monitor and manage land, water, and \nother resources. It can help identify\
    \ everything from factors that can strongly af-\nfect a crop at a particular point\
    \ to estimate soil moisture. This data supports de-\ncision-making on the farm\
    \ and can come from various sources, including air-\ncraft and satellites. \n\
    D. M. Quan, T. T. H. Van \n \n \nDOI: 10.4236/jss.2022.101015 \n178 \nOpen Journal\
    \ of Social Sciences \n \nThe primary goal of precision agriculture and precision\
    \ agronomy is to ensure \nprofitability, efficiency, and sustainability while\
    \ protecting the environment. \nThis is achieved by using the big data gathered\
    \ from this technology to help \nmake immediate or future decisions on everything\
    \ from different rates for dif-\nferent areas until the best results are achieved:\
    \ chemicals, fertilizers, or seeds. \nToday, with the strong development of technology,\
    \ artificial intelligence in \ndata analysis will effectively support farmers\
    \ in making decisions. Farmers now \nhave access to a lot of data. There’s so\
    \ much data they don’t know what to do \nwith it. AI is capable of analyzing large\
    \ amounts of data in a short time and us-\ning it to recommend the best course\
    \ of action. This information can then be \nused to predict the best time to plant,\
    \ predict pest and disease outbreaks before \nthey happen, and make yield predictions\
    \ before harvest. While AI will never be \nable to replace the kinds of complex\
    \ decisions farmers have to make regularly, it \ncan be used to make those decisions\
    \ easier. \nVietnam is a country with long-standing agriculture but farming in\
    \ individual \nhouseholds. In recent years, the State has had policies on land\
    \ accumulation; \nthere have been large cooperatives and companies engaged in\
    \ high-tech agricul-\nture such as Hoa Phat, Hoang Anh Gia Lai, Vinamilk, and\
    \ TH group, etc. With \ntraditional farming, the efficiency decreases due to climate\
    \ change, bad soil, and \nmany diseases. Since then, the above-listed IoT technologies\
    \ have been applied \nmore and more and have proven their effectiveness. \n4.2.\
    \ Smart Greenhouses (DroneLife, 2020) \nGreenhouse farming is a technique to improve\
    \ the yield of crops, vegetables, tu-\nbers, and fruits (Figure 2). Greenhouses\
    \ control environmental parameters in \ntwo ways: through manual intervention\
    \ or a rate control mechanism. However, \nbecause manual intervention methods\
    \ have disadvantages such as production \ncosts, energy consumption, and labour\
    \ costs, these methods are less effective. An \nintelligent greenhouse through\
    \ IoT embedded systems intelligently monitors \nand controls the climate eliminating\
    \ all need for human intervention. \nVarious sensors that measure the environmental\
    \ parameters required by the \nplant are used to control the environment in the\
    \ innovative greenhouse. A cloud \nserver is then created for remote access to\
    \ the system when it connects using \nIoT. Inside the greenhouse, a cloud server\
    \ helps process data and apply control \nactions. This design provides optimal\
    \ and cost-effective solutions for farmers \nwith minimal manual intervention.\
    \ \nAn example of this is Illumin Greenhouses, an Agriculture Technology green-\n\
    house organization that uses technology and IoT to provide services. It builds\
    \ \nmodern and affordable greenhouses using solar-powered IoT sensors. Green-\n\
    house status and water consumption can be monitored with these sensors by \nsending\
    \ SMS alerts to farmers using an online portal. \nSensors in the IoT system in\
    \ the greenhouse provide information about tem-\nperature, pressure, humidity,\
    \ and light levels. \nD. M. Quan, T. T. H. Van \n \n \nDOI: 10.4236/jss.2022.101015\
    \ \n179 \nOpen Journal of Social Sciences \n \n \nFigure 2. Greenhouse covered\
    \ with glass material (Image: internet). \n \nCovering material is one of the\
    \ essential components that cannot be missed \nwhen constructing and installing\
    \ agricultural greenhouses, whether you are just \nmaking a small home rooftop\
    \ model or a large-scale production model. Cur-\nrently, we can use many different\
    \ types of covering materials: plastic film, poly-\ncarbonate, glass or fiberglass.\
    \ The choice of material depends on the investment \nbudget, climate zone, and\
    \ what kind of crops you plan to grow in the green-\nhouse. Each material has\
    \ different advantages and disadvantages. \n- Greenhouses covered with plastic\
    \ film: Plastic film is usually produced \nfrom PE plastic (polyethylene), which\
    \ is considered the most commonly used \nmaterial globally because of its relatively\
    \ low investment cost. Another advan-\ntage of this material is its high light\
    \ diffusion ability, allowing more sunlight to \npass through, helping to promote\
    \ photosynthesis and increase crop yields. This \nmaterial also casts less shade\
    \ because of the limited use of reinforcing materials \n(Agricultural Weight IoT\
    \ Application—4 Best Benefits of Agriculture IoT White \nIoT, 2020, November 30).\
    \ The disadvantage is that the life cycle is short, usually \nabout 4 to 5 years.\
    \ \n- Greenhouses covered with Polycarbonate: Polycarbonate is the newest \ngreenhouse\
    \ material on the market with the characteristic of flat, 2 layers or a \ncorrugated\
    \ layer. It is a stronger material than nylon, the 2-layer type has quite \ngood\
    \ insulation properties, suitable for temperature-sensitive crops. Polycarbo-\n\
    nate has high durability, can withstand adverse weather conditions such as hail\
    \ \nbetter than glass materials. And this material is not affected by UV, air\
    \ pollution \nor agricultural chemicals like PE plastic film can be used for up\
    \ to 10 years \nwithout needing to be replaced. The disadvantage is that the cost\
    \ for this type is \noften higher than glass or polyethylene, and over time this\
    \ type of greenhouse \ncan turn yellow or grow moss affecting the illumination\
    \ of the plants. \n- Greenhouses covered with glass materials: Glass is the most\
    \ ideal material \nfor covering greenhouses due to its significantly better light\
    \ transmission prop-\nD. M. Quan, T. T. H. Van \n \n \nDOI: 10.4236/jss.2022.101015\
    \ \n180 \nOpen Journal of Social Sciences \n \nerties than other materials. Glass\
    \ is also highly durable, fire resistant and unaf-\nfected by air pollution, UV\
    \ rays or agrochemicals. The disadvantage of green-\nhouses is the high cost of\
    \ construction and materials and often broken due to \nsubstantial impacts such\
    \ as hail, complex objects falling. \n- Greenhouses covered with glass fibres:\
    \ glass fibres are also another ma-\nterial frequently used to build agricultural\
    \ greenhouses. This material is cheaper \nthan glass and polycarbonate, and often\
    \ more expensive than polyethylene. \nThanks to its hard nature, this material\
    \ does not need a strong supporting \nstructure like glass, which helps to reduce\
    \ construction costs significantly. The \ndisadvantage of using glass fibre is\
    \ that this material is easily damaged by sun-\nlight, reducing light transmission;\
    \ the material is also flammable and has a short \nlife cycle of about five years.\
    \ \n4.3. Application of Drones in Agriculture \nAgricultural drones are an excellent\
    \ example of IoT applications in agriculture \n(Figure 3). The application of\
    \ drones in agriculture is increasingly popular \nthanks to its relatively low\
    \ cost and ease of application. Today, precision agri-\nculture allows farmers\
    \ to use drones to measure and observe the variety of crops. \nSowing seeds, automated\
    \ crop care, and close monitoring of crop health also \nhelp increase yield and\
    \ profitability (DroneLife, 2020). \nThe benefits of using drones include ease\
    \ of use, time savings, crop health \nimaging, integrated GIS mapping, and increased\
    \ productivity. Drone technology \nwill bring high-tech change to the agriculture\
    \ industry using strategy and plan-\nning based on real-time data collection and\
    \ processing. \nFarmers using drones can enter details of the fields they want\
    \ to survey. Select \nelevation or ground resolution to get data on the areas.\
    \ From the data collected \nby the drones, it is possible to derive valuable and\
    \ detailed information about \nvarious factors such as plant counting, yield prediction,\
    \ plant health index, \nheight trees measurement, coverage mapping, nitrogen content\
    \ in wheat, drai-\nnage mapping, etc. The areas where drones are used are detailed\

    \ of this method \nare assessed to bring absorption rates up to 75% and cost reductions\
    \ up to 85%. \nThanks to the types of sensors on drones such as heat, spectrum,\
    \ etc., helping \nfarmers quickly identify crops that lack water. Moreover, thanks\
    \ to other tech-\nnology, it can calculate the density and health of plants provide\
    \ heat charts, alert \nfarmers when crops need more or less water. This efficient\
    \ water use is a huge \ncost-saving measure as water costs rise and drought hits\
    \ many areas. Careful ir-\nrigation also reduces other risks such as fertilizers\
    \ flowing into rivers and \nstreams, preventing affecting plant life, etc. \n\
    - Monitoring and assessing crop health: Frequent weather conditions com-\nbined\
    \ with large cultivated areas make it difficult to monitor crops. Using satel-\n\
    lite images gives us low quality and limited use. Today, drones can provide \n\
    low-cost time-series videos, helping us realize production inefficiencies and\
    \ the \nreal-time growth of crops. Using multi-spectral images captured from the\
    \ drone \nsystem, it is possible to monitor the changes of crops and make specific\
    \ recom-\nmendations. This allows farmers to take timely handling measures, especially\
    \ to \nwarn of disease abnormalities that may affect crop yields, etc. \n- Soil\
    \ analysis and weed removal: Thanks to drones, it is possible to build 3D \nmaps\
    \ to help farmers analyze the soil. Once the seeding model is complete, the \n\
    drones can monitor soil quality and provide data on nitrogen levels and irriga-\n\
    tion requirements. Thanks to intelligent AI cameras that can detect weeds to \n\
    adjust the appropriate amount of spray, the effect will be better, and the cost\
    \ of \nuse will be reduced. \n- Spraying: Using drones to spray drugs is increasingly\
    \ popular thanks to its \nsuperior effects on safety, fast and evenly spreading\
    \ impact. A new study shows \nthat drones spray pesticides five times faster than\
    \ traditional methods. Thanks to \nlaser distance measurement technology that\
    \ helps them adjust their altitude on \nall terrains, prevent accidents while\
    \ spraying, etc. Most pesticides are harmful to \nhuman and animal health, leaving\
    \ a severe, even irreversible impact on the en-\nvironment, eventually causing\
    \ significant pollution to the entire ecosystem. \nTherefore, the use of drones\
    \ helps significantly reduce the number of pesticides, \nthereby reducing the\
    \ impact on the environment. \n5. Conclusion \nThe article presents the concept,\
    \ characteristics, need, and trends of IoT applica-\ntions for high-tech agriculture\
    \ today. We offer the remaining problems and dif-\nficulties for IoT applications\
    \ in agriculture in Vietnam and suggest solutions to \npromote the development\
    \ of IoT applications to be more popular and effective. \nThe research has also\
    \ presented several specific and practical IoT applications \nin agriculture in\
    \ the current period, thereby helping managers better orient \nagricultural enterprises\
    \ and cooperatives to use more effectively and complete \nthe proposed solutions.\

  analysis: The paper present a cost-benefit analysis method for the research and
    development, application, and protection of plant variety rights. The authors
    demonstrate how domestic research on the value evaluation of agricultural, scientific,
    and technological achievements, especially the value evaluation method of new
    plant variety rights, is still very much lacking. Most of them are limited to
    traditional value evaluation methods, which makes the reference significance and
    accuracy of the evaluation results very low, and it is impossible to evaluate
    the value of new plant variety rights scientifically, reasonably, and pertinently.

    \ variety rights that enterprises are concerned about, and introduces the cost-beneft\
    \ analysis method into the research and\ndevelopment, application, and protection\
    \ of plant variety rights. Tis research takes the new plant variety rights as\
    \ the research\nobject, clarifes the development status of the world plant variety\
    \ rights from the perspective of time series development\ncharacteristics and\
    \ spatial distribution pattern, explores the location of the variety rights in\

    \ to carry out in-depth research on the application and authorization of plant\
    \ variety\nrights, the scope of protection catalogues, the structure of variety\
    \ rights, and the applicant unit. Finally, the regression model is\ntested from\
    \ fve aspects: regression model signifcance test, model goodness-of-ft test, Hosmer\
    \ goodness-of-ft test, goodness-of-\nft test, and overall accuracy test of model\

    \ it provides new ideas for the risk analysis and prevention of seed industry\
    \ enterprises’ variety rights\ncapitalization operation.\n1. Introduction\nIn\
    \ the licensing of variety rights, the licensee of variety rights\nis highly dependent\
    \ on the related varieties, and once\nmonopoly occurs, the harm will be huge.\
    \ In the process of\nvariety rights licensing, the exclusiveness and monopoly\
    \ of\nthe variety rights make it possible for the variety rights\nholders to take\
    \ advantage of this exclusive and monopolistic\nposition to implement behaviors\
    \ that restrict competition.\nAt the international level, with the opening of\
    \ China’s seed\nmarket, foreign large-scale agricultural technology compa-\nnies\
    \ with abundant capital and advanced technology have\nexpanded aggressively, threatening\
    \ the living space of the\ndomestic breeding industry, and challenging the develop-\n\
    ment of China’s seed industry and food security.\nAs a major agricultural country,\
    \ agricultural, scientifc,\nand technological achievements are produced in batches\n\
    every year, and the task of promoting the smooth\ntransformation of these achievements\
    \ is very important.\nDoing a good job in the evaluation of the value of agri-\n\
    cultural, scientifc, and technological achievements has an\nimportant role and\
    \ signifcance in improving the efciency\nof achievement transformation and accelerating\
    \ the appli-\ncation of achievement transformation.\nTis paper mainly starts with\
    \ the cost-beneft issue of\nplant variety rights that enterprises are concerned\
    \ about, and\nintroduces the cost-beneft analysis method into the research\nand\
    \ development, application, and protection of plant va-\nriety rights. Based on\
    \ the above research, it is found that the\ndomestic research on the value evaluation\
    \ of agricultural,\nscientifc, and technological achievements, especially the\n\
    value evaluation method of new plant variety rights, is still\nvery much lacking.\
    \ Most of them are limited to traditional\nvalue evaluation methods, which makes\
    \ the reference sig-\nnifcance and accuracy of the evaluation results very low,\

    rights scientiﬁcally, reasonably, and pertinently. For the\ncurrent scientiﬁc\
    \ and technological achievements transfor-\nmation trading market, the reference\
    \ transaction value is of\ngreat signiﬁcance for promoting the successful transaction\
    \ of\nachievements. Terefore, it is indispensable to study the\nmethod of evaluating\
    \ the value of new plant variety rights.\n2. Related Work\nTe implementation of\
    \ the new plant variety protection\nsystem has created a suitable legal environment\
    \ for the\nhealthy development of seed enterprises and scientiﬁc re-\nsearch units,\
    \ promoted the breeding and innovation of new\nplant varieties, and found a breakthrough\
    \ for the seed in-\ndustry to face the world and improve its core competi-\ntiveness.\
    \ Te concept of an Essential Derivative Variety\n(EDV) under the 1991 UPOV Convention\
    \ presents a\nnumber of challenges for both UPOV and users of the\nsystem. Bostyn\
    \ believes that the concept of EDV is not only\nexpressed in a rather diﬃcult\
    \ language in regulations but has\nproven equally diﬃcult to apply. Furthermore,\
    \ due to the\nlack of clarity in the provisions of the UPOV 1991 Con-\nvention,\
    \ reaching a consensus on the exact interpretation of\nthe concept, to be implemented\
    \ later by courts and guide-\nlines, is equally challenging. He has made novel\
    \ and original\ncontributions to research in the ﬁeld of EDV. Te approach\npresented\
    \ here is inspired by other areas of (intellectual\nproperty) law. His careful\
    \ study of the proposed solutions\nshows that at least some of them can eﬀectively\
    \ end at least\nsome of the deadlock and legal uncertainty surrounding the\nconcept\
    \ of EDV [1]. Wijesundara et al. consider Plant\nPatents (PP) and Plant Breeders’\
    \ Rights (PBR) as two forms\nof Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) granted to\
    \ improved\nvarieties of crops. Authoritative national governments issue\nPPs\
    \ and PBRs after conﬁrming the uniqueness of the breed\nidentity. Uniqueness depends\
    \ on the uniqueness, consis-\ntency, and stability of the new variety. In the\
    \ presence of a\nlarge number of closely related breeds as a reference set,\n\
    morphological, physiological, and biochemical descriptors\nare less able to obtain\
    \ IPR in breed identiﬁcation, but ad-\nvanced molecular tools, such as DNA ﬁngerprinting\
    \ and\nsequencing, have a high potential to detect uniqueness. DNA\nﬁngerprinting\
    \ and sequencing have identiﬁed varietal traits\nin many crops, such as rice,\
    \ apple, wheat, and soybean,\nrevealing the potential for the successful use of\
    \ molecular\ndescriptors in patenting or PBR. Novelty veriﬁcation is the\nﬁrst\
    \ step in the process of allowing a patent or PBR. Te\nPatent or Plant Variety\
    \ Protection Oﬃce requires breeders\nto submit an application that includes all\
    \ the details of the\nplant variety [2]. Li et al. applied the 15 N labeling methods\n\
    to the leaves of Arabidopsis rosettes to characterize their\nprotein degradation\
    \ rates and understand their determi-\nnants. Stepwise labeling of new peptides\
    \ with 15 N and\nmeasuring the decrease in abundance over time of more than\n\
    60,000 existing peptides allowed him to determine the\ndegradation rates of 1228\
    \ proteins in vivo [3]. High-yielding\nSpanish bunch peanut culture ICGV 00351\
    \ (cross-derivative\nof ICGV 87290 × ICGV 87846) developed by Vindhiya-\nvarman\
    \ et al. at ICRISAT (International Crops Research\nInstitute for the Semi-Arid\
    \ Tropics), Patancheru, Andhra\nPradesh, with six other promising drought varieties\
    \ were\nevaluated together. Te overall average dry pod yield of\ncultivated ICGV\
    \ 00351 under rainfed conditions was\n2189 kg/ha. Tis cultivar with a duration\
    \ of 105 to 110 days\nincreased pod yield by 17% and 26%, respectively, over the\n\
    region’s popular varieties VRI (Gn) 6 and TMV (Gn) 13 [4].\nAs an important agricultural\
    \ intellectual property rights,\nplant variety rights operate and develop worldwide,\
    \ which\ncan enhance the international competitiveness of plant\nvariety rights\
    \ and the ability to participate in international\naﬀairs. Te securitization of\
    \ plant variety rights is insepa-\nrable from the development of ﬁnance, economy,\
    \ and so-\nciety, and is an important way to protect plant variety rights\nand\
    \ operate assets. Teir research on plant variety rights\nlacks practical practice,\
    \ and this study will further explore\nthis issue.\n3. MethodofEvaluationModelofCapitalization\n\
    Operation Value of Plant Variety Rights\nBased on Big Data\n3.1. Supply-Side Value\
    \ Range Evaluation Model. Te con-\nstruction of the value range evaluation model\
    \ for the supply\nside of new plant variety rights should start from the per-\n\
    spective of producers, and consider two aspects of R&D and\nincome: First, the\
    \ supplier of new plant variety rights should\nnot only maintain the simple reproduction\
    \ of the enter-\nprise’s products but also provide funds for the enterprise to\n\
    further expand its production scale. Terefore, the value of\nthe new plant variety\
    \ rights should not only compensate the\nconsumption of the cost of the supply\
    \ side but also distribute\nthe beneﬁts brought by the new plant variety rights,\
    \ so as to\nprovide eﬀective ﬁnancial support for the enterprise to\nfurther proceed\
    \ anyway. Secondly, various risks and in-\ntangible losses of new plant variety\
    \ rights should be con-\nsidered in the value of new plant variety rights. Tis\
    \ research\nis based on agricultural intellectual property rights, a hot\nissue\
    \ of general concern, and takes plant variety rights, a\nunique intellectual property\
    \ rights in the agricultural ﬁeld, as\nthe research object. Terefore, the main\
    \ research line of the\ncost-beneﬁt analysis of plant variety rights is shown\
    \ in\nFigure 1.\n3.1.1. Te Lower Limit of the Supply-Side Value Assessment\nRange.\

    \ plant variety rights in the study is:\nPs−min \x88 R + T + F ∗ i + O.\n(1)\n\
    In the formula, R is the research and development cost of\nnew plant variety rights.\n\
    3.1.2. Te Upper Limit of the Supply-Side Value Assessment\nRange. Te upper limit\
    \ of the price determined by the\nsupplier for the transfer of new plant variety\

    \ side, purchasing a new plant variety right is a\nproductive investment of the\
    \ enterprise. Te expected return\nfrom the investment to the demander after deducting\n\
    possible risks is greater than the average social capital return,\nor if the new\
    \ plant variety can be developed by itself, the\npurchase price must be lower\
    \ than the cost of self-devel-\nopment. Te evaluation scheme is shown in Figure\

    \ in the ﬁeld of artiﬁcial intelligence. On the basis of\nreviewing several classical\
    \ knowledge uncertainty mea-\nsurement methods, the relationship and diﬀerence\
    \ be-\ntween these measurement methods are systematically\nstudied. Te results\
    \ show that measures such as infor-\nmation granularity are equivalent to knowledge\
    \ granu-\nlarity, and collaborative entropy can be regarded as the\nderivation\
    \ of information entropy, which can verify the\ncorrectness of the conclusion.\n\
    In the ﬁrst case, if\nPs−min > Pd−max.\n(11)\nIn this case, the equilibrium transfer\
    \ price of new plant\nvariety rights cannot be formed [10].\nIn the second case,\
    \ if\nPs−max > Pd−max > Ps−min > Pd−min.\n(12)\nTe intersection interval is [Ps−max,\
    \ Pd−min], which is the\nlowest price interval for both the supply and demand\
    \ sides.\nTe third case, if [11]\nPd−max > Ps−max > Pd−min > Ps−min.\n(13)\nAt\
    \ this time, the intersection interval is [Pd−min, Ps−max],\nand the equilibrium\
    \ price of new plant variety rights may be\nformed.\nTe fourth case, if [12]\n\
    Pd−min > Ps−max.\n(14)\nAt this time, when the new plant variety rights are\n\
    transferred, it is very easy for both parties to trade and\nnegotiate.\nTe ﬁfth\
    \ case, if\nPd−max > Ps−max > Ps−min > Pd−min.\n(15)\nAt this time, the trading\
    \ price range is [Pd−max, Pd−min],\nwhich may form an equilibrium price acceptable\
    \ to both\nparties.\nTe sixth case, if [13]\nPs−max > Pd−max > Pd−min > Ps−min.\n\
    (16)\nTe intersection interval is [Pd−min, Pd−max]. When the\nnew plant variety\
    \ right is transferred, an equilibrium price\nmay be formed after negotiation\
    \ between the two parties.\nAfter using big data to analyze basic information\
    \ such as\nbusiness conditions, capital ﬂow, investor preferences, etc.,\nthe\
    \ credit data, plant variety rights information, and plant\nvariety rights future\

    \ can not only eﬀectively control the infrastructure of\nplant variety rights\
    \ securitization operations but also realize\nproﬁt output with the latest technology\
    \ [18]. Trough the\napplication of big data, cloud computing, and other tech-\n\
    nologies, plant variety rights securitization operations are\nunder the supervision\
    \ of laws, regulations, and policies, and\nthrough the smart contract mechanism,\
    \ network identiﬁ-\ncation and transmission technology is used to implement\n\
    eﬀective supervision in the form of encrypted codes [19].\nTerefore, the formulation\
    \ of relevant laws and regulations\nto standardize the application of regulatory\
    \ technology for\nplant variety rights securitization is also an issue that needs\n\
    to be focused on.\nTe income method does not take into account the many\nuncertainties\
    \ in the process of achievement development,\ninvestment, and commercialization;\

    4. Results of the Evaluation Model for the\nCapitalization of Plant Variety Rights\n\
    (1) From the perspective of the main factors of plant\nvariety right marketization,\
    \ the degree of educa-\ntion and the nature of the unit have diﬀerent\ndegrees\
    \ of inﬂuence on the satisfaction of plant\nvariety right marketization. Te regression\
    \ coef-\nﬁcient of education level is 0.489, and the statistical\ntest value is\
    \ signiﬁcant at the level of 5%\n(P \x88 0.040 < 0.05), indicating that education\
    \ level\nhas an obvious impact on the satisfaction of plant\nvariety right marketization.\
    \ Te more years of\neducation the plant variety rights holders have, the\nmore\
    \ they can calmly analyze, predict, and make\ndecisions on the plant variety rights\
    \ market. More\nimportantly, they can accurately evaluate the eﬀect\nof plant\
    \ variety rights marketization, and try to\nmake the actual eﬀect of plant variety\
    \ rights\nmarketization consistent with their prediction, so\nas to ensure that\
    \ the plant variety rights market-\nization can achieve high satisfaction. Te\
    \ regres-\nsion coeﬃcient of unit property is −0.383, and the\nstatistical test\
    \ value is signiﬁcant at the level of 5%\n(P \x88 0.032 < 0.05), indicating that\
    \ unit property is\nanother signiﬁcant factor aﬀecting the satisfaction\nof plant\
    \ variety right marketization. Te nature of\nthe diﬀerent units determines the\
    \ diﬀerent pri-\norities of the marketization of plant variety rights.\nSeed\n\
    companies\nmainly\nfocus\non\nthe\ncommercialization and marketization of plant\n\
    variety rights, while agricultural academies and\nuniversities often focus on\
    \ the research and de-\nvelopment and promotion of new plant varieties.\n(2) From\
    \ the perspective of the factors of market-\noriented transaction of plant variety\
    \ rights, plant\nvariety rights licensing and plant variety rights\ncooperation\
    \ have a signiﬁcant impact on the sat-\nisfaction of plant variety rights. Te\
    \ regression\ncoeﬃcient of plant variety right license is 1.055,\nand the statistical\
    \ test value (P \x88 0.010) is signif-\nicant at the level of 1%, indicating that\
    \ plant va-\nriety\nright\nlicense\nsigniﬁcantly\naﬀects\nthe\nsatisfaction of\
    \ plant variety right marketization,\nwhich beneﬁts from the advantages of plant\
    \ variety\nright license itself. Because the license of plant\nvariety right only\
    \ transfers the use right, the\nbiggest advantage of this transaction mode is\
    \ that\nthe owner of plant variety right can transfer the use\nright of plant\
    \ variety right to multiple people for\nmany times, which is conducive to the\
    \ owner of\nplant variety right to recover the funds quickly and\nexpand the market-oriented\
    \ scope of plant variety\nright, so as to improve the market-oriented sat-\nisfaction\
    \ of plant variety right. With the im-\nprovement of China’s property rights trading\n\
    market, plant variety rights licensing will be more\nand more applied to the market-oriented\
    \ practice\nof plant variety rights. Te regression coeﬃcient of\nplant variety\
    \ right cooperation is 1.908, and the\nstatistical test value is signiﬁcant at\
    \ the level of 5%\n(P \x88 0.022 < 0.05), indicating that plant variety\nright\
    \ cooperation has a signiﬁcant impact on the\nsatisfaction of plant variety right\
    \ marketization.\nTe reason is closely related to the structure of\nplant variety\
    \ rights holders in China. Most of\nChina’s variety rights holders are subordinate\
    \ to\nagricultural research institutes and colleges and\nuniversities. Plant variety\
    \ rights accounted for\n62.8% of the total authorization, and seed industry\n\
    enterprises only accounted for 33.1% of the total\nauthorization. In addition,\
    \ most of the seed in-\ndustry enterprises in my country are small in scale\n\
    and do not have the necessary conditions for self-\nimplementation. Tey need to\
    \ rely on the support\nof external resources such as capital, technology,\nand\
    \ information.\nAccording to the development report of China’s seed\nindustry\
    \ [25], in 2021, the top 10 seed industry companies in\nterms of sales invested\
    \ a total of 483.43 million yuan in\nbreeding research and development, an increase\
    \ of 48% over\nTable 2: Comprehensive tests of model coeﬃcients.\nComprehensive\

    \ of applications for\nvariety rights, the total number of grants, and the total\n\
    number of eﬀective variety rights at the end of the period in\nUPOV member countries.\n\
    Only 5.53% of the 4,808 variety rights authorized in 2018\nwere transferred, and\
    \ only 3% of the varieties authorized by\nteaching, scientiﬁc, and educational\
    \ units were imple-\nmented. Te authorized variety plant types are shown in\n\
    Figure 5.\nHowever, only 19.40% of the 3,278 variety rights au-\nthorized for\
    \ these ﬁve ﬁeld crops have been promoted, and\nonly 26.95% of the authorized\
    \ varieties of commercial crop\ncotton have been promoted. Te authorized promotion\
    \ of\nﬁeld crops is shown in Figure 6.\nAmong the surveyed units, there are 23\
    \ individual units,\n16 private enterprises, 14 collective units, 21 joint-stock\
    \ units,\n12 private enterprises, 12 state-owned enterprises, 2 coop-\nerative\
    \ enterprises, 1 institution of higher learning, and 7\nother units, a total of\
    \ 108. Te top three in terms of quantity\nare: individual enterprises, joint-stock\
    \ enterprises, and private\nenterprises, accounting for 22%, 19%, and 15% of all\
    \ units,\nrespectively. Te speciﬁc distribution is shown in Figure 7.\nTe mean\
    \ scores from high to low are: the R&D capa-\nbility of the enterprise, the mean\
    \ value is 4.18; the degree of\ntechnological innovation, the mean value is 4.07;\
    \ the\ncomplexity of plant variety rights, the mean value is 3.96; the\nability\
    \ of enterprises to control R&D costs, the mean value is\n3.94; the experimental\
    \ scale of R&D, the mean value is 3.67.\nBased on this, it can be inferred that\
    \ among all the factors\naﬀecting the R&D cost of plant variety rights, the R&D\n\
    capability of the enterprise has the greatest impact on the\nR&D cost, while the\
    \ experimental scale of R&D has the least\nimpact on the R&D cost of plant variety\
    \ rights. Figure 8\nshows the statistics of factors aﬀecting the R&D cost of plant\n\
    variety rights.\nTe complexity score of plant variety rights is concen-\ntrated\
    \ on 3, 4, and 5, which are important, very important,\nand extremely important,\
    \ as reﬂected in Figure 8. Te se-\nlection of these three items accounts for 97.2%\
    \ of the total\nselection. Te importance evaluation of the scale of plant\nvariety\
    \ rights R&D trials is shown in Figure 9.\nIt can be seen from Figure 10 that\
    \ the respondents’\nrecognition of the scale of R&D trials is mainly focused on\n\
    “very important.” Te distribution of the scores of the\nremaining items is also\
    \ relatively uniform, with 10 people\nwho think that this factor has an average\
    \ degree of inﬂuence,\n29 people who think that the degree of inﬂuence is im-\n\
    portant, and 17 people who think it is extremely important.\nAccording to this,\
    \ it can be inferred that the scale of research\nand development has a certain\
    \ impact on the research and\ndevelopment costs of plant variety rights. Te technical\n\
    innovation evaluation of plant variety rights is shown in\nFigure 10.\n5. Discussion\n\
    China’s securitization development continues to advance,\nand the balance structure\
    \ of the ﬁnancial market is also\nunder certain pressure. Due to the falling interest\
    \ rate level,\nthe ﬁnancial market under macro-control and government\npolicies\
    \ cannot achieve equilibrium, resulting in abnormal\nﬁnancial institutions such\
    \ as shadow banking. With the\ninvestment in research and development of new plant\
    \ va-\nrieties and the continuous development of high-tech agri-\ncultural production,\
    \ many breeding scientiﬁc research\ninstitutions and seed industry enterprises\
    \ have begun to seek\nvarious ways to absorb social funds to obtain corporate\n\
    ﬁnancing, which makes the form of plant variety rights\nsecuritization developed.\
    \ Breeding scientiﬁc research insti-\ntutions and seed industry enterprises can\
    \ cooperate with\nﬁnancial institutions, use computers and the Internet for\n\
    securitization ﬁnancing, and introduce concepts such as\nﬁnancial technology,\
    \ Internet ﬁnance, and blockchain smart\ncontracts for project innovation. Trough\
    \ the establishment\nof an open and transparent trust network in the untrusted\n\
    cooperation, the plant variety rights securitization trans-\nactions involving\
    \ multiple parties can be recognized. In this\nprocess, it is necessary to strengthen\
    \ the ﬁnancial supervi-\nsion of the entire market and operation links [26].\n\
    From a functional point of view, intellectual property\nprotection and anti-monopoly\
    \ regulation are complemen-\ntary in function. First, intellectual property protection\
    \ and\nanti-monopoly law adjustment methods are complemen-\ntary. On the one hand,\

    behaviors that restrict competition and harm the interests of\nconsumers.\nAn\n\
    intellectual\nproperty\nlicensing\nact\nis\nundoubtedly legal in the scope of\
    \ intellectual property law,\nbut it is subject to anti-monopoly regulation because\
    \ it may\nharm competition. Similarly, a market operation behavior\nthat does\
    \ not violate the anti-monopoly law may be pro-\nhibited by the intellectual property\

    \ For the\nanti-monopoly regulation of intellectual property restricting\ncompetition\

    \ a series of internal restriction systems of intel-\nlectual property, which\
    \ self-regulate from the inside and\nbalance the relationship between intellectual\
    \ property rights\nand social public interests.\nAt the same time, a major diﬀerence\
    \ between plant\nbreeding work and industrial invention is that the former\nis\
    \ highly dependent on existing reproductive materials\nand biological genetic\
    \ information. If subsequent inno-\nvators cannot obtain relevant materials or\
    \ genetic in-\nformation, breeding work is useless. In addition, other\nthan the\
    \ exclusivity, temporality, and regionality of\ntraditional intellectual property\
    \ rights, variety rights have\nboth self-replication, agriculture-related attributes,\
    \ and\nseasonality and regionality of crop planting. Special\nconsideration should\
    \ be given to its protection and\nregulation; not only should it be given exclusive\
    \ rights to\nmaintain breeding innovation and proﬁts but also to\nprotect the\
    \ normal competition in the seed industry\nmarket and the supply of agricultural\
    \ products.\nTe general license for the implementation of variety\nrights means\
    \ that the variety rights holder authorizes the\nlicensee to implement the variety\
    \ within a certain time and\nterritory. At the same time, within this scope, the\
    \ breeder can\nimplement the breed by himself or herself or allow others to\n\
    implement the breed. Tis model is conducive to the variety\nrights holders to\
    \ adjust their licensing strategy in real time\naccording to market changes, and\
    \ at the same time, the\nvariety is more widely spread, the breeding cost can\
    \ be\nquickly recovered, and the commercial beneﬁts can be\nmaximized quickly.\
    \ Also, the dispersion of implementation\nrights makes it diﬃcult to restrict\
    \ competition in the market,\nwhich is conducive to technological progress and\
    \ increasing\nproduction and income. Te disadvantage of this model is\nthat the\
    \ variety rights are licensed too widely, and vicious\ncompetition occurs in the\
    \ relevant market, which damages\nthe interests of both parties.\nTe anti-monopoly\
    \ regulation of variety rights licensing\nis the speciﬁc application of the theory\
    \ of limitation of rights\nin the ﬁeld of variety rights. In order to maintain\
    \ the research\nand development motivation of breeders, the breed rights\nprotection\

    \ holder is an infringement. At the same time, the\nadvancement of breeding technology\
    \ and the development\nof the agricultural industry require that the relevant\
    \ plant\nbreeding achievements can be fully disclosed, disseminated,\nand implemented\
    \ in the ﬁeld of agricultural production.\nHuge contradictions need to be reconciled\
    \ by setting up a\nsystem through the theory of rights limitation. On the one\n\
    hand, the variety rights self-restriction system, such as the\nvariety rights\
    \ licensing system (voluntary license and\ncompulsory license), regulates the\
    \ abuse of rights from\nwithin; on the other hand, while fully respecting and\
    \ rec-\nognizing the variety rights, the anti-monopoly law should\nalso restrict\
    \ the variety rights through reasonable means and\nregulate the monopoly behavior\
    \ of the variety rights. Rel-\nevant crop varieties produced, sold, and promoted\
    \ by\nbreeding companies and agricultural technology companies\nare often plant\
    \ varieties with speciﬁc traits cultivated\nthrough scientiﬁc and technological\
    \ means, such as traits\nsuitable for speciﬁc soils, speciﬁc chemical fertilizers,\
    \ or\nspeciﬁc farming methods. After long-term production and\nplanting, the soil\
    \ composition has been basically ﬁxed, and a\ncertain variety has gradually adapted\
    \ to the soil environment\nof this plot, and can obtain higher yields. Agricultural\n\
    producers will gradually form a heavy dependence on the\nspeciﬁc variety, and\
    \ eventually evolve into a situation where\nit is diﬃcult to carry out agricultural\
    \ production if the seeds\ncultivated and provided by relevant breeding companies\n\
    cannot be obtained. When the relevant variety rights and\ncrop seeds are controlled\
    \ by the breeding enterprise and the\nvariety rights holder, the relevant competitors\
    \ cannot copy\nor obtain them, and the controller has the ability and\nconditions\
    \ to license but refuses to license the relevant\nrights, seed-related variety\
    \ rights, and crop seeds; such\nvariety rights and crop seeds should be identiﬁed\

    \ factor to consider whether to reg-\nulate related behaviors. Te tying behavior\
    \ in intellectual\nproperty licensing means that the right holder in a dominant\n\
    market position requires the licensee to accept other un-\nrelated intellectual\
    \ property rights and products, or the act of\npurchasing unnecessary goods or\
    \ services from the right\nholder or a third party designated by it. Te tying\
    \ sale, which\nis covered by the Anti-monopoly Law, requires the right\nholder\
    \ to have a dominant market position and abuse it;\nsuch a dominant market position\
    \ may be possessed by the\nright holder itself or it may be the dominant market\
    \ position\nformed by the horizontal joint agreement between opera-\ntors. Secondly,\
    \ it is required that the tying product can be\nindependently licensed or sold.\
    \ If the right holder does not\nhave a dominant market position, or the licensed\
    \ intellectual\nproperty rights and property rights or products and services\n\
    are inseparable and cannot be licensed and sold separately,\nthis behavior is\
    \ not subject to anti-monopoly laws.\nIt should be noted that it is necessary\
    \ to avoid the balance\nbetween the compulsory license and the interests of the\n\
    variety rights holder, and avoid excessive restrictions on the\ninterests of the\
    \ variety rights holder due to the abuse of\ncompulsory license, so as to conform\
    \ to the original in-\ntention of the establishment of the variety rights protection\n\
    system. Te anti-monopoly legal system and the variety\nrights protection system\
    \ are the legal norms to adjust the\nrights and obligations between the variety\
    \ owner and the\nlicensee, agricultural producers, and even the consumers of\n\
    agricultural products, and are the balancer of the interests of\nall parties.\
    \ Te anti-monopoly regulation of variety rights\nlicensing has practical signiﬁcance\
    \ and an important role in\nthe development of China’s agricultural industry and\
    \ the\nguarantee of food security; it is mainly manifested in the\nfunctions of\
    \ prevention, regulation, and relief of monopoly\nbehavior in variety rights licensing,\
    \ which in turn promotes\nthe continuous progress of breeding technology, the\
    \ im-\nprovement of consumer welfare, the development of agri-\ncultural industry,\
    \ and the maintenance of food security.\nNowadays, China’s breeding technology\
    \ has made great\nprogress, the proportion of foreign capital in China’s\nbreeding\
    \ industry is also increasing year by year, and the\nimpact of variety rights\
    \ on the economy and trade is be-\ncoming more and more important. However, there\
    \ are few\nacademic studies in this ﬁeld, which leads to many problems\nin the\
    \ current anti-monopoly regulation of variety rights\nlicensing that need to be\
    \ solved urgently. Terefore, it is\nnecessary to strengthen the research on anti-monopoly\n\
    regulation of variety rights licensing, analyze and examine\nthe interest relationship\
    \ in variety rights licensing, and\nsystematically sort out existing problems\
    \ and propose so-\nlutions, in order to play its due function of preventive\n\
    regulation and relief, and help the development of the seed\nindustry [27].\n\
    Tis topic needs to be studied from a broader per-\nspective. For example, economic\
    \ growth is one of the\npurposes of improving the legal system, so it is equally\n\
    important to use economic indicators to analyze the eﬀec-\ntiveness of the legal\
    \ system and to assist the implementation\nof the law. When conducting anti-monopoly\
    \ analysis on\nbehaviors that restrict competition by variety rights li-\ncensing,\
    \ economic analysis methods can be used to evaluate\nthe impact of relevant behaviors\
    \ on competition and in-\nnovation. In the process of implementing and remedying\
    \ the\nanti-monopoly system of variety rights licensing, the ana-\nlytical method\
    \ of economics can also play an important role.\nEnterprises may have infringement\
    \ risks, commercial dis-\nclosure risks, technical risks, and product counterfeiting\n\
    risks in the process of intellectual property operation. Based\non this, the concept\
    \ of intellectual property management is\nproposed to prevent these speciﬁc risks\
    \ in intellectual\nproperty\nrights,\nand\nreduce\nthe\npossibility\nof\nrisk\n\
    management.\nTe modernization of agriculture and rural areas is\ninseparable from\
    \ science and technology. Te continuous\nprogress of breeding technology and the\
    \ healthy develop-\nment of agricultural industry are the powerful starting points\n\
    of rural revitalization. Te progress of seed industry is the\nbasic element to\
    \ promote the modernization of agriculture\nand rural areas. To realize technology-led\
    \ rural revitalization\nand agricultural and rural modernization, the relationship\n\
    between variety rights holders, licensees, agricultural pro-\nducers, agricultural\
    \ product consumers, and social public\ninterests should be well balanced. Trough\
    \ the interpretation\nof the basic issues of anti-monopoly of variety rights li-\n\
    censing, this paper sorts out the system status quo of anti-\nmonopoly regulations\
    \ on variety rights licensing outside the\nterritory. Based on the existing problems\
    \ in China, a sys-\ntematic research and demonstration has been carried out on\n\
    the improvement of the anti-monopoly regulatory system\nfor variety rights licensing\
    \ [28].\n6. Conclusion\nWith the widespread popularity of the Internet, mobile\n\
    phones, the Internet of Tings and artiﬁcial intelligence,\ninformation data have\
    \ grown exponentially, generating\nmassive data (Big Data). How to quickly and\
    \ eﬃciently\nextract and display invisible data in these unstructured big\ndata\
    \ knowledge is very important. Visualization tech-\nnology can solve this problem\
    \ very well. Te plant variety\nrights pricing model mainly involves technical\
    \ risk, value\nassessment risk, operational risk, variety rights own risk,\nlegal\
    \ policy risk, and market risk. Risk warning is an\nimportant part of risk management.\
    \ Collect relevant data\nthrough big data technology, collect and analyze indi-\n\
    cators, look for potential risks, and timely warn and\ncontrol risks for the plant\
    \ variety rights pricing model.\nWestern countries ﬁrst put forward the concept\
    \ of cap-\nitalized operation, and intellectual property capitalization\nis also\
    \ a hot topic, but most of them are limited to the ﬁeld\nof law. Tere is almost\
    \ no systematic research on the\ncapitalization of plant variety rights. Scholars\
    \ have mainly\ndiscussed the three aspects of the capitalization operation\nof\
    \ plant variety rights: pledge, capital contribution, and\nsecuritization. Few\
    \ of them have studied the capitalization\noperation risks. Terefore, there is\
    \ a lot of room for\ndiscussion in this ﬁeld. From the perspective of man-\nagement,\
    \ this paper will make more beneﬁcial attempts to\n12\nScientiﬁc Programming\n\
    capitalize the operational risk of plant variety rights.\nBased on the big data,\
    \ this paper discusses and analyzes\nthe key words of the classic literature,\
    \ which provides a\nreference for the research on the securitization pricing of\n\
    plant variety rights. Te bibliometric and knowledge map\nanalysis of securitization\
    \ pricing, the use of ﬁnancial big\ndata, data collection technology and learning\
    \ analysis\nmethods, combined with cross-ﬁeld and multi-disci-\nplinary characteristics,\
    \ provide a direction for the re-\nsearch\nand\ndevelopment\nof\nplant\nvariety\n\
    rights\nsecuritization, lay a foundation for the theoretical dis-\ncussion on\
    \ the securitization and pricing of plant variety\nrights, and also point out\
    \ the way for the securitization\nand capitalization of plant variety rights under\
    \ big data.\nTe research on the capitalization operation risk of plant\nvariety\
    \ rights can not only help identify various risks in\nthe capitalization operation\
    \ of plant variety rights, to\nprovide advice on risk prevention and control,\
    \ and to\npromote the development of China’s variety rights cap-\nitalization\
    \ theory, but also provide guidance for seed\nindustry enterprises to carry out\
    \ the capitalization op-\neration of plant variety rights. Terefore, this research\
    \ has\npractical value and signiﬁcance. Due to the broad de-\nvelopment prospects\
    \ of plant variety rights, seed industry\nenterprises and scientiﬁc research institutions\
    \ urgently\nneed to meet the ﬁnancing needs of enterprises by de-\nveloping the\
    \ economic potential of plant variety rights.\nPrevious studies by scholars have\
    \ mainly focused on the\ndemonstration and analysis of plant variety rights com-\n\
    mercial bank ﬁnancing, listed company ﬁnancing, gov-\nernment behavior ﬁnance,\
    \ securities investment funds,\netc., but there is no comprehensive analysis of\
    \ plant va-\nriety rights securitization. Te risk evaluation index of\nplant variety\
    \ rights capitalization operation of seed in-\ndustry enterprises is selected,\
    \ and all the risk factors in the\ncapitalization operation system of variety\
    \ rights cannot be\nconsidered, and there is a certain subjectivity. Terefore,\n\
    in the future research work, the risk factors can be further\nstudied to form\
    \ more objective, systematic, and com-\nprehensive indicators.\nData Availability\n\

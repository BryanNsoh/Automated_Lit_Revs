- analysis: 'This paper is highly relevant to the point of "Considerations: volume,
    frequency, format, and source of the data" within the context of the literature
    review and the subsection on irrigation management data.


    The paper recognizes the need to improve interoperability among irrigation management
    tools to reduce user effort and increase adoption. It focuses on developing data
    standards to enable the exchange of data currently stored in various proprietary
    formats.


    This is crucial for ensuring data consistency and compatibility, allowing for
    seamless integration and analysis of irrigation management data. The paper''s
    emphasis on data exchange formats and schemas aligns well with the review''s intention
    to address data considerations in automated irrigation systems.'

  description: As the biggest water user in most regions of the world, irrigation
    is facing significant challenges in balancing social, economic and environmental
    needs for water. More than 25 percent of the world's agriculture is grown in areas
    of high water stress. The tension between crop production and available water
    supply is already great, as agriculture currently accounts for more than 70 percent
    of all human water withdrawal. This tension will only intensify. The 2030 Water
    Resources Group forecasts that water demand will rise 50 percent by 2030. Yet
    water supplies will not - and physically cannot - grow in parallel. Agriculture
    will drive nearly half of that additional demand, because global calorie production
    needs to increase 69 percent to feed 9.6 billion people by 2050. Technology has
    provided many tools to help growers irrigate their land more efficiently. However,
    these tools rarely work together well, and; growers using them must invest extra
    effort to bring the information together. Improving interoperability among these
    tools will reduce users' effort, increase adoption, and lead to greater water
    use efficiency through improved accuracy and precision of irrigation management.
    Over the past year, a group of companies has been collaborating to develop data
    standards to enable interoperability of environmental sensors, soil mapping, advanced
    pump controls, variable rate irrigation, and software applications. The goal is
    an industry-wide format that will enable the exchange, and use by irrigation management
    systems, of data currently stored in a variety of proprietary formats. This work
    is currently taking place in the context of AgGateway's Water Management Group
    and PAIL project. We will present the results of this collaboration (user stories,
    data schemas and simulated demonstration).

  limitations: The paper does not delve into specific details regarding data volume,
    frequency, and source, which could have provided a more comprehensive analysis
    of the data considerations.

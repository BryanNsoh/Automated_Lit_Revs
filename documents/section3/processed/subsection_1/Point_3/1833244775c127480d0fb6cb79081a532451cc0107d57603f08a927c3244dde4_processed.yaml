- analysis: 'The paper, titled "Assessment of energy audit and environmental impacts
    throughout the life cycle of barley production under different irrigation systems"
    presents a study focused on assessing the energy and environmental implications
    of barley production under three primary irrigation methods: flood (FI), sprinkler

    its environmental footprint.


    The significance of this work lies in its potential to guide decision-making for
    farmers, policymakers, and stakeholders by providing valuable insights into the
    energy efficiency and environmental impact trade-offs associated with different

    systemsSustainability 1. Introduction The impact of climate change on crop irrigation
    and food security is a critical issue that requires attention. As climate patterns
    change, the demand for water by crops is expected to rise, leading to the need
    for adjustments in agricultural practices to maintain sustainable food production.
    The use of supplemental irrigation for traditionally non-irrigated crops is becoming
    more common in response to these changing climate conditions. Climate change is
    expected to have a significant impact on various aspects of agriculture, with
    its influence varying throughout the farming cycle. Therefore, it is important
    to model the effects of climate change on agricultural productivity by considering
    the interconnected physical, technical, and economic factors. This often involves
    using indicators that summarize the environmental factors that farmers consider
    when planning their activities (Dono et al., 2013). Additionally, it would be
    beneficial to mention the potential impact of climate change on the water availability
    for these crops, and how supplementary irrigation can help mitigate the effects
    of water scarcity. This would provide a broader context for the importance of
    the research and its potential implications for agricultural sustainability in
    the face of changing environmental conditions. Furthermore, it would be helpful
    to briefly mention the current methods of irrigation for autumn-winter cereals
    and how they may not be sufficient to meet the water requirements of the crops,
    especially during critical growth stages. This would set the stage for the discussion
    of the need for supplementary irrigation and the potential benefits it can provide
    for crop yields. Overall, by providing a more comprehensive introduction that
    highlights the broader significance of the research and its potential applications
    beyond barley cultivation, the article can effectively engage a wider audience
    and emphasize the relevance of the proposed approach in addressing important agricultural
    challenges (Konapala et al., 2020). Barley (Hordeum vulgar L.) is a versatile
    cereal grain that is well-suited to various environmental conditions, including
    drought, salt, and cold. It has played a vital role in transforming the field
    of agriculture. Barley was one of the earliest crops to be cultivated by humans
    (UnNisa et al., 2022). Over time, dedicated barley breeders have made significant
    advancements in enhancing its qualities, such as improving seed dormancy, seed
    vigor, and resistance to diseases like rusts and scald. These improvements have
    resulted in increased yield per unit of land (Pardo et al., 2022). In addition
    to its agricultural significance, barley offers numerous health benefits and is
    widely utilized in the process of malting. Barley, a prominent cereal crop globally,
    holds the second position in Europe, right after bread wheat. In the world, the
    production of barley reached 48, 941, 020 ha and 145, 623, 914.5 tons. Specifically
    in Iran, the cultivation of barley covered 2,108,193 ha, yielding 2,814,263.68
    tons (FAO, 2021). The quantity of water needed to achieve the highest yield in
    a barley crop is not constant. It varies depending on factors such as temperature,
    relative humidity, wind, and soil moisture, which influence the rate of evaporation
    from the soil and transpiration from the plant. In ideal growing seasons, the
    water requirement can be as low as 320–420 mm. However, during hotter and drier
    years, this requirement may increase to 360–470 mm in order to achieve maximum
    yields (Khan et al., 2010). The crop''s yield is heavily reliant on moisture availability
    during this stage. If there is moisture stress lasting more than a few days, it
    will lead to a decrease in both grain yield and quality. The amount of barley
    to plant in irrigated areas depends on the barley price, available water, and
    irrigation plan. If water is not a limiting factor, the goal is to maximize yield
    by scheduling irrigations to meet the crop''s water needs and prevent stress throughout
    the growing season (Payandeh et al., 2021). This necessitates careful monitoring
    of soil moisture after secondary root development has finished. In order to increase
    production, it is essential to effectively manage irrigation. This entails having
    a comprehensive understanding of various factors, including soil fertility, the
    relationship between soil, water, and plants, the type of crop being grown, the
    crop''s sensitivity to water stress, the different stages of crop growth, the
    availability of water supply, and the impact of climatic conditions such as rainfall,
    temperature, humidity, and net radiation (Morandini et al., 2020). Additionally,
    it is important to consider the capabilities and limitations of the irrigation
    system. A successful and efficient irrigation management strategy should be tailored
    to the specific crop being cultivated. By implementing crop-specific irrigation
    management strategies, water can be utilized effectively to meet the specific
    water requirements of each crop, thereby maximizing water productivity (Jones
    et al., 2012). Increasing the irrigation management root zone from 50 cm to 100
    cm during the late boot growth stage has several benefits. It allows for less
    frequent but larger irrigation volumes, resulting in increased water availability
    for the mature barley roots. The amount of irrigation required to replenish the
    root zone after reaching the allowable depletion soil water level will vary depending
    on soil texture and growth stage (Hassanien et al., 2016). To assess the effectiveness
    of different irrigation schedules, the apparent water productivity index is used.
    This index measures the returns from each drop of irrigation water application
    under various methods and schedules of irrigation. Drip irrigation, specifically
    at 80% of crop evapotranspiration with 80% of the recommended dose of fertilizers,
    is not only economically viable but also offers higher water and energy productivity
    compared to absolute control methods (Khan et al., 2010). The environment and
    irrigation system have a significant impact on energy input, energy output, and
    greenhouse gas emissions. It is reported that drip irrigation has the highest
    energy input (75.59 GJ ha−1), followed by flood irrigation (62.67 GJ ha−1) and
    sprinkler irrigation (49.81 GJ ha−1). In the case of drip irrigation, the primary
    energy-consuming component is polyethylene pipelines, accounting for approximately
    one-third of the total input energy. On the other hand, diesel fuel consumption
    is the main energy consumption factor in furrow and sprinkler irrigation systems,
    accounting for 32.77% and 36.2% of energy consumption, respectively (Jamali et
    al., 2021). In recent decades, the adoption of water-efficient agriculture has
    led to a significant rise in energy usage for irrigation. This surge in energy
    costs has now posed a threat to the sustainability of many irrigation systems.
    Although the energy required for irrigation is only a small portion of the overall
    energy consumption in human activities, it has emerged as a crucial concern for
    the irrigation sector and a vital determinant for ensuring food security (Gillani
    et al., 2010). Around the world, crop irrigation accounts for about 70% of the
    total fresh water supply, with 90% of this irrigation occurring in arid and semi-arid
    regions. Statistics show that irrigation pumps directly consume 23–48% of the
    global agricultural energy consumption, and the continuous rise in energy usage
    in these areas is becoming a significant concern for irrigation availability (Uysal
    and Atiş, 2010). Thus, the objective of this research is to assess the energy
    consumption and environmental consequences of barley production through different
    irrigation systems, utilizing energy audits and life cycle assessment (LCA). This
    examination will offer valuable information regarding the sustainability of the
    irrigation methods and pinpoint areas where energy efficiency and environmental
    effectiveness can be enhanced. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Data collection and
    study area The research took place in the Mahyar plain, which is located in Shahreza
    city in the Isfahan province, Iran. The village of Mahyar is situated at an elevation
    of 1665 m above sea level, with coordinates of 32° 16′ North latitude and 51°
    350 East longitude in relation to the Greenwich meridian (Fig. 1.). Despite experiencing
    drought conditions, the Mahyar plain has a significant amount of land suitable
    for farming. Specifically, 1500 ha are used for growing wheat and 3500 ha are
    dedicated to malting barley cultivation (Ministry of Jihad-e-Agriculture of Iran,
    2020). The Cochran method, as described in Equation (1) (Cochran, 1977), is used
    to determine the sample size, which is 20 farms. (1) Download : Download high-res

    of the region under investigation in Esfahan Province, Iran. Let''s denote the
    required sample size as n, the number of farms per target population as N, the
    reliability coefficient as z (equal to 1.96 for a 95% confidence level), the estimated
    proportion of an attribute present in the population as p (equal to 0.5), the
    complement of p as q (equal to 0.5), and the permitted error ratio deviation from
    the average population as d (equal to 0.05). 2.2. Description of irrigation systems
    In this study, the effects of three major irrigation methods, namely, flood (FI),
    sprinkler (SI) and drip irrigation (DI) were examined. The traditional forms of
    irrigation, known as flood, surface or gravity irrigation, involves the distribution
    of water over the ground via gravity. Pressurized irrigation, on the other hand,
    can be categorized into rain and DI methods. Rain irrigation involves the use
    of sprinklers to splash water in drops similar to rain, while DI delivers water
    through droppers in drops, irrigating only the area around the plant''s root.
    This makes DI a local irrigation method, unlike rain irrigation, which covers
    the entire field. DI localized approach reduces water consumption and increases
    irrigation efficiency compared to rain irrigation. Water pressure is another distinguishing
    factor between the two methods, with rain irrigation systems requiring more pressure
    than DI systems. In this research, the fixed classic rain irrigation and tubular
    tape DI systems are investigated. 2.3. Energy audit An energy audit is a procedure
    designed to evaluate the energy usage of a system, pinpoint areas of high, due
    to its high and intensive consumption of energy sources, poses significant environmental
    energy consumption, propose solutions, and identify opportunities for reducing
    energy consumption. The agricultural sector challenges such as depletion of resources,
    contribution to global warming, and risks to human health (Kaab et al., 2019a,
    b). Reducing environmental damage is a crucial challenge in the agricultural sector''s
    energy use. The irrigation system heavily relies on energy and water, which are
    essential inputs for both social and economic development (Ghasemi-Mobtaker et
    al., 2020a). Modern irrigation methods in agriculture can be examined from various
    perspectives, but the primary focus is on the significant portion of energy dedicated
    to irrigation systems, which involve extracting water from wells and pumping stations
    for agricultural crop production (Taherzadeh-Shalmaei et al., 2021). Energy equivalences
    are calculated by documenting all inputs used in the production of malting barley,
    including diesel fuel, fertilizers, human labor, agricultural machinery, seed,
    biocides, and electricity. These inputs are both direct and indirect and are recorded
    throughout the growing season. The resulting outputs are barley grain yield and
    straw. Electricity is utilized for pumping water from wells, while agricultural
    machinery is powered by diesel fuel. Table 1 provides the energy coefficients
    for different operations involved in barley production. By analyzing the energy
    inputs in barley cultivation and applying the energy coefficients, energy equivalences
    can be determined. Table 1. Energy coefficients and energy inputs-outputs in various

    energy consumption of the irrigation system encompasses both the total diesel
    fuel consumed by the diesel engine and the calculated weight of the machinery,
    which comprises the diesel engine and the wheel-move system. Energy indices including
    energy ratio (ER), energy productivity (EP), specific energy (SE), net energy
    gain (NEG) and water use efficiency (WUE) are computed by equations (4), (5),

    2.4. LCA steps LCA, is a systematic and organized method employed to assess the
    ecological repercussions of diverse systems. It is also valuable for comparing
    alternative choices and determining the most advantageous option based on their
    environmental consequences. The LCA procedure entails scrutinizing and appraising
    the complete resources utilized, outputs generated, and environmental impacts
    incurred throughout every phase of a product''s lifespan (Rattanatum et al., 2018).
    LCA is a tool used for environmental management, which evaluates the environmental
    impacts of production services or systems from start to finish. The LCA process
    typically involves four stages: establishing the scope and objective, conducting
    a Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) analysis, performing a Life Cycle Impact Assessment
    (LCIA), and interpreting the findings (Peiró et al., 2010). The study employs
    the ReCiPe2016 method, which associates each damage category with a specific path.
    These pathways are dependent on the type of damage, either to humans, ecosystems,
    or resource availability (Huijbregts et al., 2017). The study has identified three
    categories of damage, namely human health, ecosystem, and resource availability.
    The human health category includes respiratory diseases, various types of cancer,
    and malnutrition. The severity of these diseases is evaluated using DALY, which
    considers both premature death and reduced quality of life due to illness. The
    ecosystem damage category covers harm to freshwater, terrestrial, and marine species,
    and the unit of measurement used is species year. Lastly, the study measures the
    damage caused to resource availability by increased extraction costs, and the
    unit of measurement used is United States dollars for the year 2013 (USD 2013)
    (Fernández-Tirado et al., 2016). In Fig. 2, the connections between midpoint impact
    categories, damage pathways, and endpoint areas of production are depicted in
    the ReCiPe 2016 method. The midpoint indicators in this method specifically address
    distinct environmental issues like climate change or acidification. Conversely,
    the endpoint indicators provide a comprehensive evaluation of the overall environmental
    impact on three broader levels: human health, biodiversity, and resource scarcity.
    The conversion of midpoint indicators to endpoint indicators facilitates the interpretation
    of life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) results. However, it is important to note
    that each step of aggregation introduces more uncertainty into the final outcomes.

    method of LCA. 2.4.1. First step in LCA The initial stage of an LCA investigation
    involves establishing the functional unit, which acts as the foundation for quantifying
    inputs and outputs. In this specific study, the focus is on evaluating the production
    per metric ton of barley. To establish the objective in LCA studies, a strategy
    is implemented, which entails delineating the system boundaries to ascertain the
    extent of the research. The system boundaries are determined based on the study''s
    scope and the information available in the area. The subsequent calculations are
    carried out while taking these boundaries into account (Mouron et al., 2006, Van
    Zutphen and Wijbrans, 2012). In this particular study, the system boundary is
    depicted in Fig. 3. Download : Download high-res image (814KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. System boundary of barley production in Esfahan province,
    Iran. 2.4.2. Second stage in LCA The life cycle impact analysis was conducted
    using Simapro version 9.0.0 software. Once the study''s purpose and scope were
    defined, the LCI implementation in LCA was carried out. The LCI analysis phase
    generally consists of three key sections: collection, calculation, and data allocation.
    Quantitative and qualitative data for each unit within the system boundary were
    collected and recorded in the report. The gathered data could be measured, calculated,
    or estimated (Renaud-Gentié et al., 2015). The study assessed the environmental
    harm caused by the production process of various inputs used in malting barley
    production, known as indirect emissions. These inputs included machinery, diesel
    fuel, chemical fertilizers, manure, biocides, and electricity. Additionally, the
    study considered several categories associated with the direct use of inputs on
    the farm for malting barley production to calculate direct emissions. Data from
    the EcoInvent database were used to calculate these direct emissions (Bartzas
    et al., 2015, Brentrup et al., 2000). Environmental emissions can pose a threat
    to the quality of water, air, and soil. An important source of emissions is the
    utilization of diesel fuel in machinery during different stages. Barley production
    commonly relies on diesel fuel for activities such as spraying and fertilizing
    to protect against pests, fungi, and other harmful elements. On farms, emissions
    are also generated through the use of chemical fertilizers, human labor, and biocides.
    Additionally, the application of manure and chemical fertilizers in barley production
    can directly release heavy metals into the environment (Ahlgren et al., 2013).
    Table 2 shows the coefficients related to the burning of one MJ of diesel fuel,
    while Table 3 exhibits the coefficients associated with the utilization of chemical
    fertilizers, human labor, and biocide application. Furthermore, Table 4 provides
    comprehensive information about the usage of manure and chemical fertilizers.

    In order to align with the other stages of LCA, it is essential for this step
    to be consistent. To effectively accomplish the objectives and scope of the study,
    LCA should be carefully organized to assess the impacts across the entire life
    cycle of the product. The objective of LCIA is to provide additional interpretation
    of the inventory data (Alaphilippe et al., 2013, Nabavi-Pelesaraei et al., 2019).
    The ReCiPe2016 method defines the 17 mid-point impact categories assessed, as
    depicted in Fig. 2. Additionally, this method suggests endpoint categories to
    assess harm to human health, ecosystems, and resources (Huijbregts et al., 2017).
    2.4.4. Fourth step in LCA The final step in product life cycle evaluation is result
    analysis. This includes evaluating the outcomes of previous stages and pinpointing
    the production and consumption stages of barley crop that have the highest and
    lowest negative environmental impacts. Ultimately, conclusions and solutions are
    examined (Sherwani et al., 2010). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Energy use results
    Table 5 and Fig. 4 presents data on the energy consumption for various inputs,
    as well as the energy consumption per hectare for each input. The table is divided
    into two sections, one for the energy used for inputs and the other for the energy
    used for production, which includes barely and straw. According to the table,
    nitrogen fertilizer and electricity are the two factors that contribute the most
    to energy consumption in all three irrigation methods: FI, DI, and SI. The energy
    consumption for nitrogen fertilizer in the FI, DI, and SI methods is 42,991, 45636.60,
    and 41888.67 respectively. Therefore, the SI method is considered the most suitable
    option due to its lower nitrogen fertilizer energy consumption. Additionally,
    when considering electricity consumption, the amounts for the FI, DI, and SI methods
    are 38,712, 27619.20, and 21,964 MJ ha−1 respectively. In terms of electricity
    consumption, the SI method is the most cost effective irrigation method. The research
    findings on the environmental impacts of energy use in wheat tillage systems indicate
    that the total average energy consumption was estimated to be 30,000 MJ ha−1.
    This energy consumption was primarily attributed to fertilizers, diesel fuel,
    water, and seed inputs. Among the different tillage systems studied, the conservation
    tillage system (reduced tillage) demonstrated the highest output-input energy
    ratio and energy productivity. This was followed by the no-tillage system and
    the moldboard plough and combined seeder system (Houshyar and Grundmann, 2017).

    image Fig. 4. Shares of energy sources in malting barley production under different
    irrigation systems. The information depicted in Fig. 4 emphasizes that nitrogen
    chemical fertilizer usage has the most significant influence on energy consumption
    among the three irrigation methods. Electricity consumption closely trails behind.
    Hence, to decrease overall energy usage, it is recommended to reduce the usage
    of nitrogen fertilizer or explore alternative options that require less energy.
    Additionally, it is advisable to conduct research to assess the impact of reduced
    nitrogen fertilizer consumption on production levels, considering factors like
    economics, environment, and community health. The study evaluated energy-environmental
    indicators in various wheat production systems. The findings indicated in Table
    6, that the irrigated conservation tillage system had favorable energy ratio (2.12)
    and energy productivity (0.18 kg MJ−1) compared to conventional irrigated and
    rainfed tillage, as well as conservation rainfed tillage. The consumption of nitrogen
    fertilizer (55%–68%) and diesel fuel (15%–31%) significantly influenced the energy
    consumption across the four wheat cultivation systems (Khalaj et al., 2023). Table

    1.20 1.79 1.70 According to the results presented in Table 6, the SI method ranks
    first, while the DI and FI methods rank second and third, respectively. This ranking
    indicates that the Sprinkler method outperforms the others in terms of energy
    efficiency, yield per unit of energy consumption, energy consumption per unit
    of production, and the difference between output and input energy. In other words,
    the SI method is the most effective irrigation method in terms of energy consumption.
    Therefore, it is recommended to promote the use of the SI method. To support and
    enhance the adoption of this method, the following solutions are proposed. 1.
    Provide operator training to ensure proper implementation of the SI method. 2.
    Offer government support, such as subsidies or grants, to encourage farmers to
    adopt the SI method. 3. Introduce incentive packages for stakeholders who choose
    to use the SI method. 4. Facilitate access to low-interest rate loans for investment
    in SI method equipment. 5. Support manufacturers of SI method equipment to ensure
    availability and affordability. 6. Reduce or exempt taxes for individuals and
    businesses involved in the agricultural and industrial sectors, particularly those
    utilizing the SI method. By implementing these solutions, the adoption and development
    of the SI method can be promoted, leading to increased energy efficiency and productivity
    in irrigation practices. 3.2. LCA results 3.2.1. Analysis of on-farm emissions
    Table 7 presents the discharge of substances into water, air, and soil resulting
    from each of the efficient inputs. The findings indicate that the application
    of fertilizers results in the release of pollutants into the soil and air. Diesel
    fuel is identified as one of the primary contributors to emissions. The Sprinkler
    system emits the most CO2 from diesel fuel, while the DI system has the lowest
    diesel fuel discharge and the highest nitrate emissions. Additionally, the DI
    system is responsible for the highest heavy metal emissions from chemical fertilizers.

    methods on various damage categories are presented in Table 8. The human health
    damage category is calculated as 0.22 DALY in DI, 0.24 DALY in SI, and 0.28 DALY
    in FD. The ecosystem damage category is calculated as 0.0001 for each of the three
    irrigation methods. The results show that FI has the highest physical amount of
    resources damage category with 84.18 USD2013 yield, followed by SI with 55.29
    USD2013 yield, and DI with 54.42 USD2013 yield. Fig. 5 presents the contributions
    of different inputs to the damage categories for the three irrigation systems.
    The results indicate that direct emissions and nitrogen fertilizers have the highest
    contributions to the degradation related to environmental parameters in all three
    irrigation types. The analysis of human health reveals that direct emissions account
    for about 95% of the share in all types. The ecosystem category results illustrate
    that direct emissions account for about 95% of the share. Moreover, the shares
    of nitrogen in human health, ecosystems, and resources are about 4%, 10%, and
    50%, respectively. Nitrogen and electricity are the main hotspots of the resource
    damage category in all irrigation methods, as shown in Fig. 5. In a study about
    environmental impacts of irrigated and rain-fed barley production using LCA, results
    indicated irrigated barley production has a greater environmental impact than
    rain-fed barley production, but this impact can be reduced through alternative
    practices such as soil conservation tillage and biomass consumption (Houshyar,
    2017). Table 8. Values of the damage assessment per one ton in malting barley

    environmental impact throughout the life cycle of barley production under various
    irrigation systems in the case study, several conclusions can be drawn. 1. The
    study found that the energy consumption varied significantly among different irrigation
    systems. Sprinkler irrigation was found to be the most energy-efficient system,
    followed by DI and FI. This suggests that adopting sprinkler irrigation can lead
    to significant energy savings in barley production. 2. DI was also found to be
    the most water-efficient system, with the highest water use efficiency. This indicates
    that dropping irrigation can effectively reduce water consumption in barley production
    and help conserve water resources. 3. The study observed that greenhouse gas emissions
    were lower in drip irrigation compared to SI and FI systems. This implies that
    drip irrigation can contribute to mitigating climate change by reducing the release
    of greenhouse gases during barley production. 4. The overall environmental impact,
    including water pollution and soil degradation, was found to be lower in drip
    irrigation compared to other irrigation systems. This suggests that adopting drip
    irrigation can help minimize negative environmental consequences associated with
    barley production. 5. Although the study did not directly assess the economic
    viability of different irrigation systems, the findings indicate that adopting
    drip irrigation can lead to cost savings in terms of energy and water consumption.
    This can potentially improve the economic sustainability of barley production.
    In conclusion, the assessment of energy audit and environmental impact throughout
    the life cycle of barley production under various irrigation systems highlights
    the benefits of adopting drip irrigation. DI not only reduces energy and water
    consumption but also minimizes greenhouse gas emissions and environmental impact.
    These findings support the promotion and adoption of DI as a sustainable irrigation
    practice in barley production. CRediT authorship contribution statement Ali Kaab:

    References Media Tables Share Abstract The Rainwater Harvesting Tool is a publicly
    available web-based geographic information system tool. It was developed using
    geospatial analysis in combination with historic zone improvement plan (ZIP) Code–level
    monthly average precipitation and evapotranspiration data across the US to help
    select potential locations for harvesting rainwater. Rainwater harvesting can
    provide a key alternative water source for a variety of uses, including landscape
    irrigation, vehicle washing, cooling tower make-up, dust suppression, and toilet
    flushing. Rainwater harvesting can help to diversify water sources for institutional,
    commercial, and residential buildings and offset the use of treated potable water.
    This tool aims to help organizations strategically target locations in which to
    implement rainwater harvesting systems. The metric used in the tool is called
    the rainwater harvesting potential, which is a normalized metric. The rainwater
    harvesting potential describes the amount of rainwater that reasonably can be
    collected and stored at a specific location. This metric was used to rank areas
    delineated by ZIP Codes across the US from lowest to highest to show the relative
    availability of rainwater for harvesting. Two mapping layers are included in the
    tool: a layer that shows the general year-round rainwater harvesting potential,
    and a layer that specifically shows the potential for harvesting rainwater to
    supply irrigation water. The Rainwater Harvesting Tool allows users to view the
    overall trends across the US and view the data at a scale at which the ZIP Code
    boundaries are clearly delineated. The tool can be used to help organizations
    with buildings located in multiple regions to strategically identify where to
    install rainwater harvesting systems and prioritize locations that may be optimal
    for rainwater harvesting. Practical Applications The Rainwater Harvesting Tool
    is a web-based geographic information system tool, which is free and available
    to the public. The tool presents the rainwater harvesting potential across the
    US to help determine locations that are potentially good candidates for harvesting
    rainwater and capable of meeting the water demands of institutional, commercial,
    and residential buildings. Rainwater can supply water for irrigation, cooling
    towers, vehicle washing, toilet flushing, and so forth, and offsets the use of
    treated potable water. The tool contains two mapping layers. The first shows the
    general potential for capturing rainwater and indicates the relative ability of
    a given location to collect rainwater throughout the year for beneficial use.
    The second identifies areas with favorable precipitation patterns for collecting
    rainwater during the irrigation season. The Rainwater Harvesting Tool provides
    interactive functions within a single browser session. Users enter specific locations
    (by ZIP Code), and the tool outputs a relative rank of the harvesting potential.
    The amount of rain potentially harvested each month also is provided. This portfolio
    planning, decision support tool can be utilized by organizations to target locations
    that are most conducive for rainwater harvesting across many locations. Introduction
    The growth of the global population is driving a drastic increase in the demand
    for water. Water scarcity, in which the demand for water exceeds the supply, currently
    affects one-third of the global population and is expected to affect half of the
    global population by 2050 (He et al. 2021). According to the World Resources Institute’s
    Aqueduct Country Rankings and Water Risk Atlas, the US has an overall medium-high
    baseline water stress, with areas of particularly high water risk in the West
    and South (WRI 2021). Nearly one-sixth of US river basins are unable to meet societal
    water demands, and population movements to these already stressed areas have made
    the issues even worse (Marston et al. 2020; Fuller and Harhay 2010). Economic
    factors make the current water supply inaccessible to some, and climate change
    makes the use of all available water resources more pertinent (Dolan et al. 2021).
    Such financial limitations to water access can arise from different factors, such
    as political and ethnic conflicts or the relatively low water price paid by irrigators
    compared with the higher prices paid by commercial or residential users (Guarino
    2017). Furthermore, a Pacific Northwest National Laboratory report based on American
    Water Works Association water rate surveys showed that mean water rates in the
    US have been increasing since 2008 (Unger et al. 2023). Because the current availability
    of freshwater is not adequate to meet the increasing global demand for water (resulting
    from growing populations both globally and in the US), there is a need to identify
    and develop alternative methods for harvesting water, which could yield social
    and economic benefits for many areas (Nechifor and Winning 2018). For example,
    the US–Mexico border suffers from sociopolitical issues concerning how the US
    and Mexican governments can share limited resources (Roggenburg et al. 2021).
    Similarly, the states of Florida and Georgia had a decades-long dispute over the
    consumption of water from the Chattahoochee River, culminating in a Supreme Court
    case ruling in 2021 (Mitchell Williams 2021). Sustainable sources of alternative
    water can help bring socioeconomic stability to such regions. Alternative water
    sources are sustainable sources of water, not supplied from fresh surface water
    or groundwater, that potentially can offset the demand for freshwater. Examples
    of alternative water sources include harvested rainwater, greywater, and reclaimed
    wastewater. Rainwater harvesting (RWH) involves capturing, diverting, and storing
    rainwater from rooftops for later use. RWH is suitable for residential, commercial,
    and institutional buildings. The focus of this article is on the use of RWH for
    commercial and institutional buildings. Common uses for rainwater in commercial
    and institutional settings include applications that require nonpotable water,
    such as landscape irrigation, ornamental pond and fountain fillings, make-up water
    for cooling towers, and toilet and urinal flushing. RWH can be used to help offset
    the use of potable water and thereby lower the demand from public supplies. According
    to the EPA, commercial and institutional sector water use represents 17% of the
    total withdrawals from US public water supplies. Irrigation can be a large user
    of water in this sector. For example, the EPA reports that landscape irrigation
    represents 22% of the total water used in office buildings. Hotels consume 16%
    of the total water used in irrigation, and educational facilities use 28% of the
    total in irrigation (EPA 2023). Along with offsetting the consumption of freshwater,
    RWH can help to manage stormwater by reducing the amount of runoff. This eases
    flooding and erosion by allowing the slowed runoff to soak into the ground and
    return to the groundwater table, turning stormwater problems into water supply
    assets. Less runoff also means less contamination of surface water from sediment,
    fertilizers, pesticides, and other pollutants that may be transported with rainfall
    runoff. Alternative water can serve as a vital water supply to institutional and
    commercial buildings in support of water resilience by diversifying water sources.
    RWH systems should be implemented strategically by targeting areas in which there
    is good potential for harvesting rainwater using the rainwater harvesting potential
    (RWHP). This strategic approach is especially important for large enterprise organizations
    that may be able to implement multiple commercial or institutional projects across
    various locations in the US. Because of their larger size, commercial and institutional
    buildings (compared with residential buildings) represent a much larger possible
    source of harvested rainwater. Thus, there is a need for tools that can assist
    in managing a portfolio of possible RWH implementations at multiple commercial
    and institutional buildings. The widespread development of such portfolio management
    tools could lead to easier implementation of commercial RWH projects and, as a
    result, greater use of alternative water. Literature Review The current literature
    presents a range of methods for studying and evaluating the RWHP. However, there
    is a distinct lack of this information being presented in a format that can be
    used for large-scale commercial and institutional portfolio management of multiple
    RWH projects. Previous studies generally used methods that fall into two main
    categories: 1. data analysis, simulation, and modeling; and 2. GIS mapping and
    imaging. The focus and objectives of these studies varied significantly even within
    these categories, but none focused on the strategic adaptation of the results
    to the implementation and management of RWH for multiple buildings across a geographically
    diverse area. This section reviews the overall trends found in the current literature,
    and further details on the specific studies reviewed in this section are presented
    in Table 1. Table 1. Summary of reviewed literature Reference Study type Goal
    or novelty Methods and results Malinowski et al. (2015) Data analysis, simulation,
    or modeling Evaluating the potential reduction of potable water Used rainfall
    data to find the savings potential and estimated that replacing irrigation and
    outdoor water use with RWH in the US would result in as much as a 40% reduction
    in outdoor water use or a water savings of 17,200 mL / day (3.8 billion kWh and
    $270 million in annual savings). Dallman et al. (2021) Data analysis, simulation,
    or modeling Evaluating the potential reduction of potable water Used rainfall
    data in California to find that RWH for outdoor use (especially irrigation) is
    cost-effective, but indoor use is not, because of the extra installation costs
    of pipes, pumps, and filters that are not typical of outdoor-only systems. Leonard
    and Gato-Trinidad (2021) Data analysis, simulation, or modeling Evaluating the
    potential reduction of potable water Used consumption data to examine household
    water use and found average potable water use to be 4.1 L less per person per
    day (3.2%) for properties using RWH ( 126.5 L / person / day ) compared with those
    without ( 130.6 L / person / day ). Semaan et al. (2021) Data analysis, simulation,
    or modeling Evaluate increases in reliability and the resilience of the water
    system Simulations of communal RWH systems in Houston and in Jacksonville, Florida,
    found higher reliability and resilience compared with those of private single-household
    systems and regional supply due to the increased adaptability and storage capacity
    of communal storage. Zheng et al. (2021) Data analysis, simulation, or modeling
    Evaluate increases in reliability and the resilience of the water system Simulations
    of communal RWH systems in Melbourne, Australia found higher reliability and resilience
    compared with those of private single-household systems and regional supply due
    to the increased adaptability and storage capacity of communal storage. Jones
    and Hunt (2010) Data analysis, simulation, or modeling Optimize the design of
    RWH systems Developed a downloadable model using 30 years (1971–2000) of rainfall
    data to design RWH systems (finding the optimum roof area, cistern size, and water
    usage for 208 rain barrels) in North Carolina. The study also monitored water
    levels in RWH systems at three sites: toilets at a nature education center, an
    irrigated landscape, and a car wash station. The results indicated that knowledge
    of the anticipated water use at a location is important for estimating the appropriate
    size of the RWH system. Marchi et al. (2016) Data analysis, simulation, or modeling
    Optimize the design of RWH systems This case study in the north of Adelaide, South
    Australia considered the seasonal variation and future climate change in an approach
    to optimize stormwater harvesting design. Aladenola and Adeboye (2010) Data analysis,
    simulation, or modeling Optimize the design of RWH systems Used rainfall data
    from 1998 along with the roof area and water demand in a spreadsheet to estimate
    the optimal size of a rainwater tank in Nigeria. Imteaz et al. (2012) Data analysis,
    simulation, or modeling Optimize the design of RWH systems Used rainfall data
    from 1998 along with the roof area and water demand in a spreadsheet to estimate
    the optimal size of a rainwater tank in Nigeria. Luo and Li (2021) Data analysis,
    simulation, or modeling Unique simulation method Used detailed data (meteorology,
    soil, elevation, land use, and other data) from humid regions in China to find
    the RWHP in these previously unassessed areas. The results showed the spatial
    and temporal variation of the RWHP and its potential to alleviate agricultural
    drought. Zhang et al. (2014) Data analysis, simulation, or modeling Unique simulation
    method A detailed model capturing the hydrologic processes and the complex physical
    mechanisms of rainfall onto soil was used to assess the RWHP in the Loess Plateau
    in China and its variation over the last 4 decades using daily precipitation and
    temperature data. Mahmoud et al. (2014) Data analysis, simulation, or modeling
    Unique simulation method Evaluated daily rainfall data in Sudan to calculate likelihood
    of rain volumes and the associated amount of runoff to make RWH recommendations
    to manage this excess stormwater. Garg et al. (2022) Data analysis, simulation,
    or modeling Unique simulation method This study performed in India monitored agricultural
    watersheds to develop a rainfall–runoff–soil loss relationship and analyze the
    effects of RWH on the ecosystem. The potential RWH zones across India were determined
    using daily gridded rainfall data, and the developed models were used to identify
    the most appropriate locations to harvest rainwater. Maqsoom et al. (2021) Data
    analysis, simulation, or modeling Unique simulation method A building information
    model with monthly rainfall data was used to simulate a few residential building
    types in a city in Pakistan. The results showed that RWH can meet the water needs
    of up to five individuals within a building in this city. Alataway and El Alfy
    (2019) Data analysis, simulation, or modeling Unique simulation method In Central
    Saudi Arabia, a theoretical water budget approach was validated against water
    level measurements in four reservoirs and then used to show that significant amounts
    of water can be harvested in the reservoirs. Ennenbach et al. (2018) GIS, mapping,
    and imaging Evaluate resource availability compared with demand Spatial analysis
    methods were applied to daily gridded precipitation data in the US in the period
    1979–2014 to generate a county-level map of precipitation, thereafter using a
    weather generator to make a synthetic time series of the precipitation. Grant
    et al. (2018) GIS, mapping, and imaging Evaluate resource availability compared
    with demand In Escambia County, Florida, GIS maps and utility data were used to
    assess the potential reduction in potable water usage by RWH in residential households.
    The results showed that 62% of residential households could harvest more water
    than needed based on monthly medians of rainfall for the years 1950–2014 and water
    utility data for 42,028 households. Lupia et al. (2017) GIS, mapping, and imaging
    Evaluate resource availability compared to demand In Rome, monthly precipitation
    and temperature data were used with satellite images to calculate the rooftop
    area and garden area for evaluating the RWH potential and irrigation requirements.
    The study presents an approach for estimating the extent to which rooftop gardens
    can be self-sufficient in a particular location. Hari et al. (2018) GIS, mapping,
    and imaging Evaluate resource availability compared to demand A study based in
    India reported the use of a Google satellite image to calculate the roof area.
    The average annual rainfall in the area was assumed to be 820 mm, and the RWHP
    was calculated as the product of the rainfall, roof area, and runoff coefficient.
    With annual water demand assumed to be 20 L · day − 1 / person multiplied by the
    population and 365 days, the RWHP was calculated and found to be sufficient to
    meet domestic demands in the area. Yiğit et al. (2020) GIS, mapping, and imaging
    Remote imaging and analysis Mersin University campus in Turkey used drones to
    find potential roofs that can collect rainwater and calculated the areas using
    object-based classification. Thirty years of annual precipitation data and the
    number of green areas on campus were used to calculate the rainwater needs during
    different irrigation periods. The results of the study showed that rain can meet
    up to half the university’s need depending on the frequency of watering. Villar-Navascués
    et al. (2020) GIS, mapping, and imaging Remote imaging and analysis A 30-year
    data set was used in Spain to find the RWHP per capita as the product of the roof
    area, rainfall, runoff coefficient, and monthly precipitation. Supervised classification
    was used to evaluate the spatial distribution of runoff coefficients from different
    roof types. Thereafter, spatial clustering was performed, which revealed a high
    RWHP in low-density urban areas. Al-Ghobari and Dewidar (2021) GIS, mapping, and
    imaging Creation of a geographic map of the RWHP In Saudi Arabia, rainfall, soil,
    land-use, slope, and drainage data were input to GIS software and combined with
    a detailed runoff model to create a map of areas that have a low, medium, or high
    suitability for RWH. NREL (2018) GIS, mapping, and imaging Creation of a geographic
    map of the RWHP The National Renewable Energy Laboratory used GIS software to
    create publicly available maps of solar radiation, wind speeds, hydrogen, geothermal,
    and biomass availability across the US. These maps help inform energy planning
    across the country, but no such tools exist for evaluating the RWHP. Most of the
    reviewed literature used rainfall data for modeling and simulating the RWHP with
    varying levels of calculation complexity. The focus of previous modeling and simulation
    studies varied from water management using simple rainfall data (Malinowski et
    al. 2015) to detailed hydrological simulations (Zheng et al. 2021). Some studies
    focused on evaluating the potential reduction in potable water use as a result
    of using harvested rainwater. Regardless of the size of the system, RWH generally
    replaces potable water use and results in reduced demand on the potable sources
    (Malinowski et al. 2015; Leonard and Gato-Trinidad 2021; Dallman et al. 2021).
    RWH systems can provide benefits beyond a simple reduction in potable water use,
    such as increases in the reliability and resilience of the water system. Simulations
    of communal RWH systems found a higher reliability and resilience compared with
    those of private single-household systems and regional supply due to the increased
    adaptability and storage capacity of communal storage (Semaan et al. 2021; Zheng
    et al. 2021). Some studies also focused on how rainfall data can inform the optimal
    design of RWH systems, but those studies cannot be used easily to evaluate a geographic
    location for RWH suitability (Jones and Hunt 2010; Marchi et al. 2016; Aladenola
    and Adeboye 2010; Imteaz et al. 2012). Many different modeling approaches were
    proposed in the literature to evaluate the RWHP using unique simulation models.
    Those studies largely investigated a single region or location, and did not create
    a geospatial tool that can be used to target the RWHP across a large geographic
    area. Several studies assessed temporal and spatial precipitation data to evaluate
    the variation for a region (Luo and Li 2021; Zhang et al. 2014; Mahmoud et al.
    2014; Garg et al. 2022; Alataway and El Alfy 2019). The unique modeling approaches
    in those studies may be applicable to evaluate the RWHP in other cities and geographic
    areas, but the results are not directly usable by an organization for planning
    RWH projects across a large area. A common analysis method for evaluating the
    RWHP is to use GIS software, mapping tools, and remote sensing for a visual geographical
    representation of various RWH parameters. Some studies evaluated resource availability,
    and some compared this with the estimated demand (Ennenbach et al. 2018; Grant
    et al. 2018; Lupia et al. 2017; Hari et al. 2018). Remote sensing and image analysis
    studies focus on automating the generation of RWH parameters over a large spatial
    area (Yiğit et al. 2020; Villar-Navascués et al. 2020). Some mapping studies are
    intended to provide a reference map for the RWHP across a large geographic region
    (Al-Ghobari and Dewidar 2021). This type of RWHP assessment in a GIS environment
    is a broadly applicable method that can be applied to study other areas of the
    world to identify sites with a high RWHP. However, such static maps do not provide
    the functions required for an organization to check the details of a specific
    area or manage multiple sites in the same way that an interactive tool can enable.
    Similar GIS-based maps exist for other topics (solar radiation, wind speeds, hydrogen,
    geothermal, and biomass availability) across the US (NREL 2018). These maps inform
    energy planning across the country, but no such maps or tools exist for evaluating
    the RWHP in the US. Table 1 provides an overview of the individual studies reviewed
    and discussed in aggregate herein. The key information includes the type of study,
    the goal or novelty, and the methods and results. Any other desired information
    is presented in the provided references. The overall conclusion drawn from this
    literature review is that the current literature does not include significant
    work on multiproject planning or portfolio management tools for commercial organizations.
    There is a limited amount of RWHP mapping in previous studies, and the maps generated
    from these studies are not part of an interactive tool that is intended for use
    by RWH project managers for large organizations. Therefore, a study or methodology
    that is useful to large-scale organizations with multiple possible properties
    and projects will fill this gap in the current literature. Objective of the Present
    Tool Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) created the Rainwater Harvesting
    Tool for the Department of Energy’s Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP).
    The tool is web-based and publicly available. The Rainwater Harvesting Tool is
    a portfolio planning, decision support tool that aims to help organizations to
    strategically target locations that are most conducive for RWH across a large
    number of locations. The tool contains two RWH mapping layers to help identify
    favorable RWH locations in the US. The first layer shows the area-specific general
    potential for RWH. The second layer specifically identifies areas in the US that
    are conducive to storing rainwater for future supplemental irrigation during the
    irrigation season. This paper describes the methods used to build the Rainwater
    Harvesting Tool developed at PNNL. Most other studies evaluated the ability of
    RWH to meet the demand in a particular region based on existing infrastructure.
    The main conclusions of those studies generally were in the context of whether
    RWH can help supplement or replace the water supply for the studied region, and
    usually involved the application of similar methods to evaluate other regions.
    The novelty of many such previously reported studies lies in the remote sensing
    or GIS approach for finding roof areas and spatial variation, the optimization
    of the rain barrel size, or the prediction of demand. The method described here
    uses a monthly rainfall data set in the US to create maps of the RWHP that can
    be used to help strategically identify locations across the US that are conducive
    to RWH. The novelty of this work lies in the use of a GIS to create a tool for
    commercial and institutional portfolio management and the strategic implementation
    of RWH projects across the US. This approach to creating easily interpretable
    evaluations of the RWHP that are usable for large-scale multiproject planning
    was not found in the current literature. This strategic approach should be used
    to support the widespread implementation of RWH. The applicability of this work
    and the resulting tool for institutional and commercial project portfolios rather
    than single building residential projects further distinguish the focus of this
    work from those of many previous studies. In addition, identifying sites for possible
    RWH projects is the overall goal for this tool, which differs from much of the
    existing literature that focused on novel data analysis, modeling and simulation,
    or GIS methods without a focus on how this information should be used in the strategic
    implementation of RWH. Furthermore, the web tool developed in this work is a unique
    publicly available software tool that can be used by any parties interested in
    assessing the RWHP. Methods The Rainwater Harvesting Tool is a GIS-based tool
    with two data layers. The first layer indicates the relative suitability of a
    geographic area for collecting rainwater throughout the year. This measurement
    reveals areas that can consistently collect and store rainwater over the course
    of the year, making RWH generally more conducive. The second mapping layer targets
    irrigation, identifying the relative suitability of a geographic area for collecting
    rainwater during the irrigation season [determined using evapotranspiration (ET)
    data]. A spatial analysis was conducted to create these two mapping layers. The
    primary data required for generating the mapping layers included monthly data
    of US zone improvement plan (ZIP) Code–level precipitation and ET (ET is used
    only in the irrigation layer). Precipitation and ET data from the International
    Water Management Institute (IWMI Climate Atlas 2010) Climate Atlas were used in
    the analysis, which represent 30 years of historical data between 1961 and 1990.
    This data set was provided to PNNL by the EPA in 2010. These and other data sets
    used for the development of the final spatial data layers are listed in Table
    2. Because these data sets are at the monthly and ZIP Code levels, they provided
    the required granularity to create the mapping layers. Current precipitation and
    ET data at the ZIP Code level by month were not available at the time that the
    tool was created. Table 2. Data sets used for development of final spatial data

    Evapotranspiration data were used only in the RWHP for the irrigation mapping
    layer. Year-Round Rainwater Harvesting Potential The first mapping layer of the
    tool was created using a RWHP that indicates the relative potential to collect
    rainwater throughout the year. This section describes the general methods used
    to develop the RWHP and GIS-mapping layer. First, the annual rainfall available
    for harvesting in each ZIP Code was estimated by summing the total precipitation
    during the frost-free months (measured in centimeters). Precipitation during frost–free
    months was used in this application because it is common for rain to be harvested
    only during frost-free months to avoid issues with water freezing in the RWH system.
    Frost-free months were identified using the typical dates for the last frost in
    spring and the first frost in fall. Next, the number of months per year with at
    least 2.5 cm (1 in.) of rainfall, called the storage potential, was determined.
    The storage potential assesses the distribution of rainfall throughout the year,
    which can be stored for use in subsequent months. For example, this measurement
    can reveal areas in the US that can consistently collect and store rainwater in
    many months throughout the year, making RWH generally more conducive. It was determined
    that more than 2.5 cm (1 in.) of rainfall in a month yields a volume of water
    that would provide an adequate minimum of excess water for storage. This determination
    was based on an example wherein storing the precipitation from a 1,300 - m 2 (
    14,000 - ft 2 ) roof with 2.5 cm (1 in.) of rain garnered approximately 28,000
    L (7,375 gal.) for harvesting with an 85% collection efficiency. An office building
    with a roof of this size is a standard-sized US office building (EIA 2015). A
    volume of 28,000 L meets approximately 30% of the typical monthly water use demand
    of an office building, which was determined to be an adequate amount of supplemental
    water to offset potable water. This assumes that the water demand is 49 L (13
    gal.) per person per day (EPA 2012) with an occupancy of 93 people [based on 14
    m 2 ( 150 ft 2 ) per person (ICC 2018)]. Attributes were added to the data set
    to show the total number of frost-free months and the total number of months in
    which rainfall was greater than 2.5 cm (1 in.). Frost-free indicators, which are
    the typical last and first frost dates, were added for each ZIP Code. These values
    were joined with the ZIP Code spatial data using the ArcGIS Desktop 10.3.1 software
    developed by Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc. (ESRI). Two data layers
    were created to show the intersection of the total annual rainfall and storage
    potential in each ZIP Code (Fig. 1). The general RWHP metric was created from
    this overlay. Fig. 1. Annual rainfall for frost-free months, with storage potential
    [number of months with 2.5 cm (1 in.) or more of rainfall] superimposed. The natural
    breaks data partitioning method was used to classify the data into distinct groups
    of the total annual rainfall (Fig. 1). This method classifies a set of data into
    groups with similar values and helps to distinguish these groups. The natural
    breaks method was determined to be appropriate because the US has a wide range
    of climate regions, from arid desert to temperate rainforest. Using the natural
    breaks method for regions in which there is not a wide variety of climates may
    not be the best approach because it may not partition the data into meaningful
    bins. Other data classification methods should be examined to provide better partitioning
    for the total amount of rainfall for these regions in other parts of the world.
    The groups with the two highest amounts of total annual rainfall [72.0–98.3 and
    98.5–380.8 cm (28.3–38.7 and 38.8–146.0 in., respectively)] were combined to form
    a single tier [72.0–380.8 cm (28.3–146.0 in.)] because it was assumed that anything
    over 71.9 cm (28.3 in.) would provide a significant amount of water for use. The
    storage potential layer was divided into groups using a manual interval classification
    method. The middle three groups were divided evenly into 2-month intervals (Months
    7–8, 5–6, and 3–4) of rainfall exceeding 2.5 cm (1 in.), whereas the groups representing
    Months 9–12 and 0–2 were allotted intervals of 4 and 3 months, respectively. These
    two mapping layers then were used to develop a final ranking of the RWHP from
    highest to lowest. Regions in which the total annual rainfall was greater than
    71.9 cm (28.3 in.) and the storage potential was 9–12 months were ranked as having
    the highest RWHP. Regions in which the total annual rainfall was between 57.3
    cm and 71.9 cm (22.6–28.3 in.) for a storage potential of greater than 6 months
    or the total annual rainfall was greater than 71.9 cm (28.3 in.) for a storage
    potential of less than 9 months were ranked as having a high RWHP. These two distinct
    categories make up the high tier because areas with ample rain but a storage potential
    of 6–9 months were not deemed to be optimal for the highest RWHP tier. The medium-high,
    medium, low, and lowest rankings were binned based only on the rainfall data layer,
    and not the storage potential data layer. This was because the vast majority of
    these areas have a storage potential of less than 9 months, which was considered
    to be less attractive for RWH. Table 3 lists the details of the ranks that were
    used to create a map showing the areas that are most conducive for RWH. Table

    rainfall and storage potential, making harvesting optimal Rainwater Harvesting
    Potential for Irrigation The second mapping layer shows the areas in the US that
    have sufficient rainfall preceding the times of highest irrigation requirement
    (using monthly ET data), which can be collected to offset the use of potable water
    specifically for irrigation. The RWHP for irrigation was determined by collecting
    data on the period of surplus rainwater availability that can be stored by a RWH
    system for use in the following months when there is a need for supplemental irrigation
    during the irrigation season. This analysis combined monthly precipitation with
    ET rates for each ZIP Code to determine the times when a surplus of rainfall is
    available for storage by a RWH system. ET represents the total amount of water
    that a plant requires to stay healthy, which includes the total amount of water
    lost to the atmosphere due to evaporation (e.g., water loss from the soil) and
    plant transpiration (water loss from the plant itself). Some factors that can
    affect ET are solar radiation, the air temperature, the air humidity, and wind.
    The following steps were used to develop the RWHP for irrigation: 1. The 30-year
    historical average monthly data for precipitation and the reference ET (ETo) categorized
    by ZIP Code for frost-free months were collected. The ETo is the ET rate of a
    hypothetical reference crop that is an actively growing, well-watered plant of
    uniform height. 2. The ET for cool season turf for each ZIP Code, using alfalfa
    as the ETo plant (FAO 1998), was determined. To determine the ET for cool season
    turf grass, the ETo was multiplied by the plant coefficient for cool season turf,
    0.8. Cool season grass was selected, assuming that it is prevalent in commercial
    landscaping. 3. The monthly ET was subtracted from the monthly rainfall to determine
    the supplemental irrigation required for each frost-free month. Negative values
    represent the total amount of supplemental irrigation required for the given turf
    landscape (negative numbers indicate that the amount of rainfall does not meet
    the turf’s water requirements). Positive numbers indicate that the amount of rainfall
    exceeds the turf’s water requirements, which approximates the amount of water
    that may be applied in the current month or stored for a future time. Supplemental
    irrigation is the amount of water in addition to natural rainfall water is needed
    by the grass to maintain its health. 4. The supplemental irrigation required for
    all frost-free months was added to estimate the total amount of irrigation required
    for the irrigation season. 5. The number of months in which the amount of monthly
    rainfall exceeds the monthly ET, called months with positive rainfall, was determined.
    This provides an approximate measure of the number of months in which surplus
    rainfall can be stored by a RWH system. The stored rainfall potentially could
    be used the following month to supply future irrigation needs. This variable is
    not meant to represent an exact amount of water stored, but rather gives a rough
    estimate of the potential to store and supply water for future irrigation needs.
    6. The total supplemental irrigation required (Step 4) was mapped with ArcGIS
    using the natural breaks method to form natural groups (Fig. 2). Commensurate
    with the mapping layer for year-round RWH described previously, the natural breaks
    method was determined to be an appropriate approach because the US has a wide
    range of climatic regions, from arid desert to temperate rainforest. 7. The months
    with positive rainfall (Step 5) was superimposed on a map plotting the total supplemental
    irrigation required (Step 6) to reveal the regions in the US that may have additional
    rainwater available for future irrigation via storage by the RWH system (Fig.
    2). 8. The RWHP for irrigation was ranked from lowest to highest based on the
    level of surplus water available for storage and irrigation needs. Table 4 provides
    the scale used for the ranking. Fig. 2. Rainfall minus evapotranspiration for
    frost-free months, with total number of positive months of rainfall overlaid.

    Rainwater Harvesting Tool The mapping layers described in the previous sections
    were used to create the Rainwater Water Harvesting Tool with a goal of providing
    an accessible and easy to understand format that allows users to ascertain the
    RWHP of specific locations across the US. The tool can be used to manage a large
    portfolio of multiple commercial RWH projects. To this end, the Rainwater Harvesting
    Tool was created using ESRI’s ArcGIS Online software (AGOL). This platform was
    chosen as the development environment for the tool because it allowed for the
    quick development of an interactive web application, provided most of the necessary
    tools for that development without need for a stand-alone server, and encompassed
    the need for a spatial data web environment. The two spatial data layers (RWHP,
    and RWHP for irrigation) were reviewed and loaded into a geodatabase using ESRI’s
    ArcGIS Pro version 2.8. The geodatabase was uploaded to AGOL’s cloud service and
    imported into a web map on which the data could be visualized. Pop-up informational
    windows were customized for appropriate interpretation of the data during user
    interaction, and include a simple chart showing the average monthly rainfall in
    addition to the basic ZIP Code attribute information. ArcGIS Web AppBuilder was
    used to create a new application to act as a container for the web map and provide
    most of the interactive elements for the user. The final step in application development
    was to move the interactive web application into a dashboard-style container to
    include a slide-out informational widget without having to code it from scratch
    inside the web application. Results and Discussion The final static maps visualize
    the results of the overlay analysis for year-round RWH and RWH conducive for supplementing
    irrigation during the irrigation season (Figs. 3 and 4, respectively). The maps
    provide a ZIP Code–level, accurate view of the areas of relative feasibility for
    harvesting rainwater and harvesting rainwater for irrigation purposes. Fig. 3.
    Final visualization of year-round rainwater harvesting potential. Fig. 4. Final
    map of rainwater harvesting potential for irrigation. Although ZIP Codes were
    used to create the maps, the boundaries are not shown in the static maps because
    they added no additional information. The evolution of the static maps to provide
    more specific information to the user led to the interactive Rainwater Harvesting
    Tool. The Rainwater Harvesting Tool (Fig. 5) allows the user to view the overall
    trends across the US while also allowing the user to zoom in to a scale at which
    the ZIP Code boundaries are clearly delineated. Additionally, the user can select
    a ZIP Code zone in the map tool, and a pop-up window in the map provides specific
    information about the monthly rainfall during frost-free months for that specific
    ZIP Code (Fig. 6). Fig. 5. Rainwater Harvesting Tool screen capture showing rainwater
    harvesting potential for all states in the US; darker green indicates higher potential.

    map © Esri, TomTom, Garmin, FAO, NOAA, USGS, EPA, USFWS.) The Rainwater Harvesting
    Tool provides interactive functions for users in a single interactive browser
    instance. The widgets included in the tool allow the user to access specific ZIP
    Code data necessary to estimate the collection potential, download selected data,
    and perform location searches. The widgets form a tool set that allows the user
    to investigate the RWHP at a single site or multiple sites using simple actions
    that most users will recognize from other interactive web mapping applications.
    The Rainwater Harvesting Tool can be used to help an organization with buildings
    in multiple regions strategically identify where to install RWH systems. The tool
    results can help to prioritize locations that may be optimal for RWH projects.
    An organization can determine potential locations for RWH projects, estimate the
    amount of water needed, and then map its building inventory over the appropriate
    RWHP map. A list of suitable sites can be developed to prioritize the sites with
    the best potential for implementing RWH projects. The Rainwater Harvesting Tool
    also can be used to estimate the volume of rainfall that can be collected from
    roofs or hard surfaces. The following calculation is used to estimate the volume
    of rainwater available for harvesting: Monthly rainfall collected ( L ) = catchment
    area ( m 2 ) × monthly rainfall ( cm ) × collection efficiency × 10 ( L · cm −
    1 m − 2 ) where • Catchment area is the size of the roof or hard surface where
    rainfall will be collected. • Monthly rainfall is the number of centimeters of
    rainfall for the month (obtained from the Rainwater Harvesting Tool). • Collection
    efficiency is a factor applied to the total monthly harvesting potential to account
    for losses in the system. A typical system efficiency is between 0.75 and 0.9
    (Texas Water Development Board 2005), depending on how efficiently the RWH system
    collects rainfall, which is driven primarily by the water lost from various parts
    of the RWH process. These include roof collection (the type of material impacts
    losses, e.g., a rough surface equals more water lost), first flush, evaporation,
    spillage from gutters, and leaks in the system. • The conversion factor of 10
    converts the volume of rainfall (in centimeters per square meters of area) to
    liters. The three test locations in Fig. 7 (Seattle; Salt Lake City; and Tallahassee,
    Florida) were selected to represent different regions around the US to demonstrate
    the above outlined application of the Rainwater Harvesting Tool and the application
    of the tool to the RWHP for irrigation. A catchment area of 1,300 m 2 ( ∼ 14,000
    ft 2 ) was used to represent a typical commercial building roof footprint. A magnified
    view of each of the sites and their RWHP data are shown in Fig. 8. Fig. 7. Screenshot
    of Rainwater Harvesting Tool with test cities marked. (Base map © Esri, TomTom,
    Garmin, FAO, NOAA, USGS, EPA, USFWS.) Fig. 8. Screenshots of test locations and
    data from the Rainwater Harvesting Tool. The area within the light blue border
    on each map is the test location. The scale is shown in the lower left of each
    screen. The tables display monthly and annual precipitation data (for rainwater
    harvesting potential) and precipitation minus rainwater harvesting (for RWHP for
    irrigation), as well as ranking. In a situation in which a planner needs to choose
    a site for a new facility based on the RWHP alone, the planner might propose that
    the best location for a new RWH facility would be near Tallahassee (Table 5).
    This test scenario also could help to prioritize improvements across existing
    facilities: the facility in Seattle should be prioritized for RWH over a facility
    in Salt Lake City, where a RWH system might not be as effective. Examining these
    locations to assess the feasibility of RWH for irrigation purposes produced similar
    results, whereby Tallahassee had a higher potential for storing water for future
    irrigation needs. Table 5. Summary of test case results from site comparison using

    available tool is not limited to institutional or commercial entities. Residential
    users interested in RWH can quickly evaluate if the climate and rainfall in their
    area is conducive to RWH. Conclusion The approach used to develop the maps can
    be applied to rainfall data sets outside the US in which there is a similar wide
    range of climate types. The goal of showing the RWHP over large geographic areas
    (on a national scale) has not been studied in detail, because the current literature
    has more local case studies or citywide mapping. A large-scale portfolio management
    approach that can used for multiple commercial and institutional properties is
    a more broadly applicable first step than local case studies for organizations
    implementing RWH projects across a wide geographic distance. After this first
    step of site identification, local case studies can be a useful and detailed tool
    for evaluating or designing specific RWH projects and systems on a case-by-case
    basis. For organizations with large portfolios of properties and possible RWH
    projects, tools such as the one presented in this work can continue to function
    as an overall high-level management tool, whereas local studies are used for individual
    projects. The use of ET data and monthly variation to determine the RWHP categories
    for irrigation is another aspect of this approach that can be applied to other
    data sets. Although annual rainfall data and hydrological modeling can show the
    high-level potential for RWH, a real site may need consistent rainfall throughout
    a year to fully realize the benefits. The data used to develop the maps have limitations.
    Daily precipitation is best for determining how much rainfall is available for
    harvesting. The maps developed in this study were based on the historical monthly
    average rainfall, which does not account for daily, monthly, or yearly variations
    such as large rain events or rainy periods or years or dry times or years. For
    example, if all rain falls at the beginning of the month, there may not be enough
    harvested rainwater for irrigation at the end of the month. This issue often is
    addressed through proper RWH system sizing to ensure a sufficient storage capacity.
    However, the Rainwater Harvesting Tool does not provide daily data that can be
    used for these capacity calculations. Thus, the feasibility of a RWH project may
    depend on the system design, and the suitability of an area for a particular project
    may change after further analysis. However, the Rainwater Harvesting Tool can
    provide a starting point for this analysis. The next steps in this work include
    the incorporation of state regulations for RWH. With no federal law regarding
    RWH, it is up to individual states to decide what regulations apply to RWH. Some
    states do not have specific regulations about RWH, whereas some states have regulations
    on RWH within plumbing codes. Moreover, some states offer incentives of varying
    magnitudes for implementing RWH. Maps of regulations across the US already have
    been created and are publicly available online. Incorporating a layer of these
    regulations, incentives, and technical resources on RWH for each state into the
    online Rainwater Harvesting Tool will further increase the applicability of the
    tool’s results. Organizations can determine where RWH is regulated and supported,
    and which areas have good potential for harvesting rainwater. A list of suitable
    sites can be developed to prioritize the sites with the best potential for implementing
    RWH projects. Data Availability Statement Data (US ZIP Code–level precipitation

  description: Pathogenic microorganisms can cause infection, sepsis, and other diseases
    in humans. Although municipal wastewater plants are important sources and sinks
    for potential pathogenic microorganisms, data on rural wastewater treatment processes
    are limited. The proximity of rural wastewater facilities to human settlements
    and the trend toward wastewater resourcing could pose risks to humans. Here, a
    typical village in southern China was selected to analyze potential pathogenic
    microorganisms in wastewater, sewage sludge, and aerosols during the collection,
    treatment, and discharge of domestic wastewater. The succession characteristics
    and concentration variations of potential pathogenic microorganisms throughout
    the wastewater treatment process were identified using high-throughput sequencing
    and culture methods. Bacteria-associated health risks in facility aerosols were
    estimated based on average daily dose rates from inhalation and dermal exposure.
    Lower amounts of pathogenic bacteria and pathogenic fungi were detected in the
    effluent of the 1-ton treatment scale and the 10-ton treatment scale facilities,
    compared to those in the influent. Pathogen effluent concentrations were significantly
    lower than influent concentrations after treatment in rural wastewater facilities.
    16 and 29 potential pathogenic bacteria and fungi were detected in aerosols from
    wastewater treatment facilities, respectively. Furthermore, the potential pathogen
    concentrations were higher than those in the background air. Aerobic units are
    the main source of pathogen emissions from aerosols. There were 42 potential pathogenic
    bacteria and 34 potential pathogenic fungi in the sewage sludge. Biochemical units
    were the main source of potential pathogens in sewage sludge, and more potential
    airborne pathogens originated from wastewater. In rural wastewater resourcing
    processes with greater pollutant exposure, the effluent of rural wastewater treatment
    facilities (WWTFs), downstream rivers, and facility aerosols, could be important
    potential sources of microbial risk. Inhalation is the main pathway of human exposure
    to airborne bacteria. Therefore, more attention should be focused on microbiological
    risk in rural wastewater treatment processes.

    Rural wastewaterBioaerosolsSewage sludgePotential pathogensExposure risk 1. Introduction
    Approximately 510 million people live in rural areas of China by 2021, representing
    36.11 % of China''s total population (Xing et al., 2022). In 2022, about 34 billion
    tons of sewage were discharged in China''s rural areas. With the implementation
    of China''s rural revitalization policy, the rural sewage treatment rate has exceeded
    20 % (Sheng et al., 2020). Rural domestic wastewater is characterized by its dispersion
    and the instability of wastewater quality and quantity, being unsuitable for centralized
    treatment (Huang et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023). The wastewater from rural households
    is usually collected by simple pipelines and flows into decentralized sewage treatment
    facilities next to the farmers’ residence, and the effluent is discharged directly
    into the nearby waters, which is the common wastewater treatment model in rural
    areas. In response to China''s dual-carbon policy, the on-site requirements for
    sewage resourcing have increased. Currently, some simple ecological wastewater
    treatment systems are commonly used for decentralized treatment of domestic wastewater
    from rural households in Europe, the United States and other developed countries,
    without the disinfection if there are no special water requirements (Otter et
    al., 2020). In China, the disinfection of rural wastewater is not yet mandated
    by current regulations, thus rural wastewater is often discharged without disinfection.
    Consequently, the short collection process, relatively simple treatment methods,
    treatment facilities in close proximity to living quarters, often without disinfection
    and on-site discharge and resourcing may increase the risk of microbial exposure
    to residents from the rural wastewater treatment process. Many pathogenic microorganisms
    are present in wastewater (Wéry et al., 2008; Zheng et al., 2020). Escherichia
    coli, Enterococcus, and Pseudomonas, etc. among bacteria, Aspergillus fumigatus,
    and Candida, etc. among fungi, norovirus, sapovirus, and enteric adenovirus, etc.
    among viruses, are common pathogenic microorganisms in wastewater that can cause
    diarrhea, respiratory system diseases, infections of the upper respiratory tract,
    and gastrointestinal diseases in humans under certain conditions (Greer et al.,
    2009; Levantesi et al., 2012; Millner et al., 1977; Shingare et al., 2019; Zheng
    et al., 2020). Some pathogenic bacteria and viruses have been found in several
    units of WWTPs (Lv et al., 2006; Osuolale and Okoh 2017; Wen et al., 2009). Furthermore,
    a certain amount of pathogenic or potential pathogenic microorganisms have been
    detected in aerosols of urban WWTPs (Han et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2019a). Some
    potential pathogenic bacteria such as Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, and Streptomyces
    have been widely reported in aerosols of urban WWTPs (Uhrbrand et al., 2017; Yang
    et al., 2019a; Yang et al., 2019b). Yang et al (2019c) showed that several pathogenic
    microorganisms were found in WWTP aerosols at a concentration of 71–2566 CFU/m3.
    Sewage sludge also contains several pathogenic microorganisms (Romdhana et al.,
    2009; Suarez et al., 2023; Zhan et al., 2022). Bacteria, such as E. coli with
    concentrations as high as 4–6 log MPN/g dry matter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa with
    around 2.2 × 108 copies/g, and Salmonella with concentrations of 102–104 MPN/100
    mL, respectively, have been reported in the sewage sludge of WWTPs (Gantzer et
    al., 2001; Guzmán et al., 2007; Wéry et al., 2008; Zhan et al., 2022). Domestic
    wastewater with rich nutrients provides brilliant living conditions for potential
    pathogens (Kristian Stevik et al 2004; Ribeirinho-Soares et al., 2022). Pathogenic
    microorganisms in rural wastewater treatment processes may pose a greater risk
    to human health and the surrounding environment due to the requirements for sewage
    and sludge resources, simpler treatment processes, presence of pathogenic microorganisms,
    and proximity to villagers. However, basic data on pathogenic microorganisms in
    rural wastewater treatment processes are lacking and the consequential risks are
    unclear. Therefore, in this study, a typical village in southern China was selected
    to investigate the characteristics, concentrations, sources, and risks posed by
    potential pathogenic bacteria and fungi in wastewater, sewage sludge, and aerosols
    during the collection, treatment, and discharge of rural domestic wastewater.
    Five common and potential harmful pathogenic microorganisms (total bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae,
    Pseudomonas aeruginosa, fecal coliforms, and potential pathogenic fungi) were
    selected for incubation to characterize changes in the concentrations of potential
    pathogenic microorganisms in wastewater and bioaerosols during wastewater treatment.
    The primary objectives of our research included: 1) Determining the potential
    pathogens genera and the specific pathogens concentration; 2) Analyzing the sources
    of pathogens present in aerosols and sewage sludge; 3) Assessing the microbiological
    risk associated with effluent and the exposure risk to airborne bacteria in treatment
    facilities. This study aims to provide a theoretical basis and scientific data
    on the level, impact, control of microbial risks and the establishment of methods
    to block the spread of pathogenic microorganisms in the rural wastewater treatment
    process. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study area This study was conducted in
    a village in Shanghai, China (Fig. 1). The study area is typical of rural areas
    in southern China, with a well-developed water supply and wastewater network,
    as well as well-operated and well-maintained wastewater treatment facilities (WWTFs).
    There are 18 decentralized and integrated WWTFs buried underground, enclosed,
    regularly maintained, and cleaned of sewage sludge every 6 months. Sewage sludge
    was collected and transported out of the villages by sludge trucks for centralized
    treatment. Fig. 1 illustrates the service area and distribution of the WWTFs;
    they are considerably close to residential areas, approximately 2–15 m from residential
    houses. Among these WWTFs, 14 (number 1–14) were designed for a scale of 1 t to
    serve an average of 3–7 households, and (number 15–18) were designed for a scale
    of 10 t to serve 40–50 households. The influent of all facilities primarily consisted
    of domestic sewage with no industrial wastewater, treated using conventional anoxic
    and aerobic (AO) processes, characteristic of rural China. The treated effluent
    was discharged directly into a nearby river without disinfection and used as potential
    agricultural irrigation water. Download : Download high-res image (765KB) Download

    from two WWTFs with different capacities in Autumn (October, 2021): WWTF-1t (number
    14 in Fig. 1) with a 1 t capacity, treating domestic wastewater from six households
    and WWTF-10t (number 16 in Fig. 1) with a 10 t capacity, treating domestic wastewater
    from 43 households. Twelve water sampling points (including one upstream of the
    river), two sludge sampling points, and four air sampling points (including one
    ambient air sampling point) were established in the wastewater treatment area
    (Fig. 2). Download : Download high-res image (121KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. The distributions of the sampling sites. Water samples were collected
    from the inlet pipe, facility influent, anaerobic unit, aerobic unit, facility
    effluent, upstream and downstream of the river. Additionally, sludge samples were
    collected from mixed sewage sludge at the bottom of the facility. All samples
    were collected in sterile bottles, transported to the laboratory on ice, and stored
    at −20 ℃ until further analysis. Air samples were collected from farmers'' toilets,
    inlet pipe maintenance points, anaerobic units, aerobic units, and upwind. The
    total suspended particle (TSP) samples were collected using a medium-flow sampler
    (TH-150, Tianhong, Wuhan, China) fitted with quartz membranes (90 mm, Whatman
    QM-A). Before sampling, the membranes were heated in a muffle furnace at 500 ℃
    for 4.5 h to remove organic compounds and the membrane holders were cleaned with
    75 % ethanol before sampling (Yang et al., 2019a). Medium-flow samplers were used
    to collect the TSP samples continuously for 8 h at a constant flow rate of 100
    L/min and 1.5 m above the ground (the average height of human breathing) (Mainelis
    et al., 2005). After sampling, the membranes were removed from the samplers and
    stored in a sterile environment at −20 ℃ until further analysis. A six-stage Andersen
    Cascade Impactor with 400 holes in each sieve plate (228–9530 K, SKC Gulf Coast,
    Inc. USA) was used to collect culturable bioaerosols at a flow rate of 28.3 L/min
    over 3 min. The aerodynamic cut-size diameters from stage 1 to 6 are >7.00, 4.70–7.00,
    3.30–4.70, 2.10–3.30, 1.10–2.10, and 0.65–1.10 μm (Andersen 1958). Aerosol particles
    with an aerodynamic diameter of < 3.30 μm are defined as respirable fragments
    (RFs) (Uhrbrand et al., 2017). The sampler was sterilized with 75 % ethanol after
    each sampling. Two parallel samples were collected at each point. To measure bacterial
    bioaerosols, nutrient agar plates were incubated at 37 ± 1 ℃ for 48 h after sampling
    (Li et al., 2013). The culturable fungal bioaerosols were incubated at 37 °C for
    48 h after sampling on Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) plates (Scognamiglio et al.,
    2010). MacConkey agar was used to sample Enterobacteriaceae in bioaerosols, the
    sampled Enterobacteriaceae were incubated at 30–35 °C for 24 h, Pseudomonas CN
    agar was used for Pseudomonas aeruginosa that were incubated at 36 ± 1℃ for 48
    h (Brandi et al., 2000). MFC agar was used to culture fecal coliform at 44.5 ℃
    for 24 h (Maheux et al., 2011). The number of colonies counted after incubation
    was used to determine the concentration of culturable bioaerosols, expressed as
    colony-forming units per unit volume (CFU/m3). During air sampling, temperature
    and relative humidity were measured using a dew-point thermohygrometer (WD-35612,
    OAKTON, Germany). Wind speed was measured using a portable anemometer (HD2303,
    Delta OHM, Italy). Solar radiation was measured using an irradiance meter (HD2302.0,
    Delta OHM, Italy). The meteorological conditions recorded at each sampling point
    are presented in Table S1. 2.3. Analytical methods 2.3.1. Microbial analysis The
    microbial communities in airborne, wastewater, and sludge samples were analyzed
    using Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing. The microorganisms in aerosol
    and wastewater/sludge were enriched by PES membrane disc filter and using the
    Power Soil® DNA Isolation Kit (MoBIo, Carlsbad, USA). The V3 and V4 regions of
    bacterial 16S rRNA were amplified by PCR using primers 338F and 806R. The ITS1
    and ITS4 regions of fungal 18S rRNA were amplified by PCR using primers ITS1 and
    ITS4. The PCR conditions and procedures were as described by Yang et al. (2019a).
    The PCR products were pooled, purified using the Axyprep DNA Gel Extraction Kit
    (Axygen Biosciences, Union City, CA, USA), and quantified using QuantiFluor™-ST
    (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA) (Han et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018). High-throughput
    sequencing was conducted by the Illumina MiSeq platform (Majorbio, Shanghai, China).
    Raw sequencing reads were de-multiplexed and filtered using QIIME (version 1.9.1).
    Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were clustered by UPARSE (version 7.1, http://drive5.com/uparse/)
    with 97 % similarity (Edgar, 2013). 2.3.2. Chemical analysis The physicochemical
    properties of the water samples are described in Fig. S1. The pH of the water
    phase was determined through a pH meter with a glass electrode (INESA, China).
    The suspended substance (SS) was measured by filtering the water samples through
    a microfiltration membrane and drying to a constant weight at 105 °C. The COD,
    TN, NH3N, and TP were determined using the Hach method with a spectrophotometer
    (HACH DR 2800, HACH, Loveland, CO, USA), and specific testing steps are shown
    in Table S2. 2.4. Exposure risk assessment The exposure rates and risk assessment
    of airborne bacteria were estimated based on US EPA guidelines (USEPA, 1999).
    The ADD through inhalation and skin (ADDinhalation, ADDdermal) can be calculated
    using Eqs. (1) and (2). (1) (2) Where ADDinhalation and ADDskin represent the
    average daily doses of exposure by inhalation and skin contact [CFU/(kg.d)], respectively;
    C indicates the airborne bacterial concentration (CFU/m3); IR is the inhalation
    rate (m3/d); EF is the exposure frequency (d/yr); EDinhalation and EDskin refer
    to the contact time through inhalation and skin contact (yr), respectively; SA
    is the surface area of skin contact (m2); ABS is the dermal absorption factor
    (m/h), ABS = 0.001 for bacteria; AF is the skin adherence factor; BW is the body
    weight (kg); and AT is the average lifetime (d). Airborne bacteria are noncarcinogenic,
    and the noncancer risks of exposure through inhalation and skin contact were assessed
    using Eqs. (3) and (4). (3) (4) Where HQ is the hazard quotient and HI is the
    hazard index, representing the sum of the risks of each contaminant from multiple
    exposure pathways. RfD is the reference dose [CFU/(kg.d)], representing the maximum
    acceptable daily dose of a substance. And the reference dose of 500 CFU/m3 was
    used according to the recommendations of the Bioaerosols Committee of the American
    Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), which suggests that
    the concentration of cultivable bacterial exposure should not exceed 500 CFU/m3
    on a working day (Yang et al., 2019b). HQ < 1 or HI < 1 indicates that risks can
    be ignored, whereas HQ > 1 or HI > 1 indicates that potential adverse health risks
    are a concern (Chen and Carter, 2017). All parameters in Eqs. (1) and (2) are
    summarized in Table S3. 2.5. Statistical analysis Changes in the concentrations
    of potential pathogenic microorganisms in wastewater and aerosols were mapped
    using Origin 2019b. The heatmap was used to show the distribution characteristics
    of potential pathogenic microorganisms in wastewater, sewage sludge, and aerosols.
    The similarity and spatial distribution of potential pathogenic microorganisms
    were analyzed using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). SourceTracker (https://github.com/danknights/sourcetracker)
    was used to track microbial sources based on a Bayesian algorithm (Wang et al.,
    2017). Heatmaps, PCoA, and SourceTracker analyses were conducted using R Studio
    4.0. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Potential pathogenic microorganisms succession
    in the wastewater treatment process 3.1.1. Potential pathogenic microorganisms
    in wastewater and sewage sludge during the wastewater treatment process The bacteria
    collected from AnaU-10t had the highest species richness (Table S4), whereas the
    highest species richness of fungal genera (Table S4) was in Eff-10t. The PCoA
    (Fig. 8a, b) indicated a distinct variation in the bacterial and fungal communities
    in wastewater/sludge observed in WWTF-1t and WWTF-10t. Trichococcus and Enterococcus
    were the dominant bacterial genera in Inf-1t and Inf-10t, respectively (Fig. 3a).
    Thiothrix and Limnohabitans were the key bacterial genera in Eff-1t and Eff-10t,
    respectively. The predominant bacterial genera were Acinetobacter and Streptococcus
    at IP-1t and IP-10t, respectively, Thiothrix and C39 at AnaU-1t and AnaU-10t,
    Thiothrix and Flavobacterium at AerU-1t and AerU-10t, Flavobacterium at the river

    full-size image Fig. 3. Top 25 bacterial and fungal genera and potential pathogenic
    and bacterial fungal genera in all sampling sites. (a): Top 25 of bacterial genera;
    (b): Top 25 of fungal general; (c): Potential pathogenic bacterial genera; (d):
    Potential pathogenic fungal genera. Cladosporium and Cutaneotrichosporon were
    the dominant fungal genera in Inf-1t and Inf-10t, respectively; unclassified_p_Rozellomycota
    and unclassified_k_Fungi were the key fungal genera in Eff-1t and Eff-10t, respectively.
    The main fungal genera were unclassified_k_Fungi and unclassified_p_Rozellomycota
    at IP-1t and IP-10t, respectively, unclassified_p_Rozellomycota at AnaU-1t and
    AerU-1t. Didymella in RU and unclassified_k_Fungi in AerU-10t, AnaU-10t, RD, SS-1t,
    and SS-10t. Hence, a change in the dominant wastewater bacterial and fungal genera
    occurred across units, suggesting microbial succession throughout the wastewater
    treatment process. A comparison with the pathogen database revealed 66 and 45
    potential pathogenic bacteria and fungi in wastewater and, 42 and 34 in sewage
    sludge (Fig. 3c, d) (Woolhouse et al., 2012). Furthermore, 52 potential pathogenic
    bacteria with a total relative abundance of 2.96 % and 35 potential pathogenic
    fungi with a total relative abundance of 5.62 % were detected in the effluent,
    exceeding that in the upstream and downstream. Potential pathogens in wastewater
    also undergo succession during the process, potentially due to the different adaptabilities
    and nutritional competitiveness of pathogens to various treatment units. The dominant
    potential pathogenic bacteria in wastewater were Bacteroides at Inf-1t, Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1
    at Eff-1t, Enterococcus at Inf-10t, Leptospira at Eff-10t, Acinetobacter at IP-1tand
    RD, Pseudomonas at AnaU-1t and AerU-1t, Streptococcus at IP-10t, Mycobacterium
    at SS-1t and SS-10t, RU. The predominant bacterial genera in AnaU-10t and AerU-10t
    were Leptospira (relative abundances: 1.65 % and 1.70 %, respectively). While
    some studies found Arcobacter, Streptococcus, Clostridium, Salmonella, and Yersinia
    were mainly present at the influent of WWTPs, Aeromonas, Vibrio Arcobacter, and
    Streptococcus were predominant pathogens in effluent of WWTPs, Enterococcus and
    Bacteroides dominated sewage sludge from WWTPs, of which predominant pathogenic
    bacteria was different from that in WWTFs (Huang et al., 2020; Kristensen et al.,
    2020; Wardi et al., 2023). Cladosporium and Trichoderma were the major pathogenic
    fungi in Inf-1t and Eff-1t, respectively, and Trichoderma and Engyodontium in
    Inf-10t and Eff-10t, respectively. Cladosporium predominated at AnaU-1t, AnaU-10t,
    AerU-10t and RU, Trichoderma at AerU-1t, RD and SS-10t, Scedosporium at IP-1t,
    Alternaria at SS-1t, Rhodotorula at IP-10t, respectively, of which dominant genera
    in the wastewater treatment process was more stable compared to pathogenic bacteria.
    While Olpidium and Paecilomyces have been identified as key pathogenic fungal
    genera in WWTP sewage, which was inconsistent with the findings of rural wastewater
    treatment facilities (Assress et al., 2019). 3.1.2. Potential pathogenic microorganisms
    in the bioaerosol The Chao index of bacteria in bioaerosols at each sampling site
    ranged from 22.50 to 64.75, lower than wastewater and sewage sludge, with the
    highest index observed at sampling site Bio-10t (Table S4). The Chao index of
    fungi in bioaerosols at each sampling site ranged between 76.00 and 302.50, with
    some higher than those in the wastewater units. The highest fungi Chao index was
    also observed at the Bio-10t sampling site, potentially due to the greater number
    of fungi in WWTF-10t, treating domestic wastewater generated by more farmers.
    The bacterial communities of Bio-1t and Bio-10t were similar, while the fungal
    communities were in variation (Fig. 8a, b). The dominant bacterial and fungal
    genera were Denitratisoma and unclassified_f_Didymellaceae at Bio-1t (Fig. 3).
    The predominant genera in the Bio-10t aerosols were Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1
    and Cladosporium. Clostridium_sensu_stricto_12 and Aspergillus were the dominant
    genera in the farmer''s toilet (FH). The pathogen database revealed potential
    pathogenic bacterial (n = 16) and fungal (n = 29) genera in the air samples (Woolhouse
    et al., 2012). The most potential pathogenic bacterial genera (n = 12) were detected
    at Bio-10t (total abundance: 49.53 %), followed by Bio-1t, and BGG. The most potential
    pathogenic fungal genera (n = 22) were also detected at Bio-10t (total abundance:
    80.84 %), followed by Bio-1t, and BGG. This suggests that sufficient potential
    pathogens escape from WWTFs with more detected in larger facilities due to more
    aeration (Wang et al., 2019). Potential pathogens, such as Enterococcus, Acinetobacter,
    Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, etc., were identified in the air samples. It demonstrates
    that various pathogens dominated at different sampling sites, which may be due
    to the different compositions of the microbial community in the wastewater and
    surrounding air. The dominant potential pathogenic bacterial genera in the aerosols
    were Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 at Bio-10t and FH, Corynebacterium at BBG, and
    Ralstonia at Bio-1t. Some studies have reported that in WWTPs, Mycobacterium and
    Bacillus were the dominant pathogens at aeration unit and anaerobic unit of A/A/O
    process, Staphylococcus was predominant potential pathogen at sequencing batch
    reactor (SBR), Rhodococcus, Mycobacterium, and Arcobacter were the predominant
    potential pathogens at oxidation ditch of oxidation ditch (OD) processes, Arcobacter
    was the predominant potential pathogen at oxic tank of anaerobic-anoxic-oxic (A/A/O),
    which were inconsistency with the results of this study (Yang et al., 2019a; Yang
    et al., 2019b; Yang et al., 2019c). In our study, Schizophyllum was the dominant
    pathogenic fungi at Bio-1t, Aspergillus at FH, Cladosporium at Bio-10t and BGG.
    Meanwhile, Aspergillus was the dominant pathogenic genera in aerobic section of
    biochemical tank of WWTPs with A/A/O process (Wang et al., 2022). 3.2. Variation
    in concentration of potential pathogenic microorganisms in wastewater and aerosols
    during the wastewater treatment process Potential pathogenic bacteria and fungi
    are important indicators for assessing the microbiological safety of wastewater
    (Bradford and Segal. 2009; Ramirez et al., 2005). Herein, besides analyzing the
    relative abundance of potential pathogens in the wastewater treatment process,
    five common and harmful potential pathogenic microorganisms (total bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae,
    Pseudomonas aeruginosa, fecal coliforms, and potential pathogenic fungi) were
    cultured and analyzed. 3.2.1. Concentration of potential pathogenic microorganisms
    in wastewater The total bacteria ranged from 2.50 × 105 to 1.35 × 108 CFU/L (Fig.
    4a); the highest concentration was obtained at Inf-1t, whereas the highest bacterial
    count during the process of WWTF-10t was detected at the influent unit as well,
    with about 1.20×108 CFU/L. The bacterial concentration in functional units (anaerobic
    and aerobic units) was lower than that in influent units (P < 0.01, ANOVA; Table
    S5), suggesting that the functional unit conditions may have an inhibitory effect
    on bacterial growth in WWTFs due to weaker nutritional competitiveness compared
    to other dominant genera or physical factors, such as dissolved oxygen concentration,
    etc. (Arora et al., 2021). The bacterial concentrations in effluent were lower
    than those of the influent. However, the concentration of bacteria in RD reached
    3.25 × 106 CFU/L, lower than the effluent but higher than the RU (Table 1). Download

    Pathogenic fungi concentration (CFU/L) 2.50×103 5.00×103 2.50×103 2.00×104 Enterobacteriaceae
    are a family of various gammaproteobacteria, including common (Klebsiella pneumoniae,
    E. coli, Salmonella enterica, Enterobacter spp.) and rare (Proteus mirabilis and
    Raoultella planticola) human pathogens, which could contribute to serious nosocomial
    and community-onset bacterial infections in humans (Cooney et al., 2014; Espigares
    et al., 2006). The Enterobacteriaceae concentration in the process was between
    7.50 × 105 and 1.73 × 108 CFU/L. The Enterobacteriaceae detected in Inf-1t and
    Inf-10t were approximately 2.83 × 107 CFU/L and 3.10 × 106 CFU/L, respectively.
    The Enterobacteriaceae concentration in the aerobic unit was significantly lower
    than in the influent (P < 0.01, t-test; Table S6). Furthermore, the Enterobacteriaceae
    concentrations in the effluent were lower than in influent, demonstrating that
    the rural WWTFs have a reduction effect on the Enterobacteriaceae concentration.
    Although Enterobacteriaceae with 2.55 × 106 CFU/L at RD was lower than in the
    effluent, it was higher than RU (Table 1). Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a motile,
    non-fermenting, gram-negative, rod-shaped, and blue-green pigmented pathogenic
    bacterium commonly found in wastewater, infecting humans and causing diseases
    such as pneumonia (Sathe et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2015). Throughout the wastewater
    treatment process, the concentration of P. aeruginosa ranged from 4.50 × 104 to
    2.10 × 106 CFU/L. The maximum concentration was obtained at Inf-1t, with approximately
    2.10 × 106 CFU/L, whereas the concentration of P. aeruginosa at Inf-10t was 1.65
    × 106 CFU/L. As the influent flowed through the anaerobic and aerobic units, there
    was a significant reduction in the concentration of P. aeruginosa (P < 0.01, ANOVA;
    Table S7). The value in the effluent of the facilities was lower than the influent.
    However, the concentration of RD was over 70 times higher than RU. Fecal coliforms
    are a threat to water biosecurity and an indicator of water pollution (Scott et
    al 2022). In this study, the fecal coliform concentration was between 2.50 × 103
    and 7.25 × 105 CFU/L. Inf-1t had the highest concentration of approximately 7.25
    × 105 CFU/L, and a concentration of 1.85 × 105 CFU/L was detected at Inf-10t.
    Fecal coliform concentrations in the anaerobic and aerobic units were significantly
    lower than in the influent (P < 0.05, ANOVA; Table S8). Furthermore, the value
    at Eff-1t was 9.25 × 103 CFU/L, whereas Eff-10t with 2.50 × 103 CFU/L was detected
    as the lowest value during the treatment process (Table 1). In this study, the
    fungi mainly included Candida and Aspergillus, which are potential pathogenic
    fungi that could cause human infections (Biedunkiewicz and Ozimek, 2009). The
    fungal concentration ranged from 2.50 × 103 CFU/L to 5.05 × 105 CFU/L and the
    concentration of influent at WWTF-1t and WWTF-10t was 7.50 × 104 CFU/L and 6.75
    × 104 CFU/L, respectively. Fungal concentrations in anaerobic and aerobic units
    were significantly lower than those in the influent (P < 0.01, ANOVA; Table S9).
    The concentrations of fungi in the effluents of WWTF-1t and WWTF-10t were 5.00
    × 103 CFU/L and 2.50 × 103 CFU/L, respectively. Moreover, the concentration of
    the RD was much higher than the RU (2.50 × 103 CFU/L), with 2.00×104 CFU/L (Table
    1). The concentrations of various pathogens in the effluent were significantly
    lower than those in the influent (P < 0.01, t-test; Table S10), indicating that
    the rural WWTFs have a certain reduction effect on the concentration of potential
    pathogens in wastewater (Srivastava and Chattopadhyay, 2022; Wen et al., 2009;
    Wéry et al., 2008). Additionally, the concentration of each potential pathogen
    in the RD was higher than in the RU, which may have been caused by the higher
    concentration of pathogens in the effluent. 3.2.2. Concentration of potential
    pathogenic microorganisms in bioaerosols Aerosol samples collected from the wastewater
    treatment process showed the highest concentration of bacteria in Aer-1t (≤ 3243
    CFU/m3), Enterobacteriaceae in Aer-1t (≤ 776 CFU/m3), P. aeruginosa in Ana-10t
    (≤ 1181 CFU/m3), fecal coliforms in Ana-1t (≤ 406 CFU/m3), and fungi in IP-1t
    (≤ 2717 CFU/m3) (Fig. 5). The results showed that the biological units of the
    facility were the main emission sources. The concentrations of selected microorganisms
    in Ana were lower than those in Aer, likely due to more bioaerosols being produced
    and released into the surrounding atmosphere during aeration (Wang et al., 2019).
    Moreover, the pathogen concentrations of FH, IP-1t, and IP-10t were all higher
    than for BG-1t and BG-10t, suggesting that the inlet pipes and toilet are potential
    sources of risk for potential pathogens escape in bioaerosols. Download : Download

    the figure indicate the proportion of respirable fragments (< 3.30 μm) and large
    particles (> 7.00 μm) in the bioaerosol particulate matter, respectively. Excluding
    P. aeruginosa, the concentrations of all other pathogens in Ana-1t and Aer-1t
    were higher than in the 10t facility, which may be due to the more pronounced
    inhibition of pathogenic bacterial growth in larger facilities with higher purification
    efficiency. The results also indicated that airborne particulate matter in the
    biological treatment unit of 1t and 10t facilities had RF concentrations and proportions
    of bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa, fecal coliforms, and potential
    pathogenic fungi, accounting for ≥33 % of the corresponding concentrations of
    the selected airborne microorganisms. BBG showed lower RF concentrations and proportions
    than the biological treatment unit. Higher RF concentrations were detected in
    the FH than in BBG. The largest fraction (aerodynamic diameter > 7 µm) of the
    five airborne potential pathogens was found at all sampling sites. The percentage
    of the largest fraction of bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa, fecal
    coliforms, and potential pathogenic fungi in the biological unit at the 1 t and
    10 t facilities was lower than the RF proportions (Fig. 5). Therefore, a higher
    risk of lower respiratory tract infections and inflammation may be associated
    with exposure to biological units of facilities. 3.3. Source allocation SourceTracker
    was used to analyze the sources of potential pathogens in aerosols, as well as
    potential pathogen sources in sewage sludge. The source proportions of aerosols
    from the WWTFs, corresponding wastewater, air, and unknown sources were 36.55
    %, 18.13 %, and 45.32 %, respectively, at WWTF-1t and 40.51 %, 19.08 %, and 40.41
    %, respectively, at WWTF-10t (Fig. 6). The unknown sources were likely surrounding
    plants, soil, and dust. The source proportions of sewage sludge from the WWTFs,
    corresponding biological units, influent, and unknown sources were 29.28 %, 36.55
    %, and 43.07 %, respectively, for WWTF-1t and 41.36 %, 25.33 %, and 33.31 %, respectively,
    for WWTF-10t. Unknown sources were likely air and effluent. The microbial populations
    in the WWTF-1t and WWTF-10t aerosols were dominated by microorganisms from sewage,
    whereas those in the sewage sludge were dominated by microorganisms from biological
    units (anaerobic and aerobic). The wastewater proportion of aerosols and the biological
    unit proportion of wastewater in WWTF-10t were higher than that in WWTF-1t, respectively.

    influent pathogens. The dominant potential pathogenic genera in the biological
    units were Pseudomonas, and Cladosporium. Most of the dominant species in air
    and wastewater were found among airborne potential pathogens, whereas numerous
    species in the influent and were also detected in the sewage sludge (Fig. 7).

    Fig. 7. Venn diagram showing potential pathogenic microorganisms in wastewater,
    bioaerosol, and sewage sludge. (a) Bacterial population; (b) Fungal population.
    As mentioned in Section 3.1, 66, 16, and 42 potential pathogenic bacterial genera
    were detected in wastewater, bioaerosols from facilities, and sewage sludge, respectively.
    For bacteria, 15 and 28 potential pathogenic genera in wastewater were shared
    with aerosols and sewage sludge, respectively, while 13 potential pathogenic bacteria
    in aerosols were shared with sewage sludge. Thirteen shared potential pathogenic
    bacteria were identified among them. Additionally, 16/66 potential pathogenic
    bacteria detected in bioaerosols were shared with the wastewater (Fig. 7). Peptostreptococcus
    was identified in bioaerosol but not in the wastewater and sewage sludge; therefore,
    it was probably contributed by surrounding soils, plants, and dry dust/material
    present in the ambient air of wastewater facilities (Uhrbrand et al., 2017). For
    fungi, 44, 25, and 34 potential pathogenic fungal genera were detected in wastewater,
    bioaerosols, and sewage sludge, respectively. And 23 and 33 potential pathogenic
    genera in wastewater were shared with aerosols and sewage sludge, respectively,
    while 20 potential pathogenic fungi in aerosols were shared with sewage sludge
    (Fig. 7). Twenty potential pathogenic fungi were shared among them. Likewise,
    23/25 potential pathogenic bacteria detected in bioaerosols were shared with the
    wastewater. Myriodontium and Scopulariopsis were identified in bioaerosol but
    not in the wastewater and sewage sludge; therefore, they were probably contributed
    by the surroundings (Uhrbrand et al., 2017). Verticillium in the sludge was not
    detected in wastewater and facility bioaerosols, as they likely also originated
    in the surrounding environment, such as soil or plants. PCoA was used to illustrate
    the variation in potential pathogenic bacterial and fungal populations in wastewater,
    air, and sewage samples collected from different sampling sites. For pathogenic
    bacteria, the first two components, PCoA1 and PCoA2, explained 23.75 % and 15.00
    % of data variation, respectively (Fig. 8c). For pathogenic fungi, the first two
    components accounted for 26.75 % and 17.09 % of the variation, respectively (Fig.
    8d). A separation was observed between the wastewater samples collected from WWTF-1t
    and WWTF-10t. Sewage, air, and sludge samples from the same treatment facility
    clustered close to each other, indicating similar pathogen communities. Wastewater,
    airborne, and sewage sludge bacterial and fungal populations in samples collected
    from WWTF-1t differed greatly from those acquired from WWTF-10t, whereas these
    populations showed similarities in samples from the same facility. Download :

    genera; (d) Potential pathogenic fungal genera. 3.4. Risk assessment There were
    42 potential pathogenic bacteria (total relative abundance = 2.68 %) and 34 potential
    pathogenic fungi in the sewage sludge (total relative abundance = 1.53 %), respectively
    (Table 1). Since the sewage sludge of the facilities in this study was collected
    every 6 months and transported out for centralized treatment, with minimal exposure
    to residents, the microbial risks in the effluent and aerosols were primarily
    evaluated in this study. Potential pathogens in rural wastewater treatment process
    effluents and aerosols could directly or indirectly influence the environment
    and human health. Therefore, in this study, the microbial risk in wastewater and
    aerosols (e.g., bacteria) during rural wastewater treatment processes was evaluated.
    A total of 52 potential pathogenic bacteria (total relative abundance = 2.96 %)
    and 35 potential pathogenic fungi (total relative abundance = 5.62 %) were detected
    in the effluent, higher than in the RU (bacteria = 37, 2.04 %; fungi = 9, 0.03
    %) and RD (bacteria = 41, 16.71 %; fungi = 19, 11.99 %) (Table 1). Hence, more
    potential pathogens with higher relative abundances were detected downstream of
    the river than upstream, which could be influenced by effluent from the facilities.
    Fecal coliforms are an important bacterial indicator for evaluating microbiological
    indicators of wastewater. The effluent fecal coliform concentrations in WWTF-1t
    and WWTF-10t were 9.25 × 104 CFU/L and 2.50 × 103 CFU/L, respectively, which were
    higher than those in upstream and downstream. Furthermore, the effluent concentrations
    of total bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and pathogenic
    fungi were lower than the influent but higher than RU. Whereas the concentrations
    of the RD were higher than for RU. Therefore, it suggested that the higher values
    of potential pathogenic genera, relative abundance, and concentration in the river
    downstream compared to upstream could be caused by WWTF effluent, increasing the
    risk of pathogenic microorganism exposure in natural water bodies. However, several
    studies reported that the microbial diversity and the pathogen concentration of
    wastewater from WWTPs are decreased after disinfection. For instance, the Enterococci
    concentration decreased from 5.47–6.19 log10 CFU/100 mL to 0.18–1.53 log10 CFU/100
    mL after disinfection. Similarly, E. coli concentration, initially ranging from
    5.80 × 103 - 2.80 × 104 CFU/100 mL, experienced a substantial reduction of 1–4
    log10 following disinfection. Additionally, the presence of Staphylococcus aureus
    and Bacillus subtilis was notably diminished through UV or chlorine disinfection.
    These findings underscore the efficacy of disinfection in mitigating the microbial
    risks associated with effluent (Chen et al., 2023; Korajkic et al., 2022; Wang
    et al., 2023). Inhalation and skin contact with bacteria were the main pathways
    of exposure. The airborne risk to adult males and females during the maintenance
    of the WWTF was calculated from the perspective of bacteria. For both adult males
    and females, the health risks of airborne bacteria by inhalation were several
    orders of magnitude higher than those by skin contact (Fig. 9), suggesting that
    inhalation was the main pathway of airborne bacteria exposure, which is consistent
    with previous studies on WWTP (Yang et al., 2019a; Yang et al., 2019b). Download

    The risk assessment results of each stage during rural wastewater treatment facilities.
    The HI inhalation of WWTF-10t (HImales = 2.50E+00>1; HIfemales = 2.42E+00>1) for
    both adult males and females was less than in WWTF-1t (HImales = 3.09E+00>1; HIfemales
    = 2.98E+00>1) (Fig. 9), suggesting non-negligible inhalation risks of WWTF with
    higher risks for adults in wastewater treatment of WWTF-1t. A similar phenomenon
    was observed at Aer-1t, and Aer-10t. At sites with high levels of airborne bacteria,
    such as Aer-1t and Aer-10t, health risks were higher. This may be due to intense
    aeration, causing more bacteria to escape into the air. A previous study reported
    inhalation risks are significantly higher at aeration tanks with high airborne
    bacteria loads, suggesting that an outbreak of airborne bacteria at these sites
    would cause high-risk scenarios in the WWTPs, which is similar to the results
    of this study (Yang et al., 2019a). The highest HQ inhalation value was observed
    at the Aer-1t, followed by IP-1, Aer-10t, Ana-1t, Ana-10t, and IP-10t. As with
    WWTFs, the highest value of HQ-inhalation was also found at the aeration units
    of WWTP (Yang et al., 2019c). The HQ for males at Aer-1t and IP-1 was 1.13E+00,
    and 1.00E+00, respectively, and 1.09E+00 for females at Aer-1t was, suggesting
    that airborne bacteria exposure could cause adverse health effects for males and
    females at these sites. Yang et al. (2019b) found the HQ values of 1.98E+00, which
    was higher than that in Aer-1t, suggesting noncarcinogenic risks of bacteria in
    WWTP aeration units (Yang et al., 2019b). Microbial aerosols detected in the anaerobic
    and aerobic units of WWTFs indicated higher proportions of RF than BBG, suggesting
    an increased inhalation risk for WWTF workers. Moreover, the release risks of
    pathogens, such as Enterobacteriaceae, fungi, fecal coliforms, and Pseudomonas
    aeruginosa, from the WWTF were exigent, for which toxicity may be superimposed
    (Han et al., 2020). 4. Conclusions This study investigated the potential pathogens
    succession characteristics, concentration variation, source exploration, and risk
    assessment in rural wastewater treatment process in China. The main conclusions
    are as follows: The concentration of potential pathogenic genera in the effluent
    was significantly lower than in the influent after treatment by the rural wastewater
    facility; the river downstream could be affected by the effluent and be higher
    than river upstream. Rural wastewater treatment facility aerosols contained more
    potential pathogenic genera with a higher total relative abundance than the background
    air. The highest concentrations and the largest proportions of RF in aerosols
    were almost exclusively found in the anaerobic and aerobic units of rural WWTFs.
    The effluents of rural WWTFs could pose a potential microbiological risk to humans
    and the environment. For maintenance staff and residents, inhalation is the main
    pathway of exposure to airborne bacteria, and bioaerosols from WWTFs could pose
    potential health risks as well. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors

    \ costs, externalities, or opportunity costs as WFD requires. However, any pricing\
    \ imposed above the marginal productivity level would present a potential constraint\
    \ for the producer, considering that according to our estimation, total water\
    \ productivity accounts for one-third of the maize average gross output. In such\
    \ a scenario, farmers would have to choose between reducing water usage, which\
    \ could lead to a loss of production, and optimizing the overall production process\
    \ by reducing water usage and adopting novel technologies in the long term. The\

    1. Introduction Water is necessary for human existence and a key input for several
    economic activities, including agriculture, which is crucial for the global food
    supply (Damania et al., 2020). Population growth, urbanization, and the growing
    demand for food make water an increasingly scarce resource in several areas of
    the world. In addition, climate change makes adverse weather events more violent,
    frequent, and less predictable. This is also true for drought, a threat now spreading
    to areas that do not usually face precipitation constraints or extremely high
    temperatures (FAO, 2022). Moreover, water is primarily allocated to industrial
    and civilian uses in the case of water shortages, leading to losses in irrigated
    crop yields and revenues. However, the rising temperatures and increasing scarcity
    of precipitation have led to a greater demand for irrigation water, often making
    groundwater recharge insufficient to counterbalance extractions (Wada et al.,
    2010). In this scenario, agriculture accounts for 72% of global water extractions
    and represents 70% of extractions in Mediterranean areas (Berbel et al., 2019,
    FAO, 2022). Policies and institutions have failed to face these human and economic
    implications in the past, and even today, water management policies are struggling
    to address this complex scenario.1 In recent decades, the European Union has attempted
    to promote the rational use of water resources among its Member Countries. One
    of the fundamental approaches used in this regard has been the adoption of the
    Water Framework Directive (WFD) (European Commission, 2000), which aims to encourage
    efficient water use through economic incentives such as Full Cost Recovery (FCR)2
    and the “polluter pays” principle. In 2015, Italy took a step further by introducing
    mandatory measurements and estimations for irrigation volumes and environmental
    and resource-related costs associated with such activities (D.M., 31 luglio 2015).
    However, the number of countries in which water pricing meets the requirements
    set out by the WFD remains relatively low, with most countries, including Italy,
    failing to fully comply with these principles (Zucaro, 2014). In fact, in certain
    areas, especially where volumetric tariffs are not applied and where metering
    is not adopted, the quantification of irrigation volumes poses the most significant
    challenge when analysing water consumption in agriculture. Giannoccaro et al.
    (2020) highlighted that in Italy, defining access rights to groundwater withdrawals
    and managing asymmetric information and free riding is a complex matter. Introducing
    pricing mechanisms and FCR measures, as highlighted by Berbel et al. (2019) and
    Galioto et al. (2017), is also an ambitious objective that requires the knowledge
    of water’s economic value as well as environmental and related service costs (Gómez-limón
    and Martin-Ortega, 2013). In addition, recently, the European Green Deal and Farm
    to Fork Strategy (European Commission, 2019)have further emphasized the need for
    natural resource preservation, leading to the new Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)
    design which, among many other goals, aims to help the WFD reach its objectives.3
    Considering the urgent need for sustainable water resource management, driven
    by policies aimed at preserving natural resources and by climate change threats,
    such as rising temperatures and reduced water availability, the estimation of
    water economic value and productivity arises as a powerful tool to thoroughly
    understand the key economic aspects of water use. However, the estimation of water
    economic value is particularly difficult when market prices are absent or distorted
    and, in such circumstances, it is primarily feasible using simulated market or
    “shadow prices” (Young, 2005). Several definitions of water shadow prices exist
    in the literature (He et al., 2007): For irrigation water, they can be either
    based on the value of water alternative use (e.g., different users or different
    time) or farmer’s behavior. In this study, we consider the latter circumstance,
    in which the economic mechanism behind water consumption is based on two main
    assumptions: farmers are price takers (for outputs and inputs) and profit maximizers.
    Thus, they will use water up to the point where its price will be equal to the
    added value derived from using a marginal unit of this input (Williams et al.,
    2017). Bierkens et al. (2019), following this approach, stated that water shadow
    price denotes the value of crops produced per marginal unit of water consumed,
    given the quantity of other inputs. Therefore, estimating the shadow price is
    crucial for the optimal allocation of scarce water resources and the efficient
    functioning of water markets. Under these assumptions, this study aims to assess
    the relevance of irrigation water in agricultural production. Specifically, it
    seeks to estimate the irrigation water shadow price for maize grain production
    at the farm level leveraging data from a sample of 1625 farms over Italy spanning
    from 2010 to 2020. Maize grain was selected as the focal crop due to its economic
    importance among irrigated crops and its vulnerability to market volatility and
    climate change threats. Italy, ranking as the fourth-largest maize producer in
    the European Union (Erenstein et al., 2022), relies heavily on maize in various
    supply chains, including Parmigiano Reggiano production, where silage fodder as
    feed is prohibited (Mantovi et al., 2015). Nonetheless, water deficits have forced
    many parts of Italy to rationalize or suspend irrigation water, resulting in yield
    losses and concerns related to crop quality (CREA, 2021). Moreover, this situation
    could worsen due to the increasing occurrence of extreme weather events, e.g.,
    water scarcity (IPCC, 2019, Rosenzweig et al., 2014), especially in Mediterranean
    countries (Hristov et al., 2020, Lionello and Scarascia, 2018), including Italy
    (Mereu et al., 2021). Several methods have been proposed to estimate water shadow
    price, most of which rely on production functions (Johansson et al., 2002). This
    strand of literature mainly focuses on estimating the irrigation water shadow
    price for river basins (Garciá Suárez et al., 2019, Koundouri et al., 2014, Mesa-Jurado
    et al., 2010, Williams et al., 2017) or at the national scale (Kiani and Abbasi,
    2012, Takatsuka et al., 2018, Veninga, 2017), and it rarely uses detailed microeconomic
    data to estimate shadow prices for irrigation water at the farm scale (Mesa-Jurado
    et al., 2010, Koundouri et al., 2014). While previous studies have already estimated
    irrigation water shadow prices for various crops at the Country or River Basin
    level, this study contributes to the existing literature by focusing on maize
    grain production in Italy at the farm level. An econometric production function
    approach coupled with detailed microeconomic data spanning a decade was adopted
    to derive reliable estimates. Furthermore, quantile regression was implemented
    to better understand the factors influencing water irrigation shadow prices among
    farms. By providing accurate and up-to-date estimates of water shadow price and
    its variability, this study can help suggest evidence-based water management strategies
    and identify vulnerable areas or clusters of farms that may be particularly vulnerable
    to water-related challenges. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 briefly
    overviews water shadow price definitions and estimation methods. Section 3 describes
    data and methodology specifying the econometric models, production function form,
    and shadow price estimation procedure. Section 4 presents econometric estimates
    and the obtained results. Section 5 discusses the implications of these results.
    Finally, conclusions are provided in Section 6. 2. Shadow prices of irrigation
    water: a brief overview The variety of theoretical frameworks in approaching the
    estimation of shadow prices of irrigation water is associated to multiple definitions,
    each contingent on different underlying economic mechanisms such as the value
    of alternative use or farmer behavior (He et al., 2007) and relying on different
    methodologies. While this section does not intend to be an exhaustive overview,
    it does offer a brief overview that addresses some theoretical and methodological
    issues in the analysis of irrigation water shadow prices. 2.1. Definitions and
    assumptions Among the various definitions, Bierkens et al. (2019) use the following
    definition: “The shadow price of water reflects the value of crops that can be
    produced by the marginal unit of water consumed, given the quantity of the other
    inputs.” This definition is based on the assumption that farmers are price takers
    (for outputs and inputs) and profit maximisers; as rational agents, farmers use
    water up to the point where its price equals the added value derived from using
    a marginal unit of this input (Williams et al., 2017). While this definition provides
    a snapshot of the actual irrigation water economic value at the farm level, it
    has several advantages as well as limitations. One of its main advantages is that
    it allows one to precisely pinpoint the maximum price a farmer would be willing
    to pay for the last unit of irrigation water used, thus making it particularly
    relevant for short-term policy considerations. It provides a practical framework
    for assessing irrigation water productivity, which is essential for farmers who
    operate under stringent budget constraints and face immediate production decisions.
    On the flip side, this definition intentionally sidesteps some complexities. Unlike
    more comprehensive approaches like those by Young and Loomis (2014), it does not
    incorporate broader environmental or opportunity costs, nor does it explicitly
    consider the temporal aspect of irrigation water allocation (Elnaboulsi, 2001,
    Young and Loomis, 2014). Indeed, this study follows the aforementioned definition,
    without delving into long-term environmental externalities, the value of water
    in alternative uses, or the intertemporal efficiency or opportunity costs that
    may emerge in longer-term scenarios. In this specific context and under these
    assumptions, the shadow price aligns with the marginal value (He et al., 2007,
    Wang and Lall, 2002). Limitations can be seen as calculated, as a narrower perspective
    is common because farmers often prioritize maximizing their current profits and
    may not account for the availability of water in the future when making decisions.
    We assume, then, that farmers aim to maximize their current net returns and that
    the shadow price is determined through free competition among them. 2.2. Methodologies
    and limitations Several methods exist to estimate the shadow price of irrigation
    water. According to Young (2005), there are two main methods: deductive and inductive.
    Deductive methods use logical processes and rely on economic postulates, such
    as profit and utility maximization, whereas inductive methods rely mainly on econometrics
    and statistics. Among deductive methods, the most popular are the Residual Value
    Method (RVM) (Berbel et al., 2011, Hellegers and Davidson, 2010, Ziolkowska, 2015),
    General Equilibrium Models (GEM) (Jiang et al., 2014, Smith et al., 2015) and
    Mathematical Programming (MP) (Liu and Chen, 2008, Rosegrant et al., 2000). Under
    RVM, it is assumed that all inputs except for water are priced at market rate.
    The price of irrigation water is then calculated as the ratio between the net
    returns from crop production and the total quantity of water used for irrigation.
    As for MP, this method derives the optimal allocation of resources, including
    water, based on objective functions such as profit maximization or cost minimization.4
    For analyzing the broader, economy-wide implications of changes in water use and
    availability, General Equilibrium Models are often preferred (Jiang et al., 2014,
    Smith et al., 2015). However, the aforementioned methods have several limitations.
    RVM, upon which most deductive methods are based, estimates water value by deducting
    costs from predicted revenues. It requires the assumption that all markets are
    perfectly competitive, with the exception of the water market. Additionally, this
    method requires a thorough estimation of input costs, which can be challenging
    when dealing with inputs that are not priced on markets—for example, assets owned
    by the firm like land and machinery. Under these circumstances, a certain degree
    of uncertainty is inevitable, and omitting or misrepresenting some input costs
    will inevitably lead to an overestimation of water value. Similarly, both MP and
    GEM, rely heavily on theoretical assumptions and may oversimplify complex economic
    relationships. Inductive procedures include econometric estimations of the production
    function or water demand (Bruno and Jessoe, 2021, de Bonviller et al., 2020, Scheierling
    et al., 2006), Hedonic Pricing, Contingent Valuation (Calatrava and Garrido, 2005,
    Li et al., 2021), Choice Experiments (Rigby et al., 2010), Stochastic Frontier
    Analysis (SFA) (Coelli and Orion, 2013; P. Koundouri et al., 2014a) and Data Envelopment
    Analysis (DEA), or a combination of both (Shen and Lin, 2017). Inductive methods
    are more reliable when data are available. Given an accurate specification of
    the production function that captures the relationship between water and production,
    these estimates can provide a reliable assessment of shadow prices using experimental
    (field experiments) or observational (primary or secondary) data (Mesa-Jurado
    et al., 2010).5 Among its various applications, Njuki and Bravo-Ureta (2019) employed
    a Cobb-Douglas stochastic production function to determine the shadow price of
    irrigation water in the US. In a similar vein, Bopp et al. (2022) applied this
    method to Chilean wine grape production, Conradie et al. (2006) to South African
    vineyards, and Coelli and Orion (2013) to wine grape production in Eastern Australia.
    More recently, Nouri-Khajebelagh et al. (2021) estimated the average water shadow
    price for various crops in Iran. In different contexts, Bellver-Domingo et al.
    (2019) derived the irrigation water shadow price by analyzing the avoided environmental
    cost through water desalination using distance function estimation. Irrigation
    water shadow price estimates based on distance functions were also used by Riera
    and Brümmer (2022) in Argentina, by Koundouri et al. (2014b) and Koundouri et
    al. (2014a) in Greece and by Li et al. (2019) in the Beijing- Tianjin-Hebei city
    region in China. Bierkens et al. (2019) utilized macro data and a Cobb-Douglas
    production function to estimate the irrigation water shadow price for various
    crops in 11 countries, including Italy. Similar studies have been conducted to
    estimate green water economic value in the Czech Republic (Grammatikopoulou et
    al., 2020) and South Florida (Takatsuka et al., 2018). Veninga (2017) applied
    a translog production function to calculate irrigation water shadow prices for
    maize, sugarcane, and citrus in twelve countries, among them, Italy, where groundwater
    extraction is the primary water source. Garciá Suárez et al. (2019) assessed the
    impact of increased irrigation volumes on the total biomass yield in the High
    Plains River Basin, US. A table concisely summarizing key features of some relevant
    studies using the production function approach is available in Appendix (Table
    A1).6 While previous studies have mainly focused on estimating the economic value
    of irrigation water for crops at the country or river basin scale using secondary
    or primary macro data, our study estimates the water irrigation shadow prices
    for Italy using detailed microeconomic data, which offers two significant advantages.
    Firstly, using farm-level accurate and reliable data over 10 years enhances the
    accuracy of the shadow price estimates. Secondly, by estimating the shadow prices
    at the farm level, we can identify the circumstances or areas in which irrigation
    water productivity is most affected by water scarcity or efficiency. This approach
    aids in better resource allocation and identification of vulnerable farms or territories.
    Furthermore, a better understanding of the factors affecting shadow prices at
    the farm level could aid in the development of more effective strategies and interventions
    for water management. 3. Materials and methods 3.1. Data This study focuses on
    Italian maize grain farms, leveraging a Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) sample
    that provides detailed information at both farm and crop levels. FADN is the only
    source of microeconomic data based on harmonized bookkeeping principles. Based
    on national surveys, it aggregates data on 68,000 farms, representing almost 5
    million EU farms, 90% of the European UAA and Standard Output. The Italian sample
    comprises 11,000 farms, whose data are stratified by region, size, and type of
    farming (TF). The data include Gross Output, land, crop-specific variable costs,
    work-related costs for families and employed workers, and irrigation water volumes.
    To ensure the homogeneity of the sample and enable accurate attribution of measured
    costs at the farm level to the specific crop (particularly work-related expenses),
    we selected an unbalanced panel of 1625 farms growing irrigated maize grain, and
    excluded those with livestock, for the period 2010–2020; a total of 5224 observations
    were analysed. Northern Italy regions (predominantly Lombardy, Piedmont, Friuli-Venezia
    Giulia, Emilia-Romagna, and Veneto) accounted for 87.3% of the sample, Central
    Italy for 11%, and the South for 1.7%. The majority of farms were family-run (67.5%),
    and corporate entities comprised only 18% of the sample. In terms of economic
    size, 48% of the observations’ Standard Production ranges from 50,000 to 100,000
    €, while 35.7% ranges from 8000 to 50,000 € and only 16.3% exceeds 100,000 €.
    Concerning water sources, a significant part of the sample relied on Water User
    Associations (WUA) infrastructures (78.1%), while the rest relied on self-supply
    irrigation. In fact, in Italy, WUA are the primary administrators of irrigation
    water and play an essential role in planning the responsible use of this resource.7
    These associations typically consist of organized groups of water users, such
    as farmers and agricultural communities who collectively manage and allocate water
    for irrigation purposes. The infrastructure associated with WUAs often includes
    a network of canals, ditches and water distribution systems that serve as conduits
    for irrigation water. These structures are designed to facilitate the distribution
    of water, involving the scheduling and coordination of water deliveries to ensure
    that each member receives their allocated share during the irrigation season,
    which typically goes from spring (March-April) to the end of the summer (September-October).
    The characteristics of irrigation across various regions of the country are shaped
    by a combination of hydrogeological, topographical, environmental, and historical
    factors and these influence both the infrastructure and the management of water
    provision. 8 Table 1 presents sample descriptive statistics for key variables
    that are utilized in the estimation of shadow prices. These variables include
    the total agricultural area measured in hectares, family and employed labor quantified
    in work units, and a range of cost factors—namely, land value, work costs, machinery,
    pesticides, and fertilizers—all expressed per hectare for the cultivation of maize
    grain. The table also includes data on the volumes of irrigation water, also denominated
    per hectare. Table 1. Descriptive statistics of the farm sample – unit of measure,

    3.2. Econometric Model Following the definition provided by Bierkens et al. (2019),
    the water shadow price has been estimated by calculating the value of maize that
    can be produced using a unit of irrigation water. From an empirical standpoint,
    the shadow price can be obtained by estimating the production function and taking
    its partial derivative of the production function concerning irrigation water.
    The production function (Eq. 1) describes the relationship between crop production
    and various marketable inputs (such as seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides), labor,
    land, and water. (1) Here, Y represents the Maize Grain Gross Output; L, land;
    W, water; F, use of fertilizers; P, use of pesticides; VC, other variable costs;
    WR, labor, and M, use of machinery. All the aforementioned quantities are expressed
    as monetary values, except for water, which is expressed in volume (m³). In addition,
    T represents average annual temperatures (°C) and R is the average annual precipitation
    (in 100 mm) at the provincial level. These variables are included to capture the
    effect of climate variability.9 For each observation, the expenditure on each
    input utilized for maize grain production was assessed in Euros (€). Land (L)
    is constructed by identifying the annual expenditure of rented land and attributing
    a return of 2% on the land value for owned land. F, P, and VC represent annual
    expenditures on maize production, with VC encompassing costs such as quality certifications,
    energy consumption, subcontracting, marketing, seed procurement, and machinery
    renting. The costs related to water supply are included in the variable VC and
    concern the fees charged by WUAs, as for the costs related to self-supply, this
    amount depends mainly on the energy cost required for pumping or transportation,
    which, in turn, is influenced by the well’s depth and pumping or distribution
    system adopted. Labor (WR) comprises both employed labor, whose cost is obtained
    from FADN Balance Sheets, and family labor, whose compensation includes an hourly
    wage reflecting the opportunity cost and a reward for the managerial work of the
    entrepreneur. M represents the owned machinery work expenditure and encompasses
    fuel, insurance, maintenance, and machine operator payments. W indicates the water
    irrigation volumes for maize grain production, covering both the farms’ self-supplied
    water services and those served by WUAs. The choice to use economic variables
    rather than quantities derives from the characteristics of the Italian FADN data.
    While this dataset provides extensive and detailed information on both individual
    farms and specific crops, it includes data on both the type of fertilizers and
    pesticide use. This results in significant heterogeneity in both the formulations
    and types of products used. While it might be possible to differentiate between
    organic and inorganic fertilizers distinguishing among various types of pesticides,
    and more importantly, various units of measurements are not always feasible. This
    could have introduced a bias in the creation of variables and, subsequently, in
    the estimation process. For this reason, in alignment with common practices in
    the literature (see, among others Latruffe et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2012; Zhu
    and Lansink, 2010), we have chosen to use monetary values. However, we have chosen
    to differentiate between inputs rather than aggregating them into a single variable.
    This approach allows us to maintain a finer level of detail and provides more
    specific insights for each of the inputs under consideration. Table 2 lists all
    variables used in the econometric model. Table 2. Description of variables used
    in the production functions estimation. Variables UM Description Y Production

    Empirically, the production function is estimated following the Cobb-Douglas specification(Cobb
    and Douglas, 1928) : (2) Where represents the vector of inputs including water
    (W), and β are the estimated parameters vector reflecting input elasticities on
    production, is the intercept while e is the error component. This equation can
    be rewritten as Eq. 3 for estimation purposes: (3) Vector β includes a specific
    parameter related to water elasticity, (Eq. 4): (4) Eq. 2 can be rearranged to
    derive the partial derivative of Eq. 1 with respect to the water input ( , as
    illustrated in Eq. 5: (5) The Cobb-Douglas specification assumes that all inputs
    are substitutes, and the elasticity of substitution between inputs is constant.
    This limitation can be overcome through a translog specification of the production
    function. The latter provides a more flexible range of substitution options than
    those limited by the constant elasticity of substitution assumed in the Cobb-Douglas
    function. The translog production function is expressed as follows: (6) Where
    represents the vector of inputs including water (W); β, estimated parameters vector;
    , intercept; and e, error component. As before, β includes a specific parameter
    related to water elasticity, (Eq. 6). The marginal productivity of irrigation
    water is expressed as the partial derivative of Eq. 5 with respect to the water
    input ( , as in Eq. 7: (7) Where all the variables are the same as in Eq. 6. In
    both Cobb-Douglas and translog specifications, in order to account for environmental
    factors characterizing the varying context of each farm over time, we included
    average temperature and precipitation at the provincial level per year. By following
    Coelli et al., (1999) and Rahman et al., (2009) we assume that the environmental
    factors, enter in the production function linearly.10 The constant term was augmented
    to: (8) With and are parameters that quantify the influence of average annual
    temperature and precipitation, respectively on agricultural production, providing
    a more comprehensive and nuanced analysis. From an empirical perspective, a weighted
    fixed-effects specification was estimated. Several methodological issues emerge
    when elasticities and Total Factor Productivity (TFP) are estimated using traditional
    methods such as OLS. This is because productivity and input choices are correlated,
    which causes simultaneity or endogeneity problems (Beveren, 2012, Wooldridge,
    2009). In addition, if market entry and exit are not allowed, selection bias will
    emerge. Several estimators have been proposed to address these biases, including
    those developed by Olley and Pakes (1996) and Levinsohn and Petrin, 2003, Levinsohn
    and Petrin, 2004. However, by assuming that firm-specific productivity is time-invariant,11
    it is possible to estimate production functions using a fixed-effects estimator
    (Pavcnik, 2002), as done by several studies focusing on the marginal productivity
    of irrigation water (Bierkens et al., 2017; Grammatikopoulou et al., 2020; Veninga,
    2017). Moreover, the fixed-effects estimator addresses potential sources of endogeneity
    that may arise from the exclusion of time-invariant variables in the estimates
    (Baltagi, 2008). In addition, using an unbalanced panel, we overcome the self-selection
    bias. Upon calculating shadow prices according to Eq. 7, a quantile regression
    (Koenker and Bassett, 2013) was estimated, which enabled us to identify farm characteristics
    associated with various levels or quantiles of shadow prices. (9) Qp(τ | z) =
    θ(τ) +z''γ(τ) + u(τ) Table 3 reports all the variables used in the quantile regression.
    In particular, we rely on the first and the third quartiles, τ = 25 and τ = 75,
    and on the differsence between them, Δ = Qp(25)–Qp(75), to immediately note which
    characteristics of the farm are associated with relatively low and high levels
    of shadow price, while γ(τ) parameters can be estimated by using the estimator
    described by Hunter and Lange (2000). The independent variables represent territorial,
    structural, and managerial farm characteristics. Among territorial attributes,
    we consider geographic and altimetric location while we examine farm size for
    structural factors. Lastly, regarding organizational aspects, we consider labor
    organization, specifically the proportion of family or employed labor and irrigation
    water sources. Table 3. Description of the quantile regression independent variables

    of a translog, we compared these functions using an F-test (Greene, 2002); and
    the results showed that the translog production function fitted the data significantly
    better. Moreover, as the Hausman test suggests, a fixed-effects model was employed
    rather than a random-effects specification. To the latter, year fixed effects
    have been included to control for systematic temporal variability. Table 4 presents
    the estimated parameters of the translog production function and their significance
    levels. The estimated parameters for the Cobb-Douglas model are presented in the
    Appendix (see Table A2), alongside the parameters for the translog model without
    fixed effects over years (see Table A3). Table 4. Weighted fixed effects model

    Adjusted R-Sq: within = 0.50, between = 0.78, overall = 0.73. All the variables
    are expressed in logarithms, except for Temperatures and Precipitations. Only
    the linear parameter of irrigation water was significant, revealing its role in
    maize production. The coefficients further revealed the significant complementarity
    of water with fertilizers (0.027) and work (0.011). However, a negative relationship
    was observed between water and pesticides (-0.026). The coefficients associated
    with climatic variables are not statistically significant, neither for Temperatures
    nor Rainfall. This is likely because these variables, representing annual means
    at the provincial level, have their effects absorbed by the annual fixed effects.12
    After estimating the parameters, we calculated the value of water elasticity for
    gross maize output, which showed an inelastic response to irrigation water, with
    an average water elasticity of 0.08. Half of the farms in the sample showed an
    elasticity value ranging from 0.06 to 0.10. Additionally, the average water shadow
    price, calculated using Eq. 6, was found to be 0.29 €/m³, with a median of 0.20
    €/m³ (Table 5). The water shadow price for half of the farms within the sample
    ranged from 0.10 €/m³ to 0.39 €/m³. Table 5. Summary statistics of estimated water

    water for maize (i.e., the shadow price) exhibits diminishing marginal returns
    with decreasing productivity for higher volumes, as indicated by the blue line.
    On the contrary, the total water productivity (in red) showed an increasing trend,
    although at a decreasing rate. It starts higher in the initial section and decreases
    as marginal productivity decreases. The estimated water shadow price for the aforementioned
    irrigation volumes ranges from 0.02 to 0.04 €/m³. Total water productivity ranges
    between 620 and 670 €/ha, accounting for approximately one-third of the maize
    grain total gross output. Download : Download high-res image (94KB) Download :

    1 are crucial for pricing mechanisms. Assuming no adjustment of other production
    inputs, if prices exceed 0.05 €/m³, they will surpass the value of the marginal
    productivity of water. In the short term, farmers may choose to reduce irrigation
    water use, resulting in a decrease in overall production of approximately one-third,
    with potentially important consequences within the overall supply chain. While
    the above-mentioned results provide an average estimation of shadow prices and
    productivity, it is essential to note that different farms may have different
    shadow prices or productivity levels for water use. This underscores the significance
    of farm-level analysis in identifying the variability of water productivity and
    its association with farm characteristics: estimated shadow price distribution
    has been analyzed using quantile regressions to detect the influence of several
    farms’ characteristics on water irrigation economic value. The first (Q1, τ =
    25) and third quartiles (Q3, τ = 75) were considered to highlight the differences
    between low and high-water marginal productivity levels (Table 6). The model also
    highlights a negative trend, with shadow prices decreasing over time. The estimated
    parameters show significant differences between geographical areas at the Q3 level,
    with the Central Regions showing lower marginal productivity than Northern Regions
    (-0.150). The altitudinal area shows significant differences in Q1, where the
    shadow price is inversely proportional to the altitude. The Irrigation Water Source
    highlights a significant positive difference between Groundwater and WUA in Q3
    (+0.060). Concerning farm management, Family-Run farms show lower shadow prices
    than farms with Mainly Employed Labor (+0.028) or Mainly Family Labor in Q1 (+0.033),
    while farms relying on subcontracting solely on employed labor show lower shadow
    prices in Q3 (-0.143). Farm Size, instead, shows significant differences with
    increasing acreage: Medium Farms (15–40 ha), especially, show a gap with Small
    Farms (< 5 ha) equal to −0.046 and −0.153, respectively, in Q1 and Q3. Table 7

    Our analysis underscores the relevance of water irrigation for maize grain in
    Italy and shows that water is an essential input for maize production, especially
    because of its contribution to other inputs’ productivity. Both Cobb-Douglas and
    translog-derived elasticities showed low values, implying that maize grain production
    response to water was rigid on average. However, translog estimation allowed the
    detection of synergies between water and other inputs, highlighting the mutual
    dependence between water and fertilizers, which can enhance the contribution of
    both inputs to maize grain production (Hernández et al., 2015, Sadras, 2005, Zhou
    and Turvey, 2014). The same phenomenon occurs for water and work, suggesting the
    importance of water in more intensive production systems. Conversely, the negative
    relationship between water and pesticides suggests a positive contribution of
    water to maize grain quality and a reduction in sanitary risks (Medina et al.,
    2015, Wu et al., 2010). Lastly, the climate variables demonstrate no significant
    contribution. This finding aligns with Di Paolo and Rinaldi''s (2008) observation
    that in Mediterranean regions, rainfall alone may not substantially impact maize
    grain production without supplemental irrigation water.13 The estimation of the
    water shadow price indicates water’s contribution to crop productivity and assesses
    its economic value. The derived estimated average value stands at 0.29 €/m³ and
    the median at 0.20 €/m³. This analysis is based on a national sample of detailed
    microeconomic data; therefore, this variability could influence the average shadow
    price. Italy is characterized by strong territorial, climatic, and pedologic heterogeneity.
    Therefore, the median value is a more robust indicator. Our results are in line
    with the water shadow price obtained by Veninga (2017), whose value ranges between
    0.19 and 0.53 $/m³ (0.18 and 0.50 €/m³) and D’Odorico et al. (2020), who estimate
    water value as the farmers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for a marginal unit of irrigation
    water and show a global average price of 0.16 $/m³ (approximately 0.15 €/ m³).
    Finally, Bierkens et al. (2019) also estimated the same average price for maize
    grain in Italy. All these works analyzed less recent data and estimated irrigation
    water shadow prices at the country scale; hence, a comparison must be made carefully.
    The same is true for studies that rely on different approaches and focus on the
    same crop. Berbel et al. (2011) estimated a shadow price of 0.07 €/m³ while Ziolkowska
    (2015) and El-Gafy and El-Ganzori (2012) estimated a value ranging between 0.004
    and 0.12 €/m³ for Texas and Kansas, respectively. Finally, de Brito and de Azevedo
    (2022) showed a higher value (0.14 $/m³) in Brazil, and Kiprop et al. (2015) estimated
    a price of 0.13 €/m³ in Kenya. The estimated water shadow price is also consistent
    with the current pricing imposed by WUAs,14 the primary organization responsible
    for the distribution of irrigation water in Italy. However, it should be noted
    that WUA tariffs mainly aim to recover water delivery and distribution costs.
    Considering the estimated shadow price as an indication of water pricing would
    be inaccurate, our price could be viewed as an estimate of water resource value,
    not accounting for water-related costs, externalities, or opportunity costs as
    WFD requires. However, any pricing imposed above the marginal productivity level
    would present a potential constraint for the producer, considering that according
    to our estimation, total water productivity accounts for one-third of the maize
    average gross output. In such a scenario, farmers would have to choose between
    reducing water usage, which could lead to a loss of production, and optimizing
    the overall production process by reducing water usage and adopting novel technologies
    in the long term.15 The results of these strategies depend on local and regional
    characteristics as well (Hatfield et al., 2011). Shadow price heterogeneity could
    reflect multiple scenarios and even water availability or efficient usage; a higher
    price reveals a water shortage or lower efficiency in water allocation, while
    a lower price reveals the opposite. Considering the first quartile (Q1), that
    is, farms not constrained by water availability, the Geographic Area does not
    show a significant difference. In contrast, the altimetric area shows that the
    water shadow price decreases with increasing altitude levels, reflecting greater
    water availability for Hill and Mountain. This result could also highlight the
    greater productivity of water in traditional maize-growing areas, such as Po Valley.
    In contrast, where water is scarce, this constraint mainly affects the most productive
    areas (Northern Italy). At the Q1 level, Farm Management shows a higher price
    for Mainly Employed Labor and Mainly Family Labor farms, revealing greater efficiency
    in Family-Run farms and Subcontracting or Only Employed Labor farms, which is
    in line with the findings of Speelman et al. (2008). Instead, at the Q3 level,
    management plays a role especially in Subcontracting or Only Employed Labor farms,
    that show a significantly lower price, likely reflecting higher efficiency in
    irrigation water management. Small farms (<5 ha) were the most vulnerable in both
    Q1 and Q3, possibly because of the greater incidence of water-related costs, making
    them more susceptible to water shortages. These results are consistent with those
    of Speelman et al. (2008) and Gadanakis et al. (2015), who found that farmers
    need to develop economies of scale to be more efficient and achieve input cost
    savings. Concerning irrigation water sources, when farmers rely on groundwater,
    the marginal productivity is lower in Q1, indicating a lower shadow price compared
    to that obtained for farms relying on WUAs infrastructure. Considering that WUAs
    impose seasonal programming and farmers must schedule irrigation volumes and shifts
    before the sowing season, this result could depend on greater flexibility in irrigation
    schemes for farms relying on groundwater. WUAs usually carefully plan the irrigation
    season and the planning process typically takes into account factors such as anticipated
    water availability, crop water requirements and historical usage patterns. These
    schedules aim to strike a balance between providing a consistent water supply
    for irrigation needs and managing water resources. However, water availability
    can be highly variable, especially in regions prone to seasonal fluctuations or
    drought conditions. When water availability becomes limited WUAs may need to implement
    restrictions on water delivery. For example, they might prioritize supplying water
    for high-value crops or essential agricultural activities. As a result, there
    may be occasions when water delivery is curtailed or restricted to ensure equitable
    distribution during periods of scarcity. However, this can also reveal lower efficiency
    and suboptimal use of water resources. The main costs incurred by self-supplied
    farms concern infrastructure, delivery, and water extraction, which translates
    to fewer constraints on resource usage (Gómez and Pérez Blanco, 2012). Where farms
    are constrained by water availability or are less efficient in this input allocation
    (Q3) the most affected farms are self-supplied farms (groundwater). The use of
    a support decision tool (smart irrigation), recycling water at the farm level,
    has been proven to have a positive effect on water efficiency at the farm scale
    (Gadanakis et al., 2015) and collective action in irrigation management (Chaudhry
    (2018), seems to improve on-farm water use efficiency. However, Wang (2010) found
    that farmers adopting well, or mixed irrigation exhibited higher water efficiency
    than those using river irrigation, probably because of greater flexibility and
    less water wastage during transportation. However, these results often depend
    on social and territorial characteristics, making comparisons inappropriate. In
    summary, small and family-run farms are the most affected by water shortages,
    especially where water is already scarce. Where water is not very scarce, improving
    the efficiency of irrigation water use in farms located on the Plain can contribute
    the most to maize productivity. Concerning water irrigation sources, it must be
    highlighted that if water is scarce, thanks to seasonal planning, WUAs can probably
    guarantee farmers a more efficient water distribution and lower risks or production
    losses. Concomitantly, groundwater allows greater flexibility when water is not
    scarce, potentially leading to the suboptimal use of this resource. However, it
    has to be reminded that Italian WUAs can follow different pricing approaches:
    Northern Regions often apply a fixed cost per year or crop, while Southern Regions
    mainly use a volumetric approach. In the latter, farmers could be pushed to search
    for alternative water sources (groundwater) to reduce water-related costs and
    compensate for water scarcity (Cortignani et al., 2018). Hence, farmers’ responses
    to water shortages should be further examined when they rely on both irrigation
    sources, to establish whether a substitution or additional effect exists between
    them. For this reason, it is crucial to analyze the economic value of water in
    detail, highlighting variations and differences across territories, areas, and
    types of farms, to develop strategies to balance the economic value of water with
    its environmental significance and to ensure sustainable water usage practices
    in agriculture (Bozzola and Swanson, 2014). 6. Conclusions The results of our
    analysis have several potential applications, including establishing the relevance,
    productivity, and economic value of irrigation water and allowing for further
    methodological development. We found that water is a crucial input for making
    maize grain economically viable, emphasizing the significant dependence of this
    crop on water, and the contribution of this resource to other inputs’ productivity.
    This is particularly significant because Italy is the fourth-largest maize grain
    producer in the EU, and Northern Regions account for 85% of the Italian maize
    agricultural area. Maize plays a strategic role in several supply chains, particularly
    in Parmigiano Reggiano production, which does not allow the use of silage fodder
    (Mantovi et al., 2015). Moreover, if imposed prices surpass the value of the marginal
    productivity of water, farmers may choose to reduce irrigation water use resulting
    in losses in overall production of approximately one-third, or to replace maize
    with rainfed crops (Aldaya et al., 2023, Sapino et al., 2022). Consequently, a
    shortage in maize production could result in greater dependence on imports and
    economic losses in several Italian agricultural sectors. Moreover, our water shadow
    price estimation can assist policymakers in partially fulfilling the requirements
    of the WFD by estimating the resource value, which assesses water relevance and
    scarcity, and by identifying vulnerable areas and clusters of farms, taking into
    account Italy’s territorial and productive heterogeneity. Additionally, our estimation
    facilitates the assessment of each input’s impact on output, allowing the distinction
    between fertilizers and pesticides. Combining these results with a Mathematical
    Programming approach could lead to the estimation of flexible models, establishing
    economic, social, and environmental impacts on farms resulting from a reduction
    in chemical input use, as required by the F2F targets (Cortignani et al., 2022).
    Importantly, it should be noted that our estimation of the water shadow price
    for irrigation neglects any other economic returns derived from the overall supply
    chain; namely, it does not include the contribution of maize to downstream or
    upstream supply chains. As such, the provided estimation only indicates the direct
    economic value of water for maize production and does not reflect the full value
    of water’s contribution to the supply chain and economy. Further, our analysis
    presumes that unobserved firm-specific water productivity does not vary over time
    and does not consider external productivity shocks that could influence the level
    of inputs used by the farmer. Moreover, our analysis does not account for intertemporal
    efficiency and opportunity costs associated with water use. In specific circumstances
    where extraction costs are notably high or where externalities have a significant
    impact, the estimated shadow price in our study may be lower than in an assessment
    that includes these considerations. These limitations should be kept in mind when
    interpreting the estimated shadow price of water. In conclusion, our estimation
    serves as a starting point for further research and analysis that incorporates
    these additional factors to establish a more accurate assessment of water’s value
    and its impact on agricultural production and supply chains. Integrating social,
    environmental, and economic factors is crucial for achieving sustainable water
    use practices that account for the total value of water as a vital resource for
    agriculture and the economy. CRediT authorship contribution statement Rebecca

    by (0) 1 Indeed, water has commonly been considered a renewable resource. However,
    at the International Conference of Water Environment in 1992, it was admitted
    that the failure to acknowledge the economic value of water has led to waste and
    inefficient use of this resource (ICWE, 1992). 2 WFD makes of FCR principle one
    of its pillars: in Article 9 it is stated that Member States must take account
    of the principle of recovery of the costs of water services, including environmental
    and resource costs in accordance with the “polluter pays” principle. This, with
    the aim to provide an adequate incentive for users to use water resources efficiently.
    This incentive had to be given through the adoption of effective economic instruments
    of pricing, and, as underlined by Gallego-Ayalal et al. (2011), volumetric pricing
    has primarily been seen as the most suitable tool, since accurate water-metering
    is considered a necessary condition to estimate appropriate costs for water usage
    in agriculture. See Berbel and Expósito (2020) for an overview on WFD water pricing
    and cost recovery. 3 In fact, the European Court of Auditors in 2021 published
    a special report stating that past CAP policies have failed to promote sustainable
    water use in agriculture (ECA Special Report 20/2021, Sustainable water use in
    agriculture: CAP funds more likely to promote greater rather than more efficient
    water use). 4 Distinct approaches are employed such as linear programming (Dayananda
    et al., 2023, Esmaeili and Shahsavari, 2015, Liu et al., 2009, Schmitz et al.,
    2013, Shi et al., 2014, Weerahewa and Dayananda, 2023), revealed preference models
    (Pérez-Blanco and Gutiérrez-Martín, 2017) and positive mathematical programming
    (Lionboui et al., 2018, Rodríguez-Flores et al., 2019). 5 Among others, Baniasadi
    et al. (2020) and Jana (2018) use several methods, including production function,
    to obtain water shadow price to monetize environmental impacts of excessive groundwater
    extraction in Iran and the use of wastewater in aquaculture. 6 Although not exhaustive,
    Table A1 in the appendix illustrates the diversity of functional forms, variables,
    and contexts used in recent irrigation water valuation research. This highlights
    the complexity and context-specific nature of the studies considered. 7 The National
    Association of Management and Protection Consortia for Land and Irrigation Waters
    (ANBI) estimates that approximately 59.47% of the national territorial surface
    is covered and managed by WUAs. 8 see Dono et al. (2019) and INEA (2011) for a
    comprehensive overview of irrigation sector in Italy. 9 The source used for climate
    data is the ISTAT database (Italian National Institute of Statistics) for the
    years 2010–2020. 10 We assume the separability of precipitation and temperature
    variables from the other production inputs in our model. This assumption is based
    on the spatial and temporal scales at which these environmental factors are measured.
    Specifically, they are calculated as annual averages at the provincial level,
    and as such, do not represent moment-to-moment variations in weather that might
    directly interact with other production inputs. Instead, these variables serve
    to characterize the broader climatic landscape or ecosystem within which the farms
    operate. In this context, they are conceptually distinct from the production inputs,
    thus justifying their separable treatment. 11 The marginal productivity of water
    is unlikely to be affected by productivity or “innovation” shocks that could affect
    the efficiency of this input in maize production over-time. 12 Excluding year-level
    fixed effects results in minor, statistically insignificant changes to the parameters,
    except for the climatic variables, which in that specification become indeed significant
    (see Table A3). 13 Rainfed maize production is not widely observed in Italy, and
    this can be attributed to the predominance of intensive production methods and
    specific climatic and soil conditions. 14 Tariffs for irrigation vary widely and
    are influenced by individual WUAs and regional regulations. In Northern Regions,
    they are based on irrigated or irrigable areas, while in Central and Southern
    regions, they depend on water volume or irrigated crops in compliance with the
    Water Framework Directive. In addition, tariffs can take various forms, including
    flat rates, volumetric rates, or tiered structures and some WUAs also impose fixed
    annual fees to cover service access and administrative costs. On average, volumetric
    rates typically range from 0.10 to 0.40 €/m³ while the cost per m3 of well water
    is highly variable due to factors like the well’s depth and operational expenses,
    making precise estimation challenging. 15 Among these, precision farming, digitalization,
    and more efficient management of water productivity are promising strategies (Hatfield
    and Dold, 2019), coupled with the adoption of soil conservation measures, such
    as the introduction of legume crops in modern cropping systems (Stagnari et al.,
    2017, Wreford and Topp, 2020). The most common crop management practices include
    crop cultivar diversification, scheduling of planting dates, early maturing crops,
    drought-tolerant cultivars, and crop rotation (Dono et al., 2016, Pais et al.,
    2020, Yang et al., 2019, Yang et al., 2021) © 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

    that the soil hydraulic parameters have a strong control over the bulb size. In
    particular, the soil hydraulic properties have an important effect on the downward
    vertical expansion of the bulb for both surface (CV = 15.5 %) and buried (CV =
    18.5 %) point sources. While the horizontal expansion of the bulb from the surface
    source (CV = 10.6 %) and the upward vertical expansion from the buried source
    (CV = 12.7 %) are a bit less affected. Therefore, the risk of an inadequate soil
    hydraulic characterization could be an incorrect estimate of the irrigation volume
    to be imposed, thus underwatering or overwatering the root zone.

    methods, drip irrigation represents the most efficient system to satisfy the crop
    water demand while maintaining high yield rates (Baiamonte, 2016, Provenzano et
    al., 2016). The high efficiency of drip irrigation systems is related to the small
    volume of the wetted soil compared to the entire volume of soil (Goyal, 2014).
    If well designed, the system can achieve values of water use efficiency well above
    90 % (Autovino et al., 2016). Besides the correct design, it is important that
    the irrigation system is correctly managed (Barragan et al., 2010). Autovino et
    al. (2016) proposed a methodology to evaluate the optimal irrigation volume of
    a crop based on the crop production function, field distribution uniformity and
    economic evaluations. This approach, however, does not consider the spatial variability
    of soil hydraulic properties. Knowledge of water dynamics during drip irrigation
    is of crucial importance for the design of efficient systems. The wet bulb should
    develop just in the zone where the active roots are present, thus enhancing root
    water uptake and reducing water losses by evaporation or percolation (Fernández-Gálvez
    and Simmonds, 2006, Kandelous and Šimůnek, 2010a, Kandelous and Šimůnek, 2010b,
    Subbaiah, 2013). Reaching this issue is necessary to maximize water use efficiency,
    thus saving water in agriculture management contexts. Moreover, predicting bulb
    size is expected to allow for appropriate choices concerning subsurface emitters’
    depth, and emitters’ spacing. The lateral movement of water away from a dripper,
    compared to its depth of penetration, is determined by the relative importance
    of the soil hydraulic conductivity and sorptivity (Revol et al., 1997). It is
    widely recognized that the volume of the bulb, its shape, and the spatial distribution
    of soil moisture under micro-irrigation vary with irrigation volume and soil hydraulic
    properties (Lafolie et al., 1989, Lubana et al., 2004). Therefore, the ability
    to predict the size of the wetted bulb is important, both to ensure efficient
    irrigation and to avoid the environmentally deleterious drainage of irrigation
    water below the root zone (Nakayama and Bucks, 1986, Keller and Bliesner, 1990).
    Since the exact wetting pattern and moisture distribution depend on many factors,
    including initial soil conditions, emitter flow rate, irrigation volume, frequency
    and root distribution pattern, different methods to estimate the wetted bulb size
    were developed (Subbaiah, 2013). The wetting pattern can be obtained through direct
    measurements or estimated by infiltration models. To estimate the wetting front
    distance from a surface or subsurface dripper, several approaches have been proposed
    that rely on empirical, analytical, or numerical models (Lubana and Narda, 2001).
    The empirical models are developed from regression analysis, dimensional analysis
    an artificial neural network (Singh et al., 2006). These models are simple and
    do not need specific knowledge of the soil hydraulic properties. However, the
    reliability of the results is strongly affected by the dataset used for their
    calibration/validation process. As a consequence, their use for soils different
    from those for which the models have been developed should be conducted with caution.
    The analytical models allow determining the horizontal and vertical dimensions
    of the wetting pattern through a solution of differential equations generally
    derived under simplified assumptions for the geometry and the initial and boundary
    flow conditions (Subbaiah, 2013). The strength of these models is represented
    by their relative simplicity of use associated to accurate solutions. Subbaiah
    (2013) defined the analytical models as “irreplaceable” since they can provide
    a direct insight into the physics of unsaturated flow, especially when dealing
    with the effects of several parameters. The numerical models are based on the
    solution of the Richards (1931) equation. Unlike empirical or analytical models
    (Broadbridge et al., 2017, Baiamonte et al., 2023), they offer greater flexibility
    thus allowing a realistic simulation of natural flow systems under different initial
    conditions and imposed boundary constraints. However, numerical models require
    a detailed knowledge of the soil hydraulic properties of soils, expertise and
    experience in use and can be computationally intensive. Philip (1984) provided
    a closed-form dimensionless solution in spherical polar coordinates for the travel
    time of a marked particle emitted from a buried infiltration point source and
    a surface point source. Several authors have applied different models to study
    the effect of emitter discharge rate, initial soil moisture and soil texture on
    the size of the wetting pattern (Ayers and Westcot, 1985, Thorburn et al., 2003,
    Al-Ogaidi et al., 2016). These studies are based on the assumption of homogeneous
    soil with uniform initial moisture content. However, due to structural heterogeneities
    (i.e., biological and structural macropores, cracks), the soil hydraulic properties
    exhibit both small- and large-scale spatial variability that may influence the
    wetted bulb size (Warrick, 1998). Regalado and Muñoz-Carpena (2004) investigated
    the spatial variability of the saturated hydraulic conductivity, Ks, of a drip
    irrigated volcanic soil. Depending on the measurement method (laboratory, Guelph
    and Philip-Dunne permeameters) and the flow dimensionality, coefficients of variation
    (CV) from 5.7 % to 72.4 % for saturated hydraulic conductivity were detected.
    Due to the spatial variability within a field, simulation of a single mean wetting
    pattern for drip irrigation may not be sufficient to design an irrigation system
    efficiently. For this reason, when designing a localized irrigation system, it
    is important not only to know the average soil hydrodynamic properties but also
    their variability. Several spatial variability studies of saturated and unsaturated
    hydraulic conductivities of agricultural soils have been conducted by different
    researchers (e.g., Das Gupta et al., 2006), while the influence of the spatial
    variability of soil hydraulic properties on the water dynamics during drip irrigation
    has been poorly addressed. The BEST (Beerkan Estimation of Soil Transfer parameters)
    procedure of soil hydraulic characterization (Lassabatère et al., 2006) appears
    a good candidate method to simply describe variability of soil hydrodynamic properties
    in drip irrigated soils (Mubarak et al., 2009). This topic is of great relevance
    because neglecting or improperly considering the influence of the soil hydraulic
    characteristics in irrigation management, can negatively affect water saving,
    which deserves more and more attention in the next few years. This study aimed
    at assessing the impact of soil hydraulic properties on predicting infiltration
    and wetting front from point sources located both on the soil surface and buried
    into the soil. By using an already available large data set of soil hydraulic
    parameters measured in an untilled and no-trafficked citrus orchard (Typic Rhodoxeralf),
    where the soil was classified as mostly sandy-loam or loam, the impact of the
    range of variability of the soil hydraulic properties on the development of the
    wetting front was investigated. Soil variability effects on the bulb geometric
    variables, for both buried and surface point sources, were also analysed. 2. Theoretical
    background 2.1. Soil hydraulic characterization The cumulative infiltration curve
    obtained by a beerkan run, which consists in repeatedly applying a fixed and small
    water volume on the soil surface and recording the infiltration time of each water
    volume, can be used to determine the soil hydraulic properties by the so-called
    BEST procedure of soil hydraulic characterization (Lassabatère et al., 2006).
    In particular, the BEST-steady algorithm yields and estimate of soil sorptivity,
    S (mm h−0.5), and saturated soil hydraulic conductivity, Ks (mm h−1), using the
    intercept, bs (mm), and the slope, is (mm h−1), of the straight line fitted to
    the data that describe steady-state conditions on the cumulative infiltration,
    I (mm), versus time, t (h), plot (Bagarello et al., 2014): (1) (2) in which A
    (mm−1) and C are constants that, for an antecedent volumetric soil water content,
    θi, less than 0.25 times the volumetric water content of the saturated soil, θs,
    can be set at (Haverkamp et al., 1994, Lassabatère et al., 2006): (3a) (3b) where
    Δθ is θs - θi, r (mm) is the radius of the infiltration surface and γ and β are
    coefficients commonly assumed equal to 0.75 and 0.6, respectively. The macroscopic
    capillary length, λc (mm), that expresses the relative importance of capillarity
    over gravity forces during water movement in unsaturated soil, is given by White
    and Sully (1987): (4) where b is a dimensionless capillary scale parameter frequently
    set equal to 0.55 and ΔK is the difference between Ks and the initial soil hydraulic
    conductivity, Ki (mm h−1). Low λc values (e.g., 0 < λc ≤ 10 mm) indicate a dominance
    of gravity over capillarity and are typically found in coarse-textured or highly
    structured porous media. Instead, high λc values (i.e., >1000 mm) indicate the
    dominance of capillarity over gravity, as found in many fine-textured or poorly
    structured porous media. According to Di Prima et al. (2020), λc can be obtained
    from a steady-state beerkan infiltration run as follows: (5) 2.2. Wetting patterns
    for surface and subsurface drip irrigation Under the assumption of homogeneous
    soil hydraulic properties, for buried and surface infiltration point sources,
    Philip (1984) provided closed-form dimensionless solutions for the travel times
    of marked particles. For particular cases of the considered spherical polar coordinates
    (R, ϕ) (Fig. 1), ϕ = 0, π (vertical direction) and ϕ = π/2 (horizontal direction),
    these solutions are very simple, and although implicit with respect to the geometric
    variables denoting the size of the expanding bulb, allow assessing the impact
    of soil hydraulic properties on the predicted infiltration and on the related
    wetting front advancement, which is compulsory for the appropriate design of drip
    irrigation systems. Download : Download high-res image (82KB) Download : Download

    source (Fig. 1a) and horizontal and downward, s0 (cm) and zdn (cm), for surface
    source (Fig. 1b), are indicated. For both cases, these geometric variables do
    not explore the entire bulb size. However, it is expected that they provide an
    exhaustive analysis of the effect of the variability of soil hydraulic parameters
    on the bulb expansion since it is possible to consider that all the other points
    belonging to the bulb have a similar behaviour. In order to limit water losses,
    the design and management of a buried irrigation system must ensure that the value
    of zup will not exceed the water line installation depth, while the sum of zdn
    and ze should not exceed the rooting depth. In the case of surface irrigation,
    it is important that the value of s0 is as limited as possible to reduce the evaporating
    soil surface and, also in this case, that zdn value should not exceed the rooting
    depth. On the other hand, low s0 values could compromise the necessary overlap
    of the wetting bulb and the root zone. For this reason, the calculation of these
    four lengths will be treated in detail below. 2.2.1. Dimensionless parameters
    According to Philip (1984), the dimensionless travel time T can be defined as:
    (6) where (m−1) is the parameter of the exponential hydraulic conductivity function
    by Gardner (1958), q (mm3 h−1) is the source strength, i.e. the emitter flow rate,
    t (h) is the irrigation time, V (L) is the water volume applied by the emitter,
    and ̅ = θav – θi, where θav (cm3 cm−3) is the average volumetric water content
    in the soil behind the wetting front and θi (cm3 cm−3) is the initial volumetric
    water content before wetting. In this investigation, θav was approximated as (θs+θi)/2.
    A certain approximation in the choice of the water contents to be used for calculating
    ̅ was unavoidable, also considering that definitions do not seem univocal. For
    example, the water content at the wetting front was assumed as the θ value when
    K was equal to 1 mm day−1 by Cook et al. (2003) and 1 mm h−1 by Thorburn et al.
    (2003). The α parameter in Eq. (6) is the slope of the ln K vs. soil water pressure
    head, h, relationship by Gardner (1958). For a Gardner soil (Youngs et al., 1993),
    α could potentially be estimated from the K values corresponding to any two values
    of h. In general, estimating α requires fitting the hydraulic conductivity model
    to a set of K(h) data. Taking into account that, with drip irrigation, an initially
    nearly dry soil is wetted up to near saturation, the range of interest of h is
    rather wide, varying from very negative (dry soil) to little negative or nearly
    null (wetted soil) values. This circumstance has to be taken into account if λc
    is used to determine α (e.g., Thorburn et al., 2003) since α describes the entire
    hydraulic conductivity function but λc decreases as θi increases (White and Sully,
    1987). Therefore, a determination of λc, and hence α = λc−1, performed in an initially
    wet soil can be expected to yield a different result than that of an experiment
    performed in an initially dry soil. In particular, a wet soil could yield a larger
    α value than a dry soil. For both buried and surface sources, the dimensionless
    downward size, Zdn, is denoted as (Fig. 1): (7) whereas, for the buried and the
    surface sources, the dimensionless upward size and horizontal size are denoted,
    respectively: (8) (9) where zup (cm) and s0 (cm) are the corresponding dimensional
    variables. 2.2.2. Dimensionless relationships For a buried source, the dimensionless
    solutions of the wetting front travel-time provided by Philip (1984) are: (10)
    (11) whereas for a surface source the following relationships were derived (Philip,
    1984): (12) (13) 2.2.3. Dimensional relationships A great advantage of the above-mentioned
    dimensionless solutions derived by Philip (1984) lays in the reduced number of
    parameters contained in them. Therefore, it is easy to interpret the effect of
    proportional variations of one variable on the other. For the purpose of this
    study, which aims at detecting the impact of the soil hydraulic parameters on
    bulb sizes, the same relationships reformulated in dimensional terms are necessary
    to investigate the impact of the soil hydraulic properties. In particular, for
    the buried source, associated with Eq. (10) and Eq. (11), we obtain: (14) (15)
    whereas for the surface source, associated with Eqs. (12) and (13), we derive:
    (16) (17) The water volume applied by the emitter, V, was considered as a dependent
    variable, so that any combination of the emitter flow rate, q, and the irrigation
    time, t, can be explained by V. The above dimensional relationships also allow
    practical applications, as determining the water volumes required to achieve an
    assigned vertical bulb length. For surface sources, Eq. (16) solves this issue,
    whereas for buried sources, (14), (15) need to be combined. Putting Eqs. (14)
    and (15) as equal yields: (18) From Eq. (18), an implicit equation linking zdn
    and zup, which does not depend on ̅ , can be derived: (19) For a given water volume,
    V, Eq. (19) allows estimating the total vertical length for the buried source
    (zup + zdn)buried. Eq. (14) or Eq. (15) are used to determine zup or zdn. Then,
    Eq. (19) is solved for the other unknown variable (zdn or zup). Applications of
    the above dimensional relationships take into account the influence of the soil
    hydraulic properties simply with the α parameter. Consequently, by applying the
    reformulated Philip’s model it is possible to estimate the variability of the
    bulb expansion by having a dataset relating to the spatial variability of the
    α parameter which can be obtained with simplified approaches e.g. BEST procedures.
    3. Materials and methods The field experiment was performed at the Agricultural,
    Food and Forest Sciences Department of the University of Palermo (Italy), in a
    no-tilled and no-trafficked citrus orchard with trees spaced 4 m × 4 m apart (coordinates
    33S 355511E 4218990N). The soil at the field site (Typic Rhodoxeralf) has a relatively
    high gravel content and it is mostly sandy-loam or loam down to a depth of at
    least 0.30 m. This soil has been chosen since it is representative of the agricultural
    area around Palermo city (Sicily) where the prevailing crop is citrus orchard
    mostly irrigated with surface and subsurface drip irrigation systems. Data for
    this investigation were collected in an area of approximately 200 m2, in which
    the soil had mainly a loam texture, according to the USDA classification system
    (clay = 15.4 %, silt = 36.2 %, sand = 48.4 %). The soil surface was gently levelled
    and smoothed by manual implements before sampling. To sample a bare area, the
    superficial herbaceous vegetation has been cut with a knife when it was present,
    while the roots remained in situ. Small diameter (D = 0.08 m) rings were inserted
    on the soil surface to a depth of 0.01 m for the beerkan infiltration runs. Ring
    insertion was conducted manually or by gently using a rubber hammer and ensuring
    that the upper rim of the ring remained horizontal during insertion. A total of
    56 beerkan runs were performed at randomly selected locations from May to July
    2022. For each run, 20 water volumes, each of 57 mL, were successively poured,
    each in approximately 3 s, on the confined infiltration surface by applying water
    at a small distance from the infiltration surface, i.e. approximately at a height
    of 0.03 m. Therefore, a total of 227 mm of water were applied with a beerkan run.
    Water energy was dissipated on the fingers of the hand to minimize soil disturbance
    due to water application (Reynolds et al., 2002). For each water volume (1st,
    2nd, …, 20th), the infiltration time was measured from water application to disappearance
    of all water, when the subsequent water volume was poured on the infiltration
    surface. At the beginning of a working day, two undisturbed soil cores (0.05 m
    in height by 0.05 m in diameter) were collected in three different points of the
    area at the 0–0.05 m and 0.05–0.10 m depths. These cores were used to determine
    the dry soil bulk density, ρb, and the antecedent gravimetric soil water content,
    wi, and hence θi. The means of the ρb and θi determinations were then associated
    with the beerkan runs performed on that day. Overall, 21 soil cores were collected
    for a given sampling depth. A two-tailed, paired t test was applied to compare
    the ρb and the wi values obtained at the two depths. The dataset used in this
    investigation was developed by re-analysing some of the infiltration curves obtained
    by Agosta et al. (2023). In particular, these authors performed three subsequent
    infiltration runs at a given sampling point during a nearly two-week period and
    they established comparisons between subsequent runs by considering the infiltration
    parameters of the Horton model (Horton, 1941). For each sampling point, only the
    first run was considered in this investigation since, in the other cases, the
    soil was initially too wet for applying BEST methods of data analysis (Lassabatère
    et al., 2006) or representative antecedent soil water content data were not collected
    and hence soil hydrodynamic parameters could not be calculated. For each run,
    S, Ks and λc were calculated by (1), (2), (5), respectively. The normal distribution
    hypothesis of these data was then checked with the Lilliefors (1967) test. A regression
    analysis between two datasets was performed by considering the exponential, linear,
    logarithmic and power relationships and retaining the relationship having the
    highest coefficient of determination, R2, for further analysis. A two-tailed t
    test was used to establish the statistical significance of a fitted regression
    line to the data (Glantz, 2012). All statistical tests were carried out at P =
    0.05. 4. Results and discussions 4.1. Soil hydraulic characterization The subsoil
    (5–10 cm) was less compacted and wetter than the upper soil layer (0–5 cm) (Table
    1). However, both the ρb and the wi values differed by only a little between the
    two sampling depths, that is by 0.07 g cm−3 and 0.03 g g−1, respectively. Therefore,
    differences between the two soil layers were overall small. The θi/θs ratio, with
    θs estimated from the dry soil bulk density, varied between 0.10 and 0.21. Therefore,
    BEST calculations were possible since θi/θs was steadily smaller than 0.25 (Lassabatère
    et al., 2006). In this perspective, performing beerkan infiltration runs and using
    BEST methods to analyse the data seems appropriate to obtain usable λc values
    for bulb size prediction according to Philip (1984). The reason is that the infiltration
    experiment has to be performed in an initial nearly dry soil (θi < 0.25 θs; Lassabatère
    et al., 2006) and it establishes saturated soil conditions close to the infiltration
    surface. This situation is similar to that realized by point source irrigation.
    In other words, the infiltration experiment characterizes a soil by considering
    a relevant range of θ values in the perspective to predict the size of the wetted
    bulb. Table 1. Summary of the dry soil bulk density, ρb, and antecedent gravimetric

    3.2 3.3 44.2 23.4 30.3 The hypothesis that S, Ks and λc were normally distributed
    was not rejected by the Lilliefors (1967) test. Consequently, the data were summarized
    by the arithmetic mean and the associated coefficient of variation, CV (Table
    2). The S and Ks values were rather close to those previously obtained at the
    same field site and in the same period of the year by Bagarello et al. (2023).
    In particular, these last authors obtained a mean sorptivity of 126 mm h−0.5 in
    May and of 160 mm h−0.5 in July. These mean values differed at the most by 1.2
    times from the mean S value obtained in this investigation. The corresponding
    means of Ks were equal to 194 and 158 mm h−1 and they differed at the most by
    1.4 times from the results of this investigation. The similarity between the two
    investigations suggested that the developed dataset was representative enough
    of the field site for a nearly dry or rather dry soil. Moreover, the CV of Ks
    found in this investigation was very close to that (CV = 35.7 %) obtained by another
    BEST algorithm at the same site by Bagarello et al. (2014). However, variability
    of the soil hydrodynamic parameters should be expected to vary with several factors
    including the sampling period in the year. According to (Warrick, 1998), all soil
    hydrodynamic parameters obtained in this investigation exhibited a medium variation.

    128.7 25.0 Ks (mm h−1) 35.9 410.5 227.2 37.6 λc (mm) 12.4 157.7 89.6 33.1 On average,
    capillarity was moderate since it was approximately equal to 90 mm (Table 2) and
    λc values of 42–125 mm are indicative of a moderate capillarity (Elrick and Reynolds,
    1992, Di Prima et al., 2020). This capillarity category was detected at the 89
    % of the 56 sampled points. In five cases, capillarity was strong but close to
    moderate since λc did not exceed 160 mm and strong conditions are expected for
    λc values ranging between 125 and 1000 mm. In a single case, capillarity was weak
    and close to negligible according to the ranges reported by Di Prima et al. (2020)
    since λc was equal to 12.4 mm and λc < 10 mm denotes a negligible capillarity.
    Soil sorptivity increased with saturated soil hydraulic conductivity according
    to a statistically significant relationship (R2 = 0.50, R > 0) (Fig. 2). This
    result was physically plausible taking into account that, according to Stewart
    et al. (2013), sorptivity also depends, in addition to soil capillarity representing
    the driving force, on soil hydraulic conductivity that expresses the dissipation.
    The relationships between λc and both Ks and S were weak (R2 = 0.13 and 0.19,
    respectively) albeit statistically significant. In particular, λc decreased as
    Ks increased whereas an increase of S determined an increase of λc. Even these
    results were physically convincing since low λc values indicate a dominance of
    gravity over capillarity (e.g., Di Prima et al., 2020). This dominance is more
    and more expected as the soil becomes more conductive and less sorptive. Download

    Relationships between soil sorptivity, S, saturated hydraulic conductivity, Ks,
    and macroscopic capillary length, λc (N = 56). As shown in Fig. 2, the run yielding
    the lowest λc value (12.4 mm) deviated considerably from the other runs, despite
    the generally high data scattering. This particularly low λc value was obtained
    since the cumulative infiltration curve was nearly linear from the beginning of
    the run and hence the bs intercept was small. A logical implication could be excluding
    this run from the subsequent analysis, considering the data obtained with this
    run as outliers. However, the shapes of infiltration curves can be highly variable,
    depending on many factors and processes (e.g., Angulo-Jaramillo et al., 2019),
    and Pachepsky and Karahan (2022) recently suggested that there are no reasons
    to assume that only concave and concave-to-linear cumulative infiltration curves
    can exist in nature. Moreover, BEST-steady yielded possible (i.e., positive) estimates
    of S and Ks and the calculated values of these two hydrodynamic parameters for
    this run did not deviate substantially from those obtained with the other runs
    (Fig. 2). In particular, S = 58 mm h−0.5 and Ks = 301 mm h−1 were obtained for
    the run yielding the smallest λc value and, without this data point (N = 55),
    the calculated S and Ks values were in the range 58–207 mm h−0.5 and 36–411 mm h−1,
    respectively. Finally, λc was very low but physically possible (Di Prima et al.,
    2020). Therefore, there was not any strong reason to exclude this apparent outlier
    from the subsequent analysis. 4.2. Wetting patterns For a reasonable value of
    the water volume applied by the emitter during one irrigation, V = 10 L, which
    could be ascribed to q = 2.1 L h−1 flow rate and 4.76 h of the irrigation time,

    the considered dataset, and for V = 10 l, frequency distribution of zup and zdn,
    for the buried source, and of s0 and zdn, for the surface source. For both buried
    and surface sources, Fig. 3 shows that zup and s0 appear a little less influenced
    by the soil property variability, expressed by ̅ , than zdn, as quantified by
    the coefficient of variation CV that for buried sources equals CV(zup) = 12.7
    % and CV(zdn) = 18.5 %, whereas for surface sources CV(s0) = 10.6 % and CV(zdn)
    = 15.5 %. Moreover, according to the α outlier (81 m−1), zdn = 73.7 cm and 74.7 cm,
    for buried and surface sources, respectively, occurred. The latter suggests that
    for high α, buried sources provide vertical bulbs that do not expand appreciably
    above the burial plane, contrary to what is observed in other cases. Bulb sizes
    were investigated in some detail, by considering the 56 sampling points, each
    characterized by ̅ . Taking into account that ̅ varied only a little in this investigation
    (N = 7, mean = 0.246 cm3 cm−3; CV = 4.3 %), each sampling point was only characterized
    by its α value. Applications were performed by varying the irrigation volume,
    V (L), which depends on both the emitter flow rate and the irrigation time. For
    the entire dataset, (18), (19) buried source, and Eqs. (20) and (21), for a surface
    source, were log-log plotted against α for different V values (5, 10, 20, and
    30 L) in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. Download : Download high-res image (129KB)

    variables, a) for a buried source and b) for a surface source, versus the α parameter,
    for different irrigation volumes. For the considered soil and for any V, Fig.
    4 shows that, for a buried source, zdn > zup, while, for a surface source, zdn
    > s0, indicating an elongated shape of the bulb, which becomes more and more outstretched
    at increasing α, according to a quite potential power law. Contrarily to zdn that
    increases with α, zup (Fig. 4a) and s0 (Fig. 4b) decrease with α, evidencing as
    obvious that when gravity forces increase as compared with capillarity forces
    (Reynolds and Elrick, 1991), the bulb expansion upwards for buried sources and
    laterally for surface sources tends to be limited. Of course, the bulb expansion
    increases at increasing the irrigation volume, and a quite similar power law shape
    is maintained. In Fig. 4, it is also interesting to observe that for any fixed
    α, by varying V, for both buried and surface sources, the range of variability
    of zdn is higher than that of s0 and zup, respectively. Only in the first stages
    of irrigation (low V and low α), the bulb shape is more spherical than stretched
    down, while the opposite result is obtained for high V. To compare the total bulb
    vertical length of buried and surface sources, the dimensionless ratio between
    the sum zup + zdn for buried source, (zup + zdn)buried, and zdn for surface source
    (zdn)surface was evaluated for the entire data set, by imposing different irrigation
    volumes. Fig. 5a shows the ratio (zup + zdn)buried/(zdn)surface versus α for different
    V. The total bulb vertical length (zup + zdn)buried results higher than (zdn)surface
    indicating the advantages in water saving due to adopting subsurface irrigation
    where buried emitters also wet the soil upwards. However, this benefit tends to
    vanish at increasing α (Fig. 5a) achieving (zup + zdn)buried values close to (zdn)surface,
    and more and more as the irrigation volume increases. For any α, the benefit appears
    more relevant in the first stages of the irrigation, that is when small water
    volumes have been supplied. Download : Download high-res image (93KB) Download

    versus the α parameter, for different irrigation volumes. For surface sources,
    the bulb shape index (zdn)surface/(s0)surface was also considered (Fig. 5b). In
    this case, the bulb shape index follows an increasing quadratic function of α.
    Furthermore, the increasing irrigation volume provides higher bulb shape index,
    since during irrigation the bulb elongates downward more and more. From an irrigation
    system design point of view, it is important to predict the vertical length of
    the bulb by imposing adequate irrigation times and, importantly, by accounting
    for the spatial variability of soil hydraulic characteristics that have been displayed
    in Fig. 2. Indeed, watering times that go on longer than necessary determine water
    waste since the bulb size may overpass the root zone. For each soil sampling point,
    the geometric variables are plotted against the irrigation volume in Fig. 6a (for
    the buried sources) and in Fig. 6b (for the surface source). Except for the α
    outlier, the curves lay within a bound with an increasing width for larger irrigation
    volumes. The range of variability of the geometric variables is similar for both
    buried and surface sources but a bit narrower bound width can be observed for
    surface emitters than for buried emitters. Contrarily, the geometric bulb variables
    corresponding to the α outlier determine very different geometric variables compared
    to the other values. This result means that an uncommonly large α value may provide
    a high zdn value and hence it could imply underwatering in the root zone. Download

    variables corresponding to the α outlier is also indicated. To evaluate the impact
    of α in estimating the irrigation volume required to achieve an imposed root depth,
    applications were performed for the minimum and the maximum α values retrieved
    in the dataset (6 and 81 m−1) for a buried source. First Eq. (19) was needed to
    be used for determining the zdn and zup relationship. For the above-mentioned
    extreme α values, Fig. 7 shows the increasing relationship between (zdn)buried
    and (zup)buried, and the important effect of α. In particular, Fig. 7 illustrates
    that for a fixed zdn, e.g. 10 cm, zup = 2.5 cm occurs for α = 81 m−1, while, zup
    is three times higher (7.5 cm), for α = 6 m−1, and the relationship between zdn
    and zup is independent by the Δθ value. Download : Download high-res image (77KB)

    volumes corresponding to 30 cm and 50 cm reported in Table 3. The comparison between
    Fig. 8a and Fig. 8b makes it evident the important effect of α value when the
    desired water irrigation volume is established. Indeed, for fixed values of (zdn
    + zup)buried = (zdn)surface equal to 30 cm and 50 cm, indicated by dots in Fig.
    8 and reported in Table 3, it can be observed that for the highest α value, irrigation
    volumes much lower than those for the lowest α value are required to cover the
    imposed vertical bulb length. In terms of water saving, the benefit of subsurface
    drip irrigation can be observed for both α values, requiring less water volumes
    for buried sources than for surface sources, with a lesser extent for the highest
    α value. Table 3. Irrigation volumes, V (L), required to achieve bulb vertical
    lengths equal to 30 cm and to 50 cm, for buried and surface emitters. Bulb vertical

    soils characterized by high α values, gravity forces play a predominant role compared
    to capillarity, therefore the bulb takes on a more elongated shape. While in soils
    characterized by low values of α capillary forces dominate the flow and the bulb
    shape is more spherical. However, in heterogeneous soils, for a correct design
    and management of the irrigation system, an adequate determination of the variability
    of the α parameter is even more necessary because water irrigation volumes established
    by only considering the highest or the lowest α value could penalize both extreme
    conditions, and a frequency analysis would be suggested, especially for high spatial
    variability. The results obtained in this study demonstrate that the total thickness
    of the wetted soil layer is highly affected by the soil hydraulic characteristics.
    The detection of the latter has important implications in irrigation scheduling
    since irrigation volumes less or greater than those determined by the suggested
    procedure may determine underwatering or overwatering respectively. In the first
    case, the root development will be confined in between a thinner depth than that
    established for the crop, in the second case irrigation water is wasted. In consideration
    of the above, predicting the variability in bulb expansion resulting from different
    soil hydraulic properties is essential to estimate the wetting patterns in trickle
    irrigation systems. Therefore, this proposed approach represents a valuable and
    straightforward method for designing more efficient irrigation systems that can
    contribute to water conservation in a context of water resource scarcity. 5. Conclusions
    In this study, a wide dataset of the soil hydraulic properties measured for a
    sandy-loam to loam soil was used to investigate the impact of their variability
    in predicting the bulb size for surface and buried emitters. To analyse the bulb
    size, the solutions provided by Philip’s (1984) model were reformulated in dimensional
    terms and were applied to the above dataset. The results showed that hydraulic
    properties influenced the geometric variables of the bulb with a similar variability
    range both for buried and surface sources. In terms of water management, buried
    source always allows water saving compared to surface source. However, in soils
    characterized by the highest values of α this benefit is less accentuated due
    to the downward vertical bulb expansion. Due to the spatial variability of the
    soil hydraulic properties, which highly impacts the bulb size, more accurate design
    procedures should be developed, avoiding to only characterize the soil in rough
    terms such as based on its textural characteristics. In other terms, the methodology
    applied in this investigation helps include the hydrological behaviour of the
    soil, which has to affect the emitters’ position in the design choice, also considering
    the crop root distribution. A forward step of the analysis could be establishing
    a link between the hydrological properties and the design variables. Likely, a
    development of the design procedure should include some kind of probabilistic
    analysis of the individually wetted soil volumes. This approach could help to
    consider, and hence to minimize, the risks of an improper design and management
    of the irrigation apparatus since uncontrolled irrigation duration can cause the
    bulb vertical length to go beyond the root zone, thus wasting irrigation water.

    The paper does not consider the effects of plant roots on the wetting bulb size.
    Plant roots can absorb water from the soil, which can affect the size and shape
    of the wetting bulb.

- analysis: This study investigates the impact of the 2018-drought on concentrations
    of four selected pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, diclofenac
    and metoprolol) in surface waters in Europe, with a major focus on the Elbe and

    the spatiotemporal patterns of pharmaceuticals and assess the concentration responses
    in rivers during the 2018-drought compared to reference years. Our results indicate
    an overall deterioration in water quality, which can be attributed to the extremely
    low flow and higher water temperatures (∼ + 1.5 °C and + 2.0 °C in Elbe and Rhine,
    respectively) during the 2018-drought. Our results show an increase in the concentrations
    of carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, and metoprolol, but reduced concentrations
    of diclofenac during the 2018-drought. Significant increases in carbamazepine
    concentrations (+45 %) were observed at 3/6 monitoring stations in the upstream
    part of the Elbe, which was mainly attributed to less dilution of chemical loads
    from wastewater treatment plants under drought conditions. However, reduced diclofenac
    concentrations could be attributed to increased degradation processes under higher
    water temperatures (R2 = 0.60). Moreover, the rainfed-dominated Elbe exhibited
    more severe water quality deterioration than the snowmelt-dominated Rhine river,
    as the Elbe's reduction in dilution capacity was larger. Our findings highlight
    the need to account for the impacts of climate change and associated increases
    in droughts in water quality management plans, to improve the provision of water
    of good quality for ecosystems and sectoral needs.

  description: Hydrological droughts are expected to increase in frequency and severity
    in many regions due to climate change. Over the last two decades, several droughts
    occurred in Europe, including the 2018-drought, which showed major adverse impacts
    for nature and different sectoral uses (e.g. irrigation, drinking water). While
    drought impacts on water quantity are well studied, little understanding exists
    on the impacts on water quality, particularly regarding pharmaceutical concentrations
    in surface waters. This study investigates the impact of the 2018-drought on concentrations
    of four selected pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, diclofenac
    and metoprolol) in surface waters in Europe, with a major focus on the Elbe and
    Rhine rivers. Monitoring data were analysed for the period of 2010–2020 to estimate
    the spatiotemporal patterns of pharmaceuticals and assess the concentration responses
    in rivers during the 2018-drought compared to reference years. Our results indicate
    an overall deterioration in water quality, which can be attributed to the extremely
    low flow and higher water temperatures (∼ + 1.5 °C and + 2.0 °C in Elbe and Rhine,
    respectively) during the 2018-drought. Our results show an increase in the concentrations
    of carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, and metoprolol, but reduced concentrations

    Abstract Hydrological droughts are expected to increase in frequency and severity
    in many regions due to climate change. Over the last two decades, several droughts
    occurred in Europe, including the 2018-drought, which showed major adverse impacts
    for nature and different sectoral uses (e.g. irrigation, drinking water). While
    drought impacts on water quantity are well studied, little understanding exists
    on the impacts on water quality, particularly regarding pharmaceutical concentrations
    in surface waters. This study investigates the impact of the 2018-drought on concentrations
    of four selected pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, diclofenac
    and metoprolol) in surface waters in Europe, with a major focus on the Elbe and
    Rhine rivers. Monitoring data were analysed for the period of 2010–2020 to estimate
    the spatiotemporal patterns of pharmaceuticals and assess the concentration responses
    in rivers during the 2018-drought compared to reference years. Our results indicate
    an overall deterioration in water quality, which can be attributed to the extremely
    low flow and higher water temperatures (∼ + 1.5 °C and + 2.0 °C in Elbe and Rhine,
    respectively) during the 2018-drought. Our results show an increase in the concentrations
    of carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, and metoprolol, but reduced concentrations
    of diclofenac during the 2018-drought. Significant increases in carbamazepine
    concentrations (+45 %) were observed at 3/6 monitoring stations in the upstream
    part of the Elbe, which was mainly attributed to less dilution of chemical loads
    from wastewater treatment plants under drought conditions. However, reduced diclofenac
    concentrations could be attributed to increased degradation processes under higher
    water temperatures (R2 = 0.60). Moreover, the rainfed-dominated Elbe exhibited
    more severe water quality deterioration than the snowmelt-dominated Rhine river,
    as the Elbe''s reduction in dilution capacity was larger. Our findings highlight
    the need to account for the impacts of climate change and associated increases
    in droughts in water quality management plans, to improve the provision of water
    of good quality for ecosystems and sectoral needs. Graphical abstract Download

    1. Introduction Hydrological droughts are one of the most devastating natural
    disasters, which have severe impacts on ecological and environmental aspects of
    the affected region in terms of both water quantity and quality (Ahmadi et al.,
    2019). Hydrological droughts occur when river flow and water storages in lakes,
    reservoirs or aquifers fall below normal levels (Prudhomme et al., 2013; Trenberth
    et al., 2013). Droughts are triggered due to a precipitation shortage and increased
    evaporation (meteorological drought) and can propagate through the hydrological
    system, affecting soil moisture (agricultural drought), groundwater, and surface
    waters (Dai, 2012; van Loon and Van Lanen, 2012). Studies have shown that over
    the next 50 years, most of the world''s major rivers are projected to show large
    increases in the frequency and severity of hydrological drought conditions due
    to climate change (Hirabayashi et al., 2008; Mosley, 2015; Prudhomme et al., 2013).
    The 2018-drought in north-western Europe was one of the most severe droughts this
    century, with long periods of high temperatures (July–August) in Germany (maximum
    39.5 °C) (DWD annual report 2018) and the Netherlands (maximum 38.2 °C) (van der
    Wiel et al., 2021). This resulted in extreme low flow conditions in the Elbe and
    Rhine rivers (Buras et al., 2020; Mallast et al., 2020) and significant adverse
    impacts on various sectors, such as irrigation, drinking water, and energy (Naumann
    et al., 2021). Although the effects of recent droughts on water quantity (e.g.
    discharge and groundwater levels) have been extensively studied, it is important
    to emphasize that surface water quality can also deteriorate during these extreme
    events (Wright et al., 2014). Most studies on the impact of streamflow drought
    on river water quality focused on physical-chemical parameters, such as temperature,
    salinity (Jones and van Vliet, 2018), nutrients and inorganic micro-pollutants
    (Mortazavi-Naeini et al., 2019; Mosley, 2015). However, research on the response
    in pharmaceutical concentrations in rivers during these drought events is scarce
    (Palma et al., 2020; Sjerps et al., 2017; Wolff and van Vliet, 2021). The presence
    of pharmaceutical active compounds in surface water (i.e. streams, rivers, lakes,
    and reservoirs) is a growing concern because most of these substances are difficult
    to remove through wastewater treatment processes. These processes are not designed
    to eliminate contaminants of emerging concern from. wastewater, posing challenges
    and potential adverse impacts on ecosystems and drinking water quality when concentrations
    exceed water quality standards for aquatic ecosystem health and drinking water
    production (Deo, 2014). The high production and extensive use of pharmaceuticals
    result in the continuous release of these compounds into surface waters (Tang
    et al., 2021). In the European Union, >3000 different pharmaceuticals from various
    therapeutic classes are used for human applications (Patel et al., 2019). Furthermore,
    a comprehensive analysis revealed the detection of over 713 different pharmaceutical
    active compounds and 127 transformation products in surface waters globally, with
    concentrations exceeding detection limits. Among these active compounds, 16 (e.g.,
    diclofenac, carbamazepine, and ibuprofen) were identified in surface water, groundwater,
    and even in purified potable water across all regions of the world (Aus der Beek
    et al., 2015). The overall concentrations in surface waters are low (range ng.L−1
    - μg.L−1) and sometimes below the detection limit (limit of detection on average
    2 ng.L−1) (Aus der Beek et al., 2015). However, the ecotoxicological effects that
    these low concentrations can have on the aquatic environment and drinking water
    potential are of major concern (Sjerps et al., 2017). This is particularly the
    case for pharmaceuticals that act like conservative substances, which are substances
    that are highly persistent in the environment and have characteristics that are
    resistant to biological or biochemical degradation. The major contributors of
    pharmaceuticals in surface water are from point sources such as wastewater treatment
    plants (WWTPs), waste streams from hospitals and sewage treatment plants (STP)
    (Deo, 2014; Lin et al., 2008; Tang et al., 2021), with households, residential
    care homes, and healthcare services being the most important sources of pharmaceuticals
    (Mackuľak and Brandeburová, 2019). WWTPs treat wastewater through a combination
    of biological, chemical, and physical treatments. However, not all pharmaceuticals
    are completely removed. Persistent pharmaceuticals in treated wastewater are then
    discharged into surface waters (Tang et al., 2021). Furthermore, it should be
    noted that pharmaceutical compounds have the potential to undergo transformation.
    Various chemical and biological processes can transform the pharmaceuticals and
    transformation products during wastewater treatment (e.g. hydrolysis, oxidation,
    de-conjugation, photodegradation) (Rapp-Wright et al., 2023). Transformation products
    can have the same toxicity as their parent compound when the active substructure
    (toxicophore) remains intact with transformation. In some cases, the transformation
    can generate new toxicophores, potentially leading to increased toxicity in similar
    doses (e.g. sulfamethoxazole and N4-acetyl-sulfamethoxazole) (de Jongh et al.,
    2012; Escher and Fenner, 2011). Moreover, transformation compounds can transform
    back to the parent compound which may increase the pharmaceutical concentrations
    in the effluent, compared with the concentrations observed in the influent (Rapp-Wright
    et al., 2023). Most studies concerning pharmaceuticals have investigated the removal
    efficiency in WWTPs (e.g. Khasawneh and Palaniandy, 2021), environmental risk
    assessment regarding the occurrence of pharmaceutical active compounds in the
    aquatic environment (e.g. Meyer et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2009) and processes
    affecting pharmaceutical concentrations such as dilution (e.g. Guzel et al., 2018;
    Palma et al., 2020), bio-chemical degradation (e.g. Osorio et al., 2012; Zind
    et al., 2021) and adsorption (e.g. Daneshvar et al., 2010; Petrovic et al., 2011).
    However, these studies generally neglect the impact of drought on pharmaceutical
    concentrations. During streamflow droughts, emissions from point sources are less
    diluted, potentially resulting in increased concentrations of some pharmaceutical
    compounds in surface waters (Mosley, 2015; Osorio et al., 2012; Wolff and van
    Vliet, 2021; van Vliet et al., 2023). Additionally, reduced streamflow can lead
    to longer residence times due to lower flow velocity. The combination of reduced
    water volumes and higher air temperatures often leads to elevated water temperatures,
    potentially altering processes like decay of organic matter and respiration (Mosley
    et al., 2012). However, our understanding of the complex and dynamic behaviour
    of pharmaceuticals across multiple river basins during these extreme events remains
    limited. This is partly due to the lack of monitoring data of pharmaceutical concentrations
    during droughts, although some river basins, such as the river Rhine and Elbe
    in Europe, show potential based on their data availability for studying these
    impacts. This study therefore aims to analyse the impacts of the 2018-drought
    on concentrations of four selected pharmaceuticals in the Rhine and Elbe rivers
    in Europe. Here, we focus on four pharmaceuticals belonging to four therapeutic
    classes: anti-epileptics (carbamazepine), antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole), β-blockers
    (metoprolol), all of which are conservative substances, and the anti-inflammatory
    (diclofenac), which is a labile substance, to capture a range of concentration
    responses during droughts. The first part of this study focuses on the analyses
    of the spatiotemporal patterns of the selected pharmaceuticals by evaluating publicly
    available water quality monitoring data for major river basins in Europe spanning
    the period of 2010–2020. Additionally, the second part of the study aims to assess
    the impact of the 2018-drought on the selected pharmaceuticals for the Rhine and
    Elbe rivers, and to quantify the influence of two external factors (i.e. river
    flow changes and water temperature) on the responses in pharmaceutical concentrations
    during this extreme event. Here we statistically analysed the responses based
    on high-frequency monitoring data obtained from 12 monitoring stations located
    in the German part of the Rhine and Elbe rivers for 2010–2020. This is achieved
    by comparing the pharmaceutical concentrations during the 2018-drought to concentrations
    under normal hydrological conditions (reference years 2014–2020) with similar
    levels of pharmaceutical contamination. 2. Methods 2.1. Data collection Five different
    databases on European and river basin levels were used to obtain monitoring data
    of pharmaceuticals concentrations (Table 1). Data requirements were set to determine
    suitable river basins for this study. Monitoring stations had to have at least
    monthly measurements of pharmaceutical concentrations over multiple years. Both
    databases per river basin (e.g. Elbe, Rhine and Danube) and on the country level
    were considered. Each database has a different time period and frequency of pharmaceutical
    concentration measurements. Despite these variations, all databases provide instantaneous
    measurements of pharmaceutical concentrations (in μg.L−1) (Table 1). Moreover,
    data presented in published articles or reports were not used in this study, as
    high temporal pharmaceutical monitoring series were required to compare the 2018-drought
    with reference years. Table 1. Pharmaceutical, discharge and water temperature

    2008-2019 Daily The analysis focuses on four pharmaceuticals: carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole,
    diclofenac, and metoprolol. This selection of pharmaceuticals is based on the
    following criteria: availability of concentration data on at least a monthly level,
    characteristics of pharmaceuticals including both conservative (i.e. carbamazepine,
    sulfamethoxazole, and metoprolol) and labile (i.e. diclofenac) substances, previous
    detection (Filipe et al., 2017; Kovalakova et al., 2020; Sathishkumar et al.,
    2020; Yuan et al., 2019), ecotoxicological relevance such as antibiotics (e.g.
    sulfamethoxazole) (Kovalakova et al., 2020) and anti-epileptics (e.g. carbamazepine)
    (Oropesa et al., 2016), and their classification as contaminants of emerging concern
    (see Supplementary Table S1, which shows the predicted no-effect concentrations
    ‘PNEC’ value). Carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, and metoprolol are pharmaceuticals
    that exhibit low removal rates in wastewater treatment processes (Palma et al.,
    2020). Additionally, degradation rates, sorption capacities, and biotransformation
    capabilities are also low for these selected pharmaceuticals except for diclofenac
    (Mandaric et al., 2019; Palma et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2019). This leads to
    the accumulation and persistence of these pharmaceutical compounds in the environment.
    Spatial patterns of the data availability for each pharmaceutical compound over
    the 2000–2020 period (Fig. 1) show that a large number of concentration measurements
    are available for multiple major river basins (e.g. Rhine, Elbe, Danube, Meuse,
    and Seine). However, drought impact analyses were only feasible for the Rhine
    and Elbe rivers, as these were the only river basins with a sufficient amount
    of pharmaceutical concentration data. Statistical analyses of the responses in
    pharmaceutical concentrations under drought were therefore focused on the Rhine
    and Elbe basins. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download

    (Elbe). Blue dots represent the discharge stations closest to the water quality
    monitoring stations. 2.2. Study area The Elbe and Rhine are two major rivers located
    in Central and Western Europe (Fig. 1b). The Elbe river rises high in the “Riesengebirge”
    (Giant Mountains) in the Czech Republic and enters the North Sea near Cuxhaven
    in Germany (Wiegel et al., 2004). The Elbe flows over a distance of 1090 km with
    a drainage basin of 148,268 km2, of which two-thirds (∼100,000 km2) is located
    in Germany and one-third is in the Czech Republic (Huang, 2012). The Rhine river
    rises in the Swiss Alps and enters the North Sea in the Rhine-Meuse Delta near
    Rotterdam with an approximate length of 1230 km (Leuven et al., 2009). The drainage
    basin has an area of approximately 185,000 km2, with roughly two-thirds (120,000
    km2) in Germany and covering a large portion of Switzerland and the Netherlands
    as well as parts of France, Luxemburg, and Belgium (van der Weijden and Middelburg,
    1989). The climate of the Elbe basin can be described as humid and temperate,
    while the Rhine basin has a temperate and marine climate. There is an annual precipitation
    of 592 and 700 mm and an average temperature of 9.0 °C and 10.0 °C for the Elbe
    and Rhine, respectively (Pfeiffer and Ionita, 2017). The headwaters of the Elbe
    and the largest tributary in the Czech Republic (Vltava) have a snowmelt-dominated
    regime, while the largest tributary in Germany (Saale) has a rain-dominated regime.
    Other major tributaries include the Mulde and Schwarze Elster (Wiegel et al.,
    2004). From May until November most of the discharge of the Rhine is meltwater
    originating from the Swiss part of the river catchment. From December till May
    the river is, however, rainfall dominated as most of the precipitation in the
    Alps is retained as snow. The major tributaries are the Main and Mosel (Uehlinger
    et al., 2009). 2.3. Drought identification The 2018-drought was characterized
    by long periods of extreme low flow conditions in Germany and the Netherlands
    and high temperatures (July–August), resulting in a compound drought-heatwave
    event (van der Wiel et al., 2021). It was one of the hottest years recorded in
    Germany since the beginning of the weather recordings in 1881 (Mallast et al.,
    2020). The number of summer days in 2018 was 74 days (air temperature > 25 °C),
    with remarkably high temperatures (> 30 °C) during the period from the end. Of
    July to mid-August (DWD annual report 2018, accessed 2023). Furthermore, next
    to the high temperatures, there was a precipitation deficit with an average of
    250 mm between June–December in the Elbe and Rhine basins (van der Wiel et al.,
    2021), resulting in all time low water levels recorded in the Elbe river (Mallast
    et al., 2020). Consequently, due to the combination of high air temperatures and
    a severe precipitation deficit, the June–October months can be seen as the most
    extreme period of the 2018-drought, with a mean recurrence time of approximately
    30 years (Sluijter et al., 2018). Streamflow droughts can be defined considering
    both the magnitude and timing of low river discharges or by when the discharge
    is below a given threshold (Laaha et al., 2017). For this study, the constant
    threshold method is used and is defined based on when the daily discharge is lower
    than the 20-percentile (van Loon and van Lanen, 2012; Laaha et al., 2017). The
    threshold is calculated per monitoring station over the period 2012–2020 and 2011–2019
    for the rivers Elbe and Rhine, respectively. Daily discharge (m3.s−1) and water
    temperature data were obtained at each of the selected monitoring sites from multiple
    databases (Table 1). To compare the 2018-drought with average (non-extreme) hydrological
    regimes, four reference years were selected as they overall represent common hydrological
    conditions and similar pharmaceutical concentrations. The 2018-drought began in
    the first week of June and continued until the end of autumn. Therefore, this
    research will focus on the June–October period for the 2018-drought and compare
    it to the June–October period of the reference years. For the Elbe, the reference
    years are 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2020 and for the Rhine the reference years are
    2014, 2016, 2017 and 2019. The year 2015 for both rivers and 2019 for the Elbe
    river were excluded as references as those were also relatively dry years (Supplementary
    Table S2). The median and average discharges and the total amount of days that
    the discharge is below the 20-percentile threshold were compared between the drought
    period (June–October of 2018) and the corresponding period of the reference years.
    Furthermore, the median water temperatures of the 2018-drought were compared to
    the individual reference years for the period June–August. 2.4. Monitoring stations
    in the Rhine and Elbe The study area contains the German part of the river catchments.
    Five sites for the Elbe and six sites for the Rhine river were identified as having
    suitable data availability (i.e. at least monthly measurements) for this study
    (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table S3). Pharmaceutical data for both rivers are investigated
    at the following monitoring stations: Schmilka, right bank (km 3.9 from Czech
    border), Dommitzsch, left bank (km 172.6), Zollenspieker (km 598.7), Seemanshöft
    (km 628.9) and Brunsbüttelkoog (km 694.0) along the Elbe. For the Rhine we focussed
    on the monitoring stations Weil am Rhein (km 165.0 from Lake Constance at the
    Swiss-German border), Worms (km 443.0), Mainz (km 498.0), Koblenz/Rhine (km 590.0),
    Bad Honnef (km 632.0) and Bimmen (km 858.0 at the Dutch-German border) (Fig. 1b).
    Most stations have monthly measurements of pharmaceutical concentration data available
    from 2010 onwards (see Supplementary Table S3). One additional monitoring station
    alongside the Elbe (Zehren, left bank 89.6 km) is used, although this station
    only has data available for carbamazepine (weekly level). Daily mean discharge
    (m3.s−1) and water temperature (°C) data were obtained at each of the selected
    monitoring sites (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S3). However, only four sites
    (Schmilka, Zehren, Dommitzsch and Zollenspieker) out of the six sites from the
    Elbe where adequate pharmaceutical data was available had an appropriate availability
    of discharge measurements for analysis. Since discharge is not directly measured
    at all water quality monitoring stations, we utilize discharge measurements from
    nearby discharge stations (blue dots in Fig. 1b). These discharge stations are
    located in Schmilka (Schöna), Zehren (Riesa), Dommitzsch (Torgau), and Zollenspieker
    (Neu Darchau), respectively. All discharge stations are in a range of 50 km upstream
    or downstream from the monitoring stations (as this is the range of a medium river
    basin where the discharge is still representative). Additionally, daily mean discharge
    (m3.s−1) and water temperature (°C) data for the Rhine are directly measured at
    all six selected water quality stations. For all stations along the Elbe the pharmaceutical
    concentrations are measured monthly, except for carbamazepine at Schmilka, Zehren
    and Dommitzsch where the concentrations are measured on a weekly basis. For the
    stations Weil am Rhein, Worms and Mainz along the Rhine pharmaceuticals are measured
    bi-weekly, while for Koblenz, Bad Honnef and Bimmen the pharmaceutical data is
    measured at a monthly timestep. Not all reference years are available for some
    pharmaceuticals and monitoring stations. Therefore, the stations where more than
    two reference years are missing have been excluded from the analysis (Supplementary
    Table S3). 2.5. Analyses of drought impact on pharmaceuticals The spatial patterns
    of the four pharmaceuticals are analysed for all the available monitoring stations
    in Europe with available data for the 2018-drought. The study period 2010–2020
    was selected to estimate the overall average pharmaceutical concentrations. Moreover,
    as the drought study focusses on the Elbe and Rhine rivers, the temporal patterns
    within these river basin areas were analysed in greater detail. The pharmaceutical
    data for the June–October period during the 2018-drought were compared to the
    selected reference years (i.e. 2014, 2016, 2017, and 2020 for the Elbe and of
    2014, 2016, 2017, and 2019 for the Rhine). For the analysis, samples with pharmaceutical
    concentrations below the limit of detection (LOD) or quantitation (LOQ) were replaced
    by values equal to half the individual detection limit (Mandaric et al., 2019;
    Sjerps et al., 2017; Wolff and van Vliet, 2021). To test whether pharmaceutical
    concentrations during the 2018-drought deviated significantly from the reference
    periods, descriptive statistics (e.g. mean, median, standard deviation) were used.
    The Mann-Whitney U test and unpaired t-test were performed to assess whether differences
    in pharmaceutical concentrations were statistically significant with a 95 % confidence
    level (Jones and van Vliet, 2018; Pereira et al., 2017; Wolff and van Vliet, 2021).
    In the case of a non-normal distribution (p < 0.05) (tested by the Shapiro-Wilk
    test (Mandaric et al., 2019; Wolff and van Vliet, 2021)), the correlation between
    the variables can be quantified using the Mann-Whitney U test. Otherwise, if the
    data are normally distributed (p > 0.05), an unpaired t-test can be performed.
    Furthermore, considering both the ecotoxicological and drinking water quality
    perspectives, it is unwanted to exceed the target concentrations for pharmaceuticals
    and water temperature outlined in the European River Memorandum (ERM) by the Internationale
    Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Wasserwerke im Rheineinzugsgebiet (IAWR) et al. (2020).
    The ERM represents a collective agreement among 170 European drinking water companies
    operating within major European river basins (i.e. Rhine, Elbe, Danube, Meuse,
    etc) to establish minimum quality criteria for river water. It is important to
    note that surpassing the ERM target value does not carry legal consequences. However,
    these targets are set with high standards in line with precautionary and sustainability
    principles. Additionally, they take into consideration the effectiveness of natural
    treatment methods. Maintaining the composition of river water below these ERM
    target values enables the utilization of natural purification methods for drinking
    water preparation (IAWR et al., 2020). Consequently, the ERM target values, which
    are set at 0.1 μg.L−1 for all four pharmaceuticals and 25 °C for water temperature,
    were used as basis to evaluate the impact of the 2018-drought by looking at the
    magnitude, frequency, and duration of the exceedance of this ERM target value.
    Finally, relationships between the measured pharmaceutical concentrations and
    the corresponding measurements of river discharge and water temperature were established.
    This was done for the 2018-drought (January–December) and the corresponding reference
    years for each river basin. The conservative nature of some pharmaceuticals, such
    as carbamazepine, suggests that their concentrations in surface water can be described
    as a simple function of both river discharge and emission load (Sjerps et al.,
    2017). Considering the relatively stable nature of point source emissions (i.e.,
    background concentration and emission load) for the pharmaceuticals within the
    limited time period analysed in this study, changes in discharge are expected
    to mainly influence the concentration responses by affecting chemical dilution.
    The effects of variability in discharge on water quality is estimated by fitting
    an empirical relation between pharmaceutical concentrations and discharge based
    on van der Weijden and Middelburg (1989) (see Supplementary Eq. 1). However, the
    concentration of pharmaceuticals in surface waters is influenced by various processes,
    including degradation, transformation, and sorption, which are all temperature
    sensitive. Therefore, the dependency between the pharmaceutical concentrations
    and water temperature was also assessed using multiple linear regression analyses.
    The goodness of fit for both relationships is described by the squared correlation
    coefficient (R2), which specifies the proportion of variability in pharmaceutical
    concentration that can be accounted for by changes in either discharge or temperature.
    The classification used to determine the strength of the relationship can be found
    in Supplementary Table S10. 3. Results 3.1. Hydro-meteorological drought conditions
    Two discharge stations, one downstream and one further upstream within the study
    area of the Elbe river (Schmilka-Schöna and Zollenspieker-Neu Darchau) and Rhine
    river (Koblenz and Bimmen), were selected to illustrate the impact of the 2018-drought
    on river discharge compared to the reference years (2014–2020). The results indicate
    that the June–October period of 2015 was also characterized by low flow conditions
    in the Elbe and Rhine basins (Fig. 2), with notably low median discharges at all
    four monitoring stations (see Supplementary Table S2). The 2015-drought was not
    as extreme as the 2018-drought, however, it is not appropriate to consider these
    data from 2015 as reference years since they do not represent typical hydrological
    conditions. The median and average discharge values at all four stations were
    significantly lower (p < 0.05) during the 2018-drought compared to the reference
    years (Supplementary Table S2). At Schmilka, for example, the median discharge
    was 93.4 m3.s−1 during the 2018-drought whereas during the reference periods the
    median discharge values were: 173 m3.s−1 (2014), 166 m3.s−1 (2016), 121 m3.s−1
    (2017) and 186 m3.s−1 (2020) (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Table S2). For the Rhine
    near Koblenz, there was a median discharge of 808 m3.s−1, compared to the reference
    periods: 1580 m3.s−1 (2014), 1530 m3.s−1 (2016), 1280 m3.s−1 (2017) and 1380 m3.s−1
    (2019) (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Table S2). Moreover, during the 2018-drought, the
    discharge at Koblenz (Rhine) was lower than the 20th percentile threshold for
    114 days, compared to 6 days, 39 days, 18 days, and 21 days for the same period
    (Jun-Oct) of the reference years. Furthermore, at Schmilka (Elbe), the discharge
    was lower than the 20th percentile discharge for 139 days compared to 22 days,
    41 days, 78 days, and 20 days for the reference years, respectively (Supplementary
    Table S2). Similar results were found downstream for both rivers at the discharge
    station Zollenspieker-Neu Darchau (Elbe) and Bimmen (Rhine) (Fig. 2b and d) (Supplementary
    Table S2). In mid- June 2018 the discharge started to decline and stayed below
    the 20-percentile threshold until late November and early December for the Rhine
    and Elbe, respectively. Download : Download high-res image (974KB) Download :

    thresholds represent the 20-percentile line calculated per monitoring station.
    Furthermore, the drought of 2015 and 2019 for the Elbe and 2015 for the Rhine
    are included to compare with the 2018-drought. During the 2018-drought, water
    temperatures in the period June–August were increased compared to the reference
    periods for both the Elbe and Rhine rivers (Fig. 3a-d). The median water temperatures
    in this period during the 2018-drought were 22.7 °C and 22.4 °C (Fig. 3a-b) at
    the stations Schmilka and Zollenspieker (Elbe), respectively. Water temperatures
    were on average + 1.9 °C and + 1.2 °C warmer than the reference periods (June–August).
    Furthermore, the ERM target value of 25 °C was exceeded 13 out of 92 (Schmilka)
    and 15 out of 92 (Zollenspieker) times during this drought. This exceedance occurred
    during one consecutive period starting from July 19th until August 10th and July
    26th until August 9th, with maximum temperatures of 26.7 °C and 26.6 °C at Schmilka
    and Zollenspieker, respectively. For the Rhine the water temperatures were even
    higher than the Elbe for the period June–August. The ERM target value of 25 °C
    was exceeded 34 out of 92 (Koblenz) and 16 out of 92 (Bimmen) times. The longest
    period of exceedance occurred between July 15th and August 11th (total of 28 days)
    at Koblenz (maximum water temperature of 28 °C) and July 24th until August 8th
    at Bimmen (maximum water temperature of 26.6 °C). Download : Download high-res

    of drought impact on pharmaceuticals 3.2.1. Spatiotemporal patterns The spatial
    distributions of carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, diclofenac and metoprolol in
    surface waters of several European river basins are shown in Fig. 4. The majority
    of the 211 monitoring stations for carbamazepine and 82 monitoring stations for
    sulfamethoxazole are located in the river basins of the Elbe, Rhine, and Meuse,
    spanning across Germany, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. Among these stations,
    25 for carbamazepine and 12 for sulfamethoxazole concentrations exceeded the ERM
    target value of 0.1 μg.L−1. Moreover, for 83 out of 334 monitoring stations for
    diclofenac and 18 out of 126 monitoring stations for metoprolol the average concentrations
    surpassed the ERM target value of 0.1 μg.L−1. Based upon the data availability
    for the 2018-drought and reference years, the next part of the analysis focuses
    on the Elbe and Rhine rivers and the monitoring stations in the German part of
    the river basins. Download : Download high-res image (917KB) Download : Download

    (top left), sulfamethoxazole (top right), diclofenac (bottom left) and metoprolol
    (bottom right) in (μg.L−1) for the period 2010–2020. Monitoring stations where
    the concentrations are above the ERM target value (0.1 μg.L−1) are larger. The
    boxplots display the monitoring stations which show the most illustrative results
    per pharmaceutical for the Elbe and Rhine rivers for the 2018-drought and reference
    years. The spatial patterns of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole in the Elbe
    and Rhine rivers are generally similar. Analysis of monitoring data indicates
    an increase in average concentrations moving downstream (Fig. 4, see Fig. 1 for
    location monitoring stations), except for sulfamethoxazole, for which an opposite
    spatial distribution can be observed in the Elbe basin (see Supplementary Table
    S4). Specifically, the lowest average concentrations of carbamazepine are measured
    at the monitoring station Schmilka (0.048 μg.L−1) (Fig. 4) with concentrations
    increasing until Seemanshöft (0.091 μg.L−1). After Seemanshöft, concentrations
    decrease, with an average concentration of 0.072 μg.L−1 at Brunsbüttelkoog (Supplementary
    Table S4). Similarly, carbamazepine exhibits comparable patterns in the Rhine
    river, with low average concentration at Weil am Rhein (0.021 μg.L−1) and high
    average concentrations at Bimmen (0.052 μg.L−1) (see Supplementary Table S4).
    When looking more closely at the Elbe and Rhine rivers, the spatial patterns show
    a dynamic system, with both increasing and decreasing average concentrations between
    monitoring stations for both diclofenac and metoprolol (Fig. 4, Supplementary
    Table S4). The analysis indicates substantial fluctuations in pharmaceutical concentrations
    throughout the year, except for sulfamethoxazole, where overall consistent concentrations
    are observed throughout the years (Fig. 5c-d). The seasonal variation in pharmaceutical
    concentrations for both rivers show similar trends, with notably higher concentrations
    observed in autumn (October–December) and lower concentrations in winter months
    (January–March) for carbamazepine. These patterns were observed upstream as well
    as downstream the Elbe river (Fig. 5a-d, Supplementary Figs. S1-S4). However,
    maximum concentrations for carbamazepine at upstream monitoring stations were
    found between August and October. For the Rhine river, similar seasonal patterns
    are observed for carbamazepine (Fig. 5a-d, Supplementary Figs. S1-S4), except
    at the monitoring station Weil am Rhein, with minimum concentrations in the spring
    (April and June) during the melt season and increased concentrations in the winter
    period (January–March), when most precipitation is retained as snow and discharge
    is low. Download : Download high-res image (861KB) Download : Download full-size

    reference period. (The figures for the other monitoring stations are shown in

    and highlights the period of statistical analysis. The black horizontal line represents
    the ERM target value of 0.1 μg.L−1 (note the different values on the y-axis).
    For diclofenac and metoprolol, different seasonal patterns were observed, with
    increased concentrations in winter and autumn and decreased concentrations in
    spring and summer (Fig. 5e-h, Supplementary data Figs. S5-S8). Minimal differences
    in median concentrations between the four seasons were observed at upstream monitoring
    stations Schmilka and Weil am Rhein for both diclofenac and metoprolol. However,
    downstream of both rivers, the seasonal variation for both pharmaceuticals were
    more prominent. The highest concentrations for diclofenac and metoprolol were
    measured between January and March, with median values of 0.095 μg.L−1 and 0.119
    μg.L−1 at Seemanshöft, respectively. At Bimmen, the highest maximum and median
    concentrations for both pharmaceuticals were measured between January–March, with
    median values of 0.077 μg.L−1 and 0.076 μg.L−1 for diclofenac and metoprolol,
    respectively. 3.2.2. Pharmaceutical concentrations under drought The responses
    in carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, diclofenac and metoprolol concentrations were
    studied during the 2018-drought relative to the reference periods (June–October).
    Overall, increased concentrations were found for carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole
    and metoprolol during the summer and fall of 2018 (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5). Increased
    carbamazepine concentrations were observed at almost all monitoring stations for
    both the Elbe and Rhine rivers. The Mann-Whitney U test showed for 3 out of 6
    stations in the river Elbe (i.e. Schmilka, Dommitzsch and Zehren) statistically
    significant increases (p < 0.05) during the 2018-drought compared to the reference
    years (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. S1 and Table S6). Average concentration increases
    of +48 % (stdev 13.7 %), +41 % (stdev 19.1 %) and +47 % (stdev 25.3 %) were found
    for the monitoring stations Schmilka, Zehren and Dommitzsch, respectively, compared
    to the reference years. Likewise, most monitoring stations of the Rhine showed
    increased concentrations during the drought period compared to the reference years
    with statistically significant increases (p < 0.05) at Koblenz (+57 %) (Fig. 4,
    Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table S6). Furthermore, for the remaining monitoring
    stations statistically insignificant (p > 0.05) increases were observed although
    average concentration increases were considerable (e.g. +21 % Mainz and +23 %
    Bimmen) with respect to carbamazepine (Supplementary Table S6). The sulfamethoxazole
    and metoprolol concentrations during the 2018-drought were generally higher compared
    to the reference years (except for metoprolol compared to 2017 at Schmilka) for
    both rivers (Fig. 4). The monitoring station at Brunsbüttelkoog (Elbe) exhibited
    significantly higher sulfamethoxazole concentrations (p < 0.05) (average 0.040
    μg.L−1) compared to the reference years (average 0.026 μg.L−1) (Fig. 4, Supplementary
    Fig. S3). Furthermore, at Worms and Koblenz (Rhine) significantly higher metoprolol
    concentrations (p < 0.05) were observed compared to most reference years (Supplementary
    Table S9). The average concentrations of metoprolol for the 2018-drought were
    0.035 μg.L−1 and 0.038 μg.L−1 for Worms and Koblenz, respectively, compared to
    the average of the reference years (0.023 μg.L−1 and 0.017 μg.L−1) (Supplementary
    Table S9). The remaining stations showed mostly statistically insignificant (p
    > 0.05) changes in sulfamethoxazole and metoprolol during the 2018-drought (Supplementary
    Tables S7 and S9). In the case of diclofenac, lower concentrations were generally
    found during the drought (Fig. 4). Nonetheless, the concentration decrease was
    statistically insignificant (p > 0.05) for both rivers (Supplementary Table S8).
    Additionally, increased concentrations of carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole and
    metoprolol were observed for the months November and December (Fig. 5) in 2018,
    when the discharge of the Elbe and Rhine rivers was still below the threshold
    (Fig. 2). Overall higher concentrations were observed for all pharmaceuticals
    for the Elbe river compared to the Rhine river. For carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole,
    the ERM target value was not exceeded at monitoring stations along the Rhine river.
    However, in the Elbe river, carbamazepine concentrations exceeded the ERM target
    value for almost all monitoring stations during the 2018-drought, except for Schmilka
    and Brunsbüttelkoog where the concentrations were either below (Brunsbüttelkoog)
    or equal to (Schmilka) the ERM target value of 0.1 μg.L−1. At Seemanshöft and
    Zollenspieker, the concentration surpassed the ERM threshold for 6 out of 12 measurements
    between June and December (except August) (Supplementary Fig. S1). The highest
    concentrations of carbamazepine were recorded at Zollenspieker, reaching 0.175
    μg.L−1 (Supplementary Fig. S1). In contrast, sulfamethoxazole only exceeded the
    threshold value of 0.1 μg.L−1 once in December at Schmilka, with a maximum concentration
    of 0.120 μg.L−1. Finally, during the 2018-drought diclofenac and metoprolol did
    not exceed the ERM target values for both rivers, except once for metoprolol at
    the monitoring stations Seemanshöft and Brunsbüttelkoog (Elbe river). 3.2.3. Drivers
    of changes in pharmaceutical concentrations under drought The correlation analysis
    between pharmaceutical concentrations and river discharge for the drought and
    reference years for both rivers indicates a clear inverse C-Q relationship for
    carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole (and metoprolol for some stations alongside
    the Rhine river). This means that high pharmaceutical concentrations correspond
    with low flow conditions and vice versa, supporting the process of dilution as
    a main driving factor (Fig. 6). For the Elbe river, stronger inverse relations
    are observed upstream near Schmilka (R2 = 0.47 and R2 = 0.30; Table S5) compared
    to downstream near Zollenspieker (R2 = 0.35 and R2 = 0.06; Table S5) where the
    relations are weak to very weak (Fig. 6, Supplementary Figs. S9- S10 and Table
    S5 and 10), for carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole, respectively. For the Rhine
    river, moderate to strong relations were obtained for carbamazepine with an R2
    up to 0.68 (Koblenz), while for sulfamethoxazole the R2 ranged from 0.34 (Koblenz)
    to 0.56 (Weil am Rhein) (Supplementary Table S5 and S10). Moreover, for metoprolol,
    weak relationships were found for the upstream stations along the Rhine river
    with the R2 ranging between 0.22 (Koblenz) to 0.42 (Worms), while for all other
    monitoring stations along both rivers no clear C-Q relations for diclofenac and
    metoprolol (R2 < 0.1) were found (Supplementary Table S5). Download : Download

    for the drought year and corresponding reference years. The red dots represent
    the measurements of the 2018-drought (June–October). The black line in the concentration-discharge
    relation plot represents the relation by van der Weijden and Middelburg (1989)
    (Supplementary data Eq. 1). The black line in the concentration-water temperature
    plot represents the linear relation. As discussed in Section 3.2.1, strong seasonal
    variation was observed for diclofenac and metoprolol, with elevated concentrations
    during winter months when river flow is at its peak, and low concentrations during
    summer when river flow is at its lowest (Fig. 2 and Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig.
    S12). This suggests that factors other than river flow influence the dynamics
    of metoprolol and diclofenac. To investigate further, we examined the relationship
    between water temperature and pharmaceutical concentrations. The analysis revealed
    clear negative linear relations between water temperature and pharmaceutical concentrations
    for both diclofenac and metoprolol, with lower pharmaceutical concentrations under
    higher water temperatures and vice versa (Fig. 6). Furthermore, stronger relations
    were obtained for both the Elbe and Rhine rivers at downstream stations. For the
    Elbe, R2 ranges between 0.20 (Schmilka) versus 0.60 (Seemanshöft) for diclofenac
    and 0.13 (Schmilka) versus 0.68 (Zollenspieker) for metoprolol (Fig. 6, Supplementary
    Fig. S11). For the Rhine river, the R2 ranges between the 0.50 and 0.58 (diclofenac)
    and 0.35 and 0.55 (metoprolol), between the monitoring stations Weil am Rhein
    and Bimmen, respectively (Fig. 6, Supplementary Fig. S11). However, no clear relations
    were found between water temperature and carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole for
    both the Elbe and Rhine rivers. 4. Discussion and conclusions The 2018-drought
    resulted in extreme low flow conditions between the period June–December and increased
    water temperatures for both the Elbe (∼ + 1.5 °C) and Rhine (∼ + 2.0 °C) rivers
    (June–August) were found. During this period, higher concentrations for the pharmaceuticals
    carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, and metoprolol were observed compared to the
    reference years (2014, 2016, 2017 and 2020 Elbe and 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2019
    Rhine), whereas overall decreased concentrations were measured for diclofenac
    compared to these reference years. The varied responses of the four pharmaceuticals
    during the 2018-drought depend on their conservative or reactive characteristics.
    4.1. Drought impact on pharmaceutical concentrations The higher concentrations
    found for carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole during the 2018-drought compared
    to the reference years can be directly linked to the inverse concentration-discharge
    (C-Q) relations (Section 3.2.3). This can also account for the seasonal variability
    of both pharmaceuticals, which is in accordance with previous studies for the
    Rhine (Sjerps et al., 2017; Wolff and van Vliet, 2021) and Elbe rivers (Meyer
    et al., 2016) but also, rivers in the Mediterranean (Mandaric et al., 2019; Palma
    et al., 2020). This C-Q relation of van der Weijden and Middelburg (1989) describes
    a dilution-based model and applies to conservative compounds and substances that
    are slowly degradable such as carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, but also metoprolol
    (Kovalakova et al., 2020; Sjerps et al., 2017; Wiegel et al., 2004; Yuan et al.,
    2019). However, no significant relations were found for metoprolol in the Elbe
    river. In contrast, only weak relations with discharge were observed at monitoring
    stations located in the upstream section of the Rhine river. These findings contradict
    the previous findings of Wolff and van Vliet (2021) for the Rhine river, where
    strong relationships were observed downstream at monitoring station Lobith located
    at the German-Dutch border. Additionally, Sjerps et al. (2017) observed no substantial
    C-Q relation at Lobith. These different findings may be attributed to variations
    in the water quality databases and sampling years used in the respective studies.
    The increased concentrations found for carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole and metoprolol
    for both rivers during the 2018-drought could, therefore, be accounted for by
    a lower dilution factor. The main source of these pharmaceuticals are from WWTPs
    (Wiegel et al., 2004), with multiple large WWTPs downstream for both rivers (serving
    >500.000 people) (see Supplementary Fig. S13). In the case of the Rhine, there
    is a cluster of three large WWTPs in the Ruhr area that collectively treat wastewater
    for over 3.3 million people. Similarly, for the Elbe, there are two large WWTPs
    in Hamburg that treat wastewater for over 3 million people. During the extreme
    low flow conditions of the 2018-drought, wastewater is less diluted and when pollutant
    emissions remain constant the concentrations are increased, which agrees with
    findings of previous studies (Osorio et al., 2012; Wolff and van Vliet, 2021).
    Given that the responses in carbamazepine concentrations were not statistically
    significant at the downstream stations of the Elbe (Zollenspieker and Seemanshöft),
    increased residence time may have favoured degradation processes (Mandaric et
    al., 2019) and can explain the difference in response between upstream compared
    to downstream the monitoring stations. As the upstream flow velocity is higher
    and the residence time is lower, substances are easily transported and less likely
    to be degraded. Moreover, the concentration changes found for the other pharmaceuticals
    were overall statistically insignificant, which indicates that processes other
    than dilution may dominate. Significant relations were found between water temperature
    and both diclofenac and metoprolol, which could explain the seasonal variation
    (Section 3.2.1) as it could not be accounted for by flow changes. Consequently,
    it is most likely that the seasonal variation is caused by varying removal efficiencies
    in WWTPs and in the aquatic environment, which are highly influenced by water
    and air temperatures (Chauveheid and Scholdis, 2019; Sacher et al., 2008). Diclofenac
    is mainly removed out of the system by photo-transformation and biodegradation
    (Meierjohann et al., 2016), which can explain the overall decreased diclofenac
    concentrations during the 2018-drought compared to the reference years, but this
    depends on the physicochemical characteristics of the pharmaceutical compounds.
    Increased travel time and decreased river depth (low flow conditions) form favourable
    conditions for driving factors such as temperature, solar irradiation, and turbidity,
    which are mainly responsible for the degradation processes of diclofenac (Mandaric
    et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2019). Furthermore, the main processes responsible
    for the removal of metoprolol out of the system are biodegradation and adsorption
    (Daneshvar et al., 2010; Guzel et al., 2018). This could also explain the stronger
    relation found between water temperature and diclofenac and metoprolol concentrations
    at the stations downstream the Elbe and Rhine rivers (Section 3.2.3). Downstream
    conditions are more favourable (i.e. longer residence time) for decay and other
    processes that are temperature dependent. Although metoprolol concentrations are
    significantly influenced by processes depending on water temperatures, our results
    overall showed increased metoprolol concentrations during the 2018-drought compared
    to the reference years. Hence, this gives the impression that metoprolol is more
    dependent on discharge (dilution) than on water temperature (decay), which is
    also observed in other studies (Mandaric et al., 2019; Palma et al., 2020; Wolff
    and van Vliet, 2021). The main source of all pharmaceuticals (i.e. carbamazepine,
    sulfamethoxazole, metoprolol, and diclofenac) is from WWTPs. As there is an increase
    in WWTPs which discharge into the river Elbe (Wiegel et al., 2004) and Rhine (Burgos
    et al., 2008; Sacher et al., 2008) along these rivers (see Supplementary Fig.
    S13), overall higher concentrations are found at downstream monitoring stations
    compared to upstream located monitoring stations. Additionally, tributaries such
    as Neckar, Main (Rhine) and Saale (Elbe), which exhibit a high percentage of municipal
    wastewaters for which relatively high concentrations of pharmaceuticals have been
    found contribute to the overall contamination (Sacher et al., 2008; Wiegel et
    al., 2004). Furthermore, drought events have the potential to alter the transport
    dynamics of pharmaceutical compounds. During dry periods, pharmaceuticals may
    be temporarily retained in catchments and subsequently released during subsequent
    wet conditions, leading to intermittent pulses of pollutant transport (Mosley,
    2015; van Vliet et al., 2023). However, this phenomenon is predominantly pertinent
    to veterinary pharmaceuticals, as manure typically remains confined to agricultural
    fields during droughts. Nevertheless, our understanding of this process is limited.
    Sewer overflows also contribute to pulses of pharmaceuticals compounds to rivers,
    but these mainly occur during heavy rainstorms and floods, rather than drought
    events. Further research is necessary to investigate the impact of consecutive
    drought-heavy rainfall events (van Vliet et al., 2023). While overall the same
    pharmaceutical responses for both rivers were observed, a higher percentage reduction
    in discharge (Section 3.1) can account for a stronger water quality deterioration
    of the Elbe compared to the Rhine river. In summer and early autumn, the Elbe
    is rainfed dominated (pluvial river system), while the Rhine river is both rainfed
    and snowmelt dominated (Nival-pluvial river system) (Huang et al., 2013) resulting
    in relatively higher streamflow. During the 2018-drought, the Elbe therefore had
    a lower dilution capacity compared to the Rhine river (Supplementary Table S2),
    which resulted in higher pharmaceutical concentrations particularly for carbamazepine
    (total cumulative average of 0.095 μg.L−1 2018-drought compared to 0.077 μg.L−1
    reference years) and sulfamethoxazole (total cumulative average of 0.055 μg.L−1
    2018-drought compared to 0.048 μg.L−1 reference years). 4.2. Uncertainties Higher
    concentrations were found for several pharmaceuticals in surface waters during
    the 2018-drought, although in some cases these increases were statistically insignificant.
    Throughout this study, uncertainties may arise due to several assumptions that
    were made related to the analysis of pharmaceutical concentrations. First of all,
    uncertainties in the concentration data of pharmaceuticals required for this study
    must be considered. Concentration data were downloaded for all monitoring stations
    alongside the Elbe and Rhine river, however, no considerations were made regarding
    the method of data collection at each site. For example, the time of data sampling
    can influence the pharmaceutical concentrations due to complicated short-term
    dynamics. Brunsch et al. (2018) showed that pharmaceutical concentrations at the
    outlet of sewer treatment plants, as in the aquatic environment can fluctuate
    during the day. This can be attributed to changing weather conditions with dry
    and rainy periods succeeding each other. Nelson et al. (2011) found that daily
    concentration fluctuations could be attributed to consumption patterns. For example,
    higher sulfamethoxazole concentrations were observed in WWTP effluent during the
    afternoon, which could be linked to morning influents from waking residents. Furthermore,
    it is assumed in our study that the pharmaceutical concentrations during the study
    period were emitted to the surface water at a constant rate, with no increasing
    or decreasing trend in the human consumption. Secondly, the artificially set values
    of half the detection limit are assumed to be reliable as is widely used in other
    studies (Mandaric et al., 2019; Sjerps et al., 2017). However, it makes the measurements
    during drought and non-drought conditions less representative, as the detection
    or quantification limit can differ per pharmaceutical, monitoring station and
    year (See Supplementary Table S11). Finally, it is assumed that the concentrations
    measured during the drought and reference years are well represented despite the
    unequal number of measurements and unequal sampling throughout the years. Grab
    samples capture a specific moment, which may not represent the true temporal variability
    of the pharmaceutical concentration. Pharmaceutical concentrations can vary over
    time due to various factors such as weather conditions, flow rates, and human
    activities. Using only grab samples may not capture these fluctuations accurately.
    Moreover, grab samples might miss episodic events or peak pollution instances
    that can have a significant impact on water quality. For instance, pollution events
    caused by stormwater resulting in sewer overflows which may not align with the
    timing of grab samples, leading to underrepresentation or missed detection of
    pollution events (Brunsch et al., 2018). For instance, at the Weil am Rhein monitoring
    station there was a large water quality monitoring campaign in the years 2015
    and 2016. During this campaign the daily diclofenac concentrations were monitored
    and could be downloaded from the EEA database. In addition, the IKSR database
    only provides the bi-weekly measurements including the measured concentrations
    for the period 2015 and 2016 which corresponds to the EEA data. Fig. 7 shows the
    diclofenac concentrations in which the EEA data is plotted along with the IKSR
    data. This suggest that the bi-weekly measurements are generally a good representation
    of the seasonal variation of the diclofenac concentrations. However, the maximum
    bi-weekly concentration of the IKSR data is underrepresenting the maximum daily
    concentration of the EEA data by 30 % (0.058 μg.L−1 vs. 0.075 μg.L−1, February
    2015) and 27 % (0.079 μg.L−1 vs. 0.1 μg.L-1, December 2015), respectively. Especially
    for stations downstream where the variability in concentration during the year
    is higher (differences minimum and maximum concentrations is larger) (Section
    3.2.1), this can give an under-representation of the maximum concentrations. This
    indicates that small datasets (monthly measurements) with instantaneous measurements
    might lack the temporal resolution needed to capture fluctuations in concentrations
    over time. If significant variations occur between measurements, they could be
    overlooked, potentially leading to a misunderstanding of concentration trends.
    Moreover, the limited number of compounds investigated might not fully represent
    the entire class of pharmaceutical substances within the system, raising concerns
    about the generalizability of the results to a broader range of chemicals and
    potential impact on the aquatic environment. In addition, the study may lack some
    context as it solely focuses on concentrations without accounting for essential
    factors such as source pathways and the presence of transformation products. Furthermore,
    the study did not fully account for the presence of metabolites and transformation
    products. Consequently, when assessing the ecotoxicological impact of a particular
    pharmaceutical and only concentrating on the parent compound, this could underestimate
    the overall impact because the total concentration of the parent compound, metabolites,
    and transformation products can be much higher. Download : Download high-res image

    measuring the diclofenac concentrations for the period 2015–2016 with a different
    frequency at monitoring station Weil am Rhein (Rhine). EEA data (Blue) shows the
    daily measured concentrations, while the IKSR data (Red) shows the bi-weekly measurements.
    In addition, it is important to clarify the difference between the sampling date
    and the moment that the concentrations are measured in the laboratory. The database
    of the EEA and IKSR have the same bi-weekly measurements for the diclofenac concentrations
    at Weil am Rhein for the year 2012. However, the dates attributed to the measurements
    do not correspond between the two data bases. The data of the EEA database is
    6/7 days later than the same measurements of the IKSR. This can potentially impact
    the results by inadvertently comparing concentrations at different times, resulting
    in inaccurate assessments. For example, this can be an issue when fitting relations
    of pharmaceutical concentration with discharge or water temperature, since the
    discharge and water temperature fluctuate on daily basis. 4.3. Outlook The analysis
    of monitoring data throughout Europe spanning the 2010–2020 timeframe revealed
    that 12 %, 15 %, 25 %, and 14 % of the monitoring stations exhibited average concentrations
    exceeding the ERM target value of 0.1 μg.L−1 for carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole,
    diclofenac, and metoprolol, respectively. Despite irregular sampling throughout
    the year and variations in the frequency of measurements among different monitoring
    stations, a substantial spatial extent exists where water quality standards are
    consistently exceeded. Moreover, carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, and metoprolol
    showed increased concentrations during the 2018-drought for both the Elbe and
    Rhine rivers. The ERM target value of 0.1 μg.L−1 was not exceeded for carbamazepine,
    sulfamethoxazole, and metoprolol for the Rhine during the June–October period
    of 2018. In contrast for the Elbe, the ERM target values for both metoprolol and
    especially for carbamazepine were exceeded during the 2018-drought. The carbamazepine
    concentrations exceeded the ERM target value at four out of six monitoring stations.
    At Zollenspieker and Seemanshöft the concentrations exceeded 0.1 μg.L−1 in early
    June and remained above this threshold until January 2019. This resulted in a
    period of eight months during which the ERM target values were exceeded. For Dommitzsch
    and Zehren this was respectively shorter, where in late June the concentrations
    exceeded 0.1 μg.L−1 and fluctuated around this threshold until late November.
    During this period of severe drought, the impact on the secondary and tertiary
    economic sectors was minimal and drinking water supply was continuously maintained
    (Conradt et al., 2023). However, the effects of the drought propagated throughout
    the natural ecosystem, resulting in devastating consequences for ecosystems, as
    well as substantial economic losses in forestry and agriculture (Conradt et al.,
    2023). Studies show that long-term exposure to carbamazepine concentrations results
    in chronical diseases in aquatic vertebrates like zebrafish and rainbow trout,
    leading to reduced egg viability and altered feeding behaviour (da Silva Santos
    et al., 2018; Li et al., 2011). Furthermore, carbamazepine can cause a variety
    of toxicological effects in algae, insects, and crustacean, by affecting reproduction
    ability and behaviour (Duarte et al., 2021; Jarvis et al., 2014; Oropesa et al.,
    2016). Moreover, long-term exposure to diclofenac and metoprolol can affect the
    antioxidant defence mechanism of freshwater fish, as diclofenac is already measured
    at high toxicity levels in the liver and kidneys of fish (Sathishkumar et al.,
    2020). During the 2018-drought overall decreased diclofenac concentrations were
    however observed with concentrations also below the limit of detection (LOD <
    0.005 μg.L−1). Probably the largest concern is the widespread use and disposal
    of antibiotics, resulting in the antibacterial resistance of bacterial communities
    used for biological degradation in WWTPs. This may also result in a decrease in
    efficiency rate to remove other pollutants (Duarte et al., 2021; Larcher and Yargeau,
    2012; Oldenkamp et al., 2019). Recently, the European Commission therefore adopted
    a proposal to revise the list of priority substances in surface water for the
    European Water Framework Directive for most of these pharmaceuticals considered
    in our study (carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, diclofenac). Considering a future
    perspective, increases in the frequency and intensity of droughts are expected
    in many parts of Europe due to climate change, which may result in higher air
    and water temperatures and longer dry spells (Hirabayashi et al., 2008; Mosley,
    2015; Prudhomme et al., 2013). Additionally, the potential increase in pharmaceutical
    consumption due to a growing and ageing human population and more extensive use
    of veterinary medicine with an increasing number of livestock could further increase
    concentrations of certain pharmaceuticals compared to present-day levels (Sjerps
    et al., 2017). As a result, the concentrations may exceed the maximum ERM target
    values more often and with a higher magnitude in both the Elbe and Rhine rivers
    during future droughts, which could have major consequences for the aquatic environment
    and drinking water potential. Consequently, it is important to closely monitor
    and strongly focus on reducing the emissions of not only pharmaceuticals but also
    other contaminants of emerging concern (∼350.000 chemical compounds (Chen et al.,
    2023; Wang et al., 2020)) in the rivers. This may require: 1) expanding and optimizing
    existing wastewater treatment plants to effectively remove pharmaceutical compounds
    and other emerging contaminants from wastewater; 2) strengthening and enforcing
    regulations related to pharmaceutical and emerging contaminant waste disposal
    and effluent standards for manufacturing facilities and healthcare institutions;
    and 3) educating the public about the appropriate disposal of unused or expired
    medications to prevent improper flushing down the drain. These efforts are vital
    for safeguarding water quality and preserving aquatic life, particularly during
    future droughts. CRediT authorship contribution statement Mark P. Lentz: Conceptualization,

- analysis: 'This review summarizes the advantages, disadvantages and scope of application
    of the field measurement method, crop model simulation method, remote sensing
    estimation method, and coupling method with remote sensing and crop model by data
    assimilation for estimating WUE. The field measurement method was simple and accurate,
    but had a heavy workload and large random errors. The limited number of global
    flux towers resulted in the inability of eddy covariance techniques to measure
    WUE at continuous regional scales. Due to the lack of spatial information and
    the difficulty in obtaining various input parameters required to run crop models,
    crop models can only simulate WUE at a single point scale, but not well at the
    regional scale. There were few flux tower data for accuracy verification of remote
    sensing-based GPP and ET products, which would affect the accuracy of croplands
    ecosystem WUE estimation. Remote sensing crop distribution recognition model,
    remote sensing ET and yield estimation model provided an effective way for the
    estimation of WUE at the regional scale, and expanded the spatial scale to regional
    and local scales. However, the poor mechanistic performance of the remote sensing
    water consumption and yield estimation model resulted in low estimation interpretability
    of WUE. Using data assimilation to estimate WUE at the regional scale, combined
    a mass of remote sensing continuous spatial crop parameters with the crop model
    to simulate the dynamic growth process of the crop, and had stronger mechanistic
    interpretation. Theoretically, compared with crop model simulation method and
    remote sensing estimation method, the method based on data assimilation method
    combined with remote sensing and crop model had the highest accuracy in estimating
    regional scale WUE, because it combined the advantages of crop model and remote
    sensing technology. Luo et al. (2023) reviewed a large number of research results
    on improving the simulation ability of crop models by using data assimilation
    methods, and found that taking yield as an example, the R2 range of yield estimation
    accuracy after data assimilation was significantly improved to 0.35 ∼ 0.82 (R2
    range of single crop model simulation was 0.01 ∼ 0.471). Therefore, since the
    simulation ability of the model has been improved after data assimilation, the
    simulation accuracy of other crop indicators such as WUE, ET, LAI and other indicators
    should also be improved in addition to yield indicators. Taking the study of Wang
    et al. (2024) as an example, based on Sentinel-2 remote sensing data, CERES-Maize
    model and SCE-UA optimization, this study estimated maize WUE in Fenwei plain
    of China under the data assimilation strategy and the non-assimilation strategy
    respectively. The results showed that the accuracy of WUE simulated by data assimilation
    strategy was higher and the error was lower (Fig. 7). Therefore, the data assimilation
    method combined with remote sensing and crop model had higher accuracy in estimating
    regional scale WUE than crop model simulation and remote sensing estimation method.

    At present, WUE estimation at the regional scale is based on remote sensing technology,
    satellite remote sensing platform is commonly used but the UAV platform is rarely
    used, which cannot meet the needs of fine farmland scale. Satellite images reflect
    the instantaneous conditions of the land surface or crop canopy on the day of
    transit and are easily affected by the launch of the satellite, the transit time
    interval, and the cloud cover during the transit. Thus, satellite remote sensing
    technology is limited by low spatial and temporal resolution and is easy to be
    interfered with meteorological factors. It is difficult to meet the requirements
    of repeated field scale crop observation. However, UAVs have higher image resolution
    and are less susceptible to clouds. Therefore, satellite remote sensing or UAV
    platform should be selected according to the size of the plot. Satellite remote
    sensing is more suitable for large regional scale above hectare area, while UAV
    remote sensing is more suitable for field scale. Recently, ET separation methods
    based on multi-scale and multi-concept WUE have been established. However, the
    assumptions of different methods make them have obvious limitations in application.
    An ET separation method that can make up for the general limitations and has a
    wide application prospect needs to be developed. At present, there is a lack of
    relevant research to evaluate or compare the uncertainties of different methods,
    especially in terms of limitations. The current studies lack new methods to estimate
    WUE at the regional scale. The role of WUE estimation accuracy was underestimated
    at present. Remote sensing technology is used to estimate WUE at the regional
    scale, which overcomes the shortcomings of traditional methods, but mechanistic
    explanations are not sufficient. At present, most of the studies using data assimilation
    techniques to couple remote sensing and crop models focused on estimating crop
    yield. However, few studies apply this method to estimate crop WUE at regional
    scale. Theoretically, the method of coupling remote sensing and crop model to
    estimate WUE using data assimilation technology can improve the estimation accuracy
    of WUE at the regional scale, but it still needs to be clarified by a large number
    of studies.'

  description: Due to the impacts of climate change and human activities on scarcity
    and uneven spatial distribution of water resources, water use efficiency (WUE)
    has gained significant attention. Currently, there is a lack of research on estimating
    WUE with higher accuracy and stronger mechanism on the large regional scale. This
    study systematically reviewed the status and hotspots from an amount of studies
    and analyzed various concepts and estimation methods of WUE at different scales.
    Additionally, we discussed the limitations and challenges of these studies to
    point out the future opportunities. WUE at different scales could not be directly
    scale transferred as WUE varied at various scales. Recently, the remote sensing
    gross primary productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) products, the remote
    sensing crop distribution recognition models, remote sensing ET and yield estimation
    models have improved the accuracy of WUE estimation at the regional scale, but
    lack of mechanical explanation. However, data assimilation provided a stronger
    mechanistic interpretation of WUE estimation at the regional scale by coupling
    remote sensing data and crop models. Optimized data assimilation method for coupling
    multi-source remote sensing fusion platform, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform
    and crop model would be a better approach to quantify WUE of the large area in
    the future. It is also necessary to incorporate crop types and irrigation allocations
    into high spatial resolution crop-specific WUE modeling. Therefore, integrating
    multi-source remote sensing data, ensemble using multi-crop models, innovating
    near-real-time seamless efficient data assimilation algorithms at the regional
    scale, and refining multi-variables assimilation at different crop growth stages
    are the research hotspots in the future. This study will provide useful guidance
    for optimizing water resource management in precision agriculture and improving
    the efficient utilization of water resources.

    1. Introduction Water use efficiency (WUE) is an important indicator for coupling
    the water-carbon cycle, energy conversion, resource utilization, and global change
    (Cai et al., 2021; Hatfield and Dold, 2019; Huang et al., 2017). WUE is primarily
    concerned with the physical flow of water (Nay-Htoon et al., 2013). WUE represents
    the balance between gains (carbon acquisition or crop yield) and costs (transpiration
    and water applied) (Bchir et al., 2016). Crop WUE was used to assess the feasibility
    of agricultural water saving management schemes as a typical evaluation reference
    (Leghari et al., 2021; Liao et al., 2019; Liu and Song, 2020a). Optimizing crop
    water use by improving WUE was also a response strategy to ensure sustainable
    agricultural development in arid and semi-arid regions (Michelon et al., 2020).
    However, WUE improvement still is a challenge for agriculture in arid and semi-arid
    regions due to increasing irrigated acreage and higher water demands on crops,
    which consume about 70 % of the water available to humans (Bhattacharya, 2019;
    Jabeen et al., 2022). Disputes over water use for agriculture, industry, domestic
    use, direct human consumption, and other purposes have been increased by global
    water scarcity (Medrano et al., 2015), and these disputes will continue to spread.
    The imbalance in the spatial distribution of global water resources was accelerated
    due to climate change, frequent extreme weather events and human activities (Aoubouazza
    et al., 2013; Lang et al., 2017; Wang and Qin, 2017; Zhang et al., 2019a). With
    the aggravation of water disputes among various industries and the increasing
    imbalance in the spatial distribution of water resources, more and more studies
    focused on WUE. Higher food demand challenges caused by population growth and
    limited available water resources will lead the ultimate goal of future WUE research
    to produce more economic output with less water. Therefore, research on WUE will
    be critical to alleviating global food security, water security and ecological
    security crises. WUE was used as the subject term to search on ScienceDirect,
    and the annual number and cumulative number of WUE publications were statistically
    analyzed (Fig. S1). The results showed that: (1) over the last 10 years, the average
    number of WUE papers published per year reached 474. (2) the cumulative number
    of WUE publications in 2023 was more than 6900, a 118-fold increase compared to
    1999. The similarity analysis of high-frequency terms containing WUE in the titles
    and abstracts of the articles was conducted to obtain the clustering map of WUE
    research subject words (Fig. S2). The analysis results showed that current research
    on WUE is widely concentrated in four aspects. (1) Analysis of mainly external
    environment factors affecting WUE, including: climate change (Bagula et al., 2022;
    Nie et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2020), soil water (Han et al., 2023; Hao et al.,
    2021; Soothar et al., 2021), evapotranspiration, crop rotation (Oroo, 2021; Sainju
    et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2021b); tillage practices (Guo et al., 2020; Lin et
    al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020), fallow management (Adil et al., 2022; Williams et
    al., 2020); irrigation scheduling or strategies (Guo et al., 2022; Heidari et
    al., 2022; Lu et al., 2022), mulching technologies (Bai et al., 2022; Duan et
    al., 2021; Yin et al., 2022), fertilizer management (Moradgholi et al., 2022;
    Yang et al., 2023; Zhai et al., 2022), water fertilizer coupling (Peng et al.,
    2023; Sun et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2022); nutrient management (Ahmed et al.,
    2019; Akarsh et al., 2020; Ashoka and Shashadhar, 2020), biochar amendment (Fischer
    et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021a). (2) How to improve crop WUE
    based on field trials (Faloye et al., 2019; Fan et al., 2020; Feng et al., 2023)
    and meta-analysis (Wu et al., 2022b; Yin et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2020). We found
    that the mechanism for increasing WUE was achieved by improving photosynthetic
    capacity to reduce respiratory consumption and decreasing leaf transpiration and
    ineffective soil evaporation. (3) The impact of drought on terrestrial ecosystems,
    croplands, or crop WUE (Pei et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2021a; Zhao et al., 2020).
    (4) WUE analysis of main crops (Jiu-jiang et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2021b), especially
    some C3 and C4 crops (De Haan et al., 2021; Israel et al., 2022; Ozeki et al.,
    2022). Therefore, the analysis of external environment factors that affect WUE
    and how to improve WUE as the research hotspots of WUE has led to most review
    articles on WUE were also concentrated on reporting the factors that affect WUE
    (Fukai and Mitchell, 2022; Liyanage et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023) and the
    measures to improve WUE (Eshete et al., 2020; Kang et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2020).
    In fact, all studies on WUE have to be based on the reliable accuracy of WUE estimation.
    The accurate estimating of WUE at various levels was considered as a prerequisite
    for carrying out related research on WUE. The estimation accuracy of WUE will
    affect directly WUE mapping at the regional scale. The formation of crop WUE at
    the regional scale is described through the coupling process of crop growth and
    water cycle in the whole region (Wang et al., 2023). Thus, based on the perspective
    of water cycle, regional scale crop WUE reflects the distribution and allocation
    of water resources in crops, soil, atmosphere and the whole regional system. Moreover,
    estimating crop WUE at regional scale can help crops adapt to changing environment
    better (Ito and Inatomi, 2012). Based on the perspective that WUE at different
    scales can''t be directly transferred, high WUE at leaf and whole plant scales
    doesn''t mean high WUE at the regional scale. Most importantly, point-scale WUE
    is easier to measure and estimate with reliable accuracy, while WUE estimation
    at the regional scale is more complex and requires improved reliability for accuracy
    (Jiang et al., 2022). The role of WUE estimation accuracy has not received enough
    attention at present, and there are few studies on improving WUE estimation accuracy
    using the improvement and innovation methods of estimation WUE at the regional
    scale. There was an urgent need to pay attention to the estimation accuracy of
    WUE, so the focus of this review was to locate the perspective of the estimation
    accuracy of WUE. WUE research at all levels and scales has not been well analyzed.
    Limitations of previous research include: (1) The concept and scope of application
    of WUE in various fields were often confused and poorly defined and it was necessary
    to sort out the definition and application scope of WUE at all levels/scales.
    (2) The accuracy of the current estimation methods of WUE is still a key issue.
    Traditional methods, which containing field measurement and crop model simulation
    method, are still widely used to estimate WUE at a point scale, and there is a
    lack of improvement and expansion of new methods to estimate WUE at the regional
    scale. (3) The method of estimating WUE by remote sensing is still lacking mechanistic
    explanations. (4) At present, most of the studies focused on estimating crop yield
    by using data assimilation techniques to couple remote sensing and crop model,
    but few studies using data assimilation method to estimate WUE. The applicability
    of the data assimilation method still needs to be verified through extensive tests
    though it improved the estimation accuracy of WUE. Overall, there were still gaps
    in the estimation methods of WUE at various levels and scales, especially in improving
    the estimation accuracy of WUE at the regional scale. The objectives of our review
    were to (1) clarify the concept of WUE at different levels and scales to provide
    guidance for selecting WUE indicators in the evaluation area, (2) compare the
    advantages, disadvantages, and application scope of various WUE estimation methods,
    including the field measurement, crop model simulation, remote sensing estimation,
    and the data assimilation coupling remote sensing and crop model, and (3) suggest
    a basis for the estimation methods of WUE in the future. 2. Concept and evaluation
    indicators of water use efficiency 2.1. Concept of water use efficiency WUE is
    an important indicator for monitoring and evaluating agricultural water use (Hirwa
    et al., 2022). When researchers conducted a systematic evaluation of water use
    and decision-making of irrigation systems, various meanings of WUE were formed
    due to different research perspectives and concerns. Vites first used the term
    WUE to represent the ratio of crop yield to evaporation in 1965 (Vites, 1965)
    and it has been widely used to express the yield of a crop per unit of water (Heydari,
    2014). As research continues to develop, WUE can be defined as the ratio of crop
    biomass accumulation (CO2 assimilation/crop biomass/grain yield) to consumed water
    (transpiration/evapotranspiration/total water input, during the full growing season)
    (Kang et al., 2002; Sinclair et al., 1984). WUE considers the efficiency of engineering
    infrastructure design and is more focused on the relation between a unit of crop
    yield and water (Blatchford et al., 2019). WUE is designed to monitor the efficiency
    of water supply to cropland and the rate at which crops convert water into products,
    respectively (Kilemo, 2022). 2.2. The evaluation indicators of WUE WUE evaluation
    indicators include three levels of crop production, including leaf level (leaf
    photosynthesis rate per transpiration rate, WUEL), whole plant level (the ratio
    of total dry mass to water use, WUEp), and yield level (crop grain per unit area
    to transpiration, WUEy) (Ali and Talukder, 2008; Boutraa, 2010; Hong-Xing et al.,
    2007). Taking farmland as an example, the scale information and formula of WUE
    at different levels from leaf to yield level were shown in Fig. 1. The initial
    studies define WUE at leaf level (WUEL) in the 1960s (Bierhuizen and Slatyer,
    1965), and they were regarded as the basis of WUE at the whole plant (WUEp) and
    yield level (WUEy). WUEL is the exchange rate of water vapor and CO2 between the
    atmosphere and leaves (Gago et al., 2014). WUEL was also known as leaf transpiration
    efficiency (Farquhar et al., 1989). WUEp is the ratio between accumulated biomass
    and transpiration water during a given period (Bogeat-Triboulot et al., 2019;
    Gulías et al., 2012). WUEp depends on the total carbon capture and water loss
    of all crops, including water loss and respiration from the photosynthetic and
    non-photosynthetic parts (Cernusak et al., 2007). That means WUEp could represent
    WUE on a larger temporal and spatial scale (Flexas et al., 2010). WUEy is the
    relationship between the output of the crop yield and the amount of water input
    required (Tuong et al., 2000). WUEy is closest to the actual production and is
    regarded as the final result of WUEL and WUEp (Angus and Van Herwaarden, 2001;
    Fang et al., 2004). Higher WUE at the leaf scale, but not necessarily high WUE
    at the whole plant scale and yield scale (Kang et al., 2021). Therefore, WUE at
    different scales could not be directly scale transferred. Download : Download

    levels from leaf to yield level (take farmland for example). Note: these formulas
    in Fig. 1 were derived from literature review. (Boegelein et al., 2012; Hoover
    et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019b). According to the types
    of water input required, WUEy was evaluated with five evaluation coefficients,
    including rain-fed water productivity (RWP), generalized water use efficiency
    (GWP), crop water productivity (CWP), irrigation water use efficiency (WUEy-i),
    and irrigation water productivity (IWP). RWP was not suitable for arid and semi-arid
    regions as it only considered the impact of precipitation on crop yield. Due to
    the difficulty in obtaining field evapotranspiration data and the uncertainty
    of the accuracy of each evapotranspiration estimation model, CWP had limited its
    application in large-scale WUE evaluation. IWP represented the role of irrigation
    on crop yield and was not applied to areas with sufficient precipitation. GWP
    integrated the combined effects of precipitation and irrigation on crop yield,
    providing a better reflection on the relationship between crop yield and water
    consumption, and has a wider range of practical application. 3. Estimation method
    of water use efficiency In this chapter, the estimation methods of WUE based on
    three levels of leaf, whole plant and yield, and two spatial scales of single
    point and region were proposed. WUE estimation methods at yield level mainly considered
    the index of crop water use efficiency. Although the type of water consumed was
    different, several other indicators also have a lot in common in the yield estimation
    module. 3.1. Field measurement estimation Field measurement methods of WUE included
    direct measurement, gas exchange measurement, stable isotope technology, pot weighting
    method, and eddy correlation technology, comparison of these methods was illustrated
    in Table 1. WUE at the field scale could be obtained directly through the experimental
    observation data of field water consumption and crop yield, expressed by how many
    grams of dry matter are produced per kilogram of water. Field water consumption
    is generally calculated by coupling field energy balance and water balance. Compared
    with other methods, the gas exchange method had the smallest application range
    and was only suitable for the leaf scale. The sensitivity and accuracy of stable
    isotope technology were high, and dual-isotope calibration was used to determine
    not only crop WUE, but also water source and water use patterns. The pot weighting
    method had the narrowest limited conditions and was only applicable to potted
    plants. The eddy correlation technology was able to measure WUE at larger scales
    in all field measurement methods. Table 1. Summary and comparison of field measurement
    methods for measuring WUE at different levels and scales. (see reference in table
    Cheng et al., 2021b; Ebmeyer and Hoffmann, 2022; Liu et al., 2019; Li et al.,
    2020; Pan et al., 2022; Santos et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2020; Munjonji and Ayisi,
    2021; Sanz‐Saez et al., 2019; Al Tamimi et al., 2022; Alataway et al., 2019; Zheng
    et al., 2020; Baldocchi et al., 2021; Jiang et al., 2020; Lavergne et al., 2019).
    Although the field measurement method theoretically determines the effects of
    WUE on dry matter production more accurately than crop model simulation, it is
    difficult to determine the spatial heterogeneity of WUE at the macroscale (Liu
    and Song, 2020). It requires a lot of detailed and complicated work for WUEp and
    WUEy to estimate the consumed water and biomass by all plants. In addition, the
    field measurement method requires destructive sampling, long time consumption,
    low efficiency, small coverage, and unable to carry out continuous observation.
    Therefore, direct measurement of WUE at the whole plant and yield level by field
    measurement method remain certain difficulties and larger random errors. 3.2.
    Crop model simulation method Crop models can simulate crop water consumption.
    The popular used models include AquaCrop (Pohankova et al., 2018), CROPWAT (Luo
    et al., 2015), PolyCrop model (Tan and Zheng, 2017), DSSAT (Jones et al., 2003),
    WOFOST (Van Diepen et al., 1989), APSIM (Holzworth et al., 2014), RZWQM2 (Ahuja
    et al., 2000), WHCNS (Liang et al., 2014) and others. Driven by meteorological
    data, crop models integrate soil parameters, genotype parameters and field management
    measurements to simulate crop water consumption and yield to obtain WUE at a single-point
    scale. Crop models simulate WUE at various levels by setting different climate
    scenarios (Bagula et al., 2022; Deihimfard et al., 2018; Han et al., 2021), adopting
    various crop varieties (Seyoum et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019; Xiao et al., 2020),
    changing soil physical and chemical properties (Yang et al., 2019, 2020; Zhang
    et al., 2022), and adjusting management measures (Nie et al., 2022; Rani et al.,
    2020; Xu et al., 2020). Compared with the field measurement method, crop models
    require a large number of climate, crop, soil, and management parameters, but
    reduce the cost, manpower, material resources, and frequency of operation. The
    spatial variation of soil chemical properties, meteorological conditions, and
    canopy state variables should be considered in the crop models to avoid the uncertainty
    of crops growth process simulation on the WUE estimation at regional scales. Although
    crop models can be scaled up with the GIS technique and the application range
    of models can be expanded, the accuracy of crop models with regionalized genetic
    parameters in simulating regional scale WUE is still limited. Therefore, due to
    the lack of spatial information and the difficulty in obtaining various input
    parameters required to start the simulation (Kasampalis et al., 2018), crop models
    only can simulate the water use efficiency at the single point scale, but not
    well at the regional scale. 3.3. Remote sensing estimation method 3.3.1. Based
    on remote sensing GPP and ET products WUE estimation of croplands ecosystem is
    directly obtained by the ratio of gross primary productivity (GPP) to evapotranspiration
    (ET) (Cheng et al., 2021a; Nandy et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2023). Many studies
    analyzed the WUE of crops with GPP and ET, such as wheat-maize rotation in the
    North China Plain (Hu and Lei, 2021), rice in southern India (Oo et al., 2023),
    soybean in the USA (Chen et al., 2022). Due to the limited number and uneven distribution
    of flux towers (Jung et al., 2020), it was difficult to directly obtain croplands
    ecosystem WUE by using continuous and precise GPP and ET data from flux towers.
    Remote sensing-based GPP and ET products provide a new approach for estimating
    croplands ecosystem WUE. The major global remote sensing-based GPP products used
    for evaluating croplands ecosystem WUE were shown in Fig. 2. The results showed
    that: (1) During the period 1982–2023, the main remote sensing-based GPP products
    were classified into three types: light utilization efficiency (LUE), machine
    learning algorithms (ML), and process-based land surface model (LSM). (2) Most
    GPP products have a temporal resolution of 8-day and monthly, and a spatial resolution
    of more than 500 m. The spatial and temporal resolution of LSM type was more refined.
    (3) The earliest and longest time series remote sensing-based GPP products were
    ML and a small number of LSM types, that were, obsGPP (1982–2008, 27 years) and
    GLASS (1982–2017, 36 years) products. All GPP products of LUE type and most of
    LSM types appeared after 2000. (4) According to the number of citations, obsGPP
    was the most widely used remote sensing-based GPP products, followed by GLASS,
    BESS, VPM and PML-V2. (5) PML-V2, MOD17A2H and GOSIF products were updated faster,
    especially the MOD17A2H product has been updated until 2023. Download : Download

    for each product (right circular Venault chart, the larger the area and the darker
    the color, the more times the product has been cited). The major global remote
    sensing-based ET products used for evaluating croplands ecosystem WUE were shown
    in Fig. 3. The results showed that: (1) The water balance model (WB), process-based
    land surface model (LSM), Priestley-Taylor (PT), machine learning (ML), and Peman-Monteith
    equation combined with vegetation data (PM) were the major types of remote sensing-based
    ET products over the period 1958–2023. (2) Most ET products have a temporal resolution
    of 8-day and monthly, and a spatial resolution of more than 500 m. (3) The earliest
    remote sensing-based ET products were WB type than other types, that was, Terra
    Climate products, with the longest time series from 1958 to 2020 (63 years). PT
    and ML appeared after 1982, while LSM and PM appeared at the latest after 2000.
    (4) According to the number of citations, GLDAS was the most widely used remote
    sensing-based ET products, followed by MTE, MOD16A2, Terra Climate and GLEAM products.
    (5) GLDAS and MOD16A2 products have been updated the fastest, reaching 2023, followed
    by Terra Climate, GLEAM v3, GLASS v4.0 and PML-V2 products. Download : Download

    bar chart), contributor (references section) and the number of citations for each
    product (right circular Venault chart, the larger the area and the darker the
    color, the more times the product has been cited). Many existing GPP and ET products
    could not meet the requirements of high spatio-temporal resolution and long time
    series at the same time, and the use of different products varies greatly. The
    few flux tower data were used to verify GPP and ET products, this will affect
    the accuracy of WUE estimation. In addition, due to the complexity of the croplands
    ecosystem, a single GPP and ET product could not well represent the carbon-water
    relationship of all systems. Therefore, it is necessary to construct GPP and ET
    combination datasets, screen suitable GPP and ET products, strictly distinguish
    and refine vegetation types, and estimate ecosystem WUE under different vegetation
    types. 3.3.2. Based on remote sensing ET estimation model and yield estimation
    model Crop WUE can be estimated indirectly at the regional scale by the synergistic
    effects of the remote sensing-based crop distribution recognition model, remote
    sensing-based ET model and yield estimation model (Jiang et al., 2022). Accurate
    identification of crop types is an important prerequisite for WUE estimation.
    The working principle of the remote sensing crop distribution recognition model
    is to analyze spectral information, vegetation index and texture characteristics
    from time-series remote sensing data and images, track the evolution of crop reflection
    characteristics during growth, extract distinct time features for various crops,
    and classify them by classification model to distinguish crop types (Gumma et
    al., 2022; Sun et al., 2019). The current mainstream remote sensing crop distribution
    recognition models based on different classification methods were shown in Fig.
    4. Each classification method has its own advantages, limitations and application
    scope. Therefore, comprehensive consideration of multiple classification methods
    for crop type identification can achieve better accuracy results. Download : Download

    crop distribution recognition models for different classification methods. After
    constructing the remote sensing crop distribution recognition model, crop WUE
    at the regional scale can be estimated through the remote sensing ET and yield
    estimation model (as shown in Fig. 5). The temperature-based ET models are simpler,
    but the limitations are in producing spatiotemporal continuum ET fields under
    variable cloud conditions. The conduction-based ET models may be more accurate
    in the future, but these models rely heavily on satellite precipitation and soil
    moisture data that are least accurate when vegetation is dense) (Chen and Liu,
    2020). Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 5. Organization diagram of crop WUE estimated by remote sensing method.
    Note: Remote sensing evapotranspiration model was adapted form Chen and Liu (2020).
    The remote sensing yield estimation models have been developed from the original
    data-driven model (empirical statistical model and light use efficiency model)
    to the process-driven model (crop model, considering the mechanism of crop growth
    and development), and even to the multi-process-driven model (coupling model).
    The coupling model can be obtained by the integration of the radiation transport
    model, hydrological land surface model, light energy utilization rate model, crop
    model and other process-driven models. Due to the limitations of various models
    and the complexity of crop yield formation processes, the coupling model will
    perform better because it considers more comprehensive yield estimation processes.
    The combined effects of the remote sensing crop distribution recognition model,
    remote sensing ET and yield estimation model provided an effective way for the
    estimation and quantitative evaluation of crop WUE at the regional scale. Jiang
    et al. (2022) used MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) index to
    extract phenological characteristics, established maize recognition model based
    on pixel classification method in Hetao irrigation district, and adopted the hybrid
    dual-source scheme and trapezoid framework-based ET (HTEM) estimation model and
    the Stewart water production function for yield estimation to evaluate maize WUE
    in three counties of Hetao irrigation district. Jin et al. (2018a) extracted phenological
    parameters based on MODIS NDVI index, combined with support vector machine (SVM)
    algorithm to classify winter wheat in the Loess Plateau, estimated regional ET
    based on the improved Priestley-Taylor method, and used light use efficiency model
    (LUE) to estimate winter wheat yield and quantify the synergistic relationship
    among winter wheat yield, ET and WUE. Compared with the field measurement method,
    remote sensing estimation of WUE saved a lot of manpower and material resources
    and was more efficient and faster. In contrast to crop model simulation for WUE
    estimation at the site scale, the method of using remote sensing to estimate WUE
    expanded the spatial scale to regional and local scales. However, the uncertainty
    of remote sensing ET and yield estimation results also influences the accuracy
    of WUE estimation. The biggest source of such uncertainty was the measurement
    error of remote sensing data, and reducing this uncertainty was the key to improving
    the estimation accuracy of WUE. 3.4. Remote sensing and crop model data assimilation
    method In order to make up for the limitation of using remote sensing technology
    or crop model alone to estimate WUE, many studies used the data assimilation method
    to combine the advantages of remote sensing and crop models for estimating WUE
    (Li et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2022a). The schematic process
    of data assimilation between remote sensing and crop model was shown in Fig. 6.

    6. Schematic representation of WUE estimated by using data assimilation between
    remote sensing and crop model. The data assimilation system for estimating regional
    scale WUE constructed in Fig. 6 consisted of remote sensing observation, dynamic
    crop model and data assimilation method, the specific implementation process was
    shown as follows: (1) First, remote sensing observations (or inversions) parameters
    were obtained. Regional monitoring and sampling of cropland systems were conducted
    through satellite and UAV remote sensing to obtain regional remote sensing crop
    canopy and land surface observations (or inversion) parameter information. Such
    as leaf area index (LAI), soil moisture (SM), evapotranspiration (ET), land surface
    temperature (LST), biomass (BM), leaf nitrogen accumulation (LAN), the dry weight
    of roots (WRT), vegetation index (VIs, such as enhanced vegetation index (EVI),
    normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), vegetation temperature condition
    index (VTCI), etc.), gross primary productivity (GPP), reflectivity (λ), canopy
    cover (CC), the green leaf area index (GLAI), plant height (PH), crop phenology
    (PHE) and other parameters. (2) Second, the simulated values of the state variables
    were obtained. The input variable data required by the crop model was prepared,
    including weather, soil, crop genetic parameters and field management data, and
    the crop model was calibrated and verified with the field observation data. Corresponding
    to the parameter information of remote sensing observation (or inversion), crop
    model can also obtain these parameter information through simulation, and they
    were all called state variables, which were the key to integrating remote sensing
    and crop models to estimate yield, ET and crop WUE. (3) Then, the remote sensing
    observations (or inversions) were integrated into the crop model by data assimilation
    methods, such as the forcing method, parameter calibration method or updating
    method. Through spatial interpolation of input data and single point assimilation,
    the crop model was operated to obtain simulated values of state variables. Based
    on the continuous data assimilation process between remote sensing observations
    and crop model, the state variables were updated and the crop parameters were
    optimized. Crop model outputted the simulation results of yield, ET and WUE at
    the single point. (4) Finally, grid by grid assimilation was used to estimate
    crop yield, ET and WUE at the regional scale, and the assimilation accuracy was
    verified with official statistics. Data assimilation methods between remote sensing
    and crop model were mainly composed of the forcing method, calibration method
    and updating method (Wang et al., 2013). Based on the assumption that the remote
    sensing observations were true values and more accurate than simulated values,
    the forcing method argued that remote sensing can provide higher accuracy for
    state variables and obtain better estimation results (Jin et al., 2018b). Thus,
    the forcing method directly replaced or adjusted remote sensing data with crop
    model simulate variables (Kasampalis et al., 2018). Clevers et al. (2002) continuously
    forced LAI values of winter wheat obtained from SPOT data and CLAIR semi-empirical
    model into ROTASK crop model to estimate more accurate yield and LAI and better
    described this method. The calibration method was to adjust the initial values
    and parameters of the crop model to minimize the cost function of the distance
    between the remote sensing observation and the model-simulated state variables,
    and makes the simulation closer to the observations by running a recalibrated
    set of new parameters or initial values (Wagner et al., 2020). By iteratively
    adjusting the initial value of the model parameters or the state variables, the
    cost function was finally minimized and the optimal parameters were obtained (Huang
    et al., 2015). Root mean square error, least squares, three (or four)-dimensional
    variational and optimization algorithm can be used to construct cost functions.
    The updating method was a method that constantly updated crop model simulation
    data by changing the posterior distribution values of state variables according
    to remote sensing observations when remote sensing data acquisition was feasible
    (Dorigo et al., 2007). The process of the updating method was to assimilate the
    state variables obtained from remote sensing observation and model simulation
    into the continuously running mode, and the above processes were repeated when
    a new observation state variable was encountered (Zhao et al., 2013). The estimated
    value of the state variable updated at the current time was used as the initial
    value of the model simulation at the next time (Huang et al., 2019). A comparison
    of the forcing method, calibration method, and updating methods were illustrated
    in Table 2. Table 2. Comparison of the forcing method, calibration method and
    updating method, with the summary of corresponding publications, focusing on the
    technical aspects. (see reference in table Bouman, 1995; Clevers et al., 2002;
    Delecolle and Guerif, 1988; Hadria et al., 2006; Maas, 1988; Fang et al., 2008;
    Jin et al., 2015; Machwitz et al., 2014; Chakrabarti et al., 2014; Hadria et al.,
    2006; Ines et al., 2013; Pellenq and Boulet, 2004). The data assimilation technology
    helped crop models retain the advantages of mechanism, expanded the estimation
    of the model at the regional scale, and reduced the operation cost by using a
    large amount of remote sensing crop canopy and land surface spatial variation
    information. In data assimilation processing, the input variables (from remote
    sensing data sets), state variables (the most critical variable, from the complete
    crop model system), model parameters (describing the relationship between observed
    variables and state variables) and output variables (crop yield, WUE, etc.) should
    be distinguished first (Delécolle et al., 1992). The most commonly used assimilation
    variable is LAI, and the double assimilation variable has higher estimation accuracy
    than the single assimilation variable. The data assimilation can integrate canopy
    state variables with various spatial and temporal information from remote sensing
    data to optimize crop parameters in crop models (Jin et al., 2018). 4. Discussion
    4.1. Comparison of accuracy of various methods for estimating WUE This review
    summarized the advantages, disadvantages and scope of application of the field
    measurement method, crop model simulation method, remote sensing estimation method,
    and coupling method with remote sensing and crop model by data assimilation for
    estimating WUE. The field measurement method was simple and accurate, but had
    a heavy workload and large random errors. The limited number of global flux towers
    resulted in the inability of eddy covariance techniques to measure WUE at continuous
    regional scales. Due to the lack of spatial information and the difficulty in
    obtaining various input parameters required to run crop models, crop models can
    only simulate WUE at a single point scale, but not well at the regional scale.
    There were few flux tower data for accuracy verification of remote sensing-based
    GPP and ET products, which would affect the accuracy of croplands ecosystem WUE
    estimation. Remote sensing crop distribution recognition model, remote sensing
    ET and yield estimation model provided an effective way for the estimation of
    WUE at the regional scale, and expanded the spatial scale to regional and local
    scales. However, the poor mechanistic performance of the remote sensing water
    consumption and yield estimation model resulted in low estimation interpretability
    of WUE. Using data assimilation to estimate WUE at the regional scale, combined
    a mass of remote sensing continuous spatial crop parameters with the crop model
    to simulate the dynamic growth process of the crop, and had stronger mechanistic
    interpretation. Theoretically, compared with crop model simulation method and
    remote sensing estimation method, the method based on data assimilation method
    combined with remote sensing and crop model had the highest accuracy in estimating
    regional scale WUE, because it combined the advantages of crop model and remote
    sensing technology. Luo et al. (2023) reviewed a large number of research results
    on improving the simulation ability of crop models by using data assimilation
    methods, and found that taking yield as an example, the R2 range of yield estimation
    accuracy after data assimilation was significantly improved to 0.35 ∼ 0.82 (R2
    range of single crop model simulation was 0.01 ∼ 0.471). Therefore, since the
    simulation ability of the model has been improved after data assimilation, the
    simulation accuracy of other crop indicators such as WUE, ET, LAI and other indicators
    should also be improved in addition to yield indicators. Taking the study of Wang
    et al. (2024) as an example, based on Sentinel-2 remote sensing data, CERES-Maize
    model and SCE-UA optimization, this study estimated maize WUE in Fenwei plain
    of China under the data assimilation strategy and the non-assimilation strategy
    respectively. The results showed that the accuracy of WUE simulated by data assimilation
    strategy was higher and the error was lower (Fig. 7). Therefore, the data assimilation
    method combined with remote sensing and crop model had higher accuracy in estimating
    regional scale WUE than crop model simulation and remote sensing estimation method.

    relative error and bias, respectively, and the data in the figure came from Wang
    et al. (2024). 4.2. Limitations in current WUE estimation research At present,
    WUE estimation at the regional scale is based on remote sensing technology, satellite
    remote sensing platform is commonly used but the UAV platform is rarely used,
    which cannot meet the needs of fine farmland scale. Satellite images reflect the
    instantaneous conditions of the land surface or crop canopy on the day of transit
    and are easily affected by the launch of the satellite, the transit time interval,
    and the cloud cover during the transit. Thus, satellite remote sensing technology
    is limited by low spatial and temporal resolution and is easy to be interfered
    with meteorological factors. It is difficult to meet the requirements of repeated
    field scale crop observation. However, UAVs have higher image resolution and are
    less susceptible to clouds. Therefore, satellite remote sensing or UAV platform
    should be selected according to the size of the plot. Satellite remote sensing
    is more suitable for large regional scale above hectare area, while UAV remote
    sensing is more suitable for field scale. Recently, ET separation methods based
    on multi-scale and multi-concept WUE have been established. However, the assumptions
    of different methods make them have obvious limitations in application. An ET
    separation method that can make up for the general limitations and has a wide
    application prospect needs to be developed. At present, there is a lack of relevant
    research to evaluate or compare the uncertainties of different methods, especially
    in terms of limitations. The current studies lack new methods to estimate WUE
    at the regional scale. The role of WUE estimation accuracy was underestimated
    at present. Remote sensing technology is used to estimate WUE at the regional
    scale, which overcomes the shortcomings of traditional methods, but mechanistic
    explanations are not sufficient. At present, most of the studies using data assimilation
    techniques to couple remote sensing and crop models focused on estimating crop
    yield. However, few studies apply this method to estimate crop WUE at regional
    scale. Theoretically, the method of coupling remote sensing and crop model to
    estimate WUE using data assimilation technology can improve the estimation accuracy
    of WUE at the regional scale, but it still needs to be clarified by a large number
    of studies. 5. Future opportunities and challenges With the development of remote
    sensing technology, various kinds of satellite sensors such as optical, thermal
    infrared, and microwave can obtain multi-source remote sensing data of multi-temporal,
    spectral, sensor, platform, and resolution in the same region. Multi-source remote
    sensing data fusion expands the spatial and temporal scale of data. Improving
    the spatial resolution or temporal resolution of multi-source data are two main
    ways of multi-source data fusion. Using NOAA/AVHRR data with low spatial resolution
    and Landsat-TM with the medium spatial resolution to extract rice planting area
    by data fusion, the accuracy was greatly improved (Fang et al., 2008). The multi-source
    remote sensing data fusion can obtain richer and more accurate information, improve
    the accuracy of remote sensing information analysis and extraction, and thus improve
    the accuracy and stability of crop growth monitoring. Multi-source remote sensing
    data fusion is necessary for the estimation of crop yield and WUE at the regional
    scale, so as to ensure food security in precision agriculture. Multi-source remote
    sensing data should be obtained through the data fusion algorithm in the future,
    and then the application research of crop yield and WUE estimation based on the
    data assimilation to couple multi-source remote sensing data and crop growth models
    could be carried out. The UAV would be a popular platform for predicting crop
    WUE on a regional scale in the future due to its portability. The combination
    of remote sensing and crop model with data assimilation technology can effectively
    combine their advantages to improve the simulation and prediction ability of crop
    growth, yield formation and water consumption process at the regional scale. And
    the development of physicochemical and quantitative refinement of stress monitoring
    in crop growth, yield, and water consumption prediction can be promoted. Crop
    model has uncertainty, which comes from the model structure, parameters, and the
    input data (Wallach and Thorburn, 2017). Considering all the major sources of
    uncertainty, improving the estimation of crop model uncertainty to reduce uncertainty
    in order to improve the estimation accuracy of WUE is a future challenge. It is
    predicted that the integrated average simulation using multiple crop models will
    be an important means to reduce the uncertainty of crop models and improve the
    WUE accuracy of model simulation (Boote, 2020). At present, the debugging of crop
    models still requires a large number of measured parameters for calibration, which
    increases the cost of parameter acquisition and model operation. The relevant
    departments should provide the measured data of corresponding sites as much as
    possible. Future research should optimize the parameter calibration process and
    parameter auto-adjustment efficiency of crop models. The sensitivity analysis
    method can be coupled with the crop model automatic parameter adjustmentprogram
    to determine the sensitive parameters to crop yield, assimilation variables and
    WUE, and run the model with these parameters can improve the simulation ability
    of the model. At the same time, crop rotation should be considered in the model
    simulation of WUE. It is important to improve the assimilation accuracy and efficiency
    by optimizing crop model with less uncertainty and optimizing assimilation algorithms.
    In the future, assimilation of multiple state variables such as LAI, ET, SM, FAPAR,
    GPP, and nitrogen would be carried out to improve the simulation results and estimation
    accuracy of data assimilation WUE of remote sensing and crop models. Assimilating
    different key state variables in the corresponding stages according to different
    growth periods of crops also helps to improve assimilation accuracy. Future research
    also could improve and perfect the assimilation algorithm, increase its running
    speed, and increase the practicability of assimilation models. Integrating multi-source
    remote sensing data, ensemble using multi-crop models, innovating near-real-time
    seamless efficient data assimilation algorithms at regional scale, and refining
    multi-variables assimilation at different crop growth stages would be the research
    hotspots in the future. Due to the lack of crop-specific temporal and spatial
    information of WUE, it is difficult to understand the root cause of WUE variation
    and develop scientific strategies for crop irrigation optimization. There is an
    urgent need to incorporate crop types and irrigation allocations into high spatial
    resolution crop-specific WUE modeling to develop efficient water use strategies
    for sustainable agroecosystem management. 6. Conclusions This paper reviewed the
    research status, research hotspots, various concepts and estimation methods of
    WUE at different scales, research limitations of WUE, future opportunities and
    challenges. The concept and application scope of WUE at different levels and scales
    were sorted out. WUE at different scales could not be directly scale transferred.
    The advantages, disadvantages and applicability scope of various current WUE estimation
    methods were compared. Remote sensing method for estimation WUE overcame the shortcomings
    of field measurement and crop model simulation. Using data assimilation to couple
    remote sensing and crop model for estimating WUE at regional scale, and combining
    a mass of remote sensing continuous spatial crop parameters with crop model, it
    has a stronger mechanistic interpretation. However, improving WUE estimation accuracy
    through enhanced data assimilation efficiency remains a difficult problem. Future
    opportunities and challenges for WUE estimation methods were provided. It is predicted
    that optimized data assimilation between multi-source remote sensing fusion, UAV
    and crop model would be an effective method for future large-scale WUE estimation.
    However, reducing uncertainty in crop models and improving assimilation algorithms
    to achieve higher assimilation accuracy and efficiency are still the focus of
    future studies. Urgently incorporating crop types and irrigation allocations into
    high resolution, crop-specific WUE modeling is essential for developing efficient
    water use strategies. Integrating multi-source remote sensing data, ensemble using
    multi-crop models, innovating near-real-time seamless efficient data assimilation
    algorithms at regional scale, and refining multi-variables assimilation at different
    crop growth stages are the future hotspots. CRediT authorship contribution statement

  limitations: The accuracy of remote sensing-based GPP and ET products still needs
    to be improved to provide a stronger mechanistic interpretation of WUE estimation.
    The data assimilation method still has limitations in quantifying WUE at the regional
    scale, and it is necessary to explore more accurate and efficient data assimilation
    algorithms. In addition, the integration of multi-source remote sensing data,
    especially the combination of satellite remote sensing and UAV platform, needs
    to be further strengthened to improve the spatiotemporal resolution of WUE estimation.
    Finally, the incorporation of crop types and irrigation allocations into high
    spatial resolution crop-specific WUE modeling is still a challenge, and it is
    necessary to develop more advanced modeling methods to achieve this goal.

  title: 'Status of crop water use efficiency evaluation methods: A review'
  verbatim_quote1: '

    Due to the impacts of climate change and human activities on scarcity and uneven
    spatial distribution of water resources, water use efficiency (WUE) has gained
    significant attention. Currently, there is a lack of research on estimating WUE
    with higher accuracy and stronger mechanism on the large regional scale. This
    study systematically reviewed the status and hotspots from an amount of studies
    and analyzed various concepts and estimation methods of WUE at different scales.
    Additionally, we discussed the limitations and challenges of these studies to
    point out the future opportunities. WUE at different scales could not be directly
    scale transferred as WUE varied at various scales. Recently, the remote sensing
    gross primary productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) products, the remote
    sensing crop distribution recognition models, remote sensing ET and yield estimation
    models have improved the accuracy of WUE estimation at the regional scale, but
    lack of mechanical explanation. However, data assimilation provided a stronger
    mechanistic interpretation of WUE estimation at the regional scale by coupling
    remote sensing data and crop models. Optimized data assimilation method for coupling
    multi-source remote sensing fusion platform, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform
    and crop model would be a better approach to quantify WUE of the large area in
    the future. It is also necessary to incorporate crop types and irrigation allocations
    into high spatial resolution crop-specific WUE modeling. Therefore, integrating
    multi-source remote sensing data, ensemble using multi-crop models, innovating
    near-real-time seamless efficient data assimilation algorithms at the regional
    scale, and refining multi-variables assimilation at different crop growth stages
    are the research hotspots in the future. This study will provide useful guidance
    for optimizing water resource management in precision agriculture and improving
    the efficient utilization of water resources.'
  verbatim_quote2: Taking the study of Wang et al. (2024) as an example, based on
    Sentinel-2 remote sensing data, CERES-Maize model and SCE-UA optimization, this
    study estimated maize WUE in Fenwei plain of China under the data assimilation
    strategy and the non-assimilation strategy respectively. The results showed that
    the accuracy of WUE simulated by data assimilation strategy was higher and the
    error was lower (Fig. 7). Therefore, the data assimilation method combined with
    remote sensing and crop model had higher accuracy in estimating regional scale
    WUE than crop model simulation and remote sensing estimation method.

    Introduction Saline soil, as per the Soil Science Society of America, is marked
    by a high concentration of soluble salts, impairing crop growth. Soil salinization
    is a process of land degradation that results in the excessive accumulation of
    soluble salts in the soil (Hassani et al., 2021). Natural or primary soil salinization
    results from sources like rainfall (wet deposition of oceanic salts), aeolian
    processes (dry deposition of oceanic salts), and parent rock weathering (Zaman
    et al., 2018). Additionally, transport of saline geological deposits via streamflow
    or shallow underground waters contributes to primary salinization (Daliakopoulos
    et al., 2016). However, secondary soil salinization is primarily caused by human
    activities such as using brackish or saline water for irrigation, raising water
    tables due to poor land and water management, and overuse of fertilizers (Hassan
    and Ghazi, 2023; Hong et al., 2023; Nguyen and Huynh, 2023). Salinization is a
    widespread issue in various geographical regions. In Argentina and other parts
    of South America, largely attributed to alterations in the soil''s water flow
    pattern caused by the presence of a calcium layer within the rocks (Milione et
    al., 2020). In Australian agricultural soils, sodium primarily accumulates, leading
    to seasonal variations in salt accumulation, and affecting around 30 % of Australia''s
    land area (Akter et al., 2021). In Central and Eastern Europe, soil salinization
    is a significant concern, particularly in marginal area due to declining groundwater
    levels. Furthermore, salinization in northern and central Europe can be attributed
    to soil erosion resulting from floods. Extreme rainfall events and arid conditions
    in Ital have increased evapotranspiration, causing highly saline groundwater to
    rise during the cold season, further intensifying salinity in aquifers (Salvati
    and Ferrara, 2015). In Greece, salinization primarily arises from a combination
    of increased temperature, evaporation, and reduced groundwater recharge. The exacerbation
    of salinization under brackish water irrigation is linked to the escalation of
    evapotranspiration (Daliakopoulos et al., 2016). The Netherlands has witnessed
    an increase in shallow groundwater and surface water due to sea-level rise and
    ground subsidence, resulting in a sudden intensification of salinization (de Louw
    et al., 2010). In specific arid regions of western South Africa, salinization
    predominantly occurs due to the rapid evaporation of water and the subsequent
    accumulation of salts (Du Preez and Van Huyssteen, 2020). Salinization models
    predict that future hotspots for salinization will include dryland areas in South
    America, southern and western Australia, Mexico, the southwestern United States,
    southeastern Asia and South Africa (Hassani et al., 2021). Currently, there are
    three main research hotspots in the literatures on salinization. The first approach
    involves combining the analysis of electrical conductivity (EC) in soil samples
    with software analysis to assess the distribution of salt in a specific area (Berkal
    et al., 2014). Ganjegunte et al. (2014) utilized EC and electromagnetic induction
    to determine the salt index of cotton fields in Texas, United States. The second
    approach is a semi-automated method similar to supervised classification, which
    introduced a decision tree algorithm that incorporates multisource optical and
    polarization synthetic aperture radar data, thereby improving the accuracy of
    soil salinization estimation and monitoring (Guo et al., 2018; Nurmemet et al.,
    2015). The third research method involves the utilization of machine learning,
    deep learning, and other advanced techniques. Scholars used Landsat 5, Landsat
    8, GF-2, Sentinel-2 and ALOS data to large-scale investigate and evaluate salinization
    information in the world, and which has very high efficiency (Kabiraj et al.,
    2022; Li et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2018). However, current research on primary
    salinization is limited, particularly from a geological perspective. Primary salinization
    refers to the natural accumulation of salts in the soil due to water evaporation,
    without human intervention (Hassani et al., 2021). This process is a significant
    environmental concern in arid and semi-arid regions worldwide, including the Hetao
    irrigation area. Factors such as geology, climate, topography, and soil type influence
    the mechanisms and processes involved in primary soil salinization. Regions with
    high evaporation rates, low precipitation, and shallow groundwater are more susceptible
    to primary salinization. Similarly, soils with a high clay content and low permeability
    are more prone to salt accumulation. To elucidate geological factors of salinization,
    we will conduct a case study in the Hetao irrigation area to investigate the causes
    of primary salinization. Our goals include identifying the geological driving
    forces behind primary salinization, comprehending the intricate process of salinization
    in this region, and assessing the improvement program on salinization. We plan
    to conduct a field survey to observe salinization symptoms on-site and gather
    additional data on groundwater quality from literatures sources. Implementing
    sustainable practices for groundwater resource management, as well as revising
    existing practices. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Geographic setting and study
    area The Hetao irrigation area, covering an area of 7500 km2, is situated in the
    western part of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China. It is commonly
    referred to as the Hetao Plain or Hetao Basin, and is one of the three major irrigation
    areas in China. This region has a relatively flat terrain, with elevations ranging
    from 1010 to 1107 m above sea level. It stretches approximately 60 km in the north-south
    direction and 200 km in the east-west direction, primarily consisting of sediments
    deposited by rivers and lakes. The southwest part of the basin has slightly higher
    elevations compared to the northeast. Geographically, Yinshan Mountains form the
    northern boundary, while the Ordos Plateau marks the southern limit. The eastern
    boundary is formed by Ural Mountain, and Ulanbuhe Desert defines the western boundary

    image Fig. 1. Geographical location of Hetao irrigation area (the light red area
    is the research area), which is a closed sedimentary fault basin (drawing graphics
    by GMT software). The Hetao irrigation area system is located in a transitional
    climate zone, positioned between the semi-arid and inner arid regions. The area''s
    ecosystem is highly sensitive to natural climate variations. The average temperature
    throughout the year ranges between 6.8 and 7.6 °C, with average annual precipitation
    ranging from 100 to 300 mm. The summer season contributes significantly, accounting
    for about 65 % of the total annual rainfall, while the annual evaporation rate
    remains relatively high at approximately 2000 mm (Miao et al., 2016). Groundwater
    recharge occurs through vertical permeation of precipitation, surface runoff,
    as well as lateral flow of groundwater from the bedrock along the Yinshan Mountains
    and the leakage from the Yellow River to the south. Discharge mainly results from
    evaporation and artificial abstraction. The slow groundwater flow conditions within
    the plain are attributed to the dry climate, low hydraulic gradient, and abundance
    of fine-grained sediments. Soil salinization worsens due to intense evaporation
    and an increasing groundwater table resulting from prolonged irrigation with water
    imported from the Yellow River. As a consequence of this irrigation, the average
    rise in the groundwater level has been approximately 1–1.5 m. 2.2. Geological
    structure of Hetao irrigation area Following the Eocene period, tectonic activity
    driven by the Yanshan Movement and the Himalayan Movement resulted in significant
    uplift of the Yinshan Mountains to the north and the Ordos Basin to the south.
    In contrast, the Hetao Basin underwent substantial subsidence due to northwest-southeast
    stretching (Yang et al., 2018). This geological process can be categorized into
    three crucial evolutionary stages: the Oligocene, the Late Tertiary, and the Quaternary.
    The Oligocene marked the initial phase of Hetao Basin development. Yinshan Mountains
    were uplifted due to active faults in the piedmont, while the Hetao area underwent
    subsidence, leading to the formation of a fault zone (Wang et al., 2018). The
    subsidence center was located in the Linhe Sag in the west, with a sediment thickness
    of 2600 m. The Late Tertiary stage played a crucial role in the evolution of Hetao
    Basin. During the Miocene, the basin continued to subside under the influenced
    of Yinshan piedmont fault. The Linhe Sag, located at the center of this subsidence,
    accumulated sediments up to 3800 m thick. Throughout the Pliocene, the basin''s
    subsidence intensified, with both the scope and magnitude of subsidence increasing.
    At its peak, sedimentary thickness reached 6000 m in the Hetao Depression area.
    Moreover, the significant uplift of the Yinshan Mountains and uneven subsidence
    of the basin led to the formation and development of faults on the northern edge
    of the Ordos. The new tectonic movement in the basin during the Quaternary period
    inherited characteristics from the old structure. It mainly involved vertical
    differential movement, with intermittent subsidence occurring in the basin. The

    2400 m. Duo to the relative uplift, the Yinshan Mountains underwent significant
    erosion, resulting in the widespread presence of platforms, alluvial fans, fault

    2.3. Lake evolution of Hetao irrigation area Since the Early Pleistocene, the
    sedimentary environment of the Hetao Basin has undergone multiple lake contraction
    and expansion processes (Li et al., 2017; Li, 2019). Particularly, the northern
    part of the Hetao Basin has experienced six phases of sedimentary environment
    evolution since the late Middle Pleistocene. Between 340,000 and 320,000 years
    ago, the region exhibited a littoral lake sedimentary environment. From 320,000
    to 160,000 years ago, it transitioned to a semi-deep lacustrine sedimentary environment.
    The period from 160,000 to 130,000 years ago witnessed the development of a littoral
    sedimentary environment and a lake delta facies depositional environment. Between
    130,000 and 100,000 years ago, a shallow lake facies depositional environment
    prevailed. From 100,000 years ago to the present, the area has transformed into
    a lakeside-fluvial facies depositional environment. Finally, from 10,000 years
    ago to the present, it has evolved into a floodplain facies depositional environment

    area (it is generally believed that the formation time of the ancient Great Lake
    was approximately 1 × 104 to 16 × 104 years ago), A to E represents the research
    results of different scholars, respectively (Li, 2019). The Middle Pleistocene
    Great Lakes Period (approximately 320,000–160,000 years ago): During this stage,
    the majority of the Hetao Basin was submerged beneath vast lakes. The sediment
    grain size was fine, giving a blue-gray hue to the deep-water environment. The
    difference in lake water levels between the basin''s edge and center was minimal
    (Li, 2019). The Late Pleistocene Lake Formation Period (approximately 160,000–130,000
    years ago): In this period, rivers and lakes coexisted, with rivers mainly formed
    in the northern region of the basin, while lakes continued to evolve in the central
    area. However, the size of the lakes significantly decreased. Borehole sediment
    characteristics in the central region revealed the presence of lakes in a shoreline-shallow
    lake phase with partial oxidation. Fine-grained components were relatively unstable,
    but gradually increased over time. This indicates a rise in the water level of
    the ancient great lake and a shift towards a warmer and more humid climate. The
    sediments exhibited instability, consisting of fine sand, coarse sand, and gravel
    at the lake bottom, indicating the existence of a large-scale river in the Hetao
    Basin prior to the formation of the ancient great lake, possibly the ancient Yellow
    River (Jia et al., 2016). The Late Pleistocene Great Lakes Period (approximately
    130,000–100,000 years ago): During this phase, the Hetao Basin entered a unified
    ancient lake stage again, but the overall lake water level was lower compared
    to the Middle Pleistocene ancient lakes. The central lake was situated in the
    northern part of the basin, and the lake water level gradually decreased from
    north to south. A higher content of fine-grained components indicated a deep-water
    environment, and the presence of multiple gypsum layers suggested a closed lake
    during this period. The Late Pleistocene Lake Shrinkage Period (approximately
    100,000–10,000 years ago): In this phase, the Yellow River flowed out, causing
    the disintegration of the ancient Hetao Lake. Several lakes retreated to the mountain
    front, where they continued depositing lacustrine strata and were uplifted in
    stages due to the influence of mountain front fault. The overall fine-grained
    component decreased rapidly, while the medium-grained and coarse-grained components
    significantly increased. The lakes were in a semi-open shallow state. This period
    was characterized by a dry and cold climate, and the environment became harsh
    as the ancient Hetao Lake gradually disappeared. The Modern Yellow River Period
    of the Holocene (10,000 years ago to present): During this stage, modern Yellow
    River fluvial facies strata were extensively developed, and there was almost no
    presence of lake facies sediments. The primary Yellow River stream flowed along
    the northern edge of the Ordos Plateau, and the ancient lakes that once existed
    in the region have now completely vanished. Instead, a series of small lakes,
    formed by river and wind processes, emerged on the expansive river plains. However,
    these new lakes lack any genetic connection with the ancient large lakes from
    the Late Pleistocene. 2.4. Sedimentary environment of Hetao irrigation area Based
    on the stratification of the Quaternary strata, burial conditions, and hydrogeological
    characteristics of the aquifer, the aquifer in the area can be categorized into
    two distinct water-bearing rock groups. These groups are identified as the Upper
    Pleistocene (Qp3)-Holocene (Qh) water-bearing rock group (referred to as the first
    water-bearing rock group) and the Middle Pleistocene (Qp2) water-bearing rock
    group (known as the second water-bearing rock group), as illustrated in Fig. 4.
    The first water-bearing rock group exhibits the greatest thickness and widest
    distribution, holding significant importance for water supply. It is noteworthy
    that the second water-bearing rock group and the first water-bearing rock group
    interact, affecting water exchange within the aquifer. Download : Download high-res

    and sedimentary facies division in Hetao irrigation area. The seepage direction
    of surface diving is from south to north and from west to east, finally converging
    into the Wuliangsu Lake in the northeast. The exchange range of underground water
    is limited within the fault basin. The first aquifer component consists of alluvial-proluvial
    phreatic water (Qh) and alluvial-lacustrine phreatic water (Qp3). The Holocene
    (Qh) aquifer primarily consists of weak aquifers composed of cohesive soil mixed
    with fine sand, with few clay layers separating them. This creates a prevalent
    binary structure of upper fine and lower coarse layers in the area. The Upper
    Pleistocene (Qp3) is a shallow water layer with widespread distribution, substantial
    water volume, and high recharge capacity. It serves as the primary water source
    for human and livestock consumption and is the primary collection layer for groundwater
    chemical samples. The second aquifer component consists of water-bearing rock
    (Qp2), is primarily composed of lacustrine deposits, often consisting of confined
    water and, in some localized areas, artesian water. The Qp2 is typically characterized
    by silt clay deposits with few and thin sand layers, primarily receiving recharge
    from groundwater around the basin. In terms of dynamics, it falls into the category
    of slow runoff. The Hetao irrigation area is a closed groundwater basin characterized
    primarily by vertical water exchange, and the main sources of groundwater supply
    come from irrigation and vertical infiltration of precipitation. Due to low rainfall,
    most of the groundwater is sourced from Yellow River irrigation water. In non-irrigation
    periods, the groundwater level is typically found at depths between 1.5 and 4.0
    m. However, In irrigation periods, the groundwater level can rise to 0.5 m (Xie
    et al., 2022). Groundwater in the Hetao irrigation area flows from west to east
    and from south to north, and it maintains an average hydraulic slope of <2 ‰.
    3. Results 3.1. Groundwater chemistry Many publications have been dedicated to
    the investigation of groundwater chemical characteristics, resulting in a substantial
    volume of groundwater analysis data (Cao et al., 2022; Li et al., 2022; Xie et
    al., 2022; etc.). In this study, a preliminary statistical analysis was conducted
    on this data, focusing the most centrally distributed data for more detailed examination.
    To enhance our understanding of groundwater composition and its origins, it is
    crucial to investigate the interrelationships among key ions, such as Na+, Ca2+,
    Mg2+, K+, Cl−, HCO3−, CO32−, and SO42−. This analytical approach provides valuable
    insights into hydrogeochemical processes and their impact on groundwater composition.
    Furthermore, it helps us comprehend the water-rock interactions that potentially
    govern groundwater composition (Cao et al., 2022; Zeng et al., 2021). By analyzing
    ion ratios and evaluating robust statistical correlations (Fig. 5), we can identify
    processes within the overall sample group. Download : Download high-res image

    from Hetao irrigation area, Northwest China. The light yellow ellipse represents
    the point range of groundwater, and the data are the concentrated area of most
    data (≥ 80 %), excluding the scattered data outside the area. The pH of groundwater
    in the Hetao irrigation area ranges from 7.0 to 9.5, with an average value of
    8.2, indicating that the environment is nearly neutral and slightly alkaline.
    The mass concentration of total dissolved solids (TDS) in the groundwater varies
    from 800 to 7000 mg/L, with an average of approximately 2100 mg/L. The main cations
    found in the groundwater are Na+ and K+, with an average mass concentration of
    280 mg/L and 30 mg/L, followed by Mg2+ and Ca2+. Among the anions, the order of
    ion concentration values from high to low is Cl−, SO42− and HCO3−, with average
    mass concentrations of 520 mg/L, 370 mg/L, and 50 mg/L, respectively. According
    to the Piper diagram, groundwater in the Hetao irrigation area is characterized
    as Na+-Cl−-SO42− type. However, the pH value of Yellow River water is 7.6, and
    its TDS is 360 mg/L, which notably lower than the average TDS of groundwater.
    The primary cations in the Yellow River water are mainly Ca2+ and Na+, with mass
    concentrations of 55 mg/L and 32 mg/L, respectively. The dominant anion is HCO3−,
    with a mass concentration of 194 mg/L. According to the Piper diagram, the main
    type of water in the Hetao irrigation area is characterized as Ca2+-Na+-HCO3−.
    This difference in the hydrochemistry of groundwater in Hetao irrigation area
    compared to the Yellow River water, which indicates that not all salt ions in
    Hetao irrigation area come from the irrigation of Yellow River water (primary
    salinization), part of them may come from deep groundwater (secondary salinization).
    3.2. Hydrogeochemical process Gibbs diagrams (Gibbs, 1970) are a valuable tool
    for assessing groundwater chemistry by considering evaporation, precipitation,
    and water-rock interactions. These diagrams plot TDS against the concentration
    ratio of Na+/(Ca2+ + Na+) and Cl−/(Cl− + HCO3−). Here, the diagrams were used
    to analyze the main hydrochemical processes that influence groundwater in the
    Hetao irrigation region. Analysis of Fig. 6a and b reveals that the majority of
    shallow groundwater in Hetao irrigation area primarily falls within the evaporation
    zone. This indicates that, in addition to water-rock interactions, hydrochemical
    components are significantly influenced by the evaporation process. Several studies
    have addressed the effect of evaporation on the accumulation of TDS in groundwater
    in various low-lying plains. For instance, Mushtaq et al. (2018) investigated
    this phenomenon in the eastern Indus Plain, while Mladenov et al. (2014) focused
    on the Okavango Delta of Botswana, and Ortega-Guerrero (2016) explored the Nazas
    and Aguanaval Rivers plain. These diverse regions offer valuable insights into
    understanding the implications of evaporation on TDS accumulation in groundwater.

    shallow groundwater in Hetao irrigation area, and the distribution range of data
    is the concentrated area of most data (≥ 80 %), excluding the scattered data outside
    the area. In the Hetao irrigation area, the depth at which the shallow groundwater
    table is buried varies from 0.5 m to 4.0 m, while the hydraulic gradient remains
    below 0.3 ‰. This condition promotes the evaporation of shallow groundwater (Wang
    et al., 2018). The average annual evaporation exceeds precipitation levels, and
    strong evaporation discharge has become the primary mode of groundwater discharge
    in plain areas. 3.3. Mineral dissolution Dissolved solutes in groundwater, including
    HCO3−, Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+, originate from the dissolution of minerals such as
    carbonate, silicate, and evaporite (Gaillardet et al., 1999). The weathering processes
    of silicate and carbonate minerals have a significant impact on the global carbon
    cycle by consuming atmospheric CO2 over different time periods. However, the kinetics
    of weathering vary significantly among different mineral types. Carbonate minerals
    exhibit rapid dissolution kinetics, with higher dissolution rates than silicate
    minerals such as basalt, granite, and gneiss. This discrepancy is responsible
    for the elevated concentrations of HCO3−, Ca2+, and Mg2+ in groundwater (Martin,
    2017; Ulloa-Cedamanos et al., 2021). To pinpoint the sources of major ions, it
    is essential to analyze the relationship between elemental ratios, specifically
    the ratios of Ca2+/Na+, HCO3−/Na+, and Mg2+/Na+ (Gaillardet et al., 1999). As
    show in Fig. 7a and b, groundwater samples from the Hetao irrigation area are
    positioned between the evaporites end-member and silicates end-member, but notably
    closer to the evaporites end-member. This indicates that the evaporite dissolution
    predominantly influences the hydrochemistry of the water samples in the study
    zone, with a lesser impact from carbonate weathering. Some groundwater samples
    also show influence from evaporation processes and silicate weathering. In contrast,
    the Yellow River sample is located between the silicates end-member and carbonates
    end-member, but relatively closer to the silicates end-member. This indicates
    that the hydrochemistry of the Yellow River water samples is primarily affected
    by the hydrolysis of silicates and carbonates. Download : Download high-res image

    versus Ca2+/Na+ ratios; (b) diagram of Mg2+/Na+ ratios versus Ca2+/Na+ ratios.
    Thus, the mineral composition of groundwater in the Hetao irrigation area mainly
    originates from the dissolution of evaporites, followed by silicates minerals
    supplied by the Yellow River water, and carbonates minerals supplied by Langshan
    Mountain. 3.4. Salinization model The Hetao irrigation area is an agricultural
    region that relies on Yellow River water for irrigation. Salt pressing activities
    are conducted annually during the winter, resulting in a significant infiltration
    of irrigation water into the soil. This infiltration leads to an increase in groundwater
    salinity, elevation of the groundwater table, elevation of the hydraulic gradient,
    and promotion of vertical groundwater circulation. The Yellow River water has
    a weak alkaline nature, with the primary hydrochemical type being Ca2+-Na+-HCO3−.
    Irrigation introduces a significant quantity of HCO3−, Ca2+, and Mg2+ ions into
    the groundwater. These ions exhibit characteristics of silicate and carbonate
    dissolution. Fertilization during agricultural planting also contributes to salinization.
    A large quantity of K+ ions infiltrate the soil with irrigation water sources.
    After significant evaporation, the remaining ions intensify soil salinization
    (Fig. 7). In terms of natural factors, the study area experiences significant
    temperature fluctuations, limited precipitation, and intense evaporation. Moreover,
    groundwater depth is typically <4.0 m, creating a significant evaporation field.
    Prolonged evaporation over the years causes an increase in salt content in deep
    soil and shallow groundwater through capillary action, accumulating on the soil
    surface, resulting in soil salinization. Langshan Mountain exhibits strong carbonate
    weathering, and runoff from the mountainous area carries a substantial quantity
    of Ca2+ and CO32− ions to supply the low-lying areas in the northern part of Hetao
    irrigation area. The primary source of these ions is the dissolution of evaporites
    in underground aquifers, which is a unique feature. Underground in Hetao irrigation
    area, there exists a thick lacustrine sedimentary layer primarily composed of
    evaporites. A significant amount of Cl−, SO42−, Mg2+, and Ca2+ ions dissolve in
    the groundwater and migrate to the surface soil due to changes in water levels,
    forming a distinct salinization model for Hetao irrigation area (Fig. 8). Download

    Hydrogeochemical dynamic model of salinization in Hetao irrigation area, and its
    mineral transport pathway. Salinization minerals is mainly controlled by evaporites,
    silicates, and carbonates, and their sources are mainly the Yellow River water,
    underground deep water, rock weathering in Langshan Mountain, and agricultural
    fertilizers. 4. Discussion 4.1. Bowl effect in Hetao irrigation area The Hetao
    irrigation area is a typical rift basin with significant layers of fluvial and
    lacustrine sediments, resulting a unique bowl-shaped geological section. At the
    bottom of basin, there is a thick layer of lacustrine sediments with low water
    permeability. Consequently, there is limited water exchange between the basin
    and the external environment, creating a closed water circulation system (Fig.
    9). In the Late Pleistocene and Holocene strata, where there is no stable impermeable
    layer separating the phreatic and semi-confined water, and the groundwater level
    remains consistently buried at a certain depth, it is collectively referred to
    as shallow groundwater. The main direction of shallow groundwater runoff is predominantly
    from the southwest to the northeast (Xie et al., 2022). Download : Download high-res
    image (736KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Bowl effect: The special
    driving mechanism of primary salinization in Hetao irrigation area. Because of
    the limitation of lacustrine sedimentary layers, the groundwater in Hetao irrigation
    area is located in a closed space, which restricts large-scale water exchange
    with the outside of the basin, forming an irreversible salinization zone. The
    bowl-shaped topography hinders the reduction of ion concentration in groundwater.
    The enclosed environment limits the efficient exchange of groundwater, making
    it challenging to reduce the dissolved mineral components in the water. In addition
    to the initial ions within the basin, various ions are continuously introduced
    from sources such as the Yellow River, Langshan Mountain, lacustrine sedimentation,
    and agricultural fertilization, which further complicates the task of reducing
    ion concentration within the basin. The ion distribution pattern within the basin
    generally diminishes from the surface downwards, but even in deep groundwater,
    ion concentrations remain relatively high due to the substantial contribution
    of ions from the lacustrine sedimentary layer. The bowl-shaped topography also
    restricts the migration path of groundwater, thereby limiting both the distance
    and speed at which groundwater can travel. This restriction significantly affects
    the utilization and management of groundwater resources. Firstly, the bowl effect
    restricts the migration paths of groundwater, limiting its movement to specific
    boundaries rather than allowing it to spread freely to distant areas. Secondly,
    the bowl effect also hampers the migration speed of groundwater, causing a slowdown
    in its horizontal and vertical movement. Furthermore, the bowl effect influences
    the quality of groundwater by causing water accumulation in certain areas, leading
    to the gradual buildup of dissolved substances. This topography exacerbates primary
    and secondary salinization. The inability to dilute the primary salinity of groundwater
    creates a permanent and irreversible environment of primary salinization. Similarly,
    the bowl-shaped topography hinders the dilution of secondary salinity in groundwater,
    resulting in higher salt concentrations in the surface soil layer, which, in turn,
    inhibits plant growth. 4.2. Salinization mechanism in Hetao irrigation area The
    salinization problem in Hetao irrigation area is primarily influenced by two key
    factors: climate and groundwater. Low precipitation rate in the region accelerates
    water evaporation from the soil, leading to a gradual increase in soil salt concentration
    and ultimately resulting in salinization. Furthermore, rising groundwater levels
    dissolve soil salts, which are then transported to the surface, exacerbating the
    soil salinization issue. According to Fig. 10a, the concentration of salt ions
    in the soil decreases during the irrigation period due to leaching and salt pressure.
    Spring irrigation and summer rainy seasons increase soil moisture, which leads
    to the dissolution and leaching of soil salt, lowering the concentration of salt
    ions in the surface soil. As water moves from the surface layer to the lower layer
    of the soil, it carries some salt ions and migrates downwards, reducing the surface
    soil''s salt ion concentration while increasing this concentration in deeper layers.
    However, it should be noted that surface irrigation can introduce salt ions from
    the Yellow River water and fertilizers into groundwater, increasing the overall
    salt ion content in groundwater. Download : Download high-res image (745KB) Download

    the irrigation period. (b) Water and salt transport pathways of groundwater during
    the evaporation period. Fig. 10b illustrates that during the non-irrigation period,
    salt ion concentration in the soil decreases through evaporation. Unlike water
    molecules, salt ions remain in the soil during evaporation due to their larger
    mass. Consequently, salt ion concentration in the soil increases as water evaporates.
    In area with high groundwater levels, there is already a significant concentration
    of salt ions, resulting in both primary and secondary salinization. When the groundwater
    level fall fall, the concentration of salt ions in the surface soil cannot be
    diluted and remains in the soil. 4.3. Salinization improvement in Hetao irrigation
    area Addressing salinization has become an urgent priority, and extensive research
    has been conducted on salinization improvement technology. Several countries,
    including Russia, the United States, Australia, Pakistan, Poland, India, Egypt,
    and Israel, have undertaken efforts to improve and utilize salinization. Salinization
    treatment involves three primary approaches: physical, chemical, and biological
    treatment (Fig. 11). Each type of saline soil improvement measure has its own
    advantages and drawbacks. Chemical improvement can reduce soil salinity and alkalinity
    and enhance physicochemical properties, but it may also introduce secondary soil
    pollution. Biological improvement offers low environmental impact, sustainability,
    and minimal investment, but its effectiveness may be slower (Zhang et al., 2020).
    Physical improvement yields significant results and utilizes well-established
    technology, but it may require substantial initial investment and a lengthy construction
    period (Xie et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2020). Download : Download high-res image

    employed for salinization control in Hetao irrigation area. (a) Embedding drainage
    pipes to facilitate rapid removal of salt-laden water, thereby reducing the soil
    salinity; (b) Implementing biological or chemical enhancements aimed at reducing
    or stabilizing salt levels; (c) Incorporating gravel layers to manage the rise
    in capillary water height; (d) Cultivating salt-tolerant crops. Underground pipe
    drainage technology serves a dual purpose of drainage and salt removal and it
    operates on the principle that salt follows water (Fig. 11a). When the soil moisture
    reaches its maximum field capacity, water seeps into the underground pipe through
    micropores in the pipe wall, carrying dissolved salt with it. This process effectively
    reduces soil salt content and helps control salinization. Experiments have determined
    that the optimal depth for the underground pipe is between 1.0 and 1.2 m, with
    the optimal spacing determined by soil quality: 10–14 m for clay soil and 14–18
    m for loam soil. Underground pipe drainage can successfully remove salt from the
    soil, achieving a desalination rate of approximately 60 %–80 %. Chemical improvement
    measures involve adding external additives such as gypsum, peat, slag, and others
    to the soil (Fig. 11b). These methods can also influence soil structural characteristics
    by enhancing soil aggregates and porosity, as discussed by Yang et al. (2023).
    Sodium ion adsorbents can adsorb Na+, Cl−, and CO32− ions, resulting in a soil
    desalination rate of up to 29 %. Aluminum sulfate can lower the pH of the soil
    solution and significantly increase the number of large microaggregates (0.05–0.25
    mm) in the soil. Microbial improvement measures are achieved through the continuous
    metabolism of microorganisms during their growth process. The secretions of microorganisms
    can break down or solidify salts, and they can also form a barrier layer through
    microbial-induced calcium carbonate precipitation technology to reduce the vertical
    migration rate of salts. The use of gravel barriers can effectively hinder the
    capillary rise of groundwater and regulate the height of capillary water (Fig.
    11c). When deep soil or groundwater with high salt content ascends to the surface
    through capillary action, it leads to salt accumulation in the surface soil after
    water evaporation. Consequently, capillary action emerges as a primary mechanism
    for the upward vertical migration of salt. By intercepting the capillary water
    migration, gravel barriers efficiently prevent salt from converging towards the
    surface, thereby achieving a salt suppression effect (Su et al., 2022; Xie et
    al., 2022). Numerous experimental studies have demonstrated that gravel with a
    burial depth of 60–80 cm and a particle size ranging from 1 to 3 cm yields the
    best results. A two-layer structure is employed, with a top layer of fine gravel
    to prevent soil from obstructing gravel pores. The lower layer of coarse gravel,
    characterized by high porosity, effectively blocks capillaries at greater depths,
    thus inhibiting soil capillary action and the upward migration of salt. Measures
    to enhance plant growth can mitigate the effect of soil salinization by cultivating
    salt-tolerant plants (Fig. 11d). Using sorghum as the subject, researchers have
    identified the key gene AT1 and its mechanism of action. Field experiments have
    demonstrated that this gene significantly enhances the yield of salt-alkali-tolerant
    crops such as sorghum, rice, millet, and corn, offering promising prospects for
    ameliorating salinization (Zhang et al., 2023). 5. Conclusions Soil salinization
    is a global issue primarily caused by human activities, resulting in secondary
    salinization, while primary salinization is a minor factor in this phenomenon.
    However, the Hetao irrigation area stands out as an anomaly, with primary salinization
    prevailing, which has led to the formation of a permanent and irreversible salinization
    region. The bowl effect is distinctive, with geological factors playing a decisive
    role, giving rise to a unique geological-driven salinization area of primary salinization.
    The key findings are summarized below: 1. The Hetao irrigation area originated
    during the Eocene period of the Tertiary, forming a typical extensional fault
    basin. In the late Pleistocene, an ancient lake formed, leading to a prolonged
    period of lacustrine sedimentation. Over time, the Hetao irrigation area experienced
    alternating phases of lacustrine sedimentation and river sedimentation until the
    Holocene. The fine particles and poor permeability of lacustrine sediments reduce
    the vertical migration efficiency of groundwater and exacerbate salinization.
    2. Groundwater hydrochemistry in Hetao irrigation area is characterized by high
    concentration of SO42− and is classified as Na+-Cl-SO42− type. Additionally, rainfall
    in the Langshan mountain area contributes a little Ca2+ and CO3− ions. By contrast,
    the water from Yellow River is classified as Ca2+-Na+-HCO3− type, with a greater
    presence of HCO3− ions. This indicates the source pathway of salt ions in Hetao
    irrigation area. This indicates that the primary source of ions in Hetao irrigation
    area mainly come from groundwater, especially SO42− ions. 3. Main source of mineral
    composition in groundwater is evaporites, indicating that the lacustrine sedimentation
    of late Pleistocene significantly influences the hydrochemical properties of groundwater.
    Evaporites, resulting from lacustrine sedimentation, dissolve in groundwater,
    and shallow groundwater carries salt ions to the surface. The process of intense
    evaporation causes salt ions remain in the soil, leading to a unique salinization
    process. 4. One notable feature of Hetao irrigation area is the presence of a

    to this bowl. The Hetao irrigation area is enclosed within this geological bowl
    and remains isolated from external water sources. This bowl restricts the large-scale

- analysis: This research considers the evolution of water culture in the Weihe River
    Basin over a 100 year time period through the lens of security as reflected in
    historical policy documents. The authors recognize water culture as an adaptation
    to the environment that is influenced by water crises. Applying a content analysis
    methodology to explore water culture and water security, the authors identify
    four distinct phases of water culture evolution and the corresponding water security
    issues across these phases. They observe that water culture in the Weihe River
    Basin has transitioned through phases focused on disaster resistance, irrigation,
    resource conservation, and ecological aspects. Water security evolved alongside,
    with disaster preparedness and flood control concerns in the early part, and water
    resource scarcity, water environment health, and ecological preservation being
    addressed in subsequent phases. The authors conclude that traditional policies
    have prioritized addressing isolated water security issues, failing to recognize
    the complex and interconnected nature of water security. The study recommends
    a comprehensive approach that encompasses the lessons learned from the past century
    of water culture and security in the region for the development of sustainable
    water resource management policies.

    1. Introduction Driven by global changes and human activities, water culture and
    water resources systems are undergoing significant and continuous transformation
    (Foley and J., 2005; Kåresdotter et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023; Xiong et al.,
    2022). Water culture combines the physical and cultural dimensions of material
    and immaterial aspects that interact to produce a specific form of human connection
    with water. Humans create water cultures that depend on the environmental contexts
    when they come in contact with water (Mclean, 2017). The analytical efficacy of
    water culture stems from the establishment of specific values and behaviors pertaining
    to water within the prevailing frameworks of natural resource management. This
    might have led to the marginalization of various forms of water utilization. Therefore,
    in the context of responding to global climate change and the increase in the
    number of water and drought emergencies, it is essential to consider values and
    norms as endogenous to the coupled human-water system and focus on them in terms
    of the human-water relationship (Cavus et al., 2022; Pande and Sivapalan, 2017).
    The current phase of global economic expansion has been accompanied by a significant
    increase in the demand for water resources, which can be attributed to several
    factors, including extensive resource development, rapid urbanization, and population
    growth. These factors have contributed to the persistent occurrence of water resource
    shortages, water-related calamities, contamination of water environments, and
    other associated challenges, resulting in significant concerns about water security
    (Koop et al., 2022; Paiva et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2022). Water security challenges
    can be considered deliberate or inadvertent outcomes of the gradual development
    of culture, including social norms, values, ideologies, and political institutions.
    These issues are often unforeseen or are overlooked in the context of water-related
    issues (Di Baldassarre et al., 2019). Water culture, a fundamental aspect of human
    origin, reflects of the intricate connection between individuals and water. Consequently,
    the significance of water culture in addressing water crises and guaranteeing
    water security has emerged as a prominent concern and focal point in contemporary
    global change and water science. During the nascent stages of human civilization,
    water security concerns primarily stemmed from natural occurrences, such as droughts,
    floods, and river diversions. However, in contemporary times, water security issues
    have predominantly arisen owing to factors. These issues manifest in various forms,
    including water scarcity, water pollution, aquatic environment degradation, flood
    disasters, ecological and social instability, and threats to national security
    (Shao et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020). Vital scientific issues for water security
    include understanding and predicting the impacts of environmental changes on water
    quantity, water quality, and aquatic ecosystems and understanding the impact of
    social values and social controls on water management (Wheater and Gober, 2015).
    Governance is the main challenge in water security (Grumbine, 2018; Lutz-Ley et
    al., 2021). Social stratification, cultural beliefs, and cognitive biases strongly
    influence how different social groups can change, perceive, and adapt to hydrological
    changes. Additionally, these heterogeneous factors determine how water governance
    unfolds, and consequently, how water is managed at different scales (Di Baldassarre
    et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2017). Water security management involves complex decision-making
    processes. It rarely involves multiple dimensions of environmental stressors or
    individual dimensions, and there are still no better governance ideas to date.
    The adoption of water culture as a significant approach to address current water
    security challenges, promote sustainable water resource utilization, and preserve
    a healthy water environment is imperative and time-sensitive. Water conservation
    infrastructure is a crucial component of the national economic infrastructure
    and serves a vital and irreplaceable function in flood control, water supply,
    food production, economic development, and ecological security (Dong et al., 2022;
    Li et al., 2023a, Li et al., 2023b; Xing et al., 2023). Nevertheless, in the context
    of modern society, it is insufficient to depend exclusively on technology and
    engineering to address water security issues stemming from current water crises.
    Additional strategies are essential, such as the establishment of scientific values,
    behavioral patterns, systems, and norms for human beings regarding water. This
    involves the effort and constraints imposed by human beings, coupled with cultural,
    technological, and engineering approaches, to address the growing water security
    challenges. The fundamental objective of water culture is to examine the relationship
    between people, water, and the change resulting from feedback from the human water
    system (van Emmerik et al., 2014). Research on water culture is currently mainly
    conducted through social surveys from the perspectives of risk perception (Mankad
    and Tapsuwan, 2011), social norms and values (Mankad et al., 2019), environmental
    awareness (van Emmerik et al., 2014), people''s response to drought (Lindsay et
    al., 2017), household consumption behavior (Addo et al., 2018; Eck et al., 2019;
    Koh, 2020), and attitudes towards policies (Adapa, 2018). Domestic and foreign
    scholars have endeavored to investigate the influence of water culture on human
    systems and the water cycle through quantitative analysis of its evolution (Lu
    et al., 2018; Wei et al., 2015; Werdiningtyas et al., 2020a). The above research
    suggests that social surveys, media, and policies can be used indirectly to generalize
    the relationship between changing values and norms and human behavior concerning
    the environment. This provides a new perspective for studying the changes in water
    culture. Some scholars also believe that “water” is a public service mainly provided
    by the government. Certain issues, such as the total amount of water resources,
    water resource allocation, water conservancy facility capacity, and social equity
    in water supply, are closely associated with the public service function of the
    government (Buntaine et al., 2021; Chou et al., 2021; Qian et al., 2021). Substantive
    policy instruments are vital for maintaining sustainability by establishing trade-offs
    that balance supply (biophysical systems) and demand (social systems). Policy
    instruments can evolve in response to changing conditions and issues in environments
    where stability and change are closely intertwined. Policies alone cannot solve
    many of the degradation problems. However, a combination of education, policy,
    scientific knowledge, planning, and the enforcement of relevant laws can provide
    mechanisms to delay the rate of degradation (Werdiningtyas et al., 2020b). Local
    or national water resource management decisions, regardless of whether they are
    infrastructure-related or policy-related, can have positive or negative impacts
    that often last for an extended period (van Emmerik et al., 2014). Given the growing
    demand for water resources to satisfy a growing population, there is an urgent
    need to make water resource management decisions based on long-term (decades to
    centuries) evolving characteristics. Current research has rarely explored the
    impact and relationship of water culture on ensuring water security, especially
    its significance for sustainable water resources development. Therefore, this
    study considered the evolution and mutual feedback relationship between water
    culture and water security as its research goal. China has an extensive history
    of water management and culture. The practical and far-reaching historical significance
    of strengthening the construction of water culture, vigorously promoting the development
    of water conservancy for human livelihoods, concentrating on the construction
    of modern water conservancy, actively promoting the construction of an ecological
    civilization, and comprehensively enhancing the soft power and image of water
    conservancy cannot be overstated. The objective of this study was to devise a
    method to quantitatively describe the evolution of water cultures. The policy
    documents for the Weihe River Basin (WRB) are illustrative cases in this study.
    The geographical and socioeconomic characteristics of the WRB are similar to those
    of other semi-arid and sub-humid transitional zones, and water scarcity in the
    context of climate change is a significant problem (Deng et al., 2020; Zhang et
    al., 2022). This means that water is often a restrictive resource for social and
    economic development, often leading to severe human-water conflicts. The WRB offers
    insights similar to those of many places worldwide regarding overuse and abuse,
    and the transition described later in this article may be relevant to many other
    watersheds now or in the future. This article aimed to address three specific
    research questions by constructing a co-evolution framework of water security
    and culture based on a policy analysis of WRB management. 1) In the past hundred
    years, how has the development of water culture in the WRB evolved? 2) How do
    the water security issues corresponding to each evolutionary phase evolve? 3)
    Under what background does the co-evolution process occur between the two, and
    what factors may trigger this transformation? The aim of this study was to reveal
    policy-led patterns of water culture change and their mutual feedback with water
    security and to innovatively scrutinize the development of water security from
    the perspective of water culture. Therefore, we need to explore the development
    and evolution of water culture in the WRB and clarify important issues in the
    development of water culture. Exploring the mutual feedback relationship between
    water culture and water security in the WRB will provide a basis for incorporating
    water culture into watershed management in the future, which is crucial for developing
    a more sustainable watershed. Simultaneously, governments and policymakers can
    better cope with the complexities of water management and ensure a balance between
    water culture and water security, which can ultimately benefit the society. 2.
    Materials and methods 2.1. Study area As the largest tributary of the Yellow River,
    the Weihe River is located in a transition zone between arid, continental monsoon
    climates, and humid areas. With poor vegetation coverage and severe soil erosion,
    it is the main sediment source area in this region and one of the main sediment-producing
    areas in the Yellow River Basin. The quality of the ecological environment in
    the WRB directly affects the protection of the ecological environment and high-quality
    development in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River. Therefore, strengthening
    the ecological protection and management of the WRB is essential. The study area
    selected in this article mainly flows through Pingliang, Qingyang, Tianshui, and
    Dingxi cities in Gansu Province and Xianyang, Baoji, Xi''an, Tongchuan, Weinan,
    and Yan''an cities in Shaanxi Province (Fig. 1). However, the demand for water
    resources remains high owing to the continuous social and economic development
    along the Weihe River. Multiple water security issues, such as water shortages,
    severe water environment pollution, fragile ecological environments, and frequent
    water disasters, are intertwined and seriously restrict the economic and social
    development of cities along river basins (Wang et al., 2021). National and local
    governments have taken some measures, such as diverting water from the Han River
    to the Weihe River, large-scale water-saving and renovation projects in irrigation
    districts, and the transfer of water rights (He et al., 2020). However, because
    of the inadequate water resources of the Weihe River and the long-term pursuit
    of rapid economic development, the scale of water use approaches or exceeds the
    carrying capacity of water resources, placing significant strain on the water
    resource system. Water scarcity continues to be the most significant impediment
    to the ecological well-being and the social economy of river basins. Download

    Overview of the study area. 2.2. Methodology 2.2.1. Water culture-water security
    co-evolution framework A co-evolution framework was used to explain how the evolution
    of water culture feeds into water security indicators (Fig. 2). The framework
    was used to identify the critical dynamics of water culture and water security.
    Because the evolution of water culture, water security indicators, and watershed
    management policies and practices co-occur and influence each other, participatory
    approaches have been used to understand recent developments in the social dimensions
    of water resource management (Wei et al., 2015). This co-evolving water culture-water
    security framework links each phase of water culture change to water security
    change to capture triggers and reveal co-evolving interactive dynamics. In this
    study, the main water policies and water security indicators used since 1949 were
    analyzed to reconstruct the co-evolution process of water culture and water security
    by categorizing water culture and water security into different phases, which
    were further qualitatively analyzed. Download : Download high-res image (454KB)

    framework. 2.2.2. Word frequency analysis Content analysis is a research method
    that objectively, systematically, and quantitatively describes communication content.
    Its essence is to analyze the information in the communication content and its
    changes, inferring an accurate meaning from the meaningful words and sentences
    represented (Cheng et al., 2022). A content analysis is a layer-by-layer reasoning
    process. Word frequency analysis is not a novel method, and the reason for choosing
    it is that this method is scientifically intuitive and can accurately capture
    the focus of a large amount of data for quantitative analysis (Wu et al., 2021a).
    Word frequency analysis analyses meaningful words and phrases by extrapolating
    them to the results of accurate meaning, which is the strength of this method.
    Combined with the policy data collected, word frequency analysis is a very applicable
    and reasonable method to count and determine the evolution stages of water culture.
    Water policies can reflect the changes in human values and norms when managing
    water crises. Water culture is often expressed through unstructured social symbols
    (such as words). Therefore, this study uses specific words in ideological policy
    documents to represent water culture. Changes in the water culture can be revealed
    through changes in vocabulary and word frequency in policy documents over time.
    In this study, we analyzed the process of water culture change in WRB from 1949
    to 2020 by collecting documents and notices issued by national, ministerial, and
    provincial units since 1949. We analyzed the “water”-related headline elements
    based on the method of content analysis to understand the characteristics of the
    evolution of water culture. The Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Lexical
    Analysis System (ICTCLAS), a participle method, was developed by the Institute
    of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences based on years of accumulated
    research (http://ictclas.nlpir.org/). The ICTCLAS participle method has been publicly
    evaluated by national and international authorities and is characterized by an
    optimal comprehensive performance. Therefore, based on a customized professional
    domain dictionary, the policy titles in the corpus were segmented using ICT-CLAS
    5.0, to remove duplicates, memorable characters, and meaningless stop words (Wu
    et al., 2021b), yielding 4964 words. 2.2.3. Calculation of water security index
    system and comprehensive weight 1. Building a system of water security indicators
    To capture the evolving concepts of water security, it is essential to consider
    the shifting emphasis on water security. A higher emphasis on water security indicators
    suggests a lower level of safety in water security during that specific period.
    Due to the limitation of time scale, the principles of availability, scientificity
    and representativeness need to be combined in the search for indicators, and the
    time scale of some commonly used indicators is difficult to realize, so alternative
    indicators with better access are chosen. Therefore, based on the above principles,
    this study constructed a water security indicator system. Many factors are involved
    in water safety systems, and they include four first-level indicators and two
    second-level indicators with different categories and attributes. Based on existing
    studies (Shao et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020), we first categorized water security
    into four dimensions: water disasters, water resources, water environment, and
    water ecological security. The indicator systems are listed in Table 1. (1) Water
    disaster security. Unprecedented economic development and urbanization since the
    establishment of the country, coupled with global climate change, have increased
    the risk of water-related disasters (Güneralp et al., 2015). Water disaster safety
    indicators were categorized into drought and flood, and drought and flood frequency
    indicators were used to characterize the degree of water crisis caused by water
    hazards at different stages. The higher the frequency of water disasters, the
    greater the government''s attention, highlighting the vulnerability of water security.
    To reduce risk, infrastructure construction must be strengthened, management standards
    must be improved, and the capacity to withstand flood disasters and post-disaster
    recovery capabilities must be significantly enhanced. (2) Water resource security.
    This involves water demand to support agricultural development. The indicators
    of water resource security examine the agricultural water demand at each water
    culture stage to determine whether it can meet the requirements of stable social
    and economic development and will not hinder or endanger its stability (Haddeland
    et al., 2014). Reservoirs are an essential means for governments to manage water
    (Kuil et al., 2016), and they are a good reflection of the relationship between
    water culture and water security. The more insecure the water resources are, the
    more reservoirs will be built. Water is more economically significant than it
    was in the past owing to the current era of accelerated development. Moreover,
    the coordination of economic style, policy regulation methods, water resource
    allocation and management, and the promotion of sustainable economic development
    are crucial to the development of WRB. (3) Water environment security. This involves
    ensuring the safety and reliability of the water system and adequately solving
    problems, such as water supply, drainage, and sewage in urban and rural areas.
    The water environment security indicator represents the degree of water security
    measured at various stages from the perspective of the physical and chemical existence
    of water resources. The factors that affect the suitability of water for various
    uses are based on the fact that water resources are in a state of sufficiency,
    cleanliness, and high capacity for self-healing, and renewal and that water quality,
    culture, and security are interlinked and critical to the survival of human beings
    and the environment (Chen et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016; Yuksel et al., 2018;
    Yuksel et al., 2021). We chose the water pollution level, runoff, and sediment
    transport as indicators of water environment safety. The challenge is to strengthen
    urban and rural water management to build livable cities and maintain urban vitality.
    (4) Water ecological security. This involves the health and ecology of water environments.
    Water ecological indicators reflect the need to balance humans health and the
    ecology at various stages. Rapid economic development has triggered many aquatic
    and ecological problems in the WRB. We chose minimum ecological water demand distance
    average and wetland area as indicators of water ecological security (Salimi et
    al., 2021; Ye et al., 2020). It is important that government shifts to green economic
    growth as soon as possible. 2. AHP-EWM comprehensive weight calculation Table

    is a subjective calculation and the Entropy Weight Method (EWM) is an objective
    calculation, the principles of the two weight calculation methods are different;
    therefore, the two methods are combined to make the weight more authentic (Li
    et al., 2023a, Li et al., 2023b; Zhang et al., 2023). (1) In Eq. (1), Wj is the

    Calculate the composite score: (2) Pij represents the standardized value of indicator
    i in indicator stratum j, and Sj represents the composite score of the water safety
    indicators. The larger the composite score value, the more importance is attached
    to the water safety of an indicator stratum, and the more unsafe the water safety.
    2.3. Data sources Laws and regulations, notification documents, and regulations
    in Shaanxi and Gansu Province were obtained from the Shaanxi Provincial Archives,
    Beida Fabulous (https://m.pkulaw.com/). This paper is only recorded with the “water”-related
    keywords based on the title of the policy, for a total of 3194 collected (no data
    collected for 1967–1977). The water safety indicators are mainly collected from
    the local records, water conservancy records, water conservancy yearbooks, and
    water resources bulletins of Pingliang, Qingyang, Tianshui, and Dingxi in Gansu
    Province, and Xianyang, Baoji, Xi''an, Tongchuan, Weinan, and Yan''an in Shaanxi
    Province. Further details are presented in Table 1. 3. Results 3.1. Phase division
    Based on the word classification and word frequency statistics of the titles of
    “water”-related documents collected from 1949 to 2020 (no data were collected
    from 1967 to 1977), the evolution of the theme of water culture in each decade
    was determined. As shown in Fig. 3, the themes of flood control and drought resistance
    were present throughout the evolution of water culture. Before the 1970s, the
    frequency of flood-related keywords was higher than that of the other keywords.
    Throughout the evolutionary process, humans have continued to improve hydrological
    technologies to mitigate the effects of droughts and floods and to increase the
    availability of water resources through water governance activities, such as flood
    control projects and the construction of reservoirs. Water conservation and irrigation
    projects were the lifeblood of agriculture as an early agricultural area in the
    WRB. In the 1980s and 1990s, the theme of farmland water conservation accounted
    for the largest proportion. After 2000, the government paid more attention to
    water shortages, alleviating them by adjusting water prices and preventing and
    controlling pollution. Since 2010, water conservation has become a central theme,
    with a focus on the sustainable development of water resources. Along with essential
    events in China, rapid economic development, urbanization, and a significant increase
    in industrial and agricultural productivity have occurred after the implementation
    of the Reform and Opening-up (1978) policy. Therefore, the demand for water resources
    has increased, and keywords related to urban and rural water supplies have begun
    to increase. After 1998, policy documents on the sustainable use of water resources,
    such as water-saving, water resource protection, and water quality management,
    were higher than those on other topics. This may also indicate a growing emphasis
    on water resource management and protection during this period, with efforts being
    made to promote sustained improvement in the quality of the water environment
    and breakthroughs in ecological protection and restoration of rivers and lakes.
    The first two phases of the evolution of water culture change in the WRB mainly
    meet human needs, whereas the last two phases support the sustainable development
    of human and ecological needs. Therefore, combined with the analysis, the evolution
    of water culture was categorized into four phases: 1949–1967 (Disaster-resistant
    Hydraulic Phase), 1968–1998 (Irrigation Hydraulic Phase), 1999–2010 (Resources
    Hydraulic Phase), and 2011–2020 (Ecological Hydraulic Phase). Download : Download

    the water culture theme. 3.2. Evolution process of water cultural values 3.2.1.
    Disaster-resistant hydraulic phase (1949–1967) This phase is associated with the
    early days of China''s founding and the period of restoring livelihoods restoration.
    The frequency of keywords for the water disaster categories—flood, drought, and
    drought preparedness—was high. During this period, when natural floods and droughts
    are frequent, the country pays more attention to water disasters. In the early
    days of China''s founding, agricultural development was emphasized; however, flood
    disasters affected agricultural development, which, in turn, affected economic
    development. Therefore, water conservation has begun to be implemented. At this
    time, the water conservancy project began to build flood control projects through
    the construction of reservoirs to reduce the impact of floods and droughts and
    ensure sustainable agricultural production and socio-economic development. Shaanxi
    and Gansu Provinces have constructed farmland water conservancy capital, focusing
    on drought and flood control to increase agricultural productivity and promote
    agricultural production and rural economic development. Implementing the water
    conservancy policy of “preventing flooding and constructing water conservancy
    to achieve the purpose of mass production” has determined that the main focus
    is farmland irrigation projects. To the best of our knowledge, several large-
    and medium-sized irrigation projects have been constructed. Baoji Xia introduced
    the Weihe irrigation project, which was designed in 1958 to cope with agricultural
    losses caused by drought after water conservancy engineering measures. In 1960,
    the Sanmenxia Reservoir was built to cope with the dangers of Yellow River floods,
    mitigate the impact of flood disasters, and regulate the amount of water in the
    Yellow River. The Jinghui Canal farmland water conservancy project, which appeared
    more frequently in this phase, was initiated to combat severe drought and the
    massive losses it caused. During the drought, agricultural production heavily
    suffered, and the rural economy collapsed, which drew the attention of the central
    government and local authorities to the construction of farmland water conservancy
    in Shaanxi. 3.2.2. Irrigation hydraulic phase (1968–1998) Beginning in 1967, it
    was divided into two parts. The state gradually increased its investment in capital
    construction for water conservation during the first half of this phase (until
    1988). During this period, water conservation projects mainly focused on irrigation
    initiatives, involving water intake, water supply, and hydroelectric irrigation
    projects. These projects addressed the water requirements for agricultural use,
    contributing to agricultural development. Between 1989 and 1998, 1986 was the
    first year of the implementation of the “Seventh Five-Year Plan.” From that year
    onwards, the masses were mobilized and organized twice a year, in summer and winter,
    to carry out the basic construction of farmland water conservation centered on
    water treatment and soil reformation. The guideline for constructing farmland
    water conservancy was established as “small-scale oriented, complementary oriented,
    water-saving oriented, and watering expanded oriented.” In 1988, the country promulgated
    the Water Law of the People''s Republic of China, which proposed that the country
    implement water planning and practice water conservation, elevating water conservation
    to the level of national law, and that water-saving irrigation began to promote
    the implementation of the water abstraction permit system. In the 1990s, there
    was a decline in total water resources, accompanied by an increase in the energy
    industry demands and urban domestic water consumption. Consequently, the conflicts
    over water between industries and agriculture have become heightened. In addition,
    the availability of water for existing ground irrigation is not guaranteed, and
    the water projects are old and undergoing disrepair. To meet the demand for water
    for social and economic development, farmland water conservancy construction must
    focus on reducing water consumption. The keywords “irrigation project” and “water
    diversion project” appeared more frequently. The continuation of irrigation projects
    is critical for water conservancy construction at this stage, and investment in
    capital construction continues to increase. In 1991, it was proposed that the
    construction of farmland water conservancy should continue on a large scale to
    further increase the irrigated area and improve irrigation conditions. Simultaneously,
    the focus of agricultural irrigation development has shifted towards water-saving
    irrigation. In 1995, it was first proposed to “vigorously popularize water-saving
    irrigation technology.” In developing farmland irrigation, it is necessary not
    only to ensure that the construction of new water source projects is completed
    on schedule but also to develop water-saving irrigation comprehensively. 3.2.3.
    Resources hydraulic phase (1999–2010) In 2000, the central government proposed
    “building a water-saving society” for the first time in its recommendations on
    formulating the 10th 5-year plan for national economic and social development.
    At this stage, water resource problems have become prominent, and there is an
    urgent need to reduce the impact of water shortages on social development. Water
    resource management is carried out in both urban and rural areas, with urban areas
    focusing more on water supply and water pollution prevention to ensure the economic
    and social development of the city. Rural areas focus on farmland water conservation,
    reforming and developing farmland water conservation, and working together to
    build a water-saving society. Measures are implemented both quantitatively and
    qualitatively to achieve sustainable utilization of water resources. This adjustment
    in water allocation policy can be viewed as a response of the social system to
    changes in the hydrological system. The implementation of water volume dispatch
    in the Yellow River Basin rationally allocates water resources, conducts water
    resource price management, and economically restricts water use. Attention should
    also be paid to the water pollution problem in the WRB to strengthen water pollution
    prevention and control. At this stage, as the country attaches great importance
    to water conservancy construction, water conservancy investment continues to grow,
    and the water conservancy supply expands. With the implementation of national
    sustainable development strategies, the protection of water environments protection
    has received increasing attention. Owing to the shortage of water resources and
    the deterioration of water quality, the disparity between water supply and demand
    has become prominent, and the degree of constraints on water resources in the
    economy has begun to appear. The sustainable development of water resources relies
    primarily on the comprehensive implementation of water conservation and a gradual
    shift from total expansion to efficiency improvement. The country attaches great
    importance to agricultural production, which has strengthened farmland water conservation.
    Additionally, water-saving irrigation has improved and agricultural production
    has continuously increased, with farmland water conservation construction playing
    an important role. In terms of urban water supply, many cities have strengthened
    water conservation management through industrial restructuring, and per capita
    comprehensive water use has declined. The increase in urban residential water
    use has been commensurate with the decrease in urban productive water use. However,
    urban water shortages have become increasingly prominent because of water pollution
    and water shortages. Overall, the economic demand for water conservation development
    changes with shifts in the economic growth stage. 3.2.4. Ecological hydraulic
    phase (2011–2020) During this period, the country implemented the strictest water
    resource management system. In 2011, the central government made water conservation
    essential. Greater emphasis was placed on rural water reform, with comprehensive
    reforms in agricultural water pricing, promotion of water-saving technologies,
    comprehensive promotion of a water-saving society, and a growing awareness of
    water conservation. At the same time, it focuses on the development of ecological
    water conservancy and the safety of drinking water, improves the ecological environment,
    builds water conservancy scenic areas, establishes wetland ecosystems. The period
    of 2011–2020 plays a crucial role in advancing the overall development of water
    conservancy, and the planning and implementation of various types of water conservancy
    projects necessitate consistent inputs for stable growth and marked expansion.
    During this phase, water infrastructure development in the study area focused
    on livelihood projects for safe rural drinking water, rehabilitation of small
    reservoirs, and renewal of large-scale and key medium-sized irrigation districts
    with water-saving and renovation tasks. Droughts and floods have always existed,
    and there is still a need to comprehensively accelerate the construction of flood
    storage areas and complete the monitoring, early warning, crowd-surveying, and
    prevention systems. The construction of a water ecological civilization system
    is the focus of urban ecological environmental protection projects. Rational allocation
    and sustainable use of water resources, improvement of the water ecological environment,
    and awareness of the residents of water ecological civilization are essential
    guarantees for sustainable economic and social development. To verify whether
    our classification of the stages was appropriate, we counted the most representative
    and frequent keywords in the four periods. We analyzed their evolution throughout
    the stages. For example, for the Disaster-resistant hydraulic phase, we selected
    “drought prevention and control,” “flooding,” “flood control,” “drought,” or “flood
    control project”. For the Irrigation hydraulic phase, we selected “water intake
    project,” “water supply project,” “irrigation expansion project,” “irrigation”.
    For the Resources hydraulic phase, we selected “water-saving society,” “water
    pollution prevention and control,” “urban water supply,” “water dispatch,” “water
    resource fees,” “water abstraction permit,” “water diversion project”; Ecological
    hydraulic phase selects “water conservation technology,” “water-saving society,”
    “water conservation,” “water saving,” “comprehensive reform of agricultural water
    prices,” “water ecology,” “ecology,” “environment.” As shown in Fig. 4, the topic
    of disaster prevention with regard to water resources has persisted over time,
    with the highest frequency in the early stage of the country''s founding. The
    frequency decreased in the middle stage, and the frequency of the disaster topic
    increased after 2010 due to the increase in the number of extreme events caused
    by climate change after 2000. In the later stage, as the government enhances the
    awareness of environmental protection among the people, sustainable development
    of water resources is valued, and efforts are made to promote the continuous improvement
    of the quality of the water environment and the ecological protection and restoration
    of rivers and lakes. Based on the above analyses, the four stages were categorized
    in alignment with reality, rendering them applicable for future water security

    process 3.3.1. Evolution process of water security indicators Water security concerns
    include water crises, such as water disasters, shortages, pollution, and ecological
    degradation. Fig. 5 shows the evolution of water security indicators in the WRB
    at different stages of water culture evolution. Water disaster indicators show
    that droughts and floods have accompanied the evolution of water culture throughout
    this period, with droughts occurring more frequently before the 1970s. Between
    the 1970s and the 1990s, the frequency of droughts declined and then increased,
    with successive droughts occurring during this period. The frequency decreased
    after the 1990s. However, the number of floods remained high, even the 1970s.
    Water resource indicators showed that medium and large reservoirs increased faster
    during the irrigation hydraulic stage. During this period, different water conservation
    projects were developed for irrigation in WRB. The agricultural water shortage
    rate significantly decreased during this period due to the construction of water
    conservancy reservoirs. The water resource utilization rate also showed a clear
    upward trend. Water pollution indicators show that the pollution level is lower
    in the irrigation hydraulic stage than in the later stages and can be used for
    agricultural irrigation. However, in the resource hydraulic stage, the pollution
    level is higher, and the water quality is insufficient for agricultural irrigation
    and domestic water production. Simultaneously, during this stage, the sand transport
    and flow rates exhibited a clear downward trend. A reduction in sediment transport
    affects riverbank erosion and sediment distribution in waterbodies, thereby affecting
    the structure and function of the ecosystem. The water ecological indicators show
    that the annual minimum ecological water demand, compared with the average of
    the multi-year minimum ecological water demand, met the minimum ecological water
    demand before the 1970s. After the irrigation hydraulic phase, the minimum ecological
    water demand decreased. To ensure water consumption for human life and production,
    the ecological water in the river channel is overcrowded, and the ecological health
    of the basin is threatened. After 1980, the wetland area significantly decreased,
    and cities continuously occupied wetland areas. Wetland degradation and other
    problems have become severe. Download : Download high-res image (799KB) Download

    3.3.2. Water security assessment The calculation results of the AHP-EWM comprehensive
    evaluation showed that the focus on water security differed at different water
    culture stages (Fig. 6a). Water disaster safety indicators are critical during
    disaster-resistant hydraulic phases. During this phase, water culture became more
    concerned with safety issues arising from water-related disasters due to the severe
    socio-economic losses caused by droughts and floods. Therefore, different policies
    have focused on adapting to and mitigating the impacts of water hazards through
    hydraulic engineering. However, at this stage, the index at the water ecological
    indicator level was the lowest, possibly because of slower economic development
    and lower development of the ecological environment. The water shortage problem
    became prominent during the irrigation hydraulic phase. As a result of the intensive
    development of agriculture during this period, the construction of reservoirs
    not only met the demand for irrigation, but also prevented and stored floods to
    mitigate the adverse effects of droughts and floods on the development of agriculture.
    This was one of the reasons for the lowest safety index of water disasters in
    this period. Water pollution deepens during the resource hydraulic phase, leading
    to an increasingly severe shortage of water quality resources. Water environmental
    safety is more prominent than the other indicator strata, with a policy bias towards
    addressing water quality issues and a higher water environment index. In the ecological
    hydraulic phase, over-intervention and high-intensity development of the WRB have
    led to problems of imbalance in the basin ecosystem and threats to ecological
    security, with the highest index of water ecological security indicators. This
    led to a greater focus on ecologically sustainable development in the WRB and
    the adoption of measures to mitigate ecological problems and strengthen the security
    of water ecosystems. Download : Download high-res image (237KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 6. (a) Water security evaluation under different water culture
    phases (b) total water security index. The results of the water security assessment
    showed that the water disaster security dimension was highest in the disaster-resistant
    hydraulic phase, lowest in the irrigation hydraulic phase, and increased in the
    latter two phases, possibly because of the increase in extreme events that led
    to an increase in the water disaster security index after 2000 (Du et al., 2023).
    The water resource security level index is declining and a continuous increase
    in reservoirs and water diversion projects can reduce the demand for irrigation
    water. Both the water environment security and the water ecological security indices
    increased. In the later stages of development, the issue of sustainable development
    of water resources is receiving increasing attention, and the disparity between
    supply and demand is constantly being highlighted. This gap has led to insufficient
    ecological water in rivers and the degradation of water ecological functions.
    However, water policies often focus on solving the immediate water security problems,
    often neglecting the comprehensive and simultaneous consideration of all existing
    water security challenges. Consequently, the total water security index decreased
    during the hydraulic irrigation phase and then increased during the resource hydraulic
    and ecological hydraulic phases (Fig. 6b). This shows that the government lacks
    comprehensive analysis and judgment of the consequences of policies, resulting
    in persistent water security problems. The governance of the WRB remains a daunting
    task. 3.4. Analysis of the co-evolution of water culture and water security Existing
    water management practices, including water supply reliability, agricultural water
    security, and water ecosystem security, do not address the impact of climate change
    on water security (Chen et al., 2016; Jiang, 2015; Lewis, 2009; Qiu et al., 2012).
    During the evolution of water culture, engineering and non-engineering measures
    have been used to mitigate water security issues in the development process. Watersheds
    effectively address and regulate water security by fostering through water culture,
    and water security issues provide valuable feedback. Reservoir engineering was
    conducted throughout the developmental stage. Reservoirs are a vital water conservancy
    engineering measure and important indicators of water cultural material forms
    and water engineering technology. With the evolution of the water culture stage,
    the disaster-resistant hydraulic phase of water security problems has been highlighted
    by losses caused by droughts and floods. To mitigate the impacts of droughts and
    floods on agricultural development, the government issued a document to initiate
    reservoir construction. At the irrigation hydraulics stage, water security problems
    are more mainly involve water shortages. Water shortages affect the development
    of agriculture and ultimately limit the development of urban, and rural, ecological,
    and economic societies. Currently, the government must implement hydraulic engineering
    measures to ease pressure on agricultural water use. Reservoir scheduling has
    gradually changed from a conventional scheduling mode focuses on pollution prevention
    and profitability objectives (flood control, power generation, water supply, and
    irrigation) to an ecological scheduling mode that considers water ecosystem downstream
    of the reservoir and in the reservoir area (Lei et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023).
    In the resource hydraulic phase, the problem of water pollution remains severe,
    affecting the water environment and the safety of the basin. At this time, the
    government issued a policy to build water conservancy projects, mainly water diversion
    projects, to protect the safety of water sources. However, during the ecological
    hydraulic phase, the deterioration of water ecosystems, threats to ecosystem health,
    and the degradation of wetlands affect the ecological security of watersheds.
    The current policies protect the safety of rural drinking water, favor water conservation,
    and maintain the sustainable development of water resources. Moreover, under the
    guidance of the government, the awareness of water conservation and water ecology
    protection among the masses is increasing, indicating a top-down governance mode.
    Policies will favor the governance of water safety problems at different stages
    of water culture, and water safety problems after governance will reflect the
    appropriateness of government policies at that time. 4. Discussion The success
    or failure of many water policies and management practices depends on their ability
    to deal with complex human-water relationships. Our study revealed the evolution
    of water culture and its valuable feedback on water security, providing a new
    perspective for combating water security challenges. The results show that the
    evolution phases of water culture changes and water security in the WRB are relatively
    consistent with existing research results (Lu et al., 2018; Wei et al., 2015).
    Although our findings were empirical, they are significant for future theoretical
    research. In addition, our co-evolutionary water culture-water security framework
    links water culture change with its water security evolution. Therefore, it can
    provide a clear roadmap for the future governance of water security issues by
    identifying the state (phase) of water culture and which policies and engineering
    should be used to manage water crises based on the water security issues that
    have emerged at each stage. In future studies, it will be possible to simulate
    and predict the evolutionary dynamics of water security under future policies
    and provide feedback on the appropriateness of policies based on their current
    state in conjunction with different water security outcomes. Our approach could
    be helpful for policy development in other watershed management systems with long
    histories of development. The evolving relationship between water culture and
    water security is reflected in the development of WRB. Early in the establishment
    of the country, the theme of water culture mainly focused on meeting human needs,
    especially for agricultural irrigation and farmland water conservancy construction.
    This phase focuses on ensuring that sufficient water resources are available to
    support livelihoods and agricultural production, and that soil and water conservation
    are integrated into farmland infrastructure and primary agricultural production,
    and human water needs are guaranteed (Ping et al., 2013). However, with the development
    of times and improvement in awareness, water resource management has gradually
    transformed from water supply management to water demand management. The government
    introduced a series of policies and regulations, including rational water allocation,
    water abstraction permit management, water pricing policies, and water pollution
    prevention to cope with new water safety requirements (Chen et al., 2020; Kim,
    2008). During this period, the theme of water culture gradually expanded from
    the single construction and management of farmland water conservancy to a more
    integrated river governance and water resource management oriented towards water
    scarcity and the ecological environment. The focus of water conservancy investment
    has gradually shifted towards water supply, and investment in water conservation
    and ecological fields has begun. The last two stages of water culture development
    focus on sustainable development that supports human and ecological needs. Since
    the Tenth Five-Year Plan period (2001–2005), policy themes have shifted to water
    resource management and the ecological environment. While investment in water
    resources is still focused on flood prevention and removal, investment in water
    supply is gradually increasing. Investments in soil and water conservation and
    ecological protection are also emerging. In 2011, the Central Government emphasized
    the most stringent water resource management system and vigorously developed water
    conservancy for livelihoods, highlighting the critical role of water conservancy
    in safeguarding the economy, ecology, and national security (Cheng et al., 2022;
    Zuo et al., 2014). The core themes of water culture are water resource management
    policies and sustainable development goals and plans. The government prioritized
    water saving in all aspects. It has implemented a comprehensive water resource
    management program that includes water disaster prevention and control, water
    resource conservation, water ecology protection and restoration, and water environment
    management. The water culture of this period focused more on conformity with and
    protection of nature, emphasizing conservation, protection, and ecological priorities.
    Policy is a tool that reflects the cultural perceptions of water. Different policies
    have evolved to reflect changes in society''s perceptions of water culture and
    water safety. This change reflects advances in technology and knowledge, growing
    awareness of water resources, and expanding understanding of water security issues
    (Bakker, 2012; Werdiningtyas et al., 2020b). Thus, policy as a tool for expressing
    social perceptions provides a window into the mutually evolutionary relationship
    between water culture and water security (Bakker, 2012). An analysis of past policies
    and practices can facilitate the understanding of current state of water culture
    and security. This understanding allows policymakers to refrain from adopting
    new policy instruments without adequate knowledge of the past and current circumstances.
    In contrast, the government can guide governance changes based on an in-depth
    analysis and provide more effective solutions. Water culture requires a comprehensive
    and systematic approach for managing water security issues. In the past, water
    security management has often focused on solving single problems, such as flood
    control, irrigation, and water supply. However, water security is often a complex
    systemic issue that must be considered holistically. The state of water culture
    and the evolving relationship with water security can provide decision-makers
    with a more comprehensive and systematic perspective, facilitating their understanding
    of the nature of the problem towards the development of improved solutions. This
    study argues that future policies should strengthen ecological restoration and
    governance, improve water and sand regulation, and flood prevention, and disaster
    mitigation systems, and build a synergistic watershed management institutional
    mechanism. At the same time, this paper argues that the research results can be
    applied to water resources management and benefit the society through the following
    points. (1) Developing an integrated water security policy: Based on the results
    of the study, it is recommended that a more integrated and systematic water security
    policy be developed. (2) Focus on long-term planning: By understanding past changes
    in water culture, it is possible to better predict possible future problems and
    take effective measures to ensure water security. (3) Strengthening social participation:
    The government can increase social participation in water resources management
    and jointly promote water security by conducting public education and collecting
    public opinions through the Internet. (4) Technological innovation and sustainable
    development: When formulating water resources management policies, new technologies
    and sustainable development strategies should be considered. (5) Periodic assessment
    and adjustment: With social, economic and environmental changes, policies need
    to be flexible and adaptable to meet new water security challenges and needs.
    In conclusion, it is also necessary to continuously explore new directions, technologies,
    and strategies to adapt to the ever-changing challenges of water culture and water
    security and achieve the goal of high-quality development. It is important to
    note that quantitative analyses of water culture change are in a static form,
    limiting the ability to unravel the dynamic structural information inherent in
    the underlying knowledge. Moreover, the completeness of data samples and the depth
    of word frequency interpretations will have different impacts on the study of
    water culture. It should be noted that the social value of water culture in terms
    of the policy identified in this study is only a rough reflection of reality.
    Only policy indicators were selected to reflect the ideology of water culture.
    The next step is to incorporate the material aspects of water culture to provide
    a more representative view of the sustainable development of water resources.
    The water safety indicators examined in this study may have led to less precise
    conclusions because of their reliance on statistical data, which can be difficult
    to gather within specific time frames and from various sources. Addressing these
    challenges require further research and exploration. It is essential to go beyond
    word frequency analysis to quantify water culture and explore more novel methods
    for improved understanding. The mechanisms through which water culture influences
    the water system should be explored to anticipate future changes, with the ultimate
    goal of defining, realizing, and maintaining a desirable or sustainable state
    of water resources. 5. Conclusions This study conducted a quantitative analysis
    of water culture changes and water security issues and found that the evolution
    of water culture is consistent with the policies, water conservancy development
    stages, and water security issues at the periods analyzed. By studying the change
    process in the ideological policies of water culture, it is possible to have a
    better understanding of the mutual feedback relationship between water culture
    and water security, which is key to ensuring the sustainable use of water resources
    in the future. Policy changes in WRB over the last hundred years were chosen as
    the research object, and the evolution of water culture was analyzed based on
    existing collected policy documents with sub-word statistical calculations. The
    mutual feedback relationship between water culture and water security is then
    explored through a comprehensive evaluation and analysis of water security indicators.
    The main findings are as follows. The development and evolution of water culture
    in the Weihe River Basin has undergone four phases: Disaster-resistant Hydraulic
    Phase, Irrigation Hydraulic Phase, Resources Hydraulic Phase, Ecological Hydraulic
    Phase. The results of the water safety evaluation show that more attention is
    paid to water disaster safety in the stage of disaster-resistant hydraulic; more
    attention is paid to water resources safety in the irrigation hydraulic phase;
    more attention is paid to water environment safety in the resources hydraulic
    phase; and more attention is paid to water ecological safety in the ecological
    hydraulic phase. However, the current water policy is biased towards solving current
    water security problems, and this single perspective may limit the breadth and
    depth of the policy. In the future, the government could examine the issue of
    water security from a more comprehensive perspective and combine it with historical
    development experiences to formulate a more comprehensive and sustainable water
    security policy. Funding This work was supported by the National Natural Science

  limitations: The study relies on examining policy documents as a proxy for water
    culture. While this approach provides a structured and quantifiable way to analyze
    water culture evolution, it may not fully capture the nuances and complexities
    of water culture as practiced at the community level. Future research could consider
    incorporating qualitative methods to complement the analysis of policy documents.

    of Pingshuo mining area Article 15 March 2024 Introduction Wetlands are dynamic
    ecosystems known for their vibrant hydrological, chemical, and biological functions,
    covering approximately 6% of the Earth’s surface. (Sonnier et al. 2023; Dar et
    al. 2020). Extensive use of wetlands for agriculture without chemicals provides
    added benefits alongside their other functions (Thorslund et al. 2017; Mitchell
    et al. 2022). Hence, they are acknowledged as the “landscape kidneys” and “biological
    supermarkets” (Alfadhel 2020). However, increasing population density has led
    to challenges such as land encroachment, waste dumping, intensive agriculture,
    runoff, and dredging, resulting in complex wetland pollutants impacting their
    integrity (Newton et al. 2020). These pressures have destroyed a significant portion
    of the world’s wetlands in the last century (Hong et al. 2020; Rafeeque et al.
    2023). Water, the essential foundation of ecological systems, is the most crucial
    natural resource (Jehan et al. 2019; Rashid et al. 2019a). Approximately one-third
    of the global population relies on water for domestic, agricultural, and industrial
    needs (Talpur et al. 2020). Ensuring basic human needs are met involves giving
    equal attention to water quality and quantity, as poor-quality water leads to
    a spectrum of public health challenges (Rashid et al. 2019a; Iqbal et al. 2021).
    In wetland systems, the water persists for a long time, drains out very slowly,
    and constitutes an integral part of the wetlands, providing a unique biogeochemistry
    (Chakraborty et al. 2023). The primary water sources for wetlands are riverine
    inflow, monsoonal outpours, and runoffs (Meng et al. 2019). Wetland water is easily
    susceptible to the influence of various contaminants like pesticides, nutrient
    enrichment, salination, PAHs, and heavy metals (Wu et al. 2018; Jehan et al. 2019).
    These contaminants also enter the food chain upon utilization of contaminated
    water for irrigation purposes (Saraswat et al. 2023). Heavy metals accumulate
    from natural and anthropogenic sources, which include industrial activities, agricultural
    practices, and sewage disposal (Hilali et al. 2023). Though essential in microquantities,
    heavy metals are the primary contaminants among the anthropogenic impacts (Hong
    et al. 2020). Based on the seasons and the physicochemical properties, the behavior
    and bioavailability of these metals vary (Miranda et al. 2021). When present above
    threshold limits, they are toxic to the biota, pose serious environmental and
    health concerns to the living community (Shams et al. 2022) and are categorized
    as hazardous inorganic substances (Khattak et al. 2021). Surface and groundwater
    easily get contaminated with these metals (Rashid et al. 2019a, b, 2023). Their
    persistent nature and resistance to degradation contribute to their bioaccumulation
    in coastal agrarian wetlands, affecting the trophic structure and crop yields
    (Ustaoğlu and Aydin 2020). India is a country where wetlands occupy ≈ 18.4% of
    the total geographical area, excluding rivers (Kaur et al. 2017). These wetlands
    have been the subject of studies highlighting their vulnerable condition, as evidenced
    by recent research (Singh et al. 2020; Pandiyan et al. 2021; Sarkar et al. 2021;
    Shan et al. 2021). Specific reports have claimed a deviation in the quality of
    the wetlands, particularly due to the elevated levels of heavy metals (Shibini
    Mol & Sujatha 2020; Zakir et al. 2020; Nisari and Sujatha 2021; Moushmi et al.
    2022). One contributing factor to this condition is the release of almost 69%
    of the wastewater into the environment without prior treatment (CPCB 2009), which
    ends up in these catchments before finally reaching the marine system. The Kerala
    state, situated in the southern part of India, has an extensive network of rivers,
    canals, and backwaters and hence has a significant proportion of land under the
    wetland category. Since 2005, central Kerala has experienced rapid growth in various
    socio-economic aspects, accompanied by extensive infrastructure development, leading
    to significant and widespread landscape transformations in the region (Sonu et
    al. 2022). Kol wetlands in central Kerala are part and parcel of the Vembanad
    ecosystem, and studies have inferred their degrading character. The scientific
    reports on the water quality of Vembanad (Sasi et al. 2018; Sajeev et al. 2020;
    Mohan et al. 2021) and sediments have revealed that this ecosystem is under exploitation
    beyond its supportive capacity (Salas et al. 2017; Manoj et al. 2018; Sruthi et
    al. 2018; Shyleshchandran et al. 2018). While the Ramsar-designated Kol wetlands
    possess significant ecological importance, limited scientific investigations have
    been conducted to comprehensively assess their physicochemical characteristics
    (Vineetha et al. 2016), the status of metal contamination in sediments (Nisari
    and Sujatha 2021) and sedimentary organic matter composition (Vidya et al. 2023).
    However, information regarding the heavy metal concentration in wetland water
    is scanty. The water quality status provides information regarding the trends
    in the ecosystem and identifies the potential causes and sources of the pollutants
    (Jehan et al. 2019). This study aims to account for the hydrochemical quality
    indices to understand the intricacies and assess these agro-wetland systems’ heavy
    metal pollution profile. The main objectives of the study were (i) to understand
    the spatiotemporal variations in physicochemical parameters of the Kol wetland,
    (ii) to frame a first baseline study of heavy metal concentrations in the Kol
    surface waters during the monsoonal periods, and (iii) evaluation of the extent
    of heavy metal contamination in Kol waters using various pollution indices to
    comprehend their impact on this particular ecosystem. Materials and methods Study
    area Kol wetlands, included as a Ramsar site since 2002 (Ramsar site No:1214),
    are coastal agrarian lands enclosed between two important Rivers, Bharatapuzha
    and Periyar, in the north and south, with the Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea
    on either side having geographical coordinates within 10° 20′ and 10° 40′ N and
    75° 58′ and 76° 15′ E longitudes. Kol refers to the particular type of cultivation
    followed there and means bumper yield. They come under the Central Asian Flyway
    and are a seasonal habitat for migratory birds and diversified assemblages of
    flora and fauna (Menon et al. 2023). This low-lying plain (0.5–1 m below Mean
    Sea Level) remains submerged in water for 6–7 months (June–December) and marshy
    for the rest of the months (January–May). In Kol wetlands, the monsoon water remains
    in the ecosystem throughout the year and is judiciously used for agriculture and
    aquaculture in different terrains. The monsoon influences Kol lands, contributing
    approximately 2763 mm of average rainfall with an average temperature of 28 °C
    (Sarath et al. 2017; Nisari and Sujatha 2021). The wetlands have been utilized
    for agricultural practices in a wise use manner since ancient times. However,
    anthropogenic influences have increased the major threats to this sensitive wetland
    ecosystem (Vidya et al. 2023). Sampling procedure As the monsoon outpour waters
    are a quality deciding factor for the functioning of this agrarian and aquaculture
    Kol lands, the water sampling was conducted during the monsoonal periods in September
    2018 (MON1) and 2019 (MON2). The system was classified as North, Central, and
    South Kol regions based on its geographical positions (Fig. 1). The northern part
    of Kol was designated as ‘North Kol’ (N1–N4). The N1 and N2 sites are from the
    Malappuram region with higher water tables and are recognized for their aquaculture
    practices. The N3 and N4 sites in Thrissur are city regions on opposite sides
    of the National Highway NH47, commercialized with multistore buildings and recreational
    facilities. The ‘Central Kol’ (C1–C4) is the central region in Thrissur, with
    agricultural and cash cropping activities by the farmers in the vicinity. The
    southern part of the Kol wetlands was termed ‘South Kol’ (S1–S4), an agricultural
    region with areas subjected to mining activities in the past (Table 1). The water
    samples (depth = 5 cm) were collected from 12 sites covering the Kol area’s North,
    Central, and South regions, collected in triplicates using clean polyethylene
    bottles rinsed with double distilled water. Appropriate quality assurance procedures
    and precautions were carried out to ensure reliability, and samples were carefully
    handled to avoid external interferences. The samples for metal analysis were collected
    separately, filtered, and fixed with concentrated nitric acid. The samples for
    the analysis were preserved following the standard procedures (APHA 2005). Fig.

    size image Table 1 Description of sampling sites in Kol wetlands Full size table
    Hydrochemical analysis The pH, Electrical Conductivity (EC), Total Dissolved Solids
    (TDS), and temperature of the water samples were determined at the identified
    selected sites using a portable multimeter probe (Eutech, pH tester 10) (ISO 10523:2008).
    The Dissolved Oxygen (DO) content in the samples was analyzed by the Winklers
    method (ISO 5813:1983). The nutrient concentrations viz., Nitrite–N (NO2−), Nitrate–N
    (NO3−), Phosphate (PO4−3) (ISO 6878:2004), Silicates (SiO3−4), Ammonia–N (NH4+)
    (ISO 7150:1984), and Sulphate (SO4−2) in the samples were estimated using a UV–Visible
    spectrophotometer (Analytik Jena Specord 200 Plus) by following the standard procedures
    (Grasshoff et al. 2009). The concentration of Na+ in the samples was estimated
    using a flame emission spectrophotometer (Lasany LI-1384). Total Alkalinity (TA)
    was also titrimetrically analyzed using phenolphthalein and methyl orange as indicators.
    Estimations were performed in triplicates, and the average values have been reported.
    The sample analysis was performed in the trace inorganic laboratory at the Chemical
    Oceanography Department of Cochin University of Science and Technology. To ensure
    the quality, the pH meter was calibrated with different buffer solutions (viz.
    buffers of pH 4.0, 7.0, and 9.1). The values were recorded in triplicates. The
    collection of DO samples was performed without any external influences and fixed
    at the site. The titrations were also repeated thrice to obtain consecutive concordant
    values. The UV–Vis spectrophotometers were calibrated with reagent blanks and
    standard solutions to get a calibration curve with a coefficient of determination
    of 0.99. The standards and solvents were made using pure chemicals and analytical
    grades, respectively and dilutions were performed in ultra-pure water. All the
    glass wares used in the study were acid-washed and rinsed with ultra-pure water.
    Heavy metal analysis The heavy metal concentration (Cu, Cd, Zn, Pb, Fe, Ni, Mn,
    Co, and Cr) were analyzed in triplicates by extracting metals using an organic
    solvent and back-extracting after the decomposition of metal carbamates. The heavy
    metals left over in the water samples were concentrated and measured (APHA 2005).
    Standard operating procedures were followed for ICP-OES (Thermo Scientific, iCAP
    7000 series) and was calibrated with ICP multi-element standards solution IV (Sigma
    Aldrich) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations and operated at maximum
    sensitivity (ISO 11885:2007). Reagent blank determinations were used to correct
    the instrument readings, the extraction was verified by spiking a known internal
    standard (n = 3) and recovery ranged between 85 and 102%. The FAO standards for
    irrigation (Ayers and Westcot 1985) and USEPA standards for aquatic life (USEPA
    1985) were used to compare the results. The spatial distribution of heavy metals
    was plotted using ArcMap 10.4 (Esri ArcGIS Resources). Heavy Metal Pollution Index
    (HMPI) Determining various pollution indices is one of the methods to evaluate
    the environmental contamination in surface water, soil, and sediments. In this
    regard, the HMPI is used to evaluate the total effect of different metals on surface-water
    quality. The HMPI is a rating technique that provides the composite influence
    of individual heavy metals on the overall quality of water. The HMPI method was
    calculated by assigning a rating or weightage (Wi) for each chosen parameter and
    selecting the pollution parameter based on the index. The rating is an arbitrary
    value between zero and one, and its selection reflects the relative importance
    of individual quality considerations. In this attempt, the concentration limit
    (i.e., the highest permissible value for water, Si) is taken from USEPA and FAO
    international standards. The uppermost permissive value for water (Si) refers
    to the Maximum allowable concentration in it. The HMPI is determined using the
    equation (Hasan et al. 2020): $${\\text{HMPI}}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=0}^{n}WiQi}{\\sum_{i=0}^{n}Wi}$$
    (1) where Wi is the unit weight of the ith HM, Qi is the sub-index for the ith
    HM, and n is the number of metals. The sub index (Qi) of the parameter is calculated
    by $$Qi=\\frac{\\sum \\left\\{Mi\\left(-\\right)Ii\\right\\}}{Si-Ii}$$ (2) where
    Mi is the monitored value of the heavy metal of ith parameter, Ii is the ideal
    value (maximum desirable value) of the ith parameter and Si is the standard value
    (highest permissive value) of the ith parameter. The sign (−) indicates numerical
    difference of the two values, ignoring the algebraic sign. In this study, standard
    criteria used were: FAO standards for irrigation (Ayers and Westcot 1985) and
    USEPA limits for aquatic life (USEPA 1985). A HMPI value of 100 was set as a threshold
    to denote the critical level. Heavy Metal Evaluation Index (HMEI) Similar to HMPI,
    HMEI gives an overall quality of the water in terms of heavy metals and is computed
    by the equation (Edet and Offiong 2002): $${\\text{HEI}}=\\sum_{i=0}^{n}\\frac{Hc}{H{\\text{mac}}}$$
    (3) where, Hc and Hmac are the monitored value of a particular metal and the Maximum
    Admissible Concentration (MAC) of the same metal, respectively. Classifications
    of surface WQ based upon HMEI were set with a threshold value of 1.0, which means:
    < 1.0 for fit and > 1.0 is unfit for domestic usage (Singh et al. 2017b). Degree
    of contamination (C d) The contamination factor summarizes the effects of several
    quality parameters of surface waters considered harmful and is calculated as follows
    (Backman et al. 1998): $$C_{\\text{d}}=\\sum_{i=0}^{n}1-nCf_{\\text{I}}$$ (4)
    where \\(Cfi = (Coi / Cni) - 1.\\) The Cfi is the contamination factor of ith
    component, Coi is the observed concentration of the ith component, Cni is the
    MAC concentration of the ith component. Cd values are generally classified into
    three categories: low (Cd < 1), medium (Cd = 1–3), and high (Cd > 3) depending
    on contamination level. Statistical analysis Understanding the relationship between
    the water quality parameters and the source of contamination was statistically
    determined using the SPSS version 24. Pearson’s correlation analysis was performed
    to elucidate the linear relationship between the heavy metals and the physicochemical
    characteristics. The principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to delineate
    the source of heavy metals in the study locale. Results and discussion Hydrochemical
    and heavy metal analysis The monsoon water exhibited a peculiar character showing
    the enriched and accumulated state in the saucer-shaped Kol wetlands. The resultant
    summary of variations in the physicochemical parameters during the two consecutive
    monsoon seasons is given in Table 2. A dignified spatio-temporal variation was
    recorded in each zone (North, Central, and South) of the accounted sites of the
    Kol. The water table in the Kol wetlands during MON1 was higher than the MON2
    due to the heavier precipitation received during MON1. Temperature is an important
    parameter for aquatic ecosystems and a slight variation affects the physical and
    ecological properties (Read et al. 2019). The surface water temperature averaged
    28 ± 2 °C, showing a slight increase in 2019 (MON2) than in 2018 (MON1) and ascribed
    to the low water height (1.5 m ± 0.5) during MON2 as compared to the MON1 period.
    pH levels were observed as 6.74 ± 0.704 and 6.23 ± 0.169 in MON1 and MON2, respectively.
    pH determines the corrosive nature of the wetland waters and the photosynthetic
    processes (Dixit et al. 2021). A decrease in pH was noted from 2018 to 2019 in
    southern Kol, possibly due to the mineral acid produced by the oxidation and hydrolysis
    of total sulfur compounds (24.49–57.7 mg/L) coming from an accelerated microbial
    reduction in the waterlogged soils (Lamers et al. 1998; Saalidong et al. 2022).
    The acidic to neutral pH in Kol wetlands was also reported earlier by Vineetha
    et al. (2015). The average EC ranged from 94 to 349 µS/cm in 2018 and 101–234
    µS/cm in 2019. In comparison, the north zone depicted a maximum EC and TDS in
    the sites N3 (373 µS/cm, 256 mg/L) and N4 (349 µS/cm, 248 mg/L) in 2019 than the
    rest of the Kol sites. The EC was within the permissible limits (3000 μS/cm) prescribed
    by FAO for irrigation water. The northern sites are commercialized as a part of
    urbanization and are greatly affected by human intervention. Besides, it also
    has fewer open channels for the free flow of water and has a landlocked nature,
    which increases the persisting tendency of these ions. Kol Floodplains with nutrient-rich
    sediments showed elevated EC in surface water due to salt ions previously enriched
    in the sediment entering the solution phase during precipitation (Nisari and Sujatha
    2021). A lower DO was observed at Kol wetlands (0.2–6.6 mg/L in 2018 and 1.12–5.8
    mg/L in 2019) except at the central Kol. The lower DO could be attributed to factors
    such as the decomposition of organic matter and excessive algae growth (Cui et
    al. 2021). The central Kol recorded a maximum DO (6.6 and 5.79 mg/L at C2) in
    both sampling periods than the other north and south counterparts. Table 2 The
    average concentration of physicochemical characteristics of waters samples collected
    from Kol wetland ecosystem Full size table The nutrient concentration was found
    to be quite distinct in each zone and higher in 2019 than in 2018. As compared
    with the NO2− (0–0.89, 0.17–7.00 mmol/L) and PO4−3 (0–4.16, 0–4.99 mmol/L) concentrations
    in Ashtamudi and Vembanad surface waters reported by Sujatha et al. (2009), the
    average PO4−3 (4.5 mg/L) and NO2− (0.79 mg/L) contents were abundantly available
    in the Kol wetlands during MON2. The addition of domestic and poultry waste from
    the surrounding residential area and the usage of nitrogen-based fertilizers causes
    high nitrogen contents (Ullah et al. 2021) in the Kol lands. The natural sources
    of SO4−2 are the oxidation of sulfite ores or through anthropogenic additions
    from domestic activities, fertilizers in paddy fields (Jehan et al. 2019; Noor
    et al. 2022). The observed average range in the study area were 16–88 and 14–109
    mg/L in MON1 and MON2, respectively. PO4−3 in the Kol wetlands ranged from 0.7–3.8
    mg/L in 2018 and 0.74–9.9 mg/L in 2019. The average concentration was slightly
    higher than the acceptable limit by FAO standards for irrigation (2 mg/L) at all
    the sampling sites except C3 in the MON2. The maximum concentration of PO4−3 was
    observed at C1, followed by station N4 (5.61 mg/L). PO4−3 sources from the weathering
    of phosphorous-bearing rocks and decomposed organic matter (Dixit et al. 2021).
    PO4−3 fertilizers are one of the common anthropogenic sources. A higher concentration
    of SiO3−4 was recorded in MON2 (0.81–61 mg/L) than in MON1. In both seasons, C4
    (Manakody) which is an intensive paddy cultivation area, retained the maximum
    concentration of SiO3−4 and N1, aquaculture area contained the lowest concentration.
    This could be attributed to wastewater inputs, weatherable road material runoff
    and detergents with metasilicates (Dixit et al. 2021). The Na+ concentrations
    were observed to be within 8.2–17.8 mg/L in MON1 and 6–18 mg/L in MON2 well below
    the threshold value of 200 mg/L suggesting the natural origin in all the sampling
    points (Dixit et al. 2021). The average concentrations of nine heavy metals Zn,
    Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Cr, Cd, Co, and Pb in the Kol area were: 0.31–618 µg/L, BDL-212
    µg/L, 30.17–4418.5 µg/L, 1.2–506 µg/L, BDL-61.96 µg/L, BDL-61.96 µg/L, BDL-46.19
    µg/L, BDL-4.03 µg/L, and BDL-103 µg/L, respectively. The mean concentration during
    MON1 and MON2 followed an increasing order as Fe > Mn > Zn > Cu > Pb > Ni > Cr > Co > Cd;
    Fe > Mn > Zn > Cu > Pb > Ni > Cd > Cr > Co, respectively. On comparing both the
    patterns, a variation was noticed in the concentration of Cd, which during 2019
    increased than the concentrations of Cr and Co. The studied metal concentrations
    were below the prescribed desirable limits by the FAO and USEPA except for the
    concentration of Cd and Zn during MON2. Except stations N1, N2, C3, S1, and S3,
    all other stations exhibited Cd concentrations above the FAO desirable limits
    (10 µg/L) for irrigation and the USEPA criteria (1.8 µg/L) for aquatic life. The
    mean concentration of Zn at the C2 (220.7 µg/L), C3 (618 µg/L), S4 (193.01 µg/L)
    sites was higher than the prescribed USEPA limits (120 µg/L) for aquatic life.
    The Pb concentrations exceeded the USEPA limits (82 µg/L) for aquatic life at
    the C3 (103 µg/L) station. The spatial and temporal distributions of heavy metals
    for MON1 and MON2 are illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. Fig. 2 The spatial
    distribution of heavy metals Cu, Cd, Zn, Pb, Fe, Ni, Mn, Co and Cr in the Kol
    surface waters during MON1 (2018). All concentration values have the same unit
    of μg/L Full size image Fig. 3 The spatial distribution profile of heavy metals
    Cu, Cd, Zn, Pb, Fe, Ni, Mn, Co and Cr in Kol surface waters during MON2 (2019).
    All concentration values have the same unit of μg/L Full size image The concentrations
    of Cu, Zn, and Mn identically decreased at N1 and N2, whereas they increased at
    N3 and N4 sites. The similar pattern of variation in the same zones agrees with
    the overall connection of Kol zones. Małecki et al. (2017) studied Zn and Cu’s
    interactions and transport properties and stated that these could be used as indicators
    of freshwater pollution. The average concentration of Fe (µg/L) in the northern
    region in 2018 varied from 165.9–917.17, and in 2019, it varied from 1458.5 to
    2961.2. The high Fe concentration in the wetland surface water is also reported
    by Hellmann et al. (2022). The higher Fe content in water is an endemic problem
    and also results in the transportation of metals like Cu, Zn, and Mn within the
    system (Singh et al. 2017a). The maximum concentration of Cu in Kol surface waters
    was also similar to that reported in the old Brahmaputra in Bangladesh (200 µg/L),
    which is also used for irrigation purposes (Bhuyan et al. 2019). The central zone
    (C1–C4) was characterized by higher average mean concentrations of Zn, Pb, Cr,
    Fe, Co, Cd, and Mn compared to the other two zones. Among these, the average Pb
    concentration was recorded as maximum (33.6 µg/L) and is often intended from the
    frequent use of fertilizers (Kumar et al. 2022). The Cu and Pb also were found
    maximum in the C3 site, located nearby a residential site and directly prone to
    domestic interferences than the other central sites. Higher phosphate content
    and livestock manures usage in the central sites during MON2 enhances the chances
    of Pb accumulation in the MON2. The insoluble salts in the sediments, such as
    PbSO4, and Pb3(PO4)2 undergo hydrolysis to form soluble forms of Pb(OH)+, which
    also causes the presence of Pb in the water (Zhang et al. 2016). Higher concentration
    of Cd (46.19 µg/L) was found in the S4 station of the south zone of the Kol during
    MON2, which indicates the indirect effect of water fluctuations in the riverine
    area. Compared with FAO and USEPA standards, the mean concentration of Cd was
    found to exceed the desirable limits at southern and central Kol during MON2.
    Cd with a high bioconcentration factor can easily affect the physicochemical properties
    of the site and the ecosystem (Zhang et al. 2018). The sewage effluents from small-scale
    industries and usage of herbicides, fertilizers, and other agrochemicals could
    be the important factors of Cd (Chen et al. 2018; Ullah et al. 2021; Khan et al.
    2022; Rashid et al. 2022). Phosphate fertilizers used in agricultural activities
    also contain considerable amounts of Cd (12.45 mg/kg) (Salman et al. 2019). The
    mean Zn concentration in the central (252.87 µg/L) and southern Kol (229.54 µg/L)
    during MON2 was higher than the limits prescribed by USEPA (120 µg/L), signifying
    a threat to the aquatic biota. The elevated concentrations of Cd, Zn, and Pb in
    the wetlands suggest increased contributions from unconventional geochemical sources
    such as floods, surface runoff, and climatic variations, as well as human-induced
    inputs like agrochemicals originating from the surrounding catchment. A comparison
    of heavy metals with different surface waters of wetlands is provided in Table
    3. The spatial and temporal studies on the Sutlej River in India (Setia et al.
    2021) exhibited high concentrations of several heavy metals, including Zn (up
    to 300 µg/L), Cu (up to 30 µg/L), and Pb (up to 130 µg/L). These metal concentrations
    were particularly prominent in the transboundary areas of the river. However,
    it is worth noting that the concentrations of these metals in the Sutlej River
    were generally lower than those observed in the Kol wetland, with the exceptions
    being Pb and Co, which exhibited higher levels in the Sutlej River. Another important
    irrigation water source in Bangladesh, Old Brahmaputra River, also had a comparatively
    higher concentration of Pb (10–210 µg/L) in contrast to the Kol wetland, where
    Pb concentrations ranged from below detection limits (BDL) to 103 µg/L. Similarly,
    the Bhindawas wetland in India reported Pb concentrations ranging between 210
    and 350 µg/L (Shan et al. 2021). Nevertheless, the concentrations of the remaining
    metals studied were generally more significant in the Kol wetland water compared
    to these reference locations. The Caohai Wetlands in China showed differences
    in the distribution of heavy metals and Cd concentration were recorded to be the
    maximum among other metals (Hu et al. 2020). Kol wetlands in the present study
    showed a very high Cd concentration. However, the Riparian wetlands near the Yellow
    River recorded even higher Cd concentrations, reaching a maximum of 140 µg/L (Hong
    et al. 2020). Compared to other international wetlands, the Kol wetlands in this
    study generally exhibited higher concentrations of the studied metals. This trend
    is consistent with observations made in Three Gorges Reservoir, China (Zhao et
    al. 2020), and Marrecas River, Brazil (Hellmann et al. 2022). Table 3 Heavy metal
    content (µg/L) in the surface waters of different wetlands along with corresponding
    FAO and USEPA standard limits Full size table Pollution indices (HMPI, HMEI and
    C d) The HMPI was calculated to evaluate the appropriateness of wetland water
    for irrigation and its potential toxicity toward aquatic life. It provides the
    potential risk of heavy metals in the water and evaluates the quality. The calculations
    were performed using the FAO irrigation water guidelines and USEPA standards for
    aquatic life safety. The HMPI based on FAO guidelines for irrigation water ranged
    from 121 to 150 in MON1 with a maximum at S1 and in MON2 samples ranged between
    108 and 1661 with a maximum value at S4 station. Under FAO standards, the HMPI
    varied from 121 to 150 during MON1, with the highest value observed at S1. In
    MON2, values ranged from 108 to 1661, with the highest at S4. All samples from
    both seasons had HMPI values exceeding 100 according to FAO standards. Applying
    USEPA criteria, MON1 HMPI ranged from 41 to 143, peaking at S2. In MON2, S4 exhibited
    the highest HMPI (3467), while C3 showed the lowest (13.3). Approximately 75%
    of samples in both seasons posed a threat to aquatic life. Figure 4a–d illustrate
    HMPI variations based on FAO and USEPA standards in MON1 and MON2. The FAO based
    computed HMEI ranged from 0.007–0.07 in MON1 and 0.11–0.29 in MON2 deeming all
    the water samples fit for irrigation purposes (Fig. 5a, b). Whereas in the case
    of USEPA, during MON1, the range of HMEI was within 0.19–2.14 with a maximum at
    the S3 station showing a threat to the aquatic life (Fig. 5c, d). In 2019, 83%
    of the samples (0.13–13.74) showed a possible threat to the aquatic life in the
    Kol wetland system. The Cd computed using FAO standards at Kol samples can be
    categorized as low during both the monsoonal sampling periods. In contrast, as
    per USEPA standards, the S3 station (2.34) showed Cd < 1 value categorizing the
    waters as medium contamination during MON2 (Fig. 5e). Fig. 4 HMPI values calculated
    using FAO standards for irrigation water in a 2018; b 2019 and USEPA criteria

    (Cd) using USEPA standards Full size image On evaluating the irrigation suitability,
    the HMPI values showed > 100 range for all the samples in both seasons. Contrastingly
    HMEI and Cd suggested no contamination and thus categorized the waters suitable
    for irrigation. When assessing pollution and risk to aquatic life, HMPI values
    were highest for S2 (MON1) and S4 (MON2). However, the S3 station was highlighted
    as a potential threat to the aquatic life and categorized as medium contamination
    within the ecosystem. Pearson’s correlation analysis The result of the multivariate
    analysis using Pearson coefficient correlation in MON1 and MON2 is reported in
    Tables 4 and 5, respectively. The conductivity of the water samples had a significant
    positive correlation (p < 0.01) with TDS in both seasons. In MON1, conductivity
    showed a highly significant correlation (p < 0.01) with ammonia (r2 = 0.60) and
    phosphate (r2 = 0.60), inferring that there was a covariance between them. TDS
    was moderately correlated with phosphate (0.61, p < 0.05). NO3− was positively
    correlated with Cd, Zn, Ni, Co, and Cr. Zhang et al. (2019) also explained that
    a strong relationship exists between the physicochemical characteristics and the
    metal ions bioavailability in the water regime. The higher concentration of NO3−
    and PO4−3 in water and positive correlation with EC and TDS indicate their similar
    sources, such as agriculture and domestic activities (Jehan et al. 2019). A strong
    positive correlation between the metal concentrations of Cd, Zn, and Ni with the
    other metals in the first monsoon indicates a similar point of sources and mutual
    dependence and similar origin. Meanwhile, in MON2, a negative correlation of Zn,
    Pb, and Mn with NO2−, PO4−3, and NH4+ indicates the independent transport chances
    of metals through surface runoff. Zn and Pb remarkably correlated with Co and
    Cu, depicting their common origin and similar transport behavior (Li et al. 2015).
    PO4−3 in the MON2 season were correlated with Fe and Cr and negatively correlated
    with Pb, indicating a different origin of Pb other than the agrochemical sources.
    Therefore, the usage of agricultural fertilizers and herbicides at the site led
    to the concentrations of specific heavy metals (Cd and Zn) in this area being
    higher than the desirable limits set by FAO for irrigation waters. Furthermore,
    the accelerated economic growth in the area over recent years has contributed
    to heightened concentrations of Cd and Zn in the Kol wetlands, attributed to increased
    industrial and mining operations, as well as transportation activities. Table
    4 Correlation analysis of physicochemical parameters and heavy metals during MON1
    (2018) Full size table Table 5 Correlation analysis of physicochemical parameters
    and heavy metals during MON2 (2019) Full size table Factor analysis PCA was applied
    to identify the factors that govern the distributions of the heavy metals in the
    study area (Fig. 6). The generation of the correlation matrix, extraction of factors,
    and Varimax Kaiser rotation of the factors was performed for the normalized data
    by applying a logarithmic transformation (log X + 1). We retrieved three PCA components
    for both MON1 and MON2 periods. The three components of MON1 explained 57.71%
    of the overall variance, of which the PC1 contributed 23.15% variance with strong
    positive metal loading for Cd, Fe, Ni, Zn, and Co and negative loads on Pb (Fig.
    6). The first principal component of MON1 can be considered as the co-precipitation
    of Fe hydroxide with the scavenging of other metals in the water. Savenko et al.
    (2020) also reported similar co-precipitation of Cu, and Cd with Fe hydroxides
    in submarine hydrothermal plumes. Wakida et al. (2008) reported that Cd and Co
    in water could be attributed to the surface runoff bound with the colloidal materials.
    PC2 (variance = 19.03%) showed significant factors in Cu, EC, and TDS. The results
    pointed out that domestic sewage and modern agropractices could be the primary
    pollution source of surface water. The impact of wastes discharged from small-scale
    industries on the levels of heavy metals in surface water cannot be ignored (Meng
    et al. 2022). PC3 included Cr, NO3− and NH4+ with a variance of 15.53%. The third
    component showed that the inputs of Cr are due to agrarian activities such as
    the excess use of pesticides and fertilizers (Ali et al. 2019). Whereas in the
    case of MON2, the three factors explained 73.30% of the total variance. PC1 accounted
    for 29.96% of the variance with positive loading of Cd, Fe, Ni, Cr, PO4−3, and
    SiO3−4, implying human activities mainly through phosphate fertilizers, pesticides,
    herbicides, and wastewater irrigation (Chen et al. 2018). The second component
    variance with 29.44% positive loading on Cu, Zn, Pb, Mn, and SO4−2 and negatively
    loaded with NO2− and NH4+ indicated the significant contribution from siltation
    processes along sulfur complexes and mixed contribution from anthropogenic sources
    (Rashid et al. 2020). The PC3 component is positively loaded with EC and TDS,
    indicating their strong interrelation between the water quality parameters and
    independent from the metal interlinks (Rashid et al. 2021). Fig. 6 Three-dimensional
    principal component loading showing the grouping of various water quality parameters
    recorded a 2018 and b 2019 Full size image This study conducted a spatial analysis
    of heavy metal distribution in Kol wetland water, revealing elevated levels of
    Cd, Zn, and Pb. These findings raise concerns about the potential harm to aquatic
    life, particularly in an aquaculture-rich environment, although the water remains
    suitable for irrigation purposes. It is important to note that these metals possess
    toxic and bioaccumulative properties. Pollution of water bodies with heavy metals
    can harm aquatic ecosystems, disrupt food chains, and negatively impact agricultural
    output, with consequent implications for human health. The extent of metal contamination
    exhibited a Central > South > North pattern, with the central Kol region heavily
    engaged in agricultural activities, displaying the highest metal accumulation.
    The need to regulate agrarian practices and other anthropogenic influences in
    the Kol wetlands to protect this fragile ecosystem is evident. Furthermore, the
    southern station, S3, indicated a moderate level of contamination, posing a potential
    threat to the aquatic organisms inhabiting the ecosystem. The observed correlations
    and source identifications suggest that the aggregation of anthropogenic metals,
    such as Cd, Zn, and Pb, increases the likelihood of metal accumulation in Kol
    waters, which, given its proximity to coastal areas, could impact marine ecosystems.
    Conclusion This study underscores the critical role of surface water quality in
    coastal agro-wetland ecosystems. Comparing MON2 to MON1, Kol’s surface water exhibited
    significantly higher concentrations of heavy metals. The research unveiled notable
    levels of Cd, Zn, and Pb, surpassing USEPA’s acute criteria for aquatic life,
    signifying a potential hazard to aquatic organisms. Assessment of irrigation suitability
    based on HMEI and Cd criteria indicated no contamination, thus categorizing the
    water as suitable for irrigation. There is a pressing need for ongoing monitoring
    of surface waters in agrarian wetlands and check on fertilizer applications to
    address these concerns effectively. Data availability Data will be made available

  limitations: This study only provides a snapshot of the heavy metal contamination
    in the Kol wetlands during two consecutive monsoon periods. The results may not
    be representative of the entire year, and the concentrations of heavy metals may
    vary depending on the season and other factors. In addition, the study does not
    investigate the sources of heavy metal contamination in detail or the potential
    health risks associated with exposure to heavy metals in the wetlands.

- analysis: 'The developed ADMIN indicator has demonstrated its capability in providing
    reliable estimates of drought conditions correctly identifying the wet and dry
    years. The methodology has been applied in two cases studies: the Chiese and Capitanata
    Irrigation Consortia in Italy, over 20 years of analysis for the period from 2000
    to 2019. The robustness of the developed drought index has been evaluated by assessing
    the effect of drought events on the effectively used irrigation volumes and yearly
    crop yields at Irrigation Consortium Scale, in Southern and Northern Italy. The
    obtained results are in general agreement with respect to the benchmark ADMIN,
    being the high-resolution series able to accurately reproduce the low-resolution
    behavior, even if for a shorter time period of analysis. In the Capitanata area,
    the driest years are identified as 2003, 2011, 2012 and 2017, while the wettest
    years are 2010 and 2014. Similarly for the Chiese Consortium, 2010 and 2014 are
    identified as very wet years, while very dry years are 2003, 2007, 2017 and 2019.
    ADMIN is in general agreement with EDO estimates, except for the years 2017 and
    2010 in which no vegetation drought is detected by EDO and for the year 2010 in
    which EDO is not reporting soil moisture positive anomalies. In the Capitanata
    Consortium, a negative correlation is obtained between the yearly cumulative drought
    index values and irrigation volumes, where an increase in the drought index means
    an increase of dryness condition, meaning that more irrigation is required; conversely
    in the Chiese Consortium a zero correlation is obtained with an almost constant
    amount of irrigation volumes provided to the crops every year independently from
    the drought condition.'

    yield 1. Introduction Drought is an intensifying hazard with a complex behavior
    affecting both the natural and anthropogenic environments as well as the socio-economic
    activities (Sheffield et al., 2009, Van Loon et al., 2014, Mann and Gleick, 2015,
    Wood et al., 2015, Douville et al., 2021, Seneviratne et al., 2021). According
    to the Munich Re report (Munich Re, 2021), between 2000 and 2019, the 35% of hazard
    events are related to droughts affecting more than 1.43 billion people: as the
    drought of 2003 in central Europe (García-Herrera et al., 2010) or of 2010 in
    Russia (Spinoni et al., 2018), the 2013–2014 California drought (Swain et al.,
    2014), the Chinese event of 2014 (Wang and He, 2015), the southern Africa drought
    of 2015–2017 (Meza et al., 2021), and the Australian 2000 event (van Dijk et al.,
    2013). In particular, strong negative impacts have been reported on the agricultural
    sector, with different effects depending on the crops being rainfed or irrigated,
    mainly due to water shortages with reductions of crop productions and consequently
    economic losses (De Stefano et al., 2015, Ding et al., 2011). These drought events
    are further projected to increase due to climate change and also increased land-atmosphere
    feedbacks due to changed land/vegetation coverage and also irrigated areas (Miralles
    et al., 2019). Thus, irrigated agriculture, which is by far the largest water
    user with about 70% of total freshwater consumption (Alexandratos and Bruinsma,
    2012), will be more and more impacted, even though irrigated areas cover only
    about 2% of the global land area (FAO, 2016). Therefore, an improvement in the
    understanding of the spatial and temporal variability of droughts is required
    to meet the increasing effects of droughts (AghaKouchak et al., 2015). Drought
    is generally defined as a temporal anomaly in comparison with average conditions
    over long time periods (Wood et al., 2015). Wilhite and Glantz (1985) identified
    four different types of droughts based on their impacts: i) meteorological as
    a precipitation deficiency, ii) agricultural as soil water availability shortage,
    iii) hydrological for low runoff and groundwater deficiency, iv) socioeconomic
    on the society. Each type of drought might evolve with different timing, intensity,
    duration and spatial extent (Vicente-Serrano, 2006). To describe this complex
    phenomenon, a huge number of drought indices has been developed over the years,
    designed for different applications. However, no single drought index has been
    identified to describe the multifaceted nature of drought (Wanders et al., 2017).
    Therefore, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and Global Water Partnership
    (GWP) (2016) suggest to use multiple drought indices. Among them, the Standardized
    Precipitation Index (SPI) is defined by the WMO as the standard index for analysing
    a meteorological drought (World Meteorological Organization, 2012), by fitting
    the precipitation data to a standardized normal probability distribution function,
    over different time scales from 1 to 36 months (McKee et al., 1993). SPI advantages
    are mainly that it relies only on precipitation and its relatively simple computation
    (Kumar et al., 2016), while the key limitation is relative to the high sensitivity
    to the quality and time length of data used, and moreover it does not account
    for the atmospheric water demand. The Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration
    Index (SPEI) (Vicente-Serrano et al., 2010) and the Palmer Drought Severity Index
    (PDSI) (Sheffield et al., 2012) overcome this limitation by considering the evapotranspiration
    besides precipitation, in order to account for the role of evaporative demand
    on drought severity. An alternative approach is to monitor soil moisture (SM)
    changes over large areas using satellite-based SM products (Sadri et al., 2018),
    based on microwave sampling techniques with active (Sentinel-1, ASCAT) or passive
    (SMOS, SMAP, AMSR-E) technologies (Kerr et al., 2010, Bauer-Marschallinger et
    al., 2018). However, inconsistencies among the different products have been documented
    with correlations ranging from 0.48 to 0.89 among them and ground data (Cui et
    al., 2017, El Hajj et al., 2018, Paciolla et al., 2020). This might be mainly
    due to different sensing techniques, spatial resolutions (from 50 km of SMOS to
    1 km of Sentinel1), the sensing soil depth of few centimetres, which is not congruent
    with the hydrological active soil for plant root zone uptake. Moreover, there
    are problems linked to the saturation of soil moisture retrieval algorithms for
    active radars (Giacomelli, et al., 1995) and their ability to detect soil moisture
    over vegetated surfaces (Bindlish and Barros, 2001). Notwithstanding these issues,
    remotely sensed soil moisture products are widely diffused in the scientific community,
    thanks to the possibility of overcoming the great limitations of retrieving soil
    moisture through ground measurements, from costs to representativeness of point-wise
    measurements over a largely heterogeneous areas (Famiglietti et al., 2008, Crow
    et al., 2012). An extensive review of numerous applications of remote sensing
    SM, despite their possible uncertainties, is provided by Babaeian et al. (2019).
    A less common approach for drought monitoring involves the use of a Land Surface
    Temperature (LST) derived index (Kogan, 1997, Sepulcre-Canto et al., 2012), computed
    using the thermal infrared (TIR) spectra on-board a few numbers of sensors (MODIS,
    LANDSAT, Sentinel-3) (Jiménez-Donaire et al., 2020). On the other hand, the LST
    is widely used in energy or energy-water balance models to compute evapotranspiration
    (Kustas and Norman, 1999, Su, 2002, Corbari and Mancini, 2022), while for longer
    periods analysis is almost unused mainly due to data unavailability during cloud
    conditions and the non-unique relationship between LST and SM (Price, 1980). Several
    satellite vegetation indices might be used to monitor the effect of droughts directly
    on vegetation, as the NDVI index, which however might be limited in its use by
    other external factors (e.g. soil adjacency), or the normalized difference water
    index (NDWI) which accounts for the water leaf contents, or the fraction of absorbed
    photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) (Choudhury, 1987). Moreover, these
    anomalies are sometimes asynchronous with respect to each other, as for example
    soil moisture and vegetation ones (van Hateren et al., 2021), due to the delayed
    response of vegetation to water scarcity. Another discrepancy could be related
    to vegetation anomalies not associated to water availability, which can lead to
    issues in defining agricultural droughts and hence false drought identifications.
    To overcome this inconsistency, it is thus important to detect the different droughts
    on SM and vegetation. Thus, for operative applications for supporting policymakers,
    water managers and stakeholders, a combination of indices is an optimal solution
    to detect the different droughts and their impacts, allowing to account for the
    specificities of different climatic-anthropogenic regions (Hoffmann et al., 2020).
    In the last few years, some operational drought monitoring and early warning systems
    have been developed at continental scales, by assembling a suite of independent
    indices which detect the different type of droughts, to be able to provide water
    shortage trends and deviations from the long-term averages of mainly precipitation,
    streamflow, soil moisture and groundwater (Sheffield et al., 2014, Vogt et al.,
    2018). Among them, the United States Drought Monitor (https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu),
    based on different indices at weekly scale, or the Global Integrated Drought Monitoring
    and Prediction System (GIDMaPS, http://drought.eng.uci.edu, now non-operational),
    or the Combined Drought Indicator (CDI) (Sepulcre-Canto et al., 2012) revised
    by Cammalleri et al., (2021) for considering the consistency of prolonged and
    interrupted drought events, which is used into the European Drought Observatory
    (EDO, https://edo.jrc.ec.europa.eu) for detecting European droughts. The CDI combines
    different indices: (SPI, remotely sensing fAPAR and soil moisture from a hydrological
    model), each based on different temporal scales, allowing to define three drought
    categories: watch with precipitation below normal, warning when the precipitation
    deficit is propagated in soil moisture deficit, alert when it also affects the
    vegetation. Such complex, multi-dataset drought monitoring systems are already
    employed in other regions of the planet (Leeper et al., 2022): Luan et al. (2015)
    designed a drought monitoring/forecasting approach coupled with an irrigation
    management system, encouraging its application in northern China; Ozelkan et al.
    (2016) focused more on the sensing aspect of drought detection, discussing the
    differences between rainfed and irrigated cropland when using satellites to monitor
    droughts over a semi-arid agricultural area (south-eastern Anatolia, Turkey);
    finally, Wu et al. (2015) applied MODIS data over the US corn belt (midwestern
    US, from Nebraska to Ohio) to select the best index that could capture the local
    agricultural drought of 2012, identifying the normalized difference infrared index
    as a powerful and promising tool to monitor drought conditions over irrigated
    land. The optimal solution to validate these drought monitoring systems, indexes
    and indicators is to relate their findings to drought impacts. In this framework,
    this work is answering to the question if it is possible to develop an EO-based
    agricultural drought monitoring indicator (ADMIN) for operative irrigation networks
    management. The monitoring indicator has been developed following the principle
    of the temporal evolution of the drought process, by firstly considering the meteorological
    and agricultural droughts, vegetation water stress and drying. Different drought
    severity levels are then assigned based on the combination of the different droughts’
    indices, starting from “no drought” up to “extreme drought”. This drought monitoring
    indicator is developed identifying the relationships between the causes (lack
    of precipitation, high temperatures and radiations) and effects (soil moisture
    shortage, vegetation water stress and vegetation drying). Such links provide an
    indicator for water stress and crop failure monitoring for activating crops protection
    actions, as irrigation. The robustness of the developed ADMIN will be evaluated
    by assessing the effect of a drought event on irrigation volumes and crop yields
    at Irrigation Consortium Scale, as water availability is indirectly affected by
    all the effects of a drought event. The methodology is applied in two Italian
    cases studies: the Chiese and Capitanata Irrigation Consortia, which are located
    in the North and South of Italy, respectively. These areas mainly differ for climatic
    conditions, crops types, strategies and techniques of irrigation. The analyses
    are performed over 20 years for the period from 2000 to 2019. The main innovations
    rely on: i) the analyses of ADMIN which is usable for operative water management
    from regional to farm scale; ii) the direct comparison of the drought monitoring
    indicator on the effective used irrigation volumes and the crop yields at Irrigation
    Consortium Scale over different years to determine its robustness, iii) a method
    which is fully based on remote sensing data, differing on sensing techniques,
    spatial and temporal resolutions, to detect the full drought process development;
    iv) capability of following the temporal evolution of the drought process, considering
    a specific variable for each process: rainfall anomaly for detecting the meteorological
    drought, soil moisture anomaly for the agricultural drought, LST anomaly to detect
    the vegetation water stress and vegetation indices for plant drying. 2. Materials
    and methods 2.1. The agricultural drought monitoring indicator: admin Following
    the principle of the temporal evolution of the drought process (Wilhite and Glantz,
    1985), the meteorological drought occurs first (a period with less rainfall than
    average, according to the SPI index), and it generally precedes the agricultural
    drought, when crop production may be reduced due to soil moisture shortage. This
    shortage can further increase the drought severity, leading to an increase of
    crop surface temperature (observed by vegetation water stress indices) and finally
    to vegetation drying. Drought-related aspects often have an embedded uncertainty
    especially related to the definition and detection of drought indicators as well
    as in the impact assessment and reporting. The fuzzy theory, introduced by Zadeh
    (1978), could be a way in handling these uncertainties by allocating fuzzy values
    when objective metrics struggle to adequately measure their magnitude (Huang et
    al., 2015, Shyrokaya et al., 2024). Thus, the ADMIN indicator is based on fuzzy
    categories for the drought level. ADMIN is divided into 4 levels, representative
    of each drought step and assigned considering the anomaly of each variable, starting
    from no-drought condition, till extreme drought. Each level is further characterized
    depending on the severity of the event, adopting the −1 threshold identified by
    Komuscu (1999) and McKee et al. (1995) to distinguish milder (>-1) and stronger
    (<-1) drought sub-levels. This classification aligns with similar categorizations
    of drought severity outlined by WMO (2016) or EDO (2020). The four steps are:
    1) precipitation deficit is assessed using the standardized precipitation index
    (SPI-1, 1-month accumulation period) index: if positive values are registered,
    no drought is recorded (ADMIN takes a null value). On the other hand, if negative
    values are registered, a mild drought is recorded and depending on the value of
    SPI-1, ADMIN can take on a milder (-0.5) or stronger (-1) value; 2) soil moisture
    shortage is evaluated via the soil moisture anomaly (SMA): for negative values,
    a moderate drought is defined, with ADMIN taking on the values of −1.5 or −2,
    depending on the magnitude of SMA; 3) vegetation drying is identified with a positive
    land surface temperature anomaly (LSTA), indicating a severe drought, with ADMIN
    values of −2.5 or −3 based on the value of LSTA (only for this anomaly indicator,
    LSTA<+1 is associated with milder conditions and LSTA>+1 with stronger conditions,
    as higher surface temperatures are associated with harsher drought conditions);
    4) vegetation stress is estimated by the vegetation indices anomaly (VISA), labelling
    the event an extreme drought, which could be represented by ADMIN values of −3.5
    or −4, depending on the value of VISA. During the irrigation season (from April
    to October) irrigation is added to precipitation. The steps described above for
    the drought indicator computation are shown graphically in Fig. 1. Download :

    values of the ADMIN drought indicator according to the anomalies’ combinations.
    SPI-1 identifies the 1-month Standardized Precipitation Index, SMA the Soil Moisture
    Anomaly, LSTA the Land Surface Temperature Anomaly and VISA the Vegetation Indices
    Anomaly. All the anomalies employed by ADMIN to evaluate drought conditions are
    evaluated as the deviation of a given parameter from its long-term mean value
    (Eq.1). This procedure allows to remove the underlying seasonality signal via
    the formulation: (1) ̅ ̅ where is the variable value at the i-th time step within
    dataset d, ̅ and ̅ are respectively the mean and standard deviation calculated
    along the same dataset d. The anomalies are computed at daily scale, updating
    the variables value whenever the corresponding satellite observations are available
    for soil moisture and land surface temperature, comparing each value against the
    average and standard deviation of the same variable in the same day of the year
    i. The ADMIN indicator is updated daily, so that the time scale evolution is consistent
    with the water management practices of the two considered case studies. Instead
    precipitation anomalies are updated monthly in line with the scientific literature
    (McKee et al., 1993). The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) (McKee et al.,
    1993) represents the probability that a certain location would receive at least
    the observed amount of precipitation over a certain time period. Different aggregation
    times are employed in the literature, from 1 month up to 24 (Shyroaya et al.,
    2024). In this work, 1-month SPI (SPI-1) was chosen, in order to capture immediate
    impacts on the crop (e.g., reduced soil moisture availability). Longer time horizons
    would better identify long-term effects, but in ADMIN these are covered by the
    anomalies of other remotely-sensed variables, which would have resulted in a redundancy
    of information. The SPI is computed fitting the gamma probability distribution
    (Thom, 1958, Abramowitz and Stegun, 1964). 2.2. Case studies and data The methodology
    is applied in two cases studies: the Chiese and Capitanata Irrigation Consortia,
    which are located in the North and South of Italy, respectively (Fig. 2). These
    two areas are highly cultivated, as from the land cover/use map (Fig. 2) and are
    representative of the heterogeneity of Italian agriculture (Chiese and Capitanata),
    as they span different climatic conditions (humid and semi-arid), crops types
    (water-demanding maize and soybean and fresh vegetables-winter wheat), water availability
    and source (lakes and groundwater), irrigation techniques (flood and drip) and
    distribution rules (fixed-scheme and on demand). These differences will help to
    demonstrate the robustness of the implemented methodology. Download : Download

    show the land use/cover maps of the Consortia, highlighting the predominance of
    cultivated areas (ESA WorldCover 2021 map (https://worldcover2021.esa.int)). Both
    areas have experienced drought periods in the past, especially the Capitanata
    one, where due to very high temperatures and water shortages during August 2012,
    the production of tomatoes was affected with a reduction in yield that exceeded
    20–25%. Similarly, during the drought of July 2017, the account of the damages
    exceeded 2 billion of euro (Coldiretti, 2017). The Chiese Irrigation Consortium
    (www.consorziodibonificachiese.it) provides irrigation to an area of about 20’000 ha
    in the Pianura Padana Plain near the Lake Idro covering the province of Brescia
    in the North of Italy. The climate is classified as humid subtropical (Cfa) as
    from the Koppen classification), with winter cold temperatures and hot and humid
    summers. The annual average precipitation is 700 mm, mainly concentrated in autumn,
    with more than 200 rainy days a year. The area is intensively cultivated with
    summer crops as maize and forage, and winter wheat. During summer, crops are sustained
    by high irrigation volumes provided on a prior fixed turn every 7 ½ days from
    April to September. Irrigation is mainly provided using the surface technique,
    and water is withdrawn from a dense channel network diverted from the river Chiese
    downstream the Lake Idro. An average irrigation volume of about 1200 mm is provided
    during the crop season (irrigation volumes are planned in advance by the consortium
    and monitored daily), over a mean precipitation value of 250 mm. In contrast,
    the Capitanata Irrigation Consortium (www.consorzio.fg.it) extends for an area
    of 50’000 ha in the province of Foggia in the Puglia region in the South of Italy.
    The climate is classified as hot-summer Mediterranean (Csa) as from the Koppen
    classification), with hot and dry summers. The annual average precipitation is
    500 mm, mainly concentrated in autumn and winter, with less than 100 rainy days
    a year. The area is characterised by intensive agriculture with summer tomatoes
    (17% of the area), and autumn and winter fresh vegetables (24% of the area), olives
    and vineyards (34%), and winter-spring wheat. Irrigation is provided on demand
    through a metered pressurized network pumping water from two reservoirs, from
    April to October. The fields are averagely watered with a seasonal amount of 600 mm
    plus a rainfall mean of about 150 mm, mainly with drip and micro-sprinklers techniques.
    2.2.1. Data sources The considered dataset encompasses different variables (precipitation,
    soil moisture, land surface temperature and vegetation indices) which could be
    obtained from different sources (remote sensing, ground data and hydrological
    land surface model) at different spatial and temporal resolutions (Table1). A
    benchmark combination of data products for the ADMIN computation is identified
    in order to maximize the length of the dataset, allowing to have a time series
    from 2000 to 2020, to be able to produce a robust statistic based on 20 years
    of data. The benchmark ADMIN was computed considering the ERA5 precipitation data,
    for soil moisture anomaly the ESA-CCI Combined dataset, for the land surface temperature
    and the vegetation anomalies the MODIS data were chosen. Table 1. Spatial dataset

    precipitation Precipitation data are obtained from the ERA5 database provided
    by ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) (Hersbach et al.,
    2020). ERA5 is a reanalysis dataset which provides the description of land water
    and energy cycles over several decades from 1950, combining the high-resolution
    ECMWF land surface model driven by the downscaled meteorological forcing from
    the ERA5 climate reanalysis (Hersbach et al., 2020) with observations from across
    the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset. ERA5 is freely available
    through the Copernicus Climate Change Service (Hersbach et al., 2018). Beck et
    al., (2017) showed that this dataset has the best performances among several other
    reanalysis datasets and satellite data. 2.2.1.2. satellite soil moisture datasets
    Satellite retrieval of soil moisture presents numerous perks (Babaeian et al.,
    2019), but nonetheless displays high variability among the different available
    products. The Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) is a European Space Agency (ESA)
    Earth explorer mission launched in 2009 (Kerr et al., 2010), which provides SSM
    data at 25 km of spatial resolution twice every day. The SMOS Root-Zone soil moisture
    product is provided by Al Bitar et al. (2013). It employs SMOS L3 surface soil
    moisture and other data (e.g., NDVI from MODIS, climate data from ECMWF) to derive
    soil moisture at root level using an exponential filter for the first soil layer
    and a physical model for the second. The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission
    from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) provides surface
    soil moisture products at 36 km from L-band microwave data (Entekhabi et al.,
    2014). The ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) (Gruber et al., 2019) dataset is
    the final product of a wide effort aimed at standardizing and merging a large
    range of different SSM datasets gathered throughout the years into one global
    database. It merges active remote sensing (from AMI-WS, ASCAT-A and ASCAT-B) and
    passive one (SSMR, SSM/I, TMI, AMSR-E, Windsat, SMOS and AMSR2). Finally, the
    ESA-CCI Combined dataset is obtained by scaling both databases to a common product
    (GLDAS Noah) (Dorigo et al., 2017). The Copernicus Surface Soil Moisture 1 km
    Version 1 product (SSM1km) is the result of the Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter observation
    in band C. It provides relatively high 1 km spatial resolution, although its revisit
    times are slightly longer, around 4 days (Bauer-Marschallinger et al., 2018).
    2.2.1.3. satellite land surface temperature Satellite Land Surface Temperature
    (LST) has been retrieved from MODIS low resolution data and from the high-resolution
    LANDSAT series. The used MODIS LST product (http://ladsweb.nascom.nasa.gov/index.html)
    is MODIS/Terra LST/E Daily L3 Global 1-km Grid product (MOD11A1) at a spatial
    resolution of 1 km and a daily temporal resolution (Wan, 2008). Landsat 7 ETM+
    and Landsat 8 satellite data have also been considered (USGS, http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/),
    with LST data provided at a spatial resolution of 30 m and a temporal frequency
    of 16 days. Land surface temperature is computed using the Single Channel surface
    temperature retrieval algorithm, based on the Radiative Transfer Equation which
    can be written in the thermal infrared region as Jimenez-Munoz et al. (2014).
    2.2.1.4. satellite vegetation indices Different vegetation indices (VIs) might
    be retrieved from remote sensing data to describe the evolution of an agricultural
    drought, taking advantage of their characteristics of detecting vegetation changes.
    It is still an open problem in literature which index best represents the crops
    stress and dynamics (Huete et al., 1997). Among them, the Normalized Difference
    Vegetation Index (NDVI) is the most widely used, representing an indication of
    plants greenness and their photosynthetic activity, responding to changes in the
    chlorophyll content and the intracellular spaces in spongy mesophyll of plant
    leaves. NDVI is computed as the normalized difference between the near infrared
    (NIR) and visible red reflectance. Additionally, the Soil Adjusted Vegetation
    Index (SAVI) was also considered as an index able to reduce the soil background
    effect (Huete, 1988); or the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) (Gao, 1996)
    which allows estimating the vegetation water content based on shortwave infrared
    band reflectance increases or decreases. It is sensitive to variations in the
    water content (absorption of SWIR radiation) and spongy mesophyll (reflectance
    of NIR radiation). Finally, the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) is also considered,
    in order to detect the minimization of the canopy-soil variations and its sensitivity
    over dense vegetation. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)
    data used in this study (Table1) are the 8-day composite (the best quality daily
    reflectance data of the 8-day period), 500-meter dataset MOD13A1. The products
    of NDVI, NDWI, EVI and SAVI are directly used. As the vegetation indices are an
    average of 8 days, the index value is kept constant for the time period of 8 days.
    At high spatial resolution, the vegetation indices are computed from Landsat 7
    and 8 satellite images at 30 m spatial resolution. 2.2.2. Crops yield data Crops
    yield estimates are available from the Italian National Statistics Institute (ISTAT,
    https://www.istat.it/it/agricoltura?dati). Total yield and total cultivated areas
    for the main cultivated crops are provided by Province. For the Capitanata area,
    the province of Foggia is selected, as most of its agricultural activity is found
    within the Capitanata Consortium (95% of its area, or 47’000 ha). The Province
    of Brescia is chosen, as it covers almost all of the Chiese Consortium Area. 3.
    Anomalies analysis The anomalies of precipitation, soil moisture, land surface
    temperature and vegetation computed over the Capitanata and Chiese Consortia for
    the years from 2000 to 2020 are reported in Fig. 3 and in Fig. 4, respectively.
    The chosen combination of data products for the ADMIN computation is identified
    in order to maximize the time duration length. Besides the ERA5 precipitation
    data, for soil moisture anomaly the ESA-CCI Combined dataset is selected, for
    the land surface temperature and the vegetation anomalies the MODIS data are chosen.

    daily NDVI anomalies from MODIS for the Chiese Consortium from 2000 to 2020. Precipitation
    SPI-1 calculated from the ERA5 reanalysis dataset show marked periods of drought
    interspersed with periods of higher than average rainfall all along the years,
    without specific differences during the crop season. The Capitanata area is in
    general more subject to spring drought conditions for below than normal rainfall
    than the Chiese area. Important winter droughts are also visible in the last years.
    It is important to note that the SPI1 index is the result of a statistical process
    where precipitation is fitted with a gamma distribution on non-zero values per
    month of the year and then normalized. For dry climates, where zero precipitation
    values are common, such as the case of South Italy, the calculation of SPI might
    be skewed (Wu et al., 2007). Therefore, the application of SPI is critical and
    its interpretation must be done properly. Soil moisture anomalies are calculated
    for each available date based on monthly variations at daily scale considering
    the ESA CCI Combined dataset, as the most complete series from 2000 to 2019 for
    both case studies. A strong signal is found with negative SMA in summer and positive
    SMA values in winter. SMA is also characterized by some severe drought conditions,
    as the spring-summer months of the years 2007–2008 and 2016 in the southern area,
    or the summer periods of the years 2003 and 2019 or the winter of 2011–2012 in
    the northern area. LST series retrieved from MODIS at 1 km of spatial resolution
    are averaged over the analyzed area and used to calculate LST anomaly. Positive
    values of LSTA represent warmer days, where the LST is higher than the mean value
    and water stress is liable to occur, whereas negative values identify the colder-than-average
    days. For the Capitanata Consortium, a higher number of highly-negative anomalies
    are detectable during the summer season. This might be due to the fact that only
    the 40% of the area is cultivated during summer with highly irrigated crops (mainly
    tomatoes) while the remaining part is cultivated with winter rainfed wheat or
    bare soil (Corbari and Mancini, 2022). It is worth to remember that a monthly
    anomaly is computed, so that the trend seasonality is removed with no default
    low values in autumn/winter and high values in spring/summer. Similar results
    are obtained for the Chiese area with no specific seasonal stress periods. However
    contrary to Capitanata, the summer period is usually characterized by several
    days of high positive anomalies. This due to the fact that the Chiese area is
    mainly cultivated with irrigated corn. Vegetation indices anomalies are finally
    considered to detect and monitor the impacts on vegetation growth and productivity
    of environmental stress factors, especially plant water stress due to drought.
    As NDVI from MODIS is provided as an average over 8 days, to compute the daily
    VISA anomaly, the same NDVI value is kept constant for 8 days. VISA shows for
    the Capitanata area strong negative values during the summer months for the years
    2000 and 2001, as well as for the years 2007 and 2008. These findings are consistent
    with the evolution of the drought, which showed also strong negative SMA values.
    On the contrary, for the Chiese area no highly negative anomalies on vegetation
    are observed, except for the summer of 2003 where to negative VISA corresponds
    also negative SMA values. Instead to the negative SMA of the 2019 summer, a positive
    VISA is obtained. It should also be noted that vegetation indices could also catch
    senescence periods shifted in the different years according to the year specific
    climate; such negative anomalies would not then represent drought conditions.
    However, as VISA is considered within ADMIN only in the very last step, after
    considering the anomalies of the other variables, the impact of these misrepresented
    senescence periods on the ADMIN index is expect to be negligible. 3.1. Synchronism
    and correlations among anomalies The synchronism (or its absence) among the different
    variables’ anomalies is further analyzed during the different years to understand
    how a precipitation drought could lead to a soil moisture one, which in turn might
    or not be transferred to temperature and vegetation droughts. The temporal consistency
    between a pair of variables is defined building a contingency table: a positive
    agreement is recorded when both variables report either drought or absence of
    it, whereas a disagreement is assigned when one variable reports drought conditions,
    and the other does not. The differentiation between the two conditions is based
    on the sign of the anomaly, with drought conditions associated with negative anomalies
    (except for LST). Then, the percentage of days of the four possible combinations
    of the contingency tables are computed. Three possible combinations of variables’
    anomalies are shown averaged over each month in Fig. 5 for the Capitanata and
    Chiese Consortia areas, highlighting differences between the two. Download : Download

    among anomalies of soil moisture, precipitation, NDVI and LST in the Capitanata
    (left-hand column) and Chiese (right-hand column) Consortia from 2000 to 2020.
    In the Capitanata Consortium, considering SPI and SMA, a consistency of 40% is
    found with both negative anomalies during the summer months, and of 50% for only
    a negative SM anomaly for the same period. This is in line with the characteristics
    of this agricultural area, which is generally very dry in summer with few precipitation
    events and only 40% of the area is cultivated with irrigated crops. During the
    other months of the year, the conditions of no drought or of opposite signs of
    the anomalies (mainly due to a negative SPI anomaly) prevail. Hence, the Pearson
    correlation coefficient over the whole period between SPI and SMA is quite low
    (0.2). SMA and VISA agree on drought conditions roughly 40% of the time. This
    situation might be due to the fact that the vegetated areas are mainly irrigated
    and the NDVI index obtained from the MODIS dataset at 1 km of spatial resolution
    is able to catch these differences, while the soil moisture from the low spatial
    resolution dataset (25 km) is not detecting the differences between irrigated
    and not irrigated fields, but only the average area value. Moreover, it might
    be related to the different time response of the index to drought (e.g. precipitation
    is the first while vegetation is the last). In general, a low and positive Pearson
    coefficient (0.23) is found between SMA and NDVIA all over the years. A high seasonal
    dynamic of anomalies consistencies is also registered between SMA and LSTA (not
    shown), with a consistency of 50% indicating both drought conditions as well as
    only SM stress during the summer months. This is in line with the obtained results
    between SMA and VISA, as well as similar explanations could be given on the response
    of LST to SM conditions. A negative Pearson correlation is found (-0.19). A non-defined
    trend in the consistencies is instead obtained between SPI and VISA (not shown)
    as well as between LSTA and VISA (bottom row of Fig. 5), with a non-predominant
    situation along the year. A positive correlation is obtained between SPI and NDVAI
    (0.18), while a weak negative one between LSTA and VISA (-0.05). However, LSTA
    and VISA are negatively correlated only during summer (-0.2), while a positive
    value is obtained if only winter months are considered (0.33). This might be due
    to the fact that vegetation stress response delays with respect to water deficit
    and high temperature. For the Chiese Consortium (right-hand panels of Fig. 5),
    a non-seasonal distribution of the consistencies is observable for all variables
    couples’ comparisons, with no predominance of a drought or no drought conditions
    in any month of the year. The Chiese area is intensively cultivated with forages
    all the year as well as irrigated, leading to controlled conditions for LST, SM
    and NDVI. If SPI and SMA are compared, the Pearson correlation coefficient over
    the whole period is positive (0.32) with a lower correlation during summer (0.1).
    This might be simply explained by the fact that in the Chiese Consortium during
    the summer season when maize crop is largely cultivated (90% of the area), high
    amounts of irrigation are used, leading to positive SMA anomalies which, however,
    might be present with negative SPI values. Conversely to the Capitanata Consortium,
    the Pearson correlation between SMA and VISA is slightly negative (-0.07), with
    SM negative anomalies which are usually not reflected into vegetation stress.
    As there seems to be no prevailing trend in consistency, all the other variables
    correlations are very low, being negative the ones between SPI and LSTA (-0.01),
    SPI and VISA (-0.04) as well as SMA and LSTA −0.01, while a slight positive correlation
    is obtained between LSTA and VISA (0.1). 4. Agricultural drought monitoring indicator
    (ADMIN) As a step forward from the single anomalies, the ADMIN is computed at
    daily time scale combining the different anomalies (SPI-1 from ERA5, SM from ESA
    CCI Combined, LST and NDVI from MODIS) with the procedure defined in Fig. 1. To
    easily compare how the level of dryness changes in time, the cumulative drought
    index curve is evaluated for each year, summing all the daily contributions. In
    Fig. 6, the comparison is reported for both case studies in terms of daily and
    yearly cumulated values. All the curves have a common behaviour: from the begin
    of the year till March the curves have gentle slopes, then from March to October
    they are very steep due to drought conditions, and at the end of the year they
    return flat. This behavior agrees with the crop seasonality and with the irrigation
    period. In general, a good accordance is visible among the different series, being
    the high-resolution series able to accurately reproduce the low-resolution behavior,
    even if for a shorter time period of analysis. In Capitanata area, the driest
    years are identified as 2003, 2011, 2012 and 2017, while the wettest years are
    2010 and 2014 (Fig. 6). Similarly for the Chiese Consortium, 2010 and 2014 are
    identified as very wet years, while very dry years are 2003, 2007, 2017 and 2019.

    Fig. 6. ADMIN daily values and cumulative yearly values for Capitanata and Chiese
    Consortia: SPI from ERA5, SM ESA-CCI Combined, LST and NDVI from MODIS. An example
    of the advantages and strengths of the ADMIN methodology is shown in Fig. 7, for
    the specific drought event involving the 2012 Capitanata agricultural season.
    The daily ADMIN values for that year (Fig. 7a) are contrasted with the corresponding
    single anomalies (SPI-1, SMA, LSTA, VISA, Fig. 7b). The effect of the May-June
    SPI negative anomaly on the other variables is delayed by at least one month,
    with VISA still showing low values in July. In general, the precipitation dynamics
    have high amplitudes, whereas the time periods of the responses from the soil
    moisture levels and plant wellbeing are quite long, confirming the possible asynchronous
    behavior of the different variables. On the other hand, the ADMIN catches up the
    low SPI values and starts to register the effect on vegetation by early June.
    When SPI reaches close-to-zero values (July), ADMIN levels remain between −2 and
    −3, due to the negative vegetation anomaly which is still not recovered. Download

    Example of the application of ADMIN to the agricultural seasons of 2012 for the
    Capitanata Consortium (left) and of 2003 for the Chiese Consortium: monthly variable
    anomalies (a) and corresponding daily ADMIN values (b). The asynchronies among
    indices are also visible for the Chiese area for the example year 2003 (Fig. 7).
    The daily ADMIN starts to decrease at the beginning of the year 2023 with the
    strong negative increase of all indices (SPI, SMA and VISA), besides LSTA which
    is increasing. The effect of the reduction of the May-July SPI and SMA negative
    anomalies on VISA is delayed by at least two months, due to the strong positive
    anomaly of LSTA. 4.1. ADMIN performances We can conduct a first qualitative examination
    of the temporal evolution of the ADMIN combined indicator for each analysed year,
    by comparing with reference datasets, during the crops growing seasons. In the
    Capitanata area, the ADMIN identifies as driest years as 2003, 2011, 2012 and
    2017, while the wettest years are 2010 and 2014. A first confirmation of the capability
    of ADMIN to detect agricultural drought conditions is the comparison with local
    analyses by the Italian farmers association Coldiretti (https://www.coldiretti.it/),
    which reports very high temperatures and water shortages during the summer 2003,
    August 2012 and July 2017, and reduction in tomatoes productions that exceeds
    20–25%. Similarly, the Italian government natural calamity report (https://www.politicheagricole.it)
    confirmed the significance of the 2012 and 2017 droughts, enabling an economic
    compensation for verified losses surpassing 30% of the production (Ministerial
    Decree April 18, 2008). Furthermore, a comparison of drought indications is performed
    against the European Drought Observatory (EDO, https://edo.jrc.ec.europa.eu),
    as being the operative reference at European Commission level. An agreement is
    found between the two drought indicators in the Capitanata area in identifying
    the driest year for 2012 and 2017, while the EDO is not reporting a vegetation
    drought in 2012 and no soil moisture drought in 2003. This last year however was
    one of the driest years in Italy and Europe (Diodato and Bellocchi, 2008, Musolino
    et al., 2018). Similarly for the Chiese Consortium, 2010 and 2014 are identified
    as very wet years, while very dry years are 2003, 2007, 2017 and 2019. ADMIN is
    in general agreement with EDO estimates, except for the year 2017 where no vegetation
    drought is detected by EDO and for the year 2010 where EDO is not reporting soil
    moisture positive anomalies. It should be noted that the EDO system is using the
    FPAR index for vegetation instead of NDVI, and the soil moisture estimates come
    from a land surface model (Sepulcre-Canto et al., 2012) and not from satellite
    measurements. Additionally, the European drought impact report inventory, EDII
    (Blauhut et al., 2022), is considered, as it lists the impacts of droughts at
    regional level between 2003 and 2019. Specifically, for the Lombardia region the
    years 2003, 2012, 2015 and 2017 are identified in EDII as drought years with many
    reported negative impacts. The ADMIN indicator agrees in identifying those years
    as the worse drought events. For the Puglia region, the main droughts with reported
    impacts are identified in the EDII as the years 2008, 2012, 2015 and 2017. The
    ADMIN indicator is able to detect the relevancy of the drought conditions, especially
    the important drought events of 2012, 2015 and 2017. 4.2. Relationship between
    ADMIN and irrigation volume and crop yield Irrigation volumes are a way to provide
    a reliable assessment of the drought impacts and consequently the ability of ADMIN
    as an index, as one can expect a higher volume of water used for irrigation during
    stressed conditions. In the Capitanata Consortium, observed daily cumulated irrigation
    volumes are provided by the aqueduct from 2006 to 2016, except for 2008 and 2009,
    from the 1st of April to 31st December for each year. These values are compared
    to the daily cumulated ADMIN in the same periods of irrigation volumes availability.
    A difference of about 20’000’000 m3 of irrigation water volume is found in observed
    data between the most irrigated year, i.e. 2012 and the least irrigated one, i.e.
    2009. By comparing the behaviour of ADMIN and irrigation volumes, it is immediately
    visible the high consistency among the years, with the driest years (2012 and
    2011), characterized by the lowest ADMIN values, being the years with the highest
    water volumes used for irrigation (not shown). This is confirmed from the scatterplot
    of the cumulative drought index values and irrigation volume at the end of each
    year (Fig. 8). A negative relationship is shown, where an increase in the drought
    index means an increase of dryness conditions, meaning that more irrigation is
    required. Download : Download high-res image (121KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 8. Seasonal cumulated ADMIN index relationship with irrigation volumes
    and with rainfall plus irrigation for the Capitanata and the Chiese Consortia.
    Furthermore, the ADMIN is also compared to the cumulated volumes of the total
    water supplied to the fields, by summing the precipitation volume to the irrigation
    one. A slightly positive relationship is obtained, meaning that during all years,
    the total amount of water (irrigation + precipitation) provided to crops is similar.
    This might be explained by the fact that in the Capitanata Irrigation Consortium
    the farmers pay a quota for m3 of water used per ha; so that during wetter years,
    lower irrigation volumes are provided. An opposite situation is observed in the
    Chiese Irrigation Consortium (Fig. 8) where the cumulated ADMIN and the irrigation
    volumes provided by the channels network at the end of each year are compared
    in a scatterplot. Almost zero correlation is found, with an almost constant amount
    of irrigation volumes which is provided to the crops every year independently
    from the drought or not condition. Consequently, if rainfall volumes are added
    to the irrigation ones, a positive correlation is obtained. This is immediately
    explainable by the water costs in the Chiese Consortium, where the farmers pay
    a fixed quota every year per ha independently from the volumes of water used.
    Hence, during the rainy years, too much water is probably provided to the crops.
    As a further validation of the implemented index as well as to understand the
    impact that possible drought conditions might have on crops production, a crop
    specific relationship is analysed in the two case studies by comparing the Consortium
    crop yields and the ADMIN values (Fig. 9). Download : Download high-res image
    (76KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Seasonal cumulated ADMIN index
    and crop production relationship, for tomatoes in the Capitanata Consortium and
    for summer crops in the Chiese Consortium. In the Capitanata Consortium, the crop
    yield seems to be almost uncorrelated with the ADMIN index. This might be due
    to the fact that the area is highly irrigated during summer and that the amount
    of irrigation is capable of contrasting the drought conditions allowing to maintain
    an almost constant production over the years. The oscillations in contrast might
    be related to other factors, as changes in pest and diseases. A common problem
    in the tomato production in the area is the Phytophthora infestans, which is especially
    affecting the crops during conditions of water stagnation. Even if the agricultural
    drought monitoring index reaches high negative values, these are persistent for
    few days, which are not enough for affecting the crop production. Moreover, opposite
    climate extremes as frost conditions or hailstorms during the spring, might also
    strongly affect crop production, but are not detected by the implemented drought
    index. In the Chiese Consortium, a similar null relationship is obtained between
    the summer irrigated crops yield and the ADMIN index. As well, this area is highly
    irrigated with an excess of water used, which is not affecting the production.
    This might be instead affected by other external factors (e.g. hailstorms, pest
    and diseases). The relationship is thus having a spread preventing from the conclusion
    of a direct link with crop production in the analysed case studies. To further
    understand the strength of the developed ADMIN indicator, the single anomalies
    on which it is based, are directly related with the drought impacts. In Fig. 10,
    three plots, conceptually similar to those in Fig. 8, Fig. 9, are shown, featuring
    the average value of the single anomalies over the crops season instead of the
    seasonal cumulated ADMIN, over the Capitanata test case. The strength of ADMIN
    is particularly relevant when the single anomalies are compared with the cumulated
    irrigation volume, where a positive dependency is found (at higher SPI values
    lower irrigation water volumes would be expected). Also, a positive relationship
    is found between SMA and the irrigation events. Moreover, comparing the determination
    coefficients (R2) with those from Fig. 8, the relationship between accumulated
    volume from the aqueduct and single anomaly is everywhere weaker with respect
    to the ADMIN. This difference is even wider when considering all water inputs
    (aqueduct and natural rainfall), with the coefficients of determination falling
    below 0.20. Finally, when looking at the final yield (Fig. 10c), to be contrasted
    with Fig. 9, a similar behaviour is observed if considering the ADMIN or single
    anomalies, as the drought effect on the final crop yield is dampened by the irrigation
    events. Similar conclusions can be drawn for the Chiese Consortium case study.

    tomatoes in the Capitanata Consortium. 4.3. ADMIN uncertainties As many remotely-sensed
    based products of soil moisture, vegetation indices and land surface temperature
    are available (Table1), their impact on the ADMIN calculation is evaluated by
    computing their respective anomalies. The analyses are done according to the years
    for which each product is available (Table1). Firstly, the Pearson correlation
    coefficient is computed among the different SM datasets anomalies, for both case
    studies (Table2). This is computed taking each product at a time as reference.
    Considering the differences in spatial resolution (25 km for ESA CCI, 40/50 km
    for SMAP and SMOS, 1 km for Sentinel 1–30 m of FEST-EWB), in satellite reading
    frequency and retrieval algorithm, generally low r values are found with a better
    correlation in the Chiese area (Table2) (Paciolla et al., 2021). One main distinction
    between the two test cases is the wetness level: the Chiese case study sees higher
    average yearly rainfalls (>750 mm/yr, with more than 200 rainy days a year) with
    respect to Capitanata (550 mm/yr, with 150 rainy days a year). This seems to reflect
    positively on the correlation between the different SMAs, probably because it
    corresponds with a more stable, less peaked SM trend, easier to reproduce from
    products working at different resolutions and with different algorithms. In contrast,
    the high heterogeneity of the Capitanata Consortium (e.g. high contrast between
    hot dry bare soil pixels and vegetated wet pixels during summer) leads to lower
    average correlations among products anomalies. Table 2. Pearson correlations among
    SMA from different datasets for Capitanata (upper half table) and Chiese (lower
    half table). The correlations are computed according to the years for which every
    pair of data is available. Capitanata ESA CCI- Combined ESA CCI-active ESA CCI-passive
    SMOS SMOS-rootzone SMAP Copernicus S1 FEST-EWB Chiese ESA CCI- Combined 0.65 -
    0.37 0.17 0.34 0.31 0.2 ESA CCI-active 0.79 - 0.41 0.16 0.37 0.41 0.22 ESA CCI-passive

    The results show how the ESA CCI datasets are the ones best correlated to each
    other overall, even if this result is mainly driven by the fact the ESA CCI Combined
    dataset includes the other two (Active and Passive). Similarly, the data from
    SMOS, SMAP and S1 are weakly correlated to ESA CCI data and among each other,
    showing that no further contribution seems to be provided by higher-resolution
    information. The data of the FEST-EWB model are similarly correlated to all the
    others, with a uniform distribution over the two case studies. In particular,
    soil depth representativeness of the remotely sensed products is 7–10 cm while
    it is of 60 cm for FEST-EWB. Also, the length of the different datasets doesn’t
    seem to impact on the results, being the SMOS one available from 2000 while Sentinel
    1 and SMPA only from 2014 and 2015, respectively. The adequacy between the LST
    anomaly calculated from MODIS and Landsat data is also calculated, with a RMSE
    equal to 0.1 °C and a Pearson coefficient of 0.73. These results agree with the
    validation of LST estimates (i.e., not anomalies) as obtained by Jimenez-Munoz,
    et al. (2014), or Corbari et al. (2020) who compared LANDSAT 7 and 8 against ground
    data with mean absolute differences close to zero with an RMSE of 3.0 K and of
    2.0 K for LANDSAT 7 and 8, respectively. As well, Duan et al. (2019) obtained
    for MODIS daytime data RMSE values around 2 K. A similar analysis has been performed
    for the vegetation indices anomalies, as it is still an open problem in literature
    which index best represents the crops stress and dynamics (Huete et al., 1997).
    Hence, anomalies are calculated for all the vegetation indices NDVI, NDWI, EVI
    and SAVI from MODIS and compared. The inter-comparison between the indexes is
    shown by the Pearson correlation coefficients in Table3. In general, the best
    alignment is observed between NDVI and SAVI, with negative/positivize anomalies
    detected in the same periods; the similarities between NDVI and EVI are somewhat
    weaker; finally, some inconsistencies are detected between NDVI and NDWI, with
    some peaks with opposite signs. As it is well known, NDVI is strongly correlated
    to leaf area color and low values are synonymous of vegetation stress with a reduced
    photosynthetic capacity, while NDWI is linked with the crops leaves’ moisture.
    The opposite peaks are caused by precipitation events that produce an immediate
    increase in the NDWI values but not in the NDVI, that is always affected by a
    delay in the response. However, Gu et al., (2008) found that both indices might
    be suitable for vegetation drought analysis. Table 3. Pearson correlations among
    different vegetation indices anomalies for Capitanata (upper half table) and Chiese
    (lower half table). The correlations are computed according to the years for which
    every pair of data is available. Capitanata NDVI EVI SAVI NDWI Chiese NDVI 0.65
    1.00 0.49 EVI 0.5 0.65 0.35 SAVI 1 0.5 0.49 NDWI 0.44 0.44 0.44 Moreover, while
    NDVI estimates might be influenced by soil background conditions and non-drought
    stress conditions, such as plant disease (Xue and Su, 2017), similar anomalies
    changes are detected with SAVI index, which on the contrary is not influenced
    by soil effects (changes in soil color or soil moisture). The EVI index which
    accounts for the interaction of the atmospheric conditions (Liu and Huete, 1995),
    is similarly correlated to NDVI and SAVI anomalies. The impact of using the different
    soil moisture products in ADMIN is further evaluated for both case studies, keeping
    fixed the products for the anomaly calculation of precipitation, vegetation and
    temperature in respect to the ADMIN computed with the benchmark configuration
    (as defined in Section 2.2.1 Data sources: ERA5 for precipitation, ESA-CCI Combined
    dataset for SMA, MODIS data for both LSTA and the vegetation anomaly) while changing
    one at a time the soil moisture product. The relative yearly difference is thus
    computed and reported in the color scale of Fig. 11. The ESA CCI Active and Passive
    products provide generally lower yearly ADMIN values, indicating harsher drought
    conditions. This happens especially in the early 2000 s, specifically for the
    Active product across both case studies. The ESA CCI Passive product, not available
    for the Capitanata case study, in the Chiese area shows a higher divergence from
    the ESA CCI Combined one. The case of SMOS is of interest, as both the superficial
    and root-zone products are available: over both areas, the superficial product
    leads to lower values of yearly ADMIN (harsher drought), whereas the root-zone
    one is generally more in agreement with the ESA CCI Combined-powered ADMIN, apart
    from some higher values (milder drought) around the early 2010 s. Finally, the
    SMAP product (available for only 5 years) generally indicates drier conditions.
    One possible explanation for the differences could be that the “hybrid” nature
    (joining both Passive and Active datasets) of the ESA CCI Combined product makes
    it hardly comparable with more “exclusive” products (either Passive or Active).
    The hybrid nature of SMAP would call for more similarities with the ADMIN computed
    with ESA CCI Combined product (benchmark ADMIN), even though five years is too
    short a temporal horizon to provide absolute results. Download : Download high-res

    and each row identifies a specific variation of the satellite product on a certain
    anomaly. The yearly ADMIN relative difference with the benchmark combination of
    products is represented by cell color, with years without data for comparison
    left in grey. Years with observed irrigation volumes data available are bordered
    in thick blue. Similarly, the impact of the four considered vegetation indices
    on the computation of the annual ADMIN is evaluated and it is generally very mild
    (Fig. 11), as a consequence of the high correlation among NDVI, NDWI, EVI and
    SAVI anomalies. This concept generally holds, except for some years (2004, 2007
    and 2008) in the Capitanata area, when higher yearly ADMIN values are detected.
    In the last rows of Fig. 11, a focus on high resolution is performed, featuring
    both high-resolution SM datasets (the 1 km Copernicus and the 30 m results from
    the FEST-EWB hydrological model) and LST and NDVI datasets (Landsat imagery instead
    of MODIS). Using higher-resolution datasets can limit the revisit time but might
    improve the representation of spatial heterogeneities in complex agricultural
    areas. For both Chiese and Capitanata, the second half of the years 2010 s records
    some negative differences in terms of ADMIN, with respect to the benchmark ADMIN.
    This effect is more marked in the Capitanata case study, as expected from a highly-heterogeneous
    area, with numerous empty plots bordering active agricultural fields. The differences
    are less marked in the Chiese case study, being quite close to zero in the 2005–2013
    period (for the FEST-EWB + Landsat combination) and generally low when employing
    Copernicus SSM, as expected from an area more urbanized but definitely more homogeneous
    in terms of crop distribution. Finally, the uncertainty of the ADMIN impact on
    the relationship with irrigation volumes and crop yields is computed, by considering
    the different combinations of the remotely sensed products for the different variables
    (Fig. 12). For both case studies, and for all the combinations described until
    now, the same comparisons as shown in Fig. 8, Fig. 9 are performed, and the slope
    and determination coefficient of the linear interpolation are provided. The products
    for which only 2 datapoints are available are excluded from the analysis. Download

    Comparison between yearly ADMIN obtained from different satellite products, against
    irrigation volumes and final crop yield, for both Capitanata and Chiese case studies.
    Benchmark ADMIN is highlighted with a light-yellow background, and each row identifies
    a specific variation of the satellite product on a certain anomaly. For each comparison,
    the number of data points (n), the slope of the linear regression (slope) and
    the determination coefficient (R2) are shown. Dependencies with a different sign
    than the one of the benchmark ADMIN are highlighted in red. For the Capitanata
    case study, all combinations show a negative slope of the linear relationship
    between yearly ADMIN and cumulative irrigation, confirming how during drier years
    higher water volumes are employed; hence providing similar results to the benchmark
    ADMIN. The strength of these relationships is described by the determination coefficient,
    with the default ADMIN being in third place overall, but over a longer set of
    years than the top two combinations (powered by the two versions of SMOS). Looking
    at crop yields, the slopes of the linear relationship with yearly ADMINs are expected
    to be negative, as drier conditions (lower ADMIN values) are associated with less
    developed crops. This is the case for most combinations, except for the ADMINs
    employing SMAP or Copernicus as SSM source (although the strength of these relations
    is quite low and the datapoints available are too few to derive robust conclusions
    from this comparison). In the Chiese area, on the other hand, irrigation is provided
    in a fixed pattern independently of the year dryness, and this is reflected in
    the linear relationships between irrigation and yearly ADMIN. The slopes of the
    different combinations are more heterogeneous in sign. As drought conditions and
    water volumes should be weakly correlated, the lowest determination coefficients
    mark generally better performances (e.g., those from SMOS and the benchmark ADMIN).
    Finally, looking at crop yields, the weakness of the linear relationships of the
    different combinations are justified by the large water amounts employed that
    smooth out the year-to-year variation in dry conditions. As seen for the comparisons
    between the different versions of ADMIN, the considerable heterogeneity of this
    agricultural area means that few major differences emerge in employing higher-resolution
    datasets. 5. Discussion and conclusion Following the principles of the Common
    Agricultural Policy (CAP) to improve irrigation management to reduce crop damages
    and to enhance economic income, an EO-based drought indicator, ADMIN, has been
    developed for the operative management of irrigation networks, demonstrating its
    capability in providing reliable estimates of drought conditions correctly identifying
    the wet and dry years. The ADMIN might help irrigation districts managers and
    farmers to activate the preventive protection actions to try to avoid water volume
    and crop yield losses. The methodology has been applied in two cases studies:
    the Chiese and Capitanata Irrigation Consortia in Italy, over 20 years of analysis
    for the period from 2000 to 2019. The robustness of the developed drought index
    has been evaluated by assessing the effect of drought events on the effectively
    used irrigation volumes and yearly crop yields at Irrigation Consortium Scale,
    in Southern and Northern Italy. This quantitative verification of the methodology,
    especially against irrigation volumes, represents an innovative point in respect
    to the generally implemented drought monitoring systems, mostly not validated
    with external data but relying only on comparisons among indices (Wood et al.,
    2015, Sheffield et al., 2012, van Dijk et al., 2013) or economic impacts evaluation
    (Ding et al., 2011). In the Capitanata Consortium, a negative correlation is obtained
    between the yearly cumulative drought index values and irrigation volumes, where
    an increase in the drought index means an increase of dryness condition, meaning
    that more irrigation is required; conversely in the Chiese Consortium a zero correlation
    is obtained with an almost constant amount of irrigation volumes provided to the
    crops every year independently from the drought condition. This might be explainable
    by the irrigation water payment plan, where in the Capitanata Irrigation Consortium
    the farmers pay a quota for m3 of water used per ha, so that during wetter years,
    less irrigation volumes are provided; while in the Chiese Consortium, the farmers
    pay a fixed quota every year per ha independently from the volumes of water used,
    so during the rainy years, too much water is probably provided to the crops. In
    both analyzed areas, crop yields seem to be almost uncorrelated to the drought
    index, probably due to the fact that the area is highly irrigated during summer
    and that the amount of irrigation is capable of contrasting the drought conditions
    allowing to maintain an almost constant production over the years. One of the
    strengths of the developed procedure relies on the capability of capturing the
    temporal evolution of the agricultural drought process, by firstly considering
    the meteorological drought and then the agricultural one, vegetation water stress
    and crop drying. This methodology improves the traditional analysis, which are
    generally analysed by considering only soil moisture anomalies (van Hateren et
    al., 2021, Sadri et al., 2018). In fact, the results of this work clearly show
    that asynchronies may exist especially between soil moisture anomalies and vegetation
    or land surface temperature anomalies, with negative SMA and positive VISA. This
    situation might be especially relevant when conditions of energy limited to vegetation
    growth are present, so that vegetation is less affected by soil moisture changes.
    This is due to the multifaced processes of vegetation, which is not driven only
    by water availability (Nemani et al., 2003, Jin et al., 2023). These results are
    in general agreement with the findings of Wanders et al. (2017), Bachmair et al.
    (2018), Tijdeman et al. (2022), who highlighted that, generally, droughts cannot
    be described by one single indicator but there is the need first to select the
    correct physical index for detecting a drought type and secondly to use different
    drought indices to identify specific conditions to avoid disagreements among information
    sources (Parsons et al., 2019; Sheffield et al., 2012). Another strength of the
    developed methodology is that the ADMIN is fully based on remote sensing data,
    considering different products of the same variable which differ on the sensing
    techniques, the spatial and temporal resolutions. The combinations of different
    products lead to different absolute drought values but these are almost all consistent
    (e.g. positive or negative anomalies). Given this, the ADMIN could be easily exported
    in any area worldwide. In particular, seven to eight soil moisture products anomalies
    have been compared and generally low Pearson correlation values are found with
    a better correlation in the Chiese area, probably due to higher average yearly
    rainfalls which correspond with a more stable, less peaked SM behaviour, easier
    to reproduce from products working at different resolutions and with different
    algorithms. The results show how the ESA CCI datasets are the ones best correlated
    to each other overall, even if this result is mainly driven by the fact the ESA
    CCI Combined dataset includes the other two (Active and Passive). The reason why
    satellite SM does not show encouraging results may lie, among other reasons, in
    the fact that satellite soil moisture products are limited to the top few cm of
    soil, whereas a soil moisture drought assessment is ideally based on observations
    over the entire root zone, as well as the presence of coastlines in nearby the
    Capitanata area or the water bodies in the Chiese Consortium. The physical inconsistencies
    that satellite SSM data shows against water input (both rainfall and irrigation)
    make them not fully suitable to be used alone in drought detection. On the other
    hand, high consistency has been obtained among different vegetation indices, with
    NDVI anomalies showing a high Pearson correlation especially with EVI and SAVI
    anomalies. This result in terms of anomalies confirms the general behaviour of
    this multitude of vegetation indices which, even if they produce slightly different
    results in terms of vegetation water status, does not significantly change the
    drought detection (Shahabfar et al., 2012). Another point worth of notice is the
    insertion of the LST anomaly into the drought monitoring index to detect the plant
    water stress in advance in respect to plant drying. This relies on the fact that
    the LST is the driving factor of the partitioning between latent and sensible
    heat fluxes in the energy balance. This LST consideration is an improvement of
    the generally used agricultural drought indices, which are mostly based on rainfall,
    soil moisture or vegetation indices. This paper tried to respond also the issues
    related to spatial resolution of satellite data answering to the question if high
    resolution information is needed for drought monitoring and irrigation aqueduct
    management. The obtained results indicate the advantage of using high-resolution
    data in respect to low resolution data, as being able to catch the same behavior
    in terms of agricultural drought detection at Irrigation district scale, and potentially
    offers important new advantages for applications even down to field scales. This
    might be particularly relevant in complex landscapes, where low resolution data
    might produce contrasting signals, leading to a limitation to the applicability

  limitations: The paper does not discuss specific limitations of the ADMIN indicator
    or outline any potential challenges or biases in its application. Nonetheless,
    it can be noted that the indicator combines different indices, each based on different
    temporal scales, leading to a redundancy of information and a potential for inconsistencies.
    Additionally, the study focuses on two specific case studies, which may limit
    the generalizability of the findings. The authors also acknowledge that satellite
    soil moisture products are limited to the top few cm of soil, whereas a soil moisture
    drought assessment is ideally based on observations over the entire root zone,
    as well as the presence of coastlines in nearby areas.
  methodology: "Following the principles of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) to\
    \ improve irrigation management to reduce crop damages and to enhance economic\
    \ income, an EO-based drought indicator, ADMIN, has been developed for the operative\
    \ management of irrigation networks, demonstrating its capability in providing\
    \ reliable estimates of drought conditions correctly identifying the wet and dry\
    \ years. The ADMIN might help irrigation districts managers and farmers to activate\
    \ the preventive protection actions to try to avoid water volume and crop yield\
    \ losses. \nThe methodology has been applied in two cases studies: the Chiese\
    \ and Capitanata Irrigation Consortia in Italy, over 20 years of analysis for\
    \ the period from 2000 to 2019. The robustness of the developed drought index\
    \ has been evaluated by assessing the effect of drought events on the effectively\
    \ used irrigation volumes and yearly crop yields at Irrigation Consortium Scale,\
    \ in Southern and Northern Italy."

  verbatim_quote1: The ADMIN indicator has demonstrated its capability in providing
    reliable estimates of drought conditions correctly identifying the wet and dry
    years.
  verbatim_quote2: In the Capitanata Consortium, a negative correlation is obtained
    between the yearly cumulative drought index values and irrigation volumes, where
    an increase in the drought index means an increase of dryness condition, meaning
    that more irrigation is required; conversely in the Chiese Consortium a zero correlation
    is obtained with an almost constant amount of irrigation volumes provided to the
    crops every year independently from the drought condition.

- analysis: 'The provided paper presents a valuable agro-physiological dataset for
    industrial tomato production in Mediterranean environments, focusing on the impact
    of various deficit irrigation (DI) strategies. The dataset includes agro-physiological
    traits gathered over nine years from 100 experimental plots subjected to 32 different
    DI treatments. This rich collection of data on tomato phenology, qualitative and
    quantitative production, pedo-climatic conditions, and detailed irrigation scheduling,
    provides a comprehensive resource for researchers and professionals in the agricultural
    sector.


    The dataset contributes to the point of interest, "Considerations: volume, frequency,
    format, and source of the data," by providing detailed information on the source,
    format, and volume of the data collected. The dataset is compiled from field experiments
    conducted over multiple years, ensuring its validity and reliability. Moreover,
    the data is presented in a structured and homogenized format, making it convenient
    for researchers to utilize it in their studies and analyses.


    The dataset''s value extends beyond its focus on DI strategies. It also includes
    data on a range of variables relevant to irrigation management, such as weather
    variability and pedo-climatic conditions. This comprehensive approach allows researchers
    to investigate the complex interactions between DI strategies, environmental factors,
    and tomato growth and production.


    The paper highlights the importance of the dataset as a reference basis for evaluating
    agro-physiological models and studying the relationships between DI and tomato
    performance. It also emphasizes the dataset''s role as ground truth for digital
    decision support systems, enabling them to provide accurate guidance to farmers
    on efficient water use. The availability of such a comprehensive and reliable
    dataset is a significant step towards advancing research and innovation in irrigation
    management for industrial tomato cultivation.'

  description: The availability of field experimental data plays a pivotal role in
    advancing agricultural research, particularly in the Mediterranean, where farmers
    face significant challenges due to water scarcity and changing climatic conditions.
    We present a multi-year homogenized dataset of agro-physiological traits collected
    on industrial tomatoes and focused on the effect of deficit irrigation (DI). The
    dataset has been compiled over nine years and comprises 100 experimental plots,
    where 32 DI strategies have been tested. Visual observations on tomato phenology
    and qualitative and quantitative production data have been collected in field
    and laboratory surveys, complemented with detailed information on pedo-climatic
    conditions and irrigation scheduling (timing and volume). Researchers can find
    in this dataset a rich source for calibrating and evaluating agro-physiological
    models and a reference basis to study the relationships between DI strategies,
    weather variability, and the performance of tomato growing systems. Agronomists
    from the public and private sectors can gain domain knowledge to support local
    farmers with the best DI strategies to achieve high yields while optimizing water
    use. Moreover, this dataset serves as ground truth for digital decision support
    systems, which need real-world data to enhance their accuracy in guiding farmers
    on efficient water use. This data source is intended to become a crucial asset
    for researchers, agronomists, and decision-makers in the Mediterranean as it bridges
    the gap between research and practice in an area where farmers are already striving
    with water scarcity for industrial tomato cultivation.

    availability of field experimental data plays a pivotal role in advancing agricultural
    research, particularly in the Mediterranean, where farmers face significant challenges
    due to water scarcity and changing climatic conditions. We present a multi-year
    homogenized dataset of agro-physiological traits collected on industrial tomatoes
    and focused on the effect of deficit irrigation (DI). The dataset has been compiled
    over nine years and comprises 100 experimental plots, where 32 DI strategies have
    been tested. Visual observations on tomato phenology and qualitative and quantitative
    production data have been collected in field and laboratory surveys, complemented
    with detailed information on pedo-climatic conditions and irrigation scheduling
    (timing and volume). Researchers can find in this dataset a rich source for calibrating
    and evaluating agro-physiological models and a reference basis to study the relationships
    between DI strategies, weather variability, and the performance of tomato growing
    systems. Agronomists from the public and private sectors can gain domain knowledge
    to support local farmers with the best DI strategies to achieve high yields while
    optimizing water use. Moreover, this dataset serves as ground truth for digital
    decision support systems, which need real-world data to enhance their accuracy
    in guiding farmers on efficient water use. This data source is intended to become
    a crucial asset for researchers, agronomists, and decision-makers in the Mediterranean
    as it bridges the gap between research and practice in an area where farmers are
    already striving with water scarcity for industrial tomato cultivation. Previous

    1. Value of the Data • The dataset constitutes a reference basis to evaluate the
    effects of DI strategies on the yield and quality of industrial tomatoes grown
    in a Mediterranean area. Its peculiarity lies in the homogenous measurements of
    agro-physiological traits from nine years of field experiments, which have been
    complemented with physical soil properties, daily weather variables, and detailed
    irrigation scheduling. • This dataset is useful to scientists who develop and
    use agro-physiological models reproducing the effects of pedo-climatic conditions
    and soil water availability on the growth and development of industrial tomatoes.
    They can be used either for model calibration and evaluation or as a reference
    background to develop new process-based simulation models. • Agronomists and technicians
    from extension services in the area could benefit from this dataset where yield
    and major quality tomato traits are harmonized. They can use these data to gain
    knowledge and elaborate the best DI strategies to support farmers facing situations
    of water scarcity and high temperatures as a consequence of climatic changes.
    • The dataset can be used to test and validate the performances of commercial
    or public digital decision support systems to optimize irrigation water use for
    growing industrial tomato, which is one of the most cultivated and water-demanding
    crops in Southern Italy. 2. Background Italy is the largest tomato producer in
    Europe and a major tomato producing country worldwide, along with China, India,
    Turkey, and the United States. Most Italian tomato production occurs in the Capitanata
    plain in Southern Italy, where tomato cultivation is very intensive, especially
    regarding irrigation water requirements, which typically range from 400 to 600
    mm. During the growing season (May–August), tomato plants face significant challenges
    due to low precipitation, leading to frequent water stress during critical growth
    phases. According to climatic projections in Mediterranean areas, groundwater
    availability will be restricted, requiring better rationalization of water use
    to sustain tomato yields and quality. Currently, tomato farming irrigation scheduling
    involves fixed intervals between irrigation supplies regardless of the crop water
    demand, which results in over-irrigation. Therefore, it is necessary to improve
    water use efficiency by adopting water-saving strategies, such as deficit irrigation.
    3. Data Description This dataset has been collected during multi-year field trials
    conducted to assess the effect of alternative DI strategies on industrial tomato.
    DI is a widely investigated farming strategy that reduces water applications below
    optimal crop requirements during the crop cycle without compromising production
    [1,2]. The dataset comprises 100 experimental plots carried out in nine years
    and entails 32 DI treatments. The treatments include nine controls (well-watered),
    15 constant DI treatments (i.e., same irrigation regime during the crop cycle),
    and eight variable DI treatments. The dataset is released as a Microsoft Excel
    file (extension .xlsx) organized in eight sheets (Table 1) corresponding to the
    main typologies of data, i.e., irrigation water scheduling (volume and timing),
    physical soil characteristics, daily weather data, and agro-physiological variables
    (i.e., phenology, stomatal conductance, crop temperature, crop yield, and quality).

    Design, Materials and Methods 4.1. The field experimental design All field trials
    were conducted on a farm located in the Capitanata area (N 41° 32’ 37”; E 15°
    30’ 13”, Apulia, Southern Italy) in 2005–2006 and from 2012 to 2018, on industrial
    tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) cv. Ulisse F1 (S&G Syngenta Seeds S.p.A., Switzerland).
    Tomato plants have been transplanted in coupled rows spaced at 1.8 m, with a plant
    density of 2.8 plants m−2 (0.50 m between rows, 0.40 m on the row). A randomized
    block design was applied in all experiments, with three or four replications (blocks),
    and testing different deficit irrigation regimes. In the experimental years 2005–2006
    and from 2012 to 2016, the tomato water consumption was calculated considering
    measurements of soil water tension at the effective rooting depth (soil layer
    depths: 0–20, 20–40, 40–50, and 50–60 cm), using WATERMARK sensors (PN:200SS,
    Irrometer Company, Inc.; Riverside, CA). These sensors were installed in each
    control plot before transplanting. In the experimental years 2017–2018, the cloud-based
    decision support system Bluleaf™ (Sysman Progetti e Servizi Srl, Rome, Italy),
    was used to estimate the tomato water consumption. This system is based on real-time
    acquisition of weather and soil moisture (0.3 m and 0.6 m depth) data collected
    by wireless sensors (AgriSense™, Netsens, Florence, Italy), which are used to
    compute daily crop evapotranspiration (ETc, mm d−1). Daily reference evapotranspiration
    (ET0, mm d−1) was calculated using the Penman-Monteith equation [4], using crop
    coefficient (Kc) values specific to Mediterranean environments. ETc was estimated
    as ET0 × Kc, following the FAO two-step procedure [4]. In all experimental years,
    the irrigation was triggered when soil humidity fell below 40 % of the available
    water depletion until soil water content was set to field capacity. A drip irrigation
    system was used, as a single plastic pipe arranged in the middle of each paired
    row, with drippers of 2 L h–1 flow rate spaced every 0.4 m. Additionally, volumetric
    flow meters were used to monitor the distributed water volumes for each irrigation
    regime. The fertilisation practices and the pest and weed control replicated farmers’
    typical management in the area, aiming at growing the crop without any abiotic
    and biotic stress. A detailed description of the field experimental trials follows.
    4.2. Experimental years 2005–2006 Tomato plants were hand-transplanted on April
    28 (2005) and on May 2nd (2006). The field trials comprised five deficit irrigation
    regimes plus a control where 100 % of the tomato water consumption was restored
    (named 100 %). Two constant DI treatments were applied, restoring 50 % and 75
    % of the tomato water consumption. Three additional variable DI treatments were
    tested, where 50 %, 75 % and 50 % (named 507550 %), 75%, 100%, and 75% (named
    7510075 %), and of 50 %, 100 %, and 50 % (named 5010050 %) of the crop water consumption
    has been restored. These treatments have been differentiated in the three main
    crop phenological stages: from the end of transplanting shock to flowering of
    the first truss (S1); from the flowering of the first truss to fruit breaking
    colours of the first truss (S2); and from fruit breaking colours of the first
    truss to harvest (S3), respectively. The fresh fruits were hand-harvested on July
    31 (2005) and on August 14 (2006). 4.3. Experimental years 2012, and 2014–2016
    Tomato plants were hand-planted on April 25 (2012), April 28 (2014), April 29
    (2015) and April 27 (2016). The field trials comprised the 100 % control treatment
    and a constant DI treatment where 75 % of the crop water consumption was restored
    during the crop cycle (named 75 %). The fresh fruits were hand-harvested on August
    3 (2012), August 7 (2014), August 3 (2015), and on August 4 (2016). 4.4. Experimental
    year 2013 Tomato plants were hand-transplanted on April 29 (2013). This field
    trial comprised three DI treatments, plus the 100 % control treatment. The constant
    DI treatments were 0 %, irrigated only at transplanting and during fertigation,
    and 50 % and 75 %, which were characterized by restoring 50 % and 75 % of the
    tomato water consumption, respectively. The fresh fruits were hand-harvested on
    July 31 (2005) and on August 14 (2006). 4.5. Experimental years 2017–2018 Tomato
    plants were hand-transplanted on May 3 (2017) and April 27 (2018). The field trials
    tested three DI treatments plus the 100 % control treatment. Two constant deficit
    irrigation regimes were applied: 0 %, irrigated only at transplanting and during
    fertigation, and restoring 75% of the tomato water consumption. An additional
    variable irrigation regime was applied: 7550 %, restoring 75 % (S1–S2) and 50
    % (S2–S3), of the tomato water consumption. The fresh fruits were hand-harvested
    on July 31 (2005) and on August 14 (2006). 4.6. Data collection Soil physical
    characteristics were evaluated by taking samples at 0–0.4 m depth before transplanting.
    Soil analyses were performed following the standard procedure from Italian Ministerial
    Decree, 1999 [5]. Daily values of maximum and minimum air temperature (°C), rainfall
    (mm), global solar radiation (MJ m−2 d−1), maximum and minimum relative air humidity
    (%), and average wind speed (m s−1) were recorded from May to August (Fig. 1)
    by a weather station placed close to the experimental trials. The phenological
    stages of post-transplanting (S0), vegetative growth (S1), beginning of flowering
    (S2), and fruit setting (S3) have been recorded by weekly visual inspections,
    and set when 50 % of the plants reached a given phenological stage. During S2,
    canopy temperature has been measured between 12:00 a.m. and 01:00 p.m. (i.e.,
    at maximum sunlight intensity) on June 13 (2005), June 26 (2006), June 18 and
    July 2nd (2012), July 1st (2013), June 30 and July 3rd and 14 (2014), June 25,
    July 2nd, 6, 8, 13, and 15 (2015), and June 24 and 27, and July 4, 6, 11 and 13
    (2016). Canopy and air temperatures were recorded using an infrared thermometer
    with a spectral response of 8 mm to 14 mm (Scheduler Model 2; Delta-T Devices
    Ltd.); these values were used to calculate the crop water stress index (CWSI)
    [6]. In the Experimental year 2012, stomatal conductance (mol m–2 s–1) was measured
    during S2 stage (June 18th and July 2nd). Measures were taken underside the first
    fully expanded leaf [7] using a steady-state diffusion porometer (Model SC-1;
    Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA, USA) and randomly selecting ten leaves per replicate.
    Tomatoes were hand-harvest when the rate of ripe fruits reached approximately
    95 %; the following morpho-physiological traits were measured on six plants per
    plot: the weight of ripe (marketable production), unripe (green production), and
    rotten fruits (rotten production), the total production as the sum of marketable,
    green and rotten production, and the mean fruit weight. Ten ripe fruits per replication
    were randomly chosen for the quality measurements. The colour parameters were
    measured using a CM-700d spectrophotometer (Minolta Camera Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan),
    as the CIELAB coordinates (i.e., a*, b*) on two opposite sides of the middle part
    of the fruit surface. Total soluble solids (°Brix) were measured with a hand-held
    refractometer with automatic temperature compensation (mod. DBR35, XS INSTRUMENTS,
    Carpi, Italy). Titratable acidity (g citric acid 100 ml−1 fresh juice) and pH
    were measured according to AOAC Official method 942.15 and 981.21, respectively
    [8]. Limitations One limitation of this dataset is the absence of multiple leaf
    area index and fruit biomass samples throughout the growing season. This constraint
    hampers the ability to calibrate the daily dynamic progress of tomato growth precisely.
    However, the dataset compensates for this limitation by offering harvested yield
    data across various conditions. This enables crop modelers to obtain reliable
    insights into the impact of alternative deficit irrigation regimes under diverse
    tomato growing conditions. Ethics Statement Authors have read and follow the ethical

  description: Farm-level seasonal irrigation water usage is often highly variable
    across time and space in an irrigation district. Identifying the driving factors
    of this variation can help researchers and managers understand the underlying
    efficiency of water usage, identify the sources of water waste and develop best
    irrigation practices to facilitate the development of more efficient and sustainable
    irrigated cropping systems. This study explored driving factors for the seasonal
    irrigation water usage across an irrigation district in south-eastern Australia,
    using extensive climate, soil, cropping and water use data from 312 farms (a total
    of 1099 annual crop water use records). It focused on three irrigated crops (corn/maize,
    cotton and rice) for 2011–2019. Factors considered included climate, soils, irrigation
    practices and water allocation, from which key driving factors and their effects
    on the seasonal irrigation water usage were identified. A Bayesian hierarchical
    model averaging approach was developed to determine key predictors and estimate
    seasonal irrigation water usage. The Bayesian hierarchical modelling framework

    water usage was mainly driven by irrigation practices and soil, but the water

    • A Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) was developed for 1099 crop water use records.

    Abstract Farm-level seasonal irrigation water usage is often highly variable across
    time and space in an irrigation district. Identifying the driving factors of this
    variation can help researchers and managers understand the underlying efficiency
    of water usage, identify the sources of water waste and develop best irrigation
    practices to facilitate the development of more efficient and sustainable irrigated
    cropping systems. This study explored driving factors for the seasonal irrigation
    water usage across an irrigation district in south-eastern Australia, using extensive
    climate, soil, cropping and water use data from 312 farms (a total of 1099 annual
    crop water use records). It focused on three irrigated crops (corn/maize, cotton
    and rice) for 2011–2019. Factors considered included climate, soils, irrigation
    practices and water allocation, from which key driving factors and their effects
    on the seasonal irrigation water usage were identified. A Bayesian hierarchical
    model averaging approach was developed to determine key predictors and estimate
    seasonal irrigation water usage. The Bayesian hierarchical modelling framework
    allowed seasonal irrigation water usage to be estimated at all crop-farm-year
    observation points simultaneously while also enabling different key predictors
    to be selected for different crop types. Results showed that the seasonal irrigation
    water usage was mainly driven by irrigation practices and soil, but the water
    use of different crop types was driven by different subsets of irrigation and
    soil predictors. Modelling was undertaken in natural log space and the model showed
    reasonable accuracy in estimating the seasonal irrigation water usage (R2 = 0.62).
    Our model is considered useful in 1) identifying drivers of variation of the seasonal
    irrigation water usage across time and space, and 2) suggesting potential adjustments
    to irrigation practices and quantifying their benefits to reduce irrigation water
    usage. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Bayesian model

    plays an important role in food security and accounts for 40% of food production
    globally (Gaydon et al., 2012, Schultz et al., 2005, Gibson et al., 2018). Competition
    for water is increasing due to increasing water demands in many sectors, e.g.
    irrigation, urban water use and energy generation and an expanding need for food
    and fibre production (Strzepek and Boehlert, 2010). Meanwhile, climate change
    is also likely to intensify water shortages, with many arid agricultural regions
    expecting to experience decreasing and less stable water supply in the future
    (Elnashar and Elyamany, 2023, Christensen et al., 2007, Gaydon et al., 2012, Rijsberman,
    2006). Therefore, continued development of effective irrigation strategies to
    reduce water waste is important for securing a sustainable future for irrigated
    agriculture (Chen et al., 2020). With the process of farm modernisation and implementation
    of advanced irrigation infrastructure, increasing volumes of on-farm data are
    becoming available, giving new opportunities to precisely measure irrigation water
    use at field-to-farm scales and to identify areas of improvement. The combination
    of the increasing on-farm data together with remotely sensed imagery further boosts
    the capacity to assess the performance of individual farms across large spatial
    areas. Irrigation performance on individual farms can be represented by indicators
    that represent the adequacy, equity, reliability, productivity and sustainability
    of irrigation (Bastiaanssen and Bos, 1999). For example, farm-level seasonal irrigation
    water usage, calculated by dividing the seasonal irrigation volume by cropping
    area (ML/ha or mm), is a popular performance indicator (Malano and Burton, 2001).
    The seasonal irrigation water usage not only reflects farm investments in water
    purchases but also provides information on the potential for crop stress that
    could affect yields and production quality. Seasonal irrigation water usage is
    often highly variable across time and space (Gibson et al., 2018, Grassini et
    al., 2014), which has been attributed to complex factors such as farmer’s decisions,
    climate and soil. Therefore, understanding the variation in seasonal irrigation
    water usage is important to explain high water use on some farms and provide practical
    insights for saving water on these farms. One practical way to understand the
    variation in seasonal irrigation water usage is to explore key driving factors
    for the variation. In the irrigation domain, various existing studies have attempted
    to explore the key factors of irrigation water consumption and water productivity
    (Chen et al., 2020, Gibson et al., 2018, Grassini et al., 2014, Monaco and Sali,
    2018). For example, Grassini et al. (2014) investigated the major factors driving
    yield and irrigation amount across 1000 soybean fields in the USA using Pearson
    correlation analysis. They concluded that rainfall and reference evapotranspiration
    are key factors affecting the interannual variability of irrigation amount. Gibson
    et al. (2018) used analysis of variance to identify key drivers of field-level
    irrigation amounts over 12,750 soybeans and maize observations across 9 years
    in the USA. They found that half of the variation in field-level irrigation usage
    can be explained by seasonal water deficit, plant available water holding capacity
    of soils and crop type. Existing papers that explored drivers of irrigation performance
    mainly dealt with biophysical factors such as climate and soil, with only a few
    of them considering management factors such as farmers’ irrigation decisions.
    Specifically, the effects of management factors such as crop types, sowing dates,
    and irrigation methods (e.g. flooding irrigation) have been explored in some studies
    e.g. Monaco and Sali (2018), but factors describing irrigation duration, frequency
    and intensity have been rarely considered. This could be related to the difficulty
    in obtaining on-farm irrigation management data. Nevertheless, irrigation management
    factors can represent the unique irrigation practices on each farm, and may better
    explain the farm-level seasonal irrigation water usage. More importantly, these
    irrigation factors are more easily adjusted compared with natural factors like
    soil or climate. If we understand how these irrigation management factors affect
    water use, we can provide farmers suggestions on how to adjust irrigation practices
    targeting irrigation water saving. A considerable number of methods have been
    used to explore drivers of irrigation water use, including linear regression analysis
    (Gibson et al., 2018, Monaco and Sali, 2018), principal component analysis (PCA)
    (Chen et al., 2020), factor decomposition models (Zou et al., 2018) and boosted
    regression trees (Lamb et al., 2021). Nevertheless, the dominant methods rely
    on relatively simple mathematical models, which can limit model’s capacity in
    searching large numbers of key predictors of irrigation water usage. Multivariate
    linear regression is the most widely used method. It fits linear models relating
    irrigation performance indicators (i.e. the model predictand) to explanatory variables
    (predictors) (Chen et al., 2020, Monaco and Sali, 2018). The effects of predictors
    on the model predictand are informed by model coefficients, for which the magnitudes
    indicate the contributions of predictors, and the signs suggest whether the influence
    is positive or negative. Despite being a simple and effective method, the ability
    of a single multivariate regression is still limited in exploring extensive drivers
    of seasonal irrigation usage estimated from multiple crops, years and farms in
    a robust manner for several reasons. Firstly, if there are a large number of predictor
    candidates that could potentially influence irrigation usage, including all predictors
    in a multivariate regression can lead to overfitting. Solving this issue often
    requires an extra step to reduce the number of predictors prior to model fitting,
    using methods like principal component analysis (PCA) or stepwise regression analysis
    (Chen et al., 2020, Jia et al., 2016). Secondly, using a multivariate linear regression
    means the adoption of a fixed model structure, which cannot account for model
    uncertainty arising from the choice of the predictor variables. The lack of uncertainty
    insights in model structure may affect the robustness of decisions drawn from
    modelling results (Liu et al., 2021). Thirdly, it is also important that the developed
    model can identify crop-specific key predictors. Key predictors for irrigation
    water use can vary substantially between different crops due to their unique biophysical
    characteristics and irrigation practices. Given the discussion above, we aim to
    find a method that can 1) allow the investigation of a large number of potential
    key factors for irrigation usage while avoiding overfitting, 2) have the flexibility
    to explore different combinations of key factors and provide uncertainty information
    on their inclusion in the model, and 3) identify potentially different sets of
    key factors for different crops. A Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) is an ideal
    candidate to fulfil these requirements because of its effectiveness of representing
    complex spatial-temporal datasets with hierarchical structures, allowing model
    coefficients to vary amongst different data groups (Clark, 2005). BHM can also
    be integrated into a multi-model framework to allow flexibility in model structures
    amongst data groups, e.g. by adding an inclusion parameter for each predictor
    to control its presence or absence in each sub-model (O''Hara and Sillanpää, 2009).
    This can avoid overfitting and allow different subsets of predictors to be explored.
    The fitting process for a BHM gives non-parametric distributions for model coefficients
    and parameter inclusion factors through the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fitting
    method, so uncertainty insights can be easily extracted (e.g. the uncertainty
    of predictor effects and model structures). In addition, each data point of the
    predictand can be allocated to a specific sub-model based on its group (e.g. crop
    type), allowing different key predictors to be selected for each group. BHMs have
    been used in explaining the spatial and temporal variability in hydrological indices
    such as water quality parameters (Guo et al., 2020, Guo et al., 2022, Liu et al.,
    2021), streamflow trends (Gao et al., 2022) and flood frequency (Lima and Lall,
    2010), but they have not yet been applied for irrigation performance analysis.
    This study aims to use data-driven models to explain seasonal irrigation water
    usage with a comprehensive set of predictors including hydro-climatic and geographic
    features of the farm and on-farm management factors. Our study provides insights
    into addressing the challenge of irrigation water shortage under changing climate
    (Elnashar and Elyamany, 2023). Specifically, this study offers a practical example
    of how to understand factors driving irrigation efficiency by making use of increasing
    on-farm datasets and sophisticated statistical models. Factors related to irrigation
    management practices were explored, which is generally lacking in existing studies
    (Gibson et al., 2018). These irrigation management factors are also adjustable
    (compared to climate and soil factors) to reach better irrigation performance.
    We developed a BHM that can 1) identify key predictors for the farm-level seasonal
    water usage from a large number of candidate predictors representing climate,
    soil, water allocation and irrigation management, and 2) estimate farm-level seasonal
    irrigation usage across an irrigation district and multiple years using key predictors.
    The study was conducted in the Coleambally Irrigation Area in south-eastern Australia.
    The resulting model helps explain the underlying reasons for high irrigation usage
    and provides insights into how to mitigate water waste, thereby informing more
    efficient and sustainable irrigation. 2. Study area The study was conducted in
    the Coleambally Irrigation Area (CIA), which is a major irrigation district located
    in south-eastern Australia, from 2011 to 2019 (Fig. 1). The district services
    nearly 500 agricultural farms with an average farm size of 220 ha (CICL, 2021),
    and the distribution system is owned and operated by Coleambally Irrigation Cooperative
    Limited (CICL). The CIA sits in the semi-arid climate zone, with hot and dry summers
    and cool and wet winters. The long-term annual average rainfall is 436.7 mm, and
    the long-term annual average maximum and minimum temperature are 23.8 and 9.9
    °C, respectively (data were obtained from the Narrandera Airport weather station
    nearby (Bureau of Meteorology, 2022)). Summer is the main irrigation season in
    the CIA and the main summer crops are corn/maize, cotton and rice (CICL, 2021).
    The general start dates for corn/maize, cotton and rice are within October–November
    and most crops end in March–May. Maize/corn tends to end 1–2 months earlier than
    cotton. Surface irrigation water is delivered from the nearby Murrumbidgee River
    to farms through open channels. The timing and amount of water delivered for each
    irrigation event are based on the farmer’s request via a water ordering platform.
    The delivered volume to each farm is recorded continuously by the automated irrigation
    gate at the farm supply point. Download : Download high-res image (447KB) Download

    cotton and rice, respectively, in the CIA taken during two field trips in March
    2020 and March 2021. 3. Materials and methods The study started with selecting
    farms in the CIA across 2011–2019, which led to 1099 crop-farm-year samples (see
    sample selection criteria in Section 3.1). During this period, the delivery system
    in the CIA is automatic. For all samples, we calculated the accumulated farm-level
    irrigation water usage in the summer cropping season (hereafter refer as seasonal
    irrigation water usage) as the model predictand using farm irrigation delivery
    records (Section 3.2). We also extracted data for a large number of relevant explanatory
    variables from multiple data sources (Section 3.3). A Bayesian hierarchical model
    (BHM) was developed to select and quantify the effect of key predictors that explain
    the seasonal irrigation water usage for the data set (Section 3.4). The model
    resulted in 1) three sets of key predictors and associated model coefficients
    for farms with each of corn/maize, cotton and rice, and 2) the predicted seasonal
    irrigation water usage for all samples. The latter were further compared with
    the actual seasonal irrigation water usage to evaluate model performance. Cross-validation
    was conducted to evaluate the robustness of selected key predictors and model
    performance. 3.1. Selecting crop-farm-year samples Our study focuses on farms
    that grew corn/maize, cotton and rice in the summer season from 2011 to 2019.
    Considering the potentially different irrigation usage patterns of different crop
    types, farms with mixed crop types may have less clear statistical power for understanding
    the key factors influencing irrigation usage. Thus, we only selected farms that
    grew a single type of summer crop in each particular summer (single-crop farms,
    following Gao et al., 2023). Since irrigation usage data are only available at
    the farm scale, focusing on single-crop farms helps to avoid the need to disaggregate
    the farm-level irrigation usage data to multiple crops, which could lead to unrepresentative
    estimates of usage for individual crop types. Furthermore, based on the annual
    groundwater extraction data provided by CICL, we selected farms that only used
    surface water for irrigation and excluded farms that have mixed use of groundwater
    and surface water. This is because groundwater usage is only being monitored annually
    in this area, and hence may include winter usage. Therefore, the mismatch in the
    temporal resolution of irrigation and groundwater usage makes it difficult to
    accurately estimate the true seasonal irrigation water usage. The number of farms
    for each crop in individual study years is summarised in Table 1. The total number
    of crop-farm-year samples is 1099. Table 1. The number of corn/maize, cotton and

    irrigation water usage Seasonal irrigation water usage (ML/ha) is an important
    indicator to describe irrigation performance at each farm. It directly measures
    how much irrigation water is used at the farm level, which is hypothesised to
    be closely related to crop, farm, climate, soil and management factors. The data
    to calculate the seasonal irrigation volume comes from records of surface irrigation
    delivery to farms, provided by CICL and an irrigation infrastructure supplier,
    Rubicon Water. Seasonal irrigation water volumes (ML) were first calculated for
    all crop-farm-year samples, and then converted into irrigation usage (depth) (ML/ha)
    by dividing by the cropping area on a farm. The cropping areas for corn/maize,
    cotton and rice at individual farms were estimated by Gao et al. (2023) based
    on remotely sensed crop areas for each season. The temporal and spatial variation
    in the seasonal irrigation water usage for all 1099 samples are shown in Fig.

    Fig. 2. The temporal and spatial variation of farm-level seasonal irrigation usage
    (ML/ha) for all crop-farm year samples. Each panel corresponds to one crop and
    each boxplot represents the variation in seasonal irrigation usage between all
    farms that grow the specific crop in a particular year. The red text underneath
    each boxplot shows the corresponding number of observations. Our Bayesian Hierarchical
    Model adopts a multi-variate linear regression to predict water usage from its
    potential key driving factors (detailed in Section 3.4.1). We applied data transformation
    for the model predictand to improve data structure to facilitate model fitting
    and fulfil the assumptions of the statistical model used (Osborne, 2010). Data
    skewness will often be reduced to close to zero after applying transformation,
    which helps normalise errors in regression analyses (see Section 3.4 for model
    details). Many transformation methods have been adopted in the literature to transform
    hydrological variables, including Box-Cox transformation, Logarithm transformation
    and Log-sinh transformation (Huang et al., 2023, Sakia, 1992, Wang et al., 2012).
    In this study, a natural logarithm transformation was applied to the seasonal
    irrigation water usage to improve data symmetry. After transformation, the data
    were standardised to a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one (i.e. each
    data point is standardised by subtracting the sample mean from that point and
    then dividing the result by the sample’s standard deviation). The transformation
    and standardisation were applied for each crop type separately. Note that all
    model performance metrics used later are calculated in the log domain using the
    standardised data. 3.3. Predictor variables The farm-level seasonal irrigation
    water usage can be affected by different factors such as climate, soil characteristics,
    water availability, and on-farm irrigation practices. To identify key drivers
    of seasonal irrigation water usage, a range of explanatory variables (predictors)
    were extracted from multiple data sources, and were then related to seasonal water
    usage using a BHM. Table 2 provides detailed descriptions of all predictors and
    their data sources. Table 2. Predictor candidates for seasonal irrigation water

    Both monthly total water usage and monthly ETc were standardised by dividing the
    seasonal total water supply and seasonal ETc at each farm. ETc was calculated
    using the reference ET0 and crop coefficient Kc, following Allen et al. (1998)
    none Climate: Climate variables were extracted from the Australian Water Availability
    Project (AWAP), which is a gridded climate data at 5 km resolution covering the
    entire Australia (Raupach et al., 2009, Raupach et al., 2012). For each field,
    rainfall, growing degree days (GDD) and the reference crop evapotranspiration
    (ET0) were extracted or calculated at a daily step and then accumulated across
    the cropping season (1st October to 31st May). Daily GDD was calculated by subtracting
    a base temperature from the average of daily minimum and maximum temperatures.
    The base temperature was set at 10 ⁰C, synthesised from several relevant existing
    studies (e.g. Djaman and Irmak, 2013, Kukal and Irmak, 2018 and Liu et al., 2022).
    The ET0 was calculated using the standard Penman-Monteith Method provided by the
    FAO (Allen et al., 1998) (Eq. (1)). All climate variables were first calculated
    at the field level and then averaged to the farm level. (1) where is the reference
    crop evapotranspiration (mm/day), is the slope of vapour pressure (kPa/0C), is
    the net radiation at the surface of the crop (MJ/m2/day), G is the density of
    soil heat flux (MJ/m2/day), is the psychrometric constant (kPa/0C), is the saturation
    vapour pressure deficit (kPa) and is the wind speed at 2 m (m/s). Soil: Soil predictors
    were extracted from two data sources – the Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia
    (SLGA) (Rossel and Webster, 2012) which is a nationwide public dataset provided
    by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), and
    a surface soil type database of the CIA provided by CICL. The SLGA is a comprehensive
    gridded soil data set that provides a range of soil, water and nitrogen attributes
    at an approximately 90-m resolution over Australia. In this study, nine attributes
    that can potentially affect seasonal irrigation usage were extracted (Table 2).
    For each attribute, we extracted its value for the 0–5 cm, 5–15 cm, 15–30 cm,
    30–60 cm and 60–100 cm soil layers, respectively, for individual cropping fields,
    and calculated the depth weighted average of each attribute to represent the soil
    condition in the rooting zone. The field-level soil attributes were then averaged
    to the farm level. Meanwhile, we also extracted soil-type predictors from the
    soil-type database provided by CICL. According to this dataset, there are five
    basic soil types, namely red-brown earth (RBE), transitional red-brown earth (TRBE),
    self-mulching clay (SMC), non-self-mulching clay (NSMC) and sand (SAND) in the
    CIA. Four out of five soil types were selected as predictors (RBE, TRBE, SMC and
    SAND. NSMC is omitted to avoid redundancy as its percentage equals to 100% minus
    the percentages of the other four soil types). The percentage area coverage of
    each of these soil types at each farm was calculated, leading to four soil type
    predictors per farm (e.g. RBE = 15%, SAND = 10%, SMC = 0%, and TRBE = 65%). Irrigation
    patterns: A range of predictors that describe the unique irrigation pattern for
    each crop-farm-year sample were extracted from the irrigation delivery records
    (Section 3.2). The seasonal pattern of irrigation water usage is a reflection
    of irrigation practices at each farm, so including farm-specific irrigation predictors
    may help better explain the differences in seasonal irrigation water usage among
    samples (Gibson et al., 2018). A total of 12 predictors were calculated to characterise
    irrigation management. They capture different aspects of irrigation practices
    including the irrigation duration, frequency, and intensity, as well as the start
    and end dates of the irrigation period. Detailed definitions and calculations
    of these predictors are given in Table 2. Water allocation: The final water allocation
    in each year was extracted from NSW government records (Table 2). The water allocation
    is a percentage of the entitlement volume and is uniform across all farms and
    crops in a year. The entitlement is essentially the volume of water available
    to a farmer in a wet year. All predictors were normalised using the Box-Cox transformation,
    which has been widely used in regression analysis to improve data symmetry and
    facilitate model fitting (Guo et al., 2020, Liu et al., 2021). The Box-Cox transformation
    was applied using the R package “car”. After the Box-Cox transformation, all predictors
    were standardised to a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. The standardisation
    puts all predictors on the same scale, which simplifies the comparison of predictor
    effects on seasonal irrigation water usage. The distributions of raw predictor
    values and transformed predictor values are provided in Fig. S1 and Fig. S2 in
    the supplementary information. Pearson cross-correlations were calculated for
    all predictors (Fig. S3). Some predictors are naturally interrelated, resulting
    in a relatively high correlation (e.g. total phosphorus in the soil (PTO) and
    total carbon organic in the soil (SOC) show a 0.73 correlation, Fig. S3). Nevertheless,
    they represent different characteristics and their individual effects on model
    predictand should not be neglected (Nakagawa and Freckleton, 2011). Hence, all
    predictor candidates were retained for further analysis with an awareness of potential
    compensation effects between predictors. 3.4. Bayesian hierarchical modelling
    (BHM) 3.4.1. Modelling framework A BHM was designed to explore the effects of
    the various predictors, thereby determining which predictors are closely related
    to seasonal irrigation water usage. BHMs are known for their ability to represent
    spatial-temporal datasets (e.g. samples from different farms, years and crops)
    with a hierarchical structure (Clark, 2005), which better suits our datasets and
    objectives. In such a case, the model enables information to be shared between
    different crop types, which strengthens the statistical power, while still allowing
    specific predictors to be selected by crop type. In addition, we designed a BHM
    that incorporates flexible presence or absence of each predictor (O''Hara and
    Sillanpää, 2009). This means we considered the uncertainty of model structure
    (i.e. different subsets of predictors) when selecting the key predictors and thus
    reduced the chance of model overfitting. This is the so-called Bayesian model
    averaging concept, which can avoid over-confidence of one model structure (Liu
    et al., 2022). In contrast, a simple non-hierarchical model is not practical for
    our datasets: it may not fit the data well with a small number of parameters,
    or it can overfit the data with many parameters (Gelman et al., 2013). A conceptual
    diagram of the BHM is shown in Fig. 3. The model includes two components – a multivariate
    regression which indicates the combined effect of predictors (denoted as ), and
    an error term which varies by crop type (denoted as ε). The reason for having
    a crop-specific error term is due to the substantial difference in seasonal irrigation
    water usage between rice and corn/maize or cotton i.e. rice requires much more
    water than corn/maize or cotton (Fig. 2). In this case, an error term helps to
    explain the systematic difference in model predictand based on crops. The modelling
    framework is hierarchical, which allows crop types to be imported to encourage
    the search for crop-specific key predictors. The mix of samples across crops,
    years and farms provides more observations for model fitting, which improves model
    robustness. Download : Download high-res image (229KB) Download : Download full-size

    framework of the BHM is presented in (2), (3), (4), (5). In Eq. (2), the seasonal
    irrigation usage at sample i and crop ( , = 1, 2, 3, for corn/maize, cotton and
    rice, and = 1, 2, … 1099 observations), is drawn from a normal distribution (denoted
    as ) with a mean of and a standard deviation of . is drawn from the same distribution
    across different crops. (2) , which is the simulated seasonal irrigation water
    usage for sample i and crop , is modelled using all predictors ( =1, 2, …, N = 29
    for 29 predictors, e.g. ACCUM_RAIN, ACCUM_GDD, etc.), together with a crop-specific
    error term, , using a multivariate regression model (Eq. (3)). The term indicates
    the combined effect of predictors weighted by their corresponding crop-specific
    coefficients , i.e. each th predictor has different coefficients ( = 3 in this
    study for three crop types). is a latent variable that includes an “inclusion
    factor”, , to indicate whether the predictor is contributing to the , together
    with a regression coefficient (Eq. (4)). In other words, the actual effect of
    a predictor on the model predictand , is either (  or 0 ( . The crop-specific
    error term represents any systematic difference, which explains the systematic
    difference in the seasonal irrigation usage from different crop types. Each is
    drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of and a standard deviation (Eq.
    (5)). (3) (4) (5) 3.4.2. Model implementation The BHM was fitted using data for
    each crop type (Section 3.1), farm-level seasonal irrigation water usage (Section
    3.2) and the explanatory variables (Section 3.3), for all crop-farm-year samples.
    The BHM was implemented in the “rstan” R package, which uses Markov chain Monte
    Carlo (MCMC) to update model variables and parameters from non-informative prior
    distributions to posterior distributions. Minimally informative prior distributions
    of (i.e. the second argument is the standard deviation in “rstan”, not the variance)
    were used for the global standard deviation σ and the hyperparameter , with values
    truncated to be positive only (is a half-normal distribution). Prior distributions
    of were also assign to all predictor coefficients and the hyperparameter . Since
    all predictors and the model predictands were standardised, a prior distribution
    of is considered sufficiently wide. The inclusion factor was initially drawn from
    a uniform distribution of and then converted into an integer (0 or 1) using the
    “round” function in “rstan”. This gives an almost equal probability of being either
    0 and 1 in the prior distribution, as the “round” function turns values below
    or equal to 0.5 into 0 and otherwise 1. The inclusion of 29 predictor candidates
    and the use of inclusion factors lead to approximately 5.37 × different model
    structures (i.e. different subsets of predictors). As such, many iterations and
    a sufficient warm-up period are important to ensure model convergence and the
    robustness of modelling results. To calibrate the model in “rstan”, we used 4
    independent chains and 1 million iterations per chain, with the first 500,000
    iterations being used for warm-up only and thus being discarded. A thinning factor
    (thin = 50) was also used to avoid the model results exceeding computational memory,
    leading to 40,000 posterior samples for model evaluation and analysis. The calibration
    process took 13 h using 4 CPUs on the University of Melbourne''s high-performance
    computing (HPC) system, Spartan. 3.4.3. Bayesian model averaging (BMA) and model
    performance evaluation We used Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to obtain the simulated
    seasonal irrigation water usage at each crop-farm-year sample; that is the average
    value of the 40,000 posterior values. In this way, the model predictand takes
    results from multiple model structures into account, and model structures that
    appear more often in the 40,000 posterior samples contribute more to the predictand
    (see Section 3.5.2 for more detailed explanations). The simulated seasonal irrigation
    water usage was then compared with the actual measurements to evaluate the model
    performance, using the Pearson’s correlation (r), the root mean squared error
    (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), and the coefficient of determination (R2).
    These performance metrics are widely used in evaluating models for predicting
    irrigation water use or requirement (Damtie et al., 2022, Peña-Arancibia et al.,
    2016, Popova and Pereira, 2011). The 50% and 90% credible intervals were also
    calculated for each from its posterior distribution. One important assumption
    of regression models is that model residuals should be independent and normally
    distributed. To check this assumption, we first plotted the simulated model predictands
    against model residuals to visualise the residual pattern. A good model fitting
    will yield a random scatter of residuals around the x-axis, while any systematic
    pattern or trend in residual points could indicate unreliable model fitting. A
    distribution plot was also used to visualise the normality of residuals. Following
    that, a quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot was used, in which the data is considered
    normal if all the data points align along a straight diagonal line. Finally, residuals
    were plotted against each explanatory predictor (e.g. ACCUM_RAIN, ACCUM_GDD, etc.)
    for heteroscedasticity check (i.e. the relationship between predictors and the
    variance of the residuals). No patterns or trends in the heteroscedasticity check
    indicates model statistical assumptions are met. 3.4.4. Model validation Cross-validation
    was conducted to evaluate the reliability of selected key predictors and the robustness
    of model performance. The validation starts with randomly splitting the total
    1099 samples into 80% and 20% sample subsets. The 80% of samples were used to
    re-calibrate a BHM, from which key predictors and model training performance (r,
    RMSE, MAE and R2) were summarised. The remaining 20% of samples (unseen samples)
    were used to validate model performance using the same accuracy metrics. All other
    settings in BHM implementation were kept unchanged. This validation process was
    repeated ten times to cover the uncertainty in validation results sourced from
    random sample selection. 3.5. Model results and interpretation 3.5.1. Posterior
    Inclusion Probability (PIP) of predictors The use of inclusion factors in the
    BHM shed the light on how often each predictor occurs in the 40,000 posterior
    samples. This information was used to determine the importance of each predictor
    candidate and select key predictors. The posterior inclusion probability (PIP),
    which estimates the frequency of occurrence of each predictor in the final model
    ( ), was calculated for each predictor candidate by finding the proportion of
    the posterior samples for which = 1. An arbitrary threshold of 0.7 was used to
    select key predictors, meaning that a predictor with PIP > 0.7 was selected as
    a key driving factor of seasonal irrigation water usage. 3.5.2. Posterior Model
    Probability (PMP) The use of inclusion factors leads to different subsets of predictors
    being chosen for each crop type in the final 40,000 samples. Each subset of predictors
    represents a certain model structure, which can be denoted as ( = 1, 2, … , is
    the total number of unique subsets of predictors (model structures), and is the
    crop type). The probability of each in the final samplings is called the posterior
    model probability (PMP, denoted as ), indicating how frequently a certain model
    structure being chosen for model prediction. In this study, the was calculated
    using the frequency of occurrence of a certain pattern of in the final samples.
    To understand the key model structures contributing to the final prediction, we
    extracted models with PMP ranking in the top 50. We then analysed the predictors
    selected and their effects on seasonal irrigation water usage. The predictor effects
    were estimated by averaging across the posterior distributions of predictor coefficients.
    4. Results 4.1. Key predictors influencing seasonal irrigation water usage The
    posterior inclusion probabilities (PIPs) of all candidate predictors for three
    crops are shown in Fig. 4. A higher PIP indicates a more frequent occurrence of
    the predictor in the final posterior samples and that this predictor is more important.
    An arbitrary threshold of PIP = 0.7 is shown in each panel to separate important
    and unimportant predictors. Clearly, irrigation and soil predictors showed higher
    PIPs compared with climate and water allocation predictors across all three crops,
    indicating their dominant roles in driving seasonal irrigation water usage. Nevertheless,
    different crops favoured different subsets of irrigation and soil predictors,
    with only one predictor overlapping all crop types (NUM_IRR_DAYS, PIP = 1). For
    example, BDW and SMC were important for corn/maize but not for cotton and rice.
    Instead, for cotton and rice, SAND and NTO were the key drivers, respectively.
    In addition to NUM_IRR_DAYS, IRR_PERIOD and IRR_ACCUM_NOV were important irrigation
    predictors for cotton and corn/maize (PIP = 1 for both), respectively. The only
    climate predictor selected was ACCUM_RAIN, which showed moderate importance (PIP
    = 0.77) for cotton farms (see Table 2 for definitions of predictors). The PIPs
    in the cross-validation for three crops are shown in Fig. S4 in the supplementary
    information. The key predictors selected are similar to those in Fig. 4 (when
    the model was trained using all samples). Nevertheless, ACCUM_RAIN and IRR_PERIOD
    became less important and were no longer key predictors for cotton if using the
    threshold PIP = 0.7. Download : Download high-res image (302KB) Download : Download

    The red dashed in each panel shows PIP = 0.7. Predictors are sorted in ascending
    order based on PIPs for corn/maize. See Table 2 for a detailed definition of each
    predictor. The posterior density estimates, mean values and 90% credible intervals
    (CI) of key coefficients (PIP > 0.7) for three crops are presented in Fig. 5,
    using a half-eye plot (Kay, 2022). A half-eye plot visualises both the statistical
    summaries and the shapes of distributions of the key predictor coefficients in
    the posterior samples. The dashed line in each panel shows where the coefficient
    equals zero, which helps with interpreting the sign of the influence of each predictor
    on seasonal irrigation water usage. Take corn/maize as an example, SMC had a negative
    effect on the seasonal irrigation water usage on corn/maize farms, while NUM_IRR_DAYS,
    IRR_ACCUMU_NOV and BDW all showed positive effects. Detailed discussions of predictor
    effects are presented in Section 5.1. In addition, none of the 90% CI crossed
    the zero dashed line, indicating that the signs of predictor effects on the model
    predictand were quite certain (i.e. either positive or negative). The density
    plots and CIs for rice predictor coefficients were narrower compared with those
    for corn/maize and cotton, which is attributed to the large number of rice samples
    used for model calibration (Table 1). Download : Download high-res image (157KB)

    where the coefficient = 0 (no effect). For detailed definitions and calculations

    model probability (PMP) The performance of the Bayesian hierarchical averaging
    model is shown in Fig. 6A, with residual checks shown in Figs. 6B–6D. The model
    performance was reasonably accurate, with r = 0.81, RMSE = 0.58, MAE = 0.44 and
    R2 = 0.66 for seasonal irrigation water usage after natural logarithm and standardisation.
    The residual check further confirmed the model’s robustness, showing that residuals
    were randomly distributed against simulated seasonal irrigation water usage (Fig.
    6B) and approximately normally distributed (Figs. 6C and 6D). The residuals were
    also plotted against each predictor in Fig. S5 in the supplementary information,

    in the cross-validation are shown in Fig. 7. Overall, there was only a small difference
    between calibration and validation accuracy, indicating that the model is relatively
    robust. Despite being slightly worse than the calibration accuracy, the model
    validation accuracy still reaches, on average, RMSE of 0.61, R2 of 0.62, MAE of

    Models are sorted in descending order of PMP from left to right. Predictors selected
    for each model structure (each column) are coloured in either red (negative effects)
    or blue (positive effects). Clearly, there were dominant model structures in the
    posterior samples; for example, the top model structure in each of the three crops
    accounted for approximately 30% or more (i.e. the width of the first column) of
    the final model prediction. The top model for three crops included all the key
    predictors selected based on PIPs (Fig. 5), as well as some other predictors (e.g.
    ECE for rice) that appeared to be less important in the remaining top 2–50 models
    (Fig. 8). This indicates that the key predictors selected in this study took multiple
    model structures into account but were dominated by frequently-occurring model
    structures. In addition, the effects of individual predictors were consistent
    (i.e. all red (-ve) or blue (+ve)) across the different model structures for nearly

    seasonal irrigation water usage Irrigation and soil predictors were found to be
    more important in controlling seasonal irrigation water usage for all three crops.
    Nevertheless, specific key predictors selected for individual crops were different.
    The following sections discuss the key predictors for corn/maize, cotton and rice
    and the underlying reasons for these predictors being selected. 5.1.1. Irrigation
    predictors The only common predictor found for all three crops is NUM_IRR_DAYS,
    which represents the number of days irrigation was applied in a season. This predictor
    is found to be very important in driving seasonal irrigation water usage for all
    three crops, evidenced by its highest PIPs (PIP = 1 for three crops) and its large
    coefficient magnitudes (Fig. 4, Fig. 5 and Fig. S4). The positive coefficient
    for this predictor indicates that more irrigation applications in a season lead
    to higher seasonal irrigation usage. Hence, for farms with higher-than-average
    seasonal irrigation water usage, we suggest evaluating their irrigation scheduling
    and testing the possibility of reducing the number of irrigations (or the amount
    of applied water) to better match variations in crop water demand across the season.
    It is also possible that these farms have inefficient water applications and thus
    need to irrigate more; hence, examining irrigation methods on these farms would
    also be advisable. The suggested reduction in irrigation frequency should also
    be carefully monitored to avoid damage to crop health and yield through high water
    stress. IRR_ACCUM_NOV is another irrigation predictor selected for corn/maize,
    and its importance was consistently evident in models calibrated using all samples
    (Fig. 4) or subsets of samples (Fig. S4). IRR_ACCUM_NOV was calculated by dividing
    the accumulated irrigation amount up to November into the seasonal irrigation
    amount in a farm, which represents the early-season irrigation intensity. The
    positive effect of IRR_ACCUM_NOV means that corn/maize farms with more intense
    irrigation in the early season use more water for the whole season. One key contributor
    to IRR_ACCUM_NOV is the first irrigation (also known as pre-season irrigation),
    which is normally the largest irrigation event across the season (Musick and Lamm,
    1990). In arid and semi-arid areas, the first irrigation is often used to wet
    the soil to encourage germination and plant establishment. Hence, corn/maize farms
    should pay attention to water use in the early season, especially for the first
    irrigation. Maintaining early-season soil moisture (e.g. by using previous-season
    crop residues to retain soil moisture), thus reducing the water requirement for
    soil wetting, may be a valuable strategy. IRR_PERIOD is another key predictor
    selected for cotton (PIP approximately equal to one, Fig. 4), although it became
    less important when the model was calibrated using subsets of samples (Fig. S4).
    IRR_PERIOD is the number of days between the first date and the last date of irrigation.
    The positive effect of IRR_PERIOD indicates a potential chance to save seasonal
    water consumption by shortening the irrigation period. Interestingly, IRR_PERIOD
    showed a higher correlation with the end date of irrigation (E_IRR_DATE, correlation
    = 0.8) than the start date of irrigation (S_IRR_DATE, correlation = −0.43). This
    implies that IRR_PERIOD can act as a proxy of the end date of irrigation, which
    means that a farm that stops irrigation earlier uses less seasonal irrigation
    water. On one hand, the selection of IRR_PERIOD may reflect real differences in
    crop maturity (although growing degree days were not important), which thus leads
    to different irrigation periods and water use. On the other hand, it may suggest
    that some farms manage to extract more of the stored soil water following the
    last irrigation than others and are thus more efficient in terms of water use.
    Nevertheless, late-season irrigation is often considered influential to yield
    (Schaefer et al., 2018), and deciding when to stop irrigation is case-dependent
    and requires local validation. Hence, we suggest future studies to adapt experiments
    from existing studies to investigate the earliest time to terminate irrigation
    safely in the CIA (Ale et al., 2020, Vories et al., 2011). For example, Ale et
    al. (2020) designed experiments to evaluate the influence of eight irrigation
    termination dates on irrigation water use efficiency (i.e. the ratio of yield
    to irrigation water supply) for cotton. The terminated dates were set at a weekly
    interval and the experiments were conducted for dry, normal and wet years, respectively.
    Such experiments could be transferred to the CIA to answer whether shortening
    the irrigation period is feasible, as scarifying yield for saving water is not
    practical for the sustainable development of irrigation agriculture. 5.1.2. Soil
    predictors SMC and BDW were two key soil predictors selected for corn/maize (Fig.
    4 and Fig. S4). SMC is the percentage of self-mulching clay on the ground surface,
    and higher SMC means that surface soil is more clayey. BDW is the weighted average
    of the bulk density in the 0–100 cm layers of the soil profile. In general, sandy
    soil has higher bulk density than clayey soil (McKenzie et al., 2004). SMC and
    BDW were derived from different soil databases (Table 2). The former describes
    surface soil conditions which may impact soil evaporation, while the latter describes
    the upper 1-m of the soil. Nevertheless, the coefficients of SMC and BDW jointly
    convey a consistent message regarding their effects – soil that has higher clay
    content on the ground surface and rooting zone (i.e. reflected by lower BDW) leads
    to less consumption of irrigation water (Fig. 5). This makes intuitive sense,
    as clayey soil has a higher water holding capacity and also tends to have low
    conductivity layers at depth that likely reduce percolation. Another soil predictor
    SAND, which represents the percentage of sand content in the surface layer, was
    selected for cotton (Fig. 4 and Fig. S4). The positive effect of SAND means that
    higher sand content (and hence lower silt and clay content) on the surface results
    in large seasonal irrigation water usage (Fig. 5). This may be due to the lower
    water holding capacity of sandy soil, leading to greater drainage during irrigation
    and thus larger water loss to percolation. The soil predictor NTO, which represents
    the weighted average of the total mass of nitrogen in the 0–100 cm soil layer,
    emerged as a key driver which negatively affected seasonal irrigation water usage
    of rice (Fig. 4, Fig. 5 and Fig. S4). This predictor was found to be important
    in both full-sample and sub-sample calibration, but the results from our statistical
    model are limited in explaining the physical mechanisms behind the relationship
    between NTO and seasonal irrigation water usage. Existing studies have highlighted
    that NTO can be associated with the growth of the rooting system and root morphology
    (Drescher et al., 2020), which may subsequently affect the way that crops extract
    water. A higher NTO may facilitate the growth of roots, which helps plants to
    extract water from deeper layers and thus could reduce the requirement for surface
    irrigation by reducing drainage loss and allowing somewhat less frequent irrigation
    which would also reduce bare soil evaporation at the seasonal time scale. This
    explanation is not applicable to rice, given that rice is grown in flooded paddy
    conditions for most of the season with no constraints in water provision. Another
    possible reason could be that NTO is a proxy of soil type. Soils with lower drainage
    potential may have higher NTO, so higher NTO means the soil has a better capability
    in retaining water, and thus crops grown on the soil require less irrigation water
    usage. The explanation of this relationship warrants more future research. Since
    several soil texture properties are important predictors of seasonal irrigation
    water usage, farmers can use on-farm soil properties to select the most appropriate
    irrigation practices. For example, we found that farms with sandier soil tend
    to use more irrigation water, which can be due to the quick drainage and low water
    retention nature of sandier soils. In this case, farmers can consider adopting
    more efficient irrigation technique such as drip irrigation to control drainage
    and reduce water waste (Dukes and Scholberg, 2005). Other studies have proposed
    that adding water absorbing agents in sandy soil can improve soil moisture in
    the rooting zone and encourage water saving (Akhter et al., 2004, Patra et al.,
    2022). In summary, our studies demonstrate the relationship between different
    soil properties and seasonal irrigation water usage; based on these findings,
    famers can endeavour to understand more about the soil on their farms and consider
    taking different soil moisture retention strategies to save water. 5.1.3. Climate
    predictors ACCUM_RAIN was the only climate predictor found to be important in
    driving seasonal irrigation water usage for cotton farms, and its effect is not
    as strong as other driving factors for cotton (Fig. 4). Additionally, it became
    less important in the validation process when models were trained using subsets
    of samples (Fig. S4). ACCUM_RAIN is a temporal predictor which shows clear variation
    across years but marginal variation across space in this study. The low spatial
    variation in ACCUM_RAIN is due to both the spatial correlation of seasonal rainfall
    totals and the low weather station network density (meaning the interpolated rainfall
    data we used has low spatial variation). Higher ACCUM_RAIN reduces the irrigation
    water requirement over the season (Fig. 5). ACCUM_RAIN was only found to be important
    for cotton, which may be attributed to the difference in crop phenology and crop
    water requirement. Corn/maize is typically harvested 1–2 months earlier than cotton
    and rice (i.e. at the end of March in the CIA); hence, ACCUM_RAIN, which accumulates
    daily rainfall from October to May, may not accurately reflect the rainfall available
    to be utilised by corn/maize. The water consumption for rice is substantially
    higher than summer rainfall (Fig. 2), so it is reasonable that ACCUM_RAIN has
    a small contribution to the seasonal irrigation water usage for rice. ACCUM_RAIN
    is a temporal variable changing from year to year, and the negative relationship
    between ACCUM_RAIN and seasonal irrigation water usage indicates that cotton farmers
    can reduce water usage in wet years in response to rainfall. This suggests adopting
    year-specific irrigation strategies according to rainfall conditions in different
    summer seasons. Critical to this is being responsive to weather events, both rainfall
    and particularly hot weather, and risk-based tools to better use both more detailed
    observations and quantitative weather forecasts would be useful (Guo et al., 2023).
    Existing studies have shown that rainfall forecasting plays a role in irrigation
    scheduling and water saving. For example, Chen et al. (2021) used short-term rainfall
    forecast in irrigation scheduling to improve irrigation efficiency for paddy rice
    in a study area in China from 2012–2019. They found that compared to conventional
    irrigation, their new method (deep Q-learning (DON)), which incorporates 7-day
    rainfall forecasting, can save 23 mm irrigation water and 21 mm drainage on average
    without causing significant yield loss. Seasonal rainfall forecasting may also
    provide information for farmers to plan for irrigation trading or purchasing.
    For example, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) has designed a long-range
    forecast system to provide rainfall and temperature forecasts in the upcoming
    four months (Bureau of Meteorology, 2023). This information can inform farmers
    about irrigation scheduling during the growing season. Hence, future studies should
    explore how rainfall forecasting can inform farmers plan for their irrigation
    water use for the coming season more effectively while also avoiding stressing
    the crops. 5.1.4. Limitations of predictor selection We interpret the effects
    of predictors on seasonal irrigation water usage according to predictor coefficients
    in the BHM. Nevertheless, a statistical association between predictors and predictand
    does not necessarily mean causality, so the interpreted reasons above need to
    be adopted with caution for decision-making. In addition, the cross-correlations
    that exist between predictors may also affect predictor selection, as the effect
    of one predictor can be compensated by another through the correlation (Gao et
    al., 2022). Most effects of the key predictors identified are consistent with
    existing biophysical knowledge of the water usage of individual crop types (as
    discussed in 5.1.1 Irrigation predictors, 5.1.2 Soil predictors, 5.1.3 Climate
    predictors). Nevertheless, we also highlight some rather surprising relationship
    that a higher NTO for rice leads to decreasing irrigation water usage. On one
    hand, future studies are needed to explain why NTO can affect seasonal irrigation
    water usage. On the other hand, this relationship may have been identified due
    to data artifacts, as the NTO data comes from an Australian soil product, which
    is a modelling output and may be subject to modelling uncertainty. In addition,
    detailed investigation of nitrogen and water interactions is beyond the scope
    of this paper due to a lack of farm/field level nitrogen data. 5.2. Model performance
    and application The BHM developed in this study showed reasonably accurate performance
    in estimating season irrigation water usage (R2 = 0.66 and RMSE = 0.58 for seasonal
    irrigation usage after natural logarithm and standardisation) for full-sample
    calibration (Fig. 6), or R2 = 0.62 and RMSE = 0.61 for validation (Fig. 7)). The
    model accuracy is competitive to other models in existing studies that explored
    drivers of irrigation water use to develop predictive models (e.g. R2 = 0.54 in
    Gibson et al. (2018)). This might be attributed to the inclusion of a larger set
    of predictors and the advantage of the hierarchical modelling framework in sharing
    data across groups to enhance the statistical power. To the authors’ knowledge,
    this is the first study that relates a comprehensive set of irrigation predictors
    (12 in total, Table 2) to seasonal irrigation water usage. Some of these predictors
    were found to be very important (Fig. 4, Fig. 5 and Fig. S4). The hierarchical
    framework enables the model to be fitted on all crop-farm-year samples simultaneously
    while selecting different key predictors for individual crops. The larger sample
    in model fitting increases model robustness and the crop-specific predictors enable
    seasonal irrigation water usage to be better simulated. We also provided the model
    structures (predictor subsets) of the top 50 models. These 50 model structures
    contributed to more than 80% of the posterior model probability (Fig. 8, the cumulative
    PMPs exceed 80% for all three crops). The consistent directions of predictor coefficients
    between different model structures indicate the robustness of predictor effects
    on seasonal irrigation water usage. Most of the top 50 model structures have less
    than 5 predictors (Fig. 8), which reduces concerns about overfitting, given that
    more than 1000 samples were used for calibration. In short, the Bayesian hierarchical
    modelling approach used here is robust, accurate, and provides a good estimate
    of seasonal irrigation usage at the farm level in the CIA. The key irrigation
    predictors and their effects suggest ways in which farmers might adjust their
    irrigation management to save irrigation water usage. For example, farms that
    have high seasonal irrigation water usage could consider reducing the number of
    irrigation days (NUM_IRR_DAYS) by applying water less frequently or shortening
    the irrigation period (IRR_PERIOD) to see if they can reduce water usage without
    causing harm to crop yields (Section 5.1.1). The soil predictors help farmers
    understand the potential effects of soil on water usage, thereby helping them
    to better decide where to grow certain types of crops to improve irrigation efficiency.
    More detailed suggestions can be found in 5.1.1 Irrigation predictors, 5.1.2 Soil
    predictors, 5.1.3 Climate predictors. We agree that more performance indicators
    should be investigated to understand irrigation efficiency from different aspects,
    and our study is limited in exploring one indicator – the seasonal irrigation
    water usage. For example, different nitrogen and water management practices can
    result in different water productivity. Unfortunately, we don’t have crop yield
    data for the study area, which limits the analysis of water productivity (e.g.
    yield / seasonal irrigation water usage) and the interaction between nitrogen,
    water and crop production. However, the focus of this paper is to develop a modelling
    framework that can quantitatively explore key factors of any irrigation performance
    indicators. If yield data become available in the future, we can calculate a water
    productivity indicator and relate it with different predictors including nitrogen
    predictors using our developed modelling framework. We highlighted this potential
    opportunity in the conclusion section. 6. Conclusions Water shortage is likely
    to be intensified under climate change and with growing population; hence, improving
    water use efficiency is important for the sustainable future of irrigated agriculture.
    Better understanding the key drivers of irrigation water usage provides valuable
    insights into ways to improve irrigation water use. This study used a Bayesian
    hierarchical model averaging approach to predict seasonal irrigation water usage
    and to identify key driving factors determining seasonal irrigation water usage.
    It is based on 1099 samples containing the irrigation water usage for corn/maize,
    cotton and rice within a large irrigation district, collected over multiple years.
    Across all three crops, irrigation management and soil characteristics were identified
    as the key factors that explain the variation in seasonal irrigation water usage.
    Seasonal rainfall also moderately influenced irrigation water usage on cotton
    farms. Specifically, we found that 1) reducing irrigation days (irrigation frequency)
    is associated with lower seasonal irrigation water usage for all crops considered
    (corn/maize, cotton and rice); 2) lower irrigation intensity early in the season
    leads to lower seasonal irrigation water usage on corn/maize farms; 3) reducing
    the irrigation period (i.e. the number of days between the last and first dates
    of irrigation in the season), primarily by terminating irrigation earlier in a
    season, leads to lower seasonal irrigation water usage on cotton farms; 4) seasonal
    irrigation water usage is related to soil type. Clayier soil (or soil with a lower
    bulk density) leads to lower seasonal irrigation water usage compared to sandier
    soil; and 5) wetter summers lead to lower irrigation water use which we take as
    evidence that irrigators respond to the prevailing weather by adjusting irrigation
    scheduling. As the detail of weather observations and short-term rainfall forecasting
    improve, together with establishment of appropriate tools to facilitate their
    use, farmers are likely to be able to further improve irrigation efficiency. Apart
    from this, our Bayesian hierarchical model showed good performance in estimating
    seasonal irrigation water usage across all crop-farm-year data (R2 = 0.66 and
    RMSE = 0.58 for full-sample calibration and R2 = 0.62 and RMSE = 0.61 for validation
    predictions). The model demonstrates how to make use of large datasets and advanced
    data-driven modelling to understand the variation of irrigation performance between
    farms at a district level, which can potentially inform policy and decision-making
    targeting a more sustainable and effective irrigation system. The modelling framework
    developed is highly transferable to other studies, such as those considering water
    productivity indicators (e.g. Yield / water supply) and/or applying to other irrigation
    districts, which has broad implications to help improve irrigation performance
    in the future. Funding This study is part of a Linkage project (project no. LP170100710)

    strategies 1. Introduction To meet the demands of 9.1 billion global population
    the food production needs to be increased by 70 % from 2005 to 2050 which can
    be achieved through improved agronomic practices such as intensive tillage, fertilizers,
    improved crop protection practices, and energy-intensive inputs (Pratibha et al.,
    2015). These practices increased productivity but this increase is at the cost
    of increased energy input and green house gas (GHG) emissions by 30 % (Tubiello
    et al., 2014)., pollution of the cleaner environment, over exploitation of natural
    resources, land degradation, loss of biodiversity which pose threat to all the
    present and future generations (Rao et al., 2019). Moreover, this increase in
    productivity is a major challenge since it needs to be achieved from decreasing
    per-capita natural resources such as land, water, and minerals while reducing
    GHG emissions, energy input and resource degradation. Furthermore, there was increase
    in use of mechanization in all agricultural operations like land preparation,
    sowing, irrigation, fertilization, crop protection, weed management, harvesting
    and processing which resulted in increased use of electricity and diesel in farm
    operations. These practices increased productivity but at the cost of increased
    energy input, GHG emissions, pollution of the cleaner environment, over exploitation
    of natural resources, land degradation, loss of bio diversity, which pose threat
    to all the present and future generations. The important environmental concern
    in 21st century is global warming due to increase in greenhouse gasses (GHGs)
    concentration in the atmosphere. Of the total anthropogenic emissions 20 % GHGs
    emissions are from agriculture and associated land use changes (FAOSTAT, 2020).
    Hence reduction in GHG emissions is crucial and important issue to limit global
    warming and is the need of the hour since each country has set their own contribution
    to reduce the emissions in a particular time frame as per Paris agreement of COP
    26. India''s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the UNFCCC, pledges
    to reduce the emission intensity of its GDP by 33–35 % by 2030 compared to 2005
    levels (http://www.moef.nic.in/climate-change-docs-and-publications). Many countries
    have committed to deliver net-zero emissions by 2050 or earlier, for e.g., Australia
    by 2050, China by 2060 and India by 2070 (MOEFCC, 2021). Due to significant contributions
    of agricultural emissions to total national emissions, India has identified agriculture
    and allied sectors as a priority area for GHGs reduction in its NDC to the UNFCCC
    (Richards et al., 2016). But reduction in GHG emissions from agriculture under
    various production systems without reducing the productivity is one of the important
    challenges. Energy is a critical input in agriculture. In India, agriculture sector
    contributes to 4.2 % of India''s energy use, which is above the global average
    of 1.6 % (Pellegrini and Fernández, 2018), in spite of having relatively low energy
    use in crop production compared to other countries (Ghisellini et al., 2016).
    There is close interlinking between agriculture, energy and environment. Hence,
    the inter-dependence of energetics, GHG emissions, carbon foot print (CF) and
    crop production need to be evaluated for designing an energy and C- efficient
    cropping system (Kumar et al., 2019). Therefore, scientists and policymakers have
    diverted their attention towards identification of mitigation practices for cleaner
    agricultural production with low environmental impacts (GHG emissions, carbon
    and energy foot print) (Lal, 2004; Basavalingaiah et al., 2022). Globally, among
    different production systems rainfed agriculture occupies 80 % of the land and
    contributes to about 60 % to food production. The remaining 20 % of land under
    irrigated agriculture supports about 40 % of the food supply and contributes to
    food security in many developing countries (FAO, 2017). At present resource use
    efficiency both in rainfed and irrigated systems is much lower than the achievable
    potential at the global level (Gerten et al., 2020). Both systems have low productivity
    since rainfed systems have water scarcity. On the contrary, irrigated systems
    are subjected to indiscriminate use of available resources that lead to poor resource
    use efficiency (Anantha et al., 2021). India, the most populous and largest country
    in South Asia, is an agrarian country with over 157.3 M ha under cultivation and
    58 % of rural households depending primarily on agriculture. The intensively cultivated
    cropping system of the IGP plays a major role in the food security of south Asia,
    and is also a potential source of GHG emission, vulnerable to climate change as
    well (Gupta et al., 2016). Indian agriculture is characterized by cultivation
    of different crops (cereals, pulses, oil seeds, commercial crops), in different
    cropping seasons (rainy, post rainy and summer season) and different production
    systems (irrigated and rainfed). India being highly diverse in both crops and
    climate, quantification of carbon foot print, and energetics of different agro
    tech practices in different crops, production systems and stabilization of GHG
    emission is crucial to develop region specific suitable GHG mitigation technology
    (Gupta et al., 2015), and have sustainable food security (Rao et al., 2019). The
    available scientific information on carbon footprint (CF) of different crops and
    comparison between two production systems is scanty for designing and developing
    the strategies of sustainable production systems. Hence the present study was
    aimed. Therefore, designing of a highly productive, profitable and environmentally
    sustainable crop management practices, with lower GHGs emissions and energy input,
    is the need of the hour for a cleaner/safer environment (Babu et al., 2020). Estimation
    of CF in different cropping systems will be helpful in assessing the GHG emission
    due to crop production along with identification of low CF options to improve
    the sustainability of the cropping system (Mittal et al., 2018). For designing
    environmentally sound crop management practices under different production systems
    quantification of baseline emissions and identification of the major contributing
    sources to these emissions, is required. This can be achieved through studies
    on energy balance and CF. Based on the existing scientific options and their costs
    of implementation suitable mitigation strategies can then be developed. Therefore,
    it is essential to estimate the energy and carbon budgeting of different production
    systems (irrigated and rainfed). Based on the existing scientific options and
    their costs of implementation suitable mitigation strategies can then be developed.
    This knowledge can be beneficial to inform policy developments that are coherent
    with national food security, economic development and environmental sustainability
    goals (Whittaker et al., 2013). Therefore, it is essential to estimate the energy
    and carbon budgeting of different production systems (irrigated and rainfed).
    Though many studies have investigated energy balance and carbon balance to calculate
    energy efficiency and carbon efficiency but only few studies compared energetics
    and CF of different crops cultivated in irrigated vs rainfed production systems
    globally (Devakumar et al., 2018, Y. Zhang et al., 2018; G. Zhang et al., 2018).
    For developing cleaner and safer production systems, energetics and C budgeting
    must be assessed for diverse cropping systems in India. A good understanding of
    energy balance and GHG emissions from crop production systems will help to identify
    management practices for reducing the environmental footprints of energy, carbon
    and thereby in identifying sustainable and economical production system (Yousefi
    et al., 2016). Therefore, the present study was conducted with the main goal to
    identify best mitigation strategies to curtail the CF, GHG emissions, and enhance
    energy use efficiency, which could steer the policy makers in advocating climate
    neutral agricultural practices with higher productivity for cleaner production.
    The main objective of the study is to (1) assess the energy balance, GHG emissions
    and CF of different crops under both irrigated and rainfed production systems
    (2) To identify potential crop production strategies with high productivity and
    low environmental impact. The information from this study will help to identify
    the production practices with low energy and CF address significant knowledge
    gaps and furthermore, would help the decision-makers'' in achieving the climate–neutral
    agriculture system for clean production. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Source of
    data on different production systems and crops India has diverse agro ecological
    characteristics (climate and soil type variation) where irrigated and rainfed
    agriculture co-exist throughout the country. Due to this diverse climate and soil,
    different crops are cultivated in India under irrigated and rainfed conditions
    with different management practices. The data on crop production data were obtained
    from the household survey conducted by the Government of India (GoI) with multi-stage
    random sampling technique (http://eands.dacnet.nic.in). The first and second stage
    unit of sampling were districts within states, and villages within districts,
    with the household as basic unit of data collection (CSO, 2002). The districts
    were selected to cover the major crops grown in the country since it is the smallest
    administrative unit for which data is available. Of different information collected
    in this study, for the estimation of energy balance and CF field specific data
    on tillage, crop establishment and crop management including irrigation, fertilizer,
    residue management as well as grain and biomass yield were considered. The fertilizer
    input of different crops in different states under irrigated and rainfed crops
    was obtained from All India input survey by agriculture census division of Department
    of Agriculture and cooperation. Crop management practices of different crops which
    was not included in the GoI house- hold survey was collected from different other
    sources. For example the water management before and during cultivation of rice,
    was obtained from Bhatia et al. (2013), Sharma et al. (2018), the irrigation water
    requirement of different crops in different states was acquired from Sharma et
    al. (2018) and using expert judgement. The residues of different crops after harvest
    were used for various purposes (livestock feed, fuel wood, in-situ). The in -situ
    residues were burnt in the field in the intensively cultivated area for cultivation
    of the following crops. Information on residue management of different crops,
    as well as burning of residues, was acquired from Jain et al. (2014). The area
    of different crops in different states and union territories under irrigated and
    rainfed conditions were taken from, the Directorate of Economics and Statistics
    of GoI (India Stat website (http://www.indiastat.com) and FAOSTAT (FAOSTAT, 2018).
    In the present investigation the crops were selected based on the area under cultivation.
    Crops like pearl millet, chickpea, cotton, groundnut, maize, rice, sorghum, soybean,
    sugarcane and wheat grown in >5 Mha area in the entire country were considered
    for energy and CF analysis. Pigeonpea and castor were also considered even though
    they are cultivated in <5 Mha of area since they have high commercial value and
    contribute considerably to global production. The area under pearl millet, pigeonpea,
    sorghum and soybean were higher under rainfed conditions, whereas sugarcane and
    wheat were grown only under irrigated condition. The other crops were grown under
    both rainfed and irrigated conditions in different regions. To select the study
    area and farmers from regional level to village level, a stratified multi stage
    sampling technique was adopted. 2.2. Energy balance studies Energy balance studies
    were made to compare the energy use pattern and energy ratio of different crops
    grown under irrigated and rainfed systems. The energy input under different crop
    management practices is estimated by multiplying the inputs (fertilizer, irrigation,
    tillage, harvesting etc.) with corresponding energy coefficients and summing up
    of all the values obtained (Fig. 1). Energy coefficients used in the study were
    collected from published peer-reviewed literature (Parihar et al., 2018; Mittal
    and Dhawan, 1988). Energy input in different crops includes direct (Operational
    energy) and indirect energy (non-operational energy). The direct energy sources
    include diesel fuel, human labor, bullock labor, electricity and irrigation water,
    whereas the indirect energy sources include energy embodied in machinery, chemical
    fertilizers, insecticides, herbicides and seeds. Renewable energy input sources
    such as human labor, bullock labor and seeds, non-renewable energy sources like
    fossil fuel, fertilizer, machinery were considered. Whereas the renewable/built-in
    sources of energy (solar radiation, wind, inbuilt soil fertility) were not considered,
    since it has no opportunity cost (Chaudhary et al., 2017). There is a significant
    amount of animal and human labor used in developing nations thus energy use by
    human and animal labor were also considered Yuan and Peng (2017). The energy coefficients
    of human and animal labor correspond to potential biochemical energy consumption.
    The energy coefficients of the variables used in the study for determination of
    energy input (EI), Energy output (EO), energy use efficiency (EUE), Energy productivity
    (EP), specific energy (SE), Net Energy Return (NER), Nutrient EUE (NuEUE), Non-Renewable
    EUE (NR EUE), Energy profit, Eco Efficiency (EEI) methods are presented in Table

    image Fig. 1. Methodology for estimation of energy & carbon balance. 2.3. Carbon
    audit The spatial and yield scaled CF was assessed. The coefficients of different
    input and output used in the study are presented in Table S 2. The spatial carbon
    footprint (CFs) is the total set of GHG emissions (CO2, N2O and CH4) produced
    directly and indirectly in crop production expressed in carbon dioxide equivalent.
    CO2, N2O and CH4 were converted into CO2 equivalent by using global warming potential
    equivalent factors of 1, 298 and 28 for CO2, N2O and CH4 respectively (IPCC, 2013).
    The source of carbon input reported in this study includes CO2 emissions due to
    tillage, inter-cultivation, manufacture of chemical fertilizers (nitrogen fertilizers
    and phosphate fertilizers), pesticides, herbicides, direct and indirect N2O emissions,
    CH4 emission and emissions due to residue burning in the field for some crops
    where it is a general practice. Thus, the CF was calculated by considering the
    GHG flux input in above operations. It was estimated in terms of CO2 equivalent
    and the coefficients used were taken from previously published literature (Lal,
    2004; Dubey and Lal, 2009). The emissions coefficients for each individual pesticide
    and herbicide are unavailable, so we assumed that the emission during the processes
    of production, transportation, storage and field application are same for the
    pesticides within a class (Pratibha et al., 2019). Direct and indirect N2O emissions
    from the synthetic fertilizer were estimated by using Tier 2 of IPCC methodology
    (IPCC, 2007). The direct (emission factor) and indirect N2O emission (fraction
    of leaching and volatilization) factors are variable, uncertain and moreover they
    depend on oxygen status of the soil, amount of fertilizer, soil type and temperature
    (Anapalli et al., 2019). In spite of the variations in emission factors, the IPCC
    recommended use of a common default factors for these emissions. But in India
    some studies have reported a specific emission factor which is lower than IPCC
    default factor (Pratibha et al., 2015). The studies revealed that the direct (N2O
    emissions) and indirect emissions (nitrate leaching and volatilization of NH3
    and NOx) from synthetic N fertilizer application are considered as function of
    the annual precipitation and nitrogen application (Lemke et al., 2018). Hence
    in this study precipitation based calculations were adopted for estimation of
    direct and indirect emissions since the values were close to the observed soil
    N2O emissions (Aliyu et al., 2019). Further in these equations The N2O emissions
    were converted into CO2 equivalents (Eq. (1)) (1) where 44/28 is a coefficient
    converting N2O–N into N2O, 298 is the global warming potential. The IPCC recommended
    and modified emission factors applied in this study are given in Table S3. Methane
    (CH4) is produced and emitted during rice cultivation (Sander et al., 2018) and
    these methane emissions were influenced by the water management in rice. Hence
    different Emission factors were used to estimate CH4 emissions. Emission factors
    used for estimation of methane emissions from continuously flooded irrigated agroecosystem
    (162 kg CH4/ha) and flood-prone rainfed agroecosystem (190 kg CH4/ha) are based
    on INCCA report (INCCA, 2010). Emission factors for estimation of methane emissions
    from continuously flooded irrigated agroecosystem and flood-prone rainfed agroecosystem
    were used since it comprised 52.6 % and 32.4 %, respectively of the total rice
    cultivated area. Emission of CH4 and N2O from crop residue burning was calculated
    using the following equation (Biswas et al., 2017; INCCA, 2010). (2) where, EBCR
    is the emission from residue burning, A is the crop production, B is the residue
    to crop ratio, C is the dry matter fraction, D is the fraction burnt, E is the
    fraction actually oxidized, and F is the emission factor for CH4 and N2O. Ratio
    of residue to economic yield, fractions of residues burned in were taken from
    Biswas et al. (2017) and Junpen et al. (2018) for rice respectively. The data
    on fraction of residues oxidized and emission factors from residue burning were
    obtained from Kumar and Sharma (2017). The definition of the parameters used for
    computing carbon budgeting (Carbon Input (CI), Carbon Output (CO), Carbon Use
    Efficiency (CUE), Carbon footprint yield scale (CFy), Carbon Sustainability Index
    (CSI), Carbon Efficiency Ratio (CER), Green House Gas Intensity (GHGI) and EEI
    (CO2) are given in Table S1 (Fig. 1). 2.4. Economics All the incurred variable
    costs in a diverse cropping system was considered while working out the economics.
    The energy utilized for (human/machinery) land preparation, fertilizers, insecticides,
    irrigation, harvesting and thrashing were included as the major variable costs.
    The product of wage rate of GOI with man-day ha−1 was used for computing the labor
    cost. The total variable cost was the summation of all the input cost. The product
    of marketable outputs with their market price was used for computing gross returns
    (GR). The difference between GR and total variable cost is the Net returns (NR).
    The average exchange rate of the individual year was considered for changing the
    Indian rupee to USD. The average exchange rate of 2022 (₹ 77 = 1 USD) September
    was considered for changing the Indian rupee to USD. 3. Results and discussion
    3.1. Energy balance Energy balance study is a key tool for assessing the production
    efficiency of the different production systems and achieving the Sustainable Development
    Goals (SDGs). A production system is efficient when it produces higher EO with
    relatively lower EI. The EO, NER, and EUE are some of the pertinent indicators
    for efficient appraisal of energy utilization in modern crop production. These
    indicators are helpful in assessing the enterprises, their composition, adoption
    to the specific management practices, and appraising the feasibility of energy
    requirement. The EI in different crops in this study and other studies differed
    due to use of different energy coefficient values. This variation in energy coefficient
    value is due to difference in calculation of spatial and temporal boundaries used.
    The EI of crops ranged from 5.73 GJ ha−1 in castor to 98.09 GJ ha−1 in sugarcane
    (Table 1). This differential EI in different crop was due to variation in crop
    management factors like land preparation, fertilizer use, irrigation and pesticide
    application (Razzazi et al., 2017). Among different crops, EI in legume crops
    like soybean, pigeonpea, chickpea and groundnut were 7.28, 7.15, 7.91 and 8.53
    GJ ha−1 respectively and were lower than other crops. The lower EI in legumes
    was due to low nitrogen fertilizer requirement (Kakraliya et al., 2018). Table

    Rainfed. Among different crops sugarcane was the most energy intensive crop (98.06
    GJ ha−1). This was followed by irrigated rice (43.02 GJ ha−1), whereas chickpea
    had lowest EI of 14.11 GJ ha−1. The higher energy requirement in sugarcane cultivation
    is due to high intensive management practices such as higher fertilizer requirement
    especially nitrogen and water requirement. Due to higher water requirement no.
    of irrigations increased which in turn increased the electricity used for irrigation.
    Similar observations were reported by Elsoragaby et al. (2019). In rainfed condition
    maximum EI was observed in lowland rice (13.53 GJ ha−1), followed cotton (12.53
    GJ ha−1) and upland rice (10.08 GJ ha−1) and lowest in castor (5.73 GJ ha−1).
    In the different production systems contemplated, rainfed system was less energy
    intensive as compared to irrigated cropping system. The energy requirement for
    irrigated cropping system was almost twice as that required by rainfed systems.
    Irrigated crops like, castor, chickpea, cotton, groundnut, maize and rice crops
    recorded 165, 78, 96, 114, 181, 326 % higher EI as compared to the same crops
    grown under rainfed condition (Table 1). This higher EI in irrigated system than
    rainfed production system is usually associated with higher fertilizer use (nitrogen),
    and electricity for pumping of irrigation water (Fig. 2) (Rao et al., 2019). Download

    Source wise energy contribution on percentage basis (* Irri - Irrigated, Rf -
    Rainfed). Among the different sources of EI the share of electricity used for
    irrigation was highest accounting to 30.4 % of the total inputs in irrigated production
    system (Fig. 2). This was followed by irrigation water (20 %), fertilizer (23
    %) and fossil fuel (13 %). Where as in rainfed production system among different
    sources of energy the share of fertilizers in general and nitrogen in particular
    (44 %) was highest, this was followed by fossil fuel which accounted for 19 %
    of the total EI and labor (10 %). Similar higher EI with irrigation water and
    electricity for pumping of ground water was reported by Saxena and Rao (n.d.).
    While in rainfed conditions, fossil fuel (40.1 %), seed (23.6 %), nitrogen fertilizer
    (20.2 %) and machinery (7.0 %) were important sources of energy consumption (Channagouda
    et al., 2017). Thus, management strategies to increase nitrogen and water use
    efficiency are required to decrease fertilizer and irrigation input. Among the
    different operations under irrigated production systems, irrigation (48 %) contributed
    to highest EI, this was followed by fertilizer application (27 %) (Fig. 3). Among
    the different crops under study the highest energy requirement for irrigation
    was in sugarcane. Whereas, under rainfed production system, among different operations
    fertilizer application (56 %) followed by land preparation (16 %) were energy
    intensive. The highest energy requirement for fertilizer application was observed
    in maize production system, followed by sorghum and pearl millet, as nutrient
    requirements for these crops are higher. In irrigated production systems the share
    of direct sources of energy was 69 % of total energy consumption while in rainfed
    crops indirect source of energy contribution was higher (64 %) (Fig. 4). The non-renewable
    sources of energy were higher than renewable sources of energy under both irrigated
    (73 %) and rainfed (66 %) cultivation (Fig. 5). Download : Download high-res image

    recorded in rainfed chickpea (29.95 GJ ha−1) whereas higher EO was recorded in
    sugarcane (438.94 GJ ha−1) (Table 1). The EO is function of total biomass produced.
    The average EO of irrigated crops was 2.5 times higher as compared to rainfed
    crops. This higher EO was due to higher yields in irrigated system as compared
    to rainfed production system. Similar observations were reported by Azizi and
    Heidari (2013). In irrigated system, the EO for castor, cotton, chickpea, groundnut,
    maize, rice, wheat and sugarcane were 77.41, 35.77, 37.17, 106.87, 135.96, 98.72,
    113.55 and 438.94 GJ ha−1 respectively. Whereas in rainfed system, castor, cotton,
    chickpea, groundnut, maize, pigeonpea, soybean, sorghum, pearl millet upland and
    lowland rice produced 42.67, 32.2, 29.95, 87.25, 72.84, 49.76, 45.34, 55.6, 77.78,
    39.40 and 61.21 GJ ha−1 respectively. The EO of irrigated castor, cotton, chickpea,
    groundnut, maize, rice, was 81, 11, 24, 22, 86 and 93 % higher under rainfed system
    respectively (Feizi et al., 2015). The indicators on energy productivity and efficiencies
    like energy use efficiency (EUE), Specific energy (SE), nutrient EUE (Nu EUE),
    non-renewable EUE (NR EUE), net energy returns (NER), and energy profits can facilitate
    in understanding energy efficiency of a cropping system. Among the different crops,
    EUE was higher among the leguminous crops due to higher yields with lower EI.
    Cotton had lowest EUE under both irrigated (1.39) and rainfed (2.6) condition,
    this was followed by irrigated rice (2.28) and irrigated chickpea (4.02) whereas
    pearl millet (12.4) recorded highest EUE among all the crops (Table 1). This was
    followed by rainfed groundnut (10.29). The EUE of rainfed production system was
    higher than that irrigated system. This higher energy use efficiency in rainfed
    system was due to higher EO with lower EI. Irrigated systems required 1.5 times
    more energy per unit of yield produced (SE) than rainfed system as the energy
    required for irrigated cultivation was higher. The SE for irrigated rice was higher
    (17.91 MJ kg−1), compared to other crops in irrigated system, whereas under rainfed
    system, rainfed upland rice (8.77 MJ kg−1) (Table 1). Energy productivity (EP)
    is yield per unit of EI which varied from 0.07 kg MJ−1 (cotton) to 0.79 kg MJ−1
    (sugarcane) in irrigated agroecosystem whereas in rainfed system it ranged from
    0.11 kg MJ−1 (upland rice) to 0.30 kg MJ−1 (pearl millet) (Table 2). Higher EP
    in sugarcane crop under irrigated system and pearl millet under rainfed system
    could be attributed to higher yield obtained per unit of EI utilized. Similar
    results were also observed by Santos et al. (2021) and Shilpa Vasanthi and Meena
    (2021). The NER were higher under irrigated production system as compared to rainfed
    crops. Among the irrigated crops, sugarcane (340.85 GJ ha−1) recorded highest
    NER and cotton (10.59 GJ ha−1) the lowest (Table 2). Whereas, in rainfed production
    system the NER of groundnut (78.71 GJ ha−1), and pearl millet (71.52 GJ ha−1)
    were highest and cotton (19.68 GJ ha−1) recorded the lowest (Table 2). The NuEUE
    under both irrigated and rainfed production systems were almost similar, with
    the highest being observed under sugarcane (31.98) in irrigated crops and groundnut
    (22.86) under rainfed crops (Table 2). The NREUE was highest under irrigated rice
    cultivation (70.81) and in lowland rice (24.67) under rainfed cultivation (Table
    2). The eco energy efficiency (EEI) was 1.6 times higher for rainfed cropping
    system than irrigated indicating better efficiency of the rainfed production system.
    Among the different crops, castor (rainfed) (0.066) was most eco energy efficient
    under both production systems. Rainfed castor, cotton, chickpea, groundnut and
    maize were higher eco-efficient than irrigated production systems by 1.73, 3.16,1.6,
    1.64 times. The B:C ratio of different crops was higher under irrigated cultivation
    than under rainfed conditions (Table 2) because of higher gross income (Table
    S 4) incurred due to higher system productivity from irrigated production system
    as compared to rainfed system. The highest B: C ratio was recorded in cotton (1.06)
    and for chickpea (0.94) under irrigated system and castor (1.17) under rainfed
    production system (Table 2). Table 2. Returns of irrigated and rainfed crops.

    of CF in crops under different production system and factors affecting it can
    lead to identification of technological options which can enhance the efficiency
    of inputs, reduce wastage, and decrease the CF. The CF source reported in this
    study includes, CO2 emission from different farm operations, direct and indirect
    N2O emissions from fields, CH4 emission from paddy cultivation and crop residue
    burning in some crops. CO2 emission from farm operations and direct emission of
    N2O from the field was the major contributor to the total CF and together contributed
    55.1 % to 98.2 % (Fig. 6). CO2 emission from farm operations alone contributed
    25.1 % to 62.5 % to the total CF (Fig. 6). Contribution of CO2 emission from farm
    operation to the total CF was higher in irrigated crops as compared to rainfed
    crops. Download : Download high-res image (335KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 6. Emissions from farming operations (* Irri - Irrigated, Rf - Rainfed).
    CF was highest in irrigated crops as compared to rainfed crops. Castor, chickpea,
    cotton, groundnut and maize recorded 115, 170, 44, 107, 76, % higher CF in irrigated
    conditions as compared to rainfed castor, chickpea, cotton, groundnut and maize
    respectively (Table 3). Irrigated crops recorded 123 % higher CF over rainfed
    systems. The higher CF in irrigated crops was mainly due to electricity consumption
    for irrigation (20 %), higher fertilizer application (23 %) and fossil fuel consumption
    (13 %) for different farm operations. The indirect energy of machinery increased
    the contribution of CO2 emission to the total CF of the crops (Y. Zhang et al.,
    2018; G. Zhang et al., 2018). Among different crops in the study under irrigated
    conditions the maximum CF was recorded in sugarcane (3182 kg C ha−1) followed
    by irrigated rice (1349) (Table 3). The higher CF in rice was due to methane emissions
    which is 59.4 % and 43.5 % to the total CF in rice (Table 3). Similar observations
    recorded by Saha et al. (2017). The lowest CF was recorded in chickpea (127 kg
    C ha−1) among different cereals, pulses and oilseed under study. While in rainfed
    conditions lowland rice (990 kg C ha−1) recorded higher CF followed by cotton
    (461 kg C ha−1) and the lowest was reported in legumes as compared to other crops.

    irrigated crops as compared to rainfed crops. CO of different irrigated crops
    varied from 1550 (chickpea) to 52,741 kg C ha−1 (sugarcane) and 1273 (chickpea)
    to 3063 (pearl millet) kg C ha−1 in rainfed crops (Table 3). Castor, chickpea,
    cotton, groundnut, maize and rice recorded 81, 21, 15, 23,113, 38 % higher CO
    in irrigated conditions as compared to rainfed conditions (Table 3). The higher
    CO in irrigated condition was mainly due to higher yields which is because of
    optimum soil moisture and nutrient availability to the crops due to irrigation
    and higher amount of fertilizer application in irrigated agro-ecosystem. The CUE
    varied from 2.2 (irrigated rice) to 16.57 (sugarcane) under irrigated condition
    and 2.2 in rice (lowland) to 14.5 in groundnut and pearl millet under rainfed
    condition (Table 3). The CUE was higher in crops grown under rainfed production
    system than irrigated system, except in maize where it was 1.2 times lower than
    irrigated system (Table 3). Rainfed crops recorded 18.5, 25, 121 and 76 % higher
    CUE in castor, cotton, chickpea and groundnut respectively. Yield scaled carbon
    footprint (CFy) in different crops varied from 0.51) kg C eq. kg−1 (maize) to
    2.11 kg C eq. kg−1 (irrigated rice in irrigated condition) and 0.41 kg C eq. kg−1
    (pearl millet) to 2.19 kg C eq. kg−1 (lowland rice) in rainfed condition (Table
    3). Among different crops, rice grown under both irrigated and rainfed conditions
    recorded higher CFy. Rainfed crops had lower CFy as compared to irrigated condition.
    Carbon sustainability index (CSI) ranged from 1.2 (irrigated rice) to 10.3 (sugarcane)
    in irrigated system (Table 3). Whereas, in rainfed production it varied from 1.2
    (lowland rice) to 13.5 (pearl millet and groundnut). Among the crops studied under
    both production systems, the CSI was 1.2, 1.3, 2.6 and 1.9 times higher in rainfed
    castor, cotton, chickpea and groundnut respectively as compared to irrigated conditions.
    The carbon efficiency ratio (CER) was also higher in sugarcane (24.54) under irrigated
    systems and in lowland rice (1.7) under rainfed systems. The rainfed castor, cotton,
    chickpea and groundnut had higher CER when compared to irrigated system by 20,
    33,126 and 72 % respectively. The higher CUE, CSI and CER observed could be due
    to the lower CF in these production systems. The Green House Gas Intensity (GHGI),
    was higher in irrigated rice (1.12 kg C eq. kg−1) and lowland rice (1.32 kg C
    eq. kg−1) in rainfed crops whereas, lowest GHGI was observed in sugarcane (0.12
    kg C eq. kg−1) in irrigated and in groundnut (0.17 kg C eq. kg−1) in rainfed condition.
    The eco efficiency index (EEI) was lowest for irrigated rice (0.05 USD kg CO2
    eq−1) and rice (upland and lowland) (0.05 kg CO2 eq. kg−1) under irrigated and
    rainfed systems respectively (Table 3). Among the different crops investigated
    in this study, CUE was highest in the pulses (36.4), followed by millets (22.8),
    cereals (17.21) and oil seed crops (14.2). Similar results were reported by Kumar
    et al. (2021). 3.3. Mitigation strategies to improve EUE and CUE This study has
    revealed that agronomic management practices play a major role in energy and carbon
    balance and thereby has an environmental impact. Among different crop management
    practices, the share of fertilizers, irrigation and fossil fuel used for land
    preparation contributed to highest EI and CF under both irrigated and rainfed
    conditions (Y. Zhang et al., 2018; G. Zhang et al., 2018). The management strategies
    which can improve nutrient and water use efficiency by efficient utilization of
    nitrogen fertilizer, use of micro irrigation methods, in situ moisture conservation,
    crop residues management, cop diversification and GHG mitigation strategies are
    need of hour to improve the energy and carbon use efficiency, climate resilience
    and reduce the environment impact. The energy and CF can further be reduced through
    efficient integrated crop management practices in both rainfed and irrigated systems.
    Hence an attempt was made to use some case studies for the way forward towards
    identifying mitigation co-benefits by enhancing energy and carbon use efficiency
    (Table 4). Table 4. Mitigation and management strategies. Mitigation measures

    Enhancement of nutrient use efficiency The nitrogen losses in agro-ecosystems
    is about 60 % of N applied to soils (Clark and Tilman, 2017; Alam et al., 2019)
    and the nitrogen use efficiency in irrigated and rainfed crops is <50 %. Hence
    increase in N use efficiency would help to convert to N savings with the synthetic
    or organic N input. This will further help in reducing GHG emissions from fertilizer
    manufacture, N2O emissions in particular along with soil based GHG emissions in
    general (IPCC, 2007). Thus, mitigation options should include efficient nutrient
    management practices which increase N use efficiency, reduce synthetic fertilizers
    application, reduce GHG emissions and enhance the crop yield. Apart from soil
    based GHG emissions the manufacturing of fertilizers also contributes significantly
    to GHGs emissions. The manufacture of N fertilizers is fossil-fuel intensive where
    methane is used as a source of hydrogen for urea feedstock. Thus reduction in
    GHG emissions and mitigation co-benefits with fertilizers can be achieved through
    improvement in N use efficiency and the type of fertilizer used. Besides the fertilizer
    application several alternative nutrient application methods like growing legume
    cover crops, application of organic manures like compost or manure, crop residues
    recycling, site-specific nutrient management, soil test-based fertilizer application,
    customized fertilizers, enhanced efficient N fertilizers, real-time N application
    and integrated nutrient management are some of nutrient-smart practices. Neem-coated
    urea (NCU), leaf colour chart and soil health card is used alone or integrated
    in rice successfully for improved fertilizer use efficiency as well as reduced
    GHG emissions in India (Pathak, 2022). Higher EO was observed in plots with the
    application of Neem Coated Urea (NCU) compared to prilled urea (PU) Jat et al.
    (2019). Besides this the manufacture of NCU has lower CF as compared to PU. Recycled
    organic residues, such as manure or compost, can provide additional sources of
    N fertilizer to substitute chemical N. This can save fossil-fuel burning in synthetic
    fertilizers production. The plant-based products like neem oil, neem cake and
    pongamia seed extract also has nitrification inhibition properties An effective
    N management method which reduce CF, environmentally safe, and energy efficient
    thereby coated urea can mitigate climate change (Jat et al., 2019). The technology
    and the composition of the raw materials used the fertilizer energy equivalents
    vary highly. 48.5 MJ kg−1 N and 39.4 MJ kg−1 N were consumed for the production
    and prilling of urea ammonium nitrate respectively. Whereas, for the production
    and granulation of triple superphosphate, 16.4 MJ kg−1 P of energy was consumed,
    including 1.9 MJ kg−1 P for ore transport (Alluvione et al., 2011). 3.3.2. Water
    management The irrigation water application efficiency at farm level for different
    crops varies between 15 and 45 %. This low efficiency is due to conveyance losses
    such as evaporation and seepage which indicates that more than half of the irrigation
    water is unused by the crop and is returned to the hydrologic system, either as
    deep percolation or non-productive evaporation (Jin et al., 2018). Approximately,
    70 % of irrigation source in India is ground water and pumping of this groundwater
    for irrigation is a major source of EI in irrigated agriculture. Hence different
    efficient irrigation management practices are required to improve water productivity,
    irrigation efficiency, economic benefits, environmental sustainability (Molden
    et al., 2007), energy productivity (De Fraiture et al., 2007) and low CF. Unless
    energy requirement aspects are not considered, the enhancement in irrigation efficiency
    is a partial solution for reducing the environmental footprint of consumptive
    use of water. Therefore, improved farm water management practices like irrigation
    scheduling, optimum use of irrigation water, subsurface irrigation are important
    tools to achieve efficient use of ground water at farm level, reduce ground water
    extraction. In addition, these techniques play a vital role in lowering energy
    use and carbon emissions (Emeribe et al., 2017). 3.3.2.1. Case study – different
    methods of irrigation An irrigation system needs to be designed and managed in
    a way that delivers maximum water with low EI and improved energy productivity,
    minimum greenhouse gas emissions while optimizing economic returns (Ahmad and
    Khan, 2009). The energy-water productivity is an integrated indicator of water
    and energy use in agricultural production systems. It captures the efficiency
    of systems which are energy intensive as well as water scarce. The high-pressure
    drip irrigation system is one of such systems and has highest value of energy-water
    productivity (Ahmad and Khan, 2009). Hence an attempt was made to evaluate different
    irrigation methods like flood method, alternate furrow and drip irrigation in
    maize, cotton and sugarcane. It was observed that the EUE was highest in drip
    followed by alternate furrow method and flooding. In maize, cotton and sugarcane
    crop, the EUE under drip, alternate furrow and flood irrigation methods were 10,
    8.38 and 6.75, 11.94, 10.12 and 7.96 and 12.7, 9.98 and 7.81 respectively. The
    energy productivity under these methods of irrigation followed the order: drip>
    alternate furrow> flooding and the energy productivity under these methods of
    irrigation were 0.23, 0.19 and 0.16 in maize, 0.37, 0.31 and 0.25 in cotton and
    1.26, 1.0 and 0.78 in sugarcane respectively (Table S 5). Furthermore the drip
    irrigation saved 54 % and 39 % of water and electricity respectively over flood
    irrigation. The higher energy productivity in drip irrigation is due to lower
    electricity consumption and saving in water. Besides this, the adoption of drip
    irrigation saved 418, 522 and 2405 kg CO2 ha−1 yr−1 in maize, cotton and sugarcane
    respectively compared to alternate furrow method where the reduction was 228,
    285 and 1431 kg CO2 ha−1 yr−1 in in maize, cotton and sugarcane respectively.
    Fagodiya et al. (2023) reported that the pressurized irrigation system (drip (DRIP)
    and mini-sprinkler (MSIS)) in rice-wheat production system established under conservational
    tillage and residue management (DRIP-Reduced tillage Direct seeded rice (RTDSR)
    followed by zero-till wheat with 100 % rice residue mulching (ZTW + RM) and MSIS-Direct
    seeded Rice (DSR) + Residue incorporation (RI) followed by ZTW + RM)) had lower
    energy consumption (31–38 %), lower specific energy (44–61 %), higher energy use
    efficiency compared to the conventional system where puddled transplanted rice
    followed by conventionally tilled wheat was followed. The adept use of farm inputs
    (residues) lowered greenhouse gas emission (39–44 %) thereby enhancing carbon
    sequestration to 35–62 % and 63–76 % lower CF over the conventional system. 3.3.3.
    Conservation agriculture The third input which has major share in the EI and CF
    is fossil fuel for tillage operations by farm implements manufacture, transportation
    and repair of the machines (Baran and Okdogan, 2016). Hence reduction in tillage
    operations has enormous scope in enhancing the energy use efficiency of a production
    system. The current study indicated that the share of fossil fuel for EI and CI
    in irrigated and rainfed conditions was 13 and 19 % respectively. Residue management
    is a tedious task, hence large scale burning of crop residues was practised. Rice,
    wheat and sugarcane are the major crops whose residues are subjected to on farm
    burning (Jain et al., 2014). The large scale burning of these crop residues has
    several adverse impacts on the environment like air pollution, the increase in
    particulate matter and carbon emissions, which contributes to regional and global
    climate change. Burning of crop residue causes emission of GHGs like CO2 (70 %)
    and N2O (2.09 %) which can alter the radiation balance of the atmosphere. The
    burning of sugar cane trash led to the loss of 0.84 Mt, rice residues 0.45 Mt
    and wheat residue 0.14 Mt nutrient per year out of which 0.39 Mt was nitrogen,
    0.014 Mt potassium and 0.30 Mt was phosphorus (Jain et al., 2014). Hence residue
    retention instead of burning leads to significant reduction in air pollution.
    Residue incorporation in soil, or use of residues as soil cover, is the easiest
    and successful method to improve water productivity, retain soil moisture, suppress
    weeds, regulate soil temperature and reduce GHG emissions (Bhatt and Khera, 2006).
    Conservation agricultural (CA) practices involving minimum soil disturbance, permanent
    soil cover and diversified crop rotations are often advocated as a sustainable
    farming practice provides opportunities for obtaining sustainable crop yield,
    increasing input use efficiency, improves soil properties and also GHG emissions.
    Some of the studies conducted to evaluate the energy budget under different methods
    of tillage are presented below. 3.3.3.1. Case study- energetics under different
    methods of tillage operation In rainfed pigeonpea–castor annual crop rotation
    30 and 31 % higher EIs were recorded in conventional tillage (CT) than in zero
    tillage (ZT) in pigeon pea and castor respectively under rainfed conditions. It
    was observed in the study that EUE was highest in ZT (4.34 and 6.59 in pigeonpea
    and castor, respectively) followed by RT (4.17 and 6.22 in pigeonpea and castor,
    respectively). Reducing the tillage operations from CT to RT and ZT, energy use
    reduced by 38 % and 79 % respectively. Hence reduction in the number of tillage
    operations helps to increase the EUE of the production system. The increase in
    EUE is mainly due to reduced EI. The lower EI is due to reduction in use of fossil
    fuel. The fossil fuel contribution in CT was 34 % and RT was 26 % whereas in ZT,
    it was only 16 %. This reduced fuel consumption led to reduction in GHG emissions
    by 21 and 23 % in pigeon pea and castor in ZT as compared to CT. Thus, reducing
    the number of tillage operations has reduced GHG emissions (Pratibha et al., 2015).
    3.3.3.2. Case study – energy and carbon budget with different tillage implements
    Apart from no. of tillage operations tillage implement and depth of tillage influence
    EUE as well as GHG emissions. The increase in depth of tillage and soil disturbance
    requires higher fuel consumption. Mouldboard plough + harrow (MPH) recorded higher
    energy consumption and GHG emissions as compared to disc harrow (DH). No Tillage
    (NT) recorded no direct EI. Land preparation with DH recorded higher EUE (12.99)
    and carbon use efficiency (2.62). Highest direct energy consumption was reported
    in MPH (1.57 GJha−1) and disc plough +harrow (DPH) (1.56 GJha−1) due to greater
    depth of operation and soil volume disturbance which led to higher fuel consumption.
    Indirect energy was also highest in MPH (175 MJha−1) and DPH (154 MJha−1) whereas
    in DH the direct and indirect energy were 450 MJha−1 and 95 MJha−1 respectively.
    DH (2.62) recorded highest CUE followed by rotovator (RO), Bullock drawn plough
    and harrow and cultivator followed by disc harrow (CVH). The higher CUE is due
    to low carbon input and high carbon output. Lowest carbon use efficiency was observed
    in operations that involved ploughing like MP (1.92) and DP (1.95). The study
    has revealed that increase in tillage depth and soil volume disturbance led to
    higher GHG emissions, lower EUE and CUE. The analysis of data from the present
    study and the case studies mentioned above suggests that, on an average, a change
    from CT to NT will result in C sequestration in soil with a savings in CO2 emissions
    from energy use in agriculture (Pratibha et al., 2019). CA practices reduce the
    CF and GHG emissions (Somasundaram et al., 2020). The studies have revealed that
    a global warming potential of about 25 Mt CO2eq is mitigated annually with adoption
    of various CA practices in India (Pathak et al., 2021). 3.3.4. Crop diversification
    Cereal based cropping systems are one of the inputs intensive practice and largely
    responsible for GHGs emissions, higher carbon and energy foot print and ground
    water pollution (Hazra et al., 2018). In irrigated cropping systems the dominant
    rice-wheat cropping system intensively cultivated in the Indo-Gangetic Plains
    zone of South Asia, is an energy and C-intensive zone. Hence, there is an urgent
    need to diversify the existing cereal based cropping systems in general and rice-wheat
    cropping system in particular with more C-and energy efficient production systems,
    which are more productive, climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable (Kumar
    et al., 2021). This study has revealed that the leguminous crop has a lower C
    and energy footprint as compared to cereals due to the lower energy, carbon inputs
    and lower GHG emissions. In South Africa, cereal production accounted for 68 %
    of GHG emission while legume and oilseed contributed 11 % and vegetables, 7 %.
    CF values of wheat, pulse, oilseed, cauliflower, brinjal, and potato are 0.12,
    0.31, 0.42, 0.03, 0.03, and 0.02 kg CO2 eq. kg−1 produce respectively (Tongwane
    et al., 2016).. Apart from legumes, the millet-based production system reduced
    EI, CF and enhanced the EUE by 84, 58, and 61 %, respectively, in comparison to
    cereal-based cropping systems (Kumar et al., 2021). Hence crop diversification
    of cereal-based systems with millets or legumes helps in reducing the CF of crops
    by 32 % to 315 % and also reduce GHG emissions (Yadav et al., 2018). Alternately,
    legumes enrich the soil with N for the subsequent crops and curtail global CO2
    emission (>300 Tg Yr − 1), 50 % of which emits from N-fertilizer (urea) industries
    (Jensen et al., 2012). Hence crop diversification with the introduction of legumes
    in the cropping systems as cover crops or intercrops represents a key strategy
    to reduce N fertilizer needs at the crop and rotation scale (Bedoussac et al.,
    2015; Plaza-Bonilla et al., 2017). The inclusion of millets in the existing system
    also improved the energy productivity, system productivity, and economic efficiency
    under the diverse agro-ecological zone of eastern India. (Kumar et al., 2020)
    Hence to maximize the benefits, introduction of climate resilient legumes or millets
    which are more profitable, resource use-efficient, energy-cum‑carbon-efficient,
    and low emitter of GHGs in cereal based cropping systems is the need of the hour
    (Plaza-Bonilla et al., 2017; Reckling et al., 2015). 3.3.5. Mitigation in rice
    cultivation Conventional paddy cultivation (flooding) consumes large amounts of
    water and results in higher GHGs, low yields, and low non-renewable resource use
    efficiencies (e.g., fertilizer and fossil fuel) (Chen et al., 2014; Yao et al.,
    2014). CH4 flux in irrigated rice transplanted in kharif season in the range of
    30.56 to 37.79 mg m−2 day−1 whereas in rainfed condition the emissions ranged
    between 4.55 and 13.51 mg m−2 day−1 (Saha et al., 2017). Besides water management
    the source of fertilizer also plays a major role in reduction of methane emissions.
    Application of ammonium sulfate for urea as N fertilizer resulted in a 25–36 %
    reduction in CH4 emissions (Bhuiyan et al., 2021). Deep placement of urea as compared
    to surface application also reduces methane emissions (Shrestha and Bokhtiar,
    2019). Water management in rice field also affects CH4 emissions considerably.
    Meta-analysis of the studies in Asia has revealed that intermittent wetting and
    drying (IWD) reduces GWP by 43 % (Sanchis et al., 2012). Furthermore, biomass
    incorporation along with intermittent wetting and drying was an effective strategy
    for GWP mitigation in rice crop (Haque et al., 2015). Direct seeding of rice (DSR)
    can further reduce the GHGs emission (Alam et al., 2019) wherein seeds are directly
    sown in soil without puddling. Hence this technology is reported to reduce CH4
    emission, save labor, water and has got better adaptive capacity to climate change
    (Pathak and Aggarwal, 2012). Fallow lands also contribute to GHGs emissions (Haque
    et al., 2015; Sander et al., 2018). Therefore copping in the fallow period of
    existing cereal-based cropping systems with short-duration dual purpose summer
    season grain legume can sequester atmospheric CO2 in soil (Jat et al., 2014).
    4. Conclusions The aim of the present study was to assess the energy input-output
    in major crops grown in India in both irrigated and rainfed production systems.
    and to devise highly productive, profitable, efficient and environmentally sustainable
    crops, production systems and management practices which are carbon - energy efficient
    (lower GHGs emissions, CF and EI. The study showed that irrigated crops are high
    energy intensive with high CF as compared to rainfed. The EO was higher in irrigated
    crops, but the EUE was higher in rainfed production systems. Contribution of GHG
    emission from farm operations to the total CF was found to be higher in irrigated
    crops as compared to rainfed crops. The non-renewable energy sources such as chemical
    fertilizer, irrigation, diesel fuel and electricity (64 %, 78 %, 75 %, 67 % average
    of all crops grown in irrigated, rainfed) were the major sources of EI. The energy
    and carbon use efficiency in the sugarcane crop was highest followed by cereals,
    oilseeds and pulses under irrigated system, whereas under rainfed; EUE was maximum
    in cereal followed by oilseeds and pulse crops. The oil seeds recorded highest
    CUE under rainfed production system followed by cereals and pulses. In this study
    more sustainable, productive, energy-cum-C-efficient practices, which promote
    environmentally clean and safer production system in both irrigated and rainfed
    ecosystems of India were identified and these practices are applicable to South
    Asia. The important management practices were to adopt high nutrient and water
    use efficiencies strategies. A few strategies which are nutrient and water use
    efficient were • Application of the right source of fertilizers at the right dose
    and placement pf fertilizers and at right time, use of efficient slow releasing
    fertilizers and nitrification inhibitors for enhancing nutrient use efficiency.
    • Proper irrigation scheduling and water use efficient irrigation methods like
    drip irrigation method for increasing water use efficiency and reduce carbon and
    energy input of the system. • Shifting from conventional tillage practice to conservation
    agriculture or reduced tillage system can reduce the share of fossil fuel in energy
    and carbon footprints. • Crop diversification with legumes or millets in cereal
    based systems. • Intercropping/cover cropping with legumes. Introduction of short
    duration legumes reduces in cereal based fallows. Planning and implementation
    of above strategies can augment food production and reduce energy and carbon foot
    print. Site specific strategic measures are to be adopted as counter measures
    to lower the CF and enhance EUE significantly. The information from this study
    would improve the information and assist in upgrading the database of policymakers
    and researchers for promoting sustainable, safer, high energy and carbon efficient
    and cleaner productive climate- resilient cropping systems in the India and South
    Asia to attain the ‘Sustainable Development Goals’. CRediT authorship contribution

    1. Introduction Cryptosporidium is a known causative agent of infectious diarrhoea,
    affecting human and animal populations worldwide (Gururajan et al., 2021; Ryan
    et al., 2014). It has been documented as the primary etiological agent of 63 %
    of 239 waterborne outbreaks reported in 2017 (Efstratiou et al., 2017). It is
    considered a significant concern in the food production industry worldwide as
    it is associated with over eight million annual cases of foodborne diseases (Ahmed
    and Karanis, 2018; Ryan et al., 2018). Diarrhoeal diseases were the cause of mortality
    in nearly 1.5 million cases in 2019, of which half were children (Dattani et al.,
    2023). Of the 44 species and over 120 valid genotypes of Cryptosporidium reported
    globally, 21 species and genotypes have been documented in humans, with C. hominis
    and C. parvum being the most frequent species, accounting for over 90 % of the
    infection cases (Li et al., 2020; Ryan et al., 2021). C. andersoni, C. ubiquitum,
    C. meleagridis, C. muris, and C. cuniculus are among the other pathogenic species
    in humans, and they are responsible for the sporadic emergence of zoonotic outbreaks,
    mainly due to direct contact with infected animals (Ahmed and Karanis, 2020).
    Cryptosporidium oocysts can be transmitted directly or indirectly via contact
    with infected hosts or contaminated sources, typically through the faecal-oral
    route (Putignani and Menichella, 2010). Notably, ingestion of a single oocyst
    can potentially cause infection (Carmena, 2010; Messner and Berger, 2016). The
    faecal-oral transmission modes of Cryptosporidium include the following: • Person-to-person
    contact. • Contact with infected animals. • Consumption of contaminated food.
    • Consumption of contaminated water (e.g., drinking, and recreational water).
    Cryptosporidium infection leads to mild and severe diarrhoea and several gastrointestinal
    symptoms by interfering with barrier function and absorption capability. The disease
    is mild and self-limiting in immunocompetent adults (Marcos and Gotuzzo, 2013).
    Cryptosporidium spp. have been frequently found in water environments throughout
    Latin America since 2000 (Rosado-García et al., 2017). Different water sources
    in African countries are also contaminated with oocysts of Cryptosporidium parasites,
    with a significant incidence in nearly 50 % of the reports. Based on these reports,
    the multiple risk factors contributing to the promotion of waterborne protozoan
    parasites (e.g., Cryptosporidium) and other microbial pathogens linked to diarrhoea
    include poor institutional infrastructure, insufficient water supplies, insecure
    drinking water, poor sanitary facilities, water crises, global warming, lack of
    development, political and social conflicts, poverty, increased level of malnutrition,
    high population density, and illiteracy (Aldeyarbi et al., 2016). Developing countries
    are predominantly affected by Cryptosporidium-attributable diarrhoeal diseases
    (Ahmed et al., 2018; Aldeyarbi et al., 2016; Kotloff et al., 2013; Kotloff, 2017;
    Mahmoudi et al., 2017; Rosado-García et al., 2017). According to the Global Enteric
    Multicenter Study (GEMS), Cryptosporidium has been indicated as one of the four
    most typical causes of diarrhoeal disorders occurring over the first two years
    of life in seven regions in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, with approximately
    202,000 deaths caused by cryptosporidiosis annually (Liu et al., 2016; Sow et
    al., 2016; Kotloff et al., 2013). Insufficient official reports on the occurrence
    of Cryptosporidium in human populations, food, water resources, and the environment
    have resulted in the underestimation of significant numbers of waterborne disease
    reports and associated outbreaks in various developing countries (Ahmed and Karanis,
    2020). Cryptosporidiosis has become a severe public health issue in developed
    countries. For instance, the Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) estimate indicated
    that the burden of Cryptosporidium in the Netherlands, a country with proper sanitary
    standards, has increased since the prior forecast. In addition, cryptosporidiosis
    cost 19.2 million euros and led to 137 DALYs in 2017, while long-term clinical
    symptoms such as persistent diarrhoea and joint discomfort caused 9 % of all DALYs
    in this country. Many cryptosporidiosis cases have been documented in the US,
    which has the largest economy in the world. According to the Centers for Disease
    Control and Prevention (CDC), a four-fold increase was observed in the rate of
    outbreaks caused by Cryptosporidium reported in the US between 2014 and 2016.
    Foodborne cryptosporidiosis is a disease of public health importance in both developing
    and developed countries. However, epidemiological surveys have shown that the
    prevalence of cryptosporidiosis in developing nations (5 % to >10 %) is higher
    than that in developed nations (<1–3 %), primarily due to poor water quality and
    food sanitation (DuPont, 2016; Karanis, 2018). Thus, it is essential to establish
    specific public health surveillance to prioritize concerns associated with Cryptosporidium
    infection in these regions. In developed countries, the primary sources of Cryptosporidium
    are contaminated water resources and food products. The surveillance and monitoring
    programs in these countries primarily concerned bacterial and viral infections,
    and only included small numbers of protozoan parasites in their public health
    systems. In high-income countries, these parasitic infections are frequently disregarded
    as the leading causative agents of diarrhoea due to overconfidence in municipal
    sanitization facilities, hygiene monitoring systems, livestock and agricultural
    practices (Bouzid et al., 2018; Putignani and Menichella, 2010). Livestock is
    an agriculture sector that is crucial to providing food security on a worldwide
    scale (Hollas et al., 2022). However, the expansion of the agricultural and livestock
    sectors has affected the environment, contributing to natural resource loss, greenhouse
    gas emissions, and pollution (Yitbarek, 2019). Cryptosporidiosis has been documented
    in a variety of livestock animals, including cattle, buffaloes, pigs, goats, sheep,
    horses, camels, donkeys, and poultry such as chickens and ducks (Ryan et al.,
    2014; Robertson et al., 2014). Cattle, and quite possibly wild ruminants, play
    a significant role in releasing Cryptosporidium oocysts into the environment,
    which are responsible for foodborne and waterborne diarrhoea outbreaks in humans
    worldwide. The ability of cattle to carry different species of Cryptosporidium,
    including C. hominis, highlights a significant public health risk related to this
    potential association (Hatam-Nahavandi et al., 2019). Animal manure is a valuable
    source of organic materials and nutrients, including phosphorus, potassium, and
    nitrogen, thus stimulating the search for alternatives for managing this waste.
    Global efforts toward environmentally friendly practices have led to the worldwide
    promotion of methods that enhance the sustainability of production processes.
    As a result, governmental organizations have focused on adopting strategies to
    promote a less polluting and low-carbon economy (Bluemling and Wang, 2018). One
    of the current major concerns in waste management is the shift from linear to
    cyclical thinking, with the application of circular economy (CE) concepts as one
    of the primary solutions for these modifications (Širá et al., 2022). The vision
    of the circular economy must be applied to managing waste, particularly agricultural
    waste, to enable these activities to maintain their operations in the future.
    The finalization of the material cycle depends on the recovery of energy, by-products,
    nutrients, and water reuse (Bonciu et al., 2021). The present article critically
    reviews scientific research on Cryptosporidium species in the agricultural sector.
    It summarizes the knowledge regarding the risks of cryptosporidiosis in agricultural
    production, emphasizing the sources of contamination, the importance of animal
    production in transmitting the parasite, and the role of farmed animals as hosts.
    The zoonotic potential and risk to farmers and household members are also highlighted.
    In contrast, the need for a training strategy for farmers and the One Health approach
    are advocated for controlling and preventing zoonotic cryptosporidiosis. 2. Literature
    search A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar
    databases to find relevant papers without time limitation until 2022 using the
    following criteria and keywords; “Cryptosporidium” and “cryptosporidiosis” and
    sector of interest “agriculture” in combination with terms including “surface
    water”, “groundwater”, “irrigation water”, “vegetables”, “fruits”, “livestock”,
    “transmission”, “zoonosis”, “farmers” and “measures”. Documents related to Cryptosporidium
    in agriculture are included in the list of references. In total, 409 papers were
    found to be relevant to the subject of the current study, which were checked,
    and valuable scientific knowledge was summarized. 3. Water pollution from agricultural
    contamination sources: impact on Cryptosporidium transmission The impact of agricultural
    practices on the pollution and degradation of inland and coastal water bodies
    in most high-income countries is more significant than that on settlements and
    industries (Evans et al., 2019). Agriculture accounts for 70 % of the world''s
    water resources; therefore, agricultural pollutants lead to the pollution or deterioration
    of the environment and nearby ecosystems (Díaz et al., 2012; Mateo-Sagasta et
    al., 2017; Wato et al., 2020). This contamination occurs through runoff, soil
    erosion, livestock farming, aquaculture, chemical inputs, and overuse of water
    resources (Mateo-Sagasta et al., 2017; Önder et al., 2011). In the USA, agricultural
    land is a substantial source of pollution for rivers and streams, and it is considered
    the second and third potential source of contamination for wetlands and lakes,
    respectively (US EPA, 2016). Furthermore, as demonstrated by the National Water
    Quality Inventory in the USA, pollutants and pathogens from agriculture and agricultural
    production are responsible for almost 50 % of contaminated water bodies in this
    country (Díaz et al., 2012). In European countries, 38 % of the water bodies are
    threatened by agricultural pollutants (Mateo-Sagasta et al., 2017). In addition,
    agricultural activities are responsible for significant surface water and groundwater
    nitrogen pollution in China (Mateo-Sagasta et al., 2013). In low-income countries,
    agricultural-based pollutants have also become a concern due to increased sediment
    runoff (Evans et al., 2019). At the global level, the FAO indicated that factors
    associated with agriculture, such as the production of waste from livestock and
    aquaculture, manure application, misuse of fertilizers, unsustainable cropping,
    non-standard grazing systems, surface runoff, and microbial and antimicrobial
    residues via leaching, potentially lead to pollutants reaching water resources
    (FAO, 2020). The increasing trend of water scarcity worldwide has raised attention
    to the use of alternative water sources for agricultural purposes, emphasizing
    the need for improved management of the microbial safety of water used for irrigation
    (Alegbeleye and Sant''Ana, 2021). Therefore, wastewater reuse is a helpful solution
    despite potential risks to public health and the ecosystem (Abeledo-Lameiro et
    al., 2018; Liao et al., 2021), as worldwide wastewater production is estimated
    to be 330 km3 per year (Tripathi et al., 2019). Regardless of the risks of emerging
    contaminants and subsequent health issues, wastewater reuse for irrigation remains
    common in different regions of the world (Jaramillo and Restrepo, 2017; Tripathi
    et al., 2019). Its reuse in agriculture is classified into direct and indirect
    utilization, with the last being the prevailing practice in agricultural settings
    as approximately 35.9 Mha of agrarian fields are exposed to the indirect use of
    wastewater (Mateo-Sagasta et al., 2017). In this process, the treated effluent
    is diluted with fresh water, from reservoirs or streams after discharge from wastewater
    treatment plants (Jeong et al., 2016). However, there are concerns regarding the
    massive disposal of untreated wastewater on land and surface waters to cover irrigation
    water demand, particularly in arid areas, as it can be involved in epidemics of
    foodborne diseases (Tripathi et al., 2019). Previous studies have reported a strong
    correlation between intestinal parasites and the application of wastewater and
    animal/human excreta in agricultural production, especially in Africa, South and
    Southeast Asia, and China, all regions with intense water shortages (Duc et al.,
    2011). Agricultural water, which is source of water used in agricultural practices
    (e.g., irrigation, livestock watering, and various other farming activities),
    plays a prominent role in the transmission of Cryptosporidium, mainly attributable
    to the presence of livestock (as a reservoir) and crops exposed to contaminated
    irrigation water, manure, and agricultural workers (Spanakos et al., 2015). Manure-based
    pathogens are possible causative agents of large waterborne and foodborne outbreaks
    (Venglovsky et al., 2006). Manure-borne contaminants originating from non-point
    sources (pastured and stray animals and leaching/runoff from agricultural fields)
    and point sources (manure storage lagoons, animal housing facilities, and animal
    feedstuffs) can result in water and soil contamination (Venglovsky et al., 2006).
    Manure application on agricultural lands is associated with the transmission of
    Cryptosporidium parasites to humans (Boxall et al., 2009). Manure-contaminated
    runoff water from farms and animal waste utilization in agricultural fields can
    release significant quantities of oocysts into the environment (Schijven et al.,
    2004). The prevalence of Cryptosporidium in manure can differ among livestock
    species and age categories. Recent research estimating global Cryptosporidium
    loads in livestock manure revealed that cattle predominantly contribute to approximately
    3.2 × 1023 oocysts per year. Asian countries exhibit the highest loads of livestock-derived
    oocysts from waste, followed by European, South American, and African countries
    (Vermeulen et al., 2017). According to a global review, it is estimated that Cryptosporidium
    spp., with an overall prevalence of 11 %, is the most prevalent protozoa in vegetables
    (Badri et al., 2022) because of the use of new or insufficiently composted animal
    and human faeces as fertilizer in agricultural lands. Many recent studies have
    revealed Cryptosporidium contamination in wastewater and recycled water used for
    agricultural irrigation, urban reuse, and recreational purposes (Spanakos et al.,
    2015; Zhu et al., 2022), and the overall prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. In
    wastewater, surface water and groundwater resources are estimated to be 46.9 %,
    45.3 %, and 18.8–19.9 %, respectively (Daraei et al., 2021). A quantitative risk
    assessment calculated the probability of contamination with Cryptosporidium originating
    from the use of surface waters and effluents in septic tanks on agricultural land
    in China. According to this evaluation, the total disease burden due to Cryptosporidium
    infection was 9.68 × 10−6 disability-adjusted life years per person per year (DALYs
    pppy) and 3.14 × 10−5 DALYs pppy for immunocompetent patients and cancer patients,
    respectively (Huang et al., 2023). Furthermore, the extensive effects of agricultutal
    water pollution significantly affect the quality of water bodies. It is conceivable
    that drinking water derived from groundwater contributes more significantly than
    expected to the worldwide burden of cryptosporidiosis (Chique et al., 2020). Surface
    water, the primary source of drinking water supply, is widely used for recreational
    activities, such as swimming, boating, and fishing (Shortle et al., 2001; Horman
    et al., 2004). These water resources are at risk of contamination by surface runoff
    from agricultural lands, which has a substantial role in water impairment, degradation
    of drinking water supplies, and hazards to aquatic and wildlife ecosystems (Bashir
    et al., 2020). The consumption of contaminated surface water and groundwater is
    strongly linked to waterborne outbreaks, especially those related to Cryptosporidium
    species (Karanis et al., 2007; Baldursson and Karanis, 2011; Chique et al., 2020;
    Efstratiou et al., 2017; Bourli et al., 2023). Table 1 shows the surface water
    and groundwater contamination of Cryptosporidium species. Table 1. Surface waters

    climatic patterns on the transmission of Cryptosporidium spp. Weather patterns
    and climatic factors have an essential effect on the transmission of Cryptosporidium
    spp. (Boxall et al., 2009). Climate conditions can play a significant role in
    the possibility of resuspended oocysts in water, contamination of water sources
    by effluents, and crop contamination (Lal et al., 2013). The effects of rainfall
    pattern and temperature on cryptosporidiosis incidence may be either direct (supporting
    the survival and dissemination of oocysts) or indirect (improving factors that
    enhance the chances of transmission). Warmer temperatures increase recreational
    activities in surface waters (e.g., bathing and swimming) and alter consumption
    habits, facilitating the unintended ingestion of oocysts (Ikiroma and Pollock,
    2021). During extreme weather incidents (e.g., heavy rainfall, floods, sea-level
    rise) and following the entrance of faecal and manure particles into water, drinking
    water resources can be contaminated with infectious pathogens (Bashir et al.,
    2020; Betancourt and Rose, 2004; Levy et al., 2016). The faecal contamination
    of drinking water sources and food products is reportedly concomitant with heavy
    rainfall events (Kostyla et al., 2015; Levy et al., 2016). The transfer of pathogens
    from agricultural animal waste to surface waters due to runoff during rainfall
    events is a national concern for water quality in the USA (Fayer, 2004). Research
    has revealed a substantial increase in the concentration of Cryptosporidium oocysts
    in both drinking water and surface water sources during wet seasons and the runoff
    from rainfall (Britton et al., 2010; Daraei et al., 2021; Jagai et al., 2009;
    Young et al., 2015). Moreover, heavy rainfall and river flooding may contribute
    to epidemics of waterborne gastrointestinal infections (Gertler et al., 2015).
    There is strong evidence regarding the wide range of seasonal peaks of cryptosporidiosis,
    primarily associated with geographic location, precipitation, temperature, climate
    patterns (e.g., heavy rainfall), and agricultural/human waste production (Levy
    et al., 2016; Chique et al., 2020). The seasonal fluctuation in the occurrence
    and concentration of Cryptosporidium in different water bodies depends on water
    temperature, parasite species and source dispersal, type of water use (agriculture,
    waste, household), and runoff water (Koompapong and Sukthana, 2012). A possible
    reason for seasonal variations in the incidence of intestinal pathogens in surface
    water depends on the contamination source and the factors letting the contaminants
    reach the surface water bodies. For instance, zoonotic enteric pathogens are frequently
    detected in high numbers during floods, extreme rainfall, and pasture seasons
    after snowmelt when related to agricultural runoff (Horman et al., 2004). The
    frequency of Cryptosporidium contamination in aquatic environments has different
    seasonal patterns and is most dominant in summer, autumn, and winter when the
    highest rate of occurrence and concentrations of oocysts are observed (Bodley-Tickell
    et al., 2002; Lapen et al., 2016; Nasser, 2016; Strathmann et al., 2016). The
    autumn/winter peak of oocysts can be attributed to autumn application of manure
    in agricultural fields, agricultural discharges caused by heavy rains, the presence
    of migrating birds in cold seasons, and the incidence of hydrological processes
    that mobilize contaminants in faeces which accumulate during summer (Bodley-Tickell
    et al., 2002; Koompapong and Sukthana, 2012; Lapen et al., 2016). Nevertheless,
    some monitoring studies have observed spring/summer peaks in the concentrations
    of oocysts. In the US, most waterborne outbreaks are associated with failure in
    water treatment plants after spring runoff events (Levy et al., 2016). However,
    in some cases, the low concentration in spring may be related to the effects of
    dilution and flushing coupled with spring freshets and the seasonal features of
    faecal contaminants entering surface waters (Lapen et al., 2016). Furthermore,
    seasonal patterns may correlate with the parasite species (genotypes), as it has
    shown that C. parvum peaks arise in late spring, whereas C. hominis peaks occur
    in autumn (Gallas-Lindemann et al., 2013). Long-term climate change also affects
    the seasonal patterns of infectious diseases and extends transmission cycles (Jagai
    et al., 2009). Climate change intensifies the transport of pathogens to surface
    waters through being involved in sewer overflow, increased runoff, and resuspension
    of contaminants from sediments due to extreme precipitation, increased winter
    precipitation, and changes in evapotranspiration (Islam et al., 2021; Sterk et
    al., 2016). Increased runoff and frequent leaching of animal faeces from agricultural
    farms have resulted in many waterborne disease outbreaks, exacerbated during high
    precipitation periods (Ananna et al., 2021; Levy et al., 2016). Precipitation
    can affect the movement and distribution of disease-causing agents, mainly through
    water sources. In addition, temperature determines the growth and survival of
    waste-derived pathogens in the soil and their subsequent transport via overland
    flow after applying faecal waste on land (Cissé, 2019; Sterk et al., 2016). Temperature
    and precipitation are two substantial predictors of Cryptosporidium contamination,
    particularly in regions with tropical climates (Jagai et al., 2009). 5. Cryptosporidium
    spp. in fresh fruits, vegetables, and related food products Unsafe food accounts
    for nearly 600 million foodborne diseases and approximately 420,000 annual deaths
    (Eslahi et al., 2023). It is estimated that 30 % of total foodborne deaths occur
    in children under five. According to WHO reports, the consumption of unsafe food
    results in the loss of 33 million years of healthy life worldwide each year, and
    this rate is probably underestimated (Milinovich and Klieve, 2011). The increased
    incidence of foodborne parasitic diseases has been revealed to be a consequence
    of old-fashioned agricultural practices, wild animals, poor sanitary facilities,
    disregard for sanitation rules by food service staff, globalization of the food
    industry, growth in worldwide food trade, convenient travel, the rise in the number
    of vulnerable individuals (e.g. aging, severely malnourished, and HIV-infected),
    changes in lifestyle and food habits, modified cooking practices, and advanced
    diagnostic techniques (Stryiński et al., 2020). The European Food Safety Authority
    reported 4005 foodborne outbreaks in the European Union (EU) in 2021, a 29.8 %
    increase compared to 2020. Furthermore, foodborne parasitic infections account
    for >1000 human cases reported annually in the EU (www.efsa.europa.eu). Although
    the European Union has implemented regulations for some foodborne parasites, there
    are still no published standards for protozoan parasites in food products (Stryiński
    et al., 2020). Cryptosporidium is among the most prominent foodborne parasites
    documented as the etiological agent in both waterborne and foodborne outbreaks
    reports (Karanis, 2018). Food-borne outbreak of cryptosporidiosis have been recorded
    since the beginning of the 1980s, and have been associated with an increase in
    reports of this infection in human populations (Ortega and Cama, 2008). Table
    2 shows the reports of Cryptosporidium spp. on vegetables, fruits and other other
    food products. However, the most well-known foodborne outbreak of Cryptosporidium
    infection was reported in October 1993 in central Maine, caused by drinking fresh
    pressed apple cider. The report indicated that Cryptosporidium oocysts in apple
    cider were also found on the cider press and in the faecal samples of a calf from
    the same farm where the apples were provided (Millard et al., 1994). Based on
    the current joint risk ranking of foodborne parasites by the WHO and FAO, Cryptosporidium
    is regarded as a significant foodborne pathogen, rated fifth among 24 potentially
    foodborne parasites (Ryan et al., 2018). Furthermore, Cryptosporidium is estimated
    to be among the top-five parasites out of 24 prioritized foodborne parasites in
    Europe (Bouwknegt et al., 2018; van der Giessen et al., 2021). Table 2. Reports

    Italy Barlaam et al., 2022 Given the growing number of cryptosporidiosis outbreaks,
    the food industry has paid great attention to Cryptosporidium spp. (McKerr et
    al., 2015, McKerr et al., 2018). However, most attacks caused by foodborne infections
    have been poorly examined, never recognized, or unreported. In the last 30 years,
    26 outbreaks related to food-transmitted Cryptosporidium have been documented
    in countries in northern Europe, the UK, and the USA (Karanis, 2018). The few
    reports of foodborne outbreaks caused by Cryptosporidium may be attributable to
    underreporting and underestimation (Gopfert et al., 2022). The lack of information
    on foodborne cryptosporidiosis may be attributed to several factors, including
    inadequate epidemiological research, the unavailability of outbreak specimens,
    the absence of a reliable diagnostic method for detecting low concentrations of
    Cryptosporidium oocysts in suspected samples, and the prolonged incubation period
    of the parasite (Budu-Amoako et al., 2011). Regardless of their potential health
    advantages, the consumption of fresh or undercooked vegetables has increasingly
    been identified as a source of foodborne infections resulting from different microbial
    pathogens (Li et al., 2020). In many countries, the demand for raw fruits and
    vegetables out of the season leads to the transportation of thousands of miles
    from growing areas to suppliers in various regions. This trend can result in foodborne
    disease outbreaks in several places simultaneously (Milinovich and Klieve, 2011).
    In recent years, a substantial increase in the incidence of foodborne diseases
    has been linked to the consumption of fresh vegetables (Ryan et al., 2018). Furthermore,
    foodborne disease outbreaks associated with contaminated fruits and vegetables
    are increasing globally (Tripathi et al., 2014). Enteric pathogens on vegetables
    and fruits may originate from irrigation water and/or soil contaminated with livestock
    manure, human faeces, raw sewage, or directly via animals during growth and irrigation,
    or even following unsafe storage and processing (Badri et al., 2022; Nasser, 2022).
    Moreover, vegetable and fruit risk contamination is caused by improper sanitary
    conditions during harvest and transport, marketing, and preparation by an infected
    consumer or food handler (Eraky et al., 2014). Foodborne infections are often
    associated with the consumption of raw produce contaminated by infected food handlers
    or sewage water (Milinovich and Klieve, 2011). Oocyst shedding may last >60 days
    after the termination of symptoms, concluding that infected food handlers can
    be a potential contamination source for foodstuffs even a long time after the
    diarrhoea subsides (Ryan et al., 2018). Other risk factors for contamination of
    vegetables and fruits include the application of inappropriately prepared composts
    and animal manure in agricultural fields, using night soils (faecal sludge), and
    irrigation with inadequately treated wastewater (Eslahi et al., 2022). A worldwide
    meta-analysis indicated that vegetable and fruit samples obtained from regions
    with lower economic status displayed the most significant incidence of protozoan
    parasite contamination. Consequently, Southeast Asia has the highest contamination
    rate (Badri et al., 2022). Fresh produce could be a potential vehicle for transmitting
    Cryptosporidium parasites if consumed under inappropriate conditions (Karanis,
    2018). In North America, Cryptosporidium spp. was the cause of critical outbreak
    cases due to contaminated fruits and vegetables imported from tropical areas,
    where pickers'' sanitary settings and personal hygiene are poor and untreated
    wastewater is used for irrigation purposes (Pozio, 2020). Moreover, contamination
    of fresh produce has been implicated in several large outbreaks of Cryptosporidium
    in European countries (Åberg et al., 2015; Ethelberg et al., 2009; McKerr et al.,
    2015; Pönka et al., 2009). The CDC''s surveillance system recorded that 120 multi-state
    foodborne outbreaks occurred in the US between 2010 and 2014, of which 17 cases
    were related to fruits, 15 cases involved vegetables (row crops), 10 instances
    included sprouts, and nine were related to seeded vegetables (such as cucumbers
    and mini peppers) (Riggio et al., 2019). Cryptosporidium spp. are widespread throughout
    the American continent and are a major cause of outbreaks of diarrhoea associated
    with water, ranking as the third leading cause of diarrhoea linked to animal contact
    in the United States. Between 2009 and 2017, 7465 cases were reported by 40 states
    and Puerto Rico. Over this period, the reported outbreaks showed an average annual
    increase of approximately 13 %. The primary contributors to these outbreaks include
    the ingestion of contaminated water in pools, direct contact with infected cattle,
    and exposure to infected individuals in childcare settings (Gharpure et al., 2019).
    Cryptosporidium oocysts are highly stable and capable of remaining viable in aquatic
    environments (e.g. surface waters) and soil for two years. In addition to their
    resistance to unfavourable environmental conditions, disinfectants and their ability
    to penetrate drinking water filters facilitate human exposure to contaminated
    water and food (Li et al., 2020). Low temperatures do not affect the survival
    of oocysts on fruits and vegetables, allowing them to remain potentially infectious
    in household refrigerators for several days to weeks. Oocysts, typically sticky
    on the surface, can persist and survive on the leaves of plants during growth,
    but they are resistant to intense washing and the use of disinfectants (Hohweyer
    et al., 2016; Kubina et al., 2023). In addition, the stomata of fresh leafy vegetables
    and fruits may enable oocysts to survive and be protected (Ryan et al., 2018).
    The most probable cause of the higher prevalence of parasitic contamination in
    vegetables is the large contact surface area of leafy vegetables, which increases
    the chances of exposure to parasitic agents (Karshima, 2018). Although there is
    a potential for infection by consuming contaminated food, the methods used to
    recover and detect Cryptosporidium oocysts from fruits and vegetables are often
    insufficient due to inconsistent recovery rates and high expenses. Among the various
    types of leafy greens, spinach (Spinacia oleracea) is frequently contaminated
    and has been linked to C. parvum outbreaks. The recovery of Cryptosporidium oocysts
    from challenging samples, such as spinach with saponin-rich leaves, has been improved
    by the refinement of existing protocols using an alkaline 1 M glycine buffer (Razakandrainibe
    et al., 2020). Real-time PCR (qPCR) is a suitable technique for detecting parasitic
    oocysts in contaminated plant products with low concentrations of oocysts (Ahmed
    and Karanis, 2018). An accurate method that integrates cell culture and quantitative
    PCR (CC-qPCR) has been developed to detect infective C. parvum oocysts recovered
    from lamb''s lettuce, capable of detecting even a single infective oocyst (Kubina
    et al., 2021). Furthermore, nested multiplex PCR (mPCR) offers a fast, easy, and
    cost-effective approach for identifying protozoan pathogens in fresh produce (Shapiro
    et al., 2019). The cultivation of vegetables using non-polluting agricultural
    practices, organic farming techniques, and manure-based fertilizers has gained
    considerable attention. However, the source of the collected manure (farm animal
    faeces) may contain oocysts or may be indirectly contaminated with human waste.
    Flood irrigation methods for growing vegetables, primarily used in rural regions,
    can contaminate vegetables sold in markets and could be responsible for outbreaks
    (Li et al., 2020). Farm-to-fork is a concept for ensuring food safety, and it
    concentrates on all food production levels with control measures from farmland
    to consumers'' forks or drinking cups (Boyer and Kuczynska, 2010). According to
    FAO guidelines, the surveillance of foodborne diseases is a high priority for
    the development of food safety infrastructure. A global approach should be coordinated
    in order to support and strengthen national, regional, and international monitoring.
    As suggested by the FAO, critical strategies for advanced management of international
    foodborne diseases include establishing consistent laboratory training and related
    techniques, training for emergency preparedness, strengthened communication networks,
    and database development. In conclusion, agricultural producers should take appropriate
    measures to prevent foodstuffs from being contaminated by infectious pathogens
    in the farm environment (Millard et al., 1994). Properly washing raw vegetables
    and different chemical or radiation procedures are highly recommended for disinfection
    or sterilization of vegetables and fruits. The public health sector should raise
    awareness of the risk factors for transmitting foodborne parasites that contaminate
    fruits and vegetables. Foodborne outbreak investigations and monitoring of food-transmitted
    pathogens are fundamental concerns in food safety systems (FAO, 2020; Stryiński
    et al., 2020). Validated methodologies are required to accurately detect foodborne
    parasites (Chalmers et al., 2020). 6. Cryptosporidium spp. in animals 6.1. Cryptosporidium
    infection in cattle Cryptosporidiosis has serious animal health and economic implications
    for livestock production (de Graaf et al., 1999). Bovines are the most critical
    animal group infected with Cryptosporidium, probably due to their economic importance
    (Oliveira et al., 2021; Santín, 2013; Thomson et al., 2017). Cattle production
    is one of the most important agricultural industries worldwide. There are various
    species of farmed bovines, including cattle (Bos taurus), zebu (Bos taurus indicus),
    and water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis). Bovine cryptosporidiosis has been reported
    worldwide (Robertson et al., 2014; Santín et al., 2008), and Cryptosporidium infections
    in bovines give rise to clinical manifestations including diarrhoea, abdominal
    discomfort, nausea, emesis, and reduced body mass. Nonetheless, cattle conditions
    are generally non-fatal (Santín, 2013). Cryptosporidium induces diarrhoea, particularly
    in young specimens, notably in neonatal dairy calves aged 1–3 weeks, due to low
    immunity (Doungmala et al., 2019; Nydam and Mohammed, 2005). In neonatal dairy
    calves, the clinical indications for cryptosporidiosis may range from mild to
    severe diarrhoea, accompanied by manifestations such as lethargy, loss of appetite,
    pyrexia, and profound dehydration (Castro-Hermida et al., 2002). Calves can recover
    4–6 weeks after infection with Cryptosporidium (Olson et al., 2004). A mortality
    rate of 35.5 % has been reported in animals younger than 30 days (Singh et al.,
    2006). The initial documentation of bovine cryptosporidiosis dates back to 1971,
    when it was reported that an eight-month-old-heifer experienced persistent diarrhoea
    (Panciera et al., 1971). Subsequently, Cryptosporidium spp. have become a frequent
    discovery on farms, occurring in cattle herds with calf diarrhoea issues and those
    without such problems. Recent studies have suggested that the most frequently
    encountered Cryptosporidium spp. in cattle are C. bovis, C. parvum, C. andersoni,
    and C. ryanae (Fayer et al., 2005; Fayer et al., 2008, Fayer et al., 2009; Lindsay
    et al., 2000). Of the four species mentioned, C. parvum and C. bovis were the
    most commonly identified in calves. The oocysts of C. andersoni were comparatively
    prominent, whereas those of C. parvum, C. bovis, and C. ryanae were similar in
    size and shape. Molecular methods have been used for species identification (Fayer
    et al., 2005, Fayer et al., 2008). In numerous studies conducted worldwide, C.
    parvum has been consistently found to be the predominant species infecting pre-weaned
    calves (Fayer et al., 2007; Santín et al., 2004; Santín, 2013). C. bovis and C.
    ryanae are primarily found in post-weaned calves (Fayer et al., 2010a), and C.
    andersoni infects the abomasum of juvenile and adult animals and occasionally
    young calves (Kváč et al., 2008; Lindsay et al., 2000; Olson et al., 2004; Santín,
    2013). Age-related patterns of Cryptosporidium species have been extensively documented
    in the scientific literature (Fayer et al., 2006, Fayer et al., 2007). C. bovis
    and C. ryanae do not cause clinical diarrhoea in cattle (Fayer et al., 2005; Santín,
    2013). Although C. parvum is often considered a primary pathogen in cryptosporidiosis
    cases in calves, reports suggest that C. bovis may also possess pathogenic potential.
    A study conducted in Sweden reported the presence of C. bovis as a single pathogen
    in diarrheal samples from calves aged >21 days (Silverlås et al., 2013). This
    indicates that C. bovis may cause disease and contribute to the clinical symptoms
    in older calves. C. bovis was first described in cattle in 2002 as a new genotype
    (Cryptosporidium genotype bovine B) (Xiao et al., 2002). Three years later, this
    species was officially recognized by the scientific community (Fayer et al., 2005).
    C. bovis οocysts measures are 4.76–5.35 × 4.17–4.76 μm, with a mean size of 4.89
    × 4.63 μm. After the experimental infection, the prepatent period of C. bovis
    was determined to be ten days (Fayer et al., 2005). C. bovis develops in the small
    intestine. It is often found in older animals and has uncertain clinical significance.
    Cattle are the most common hosts for C. bovis (Åberg et al., 2019; Firoozi et
    al., 2019; Lichtmannsperger et al., 2020; Ryan and Power, 2012; Yildirim et al.,
    2020), whereas human infection with C. bovis has been reported in a few cases
    (Khan et al., 2010; Ryan et al., 2014; Ryan and Hijjawi, 2015). In 2004, C. ryanae
    was first described in the USA, as the Cryptosporidium deer-like genotype (Santín
    et al., 2004). C. ryanae, although never detected in deer, was named because of
    its 99.5 % similarity to previously reported deer genotype in the 18S rRNA gene
    locus (Xiao et al., 2002). Four years later, it was officially recognized as a
    species and designated C. ryanae (Fayer et al., 2008). With dimensions of 2.94–4.41
    μm × 2.94–3.68 μm and an average size of 3.16 × 3.73 μm, C. ryanae is one of the
    smallest known Cryptosporidium species (Fayer et al., 2008). Notably, C. ryanae
    has been identified worldwide (Åberg et al., 2019; Fayer et al., 2008; Feng et
    al., 2012; Jang et al., 2023; Lichtmannsperger et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020;
    Yildirim et al., 2020). In addition to domestic cattle, C. ryanae has been detected
    in zebu cattle and buffalos (Feng et al., 2012). It is essential to mention that
    C. ryanae does not possess zoonotic potential, meaning that it is not known to
    be transmissible to humans (Khan et al., 2018; Ryan et al., 2014). On the other
    hand, C. andersoni was first identified in cattle in 2000 (Lindsay et al., 2000).
    Oocysts are similar to those of C. muris described in mice, but larger than those
    of C. parvum. The size of C. andersoni oocysts is 6.0–8.1 × 5.0–6.5 μm, with a
    mean of 7.4 × 5.5 μm. It is notable that it is perceptibly more substantial than
    the other three species commonly found in cattle. This distinctive characteristic
    makes it easier to identify C. andersoni than other Cryptosporidium species through
    microscopy. Its large size aids in visual distinction, facilitating its recognition
    during microscopic examination (Lindsay et al., 2000). C. andersoni has been reported
    worldwide (Enemark et al., 2002; Firoozi et al., 2019; Jang et al., 2023; Mirzai
    et al., 2014; Ralston et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2013), and it is predominantly
    observed in young stock and adult animals, as reported in studies (Santín et al.,
    2004). In some countries, C. andersoni has been detected in pre-weaned calves
    (Jang et al., 2023; Kváč et al., 2011). Interestingly, infections caused by this
    parasite are frequently asymptomatic and post-mortem changes are not commonly
    observed (Kvác and Vítovec, 2003; Ralston et al., 2010). However, clinical signs
    of infection with C. andersoni in adult cows are characterized by weight gain
    and milk yield reduction, as documented in previous studies (Ralston et al., 2010).
    These clinical manifestations indicate the presence of C. andersoni in the adult
    cattle. C. andersoni has also been isolated from humans (Jiang et al., 2014; Leoni
    et al., 2006; Morse et al., 2007). C. parvum oocysts were first described in mice
    in 1912 (Tyzzer, 1912). Mature oocysts were ovoidal or spheroidal with a mean
    size of 5.41 μm × 4.93 μm (Fayer et al., 2008; Upton and Current, 1985). C. parvum
    is very common in young calves and it is the most frequently encountered species
    in diarrhoeic calves. However, it is often considered less severe and is associated
    with lower mortality rates than other Cryptosporidium species (Fayer et al., 2009).
    Cryptosporidium species are commonly associated with diarrhoea in young bovine
    calves and are the most critical Cryptosporidium species, causing economic losses
    (Santín et al., 2008). C. parvum can cause diarrhoea in calves, but may not always
    lead to severe clinical signs and adverse outcomes (Geurden et al., 2007; Silverlås
    et al., 2013). Clinical symptoms, such as watery diarrhoea, anorexia, fever, depression,
    and, in severe cases, even death, are primarily observed in calves up to six weeks
    of age (Robertson et al., 2014). C. parvum inhabits the small intestine, is the
    most common species in young calves, and is the cause of significant disease in
    this age group. The higher prevalence of Cryptosporidium infections among the
    younger age groups of livestock animals, including farm animals, can be attributed
    to the susceptibility of newborns. Cryptosporidium is a significant concern in
    newborn farm animals, primarily because it possesses an undeveloped immune system
    during the early stages of life (Danladi and Ugbomoiko, 2015; Santín, 2013). Calves
    are particularly susceptible to C. parvum infection because of their ability to
    acquire oocysts directly after birth. Early exposure to Cryptosporidium oocysts
    makes them highly vulnerable to infection, and clinical symptoms can manifest
    as early as three days post-infection (Santín et al., 2008). Notably, C. parvum
    is not limited to bovines; it is pathogenic to a wide range of animal species,
    including humans (Ryan et al., 2014; Ryan and Hijjawi, 2015). On the other hand,
    C. bovis, C. andersoni, and C. ryanae have a more restricted host range and are
    primarily found in cattle. Cattle are the primary reservoir for C. parvum, and
    the infection is common among calves worldwide (Lichtmannsperger et al., 2020;
    Ryan and Power, 2012; Yildirim et al., 2020). This widespread presence in cattle
    has significant implications for the epidemiology and transmission of C. parvum
    to various susceptible hosts including humans. It has zoonotic potential and can
    be transmitted to humans through the faecal-oral route, primarily during direct
    or indirect contact with infected animals (Ryan et al., 2014). Table 3 shows the
    cases of Cryptosporidium spp. infection in cattle. Table 3. Cryptosporidium spp.

    et al., 1996 Apart from the four widespread species previously mentioned, sporadic
    natural infections with various Cryptosporidium species and genotypes have been
    detected in cattle (Robertson et al., 2014). These include C. felis, C. hominis,
    C. scrofarum, C. serpentis, C. suis, and C. suis-like genotypes. Interestingly,
    C. felis and C. hominis have also been reported in cows (Bornay-Llinares et al.,
    1999; Smith et al., 2005). In France, Cryptosporidium infections have been detected
    in calves ranging from 3 to 7 weeks of age. However, it is noteworthy that no
    clinical disease was observed in calves infected with C. hominis (Razakandrainibe
    et al., 2018). Furthermore, experimental infections have shown that C. canis,
    typically associated with dogs, can infect cattle (Fayer et al., 2001). In addition
    C. ubiquitum has been experimentally transmitted to cattle and it was rarely found
    in people in England and Wales (Fayer et al., 2010b). 6.2. Cryptosporidium infection
    in small ruminants The economic significance of sheep (Ovis aries) and goats (Capra
    aegagrus hircus) in the global agricultural industry cannot be overstated as they
    play a crucial role in providing meat, milk, and wool. However, Cryptosporidium
    infection poses a significant challenge for small domestic ruminants, such as
    sheep and goats, especially during the neonatal stages. These infections are the
    primary cause of neonatal diarrhoea, resulting in high morbidity and mortality
    rates in lambs. Neonatal diarrhoea is one of the most prevalent and costly diseases
    affecting small ruminants. Cryptosporidium is a significant enteropathogen, and
    its association with this enteric condition has been well documented in scientific
    literature (Angus et al., 1982; Sari et al., 2009). Controlling and managing Cryptosporidium
    infection in sheep and goats is of the utmost importance to ensure the health
    and productivity of these valuable animals in the agricultural sector. The primary
    clinical sign of cryptosporidiosis in sheep and goats is diarrhoea, although anorexia,
    depression, and abdominal pain may also be present (Paul et al., 2014). Cryptosporidium
    infection in sheep was first described in 1974 in Australia in 1- to 3-week-old
    lambs with diarrhoea (Barker and Carbonell, 1974). In goats, infection by this
    agent was first reported six years later, also in Australia, in a 2-week-old child
    with diarrhoea (Mason et al., 1981). Ovine cryptosporidiosis has been reported
    worldwide (Dessì et al., 2020; Kaupke et al., 2017; Lang et al., 2023; Paraud
    and Chartier, 2012; Santín et al., 2007). In sheep, the identification of several
    Cryptosporidium species and genotypes varies across studies and is influenced
    by the age of the animals. Among the dominant Cryptosporidium species found in
    sheep and goats C. parvum, C. ubiquitum, and C. xiaoi are known to cause mild
    to severe diarrhoea and even mortality in these animals (Díaz et al., 2010a; Díaz
    et al., 2010b; Imre et al., 2013; Guo et al., 2021). C. xiaoi was initially characterized
    in sheep in 2009 (Fayer and Santín, 2009). Its oocysts resemble those of C. bovis
    but are slightly smaller, measuring 2.94–4.41 μm × 2.94–4.41 μm (mean = 3.94 μm
    × 3.44 μm), with a length/width shape index of 1.15 (Fayer and Santín, 2009).
    Sporadic infections with C. bovis (sheep), C. hominis (goats), C. suis, C. andersoni
    (sheep and goats), C. fayeri, and C. scrofarum have been reported (Karanis et
    al., 2007; Koinari et al., 2014; Ryan et al., 2005; Santín, 2013; Yang et al.,
    2014). Cryptosporidium oocysts are predominantly observed in very young lambs,
    typically between one and three weeks of age, with a lower incidence in older
    animals (Causapé et al., 2002; Majewska et al., 2000; Sari et al., 2009). In lambs
    older than one month, Cryptosporidium infections are generally subclinical, meaning
    that they do not exhibit overt clinical symptoms. However, subclinical infections
    can occur even in younger animals, which means they are infected but do not show
    apparent signs of illness. Despite the lack of noticeable clinical symptoms, Cryptosporidium
    infections can affect animals. Infected lambs may experience a reduced body condition
    score, potentially affecting their overall productivity (Sweeny et al., 2011,
    Sweeny et al., 2012). Cryptosporidium infection was detected in all age groups
    of goats. However, the prevalence of infection and illness is notably higher in
    kids (Paraud and Chartier, 2012). Caprine cryptosporidiosis primarily affects
    young goats aged 0–2 months. The prepatent period, which is the time between infection
    and the appearance of oocysts in faeces, was approximately four days. Clinical
    symptoms are more pronounced in young children, indicating that the disease manifests
    more severely in this age group (Paul et al., 2014). Generally, the prevalence
    increased until sheep and goats were 5–6 weeks of age and then gradually declined.
    Sheep cryptosporidiosis poses a significant risk to public health. Small ruminants,
    including sheep, can serve as potential reservoirs of Cryptosporidium, contributing
    to the transmission of this parasite to humans (Koinari et al., 2014). Sheep and
    goats are reservoirs of C. hominis and C. parvum (Imre et al., 2013; Lange et
    al., 2014; Ryan et al., 2005). Outbreaks of Cryptosporidium infection in schoolchildren
    have been linked to contact with lambs and goats (Lange et al., 2014). This highlights
    the zoonotic potential of Cryptosporidium, in which the parasite can be transmitted
    from animals to humans, causing infections in susceptible individuals. Californian
    scientists have proposed several measures to reduce the shedding of zoonotic Cryptosporidium
    in sheep and minimize the risk of transmission. These measures effectively manage
    lamb health, prevent contact between sheep and cattle, and ensure the utilization
    of safe drinking water sources for sheep (Li et al., 2022). By implementing these
    preventive strategies, a significant contribution can be made to protect the health
    of animals and humans. Table 4 shows the cases of Cryptosporidium spp. infection
    in sheep and goats. Table 4. Cryptosporidium spp. detection in faecal samples

    Cryptosporidium reservoir, and Cryptosporidium affects pigs of all ages (Chen
    et al., 2023). Cryptosporidium infections in domestic pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus)
    have been extensively documented globally (Budu-Amoako et al., 2012; Chen et al.,
    2023; Farzan et al., 2011; Johnson et al., 2008; Kváč et al., 2009a, Kváč et al.,
    2009b; Li et al., 2022; Petersen et al., 2015). Initial reports of Cryptosporidium
    infections in domestic pigs were reported by Berglund in the USA (Bergeland, 1977;
    Kennedy et al., 1977). C. suis, C. parvum, C. muris, C. andersoni, C. scrofarum
    (previously known as Cryptosporidium pig genotype II), and C. tyzzeri (previously
    known as Cryptosporidium mouse genotype I) have been isolated from pigs (Zheng
    et al., 2019). Recent research has shown that C. suis and C. scrofarum display
    host specificity, indicating that they are more specifically adapted to infect
    pigs. Additionally, C. scrofarum exhibits age-specific patterns of infection (Jeníková
    et al., 2011; Kváč et al., 2013; Ryan et al., 2004a). The oocysts of C. scrofarum
    have dimensions measuring 4.81–5.96 μm (with a mean of 5.16 μm) in length and
    4.23–5.29 μm (with a mean of 4.83 μm) in width, resulting in a length-to-width
    ratio of 1.07 ± 0.06. These specific morphological characteristics help to differentiate
    C. scrofarum from other Cryptosporidium species in pigs. Oocysts of C. suis have
    dimensions measuring 4.9–4.4 μm (with a mean of 4.6 μm) in length and 4.0–4.3
    μm (with a mean of 4.2 μm) in width, resulting in a length-to-width ratio of 1.1
    (Kváč et al., 2013; Ryan et al., 2004a). C. suis exhibits a higher frequency of
    infection in pre-weaned pigs, whereas C. scrofarum is typically detected in older
    animals (Johnson et al., 2008; Kváč et al., 2009a; Langkjaer et al., 2007). Most
    Cryptosporidium-infected pigs were between 2 and 3 months of age, followed by
    animals aged 1–2 months, 3–5 months, and those <1 month. Various Cryptosporidium
    species have been detected in farm pigs, including C. parvum, C. muris, and C.
    tyzzeri, which are commonly associated with mice (Kváč et al., 2013). The sporadic
    occurrence of C. parvum in pigs offers evidence to support the potential role
    of pigs in the transmission of Cryptosporidium from animals to humans. Pigs serve
    as reservoir hosts for C. scrofarum and C. suis, which can induce cryptosporidiosis
    in human (Li et al., 2022). Table 5 presents the cases of Cryptosporidium spp.
    infection in pigs. Table 5. Cryptosporidium spp. detection in faecal samples of

    in most areas of the world suggest that livestock farms must be considered a public
    health threat, and proper control measures should be introduced. Variations in
    the prevalence of Cryptosporidium infections in pigs can be attributed to many
    factors. These factors include the size of the sample population, geographical
    region or location of the study, prevailing climatic conditions, age of the animals
    under investigation, specific diagnostic methods employed, pig breed, hygiene
    conditions maintained, and the overall management practices implemented (Santin,
    2020). 6.4. Cryptosporidium infection in fish Cryptosporidium species have been
    identified in various types of fish found in marine and freshwater environments,
    as well as in fish raised on farms, kept in captivity, and used as ornamental
    pets worldwide (Certad et al., 2020; Golomazou and Karanis, 2020). Consequently,
    aquatic environments are susceptible to contamination by agricultural runoff,
    rainwater, bathing activities, and sewage discharge (Ryan et al., 2014). The presence
    of parasites in marine habitats facilitates its distribution and transmission,
    whereas environmental aquatic substrate-associated biofilms serve as reservoirs,
    protecting the parasite within its matrices and surfaces (Masangkay et al., 2020).
    Direct transmission of the parasite has been confirmed in fish species such as
    the gilthead seabream and seabass, primarily through ingestion of mature oocysts
    released in faeces. Additionally, cannibalism and predation among infected and
    uninfected fish can also contribute to the spread of infection (Alvarez-Pellitero
    and Sitjà-Bobadilla, 2002; Sitjà-Bobadilla and Alvarez-Pellitero, 2003). Other
    aquatic organisms, such as eukaryotic organisms and macro-invertebrates, as well
    as live food such as Artemia and rotifers which are supplied to farmed fish, may
    act as reservoirs for Cryptosporidium species (Fayer et al., 2000b; Gómez-Couso
    et al., 2003; Méndez-Hermida et al., 2007; Reboredo-Fernández et al., 2014). Fish
    can host 11 known species of Cryptosporidium along with 29 additional genotypes
    specific to fish hosts. In contrast, other species and genotypes are specific
    to fish hosts, while others that are typically found in non-fish hosts, such as
    C. parvum, C. hominis, C. ubiquitum, C. scrofarum, C. xiaoi, and the rat genotype
    III, have also been detected in fish. The occurrence of non-fish-specific Cryptosporidium
    species in fish is likely attributed to the pollution of the aquatic ecosystem
    with disease-causing Cryptosporidium species originating from agricultural runoff
    and sewage discharge (Couso-Pérez et al., 2022; Golomazou et al., 2021; Moratal
    et al., 2022). Cryptosporidium infections have been documented in various farmed
    fish species in different regions. These include gilthead seabream and European
    seabass in Spain, turbot and rainbow trout in Spain, Murray cod in Australia,
    Asian seabass in Vietnam, Nile tilapia in Papua New Guinea, cichlids in Israel,
    and red drum in Louisiana, USA (Golomazou et al., 2021; Moratal et al., 2022;
    Reghaissia et al., 2022). When fish in aquaculture settings are exposed to Cryptosporidium,
    particularly under conditions of high stocking densities, temporarily unfavourable
    environmental factors, and specific farming practices, the prevalence of infection
    and mortality rates can be significantly elevated. This poses a notable concern
    for the global aquaculture industry, because Cryptosporidium can threaten aquatic
    hosts and humans, leading to negative economic consequences. Cryptosporidium infections
    in fish can trigger a robust stress response, compromising animal welfare and
    resulting in severe infections due to decreased immune competence. Harsh conditions
    are associated with impaired fish growth, pronounced pathological consequences,
    and elevated mortality rates (Alvarez-Pellitero et al., 2004; Sitjà-Bobadilla
    et al., 2005). Clinical and pathological signs of Cryptosporidium infection include
    listlessness, retarded growth, anorexia, and increased mortality, particularly
    in cases of heavy infections (Baragahare et al., 2011). Additionally, observations
    revealed muscle wasting, tissue atrophy, severe weight loss, enlargement of the
    coelomic cavities, and abdominal swelling (ascites). Necropsy indicates indigestion,
    intestinal distension due to the accumulation of mucus and gas in the intestines,
    and the presence of whitish faeces (Alvarez-Pellitero et al., 2004; Murphy et
    al., 2009; Zanguee et al., 2010). The histopathological effects of Cryptosporidium
    infection in fish tissues include necrosis, vacuolization, degradation, disaggregation,
    and shedding of epithelial cells (Baragahare et al., 2011). Severe inflammation,
    gastric mucosal epithelial cell necrosis, atrophy in the mucosal glandular, and
    reduction in glandular tissue may also be present (Ryan et al., 2004b). In severely
    infected fish, clusters of oocysts can be found in broad vacuolated areas within
    the lumen surrounded by enlarged macrophages (Alvarez-Pellitero and Sitjà-Bobadilla,
    2002). Massive infections can lead to severe intestinal lesions, and oocysts can
    cover the epithelial surface, distorting the tissue architecture. The presence
    of Cryptosporidium in aquatic environments and its potential transmission through
    fish consumption are notable fish-borne risk factors (Moratal et al., 2020). The
    inclusion of zoonotic Cryptosporidium species and subtypes in fish is a public
    health concern, emphasizing the association between fishborne cryptosporidiosis
    and the handling and consumption of infected fish (Certad et al., 2015; Couso-Pérez
    et al., 2018; Koinari et al., 2013; Reid et al., 2010; Ziarati et al., 2022).
    Among the zoonotic subtypes, C. parvum is the most identified source of zoonotic
    infections, and has been detected in numerous fish species and geographical regions,
    including wild and farmed edible fish. Although the prevalence of infections and
    diseases is generally low, trout species have exhibited the highest prevalence
    (Couso-Pérez et al., 2018, Couso-Pérez et al., 2019). Cryptosporidium in cultured
    trout is significant, mainly due to the stressful conditions associated with farming,
    such as increased fish density, which facilitates pathogen transmission (Alvarez-Pellitero
    et al., 2004). This is further compounded by the increased prevalence observed
    during the early growing stages, as fish have an undeveloped and immature immune
    system (Sitjà-Bobadilla et al., 2005). Moreover, the recent identification of
    C. ubiquitum, which is responsible for human infections, in the European sea bass
    in Spain shows an additional risk for consumers (Moratal et al., 2022). The detection
    of parasites in fish fillets is likely attributable to the fish preparation process,
    including potential contamination during evisceration and cleaning processes (Certad
    et al., 2015). This underscores the possibility of contamination of the edible
    parts of the fish from the digestive tract. Zoonotic Cryptosporidium species in
    edible fish broaden the spectrum of emerging foods responsible for cryptosporidiosis,
    emphasizing their potential threat to public health. Table 6 provides an overview

    Reghaissia et al., 2022 7. Zoonotic transmission of Cryptosporidium spp. - risk
    to farmers People in contact with wastewater have a heightened risk of gastrointestinal
    infection. Surprisingly, relatively less attention has been directed toward comprehending
    the threat faced by farmers routinely exposed to wastewater, particularly in the
    urban and peri-urban irrigation hubs used for food production. The absence of
    well-structured on-farm practices and utilization of suitable irrigation techniques,
    coupled with the lack of on-farm wastewater treatment, elevates the annual risk
    of infection to a tolerable threshold. There is a notable direct correlation between
    the calculated likelihood of farmers'' exposure and certain vital factors, such
    as the concentration of pathogens in irrigation water, the method employed for
    on-farm water treatment, the frequency of accidental wastewater ingestion, and
    the frequency of exposure to Cryptosporidium spp., as detailed by Sampson et al.
    (2017). It is essential to recognize that the infective dose remains a critical
    parameter, signifying a substantial risk, as it is challenging to precisely predict
    the quantity of Cryptosporidium spp. that may be ingested daily through unintentional
    wastewater consumption. Domestic animals infected with Cryptosporidium can serve
    as reservoirs for transmitting the infection to susceptible individuals, including
    humans. People working closely with farmed animals, such as farmers and vets,
    are at an increased risk of contracting infection. Individuals who handle animals
    on calf farms, such as calf handlers, face an increased risk of contracting diarrhoea
    due to cryptosporidiosis transmitted from infected calves. Cattle are considered
    a substantial reservoir and source of zoonotic infection because C. parvum subtypes
    that infect humans have been found in cattle (Xiao and Fayer, 2008). This highlights
    the potential for the transmission of Cryptosporidium from cattle to humans, posing
    a significant public health concern. C. parvum is an important zoonotic pathogen
    that can cause severe outbreaks of diarrhoea in industrialized countries, particularly
    in vulnerable populations such as immunocompromised individuals (e.g., HIV patients),
    children, and the elderly (Xiao and Feng, 2008). These groups are more susceptible
    to severe symptoms and complications following infection with Cryptosporidium.
    For immunocompromised individuals, additional precautions are necessary to prevent
    exposure to Cryptosporidium spp. It is advisable to restrict access to young animals
    and potentially even restrict their access to farms to minimize the risk of infection
    (Fayer et al., 2000a; Karanis et al., 2007). Applying a quantitative microbial
    risk assessment approach revealed a notable incidence of waterborne pathogens
    affecting urban farmers use wastewater for agricultural and aquaculture purposes.
    In Africa, the prevalence of Cryptosporidium among farmers exhibits a spectrum
    that aligns with the expected range derived from previous prevalence reports on
    Cryptosporidium infections in children and adults (Squire et al., 2017). In specific
    instances, dairy farm labourers have exhibited a significant parasite prevalence,
    as documented by Siwila et al. (2007). Notably, within these farm environments,
    C. parvum was identified in 75 % of the individuals who tested positive among
    farm workers and 60 % of household members. This observation points to the possibility
    of zoonotic transmission on these farms, stemming from infected animals. In Pakistan,
    individuals cohabiting with domestic animals such as cows, sheep, buffaloes, and
    goats appear to be at a heightened risk of infection. The highest prevalence rates
    have been observed among individuals close to domestic animals and those with
    suspected human interactions, particularly in areas where cows, buffalos, and
    other domesticated animals frequently access and utilize surface water sources,
    including rivers, streams, and canals (Khan et al., 2019). In Vietnam, the prevalence
    of gastrointestinal infections has led to a significant disease burden, which
    is notably higher among farmers than in the general population. This disparity
    exceeds the revised WHO tolerable threshold by more than a hundredfold, as described
    by Fuhrimann et al. (2017). This divergence is expected given that farmers in
    developing nations engage in non-mechanized farming practices and frequently come
    into contact with infected animals. In contrast, in the United Kingdom, other
    European countries, New Zealand, and China, where intensive dairy farming practices
    are prevalent, the elevated prevalence of the disease is likely attributable to
    transmission via livestock, and C. parvum has assumed a more prominent role in
    causing cryptosporidiosis than C. hominis (Lebbad et al., 2011; Guo et al., 2021).
    Moreover, a potential risk is associated with handling fish that carry zoonotic
    Cryptosporidium species. This risk becomes more pronounced during the preparation
    and handling of fish as it facilitates parasite transmission. An evaluation of
    probabilistic risk, encompassing both fish and hand wash samples, indicated that
    fishermen are vulnerable to infection after fishing activities and the consumption
    of captured fish, a risk scenario substantiated by Roberts et al. (2007). This
    risk is further corroborated by C. parvum transmission, which was confirmed when
    handling blue crabs (Graczyk et al., 2007). 8. Prevention and mitigation strategies
    in primary production The One Health concept provides several prospects for preventing
    cryptosporidiosis, particularly regarding the infection caused by C. parvum and
    other zoonotic species that affect animal and human health (Innes et al., 2020).
    This approach can be primarily practical via: 1. Manure treatment to reduce oocyst
    viability. 2. Protection of water catchments from contamination with livestock
    faeces. 3. Prevention and control of infection in livestock. Effective reduction
    of oocyst viability can be achieved through practices such as slurry storage,
    precise composting of manure (where oocysts become inactive at temperatures exceeding
    60 °C), low pH and ammonia levels, and mesophilic and thermophilic anaerobic digestion
    processes (Vermeulen et al., 2017). Therefore, managing manure and slurry on farmlands
    can diminish the viability of Cryptosporidium oocysts and subsequently minimize
    the potential for infection in the environment, particularly in water catchments
    (Kay et al., 2012). Implementing comprehensive preventive and regulatory strategies
    aimed at mitigating cryptosporidiosis in livestock and adopting farm management
    practices to minimize environmental contamination with infectious oocysts yields
    significant positive outcomes in terms of animal health, welfare, and productivity.
    These measures provide economic benefits for livestock farmers on a global scale
    and mitigate parasite transmission by safeguarding the environment and water catchments
    (Innes et al., 2020). Effective management of surface runoff, excluding grazing
    animals from these areas, is essential in curbing the potential dissemination
    of oocysts into surface streams, employing management strategies that maintain
    high vegetation that allows heating and UV radiation penetration in the soil surface,
    leading to the inactivation of oocysts. Considering that a substantial portion
    of oocysts resides in the lower layers of forage, transitioning livestock to pastures
    with taller vegetation can reduce their exposure to oocysts and subsequently decrease
    infection rates and environmental contamination. Potential approaches to mitigate
    the substantial contamination risks posed to water resources, include canopy management
    techniques, wildlife management practices, and the implementation of short-cycle
    rotational grazing strategies to prevent infection and subsequent environmental
    pollution (Boyer and Kuczynska, 2010; Innes et al., 2020). Given the absence of
    an effective vaccine against cryptosporidiosis in livestock, disease prevention
    can be achieved by providing ample quantities of high-quality colostrum to newborn
    calves within the first few hours of life. Particular attention should be paid
    to segregating younger calves into age-specific groups, as they are particularly
    susceptible to infection by older calves. Infected calves should be isolated from
    healthy animals for at least one week after the cessation of diarrhoea to minimize
    transmission (Innes et al., 2020). Moreover, implementing measures such as regular
    sanitation of pens, ensuring deep and clean straw bedding, maintaining appropriate
    housing with elevated feeding and water troughs, and employing steam cleaning
    techniques are strongly recommended to minimize exposure of calves to faecal matter
    within the surrounding environment (Meganck et al., 2014). Disinfection with hydrogen
    peroxide can further reduce the proliferation of contaminated faeces on farms.
    At the same time, hydrated lime is indicated as an efficient disinfectant to reduce
    contamination in calf pens (Björkman et al., 2018; Innes et al., 2020). In addition,
    implementing vegetative surface treatments on livestock farms is an effective
    measure to provide soil stabilization during storm events. Straw mulch has emerged
    as a widely adopted technique for mitigating soil erosion resulting from soil
    particle entrainment and raindrop impact on bare soil surfaces (Miller et al.,
    2008). Implementing good agricultural practices and meticulous handling protocols,
    robust risk prevention measures, and adopting alternative decontamination methods
    are paramount to effectively prevent and mitigate outbreaks stemming from contaminated
    fresh produce. Furthermore, incorporating vegetative filter strips has consistently
    demonstrated their merit in reducing runoff and impeding pathogen transport of
    pathogens (Innes et al., 2020). In addition to the implementation of vegetated
    and riparian buffer strips, the strategic fencing of livestock to restrict their
    access to streams and other water bodies serves as a valuable measure to disrupt
    the Cryptosporidium oocysts in water resources (Kay et al., 2012). 9. Conclusion
    Agricultural settings can serve as a potential source of Cryptosporidium species
    contamination due to faecal matter from both humans and animals. Contamination
    from agricultural sources can lead to water pollution, affecting the water used
    for drinking, recreational activities, and irrigation. Cryptosporidium infections
    are of significant concern in farming practices, as they are closely linked to
    the production of fresh fruits, vegetables, terrestrial and aquatic animals, and
    public health. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a novel conceptual framework
    for the agricultural sector. Farmers are frequently exposed to wastewater, rendering
    them susceptible to an elevated risk of Cryptosporidium infections. It is imperative
    to establish an active policy framework that incorporates a multi-barrier strategy
    aimed at reducing farmer-wastewater interactions and mitigating disease risks.
    Implementing enhanced wastewater management regulations specifically designed
    to safeguard farmers and diminish their exposure to oocysts, is a vital requirement.
    The adoption of a proactive management approach is indispensable for effectively
    reducing the risks associated with such directions. The guidelines provided by
    the World Health Organization (WHO) regarding wastewater reuse present a comprehensive
    framework suitable for developing nations. These guidelines encompass a range
    of approaches that can be customized for local policies and cultural contexts.
    They were given priority in a multi-barrier strategy that focused on the mitigation
    of Cryptosporidium spp. The presence of accidental infection in farmers through
    the incorporation of appropriate measures to minimize direct sewage exposure is
    of utmost importance. Local policy directives play a vital role in successfully
    implementing this approach to effectively reduce infection risk among farmers.
    Farmers are pivotal in the agricultural sector, and implementing on-farm management
    measures can significantly mitigate the risk of Cryptosporidium spp. exposure,
    contingent upon providing comprehensive training to farmers. Research has consistently
    shown that well-informed farmers possess heightened awareness of the health hazards
    associated with urban farming and proactively adopt practices to diminish these
    risks, underscoring their enhanced proficiency in risk management. CRediT authorship

  description: Conducting risk and early warning assessments of heavy metals (HMs)
    pollution in agricultural soils holds significant importance for pollution prevention
    and sustainable agricultural development. Early warning studies on heavy metal
    contamination of agricultural soils in oases in arid zones are rare in previous
    studies, therefore, this study carried out spatial and temporal simulation and
    early warning studies on the environmental capacity of agricultural soils in the
    Hexi Corridor based on field monitoring data and remote sensing technology and
    other methods. The results revealed that agricultural soils have been affected
    by human activities, leaving HMs at a moderate pollution level. The mean environmental
    capacity indices for Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, As and Pb showed that they all belonged to
    the medium-capacity state, and 7.01 % of the sampling points being overloaded
    and in the low capacity for As. Cr, Ni, Zn and As were found in the moderate and
    high capacity zones located in the study area's western part, and the spatial
    distribution was basically the same. HMs in the middle parts area were dominated
    by low to medium capacity status, which may be related to agricultural activities
    such as application of fertilizers and pesticides and sewage irrigation. Based
    on the soil dynamic capacity model, it was found that in the next 20 years, HMs
    showed a decrease of 70–80 %, and the soil environment dynamic capacity was smaller
    than both the static and existing capacity, and it showed a decreasing trend with
    the change of time, which indicated that the soil's capacity for pollutants in
    the study area would be reduced if no pollution control measures were taken. Risk
    warning results showed that the overall spatial distribution pattern of the probability
    of pollution in the study area during the next 10 and 20 years was lower in the
    west and the northern part of Wuwei City, and higher in the middle part. This
    study suggests constructing a management system of “pollution evaluation - source
    treatment - risk early warning” for heavy metal contaminated sites, formulating
    corresponding policies and early warning measures, strengthening the research
    and development of monitoring, remediation, and treatment technologies, and realizing
    the prevention and control of agricultural soil pollution and sustainable development
    in the study area.

    metal pollution prevention and management measures were suggested. Abstract Conducting
    risk and early warning assessments of heavy metals (HMs) pollution in agricultural
    soils holds significant importance for pollution prevention and sustainable agricultural
    development. Early warning studies on heavy metal contamination of agricultural
    soils in oases in arid zones are rare in previous studies, therefore, this study
    carried out spatial and temporal simulation and early warning studies on the environmental
    capacity of agricultural soils in the Hexi Corridor based on field monitoring
    data and remote sensing technology and other methods. The results revealed that
    agricultural soils have been affected by human activities, leaving HMs at a moderate
    pollution level. The mean environmental capacity indices for Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, As
    and Pb showed that they all belonged to the medium-capacity state, and 7.01 %
    of the sampling points being overloaded and in the low capacity for As. Cr, Ni,
    Zn and As were found in the moderate and high capacity zones located in the study
    area''s western part, and the spatial distribution was basically the same. HMs
    in the middle parts area were dominated by low to medium capacity status, which
    may be related to agricultural activities such as application of fertilizers and
    pesticides and sewage irrigation. Based on the soil dynamic capacity model, it
    was found that in the next 20 years, HMs showed a decrease of 70–80 %, and the
    soil environment dynamic capacity was smaller than both the static and existing
    capacity, and it showed a decreasing trend with the change of time, which indicated
    that the soil''s capacity for pollutants in the study area would be reduced if
    no pollution control measures were taken. Risk warning results showed that the
    overall spatial distribution pattern of the probability of pollution in the study
    area during the next 10 and 20 years was lower in the west and the northern part

    capacitySpatio-temporal simulationEarly warning 1. Introduction Agricultural ecosystems
    are important in providing essential products and supply services to humans (Li
    et al., 2023), while the productivity of agroecosystems is largely influenced
    by the combined functional effects of soil characteristics (Aksakal et al., 2019).
    Maintaining or improving soil quality is therefore essential for the continued
    sustainable use of agro-ecosystems and for ecological balance (Andrews and Carroll,
    2001). However, with the heightened development of industrialization, the sustainable
    development and utilization of land resources has become a hot issue globally,
    especially in agricultural areas, where excessive human activities such as excessive
    use of fertilizers, irrational irrigation, and use of pesticides occur (Wang et
    al., 2018), which have serious impacts on the quality of the soil used for agriculture
    (Fierer et al., 2021, Zhang et al., 2023), which has potential risks for public
    health and ecosystems (Wang et al., 2018, Nabi, 2021) and challenges for the achievement
    of global sustainable development goals (Chai et al., 2023, Liu et al., 2023).
    Therefore, exploring HMs pollution and its future change trend is of great significance
    to achieve effective prevention and control of pollution. Soil is an irreplaceable
    and important resource for the survival and development of mankind, the basis
    of all agricultural activities, and the main depository of heavy metals (Cao et
    al., 2010). Heavy metal content in soil exceeding background values can lead to
    degradation of soil quality and ecological and environmental degradation (Davies,
    1980). In 2014, Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection stated in the “China
    Soil Pollution Survey Bulletin” that China''s total soil pollutant exceedance
    rate was 16.10 %, with arable land as high as 19.4 %. As one of the important
    oasis agricultural regions in the arid zone of northwest China, the Hexi Corridor
    has exhibited a non-negligible increasing trend of soil HMs levels in recent years
    (Guan et al., 2018). There is therefore a particular need for a spatial and temporal
    simulation and early warning of the environmental capacity of the soil for HMs
    in the region. Currently, several studies have been conducted on soil contamination
    and risk early warning using logistic regression (Guan et al., 2019a), contamination
    index (Chai et al., 2023), mass balance model (Zhang et al., 2019), spatial statistical
    interpolation (Chai et al., 2023), machine learning (Chen et al., 2023, Emamgholizadeh
    et al., 2023), etc. The performances of the above methods are quite different,
    but all of them can meet the needs of predicting the spatial and temporal changes
    of contaminants in soil (Li et al., 2020). But these methods can be constrained
    by data availability, take time, and depend on personal preferences and more.
    The environmental capacity of soil HMs refers to the maximum HMs pollution load
    that can be accommodated by the soil in a given environmental unit and in a given
    time period according to the environmental quality standards (Zhang and Wu, 2018,
    Pan et al., 2021). Since 1980, research on the environmental capacity of soil
    heavy metals has been conducted in China (Wu et al., 1981). These studies conducted
    a preliminary evaluation of the definition, evaluation methods, research framework
    and indicators of the environmental capacity of soil heavy metals. For example,
    the critical content of soil heavy metals was determined through multiple indicators
    and systems, and a corresponding dynamic environmental capacity model was established
    (Xia, 1994). Therefore, using the environmental capacity for HMs can determine
    the regional pollution status. However, relatively few studies have been conducted
    to evaluate soil heavy metal contamination of agricultural soils in arid zones
    using soil heavy metal environmental capacity (Fu et al., 2014, Zhang and Wu,
    2018, Tian et al., 2022), and the soil heavy metal environmental capacity of agricultural
    soils has not been systematically explored (Pan et al., 2021). To address these
    research limitations, this study used geostatistical analysis and environmental
    carrying capacity method to simulate the environmental carrying capacity of heavy
    metals in agricultural soils in the Hexi Corridor for early warning. The Dynamic
    Environmental Capacity Model, as an improved static environmental capacity model,
    can simulate the dynamic interaction between socio-economic and natural systems
    on a macro scale to express the spatial and temporal changes in soil environmental
    capacity. It also allows prediction of contaminant trends (ie, temporal trends
    of contaminant loading) and soil distribution patterns (Li et al., 2020). Spatio-temporal
    simulation can help us to understand and predict the trend of soil HMs contamination
    as an important tool to simulate the distribution of HMs at different temporal
    and spatial scales through the establishment of appropriate models and the collection
    of relevant data (Li et al., 2020), and provide a scientific basis for governmental
    departments and decision makers (Wang et al., 2020b). Due to its lower dependence
    on the transport and dispersion mechanisms of contaminants than traditional techniques,
    kriging was applied widely to model and predict the spatial and temporal distribution
    of soil HMs (Pan et al., 2021). In addition, the establishment of an early warning
    mechanism is crucial for the timely detection of and response to incidents of
    HMs contamination (Pan et al., 2021). Early warning of HMs contamination can be
    achieved by delineating contamination risk areas, proposing policy recommendations,
    and establishing an early warning system on this basis to predict the trend of
    contamination changes in a timely manner before the soil environmental quality
    worsened (Li et al., 2020). The soil-food nexus in the arid and semi-arid regions
    of northwestern China is very fragile, and agricultural soils have suffered some
    degree of heavy metal contamination (Guan et al., 2019). Especially with the gradual
    increase in the intensity of industrial and agricultural activities, the problem
    of heavy metal contamination of agricultural soils is more significant (Guan et
    al., 2018, Sun et al., 2019), and the resulting risks are more serious (Liu et
    al., 2022). Agricultural soil is closely related to food security, and once it
    is contaminated with heavy metals, it will seriously affect food security and
    stability. Therefore, research on assessment of soils HMs contamination, risk
    early warning and green development of agriculture in the Hexi corridor is of
    great importance in the context of food security. Compared with previous studies,
    this study investigated different heavy metal pollution and risk warning in farmland
    soils of typical agricultural production areas in arid zones of China, and proposed
    pollution control measures. This study has three main objectives: (1) To analyses
    the current situation of soil pollution and contamination in farmland in the Hexi
    Corridor. (2) To study the spatial and temporal dynamics of the HMs environmental
    capacity in the agricultural soils of the Hexi corridor and to provide early warning
    of the risks. (3) To propose measures for the reduction and containment of HMs
    pollution and for the early warning of risks to agricultural soils in the Hexi
    corridor. It will provide spatial and temporal characteristics of agricultural
    soils HMs environmental capacity, predict future trends, and provide scientific
    policy recommendations and measures for government agencies to promote soil health
    and support agricultural sustainable development. 2. Materials and methods 2.1.
    Study area overview The study area is located at the confluence of the Tibetan
    Plateau, Loess Plateau and Inner Mongolian Plateau, with an average elevation
    of 1500 m above sea level. The unique topography and geomorphology of the study
    area can be attributed to the dramatic uplift of the Tibetan Plateau hundreds
    of millions of years ago. At the same time, as a climatically sensitive area,
    the region has been subjected to severe wind erosion, resulting in the formation
    of large areas of Gobi and desert. As a result, the study area has evolved into
    a complex ecosystem consisting of mountains, oases and deserts. The ecosystem
    includes a variety of land types, such as agricultural land, woodland, grassland,
    and unused land, with deserts and the Gobi dominating (Fig. 1). The study area
    is rich in light resources and has an arid climate with mean annual temperatures
    of −12.2–10.0 °C; precipitation is sparse and concentrated, ranging from 15 −
    375 mm; and mean annual evapotranspiration is 1500–2500 mm (Liu et al., 2016b,
    Luo et al., 2022), giving it an arid continental climate. Soil types vary and
    include gray calcareous, gray desert, brown desert, glacial, wind-sand, saline,
    alkaline, and irrigated soils. The study area is ecologically fragile due to the
    combined effects of climate, vegetation, soil, geology, geomorphology, and hydrology
    (Luo et al., 2022). As an important ecological security barrier in arid and semiarid
    areas and a supporting area for economic, social and oasis development in northwestern
    inland riverbed, it has an agricultural land area of 4.05 million hectares, accounting
    for approximately 21.85 % of the total arable land area; the total grain output
    is 3.31 million tonnes, accounting for about 28.5 % of the province''s total grain
    output, and the main grain crops include wheat, maize and potato (Liu et al.,
    2016b; Gansu Development Yearbook, 2020). Download : Download high-res image (539KB)

    data from the Resource and Environment Science Data Centre of the Chinese Academy
    of Sciences (CAS), and farmland extent information from the CACD atlas (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7936885),
    under the WGS84 spatial reference system, with a spatial resolution of 30 m.).
    The Hexi Corridor has a long history of irrigated agriculture and is a famous
    irrigated oasis agricultural area in the interior of Northwest China, as well
    as a typical area for the development of oasis economy in arid areas, with 700,000
    ha of farmland irrigated by the Heihe, Shule and Shiyang Rivers, making it the
    most important commercial grain base in the Northwest China region and a centralized
    production area for cash crops, which feeds the people of Hexi as well as those
    of the whole province, and it is a real guarantee for people''s production and
    life, and it is known as the “Northwest China''s breadbasket”. It is also an important
    area for the country''s development (Guan et al., 2023). Their grain security
    is crucial for sustainable and stable ecological and social development (Guan
    et al., 2023). However, the Hexi region, as a climate sensitive area, the negative
    impact of global climate change on agriculture in the Hexi Corridor is significant.
    In addition, the Hexi Corridor is an important non-ferrous metal, iron and steel,
    petrochemical, aerospace and national defense base in China, and is rich in natural
    mineral resources, especially metal minerals, with several large mining sites,
    and Jinchang City accounts for more than 85 per cent of the country''s total nickel
    production, ranking second in the world, which provides good conditions for the
    development of industry and is conducive to economic development. At the same
    time, large scale construction of water conservancy projects, irrigation, and
    soil and water conservation measures on farmland are mostly adopted in the process
    of agricultural production in the region in order to reduce soil moisture loss
    and degradation. However, this has led to the threat of farmland soils from various
    pollutants including HMs (Guan et al., 2018, Guan et al., 2023). Therefore, conducting
    research on farmland soil pollution and risk early warning in the region is an
    important part of ensuring food security and sustainable agricultural development.
    2.2. Data collection, processing, and quality assurance According to the technical
    specification for monitoring the environmental quality of agricultural soil (NY/T395-2012),
    we collected 371 soil samples from farmland using the grid method. At the same
    time, portable GPS was used to record the latitude and longitude of the sampling
    points, and the samples were sealed in polythene bags. Each sampling point was
    approximately 5 km apart and three parallel samples were set up at each sampling
    point. Soil samples were naturally air-dried and milled to prepare them for determination.
    The HMs content of the soil samples collected was determined using a DELTA portable
    XRF instrument (OLYMPUS), averaging the HMs content of three parallel samples
    at each sampling location to obtain the HMs content at each sampling location.
    Handheld XRF has been used for the determination of HMs concentration data, with
    the advantages of high efficiency and rapid operation, providing a fast, economical,
    and relatively accurate analytical method (Caporale et al., 2018, Lemière, 2018).
    Research has shown similar outcomes with the device as well as inductively coupled
    plasma mass spectrometry (Caporale et al., 2018). For quality assurance and quality
    control, this study collected three parallel samples at each sampling point in
    the study area. The experimental instrumentation was set up with parameters of
    90 s determination under three consecutive beams in soil mode, each beam detecting
    and reporting different elemental concentrations. The instrument was also recalibrated
    after every 30 samples using a 316 stainless steel calibration check reference
    coin supplied by OLYMPUS and the accuracy of the test samples was controlled using
    standards (US EPA, 2007). Meanwhile, the few null values in the data series were
    replaced by the mean, and data outliers were analyzed and eliminated using Grubbs''
    method. 2.3. Methods The flow chart of the main research methodology of this study
    is as follows (Fig. 2): Download : Download high-res image (206KB) Download :
    Download full-size image Fig. 2. Flowchart of research methodology. 2.3.1. Pollution
    assessment This study used a one-factor pollution indicator (PI) and the Nemero
    integrated pollution indicator ( ) to assess agricultural soil HMs pollution in
    the Hexi corridor (Chen et al., 2020), where PI reflects the pollution level of
    individual heavy metals and reflects the integrated pollution level of heavy metals
    (Men et al., 2018). See Appendix S1 for a description of the methodology. 2.3.2.
    Spatial analysis The kriging method is more effective as a geospatial interpolation
    aspect (Marhaba et al., 2020). Kriging interpolation determines the moving weighted
    average by assigning different weights to each sample depending on its spatial
    location and the correlation between samples (Jin et al., 2019, Pan et al., 2021).
    Indicative kriging is one of the non-linear kriging methods, which firstly transforms
    continuous variables into binary variables according to the threshold value, calculates
    the cumulative distribution function of the estimated unknown location points,
    thus reflecting the spatial distribution of the results of the probability of
    being above or below a certain threshold, and is mostly applied to the early warning
    of the risk of soil heavy metal contamination. where denotes the predicted point
    concentration, n denotes sampling points, denotes the concentration at sampling
    point i, and denotes the weight coefficient. The method aims to compute the minimum
    unbiased estimate of X. 2.3.3. Soil environmental capacity Soil environmental
    capacity is the maximum load of pollutants that can be accommodated by soil in
    a given area and over a given period of time, provided that the pollutants do
    not pose a risk to the environment and human health, based on the relevant environmental
    quality (Marhaba et al., 2020). Soil environmental capacity can be categorized
    into static and dynamic capacity (Marhaba et al., 2020). In this study, the spatial
    distribution of the HMs environmental capacity has been analyzed by the use of
    ArcGIS 10.5. Among them, the static soil environmental capacity is calculated:
    Where is the existing capacity for i; is the total environmental capacity; and
    is the measured concentration; is the critical value, and is the background value,
    both of which are adopted as the critical value of the risk screening value of
    the national standards GB 15618–2018 and GB 36000–2018. M is the weight of the
    0–20 cm topsoil tillage layer per hectare and was taken as 2.25 × 106kg/hm2. The
    soil static environmental capacity index was estimated using the following formula
    to characterize the environmental capacity of the soil: is the total environmental
    capacity index, P is the individual environmental capacity index for HM i. The
    soil environmental capacity is classified according to the environmental capacity
    classification criteria Table S1: Due to the compound effects of the Earth''s
    material cycles, the cumulative transport of pollutants, climate change and human
    activities, heavy metals in soils are always subject to the influence of the soil
    chemical background and other substances, and pollutants from the external environment
    can also alter the accumulation and transport of heavy metal elements. Therefore,
    dynamic soil environmental capacity can be used to measure the number of pollutants
    that can be contained in soil over a certain period of time (Marhaba et al., 2020).
    Where is the annual dynamic capacity of HM i in soil after n years, n is the year,
    is the critical value of HM i content after n years, and is the HM concentration.
    K is the residual rate of pollutant, which is generally taken to be 0.9 because
    of the small amount of HMs migration and transformation. This study used 10- and
    20-year projections because China is expected to realize the vision of a “beautiful
    China” by 2035, and a longer projection period would result in a significant deviation
    between projections and actuals (Pan et al., 2021). 3. Results 3.1. Characteristics
    of soil environmental pollution in farmland of Hexi Corridor Soil HMs Mean concentrations
    in agricultural in the Hexi corridor were above background, with geochemical baseline
    values below maximum HMs values but above mean values (Table 1). Chinese soil
    environmental quality standards were exceeded for all HMs except As (Table 1).
    The coefficient of variation (CV) for Cr was greater than 30 %, which is high
    variance, while the CV for Ni was close to high variance and the remaining HMs
    were in the medium variance range. Table 1. Descriptive statistics of heavy metal

    pollution index and found that the study area is moderately polluted with Cr and
    Ni relatively prominent (Fig. 3). However, the mean values of the remaining heavy
    metal contamination indices are all around 1, indicating low levels of contamination,
    but there are more significant heavy metal contamination problems at individual
    stations. Nemerow integrated pollution index showed that the integrated pollution
    of HMs was in a low pollution state, and individual sites may have a medium pollution
    level. These results indicate that the HMs in the farmland of the Hexi corridor
    are contaminated to a certain extent, which should be paid attention to. Download

    HMs pollution index of agricultural soil in Hexi Corridor. 3.2. Spatio-temporal
    distribution of HMs environmental capacity In this study, the average environmental
    capacity index of soil HMs was used to analyses the environmental carrying capacity
    of farmland soils for HMs. The results showed that Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, As and Pb all
    belong to the moderate capacity status in the agricultural land (Table 2), indicating
    that the agricultural land in the study area has some loading capacity for these
    HMs contaminants. Average capacity index of Zn was highest with 0,997 and average
    capacity index of Cr and Ni was lowest with 0,966 and 0,967 respectively, indicating
    higher level of Cr and Ni pollution in study area. The total environmental capacity
    index showed that the environmental load of HMs was moderate, and the total environmental
    capacity index was 0.983 (Table 2), indicating that the overall ecological condition
    of the farmland soil was relatively good. Table 2. Statistical results of the

    of HMs environmental capacity indices was counted (Table 3), Pi is the total environmental
    capacity index, and it was found that the main HMs of the study area were at medium–high
    capacity at most areas, indicating that the agricultural land of the Hexi corridor
    still has a high soil HMs loading capacity at present, but Cr, Ni and Cu were
    at low capacity at a very small number of sampling points. In addition, the minimum
    value of the existing environmental capacity of As was negative, and further statistics
    found that only one site of As had a negative environmental capacity, accounting
    for 0.27 % of the total, indicating that As was overloaded at this sampling site,
    and As was in an alarming state at 0.54 % of the sampling sites (Table 3). Table

    for kriging interpolation (Fig. 4) of the HMs environmental carrying capacity
    index to explore the spatial pattern of the agricultural soils environmental carrying
    capacity. It was found that in western part of this region, Cr, Ni, Zn and As
    were mainly present in medium to high concentrations, while Cu and Pb were in
    the high capacity as a whole, and the spatial distribution pattern was basically
    the same. In the central region, HMs were mainly in low to moderate capacity status.
    The eastern part, including the cities of Jinchang and Wuwei of the study area,
    was in the moderate to high-capacity zone overall, but this may be different in
    the northern part of Wuwei. Overall, the distribution of HMs capacities showed
    that the HMs capacity of the soil was dominated by areas with moderate and high
    capacities (Table 3, Fig. S1). These findings indicated that the overall environmental
    status of the soil in the Hexi Corridor is relatively satisfactory, but that individual
    sites should be monitored for HMs contamination. Download : Download high-res

    early warning The soil static environmental capacity can give an indication of
    the current base load of the soil environment under investigation. However, in
    order to prevent soil degradation, it is particularly important to predict the
    future soil environmental capacity. In this study, 10 and 20 years were selected
    as control years and the soil HMs environmental capacity in agricultural in 2018
    was used as a baseline to calculate the soil HMs dynamic capacity in the Hexi
    corridor in 2028 and 2038, based on the soil dynamic capacity model (Table 4).
    It was found that dynamic capacity for 2028 and 2038 is less than current static
    and existing capacity of environment, and soil dynamic capacity for all HMs showed
    a decreasing trend with time. In the next 10 years, the soil dynamic environment
    capacity for HMs showed a significant decrease of 70 to 80 % in all cases, of
    which the HMs with the largest decrease was Pb, which reached 81.52 %, and the
    HMs with the smallest decrease was As, which decreased by 72.10 %. The soil environment
    dynamic capacity was still decreasing in the next 10 to 20 years, with Pb and
    As being the elements with the largest and smallest decreases (Table 4). This
    finding indicated that in the process of environmental substance cycling, the
    capacity for pollutants will gradually decrease, and it will be difficult for
    the soil to bear the self-purification pressure of pollutants, if no pollution
    prevention measures are taken. Table 4. Statistics on the environmental dynamic

    the soil environment dynamic capacity in the two periods of 2028 and 2038, respectively,
    was involved in the calculation as a threshold value (Fig. 5). Results showed
    that in 2028, the probability of each HMs to appear contamination as a whole showed
    that the west of the study area and the east of Wuwei City in the north was smaller.
    the probability of each HMs in the central part to appear contamination was larger,
    and the probability of the future appearance of HMs contamination in some areas
    was more than 0.8, but there were fewer areas of contamination probability risk
    in the middle part of the Zhangye city, 0.4–0.6, and the rest of the area were
    in 0.6 or more, which indicated that farmland in the middle Hexi Corridor has
    a higher probability of appearing contaminated by HMs in the future and should
    be focused on. By 2038, the probability of pollution risk of HMs Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn,
    As, and Pb was almost unchanged, and the spatial distribution pattern was basically
    the same as that in 2028, with a high probability of pollution risk of 0.8–1 mainly
    in the central farmland. Download : Download high-res image (995KB) Download :

    4.1. Characteristics of soil heavy metal pollution Heavy metals in agricultural
    soils in Northwest China come from natural and anthropogenic sources (Zhao et
    al., 2015, He et al., 2020; Luo et al., 2021). The spatial heterogeneity of the
    soil environment and anthropogenic activities make the sources of heavy metals
    vary widely (Feng et al., 2018, Baltas et al., 2020). Therefore, understanding
    the pollution sources of heavy metals in agricultural soils is the key to early
    warning of soil quality and helps to prevent soil pollution. There are many methods
    for analyzing heavy metal contamination in soils, including single factor contamination
    indices and comprehensive contamination indices (Caeiro et al., 2005). In this
    study, by analyzing the coefficient of variation (CV) of soil heavy metals, it
    was found that the CV of Cr was greater than 30 %, which was high variability,
    while the CV of Ni was close to the high degree of variability, and the rest of
    the heavy metals were in the medium degree of variability, which indicated that
    the farmland soils in the study area were greatly affected by the unnatural conditions,
    and that the heavy metals had a high degree of spatial variability (Guan et al.,
    2018, Guan et al., 2019b), and likewise confirms the serious influence of anthropogenic
    activities on the input of heavy metals (Liu et al., 2018; Luo et al., 2021; Yang
    et al., 2021b), which is also in general agreement with previous related studies
    on the area (Guan et al., 2018, Guan et al., 2019b; Wang et al., 2020a). In order
    to reflect the degree of influence of anthropogenic activities on the concentration
    of heavy metals, the pollution index was used to evaluate and analyze the pollution
    level of heavy metals in farmland soils in agricultural areas. Among them, the
    single factor pollution index can reflect the degree of influence of individual
    heavy metals on soil pollution (Obiora et al., 2016), and the comprehensive pollution
    index reflects the comprehensive pollution level of all heavy metals in the region
    through the synergistic effect of multiple heavy metals (Qing et al., 2015, Yang
    et al., 2021a). The present study found that the heavy metals in the study area
    are in medium pollution level, and Cr and Ni pollution were relatively more prominent
    (Fig. 3). The Nemerow comprehensive pollution index highlights the influence of
    high concentrations of polluting elements and avoids the weakening of the weight
    of polluting metals due to averaging effect (Pibul et al., 2023), In this study,
    the Nemerow comprehensive pollution evaluation index showed that the comprehensive
    pollution of heavy metals is in low pollution status, and individual sites may
    have moderate pollution level, which is also in full agreement with the results
    of previous related studies (Wang et al., 2020b). 4.2. Spatial and temporal variations
    in environmental capacity Studies related to environmental capacity can be closely
    related to the development of regional environmental standards for pollutants,
    the comprehensive prevention and control of environmental pollution, the rational
    layout of industry and the prediction of regional environmental quality. The static
    environmental capacity of soil reflects the maximum capacity of soil for pollutants,
    but it does not take into account the self-purification and buffering role of
    the soil environment, i.e., pollutants enter the soil and then pollute the soil
    environment through accumulation (Li et al., 2020). However, contaminants in soil
    are also affected by the dynamics of adsorption, dissolution, accumulation, and
    transport of contaminants during soil geochemical cycling processes, which influence
    the accommodation of heavy metals in the soil environment (Li et al., 2020). Therefore,
    the soil environmental capacity consists of the sum of the soil static environmental
    capacity and the dynamic environmental capacity (Li et al., 2020). In this study,
    the average environmental capacity index of soil heavy metals was utilized, and
    the results showed that the heavy metals in farmland in the study area were all
    in medium capacity (Table 2), which indicated that the farmland soil in the study
    area had a certain loading capacity for these heavy metal pollutants. This is
    mainly due to the rapid growth of animal husbandry and agricultural activities
    that have led to serious ecological and environmental problems in the area (Wen
    et al., 2023), among which the application of livestock and poultry manure to
    farmland can lead to Ni contamination very obviously (Guan et al., 2023). Furthermore,
    the study area, Jinchang City, is a major Ni production base in China, and Ni
    contamination is more pronounced here (Guan et al., 2018, Wang et al., 2020b).
    On the other hand, there is a wide range of regional sources of Cr and Ni due
    to the distribution of industrial and agricultural activities such as transport,
    mining and smelting from west to east of the study area. Coupled with the relatively
    concentrated distribution of farmland in the study area, arid regional climate,
    and heavy reliance on traditional irrigation for agriculture, irrigated agriculture
    is well developed in the study area (Li and Wang, 2021), which is likewise a major
    contributor to the high concentrations of Cr (Liu et al., 2016a, Guan et al.,
    2018, Soleimani et al., 2023). In addition, the minimum value of the existing
    environmental capacity of As was negative (Table S1), and As was in an alarming
    state at 0.54 % of the sampling sites (Table 4), which may be related to the wastewater
    irrigation and excessive pesticide use in these areas (Wang et al., 2020c, Zhao
    et al., 2022). Studies have shown that phosphorus fertilizers and pesticides contain
    high levels of As (Hu et al., 2019, Zhao et al., 2019a, Zhao et al., 2019b). It
    was found that the use of inorganic fertilizers such as phosphate fertilizers
    and pesticides is a common practice in local agriculture, as analyzed in the research
    of this study (Chai et al., 2021), which may be the reason for the occurrence
    of As overload (Gupta et al., 2014, Jing et al., 2018, Chai et al., 2021). The
    present study further investigated the spatial pattern of the environmental capacity
    of the soil and found that in the central part of the study area, the heavy metals
    were mainly in the medium–low capacity state, and the heavy metals were mainly
    in the medium–low capacity state, which may be related to agricultural activities
    (i.e., overuse of fertilizers, sewage irrigation) in the central region (Sawut
    et al., 2018), previous studies have also shown that the Zhangye region is more
    affected by industrial and agricultural activities, and the problem of HMs pollution
    is more pronounced (Liu et al., 2016b, Zhao et al., 2019a, Zhao et al., 2019b).
    This is coupled with the fact that calcium superphosphate fertilizer is commonly
    used in fertilizer application in the region, leading to the accumulation of Cr,
    Cu, Pb, Ni, Zn, As and other elements in the fertilizer in the soil (Su and Yang,
    2008). The eastern part, including the cities of Jinchang and Wuwei of the study
    area, was in the moderate to high-capacity zone overall, but this may be different
    in the northern part of Wuwei. Studies have shown that nonferrous metal smelting
    in China significantly increases HMs concentrations in agricultural soils (Yang
    et al., 2023). The study area, such as Jinchang City, has many nonferrous metals
    smelting sites, causing HMs contamination of surrounding agricultural soils (Zhao
    et al., 2019a, Zhao et al., 2019b). It has been suggested that the lower environmental
    capacity is mainly related to the impact of industrial and human activities (Liu
    et al., 2018; Luo et al., 2021). Overall, the heavy metal capacity of the soil
    in the study area was dominated by medium-capacity zones, with a very small number
    of high-capacity zones distributed in the western part of the study area. These
    differences in the spatial distribution patterns of heavy metals indicate that
    the heavy metal concentrations in the agricultural area are not uniformly distributed,
    which also confirms that anthropogenic activities have a serious impact on the
    inputs of heavy metals (Yang et al., 2021b). 4.3. HMs pollution control and early
    warning measures Agriculture is the material foundation for human survival and
    development, which is intimately linked to food and health security (Fei et al.,
    2022). However, agricultural soil HMs cause soil compaction and nutrient loss,
    leading to reduced yields and quality of agricultural products (Zhao et al., 2017),
    and have a profound impact on the ecology and soil quality of agricultural soil
    environments (Yang et al., 2022). Furthermore, the irrational use of irrigation
    and the extensive use of chemical fertilizing and insecticides during the process
    of agricultural land use increased the degree of agricultural soil pollution (Bhandari
    et al., 2020), coupled with the continuous changes in the soil ecological environment
    under the action of a variety of environmental factors, the problem of pollution
    has always been more prominent (Zheng et al., 2020). Therefore, the prevention
    and early warning of HMs contamination of soils requires the adoption and consideration
    of multi-faceted measures to achieve sustainable agro-ecosystem development. Based
    on the soil dynamic capacity model, it was found that the soil dynamic capacity
    of all heavy metals showed a decreasing trend over time, which indicates that
    if no measures are taken to improve the soil environment in the study area, the
    capacity of the soil for pollutants gradually decreases during the process of
    environmental material cycling in the study area, and it is difficult for the
    soil to bear the self-purification pressure of pollutants by itself. The causes
    of the above phenomena may be due to the natural climatic conditions and human
    activities. On the one hand, which is also basically consistent with previous
    studies (Zhang et al., 2018), HMs pollution is caused by human activities in industrial
    and agricultural production or irrational agricultural practices in agricultural
    production (Pan et al., 2021). On the other hand, annual precipitation, and soil
    nitrogen content in Hexi region are low and cannot meet the increasing crop demand
    (Ju et al., 2009), although Northwest China is rich in sunshine and thermal energy
    resources (Sun et al., 2021). Consequently, sewage irrigation and over-fertilization
    to ensure high crop yields contaminate the farmland soil environment (Song et
    al., 2019, Ablimit et al., 2022). In addition, the probability of future contamination
    of each heavy metal in the central part of the study area is higher. This was
    mainly related to the fact that Zhangye is a major commercial grain base in northwestern
    China (Zhao et al., 2019a, Zhao et al., 2019b), which uses water from the Qilian
    Mountains glacier meltwater on the one hand, and also has a relatively well-developed
    irrigation industry as well as irrational farming practices (Liu et al., 2016b),
    which may have led to contaminated soils (Song et al., 2019). Therefore, this
    study proposed to improve the risk management and early warning system of soil
    environment, to map the current status of soil environment quality in the whole
    region by conducting a detailed survey of soil pollution in the region, and to
    establish a contaminated soil archive and database in order to achieve HMs pollution
    of agricultural soils and sustainable development in the study area and arid zones.
    In addition, long-term tracking surveys have been conducted in areas that have
    been overloaded or seriously contaminated, so that detailed information on contaminated
    land parcels in the study area can be grasped and supervision and management of
    control and remediation pollution prevention and control can be strengthened.
    Explore the establishment of a whole-process regulatory mechanism for the redevelopment
    of remediated plots and the reuse of remediated soil and achieve the prevention
    and control of agricultural soil pollution and risk early warning through the
    construction of a “pollution assessment - source treatment - risk early warning”
    management system for HMs contaminated sites (Zhao et al., 2022), and to help
    prevent and achieve sustainable agricultural development. Furthermore, the main
    sources of HMs contamination in agricultural soils in the Hexi corridor were found
    to be agricultural fertilization and irrigation. Therefore, the establishment
    of rigorous early warning and monitoring measures and pollution source control
    strategies is key to ensuring the quality of soil crops (Hu et al., 2020, Fei
    et al., 2023). In order to achieve the above objectives, the Government has established
    a comprehensive soil quality monitoring network to conduct regular monitoring
    and assessment of key areas, industries, and pollution sources. In addition, governments
    should strengthen the management and guidance of agricultural production, promote
    organic agriculture and green planting techniques, reduce the use of chemical
    fertilizers and pesticides, promote sustainable agricultural development, and
    reduce the content of HMs in agricultural products (Fei et al., 2023). In addition,
    the Agenda 2030 sustainable development report states that as the world''s population
    continues to grow, the more pressure there is on land resources, while expanding
    human needs and economic activities are placing increasing pressure on land resources,
    creating competition and conflict and leading to suboptimal resource utilization.
    In addition, land and healthy soils are key inputs for food production, thus increasing
    the productivity of existing agricultural land through sustainable agricultural
    practices (Global Sustainable Development Report (2023)). Therefore, as an important
    resource for plant and animal growth, biodiversity, and ecosystem services, analyzing
    soil heavy metal contamination and risk early warning is crucial for future land
    resource protection and sustainable development. In addition, further refinement
    of risk zones with different levels of risk for areas where contamination may
    be present is the basis for pollution prevention and control (Chen et al., 2023).
    For areas likely to be contaminated in future, efficient soil remediation methods,
    such as cultivation of native hyper-accumulating plants and integrated water and
    manure management, should be used. Furthermore, as a key to cleaner production
    and sustainable development (Adlane et al., 2020), dynamic monitoring of soil
    and crop quality is needed to prevent polluting inputs and reduce risks to agricultural
    production (Liu et al., 2016b). Overall, HMs contamination of soil is a complex
    and serious environmental problem. Solving it will require the combined efforts
    of governments, enterprises, and the public. By formulating appropriate policies
    and early warning measures and strengthening research and development of monitoring,
    remediation and treatment technologies, the risk of soil HMs contamination can
    be minimized, the ecological environment and public health can be protected, and
    a balance between the health of agricultural soils and sustainable development
    can be achieved. 4.4. Limitations and perspectives The methods used in this paper
    are mainly based on statistical analyses and comprehensive qualitative and quantitative
    assessments, which have not yet been able to fully reveal the natural processes
    and the intrinsic mechanisms of human activities that underlie the changes in
    HMs concentrations in agricultural soils in different regions. In addition, it
    is difficult to predict the binding state and mobility of pollutants in soil and
    their risks based on the total concentration of HMs alone. More advanced monitoring
    techniques and real-time data should be used in future studies to investigate
    the mechanisms that influence the different soil HMs concentrations. Meanwhile,
    the potential bioaccumulation of heavy metals in food crops was not explored in
    this study, and future research will be conducted on agro-ecological security
    by exploring the potential risk of heavy metal transfer from soil to crops. 5.
    Conclusion In this study, GIS technology and material balance linear model were
    used for spatio-temporal simulation and risk early warning of HMs in agricultural
    soils in the Hexi Corridor. The results showed that farmland soils in the Hexi
    Corridor were greatly affected by human activities, and the regional HMs pollution
    was at a medium pollution level, with Cr and Ni pollution being relatively more
    prominent. As a result of animal husbandry, industrial and agricultural activities
    such as irrigation and fertilizer application, Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, As and Pb in the
    study area were in moderate capacity in the farmland, indicating that although
    there is a certain loading capacity for these HMs in the farmland, the problem
    of contamination should not be ignored. Spatial analyses showed that Cr, Ni, Zn
    and As were basically in moderate to high capacity in the western part of the
    study area. HMs in the central part of the area were mainly in low to moderate
    capacity status, which may be related to agricultural activities such as fertilizer
    application and sewage irrigation. Based on the soil dynamic capacity model, this
    study found that the dynamic capacity of the soil environment in 2028 and 2038
    was less than the current environmental capacity, and the dynamic capacity of
    the soil showed a decreasing trend over time. This was related to over-irrigation
    and high fertilizer application in the study area on the one hand, and regional
    industry and irrational agricultural practices on the other. At the same time,
    the soil HMs dynamic environment capacity showed a significant decrease in the
    next 10 years and in the next 10 to 20 years, which indicated that if no measures
    are taken to improve the soil HMs pollution, the future will make it difficult
    to burden the self-purification pressure of pollutants with the gradual decrease
    in the capacity of the soil to hold pollutants. On the basis of the results of
    the dynamic capacity, early warning of the risk of HMs pollution in the future.
    In 2028, the overall probability of the occurrence of pollution for each HMs showed
    a smaller probability in the western part of the study area and the northern part
    of Wuwei City in the east, and a larger probability of the occurrence of pollution
    for each HMs in the middle part. By 2038, the probability of HMs contamination
    risk is basically unchanged, and the main spatial distribution pattern is basically
    the same as that in 2028, with a high contamination risk probability of 0.8–1
    in the middle area. In order to achieve the prevention and sustainable development
    of soil HMs pollution in agricultural in arid zones, this study suggests the formulation
    of corresponding policies and early warning measures, and the strengthening of
    research and development of monitoring, remediation, and treatment technologies,
    so as to minimize the soil HMs pollution risk and protect the ecological environment
    and public health. Through the construction of a management system of “pollution
    assessment - source treatment - risk early warning” for HMs contaminated sites,
    the prevention and sustainable development of agricultural soil pollution in the
    study area will be achieved. CRediT authorship contribution statement Haiping

    \ The paper utilizes a panel Tobit model and incorporates undesirable outputs\

    \ main finding is that CLUE in China exhibited an upward trend from 2000 to 2020,\
    \ with distinct temporal stages. Major grain-producing areas had lower CLUE compared\
    \ to non-major grain-production areas. The spatial agglomeration effect had a\
    \ northeast-southwest strip distribution. Investment in science and technology\
    \ positively influenced CLUE, while the irrigation index had a negative effect.\n\
    \nOverall, this paper provides insights into the dynamics and influencing factors\
    \ of CLUE in China, highlighting the need for policies that promote sustainable\

  description: 'Improving cultivated land use eco-efficiency (CLUE) can effectively
    promote agricultural sustainability, particularly in developing countries where
    CLUE is generally low. This study used provincial-level data from China to evaluate
    the spatiotemporal evolution of CLUE from 2000 to 2020 and identified the influencing
    factors of CLUE by using a panel Tobit model. In addition, given the undesirable
    outputs of agricultural production, we incorporated carbon emissions and nonpoint

    Improving cultivated land use eco-efficiency (CLUE) can effectively promote agricultural
    sustainability, particularly in developing countries where CLUE is generally low.
    This study used provincial-level data from China to evaluate the spatiotemporal
    evolution of CLUE from 2000 to 2020 and identified the influencing factors of
    CLUE by using a panel Tobit model. In addition, given the undesirable outputs
    of agricultural production, we incorporated carbon emissions and nonpoint source
    pollution into the global benchmark-undesirable output-super efficiency-slacks-based
    measure (GB-US-SBM) model, which combines global benchmark technology, undesirable
    output, super efficiency, and slacks-based measure. The results indicated that
    there was an upward trend in CLUE in China from 2000 to 2020, with an increase
    rate of 2.62%. The temporal evolution of CLUE in China could be classified into
    three distinct stages: a period of fluctuating decrease (2000–2007), a phase of
    gradual increase (2008–2014), and a period of rapid growth (2015–2020). The major
    grain-producing areas (MPAs) had a lower CLUE than their counterparts, namely,
    non-major grain-production areas (non-MPAs). The spatial agglomeration effect
    followed a northeast-southwest strip distribution; and the movement path of barycentre
    revealed a “P” shape, with Luoyang City, Henan Province, as the centre. In terms
    of influencing factors of CLUE, investment in science and technology played the
    most vital role in improving CLUE, while irrigation index had the most negative
    effect. It should be noted that these two influencing factors had different impacts
    on MPAs and non-MPAs. Therefore, relevant departments should formulate policies
    to enhance the level of science and technology, improve irrigation condition,
    and promote sustainable utilization of cultivated land. Article PDF Similar content

  title: Spatiotemporal characteristics of cultivated land use eco-efficiency and
    its influencing factors in China from 2000 to 2020
  verbatim_quote1: In addition, given the undesirable outputs of agricultural production,
    we incorporated carbon emissions and nonpoint source pollution into the global
    benchmark-undesirable output-super efficiency-slacks-based measure (GB-US-SBM)
    model, which combines global benchmark technology, undesirable output, super efficiency,
    and slacks-based measure.
  verbatim_quote2: The major grain-producing areas (MPAs) had a lower CLUE than their
    counterparts, namely, non-major grain-production areas (non-MPAs). The spatial
    agglomeration effect followed a northeast-southwest strip distribution; and the
    movement path of barycentre revealed a “P” shape, with Luoyang City, Henan Province,
    as the centre.
  verbatim_quote3: In terms of influencing factors of CLUE, investment in science
    and technology played the most vital role in improving CLUE, while irrigation
    index had the most negative effect. It should be noted that these two influencing
    factors had different impacts on MPAs and non-MPAs.
- analysis: 'This paper addresses the point about consideration of the volume, frequency,
    format, and source of the data used in the water quality indices. It provides
    a detailed investigation of the hydrochemical evolution of the Lhasa water supply
    using 65 water samples including surface and groundwater samples. The assessment
    takes into account hydrogeological conditions, geological background, land use,
    topography, and geomorphology. Using these data, the authors calculate a Water
    Quality Index (WQI) and a Sodium Ion Adsorption Ratio (SAR) for each sample.


    The authors find that both surface water and groundwater have good water quality,
    with average WQI values of 16.28 and 14.14, respectively. They also find that
    the primary chemical type of both surface water and groundwater is HCO3-Ca·Mg.
    The authors conclude that rock weathering has the largest impact on the ionic
    components of the water samples and that the water is not affected by precipitation
    or human actions.


    This paper is relevant to the point about considerations of volume, frequency,
    format, and source of the data as the authors use a variety of data sources to
    assess the water quality of Lhasa''s water supply. The authors also provide a
    detailed description of the methods they used to collect and analyze the data.
    The paper is well-written and provides a valuable contribution to the understanding
    of water quality in Lhasa.'

  description: Lhasa, perched atop the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, has particular hydrochemical
    evolution characteristics as well as a distinct biological habitat. Rapid development
    has jeopardized the surface and groundwater. To maintain water safety and community
    health, a scientific examination of groundwater quality and human health problems
    is essential. A complete investigation of Lhasa's hydrochemical evolution was
    carried out using 65 water samples, including 14 surface water samples and 51
    groundwater samples, and the quality of the surface and groundwater was assessed.
    Health hazards were also assessed. According to the findings, both surface water
    and groundwater have decreased salinity, hardness, and alkalinity. According to
    the Comprehensive Weighted Water Quality Index statistics, the average water quality
    indices for surface water and groundwater are 16.28 and 14.14, respectively, indicating
    good water quality. Surface and groundwater are suitable for agricultural irrigation
    due to their low salt absorption rates. According to the study of hydrochemical
    development and regulating factors, rock weathering is a phenomenon that affects
    both surface water and groundwater. Water is unaffected by precipitation or human
    actions. According to the human health risk assessment, children have a higher
    risk of non-carcinogenicity than adults, and the primary exposure route is daily
    oral ingestion. Non-carcinogenic health risk indices for nitrate consumption in
    children and adults are 0.220 and 0.136, respectively, indicating a lower non-carcinogenic
    risk of nitrate in the region's surface and groundwater, and the younger the age,
    the higher the non-carcinogenic health risk of nitrate intake. This study provides
    data support for local water resource management and optimization, as well as
    a reference for the chemical evolution of urban water and the evaluation of nitrate
    non-carcinogenic risk in global alpine regions.

    2021 Introduction Water is essential to human productivity and survival since
    it is the source of life, whether it comes from surface water or groundwater.
    Runoff changes the chemical makeup of soil, silt, and other materials through
    continuous interactions with water. (Li et al. 2019; Rahman et al. 2022). Understanding
    the material cycle in the ecosystem and biogeochemical processes is essential
    for comprehending changes in the physical and chemical properties of water within
    a basin. These processes also apply to groundwater and surface water (Zhu et al.
    2020; Hosono et al. 2020). Water quality, watershed management, and systemic hydrological
    environmental factors are all crucial (Wu and Lu 2021; Xu et al. 2022a; Zhao et
    al. 2022). The actual impact of several factors on the watershed, including crustal
    movement, atmospheric precipitation, rock weathering, and human activity, can
    usually be seen in the hydrochemical composition and composition of water (Zhang
    et al. 2019, 2022; Qu et al. 2021). Furthermore, the analysis of the hydrochemical
    composition characteristics of water is a critical component of evaluating the
    quality of water resources in the basin and is necessary for the scientific development
    and natural preservation of water resources (Hu et al. 2020; Zhong et al. 2022).
    The composition of water has become a critical issue affecting human life and
    social progress and has garnered widespread attention because the concentration
    of ions in water is largely influenced by the natural geographical environment
    and is closely related to human production and living. Water resources abound
    in the Tibet Autonomous Region. There are several rivers and lakes. There are
    more than 20 rivers covering an area of more than 10,000 km2 (Huang et al. 2009).
    The Lhasa, Nianchu, and Niyang rivers, among other significant tributaries, make
    up the largest drainage area of the Yarlung Zangbo River (Liu et al. 2020). Lhasa
    is situated in the center of Tibet (Mao et al. 2023). Within the Lhasa, the Lhasa
    River meanders from east to west. The high mountains of Lhasa are only partially
    obscured by the forest cover during the rainy season (Shi et al. 2014). The topography
    and geomorphic qualities of the city, the degree of plant cover, its development
    scale, as well as various weather circumstances (wind, temperature, humidity,
    and precipitation), all have an impact on the quality of the urban water environment
    (Li et al. 2020). Due to the unique and shifting environmental conditions of the
    plateau and its ecological vulnerability, human activities along the river, such
    as geothermal and mineral development, urban sewage, and wastewater discharge,
    have had a significant negative impact on the Lhasa River in recent years. As
    a result, pollution is an unavoidable consequence (Qu et al. 2019; Liu et al.
    2020). In the middle and lower portions of the river, the Lhasa River serves as
    the main source of water for people, animals, and crops. The health and safety
    of people living in the basin are correlated with the river''s water quality,
    which is getting worse. The pollution of nitrate is a worldwide problem. High
    permeability and facile solubility characterize nitrate (Wu et al. 2020; Wang
    et al. 2021; Jannat et al. 2022). This chemical pollutant is present in groundwater
    and can seep into the earth through surface runoff. Long-term use of nitrate water
    poses a serious risk to human health since it can cause methemoglobinemia, stomach
    cancer, and blue baby syndrome (Zhai et al. 2017; Ji et al. 2021). Drinking water
    and skin contact are two ways that nitrate from water may enter the body and directly
    impact human health (Rahman et al. 2021; Panda et al. 2022). Because of this,
    it is essential to investigate how nitrate pollution in drinking water affects
    human health and to determine the extent of damage through a risk assessment of
    water quality (Juntakut et al. 2019; Yuan et al. 2023). A new evaluation method
    that links water pollution to human health is called health risk assessment. The
    likelihood of harm may be quantified when an individual is in a polluted environment
    (Taloor et al. 2023). Because of this, it is important to assess the health hazards
    and determine the level of nitrate pollution in the water. The majority of Tibet
    research focuses on geological structure (Li et al. 2022a, 2022b), with little
    emphasis dedicated to risk assessment, water quality, or the development of these
    themes. Thus, the primary focus of this study is on the quality of Lhasa''s water,
    followed by a discussion of its evolution and the identification of its source.
    This article covers three major topics: (1) an examination of the characteristics
    and complete evaluation of Lhasa’s water quality; (2) the hydrochemical control
    factors and the Lhasa water evolution process; and (3) an assessment of the risk
    to public health presented by Lhasa''s water. Study area and catchment geology
    Lhasa (90°06′E, 29°36′N) is one of the world''s highest cities, located in the
    heart of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (Fig. 1). The topography is steep in the north
    and low in the south, with slopes running east to west. The center and southern
    portions of Lhasa are valley plains in the middle reaches of the Lhasa River,
    a tributary of the Yarlung Zangbo River. Chengguan, Duilongdeqing, and Dazi are
    the three districts that make up Lhasa. The samples are mostly concentrated in
    the districts of Chengguan and Duilongdeqing. Fig. 1 Sampling points distribution
    of Lhasa City Full size image Lhasa City has an average yearly temperature of
    5.3 °C due to its elevation of 3650 m. Each year, around 600 mm of precipitation
    falls, the majority of which occurs between July and September (He et al. 2022).
    The major features of the terrain are the alternating large and small valleys,
    gorges, and drastically varied scenery. The mountains that line the river are
    usually no higher than 6,000 m. As a result of the active faults that rise and
    fall differently on either side of the valley, a significant Quaternary system
    of more than 400–600 m in thickness evolved in the valley. A vast exposed area,
    massive bedrock, and many tectonic traces describe the complicated geological
    structure. With a limited distribution range, the quaternary system is mostly
    found in piedmont regions and river valleys. Lhasa is situated in the high northern
    and low middle terrain in the Gangdisi-Nianqing Tanggula geological structure
    region. With additional contributions from Yanshanian granite, Tertiary and Quaternary
    volcanic ejecta rocks, and clastic rocks, the bedrock of the Lhasa Valley is mostly
    composed of Himalayan granite and Mesozoic limestone. Materials and methods Collection
    and analysis of samples 65 water samples were collected in June 2020 to evaluate
    and analyze the water quality and major ion sources in Lhasa, comprising 14 surface
    water samples and 51 groundwater samples (Fig. 1). The samples gathered took into
    account hydrogeological conditions, geological background, land use, topography,
    and geomorphology. The water sample is filtered on-site and placed in two bottles,
    one of which is filled with nitric acid to adjust the pH < 2. The acid-added sample
    is used for testing cations such as potassium, sodium, calcium, and magnesium,
    while the original sample is used for testing anions such as nitrate, chloride,
    sulfate, and bicarbonate, and then refrigerated until it is delivered to the laboratory
    for testing. Because changes in ambient circumstances have a large impact on pH
    and conductivity, they are examined in the field by the water quality multi-parameter
    analyzer (HQ40D Hach). An atomic absorption spectrometer was used to test the
    cation, and ion chromatography was used to quantify the anion. HCO3− and CO32−
    were studied using titrmetric analysis. The oven drying method was used to evaluate
    the dissolved total solids (TDS), titration with ethylene diamine tetraacetic
    acid (EDTA) was used to estimate the total hardness (TH), and the colorimetric
    molybdenum blue method was used to assess the H2SiO3 concentrations in the fluids.
    All test indicators had relative standard deviations of less than 5%. Water quality
    index (WQI) and sodium ion adsorption ratio (SAR) WQI is calculated using the
    following equation and primarily uses numerous water quality measures to characterize
    the overall state of water quality (Wu et al. 2021; Peng et al. 2022; Krishnamoorthy
    et al. 2023). The specific calculation formula is as follows. $${\\text{WQI}}=\\sum
    \\left({W}_{i}\\times \\left(\\frac{{C}_{i}}{{S}_{i}}\\times 100\\right)\\right)$$
    (1) where Wi represents the relative weight of each index (Wi = wi / Σwi), wi
    is the weight of each parameter, the weights of F−, NO3−, SO42−, Cl−, Na+, pH,
    and TDS are 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 4, and 4, respectively (Chai et al.,2021; Xiao et al.
    2019). Ci represents the laboratory test concentration for each participant indicator
    (F−, NO3−, SO42−, Cl−, Na+ and TDS), and Si represents the standard value of each
    participant indicator (Ministry of Health, 2022). Water quality is classified
    into five categories based on the WQI value: undrinkable (WQI ≥ 300), extremely
    bad (200 ≤ WQI < 300), poor (100 ≤ WQI < 200), acceptable (50 ≤ WQI < 100), and
    excellent (WQI < 50) (Yidana and Yidana 2010; Şener et al. 2017; Xiao et al. 2019;
    Liu et al. 2021a, 2021b). SAR is a measurement of irrigation water. The higher
    the sodium ion concentration in the soil, the more difficult it is for vegetative
    roots to absorb water (Din et al. 2023). When SAR < 10, irrigation water will
    not harm crops or soil; when 10 ≤ SAR < 18, irrigation water is medium sodium
    water and can irrigate gypsum-containing soil with good water permeability; when
    18 ≤ SAR < 26, irrigation water is high sodium water and has obvious sodium damage
    after irrigation; And when SAR is greater than 26, irrigation water is extremely
    high sodium water and cannot be used for irrigation (Srivastava 2019; Shenbagalakshmi
    et al. 2023; Sinduja et al. 2023). Its calculating formula is presented in Eq.
    (2). $${\\text{SAR }} = {\\text{ Na}}^{ + } / \\, \\left[ ({{\\text{Ca}}^{{{2}
    + }} + {\\text{ Mg}}^{{{2} + }}) /{ 2}} \\right]^{{0.{5}}}$$ (2) A model for assessing
    health risks The assessment approach considers multiple demographics and methods
    of exposure to objectively quantify the threat of pollutants (US EPA 1989; Bahita
    et al. 2021). To estimate the influence of dangerous substances in water quality
    on human health, the Human Health Risk Assessment (HHRA) technique has been widely
    used (Miao et al. 2021). The HHRA model uses the formula described below to quantify
    health hazards (Islam et al. 2020; Karunanidhi et al. 2020). $${\\text{HI }} =
    I_{{{\\text{CD}}}} /D_{{{\\text{RF}}}}$$ (3) HI, ICD, and DRF were non-carcinogenic
    risk indices (dimensionless), average daily exposure dosage (mg· (kg·d) −1), and
    reference dose (mg· (kg·d) −1), respectively. The risk threshold for non-carcinogenic
    chronic toxic effects of pollutants set by the USEPA is 1. When HI < 1, the non-carcinogenic
    health risk posed by pollutants to the human body is minimal, and the human body
    is only marginally impacted. When HI exceeds one, the impact of contaminants on
    human health cannot be ignored (Ravindra et al. 2019; Adimalla and Qian 2021).
    People may absorb nitrate by drinking water, washing their hands, bathing, and
    other water contact, and then nitrate enters the human body, harming the human
    body. The following is the formula for calculating the average daily exposure:
    $${I}_{CD}= {I}_{CD\\left(oral\\right)}+{I}_{CD({\\text{derm}})}$$ $${I}_{CD(oral)}=
    \\frac{C\\times IR\\times EF\\times ED}{BW\\times AT}$$ (4) $${I}_{CD(derm)}=
    \\frac{C\\times SA\\times {K}_{i}\\times EV\\times ET\\times EF\\times ED\\times
    CF}{BW\\times AT}$$ (5) where C represents the nitrate concentration in water,
    IR represents the daily intake rate, ABS represents the gastrointestinal absorption
    coefficient, EF represents the exposure frequency, ED represents the exposure
    duration, SA represents the exposed area of the skin, Ki represents the skin permeability
    coefficient of pollutants, ET represents the exposure frequency, EV represents
    the bathing frequency, and CF represents the volume conversion factor (Additional
    file 2: Table S2). Results and discussion Composition and chemical type of water
    Both surface water and groundwater are somewhat alkaline. The pH of surface water
    samples ranges from 6.98 to 8.26, with an average of 7.90 (Additional file 1:
    Table S1). The average TDS of surface water is 108.5 mg·L−1, whereas the average
    TDS of groundwater is 165.5 mg·L−1 (Additional file 1: Table S1), both of which
    are fresh water (1000 mg·L−1). The surface water exhibited lower total hardness
    and TDS than groundwater due to dilution from atmospheric precipitation and snow
    and ice meltwater (Liu et al. 2021a). Nitrate levels in surface water ranged from
    0.14 to 2.21 mg·L−1, with an average of 1.65 mg·L−1. Nitrate levels in groundwater
    range from 0.31 ~ 73.99 mg·L−1, with an average of 8.31 mg·L−1 (Table S1). The
    concentration of nitrate in groundwater is higher than that in surface water,
    owing mostly to the diluting impact of a substantial volume of ice and snowmelt
    water, which is consistent with the fact that the average content of all ions
    in groundwater is higher than that in surface water. Furthermore, surface water
    is typically dispersed in places with little human activity, but groundwater is
    primarily distributed in areas with a high population density, which is heavily
    influenced by human agricultural production activities. The piper plot can be
    used to analyze natural water''s hydrochemical history and find changes in primary
    ion composition (Jin et al. 2018; Zhao et al. 2018; Pérez-Moreno et al. 2020;
    Li et al. 2021; Xu et al. 2022b). It uses the chemical makeup of different bodies
    of water to define their control units, and its benefits are unaffected by human
    activities (Harkness et al. 2017; Ghezzi et al. 2019). The predominant chemical
    types of surface water and groundwater in this area are HCO3-Ca·Mg, and there
    is frequent exchange between them (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 Triangular diagram of major
    ions in surface water of Lhasa City Full size image Factors controlling the water
    chemistry Nature factors The Gibbs diagram may directly reflect the controlling
    variables of the primary ions in the research region''s water samples, as well
    as the sources of surface water and groundwater chemical components, such as evaporation-precipitation,
    meteoric precipitation, or rock weathering (Gibbs 1970; Rao et al. 2019). The
    atmospheric precipitation control zone has a lower dissolved total solid content
    (10 mg/L) and a higher Na+/(Na+  + Ca2+) and Cl−/(Cl− + HCO3−) ratio, which normally
    varies from 0.5 to 1. This position is at the lower right corner of the Gibbs
    plot, and the weathering zone of the rock is in the middle left, with TDS values
    ranging from 70 to 300 mg/L. The Na+/(Na+  + Ca2+) and Cl−/(Cl− + HCO3−) ratios
    are frequently less than 0.5; the evaporative crystallization control zone is
    located in the upper right corner of the graph, with a high TDS (> 300 mg/L) and
    a high Na+/(Na+  + Ca2+) ratio (0.5 ~ 1) (Zhang et al. 2023). The Na+/(Na+  + Ca2+)
    and Cl−/(Cl− + HCO3−) ratios varied from 0.037 to 0.429 and 0.004 to 0.142, respectively,
    with mean values of 0.041 and 0.181. The concentration of water samples in the
    middle of the Gibbs figure indicates that rock weathering has the largest impact
    on the ionic components of water samples (Fig. 3a, Fig. 3b). Fig. 3 TDS versus
    Na+/(Na+  + Ca2+) (a), TDS versus Cl−/(Cl− + HCO3−) (b), Ca2+/Na+ versus Mg2+/
    Na+ (c), Ca2+/Na+ versus HCO3−/ Na.+ (d) Full size image The type of hydrochemical
    weathering can be inferred by the concentration ratio of anion and cation in water
    (Li et al. 2018; Cai et al. 2020; Ma et al. 2020). The concentration ratio of
    Ca2+/Na+ produced by dissolved carbonate, silicate and evaporative are 50, 0.35
    and 0.17, respectively, and the concentration ratio of Mg2+/Na+ is 20, 0.24 and
    0.02, respectively (Cai et al. 2020; Ma et al. 2020). The values of Ca2+/Na+ and
    Mg2+/Na+ in water samples are 3.74 and 0.74, respectively, suggesting that weathering
    of silicate and carbonate is a significant source of water components (Fig. 3c,
    d). SI is commonly used to analyze the chemical composition of surface water as
    a result of mineral precipitation, equilibrium, dissolution, and evaporation (Xu
    et al. 2022b). In a few water samples, the SI of calcite and dolomite is greater
    than zero, indicating that carbonate rock is crystallizing and precipitating (Xu
    et al. 2022b). The saturation index of gypsum and halite is less than 0 in all
    water samples. This reveals that neither gypsum nor halite precipitation occurs
    at this site (Fig. 4a). Fig. 4 The SI of water (a), Cl− versus Na+ (b), H2SiO3
    versus Na+- Cl− (c), The ratios of (Ca2+  + Mg2+)/(Na+  + K+) (d), The plot of
    Chlor-Alkali Index (e), (Ca2+  + Mg2+) versus (HCO3− + SO4.2−) (f) Full size image
    Na+ and Cl− have a substantial association, showing that they come from the same
    source, such as precipitation and evaporation. The ratio of Na+/Cl− in precipitation
    is 0.86, while it is practically one in evaporation (Gil-Márquez et al. 2022).
    The value of Na+/Cl− varies from 0.39 to 21.53, with an average value of 4.68,
    and the great majority of samples fall outside of the 1:1 line (Fig. 4b). The
    association between H2SiO3 and Na+–Cl− is substantial (R2 = 0.5652, P < 0.01)
    (Fig. 4c), indicating that silicate weathering is a key source of Na+ in surface
    water. The ratios (Ca2+  + Mg2+)/(Na+  + K+) are frequently used to evaluate the
    contribution of different rocks to the chemical composition of surface water.
    The higher the ratio, the more hydrochemical components are derived from rock
    weathering and less from atmospheric precipitation and halite dissolution (Shen
    et al. 2021). In surface water, the ratio of (Ca2+  + Mg2+)/(Na+  + K+) varies
    from 1.15 to 10.94, with an average value of 5.39, while in groundwater, the ratio
    of (Ca2+  + Mg2+)/(Na+  + K+) ranges from 0.75 to 11.42, with an average value
    of 3.29 (Fig. 4d). This shows that the chemical composition of water is controlled
    by the weathering of rocks. The Chlor-Alkali Index (CAI-I and CAI-II) may determine
    whether or not there is a cation exchange process in the body of water (Shen et
    al. 2021; Huang et al. 2022; Yang et al. 2023). The most prevalent in surface
    water is the exchange of Ca-Na and Mg-Na. If Ca2+ and Mg2+ in water replace Na+
    and K+ in the aqueous medium, the index will be negative; otherwise, it will be
    positive. The greater the absolute value, the more probable the cation exchange
    effect will occur. The CAI-I values of the water samples varied from − 22.94 to
    0.56, with an average of − 4.47. CAI-II values for surface water samples varied
    from − 0.42 to − 0.02, with an average of − 0.15. The chlor-alkali indices of
    the vast majority of water samples are negative (Fig. 4e), suggesting that cation
    exchange in water is mostly attributable to the replacement of Na+ and K+ in the
    aqueous medium by Ca2+ and Mg2+, demonstrating that cation exchange is also a
    major source of Na+. The (Ca2+  + Mg2+) to (HCO3− + SO42−) ratio is close to one
    (Fig. 4f), and there is a significant relationship between them, indicating that
    ion-exchange adsorption in water is poor (Huang et al. 2022; Yang et al. 2023).
    Human activities Human activities can infiltrate the water in two ways: directly
    through waste discharge and indirectly through air intake. Agricultural and industrial
    operations have the most impact (Wang et al. 2021). Because nitrogen fertilizer
    used in agricultural operations accounts for the bulk of the NO3− in water samples,
    variations in the NO3− level of the water indicate the influence of agricultural
    and industrial activity. The NO3− /Na+ ratio in water is less than 1, showing
    that agricultural contamination has been reduced (Fan et al. 2014; Liu et al.
    2021b) (Fig. 5). Fig. 5 Relationship between NO3−/Na+ and Cl−/Na+ Full size image
    Water quality Because surface water and groundwater are all frequently utilized
    as drinking water and irrigation water in Lhasa. The test findings of F−, Cl−,
    NO3−, SO42−, Na+, pH, and TDS in water were utilized for assessment, and the results
    indicate that the WQI of surface water varies from 4.39 to 29.09, with an average
    of 16.28, and that of groundwater ranges from 8.53 to 22.81, with an average of
    14.14, with all WQI values less than 50, indicating good water quality (Fig. 6a).
    The WQI of surface water is relatively large along the Duilong river direction,
    with WQI values of 28.27, 29.09, and 27.90, respectively, which are higher than
    the average value of surface water WQI, which is related to the development of
    both sides of the river and the exploitation of geothermal resources in the upper
    reaches. The WQI of surface water is considerably high when the population is
    more concentrated. The WQI of groundwater is very concentrated, with a narrow
    fluctuation range. The primary contributors to WQI in surface water and groundwater
    are pH, F−, and TDS. The contributions of the major components of surface water
    to WQI are pH > F− > TDS > SO42− > Na+  > NO3− > Cl−, and the contributions of
    the major components of groundwater to WQI are pH > F− > TDS > SO42− > NO3− > Na+
     > Cl−, respectively. Fig. 6 WQI (a) and SAR (b) for the surface water and groundwater
    Full size image Ca2+ and Mg2+ are employed to replace sodium ions in clay minerals
    during the infiltration process of surface water. When Na+ in water replaces Ca2+
    and Mg2+ in soil, the soil loses its granular structure, resulting in widely scattered
    dirt, reduced porosity, and the formation of an impermeable layer, leading the
    soil to lose its capacity to hold fertilizer and water. Simultaneously, the high
    concentration of Na+ in the soil restricts the entry of Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe3+, and
    Mn2+ into plant cells, causing disruption to plant nutrient transport mechanisms
    and potentially crop damage and death. As a result, the SAR should be determined
    while analyzing water quality before installing an irrigation system to identify
    the harm caused by salt. According to the irrigation water assessment results,
    all samples in the research region had a small SAR value. The SAR of surface water
    varies from 0.10 to 0.88, with an average of 0.31; the SAR of groundwater ranges
    from 0.07 to 0.95, with an average of 0.34. The SAR of groundwater is somewhat
    greater than that of surface water. Both surface water and groundwater are suitable
    for irrigation. Both surface water and groundwater can be used for irrigation
    without causing soil sodium harm (Fig. 6b). Health risk assessment When nitrate
    is consumed, it combines with human blood to generate methemoglobin, producing
    palpitations, vomiting, shortness of breath, and other symptoms, and excessive
    consumption increases the risk of cancer and even death (Qasemi et al. 2018; Yu
    et al. 2020). The HI index of children and adults is significantly higher when
    drinking than when skin contact is made (Fig. 7a, b). The typical values of the
    HI index by drinking are 0.215 and 0.132, respectively, while those via skin contact
    are 0.006 and 0.004, respectively. The HI of total nitrate consumption in children
    and adults were 0.220 and 0.136, respectively. The mean HI indices of surface
    water ingestion were 0.053 and 0.033, respectively, while the mean HI indices
    of groundwater ingestion were 0.266 and 0.164. The results demonstrated that the
    non-carcinogenic health risk index of nitrate consumption increased with receiver
    age. In the research region, the values of HQoral, HQdermal, and HI of nitrate
    in surface water and groundwater are all less than one for children and adults,
    showing that nitrate in groundwater and surface water has no harmful effects on
    human health and poses no possible noncarcinogenic risk. Both surface and groundwater
    represent a larger risk of inhalation than skin contact, indicating that ingestion
    is the primary channel leading to noncarcinogenic risk in the human body, which
    is consistent with prior research (Zhang et al. 2015). Furthermore, children have
    higher HQoral, HQdermal, and HI values than adults, showing that under the same
    water medium, children are more vulnerable to the negative effects of NO3− than
    adults, which is consistent with prior study findings (Gao et al. 2019; Xiao et
    al. 2019). The total danger of groundwater is greater than that of surface water,
    which is consistent with Tong et al.''s research findings (Tong et al. 2021).
    One of the water samples had an HI index more than 1 for children and adults,
    necessitating close monitoring, source identification, control, and rational development.
    Fig. 7 Non-carcinogenic risks to children and adults from surface (a) and groundwater
    (b) Full size image Conclusions Lhasa has a special geological environment and
    water–rock interaction mechanism as a plateau city. Human activity has had less
    of an influence on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau''s ecology, and the chemical development
    of water is natural. The composition of the bedrock has a significant impact on
    the water chemistry of the rivers that pass through Lhasa. According to its hydrochemical
    properties, natural processes such as rock weathering have a greater effect on
    surface water than human activities. TDS is mostly produced by rock weathering
    as calcium and bicarbonate. The water samples are all clean, and the overall hardness
    is minimal; this is high-quality water that is suitable for drinking and agriculture.
    Groundwater has a greater nitrate non-carcinogenic risk index than surface water,
    which is frequently less impacted by human activities in collection and drainage.
    Nonetheless, groundwater is generally concentrated in areas with more human activity,
    resulting in a relative rise in nitrate content as well as an increase in the
    water quality index and hazard index. It is vital to increase monitoring, identify
    their sources, regulate them, and develop them responsibly for water sources with
    high risk indices. The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is not only China''s water tower
    but also a critically endangered ecosystem. A long-term study of the development
    of water quality and hydrochemistry in this region is critical.It may also be
    used to evaluate the hydrochemical evolution, water quality, and hazards of plateau
    urban surface water and groundwater. Data availability The data that support the
    findings of this study are available on request from the corresponding author.

  description: There is a mismatch between crop water demand, the spatial and temporal
    distribution of natural rainfall, surface water sources, and arable land resources
    in the North China Plain. This has been compensated for by massive groundwater
    exploitation, and as a result, ground water levels have continuously declined
    and groundwater landing funnels have formed in some areas. Consequently, there
    is an urgent need for the rational allocation of soil and water resources. In
    this study, regional soil types and the corresponding crops in Guangping County,
    Hebei Province, China, alongside the regional annual average total water consumption
    were used to determine reasonable allocations for crop planting structures, with
    an aim of maximizing the water utilization efficiency and economic benefits while
    also achieving a regional groundwater dynamic equilibrium. Daily meteorological
    data from 1973 to 2021, including precipitation, temperature, sunshine hours,
    wind speed, and humidity, as well as crop data, including irrigation systems and
    crop growth status, were collected. Water consumption models for eight soil types
    and seven typical crops forming 56 calculation partitions were established to
    obtain annual average water consumption values for the different crops. The maximum
    economic benefit and water-use efficiency were then used as the objective functions
    and total water consumption as the control condition for the non-dominated sorted
    genetic algorithm-Ⅱ (NSGA-II), to optimize the allocation of soil and water resources
    in the region; the adjusted quantities for the different crops cultivated under
    different soil types in the study area were obtained. The areas growing sweet
    potato and vegetable-fruits were found to increase by 0.5255 km2 and 4.4452 km2,
    respectively, when compared to the pre-optimization period, whereas the areas
    with winter wheat-summer maize, millet, peanut, cotton, and summer maize decreased
    by 1.3481 km2, 0.1812 km2, 0.7316 km2, 2.0896 km2, and 0.62 km2, respectively.
    The economic benefit increased from 810.37 to 853.64 million yuan, while the water-use
    efficiency increased from 1.5426 kg/m3 to 1.5859 kg/m3. The results provide a
    basis for soil and water resource management in the region and a technical reference
    for similar areas to improve agricultural water-use efficiency and economic benefits.

    Keywords Agricultural soil and water resourcesOptimal allocationWater consumptionWater-use
    efficiencyCrop planting structures 1. Introduction The optimal allocation of soil
    and water resources refers to the joint and sustainable management of water and
    agricultural land, using both scientific and technical means to alleviate water
    resource shortages and the deterioration of the ecological environment (Tan et
    al., 2017). Traditional research into the optimal allocation of agricultural soil
    and water resources is divided into two categories: the improvement of agricultural
    water-use efficiency and the adjustment of agricultural planting structures. Of
    these, the former is considered from the perspective of water use, and while it
    helps to reduce the excessive use of agricultural water sources, it requires a
    large financial input to build supporting facilities, as otherwise, crops are
    not adequately irrigated (Li et al., 2020a, Li et al., 2020b, Seyed Hoshiyar et
    al., 2021, Shangguan et al., 2002, Sharifi et al., 2021, Tork et al., 2021). In
    contrast, the latter is generally from the perspective of the planting layout,
    as the planting of crops considered to be water-saving can help to achieve water
    saving aims, but most of these studies have focused on the total amount of various
    types of crops, without consideration of other factors such as the soil (Chen
    and Liu, 2022, Li et al., 2020a, Li et al., 2020b, Luo et al., 2022, Sedighkia
    et al., 2023, Yu et al., 2021). The above results only have achieved certain results
    in the single allocation of water resources or land resources. However, soil and
    water resources were interrelated and mutually restricted (Li et al., 2022a, Li
    et al., 2022b). Changing one factor will lead to changes in other factors, and
    they cannot be simply optimized according to their order. To reflect the holistic
    nature of soil and water resource allocation, many scholars proposed a joint allocation
    method and optimized the allocation schemes in their corresponding study areas
    (Chen et al., 2023, Guo et al., 2022, Wang et al., 2023, Wang et al., 2022a, Wang
    et al., 2022b). Based on joint allocation, Li (2022), Zhang (2019), and Zhang
    et al., (2023) added a simulation study of future scenarios and proposed corresponding
    allocation schemes. In some regions, owing to insufficient precipitation, groundwater
    extraction is required to meet the actual regional irrigation demands. For example,
    Yue et al. (2011) optimized the allocation of Yellow River water and groundwater
    in 2020 and 2030 by coupling groundwater and surface water models, while Fu et
    al. (2014) used interval two stage stochastic planning to establish a joint surface
    water and groundwater dispatch model that realistically reflects the actual optimal
    allocation of water resources. The above research can provide decision-making
    guidance for soil and water resource management to a certain extent, but it does
    not consider the coupling degree and water consumption characteristics between
    the soils and crops. In terms of research scope, most studies have focused on
    medium and macro areas, such as watersheds (Banadkooki et al., 2022, Han et al.,
    2018a, Han et al., 2018b, Sun et al., 2019, Tingsanchali and Singh, 1996) and
    irrigation districts (Das et al., 2015, Martínez-Tunarroza et al., 2022, Sun et
    al., 2017). However, there is also research at the micro-scale (Tian and Jia,
    2007), albeit with lower precision. In addition, 3S technologies have also been
    utilized in water and land resource allocation research, and this has significantly
    enhanced the visualization and information processing abilities available for
    optimal water resource allocation. For example, Khanday and Javed (2016) used
    remote sensing to successfully prioritize river sub-basins in central India, and
    Lense et al. (2023) used a model combining GIS and RS to identify the most serious
    erosion phenomena in Brazilian crop areas. Although these studies have achieved
    results, the accuracy of the remote sensing images was 1000 m and 250 m, which
    was too rough for the study of water and soil resource allocation at the county
    scale, and thus higher precision remote sensing images are required to facilitate
    the needs of this research. For model creation, multi-objective programming has
    been widely used in the study of water and soil resource allocation. Li et al.
    (2022) constructed a multi-objective planting structure optimization model with
    the objectives of economic, ecological, and water-saving benefits, while Wu et
    al. (2022), under the framework of society, economy, and ecology, established
    multi-objective nonlinear planning to study the planting structure and irrigation
    water allocation scheme. Chang et al. (2023) constructed a multi-objective water
    resource optimal allocation model with social and economic benefits, while Habibi
    Davijani et al. (2016) applied a particle swarm algorithm to allocate water resources
    in Iranian regions, and Liu et al. (2017) optimized the allocation of soil and
    water resources in Jilin Province directly using multi-objective planning. As
    research progresses, scholars have found some data to be uncertain, such as incoming
    water and precipitation, in the optimal allocation of multi-objective soil and
    water resources, and these uncertainties greatly affect the actual crop water
    consumption (ETa) To attenuate for the error caused by these uncertainties, the
    potential water consumption (ET0) has been introduced for unification. For example,
    Kong (2022) calculated the daily ET0 from 1990 to 2019 and adjusted the cropping
    structure based on the reference evapotranspiration, while Han et al. (2018) optimized
    the cropping structure in the Heihe River Basin using remotely sensed evapotranspiration
    data and then analyzed the impacts of the results on water-use efficiency. Owing
    to the complexity of the environment, the ET0 and ETa were found to have considerable
    differences in different regions. Yang (2016) stated that in arid and semiarid
    overland areas, the potential evaporation and actual evaporation satisfy a symmetrical
    and complementary relationship, and the value of the ETa/ETp ranges from 0.16
    to 0.30. While several studies have investigated the optimal allocation of soil
    and water resources based on potential evapotranspiration, the optimal allocation
    of soil and water resources based on actual farmland water consumption averaged
    over many years has rarely been reported. In terms of water constraints, the optimal
    allocation of agricultural water and soil resources was mostly studied with the
    total amount of irrigation water as the control target. Lv (2022), based on the
    minimum water consumption of crops, predicted the water demand of agricultural
    cultivation and established a model for the adjustment of the agricultural cultivation
    structure. While Li (2022) used Penman’s formula to predict crop water demand
    and analyzed the contradiction between the supply and demand of irrigation water
    resources to optimize the planting structure. Taking the total amount of irrigation
    water in Beijing as a constraint, Zeng (2018) applied the multi-objective planning
    method to propose a direction for optimizing the structure of Beijing’s plantation
    industry. Furthermore, Yang et al. (2019), Zhang et al. (2023) also optimized
    planting structures by targeting the total amount of irrigation. With the expansion
    of the irrigation area and improvement of the irrigation water use efficiency,
    the groundwater overexploitation situation has not yet been significantly improved.
    It was recognized that water saving in the traditional sense cannot reflect the
    actual amount of water resources saved. To explore the actual saving situation,
    Pei et al. (2007) suggested the phrase “water consumption and water saving” and
    compared it with “water intake and water saving.” The water consumption and water
    saving potential of Ningxia was found to be far less than that of the water intake
    and water saving potential. Qin et al. (2008) then systematically studied the
    basic theory and quantitative calculation method for the regional target ET, and
    proposed that the total water consumption refers to the maximum allowable consumption
    of regional water resources for sustainable utilization, and constructed a set
    of regional target ET calculation methods. Liu (2014) put forward a technical
    framework for controlling real water saving in the region by the total amount
    of regional water consumption (i.e., regional target ET), and extended the water
    saving focus on water intake to the water saving of real water consumption. The
    above studies found that only by reducing invalid water consumption can real water
    savings be realized, and the method of controlling the invalid water consumption
    was called agricultural ET management. However, few optimization models consider
    the joint allocation of soil and water resources and the agricultural target ET.
    Guangping County of Hebei Province is predominantly an agricultural planting area.
    Their over-exploitation of the available groundwater resources has enabled high
    and stable agricultural yields, but has also caused continuous declines in the
    groundwater level, and this represents the main water resource problem faced by
    the entire North China Plain area. On December 24, 2021, the Water Saving Regulations
    of Hebei Province (2021) was promulgated, and it clearly states that ''agricultural
    water saving should improve irrigation efficiency by adjusting the structure of
    soil and water resources''. This study was centered in Guangping County and uses
    3S technology to assess the adaptability of soil and crops and coordinate the
    allocation of their annual average ETa. The NSGA-II genetic algorithm was used
    as the core mothod, with water use efficiency and economic benefits as the objective
    functions, and the agricultural target ET as the boundary conditions to construct
    a multi-objective optimization model for agricultural soil and water resources,
    to provide an effective decision support for agricultural development and water-saving
    irrigation. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Study area The study area was Guangping
    County, Handan, China, which is situated in the south of Hebei Province, between
    longitude 114°84′ and 115°19′ east and latitude 36°37′ and 36°62′ north, the area
    is 31.4 km long, 27.0 km wide, and 320 km2 (Fig. 1). The average annual precipitation
    is 514.9 mm, and the average annual water surface evaporation is 1038.6 mm. The
    terrain of the county is relatively gentle, with a gradual decrease from southwest
    to northeast. The altitude ranges from 40.0 to 53.9 m, with a maximum height difference
    of 13.9 m. The area is mainly used to grow food crops (predominantly winter wheat
    and summer maize), cash crops (predominantly cotton and vegetables), oil crops
    (predominantly peanuts and rapeseed), and small miscellaneous grains (predominantly
    millet, soybeans, and mung beans). The summer harvest consists mainly of winter
    wheat, and the remaining grains are harvested in the autumn. Download : Download

    Soil Database (HWSD) soil data, meteorological data (precipitation, temperature,
    sunshine hours, wind speed, and humidity), land use data, sentinel-2 remote sensing
    image data, and field experiment data (Wang et al., 2022a, Wang et al., 2022b),
    water resources data and water using data, etc. Field experiment data were collected
    at 12 monitoring points, including soil moisture content, leaf area index (LAI),
    crop height (CH) and root depth (RD). CH and RD were measured with a tape measure;
    LAI was measured by ACCUPAR-LP80 canopy leaf area analyzer. Soil water content
    was measured by soil moisture monitor. It was measured every 5–7 days from the
    beginning of crop emergence, and was measured again after 10 h of precipitation
    and 24 h of irrigation, until the crop was harvested. The measurement depth is
    0–10 cm, 10–30 cm, 30–60 cm, 60–200 cm, half for calibration, and the other half
    for verification. In this paper, the spatial resolution of all raster data was
    resampled to 10 m × 10 m for subsequent research. Details of the data are shown
    in Table 1, the soil mechanical composition is shown in Table 2, and the crop
    growth data are shown in Fig. 2, Fig. 3. Table 1. Data content and sources used

    point collection Field sample point collection was carried out from August 1,
    2021 to August 15, 2021. The survey was conducted using sub-meter-level ICE980
    RTK handheld GPS. The instrument measurement coordinates were defined as the WGS-84
    coordinate system, and the measured values were geographical coordinates. When
    collecting sample points, it was necessary to ask local farmers about the planting
    of winter wheat in the first half of 2021. The distribution of field sample points
    is shown in Fig. 4. Download : Download high-res image (393KB) Download : Download

    2.4. Methods 2.4.1. Extraction of the crop planting structure In this study, seven
    typical crops were selected for planting structure identification: winter wheat-summer
    maize, summer maize, cotton, sweet potatoes, millet, peanuts, and vegetable-fruits.
    As a result of the short growth cycle of vegetable-fruits, the variety of planted
    species, and the serious fragmentation of the planted area, the extraction of
    sample points was inconvenient. This study thus provides a unified generalization
    of the vegetable-fruits, and the remaining six crops were extracted using the
    random forest algorithm. When using this algorithm to extract data, the 32 remote
    sensing images were pre-processed, and their Normalized Difference Vegetation
    Index (NDVI) was calculated (Sun et al., 2021). The formula used was as follows:
    (1) where represents the reflectance in the near-infrared band, and represents
    the reflectance in the red band. The NDVI of general crops ranges from 0 to 1,
    and the magnitude of this value is related to the degree of lush crop growth,
    i.e., the closer the value is to 1, the more luxuriant the crop growth. According
    to the phenological characteristics for the crops in Guangping, six NDVI images
    from February 1, April 17, June 6, July 31, September 29, and December 18 were
    selected as representatives to analyze phenological characteristic consistency.
    In the experimental area of Guangping County, 20 artificial sample points were
    then selected for each crop. The NDVI values of the artificial sample points for
    each crop were fitted with Lorenz curves, which were divided into six types as
    follows: winter wheat-summer maize, summer maize, cotton, sweet potatoes, millets,
    and peanuts. As the random forests require a higher number of sample points, the
    artificial samples were expanded according to the fitted curve and 70 % were used
    for classification and 30 % for verification. The sample points were input into
    the random forest for classification, and the accuracy was then assessed using
    the confusion matrix. We set 90 % accuracy as a required criterion. If the simulation
    results failed to satisfy the accuracy requirement, they were expanded by adding
    500 sample points each time until the accuracy reached the required level. The
    formulas used were as follows: (2) (3) (4) where K is the number of trees in the
    random forest, x is the category is the weight of the crop type, is the overall
    classification accuracy is the total number of correctly classified image elements
    in n classes of features, is the number of true sample image elements in n classes
    of features is the number of image elements in the sample classified as n classes
    of features, n is the total number of categories in the classification results,
    and N is the number of image elements in the sample. The Kappa coefficient ranged
    from 0 to 1, with <0.6 indicating a poor classification effect, 0.6–0.8 indicating
    a good level of accuracy, and >0.8, indicating a high degree of consistency between
    the classification results and the real features. 2.4.2. Regional water consumption
    For regional water consumption calculations, the region was first divided into
    several sub-regions (referred to as calculation zones) according to factors, including
    those for the soil and crops. The attributes of each point in the sub-region were
    the same, and water consumption for each sub-region can be expressed by the point
    water consumption multiplied by its area. The point water consumption was obtained
    using the crop water consumption model and the survey method. Finally, the water
    consumption of the whole region was obtained by classifying and summarizing the
    water consumption of the sub-region. Guangping County has a small area with little
    change in meteorological scale, and consequently, the sowing, irrigation and harvest
    times for crops have been unified and generalized. Overall, only 8 soil types
    and 7 crop types were used for calculation zones, which were divided into 7 ×
    8 = 56 calculation zones. Each calculation zone contains only one soil type element
    and one crop type element. As the vegetable-fruits did not meet the input conditions
    for the SWAP model, the soil water consumption of 48 calculation areas without
    vegetable-fruits was obtained using the SWAP model, while the remaining 8 calculation
    areas with vegetable-fruits were obtained by investigation. The investigation
    method used involved multiplying the data of the multiple cropping index of the
    vegetable-fruits surveyed in the local area with the water consumption of the
    vegetable-fruits estimated by the Water Demand and Water Consumption Management
    of Major Crops in Northern China (Kang et al., 2018). When using the SWAP model
    to simulate the water consumption of 48 calculation zones, the crop parameters
    of 6 crops on the same soil were calibrated using field experiment data from Guangping
    Experimental Station, and then the calibrated crop parameters were used to simulate
    water consumption for 8 different soils. The SWAP model calculates the water consumption
    rate of a crop using the Penman-Monteith equation, which uses accurate weather
    data to estimate the potential water consumption rate. The equation used was as
    follows: (5) where is the potential water consumption rate, (mm/d); is the slope
    of the water vapor pressure curve, (kPa/℃); is the latent heat of vaporization,
    (J/kg); is the net radiation flux at the canopy surface, (J/[m2·d]); G is the
    soil heat flux, (J/[ m2·d]); is the unit conversion factor with a value of 86
    400, (s/d); is the air density, (kg/m−3); is the heat capacity of moist air, (J/[kg·℃]);
    is the saturation vapor pressure, (kPa); is the actual vapor pressure, (kPa);
    is the psychormetric consrant, (kPa/℃); is the crop resistance, (s/m); and is
    the aerodynamic resistance, (s/m). Four parts are required to input the SWAP model,
    including borders, meteorology, soil, and crops. The upper boundary is the crop
    canopy, and the lower boundary is the bottom zero flux. The meteorological part
    is the actual measured meteorological data for Guangping station, including daily
    data, such as average temperature, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, relative
    humidity, wind speed, sunshine hours, and rainfall. For the soil part, the existing
    soil layer needs to be manually stratified according to the SWAP User Manual (Kroes
    et al., 2017). In this study, the 2-m soil layer is divided into 4 layers and
    40 cells. The first, second, and fourth layers each contain 10 cells, and the
    thickness of each cell is 1, 2, and 14 cm. The third layer contains 5 cells, and
    the thickness of each cell is 6 cm. For the crops, a simple module for static
    crop growth was selected that requires the leaf area index, plant height, and
    root depth for typical crops. The initial crop canopy resistance for each crop
    was selected as 65 s/m, as suggested by VanDam, and each critical pressure head
    for calculating the water-stress discount factor was selected, as suggested by
    Wesseling et al. The maximum root depth was set at 200 cm, as suggested by Doorenbos,
    and the root length density distribution was assumed to be a straight line descending
    along the soil plumb. When the SWAP model was verified, because the crop water
    consumption was difficult to measure directly, it was indirectly characterized
    by the change in soil water content. When the simulation accuracy of the soil
    water content meets the requirements, it can be said that the model was applicable
    to the study area. The crop parameters of six crops were calibrated using 1028
    observed data, from soil moisture monitors in the experimental plots of the study
    area from 2020 to 2021, and the R2, mean relative error (MRE) and root mean square
    error (RMSE) indexes were used for judgment. R2 is the index for judging the fitting
    degree between the measured value and the simulated value. The MRE compares the
    deviation of the simulated values from the measured values, while the RMSE reflects
    the error between the simulated and observed values and is generally controlled
    within 0.2. The formulas used were as follows: (6) (7) (8) where is the simulated
    value of the ith observation; is the ith observation; is the average of observation
    values; and n is the number of observations. 2.4.3. Farmland target ET The farmland
    target ET is the regional target ET minus the residential, industrial, environmental,
    and other targets, as follows: (9) where is the agricultural target ET, is the
    regional target ET, is the residential target ET, is the industrial target ET,
    is the environmental target ET, and denotes water target ET for other water users.
    In the regional water balance, the sum of the precipitation and regional inflows
    minus the regional outflows equals the target ET. As there are no natural streams
    in Guangping County, the regional target ET is equal to the sum of the multi-year
    average precipitation and water transfers from outside the basins: (10) where
    is the average precipitation over the years (m3) and is the external water supply
    (m3). Each target ET was obtained by multiplying the amount of water used by each
    sector by the evapotranspiration coefficient. (11) where denotes the water consumption
    of the residential water use; denotes the water consumption of industrial production;
    denotes the water consumption of environmental water use; denotes the water consumption
    of water use by other water users; and denotes the coefficient of evapotranspiration,
    0.6–0.8, in this study. As we seek the minimum target ET of the farmland, we take
    η = 0.8, and denotes the area. 2.4.4. Multi-optimal allocation model for soil
    and water resources To investigate the optimal allocation of agricultural soil
    and water resources under the control of the regional multi-year average total
    water consumption, this study has established a multi-objective optimal allocation
    model for water and soil resources with NSGA-II as the core algorithm, which sets
    two objective functions and four constraints. 2.4.4.1. Objective functions In
    this study, the objective function is constructed from the two key aspects, economic
    benefits and water-use efficiency. ① The economic benefits were expressed by the
    maximum net income of regional crops, as follows: (12) where, is the price of
    the jth crop (yuan/kg), is the costs of the jth crop (yuan/kg) is the yield of
    the jth crop (kg/km2), is the area of the jth crop, and n is the number of crop
    types. ② Water-use efficiency was expressed by the maximum capacity of unit water
    consumption under the multi-year average, as follows: (13) where, is the area
    planted of the jth crop type of the ith soil type, is the multi-year average water
    consumption of the jth crop type of the ith soil type, and m is the number of
    soil type. 2.4.4.2. Constraint The four constraint sets were the adjusted area,
    water quantity, sown area, and non-negative variables considering the soil type
    and crop requirements, cultivated area, and total water resources in the study
    area. ① For the adjustment area constraint, the minimum and maximum values were
    obtained by multiplying the current area by the reduction and increase factors,
    respectively, as follows: (14) where is the area planted for the jth crop type
    of the ith soil type, is the current area planted for the jth crop type of the
    ith soil type (km2), is the decrease factor for the jth crop type of the ith soil
    type, and is the increase factor for the jth crop type of the ith soil type. ②
    For the water quantity constraint, the total water consumption of the farmland
    after setting the adjustment is ≤ to the target ET of the farmland: (15) where
    is the target ET of the farmland (m3). ③ For the sown area constraint, the total
    area of the farmland for each soil type after optimization of the cropping structure
    was equal to the current area, as follows: (16) where is the current total area
    of ith soil type (km2). ④ For the non-negative variables constraint, the decision
    variable is 0 (17) 2.4.4.3. Process for solving the NSGA-II algorithm The NSGA-II
    algorithm was used to solve the multi-objective optimization model (Deb et al.,
    2000). The model was programmed in MATLAB with the following parameters: population
    size of 100 and the number of iterations was 600. The flow of the algorithm is
    as follows (Fig. 5): Download : Download high-res image (300KB) Download : Download

    Results 3.1. Crop planting structure 3.1.1. Spatial distribution of the data representing
    the NDVI The NDVI spatial distribution map (Fig. 6) shows that the highest NDVI
    values for most areas occur in mid-April and at the end of July, as the main crops
    in Guangping County are winter wheat and summer maize. The NDVI values on February
    1 ranged from 0.2 to 0.4, and this was because the period coincided with the green-returning
    period when winter wheat grows more vigorously. The NDVI values on April 17 and
    July 31 ranged from 0.7 to 0.9, as the end of April was in the heading stage when
    winter wheat grew extremely vigorously, and the end of July was in the filling
    stage when the summer maize grew most vigorously. Most of the NDVI values on June
    6 and September 29 were relatively low and ranged from 0.2 to 0.3. This was because
    early June was when winter wheat was being harvested, and summer maize or other
    crops were being sown, and late September was the end of autumn when most of the
    crops were being harvested, with only cotton and other late-autumn crops remaining.
    The NDVI value was higher than 0.4 in most areas on December 18, which was because
    the areas planted with winter wheat had just emerged. The spatial distribution
    and change rules were consistent with the actual planting situation, indicating
    that the data can be used for planting structure identification and extraction.

    3.1.2. Selection of sample point The Lorentz fitting curves for typical crops
    are shown in Fig. 7, and the results were similar to the actual phenological characteristics,
    indicating that the curves accurately describe the crop NDVI time series and can
    be used to exploit these differences for planting structure extraction. According
    to the Lorenz curve results, a total of 39,864 sample points satisfying 6 fitting
    curves were randomly selected from the pre-processed time-series NDVI images using
    a visual interpretation method, of which 70 % were used as training data and 30
    % as verification data (Fig. 8). Download : Download high-res image (359KB) Download

    structures The distribution of six typical crops in Guangping County extracted
    from the remote sensing data is shown in Fig. 9, and an evaluation of the accuracy
    of the classification results is presented in Table 3. The overall accuracy of
    the classification results was 97.72 %, and the Kappa coefficient was 0.9662.
    Both the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient were >0.9, which indicates that
    the overall quality of the classification was accurate. The mapping accuracies
    for the winter wheat-summer maize, summer maize, sweet potato, and millet were
    all >95 % and that of the winter wheat-summer maize was as high as 98.77 %, indicating
    that the misclassification of these crops was extremely low, and the classification
    results were basically correct. For cotton and peanut, which have slightly lower
    mapping accuracies because of their smaller planting areas and lower total number
    of validation samples, the misclassification of one point will interfere greatly
    with the mapping accuracy. However, the overall user accuracy was >85 %, indicating
    that the chance of mutual misclassification between categories was extremely low,
    and the classification results were accurate. Download : Download high-res image

    200.8745 As can be seen from the spatial distribution structures, the areas sown
    with winter wheat-summer maize rotations, and summer maize monocultures were the
    largest, accounting for approximately 70 % of the total study area, with a higher
    proportion of cultivation in the Nanyangbao, Shilipu, and Nanhan towns. Cotton
    had a larger range in the south-central part of Guangping County and was mainly
    distributed in southern Pinggudian, western Shilipu, and southern Shengying. The
    remaining crops were sporadically distributed. 3.2. Regional water consumption
    3.2.1. Calibration and validation results for SWAP models The calibration and
    validation results for the SWAP model crop parameters are shown in Table 5. The
    results showed that the calibration and validation measured values were fitted
    well with the modeled values, with the RMSE < 0.040 cm3/cm3, MRE < 10 %, and R2
    > 0.8, and the model was also shown to have a high simulation accuracy for soil
    water content and could be used to analyze crop water consumption in Guangping
    County. The calibrated model parameters are listed in Table 6. Table 5. Calibration

    zones Due to the variety of vegetable-fruits and the complexity of the crop rotations,
    this study uniformly generalized the water consumption of vegetable-fruits. According
    to an actual investigation, the replanting index of vegetable-fruits in Guangping
    County is 3, the average water consumption is 500 mm, and it is impossible to
    subdivide the water consumption of the different soils. The total water consumption
    of the vegetable-fruits in all soils was thus set as 1500 mm. The annual average
    water consumption for the 56 calculation zones is presented in Table 8. Table

    maize both increased and decreased. 4. Discussion 4.1. Superiority of soil and
    water resource optimal allocation based on ET The allocation of soil and water
    resources is primarily based on visible water resources such as surface water
    and groundwater resources; the optimal allocation of soil and water resources
    via the control of invisible water consumption such as the regional agricultural
    target ET is a new strategy. For the water-saving irrigation in agriculture in
    Guangping, more attention was paid to the matching of irrigation and drainage
    channels and canal buildings, as well as the construction of engineering facilities
    such as channel seepage control and adoption of advanced irrigation technology,
    which was in turn used to improve the utilization rate of irrigation water and
    enhance the productivity capacity to increase drought-resistant yields. However,
    these water-saving irrigation efforts have several limitations. First, attention
    was paid to improving the utilization rate of water in the irrigation area, and
    the carrying capacity of water resources was disregarded, leading to the over-exploitation
    of water resources, disruption of the ecological balance, and unsustainable development
    of regional water resources. Second, water saving utilizing engineering methods
    was emphasized, whereas insufficient attention was paid to the water-saving role
    of agricultural measures, leading to an oversight of the substantive issues of
    water-saving irrigation (Zhang, 2009). This is because water saving via engineering
    measures focuses on reducing the loss and seepage of irrigation water, whereas
    water saving using agricultural techniques focuses in reducing the amount of water
    released from the farmland (Zheng, 2007). Considering water resource development
    and utilization holistically, the effects of the two ways of saving water are
    very different (Liu, 2007). Third, via the current management of agricultural
    water-saving irrigation, a set of effective management methods to change the status
    quo of irrigation management has not been established because of the long-term
    influence of the operation mechanism. The above results show that the traditional
    concept of water conservation was more about water-using conservation than water
    resource conservation. For example, traditional irrigation water conservation
    was measured by determining the increase in the effective utilization rate of
    irrigation water, and the effectiveness of water conservation was evaluated based
    on the expansion of water-saving irrigated areas (Wang and Li, 2008). The use
    of the saved water to enhance reproduction failed to meet the new demand. Developing
    water-saving irrigation according to this philosophy will only increase, not decrease,
    water consumption (Yin et al., 2009). ET is the amount of water evaporation and
    transpiration, which is the amount of invisible and intangible water lost into
    the air. The control and management of ET is achieved via the control and management
    of controllable water consumption indicators. To make ET management feasible,
    the relationship between regional ET indicators and controllable water use indicators
    (such as irrigation quota, irrigation water use, surface water diversion, groundwater
    extraction, etc.) needs to be established, and the ET needs to be controlled and
    managed by regulating water use indicators. The optimal allocation model of agricultural
    water and soil resources proposed in this study considers the total water consumption
    of farmlands, the suitability of crops to soil, economic benefits, and water use
    efficiency. In particular, it considers the overall water consumption level of
    regional farmlands and focuses on crop growth and distribution. On this basis,
    the relationship between the regional farmland target ET and land resource utilization
    mode is established, facilitating our proposal of the optimization scheme of water
    and soil resources that is relatively consistent with the sustainable development
    of resources. 4.2. Rationality of model simulation The optimal allocation of soil
    and water resources is not merely a single adjustment or the construction of a
    complex model of joint allocation but also considers the nature of different soils
    to ensure that “water” is included in the “soil” and then adjusted for the planting
    structure. Thus, the purpose of the general configuration was achieved, and the
    complexity of the joint configuration was considerably simplified. When constructing
    the model, Liu (2014) referred to real water consumption, and consequently, the
    target ET for farmland was used as the control total, which extended water conservation
    and focused on irrigation water to real water consumption to determine real water-saving.
    When constructing the objective function, the average water consumption of crops
    over 48 years was introduced, which not only successfully completes the configuration
    in the multi-year situation but also simplifies the originally complex objective
    function and greatly improves computational efficiency. When selecting the algorithm,
    we compared NSGA-II and NSGA with hyper volume index, and the calculated results
    were 0.0164 and 0.0089, respectively. Because the larger the index, the more optimized
    the performance of the algorithm, NSGA-2 was chosen as the optimization algorithm
    in this study. In the optimization configuration, the population sizes of 50,
    100, 200 and 500 were selected for simulation verification, and the simulation
    iteration time of 600 times was 76.93 s, 165.17 s, 534.18 s, and 3075.36 s, respectively.
    The larger the population, the longer the running time. The running time of 500
    populations is approximately 39.97 times that of 50 populations. When the population
    size is 50, 100, 200, and 500, the number of iterations is 230, 180, 120 and 95
    times, respectively. The larger the population, the smaller the number of iterations
    during convergence. We further analyzed the simulation results of the model. Soil
    and water resource allocation in Guangping County have been studied extensively;
    however, studies of joint soil and water resource allocation are few, and most
    of them are related to the adjustment of the planting structure. For example,
    Kong (2022) included our study area in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei configuration.
    The results of their research reduced the area of peanut and cotton in Guangping
    County by 188.87 hm2 and 225.80 hm2, respectively, which is similar to the optimization
    results from this study, as the areas for peanut and cotton were reduced by 73.16
    hm2 and 208.96 hm2, respectively. This indicates that the adjustment results for
    these two categories are reasonable. However, distinct differences were observed
    in the specific values. This may be because of the randomness of NSGA-II genetic
    algorithm during iteration. Zhang et al. (2022) proposed that the planting area
    for wheat and maize be reduced and that of potatoes and vegetables increased to
    optimize planting structures in Hebei. Cui et al. (2023) adjusted the planting
    structure of crops in Handan from the perspective of water resources and concluded
    that the sown areas for wheat and maize could be reduced by 77,000 hm2 and 189,400
    hm2, respectively. The above article does not show specific elevations or reductions
    in Guangping County; however, the general conclusions, i.e., reducing the sown
    area of winter wheat-summer maize and summer maize while increasing the area for
    potatoes and vegetables, were consistent with those of the present study. 4.3.
    Limitations and prospects of this study When using remote sensing to extract planting
    structures, the Sentinel-2 data reported by Liu (2022) and the random forest algorithm
    reported by Li and Xiong (2021) were predominantly used in the present study to
    identify the major crops at a county scale for the planted area statistics. This
    reduced the impact of the original manual statistics on the planted area of crops
    and led to an increase in the degree of refinement. The extraction results were
    basically consistent with the planting area in the statistical yearbook (Zhang,
    2012–2021), indicating that the extraction of the planting structure was successful.
    However, as the planting area for crops is relatively broken, the remote sensing
    image with 10-m spatial resolution in this study had a greater error when identifying
    crops with a planting area of <100 m2, resulting in poor accuracy of classification
    results in these mixed and broken areas. In the future, higher resolution remote
    sensing images such as Gaofen-2 will be used to improve the accuracy of classification
    results for these complex areas to obtain more accurate planting structure distribution
    maps. Crop water consumption was primarily determined using the SWAP model and
    investigation. Zhang et al. (2011) concluded that the water consumption of summer
    maize ranged from 375.7 to 396.2 mm, whereas that of winter wheat-summer maize
    ranged from 777.1 to 854.8 mm, which was consistent with the results obtained
    in the present study and numerous previous studies (Li et al., 2007, Liu et al.,
    2002). Considering the effects of soil type on water consumption, the values for
    the maximum water consumption minus minimum water consumption were, in descending
    order, as follows: sweet potato, peanut, summer maize, winter wheat-summer maize,
    millet, and cotton. The differences between the maximum and minimum water consumption
    value for cotton was 4.3 mm, which indicates that the soil type has relatively
    little influence on cotton. The difference in water consumption for sweet potato
    was 82.5 mm, indicating that the soil type has relatively considerable influence.
    As crop growth data are difficult to obtain, the SWAP model was used in the present
    study to simulate crop growth, using a simple crop module that requires relatively
    few data. However, certain limitations were observed in the simple crop module
    and detailed crop module. In future research, detailed crop modules or coupling
    with other crop models should be considered for simulating the water consumption
    characteristics that were more in line with the actual crop growth. The multi-objective
    optimization model is used to allocate soil and water resources because the optimal
    allocation of water and soil resources is a very complex process, involving natural,
    social, and other factors. Because of limitations of data and research time, this
    study only considered the influence of crop and soil factors when determining
    the influencing factors of water use. The difference in water quality factors
    in different regions, the loss of canal systems in the irrigation process, and
    the leakage of the canal system were not considered. When the model was constructed,
    the price fluctuation of crops did not consider the choice of farmers'' crops
    and planting scale in the second year and the estimation of crop yield under different
    water consumption conditions. In response to these problems, in subsequent research,
    more data will be collected when constructing the model, and additional models
    will be applied to improve the accuracy of the optimal configuration. 5. Conclusions
    In this study, the collected basic meteorological and field trial data was combined
    with GIS, the SWAP model, and the multi-objective optimization model based on
    the regional soil types and corresponding suitable cultivation crops. The optimal
    allocation of the soil and water resources were then determined by controlling
    the regional annual average total water consumption and maximizing the economic
    benefits and water-use efficiency as the objective functions. After optimization,
    the economic benefit and water use efficiency were 853.64 billion yuan and 1.5859
    kg/m3, respectively; the economic benefit and water use efficiency increased by
    0.4327 billion yuan and 0.0433 kg kg/m3, respectively. The results show that multi-objective
    soil and water resource allocation are feasible when based on economic benefits
    and water-use efficiency. The research model and method were determined using
    the total annual average water consumption of Guangping County and the planting

  limitations: 'The research model and method were determined using the total annual
    average water consumption of Guangping County and the planting structure adjustments
    for different crops in different soils and will thus, enable the development of
    highly credible adjustment programs and methods in the future.


    However, the study has methodological limitations that could be addressed in future
    research. First, crop price fluctuations were not considered when determining
    farmers'' choices of crops and planting scales in the second year. Second, crop
    yields under different water consumption conditions were not estimated. Third,
    the water quality factors in different regions, the loss of canal systems in the
    irrigation process, and the leakage of the canal system were not considered.


    Addressing these limitations will enhance the accuracy and reliability of the
    optimal configuration and provide more comprehensive insights for decision-making
    in agricultural soil and water resource management.'

  title: 'Optimal allocation of soil and water resources in agriculture under the
    total regional evapotranspiration indicator: A case study in Guangping, China'
  verbatim_quote1: '"Daily meteorological data from 1973 to 2021, including precipitation,
    temperature, sunshine hours, wind speed, and humidity, as well as crop data, including
    irrigation systems and crop growth status, were collected. Water consumption models
    for eight soil types and seven typical crops forming 56 calculation partitions
    were established to obtain annual average water consumption values for the different
    crops. The maximum economic benefit and water-use efficiency were then used as
    the objective functions and total water consumption as the control condition for
    the non-dominated sorted genetic algorithm-Ⅱ (NSGA-II), to optimize the allocation
    of soil and water resources in the region; the adjusted quantities for the different
    crops cultivated under different soil types in the study area were obtained."'
  verbatim_quote2: '"The areas growing sweet potato and vegetable-fruits were found
    to increase by 0.5255 km2 and 4.4452 km2, respectively, when compared to the pre-optimization
    period, whereas the areas with winter wheat-summer maize, millet, peanut, cotton,
    and summer maize decreased by 1.3481 km2, 0.1812 km2, 0.7316 km2, 2.0896 km2,
    and 0.62 km2, respectively. The economic benefit increased from 810.37 to 853.64
    million yuan, while the water-use efficiency increased from 1.5426 kg/m3 to 1.5859

- analysis: The study applies multivariate statistical techniques (Principal Component
    Analysis) and a geostatistical method (Ordinary Kriging) to examine trace element
    concentrations and their spatial distribution within an aquifer, considering both
    geogenic and anthropogenic influences. The researchers utilize physical and chemical
    data collected from groundwater samples at two different time points, representing
    the peak recharge period and the end of summer. The analysis reveals the natural
    quality of the aquifer (PC1) and identifies human activities, primarily agriculture,
    as the main factor contributing to groundwater quality variations. Other principal
    components identify elements of industrial origin that pose health risks. The
    study highlights the impact of reduced natural recharge during dry periods on
    the increase in trace element concentrations and the potential implications for
    water resource quality management.

    could pose a significant toxic risk for health, due to direct consumption or bioaccumulation
    through the ingestion of vegetables irrigated with this water. This paper studies
    the presence of 41 trace elements plus nitrate and bromate in groundwater, using
    a multivariate statistical tool based on Principal Component Analysis and a geostatistical
    Kriging method to map the results. Principal Component Analysis revealed 11 significant
    principal components, which account for 82% and 81% of the total variance (information)
    respectively for the two dates analysed. Ordinary Kriging was applied to draw
    maps of the trace elements and PC scores. This research breaks new ground in terms
    of the large number of parameters used and in terms of the analysis of spatiotemporal
    variations in these parameters. The results obtained indicate that PC1 represents
    the natural quality of the aquifer (geogenic) and that there is little change
    in the average PC1 value between the two dates studied (June near the peak recharge
    point and November at the end of summer). Agriculture is the human activity that
    causes the greatest variations in the quality of the groundwater due to the use
    of fertilizers and due to watering crops with wastewater (PC7_J and PC5_N, June
    and November, respectively). Other elements of industrial origin, which are dangerous
    for human health, such as Pb, Cu and Cd, are grouped together in other principal
    components. The results show that the decline, or even complete absence, of natural
    recharge during the summer months leads to an increase in the TEs produced by
    human activity. This indicates that a temporary reduction in the natural recharge
    could worsen the quality of water resources. Based on the interpretation of the
    estimated maps, a synthetic map was created to show the spatial distribution of
    the areas affected by geogenic and anthropogenic factors. Studies with a global
    approach like this one are necessary in that the possible sources of pollution
    that could alter the quality of the groundwater and the amount of trace elements
    and other potentially harmful substances could increase as time goes by. The main
    advantage of the methodology proposed here is that it reduces the number of parameters,
    so simplifying the results. This makes it easier to interpret the results and
    manage the quality of the water.

    • PCA and geostatistical methods were used to establish the spatiotemporal variations
    in 41 trace elements. • A complex spatial relationship between anthropogenic and
    geogenic activities was reduced to just six categories. • The anthropogenic activity
    with the greatest impact on groundwater quality is agriculture. • Evaporitic rocks
    were the main cause of geogenic contamination of the groundwater. Abstract The

    data analysis Geospatial data Download data 1. Introduction The increasing development
    of industrial, agricultural, and residential activities is causing a progressive
    deterioration in the natural quality of aquifers. Many of the trace elements (TEs)
    detected in groundwaters have been classified as toxic agents that are dangerous
    for human health (Boente et al., 2017; Camacho et al., 2011; Goovaerts, 2017;
    Keshavarzi et al., 2012; Odukoya and Ifarajinm, 2021; Rattan et al., 2005) as
    they enter the food chain through the consumption of drinking water or agricultural
    products (Luque-Espinar and Chica-Olmo, 2020; Luque-Espinar et al., 2015; Pekey
    et al., 2004; Rattan et al., 2005). These pollution processes, which are often
    slow and involve many different TEs, can have serious impacts on the groundwaters.
    It is therefore important to investigate the origin, spatial distribution, and
    relationships between the different TEs in these water bodies, in that multiple
    exposures to these elements, even in low concentrations, can cause serious health
    problems (Islam et al., 2014; Xiao et al., 2014; WHO, 2019). The pollution of
    groundwater, in particular by trace elements, is a cause of great concern in many
    countries. Despite this, most research on this question has focused either on
    very few trace elements or on certain very specific aspects (Xiao et al., 2019;
    Lu et al., 2022). Some studies focus on just one TE, often As (Huq et al., 2020).
    However, very few articles offer an overall approach to the analysis of the environmental
    problems affecting groundwater. Multivariate statistical approaches are powerful
    tools for environmental studies, among other reasons, because they offer a better
    understanding of the results of water analysis, and can identify the different
    sources of pollution that most influence the system being studied. They also help
    reveal hidden relationships between variables while reducing large chemical datasets
    to a small number of factors with minimal information loss (Banerjee et al., 2016;
    Chen et al., 2007; Busico et al., 2018; Dang et al., 2021; Hou et al., 2017; Khound
    and Bhattacharyya, 2016; Pant et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2015).
    Geostatistics is another powerful tool for the spatial analysis of data and solving
    problems relating to estimation and simulation of hydrogeological spatial variables,
    in general, and groundwater quality, in particular (Chilès and Delfiner, 1999;
    Goovaerts, 1997). It has been successfully applied to solve a range of different
    hydrogeological problems (Baalousha, 2010; Brindha et al., 2020; Goovaerts, 2019;
    Hossain and Patra, 2020). This research studies groundwater from a detrital aquifer
    located in an area with high anthropogenic activity for which a sufficient density
    of samples was available. In any investigation of water quality, it is essential
    to try to identify possible sources of pollution. To this end, a specific methodology
    was developed for the analysis of the data that allowed us to link the spatial
    distribution of the TEs with their sources (Chica-Olmo et al., 2014; Rodriguez-Galiano
    et al., 2018; Luque-Espinar and Chica-Olmo, 2020). The following 41 TEs were studied:
    Ag, As, Au, Ba, Be, Bi, Cd, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Ga, Ge, Hf, Hg, In, Ir, Li, Mn, Mo,
    Nb, Ni, Pb, Rb, Re, Sb, Sc, Se, Sn, Sr, Ta, Te, Th, Ti, Tl, U, V, W, Y, Zn, and
    Zr. The nitrates (NO3) and bromates (BrO3−) present in the groundwater samples
    were algo analysed, because they are both potentially harmful compounds of anthropic
    origin. The groundwater samples were taken at two dates in the annual hydrological
    cycle, at the end of the period of maximum recharge (beginning of June, 96 samples)
    and at the end of summer (beginning of November, 104 samples). A large amount
    of information was gathered and then analysed using PCA, SPSS statistical software,
    and the geostatistical Kriging method. SGeMS geostatistical software was used
    to display the distribution of the parameters and PC_scores on an estimation grid.
    The final maps were then prepared with ArcGIS 10.5. The objective of this study
    was to analyse the spatial distribution of the TEs and the PC_scores within the
    aquifer and any changes in these parameters over time, and to identify their possible
    origins or sources of pollution. No rain was recorded during the study period
    (June–November). 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study area and sampling The study
    was conducted in the Vega de Granada aquifer (VGA) is SE Spain, in an area where
    different geological materials outcrop. These include Paleozoic metamorphic materials
    in Sierra Nevada and Mesozoic carbonated materials in Sierra Elvira, together
    with the deposits of quaternary detrital materials that form the aquifer (IGME,
    2020) (Fig. 1). From a geochemical point of view, the metamorphic materials have
    higher values for most of the TEs than those observed in the sedimentary materials
    in the Basin of Granada, where the aquifer is located (Luque-Espinar et al., 2018).
    Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    1. Location of the VGA: sampling points and land uses. The aquifer has a multilayer
    sedimentary structure with alternating grain sizes. These include conglomerates,
    sands, clays, and silts (Luque-Espinar et al., 2008). The natural recharge of
    the aquifer occurs mainly due to the surface runoff from the surrounding Sierra
    Nevada mountains in the form of rainfall and melted ice and snow. Large amounts
    come from direct recharge from the rain that falls on top of the aquifer (surface
    area 200 km2), estimated at about 10 hm3/year. Other less important inputs include
    the lateral underground inflows into the aquifer from outcrops of evaporitic rocks
    located to the south (near the airport) and from the carbonate aquifer of Sierra
    Elvira to the north, which has hot springs waters. These inputs show high concentrations
    in some TEs. The groundwater flows mainly east-west with a piezometric level that
    varies between 100 m and 2 m in depth, depending on the direction of the flow.
    The groundwater shows mainly magnesium sulphate and calcium bicarbonate facies
    (García Soldado, 2009). Important parameters such as Ca, Mg, Na, SO42−, Cl, F,
    and electrical conductivity have a similar spatial distribution to the main components
    found in the samples from June (PC1_J) and November (PC1_N) (Fig. 3b and d). The
    main source of groundwater pollution is intensive agricultural activity over a
    large part of the surface above the aquifer, in which nitrogen-based fertilizers
    are frequently used. The impact of farming on water quality has increased over
    the last two decades, as demonstrated by various studies (Chica-Olmo et al., 2014;
    Rodriguez-Galiano et al., 2018). New emerging pollutants, such as ibuprofen, paracetamol,
    and caffeine, have also been observed (Luque-Espinar et al., 2015; Luque-Espinar
    and Chica-Olmo, 2020). Other factors contributing to groundwater pollution include
    leaks from urban drainage systems (in the city of Granada and 26 nearby municipalities),
    and the use of wastewaters mixed with surface waters for irrigation (Luque-Espinar
    and Chica-Olmo, 2020; Rodriguez-Galiano et al., 2018). Specific sources of pollution
    include industrial estates and livestock farms (especially cattle) scattered around
    the region. A significant part of local industry is devoted to the manufacture
    of agricultural products. These include olive oil, whose production is concentrated
    to the northeast and south of the city of Granada. The concentration of nitrates,
    a frequent subject of research, could be considered the parameter that best represents
    the deterioration in the quality of the groundwater in this aquifer. According
    to Chica-Olmo et al. (2014), in 1980 the average nitrates value was 40 mgr/L,
    while by 2003 it had risen to 70 mgr/L. The concentration continued to rise and
    when they conducted their study, readings of over 90 mgr/L were obtained. During
    the current research, in some sectors where measurements had been taken in previous
    studies, the concentration was even higher at an average of over 110 mgr/L. The
    groundwater was sampled in June and November 2018, at the end of the aquifer recharge
    period and the end of summer, respectively. 96 samples were collected in June
    and 104 in November. The samples were collected according to the procedure described
    in Luque-Espinar et al. (2015), and the chemical analyses were conducted at the
    Scientific Instrumentation Centre at the University of Granada. 2.2. Methodology
    The experimental data were analysed using PCA, together with geostatistical spatial
    estimation using the Kriging method, performed with SPSS 19 and SGeMS software.
    The resulting thematic maps were created with ArcGIS 10.5. These methods are frequently
    used in the spatial analysis of data in environmental pollution studies (Boente
    et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2017; Joseph et al., 2019; Liao
    et al., 2018; Magesh et al., 2017; Raj Pant et al., 2020). To facilitate the analysis
    of experimental data, the dimensions of the multivariate space were reduced by
    applying the PCA method. This method minimizes the redundancy that occurs when
    there are high linear correlations between the variables in the database, as happens
    with some of the parameters studied here. The first stage involved converting
    the experimental variables into normalized variables, with a mean of 0 and a variance
    of 1, in order to avoid scaling factors that could affect the magnitude of the
    variable values. The goodness of fit of the experimental data obtained of both
    dates by application of the PCA method was also checked. Similar values were obtained
    for both dates in the KMO test (0.72 and 0.69) and in Bartlett''s test of sphericity
    (4864 and 4753, with a significance p-value of <0.01). This indicates that the
    database was suitable for the application of PCA. The principal components were
    extracted by applying the eigenvalue >1 criterion and a Varimax rotation of the
    factorial axes in order to simplify the interpretation of the factors (components).
    For each sampling date, a set of 11 principal components (PCi = 1,11) were extracted,
    which represent very similar values for the overall variance (information) explained
    by the PCA models, 82% (June) and 81% (November). No parameters were eliminated
    from the analysis and the communality values (proportion of variance of the variable
    explained by the PCA model) were high in most cases (near 1), and were never less
    than 0.5. Finally, the Ordinary Kriging method (OK) was applied to spatially estimate
    both the experimental variables and the PCi_scores, which synthesize the information
    obtained from the variables. The analysis of the estimated maps facilitated our
    interpretation of the spatial distribution of the different anthropic sources
    of pollution. As part of the geostatistical analysis, the experimental variograms
    of the parameters and PC_scores were calculated and interpreted. It was observed
    that the first PCi (PC1) is better spatially structured (variogram) than the last
    (PC11). This may be related to the fact that the first PCi provides a larger information
    load (eigenvalue). In all cases, experimental variograms were fitted to the spherical
    models and validated using a cross-validation method. Indicator Kriging (IK) was
    used to map the probability P[PCi(x) > pc] from the estimate of the indicator
    variable: I_PCi = 1 if PCi(x) > pc and 0 if not, where pc is a reference cutt-off
    value (third quartile Q3). The interpretation of the results was synthesized on
    a map that shows the areas most influenced by water of geogenic origin (saline
    waters affected by geothermal activity, water affected by evaporitic rocks and
    waters from the main recharge water from Sierra Nevada) and water affected by
    anthropic activities (urban, industrial and agricultural). 3. Results 3.1. Experimental
    data SM_Table 1 presents the mean, maximum, and minimum values for the experimental
    data for the two sampling dates, as well as the frequency of non-detected values,
    and in some cases, the reference values established in the guidelines of the World
    Health Organization (WHO, 2019) or in Spanish law. For the set of parameters studied
    (TEs), no clear trends were observed in terms of an increase or decline in the
    mean concentration values over the period from June to November, although in general
    the increases in concentrations were greater than the decreases. Concentrations
    increased in 44% of the parameters by an average of 60%, while in the remaining
    56% of the parameters, they fell by an average of 41%. In the scatter diagram
    of the mean concentration values for the two dates (SM_Fig. 2A logarithmic scale)
    the points are situated around the slope line 1. This indicates that water quality
    remained homogeneous over the study period (with a high coefficient of correlation
    R2 = 0.90). These general trends in the aquifer are largely due to the hydrodynamic
    processes that take place within it and the natural quality of the groundwater
    recharge. However, relatively large differences (%) were observed in the concentration
    of some trace elements (SM_Fig. 2B), probably due to anthropogenic pollution of
    the aquifer. Significant increases in concentration were noted in the following
    elements: Zn, Pb, Cu, Mn, Ga, Tl, W, Tl, as well as in BrO3- and NO3-. In some
    of these parameters, the mean value increased by over 100% (SM_Fig. 2B). This
    increase can be linked to anthropogenic activities, particularly agriculture and
    industry, as well as to the use of wastewater in irrigation and the fact that
    the aquifer is not recharged during the hot dry summer period. The concentration
    of some elements fell, including Te, Se, Bi, Th, Hf, Au, Cr, Va, and In. This
    was probably due to the lack of surface runoff recharge from the surrounding mountains
    (Sierra Nevada). Download : Download high-res image (627KB) Download : Download

    full-size image Fig. 3. a–d. Variograms and estimated maps for PC2_scores for
    June and November. Within the group of 43 parameters studied, the number of elements
    that were \"not detected\" (nd) was slightly higher in June than in November.
    This may be due to the dilution of these elements during the period of aquifer
    recharge, which typically ends around June. The TEs studied here are potentially
    prejudicial for the environment and for public health and in many cases exceeded
    the values indicated in WHO guidelines (2019). For instance, Mn showed values
    of over 100 μg/L in June and November, far exceeding the maximum limit permitted
    by WHO guidelines (50 μg/L). These high readings were mainly found in sectors
    affected by evaporitic materials and hot springs. In areas affected by urban land
    uses and irrigation with wastewaters, values of between 50 and 100 μg/L were observed.
    The maximum values for November were slightly higher than those observed in June.
    A significant number of samples (27% in June and 74% in November) had NO3- concentrations
    of over 50 mg/L (WHO, 2019). The maximum values were often observed in the western
    part where agriculture is more intensive and the piezometric level is closer to
    the surface. Maximum values for November were often twice as high as those for
    June. Although the WHO guideline for Hg (6 μg/L) was not exceeded, various samples
    exceeded the limit established in Spanish law (1 μg/L). There were three times
    as many such samples in June as in November. In addition, Hg concentrations were
    higher in the samples taken in June than in those taken in November, especially
    in areas affected by urban land use and irrigation with wastewater. The (WHO,
    2019) guideline for Se (40 μg/L) was not exceeded anywhere. However, 11 samples
    taken in November exceeded the limit established in Spanish law (10 μg/L), and
    several others had concentrations that were very close to the limit. All these
    samples were taken in urban areas, although a few were also influenced by evaporitic
    materials. None of the samples taken in June exceeded these limits, although the
    highest value was clearly related with evaporitic materials. The (WHO, 2019) guideline
    for Ni (70 μg/L) was not exceeded anywhere. However, eight of the June samples
    and one from November exceeded the limit established in Spanish law (20 μg/L).
    The concentrations were twice as high in June as in November. While the Ni levels
    in June were more affected by anthropic factors than by natural ones, the highest
    values in November were due to the effects of evaporites. The guideline for As
    (10 μg/L) was not exceeded, although concentrations of over 5 μg/L were recorded
    at several points. Concentrations were higher in June than in November. The highest
    values observed in June were related with irrigation with wastewater and to a
    lesser extent, with hot spring waters. However, in November, the highest As concentrations
    were detected in the area influenced by hot spring waters. The guideline for BrO3-
    (10 mg/L) was not exceeded anywhere, although there was a clear difference between
    the concentrations in June and November. The values for June were well below 1
    mg/L, while in November higher concentrations, close to the guide figure, were
    observed. At both sampling times, the highest values were closely associated with
    urban uses and agricultural areas irrigated with wastewater. The guideline for
    Cr was not exceeded either (50 μg/L), although there are some points with values
    that were very close to the limit. As in other cases, the concentrations for June
    were higher than those for November. In general, there were few points with high
    concentrations and these were due to human activity. The guideline level for U
    (30 μg/L) was reached at the same sampling point in both June and November. On
    both occasions, the highest concentration values for this element were due to
    the presence of evaporitic materials and do not seem to have been influenced by
    human activities. 3.2. Spatial principal components analysis The matrices for
    factorial loads, or components, rotated from June and November are included in
    SM_Table 2A-B. In order to facilitate interpretation of the results, the values
    for the interval [−0.3 - 0.3] interval have been removed because they represent
    low weights of PCi in the communality of the variable explained by the PCA model.
    The values for the components are mostly positive, with the odd exception in the
    samples from June, where Ga and Ba have slightly negative values of −0.52 in PC1_J,
    and Te has a value of −0.71 in PC2_J. The first two components have similar information
    loads (eigenvalues of the correlation matrix) in the two sample groups. In June,
    PC1_J and PC2_J explained 26% and 16% of total variance, with an accumulated value
    of 41%, and in November PC1_N and PC2_N explained 25% and 11% of the variance,
    with an accumulated value of 36%. The rest of the components have eigenvalues
    of less than 10% at both dates. As can be seen in the scatter diagram showing
    the values of the factorial loads for the first component PC1_J and PC1_N (SM_Fig.
    2), there is a very clear linear tendency, with a relatively high value of the
    coefficient of correlation for linear regression, R2 = 0.70. This clear linear
    relationship was also observed in the comparison of the average values for the
    TEs (Fig. 2A). Re, U, Mo, Li, Ni, Co, Sr, Ge, Ga and Ba had slightly higher values
    in June, while Re, U, Mo, Hf, Li, Ge, Ni, Th, Ti and Sr were above average in
    November. PC1 is related above all with the average natural quality of the aquifer
    recharge water. PC2 has a smaller information load than PC1, with 16% and 11%
    in June and November, respectively. A few elements with a high factorial load
    (correlation) in PC2, such as Ir, Nb and Ta, appeared in both June and November,
    although on the whole there was no obvious correspondence between the two dates.
    Ag, In, Nb, Sn, Te, Ge, Ta, Ir and Tl stood out in June and Ir, Nb, W, Bi, Hg,
    Ta and Zr in November. PC2 is considered to be related above all with anthropic
    activity (industrial and urban), and with the changes observed in the study period
    due to the important drop in natural groundwater recharge over the summer months.
    The rest of the components have eigenvalues of less than 10% in June and November
    with a number of elements with significant factorial load, which in general gets
    progressively lower. These components may be related with different types of land
    use, which can give rise to isolated local pollution processes, so altering the
    natural quality of the water in the aquifer. They may also be due to the presence
    of evaporitic geological materials and hot springs waters (Sierra Elvira area,
    Fig. 1). Components PC7_J and PC5_N, with high values of NO3− and BrO3− in the
    component matrix, could also be highlighted as indicators of agriculture-based
    pollution processes and irrigation with wastewaters. These phenomena are particularly
    evident in the western part of the aquifer. PC8_J and PC10_N are also of interest
    for the environment in that they are also related with pollution, in this case
    by heavy metals such as Cu, Cd and Pb. The PCA model enabled us to calculate the
    factorial scores (PCi_scores) at the sampling points for their geostatistical
    analysis and spatial interpretation using estimated maps. These synthetic variables
    are obtained as a linear combination of the experimental variables weighted by
    the factorial coefficients matrix. From the geostatistical point of view, the
    PCi_score variograms for the first components are better structured than those
    for the las components, in both Juen and November, and have greater scopes and
    lower nugget effects. This is because the PCi have different information loads
    (eigenvalues), and these are far greater in the first components than in the others.
    The experimental variograms for these variables were adjusted to spherical models
    to enable us to draw up estimation maps by kriging. These maps are interesting
    because they provide a multivariate viewpoint of the interpretation of the spatial
    distribution of the TEs studied in the aquifer and their relationship with the
    different sources of pollution. The PC1_scores show clear spatial regionalization
    within the aquifer. The variograms are spatially well-structured, in both June
    and November, with substantial ranges in the order of 7–8 km and relatively low
    nugget effects (Fig. 2a and c). The estimated maps produced by kriging clearly
    highlight the main areas of recharge of the aquifer with low PC1 values in the
    eastern and central parts coinciding with the route of the main river (Genil)
    and its subsidiaries. The high PC1 values are preferentially situated in the southwest,
    coinciding with the areas with a high presence of evaporitic materials; and in
    the northern edge coinciding with the presence of underground hot water (Sierra
    Elvira). The estimated maps for PC1_scores have similar spatial distribution characteristics
    to the maps for the TEs with the greatest load in PC1, at both sampling dates
    (SM_Table 1). For example, SM_Fig. 3a–d shows the estimated maps for Re, an element
    with a high factorial load in June (0.89) and November (0.93). Both the adjusted
    variograms and the estimated maps are very similar for the two sampling dates
    (SM_Fig. 1a–d). These maps also closely resemble the estimated maps for the PC1_scores.
    The variograms for the PC2_scores (Fig. 3a–d) show a spatial structuring that
    is slightly worse than PC1. This is only to be expected given that PC2 represents
    a smaller % of total variance and is related with aspects of the distribution
    of the most local TEs. The variograms have ranges of around 3–4 km, in both June
    and November. The nugget effect is slightly greater, a fact that reflects an increase
    in the random component compared to that observed in PC1. The PC2_score for June
    highlights the areas most affected by anthropic activity, mainly industrial and
    urban areas (Fig. 3b). The high values are located in sectors with a high concentration
    of urban (e.g. the city of Granada wastewaters) and industrial activities and,
    in a more specific way, the area near the airport. In November, the high values
    are situated around the main area of recharge of the aquifer and in areas influenced
    by hot spring and evaporitic waters (Fig. 3d). The kriging maps for the other
    PCi_scores highlight more or less confined areas with a significant weight of
    the TEs related with these components. These areas are related with sources of
    pollution linked to wastewater discharge from industrial, urban and agricultural
    land uses. PC7_J and PC5_N can be highlighted due to their direct relationship
    with agricultural activity, with high values in the components matrix for NO3−
    and BrO3−, indicators of agricultural pollution processes and irrigation with
    wastewaters, which are especially important in the western sector. The variograms
    have ranges of between 3 and 4 km and nugget effects of around 50% of overall
    variability (Fig. 4a–d). Download : Download high-res image (651KB) Download :

    interest. These components are related with industrial pollution processes involving
    the heavy metals Cu, Cd and Pb. In a similar way to the previous case, it was
    observed that the variograms have a range of a few kilometres and the nugget effects
    exceed 50% of overall variance (Fig. 5a–d). Download : Download high-res image

    wastewaters and industrial, urban and agricultural land uses. The IK method was
    applied to obtain spatial probability maps of PCi_scores. An example of IK results
    corresponding to PC1 is shown in Fig. 6. As can be seen, the indicator variables
    for the two dates have well-aligned with similar variogram models. The estimated
    probability maps clearly show the division of the study area into three areas
    influenced by geogenic factors (using Q3 as the cut-off value): 1) the main area
    of natural groundwater recharge from surface runoff and precipitation; 2) the
    area influenced by evaporitic materials; 3) the area influenced by hot spring
    water. Download : Download high-res image (698KB) Download : Download full-size

    temporal differences between November and June The next stage was to study the
    differences between November and June in the concentration of significant elements
    and in the synthetic variables (PCi_scores). The experimental variograms showed
    that the differences are spatially regionalised within the aquifer. The variograms
    were fitted with spherical models for the creation of the kriging maps. The analysis
    of the maps revealed the areas in which the greatest changes (increase or decrease)
    in these variables take place over the period June–November. It also enables us
    to relate them to the different sources of pollution and land use. As an example,
    Fig. 7a and b shows the variogram and the estimated map for the difference in
    the concentration of Re, an element that is representative of water quality. In
    absolute terms, the differences in concentration are quite small in the aquifer
    as a whole. Large parts of the aquifer have negative values, except in urban areas
    (the city of Granada and its surrounding area) and more specific local areas where
    wastewaters are used for irrigation, in which small increases in concentration
    can be observed. As a whole, there is little change in the natural quality of
    the aquifer between the two dates, as manifested by the behaviour of this TEs.

    of Re (a, b). Difference [PC1_N-PC1_J] (c, d). Difference [PC10_N-PC8_J] (e, f).
    As regards the differences in the PCi_scores, the most notable is the difference
    [PC1_N-PC1_J], related with the change over time in the average natural quality
    of the aquifer. This variable has a well-structured variogram, adjusted with a
    spherical model with a range of 4 km and a nugget effect of slightly less than
    50% of the overall variance (Fig. 7c). The estimated map (Fig. 7d) sets out the
    areas in which the greatest changes have taken place. These are, above all, areas
    of intensive agricultural and urban activity, and to a lesser extent industrial
    use. These areas tend to coincide with those in which there are relatively small
    variations in natural quality. The change over time in dangerous heavy metals,
    Pb, Cu, and Cd, was assessed from the perspective of the kriging maps of the difference
    between the two sampling dates [PC10_N-PC8_J]. The greatest increases over the
    period June to November took place in areas with industrial land use and also
    in urban areas and sectors in which there are wastewater discharges (Fig. 7e and
    f). 3.4. Spatial distribution map of the influence of geogenic and anthropogenic
    factors on groundwater quality A detailed interpretative analysis was conducted
    of the set of results obtained for the two dates. This enabled us to draw up a
    synthesis map highlighting the influence of geogenic and anthropogenic pollution
    on groundwater in the aquifer (Fig. 8). Seven thematic classes were established:
    agriculture, urban, industrial, mixed, evaporites, hot springs and recharge. The
    “mixed” category was included to cover those cases in which it was impossible
    to distiguish any more specific influence. However, the most significant factor
    is likely to be irrigation with wastewater. Download : Download high-res image

    influence on groundwater quality. The map shows that the eastern half of aquifer
    was more influenced by industrial and urban uses, while agriculture was dominant
    factor in the west. It also indentifies areas influenced by industrial and urban
    activities and areas affected by irrigation with wastewater. The urban activities
    of the city of Granada extend their influence westwards through the most permeable
    part of the aquifer situated below the Genil River. Lastly, the sector affected
    by natural recharge is relatively small due to the widespread impact of anthropic
    activities. 4. General discussion Pollution of both anthropogenic and geogenic
    origin is a common problem in many detritic aquifers in different countries and
    has therefore been the subject of extensive research. However, most of the studies
    consulted offer a quite specific, limited view of the problem of trace element
    pollution and rarely analyse the two sources of pollution together (Huq et al.,
    2020; Hussain et al., 2008; Kourgialas et al., 2017; Mendieta-Mendoza et al.,
    2023). The studies that try to differentiate between the different sources of
    trace elements tend to focus on just a few elements. For example, Blake et al.
    (2017) presented a procedure to determine whether uranium discovered in groundwater
    was of anthropogenic or geogenic origin for which they applied multiparametric,
    hydrogeochemical and isotopic techniques. The most complete analysis of this type
    was made by Busico et al. (2018). Using multivariant statistical analyses they
    differentiated between the anthropogenic and geogenic origin of a group of the
    most abundant ions and 12 trace elements for a particular date. The hydrogeological
    context for this study was relatively simple and just one category of anthropogenic
    influence was identified, while the remaining categories were geogenic. However,
    these authors did not analyse this question over time nor did they use geostatistical
    tools to estimate the factors. Bearing in mind the state of the art of research
    in this field, this article makes a substantial contribution in terms of the methodology
    for analysing detritic aquifers that are subject to complex influences of natural
    and anthropogenic origin. It also analyses their behaviour over time and the influence
    of the recharge. As a result, it was possible to differentiate between the different
    sources of geogenic and anthropogenic pollution. However, in order to understand
    the influence of these sources more precisely and thereby improve the management
    of water resources and the control of anthropogenic pollution, the following tasks
    must be performed: a) Analysis of nitrogen isotopes. This parameter enables us
    to differentiate between urban and agricultural sources of pollution. b) Complete
    analysis of the chemical composition of wastewaters. c) Composition of the fertilizers
    used by local farmers. These products are probably the most important source of
    pollution in many detritic aquifers. In addition to nitrates, they can also be
    a source of chlorine, sodium, calcium, magnesium, ammonium, phosphates and various
    different trace elements. d) Find out more detailed information about the irrigation
    of agricultural land in the area, i.e. when and where irrigation takes place,
    the origin of the water and the amount involved. A full hydrochemical analysis
    would also have to be conducted. 5. Conclusions This case study shows the current
    situation of the quality of the groundwater in the VGA, from the perspective of
    the concentration of a wide set of TEs. The quality of the groundwater in the
    VGA is affected by three main factors: - The quality of the recharge water. -
    The effects of evaporitic rocks and hot spring water. - Anthropic activity (agricultural
    and industrial activity and urban land use). The method applied here, based on
    geostatistical and multivariant statistical methods (PCA), has proved effective
    for the analysis of the spatiotemporal data gathered during this research. The
    kriging maps facilitated the interpretation of the spatial distribution of the
    variables and their relationship with different sources of pollution as well as
    the changes in these variables over time. Six types of influence (agricultural,
    industrial, urban, saline, hot springs, and recharge) on the chemical quality
    of groundwater have been observed. In some sectors these influences overlapped
    and additional categories such as agricultural-wastewater, industrial-urban and
    mixed influences were identified. Although, in general terms, the average quality
    of the water in the aquifer is quite similar in June (end of the recharge period)
    and November (end of the summer). The anthropic activity that most influences
    the natural quality of the groundwater is agriculture (fertilizers and irrigation
    with wastewater). The Río Genil, the main river in this area, has a clear influence
    on the chemistry of the groundwater, and serves as a boundary between saline and
    hot spring waters. It also spreads urban pollution. Perhaps the greatest weakness
    of this research is that no clear differentiation was achieved between the nitrates
    from wastewaters and those from nitrate-based fertilizers. This problem could
    be overcome with an analysis of the nitrogen isotopes. CRediT authorship contribution

    I. Introduction Crops and plants are prone to attack by various diseases and pests.
    These attacks are detrimental to the quality of crops produced and, subsequently,
    to the livelihood of the farmers. According to the literature, diseases, pests,
    and weeds contribute to 36% loss of crops [1]. The foremost cause of frequent
    plant diseases is a lack of supervision and monitoring. To overcome this challenge,
    advanced sensors based technology could be employed to install a supervision system
    in place. Internet of Things (IoT)-based sensor technology is one of the leading
    solutions to monitor and keep track of the plant growth environment. Sensor signals
    along with machine learning algorithms have been shown to create robust disease
    detection and prediction systems [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. To abate crop loss due
    to diseases, researchers have proposed various disease warning systems. A few
    essential parameters for these models are leaf wetness duration (LWD), ambient
    temperature, and relative humidity [7], [8], [9]. The presence of water molecules
    on the surface of the leaves, paired with suitable ambient temperature and relative
    humidity, enables the germination of fungal diseases on the leaf canopy [10].
    Therefore, consistent measurement of LWD plays a crucial role in developing a
    sound disease prediction model. Researchers have explored various types of leaf
    wetness sensors (LWSs) out of which electronic LWS is deemed suitable for in situ
    measurements [10]. A lack of standard measurement practices has affected the in
    situ estimation of LWD values. In this work, an in-house affordable, temperature-compensated
    LWS has been used, which has been reported in our earlier works [11]. It highlights
    the key features of the novel LWS. The IoT-based sensor system enables remote
    sensing of the field parameters; thus, the system would work autonomously. The
    source of leaf wetness could be a valuable insight for predicting diseases. It
    would help farmers identify the cause of leaf wetness and enable them to take
    instant preventive measures. In a remote setting, the output from LWS can be used
    to determine the cause of moisture on the surface of the leaves. As suggested
    in [44], dew, rainfall, or irrigation are the plausible sources of wetness on
    the leaf canopy. In this work, these three causes of leaf wetness have been accounted
    for dew, rainfall, and irrigation. The LWS used in this work generates a frequency
    output corresponding to the presence of water on the leaf surface [44]. If water
    is present on the surface, the frequency declines from the baseline level and
    ascends again once the surface is dry [11]. As mentioned, each event produces
    a different frequency output when subjected to dew, rainfall, and irrigation.
    Therefore, the pattern generated through the frequency output of the LWS provides
    critical insight for detecting the source of wetness on the surface of leaves.
    Pattern recognition is a famous classification and detection technique. It is
    a process wherein the machine tries to classify the data according to the information
    gained from the regu- varieties observed in different types of data. There are
    several applications of pattern recognition like speech recognition, object identification,
    and classification of medical and explosive signals [13], [14], [15], [16], [17],
    [18]. In this work, pattern recognition has been explored for LWS data wherein
    the data points correspond to either dew, rainfall, or irrigation. Syntactic,
    template matching, and statistical models are used for pattern recognition [19].
    The rising popularity of neural networks (NNs) for feature extraction has driven
    researchers to explore NNs for pattern recognition [20]. NN is capable of feature
    extraction from numerical, image, and text-based datasets. Multilayer perceptrons
    (MLPs) are fully connected NN used for pattern recognition [21], [22], [23]. A
    class of NN called convolutional NN (CNN) is widely used for image classification
    [24], [25], [26], [27]. Networks like VGGNet [28], AlexNet [29], and GoogLeNet
    [30] are famous CNN structures used for pattern recognition from image datasets.
    In this work, an ensemble model is proposed, which takes the numerical and image
    data for classifying the source of wetness (dew, rainfall, or irrigation) on the
    plant. Based on the sensor data, this article aims to classify the leaf wetness
    events in one of the three categories: dew, rainfall, or irrigation. LWS data
    plays a crucial role in determining the source of leaf wetness. While the sensor
    produces time-series data, significant information can be extracted from the patterns
    observed in the frequency domain. Therefore, the time-series data has been converted
    to image form using short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and spectrogram representation.
    In addition to LWS, the disease prediction system uses other sensors like ambient
    temperature and relative humidity sensors [11]. These sensors monitor the environmental
    conditions. Rainfall and dew are natural phenomena and are characterized by distinct
    environmental conditions. SECTION II. Materials and Methods A. Sensors System
    and Field Deployment In this work, the LWS and IoT-enabled system have been used,
    which is reported in [11]. Fabricated LWS produces frequency output when subjected
    to the water molecule on its sensing surface. Further, for the temperature and
    humidity measurements, commercial sensors MCP 9710 and HIH 5030 are used, respectively.
    Subsequently, these sensors are interfaced with the in-house developed signal
    conditioning and processing circuits. The data collected from these sensors are
    uploaded to the ThingspeakTM server every 30 min. For the field measurement, fabricated
    LWS was deployed on the Mango tree at 45° angles, as shown in Fig. 1. Further,
    the field measurements are carried out for four months where approximately 5000
    data points are collected. Fig. 1. Deployment of the sensor on the leaves. Show
    All SECTION III. Data Preprocessing The primary focus is to prepare the data for
    classifying the source of wetness on the leaf, which can arise mainly due to dew,
    rainfall, and irrigation. This involves feature extraction to identify leaf wetness
    events caused by dew, rainfall, and irrigation. Further, data labeling is done
    for both numerical and image data. Numerical attributes are standardized and fed
    into the MLP model and subsequently image data is transformed into spectrograms,
    which are fed into the CNN model. Data augmentation techniques are applied to
    enhance dataset size and diversity. These processes collectively aim to facilitate
    the accurate classification of leaf wetness events in a dataset comprising 392
    instances of dew, rainfall, and irrigation events, which helps reduce overfitting
    and improve model accuracy. A. Feature Extraction The main objective of this work
    is to determine the cause of leaf wetness by analyzing the patterns generated
    by an LWS. Three distinct events, namely dew, irrigation, and rainfall, can make
    leaves wet. To apply a classification algorithm effectively, it’s crucial to isolate
    and extract these individual wetness events and create training and testing datasets.
    This is achieved by identifying specific points at the start and end of each event
    using the find_peaks function from the sciPy library. This function detects the
    highest values in a 1-D signal within a specified height range. Fig. 2 represents
    the signal with starting and ending points marked using orange and green colors.
    The resulting signal is then divided into separate events, leading to the creation
    of a dataset comprising 98 leaf wetness events, each marked by distinct starting
    and ending points. Fig. 2. Leaf wetness events marked with points. Show All B.
    Data Labeling 1) Tabular Data: In this work, a hybrid model is trained using both
    numerical and image data. Numerical data comprise data from sensors like ambient
    temperature sensors, relative humidity sensors, and LWS. Each wetness event is
    numerically characterized by four features, namely, LWD value, average ambient
    temperature, average relative humidity, and maximum magnitude of frequency. Average
    temperature and humidity values are calculated for the duration of each event,
    and the maximum magnitude of frequency is obtained from the output of LWS. LWD
    values are extracted from the frequency response of LWS after smoothening the
    signal. The procedure followed for calculating LWD values has been reported in
    our previous work [11]. The numerical features corresponding to a single-leaf
    wetness event vary broadly in magnitude. To avoid bias due to differences in the
    range of magnitude during the training process, the features are normalized using
    Minmaxscaler function available in scikit-learn library [33]. After normalization,
    all features would lie within a range of 0–1, eliminating any bias due to their
    magnitude. 2) Image Data: The dataset comprise individual frequency output responses
    corresponding to a particular event. To make it suitable for training a machine
    learning model, it has to be classified appropriately with the cause of the wetness.
    Three possible events are responsible for wetness on the leaves’ surface: dew,
    rainfall, and irrigation. For ease of classification, the signal is inverted about
    the y-axis, such that a rise in the magnitude of frequency above baseline frequency
    marks the events. This is denoted by ( ΔF ) as shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3. Isolated
    events from the frequency response of leaf wetness sensor corresponding to (a)
    dew, (b) rainfall, and (c) irrigation. Show All In this work, the time-series
    numerical data from LWS is transformed into image format to leverage the 2-D CNN
    model. CNN is one of the most popular NNs for image classification due to its
    high accuracy [34]. The signal is converted into the frequency domain from the
    time domain using an STFT to convert the numerical data for LWS into image form.
    STFT captures the signal’s frequency components over a small window length of
    256, which is the function’s default size, and tracks them across the duration
    of the signal. STFT of the frequency output of LWS has been computed using the
    scipy library [32]. In doing so, an attempt is made to capture the salient features
    of the patterns observed in the sensor output. These patterns are observed when
    the sensor detects the presence of water on the surface. Fig. 4 represents the
    spectrograms of STFT of the LWS sensor signals. It is evident from the spectrograms,
    as depicted in Fig. 4 that the intensity of frequency components differs for the
    different categories of events viz., dew, rainfall, and irrigation. Therefore,
    these spectrograms could be used for training a CNN-based classification model.
    The images are resized and converted to binary to assist the edge-detection capacity
    of CNN. Fig. 4. STFT spectrograms of leaf wetness sensor data for (a) dew, (b)
    rainfall, and (c) irrigation. Show All The frequency magnitude is the first indicator
    of the possible event that could have caused leaf wetness [44]. Leaf wetness due
    to dew is characterized by a frequency output response with a maximum magnitude
    less than or equal to 4 kHz. Therefore, all events for which the rise in frequency
    ( ΔF ) is less than or equal to 4 kHz are labeled “Dew.” Out of 98 leaf wetness
    events and 13 events for Dew have been obtained. Apart from considering the magnitude
    of the frequency output of LWS, to differentiate between the events due to irrigation
    and rain, a second parameter, LWD has been used. The events with a maximum magnitude
    of frequency greater than 10 kHz or LWD more than 19 h have been labeled as “Rain.”
    Subsequently, the rest of the events were labeled as “Irrigation.” From the given
    signal, 48 events due to rain and 37 events due to irrigation has been observed.
    Fig. 3 shows five signals, each corresponding to the three natural phenomena discussed
    above. The magnitude on the y -axis is under the criteria used to classify the
    events in the appropriate categories. C. Data Augmentation Data augmentation is
    a crucial strategy to prevent overfitting in NNs due to limited data. This study
    is critical because leaf wetness events are uncontrollable. Techniques like horizontal
    flipping and adding random Gaussian noise are applied to image data while preserving
    original patterns. Numerical data are also augmented with Gaussian noise. After
    using these techniques, the dataset grows from 98 to 392 leaf wetness events,
    enhancing the dataset’s size and robustness for machine learning purposes. SECTION
    IV. Proposed Model for Classification In this work, artificial neural network
    (ANN) is an attractive choice because it ensembles NNs that can be built to deal
    with different types of data at the same time. In this work, NN is devolved that
    is capable of learning both numerical data and image data simultaneously. The
    sub-model trained to learn numerical data is an MLP and that trained using the
    image data is a CNN. The model proposed in this work, has been implemented using
    the tensorflow library [36]. A. Multilayer Perceptron MLP is a class of feed-forward
    NNs with fully connected layers. It comprises input and output layers connected
    between multiple hidden layers. In this work, the MLP is supplied by four input
    features—LWD values, average ambient temperature, average relative humidity, and
    maximum magnitude of frequency observed for the event. As mentioned, the three
    types of layers in MLP have neurons responsible for propagating the information
    to the following layer. Fig. 5 shows a descriptive diagram of an MLP (sub-model
    1). The input features are supplied to the input layer. In this work, four features
    are used namely, LWD value, average ambient temperature, average relative humidity,
    and maximum magnitude of frequency. Let the input vector be represented by X i
    for i∈[1,4] . The input is passed on to the hidden layer. The output of the ith
    neuron in the lth hidden layer of MLP, y m [l]i , is the weighted summation of
    its input provided from the preceding hidden layer. The process is called forward
    propagation, accomplished by the following equation [23]: y m [l])i =F( ∑ i=1
    n−1 w m [l]i . a m [l−1]i + b m [l]i ) (1) View Source where w m (l)i and b m
    (l)i are the weight and bias of the neuron, respectively, and a m (l−1)i is the
    activated neuron from the previous layer. The function F(x) is the activation
    function assigned to each layer. For the hidden layers, it is a linear function
    called rectified linear unit (ReLu). This function maximizes the speed of training
    due to less computation and avoids the vanishing gradient problem [37]. In case
    of the input layer a m [l−1]i is replaced with X i . The output vector of MLP
    (sub-model 1) is denoted by Y m . Fig. 5. Proposed model for leaf wetness events
    classification. Show All B. Convolutional Neural Network A CNN was implemented
    for training the image data due to its superior image classification performance.
    CNN models learn by identifying the edges of the images during the training process.
    The convolutional layer is composed of 2-D filters, i.e., kernels, traverse over
    the entire image depending on the size of the kernel. The kernel is a 2-D weight
    matrix. The layer performs convolution of the filter and overlapping input and
    extracts the features of the given image. CNN follows the same process of forward
    propagation, as described in MLP, to transfer the information through the network
    layers. However, in this case, the input images of spectrograms are convolved
    with the filters. It is a multiplication operation on the 2-D input matrices,
    i.e., image and kernel. The following equation defines the convolutional process
    [45]: y c [l]u,v =F( ∑ i=0 p−1 ∑ j=0 q−1 w c [l]i,j . a c (l−1)(u+i),(v+j) + b
    c [l]u,v ). (2) View Source y c (l)u,v is the output of the lth convolutional
    layer at the (u,v) position. The variables w c [l]i,j and a c [l−1](u+i),(v+j)
    are the kernel and input image, respectively. Here, the dimension of the kernel
    is (p×q) . The activation function, F(x) , for intermediate layers is ReLu [37].
    Furthermore, a max-pooling layer is used to prevent over-fitting. The data is
    down-sampled by replacing the output of the convolutional layer with the maximum
    value observed in a particular neighborhood. The MaxPooling2D layer from tensorflow
    implements the max-pooling function [36]. A window of size 3×3 with a stride of
    2 is employed. This operation reduces the dimensions of the data and makes the
    computation much more efficient. An additional layer was added to ensure an effective
    learning process called batchnormalization. The principal objective of this method
    is to normalize the input to the following layer. The batch normalization layer
    from the tensorflow library is added to the model to ensure that the inputs are
    normalized and smooth and that the learning does not suffer due to bias toward
    a specific input owing to nonuniform distribution. Y c denotes the output vector
    of CNN (sub-model 2). C. Training the Hybrid Model The main advantage of the dataset
    collected in this work is data availability from various sensors. While the pattern
    observed in the frequency output of LWS directly corresponds to identifying the
    event that caused wetness on the leaves, the other sensors measuring ambient temperature
    and relative humidity offer critical insights into the environmental conditions
    when the leaf wetness event occurred. These environmental factors could assist
    the model in making a decision. As discussed in Section III-A, the sensor data
    is preprocessed and organized in tabular format. The patterns observed in the
    LWS data are converted to images, as discussed in Section III-B. Fig. 5 illustrates
    the model used to predict the leaf wetness event. The tabular and image data are
    processed parallelly using the first two sub-models. Sub-model 1 is a multilayer
    perceptron described in Section IV-A. It has three hidden layers, each activated
    using a ReLu function. Sub-model 2 is a CNN, as Section IV-B describes, with two
    convolutional and max-pooling layers and a final batch-normalization layer. The
    convolutional layers are activated using the ReLu activation function. The output
    of the two sub-models is concatenated and provided as to the standard NN. The
    connected outcomes can be represented as C=[ Y m , Y c ] T . (3) View Source The
    input passes through the model via forward propagation as described in (1) and
    (2), depending on the sub-model. The two sub-models are responsible for feature
    extraction from the original data received from the sensors. The NNs are adept
    at feature extraction because of their densely connected structure [22]. The sub-model
    outputs are concatenated into a single vector and used further for training. The
    final sub-model denoted in Fig. 5 is responsible for the predictions. The outcome
    of the NN ensemble is obtained from the last layer of the final sub-model. It
    has three neurons corresponding to each leaf wetness event—dew, rainfall, and
    irrigation. The output is the probability of occurrence of the event based on
    the input features. This output is achieved by applying “softmax” as the activation
    function to the output layer [38]. The process finds the normalized exponential
    value for each class σ( c o )= e c o ∑ N j=1 e c j . (4) View Source In the above
    equation, c o is the output value of a neuron for a particular class. The exponential
    divided by the exponential of every neuron in the output layer. Thus, (4) calculates
    the probability of occurrence of one of the events. The model is trained by back-propagation.
    The method aims to minimize the cost function of the prediction by reassigning
    weights. The cost function chosen for training this model is “categorical cross-entropy”
    which is suitable for multiclass classification [38]. In the multiclass category,
    the events belong to only one of the possible classes. The following equation
    represents the loss function: Loss=− ∑ o=1 3 t o log( y o ) (5) View Source where
    t o is the class’s true value, and y o is the predicted probability from the output
    layer, which uses the softmax function. The model has been trained for 200 epochs
    with a batch size of 32 because of the small size of the dataset. This combination
    would converge to a loss value faster. The optimizer used is Adam because of its
    superior performance [39]. Fig. 5 shows the complete ensemble model used in this
    work. SECTION V. Result and Discussion A. Exploratory Data Analysis This section
    uses exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize data trends. A pie chart in
    Fig. 6 illustrates the distribution of leaf wetness causes, showing that rainfall
    is the most common (about half of the events), followed by irrigation (37.8%)
    and dew (13.3%). The June to October 2021 study aligns with the monsoon season,
    explaining the prevalence of rain-induced leaf wetness. Fig. 6. Pie chart distribution
    of leaf wetness events. Show All B. Model Performance The experiments are conducted
    for various hidden layers and neurons, and it has been found that the best accuracy
    achieved is around 96.13% for the ensemble model. Both model sub-model 1 (MLP)
    and sub-model 2 (CNN) were combined with another NN (final sub-model). As a result,
    the hidden layers are changed and neurons in sub-model 1, sub-model 2, and the
    final sub-model. It has been found that the best layers and neurons are three
    layers and 30-24-16 neurons for sub-model 1, four layers, and 128-64-24-12 neurons
    for sub-model 2 and four layers and 30-24-16 neurons for the final sub-model.
    Table I displays a comparison of many models. The recommended model outperformed
    several techniques in Table I, with an accuracy of 96.13%. TABLE I Comparison
    of Different Models As mentioned in Section IV-C, the ensemble model is trained
    for 200 epochs with a batch size of 32. Fig. 7(a) and (b) shows the training and
    validation accuracy and loss for the proposed model. In this work, the proposed
    model architecture learns from a combination of numerical data and image data.
    The MLP is responsible for learning the numerical tabular data, while the CNN
    learns the image data, as described in Section IV. Fig. 7(b) demonstrates the
    characteristic decline of the loss curve, which validates the learning process.
    The steady decline of the loss curve for validation data indicates learning and
    the absence of overfitting by the model. From Fig. 7(b), it can be observed that
    the ensemble model converges the fastest to the lowest loss value. Fig. 7. (a)
    Model accuracy, (b) cross-entropy loss, and (c) ROCs for dew, rainfall, and irrigation.
    Show All Fig. 7(c) shows the receiver operating characteristics (ROCs). This curve
    gives information about the classification capability of the trained model. The
    45° reference line shown in Fig. 7(c) denotes a model incapable of differentiating
    between positive and negative outputs. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) graph
    is a point where the true positive rate (TPR) is 1 and the false positive rate
    (FPR) is 0. A good ROC curve is closer to the top left corner and away from the
    45° line. Fig. 7(c) shows three ROC curves, one for each of the classes- dew,
    rainfall, and irrigation. The AUC is an insightful indicator of the model performance.
    AUC measures the model’s capability to differentiate between the classes. In this
    work, the AUC for dew, rainfall, and irrigation is 0.99, 0.95, and 0.97, respectively.
    The output layer of the NN ensemble described in Section IV uses softmax activation
    function which produces a probability of each possible outcome. These probabilities
    are converted to absolute values of 0 or 1, where 0 indicates negative output
    and 1 indicates a positive output. Further, the precision and recall have been
    calculated as tabulated in Table II. Precision is the fraction of predicted positive
    values, which are actually positive the following equation. On the other hand,
    recall is the fraction of actually positive values that have been correctly predicted
    the following equation [43]: Precision Recall = (True Positive) (True Positive+False
    Positive) = (True Positive) (True Positive+False Negative) . (6) (7) View Source
    TABLE II Evaluation Metrics for Classification of Dew, Rainfall, and Irrigation
    Table II gives the precision and recall values for all the events, along with
    the F1 score. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It measures
    the model’s performance, accounting for the trade-off between precision and recall.
    From Table III, it can be observed that the version of the model is suitable for
    all the events. Slightly less memory is observed for dew. However, it is due to
    the limited number of samples. The average value of the F1 score is 0.8396, which
    signifies a good balance between precision and recall. The significance of a high
    F1 score is that the model can correctly identify the positive data samples. Table
    III presents a comparison of various ensemble models across different applications.
    Researchers have employed the CNN-LSTM model for applications in medical, robotics,
    pedestrian navigation, and e-commerce, while the Darknet19-CNN-LSTM model has
    been utilized for computer vision tasks. In this work, the MLP-CNN model has been
    adopted for agricultural applications and achieved an accuracy of 96.13%. TABLE
    III Comparison of Different Ensemble Models for Different Applications SECTION
    VI. Conclusion Agriculture plays a pivotal role in a country’s economy and methods
    to make it more efficient should be devised. In this work, with the motivation
    of reducing the cost of early plant disease prediction systems, the leaf wetness
    sensor is used to detect the LWS and also the source of wetness on the leaf canopy.
    For this purpose, the data is collected from LWS, ambient temperature sensor,
    and relative humidity sensor. The initial preprocessing and data engineering helped
    us create a dataset that could be used to train a machine-learning model capable
    of predicting the natural event responsible for leaf wetness. The sensors produced
    numerical time series data indicative of the three leaf wetness events- dew, rainfall,
    and irrigation. STFT is applied to the LWS data to obtain an image since the patterns
    obtained in the sensor output for different events are different. Further, an
    MLP-CNN model is built, which is capable of learning from tabular data as well
    as image data simultaneously. The MLP with numerical data produced a satisfactory
    accuracy of 92.86% while the CNN model with image data produced an accuracy of
    62.93% and the ensemble NN (MLP-CNN) classifier produced an accuracy of 96.13%.
    It has been observed that the final model classified the leaf wetness events with
    an average precision and recall of 0.84 and 0.85, respectively. Authors Figures

    drain (LD), leather complex outlet (LO), focal point drain (FD), and Bulandpur
    drain (BD)) of Kala Sanghian drain in the dry season. The result showed that the
    drain under consideration is very much contaminated and the water is not suitable
    for irrigation and agricultural purposes. Rather it has a bad impact on the health
    of local people, the physiology of aquatic organisms, and the soil quality of
    agricultural land nearby. The present study confirmed the water quality index
    was more than 100, indicating a highly contaminated drain and water is unfit for
    any use. The correlation analysis shows that there exists a positive correlation
    between TDS and temperature (r = 0.994), DO and pH (r = 0.808), BOD and temperature
    (r = 0.987), BOD and TDS (r = 0.978), EC and temperature (r = 0.963), EC and TDS
    (r = 0.954), and EC and BOD (r = 0.956). The principal component analysis (PCA)
    confirms that PC1 alone has more than 89% of the variance with high positive loading
    for TDS, temperature, EC, and BOD. The hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) reflected
    two clusters where cluster 1 consists of pH, DO, temperature, and BOD of water

    data set confirms the high degree contribution of anthropogenic activities through
    the application of chemicals in agriculture, disposal of municipal waste, and
    industrial effluents in the deterioration of water quality. The results of the

    12 March 2024 Introduction Rapid industrialization and urbanization are serious
    concerns for a healthy and green environment. Natural as well as anthropogenic
    activities are responsible for the contamination of the environment with hazardous
    pollutants and their adverse effects on living organisms need focused research
    to counter these problems (Bharagava & Chowdhary, 2019; Singh & Raj, 2020; Panneerselvam
    et al., 2023a). For economic development, high levels of industries are being
    set up that lead to the release of toxic wastewater into the environment and are
    the central determinant for changes in environmental quality as the economies
    develop which ultimately jeopardizes both human beings and the environment on
    a large scale (Khan et al., 2019; Liang et al., 2020; Urbina-Suarez et al., 2021).
    Water having the properties of poisonous, radioactive, explosive, carcinogenic,
    mutagenic, teratogenic, or bioaccumulative is considered toxic and its sources
    include chemical processes, improper disposal of wastewater from industrial plants
    as well as surface runoff containing pesticides used in agricultural areas (Cheng
    et al., 2021; Mancinelli et al., 2020). The predominant source of groundwater
    contamination in India could be anthropogenic activities including disposal of
    household wastes, discharge of industrial effluents, leakages in sewage lines,
    and indiscriminate application of chemicals in agriculture (Paneerselvam et al.,
    2023) which are major causes of concern for the epidemics of water-borne diseases
    like cholera, hepatitis, and gastroenteritis and also lead to endangering of aquatic
    flora and fauna. In an investigation, Panneerselvam et al. (2022) evaluated the
    appropriateness of groundwater for drinking purposes in southern India and revealed
    the effect of nitrate toxicity on humans due to contaminated drinking water. The
    associated health risk due to contaminated water could be haemoglobin loss, skin
    diseases, dizziness, and fatigue (Panneerselvam et al., 2021). Tanning industries,
    electroplating industries, and textile industries are among the important industries
    contributing to this major pollution event (Jose & Philip, 2021; Kishor et al.,
    2021; Kumar & Tortajada, 2020; Li et al., 2021; Rajoria et al., 2022). These chemicals
    released from industries impose a deleterious impact on the aquatic environment
    and make it essential to remove these malodorous contaminants from wastewater
    (Fernandez et al., 2019; Hashem et al., 2018; Mwinyihija, 2010). The wastewater
    generated from the tannery industries is characterized by a strong odor, dark
    brown color, high pH, heavy metals especially chromium, high total dissolved solids,
    biological oxygen demand, and chemical oxygen demand (Fathi et al., 2018; Sutadian
    et al., 2018). The presence of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus in it,
    and the tannery wastewater endorse the eutrophication of water bodies (Boinpally
    et al., 2023; Jallouli et al., 2020). High turbidity also acts as a hurdle in
    the photosynthetic process by blocking sunlight penetration and it, therefore,
    proves detrimental to aquatic life. In leather tanning effluents, several parameters
    usually cross the limits set by different environmental protection regulations
    and therefore it poses serious environmental impacts on water, terrestrial, and
    environmental systems (Franke et al., 2023; Nunes et al., 2022). Environmental
    regulations strictly force the leather industries to proper treatment and management
    of wastewater according to the guidelines of the local government (Chiampo et
    al., 2023; Saxena et al., 2016). Electroplating processes are one of the major
    sources of discharging of heavy metal-laden effluents into the environment. It
    becomes an alarming issue for environmental concern (Ramrakhiani et al., 2022).
    Heavy metals being non-biodegradable tend to accumulate in the organs of living
    organisms (Khalef et al., 2022; Shahjahan et al., 2022). These are known to be
    toxic and carcinogenic (Aalami et al., 2022; Dasharathy et al., 2022). Textile
    effluents create one-fifth of the world’s industrial pollution and use 20,000
    chemicals, many of which are carcinogens. Due to pertinacious and bioaccumulative,
    dyes are hazardous for aquatic organisms and mammals (Arumugam et al., 2018; Bhatia
    et al., 2018; Mani et al., 2019). Chemicals after evaporation get mixed in the
    air and become a massive source of teratogens. The water quality index (WQI) is
    an important parameter that is useful in deciding the suitability of river waters
    for a variety of uses such as aquaculture and domestic utility (Braga et al.,
    2022; Pan et al., 2022). Water quality indices act as an important and useful
    tool for water quality evaluation (Lap et al., 2023; Naubi et al., 2016). The
    primary focus of the present study is to provide data-based information pertaining
    to influence of anthropogenic activities on water quality parameters of Kala Sanghian
    drain which has a detrimental impact on health of society established nearby.
    The current study aimed to raise awareness about cleaner water supply systems
    and acquire thorough knowledge about the sources of contamination, physicochemical
    analysis, and health effects of contaminated water on locals, aquatic organisms,
    and the manipulation of soil quality of agricultural land. The findings of the
    present research may provide useful information to the policy-maker for developing
    effective management plant to mitigate this problem. Materials and methods Locale
    of study Kala Sanghian drain is a highly polluted drain situated in Jalandhar,
    Punjab, and receives the discharge of industrial effluents, domestic and agricultural
    wastes, and other anthropogenic activities around the drain. It might be harmful
    to human and animal consumption. The objective of the present study is to analyze
    the physicochemical properties of wastewater collected from various sites of the
    Kala Sanghian drain and try to analyze whether the mean physicochemical parameters
    under consideration are equal or not. To achieve this aim, the various physicochemical
    parameters have been evaluated after collecting water samples from various sites
    of drains that receive the effluents of industries lying in its territory. Kala
    Sanghian drain is a 45 km drain that extends from Bulandpur to Bein. It passes
    through the Jalandhar, Kapurthala, and Nakodar districts of Punjab which are located
    at 31.3260° N latitude and 75.5762° E longitude, 31.3656° N latitude and 75.2946°
    E longitude, and 31.13° N latitude and 75.47° E longitude, respectively (Fig.
    1). The climates around these regions are almost similar with high humidity and
    monsoon-influence. Fig. 1 Geographical location of sites near Kala Sanghian drain
    (Punjab, India) Full size image Sample depths The objectives of the experiment
    and the parameters used to be studied influence the sampling depth selection.
    The sample depth in this study was determined to be between 15 and 20 cm. This
    was due to the fact that surface water pollution was the primary focus of this
    investigation. Typically, a sample from a deeper section is required for physicochemical
    analysis (Halder & Islam, 2015). Sample collection Twelve samples were collected
    from the four different sites of the Kala Sanghian drain in the dry season which
    were based on the active sites for anthropogenic activities viz., disposal of
    industrial effluents, household waste disposal, and agricultural activities. The
    sites were designated as leather complex drain (LD), leather complex outlet (LO),
    focal point drain (FD), and Bulandpur drain (BD) which are geographically located
    in Jalandhar City (Fig. 1). The wastewater was collected in triplicates which
    receive effluents from tannery industries, electroplating industries, and textile
    industries, including one outlet of industries. Before collecting the samples,
    the bottles were prewashed with HNO3 and completely rinsed with deionized water.
    The proper labeling has been done also on the bottles. The effluent was collected
    in “A” grade plastic bottles of 2 L capacity covered tightly with a lid and was
    escorted to the laboratory with proper care and was stored at 4 °C for further
    analysis (APHA, 1995, 2005). Sample handling and preservation To guarantee data
    quality, proper sample handling and preservation are crucial. The following factors
    are listed: (a) clean plastic vessels were used for the collection of inorganic
    samples; (b) proper sample preservation was a crucial factor for obtaining representative
    and accurate results from the samples so samples were typically kept on ice and
    in the dark to prevent sample deterioration, and (c) analyses have to start as
    soon as possible after collection (Halder & Islam, 2015). Laboratory testing and
    standards The experiment was carried out on a specific drain segment during the
    summer. The midday period was chosen to gather the samples. The samples were chosen
    using the four sides of the drain. To assess the quality of the water, six parameters
    were used which were further compared with the standard values (Table 1). The
    data analysis revealed that there were notable differences in the water quality
    amongst the drain sites that collected the industrial effluents from various industries.
    Because there is less water flow and a drop in the water level during the dry
    season, the quality of the water decreases (Halder & Islam, 2015). Table 1 Standard
    drinking water quality parameters recommended by the Indian Council of Medical
    Research (ICMR) and Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) Full size table Determination
    of water quality parameters The collected samples were filtered through Whatman
    41 filter papers (125 mm) to separate out larger materials from the effluents
    and the filtrates were used to estimate various physicochemical attributes viz.,
    temperature, pH, TDS (total dissolved solids), DO (dissolved oxygen), BOD (biological
    oxygen demand), and EC (electrical conductivity). The physicochemical parameters
    of all the samples were determined by APHA standard methods. The temperature was
    measured with a digital thermometer and was expressed as °C. The pH of the water
    sample was measured with a digital desktop pH meter formerly calibrated with buffer
    solutions. TDS was determined gravimetrically by using evaporating dishes and
    cross-checked by a TDS meter (Panneerselvam et al., 2023b) and was expressed as
    mg/L. DO was determined by Winkler’s titration method and was expressed as mg/L.
    (BOD) was done using the relationship BOD = DO-DO5, in 5 days (amount of dissolved
    oxygen present before and after the incubation period) and was expressed as mg/L.
    EC was measured with a conductivity meter previously calibrated with potassium
    chloride solution and was expressed as µS/cm. Chemicals used for the experimentation
    were of analytical reagent grade and purchased from Merck, India. Distilled water
    used throughout the analysis was double distilled water. Water quality index (WQI)
    The samples of contaminated water from the various sites of the Kala Sanghian
    drain were collected, preserved, and analyzed as per standard methods (APHA, 1995,
    2005). One well-known method for assessing surface water quality is the water
    quality index (WQI) model. WQI is an indicator of the suitability of water for
    drinking purposes (Balamurugan et al., 2020a). Based on regional water quality
    standards, the WQI model has been used globally to assess the quality of surface
    and groundwater (Uddin et al., 2021). The water quality index was analyzed by
    using the standard method (Panneerselvam et al., 2023a; Tyagi et al., 2013). The
    weighted arithmetic water quality index (WAWQI) is estimated by using common variables
    of quality parameters to determine water quality and the mathematical expression
    is provided by Eq. 1 (Chidiac et al., 2023; Tyagi et al., 2013). $$WQI=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{Q}_{i}{W}_{i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{W}_{i}}$$
    (1) where Qi is the water quality rating and is the concentration-dependent rating
    for ith water quality parameter and is determined by using the following Eq. 2,
    while Wi is the unit weight associated with ith water quality parameter and is
    determined by using Eq. 3. $${Q}_{i}=\\frac{{V}_{i}-{V}_{0}}{{S}_{i}-{V}_{0}}x
    100$$ (2) $${W}_{i}=\\frac{K}{{S}_{i}}$$ (3) where Vi is the concentration (observed
    value) of ith chemical parameter in each water sample. V0 is the ideal value of
    ith parameter in pure water (where it is 0 for all parameters except 7 for pH
    and 14.6 mg/L for dissolved oxygen). Si is the standard value for ith parameter
    (Table 1). K is the proportionality constant and is calculated by using Eq. 4.
    $$K=\\frac{1}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(1/{S}_{i})}$$ (4) Statistical analysis To evaluate
    the interaction between the contaminated area and control, correlation analysis
    was carried out using Pearson’s correlation. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was
    carried out to compare the contamination of control and four sites of the Kala
    Sanghian drain. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) one-way test was also performed to
    find out the statistical value and significance of population means at 0.05 level.
    The condition that shows the existence of a correlation between the parameters
    or variables that its value should lie between − 1 and + 1 (i.e., r =  − 1 < r <  + 1).
    Values between 0.01 and + 1.0 predict a positive correlation and between 0.01
    and − 1.0 indicate a negative correlation. The principal component analysis (PCA)
    and hierarchial cluster analysis (HCA) were carried out to categorize and establish
    relations between the parameters which were investigated for water quality assessment.
    All multivariate statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 27 software.
    Results and discussion Physicochemical assessment of industrial effluents of Kala
    Sanghian drain The result of the physicochemical characteristics of samples from
    different sites of the Kala Sanghian drain is illustrated with the help of tables
    and figures. The higher value of physicochemical parameters in comparison to the
    standard limit (Table 1) marks the unsuitability of water for any use. The mean
    variation of various parameters was presented as mean ± SD at p ≤ 0.05 (Table
    2, Fig. 2). One way ANOVA and significance of population means at 0.05 level suggests
    that temperature, pH, TDS, BOD, DO, and EC across the sites and control differs
    significantly (F4,10 = 364.94 (temperature), 1034.47 (pH), 4528.11 (TDS), 3843.54
    (DO), 27,853.69 (BOD), and 3211.78 (EC)) with p value as less than 0.05 (Table
    3). The test of homogeneity of variance reflects the Levene’s statistic values
    as 0.366 (temperature), 3.62 (pH), 11.47 (TDS), 3.44 (DO), 1.93 (BOD), and 11.63
    (EC) with p value as less than 0.05 except temperature (p = 0.828) and BOD (p = 0.182)
    (Table 3). Since the Levene’s statistic is significant, the equal variance was
    not assumed. One-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey’s HSD test indicated that the concentrations
    of all the measured physicochemical parameters were not equal across the drain.

    of Kala Sanghian drain Full size table Fig. 2 Mean of physicochemical parameters
    across the different sites of the Kala Sanghian drain Full size image Table 3
    Test of homogeneity of variance and ANOVA Full size table Temperature A significant
    difference was seen in the mean value of the temperature of Site 1(LD) and Site
    2(LO), Site 3(FD), and Site 4(BD) as well as with control (Fig. 3A). The temperature
    has a big ascendancy on water chemistry. It plays a prime role in bio-chemical
    processes and an increase in temperature creates a disturbance in these processes
    and turns, cast a deleterious impact on aquatic organisms. It declines total cell
    count, hinders cell viability, and eventually leads to DNA impairment and apoptosis
    of fishes (Lacy & Rahman, 2022). Thermal stress can slow down metabolic activities
    and impose adverse effects on the immune defense system in fish (Chowdhury & Saikia,
    2020; Machado et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021). Temperature observed in the samples
    of study under consideration does not conform to the standard set by the WHO and
    rather they crossed these values. Henceforth we can conclude that it is not suitable
    for aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Fig. 3 Comparisons of different parameters
    in various sites of the Kala Sanghian drain (p < 0.05) (*A temperature, B pH,
    C DO, D TDS, E BOD, F EC) Full size image pH In the case of pH (Fig. 3B), the
    test illustrated that the mean value of pH of control is significantly different
    from the mean value of pH of Site 1 (LD), Site 2 (LO), Site 3 (FD), and Site 4
    (BD). A significant difference has been seen between the mean value of pH of Site
    1 (LD) with Site 2 (LO) and Site 4 (BD). pH is a key parameter in the determination
    of water quality as it influences many chemical processes such as degradation,
    solubility, and metal toxicity (Saalidong et al., 2022; Sibhatu et al., 2022).
    Organic and inorganic compounds present in wastewater alter pH value. The toxic
    waste dump is also responsible for the reduction in the pH of water bodies. The
    addition of these chemicals in the water by any means causes fluctuations in pH.
    This causes disturbances in the physiology of aquatic species and proves lethal
    for some tender and prone members of flora and fauna (Wang et al., 2021). Toxic
    pollutants such as volatile organic compounds, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, dyes,
    and heavy metals released into the environment from the tannery, textile, and
    electroplating industries have a pH-altering effect on water bodies (de Almeida
    et al., 2019; Khan et al., 2019). Low pH acts as a poison for zooplanktons and
    fishes by impairing their physiological functions (Chowdhury & Saikia, 2020).
    High pH promotes the solubilization of elements present in waste water and badly
    affects the aquatic life (Younas et al., 2017). In light of the permissible limit
    set by WHO, the estimated value of pH in the samples related to the present study
    is not within the range of permissible limits that lie between 6.5 and 8.5. The
    hazardous chemicals in the waste water of tannery industries such as oils, detergents,
    tannins, and chromium impose a noxious effect on the ecosystem. Ammonia and Sulfide
    are produced during various stages of the tanning process. pH less than 8.0 leads
    to the production of hydrogen sulfide (Dixit et al., 2015). Dissolved oxygen (DO)
    In the case of DO (Fig. 3C), the test clarified that the mean value of DO of control
    is significantly different from the mean value of DO of Site 1(LD), Site 2 (LO),
    Site 3(FD), and Site 4 (BD). The mean value of DO of Site 1(LD) is significantly
    different from Site 2 (LO), Site 3 (FD), and Site 4 (BD). The mean value of DO
    of Site 2 (LO) is significantly different from the mean value of DO of Control,
    Site 1(LD), and Site 4 (BD). The mean value of DO of Site 3(FD) is significantly
    different from the mean value of Site 4 (BD). Dissolved oxygen is sweepingly used
    as a parameter to specify the water quality (Varol, 2020). In limnology, it is
    considered an important parameter to check the level of water quality and to give
    a decisive statement about the extent of organic pollution in the particular water
    body. Optimum dissolved oxygen is a lifeline for the aquatic organisms and therefore
    low dissolved oxygen is responsible for the death of aquatic organisms (Verma
    & Prakash, 2020). The value of dissolved oxygen found in the samples of the concerned
    study was far less than the WHO permissible limit. Therefore, this water body
    is considered malodorous for aquatic environments. Total dissolved salts (TDS)
    In the case of TDS (Fig. 3D), the mean value of the control is significantly different
    from the mean value of TDS of Site 1(LD) from the mean value of TDS of Site 2
    (LO), Site 3 (FD), and Site 4 (BD). A significant difference has been observed
    in the mean value of TDS of Site 1 (LD) from the mean value of TDS of Site 2 (LO),
    Site 3 (FD), and Site 4 (BD). There is a significant difference in the mean value
    of TDS of Site 2 (LD) from the mean value of TDS of Control, Site 1(LD), and Site
    4 (BD). The mean value of TDS of Site 3 (BD) is significantly different from the
    mean value of TDS of Site 4 (BD). The total dissolved solids specify the degree
    of dissolved substances (Corwin & Yemoto, 2020; Padmaja et al., 2020). High TDS
    leads to an increase in the value of conductivity and salinity. High salinity
    causes salt stress (Zapana et al., 2020). Salt stress furthermore impairs the
    essential physiological processes of plants such as photosynthesis, germination,
    growth nutrient imbalance, water relation, and yield (Saddiq et al., 2020). The
    estimated value of the total dissolved solid of samples under experimentation
    exceeds the permissible values set by the WHO. The estimated value of the total
    dissolved solid of samples under experimentation exceeds the permissible values
    set by the WHO. Exceeded value of the total dissolved solids and turbidity culminate
    in the fact that the concerned wastewater is hazardous for flora and fauna. Biological
    oxygen demand (BOD) In the case of BOD (Fig. 3E), the test indicated that the
    mean value of BOD of control is significantly different from Site 1 (LD), Site
    2 (LO), Site 3(FD), and Site 4(BD). The mean value of BOD of Site 1(LD) is significantly
    different from the mean value of BOD of Site 2 (LO), Site 3 (FD), and Site 4 (BD).
    The mean value of BOD of Site 2 (LO) is significantly different from the mean
    value of BOD of control, Site 1(LD), and Site 4 (BD). Biochemical oxygen demand
    is the index of the degradable organic matter present in the water. The high value
    of biochemical oxygen demand not only represses the growth of microbes but also
    obtrudes deadly effects on organs and the physiology of aquatic organisms (Yang
    et al., 2021). The values of biochemical oxygen demand in the samples were more
    than the WHO standard and illustrate the huge pollution load of waste water. Electrical
    conductivity (EC) In the case of EC (Fig. 3F), the mean value of EC of control
    is shown significantly different from the mean value of EC of Site 1(LD), Site
    2(LO), Site 3 (FD), and Site 4 (BD). The mean value of EC of Site 1 (LD) is significantly
    different from the mean value of Site 2 (LO), Site 3(FD), and Site 4 (BD). The
    mean value of BOD of Site 2 (LO) is significantly different from Control, Site
    1(LD), and Site 4 (BD). The mean value of Site 3(FD) is significantly different
    from Site 4 (BD). Electrical conductivity is entirely related to the total solids
    present and it can be used to measure the total dissolved ions in the sample (Corwin
    & Yemoto, 2020). Comparison of various physicochemical parameters in different
    sites of the Kala Sanghian drain Water samples from the different sites of the
    Kala Sanghian drain have been collected and analyzed. Water temperature also affects
    the physiology of aquatic organisms and the fertility of land. The temperature
    of water samples of the current study does not go according to guidelines set
    by WHO and IS 10500:1991. It is highest at 45.2 °C for Site 4 and a minimum of
    41.24 °C for Site 1 (Fig. 2A). According to WHO and IS 10500:1991 guidelines,
    the pH value should lie between 6.5 and 8.5. pH of the water samples of the present
    study from the selected sites of the drain was measured. Dissolved oxygen occupies
    a positive role in the existence of aquatic organisms. The values found in the
    water samples collected from four sites were a maximum of 2.32 mg/L for Site 1,
    followed by 1.75 mg/L for Site 2 (LO), 1.73 mg/L for Site 3, and 1.45 mg/L for
    Site 4 (Fig. 2A). TDS is also an excellent parameter to check the water quality
    index. TDS compared from four sites of the drain was observed to be in the range
    of 2426.88 mg/L and 2693.49 mg/L. Its value was lowest in Site 1 and highest in
    Site 4 (Fig. 2B). BOD value confirms the presence of organic impurities in the
    samples and it is considered an important parameter in the physicochemical parametric
    world. It has been clearly illustrated with the help of the figure that values
    of BOD of the water samples are out of the range of values as set by WHO and IS
    10500:1991, with the maximum 259.4 mg/L for Site 4 and minimum 190.6 mg/L for
    Site 1 (Fig. 2B). Electrical conductivity also has a pivotal role in the water
    quality index. The value of electrical conductivity of the water samples collected
    from the selected sites is above the prescribed levels. An electrical conductivity
    maximum of 3617.89 μS/cm and a minimum of 2449.75 μS/cm have been recorded (Fig.
    2B). Comparison of values of physicochemical parameters of the present study with
    earlier literature The wastewater of the present study receives effluents from
    various types of industries such as tannery, textile, and electroplating industries.
    The values of the parameters under consideration crossed the permissible limit
    set by WHO guidelines and other environment-concerned organizations. The temperature
    has a big primacy on water chemistry. It has a high impact on the physiology of
    organisms (Lacy & Rahman, 2022). In the present study, the value of temperature
    was above 40 °C which is again, out of range according to guidelines set by the
    World Health Organization and Indian Standard Specifications for drinking water
    IS: 10,500 (BIS, 2012; WHO, 2008). A similar trend has been seen in some previous
    studies done by Bakar (Bakar et al., 2020). pH value is a key parameter in the
    analysis of water quality as it has a high impact on biochemical processes such
    as degradation, solubility, and metal toxicity. pH range analyzed in the previous
    studies was not in the range set by the concerned organizations. A similar trend
    has been shown by previous studies to cross the limit set by the WHO (Das et al.,
    2017; Fernandez et al., 2019; Garg et al., 2018). Electrical conductivity is also
    a very important parameter. Electrical conductivity and total dissolved solids
    are interrelated to each other and are used to analyze the total dissolved ions
    in the sample matrix (Bakar et al., 2020). According to guidelines set by WHO,
    the value of electrical conductivity should not be above 1000 µS/cm. The result
    found in the present study is 2372.397–3617.89 µs/cm which is quite far away from
    the permissible limit. Previous studies also have shown similar types of higher
    values; 4150 µs/cm in textile wastewater (Islam & Mostafa, 2020). TDS is also
    a major parameter for physicochemical properties. Total dissolved solids unveil
    the degree of dissolved substances. It explores the amount of organic and inorganic
    compounds present in a liquid (Hammani et al., 2022; Islam et al., 2017). TDS
    concentration depends on domestic and agricultural runoff, effluents of industries,
    and products of leaching of soil (Ali et al., 2023). In the current work, the
    TDS value was more than the permissible limit (2693.49 mg/L). In previous studies,
    it has been reported that effluents from tannery and textile industries also had
    TDS values above the permissible limit as set by the WHO (Garg et al., 2018; Kabir
    et al., 2017; Saxena et al., 2018). Biochemical oxygen demand depicts the degradable
    organic matter present in the water. The excess value of biochemical oxygen demand
    affects the growth of microbes and the physiology of aquatic organisms (Yang et
    al., 2021). Values set by WHO is 30 mg/L. In the present studies, it lies between
    196.58 and 259.4 mg/L. Previous studies also show BOD values of wastewater samples
    above the limit set by WHO (Das et al., 2017; Saxena et al., 2018). Islam and
    Mostafa found very high values of BOD of effluents collected from textile industries
    to be in the range of 117–272 mg/L (Islam & Mostafa, 2020). Methneni et al., conducted
    the same type of work, on textile dying industries by collecting water samples
    from dying mills and measuring their BOD levels, which were also above the permissible
    limit as set by WHO and BIS (Methneni et al., 2021). High TDS alters the water
    quality index of water by changing the physicochemical properties of water (Islam
    & Mostafa, 2020). This water stream is unfit for irrigation purposes and depletes
    the fertility of the soil by closing the pores of soil particles. Water quality
    index (WQI) The water quality index was calculated to assess the present condition
    of the drain. The water quality is classified based on the value obtained by applying
    the NFSWQI method as excellent for the WQI value less than 25; good quality for
    WQI 26–50; moderate quality for WQI 51–75; doubtful quality for WQI 76–100; and
    unsuitable quality for more than 100 which indicates highly contaminated water
    that is not suitable for any purposes (Panneerselvam et al., 2023b). In the current
    study, four sites have been analyzed for water quality index, and it has been
    seen that in all sites viz. Site 1 (LD), Site 2 (LO), Site 3 (FD), and Site 4
    (BD), the water quality index was more than 100, indicating a highly contaminated
    drain (Fig. 4A). On comparing all four sites, Site 4 (BD) had a higher water quality
    index. Anthropogenic activities including excessive use of chemicals in agriculture,
    the release of industrial effluents, and the addition of a significant amount
    of sewage or municipal waste are responsible for this high level of pollution
    (Balamurugan et al, 2020b; Panneerselvam et al., 2023b). Fig. 4 WQI (A) and scatter
    plots of various parameters showing positive correlations (B–H) Full size image
    Correlation analysis The linear regression analysis has been applied to explore
    the relationship that exists between different physiochemical parameters. Any
    value between –1 and 1 represents the linear correlation coefficient, which calculates
    the degree of relationship between two series of returns. The two series are more
    related and one is more predictive of the other when the values are closer to
    1. Comparably, the two series are more diametrically opposed to one another and
    would also be predictive of one another the closer the value is to –1. A value
    close to 0 indicates that the two series are unrelated and that there is no relationship
    between the returns of the two series and their returns (Edmonds, 2002). The correlation
    between the different parameters has been analyzed and the type of correlation
    whether it is positive or negative has been represented through scatter plot (Figs.
    4B–H and 5), correlation coefficient (r) (Table 4), and coefficient of determination
    (r2) (Table 5). Fig. 5 Scatter plots of various parameters showing negative correlations

    correlated and the result obtained Full size table In wastewater samples of the
    Kala Sanghian drain physicochemical parameters analysis, a significant positive
    correlation was observed between TDS and temperature (r = 0.994), DO and pH (r = 0.808),
    BOD and temperature (r = 0.987), BOD and TDS (r = 0.978), EC and Temp. (r = 0.963),
    EC and TDS (r = 0.954), and EC and BOD (r = 0.956). The strong positive correlation
    (r = 0.95) seen between electrical conductivity and TDS indicates that the concentration
    of inorganic ions was strongly related to the total solid matter in the effluent
    samples (Hubert & Wolkersdorfer, 2015). There is not always a linear relationship
    between TDS and EC. The salinity and composition of the water play a major role
    in this situation. Mathematical equations describing salinity levels and material
    contents get more complicated as they increase. Finally, the general state of
    water quality can be explained by using the TDS acquired from EC conversion (Rusydi,
    2018). While very high negative and statistically significant correlation was
    observed between pH and temperature (r =  − 0.817), TDS and pH (r =  − 0.791),
    DO and temperature (r =  − 0.995), DO and TDS (r =  − 0.998), BOD and pH (r =  − 0.826),
    BOD and DO (r =  − 0.988), EC and pH (r =  − 0.937), and EC and DO (r =  − 0.96).
    Principal component analysis (PCA) According to the PCA results, the release of
    highly polluted industrial effluents into the drain caused a decline in the physicochemical
    parameters. The varimax technique was used to exclude eigen values greater than
    one in order to rotate the parameters in PCA and extraction. The first two PCs
    account for 99.89% (Table 6) of the variance overall and have significant component
    values as 5.35784 and 0.63545, respectively (Fig. 6A). The PC1 alone has more
    than 89% of the variance and has explained the quality of water at different sites.
    The high positive loading for TDS, temperature, EC, and BOD is seen in Factor
    1 (PC1) (Table 6, Fig. 6B) suggesting that there is a high concentration of salt
    in industrial effluents while the other parameters with negative values indicate
    that the quality of water remained unaffected by these parameters. The high positive
    loadings of pH, BOD, and temperature were displayed by factor 2 (Table 6, Fig.
    6B) which suggests that chemicals with high concentrations of salt are present
    in industrial effluents. Thus, the PCA of the water quality of Kala Sanghian drain
    confirms that the anthropogenic activities including industrial effluent discharge,
    house hold waste disposal and chemical-dominated agricultural practices are the
    deciding factors for chemical attributes of water (Panneerselvam et al., 2023a).

    cluster 1 and cluster 2 corresponding to each stage and coefficient (1 temperature,

    (HCA) The HCA was used to identify the grouping of various water quality parameters
    used during the study. The parameters were grouped into two clusters based on
    similarities where the individual cluster specifies the common action in water
    at different sites under study. The parameters that belong to the same cluster
    might have originated from the same sources. In the current study, the clustering
    based on centroid linkage, reveals two main clusters (Fig. 6C). Cluster 1 consists
    of pH, DO, temperature, and BOD of water while cluster 2 consists of TDS and EC
    of water. Further, in agglomerative hierarchical clustering, the coefficients
    associated with the centroid linkage at each stage correspond to the merger of
    individual data points at each stage (Fig. 6D). It is the average distance between
    the centroids that are relatively close to each other and reflects the relationship
    or resemblance between each data point. It is clear that the coefficient of the
    merger of data points is very low at stages 1 to 3 reflecting a very close merger
    and a high degree of similarities between pH and DO (2,4), temperature and pH
    (1,2), temperature and BOD (1,5) with a slight increase in coefficient at stage
    4 (0.110) at the point of merger between TDS and EC (3,6). There is a sharp rise
    in coefficient at stage 5 (4.232) which reflects a delayed merger between two
    clusters due to greater dissimilarities between the average position of their
    data points. The HCA results and group sample location demonstrated that reverse
    ion exchange processes and industrial effluents are responsible for the contamination
    of the drain. Thus, PCA and HCA study of the data set confirms the high degree
    contribution of anthropogenic activities through the application of chemicals
    in agriculture, disposal of municipal waste, and industrial effluents in the deterioration
    of water quality (Panneerselvam et al., 2023b). Impact of contaminated water on
    aquatic organisms High pH in the effluents speeds up the chances of solubilization
    of elements in the water and affects the physiology of aquatic organisms further
    (Younas et al., 2017). pH values of wastewater samples, of the present study,
    were found in the range of 5.7 to 6.8. In previous studies, it has been seen that
    water samples taken from rivers receiving industrial effluents have alkaline or
    acidic pH (Iloms et al., 2020). Temperature is also a big parameter to decide
    the water quality index of a particular water body and has a high impact on the
    life of aquatic organisms. The rate of biological activities depends on the temperature
    of the water bodies. High temperature affects not only the physiology of the aquatic
    organisms but also the properties of land near water bodies having a high temperature
    (Alekseev & Vinogradova, 2019; Halal et al., 2020). In the present work with increasing
    water temperature, the concentration of dissolved oxygen decreases, and similar
    results were also found by Ariadi et al. and Jane et al. (Ariadi et al., 2019;
    Jane et al., 2021). Total dissolved solids predict the existence of the total
    amount of inorganic (Ca2+ , Mg2+ , K+ , Na+ , HCO3− , Cl− , SO42−) and organic
    matter present in water (Adjovu et al., 2023). The higher value of TDS unveils
    the fact of a high rate of mineralization in water. WHO standardized the limit
    of TDS as the maximum limit is 2000 mg/L (Chegbeleh et al., 2020). Effluent having
    high TDS is entirely unfit for irrigation purposes (Sani et al., 2021). Its channelized
    impact is it blocks the pores of soil and reduces the fertility of the soil (Marathe
    et al., 2021). Optimum dissolved oxygen is mandatory for the survival of the aquatic
    organisms and therefore low dissolved oxygen causes the death of aquatic organisms
    (Laffoley & Baxter, 2019; Sonone et al., 2020). The high value of biochemical
    oxygen demand reduces the growth of microbes and impairs the lethal effect on
    organs and physiological functions of aquatic organisms. It impairs photosynthesis,
    inhibiting plant growth, entering the food chain, providing recalcitrance and
    bioaccumulation, and potentially promoting toxicity, mutagenicity, and carcinogenicity
    (Al-Tohamy et al., 2022). Impact of contaminated water on agriculture Notwithstanding
    the persistently applying wastewater insensitively may have a negative impact
    on the environment, humans, plants, and soil quality (Barber et al., 2019; Saliba
    et al., 2018). Therefore, issues with soil salinization, or an increase in sodium
    ions relative to other cations, the buildup of heavy metals, and low soil quality
    are frequently raised by the reuse of wastewater. These issues primarily stem
    from the source and treatments used on the wastewater as well as the inherent
    characteristics of the soil (Abd-Elwahed, 2018; Ganjegunte et al., 2018). Public
    views of the health profile Respondents to an open-ended question about the most
    common health issues in the community stated that respiratory ailments and skin
    conditions were the most prevalent issues among locals. People also experience
    headaches, pneumonia, hypertension, indigestion, and fever. During the time the
    research was conducted, a high percentage of the participants in the discussions
    stated that they had respiratory and/or skin conditions (Table 7). According to
    the survey, skin issues were highly common in the research area. Since contaminated
    water can find its way into groundwater, almost all interviewees claimed to have
    had skin issues as a result of frequent contact with water, and some participants
    were still experiencing skin issues at the time of the interview. They voluntarily
    displayed to the team the skin lesions on their bodies, especially on their legs
    and hands. It was discovered that the most popular medications in the area were
    those for skin conditions, both allopathic and conventional, after speaking with
    the local physicians and village practitioners. Skin conditions can present with
    boils, irritation, and rash. The communities have provided two primary explanations
    for the origin of the issue. First, it spreads through touch, particularly between
    kids who grow up in unhygienic surroundings. Exposure to chemicals used in factories
    is the second, and more commonly reported, cause. Here, people use the river water
    for agricultural purposes, which brings them into contact with it and the risk
    factor could be higher for children in comparison to adults (Panneerselvam et
    al., 2020). The wastewater discharged from leather industries is undoubtedly is
    potential risk to the ecosystem including the health of people and biodiversity
    which could be associated with a lack of proper treatment for effluents before
    discharge to drain (Nabbou et al., 2020), thus, the proper treatment and/or valorization
    of the effluents prior to discharge in any natural ecosystem is essential to ensure
    the environmental sustainability and security (Benyagoub et al., 2018). One of
    the low-cost treatments could be the application of natural green clays for a
    high degree adsorption capacity (Nabbou et al., 2021) or the use of cleaner production
    techniques to minimize water consumption (Benyagoub, 2019) or the use of biological
    treatment approach (Benyagoub et al., 2018) or application of low-cost green adsorbent
    prepared from coconut shell (Sujiono et al., 2022). Table 7 Average score given
    by local people for the prevalence of health problems Full size table Conclusion
    The various chemical processes occurring in industries lead the contaminated water
    to disagree with the permissible limit set by WHO. This wastewater has spiked
    values of various parameters confirming that these water bodies are unsuitable
    for consumption in any kind of anthropogenic activities. On comparison of various
    parameters across the drain, it has been found that temperature is highest at
    45.2 °C for Site 4 and a minimum of 41.24 °C for Site 1. The value of DO for four
    sites was a maximum of 2.32 mg/L for Site 1. TDS compared from four sites of the
    drain was observed to be in the range of 2426.88 mg/L and 2693.49 mg/L. Its value
    was lowest in Site 1 and highest in Site 4. BOD of the water samples is out of
    the range of values as set by WHO and IS 10500:1991, with a maximum of 259.4 mg/L
    for Site 4 and a minimum of 190.6 mg/L for Site 1. An electrical conductivity
    maximum of 3617.89 μS/cm and a minimum of 2449.75 μS/cm have been recorded for
    Site 4 and Site 1, respectively. The ANOVA and multiple comparisons test revealed
    that there is a significant difference in the mean values of parameters among
    the different sites of the drain. In public views of the health profile, it has
    been well elucidated that the contaminated water of the drain is responsible for
    various ill effects on human health. The main diseases prevalent in local people
    were skin disease, fever, pneumonia, indigestion, hypertension, and headache.
    The correlation analysis shows that there exists a positive correlation between
    TDS and temperature (r = 0.994), DO and pH (r = 0.808), BOD and temperature (r = 0.987),
    BOD and TDS (r = 0.978), EC and temperature (r = 0.963), EC and TDS (r = 0.954),
    and EC and BOD (r = 0.956). While very high negative and statistically significant
    correlation was observed between pH and temperature (r =  − 0.817), TDS and pH
    (r =  − 0.791), DO and temperature (r =  − 0.995), DO and TDS (r =  − 0.998),
    BOD and pH (r =  − 0.826), BOD and DO (r =  − 0.988); EC and pH (r =  − 0.937),
    and EC and DO (r =  − 0.96). The outcome of the study reveals that industrial
    effluents are malodorous for both aquatic and terrestrial life. It is extremely
    toxic for human beings and animals living near the concerned site. The values
    of parameters unguardedly confirm the toxicity of the water body under current
    research work. Scope and recommendations Over the past two decades, the protection
    of the environment has become a global issue. This work helps the future researchers
    in making plans for treating the effluent properly before discharging it into
    the water bodies. There is a vast scope for further studies dealing with the physicochemical
    analysis of effluents of various industries. This study recommended all the upcoming
    researchers and stakeholders of the water body to take the concerned issue seriously
    and create awareness in human beings about the sources of pollution, should work
    on the monitoring of wastewater treatment plants, building and implementing bioremediation
    strategies to reduce the pollution load. It must be emphatically endorsed to make
    environmental protection rules and regulations sincerely and further implement
    them strictly with regular monitoring of various quality parameters. Quality regulation
    must be enforced and proper vigilance on industries to set up and regulate properly
    the effluent treatment plants. Industries should have a separate drainage system
    that pours its effluents into the non-residential areas away from humans and animals
    to safeguard them from being consumed. To prevent salt load, eco-friendly methods
    should be utilized in unhairing and liming in tannery industries. It has been
    suggested that the textile effluents should be checked on toxicity potential also
    microbiologically before discharging them in water bodies. As electroplating industries
    are responsible for the addition of acids in the water, suitable metallurgical
    options should be used for the recovery of these acids from water bodies. To ensure
    toxins-free water bodies, it is essential to monitor and evaluate the quality
    index of effluents systematically and repeatedly before discharging them in water
    bodies. Data availability All the basic data are available to the researchers
    and would be provided on demand. References Aalami, A. H., Hoseinzadeh, M., Hosseini

  limitations: The paper focuses on the physicochemical characteristics of industrial
    effluents in the Kala Sanghian drain, but it does not provide specific details
    on the automated irrigation management system or its components. Additionally,
    the study was conducted during the dry season, and it is unclear whether the results
    would be consistent during other seasons with different flow rates and effluent
    discharge patterns.

- analysis: 'The paper analyzes the spatiotemporal variation of groundwater storage
    in the Ordos Basin based on GRACE satellite gravity and climate data. After preprocessing
    the GRACE data and decomposing it into its components (i.e., TWS, CWS, GWS, and
    SWE), a generalized three-cornered hat method was employed to estimate uncertainties
    in the three GRACE mascon datasets (CSR-M, JPL-M, and GSFC-M). Then, the ADF test
    was employed to analyze the stationarity of the GWS sequence spanning 2003 to
    2021. The spatial and temporal variations in GWS were analyzed by dividing the
    time series into two periods: pre-development (2003–2007) and post-development
    (2008–2021). Wavelet analysis was finally employed to investigate the relationship
    between precipitation and GWS in both temporal and spatial domains. The study
    found that before 2008, climate factors were the primary drivers of GWS; after
    2008, human activities, primarily related to coal mining and water consumption,
    became the dominant driver of GWS change, leading to significant groundwater depletion
    in the basin. Additionally, the impact of human activities on GWS was mainly concentrated
    in the saturated zone. This study underscores the importance of considering both
    natural and anthropogenic factors in groundwater management and highlights the
    need for sustainable water management practices in the Ordos Basin to mitigate
    groundwater depletion and promote environmentally conscious development.'

  description: Groundwater is the primary source for drinking, agriculture, irrigation,
    industrial, and municipal uses in Ordos Basin, a regional energy and heavy chemical
    industrial base in China. In recent decades, groundwater levels in the basin have
    declined due to climate change and anthropogenic activity. Analyses of the spatiotemporal
    variation of groundwater storage are crucial to regional sustainability. This
    study conducts the analysis utilizing GRACE gravity satellite data and GLDAS model
    data, employing methods that include the generalized three-cornered hat, Augmented
    Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, and wavelet analysis to investigate the spatiotemporal
    variation of groundwater storage in the basin. The analysis results indicate that
    (1) before 2008, the climate had a significant influence on groundwater storage,
    with minimal impact from human activities, while after 2008, human activities
    have caused a noticeable decline in groundwater storage, particularly in the eastern

    Abstract Groundwater is the primary source for drinking, agriculture, irrigation,
    industrial, and municipal uses in Ordos Basin, a regional energy and heavy chemical
    industrial base in China. In recent decades, groundwater levels in the basin have
    declined due to climate change and anthropogenic activity. Analyses of the spatiotemporal
    variation of groundwater storage are crucial to regional sustainability. This
    study conducts the analysis utilizing GRACE gravity satellite data and GLDAS model
    data, employing methods that include the generalized three-cornered hat, Augmented
    Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, and wavelet analysis to investigate the spatiotemporal
    variation of groundwater storage in the basin. The analysis results indicate that
    (1) before 2008, the climate had a significant influence on groundwater storage,
    with minimal impact from human activities, while after 2008, human activities
    have caused a noticeable decline in groundwater storage, particularly in the eastern
    region. (2) The eastern region of the basin experienced a decline in groundwater
    storage with a rate of −1.86 cm/yr, the middle region with a rate of −1.24 cm/yr,
    and the western region with a rate of −0.63 cm/yr. The extensive extraction of
    petroleum, natural gas, coal, and mineral resources in the basin has contributed
    to this pattern. (3) Human activities have altered the hydrological processes
    from precipitation infiltration, groundwater propagation, and groundwater distribution,
    leading to an increasingly complex groundwater system. (4) Human activities affect
    groundwater in the saturated zone more extensively than in the unsaturated zone.
    The research findings highlight that human activities are the main factor driving
    the variation in groundwater storage in the basin and provide crucial scientific
    evidence for protecting groundwater resources. Previous article in issue Next

    testWavelet analysisSpatiotemporal variation 1. Introduction The launch of the
    Gravity satellites of the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) in 2002
    has created a new era for detailed measurements of the Earth''s gravity field
    and water storage, including groundwater, soil moisture, water reservoirs, ice,
    and oceans (Tapley et al., 2019, Yin et al., 2018). The GRACE data have facilitated
    one of the most effective and efficient means to evaluate groundwater storage
    (GWS) and variability due to the high cost of the traditional groundwater monitoring
    network (Ali et al., 2021, Zuo et al., 2021). Compared with traditional hydrological
    observation approaches (groundwater level monitoring networks), GRACE provide
    information at multi-temporal and large spatial scales (such as remote, inaccessible
    areas, concentrated human activities areas, global areas, day - seasonal - annual,
    etc.). The data are helpful for analysis and interpretation, but they also face
    problems such as poor spatial and temporal resolution, significant errors, and
    extensive data interpretation (Chen et al., 2022, Dube et al., 2023, Heki and
    Jin, 2023, Humphrey et al., 2023, Kvas et al., 2019, Ramillien et al., 2008, Rodell
    and Reager, 2023, Wahr et al., 2006). As explained in Yeh et al., 2015 and 2023,
    groundwater hydrology faces different scale issues: scales of heterogeneities,
    observations, models, and interests. GRACE must integrate with local-scale observations
    and models to increase their resolutions for the scale of our interests. Thus,
    satellite surveys could play a significant role in computerized axial tomography
    scanning the subsurface in the future (Yeh et al., 2008, Yeh et al., 2015, Yeh
    et al., 2023). Recent studies (Long et al., 2017, Nie et al., 2021) have shown
    that atmospheric pressure, crustal motion, and noise of satellite instruments,
    among others, introduce errors and disturbances in analyzing GWS variations of
    long-time-series GRACE data. Most previous studies try to solve this problem through
    theories such as noise distribution estimation and Kalman filtering, but weakening
    the noise also reduces the actual signal strength (Chen et al., 2020a, Chen et
    al., 2020b, Mehrnegar et al., 2020). For this reason, researchers use hydrological
    models, such as the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) developed jointly
    by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the United
    States, as a reference to recover the real signals attenuated after filtering
    and the real-time-varying characteristics are retained as much as possible (Li
    et al., 2018, Yao et al., 2019). After analyzing the changes in long-time series
    GWS and their driving factors on global and basin scales, researchers (Rodell
    et al., 2009, Tapley et al., 2019, Zou et al., 2021) concluded that climate change
    and other factors have significantly impacted on GWS. Yin et al., (2018) also
    reported that due to the limitation of temporal and spatial continuity of GRACE
    observation, the existing data sets are difficult to apply to study small and
    medium-sized regions directly, and it is necessary to fuse multi-source data for
    comprehensive analysis. At present, most of the studies utilized related meteorological
    and underlying surface parameters and scaled down the change of water reserves
    through statistical models or machine learning theory (Ali et al., 2021, Wang
    et al., 2020, Zuo et al., 2021). However, these approaches are unsuitable for
    areas where the parameters are not closely related to the change of water reserves,
    and they fail to reveal the qualitative and quantitative influence of human activities
    on the change of GWS. Abundant natural resources, including coal, petroleum oil,
    natural gas, and rare metals, have been discovered in Ordos Basin, one of the
    large basins in the semiarid region of China. The basin has become China''s energy
    and heavy chemical industrial base, which has consumed significant water resources,
    and groundwater has been the primary component supporting economic and social
    developments. For these reasons, scientists have investigated the GWS of the basin
    using GRACE data in Ordos Basin. With the improvement of the data processing ability
    of GRACE, researchers began to apply it to GWS estimation in many regions, such
    as Ordos Basin (Goteti et al., 2008, Ramillien et al., 2008, Swenson and Wahr,
    2003). Satellite remote sensing technology has been gradually integrated into
    the study of GWS, especially the evaluation of groundwater potential, storage
    capacity, and flux, and it has been combined with numerical modeling, geographic
    information system, and ground information to obtain more vivid hydrological process
    characteristics (Becker, 2006, Zhao, 2010). However, the early research results
    are at relatively low resolutions. With the continuous progress of technology,
    more complex models have been proposed, which combine multi-source heterogeneous
    data such as groundwater level observation data to improve the overall accuracy
    and reliability of the model (Forootan et al., 2014, Humphrey et al., 2016, Ni
    et al., 2018). Humphrey et al., 2016, Li et al., 2022, Ni et al., 2018, and Wada
    et al. (2017) combined the models with Global Positioning System, The Tropical
    Rainfall Measuring Mission, and other satellite sensors. They analyzed the trend,
    seasonal cycle, sub-seasonal anomalies, and extreme situations of GWS time series
    changes in typical arid areas and around the world. They then analyzed the response
    of GWS to ENSO, sea level change, and other events. In addition, researchers began
    to focus on small-scale GWS changes, especially in small areas. For example, Wu
    et al. (2019) estimated Ordos Basin''s groundwater recharge with the improved
    groundwater level fluctuation method using the data of GRACE and GLDAS. The results
    show no apparent long-term trend in groundwater recharge from 2002 to 2012, and
    the annual recharge amount ranges from 30.8 mm to 66.5 mm, of which 42 % can be
    explained by the change in annual precipitation (Wu, 2019, Wu et al., 2019). Likewise,
    Li et al. (2023) analyzed the uncertainty of GRACE products in different basins
    in China under different research scales using the Bayesian average model. They
    quantified the annual GWS change and its uncertainty and showed that it varied
    from basin to basin, but all were strongly related to soil moisture. At the same
    time, researchers have made efforts in data processing and corrections in recent
    years and gradually began to comprehensively analyze gravity satellite data with
    geological, meteorological, surface deformation and other multidisciplinary data
    to fully understand the influencing factors of GWS changes (Rodell and Reager,
    2023, Seka et al., 2022, Springer et al., 2023). The previous groundwater studies
    (e.g., Huang et al., 2020, Pan et al., 2017, Zhang et al., 2021) using GRACE data
    mainly focused on regional GWS variations and less on hydrological mechanisms
    under the effects of climate change and human activities. Unlike previous studies,
    this study intends to investigate the mechanism of how human activities affect
    the periodicity of groundwater hydrological processes, taking Ordos Basin as an
    example. By dividing the hydrological time series into two phases (i.e., pre-development
    and post-development periods) using the Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) test, this
    study aims to determine human activity''s role in hydrological processes using
    wavelet analysis. Furthermore, this study intends to identify the spatial differences
    of GWS variations and try to explain this change. 2. Research methodology and
    data source 2.1. Research area Ordos Basin is located in the eastern part of the
    northwestern region of China, with geographical coordinates ranging from 105°
    45′ to 112° 13′ E and 33° 42′ to 41° 49′ N (Zhong et al., 2016). It spans five
    provinces and regions, namely Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, and Shanxi,
    with a total area of approximately 37 × 104 km2 (Fig. 1). The basin has an average
    annual precipitation of 150–770 mm. It features a temperate continental monsoon
    climate (Hou et al., 2017). Situated south of the “∩” character-shaped bend of
    the Yellow River, the basin is part of the Yellow River Basin except for the inland
    area in the central part of the desert plateau. The northern part of the basin
    is the desert area of Ordos, including the Hobq Desert, Mu Us Sand land, hills
    and dunes, and an underdeveloped river system. The southern part is the Loess
    Plateau, with a well-developed dendritic river system that eventually converges
    into the Wei River, a tributary of the Yellow River. Download : Download high-res

    elevation model of Ordos Basin (Modified from Zhong et al., 2016). Geologically,
    Ordos Basin is a south-north trending asymmetrical syncline with a gentle eastern
    slope and a steep western slope (Fig. 2). The eastern flank consists of westward-dipping
    monoclines. In contrast, the western flank is characterized by numerous north–south
    trending faults (Hou et al., 2010). The syncline structure is conducive to groundwater
    recharge, and water from both flanks converges and infiltrates to form groundwater
    in the central part of the basin. In addition, Ordos Basin consists of vertically
    stacked and horizontally interconnected aquifer systems. From bottom to top, the
    system includes karst aquifers in the Cambrian-Ordovician carbonate rocks, fractured
    aquifers in the Carboniferous-Jurassic clastic rocks, fractured and porous aquifers
    in the Cretaceous clastic rock formations, as well as porous media aquifers in
    the Quaternary strata (Hou et al., 2008, Hou et al., 2007). Download : Download

    and hydrogeological profile from the east to the west (Lvliang-Helan). Ordos Basin
    is rich in energy and mineral resources such as coal, natural gas, oil, and salt
    rock. Specifically, the coal storage in Ordos Basin accounts 38.8 % of total storage
    in China. Natural gas storage is 50 %, salt rock 70 %, and oil 4.4 %. China''s
    government decided to develop energy sources in Ordos Basin in 1998, and large-scale
    development began in 2006 (Hou et al., 2008). Groundwater is the primary water
    resource for drinking, agriculture, irrigation, and industrial and municipal uses
    in the basin. How to conserve valuable groundwater during energy resource development
    is a big challenge for hydrogeology. 2.2. Data and methodology 2.2.1. Data collection
    The GRACE/GRACE-FO satellite provides Earth''s time-variable gravity information,
    revealing GWS information using equivalent water height in the form of spherical
    harmonic coefficients and mascon solutions. The mascon solution reduces leakage
    errors at the ocean-land boundaries and overcomes the leakage errors caused by
    filtering in traditional spherical harmonic coefficients (Zhang and Sun, 2022).
    It requires no further post-processing and is user-friendly, making it more suitable
    for regional studies. In this study, we selected monthly GRACE mascon products
    from 2003 to 2021, including three products from the Center for Space Research
    (CSR) at the University of Texas, Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and Goddard
    Space Flight Center (GSFC), all of which are available from the NASA website (https://download.csr.utexas.edu/outgoing/gracefo/RL06.1LRI/).
    Using GRACE satellite data, the GLDAS model provides global data on variables
    such as air temperature, snow water equivalent, land surface runoff, and soil
    water content at depths of 0–200 cm. We selected the GLDAS Noah model, which simulates
    water storage changes with smaller biases, to obtain water storage changes related
    to snow, canopy water, and soil water components (https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets/GLDAS_NOAH025_M_2.1).
    The data has a monthly temporal resolution and a spatial resolution of 0.25° ×
    0.25°. In addition, we collected precipitation and coal production data as indicators
    of natural and human factors, respectively, to further identify the influencing
    factors of groundwater. The precipitation data were from the China Meteorological
    Administration''s National Meteorological Science Data Sharing Service Platform,
    which administrates the China Daily Surface Climate Dataset (V3.0). The coal production
    data were from provincial and municipal statistical yearbooks and statistical
    bulletins on national economic and social development. 2.2.2. Data processing
    In this study, the average mascon values from the three institutions (i.e., CSR-M,
    JPL-M and GSFC-M, where M represent Mascon) were used to improve the accuracy
    of the data (Seyoum and Milewski, 2017). Using the mascon data, we determined
    the anomaly of monthly terrestrial total water storage (ΔTWS in terms of equivalent
    water height, EWH) relative to 2003–2021. Data of missing months were interpolated
    using linear interpolation. The derived TWS from GRACE data includes comprehensive
    changes in all forms of water, including the above-ground and underground components
    (Mo et al., 2016, Rodell et al., 2006). Therefore, the GWS variation can be derived
    from the following equation: (1) In equation (1), ΔGWS, ΔCWS, ΔSMS, and ΔSWE are
    the anomalies of GWS, canopy water storage, soil water storage, and snow water
    equivalent relative to the period 2003–2021, expressed in millimeters. Afterward,
    subtracting the contributions of canopy water, soil water, and snow water equivalent
    from TWS yields the GWS data. It is important to note that all data have been
    resampled to a resolution of 0.5° × 0.5° and are represented as anomalies relative
    to the period 2003–2021, in the form of equivalent water height representing the
    changes in GWS. 3. Method 3.1. Generalized three-cornered hat This study uses
    GTCH (generalized three-cornered hat) to estimate uncertainties for three sets
    of data, i.e., CSR-M, JPL-M and GSFC-M, denoted as (i, j, k). Ferreira et al.
    (2016) showed GTCH to be an effective method for quantifying the relative uncertainties
    of three or more datasets without the need for a reference dataset, and it does
    not require complete independence of the datasets (Feng et al., 2021, Ferreira
    et al., 2016, Yao et al., 2019). Each data set of the three sets is expressed
    as the sum of the true values and the measurement errors : (2) Given the difference
    between any two sets of observations among the three data sets (i, j, k) is, (3)
    The variances of the differences corresponding to Eq. (3) are (4) If the errors
    of the three data sets are mutually independent, then, the covariances . The variance
    of a single observation error can be obtained by computing (5) However, in this
    study, the three observation sequences used are not necessarily independent, and
    their correlations need to be considered, i.e., the covariance may not be zero.
    Premoli and Tavella (1993) and Tavella and Premoli (1994) have proposed a modified
    GTCH by considering the correlation. This paper analyzes the uncertainty of the
    datasets using the modified GTCH (Ferreira et al., 2016). 3.2. Augmented dickey-fuller
    (ADF) test The assessment of stationarity in the time series of groundwater storage
    is a fundamental prerequisite for the subsequent analysis and discussion of its
    spatiotemporal dynamics. In this study, we employed the Augmented Dickey-Fuller
    (ADF) test, a widely recognized unit root test, to examine the stationarity of
    the groundwater storage time series spanning 2003 to 2021 (Lopez, 1997). The ADF
    test assumes the null hypothesis of the presence of a unit root in the series,
    which indicates non-stationarity. By calculating the test statistic and comparing
    it against critical values associated with various confidence levels (10 %, 5
    %, 1 %), we can assess the significance of the results. Rejection of the null
    hypothesis at a given confidence level (90 %, 95 %, or 99 %) provides evidence
    of stationarity, signifying that the series possesses a stable, time-invariant
    behavior. 3.3. Wavelet coherence analysis This study applies the wavelet coherence
    analysis to reveal any correlation between precipitation and groundwater storage
    in both temporal and spatial domains. For two time series, the wavelet coherence
    is defined as, (6) S represents a smoothing operator and denotes the cross-correlation
    coefficient between the two-time series. The coherence value ranges between 0
    and 1: higher values indicate a stronger correlation. 4. Results 4.1. Terrestrial
    total water storage (TWS) and its uncertainty The GRACE mascon grid data from
    three institutions (CSR, JPL, and GSFC) were processed to obtain monthly time
    series data of TWS in terms of equivalent water height. They are designated as
    CSR-M, JPL-M, and GSFC-M. The results indicate consistently significant decreases
    in TWS, with rates of −0.66 cm/yr, −0.86 cm/yr, and −0.95 cm/yr, respectively
    (Fig. 3). Differences in processing methods and parameter settings led to some
    discrepancies in the three solutions. For this reason, the average of the three
    datasets was used to estimate the TWS in the study area. Download : Download high-res

    −0.84 cm/yr. Table 1 shows the computed uncertainties using the GTCH method of
    the three GRACE mascon datasets: specifically, the uncertainties are 4.08 cm for
    CSR-M, 1.64 cm for JPL-M, and 1.96 cm GSFC-M. Because of these uncertainties,
    the average of these three datasets was utilized to estimate TWS in Ordos Basin.

    classification The variation in terrestrial total water storage (TWS) from the
    GRACE data were decomposed into GWS, CWS, SMS, and SWE components. The GRACE data
    from 2003 to 2021 were utilized to analyze the temporal changes in GWS in Ordos
    Basin by ADF test (Table 2). The calculations involved determining the water storage
    of each component and examining the temporal variations in precipitation (Fig.
    4). Table 2. ADF test. Year T-statistic P-value 1 % 5 % 10 % 2003–2007 −5.19 <0.05

    of different components in Ordos Basin. During 2003–2021, the GWS exhibited a
    significant decreasing trend with an average rate of −0.97 cm/yr. The non-stationarity
    of the GWS sequence was confirmed through the ADF test. As such, the GWS variation
    was divided into two periods: the pre-development period from 2003 to 2007, characterized
    by a stationary groundwater storage sequence, and the post-development period
    from 2008 to 2021, during which the groundwater storage showed a significant decreasing
    trend with a rate of −1.10 cm/yr, indicating a non-stationary sequence (Fig. 4).
    Precipitation is generally the primary source of soil water content, which can
    infiltrate and recharge groundwater resources through percolation. This study
    explores the factors driving the variations in GWS by piecewise analysis to quantify
    the relationships between precipitation, soil moisture, and GWS by comparing the
    pre- and post-development periods. The study reveals that precipitation exhibits
    relatively small interannual and intramonthly variations, with higher precipitation
    during the summer and autumn seasons and low amounts during the spring and winter
    seasons, which aligns with the seasonal patterns observed in GWS variations. During
    the pre-development period, soil moisture and GWS exhibited similar trends, and
    a rapid response to increased precipitation was observed in July 2003, a month
    with significantly high precipitation. In the post-development period, soil moisture
    data show an increasing trend in variability, while precipitation remains relatively
    consistent with the pre-development period. However, GWS exhibits a significant
    decreasing trend, likely attributed to groundwater pumping from saturated zones
    during the post-development. Human activities have become the dominant driver
    of GWS changes since 2008, whereas their influence on regional groundwater before
    2008 was relatively minor. 4.3. Temporal and spatial variations of groundwater
    storage and its spatial zoning We divided the groundwater variation during the
    post-development period (2008–2021) in Ordos Basin into three regions based on
    the degrees of GWS decline. As illustrated in Fig. 5a, the region with the severe
    decline (from −2.33 to −1.62 cm per year) is highlighted green (A1), the region
    with the significant decline (from −1.62 to −0.91 cm per year) is painted yellow
    (A2), and the region with the slight decline (from −0.91 to −0.21 cm per year)
    is colored pink (A3). The A1 region occupies 15.6 % of the study area, A2 covers
    46.7 %, and A3 covers 37.7 %. Fig. 5b shows the spatial distribution of precipitation,
    declining from the south above 600 mm to the north beneath 550 mm. The spatial
    distribution of GWS variation differed from precipitation in the basin. The facts
    restress that anthropogenic activities dominate the GWS distribution in post-development.

    average precipitation (b) in Ordos Basin. Fig. 6 shows the dynamic evolution processes
    and spatial distributions of GWS in the basin from 2003 to 2021. In the pre-development
    period (2003–2007), GWS in the A2 region had some positive balance (deep blue
    areas), while GWS in the remaining parts was close to balance (yellow to light
    gray colors). However, in the post-development (2008–2021), GWS in the A2 and
    A3 regions began to decline and became a negative balance. These trends became
    worse with time. The A2 region is the desert plateau, with gentle terrain and
    a high surface infiltration coefficient, resulting in minimal surface runoff from
    precipitation and abundant groundwater resources. In the eastern region with rich
    coal mining resources, land subsidence is associated with coal mining and excessive
    exploitation of water resources, leading to severe groundwater level decline.
    The GWS variation is consistent with hydrogeological conditions and economic situations.

    between human activities and groundwater The preceding results showed that the
    main driving factors of GWS reduction in Ordos Basin were consistent with the
    findings of previous studies. The decreasing trends from GRACE data are mostly
    related to human impacts. Specifically, coal mining water consumption is the main
    factor causing the decrease in GWS, consistent with the conditions in the Loess
    Plateau and the Mongolia Plateau (Tao, et al., 2015, Xie et al., 2018). Niu (2003)
    reported that the average drainage coefficient of all types of coal mines in the
    mining area is 0.88 (i.e., each ton of raw coal production needs to consume 0.88
    m3 of water). Although the GRACE mascon from the three sources and groundwater
    in Ordos Basin from 2003 to 2021 were consistent in variation trends and correlated
    well, uncertainties still existed among the results. The monitoring wells in the
    study area were very few and unevenly distributed, leading to uncertainty in the
    assessment of in situ groundwater (Chen et al., 2020a, Chen et al., 2020b). Obtaining
    a large and evenly distributed monitoring well data set, especially in areas with
    high human activity, is essential for improving the accuracy of the original groundwater
    data and validating the annual GRACE mascon results. The suggestion is consistent
    with the paper by Yeh et al. (2008). 5.2. Regional analysis of groundwater, soil
    water, and precipitation Fig. 8 depicts the temporal variations of GWS, soil moisture
    storage (SMS), and monthly average precipitation over the basin during the post-development
    period. Lines with dots of different colors indicate the averaged GWS over regions
    A1, A2, and A3 (denoted by GWS1, GWS2, and GWS3, respectively). Similarly, color
    solid lines marked SMS1, SMS2, and SMS3 represent the moisture storage in the
    three regions. Download : Download high-res image (382KB) Download : Download

    in Ordos Basin. GWS1, GSW2 and GWS3 denote GWS in regions of A1, A2 and A3, respectively.
    SM1, SM2 and SM3 mean SMS in regions of A1, A2 and A3, respectively. Precipitation
    1, precipitation 2 and precipitation 3 indicate precipitation in regions of A1,
    A2, and A3, respectively. As discussed previously, precipitation is the primary
    source of the basin''s regional groundwater and soil moisture. Shapes and magnitudes
    of the average precipitation over the basin varied slightly but remained similar.
    The SMS in the three regions follow the basin-averaged precipitation pattern,
    remain above zero, and SMS1 is larger than the other two. The soil moisture in
    the region remains relatively stable and exhibits variations in response to precipitation.
    In contrast, GWS1, GWS2, and GWS3 exhibit clear decreasing trends but with different
    rates over time. The precipitation, SMS, and GWS trends strongly suggest that
    human activities, e.g., groundwater pumping and coal mine dewatering, significantly
    impact the saturated zone, reducing GWS, and have minor effects on SMS in the
    unsaturated zone. Additionally, the A1 region experiences the highest level of
    human impact, as indicated by groundwater depletion at −1.86 ± 0.16 cm/yr at 95
    % significance. The A2 region shows medium groundwater decline at −1.24 ± 0.04
    cm/yr at 95 % significance. In contrast, the A3 region exhibits a slight groundwater
    decrease at −0.63 ± 0.05 cm/yr at 95 % significance, indicating the most negligible
    human influences. Next, we investigate whether human activities alter the periodicity
    of groundwater hydrological processes using wavelet coherence analysis to check
    the change in the correlation between groundwater storage and precipitation time
    series. Fig. 9 shows that the wavelet coherence coefficients between precipitation
    and GWS during the pre-development period (2003–2007) have obvious seasonal and
    annual periodicity for all regions. Fig. 9a and 9b are the coherence maps for
    the A1 region during pre-and post-development periods, respectively. The maps
    for A2 during the two periods are illustrated in Fig. 9c and 9d. The A3 region''s
    maps are displayed in Fig. 9e and 9f. A comparison of these maps during the pre-development
    (Fig. 9a, c, and e) and those of the post-development periods (Fig. 9a, c, and
    e) reveals that the apparent periodic cross-correlations between precipitation
    and GWS in the pre-development disappeared at the basin. This result implies that
    after 2008, human activities changed the natural cycle of groundwater hydrological
    processes and altered the rhythm between precipitation and groundwater, making
    the groundwater system behaviors less related to those of the precipitation. Download

    the three regions, showing R1 ranges from −0.71 to −0.89 and R2 from −0.88 to
    −0.95. It also shows that during the post-development period, GWS is highly correlated
    with RCP and GDP in the three regions, confirming that groundwater pumping and
    dewatering from coal mines are the factors leading to the decline in GWS. Download

    A3 −0.71 −0.95 The absolute values of correlation coefficients between GWS and
    RCP decrease slightly from A1 to A3 regions, indicating that the RCP had more
    effects on GWS in A1 due to the largest RCP. On the other hand, the absolute values
    of correlation coefficients between GWS and GDP increase from A1 to A3 regions
    accompanied by increased GDP values, indicating that the economic scales also
    affect GWS in Ordos Basin. We divide regions according to spatial differences
    in coal reserves. There are significant differences in coal reserves in the three
    regions. The coal reserves of the eastern, central and western sub-regions are
    270.9 billion tons, 157.1 billion tons, and 167.6 billion tons, respectively (A1-
    A3 regional), and their total annual coal output exceeds 670 million tons in 2021
    (Sun et al., 2022, Cheng et al., 2023). Previous studies have shown that the groundwater
    in Ordos Basin exhibits a significant downward trend due to coal mining in recent
    years (Chen et al., 2020a, Chen et al., 2020b, Feng et al., 2020). Sun et al.
    (2022) used the remote sensing ecological index as the ecological assessment index.
    They analyzed the spatial–temporal changes in the correlations between water storage
    and the ecology environment in high-intensity coal mining areas over the long
    term. They concluded that coal mining have played a key role in Ordos Basin. 6.
    Conclusion This study analyzed GRACE satellite data to investigate the groundwater
    storage (GWS) in Ordos Basin. GWS in the basin was estimated by integrating hydrological
    model data. Uncertainty in the estimate was quantified using the generalized hat
    method, and the periods were divided based on Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test.
    The basin was divided into three regions based on GWS change rates, and the spatial
    and temporal characteristics of GWS and influencing factors were assessed by wavelet
    analysis. The following conclusions were drawn: 1. Under climate change and human
    influence, the groundwater processes in Ordos Basin exhibit distinct spatiotemporal
    characteristics. Temporally, GWS was primarily influenced by climate before 2008,
    with significant wavelet coherence coefficients between precipitation and GWS.
    From 2008 to 2021, regional GWS was predominantly affected by human activities,
    showing a significant decreasing trend. 2. Based on the spatial variation of GWS,
    Ordos Basin can be divided into three regions from 2008 to 2021. The eastern region
    experienced a decline in GWS with a rate of −1.86 cm/yr, the middle region with
    a rate of −1.24 cm/yr, and the western region with a rate of −0.63 cm/yr. The
    main reason for this pattern is the extensive extraction of petroleum, natural
    gas, coal, and mineral resources in Ordos Basin. The decline rates are consistent
    with energy production. 3. The impact of human activities on GWS mainly concentrates
    on the saturated zone, while the influence on the soil moisture in the unsaturated
    zone is minimal. From 2008 to 2021, regional soil moisture content remained relatively
    stable and consistent with precipitation, even if the GWS declined. The facts
    further prove that groundwater pumping is a significant cause of GWS decline.
    4. Human activities have altered the natural cyclic patterns between precipitation
    and GWS. Before 2008, apparent annual and seasonal variations existed in the relationship
    between precipitation and GWS. However, since 2008, human activities have disrupted
    the cyclic patterns at the annual and seasonal scales, leading to a more complex
    relationship between precipitation and GWS. The study highlights the importance
    of considering natural and anthropogenic factors in understanding groundwater
    dynamics. It provides valuable information for groundwater resource management
    and conservation in this region. The results underscore the need for sustainable
    water management practices to mitigate the adverse effects of groundwater depletion
    and promote the transition towards a more environmentally conscious development
    in Ordos Basin. Lastly, integrating the GRACE satellite data into the idea of
    computerized axial tomography scanning the groundwater basin by Yeh et al. (2008)
    may be the future of subsurface science. CRediT authorship contribution statement

  journal: Journal of Hydrology
  limitations: The study is limited by the accuracy of the GRACE data, which can be
    influenced by factors such as atmospheric pressure, crustal motion, and noise
    from satellite instruments. Additionally, the study relies on GLDAS model data
    for land surface parameters, which may introduce uncertainties in the analysis.
    The analysis also focuses on regional-scale variations in GWS and does not consider
    local-scale variations that may be influenced by factors such as topography and
    geology.

  title: Analysis of the spatiotemporal variation of groundwater storage in Ordos
    Basin based on GRACE gravity satellite data
  verbatim_quote1: The eastern region of the basin experienced a decline in groundwater
    storage with a rate of −1.86 cm/yr, the middle region with a rate of −1.24 cm/yr,
    and the western region with a rate of −0.63 cm/yr.
  verbatim_quote2: The extensive extraction of petroleum, natural gas, coal, and mineral
    resources in the basin has contributed to this pattern.

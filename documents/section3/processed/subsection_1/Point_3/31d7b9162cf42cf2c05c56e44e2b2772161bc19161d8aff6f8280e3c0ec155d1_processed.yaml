    This paper presents a novel cognitive radio-based hospital system architecture
    called CogMed for e-health applications, including a priority mechanism-aware
    heterogeneous architecture, system design, and communication policies. It analyzes
    the shortcomings of recent wireless healthcare facilities and proposes a fully
    opportunistic network-based hospital system architecture where dynamic spectrum
    access (DSA) capable medical, non-medical, and sensor devices are categorized
    based on a dynamic priority management mechanism. The paper also presents some
    communication protocols. \n\nAlthough the paper does not directly address the
    specific issue of data volume, frequency, format, or source in the context of
    irrigation management, some general observations can be made based on its focus
    on wireless communication in a healthcare environment.\n\nThe authors acknowledge
    that different types of e-health applications have different priorities, and therefore,
    communication protocols and network maintenance policies for wireless healthcare
    need to be priority mechanism agile. This suggests that the proposed CogMed architecture
    is designed to accommodate diverse requirements for data transmission in terms
    of volume, frequency, and format. \n\nAdditionally, the paper mentions that the
    proposed system includes a dynamic priority management mechanism for categorizing
    medical, non-medical, and sensor devices. This mechanism could potentially be
    used to prioritize data transmission based on factors such as the urgency or importance
    of the data, ensuring that critical information is transmitted reliably and efficiently.
    \n\nWhile the paper does not provide specific details on the data formats or sources
    supported by CogMed, it is reasonable to assume that the system is designed to
    handle various data types commonly encountered in healthcare settings, such as
    patient vital signs, medical images, and electronic health records. \n\n**Overall,
    the paper provides a conceptual framework for a priority-aware wireless healthcare
    system, but it does not delve into the specific technical aspects of data management
    and transmission that are relevant to the context of irrigation management.**'

    transmission has received tremendous attention to the researchers since effective,
    timely, accurate, complete and unambiguous communication reduces errors and results
    in improved patient safety. However, wireless communication technology in a healthcare
    environment poses some major challenges. For example, medical band scarcity for
    future wireless healthcare system, bandwidth restriction, spectrum utilization
    and electromagnetic interference (EMI) are major concerned. In addition, different
    types of e-health applications have different priorities. Therefore, communication

    IEEE Conference Location: Firenze, Italy SECTION I. Introduction A. Background
    and limitation on Wireless Healthcare Wireless communication is a key technology
    to improve mobility and service flexibility for different e-health applications
    such as remote patient monitoring, telemedicine, and mobile hospital information
    system applications [1]. The transmission of medical information such as vital
    signs can be performed using any or a combination of the existing wireless technologies,
    e.g., cellular, WiFi, Zigbee, Bluetooth. Each of these technologies provides different
    advantages in terms of coverage (e.g., cellular) or bandwidth (e.g., WiFi) [2].
    With the advent of heterogeneous wireless access networks, recent healthcare system
    can take advantages on both licensed and unlicensed bands to serve an increasing
    amount of automated health monitoring demands [2]–[3]. However, radio spectrum
    is a finite precious natural resource and almost all portion of spectrum has already
    been allocated. FCC has allocated a very small amount of spectrum for wireless
    medical purposes, which can lead to a spectrum scarcity problem for upcoming wireless
    biomedical technologies and tele-health applications [1] [4]. This leads towards
    dynamic spectrum assess (DSA) or opportunistic frequency usage in future wireless
    medical field. Healthcare system and healthcare facility has also facing problem
    with wireless devices [5]. In a wireless healthcare system, most of the researchers
    focus on electromagnetic interference (EMI) that emitted from wireless devices
    while transmitting data whereas EMI effects on medical devices in a hospital [4]–[6].
    Wireless medical devices face EMI problems in a scenario where two devices operate
    in the same frequency at the same time in a same area [1] [4]–[6]. In such scenario,
    some wireless medical devices can be malfunctioned even though they do not operate
    within a very close proximity [1] [4]. That is why conventional electronic medical
    devices in healthcare facility equipped with frequency jammer to protect those
    medical devices. However, this is not considered as intelligent solution for hospital
    since communication plays a key role in a tele healthcare system [7]. B. Cognitive
    radio and cognitive radio driven recent healthcare literature analysis The key
    concept of cognitive radio is to make use of the unutilized license radio spectrum
    in an adaptable and opportunistic manner. A cognitive radio has the ability to
    measure, sense and be aware of the characteristics of the radio channel atmosphere
    like availability of spectrum, power, interference, noise level, user application
    and other operating restrictions [9]. Cognitive radio network operation may involve
    the following four steps: spectrum sensing, adaptive learning, spectrum decision,
    and transmission parameter setting [8]–[9]. It also can play a vital role in future
    wireless healthcare and medical telemetric monitoring system. Cognitive radio
    network and spectrum sensing concept can contribute to overcome the unlicensed
    band issue, prioritize the device as per services, bandwidth constrain, EMI optimization
    and reliability for wireless devices in health care sector mainly on hospital
    critical patient status monitoring and telemedicine issue [8]–[16]. Contemporary
    cognitive radio based healthcare system can be discussed and critically analyzed
    based on some parameters, such as architecture and infrastructure type, consideration
    for device in hospital environment, services categories spectrum sensing methods,
    common control channel, radio characteristics, etc. Furthermore, in conventional
    spectrum management, the spectrums are statically allocated to each licensed user.
    If the number of wireless medical device increases, system may face channel congestion
    problem. By introducing the cognitive radio in wireless healthcare, spectrum scarcity
    problem can be solved [9] [11] [13]. To avoid the EMI problem and co-channel interference,
    cognitive radio techniques can be used in a healthcare environment [11]–[13].
    Most of the literature supports homogeneous network architecture based infrastructure
    [11]–[14] [18]–[19]. For the senior citizen healthcare facility like hospital,
    it is obvious to consider the heterogeneous network and architecture. In such
    hospital, stationary and movable devices exist and control the fixed and dynamic
    environment, thus need to consider hybrid network topology. Nodes or all medical/non-medical
    devices are not cognitive radio (CR) capable in most of the CR based healthcare
    literature [11]–[13] [19]–[20]. Future spectrum scarcity is one of the vital arguments
    of necessity of cognitive radio in wireless healthcare system. To avoid that inescapable
    situation for future healthcare, it needs to consider that all medical and nonmedical
    (for communication purpose) are CR enable. Very recently, researches show some
    primary concept of medical device priority scheme [11] [16]. However, there is
    no sufficient literature are also rare in other conventional wireless healthcare
    system [1]–[3] [5]–[6]. The CR based wireless healthcare need to focus on medical
    service based priority management. The recent and future medical devices in a
    hospital would be operates in multimode and provides multi services form same
    machine. And network mobility demands non-stationary priority. It is urgent to
    develop a dynamic and intelligent priority framework for the wireless medical
    and non-medical device to cope up with DSA enabled future hospital design, which
    is absent in reviewed literature [3] [5] [11]–[14] [18]. Location of a device
    is a vital requirement of CR based healthcare system to resolve the EMI issue,
    device priority and transmission power calculation of CR devices [11]–[13]. Most
    of the authors have suggested RFID, GPS and indoor positioning system o locate
    the co-ordinate of CR device [11]–[12] [18]–[19]. Several authors discussed about
    spectrum sensing methods or policies based on their architecture [11] [13] [17]
    [19]. However, device priority based centralize cooperative sensing concept is
    still absent in current wireless healthcare system. Therefore, a dynamic priority
    policy and priority aware protocols, spectrum sensing and network maintenance
    scheme need to be developed for recent and future hospital care system. The proposed
    CogMed satisfies all of the attributes or select the better option that can ensure
    a future robust dynamic spectrum enabled healthcare system. The remaining of this
    paper is organized as follows: Section II describes the proposed network architecture,
    system design, dynamic priority mechanism policies and priority aware spectrum
    decision-making assumptions. Section III contains proposed EMI and priority controlled
    communication protocols like cognitive device to device and device to medical
    admin center communication polices, that is well fit for our proposed architecture.
    Section IV concludes with contributions and provides some future work directions.
    SECTION II. Proposed System Architecture and Priority & Spectrum Policy A. Proposed
    System Brief description The cognitive radio network based hospital is equipped
    with cognitive terminal (CT) enabled wireless medical devices, nonmedical wireless
    communicator, cognitive radio sensor network-CRSN (medical, utility and monitoring)
    and cognitive terminal sink access control (CT-SAC) as access point & spectrum
    fusion center for sensors [17]. In this proposed system, wireless hospital devices
    are mainly categorized into: CR-medical devices and CR non-medical devices. Both
    medical and non-medical devices are subcategorized into real time, non-real time
    manner and only for medical device life supporting and non-life supporting pattern.
    All CR devices can communicate through a wire connected cognitive base station
    (CBS). It is also considered an administration, database (DB) and a monitoring
    cell is connected with cognitive base station controller backhaul [12] [13]. These
    consist of different administrative modules, different database for medical (e.g.
    EMR, device location, different application for WMTS, MICS & other ISM based medical
    devices, EMI inventory (EMI threshold level of all devices) and channel/spectrum
    occupancy register. The location register can retrieve the location of device
    from predefined CR RFID reader network and all devices (both static and dynamic
    device) are RFID tagged [11] [14]. B. Proposed System Architecture of CoGMed CoGMed
    system is based on IEEE 802.22 standard [21]. Fig. 1. Mesh topology based proposed
    CogMed Architecture Show All Fig. 1 illustrates the network architecture of cognitive
    radio based hospital. The cognitive terminal (CT) medical and nonlife supporting
    cognitive terminal enabled sink access control (CT-SAC) are mobile and have direct
    communication link with cognitive base station backbone system in single-hop manner.
    Which mean the topology of our proposed network is hybrid combination of mesh
    and star for CT medical and CT-SAC. The CT-SAC for life supporting sinks access
    are in fixed position and wired connected with main CBS backbone. The communication
    between medical CSRN and admin center is considering single hope communication.
    Fig. 2. Cluster Architecture for Non-medical CR device Show All On the other hand,
    nonlife supporting CT-SAC are consider that they are fixed and that access point
    are dealing with low priority medical non-lifesaving CRSN and transmission is
    Two-hop/multi-hop communication. It is considered, multi-hop communication for
    non-medical cognitive terminal if the nonmedical CR is not at range of CBS. So
    an ad-hoc flat network for these non-medical CR devices would be form to manage
    this multi-hop wireless network. Clustering concept can be introduced to reduce
    the communication cost, balancing traffic load and inner cluster centric spectrum
    distribution. In the Fig. 2. the clustering scenario for non-medical CR devices
    has been shown. The cluster system consists of cluster gateway (GW), cluster head
    (CH) and cluster member (CM). Let''s consider the non-medical device has created
    a flat mesh network. The nonmedical devices within the range of CBS are considered
    as gateway (GW). Non-medical devices within the range of gateway are formatting
    mesh topology based clusters. Considering an undirected graph G = (V, E), where
    V represents the set of health non-medical devices in a region, E represents the
    set of all undirected edges within communication range of devices. A cluster head
    (CH) can be selected considering the parameters of weighted node, number of free
    channel (periodically spectrum sensing) and the priority of the device and rest
    of the non-medical considered as cluster member (within range of CH at same zone).
    The nodes are moveable so the formation of clustering is very dynamic. And the
    nomination of CH changes in the manner of time and node movement. The gateway
    node (Gw) is consider as the border node of cluster and border nodes are connected
    each other for intra cluster communication. CH sends spectrum sensing report including
    spectrum hole and presence the primary users to main fusion center (CBS) via gateway
    node. C. Consideration for priority mechanism policy We have proposed a dynamic
    priority mechanism for heterogeneous topology supported cognitive radio based
    future hospital grid. The two networks are interlinked by cognitive base station
    (CBS) and cognitive terminal sink access control (CT-SAC). There is also a mobility
    agile cluster based network exist to support multi hop routing capable non-medical
    CR device. As per Fig 1, the CBS are static and CT-SAC might be static or dynamic.
    The priority level of CT-SAC based sensor categorized from P1-P3. Where P1 level
    is dedicated for life supporting and MBAN in real time mode. P2 allocated for
    non-real-time life supporting sensor mode and non-life supporting real time mode.
    And nonlife supporting non-real time sensors, rehabilitation purpose non-real
    time sensor like different sensors which is in store forward based data transmission
    mode will be categorized as low priority. Fig. 3. Block diagram of Initial Priority
    Management for CogMed Show All On the other hand, the life-supporting real-time
    mode medical devices, emergency/telemedicine purposes both real-time and non-real-time
    mode having the high priority in terms of spectrum sensing and data transmission.
    As per Fig. 3, the medical, non-medical devices and CT-SAC can be prioritizing.
    The proposed high priority transmissions are lifesaving medical device (real time
    and non-real time), emergency telemedicine service and medical lifesaving CT-SAC.
    Non-lifesaving medical and non-medical real time transmission are categorized
    as middle priority. Rest of the CR medical and non-life are assigned, as low priority
    goes to lower priority. Fig. 3 describes spectrum access and sensing pattern where
    only non-real-time medical life/non-life supporting and emergency telemedicine
    non-real-time mode of transmission are consider to access from WMTS band. It means
    these store-forward capable devices sense the spectrum from WMTS band whereas
    the rest of medical devices and sensor can sense and dynamically access from any
    band. Our proposed priority mechanism is dynamic due to complexity grid system
    and CR devices are mobile. To meet up the requirement of medical service, multimode
    transmission capability of future device and upcoming parameter of next wireless
    healthcare lead a mobility aware priority mechanism technique. The location of
    device also plays an important role in medical priority management. It is considered
    that all hospital wireless medical or non-medical devices are not stationary and
    priority of devices can be changed. In a situation, if any top priority medical
    devices are not able to transmit due to EMI and bandwidth constrain, the admin
    center and network controller instruct the nearby low priority medical and nonmedical
    to go to switch-off mode. D. Primary assumption for co-operative spectrum sensing
    Scheme All cognitive radio enabled devices are spectrum sensing capable and able
    to sense the presence of primary devices (PU), spectrum hole (SH) and distance
    from other devices. The devices starts sensing from low frequency if want to communicate
    (mainly monitoring cell, application API and other CT enable device). It is assumed
    that after acquiring the local sensing information, a CT sends the sensing report
    along with current location of device and other features to its nearby Cognitive
    base station controller (CBS) using defined reporting or common control channel
    for selecting the appropriate frequency and allowable transmission power. It is
    also assumed that some fixed licensed frequencies would be allocated for common
    control or reporting channel purpose by using spectrum broker concept or share
    with any licensed spectrum. The location information of CT-devices has emphasized
    since we need to calculate the maximum transmittable power under threshold level
    of EMI of surrounding device and secondly we are considering that our priority
    mechanism is dynamic and device priority can be altered if the location has changed.
    The transmission power will determine of cognitive radio enable devices by the
    information from EMI inventory and crosschecking retrieved information by CT-device
    provided location and converge information. The CBS is acting as local fusion
    center and determine the spectrum decision of CT devices with CBS coverage. Beside
    the main CBS backhaul system, there also run a sink based networking (CT-SAC)
    for managing the CRSNs. In the second network cognitive terminal sink access control
    acting as sensing decision maker of nearby CR sensors only, setting priority of
    nodes (depend on location and critical level) and calculating transmission power
    of CSRN [8]. This local cognitive base station (CT-SAC) communicates with main
    base station backbone (CBS) through wired or baud band wireless in a single hope
    communication manner. CT-SAC represented as gateway between the CBS network and
    CRSN. And the CT-SAC is multifunctional cognitive radio doing both local sensing
    for own and spectrum fused for adjunct CRSN. In addition a cluster based mesh
    topology driven network also exists to serve the multi hop communication for non-medical
    CR devices. To reduce the communication overhead, the elected cluster leader fused
    the spectrum for its cluster member. Device priority is one major factor to take
    the spectrum decisions along with presence of PU, SH. The benefit of this type
    spectrum sensing is fused it decision such a way that the high priority devices
    are achieving less utilized channels (by PU) and spectrum hands-off is rare situation
    for high priority device. And every CR devices are MIMO radio or at least two
    trans-receivers have to be there. Some limitation lies in single trans-receiver
    (TR) based CR. Reference [11] has suggested single TR because the author has considered
    that low priority non-medical device are CR capable. The advantage of two trans-receiver
    is that one receiver is dedicated for continuous spectrum sensing & and another
    is used for data and CCC. Global common control channel (CCC) should be considered
    in future healthcare system to reduce the transmission complexity [8]–[9] [11]–[12]
    [18]–[19]. Another proposition (from Fig. 2) is that both life supporting and
    nonlife supporting non-real-time WMTS device only sensed the WMTS Band (608–614,
    1395–1401, 1427–1432 MHz). Because WMTS band is not capable transmit the real
    time streaming data [14]–[15]. But the advantages are, less effort needed to upgrade
    the device because the spectrum sensing range is predefined WMTS is appropriate
    for non-real time medical telemetry. Other medical and non-medical device can
    select any band for transmission. CBS will keep the location area based spectrum
    occupancy report and current activity of PU and the admin center keep a historic
    record of spectrum free space and activity of PU. So while the CBS taking spectrum
    decision of any high priority medical user, the fusion center allocated most reliable
    spectrum and less occupied channel to the high priority user and it is expected
    that spectrum hands-off would be rare and dramatically medical reliability would
    be increased. SECTION III. Proposed Network Communication Protocols In this section,
    the following three communication protocols have been proposed: (i) communication
    between medical devices and admin center, (ii) communication between two non-medical
    devices, and (iii) communication between wireless medical sensors and admin center.
    A. Communication Protocol between a Medical Device and Admin Center Communication
    from admin center to a cognitive enabled medical device may become common in a
    wireless hospital management in near future. This is because most of the wireless
    devices are used in vital monitoring purposes and it requires a centralized monitoring
    and alarm zone. The protocol is as follows: The admin center sends a request to
    any medical device for fetching information or monitoring the vital sign of patient.
    The request travels along with medical device id and its current location. It
    is assume that every CR medical device continuously performing the local spectrum
    sensing and update to the CBS. Base station (CBS) confirms the current location
    of device; check the recent priority status of medical device, then determine
    the spectrum decision (form device sensing information & priority) and CBS calculate
    the transmission parameter of that device (EMI threshold level of adjunct devices
    and distance from them. After receiving clearance from CBS, device starts transmitting
    data. B. Communication Protocol for non-medical to non-medical CR device In a
    hospital area communication between doctor and nurse, video conferencing for medical
    consultation, real time patient information retrieval and information of different
    inventory plays a vital role. So to communicate with non-medical CR device from
    other CR communicator and from admin center the following communication protocol
    can establish the connectivity. The process of the communication between two nonmedical
    devices as follows: Let consider device A would like to communicate with device
    B. ‘A’ send his spectrum sensing information, own id, destination id, distance
    from other medical devices, current location and request massage to adjunct CBS.
    In this case CBS first trace the location of device B and set the spectrum decision
    and maximum transmittable power for device A. The CBS of adjunct of device B first
    check the status of B. If B is already in transmitting mode, then the request
    waiting is in queue. Otherwise the CBS (adjunct B) convey the request massage
    to device B and device B send the sensing info, other information along with request
    acknowledgement and clearance massage for device A. The device B receiving the
    spectrum decision and maximum allowable transmission power and communication between
    A & B has established. Here admin center acting as system register (providing
    location information, EMI threshold level of different device) and admin center
    is also communicate to that nonmed CR device for application sharing purposes.
    C. Communication theory for CT-SAC Cognitive Radio enabled sensor network (CRSN)
    can also exist in our future hospital network. CSN are collecting different telemetric,
    medical data and patient vital information and send to Admin center. And the communication
    between CSN and admin center is occurred in following steps: Suppose CR sensor
    u would like to send telemetric data to admin center and electronic medical record
    (EMR). Sensor u sends its sensing information and recent priority to adjunct CT-SAC
    along with the request massage. CT-SAC determines the spectrum decision and transmittable
    power for u . In that mean time adjunct CT-SAC send his sensing report, request
    massage and other information to admin center and CBS to calculating his transmission
    parameter. After receiving the positive acknowledge from admin center CT-SAC allows
    the sensor u to transmit the data. SECTION IV. Conclusion and Future Work In this
    paper, a cognitive radio based system design for future e-health applications
    and hospital management system is proposed. The proposed system design is for
    wireless health care where EMI and other harmful radiation can be avoided. In
    near future, there may be really scarcity of spectrum and will be unsolvable issue
    in wireless communication system. Our proposed system not only ensures the environment
    friendly solution but ensure the reliability in e-health and tele-health field.
    In this article, we have already covered the system architecture, priority control
    management, priority queue system enable spectrum sensing policy and the priority
    and EMI aware communication protocols. In future we would like to extend the current
    research and develop a medical priority aware centralize co-operative spectrum
    sensing policy and traffic load balancing on the overall network. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

- analysis: This paper introduces a novel protocol for the distributed selection of
    a Common Control Channel (CCC) in cognitive radio networks. The protocol aims
    to minimize disruption caused by primary user activity and maximize connectivity
    among nodes when the control channel is established. It also facilitates adaptive

  description: The exponential growth in wireless services has resulted in an overly
    crowded spectrum. The current state of spectrum allocation indicates that most
    usable frequencies have already been occupied. This makes one pessimistic about
    the feasibility of integrating emerging wireless services such as large-scale
    sensor networks into the existing communication infrastructure. Cognitive radio
    is an emerging dynamic spectrum access technology that can be used for flexibly
    and efficiently achieving open spectrum sharing. Cognitive radio is an intelligent
    wireless communication system that is aware of its radio environment and that
    is capable of adapting its operation to statistical variations of the radio frequency.
    In ad hoc cognitive radio networks, a common control channel (CCC) is usually
    used for supporting transmission coordination and spectrum-related information
    exchange. Determining a CCC in distributed networks is a challenging research
    issue because the spectrum availability at each ad hoc node is quite different
    and dynamic due to the interference between and coexistence of primary users.
    In this paper, we propose a novel CCC selection protocol that is implemented in
    a distributed way according to the appearance patterns of primary systems and
    connectivity among nodes. The proposed protocol minimizes the possibility of CCC
    disruption by primary user activities and maximizes node connectivity when the
    control channel is set up. It also facilitates adaptive recovery of the control
    channel when the primary user is detected on that channel. © 2012 KICS.

    Publisher: KICS SECTION I. Introduction Wireless spectrum licensing on a long-term
    basis is currently under way over vast geographical regions. In order to address
    the critical problem of spectrum scarcity, the federal communications commission
    (FCC) has recently approved the use of unlicensed devices in licensed bands [1].
    The report published by the spectrum policy task force of the FCC in 2002 [2],
    which was aimed at improving the way of utilizing the spectrum resource, catalyzed
    intensive research activities in this new field of open spectrum sharing. Consequently,
    dynamic spectrum access (DSA) techniques have been proposed to solve spectrum
    inefficiency problems. Cognitive radio (CR), a term first coined by J. Mitola
    III in 1999 [3], is a promising approach for flexibly and efficiently achieving
    open spectrum sharing [4], [5]. A CR system is an intelligent wireless communication
    system that is aware of its radio environment and is capable of adapting its operation
    to statistical variations of the radio freqeuncy of incoming signals. IEEE 802.22
    [6] is the first standard based on CR. IEEE 802.16h [7] is expected to implement
    CR functions in worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX) networks
    for facilitating the coexistence of homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. A
    number of cognitive radio test-beds based on different architectures and radio
    technologies have been developed [8], [9]. Since most of the useful spectrum is
    already assigned to primary systems (licensed systems), to utilize the spectrum
    holes of the licensed bands, CR devices should be capable of detecting primary
    user signals on the licensed primary channels and not lead to harmful interference
    to the primary system users. Research on CR covers a wide range of areas, including
    spectrum analysis, channel estimation, spectrum sharing, medium access control
    (MAC), and routing. However, CR networks pose unique challenges owing to high
    fluctuations in the available spectrum as well as the diverse quality of service
    (QoS) requirements [5]. Specifically, in ad hoc networks based on CR, the distributed
    multi-hop architecture, the dynamic network topology, and the variation of the
    spectrum availability with time and location are key distinguishing factors. CR
    networks are different from traditional ad hoc networks in the sense that the
    CR networks can opportunistically utilize various spectral holes for smooth peer-to-peer
    communications by virtue of the unique CR functionalities [10]. The ad hoc cognitive
    radio network requires reliable control and spectrum management message exchanges
    between neighbor nodes to communicate local sensing results, set up data channels,
    immediately notify incumbent detection events, announce spectrum handover, and
    so on. These message exchanges are usually assumed to be carried out on a dedicated
    control channel, the so-called common control channel (CCC) [5]. However, in many
    cases, we cannot guarantee that dedicated CCCs can be set up for all different
    cognitive radio networks, and further, dedicated control channels are wasteful
    of channel resources when there is no CR user. Therefore, a dynamic and distributed
    method is required for CCC selection in ad hoc CR networks. In this paper, we
    propose a novel CCC selection protocol (distributed coordination protocol for
    a CCC (DCP-CCC)) in a distributed way, based on the appearance patterns of the
    primary system (PS) and network connectivity. The proposed protocol provides a
    decentralized cluster-based architecture to form a large-scale network, and it
    provides mechanisms to adapt the network topology to network and radio environment
    changes. Preliminary results of the proposed protocol were presented in [11].
    In this paper, we have extended the cluster management methods (cluster merge,
    cluster interconnection, and common channel change schemes) and have intensively
    studied the performance of the proposed protocol for various network conditions.
    The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Related work is discussed in Section
    II. The proposed DCP-CCC protocol is presented in detail in Section III. Cluster
    management is presented in Section IV. The performance of the proposed protocol
    is studied in Section V. Finally, we conclude this paper in Section VI. SECTION
    II. Related Work Most of the existing distributed CR network protocols for MAC
    and routing assume that there exists a dedicated CCC. However, such protocols
    are in conflict with the opportunistic nature of cognitive radio, and moreover,
    most of the available spectrum has already been allocated to existing communication
    systems. Therefore, it may not be feasible to assign dedicated CCCs to all possible
    types of CR networks in the future. Some CR systems use an unlicensed band, such
    as industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) bands, or ultra-wide bands (UWBs)
    for the control channel. In this case, the unlicensed band is already overcrowded
    and suffers strong interference from existing unlicensed band users; therefore,
    reliability, which is one of the most important features of the control channel,
    cannot be guaranteed [12]. In the absence of a dedicated CCC, a distributed and
    dynamic self-configurable procedure is required for setting up a common channel.
    A CCC can be classified as an in-band CCC or out-of-band CCC, depending on whether
    the control channel shares the data channel or uses a dedicated spectrum, respectively
    [13]. In the in-band CCC, the current data transmission channel is also used for
    exchanging control messages. Since each node pair may use a different channel
    for communication, the CCC is generally limited to the corresponding communication
    pair (i.e., local coverage). Therefore, the out-of-band CCC is widely considered
    for ad hoc CR networks. Some studies assume that there exists a common channel
    with global coverage available for all nodes in ad hoc CR networks. The network
    nodes also have the capability determine and use an alternate global control channel
    if the original control channel is jammed [14]–[16]. Two neighboring nodes can
    exchange available channel information or negotiate channel assignments of a link
    via the control channel. In [16] and [17], the authors propose a global control
    channel to carry out the MAC-layer control mechanisms in the open spectrum sharing
    paradigm which is so popular so that it is not required to be explained further.
    The C-MAC protocol presented in [18] is based on the dynamic channel assignment
    protocol [19]. These protocols use the packet-based channel assignment approach.
    However, it is difficult to find a globally common channel in a network, and there
    are frequent individual spectrum changes even if a CCC covering the entire network
    is found. Changing the CCC frequently leads to drastic communication overhead.
    There is high possibility that the global CCC can suffer denial of service (DoS)
    attacks [20]. Therefore, global CCC approaches are unlikely to be applicable to
    real CR network scenarios. Since the probability that a global CCC is available
    to every node in the network is small, CR users can be grouped into clusters and
    a CCC may be used for the nodes in the same cluster. In this case, the selected
    CCC has only group coverage. In [14], Zhao et al. proposed a distributed coordination
    scheme for spectrum allocations that addresses the spectrum variability problem
    without using a global control channel. Zhao et al.''s scheme uses a group coordination
    channel instead. In [21], a close group of users form a sub ad hoc network and
    select a channel for communicating control information. If the primary user of
    the channel returns, then a different channel that is available to everyone in
    the available sub-group channels is chosen. It is assumed that one of the members
    of the group has the capability to connect to the neighboring groups. In CogMesh
    [10], a cluster-based framework is used to form a wireless mesh network in the
    context of open spectrum sharing. The study in [10] investigates the issues involved
    in setting up an ad hoc open spectrum sharing network that coexists with primary
    users of the spectrums and proposes a decentralized cluster-based architecture
    to form a large-scale network. The basic unit of the network is a cluster, which
    is a sub-network formed by a group of neighbor nodes sharing common channels and
    coordinated by a selected node (called cluster head) in the cluster. On the other
    hand, some proposed MAC protocols do not require separate control channels for
    the purpose of control signal exchange. Using a single CCC may introduce control
    channel saturation that degrades the overall performance of the network. In [22],
    SYN-MAC was proposed for avoiding the use of the CCC. The main idea is to divide
    the total time into fixed-time intervals, each corresponding to one of the available
    channels. At the beginning of each time slot, all nodes in the network listen
    to a channel whose time slot is equal to the time required for the exchange of
    control messages. However, this scheme requires global time synchronization. Synchronization
    in an ad hoc network is a challenge owing to the absence of centralized coordination.
    SECTION III. Dcp-Ccc: Distributed Coordination Protocol for Common Control Channel
    Selection A. Network Architecture and Design Requirements Fig. 1 shows the network
    environments of cognitive radio ad hoc networks. We assume that there is no fixed
    dedicated CCC and that the average spectrum idle time of the PSs is much longer
    than the packet transmission time. As shown in Fig. 1, each node may have a different
    set of available channels after local spectrum sensing. In the proposed common
    channel selection and maintenance protocol, we form clusters with desired sizes,
    and within the cluster range, an optimal CCC is selected. In order to choose a
    CCC, the DCP-CCC takes into account not only the locally available spectrum bands
    of each node, but also the temporal and spatial variations in the primary user
    spectrum activities. In Fig. 1, the cluster head (CH) is a node that initiates
    cluster formation for selecting the CCC. The actual cluster nodes that share the
    same CCC are determined by the initially desired cluster size and each node''s
    available channel set. Multiple clusters can be merged or interconnected by using
    gateway nodes. Fig. 1. Proposed ad hoc CR network architecture. Show All The proposed
    DCP-CCC has the following unique design features. No global time synchronization:
    Achieving time synchronization in ad hoc networks is not a trivial task and generally
    requires complex device implementation or synchronization protocols. Therefore,
    we assume that time synchronization is not provided in the proposed method. Configurable
    cluster size: A cluster is a set of nodes that use the same control channel. To
    increase the network connectivity, a cluster should include as many CR nodes as
    possible. If the cluster size is too small, then an entire CR network can be partitioned
    into many small clusters, and they may not be connected to exchange the control
    messages of the MAC and of the routing operations. Even if some of them can be
    interconnected by gateway nodes, the control channel switching overheads of the
    interconnected clusters, which use different CCCs, increase the packet delivery
    time and decrease the throughput. In this paper, the cluster size is adaptively
    configurable when the CH initiates the control channel setup procedure. The actual
    cluster size can be smaller than the desired size when the optimal channel in
    terms of the proposed performance criteria (average primary system appearance
    probability and idle time) is not available for all nodes in the desired cluster.
    Fast common channel setup: In CCC-based MAC operations of ad hoc CR networks,
    before the CCC is setup, each node cannot send data packets to or receive data
    packets from neighbor nodes. Exchanges pertaining to the data channel negotiation
    and transmission time schedule are performed on the control channel. Therefore,
    the control channel setup time should be minimized. Since nodes may have different
    sets of available channels and since they can tune into different channels at
    a given time, ensuring fast message delivery for setting up a common channel is
    not a trivial task. New CCC selection criteria: A single cluster should include
    as many nodes as possible while having a size less than the desired cluster size,
    and the selected channel should have low PS activities. Common channel change
    mechanism upon the primary signal detection: When some of the cluster nodes have
    detected the primary signals of the current CCC, then this information should
    be delivered to the neighbor nodes in the cluster to make them perform local sensing.
    By considering the number of interfering CR nodes, the cluster should decide whether
    all cluster nodes should reselect the control channel or whether the interfering
    nodes should be isolated. Cluster merge and interconnection: For control message
    exchange or packet delivery between any nodes in the entire ad hoc network, the
    clusters should be able to communicate through CCCs. Clusters with the same CCC
    are merged, and the clusters with different CCCs are interconnected by gateway
    nodes in the proposed protocol. The proposed DCP-CCC can set up a wide-area CCC
    that can reach many CR nodes with a single control channel without channel switching.
    In CogMesh [10], which is also a cluster-based common channel CR network, a CH
    constructs a cluster only with single-hop neighbors, and therefore, many gateway
    nodes are required to interconnect other neighboring clusters. Since gateway nodes
    should manage the data transmission schedule for multiple clusters and frequently
    switch channels, their use results in a decrease in the channel throughput. In
    DCP-CCC, the CH selects an optimum control channel on the basis of primary signal
    activities and the number of possibly covered nodes, unlike CogMesh. B. Common
    Control Channel Setup Procedure To set up a CCC, CR nodes follow six steps: 1)
    Local sensing and scanning, 2) common channel invitation, 3) cluster tree construction,
    4) common channel reporting, 5) CCC decision, and 6) common channel advertisement.
    In the following subsections, the operations are explained in detail. 1. Local
    Sensing and Scanning Each node i in a ad hoc CR network periodically or aperiodically
    performs local sensing to determine the available channel set ( C a (i)) and primary
    channels. If a node needs to find an existing cluster to share the common channel,
    then it should scan all channels to possibly receive a common channel beacon (CC_BC)
    message from a neighbor node; CC_BC is periodically broadcast by a CH. A node
    should listen to one channel for a duration of at least T p to receive CC_BC.
    T p is the time interval taken for beacon transmission from the CH. The CC_BC
    includes the CCC information. Therefore, once a node receives the message, it
    can immediately tune to the indicated CCC and start exchanging control messages.
    In this case, there is no explicit procedure for connecting to the CH. The local
    sensing and scanning of each channel may be done simultaneously. 2. Common Channel
    Invitation If a node does not receive any CC_BC during the scanning procedure,
    then it can be inferred that there is no CCC or that the existing CCCs are not
    available for the node. In this case, the CR node initiates the cluster construction
    process by broadcasting a common channel invite (CC_IVT) message to its neighbor
    nodes using carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA).
    The CC_IVT message format is defined as in Fig. 2. The CC_IVT can be rebroadcast
    until the desired cluster size is reached. Transmitting node ID: ID of the node
    that transmits the CC_IVT. CH node ID (cluster head node ID): ID of the node that
    initially generated the CC_IVT. When a CH sends the CC_IVT at first, “Transmitting
    node ID” and “CH node ID” are the same. SEQ number (sequence number): Whenever
    a CH sends a CC_IVT to find a new CCC, it increases the SEQ number by 1. This
    number is for uniquely identifying CC_IVT messages; periodic CC_IVT repetitions
    have the same SEQ number. Hop count: The desired maximum hop counts (cluster size)
    from the CH to retain the same CCC. When a node receives a CC_IVT, it decreases
    the hop count by 1, and it broadcasts it again only if the count is not zero.
    Candidate channel list (CCL): This list contains the candidate channels that can
    possibly be used as the CCC. Whenever a node rebroadcasts a CC_IVT, the CCL can
    be updated. Fig. 2. CC_IVT message format. Show All If a CH node broadcasts the
    CC_IVT message only on a single channel, then some neighbor nodes cannot receive
    the message when the channel used to broadcast the CC_IVT is not available to
    these neighbor nodes. Further, because each CR node tunes into one of the available
    channels at a given time, the neighbor nodes may not be able to receive the message
    even though the channel is available to the neighbor nodes. Therefore, a CH sequentially
    broadcasts a CC_IVT on each available channel using a single transceiver, as is
    shown in Fig. 3. If the CH has multiple transceivers, then the available channels
    are subdivided among the different transceivers. After a duration of T p , the
    CH rebroadcasts the CC_IVT with the same SEQ number. Each neighbor node should
    wait at least for a duration of T p for each of its available channels. If a neighbor
    node does not receive the CC_IVT, then it switches to the next channel on its
    local available channel list. Fig. 3. Broadcasting CC_IVT via the CH. Show All
    3. Common Channel Cluster Tree Construction After a node receives a CC_IVT from
    its neighbor node, it stores the candidate channel list of the CC_IVT and the
    node ID of the transmitting node. When node i receives a CC_IVT from neighbor
    node j , it determines the overlapping common channel set C ^ c (i,j) from its
    local available channel list C a (i) and the CCL of the received CC_IVT, C IVT
    c (j) , from node j . C ^ c (i,j)= C a (i)∩ C IVT c (j). (1) View Source If node
    i first receives a CC_IVT message from node j and C ^ c (i,j)≠Φ , then node i
    records node j as a parent node. Note that within a cluster, each node can reach
    the CH through its parent node using one of the overlapping common channels. Then,
    node i rebroadcasts the CC_IVT with an updated CCL as indicated in (2). C IVT
    c (i)= C c (i,j)= C ^ c (i,j)= C a (i)∩ C IVT c (j) (2) View Source where C c
    (i,j) is the set of channels in the CCL field rebroadcast by nodc i after receiving
    a CC_IVT from node j . After decreasing the hop count of the received CC_IVT,
    unless the hop count is zero, node i sequentially and periodically rebroadcasts
    the CC_IVT message on all available channels. If there are no overlapping channels
    between its locally available channels and the received CCL from node j , then
    it indicates that node i and node j do not have any common channels; therefore,
    they are not able to setup a CCC. In this case, node i simply discards the CC_IVT.
    If node i receives additional CC_IVT messages satisfying the following three conditions
    from any other neighbor node k , then it simply discards them. The same CH node
    ID with the previously received CC_IVT from node j . The same SEQ number. C ^
    c (i,k)⊂ ∪ of node i for all parent nodes j C c (i,j). (3) View Source If some
    channels of C ^ c (i,k) were not included in the previous CC_INV forwarded, then
    it indicates that node i can have new channels that can be used as a CCC; these
    new channels are not selected on the basis of CC_IVTs sent by the previous parent
    nodes. Therefore, if the condition in (4) is satisfied despite the CH node ID
    and SEQ number of the CC_IVT from node i being the same as those in the CC_IVT
    from the previous parent nodes, then node k becomes a new parent node of node
    i and node i rebroadcasts the CC_IVT from node k to its neighbor nodes with the
    CCL in (5). C IVT c (i)= = C ^ c (i,k)⊄ ∪ of node i for all parent nodes j C
    c (i,j), C c (i,k) { C a (i)∩ C IVT c (k)}− ∪ of node i for all parent nodes j
    C c (i,j). (4) (5) View Source Fig. 4 explains the CC_IVT message transmissions
    and presents an example of tree construction. As shown in the figure, the CC_IVT
    message is propagated until the desired cluster size is reached, and the common
    channel cluster tree is constructed accordingly. When there is no neighbor node
    to rebroadcast the CC_IVT or when the neighbor nodes cannot receive the CC_IVT,
    the message cannot be propagated further even if the desired cluster size is not
    reached. It should be noted that unlike the conventional multicasting tree, a
    node can be involved in multiple tree paths because the common control tree is
    built according to channel availability. The numbers in brackets for each node
    are the available channels of that node. Assume that node A is the CH that generated
    the CC_IVT message. Node B receives the CC_IVT message from node A on one of its
    available channels (channel 1 or channel 2) and computes the candidate channel
    list, which consists of the overlapping available channels between node A and
    node B, as indicated in (2). Then, node B rebroadcasts the CC_IVT message (in
    Fig. 4, CC_IVT (3) message). For channel 1 and channel 2, node B records node
    A as a parent node. On the other hand, node D cannot receive the CC_IVT from node
    A because it does not have any available channels overlapping with node A. When
    node B receives CC_IVT (2) from node C, since node B has already set up a common
    channel tree for the channel set {1, 2}, node B simply ignores the message. Fig.
    4. CC_IVT transmission and tree construction. Show All As shown in Fig. 4, node
    H receives two CC_IVT messages. We assume that the CC_IVT from node F arrives
    later than the CC_IVT from E. Node H discovers that the CH node ID and the SEQ
    number of each of the CC_IVTs are the same, but the CCLs are different. At node
    H, first, the candidate channel list with parent node E is derived as {1, 2} using
    (2), and when node H receives the list a little later in the CC_IVT from F, the
    CCL with parent node F is newly derived as {3} using (5). Therefore, node H has
    two parent nodes: Node E for channel set {1, 2} and node F for {3}. When node
    K finally receives the CC_IVT, the hop count reaches 0, and therefore, node K
    stops CC_IVT broadcasting. 4. Common Channel Reporting Common channel report (CC_RPT)
    message is used to deliver CCC information on the path through which the CC_IVT
    is delivered, to the CH to help in deciding the final common channel. For the
    following two cases, a node stops broadcasting a CC_IVT and periodically sends
    back a CC_RPT message to its parent nodes. A node receives a CC_IVT and the hop
    count reaches zero. A node has broadcast a CC_IVT, but has not received any CC_RPT
    message during a certain time T R T R =(R_Hop_Count) T W (6) View Source where
    R_Hop_Count is the hop count at the node when it has broadcast the CC_IVT and
    T W indicates the maximum waiting time to receive a CC_RPT from one hop neighbor
    node. The CC_RPT message format is illustrated in Fig. 5. Transmitting node ID:
    ID of the node that transmits the CC_RPT. CH node ID: ID of the CH node that initially
    generated CC_IVT. SEQ number: The same SEQ number as that of the received CC_IVT.
    Tuple {Ch, P p , T pi , NUM C } : For each candidate common channel on the path
    to the CH, the following definitions hold. Ch : Candidate CCC P p : Accumulated
    PS appearance probability on the channel “ Ch ” T pi : Accumulated average PS
    idle time on the channel “ Ch ” NUM C : Accumulated number of connected nodes
    that can use the channel “ Ch ” as a CCC Fig. 5. CC_RPT message format. Show All
    Each node in ad hoc CR networks senses the channels and maintains a channel status
    table that contains the PS appearance probability ( P p ) and the average PS idle
    time ( T pi ) of each channel. In this paper, we utilize the PS appearance probability
    and idle time statistics for the CCC decision. As we mentioned in the subsection
    on design requirements, to ensure that the common channel in a cluster is used
    by as many nodes of the cluster as possible, information on the number of nodes
    on the channel tree to the cluster head is included in the CC_RPT message. Fig.
    6 shows an example of a CC_RPT delivery procedure. When nodes I and K receive
    CC_IVT messages, the hop count reaches zero, so nodes I and K cease to broadcast
    the CC_IVT and respond with CC_RPT messages to their parent nodes. After node
    C sends a CC_IVT, it does not receive any CC_RPT during a certain time (i.e.,
    2 T W ). Therefore, node C initiates a CC_RPT response message. The CC_PRT message
    is delivered to the parent node on the channel cluster tree to the CH. Note that
    the tree formation from the CH to nodes with a hop count within a predetermined
    value is already performed upon the delivery of the CC_IVT message, so that nodes
    can send a CC_RPT to only their stored parent nodes on available channels. Each
    node on the common channel cluster tree adds the PS appearance probability and
    the average primary idle time of each channel to the received CC_RPT message.
    In Fig. 6, node B adds its local measurement information on channel 1 to that
    of CC_RPT (2) from node G, so that the tuple of channel 1 of CC_RPT (3) is {1,
    0.8, 25, 3}. Node H has two different parent nodes, E and F, for the candidate
    channel sets {1, 2} and {3}, respectively. Therefore, the channel information
    on {1, 2} and {3} is delivered to the CH through node E and node F, respectively.
    In the proposed mechanism, the channel and connectivity information of each node
    inside the desired cluster size is delivered to the CH through a unique path so
    that each node''s information is not counted as duplicate content. Fig. 7 shows
    the pseudocode for our proposed CC_RPT transmission scheme. Fig. 6. CC_RPT transmission
    example. Show All Fig. 7. Pseudocode for the common channel reporting procedure.
    Show All 5. Common Control Channel Decision A CH maintains a candidate CCC status
    table. Whenever the CH receives CC_RPT messages, it updates the table. For each
    channel in the received CC_RPT messages, P p , T pi , and the connected nodes
    are accumulated. Finally, the CH divides P p and T pi by the number of connected
    nodes for each channel after the CH has received a sufficient number of CC_RPT
    messages, or after the maximum waiting time has expired. The cluster head can
    estimate the average PS appearance probability, average PS idle time, and the
    total number of possibly connected nodes including CH itself for each candidate
    CCC. Therefore, the CH can identify a CCC based on the PS activities and determine
    the number of nodes that can be connected together via a common channel. Table
    1 shows the status of each candidate channel for the example scenario in Fig.
    6. Table 1. Candidate CCC status for a scenario corresponding to the table in
    Fig. 6. Depending on the importance of each parameter, the CH can determine the
    optimal CCC. Various decision rules can be applied (e.g., a cost function with
    different weights for three parameters). In this paper, the purpose of determining
    a CCC is that as many CR nodes as possible should be able to share the same CCC
    as long as the primary activity values are less than the pre-defined thresholds.
    As shown in Fig. 8, in step 1, the channel set CS P is determined by considering
    the PS appearance probability, and the average PS idle time is considered in step
    2. From the channel set CS T , the channel with the largest number of connected
    nodes is finally selected for use as the CCC. After step 1 or step 2, if the number
    of channels determined is less than 2, then the channel with the minimum P p (in
    step 1) or maximum T pi (in step 2) is selected. Fig. 8. Procedure for the CCC
    decision. Show All 6. Common Control Advertisement After the CH determines the
    optimal CCC, information on the selected CCC is sequentially broadcast with a
    common channel advertisement (CC_ADV) message to the nodes in the cluster hop
    count on all available channels. After a sufficient number of CC_ADV transmissions
    have been completed, the CH switches to the CCC and periodically broadcasts CC_BC.
    The CC_BC is a message to indicate activation of the new CCC. The neighbor nodes
    that receive CC_ADV sequentially rebroadcast the CC_ADV along with their available
    channels and then switch to the CCC. Therefore, switching to the new CCC is performed
    sequentially in the cluster. When a node receives a CC_ADV message, the selected
    CCC may not be available to the node. In this case, the node discards the CC_ADV
    and tries to find or construct a new cluster by starting from procedure A (scanning).
    It should be noted that since ad hoc nodes can move without notifications, the
    CH should periodically reinitiate the common channel setup procedure. In this
    paper, the proposed CCC selection algorithm relies on many broadcast messages.
    Since radio signals are likely to overlap with other signals in a geographical
    area, straightforward broadcasting usually results in serious redundancy and collision,
    which is referred to as the broadcast storm problem. To reduce the number of broadcast
    packets and possible packet losses resulting from collisions, several mechanisms
    have been proposed in the literature, such as a probabilistic scheme, a counter-based
    scheme, and spanning tree clustering [23], [24]. Any broadcast storm avoidance
    mechanism can be used with the proposed method. SECTION IV. Cluster Management
    A. Cluster Merge and Interconnection Multiple CCC clusters organized in the network
    can be merged or interconnected by gateway nodes. Cluster merge and interconnection
    mechanisms facilitate seamless data exchanges between any pair of nodes in the
    network by enhancing the network connectivity. A node that already uses a CCC
    of a certain cluster may overhear another cluster''s CC_ADV or CC_BC messages
    through one of the available channels during its normal operation. When both clusters
    use the same control channel, the overhearing node can be a gateway node to merge
    two clusters, as shown in Fig. 9(a). In this case, all ad hoc nodes in the two
    clusters can exchange control messages by using a single common channel. If the
    CCC in the overheard messages is different but one available to the node, then
    the node can interconnect the two clusters via control channel switching, as shown
    in Fig. 9(b). Fig. 9. Cluster merge and interconnection: (a) Cluster merge and
    (b) cluster interconnection. Show All In the case of cluster interconnection,
    if a single transceiver is used to access a common control channel, the gateway
    node needs to divide its resources between both clusters, as shown in Fig. 9(b),
    so the neighbor nodes (nodes B and G) of the gateway node should know the exact
    time schedule of the gateway node. The time schedule indicates when the gateway
    node switches to the neighbor cluster''s CCC. Therefore, the greater the number
    of gateway nodes in the network, the higher the cluster connection overheads and
    the lower the control channel throughput. In the proposed procedure for CCC selection,
    a CH selects a CCC that can reach many nodes without gateway nodes. When the CH
    selects a new control channel, it considers the number of nodes connected to each
    candidate CCC, which is obtained from NUM c in the CC_RPT message. Another method
    to reduce the gateway nodes in this paper is to broadcast a gateway node announcement
    to its neighbors. If there are many overlapping nodes between two clusters, we
    may have multiple candidate gateway nodes. Once any node assumes the gateway role,
    it broadcasts a gateway advertisement (GATE_ADV) message to its neighbor nodes,
    and any neighbor node that receives the message will not be a gateway node. The
    GATE_ADV message includes the CH IDs of both clusters. B. Common Channel Change
    Even though the CH selects the CCC after proper consideration of the average PS
    appearance probability and idle time, the PS may suddenly use the CCC. Since the
    cognitive radio network should avoid harmful interference with PSs, when nodes
    detect the primary signal on the current CCC, the detection information should
    be conveyed to the neighbors. In addition, the detecting nodes should stop using
    the CCC, to protect the PSs. In the proposed mechanism, the primary system detection
    information is delivered to the CH, and the CH decides whether the common channel
    should be changed. This decision will be made on the basis of the cost of changing
    the CCC (i.e., message exchange overhead and delay) and the number of detecting
    nodes in the cluster. If the CCC is not changed, then the detecting nodes simply
    leave the cluster without exchanging messages. As mentioned in Section III, the
    detecting nodes may try to form a new cluster or join one of the other existing
    clusters. 1. Primary Detection Notification When a node detects a primary signal
    on the current CCC, it sends a common channel detection (CC_DET) message to the
    CH on the present CCC and immediately returns to listen mode. In this mode, a
    node can listen to a common channel signal, but it is prohibited from sending
    messages on the channel. Even though it is not on the routing path to the CH,
    any neighbor node that overhears the CC_DET message performs local sensing to
    determine whether it is inside the primary signal area. The CC_DET message includes
    the CH node ID, the SEQ number (the same as the SEQ in CC_ADV), information on
    the primary detected CCC, and NUM d . NUM d is the number of detecting nodes on
    the routing path. At the first detecting node, NUM d is set to 1. 2. Forwarding
    CC_DET Message When a node receives a CC_DET message, if it is the next node on
    the routing path, then it forwards the message to the CH node. If it is not on
    the routing path and has simply overheard the message, then it performs local
    sensing. If the node detects a primary signal on the CCC as a result of local
    sensing, then it initiates the primary detection notification procedure by sending
    a CC_DET message. If the node is on the path and has also detected a primary signal
    and if it has not previously forwarded any CC_DET message with the same SEQ and
    CH node ID, then it increases NUM d by 1 and forwards the CC_DET to the CH. If
    the node has already transmitted the CC_DET with the same SEQ and CH node ID to
    the same CH node or if it does not detect a primary signal on the CCC, then it
    simply forwards the message to the CH without increasing NUM d . Fig. 10 shows
    the CC_DET forwarding procedure. Nodes A, B, C, D, E, F, and G belong to the cluster
    using channel 1 as the CCC; node A is the CH of that cluster. As soon as node
    F detects the primary signal of channel 1, it transmits a CC_DET to its neighbor
    node E that is on the routing path to node A. Since node E is also within the
    range of the primary signal, it increases NUM d by 1. Node B is not influenced
    by the primary signal, and therefore, it forwards the CC_DET to node A without
    increasing NUM d . Fig. 10. Forwarding CC_DET. Show All 3. Common Channel Change
    On the basis of the received CC_DETs, the CH decides whether it should change
    the cost CCC. To change the current CCC, the CH should take into account of CCC
    in terms of the number of control message exchanges and the delay in forming a
    new cluster. The percentage of NUM d in the total number of nodes in the cluster
    can be used to determine CCC change criteria. If the CH decides to change the
    current CCC, then it broadcasts a common channel change (CC_CNG) message in all
    available channels, including the new CCC. The new channel is selected from the
    candidate common channel set shown in Table 1. If there is no candidate channel
    for the new CCC, then the CH initiates a new common channel construction procedure
    by sending a CC_IVT. When a node receives a CC_CNG, it decreases the hop count
    and checks whether the hop count is zero. If it is not zero, the node rebroadcasts
    the CC_CNG on all available channels. Then, the node switches to the new CCC.
    4. Cluster Division If a node in the listen mode is not able to hear the CC_CNG
    message from the CH until the CC_CNG waiting time has expired or if the new CCC
    of the received CC_CNG is not available to the node, then the node starts a new
    CCC setup procedure as discussed in Section III. Before it initiates a new cluster,
    it should wait to check whether it receives any CC_BCs from neighboring clusters
    for joining one of the existing clusters. If there is no CC_BC matching the available
    channels, then it starts to create a new cluster by sending a CC_IVT message.
    In this case, cluster division can occur. SECTION V. Simulation Results In this
    section, simulation experiments conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed
    algorithm are discussed. For the simulation study, we implemented a CR network
    simulator completely in object-oriented C++, and the simulator includes a multi-channel
    system environment, channel sensing, and CSMA/CA based data transmission. We employ
    the common channel selection algorithm of CogMesh [10], [25] for performance comparison.
    CR network devices are randomly placed in a two-dimensional area 600 m×600 m ,
    and the maximum transmission range of a CR node is set to 40 m. We use the ON-OFF
    model for the PS appearance pattern. The CSMA/CA back-off mechanism is used when
    each node sends control messages. The entire area is subdivided into 36 grids
    ( 6×6 grids), as shown in Fig. 11. PSs are located at the cross points of the
    grids, and they affect the 4 neighboring grids. The channels used by the PSs are
    randomly selected from the channel pool (CP). The specific simulation parameters
    are shown in Table 2. Fig. 11 shows an example of a topology (300 CR nodes in
    the entire network and 5 channels in the CP) considered in our simulation study.
    Fig. 12 shows the corresponding PS appearances on grids G1, G15, and G25. From
    the ON-OFF model, the activation and idle time of the PSs are found to follow
    an exponential distribution with λ and μ . We set λ as 0.2 and μ as 0.4. Fig.
    11. Example of a simulation topology. Show All Fig. 12. PS appearances according
    to the ON-OFF model. Show All Table 2. Simulation parameters. In the first experiment,
    we observe the average number of clusters for different numbers of nodes. As shown
    in Fig. 13, when the cluster size (CS) is set to 1, the proposed scheme shows
    performance similar to that of CogMesh. However, as we increase the cluster size,
    the number of generated clusters decreases in the proposed method. Therefore,
    many CR nodes can have the same common channel. The number of channels in the
    CP is fixed at 5 in Figs. 13 and 14. Fig. 13. Number of clusters. Show All Fig.
    14. Number of isolated nodes. Show All The number of single-node clusters is compared
    for the different methods in Fig. 14. A single-node cluster has only a single-node
    that is acting as a CH. It can be considered as an isolated node, and it cannot
    exchange control messages with neighbor nodes. Therefore, a smaller percentage
    of single-node clusters indicates better network connectivity. As shown in Fig.
    14, the proposed method results in a lesser number of isolated nodes. In the CCC
    selection, it is desirable that the selected CCC should be stable for the longest
    time possible. This stability can be measured by determining the average PS appearance
    probability and the average idle time of the PS of the chosen CCC. For different
    CP sizes, ranging from 1 to 20 channels, the stability factors are compared (Figs.
    15 and 16). The number of nodes in the network is set to 150. Regardless of the
    total number of channels, PS appearance probabilities determined by using CogMesh
    do not show a specific trend with increasing CP for the selected CCC because it
    is not aware of the PS statistics. When the network has a single channel, the
    two algorithms show similar performances in selecting the CCC. However, as the
    number of channels in the CP increases, the proposed protocol shows outstanding
    performance with regard to not only the PS appearance probability but also the
    CCC idle time. In other words, the proposed method needs less frequent CCC changes
    compared to the conventional method. Fig. 15. Average PS appearance probability
    for the selected CCC. Show All Fig. 16. Average primary system idle time for the
    selected CCC. Show All Fig. 17 presents the number of clusters for different CP
    sizes. When the size of the CP is one, the network is reduced to a single-channel
    network. Upon increasing the CP size, CogMesh retains a similar number of clusters.
    On the other hand, the number of clusters is significantly reduced as the CPs
    are increased in the proposed protocol because if the number of channels increases,
    then each cluster can find a CCC that can cover many CR nodes with high possibility.
    Fig. 17. The number of clusters in different CPs: (a) CogMesh and (b) proposed.
    Show All In Fig. 18, we show the average delay of cluster formation. To successfully
    set up a CCC for a cluster, some control message exchanges (CC_IVT, CC_RPT, and
    CC_ADV) are required in the proposed method. When the cluster size is 1, the required
    time is relatively short and similar to that of CogMesh. However, as the cluster
    size increases, the path from a CH to the last node on the cluster boundary also
    increases, so the average delay increases. However, the larger the cluster size,
    the more the nodes that can use the CCC and the lesser the number of gateway nodes
    required. Fig. 18. Average delay for cluster formation. Show All Figs. 19 and
    20 show the number of gateway nodes for cluster merging and cluster interconnection,
    respectively. As the number of nodes in the network increases, we can observe
    that the number of gateway nodes also increases. In the proposed method, as the
    CS increased, the required number of gateway nodes for a given number of nodes
    in the network decreases since each cluster contains more member nodes. The gateway
    node should perform common channel switching, resource sharing between multiple
    clusters, and frequent control message exchanges. Therefore, a small number of
    gateway nodes are required if reliable network connectivity is supported. The
    proposed method (with CS≥2 ) always shows a lesser number of gateway nodes than
    CogMesh, as can be observed in Figs. 19 and 20, and the network connectivity is
    also superior to that of CogMesh, as shown in Fig. 14. Fig. 19. Number of gateway
    nodes that perform cluster merging. Show All Fig. 20. Number of gateway nodes
    that perform cluster interconnection. Show All Fig. 21 explains the CCC change
    trials performed by the CH when the nodes detect PS appearances. In this experiment,
    the number of nodes is 300, and if the number of detected nodes in a certain cluster
    is 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30% of the total number of nodes in the cluster, then
    the CH tries to change the existing CCC. In the proposed method, upon detecting
    PS appearances, the detecting node in a certain cluster sends a CC_DET message
    to its CH. After the CH receives several CC_DETs, it should decide on the basis
    of the number of detected nodes whether the cluster should change the current
    CCC. If a large number of nodes detect the PS, then the CH selects a new CCC using
    the aforementioned CCC selection algorithm. The x-axis of Fig. 21 represents the
    threshold percentage of detecting nodes required to effect a CCC change. As expected,
    a lower threshold percentage results in more CCC change trials. In fact, a CCC
    change involves high cost in terms of convergence time, cluster re-formation,
    and message exchanges. Therefore, if the area of the primary detected signal is
    relatively small, then local CCC repair is preferred. In local CCC repair, if
    the nodes that transmitted CC_DET do not receive any CCC change message within
    a predetermined time, then they simply join one of the neighbor clusters or start
    a new cluster formation process. Fig. 21. CCC change trials performed by the CH
    upon detecting the PS. Show All Fig. 22 shows the CCC switching delay. When a
    CH decides to change the current CCC, it transmits a CC_CNG message and the message
    is sent to all the nodes in the cluster. In this experiment, we measured the delay
    up to the instant at which a node successfully changed the control channel after
    the CH announced a CCC change. As can be observed in Fig. 22, as the cluster size
    increases, the average delay also increases. Since the CC_CNG is sent from the
    CH, a node that is closer to the CH can switch to the new control channel much
    faster than cluster boundary nodes. Fig. 22. Common control channel switching
    delay. Show All SECTION VI. Conclusion In this paper, we have proposed an efficient
    common control channel selection protocol for ad hoc networks in the context of
    CR. The control channel for CR operation is constructed in a distributed way.
    To determine an optimal common control channel, we have defined a channel-based
    tree from the cluster head to the nodes within a predetermined number of hops.
    The proposed distributed coordination protocol takes into account the primary
    system activities of each channel and node connectivity for common channel selection.
    We have also proposed a primary detection notification procedure to efficiently
    change the common control channel. In a simulation study, we have evaluated the
    protocol performance under various network conditions. Compared with the conventional
    CogMesh CR clustering method, the proposed DCP-CCC requires a smaller number of
    clusters, and therefore, many CR nodes can communicate with the same control link.
    Further, the proposed DCP-CCC enhances the control channel connectivity at the
    cost of an increase in the delay in cluster formation. The most important contribution
    of this paper is that the common control channel selected by using the proposed
    protocol is more reliable and stable since it is selected by considering channel
    activities of the primary systems. The proposed protocol also reduces the frequency
    with which control channels are changed and cluster re-formation. Authors Figures
